<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is customary to write prefaces to books, either to assign the reasons of the publicati∣on, or the value of the performance; neither of these are intended by this preface. The reasons of publication men may imagine for themselves, and would do so although they were expressly told: The merit of the discourses every one may judge of also, according as they understand them. Liberty is the professed principles of the <HI>Author;</HI> this he would chuse to have to himself, and give to every one; and at the same time he would not willingly offend any. What sentiments may be in these discourses, different from any other man's opinion, the <HI>Author</HI> claims his own liberty for speaking them, and will never blame others for doing the same. He is far from intending to differ from any, in sup∣porting true and undefiled religion, and professes to support every worthy character of every denomination. What society he ever shall be connected with, he will endeavour to support, without any persons hurt; and still seek peace,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>and pursue it with all christians. The cause and character of his Brethren, he accounts his duty and interest to support; for that reason, he ever shall study to guard against what may offend them in every indifferent thing.</P>
<P>The love and fellowship of all good men he will ever value, and will not quarrel with them for difference in judgment. Whatever names the ill-natured world may give them, it is no∣thing to the author, he judgeth for himself; and why may not every one else? The reproachful names of <HI>Arian, Socinian, Arminian,</HI> are, in his opinion, rather words of course, than any words of signification. Every malicious man gives them to those they do not love, because they know the common people hate the very sound of them. What <HI>Paul</HI> said of idols may be said of these, <HI>An idol is nothing, but as men con∣sider it;</HI> and on all these things, as many men, as many minds. Why not then love all whom we see evidence religion in their lives and conduct, and leave God to judge their faith and opinions. These discourses the <HI>Author</HI> recom∣mends to every serious reader, to consider with candour, and censure after as he pleaseth. The <HI>Author</HI>'s name and character is not worthy of any esteem in the world, he is willing to offer it a sacrifice for His honour, who made himself of no reputation for the sake of sinners. Popula∣rity is what the <HI>Author</HI> neither seeks nor re∣gards; or if he did, there are sundry passages in these sermons would frustrate his intentions.
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>To please he ever intends, but despiseth all po∣pularity but what is honest and sincere, and consistent with truth and goodwill to others. In fine, what is here presented to the public, are sermons delivered to a Dissenting congregation, for their edification; and that they may edify, is the sincere wish of,</P>
<P><HI>The AUTHOR.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON I. Revelation set in Opposition to En∣thusiasm.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. xvi.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the foundation of the Christian faith, and all the rules of the Christian practice, are contained in the Holy Scriptures, it is necessary in order to have a well ground∣ed faith, and regular conversation, to understand the author, nature, and meaning of the Holy Ora∣cles. <HI>Timothy,</HI> that he might both be a strong saint, and an able minister of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is ex∣horted by St <HI>Paul</HI> to give himself wholly to the study of the Scriptures. This exhortation is en∣forced from the authority and usefulness of the Scriptures themselves, and the great end proposed to a steady adherence to religion.</P>
<P>THE Apostle lays it down as the best antidote against error and mistake in either faith or practice, to be well grounded in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures: and indeed without an understanding of, and faith in, divine revelation, error and heresy are unavoidable. Our Saviour tells the <HI>Sadducees</HI> that they erred, not knowing the Scriptures; and all the mistakes among the different persuasions of Christians proceed from the same source of igno∣rance. The Scriptures of the Old and New Tes∣tament
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>are the only rule to direct men how they are to glorify God, and enjoy him. In the days of the apostle, the scriptures of the Old Testament were the foundation of faith and practice to the church then: To these he seems specially to re∣fer, in our text in his advice to <HI>Timothy;</HI> but to the church now, both Old and New Testaments are intended for the same purpose: These also are given to be the foundation of our confidence in God and the rule of our duty.</P>
<P>To open up in as few words as possible, the meaning and design of the apostle in the text, I pro∣pose,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To explain the nature of inspiration when applied to the scripture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Shew that all things necessary to be believed in matters of faith, and per∣formed in matters of practice, are contained in these dictates of divine inspiration.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Shew that no∣thing can be added to these holy oracles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. De∣monstrate that the scriptures are the only standard to judge of all new discoveries by. Then make some improvement of the subject.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to things never before revealed, that are prophetically declared in the scripture, which con∣tained either mercies to be bestowed, or judgments to happen, the inspiration consisted in the spirit's suggesting to the mind of the inspired person, an exact picture or draught of what was to come to pass. This was sometimes done in dreams by night, or in extasies and visions in the day time, as was the case of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> and others of the pro∣phets. This was not a sudden transient fancy that went off in a moment, like many of men's ordinary dreams and nocturnal visions, that can no more be ac∣counted for when they are over; but a lasting impres∣sion upon the mind of the inspired person, whereby they could recapitulate, in every circumstance, a long time after, the whole of what had been revealed.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<P>JEREMIAH could, after the first roll was burnt, repeat the same over-again to <HI>Baruch,</HI> which shews the impression of what was revealed remained still upon his mind. Moral truths, which were either grounds of faith or rules of duty, were in like man∣ner suggested to the mind of the inspired person; and the lively types thereof often remained for a long time after upon their imagination. These moral truths evidenced themselves to be of divine original, from their similitude to the nature of God; and these ideas a rational being will readily conceive of Him. The inspired person's mission to publish and teach these doctrines, was confirmed by mira∣culous signs and wonders, which were performed beyond what is in the power of human nature to effect. <HI>Moses</HI> performed many notable miracles to confirm his mission, to publish and teach his laws and doctrine to the children of <HI>Israel:</HI> And our Saviour also did many things that evidenced his divine mis∣sion, that he came from God, and that his doctrine was true: For a ruler of the Jews confess'd, <HI>that no Man could do such things unless God was with him.</HI> The most certain and infallible evidence at∣tended the whole of these revelations, that frequent∣ly the very course of nature was changed to confirm the certainty thereof. The dead were raised; the blind received their sight; the dumb spake; the lepers were cleansed. What was foretold by pro∣phecy was also fulfilled, at least as much as is suffi∣cient to convince us that the rest will be accom∣plished.</P>
<P>THE scriptures are the dictates of divine inspira∣tion, in as much as the Holy Spirit drew the ori∣ginal types of all these truths, moral or prophetical, which now stand in the sacred volumes. As suf∣ficient evidence attended this inspiration, so we may rest satisfied that it came from God, It would have
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>been unsafe for the church of God to have depend∣ed upon the certainty of this revelation, unless suf∣ficient evidence had attended it: But God at sundry times and divers manners confirmed these truths; he ordered his prophets and servants to write, by appending his own seal to these sacred enunciations, which in other cases was never heard of. Hence the scriptures are no uncertain dreams of disordered minds, but an inspiration of God's spirit for the hap∣piness of men. But here it may be observed, that inspiration was never properly intended as the im∣mediate means of conversion to those that were in∣spired, but to qualify them to fulfil that important trust and office God had called them unto. It must therefore follow of consequence, that this divine in∣spiration was not a necessary converting mean to every one that was inspired, otherwise all inspired persons should have been converted, and that none of the prophets were converted till they were in∣spired, which is contrary to plain scripture evidence. The scriptures afford us instances of persons that never were converted, that yet had the spirit of inspi∣ration, such as <HI>Balaam,</HI> and the High Priest that foretold the necessity of our Saviour's death.</P>
<P>IF inspiration be the proper infallible evidence of conversion, <HI>Balaam</HI> and this High Priest deserve a place in the callender of the saints: For the one saw the visions of God, falling into a trance, having his eyes opened; and the other prophesied of a very remarkable and interesting event, which according∣ly came to pass. Moreover, except the apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> the sacred records inform us of none that were converted by visions and extraordinary re∣velations: And these were not so much designed for his conversion, as to confirm him by an extra∣ordinary evidence, of these truths that were at that
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>time the most necessary to be vindicated, namely, the resurrection and ascension of <HI>Jesus:</HI> And as this apostle was called to a very weighty and important work, to preach the death and resurrection of the Son of God to such as had the strongest prejudices against such doctrines, it was necessary he should be able, upon the surest grounds to say, he was not behind the very chiefest of the apostles, because he had seen the Lord.</P>
<P>HAD inspiration, suggestion, and vision, been necessary marks of regeneration, then none of the prophets could have been said to be converted till they were called to prophesy, and inspired with fit∣ness for their office, which is contrary to express scrip∣ture testimony. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> were sanctified from the womb, but neither of them were inspired with a divine impulse to prophesy and preach from the time they were born. These divine movements of the Holy Spirit, in an extra∣ordinary manner, were peculiarly designed to in∣spire these penmen of sacred writ, or to conduct the church in receiving or rejecting what was or what was not canonical. When the designed measure of moral truths, relating to men's faith and practice, was filled up; and the number of prophecies to be ful∣filled, or promises to be performed were compleat∣ed, the gift of inspiration ceased: When the canon of scripture was finished and received, inspiration with the power of working miracles came to a period.</P>
<P>THOUGH indeed for a long time after, preten∣sions to inspiration and the power to work miracles was claimed by some, and false and counterfeit mi∣racles and inspirations were imposed upon the world, yet none of them were supported with sufficient evidence, and were in time found out to be spuri∣ous:
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>They wanted that evidence to support them that was necessary, and what the true oracles had; and so fell under discredit as the other gained re∣putation.</P>
<P>IT is plain from the nature of the thing, that in∣spiration was temporary, and not always to be con∣tinued in the church. In ordinary cases the divine proceedings are according to ordinary rules, and as neither the present nor some preceding times require such gifts, experience bears witness that they have been laid aside. Whatever things may be suggested to men's minds now, are no further to be regarded than they can be reduced to ordi∣nary rules laid down in scripture: For if any man now pretend to what is extraordinary, the world has a just claim to demand evidence in-pro∣portion to his high pretensions. We find the most eminent work of God in the primitive times, in converting sinners, ascribed to the ordinary means of preaching the gospel, attended with the divine power of the Holy Ghost, which pierced the hearts of guilty sinners, and made them cry out, <HI>What shall we do to be saved?</HI> But we have no account that all these converts were inspired with gifts like the a∣postles, nor do we at all find any more notice taken of the far greatest part of them, but that they were converted and baptized. Divine revelation men∣tions no inspiration on the part of these converts, and yet assures us they were converted, though they saw no vision, nor heard any voice from heaven. There was here no inspiration properly so called, or any types or images of things imprinted upon the minds of these converts, as lasting patterns, or rules; but the whole of this work is reduced to the ordinary standard of faith and repentance, before taught in the scriptures. The apostles, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> the instruments of this work, were indeed in∣spired
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>by the Holy Ghost, but this converted mul∣titude were not so inspired; nothing was suggested to them at their conversion, but what was already contained in the law and the testimony as duty and promise.</P>
<P N="2">2. INSPIRATION consisted in that infallible di∣rection wherewith the inspired writers were conduct∣ed in relating matters of fact. This was not any impression of the types and images of things upon the imagination of those inspired persons, but a powerful assistance given them, whereby they set down what they saw and heard without prejudice. The Holy Spirit so directed them that they wrote nothing historical but what they were sure was fact, and what they had from the best authority; nor em∣braced any report, however plausible, without suf∣ficient evidence that it was true. This inspiration was not an impression of all the words and idioms be∣longing to the subject to be written, or delivered upon the imagination or fancy, but a wise direct∣ing power, that guided the writer in the right use of historical evidence. It was impossible for all the cunning of imposture to deceive them, or the in∣fluence of secular advantage to prejudice them, or the force of human tyranny to deter them from writing or telling the truth.</P>
<P>THE Spirit of God afforded them sufficient knowledge of the subject they were to write, and brought to their mind what he intended for the good of his church: But they were not always at the same time directed by vision and preternatural phaenomena, nor was this at all times necessary to denominate them inspired; for the right use of or∣dinary means by the infallible direction of the spi∣rit, was sufficient to guide the sacred amanuenses in declaring or writing matters of fact. The spirit
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>only directed their reason to draw just inferences from what was made known unto them. This was a direction in judgment, whereby they were en∣abled to understand what was best suited for the purpose intended, and make the best use of it. The apostles were directed in writing their epistles to the churches, to chuse what was most proper for them, and most universally useful for all future periods; but in doing this they collated all the accounts and circumstances of these churches, and used the most rational arguments to convince them of the truth, and administred the most suitable reproofs to bring them back from error, or guard them a∣gainst it. The Divine Spirit so directed them to teach and write, that all their adversaries were not able to confute their arguments, nor deny the facts they narrated. A being freed from all partiality in favour of party or sect, was a special branch of their inspiration.</P>
<P>THE Holy Ghost so guided these sacred writers that they were no more attached to one person or thing than another, as to what they said or wrote about them, but told what was true; because they were certain it was so. And as the Spirit moved them to pub∣lish these truths and facts, so he conducted then all along to keep by the same. In no one thing were they left to follow their own judgment, as to the truth itself; but as it was given them by sufficient evidence, so they kept strictly by it in all their public declarations. The concord and agree∣ment of their various writings, though done at different times and different places, abundantly bear witness that they were under the direction of the same unerring spirit, as to what they taught and asserted.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2d. To shew that all things to be believed in matters of faith, and performed in matters of practice, are contained in the Holy Scrip∣tures.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS will appear from God's moral character as the author of the sacred oracles. As a God of perfect truth and holiness, he hath given a revelation of himself, in his attributes and designs to his church. He hath set forth there, both what he is and what he will be to them that serve him: His character there is that he is a holy, true, good and just be∣ing; and as all the essential principles of good∣ness, justice and truth, are contained in this reve∣lation, as also all the suitable means for the right improvement of them, and motives to engage them in a free voluntary exercise of virtue and religion; so every thing else as a standard of faith, or rule of life, must be superceded.</P>
<P>IT would be a darkening of God's moral cha∣racter, as the author of such a revelation, to sup∣pose any other was necessary, or could be so, when all things worthy of a perfect first cause to render himself amiable, and his reasonable creatures happy, are contained in this copy of his revealed will. To find fault with this revelation, is even to destroy the first principles of natural religion; for if to view the Deity in the works and operations of his hands, in a manner becoming his glory as a perfect cause, be binding upon us by the law of nature, certainly this law of nature obliges us to believe what he says, as well as to view respectively what he hath wrought. If God's moral character, shining but darkly in his works, obliges every reasonable creature to fear and reverence him; much more does the clear discovery of his mind in the holy scriptures bind them to rule their faith and practice by this revelation. If
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>in the scriptures there be pure precepts and rules to conduct men to true happiness, as the like cannot be found in any other system, it must be a reflec∣tion upon God's moral character to seek any other revelation. And if we add to this, that the fullest promises for our encouragement, in our attempts to do any duty, are contained in the scriptures, it must in all respects be perfect for a ground of faith and rule of duty.</P>
<P>SEEING he hath given us a compleat system of all things needful for our salvation in the scriptures, it is a reflection upon his moral character, as the benevolent Saviour of his people, and the wise and gentle benefactor of all his creatures, not wholly to depend upon it. If the scriptures be a revelation from God, if he hath therein bounded all future dis∣coveries in religion, and made these the rule for us to judge by, then this must be according to his character, for he can do nothing unbecoming him∣self, which certainly would be the case if he impo∣sed an imperfect system of religion upon men. If God's moral character be perfect, so must the scrip∣tures be, of which he is the author, and cannot injure the one without hurting the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. This will appear when it is considered that all that is good, beautiful, amiable and delightful, is summed up in this book of divine revelation: And what is reckoned the excellency of natural religion, is better displayed in revelation than in any other system. Besides many things necessary for our su∣preme happiness are revealed in the sacred oracles, that never were nor could be discovered by natural religion, nor by any means whatsoever, but by a re∣velation from God. The whole scheme of re∣demption by a crucified Saviour, is and could be brought to light only by that divine discovery in
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>the scriptures; for life and immortality is only brought to light by the gospel.</P>
<P>THESE doctrines, necessary to establish the hap∣piness of all who trust in God through a Redeemer, are contained in the scriptures, and express all that can be accounted amiable and delightful. A dis∣play of all God's moral attributes, with the true way how to imitate them, and how men may be acceptable unto God are clearly displayed and set forth in the scriptures. If revelation contain all that is morally good and graciously free, nothing else can be the only rule to direct us, how we may glorify God and enjoy him for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS will appear if we view some of the spe∣cial doctrines, which are contained in the book of God relating to faith and obedience. God's being reconciled to men through a new method of his own devising, is set before us as the foundation of our faith in the holy oracles: That God was in <HI>Christ</HI> reconciling the world unto himself, not im∣puting their trespasses unto them, is a peculiar doc∣trine of revelation. As all the perfections of God are some way connected with this method of grace and faith, therein is our satisfaction. With that method of God's illustrating his attributes, nothing in matters of a divine faith can be conceived with∣out the bounds of such a system, where the whole grounds of true trust in God is comprehended.</P>
<P>THAT the scriptures comprehend the doctrine of reconciliation by <HI>Jesus</HI> is very plain to every one who read them without prejudice: That all the di∣vine attributes are fully displayed in this scheme is equally clear from scripture. As our faith and confidence cannot warrantably go beyond what God hath revealed to us of himself, in these attributes and relations he hath displayed in the method of re∣conciliation, so this revelation must be profitable
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>for all the grounds of faith: For true faith is only an acceptation of God our Saviour, and a trusting in him according to these relations he stands in to men as revealed in the gospel.</P>
<P>IF therefore all these relations be revealed and o∣pened up in the scriptures, all that is profitable for faith must be so likewise. The doctrine of obedi∣ence is also clearly revealed in the scriptures, both the reason and rule of our obedience are contained there. The rule of our obedience is very clear and plain in the ten commandments of the moral law; these present every rational creature with the purest and exactest rules of conduct. Nothing is con∣tained in these holy mandates but what is good in itself, and tends to the happiness of men. The so∣cial disposition is recommended in the plainest and clearest manner, in the very sum of the law given by the lawgiver himself, <HI>Thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour as thyself. The law of the Lord is perfect,</HI> says the Psalmist. If we view the law of God in its full extent, as comprehending both the rule and reason of our obedience, angels are not yet come to the full degree of obedience, nor never will. But by observing these blessed rules men most resemble the divine nature, and render themselves more ami∣able in the pure eye of the Almighty; for the more of his own image God beholds in the souls of his reasonable creatures, the better he is pleased with them.</P>
<P>THE reasons of our obedience are also revealed in scripture; God is our Lord, and we are command∣ed to worship him: He is our Saviour and we should love him. I said before that angels will never walk up to the reasons of obedience, con∣tained in divine revelation: And indeed unless that a finite nature could render as much love and ser∣vice as an infinite being is capable of, it is impos∣sible
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>they can. But the reasons are weightier on our part; he is not only our creator and bountiful benefactor, but be is also our saviour and redeemer. We have greater expressions of his love to us set down in divine revelation, than even cherubims can boast of. The Psalmist lost himself in meditating upon the reasons of obedience laid down in the word of God, and exemplified in his providence, Psal. cxvi. 12. <HI>What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be continually in my mouth.</HI> Psal. xxxiv. 1. To view all the reasons of the chris∣tian obedience, would be to trace all the instances of divine goodness recorded in scripture, together with all the excellencies of his nature there, beau∣tifully displayed.</P>
<P>IT may not perhaps be unnecessary to explain a little more, particularly what we are to understand by doctrine as here expressed in the text. It may comprehend all that lies within <HI>Timothy</HI>'s commission to teach the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> or what ministers of the gos∣pel in succeeding periods are to instruct sinners in. The depravity of human nature, the inability of falling man to recover himself, are doctrines clearly taught in scripture. This is taught by the prophet <HI>Hosea, O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself! But in me is thy help.</HI> The doctrine of inspiration exposes to view the degeneracy of all men from the truth: For <HI>So∣lomon</HI> tells us, <HI>There is none righteous, no not one;</HI> and the Apostle, <HI>That all flesh have become guilty before God.</HI> Nothing is more insisted upon in holy writ than the imperfection of human nature. Besides this doctrine opens up to sinners the misery of their condition; that they are under the curse, and ex∣posed to divine wrath and indignation. This doc∣trine is plain and free of flattery, it does not speak peace when there is none; it deals openly and free∣ly
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>with men's polluted and miserable state; it sets the glass before them and shews them their picture to the life. The dispensation of free grace through a Saviour, and his righteousness alone for salvation; is clearly opened up in this doctrine of divine in∣spiration. Here it is that we are informed that we are not saved by works of righteousness which we have done, <HI>But according to the divine mercy which is shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</HI> In like manner the renovation of the mind by the grace of the Holy Spirit, is pointed expressly in this divine doctrine. In order to our entering into the kingdom of God we must be born again: For our Saviour tells us, <HI>Unless a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</HI> John iii. 3. Moreover all the means of this great and wonderful work of salvation, are contained, as to their authority, in this heavenly doctrine. The preaching of the gospel, sacraments and prayer, are all doctrinally taught in the scriptures: Not only so, but who are to teach them ministerially, and after what manner is expressly taught in these oracles of truth. By the scriptures we are instructed in all the necessary connexions and distinctions of things and offices: Thereby we come to know what is the divine will concerning every special office and ordi∣nance, how far such an office and ordinance are morally connected. We learn from the holy oracles the moral connexion between preaching the gospel, and the ministerial office, which is but little under∣stood in this place, where every one seems to lay claim to it. It is the mandate of revelation, <HI>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and lo I am with you always unto the end of the world.</HI> The very model and method of teaching is contained in
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>the sacred volumes; the best rules and exactest pattern is found there.</P>
<P>THOSE that would understand the parts and connexon of a sermon, let them study our Savi∣our's sermon upon the mount. It consists of the most concise aphorisms, strong and clear argu∣ments, and warm exhortations: Nothing but so∣lid and sound argument run through the whole of that divine discourse: No flaunty airs, or petulent expressions, are to be found in this heavenly pattern of pulpit eloquence: Every point of truth natu∣rally flow from one another: The stile is strong and manly, yet simple and easy: The figures are homely, yet significant and well adapted: This is the best standard for a method of preaching the gospel; this is a pattern for every christian author to imitate.</P>
<P>IN this divine sermon evident and plain truths are laid down and supported by the justest argu∣ments, and the practice thereof recommended with all the energy of love and true zeal. The con∣nexion between teaching and exhortation is one of the doctrines of divine revelation, and they are recommended to <HI>Timothy</HI> as two branches of the same office and method of teaching, 1 Tim. iv. 13. The same person that has a right publickly to exhort, has the same right to preach and teach publickly, if men keep by scripture connexions. The evangelist <HI>Luke,</HI> chap. iii. 18. joins exhortation and preaching together; <HI>Many other things in his exhortation did he preach un∣to the people.</HI> This rule of righteousness makes no difference between preaching the gospel and exhor∣tation. Some may be better qualified for dischar∣ging one branch of his office than another part of it, but the true connected parts of it can never be
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>lawfully separated. Whoever is better fitted for one part of his office than another, will perhaps incline more after that which suits best his capacity, but it never will be lawful to separate moral con∣nexions. When the Apostle, Rom. xii. 6. says, <HI>Let him that teacheth wait on teaching, and he that exhorteth on exhortation,</HI> he is establishing the dis∣tinction between a doctor and a preacher, in that church which he had settled at <HI>Rome:</HI> He instructs the <HI>Romans</HI> that it was necessary to have seminaries of learning for teaching youth, as well as christian assemblies for worshipping God. He therefore instructs them in this point, that when a man was found qualified for the schools, it was necessary for the sake of Christianity, he should wait on that office; and though he was not divested of his au∣thority to preach the gospel, yet teaching in the schools was to be his peculiar care.</P>
<P>THE word of inspiration in the New Testament joins these two together, preaching of the gospel and exhortation. The word which is used to sig∣nify the one is often used to signify the other, or both. That word is used, 1 Thes. ii. 3. for the gospel itself, <HI>But our exhortation was not of de∣ceit, nor uncleanness, nor of guile, but as we were al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed of God, to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak,</HI> &amp;c. These divine oracles shew us the connexion between all divine ordinances and offices: And here every thing necessary for our faith and obedience is clearly opened up.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 3d. To shew that nothing can be added to these dictates of divine inspiration.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS will appear from the perfection of the scriptures in all the preceding instances. It follows as a natural consequence, that if all things neces∣sary for faith and practice be contained in the scrip∣tures,
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>nothing more can be necessary to found a divine faith and regulate the christian conduct. It is evident that the revealed will of God is designed to lead men to their supreme happiness: For every thing necessary thereto is contained in the sacred pa∣ges. To add thereto in any instance, is to dero∣gate from that only perfection which is worthy the author of such a revelation. That God can give new discoveries to his people, I make no question; and that he may reveal to his church what was hid before from her, I make no doubt; but then all these discoveries must be judged by what is before revealed in the scriptures. Every pretended reve∣lation or inspiration, if not agreeable to the word of God, is mere enthusiasm. If the scripture be not the only standard of faith and practice, there can be no other: For every new inspiration is alto∣gether uncertain, till it be tried by, and compared with, this former one in the holy scriptures. And if the former be compleat, and contain a perfect re∣velation of the will of God to men for their eternal happiness, no new inspiration can according to the nature of the thing be possible; for perfection ex∣cludes all addition.</P>
<P>No new revelation can be supported wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffi∣cient evidence, for it is contrary to the perfect. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the deity, to support with evidence what he has declared unncessary by a compleat system of his will for all the ends and purposes of man's sal∣vation. All pretensions to inspiration, since the canon of the scripture was finished, is only a subtil invention of Satan to discredit the scripture. It would seem, since Satan could not by deductions from the law of nature and reason overturn reve∣lation, he has taken a more plausible shift to under∣mine it by new pretended inspirations. The Al∣mighty does nothing but for sufficient reasons, and
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>all his ways are perfect and uniform like himself; and it could not agree with God's pure and perfect nature to give addition to perfection, or make op∣position to rectitude. <HI>The law of the Lord is per∣fect,</HI> Psal. xix. 7. Upon supposition that the scrip∣tures are a compleat draught of God's revealed will, in order to man's salvation, can any new inspiration be admited without arguing imperfection in that revelation? There can no credit safely be given to the Bible, nor is there any reason why men should depend upon what is contained in it for eternal happiness, if we are still to look for new inspirati∣ons: Nor can we believe God in any other new dis∣covery, when he has declared the scripture a com∣pleat system, and yet is always making new addi∣tions to it.</P>
<P>ALL new discoveries of truth made to the church in after periods, was nothing more but the mean∣ing of the word made more plain, or the spirit's opening the great arcana gradually to believers: A bringing out of this treasure things old and new. The accomplishment of prophecy that was in after∣times better understood, was no new inspiration, but the scripture unfolding itself in the proper time appointed. The various and many effects of the word of God, upon the souls of men since revelati∣on was compleated, was nothing more but the word of the gospel fulfilling its end in converting souls: This was revelation answering its own cha∣racter, and accomplishing that design it was given for. The many conversions effected by the word were not new inspirations, but the Holy Ghost's working by his own instrument, that was formed for that very purpose by a former inspiration. The renovation of the minds of true christians, and their conversion to the faith of Jesus, was a work of the divine spirit by the word of revelation, but was not
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>an inspiration of all these converts, upon whom the spirit by the word wrought a change of nature and manner of life. Conversion is not therefore a di∣vine inspiration, but an effect of it: A glorious work of the spirit, wrought in the soul by means of the word, that is the true gift of inspiration.</P>
<P>INSPIRATION in scripture is never so understood as to signify conversion, but is always used to sig∣nify that impulse of the Holy Spirit, whereby these extraordinary persons that wrote the scriptures were moved and directed. Conversion or regeneration is not such an impulse, but a rational persuasion of the mind to embrace the truth. It is a work that warms the soul with tender feelings of divine love, presenting every truth to the mind in a rational manner. This is an abiding principle, and a rati∣onal work of the divine spirit, but no immediate impulse or afflatus. The word inspiration is but twice used in scripture, and not in such a sense as to signify conversion or regeneration. It is used Job xxxii. 8. to signify the rational soul: <HI>Elihu</HI> is there speaking of what is common to all men, namely reason, and urges that every one in their different situations should improve that reason God had given them, without respect to age or seniority, when a vindication of truth required it. It is mentioned in our text, but signifies that impulse wherewith the sacred amanuenses were moved when they spake and wrote by the immediate command of God. It is derogating from the only sufficiency of the word of God, to establish the need or possibility of any new inspirations: For all that is necessary to conduct men to their supreme happiness and feli∣city, is revealed in the sacred volumes. The spirit now conducts men to happiness, not by immediate inspiration, but by rational persuasion in the use of means.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
<P>THERE is this difference between conversion and inspiration; in the first the Almighty without any address unto men's reason and judgment, inspired them to speak and publish what sometimes they did not understand, love, or chuse, as in the case of <HI>Balaam,</HI> and the High Priest before mentioned; but in conversion, he deals with men, by all the means of intelligence and motives of persuasion.</P>
<P>HE proposes nothing but what he makes them understand, and choose, as reasonable and good. The one is effected by immediate impulse, the o∣ther by rational determination. Conversion is al∣together consistent with human freedom and liber∣ty; and is a persuading, not a forcing, men to serve God: But inspiration has no regard to the will and choice of men; for when the inspired persons were under the influence of inspiration, they could not go beyond the commandment of the Lord: In∣spiration obliged them whether it was their choice or not, to speak and act according to their impulse.</P>
<P>IN this case they were only vehicles, by which the mind of God was revealed to others; in the other case men are the subjects in which the spirit ope∣rates by means of that revelation. They are nei∣ther forced nor compelled to embrace any truth against their will.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT would destroy the supremacy of the scrip∣tures as the only standard of faith and obedience, if any addition could be made to the oracles of God than their standing orthodoxy, as a perfect rule would cease, and of consequence we could have no well grounded confidence in God. If God, as an arbitrary being, could give new revelations contrary to those already given in the scriptures concerning man's salvation, it would not be worthy of credit nor confidence; nay men would be in a worse situ∣ation than if there had never been any revelation at
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>all: For all the evidence that proved the first to be sufficient, by the second is made of no effect; and all former believers must be looked upon as tan∣talized by a mock salvation, contained in an im∣perfect or false revelation.</P>
<P>SINCE the Almighty hath already given us a compleat discovery of all things necessary to be known for our salvation, and hath sealed this system in the most solemn manner, with the most awful cer∣tifications, is it conceivable that he should give new additions, after such a solemn ratification of this perfect rule? All evidence given to any future re∣velation would be unworthy of any regard: The most striking miracles could not give any weight to any man's mission to publish new revelations, nor add authority to his doctrines, unless we could conceive the God of heaven to bear false witness a∣gainst himself, and make the nature of moral truth directly false. God may add new lustre to his word, and make it appear with more evidence to his church, by the assistance of his spirit; but this is no new revelation, but expounding more fully what was before revealed. This is only an improvement of the scriptures to their greater end and design. Any new pretended discoveries in matters of religi∣on, however striking they may seem to be, if they do not exactly agree with the written word of God, they cannot be admitted into our holy religion. There is not now the same necessity for inspiration that was in the days of the prophets and apostles. It was necessary at first to make God's mind known to the world, and afterwards in the New Testament times it was necessary, because it was promised to be continued. The prophets foretold that new discoveries would be made to the church in the New Testament days, Joel ii. 28. Inspiration under the New Testament was necessary for two reasons,
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>till the canon was sealed; first, to fulfil the pro∣phecies, and secondly, to compleat the canon. Our Saviour promised the spirit for this purpose, <HI>If I go away I shall send the Comforter, and he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your re∣membrance.</HI> But when God had done all that he had said he would do in this particular, there was no more need for inspiration. The Old Testament told the church what <HI>Jesus</HI> should be, and do; and the New Testament informs us of the fulfillment of all this<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. There remains now nothing needful either for life or godliness to be revealed, for the two Testaments contain all. The reasons for in∣spiration being now over, it is self superceded. When an infinitely perfect being has given a perfect reve∣lation of his mind and will to his church, and sealed this; and declared it to be the standard of faith and obedience; could he in a consistency with his holy character give any new inspiration, when he hath said, <HI>It is finished, the judge of all the earth must do right.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THIS is evident from the threatnings denoun∣ced against such as add to, or diminish from, the holy oracles. Either the scriptures must be true or false: If true, so must their threatnings be, and it must be presumption to add to these divine dictates. If they are false it should be made appear, by proving their evidence insufficient; the latter has always been attempted without success, and so the former must be the truth. Therefore nothing can be ad∣ded to the scripture without danger of eternal ruin. Any addition supposes imperfection or insufficiency in that which it is added unto, at least some necessary relation of the one to the other, or then the additi∣on is improper, and the union of the parts added unjust. If there be a necessity of additional revelati∣ons or inspirations, the first revelation must, no
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>doubt, labour under some defect; and how unjust must it be in the deity to challenge men into sin, and threaten them with punishment if they look for any addition, or make any, to this imperfect re∣velation? Upon this supposition who can vindicate the moral character of God? Must not every ra∣tional being conclude him to be unjust, and unrea∣sonable, to give them an insufficient revelation of his will, and yet threaten them with the cruelest pu∣nishment for looking for, and seeking after ano∣ther? From all which it is evident, that nothing can be added warrantably to the scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 4th. To shew that all future discoveries in matters of religion, and christian experience, are to be judged by the standard of the word of God.</P>
<P N="1">1st, THIS will appear from the extensive morality of the scriptures, in answering all the ends and pur∣poses of true felicity. There is no possible condi∣tion of life, either prosperous or adverse, but either the rules or comforts of the scriptures may be ap∣plied unto: Neither is there any state of soul that a christian can be in, but something useful to correct or strengthen him therein, may be found in the scriptures. With relation to what we are to believe concerning God in every relation he stands in to us, we are sufficiently informed by the word of God: And nothing is revealed as matter of our faith, but what is perfectly agreeable to the nature of the deity. There is no other certain infallible system our faith can rest sure upon, Should we be left to gather▪ what we are to believe concerning God, from his works and operations, our faith would de∣pend upon the uncertain bottom of human infe∣rence: For though the premises are just, we might err in drawing the conclusion. But when our faith
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>is limited by the divine will, to certain infallible points, it must be founded upon a sure ground and foundation. The only moral ground of a christian faith, is the warrant to believe in the divine com∣mandment; and no more can be accounted faith, morally considered, but what is binding upon us by the will of God in divine revelation.</P>
<P>IT follows, as a native consequence from this, that all future discoveries in matters of faith and experience, must be judged by the scriptures; be∣cause they are the mind and will of God, that ex∣tends to all matters possibly belonging to a divine faith. Neither are their any duties binding upon a reasonable creature, but what may be found in this revelation: What we are to God, our neigh∣bour, and ourselves, is there described and laid out to our view in the clearest manner: Every bene∣volent principle, and that tender regard due to all the human species, are there warmly recommended.</P>
<P>SINCE in the scriptures we have all that is ne∣nessary to constitute men good and happy, as it were summed up, which no where else can be found in so clear and full a light; they must rationally be the judge of all future discoveries in matters of faith and religious experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS may be gathered from the opposition of the depraved nature of man to the divine oracles. There is nothing so opposite to men's irregular passions and appetites, as perfect and exact rules: What therefore is the butt of their opposition, must be something perfect and regular. There are few persons that love to live loosely, but in some degree find fault with the scriptures. Laws and govern∣ment, have in all ages been the eye-sore of the vi∣cious; and that the scriptures are so much despised is an evidence of their standing orthodoxy. Did not the sacred oracles establish a standard of faith
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>and obedience, for what reason could the unbe∣liever, libertine, and vicious find fault with them? Were they imperfect or defective they would be so much the more like themselves, and similarly would beget esteem: But as they are a standing rule of con∣formity to the divine nature, they are so much the more despised by men; who love to live too freely: If not, establish the scriptures as the only rule and standard of faith and practice. Many will admit them as collateral helps along with, either their in∣ward feelings, or darling prejudices; but if you once make them the only rule and standard of our trust, and conduct, they presently are found faulty. Though perhaps a seemingly pious enthusiast will not speak openly against the divine oracles, (which would be too public an evidence of infidelity) yet when he holds in principle and practice, what is directly contrary unto them, it is a proof that he does not admit them as the only sufficient standard of faith and obdience. When there are sundry ex∣press evidences from scripture against his received faith and feeling, if he believe the word of God, he will prefer revelation to imagination and human conceit.</P>
<P>THE fault found with revelation, is not so much that it is deficient, as that it admits of no human inventions contrary to its pure morality; and that it is the only judge of future discoveries in religion, is plain from that fear sinners, and enthusiasts of all sorts, have to undergo a trial by its pure and per∣fect rules and doctrines.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS is evident from express testimony from God himself, Isai. viii. 20. There were at that time many that sought after new revelations and visions, that were diabolical; they went to wiz∣zards and familiar spirits, where they got pretend∣ed revelations. The Lord instructs his people what reply to make to such as wanted to seduce them
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>from the pure ways of truth, into these false and diabolical delusions; to tell them they were to seek unto God: And in order to find out their deceit, to try them by the rule of the word, as in verse 20; <HI>To the law and to the testimony: If they speak not ac∣cording to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</HI> The law and the testimony was the only judge of faith and experience from its very first pro∣mulgation; and it must certainly continue, unless it can be proved that the nature of it is changed. Let men pretend to what inspiration they will, if they cannot shew their agreement with the law and the testimony, the written word of God, they de∣serve no more regard than magical incantations. It is not pretended piety and good meaning, that will authenticate or authorize any new discoveries in religion, otherwise all the heathen oracles might be brought in as coequal with christian institutions: For they were as pious in their superstitions, and more so, than many christians in their worshipping and serving the true God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At pius Aeneas arces, quibus altus Apollo
<L>Praesidet, horrendaeque procul secreta Sibyllae,</L>
<L>Antrum immane, petit; magnam cui mentem animumque</L>
<L>Delius inspirat vates, aperitque-futura.</L>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG. l. 6. v. 9.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. But no christian will certainly believe, that sincere superstition and en∣thusiasm is according to the law and the testimony: If compared with this rule it will be found want∣ing. It is plain that the scriptures are an universal standard of all doctrines, faith and experience, as they belong to the christian religion. Since the holy oracles comprehend all that's necessary to be believed concerning God, every thing that's useful for a religious life, and needful to consummate men's moral character and true felicity, and render them well pleasing in the sight of God, no new system can be received that is not agreeable to this revela∣tion:
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>By this we ought to try our faith and expe∣rience, by the same we are to examine our practice and manner of life. It follows, that men should be well acquainted with the scriptures; read and fre∣quently meditate upon them; pray for the divine blessing upon every application unto them: That by the word of God they may become strong in faith and religious experience, be helpful unto one another, till at last, like the man of God, by the word they be made perfect.</P>
<P>HAVING thus viewed the scriptures as the only rule to direct us how we may glorify God and en∣joy him; as a standard of faith and the only rule of practice: It may be necessary now to shew what improvement we ought to make of this subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. To correct our mistakes, either in matters of belief or conduct. Such as have embraced o∣pinions repugnant to this holy system of religious principles, ought to correct their faith, and lay a∣side that belief that is not founded upon this divine testimony. To believe more in matters of religion than God hath revealed, is equally dangerous with infidelity; for it is so far a discrediting the revealed mind of God in his word, and reflects the charge of insufficiency upon his perfect law.</P>
<P>To found our trust in God upon any concepti∣ons that are not contained in his revealed will, is to build our house upon the sand, and to lay ano∣ther foundation than Jesus hath laid. The scrip∣tures point out the consistency of all the divine at∣tributes in the salvation of sinners; and to found our trust upon any of these attributes, to the dis∣honour of the other branches of his character, is to found our confidence upon what revealed religion hath never pointed out as a true foundation. To found our faith upon the divine goodness, and not take in the idea of justice, truth and holiness, is to have an unworthy notion of God's moral character.
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>Nothing can be truly good that is not just and e∣quitable, pure and spotless. If goodness be consi∣dered as a mere propensity to our happiness, without any respect to the consistency of the divine admini∣stration, it is what God cannot bestow and men need never expect: For he will by no means clear the guilty. Goodness as it respects men's desire of happi∣ness, may be far from being agreeable to God's mo∣ral dispensations; and if our faith be founded upon such a notion of goodness, it very much needs cor∣rection. Nothing is truly good that is not consis∣tant with God's moral character revealed in the scrip∣ture; and if we trust in God as good, in order to sal∣vation, it must be in such a way as takes in all the branches of his moral character revealed in the holy oracles. A true notion of the divine goodness, is that which makes him truly good of himself. To view his goodness as it is a forgiving of our offences, with∣out considering how he can do this consistently with the honour of his character, betrays both want of understanding, and true trust in the Almighty. The apostle tells us that God is just when he justifies the ungodly, so that this goodness they receive from God, comes in the very channel of rectitude and justice. Whoever forms a notion of goodness dis∣tant from truth and justice, and founds their confi∣dence upon it, will meet with a miserable disap∣pointment. Nay, this could not in its own nature be good: For all conceptions of the divine cha∣racter, that afford any ground for our faith and confidence, must be such as make it consistent, otherwise our faith is delusion, and our hope pre∣sumption. Our faith must be such as has a war∣rant in divine revelation, a confidence in a recon∣ciled God, through his son Jesus, in whom mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss one another. True faith is founded upon God's new covenant relations, and our trust in him
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>is fixt upon that mercy our Mediator hath pur∣chased as the head of the new covenant; otherwise our trust is mere deceit, and our faith a fancy.</P>
<P>IT is the Almighty's own description of himself in his word, and not every vain conceit we may have of him, that is the warrant of our belief, and the foundation of our trust. A faith founded upon such an unworthy view of the divine being, as to conceive him only good as he is inclined towards our happiness, will never influence men to an uni∣versal obedience of his law. Considering our pre∣sent imperfect state and situation through sin and corruption, there is need, in order to excite us to a true and universal obedience, to have before our eyes all these means and motives, suitable to awaken our souls from their dead and indifferent condition.</P>
<P>TO view the Almighty as pure, just and holy, as well as good and ready to forgive, will excite the mind to imitate him in these branches of his character; as there can be no communion with him without being like him. The obedience of every christian, will be in proportion to their faith in the Almighty; and their imitation of the attributes of his nature, will only extend as far as they under∣stand and believe them. It would destroy the no∣tion of true goodness, to conceive of a happiness that did not comprehend a conformity to God in all his revealed moral chracter. To imagine that the Deity is such a good-natured being, as to give up truth and equity for the sake of our happiness, and so forgive sin without reparation to his justice, and honour to his law, suitable for the offence given, and repentance on the sinner's part, is to trust him for what is contrary to his nature to be∣stow.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, the method and means of sal∣vation are of his own contriving, and freely revealed to, and bestowed upon his people; but both the plan
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>and the prosecution thereof are consistent with his revealed character. Our faith in Jesus must be according to that method he hath given to us in his word; where every attribute of the divine na∣ture is displayed to the highest degree and advan∣tage: We must rule our notions of the divine Be∣ing, according to these most plain descriptions he hath given of himself in revelation; and not bring these descriptions down to the standard of our im∣perfect capacities. To conclude that the Almighty would have a fairer character if adorned with other attributes, or if he exercised his perfections in ano∣ther manner, when we can already easily see the meaning of his own description in the sacred oracles, is to form a deity to ourselves, that revelation is ignorant of, and to seek another God than the only true God. Men ought to correct their petulent fancies, and their enterprizing imaginations, by this rule, of which it is said that it is perfect: <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect,</HI> Psal. xix. 7. That faith fiction, that trusts a God for is no more than salvation, that is a creature of fancy, and does not credit the true God upon his own testimony.</P>
<P>ALL pretensions to assurance, and hope of hea∣ven, that is not specially founded upon scripture re∣cord, is a false confidence, and will end in bitter∣ness and sorrow. The scriptures are profitable for our correction in this point; let us then place no trust and confidence in the almighty that his own word does not warrant and authorize, otherwise our confidence will forsake us when we need it most, and our hope perish with that of the hypocrite. The scriptures are also profitable to correct the er∣rors of our conduct, and manner of life. When men fall into immoralities, which are both offen∣sive to God, and opposite to our true interest, they are not left to search out their errors by the means of human prudence, or to reform according to the
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>dictates of fancy and conceit; but the word of God is the light by which they are to search them, and the rule by which they are to correct them. It was by the written law that good king <HI>Josiah</HI> found out the fins and immoralities of <HI>Judah;</HI> and by the same he conducted the whole of that reformation he so happily brought about. By this the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> came to know sin, and learn righteousness, to cor∣rect his judgment and amend his life: By the law of God his inward sentiments and public profession were corrected. And all men that would rightly amend their abuses, either in matters of faith or praictce, must improve the divine oracles as the rule of their correction.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE scripture is of use to correct our hopes and expectations. Men are ready to extend their hopes beyond their just bounds, and to hope farther than the Almighty gives any ground; expect things that are inconsistent with the divine nature to bestow. When a luxuriant imagination found the expectation of happiness upon a confused no∣tion of inconnected objects, joining in the notion of felicity things that never were nor can be uni∣ted, under a shew of hope they support themselves by arrogant presumption. To hope for forgive∣ness because God is merciful, when repentance is not taken into the idea and notion of hope, or to expect that God will pardon men's sins when they live in the practice of them, is to make a false connexion of ideas, and consequently a false and counterfeit hope. The scripture account of the christian hope, is far different from such a ground∣less expectation; he that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure. Purity and solid hope are inseparably joined together in scrip∣ture, and the believer's hope will be more or less strong, as he advances in purity, or is defiled with sin. There is no connexion between divine mercy
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>and sin to make a sinner hope for happiness, when he daily abuses the goodness of the Almighty.</P>
<P>THE sinner that hopes in the mercy of God, and lives in the love and practice of sin, necessarily con∣nects in his hope pure and holy mercy with sin, the enemy of the divine nature; and therefore his hope can never be solid, however pleasing in the mean time: For the scripture description of hope is that it is pure: He that hath it, purifieth himself. True hope is founded upon truth; upon the holy oracles of God, Heb. vi. 18. whereby it is impossi∣ble for him to lie; and no expectation that is not founded in truth will ever be fulfilled, but meet with disappointment. The God of truth hath as∣sured us, that such only shall find mercy as forsake sin: To hope for mercy any other way is not ac∣cording to God's revealed will, but is a presuming upon his goodness without the least foundation. The law and testimony is the rule for correcting such mistakes, in the matter of our future expecta∣tions of happiness; and such as build their hopes upon any other foundation but upon the written word of God, will find it the hope of the hypocrite that will perish.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE should improve the scriptures, to en∣crease our love to God and all men. The gospel recomends love as the most shining branch of the christian character: It is even the very sum of mo∣ral perfection: The highest perfection our nature is capable of, either in this life or that which is to come. This duty is the universal breath of divine revelation. The mutual love between <HI>Christ</HI> and believers, is beautifully described in many passages of sacred writ: Particularly in the <HI>Song of Solomon,</HI> and the 45 <HI>Psalm,</HI> and set down for our imitation. When we read of the saints love to God, and their communion with him, let us improve this to in∣crease our love and regard to the Almighty, and
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>to that Saviour that loved us and gave himself for us. When we collate the mutual love of the saints among themselves, let us improve this as a mean to raise our love and esteem of all good men. The love of <HI>Jesus</HI> to his friends and enemies, is lively described through the whole history of his life in the Evangelists: Let us then imitate this blessed example, and follow <HI>Jesus</HI> in doing good to all. The scriptures teach us impartiality in our love to our fellow-christians, and inforce universal bene∣volence to all that bear the same image.</P>
<P>WHATEVER different persuasions men may have, arising from the different views they have of truth, yet this is no reason why we should remove our affections from them, or deprive them of our love: The word of God authorizes no such practice, but obliges us to love all men, especially all the hous∣hold of faith. Our love and esteem of others is not to be founded upon their similitude to us in their persuasion and experience, but upon what is their just merit in themselves, as lovers of God and truth, as they are able to understand them. Men that only love their fellow-christians as they can read their own principles and experience in them, do not esteem them for their merit, but for what of themselves they see in them: Hereby they make their own experience the rule of their esteem, and not the command of their Lord and master, who says, <HI>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another.</HI> It is indeed the me∣lancholy evil of our times, that the word of God is not so much improved, to find out what is vir∣tuous, amiable and lovely in our fellow-christians, as to search out their faults and squeeze their reputa∣tions, as if none were to be loved but such as are perfect. The most part where they spy one fault, they can bestow no love. Moral precepts that especially bind us to love one another, are sinfully applied to all our neighbours faults we can discern,
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>exclusive of all their virtues. How unreasonable is it to think that all men should see alike, in mat∣ters of religion, when neither their tempers, edu∣cation, nor advantages are the same. To have a bad opinion of all who differ from us, and restrain our love and affections from them, because they believe more or less than we do, is just as rea∣sonable as to hate our brother because he could not eat the same food, because his stomach could not digest it. The many unlawful distinctions that are kept up among the ordinary professors of religion, arise from their not improving the benevolent prin∣ciples that are so much inculcated in divine revela∣tion. From the same source proceed these un∣charitable sentiments, that the different parties have of one another. Though perhaps we cannot agree with others in their sentiments, of certain points and principles, more than we could digest food they could live upon; yet no man ought to deprive his brother of that love due to him, nor hate him for his way of thinking: He deserves love and esteem, though he may be weaker or stronger than the rest of his brethren. It is inconsistent with that love and generosity the scripture records, to think evil of our brethren because they cannot go all the lengths that we ourselves can go. It may as well be sup∣posed that men shall be of one size, as that they shall agree in every article of religion: And if we cannot love or do good to any but such as answer our measure, our regard is not so extensive as the word of God requires it to be; for it commands us even to love our enemies. To improve the scriptures right, for the end of encreasing our love to God and men, let us view every thing that is amiable in the divine nature, as therein described, and every thing in men that bears a resemblance to this: Not to overlook the virtues of our fellow-christians, because they are not so perfect as we
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>might expect, but love in them whatsoever is like the Author of perfection. And as the scriptures urge the practice of acts of kindness, the true fruits of love and regard, let us not withhold these when it is in our power to perform them, from a spirit of partiality to party and sect. It is not a well di∣rected love that operates the way of partiality. A worthy object is not less amiable, because it may be opposite to something we esteem; yea though our interest in some cases may stand in the way of our beneficence, we must go over it to express our love to a worthy object. Though a person, for some reasons we know not, may be our enemy, (if in other respects he is valuable) we are to love him and serve his interest. It is the command of the great Lawgiver, <HI>If thine enemy be hungry, give him meat; if he is thirsty, give him drink.</HI> It is an evidence the scriptures are neither rightly understood nor improved by such, who instead of love and bene∣volence, constantly practise hatred, malice and en∣vy: Instead of wishing well to all men or any man, they belch out scandal and reproach against every one, and would establish their own interest upon the ruin of every character: Let such remember, they act contrary to the holy oracles of God, and the whole amiable draughts of the divine nature that are drawn there, and instead of imitating God, imi∣tate him, of whom it is justly said, <HI>He is a liar, and the father of it.</HI> Let them cultivate a better ac∣quaintance with the scriptures, correct their errors thereby, and encrease their love therewith: For, <HI>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude this subject with laying down a few rules, for using and improving the scriptures, for all the aforesaid purposes.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 1. READ the scriptures without prejudice
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>in favour of any received opinion. It is the truth of the sacred oracles themselves, that ought to re∣commend them to our esteem, and not their suitable∣ness to some points we may unjustly set a value upon. Our enquiry into the holy oracles must be free, if it be right, and not fettered with prejudices that will darken the evidence of scripture witness. It is injustice done divine revelation, only willingly to admit its evidence when it is most favourable to our sentiments: This is to make our own opinion a standard for revelation, and not the scripture the rule of our opinion. Hereby men lose the advan∣tage of divine instruction, and remain wilfully ig∣norant, by being determined beforehand what evi∣dence they will admit. Whatever reverence men may pay to churches, or fathers, or traditions re∣ceived from them, a greater respect is due to the Father of spirits, and the King of the catholic church: Our first received opinions are very ready to need correction, if not a total abolition; and perfectest views of truth we can have in this life, will need assistance from revelation: We should therefore leave our eyes open to the light of divine revelation, and willingly admit scripture evidence, and not shut them against the light, by imagining we are perfect. It is either pride or shame, or both, that hinders men from parting with received notions when they see the scripture against them. Men are so ready to value their former pains and labour that they have been at in attaining to their first opinions, that it is a great mortification to them to be obliged to confess they have err'd. Pride and a foolish bashfulness arising therefrom, hinder many from acknowledging what scripture and conscience informs them is true. If we would receive true benefit from the word of God, we must read it with an open heart, and lay aside our pre∣judices in favour of any thing else that may dar∣ken
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>its evidence or hinder its reception into our hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 2. SEEK for the meaning of what seems more obscure, by comparing it with what is more simple and plain. When any truth is conveyed in a figure that is not evident at first view, the mean∣ing that makes the scope consistent, and conveys the clearest views of the divine character, and the sim∣plest notions of religion, is likeliest to be the mind of the spirit of God. For example, when <HI>Christ</HI> says, <HI>I am the bread of life, and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him;</HI> he teaches his disciples in a figure, that he was the substance pointed out by the manna of old, and that those that believed in him should enjoy spiritual and eternal life: By the figure of eating his flesh and drinking his blood, he points out the communion that believers have with him by faith: That those who believed his death and resurrection should enjoy communion with him: That he would love them and they him, which he calls a∣biding in them, and they in him. He would abide in them by grace, and they should abide in his service and the profession of his faith. This is a∣greeable with the scope of the place and many other plain simple texts of scripture; such as <HI>He that be∣lieveth shall be saved; I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes.</HI> Moreover in comparing of idioms we are to be careful not to receive more into our present meaning, than the author of scripture designed to convey. When we find the idiom of scripture different from what is of use among us, we must search diligently for plain and simple passages of scripture, which tend to ex∣plain the meaning and clear the idiom; and when we find what truth the idiom conveys in our lan∣guage, and according to our customs, we are to rest there till better informed. When by compari∣son
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>we have found what such idioms taught, in the language of scripture in these times, we will more easily understand how to apply them to our own cir∣cumstances and times. For example, when it is said <HI>Christ was made sin for us;</HI> this idiom represents <HI>Christ</HI> in not a very favourable point of view, and like∣wise issues in a contradiction, <HI>Who knew no sin.</HI> But if we consider the difference of idiom, we will find that he was made a sin-offering for us, or as the apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> expresses it, <HI>He offered him∣self once for our sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 3. READ the scriptures, and improve them with fervent prayer and devotion. Let your minds be filled with holy reverence of God, as the author of scripture, and beg his assistance to make you un∣derstand them. Say with <HI>David,</HI> Psal. cix. 18. <HI>Open thou mine eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy law.</HI> It is not sufficient to read the word of God with judgment and care, but we should also read it with reverence and godly fear. Endeavour to have our hearts quickened and our affections enlivened there∣by, that we may not only become wiser by under∣standing its truths, but better by making a suitable improvement of them. To be accurate in search∣ing for the meaning of the word of God, and not earnest and desirous to do the duties therein con∣tained, may exalt men's pride, but will never bet∣ter their morals, nor reform their hearts. Those that would reap advantage by the scriptures must, with all humility and godly fear, beg the divine assistance to enable them to come to the knowlege of the truth, and make them live according to that knowlege: otherwise they may read the book of God all their lifetime, and have a transforming view of its author, nor taste of its sweets and comforts. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> could say, <HI>Thy word was found of me, and I did eat it; it was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.</HI> The perusing the sacred records, spiritual
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>concern and devotion, is only paying them the compliment of romance or history, making them rather an amusement than a divine entertainment to the soul: It is but the practice of too many, that are no novices in literal knowledge of the scrip∣tures, to neglect to improve them for warming of their hearts. Though they contain glad tidings of great joy to all people, there are but few that im∣prove them to raise their esteem of the Almighty, and to set their affections upon things above.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 4. Meditate upon the scriptures; consider their nature, end, and properties. Like the godly man the <HI>Psalmist</HI> speaks of, <HI>Meditate upon the law of the Lord day and night.</HI> By considering the na∣ture of the word we will see the beautiful draughts of the divine character therein displayed; by medi∣tating upon its end and design, we will learn the wisdom of its author, in the various fulfillment of his designs and purposes: By seriously attending to its various properties, we will see a beautiful vari∣ety, all centering in a pure and universal whole: By meditation and due consideration of the scrip∣tures, we may from known truths come to see more of their beauty and excellency; and from the knowledge of one truth, come by degrees to the understanding of more. Meditation enlarges the mind for the reception of truth, and also encreases the desire for new investigations. It will raise our esteem of the scriptures and their author, to medi∣tate frequently upon them; and by viewing the glories thereof, we will be ready to be charmed with their excellency. Meditation upon the oracles of God, will make it habitual to our souls to keep up communion with God thereby: In this exer∣cise the serious soul will find joy, and be made to say with the <HI>Psalmist, I rejoice at thy word as one who hath found great spoil.</HI> The holy rules therein contained, will be a joyful path of righteousness, in
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>which the soul will love to walk: The gracious promises therein exhibited, will be springs of com∣fort to the mind in all difficulties. Meditation will place all these in their due order, and regularly use them for their various ends of improvement.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 5. BEWARE of turning scripture into en∣thusiasm. True devotion fills the mind with rati∣onal delight in the word of God, and creates a joy that is lasting and permanent. This is opposed un∣to the joy of the hypocrite, that is like the crack∣ling of thorns under a pot. The true christian's joy and delight in God's word, arises more from its truth and goodness, than from the inward seelings that arise therefrom. This is well expressed by the prophet <HI>Habakuk, Though the fig-tree should not blos∣som, and there should be no fruit found in the vine, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and be glad in the God of my salvation.</HI></P>
<P>THE persuasion of the truth of the divine pro∣mise, will cause the true fearer of God to rejoice when the inward sense and feeling is not so lively experi∣enced. The grounds of true devotion are without men and not within them: If we be only devout when we feel such and such impressions upon our minds, some inward motions stirring within us, our devotion will be very inconstant; which should be always in exercise: That a person's hope may be as sure, his confidence as well grounded, and his devotion as true, that rationally credits the divine testimony, as he who will boast of raptures of soul and extasies of delight. Enthusiasts, like foolish children who find a bill or sum of money, are trans∣ported at the sight of the sum, and cry they are rich and encreased with goods, when the original proprietor will cause them make restitution: But the devout saint founds his joy upon his right, more than upon his present enjoyment, and can say, <HI>My God will supply all my wants: I surely shall be satis∣fied
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>with thy abundant goodness.</HI> There is ordinarily this difference between enthusiasm and true devo∣tion; the first is more taken up with what it re∣ceives, and what inward motions are felt, than con∣templating the large prospect exhibited in the pro∣mises of God: The latter makes one thankfull for every manifestation, but at the same time makes him forget the things that are behind, and press forward towards more discoveries of divine love and favour. True devotion, as taught in the scrip∣ture, makes men more generous, loving, chari∣table, and kind; it opens the heart and unfolds the generous sentiments of the soul. Enthusiasm makes men more narrow spirited, uncharitable, censorious, and bigoted: <HI>Lord, I thank thee I am not as other men,</HI> is the language of their heart, and often of their tongue and conduct: But a truly devout soul speaks and acts with humility: <HI>I am less than the least of all saints, than the least of all thy mercies.</HI> The truly devout person carefully observes all divine scripture connexions, and judges of the ideas by the warrant for them in divine revelation. When they are not connected with a moral warrant in the word of God, they are rejected as impertinent, and looked upon as a delusion: But the enthusiast em∣braces all ideas of pleasing, without considering their connexion with the objects they seem to represent. Many dream pleasantly all their life, who meet with a dreadful awakening in the end, when God sets the just connexion of things before their eyes. Like men in a dream, that please themselves with eating and drinking, but when they awake, behold it is a dream. When we read or hear the word, we should be careful that our devotion take in ob∣jects according to their true nature and design, and improve them only for the purposes they were in∣tended; that we may grow wiser and better by all
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>the dictates of divine inspiration: <HI>For all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and instruction in righteousness.</HI></P>

<P>There shall be a Root of Jesse, which shall stand for an Ensign of the People; to it shall the Gentiles seek, and his Rest shall be glorious.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>REAT and glorious things are spoken of the church in the New Testament times, and excellent things anent the increase of the Mediator's kingdom in that pe∣riod. His appearances for his church have been always remarkable; but under the reign and go∣vernment of the Messiah, the splendor and majesty of the divine glory hath been most conspicuous and eminent. The greater manifestation of divine mercy and grace have been referred to the gospel times. The promises made to the church, seem to have a brighter view towards the latter days than in the first periods of the church. From the be∣ginning of this chapter we have a notable promise of <HI>Christ,</HI> and peace to the church, down to the words of the text: Here we have the time speci∣fied when this should happen, and what figure the Redeemer should make in that remarkable day. Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is here called a root of <HI>Jesse,</HI> because till now he was hid from the world, as a root below ground, but now sprung up like a flourishing branch. When our Lord and Saviour appeared in this world, he was accounted by his
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>country men, the <HI>Jews,</HI> as a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor comeliness to them. As sprung from <HI>Jesse,</HI> he is called a root from him. It is promised, <HI>He shall be an ensign of the people; and the Gentiles shall seek after him, and his rest shall be glorious.</HI> The expressions are figurative, point∣ing out the glory, peace, and splendor of the church, under <HI>Christ</HI>'s power and government, and his eminence in the whole of her salvation. <HI>Moses</HI> was an eminent type of <HI>Christ</HI> when he entered into the tabernacle, for the glory of the Lord appeared then in great majesty: So when <HI>Christ</HI> entered the tabernacle of man's nature, the glory of the Lord appeared by the ministry of angels to the shep∣herds, and at his baptism by a voice from heaven, and afterwards shined forth in a very glorious man∣ner upon mount <HI>Tabor</HI> at his transfiguration.</P>
<P>BY rest is here meant the place of rest, as the temple and tabernacle are called God's rest, Psal. cxxxii. 14. <HI>This is my rest, here will I stay, for I have desired it:</HI> So <HI>Christ</HI> rests in his church according to his gracious presence, and displays the glory or his grace and goodness. The words teach us, that in the days of the gospel, <HI>Christ,</HI> as Lord and King or his church, shall gather a numerous people to himself, and establish a glorious and peaceable government among them; <HI>In that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN further discoursing from these words I pro∣pose,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To consider <HI>Christ's</HI> character as here ex∣press'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The blessings of his government here promised. Lastly, Improve the subject.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE first thing was, to consider our Redeemer's character as here expressed.</P>
<P N="1">1. I SHALL consider how, and to whom he bears this character: It is a metaphorical way of speak∣ing, taken from armies, and military order: As all listed soldiers are obliged to follow their standard-bearer
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>and ensign; so every soldier of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> must and will follow <HI>Christ</HI> and his cause. 1. <HI>Christ</HI> is an ensign by divine commission and appointment. He hath the Father's commission to this office. The glorious Leader of the saints did not enter upon his office without authority: He was no intruder, so he tells us, <HI>He was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</HI> Had our Mediator taken upon him this office, without authority and commission, he would have been an usurper, and would have had no authority nor security for acceptance of his work, nor any re∣ward for it when finished. He was not like the false <HI>Christs</HI> that came before him, that were thieves and robbers; but he came from the father as his commissioned and sent servant. <HI>I am not alone,</HI> says he, <HI>but the Father that sent me is with me.</HI> That <HI>Christ</HI> was to be the ensign of the people he must have his commission sealed; and it is sealed with his Father's oath, <HI>I have sworn,</HI> says God, <HI>and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever. Christ</HI> as en∣sign of his church is King thereof; his standard is that of a King. His character as Ensign respects the evidence of his power; his character as king respects the authority with which he is invested: This authority he receives from the Father, as him∣self witnesseth, John xiv. 31. <HI>As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.</HI> So he acknowledges as his servant, <HI>Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified,</HI> Isa. xlix. 3. And in all the prophecies of him, and promises anent him, he is set forth as one having authority and a divine com∣mission, as one having a command and rule; for, says God, <HI>I have given him as a leader and com∣mander to the people,</HI> Isa. lv. 9. Our ensign rules by a royal warrant and power; he took not this to himself, but acts as the Father's servant; and as our Mediator he bears this character through the
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>whole of the Old Testament. <HI>Christ</HI> hath his com∣mission confirmed two ways, by writ and by oath: He says, Psal. xl. 6.7, <HI>In the volume of thy book it is written of me.</HI></P>
<P>THE scriptures of the Old and New Testament are a volume where <HI>Christ</HI>'s commission is contain∣ed, where his authority as ensign of the church is declared. The sacrifices, types and figures, all pointed at <HI>Jesus,</HI> as one having authority from God, to discharge this commission. The prophecies fore∣told that he would be such a person; the promises secured this; <HI>Behold a king shall reign in righteous∣ness,</HI> says the prophet, and says the Lord, <HI>I will bring forth my servant the Branch,</HI> Zech. iii. 8. The very first promise of the gospel pointed out <HI>Christ</HI> as one having authority, <HI>he shall bruise thy head.</HI></P>
<P>HE hath his commission also by solemn oath; <HI>By two immutable things whereby it is impossible for God to lie,</HI> that we might have strong consolation he hath confirmed it by his oath: And speaking of <HI>Christ</HI>'s kingly commission as a Mediator, Psal. cx. 4. he says, <HI>The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent;</HI> that <HI>Christ</HI> was to be governor and leader of his church: The Father gave him the surest ground to rest upon, for the acceptance of his service and as∣sistance in his work: For this reason he hath sealed his commission by writing and oath. This also is a sure ground of christian comfort in time of trial.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christ</HI> is the ensign of the people by consecra∣tion: He was consecrated to this office in the most solemn manner: He was anointed to this office by the Holy Spirit, Psal. lxxxix. 20. <HI>I have found out David my servant: With my holy oil have I anointed him.</HI> As the ensign of the church he received the spirit without measure: Hence, says the church, Psal. xlv. 7. <HI>God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. Jesus Christ</HI> as God, could receive no addition of spiritual unction, because he
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>was possessed of eternal fullness; but as the king of his church, and the leader of his people, he was qualified with a holy unction. This comprehends all his mediatory qualifications. In order that <HI>Christ</HI> should be the king and lawgiver of his church, it was necessary that the Spirit of the Lord should rest upon him, as in the second verse of this chapter where our text lies. Hereby he was made of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord. That his government might be a righteous government, it was necessary he should be filled with the spirit of righteousness: That he might fill all the vessels of his Father's house, it was necessary that in him all fullness should dwell. Moreover, <HI>Christ's</HI> human nature was consecrated with a special consecration. That he might be holy, harmless, undefiled, and se∣parated from sinners, it was necessary that his relati∣on to men should not make him impure as they were. Had he not been pure, and holy, and consecrated as to his human nature, he could not have been an ensign of holiness. The stately troops of kings and priests that follow this glorious ensign, must be conformable to him in holiness; and when he leads them it is in the ways of holiness. Had he not been consecrated by a holy divine unction, he could not have been free of that pollution that was com∣mon to all the posterity of <HI>Adam.</HI> That his human nature might be free of all impurity, it was sanc∣tified by the Holy Ghost; this is witnessed by the angels to <HI>Mary,</HI> Luke i. 35. <HI>The power of the High∣est shall come upon thee; and the holy Thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God. Christ</HI> that he might be the only ensign of God to men, whom they ought to follow as their guide to glory, was consecrated in a threefold character, of prophet, priest, and king. His standard bears a relation to every branch of his character. The design of a standard-bearer is to lead, to save, and conquer:
<PB N="50" REF="54"/><HI>Christ</HI> was anointed for all these purposes. That he might instruct and lead his followers in the ways of truth, he must be a prophet, and consecrated for that purpose. There were only three degrees of dignity under the Old Testament, for which it was necessary to consecrate the persons invested with it, by anointing them with oil, viz. prophets, priests, and kings. <HI>Christ</HI> was anointed in all these three characters, as worthy of the dignity thereby con∣ferred upon him, Psal. ii. 6. <HI>I have set my king up∣on my holy hill of Zion, with my holy oil have I a∣nointed him.</HI> He hath given him to be a light to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and placed him a prince upon his thrones, consecrated him in all these offices.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Christ</HI> as the ensign of the people, must work out their salvation: This he must do by price as well as by power; and for this reason he must be a priest as well as a king, and a suffering Saviour According to the tenor of the covenant of grace, there was a price of redemption that our Redeemer <HI>Christ</HI> engaged to pay; a purchase he was to make of those that were given him of the Father, <HI>When he shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed.</HI> His offering himself as our High Priest, a sacrifice for our sins, was a payment of that ransom price he engaged to pay. To com∣pleat our salvation, it was necessary he should also be a king; and for this end came he into the world, that he might also subdue all his and our enemies. The fulfilling of this character in our text is a com∣pleating of the conquest over sin and Satan, that was promised, Psal. cx. 6. <HI>He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies: he shall wound the heads over many countries.</HI> For these purposes he was consecrated, that he might answer his character as the ensign of the church.</P>
<P N="3">3. CHRIST is an ensign by his own choice, and his peoples' consent. He willingly undertook this
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>office: When none among angels nor men could be found to save and lead the ruined posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> our Redeemer says, <HI>Lo I come, in the vo∣lume of thy book it is written of me.</HI> With great chearfulness did our Redeemer embrace the office of a Saviour of his people. When he entered upon the execution of it, with what chearfulness and satisfaction did he fulfil the duties belonging there∣to. <HI>I have,</HI> says he, <HI>a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished?</HI> He set his face to go up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with great ear∣nestness and concern: It was as his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly Father. He was free and voluntary; none could oblige him to engage on such an undertaking. He laid down his life for his sheep, which none could take from him: For he says, <HI>I have power to lay down my life, and power to take it up again.</HI> It was his own choice to be en∣sign of his people, and for this reason he submitted to death itself, as an evidence of his great delight in his choice. Before he could raise up a standard of triumph, he must first engage to approach an ab∣solute God alone; <HI>Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, saith the Lord?</HI> Jer. xxx. 21. And the Redeemer himself says, Isa. lxiii. 3. <HI>I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of all the people there was none to help me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT he is also ensign of the nations by the people's consent, Psal. cx. 3. <HI>Thy people shall be wil∣ling in the day of thy power.</HI> Though men by na∣ture are enemies to God by wicked works, yet in the day of <HI>Christ</HI>'s power they are made willing; they leave all and follow him, like his disciples whom he chose in the days of his flesh. They consent to be governed by his laws, and delight in him as their law giver. Though in their uncon∣verted state they might be ready to say, we will not have this man to rule over us, yet in the day
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>of espousals and union to <HI>Jesus,</HI> they change their language, they say, <HI>The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, he is our king and will save us.</HI> The laws of <HI>Christ</HI> are their study, they account his yoke easy, and his burden light, and delight in the law of God after the inward man. His cross is also their glory; like the Apostle, they say, <HI>God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</HI> Gal. vi. 14. They make choice of his statutes as the men of their right hand, and pray that they may keep them; with holy <HI>David</HI> they say, <HI>Incline my heart to keep thy law.</HI> The paths of righteousness are their chief delight, <HI>I will run the ways of thy commandments, when thou hast en∣larged my steps,</HI> says the <HI>Psalmist.</HI> The ordinances of God are their choice above all things, and they love the place where his honour dwells: They re∣joice when it is said unto them, <HI>Go up into the house of the Lord: Their hearts pant as the hart for the water brooks; and a day in God's court is better than a thousand elsewhere.</HI> Like <HI>David</HI> they will even en∣vy the swallows and sparrows that lodge in the sanctuary, when they cannot enjoy communion with <HI>Christ</HI> there.</P>
<P>THE promises of the covenant (of which <HI>Christ</HI> is Mediator) are their choice, for comfort in their affliction, and reasons of triumph in their enlarge∣ment. In their sorrowful moments, <HI>they draw wa∣ter with joy out of these walls of salvation,</HI> Isa. xii. 2, 3. and suck comfort from these breasts of consola∣tion. A true saint can enjoy more comfort in a promise of the new covenant, than the worldly can from his corn, his wine, and oil: They can hope when their tribulation abounds, and say with the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal. cxix. 49, 51. <HI>In all my straits I am revived by thy word alone.</HI> When one disappoint∣ment succeeds another, and temptation after tempta∣tion
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>make them fall; yet they can say, <HI>One thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. Though I fall, I shall arise; though I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.</HI> The remembrance of his faithfulness in former experi∣ences, makes them rest in hope of the full fruition of all grace and glory with God for ever. More∣over, they chuse his people for their companions in the house of their pilgrimage; the society of good men they love and delight in: Whoever attends <HI>Christ</HI>'s standard, they love to follow. The poor followers of <HI>Jesus</HI> will afford them more satisfaction, than the society of princes or ministers of state, of an opposite character.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST bears his character by proclamation. He is proclaimed king in the church, his kingdom in the most visible manner. He is proclaimed in heaven, and proclaimed on earth. All the glori∣fied saints in heaven proclaim him ensign of the people, <HI>Thou art worthy to receive glory, honour, and praise.</HI> The hallelujahs about the throne, are so many proclamations to the glory and praise of the Redeemer as the ensign of his people. Though we have but very faint conceptions of the manner of <HI>Christ</HI>'s being proclaimed in heaven, in this our imperfect state, yet it is a truth, that all the heaven∣ly host proclaim him ensign of the nations. King of saints and king of nations, are striking accents of their proclamation. In this proclamation all the heavenly host are employed; there are no specta∣tors there. The elders cast down their crowns at his feet and cry, <HI>Thou art worthy, for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood. Christ</HI> is proclaimed here by universal consent: Angels join with the saints in this glorious work. An evidence of this we have, in their readiness to proclaim him upon earth, when he came to the world as the en∣sign
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>of the nations. These ministering spirits bring down the language of heaven to this world, and teach the militant church the manner of <HI>Christ</HI>'s proclamation.</P>
<P>JESUS is also proclaimed on earth. The angels brought down a copy of the proclamation to the shepherds, <HI>Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and good-will towards men,</HI> is the substance of this proclamation. The Apostles and ministers of <HI>Jesus,</HI> have carried on this proclamation ever since: <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> was the first New Testament herald that took up this proclamation; he proclaimed him <HI>as the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.</HI> The gospel is nothing but a proclamation of <HI>Jesus</HI> as the ensign of the people. Those who publish any other, in the gospel proclamation, but <HI>Christ,</HI> neither follow the copy of the angels, nor the practice of the triumphant church. <HI>Christ,</HI> as the glorious ensign of the people, exhausts all the proclamations in heaven, and should fill up all these upon earth. <HI>Christ</HI> in the gospel is proclaimed king and ensign, in his grace and fullness, his power and glory. The gospel is a proclamation of good and glad tidings to sinners, and it is only so, as far as <HI>Christ</HI> the ensign of the church is the substance of it. The gospel proclaims <HI>Christ</HI> as an ensign that liberates the captive, and sets free the prisoner, Isai. lxi. 1. This might bring us more par∣ticularly to consider, to whom he bears this cha∣racter. I have through the whole of this discourse viewed him as the ensign of his church; but it may be necessary to consider, what period of it our text more especially refers to, and what people this office views more immediately.</P>
<P>IT is the Gentile church, more especially, that <HI>Christ</HI> bears this relation to. This will appear if we consider the name given to the Gentile church; she is called the christian church, and that because
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>the members of it have enlisted themselves under <HI>Christ</HI>'s banner; because they acknowledge <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the Lord and King of his church. When the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> first set up the New Testament church, his name was the standard they adhered to: His name was the test what opinion men were of, whe∣ther Heathen, Jew, or Christian. Those that owned the name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the Saviour of the world, were called christians, or members of the christian church. The name of <HI>Christ</HI> was the standard to gather people to his cause, and it was promised that the gathering of the people should be to him under the name of Shiloh. The Gentiles when they first left paganism, were received in the christian church by acknowledging the name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the name whereby men only could be saved. So the christi∣ans, in the first days of christianity, had <HI>Christ</HI>'s name written upon their colours, when they went out to war against the heathens; and none were re∣ceived into their armies that did not own and ac∣knowledge that name.</P>
<P>THIS was a very eminent fulfilment of the pro∣mise in our text, <HI>That he should stand as the ensign of the people.</HI> The name of <HI>Christ</HI> was the ensign of christians in that period, and a literal fulfilment of this promise. This was the first period our text re∣fers to, and it is remarkable what progress <HI>Christ</HI>'s standard made in that period: <HI>The little cloud like a man's hand, soon became great and covered the hea∣vens: The handful of corn on the top of the mountain, soon became like prosperous fruit: Like trees on Le∣banon.</HI> How admirable was it for a few fishermen publishing the name of their deceased master, so to propagate christianity, that in a few centuries the christian name made no small part in the public speculations and interests of men. The name of <HI>Christ,</HI> as the ensign of the people, was the stan∣dard in the period of persecution. The name of
<PB N="56" REF="60"/><HI>Christ</HI> was then the standard, under which the church sealed her testimony with her blood. In this period he was a bloody ensign; his garments were stained with blood. Those who adhered to the name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> suffered the most cruel barbarities; and his name was every where spoken against.</P>
<P>BUT even at this time the witnesses of <HI>Jesus,</HI> by adhering to his standard, overcame by the word of their testimony. When these faithful witnesses kept their eye upon <HI>Christ,</HI> as their glorious stan∣dard-bearer, they feared no danger, but suffered chearfully. The connexion between <HI>Christ</HI>'s stan∣dard and victory, made these worthies stand by their ensign, and fall gloriously. Moreover, <HI>Christ</HI> was the ensign of his servants, who began and car∣ried on our reformation from popery. <HI>Christ</HI>'s stan∣dard was of another sort. He was still himself en∣sign of the people; but now his standard was for his supremacy in his church. In the former pe∣riods christians contended for <HI>Christ</HI>'s name in ge∣neral, in opposition to paganism; but now they contend for his priestly and kingly offices. <HI>Christ</HI> was an ensign against heathenism at first, but now he takes the field against antichrist. <HI>Jesus</HI> as the Lord, our righteousness and salvation, was the stan∣dard-bearer against popish works, pardons, and indulgencies, and against the tyranny of the Ro∣mish beast, over the souls and consciences of men. Now the truth of his imputed righteousness, as the ground of our hope before God, was the standard to hold by or desert. His authority, as the alone ensign of his saints, was now the matter of testi∣mony. Now it was, that <HI>Christ</HI> the ensign of his people, spirited a multitude of his servants to op∣pose these absurd and antichristian abominations. <HI>Christ</HI> was now ensign against his implacable ad∣versary, the Man of Sin: His standard was now in opposition to this murderer of souls. The oppo∣sers
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>of these antichristian abominations, did not promise great things to their followers; they only proclaimed their king, and shewed his colours. People were not at this period under compulsion to follow <HI>Christ</HI>'s standard for fear of rack and tor∣ture: The followers of the lamb used no such car∣nal weapons, nor Mahometan engines: They used no force, but the evidence of their ensign's right to men's services, and the advantages to be ob∣tained under his banner. They displayed their banners in the name of the Lord; and when they fell in his cause, it was beside his standard. This was a remarkable period, when <HI>Christ</HI>'s glory was made great as the ensign of his people; so great was the evidence of his power, that his standard made the powers of hell and <HI>Rome</HI> to shake.</P>
<P>BUT the words of our text may yet look forward to the latter days, when <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall be∣come one, and list themselves under <HI>Christ</HI>'s banner, as the ensign of the people. The conversion of the <HI>Jews</HI> seems to be pointed at in the verse following our text, <HI>And the Lord shall set his hand the second time, to gather his people that are scattered, &amp;c.</HI> Then shall <HI>Christ</HI> be an ensign to all nations, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles:</HI> The cross of <HI>Christ</HI> shall be no longer a stumbling block to the <HI>Jews,</HI> but they shall flock to his standard, and submit to his govern∣ment: <HI>As the Gentiles shall seek to his standard from afar, so shall also the Jews, and great shall be the peace of the kingdom.</HI> The glory of <HI>Christ</HI> as the King of his church, shall in these days be far more evident and conspicuous, when out of all nations and kingdoms, his brethren according to the flesh shall seek after him. Whether <HI>Christ</HI> shall bring that ancient people into their own land, and place them in a state of civil government, I shall not take upon me to determine; though it may be presumed that it will be so, from many promises of the Old
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>Testament, and some passages in the New, as Ezek. xxvi. 7, 24, 25, 26. These promises were not wholly fulfilled at their return from the <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity, because at this very day they are a re∣proach among the nations whither they are scattered abroad. But when they are brought again into their own land, in that day the promise refers to, they shall be no more a reproach to the nations, and the heathen about them. It is promised they shall dwell in their own land, and enjoy the promised blessings of the new covenant; but this they have not yet done; therefore it is reasonable to think that they shall yet have a glorious kingdom, both as a church and state.</P>
<P>UNDER the reign of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the drying up of the river <HI>Euphrates</HI> is prophesied of, which seems to refer to that glorious day, when <HI>Christ</HI> shall be the ensign to both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Mahometans,</HI> that now possess their land, shall fall at the battle of <HI>Armagiddon;</HI> and it is probable that the <HI>Jews</HI> shall enjoy their own old possessions in that day. Be this as it will, it is certain, <HI>Christ</HI> shall be the ensign of his people after all these commo∣tions are at an end: <HI>And he shall stand as an ensign of the people; to him shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2. To consider the blessing of rest, pro∣mised under <HI>Christ</HI>'s government.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may consider the glory of the gospel church in the purity of her doctrines, worship, and the number of her converts. She is glorious in the purity and simplicity of her doctrine. Every thing necessary to be believed and practised are pure and plain, Psal. xix. 7. <HI>The law of the Lord is pure.</HI> The testimony God hath given of himself in the gospel, as our God and Saviour, is most pure and plain. God's declaration in his word of
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>peace, are free of every tendency to impurity. Where the doctrines of the gospel are believed, they will issue in holiness. There is no tendency in any article of the christian religion to impurity. The more strong the faith of a christian is, the stricter will his life be. If we may judge of a cause from its effects, we cannot but be persuaded that the doctrines of faith are pure, when all true believers of these doctrines are a holy people. Though many professing christianity live bad lives, it is no argument against its doctrines, but an evidence that they are unsound believers: For if they believed the purity of its doctrines, they would study to conform their lives to its holy precepts.</P>
<P>DID men believe God's testimony anent a wicked world, <HI>That it shall be ill with the wicked, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings,</HI> is it possible they could any longer live either indolent or bad lives? The very design of the Almighty's revealing to men the danger of sin, and the state they naturally are in, is that they may believe it, and turn from it to <HI>Christ</HI> in a pure and holy manner. In the first chapter of this prophecy, he sets before <HI>Israel</HI> a description of their ruined state and condition; and in the 18th verse, shews the reason of this awful de∣claration; namely, That they might be holy, <HI>Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as wool; though they be as crimson, they shall be like snow.</HI> Moreover, these doctrines are delivered in the most simple and plain manner, free of all su∣perstition and gaudy ornament. They are set forth as they really are, true and pure. Though we have in the scriptures lofty descriptions of the power and majesty of God, beyond the parallel of human rhetoric; yet all the grounds of faith and rules of practice, are exprest in the plainest and most simple manner. We are indeed obliged to believe many things we cannot fully comprehend, as being be∣yond
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>our full reach in this imperfect state; yet, properly speaking, we are not called to believe any thing beyond the reach of our capacity: For what is the ground of our faith, is the testimony and declaration of God; which any person of common understanding may comprehend as a truth, though he cannot comprehend all the properties of the object revealed, nor all the reasons of the truth declared.</P>
<P>THE reason of our belief is clear and plain, the pure and perfect law of God. And if we believe that God is, and that he is an absolutely perfect being; then his declaration is sufficient to assure us, that any thing not repugnant to reason is true, though it be above our present capacity. God can∣not deceive us; therefore to believe his word can never be unsafe, but profitable. Must not then the church be very glorious in point of faith, when she is certain that in believing God's word she cannot err? What the church of <HI>Rome</HI> falsely assumes to herself, the church of <HI>Christ</HI> may with certainty claim as her privilege, namely, infallibility in faith: But then the articles are not of her own framing, but framed by the spirit of God; they derive not their authority from herself, but from her God and Saviour. This is an excellent branch of glory be∣longing to the church of God, that her faith is sure and certain, and the doctrines upon which it is founded most pure and true. They are free from the vain additions of men; have their authority imme∣diately from the Almighty, and are neither more or less true or false, pure and holy, by the sanction of men or the authority of churches. In this the New Testament church has by far the advantage of the Old; as every christian may believe for himself, and embrace the doctrines of religion, without in∣curring the divine displeasure for not agreeing with any national establishment. In matters of the most
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>solemn nature, the worshippers of God then, could not approach unto him but by the intervention of priests and sacrifices, and were not allowed to enter within the vail; but christians, under the gospel dispensation, may approach unto <HI>the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus,</HI> and offer the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to God, without the in∣tervention of priest or clergyman. The true be∣liever under the gospel, may see the purity of doc∣trine, and the evidence thereof as the ground and rule of faith, as it were at first hand; whereas these worthies had a long train of mediums to look through, that were dark in themselves, and but shadows in comparison of what we now enjoy. The discoveries of the gospel are farther advanced beyond these under the law, than all the modern disco∣coveries in philosophy are beyond the ancient.</P>
<P>THE doctrines anent the restoration of men into the divine favour, are pure and spiritual: The souls of true believers may enjoy communion with God thereby, by the assistance of his grace, without any second editions from men or churches. Men now may make free with the promises, without asking liberty from priest or prophet. No person or per∣sons whatsoever can be lords of our faith or con∣sciences. The doctrines of salvation now run in a a free channel, which is the great glory of the christian church: Every man may now judge and believe for himself. Helps in the practice of reli∣gion we may and ought to have, but lords over our faith and conscience we cannot have, without destroying our christian liberty. The New Testa∣ment church is glorious in this respect, as every member, in what he is to believe and practise for salvation, is alike free. No worldly power or dig∣nity can give more or less liberty in matters of faith and practice. The poorest person that lives is as free in this respect as either kings or emperors.
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>This liberty arises from the truths themselves that teach it. Hence christian liberty is not founded upon the permission of churches and legislators, but upon the authority of God, expressed in the doc∣trines of his word. Every private christian has now the glorious freedom and liberty of reading the sacred oracles in his own language, and of understanding and believing them as he is able, without being account∣able to any but God himself. The doctrine of justification, through the imputed righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> without the works of the law, is purely and clearly taught in the gospel church: No mixture of popish works and pardons is joined with this me∣ritorious cause of our salvation; <HI>This pure water of life is clear like crystal,</HI> Rev. xxii. 1. The promises of life and salvation, are opened up in these glori∣ous days of rest in the church, as containing our ground of acceptance with God, and the cause of our meetness for eternal life. What <HI>Jesus</HI> did and suffered, and that he died and rose again, is freely set forth in the gospel: Nothing but plain truth is there published, free from the disguise of the en∣ticing words of man's wisdom: No conceits of de∣signing men are joined with these doctrines, nor mixed with the history of the life of <HI>Jesus,</HI> but a pure declaration of what he did and suffered; and for what end and purpose is exhibited in the gospel.</P>
<P>No great things are required of men to come at these benefits which <HI>Christ</HI> purchased to his people, only faith in <HI>Jesus,</HI> and in what he did is required, which is also promised. For this purpose God hath promised his spirit to assist us, Ezek. xxxvi. 27. <HI>I will put my spirit within you, &amp;c.</HI> The two Testaments are so pure and simple, and free of ob∣scurity, that no objection can be justly made against them, either from themselves or the manner they are delivered. We have truths told us, by men who could have no design to impose upon the world,
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>and confirmed by the divine approbation, in work∣ing of miracles of support the evidence of these doc∣trines. Many of the things themselves are facts that none could deny; but in the way, contradicting themselves. When the <HI>Jews</HI> attempted to deny the resurrection of our Saviour, what a foul blun∣der did they fall into; they desired the soldiers to say that the disciples stole him away when they slept: But how could they be evidences when they were asleep? Must not such a cause be bad that needs such evidence to support it.</P>
<P>THE gospel church will appear glorious, if we consider these rules of practice that are given her for her observation. This comprehends all divine commandments and institutions. Under the gos∣pel we have a beautiful system of moral precepts, freed from all the ceremony of the figurative pe∣riod: Laws in themselves, founded in the nature of things, and tending to the happiness of such as obey them, are clearly taught in the divine law; a brief sum of which we have in the two great command∣ments mentioned by our Saviour; <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neigh∣bour as thyself.</HI> This he more fully explains in his excellent sermon on the mount: There he shews what he expects from such as follow him, and what they shall enjoy by a sincere observation of his com∣mandments. The way of keeping the command∣ments is the way to heaven, though not the pro∣curing cause of our admission. The system of moral duties under <HI>Christ</HI>'s government is more spi∣ritual than under the law, and no less necessary though less grievous. The temper and disposition of mind on which a christian discharges his duty, comprehending principle, motives and end, is more regarded by God than the pompous way of doing of it▪ The glory of <HI>Christ</HI>'s government in his church, is very remarkable for the sweetness and
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>easiness of his yoke; <HI>His yoke is easy, and his burthen light.</HI> That blessed system of rules he hath laid down, and corroberates by his own example, is an easy and delightful path for his followers to walk in. What makes this yoke easy is, it being in his own hand; Scribes, Pharisees, and lawyers, have now no right, <HI>To bind heavy burthens upon men's shoulders:</HI> No set of men have authority from <HI>Christ</HI> to force men to religious duties, nor to add a heavy yoke of additional human inventions, to the ordi∣nances of <HI>Christ.</HI> The kindly Redeemer imposes the yoke of duty, and lays on the burthen of obli∣gation himself; which he enables his people to bear by the assistance of his Holy Spirit. When the rules of practice among the <HI>Jews</HI> came through the hands of Rabbies and Priests, what a heavy yoke did the people groan under? The law of <HI>Moses</HI> by them was augmented to a monstrous size, and the duties imposed by them upon the people were beyond all possibility of observation. These dicta∣torial Levites knew how to impose burthens upon the people, but were ignorant how to assist in the way of bearing them. It is a great mercy to the christian church that she is, by right from <HI>Christ,</HI> out of the domineering hands of priests and clergy∣men. She now receives her laws from <HI>Christ</HI> him∣self, who has the bowels of a parent, and the mercy of a God; and is not <HI>A severe master, who reaps where he hath not sown.</HI> Under the government of <HI>Jesus,</HI> the King of his church, his subjects serve him without fear. The administration of the Me∣diator is free of terror; for his people by him, <HI>Be∣ing delivered out of the hands of their enemies, serve him without fear all the days of their life.</HI> There was much terror at giving the law upon mount <HI>Sinai, so that Moses exceedingly feared and quaked;</HI> and all along there was something of terror attended that dispensation. The law was given with thun∣der,
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>and repeated with curses; and sundry remark∣able examples of divine vengeance were seen for the breach of some positive laws in that period. But under the gospel mercy reigns through righteous∣ness by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord.</P>
<P>DIVINE laws now more immediately respect the consciences of men, and that visible severity which appeared in the first dispensation is sweetly tempered with grace under the government of the Messiah. If we view the ordinances and institu∣tions of the christian church, she will appear glo∣rious. The easiness of their performance, the happiness of their tendency, adds a considerable lustre to these institutions. The ordinance of preach∣ing the gospel, whereby peace and pardon is pub∣lished to sinners, is a noble and glorious privilege of the gospel church: This institution, as appointed by <HI>Christ,</HI> is glad tidings to all people: A gra∣cious design of heaven revealed to men, and a testimony of God's satisfaction with what <HI>Christ</HI> hath done. In the gospel God speaks to men from a throne of grace, and declares his mercy to sin∣ners through his beloved son.</P>
<P>THE gospel presents us with a more benign dis∣covery of the Deity; his goodness, grace, and mercy shine illustriously through this dispensation. God draws men now near him in the way of love, and the true gospel faith in God, as in <HI>Jesus</HI> recon∣ciled, <HI>is a faith that works by love.</HI> The amiable character of the Deity is represented in this dispen∣sation of the Redeemer's power; and the gospel method of saving sinners is a persuading them to embrace <HI>Jesus</HI> as revealed in divine revelation, <HI>As made of God unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctifica∣tion, and redemption.</HI> The language of the gospel is, <HI>I am pacified towards you, for all the ill that thou hast done.</HI> The character of God in the gospel ap∣pears propitious to men, as he has declared his sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>with what <HI>Christ</HI> hath done for their sins, through his obedience. The character of our Me∣diator as God in our nature, constitutes a friend∣ship between heaven and earth.</P>
<P>IN the gospel dispensation, the great rewards laid up for them that love God are beautifully opened up and displayed. That the saints shall enjoy everlasting rest in the favour of God through eternity, is clearly revealed in the gospel. The prophet tells us, <HI>That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath laid up for them that fear him.</HI> And what was hid from ages and generations is now brought to light by the gospel, even life and im∣mortality. In this dispensation of the Redeemer's government there also appears the greatest purity and holiness, as men are saved in the way of vin∣dicating the purity and holiness of the divine cha∣racter, by forming the minds of believers into the likeness of God. This gospel, though it represents God as gracious to such as accept of his son, yet it testifies that he is holy and just in punishing ob∣stinate unbelievers.</P>
<P>THE gospel is pure in all its offers and promises; it offers salvation to the guilty and unclean, but bestows it in the way of washing and cleansing them from all their iniquities; <HI>The blood of Jesus, his son, cleanseth them from all sin.</HI> The very offer of <HI>Christ</HI> contains holiness in the nature of it, as the cha∣racter in which he is offered testifies; <HI>For he is made of God to us, sanctification and redemption.</HI></P>
<P>THESE ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper, hold forth the glorious purity of the king∣dom of <HI>Christ,</HI> and that his rest is glorious. Bap∣tism points out a purification from the pollution of sin by the blood of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and all persons to whom this ordinance is blest and sanctified, are washed from the guilt of sin, <HI>And purified from dead works to serve
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>the living God.</HI> The institution of the supper acquaints us with the liveliest picture of strict holiness, as therein <HI>Christ</HI> is represented as crucisied, that a holy people might by that death enjoy communion with a holy Lord God. The very signisication of this ordinance is holiness; for the blood of <HI>Christ</HI> therein shewed forth, is blood <HI>that cleanseth from all sin,</HI> and such as partake of that ordinance oblige themselves to war against <HI>the devil, the world, and the flesh.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a glorious privilege of the New Testa∣ment church, that the friends of <HI>Christ</HI> may eat and drink in his presence, clothed with his pure and spotless righteousness. The spiritual nature of this ordinance is to nourish the soul in holiness, and to strengthen the faith of believers in every word of promised goodness. There is a more full and perfect representation of divine goodness and grace in the sacrament of the supper, than was in the passover of old. The Old Testament saints did eat in the presence of <HI>Christ,</HI> but did not drink, better things being reserved for us; but this or∣dinance points out that perfect satisfaction and joy in <HI>Christ,</HI> by a full representation of all that figures forth satisfaction, or is needful for nourishment, viz. eating and drinking. In this holy ordinance believers sit, and eat, and drink with <HI>Christ</HI> at his table, by faith, and as it were are brought to a state of rest, when compared with the <HI>Jewish</HI> church: They did eat the passover with <HI>their staff in their hand,</HI> as ready to enter upon a journey, but the church now, in token of a more glorious rest, is allowed to sit, and both to eat and drink, as an evidence of a more perfect state.</P>
<P>IN point of all parts of worship the church of <HI>Christ</HI> is glorious. Believers are not now confined to any one place to worship God, but <HI>in all places them that fear God and work righteousness, are accept∣ed.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>There is a glorious freedom of access to God through <HI>Jesus,</HI> at all times and in all places. The <HI>Jews</HI> had to go up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> once every year to keep the passover, and no place but that <HI>which the Lord had chosen</HI> was accounted acceptable: But under the gospel, christians are freed from that con∣finement. We may consider the glory of the New Testament church in the number of her converts: That promise, <HI>More are the children of the desolate than of the married woman,</HI> has been in a great measure fulfilled: This is clear from the beginning and progress of this branch of the church's glory. It began with great success; a nation, as it were, was born at once. After the out-pouring of the spirit upon the day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> after our Lord's ascen∣sion into heaven, multitudes were converted to christianity; and <HI>Satan</HI>'s kingdom was made to shake. Such was the powerful evidence that at∣tended the doctrines of the gospel, that no power of prejudice could oppose it: Its truth was so powerful and convincing, that men, over the belly of interest and pleasure, became followers of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and subjects of his kingdom. Men at this time broke through the strongest connexions of relation and friendship, and joined themselves to the church; <HI>They lest father and mother, sister and brother, and followed Christ.</HI> Worldly interest, that has the most powerful influence over the conduct of men, could not hinder the primitive christians to embrace christianity: If they had friends they left them, if possessions they sold them, and went over all dif∣ficulties to add to the number of <HI>Christ</HI>'s soldiers. Even in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where <HI>Jesus</HI> was crucified, there was a numerous multitude of converts to the gos∣pel church: <HI>Peter,</HI> at one sermon, converted three thousand; and <HI>John,</HI> by another, five thousand. Never under any former dispensation do we hear of such a number of converts so soon made, and in
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>opposition to so many prejudices. This was a glory referred to the days of the gospel, <HI>when Christ should stand as the ensign of the people:</HI> This was a glory designed for <HI>Christ</HI>'s New Testament spouse, and a crown <HI>wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we consider the opposition christianity met with, this beginning will appear glorious. No device of man was wanting, nor force to suppress the dawning of this glory. The <HI>Jews</HI> exprest the utmost fury and malice against the primitive chris∣tians: The rulers of the <HI>Jews</HI> supprest it all they could; <HI>They stoned Stephen to death, and slew James with the sword:</HI> They scourged others and treated them cruelly; but all this could not hinder the increase of the church's glory, nor the number of her converts; <HI>The more they were oppressed, they mul∣tiplied and grew.</HI> That the number of converts should increase in opposition to all human oppres∣sion, and laws made against christianity, is an evi∣dence of the glorious power of the grace of the Redeemer, operating upon the minds of men by the gospel. There were no promises nor prospect of worldly advantages that attended this religion to incline men to embrace it, but on the contrary they were forewarned that losses and persecution should be their lot. Could any thing but the glo∣rious evidence of divine truth, persuade men to engage in a cause, where they were sure of nothing in this world but trouble and persecution? Yet so it was, that at the very beginning the church was glorious in the number of her converts. As the beginning of christianity was glorious, so the pro∣gress it made was remarkable. <HI>That handful of corn upon the top of the mountains soon began to shake with prosperous fruit, like the trees in Lebanon.</HI> Those few apostles and converts at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> by the per∣secution that arose there, were scattered abroad,
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>and preaching the gospel to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> converted multitudes to the faith of <HI>Jesus.</HI> In a short time the number of christians multiplied to such a de∣gree, that they became considerable in the world, and bare no small proportion in sundry parts of the empire: The glory of the church of <HI>Christ</HI> went out through the nations, and she became ter∣rible as an army with banners. Even <HI>Kings became nursing fathers, and Queens nursing mothers</HI> to the church: Then <HI>her glory went out through all the earth,</HI> and the promise in our text was punctually fulfilled; <HI>For his rest was glorious.</HI></P>
<P>THE powers of darkness, as the gospel made progress, gave way, and were not able to withstand its power, nor to keep those that were under their influence. Such was the glory of <HI>Christ</HI>'s power in his carrying on his work in the church, that it dispelled the darkness wherever it came: <HI>Satan fell as lightning to the ground</HI> before it. <HI>Christ</HI> now <HI>triumphed over principalities and powers,</HI> and reigned in his church, <HI>and shined forth before his ancients gloriously.</HI> The glory of this progress of religion appears in the liberty and freedom of it. There was no force nor compulsion used to bring men over to christianity: All the new converts to the gospel enlisted themselves freely under <HI>Christ</HI>'s ban∣ner. In this day of the Redeemer's power his people <HI>were willing,</HI> and christians agreed in one to make <HI>Christ</HI> their head. The new converts to the christian religion, having freely and voluntarily en∣gaged in the service of <HI>Christ,</HI> they served him with resolution and chearfulness; and by having their hearts bent upon his service, became <HI>good soldiers of Jesus Christ:</HI> They became so expert in the christian warfare, and so resolute in the service of their master, that neither force nor fraud could overcome their fortitude. Then it was that the church <HI>looked fair as the sun, and terrible as an army
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>with banners. Sons and daughters were</HI> brought forth in the church out of all nations; and she was glorious, as being the mother of many children to <HI>Christ.</HI> As the primitive christians were the fol∣lowers of <HI>Christ</HI> by free choice, so they never com∣pelled any to christianity against their will: Force and compulsion were left to <HI>Mahomedans</HI> and their imitators: <HI>Christ</HI>'s people were free and willing themselves, and wanted none but such as were wil∣ling to embrace their fellowship. Civil authority had not yet got footing among christians; nor was religion as yet ingrafted upon the state. The ori∣ginal pattern of the religion of <HI>Jesus</HI> was pure and undefiled, neither mixed with human inventions, nor attended with secular awe, interest or pleasure. The acknowledgment of <HI>Christ</HI> as dead and risen again, and ascended into heaven, and as the only Lord of his church, was all the confession of faith required of new converts: They had not yet learn∣ed the method of creed-making, nor the art of forging canons to bind men's consciences: Liberty was well understood, and faithfully practised as yet. It was when churches began to model themselves after the manner of monarchies and states, that creed-making came in fashion: When interest and ease were the attendants of religion, it was found necessary to guard the privilege against being o∣verstocked.</P>
<P>So long as liberty was understood and practised, religion encreased, and christianity flourished; di∣visions were unknown, and love among brethren prevailed: But when once pride and ambition made men grasp at power, liberty was enfringed, love abated, and divisions commenced. No sooner did christians deviate from primitive freedom and li∣berty, than the glory of the church was defaced. <HI>Christ,</HI> as the ensign of the people, never intended any force in his system of government; all his sub∣jects
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>must be willing, otherwise they are not ac∣ceptable. The peace and harmony of the church depends upon her liberty, for without it there can be no true peace: When men are confined in their way of thinking in religion by others, they never will live in harmony: For every christian having the same privilege from <HI>Christ,</HI> can never see the propriety of others depriving them of it without his authority. The promise in our text, looks for∣ward to a time of liberty and peace, when the peace of the children of God shall be great; when brotherly love shall continue; when the hearts of christians shall be opened to receive one another with love, and shall not longer shut their fellow-christians out of their affections, from an attachment to some peculiar way of thinking. When this glory of the latter day is made to shine, men shall not longer judge their brethren, nor seek to square their con∣sciences by their own rules, but allow them to live and believe as the word of God directs them: Then shall that promise be amply fulfilled, Ezek. xxxiv. 25. <HI>They shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. For in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude this subject with a very short improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. From what has been said, we may see, that our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> answers his character given him in our text, as the ensign of the people. <HI>He has lifted up a standard to the nations from afar</HI> in the gospel, and revealed himself <HI>as the captain of our salvation.</HI> He <HI>leads his people into all truth,</HI> as their leader, and <HI>as the captain of their salvation</HI> directs them in all their spiritual warfare, defends them against the force and fraud of all their spi∣ritual enemies. The experience of all believers
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>from the beginning until now, can witness that <HI>Je∣sus</HI> fulfills this character; <HI>David</HI> could say, <HI>My foot had well nigh slipt, but the Lord held me up; and unless the Lord had been my help when I was oppres∣sed, my soul had remained in the house of silence.</HI> Whoever follows <HI>Christ,</HI> as the ensign of the people, will find that he answers his character; for he leads them safely to the borders of his sanctuary, and gives them the victory over all their spiritual ene∣mies. Those who make choice of <HI>Jesus</HI> for their leader, will certainly be safe; for he has infinite power to uphold them, to protect and deliver them; <HI>He has an arm that is full of power, his hand is great in might. Those who trust in him shall never be moved, but be like mount Zion, endureth for ever.</HI> As to the evidence of his character, as the leader and ensign of the people, even his enemies have been obliged to acknowledge it. The <HI>Jews,</HI> who were the most inveterate enemies of <HI>Jesus,</HI> were forced from the evidence of his power to confess, <HI>that truly mighty works were done by him. Pontius Pi∣late,</HI> by the inscription of his cross, acknowledged him <HI>as King of the Jews,</HI> and as ensign of the people. The evidence was so strong that it forced conviction upon our Lord's greatest enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may see wherein the glory of the church consists; it consists in rest and peace. Nothing is more glorious than to see <HI>brethren living together in unity.</HI> It is the truest evidence of their relation to <HI>Christ,</HI> and a bright mark of his image upon them. The glory of any thing in truth, consists in its goodness, and it is only so far as it is good that any glory belongs unto it: But the <HI>Psalmist</HI> has assured us, <HI>That it is a good thing for brethren to live toge∣ther in unity,</HI> Psal. cxxxiii. 1. All the pageantry of worldly grandeur, without love and peace, is an emblem of hell. And a profession of religion, without peace and unity, is only a religious way of
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>serving the interest of Satan. The glory of the church consists of the true enjoyment of the fruits of the spirit; of which peace is an eminent one. Whatever honour men of various oponions may take to themselves, on account of the orthodoxy of their opinions, yet if they be fractious and de∣vicive, and love not to enjoy rest and peace, they have no glory worthy the name: <HI>For where there is envy, there is confusion and every evil work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. SEE a rule to be observed in order to enjoy the rest here promised. Make choice of <HI>Christ</HI> for a leader in all your undertakings. <HI>He is the ensign of his church,</HI> held forth in the gospel as one who <HI>leads men to that everlasting rest that remains for the people of God.</HI> No wonder they perish from the way of rest that keep not <HI>Christ</HI> in their eye; for it is his office to lead men to everlasting life. <HI>He is the way, the truth, and the life,</HI> and such as follow him shall never be disappointed. The great reason of so many wandering out of the way of true rest and peace, is that they know not nor follow <HI>Christ:</HI> They are ignorant of his character and offices, and have no dependance upon him; and by trusting to themselves, they fall short of this glorious rest. Not to make choice of <HI>Christ</HI> for our leader, and to depend upon him, is unbelief; and no unbeliever can enjoy this rest: The <HI>Israelites could not enter in∣to rest because of unbelief;</HI> and no unbeliever shall ever be a partaker of this glorious <HI>rest that remains for the children of God.</HI> It is such as follow <HI>Jesus,</HI> and rest upon him by faith, that shall behold him in that glorious place of rest, where it may be said in the truest manner, that it is <HI>glorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> LET every one be exhorted to follow <HI>Christ</HI>'s standard as the true way to happiness and everlading glory. This is no fruitless pursuit, nor endless enquiry; they shall enjoy rest at last. The present state is a state of trial, but it leads to rest and
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>peace to them that follow <HI>Jesus. Godliness hath great gain, having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.</HI> The followers of the Lamb shall at last <HI>rest from their labours, and their works follow them.</HI> Though they are in this world like soldiers in the field of battle, under the go∣vernment of <HI>Christ, their warfare shall be accom∣plished, and they shall enter into rest.</HI> Those who <HI>suf∣fer with Christ shall also reign with him,</HI> and such as have faithfully followed his standard of truth here, shall enjoy a kingdom hereafter. For mo∣tive consider, that such as follow <HI>Jesus</HI> as their lea∣der are sure of safety, <HI>He leads them by the good skill of his hand to his holy habitation:</HI> None that ever trusted in him were disappointed. It is no perad∣venture whether such as follow <HI>Christ</HI> shall be happy: It is a glorious certainty; for both the church mi∣litant and triumphant bear testimony to its truth. The <HI>Psalmist</HI> bears witness to this, <HI>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever:</HI> And the saints in glory say, <HI>Thou hast made us kings and priests to our God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON III. The Title of our Redeemer as the Lamb in the Midst of the Throne, and his Administration of his Trust in that Capacity, opened up.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>REV. vii. 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For the Lamb which is in the Midst of the Throne shall feed them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us that <HI>Christ</HI> is both the author and finisher of our faith; and our text informs that all our spiritual nourishment here and hereafter, proceeds from him as the Saviour of his people. From the beginning of the fourth chapter to the end of the eleventh, the Lord represents to <HI>John</HI> the state of the church under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, by sundry significant visions and glorious figures; such as a throne in heaven and a lamb in the midst of it, <HI>four beasts, four-and-twenty elders, thunders, seven trumpets, and an innumerable company of blessed wor∣shippers praising to God and the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI> The scene of this vision is said to be in <HI>hea∣ven,</HI> as in the beginning of the fourth chapter. Heaven in this book is sometimes taken for the church, as chap. xii. 1, and 7. <HI>I saw a wonder in hea∣ven, and there was war in heaven:</HI> But here it must be understood of the place where the blessed reside, such as <HI>Stephen</HI> saw at his death; or if we under∣stand it more complexly, as comprehending a re∣presentation of both the militant and triumphant church, as something relative to both is represented
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>in this vision, it will be more consistent with the scope; for <HI>John</HI> saw an innumerable company, be∣sides <HI>one hundred and forty-four thousand,</HI> which seem to denote the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who could not as yet be in heaven, literally so called.</P>
<P>IF we view heaven as comprehending both states of men, this vision of <HI>John</HI>'s may consist of a two-fold scene; a representation of the happy state of those that were actually in glory, and of those who should come there.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to our view of this scene, the throne upon which the lamb is represented as sitting, may be viewed as a throne of grace, or a throne of glory. <HI>Christ</HI> our Lord, whose death and dying love we are met this day to commemorate, is pointed out under the metaphor of a <HI>Lamb,</HI> in allusion to the paschal lamb of old, and upon a throne as having finished the work that was given him to do; <HI>Ha∣ving triumphed over principalities and powers.</HI> He is represented as upon a throne, as the reward of ex∣altation promised unto him <HI>when he should make his soul an offering for sin:</HI> This glory the church a∣scribes unto him, x<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 6. <HI>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: The scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of righteousness.</HI> This throne of grace, which is so in relation to us in this present state, is the throne of glory to <HI>Christ</HI> and the triumphant church; and our Lord upon this throne, stands in relation to both. He is represented as in the midst of the throne, pointing out his full authority to rule as king of <HI>Zion,</HI> and to save and redeem his people as the administrator of the new covenant.</P>
<P>THE manner of his administration is pointed out by his title and the trust committed to him. His title is that of a Lamb, gentle and meek; his trust is to keep and feed his people; <HI>The Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall feed them.</HI></P>
<P>IN further discoursing upon the subject, I pro∣pose,
<PB N="78" REF="82"/><HI>First,</HI> to explain our Mediator's title here given him. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Open up his administration of his trust, as the nourisher and feeder of his people. <HI>Lastly,</HI> Improve the subject.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 1. To explain the title here given to our Lord and Saviour, namely of a <HI>Lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT points out the spotless purity and inno∣cence of his nature. <HI>He had no sin, nor was guile found in his mouth:</HI> So the Apostle tells us, Heb. vii. 2. <HI>Such on High-priest became us, as was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.</HI> It was necessary our Redeemer should be free from all sin, like a lamb without blemish or spot, that his obla∣tion might be acceptable unto God; for had their been any defect in his nature, or any sin cleaving unto him, he would have been an unfit and im∣proper sacrifice, and needed an atonement for him∣self. But as the paschal lamb, which was a type of him, was without blemish; so he, as the glo∣rious substance and signification of that type, was pure and free from all manner of sin.</P>
<P>HE had no original sin, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and born of a virgin in an extraordi∣nary manner: Nor had he any actual guilt by false imitation of wicked men; for he lived separate from sinners: His nature was pure, his manner of life strict and exemplary.</P>
<P>As he was positively innocent, so was he passively also. There was a positive natural holiness and purity in his soul and body: Every good qualification reign∣ed in perfection in his holy nature. Love to friends and enemies, a readiness on all occasions to do good to all men, were inherent in his nature. Love to God and every commandment of his holy law, needed not in him to be stirred up by motives, but were radically in his very constitution. It was as his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly Fa∣ther.
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>His body was free of all positive seeds of corruption; so that when he was laid in the grave, the infection of corrupt nature did not seize his holy and blessed body: Being free of sin he was also free of the seeds of mortality. It was because it was necessary he should die, and not because it was natural to him that he yielded to death, and was laid in a grave. It is both natural and neces∣sary to men to die, because they have the seeds of mortality in their very constitution; and never can be freed from sin till they be freed from it by death. But it was not so with the Lamb of God, for he was innocent and spotless like a <HI>Lamb without all sin. Jesus</HI> was also passively pure and innocent; <HI>He gave no offence to the Jews nor the Greeks. When he was reviled, he reviled not again, but commended himself to him that judgeth righteously.</HI> Like a lamb, that can∣not hurt any thing, he behaved himself towards all men, both friends and enemies. When he had no call to exert his power to do good to any, he never used it to any man's hurt: He never spake nor acted to the disadvantage of any. Being pure and holy by nature, his whole life was a testimony of immaculate innocence and untainted rectitude: From his birth to his grave there were no inordi∣nate affections in his holy soul, nor evil actions in his hands: Even when he was highly injured, and most cruelly and unjustly used, <HI>As a sheep before his shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THIS title contains in it his fitness for that trust that was committed unto him. He had re∣ceived the weighty and important trust of men's salvation: The Father gave him a seed to redeem, and he accepted of them; he engaged to pay the price of their redemption, which was to give him∣self a ransom for them; and as he became their High-priest, <HI>He behoved to have somewhat to offer.</HI> An imperfect or impure offering could not be ac∣cepted
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>of by a holy and perfect God, whose nature is holiness, and his law perfection: But <HI>Christ</HI> being holy, pure and perfect in the whole properties of his nature, was a fit and proper propitiation for the sins of his people: This the apostle <HI>Peter</HI> witnes∣seth, 1 Pet. i. 18. <HI>Forasmuch as ye are not redeemed with corruptible things, such as silver and gold; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb with∣out spot.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord being free of every imperfection, was exceedingly fit for honouring the holy command∣ment: He had both inclination and power to fulfil it. His holy will and inclination was natu∣rally bent towards all the precepts of the righteous law, and being free of all prejudices opposite there∣to, had full ability to fulfil all its commandments. His purity and holiness made him likewise a fit sacrifice to satisfy divine justice; <HI>For he was a Lamb without blemish.</HI> The strictest justice could find no imperfection in his obedience, nor insufficiency in his satisfaction. Concerning his perfect righteous∣ness, <HI>Jehovah</HI> says, <HI>I am well pleased for his righte∣ousness sake,</HI> Isai. xlii. 21.</P>
<P>HE every way answers this fair and innocent character given him of a Lamb. As the Lamb of God he was an appointed and consecrated sacrifice. The paschal lamb of old was set apart for a sacri∣fice by the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and for this purpose was kept from the tenth day of the month till the fourteenth; but had not there been a divine appointment, it would not have been accepted of: The law war∣ranting the institution was the safety of the people's conduct, and made the offering acceptable. Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was under an appointment of the Father, and consecrated by the Holy Spirit to be a sacrifice <HI>for the sins of his people.</HI> He was an ob∣lation by heaven's unchangeable law, and without an appointment he could not have been a propiati∣on
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>on without presumption. Answerable to his type the paschal lamb, he fulfilled his appointment; he suffered, <HI>that all things written in Moses and the pro∣phets concerning him might be fulfilled.</HI> The paschal lamb was not only a sacrifice but a feast; so our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is both a feast and a sacrifice: His death was a sacrifice that satisfied justice, and it is also the food of the believer's faith. A believ∣ing view of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the slain Lamb of God, is as real food to the soul of a true christian, as any cor∣poreal food is to his body: It strengthens our faith and credit in God, as reconciled to us, enlivens our affections and encreases our love. Our faith in God, as propitious to us through the blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> will raise our affections towards him who paid the ransom for our sins, and brought about our recon∣ciliation: It will kindle our love to him that loved us, and gave his only begotten son to die for us.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS title instructs us in the unchangeable nature of <HI>Christ</HI>'s priesthood. He is still in heaven, as to character what he was while here, and bears the same offices for our salvation. Though he hath changed his state, he still retains the same office; he who was the suffering Saviour, <HI>or the Lamb for a burnt-offering, is the Lamb in the midst of the throne. This man continueth for ever, and hath an unchangeable priesthood,</HI> Heb. vii. 24. What he once offered in sacrifice for our sins, he now pre∣sents in heaven for our justification. <HI>Christ</HI> hath laid aside none of his offices, as our Mediator in heaven: <HI>He is the Light of the heavenly city, a Priest upon his throne for ever, of his kingdom there is no end: His dominion is an everlasting dominion.</HI> Though the paschal lamb was slain, its blood spake; and it was a constant security against the sin it was offered for, that it should not bring the people into con∣demnation, Though <HI>Christ</HI> was but once slain, his
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>blood still speaks peace to his people, and he pre∣sents the merits of his oblation before the throne of God, Heb. xii. 24. <HI>And ye are come to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things than that of Abel.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Christ</HI> be in heaven, his blood speaks peace to men upon earth. He is still <HI>a faithful High Priest, in things pertaining to God, and makes reconciliation for the sins of his people.</HI> He is in the midst of the throne, as our advocate and interces∣sor, and ever liveth for that purpose, Heb. vii. 25. <HI>He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make reconciliation for us.</HI> It is necessary that <HI>Christ</HI> should continue in this character, that his people might have strong consolation. <HI>Christ,</HI> as our intercessor, hath fixt the anchor of our hope within the vail in himself, as the apostle expresseth it, Heb. vi. 18. <HI>That we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to the hope that is set before us.</HI> The title that our Redeemer received in the new covenant transaction for our reconciliation, he still and ever will retain for our perseverance and everlasting confirmation These few things are implied in this title given our bles∣sed Redeemer as the Lamb in the midst of the throne.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2. To open our Redeemer's administration of his trust, exprest in the words, <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall feed them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. LET it be observed that this is exprest in a figure, and is to be understood by analogy to our daily nourishment by the providence of God, as in him we live, move, and have our being. As our bodily frame is upheld and maintained by God, as the author of our providence, so our spiritual is maintained by him as our Lord and Saviour. The feeding of the saints, here or hereafter, proceeds from <HI>Christ,</HI> as the administrator of the covenant
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>of grace. As our bodies are supported by his bounty, so our souls are maintained by his grace and favour. What food is to the body, commu∣nion with <HI>Christ,</HI> in all his offices and relations, is to our souls; and a saint can no more live without this communion, than any creature can live without food or nourishment, Psal. lxxiii. 25. The spiritual ca∣pacity of the intellectual frame may be said to be fed, when such objects are presented to its contem∣plation as suit its nature, fill up its capacity, and satisfy its desires. Here it may be necessary to con∣sider what things <HI>Christ</HI> in his divine administration bestows upon his people for nourishment to their souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE represents to their faith his love, as the surety of the new covenant, engaging for them as their surety priest, to fulfil all righteousness for them in the fulness of time; as Prov. viii. 23. <HI>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning or ever the the earth was.</HI> A view of our Saviour's love as surety of the covenant, engaging for believers, when yet they were conceived as enemies to God, and obnoxious to his wrath and curse, must certainly be an entertaining subject to every heaven-born soul. When <HI>Christ</HI> by his Spirit reveals this in the doc∣trines and promises of the gospel to the soul, it is like good news from a far country; then with the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> the believer can say, <HI>He loved me, and gave himself for me,</HI> Gal. ii. 20. This is nourish∣ment to faith, when the soul is ready to faint un∣der apprehensions of divine anger. A view of <HI>Jesus, as the lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> sustain∣ing the character of a surety for his people, and for such a soul in particular, will satisfy the spiritual disposition, <HI>as with marrow and fatness:</HI> Then can a christian say with the Psalmist, Psal. lxiii. 5. <HI>My
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>soul shall be filled as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN unbelief and the deceit of the evil one, darken the spiritual views of the true christian, marr his comfort, and introduce doubts and fears into the mind, make him question his right to the divine favour, the Redeemer presents to his soul what he is to him as his surety and salvation, and says, <HI>Let all thy wants be upon me.</HI> This is one of the first comforts <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> gives his people. The first solid satisfaction that the christian enjoys, after his embracing of <HI>Jesus,</HI> arises from a just view of him, as <HI>the high priest over the house of God.</HI> This gives him a sight of the pardon of sin, as his guilt is transferred upon his surety, and speaks a favourable release to the soul; <HI>If ye seek me, let these go their way:</HI> And as he is for ever appointed unto this office, the soul has here a lasting spring of comfort. Until the soul by faith in some measure sees its interest in <HI>Christ,</HI> as the surety of the covenant, it never can be truly satisfied, nor rationally delighted.</P>
<P>THE sure and rational views of <HI>Jesus;</HI> as a sure∣ty priest, bearing the sins of his people; and as their intercessor, agenting their cause before God, is true and suitable nourishment to a believer. It strengthens faith, encreases love, and raises a true joy in the soul.</P>
<P>CHRIST also represents unto his people the cause and end of his priesthood and suretyship: His free and unmerited love is that glorious cause there∣of, a most powerful and active one. This love is not merely an inclination towards their welfare and happiness; but a powerful determining principle, whereby he is influenced to do them good. The right understanding of this encreases the love of men to <HI>Jesus;</HI> for as this love in <HI>Christ</HI> appears to them as an everlasting powerful propensity to save
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>and sanctify them, they see a perpetual reason found∣ed in gratitude to love him. Their salvation, and liberty from sin and death, is the noble and excel∣lent end of our Redeemer's suretyship. He sub∣stitutes himself as our surety, that we might be freed from condemnation, and be <HI>a holy peculiar people to him, zealous of good works.</HI> All these re∣lations of his as a surety of the new covenant, are delightful to contemplate, and are spiritual nourish∣ment to the souls of christians. When he discovers these to his saints, he may be said to feed them.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE feeds them with a discovery of the won∣derful constitution of his person, as God and Man, in two distinct natures, in one person. He opens up to his children the blessed relation he stands in to them, <HI>as bone of their bone, and flesh of their flesh,</HI> as their near kinsman that hath performed the kins∣man's part. This discovery is to the christian a ve∣ry delightful manifestation, whereby he is ready to declare his satisfaction in the Divine goodness, and to say, <HI>it is good for him to be here.</HI> To behold the nature of man united to the divine person of the Son, and exalted to a state of inconceivable bliss; and withal, to have the certainty that this is a pledge of our participation of the same glory in due time, cannot miss to be a satisfying discovery. This <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> opens up, and manifests to his people, his beloved ones: Whereby they anticipate, even in this life, fore∣tastes of the sweet enjoyment of the marriage sup∣per of the Lamb. It was such a discovery as this that made Job say, <HI>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin the worms shall destroy this body; yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and not another.</HI> A view of human na∣ture, united to the son of God, for all the ends and purposes of salvation, not in a mere passive sense,
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>as a redeemer from wrath; but as one that exalts the christian to the highest degree of felicity in the favour of God, must highly rejoice the souls of be∣lievers. When our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> manifests himself in his character, as Emmanuel, God with us, to his people, there is something so engaging in the discovery, that it fills up the whole attention of the mind, and satisfies all the desires of the soul. This discovery affords a great deal more contemplation than a finite capacity is capable of receiving or containing. Who can wholly comprehend this glorious mystery? This <HI>the angels desire to look into</HI> with pleasure: It is like food to their desires, but much more so to those souls who are admitted to view it and see their interest in it.</P>
<P>THE Saviour of sinners, as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> graciously admits his people into a view of the mystery of Godliness; this so delights their souls, and fills their spiritual capacity, that with <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16. they cry out, <HI>Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</HI> There is something in this subject so entertaining, and satisfying to a rational being, given to spiritual contemplation, that of all others it begets the full∣est satisfaction in the soul. The glory of the Di∣vine mercy and goodness shines so illustriously here, that a being, sensible of its own guilt and imper∣fection, cannot but be delighted with the prospect. A relation of blood and kindred with the best of Beings; to be related to the God of heaven, in a nearness of flesh and blood, and have a right to say Emmanuel is our near kinsman, is a joyful consi∣deration.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE opens up the sufficiency and fitness of his death, to procure his people freedom from wrath, and their admission into the Divine favour. This affords a joyful entertainment to the souls of his saints, as it is a salvation from the greatest of evils,
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>and the enjoyment of the greatest good. What can be worse than the displeasure of the Almighty: And what more delightful than his favour and ap∣probation? The apostle speaks in a feeling manner upon this subject: <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect; it is God that justifies, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died:—When we were sinners Christ died for the ungodly:—We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Our Lord and Saviour as the administrator of the new covenant, when he manifests to the christian what the value and the end of his death is, as to him; and shews by the Holy Spirit his special interest therein; he enables him thereby to conclude, <HI>that he shall not die, but live, and discover the works of the Lord,</HI> Psal. cxviii. 17. This is like food and nourishment to his soul, by which he is enabled to run his christian race with joy. The most refined entertainment ne∣ver so much satisfied the delicatest taste, as such a view of the death of <HI>Jesus</HI> satisfies the soul of a true believer. A believing discovery of the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> as the cause of deliverance from spiritual and eternal death, is like a sweet and refreshing cordial to a fainting soul; a view of it as the cause of our admission into the favour of God, is like a plenteous feast to a strong and craving appetite.</P>
<P>THE blood of <HI>Jesus</HI> presented unto the faith of a true believer; or, which is the same thing, to a true persuasion of the sufficiency of his death, and its fitness for all the ends and purposes of salvation, is like a seal whereby the clearest right to an inhe∣ritance is impressed; which has a native tendency to rejoice the mind, and give satisfaction to those who have it. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> affords a lively display of himself, as slain and wounded for his people's transgression. Such a display made the church by the prophet say, Isa. lv. 5. <HI>He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we are healed.</HI> The sufficiency and the fitness of the death of <HI>Christ</HI> for salvation, is like a fund of goodness laid up in store; for it is a sufficient price for all future spiritual en∣joyments; the whole of our future bliss and hap∣piness, is only the reward of this great work; and <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> will thro' all e∣ternity feed his people with a view of the connection between his death, and that happiness they enjoy. The song of the redeemed from among men, is founded upon the death of <HI>Jesus:—Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.</HI></P>
<P>THE death and sufferings of <HI>Christ</HI> is so satisfy∣ing to those who understand it aright, that it be∣gets joy in the mind at every remembrance. It is a continued source of pleasure and delight, to all who see their interest in it: It was the subject of the apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s boasting and glorying, <HI>God for∣bid,</HI> says he, <HI>that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</HI> A literal view of the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> as an article of history, without considering it with a special view to ourselves, by faith of the operation of God, will afford no true satisfaction to our souls. <HI>Jesus</HI> our Saviour, by the powe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Holy Spirit, brings his death near to the souls of his people, and presents it in the Divine testimony as an object of true and spiritual contem∣plation. This is what he presents you with this day in the sacrament of the supper; herein his death is shewed forth to all worthy receivers, and by faith it will become spiritual nourishment to your souls, and tend to your growth in grace, and advancement in holiness. <HI>Jesus</HI> tells his disciples, that <HI>his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed:</HI> That those who received it in a spiritual manner, <HI>should not die, but should live for ever.</HI> A view of the
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>sufficiency and fitness of the death of <HI>Jesus,</HI> must in consequence of all this be very satisfying to the souls of true christians, and a confirmation of the truth of the text, <HI>That the Lamb in the midst of the throne, still feeds his people in the midst of their enemies here below.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST feeds his people with the refreshing influences of his grace: <HI>He leads them beside the still Waters,</HI> Psal. xxiii. 2. Hereby they are enabled to improve all the former instances of his goodness; <HI>he satisfies them with his abundant grace. The Lamb in the midst of the throne leads them to living fountains of waters.</HI> This was the reason why <HI>Christ</HI> was anointed with the <HI>Holy Spirit above measure,</HI> that he might supply his people with grace in the time of their need. The saints in the day of conversion, receive the Spirit as the Spirit of quickening, by which they are <HI>made alive in Christ Jesus:</HI> But <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne, leads them</HI> deeper into the river of consolation. He gives new com∣munications of his grace to bring them forward unto perfection. The first principles of grace with∣out merit from <HI>Christ,</HI> as the head of influences, would decay; but as believers and He are united, he sends them new supplies of his goodness. He makes the river of life run continually into their souls, and refreshes their decaying spirits with the waters of divine consolation.</P>
<P>THEY have access unto the fountain of all goodness through him: Through him, says the apostle, <HI>we have access by one spirit unto the father.</HI> This is the cause of the continuation of their spiri∣tual life: The Spirit liveth and abideth in them. Were they to depend upon their own good endea∣vours for supply, their nourishment would soon come to an end, as the cause is both finite and im∣perfect; but their spiritual nourishment comes from above, from him who hath <HI>received gifts for men,
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>that God the Lord might dwell among them,</HI> Psal. lxviii. 18. As the glorious administrator of the covenant of grace, he bestows upon his church these gifts he hath received in trust, according to the va∣rious needs of the members thereof. When a live∣ly frame and exercise is ready to decay, and die away, he sends his quickening Spirit and revives his Zion, <HI>sends his word and heals her,</HI> Psal. cvii. 20. In all cases, and at all times, he is <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> and will <HI>feed them.</HI></P>
<P>THE last thing in the method was to make some improvement of the subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. HENCE see what believers may expect at a communion table. Seeing <HI>Christ</HI> is the master of the feast, the entertainment will be according to the state of the king. <HI>He is the Lamb in the midst of the throne that is to feed you,</HI> O believing friend of <HI>Christ!</HI> He is vested with full power, and furnished with all fitness and sufficiency. He is Lord of his own house, <HI>and fills all in all;</HI> the whole that can make you happy through eternity is in his hand: <HI>In him doth all fullness dwell:</HI> The treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in him. You can conceive no bliss nor happiness suitable for your souls, but it is in him; for he is infinite, and possesseth all things, and hath promised to give them to you, according to your needs and wants. If you are his, <HI>all things are yours, whether Paul or Apolo, or life, or death, all things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. LEARN what is your duty in view of an ap∣proach unto God in this solemn ordinance: It is to come empty of yourselves, <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne must feed you.</HI> Think not to feed up∣on your experiences, your good endeavours, or for∣mer attainments: These are a deadly poison when substituted in the place of future dependance upon <HI>Christ.</HI> What you expect at the table of the Lord,
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>must not be your own, but <HI>Christ</HI>'s: The Lamb must feed you and provide for you. All is of his own preparing, every thing is a free gift: This <HI>David</HI> witnesseth, Psal. xxiii. 5. <HI>Thou hast prepared a table before me, in the presence of mine enemies.</HI> Think not that you can have any thing to recommend you to God which <HI>Christ</HI> hath not given you. His righ∣teousness is the wedding garment, which only can make you approach acceptably to his table, and it is his own gift: The christian passover is wholly of his preparing.</P>
<P N="3">3. SEE what this communion is which you en∣joy in the sacrament of the supper. It is the same in nature and kind with what the saints in heaven enjoy. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> is the subject and author of both. The saints in heaven are fed with the same spiritual food: They are indeed of a larger capacity than you are in this imperfect state, and are capable of enjoying more of the Divine fulness than you are yet capable of; but they enjoy nothing of a different nature from what you enjoy. They can see farther into <HI>Christ</HI>'s suretyship, the glorious constitution of his person as God in our nature, his death as our redeemer, the fulness of his grace, and the glory of his exal∣tation, than ye can yet do; but you feed upon the same food with the rest of his children: <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> feeds both the church mili∣tant and triumphant.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may see a difference between saints and sinners, in point of satisfaction to their souls. The one feeds upon the flesh and blood of the Son of God; <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne feeds them:</HI> The other feeds upon the sinful pleasures of a present world. They <HI>feed upon husks,</HI> in compari∣son of what the true christian is satisfied with. There is no real satisfaction in the empty pleasures that sinners are satisfied with; there is more of no∣thing
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>than reality in them, when applied to the soul; yea they are worse than nothing, for they are hurtful. The nourishment of the believer's soul is substantial, permanent and lasting. The food of the christian's soul is like its self, spiritual and im∣mortal; lasting as the nature of the soul.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> WE may see the love of God in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> in preparing his christian passover; <HI>God so loved our world as to send his son to die for our sins, that through him we might have everlasting life:</HI> He gave himself to the death that we might live thro' him. Behold the love of God in giving up his Son unto a shameful and ignominious death for men that were his enemies, that they might have life and nourishment to their souls! Behold the love of the Son of God in cheerfully suffering the most exquisite torments that we might have food to our souls! Truly we may say with the Apostle; <HI>Behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God!</HI> This ordinance of the supper is a memorial of love; of the dying love of our dear Redeemer, and ought to be observed with the highest love and regard to him. If he cheerfully died that we might live for evermore, we ought with all our hearts and souls <HI>to love him who loved us, and gave himself for us;</HI> for it is only such as love <HI>Jesus</HI> who will understand the meaning of the text, <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall feed them.</HI></P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Second PART of the SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>REV. vii. 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Lamb in the midst of the throne shall lead them to living fountains of waters, and shall wipe all tears, &amp;c.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the first discourse upon this subject we have taken a view of the administration of our Lord
<PB N="93" REF="97"/><HI>Jesus Christ</HI> towards his church, and shewn how far he answers his title, <HI>as the Lamb in the midst of the throne, in feeding his church and people,</HI> or giving such discoveries unto them as answer the same purpose to the soul as food does to the body.</P>
<P>IT may next be necessary to consider what is meant by <HI>His leading them to living fountains of waters.</HI> Here our Lord's administration may be taken up in a twofold view: First, with respect to the militant members of his church: And in the second place, with respect to those in the church triumphant.</P>
<P>HIS conduct towards his people, in their mili∣tant state, shall be first considered: And in order to the right understanding of what may be said upon this branch of our Lord's administration, it may be necessary to observe a few things, to open the way for what may be said.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be observed that the Almighty, in divine revelation, has exprest his mind anent divine things in such a manner as is suited to our imperfect state and capacity. <HI>Leading,</HI> and <HI>fountains of waters,</HI> are terms that the meanest capacity can understand, and point out that there is some analogy between the conduct of <HI>Christ,</HI> the true shepherd, and shep∣herds among men: <HI>For he leads his people like a flock of sheep,</HI> and refreshes them with divine con∣solation, as with pure water. There will be no occasion to change scripture expressions for fear of men fixing wrong ideas or notions unto them, since there are but few who literally believe and understand similies. When <HI>Christ</HI> is said to <HI>lead his people into living fountains of waters,</HI> few but the prophane will fix a literal meaning to the words. It is true indeed, that a philosopher, or a modern gospeler, would endeavour to avoid these expressions, and shun the phrase, <HI>Leading to living fountains of waters,</HI> as he would do fire, through the whole of
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>his discourse: But whoever endeavours to substitute modern diction in religious discourses, especially in sermons, in the room of scripture phrases, will stand a fair chance to be less understood. They may in∣deed please the vain and giddy, and be popular, be∣cause new; and for this very reason they please Sa∣tan too, who hates the plain manner of teaching used in scripture.</P>
<P>THE scriptures themselves are <HI>the sword of the spirit,</HI> and are most hurtful to the kingdom of Sa∣tan when used in their native simplicity; but when once their doctrines are blunted with men's inven∣tions, like the edge of a sword laid by, they will do little execution.</P>
<P>A MODERN teacher would perhaps say from these words, <Q>That <HI>Jesus,</HI> the best of teachers, has “taught us a perfect system of morals, and left us a pure example; and when we imitate him by observing these rules he hath left us, we advance ”forward in goodness and virtue.</Q></P>
<P>BUT there is as much and more understood by say∣ing, <HI>that he leads his people to living fountains of wa∣ters,</HI> and as easily comprehended by such as read the scriptures. Such as are only acquainted with plays and romances, will not indeed understand the figures of scripture, nor the meaning of the similies there made use of; but those who read the Bible will, in some measure, understand them. There is a differ∣ence between understanding similies literally, and departing from them; nor do we find the most ig∣norant among ordinary readers of scripture, in great danger of believing them so. The Almighty cer∣tainly knew what was the best method to convey divine truths to the souls of men, and has given us palpable examples in divine revelation.</P>
<P N="2">2. I OBSERVE, that this phrase in the text is a figure taken from the case and custom of travel∣lers in the eastern warm climates, (and seems to be
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>a Hebrewism) where guides were made use of to direct travellers in their way, and point out unto them the springs and fountains of water that were needful to refresh them in their journey. It teach∣eth us how dependent we are upon our Redeemer, both in this life and that which is to come, for our comfort and true happiness: And that it is upon his powerful grace we must depend for all we need and expect through eternity. As the pilgrim upon his journey depended upon his guide, so must christians depend upon <HI>Christ;</HI> and as they were directed by their leaders to the fountains and springs of water, by which they were refreshed, and enabled to pursue their jour∣ney, so every true believer shall be directed by <HI>Jesus</HI> to the promises and means of salvation, necessary to comfort their souls in their state of pilgrimage here below. From such a figure of speech or simile, we can as easily understand the nature of <HI>Christ</HI>'s ad∣ministration, as the leader of his people, as we can learn the meaning of any thing we never saw, by demonstration or description. For unless it is af∣firmed, that there is no analogy between our Lord's administration, and that of a guide to a traveller; and between refreshing fountains, and the means of grace, the instruction from the simile will hold good.</P>
<P>THE teaching by similies has been practised by the wisest of men: <HI>Solomon</HI> in his book of <HI>Proverbs,</HI> very often observes this method of teaching. It is not indeed used in argument; for the design of a simile is not to prove what is doubtful, but to clear what is dark. <HI>Solomon,</HI> very successfully ob∣serves this method, Prov. xxvi. 1. <HI>As snow in sum∣mer, and rain in harvest; so honour is not seemly for a fool.</HI> Ver. 14. <HI>As the door turneth upon its hinges, so</HI> doth <HI>the slothful upon his bed.</HI> Chap. xxviii. 15. <HI>As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear;</HI> so is <HI>a wicked ruler over the poor people.</HI> Our Saviour, in his para∣bles,
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>practised this method often, and the prophets give many instances of this manner of instruction; as in <HI>Isa.</HI> v. 1. where the church is compared unto a vineyard. Many of the best heathen writers, both poets and others, abound with this kind of metaphor. The most striking passages in sacred writ are of this kind, as <HI>Psal.</HI> xiv. throughout.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT it is a character very often given to our mediator in scripture, which the apostle gives him here, viz. <HI>a Leader,</HI> as in <HI>Isa.</HI> lv. 4. <HI>Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</HI> Chap. xlviii. 17. <HI>Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the holy one of Israel, I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldst go.</HI> Psal. xxiii. 2. <HI>He leadeth me beside the still waters.</HI> John x. 3. <HI>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</HI> He is said <HI>to lead Joseph like a flock, and to bring or lead his people to the borders of his sanctuary.</HI> From all this it is plain, that such who read the scriptures cannot be ignorant of this character of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our saviour. Neither will it, I think, be necessary to change the phrase in the subsequent part of this discourse.</P>
<P N="4">4. I OBSERVE, that the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, and the ordinances of grace, are very often in divine revelation compared unto <HI>waters, wells,</HI> and <HI>fountains of water.</HI> In <HI>Psal.</HI> xxiii. the blessings of the Holy Spirit are compared to <HI>still waters: Thou leadest me beside the still waters.</HI> To a <HI>river,</HI> Ezek. xlvii. 5. <HI>And it was a river I could not pass over: For the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.</HI> The Holy Spirit that <HI>Christ</HI> bestowed upon his disciples is compared unto a <HI>well of living waters springing up unto eternal life,</HI> John iv. 14. <HI>And whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him, shall never
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.</HI> The means of grace, or the benefits of the covenant of grace, are compared to <HI>wells of water;</HI> Isa. xii. 3. <HI>Therefore with joy shall they draw water out of the wells of salvation. The fountains of living waters</HI> in our text, must therefore be understood of the blessing of the covenant of grace, consisting of all the means that the Holy Spirit makes effectual for salvation in this life, and for glory in that which is to come. I shall now proceed to consider our Mediator's conduct towards his people in their mi∣litant state, expressed under the notion of <HI>leading them to living fountains of waters.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. HE makes them sensible of their wants, and leads them into an understanding of their need of spiritual enjoyments. By either his ordinances, or providences, he makes them sensible that their first condition is a miserable one. Sometimes provi∣dence disappoints their hopes, and renders their most sanguine expectations vain: So that what they promised themselves the greatest happiness in the enjoyment of, is quite taken from them, and they have the desire but not the object. The mind that is naturally full of desire, after one disappoint∣ment, turns itself towards some other object, and lives by hope for a season, till providence as before removes the object and eludes the expectation. Still the cry of the heart is, <HI>who will shew us any good thing;</HI> and the fluctuating mind goes from one temporal object to another in search of happiness and enjoy∣ment, but time after time is disappointed. When these sources fail, the hopeless soul turns serious, engages in a course of religious duties, and seeks comfort in ordinances; and the constant cry now is, <HI>the temple of the Lord.</HI> But no sooner is a form of godliness established, and the soul begins to place its comfort and happiness in external privi∣leges,
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>than ordinances are like worldly enjoyments before, delusionary and vain; afford no solid peace nor pleasure. The spirit of bondage shews the spirit of the law, and that the design of duty and the in∣tention of ordinances, are not to be seen of men but to glorify God. Then the man's conduct appears to him in a worse light than before. He imagines, as is the real case with him, that he is a self-de∣ceiver, and a hypocrite; and that <HI>by seeking to e∣stablish a righteousness of his own, he is not subject to the righteousness of God.</HI> Hence a want of righte∣ousness wherewith he may come before the Lord, mightily perplexes his mind. Sometimes want of sincerity is all the want of righteousness that is yet thought upon.—Then he attempts to be more sincere; strives to bring his mind to a lively and fit frame for devotion, that he may have satisfac∣tion in the exercise of duty, when the end of his pursuit is only for satisfaction to himself, but not to glorify the author of his being. His fear of hy∣pocrisy does not arise so much from an apprehen∣sion that it is dishonouring to God, as that it will provoke him to punish the guilty soul for such so∣lemn dissimulation. But after, by renewed efforts of industry, the man has brought his mind to the conceived measure he would be at, he is ready to conclude he has attained to the desired point of en∣quiry: When behold the mind that never rests in its searches, finds out the error of deficiency in the end. The cause of this is <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> by a new manifestation of the spirit of the law upon the conscience, convincing the person that no action is acceptable that is not directed to a good and holy end. Where to find out a mean to amend this error is not easily found; for the no∣tion of self-importance is natural to every irregene∣rate person, and to get clear of our own importance in the performance of duty, is above the power of
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>corrupt nature. The brightness of legal evidence still increases against the sinner; he sees the com∣mandments true and holy, and the sanction sure; but sinds no will or power to love its holiness, nor a way to evade its curse. A want, a miserable want, now occurs to him; a want of power to keep the law of God, without which he cannot learn how God will be pleased with him. He had already tried to observe the Divine commandments, but found himself far short in both end and motive. Will God accept of another attempt to serve him better, with more sincerity, with a view to his glory? is again suggested, but not so easily concluded upon.</P>
<P>A NOTION of repentance for former sins, and sorrow for past faults and offences, is now deter∣mined, and the man is now all humility, prayer and tears.—This course is pleasing for a season, and the sinner is now busy in making an atonement to God for his former sins and insincerity. But as it is natural for our minds to enquire into future conse∣quences, this laborious penitent cannot long con∣tinue in this course, without enquiring what will be the end, and for what use this repentance is. One thing was neglected at the beginning, which creates more sorrow and trouble in the end: Will God accept of this my repentance for an atonement for my former offences? This is a question that the conscience cannot be long in suspense about, so soon as it looks to God's holy law: For repentance, be it never so sincere, cannot make atonement for sin; because the law of God is infinitely perfect, and the sinner's repentance is but finite.—Besides repen∣tance is nothing, if it is not attended with con∣stancy and uniformity in good actions: And one capital defect in this repentance is, that original sin is not the object of it. Had the man seen the nature of original sin, he would never attempted to
<PB N="100" REF="104"/>please God by repentance, because this root of bit∣terness will marr the success of repentance itself.— For it is impossible for one to repent sincerely, when there is a propensity in their nature against the ve∣ry duty.</P>
<P>NOW, and never till now, did he see the want of original righteousness. The guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s first sin, and the corruption of nature, now marr all his hopes of ever reconciling himself to God; besides, he also sees innumerable imperfections in his most sincere attempts.—<HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> is a very important question, but how to answer it he is unable.—With help he thinks this may be done, but where to find help he knows not. He fears now so much as to look at the law; but conscience having already got the impressions of it stamped there, with all the poison of the curse, there is no getting free of it.—Thus he is <HI>a magor misibib, a terror to himself.</HI> Fears of death now haunt him like a ghost: To die in this condition is really dan∣gerous, and scarcely more so than he apprehends it. A view <HI>of the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> would be a very acceptable perception, but this in wisdom is yet withheld.—He sees a throne of judgment, but not of mercy. The conclusion is that he must perish for all he hath yet seen. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> has all this while been leading him, but in such a manner as <HI>Moses</HI> led <HI>Israel</HI> through the wilderness; where there were many things fearful to behold. This pre∣pares him for the enjoyment of the living waters that he leads him afterwards into. In such ways does <HI>Jesus</HI> sometimes lead his people, when he brings them <HI>to the fountains of living water.</HI> This makes them sensible of their wants, and makes the Divine goodness relish sweetly when it is enjoyed.— Now the soul is sensible of a want of righteousness to justify it, and a want of meetness to make it fit
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>for communion with God. We have observed that ordinances and providences are made use of to make men sensible of their wants.—The word strips the sinner, thus convinced, naked of all de∣fence in himself, and makes him see that all his for∣mer attempts to cover himself with his fig-leaves are vain; <HI>when the commandment comes</HI> powerfully, <HI>sin revives and the man dies.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HE makes known to them his own excel∣lencies and fitness to reconcile them unto God. Nothing can be more agreeable and desirable to a mind under a sense of apprehended wrath and judg∣ment, than the discovery of one <HI>who is able and willing to save.</HI> The gospel of the grace of God reveals that object. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> brings the <HI>glad tidings of peace and great joy</HI> to the sinner's ear, and gives the favourable inti∣mation, that <HI>he is made of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption.</HI> The soul, we observed before, was made sensible of its want of righteous∣ness for acceptance before God. The Redeemer in the gospel says, <HI>Behold I bring near my righteous∣ness, and my salvation shall not tarry.</HI> The appre∣hension of this righteousness, when revealed, is yet beyond the reach of a natural man; and the wisdom and goodness of <HI>Christ</HI> is abundantly manifested in leading his people forward to a dependence upon him, for power to apply his righteousness, as well as to depend upon him for working it out.</P>
<P>WHEN men are brought to a sense of their absolute misery, without <HI>Christ,</HI> and made sensible of their own weakness, it is ordinary to tell them they should embrace him; but could they do this, it would be doing more than even keeping the law perfectly. This is as impossible to that soul that is not changed, as any former duty mentioned. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> must work this work himself; namely, work the power by which
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>they apprehend him. They must be first appre∣hended of him, before they can apprehend him: This is the language of the apostle <HI>Paul, I endea∣vour to apprehend him, of whom I am also apprehended.</HI> The first is an endeavour that flows from the latter. The word of <HI>Jesus</HI> is sent with power to the soul in a more direct manner, and gives strength to it to believe, before there can be any special embra∣cing of him as our Lord. Our appropriating of <HI>Christ</HI> to ourselves, or that special particular faith, which is the privilege of the children of God, is no more but the love of God working in the conscience, and expressing itself by embracing an object it de∣lights in. I indeed sincerely allow of an appropri∣ating faith; but refuse that all the exhortations in the world can effect it; or if it were done in obe∣dience to the commandment and exhortation, could it justify us, otherwise we would be justified by a work of the law.</P>
<P>BOTH the ground and means of our justification are without us, as they are duties: Both are the work of <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne.</HI> None of the scripture commandments to believe, are to be understood as having the promise of justifica∣tion and salvation connected with them, (as these duties are done by us); otherwise our justification would still depend upon ourselves. For when it is said, <HI>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved;</HI> it no doubt implies, that faith is our du∣ty, but will not infer that we can obey it till it be given us. These words shew the necessity of faith, but do not mention the cause of it. <HI>It is not of ourselves, it is the gift of God:</HI> In that phrase we may see the connection between faith and salvation, but cannot learn that faith is an act that we can put forth when we please. The Divine order of faith, but not the Divine cause, is there mentioned. The apostles point out the method of salvation to the
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>jailot, without mentioning unto him the powerful cause, that only could make him comply with that method.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> presents to the soul, in the day of believing, his own righte∣ousness and excellencies, and impresses their fitness so powerfully upon the mind, that it makes way into the heart by melting it. Thus the soul re∣ceives a new form by the power of Divine grace: The evidence of the fitness and goodness of the Redeemer's excellencies for holiness and happiness, makes way into the soul, and changes it as a clear and convincing truth will change one's sentiments, and form their thoughts into a liking for that truth. Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> when he leads his people into the understanding of his own fitness and ex∣cellency, performs a work that no human energy could effect, no persuasion of men produce. All that men can say of him, without the special power of his grace, will make but small impression upon the soul. There is a more direct impulse necessary. The excellencies of <HI>Jesus,</HI> set forth by human com∣mendation, are like the rays of the sun dissipated and scattered; but when impressed by his own more immediate power, are like the rays of the sun con∣tracted into a meniscus or burning glass, that burns as well as gives light. This is expressed by the apostle, <HI>The light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus shining into the soul.</HI> This is a peculiar and special part of <HI>Christ</HI>'s divine administration in <HI>lead∣ing his people.</HI> By this he leads them out of them∣selves to a dependence upon him; and as the love∣liness of his character begets love in their souls, that which is truly called appropriation, is the love of <HI>Christ</HI> in the soul making free with its object. This is an effect of that faith whereby men are justified. Faith is the gift of God, and the appro∣priation of faith is this Divine gift improving or
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>making use of its object. Faith takes hold of the testimony where a Saviour is held forth; but the evidence of the truth of the testimony is first made to shine upon the soul. <HI>The light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus shines into the darkened understand∣ing,</HI> and represents <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to the mind in all his fitness and loveliness. The evidence of the truth of his person and character, determines the soul to rest upon him for salvation. Thus the ap∣propriation follows, not precedes an interest in <HI>Christ.</HI> Our acceptance with God is not founded upon our appropriation of <HI>Christ,</HI> but upon his atonement, which is the meritorious cause of that grace which enables us to believe in him.</P>
<P>THIS administration of the Son of God, in <HI>leading his people to himself,</HI> is full of the greatest wisdom: For unless he drew them, they neither would nor could apprehend him. Therefore he first apprehends them by his spirit; writes the truth in their hearts, and they become his. They are justified before God, and accepted of by him, not because they have received <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> their Lord, but because he hath taken them into a relation to him as their surety. The whole ground of our ac∣ceptance is what <HI>Christ</HI> hath done, both to us and for us, and not what we ourselves have done in any degree. The believing of the Divine record, in which <HI>Christ</HI> is comprehended, is the most rational act the soul can put forth; but it is an act that does not proceed from any natural power that is in the mind, till it be given it by <HI>Jesus.</HI> The power of the word first overcomes the enmity, by represent∣ing a worthy object, before there be any love or de∣sire in the soul towards a Saviour; <HI>Jesus</HI> in all his lovely excellencies is brought near in a word of truth, and this like a seal is imprinted upon the soul, and gives it a new form. It is the soul thus formed new that applies <HI>Jesus</HI> for comfort, as contained in the tes∣timony
<PB N="105" REF="109"/>of the word. But this after-comfort, is only an effect of the principle of faith before implanted by the spirit of the gospel, or is faith working by love. It is a confounding of justification with a work of sanctification, to affirm that men must ap∣propriate <HI>Christ</HI> to themselves before they can be justified, or making our sanctification the ground and reason of our acceptance with God: For it is certain whoever is able to receive <HI>Christ,</HI> must have power, and that power must be given them, which is no more but enabling the soul to act according to the word of God. Therefore it follows from this, that men are accepted not on the account of <HI>Christ</HI>'s atonement, but on the account of the work of the Spirit in sanctification; whereas the aposto∣lic doctrine runs, <HI>whom he justifies, them he also sanc∣tifies.</HI> The Divine connection observed in the con∣duct of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in saving his people, and lead∣ing them to everlasting happiness, is worthy of our most serious attention. When sinners are justified, they are said to be justified by <HI>the redemption that is in Jesus;</HI> by having an interest therein: This in∣terest they obtain by faith: This faith they have by free gift, and not of themselves: So when faith accepts of the atonement for justification, it is no more but the spirit of <HI>Jesus</HI> enabling the soul to observe the connection established in the covenant of grace. Here is no foundation for human pride or boasting, since the power by which this connec∣tion is observed, is not men's own, but the gift of God working in their conscience, or the <HI>love of Christ constraining</HI> the soul to receive the atonement.</P>
<P>IT is still evident that our justification, both as to cause, and immediate means, as to beginning and end, is the work of <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne.</HI> That faith that is established in the con∣nection of means in the covenant of grace, without which we cannot be justified, is wrought in the soul
<PB N="106" REF="110"/>by the power of God. The apostle tells us, <HI>He works in us the work of faith with power.</HI> When <HI>Christ</HI> makes known his own excellencies and fit∣ness to the souls of his people, like a true loadstone he draws out their love to him, and brings them near; <HI>the love of Christ constrains them:</HI> So their acts of faith and love, are only effects of that <HI>constraining love of Christ</HI> impressed upon the soul. These acts of faith that are so often mentioned in some treatises, and required of men before they be justified, are ra∣tionally accounted for; only, by rightly understand∣ing the administration of <HI>Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne who leads his people.</HI> The ap∣propriation of <HI>Christ</HI> for salvation, is just the same thing with <HI>do and live,</HI> unless we understand this as the effect of his own power in his new covenant admi∣nistration. Before ever a fallen sinner can accept of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for justification, the Redeemer must first take possession of the heart, and by the glory of his divine excellencies captivate the soul. This is an act of his kingly power whereby he subdues the soul to the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne leads his people to himself,</HI> by such a glorious display of his excellencies and fitness to reconcile them unto God, that the evidence that attends this display of his glory, captivates the heart, and fills the whole soul with love.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne leads his</HI> militant members through many trials and afflic∣tions after they become his. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> told his disciples, <HI>that such as followed him, must also take up their cross, and deny themselves.</HI> It is the constant doc∣trine of the New Testament, <HI>that them that live god∣ly in this world shall suffer persecution.</HI> By afflic∣tions and trials in this life, the <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> are made meet for that which is to come. <HI>Jesus</HI> leads all his followers in the same path that he himself
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>walked in; and as <HI>the captain of their salvation was made perfect through sufferings,</HI> so must all those who are his sincere followers. The <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> are best known by their resignation to suffering and self-denial. When men are followers of religion, when every advantage attend-it, the lovers of the world, and the lovers of <HI>Christ</HI> are not easily dis∣tinguished. That religion that has no cross attend∣ing it, bears not the marks of the apostolic reli∣gion: For the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> says of himself, <HI>that bonds and persecution awaited him in every place.</HI> The cross of <HI>Christ</HI> is intended for his people's very great ad∣vantage: To keep them in constant dependence up∣on him, and <HI>to stain the pride of all human glory.</HI> By these two the primitive christians were distinguished from the world; namely, the patient <HI>bearing of the cross, and denying themselves.</HI> They rejoiced that <HI>they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus Christ;</HI> and denied themselves the ease and carnal pleasure, that was obtained by compliance with the world. Their esteem of religion proceed∣ed from their love to its author, and not from these appendages that worldly men afterwards connected with it. Had they had an inclination to have en∣joyed the advantages that afterwards many connec∣ted with christianity, they might no doubt have had their own share; but they were sensible that this was incompatible with what <HI>Jesus</HI> had told them, of the cross and self-denial. The many suf∣ferings these first christians were exposed unto, arose from their non-conformity to the reigning customs; and it was a special evidence of their self-denial, when they could for the sake of <HI>pure and undefiled religion</HI> forego the smiles of the world, and the allure∣ments of pre-eminence, wealth, and esteem. It is the certain way to the crown of everlasting life, to walk in the way of self-denial and afflictions. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> never led his people
<PB N="108" REF="112"/>in any other path. Tho' religion, falsly so called, has had its own time of reigning under the protec∣tion of civil power, yet <HI>Christ</HI>'s kingdom never was of this world. Those reigning systems that were attended with worldly advantages, power, and pre-eminence, were palpable deviations from the apos∣tolic system. <HI>Christ</HI> never intended power and preference as the privilege of his followers; but assured them that <HI>they should be hated of all men for his name's sake,</HI> which was a part of the cross they were to bear.—And instead of accepting places of power and advancement, they were <HI>to deny them∣selves</HI> to these allurements, as <HI>pertaining to the king∣doms of this world,</HI> of which they were to be civil subjects, but never religious rulers or lords.</P>
<P>THE <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> must not think when they become his, that then the smiles of providence, and the approbation of every devotee to the name of christianity, will be their privilege: The contrary they must expect. If they become true children of God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ, false brethren, mothers, chil∣dren, will hate them.</HI> This is often the heaviest branch of the christian's cross, <HI>to be despised and hated</HI> by those who have as high pretensions to religion as themselves. An instance of this we have in the case of <HI>David,</HI> Ps. xlii. 3. <HI>My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? When I remember these</HI> things, <HI>I pour out my soul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them into the house of God.</HI> Self-denial has always been accounted, as it really is, a singula∣rity in religion. Such as join the notions of chris∣tianity and worldly esteem and advantage together, have ever since the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> looked upon self-denial and the cross of <HI>Christ</HI> with an evil eye.</P>
<P>THE excellent few who could not be conformed to the world, because their consciences would not allow them, and their love to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> directed
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>them otherwise, have been looked upon as foolish sticklers for unnecessary singularities. The men who loved to model the kingdom of <HI>Jesus</HI> into the form of the kingdoms of this world, have al∣ways esteemed the plain simple followers of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as conscientious fools, who would not lay down the cross of <HI>Christ</HI> when better offers were made them. It was <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> that kept them from embracing a religion that was not his, but a creature of worldly power, and led them through all the reproaches of such as called themselves by the magnificent name of the CHRISTIAN WORLD.</P>
<P>WHEN men are truly converted to the religion of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> they are deceived if they expect that he will lead them in the way of worldly e∣steem: <HI>They must follow the footsteps of his flock, and go forth without the camp, bearing reproach for the name of Christ;</HI> and with the apostle, <HI>count all things but loss and dung, that they may win Christ, and be found in him, not having their own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is of God by faith.</HI></P>
<P>THIS branch of the Redeemer's administration, is that whereby he keeps up the distinction between his children and the children of this world. Self-denial is the truest mark of a follower of <HI>Christ;</HI> for it is directly opposite to that notion of self-im∣portance and dependence, that is the leading prin∣ciple of the self-righteous of every character: It is the hardest lesson in the whole christian scheme for men to learn. There are very many who pre∣tend to follow <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> that are like the woman mentioned in <HI>Isa.</HI> iv. 1. who want only <HI>to be called by his name,</HI> but love to support the notion of their own independence; <HI>these have a name to live, but are really dead.</HI> The true sincere <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> are led to depend upon him for all things; <HI>for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</HI></P>
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
<P>THOSE whom <HI>the Lamb leadeth</HI> are denied to their highest attainments, and only depend upon that first grace which distinguished them from the world. Their right to happiness, and their walk∣ing in peace, they attribute to that unchangeable word <HI>that passeth not away,</HI> which first gave them life, and still supports them in it. The religious, or rather the superstitious world, who are power∣fully governed by the notion of independence, ge∣nerally lay a mightly stress upon their attainments, and reckon themselves intitled to a higher degree of the favour of the Deity than others, because they can give a better account of their attainments, and lay a greater weight upon what they call experien∣ces, than upon that invariable testimony which contains the substance of both their happiness and the ground of their faith. They are so far from <HI>denying themselves,</HI> that, the higher their notions of their own attainments are, they are the more proud. This is evidenced from their sovereign contempt of others, who cannot say that they have gone through the same exercise with them. <HI>The followers of the Lamb,</HI> in the apostolic times, <HI>who were led by him,</HI> founded their esteem of themselves and others upon that one profession of faith in <HI>Jesus,</HI> and the similitude of the tenor of their lives to that profes∣sion. Their love was founded upon that which was visible to every one, namely, their profession of their faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> and the working thereof by love; and not upon what no man can see so as to be certain of. Whoever adhered unto the same testimony of truth, which was visible without them, and lived according to its purity, were the objects of their esteem.</P>
<P>THEY did not set up their own attainments and experiences as the standard to others, and the rule of their love and esteem of them; but the Divine testimony which <HI>Jesus</HI> had left them. They
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>loved those who loved <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and evidenced their love by embracing his true religion. The whole rule of their love of others was without them, not within them. They left men's hearts to him <HI>who searcheth the hearts of the sons of men,</HI> and lived only from external evidence. Their love was ca∣tholic and universal towards all who profest the common faith of christians, so long as they conti∣nued in obedience to that faith; but they extended not their esteem to any, differing from them in the faith of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whatever pretensions they had to attainments and experience in religion. As they acknowledged but <HI>one Lord,</HI> so they had but <HI>one faith</HI> which <HI>wrought by love</HI> to all who profest it.</P>
<P>THESE primitive <HI>followers of the Lamb,</HI> were solely directed in all their actions by those rules their Lord and Saviour had given them. They denied themselves to dependence upon human pre∣tensions or inventions. The <HI>sure word of prophecy,</HI> was the foundation to them of the exercise of every christian grace or virtue. Modern times have pro∣duced a christian world, but the primitive christians always kept themselves distinct from the world, and looked upon the world and christianity as having separate interests.</P>
<P>THE account that christians could give of their adherence to the faith of <HI>Jesus</HI> in the gospel, and not an account of so many convictions and round∣about workings of the human mind, was the rule they judged of men by. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> taught them to deny all these, as a part of that selfish disposition that sets itself in opposition to the gospel. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> teaches men to rest upon the word, as the true ground of <HI>hope, faith, and assurance;</HI> but to rest upon no man's account of his own frame and disposition. Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> himself never required of any to believe in him for his inward frame and disposition, but on
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>account of his works: <HI>If I do not the works which no other man can do, believe me not.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an eminent degree of self-denial, to have no dependence upon these things which to us may seem our best and most spiritual actions or exer∣cises. The great leader of the New Testament, leads all his sincere followers to depend upon him <HI>for all things,</HI> in opposition unto our own best en∣deavours and performances. This to many will appear no small affliction and trial, and certainly is an high degree of self-denial; but <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> will bring his people out of all such affliction at last.</P>
<P>HOWEVER unfavourable like the cross of <HI>Christ</HI> may appear to worldly men, and however unreason∣able self-denial may seem to the devotees of inde∣pendence, yet according to the New Testament none are <HI>the followers of the Lamb,</HI> but such as <HI>take up their cross and deny themselves.</HI> The world ever thought the bearing of the cross and self-denial disagreeable lessons to learn. That self-esteem and love to wealth and pre-eminence, that is so natural to the men of this world, will always resist men's inclinations to <HI>bear the cross and deny themselves.</HI> Those that were the leaders of the fashion in the primitive times, like those who are their successors still, were no doubt surprised to see men <HI>sell their possessions,</HI> and distribute them for the supply of needy christians. Such a mark of self-denial was no doubt then, as it still is, an eminent piece of foolish sin∣gularity in the eyes of the wise men of this world. The followers of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> had their affections <HI>set upon things that are above,</HI> and could the more easily part with those things that are below. Yet for men to part with <HI>possessions, houses and lands, wives and children,</HI> for the sake of religion, and be ac∣counted fools for it after all, was such a degree of self denial that the primitive periods only produced.
<PB N="113" REF="117"/><HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> enabled his con∣fessors and followers to despise these temporal things, by filling their souls with the comfort of the Holy Ghost. <HI>He led them to living fountains of wa∣ters,</HI> made them receive the Holy Ghost, which so filled their souls with joy and delight, that they thought little of all worldly advantages and esteem.</P>
<P>THE Divine joy and comfort with which their souls were filled, wrought so powerfully in their minds, that their cross seemed light and easy, and self-denial and suffering was to them rather <HI>a crown of rejoicing,</HI> than <HI>burdensome and grievous.</HI> Then christians understood religion in its own native light, as distinct from the world, and had no am∣bition for what they were persuaded was never de∣signed them. The life of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> they made choice of for their pattern, who in all his life-time in this world kept himself distinct from its manners, pleasures, and allurements; who said of himself, <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head.</HI> So long as christians followed him, they were like him, in denying themselves these pleasures and ad∣vantages that belong only to the world. But after men began to vary from the example of <HI>Christ,</HI> the question that was once in agitation amongst the disciples, <HI>who should be greatest?</HI> became the chief enquiry of those called christians.—And now instead of <HI>following the Lamb,</HI> in <HI>bearing the cross, and deny∣ing themselves,</HI> men professing his religion contend∣ed with the powers of the world for power and pre∣ference: Till at last the christian religion became so like the world that they interchanged names, and christianity got the new appellation of the CHRISTIAN WORLD.</P>
<P>BUT whatever trials and afflictions may arise to the follower of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> from the want of these temporal things, <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>leads them</HI> thro' these difficulties, and by the com∣forts of the Holy Spirit, these <HI>fountains of living waters</HI> make up the want of all these left-hand blessings. By electing them into the secrets of his covenant, and supporting them with the sweets of the promises, he leads them on to the borders of his sanctuary, to <HI>the tabernacle that his own right-hand hath pitched for them</HI> in his kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. ANOTHER branch of <HI>Christ</HI>'s administration as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> towards his church in her militant state is, that <HI>he leads his peo∣ple through death.</HI> We have abundant evidence that death is the common lot of mankind from a long and striking experience of good and bad:— <HI>The wise man dieth, and the brutish also:</HI>—And <HI>Job</HI> tells us, <HI>that there is an appointed time for man upon earth:</HI>—And the apostle, <HI>it is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment:</HI> But why <HI>good men should die,</HI> for whom <HI>the Son of God laid down his life,</HI> seems not so easy to be accounted for. Should I affirm that sincere believers in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> do not die, if we understand death in its proper meaning, it will perhaps be nearest the doctrine of the New Testament. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> who died for them, only <HI>leads them through death.</HI> It is only like a stage in their journey, which they must pass thro', but do not abide in. The a∣postle, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> iv. 14. compares death to a <HI>sleep,</HI> so far as it extends to believers:—<HI>Them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him:</HI> The prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> compares it to a place of rest:—<HI>They shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.</HI> This change of believers, takes the name of death from its common likeness to the death of others, and hath received the common denomination from its common external appearance. But in truth, is only like the beginning of life to the <HI>followers of the Lamb.</HI> The <HI>living fountains of waters</HI> which <HI>the
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>Lamb leads his followers into,</HI> makes them <HI>live for ever.</HI> The leader himself says to his disciples, <HI>He that drinketh of the waters that I shall give him, shall not die.</HI> The <HI>Psalmist</HI> compares death only to a <HI>shadow</HI> that he was to pass through: <HI>When I pass through the valley and shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou</HI> art <HI>with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>THE reason why <HI>the followers of the Lamb die</HI> is, that they may be true followers of him, and be exalted from the same low degree of humiliation. He leads them through death, that they may see all the excellencies of his death and sufferings; that they may behold that which is most formidable to human nature in the most intimate manner, and see that it is by the death of <HI>Jesus</HI> divested of its sting. Every true christian, by passing through death, sees experimentally that <HI>Jesus</HI> hath overcome it; and what they were by faith persuaded of before, they now sensibly experience <HI>The Lamb leads them thro' death</HI> that they may be sharers of that victory which he obtained over it, and really find that it has no power. By leading them through death, he gives them occasion to triumph with the apostle, <HI>O death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy victory!</HI></P>
<P>WERE christians transported to heaven with∣out going thro' death, it would be a great disad∣vantage to them: For they could not know by ex∣perience that what is so frightful to human nature, is by the death of <HI>Jesus</HI> made so easy, and conse∣quently there would be a defect in their experience. Death to the followers of <HI>Jesus</HI> is not an immediate effect of the curse, but a part of that conformity to their Saviour which they attain unto by following him.—Thus it is a privilege, not a disadvantage. The apostle informs us, <HI>that death possed upon all men, for all had sinned;</HI> but this refers unto the sen∣tence
<PB N="116" REF="120"/>of condemnation that was upon all men on account of their being descendents of the first <HI>Adam</HI> under the curse of the law.—But <HI>the followers of the Lamb</HI> are freed from condemnation, on the account of his being <HI>made a curse for them:</HI>—And <HI>there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI>—Therefore death to them does not flow from the curse of the law; nor do they die so much because they have sinned, but because it is a part of their conformity to <HI>Jesus, to walk in the same path that he walked in.</HI></P>
<P>THAT christians may have a true experience how easy the way to heaven and happiness is, on the account of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> having gone before them in it, they must follow him thro' every stage or the way, that they may admire him in all that he hath done. <HI>The Lamb leads his followers thro' death,</HI> not from any necessity arising from death's claim upon them; but that he may <HI>change their vile bodies,</HI> and as it were leave their fleshly garments in the ward∣robe of the grave, to be raised up new <HI>shining rai∣ments</HI> at <HI>the resurrection of the just. Jesus Christ leads his people thro' death,</HI> that they may see all that it can do unto them, and receive from them all that is its own. Nothing that pertains to a chris∣tian belongs to death, but their <HI>earthly house of this tabernacle,</HI> which it only can dissolve, but not de∣stroy; for there is nothing about the christian that is properly his that can die.—Even his body which is laid in the grave does not die (if we speak pro∣perly) but <HI>rests.</HI> By passing thro' death, <HI>the follow∣er of the Lamb</HI> sees the whole of its power, and its design to him. It as it were catches all his gar∣ments but cannot touch himself.</P>
<P>WHAT may properly be termed the believer's self, passes through death untouched, and his body which he leaves behind him rests in peace, but is not detained like a prisoner. When he passes through
<PB N="117" REF="121"/>death he sees the advantage of the death of <HI>Jesus,</HI> that hath destroyed that enemy, and taken away its sting. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> in this part of his administration, lets his children see how perfectly he hath freed them from the curse; that no part of the threatning of the law can hurt them. Death was the threatning denounced against men for sin, but now they see that there is no danger in it <HI>to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI> It is only <HI>the shadow of death</HI> to them. Now they go through it in triumph, saying, <HI>O death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy victory! The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law; but thanks be to God who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>I PROCEED now to consider the administra∣tion of <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> to∣wards his church and people, in their trium∣phant state in the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> sets them free from all the causes and effects of sin and sorrow. The very being of sin being now removed, there is no such bitter exercise as repentance and sorrow for sin.—No fears haunt these regions of bliss, be∣cause no vestiges of sin remain, nor can enter there: No apprehensions of Divine anger are there, be∣cause the love and favour of God doth for ever shine upon that happy society. The light of the Divine countenance that shines for ever bright in these happy mansions excludes all darkness, doubts, and perplexities. Every evil cause is now remo∣ved, and no bad effects are either feared or felt in the new <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The seeds and principles of woe and sorrow are now totally removed, and no bitter fruits of contrition and compunction for sin, are ever experienced in heaven.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST their Lord, gives them the full sense of true liberty. Their consciences that before, in
<PB N="118" REF="122"/>their best condition, were liable to be impressed with apprehensions of wrath for sin and short-coming, and to be stained with guilt, have now the fullest sense of assured bliss.</P>
<P>THEIR liberty consists now in being freed from all fear: For the perfection of love casts it all out. They have also the fullest desires to serve God and the Lamb: The apostle tells us <HI>they rest not day nor night, but sing hallelujahs to him that sits upon the throne and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>living fountains of waters</HI> that overflow in heaven, these glorious outlettings of Divine love fill the souls of the followers of the Lamb with a sweet sense of Divine liberty; a sense of guilt, or ap∣prehensions of Divine anger, or fears of tempta∣tions overcoming virtue, make the christian even in his best state, not to serve with that liberty he will do when all these are removed. In heaven believers experience the truest and fullest sense of liberty: They feel their consciences disentangled from all apprehensions of either sinning or suf∣fering.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE leads them to the most full and intimate communion with God. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> presents his followers <HI>before God without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing:</HI> And leads them into such an immediate knowledge and acquaintance with the Deity, as supersedes the necessity of enquiry into his charac∣ter by means as formerly.—This is expressed by the apostle by the emphatic phrase of, <HI>seeing face to face, and knowing as we are known.</HI> That com∣munion which men enjoy with God in this life con∣sists in the knowing and understanding his charac∣ter by the means he hath appointed.—It is like a communion kept up by distant correspondence, in a testimony brought near by messengers, where the amiable character of <HI>Jehovah</HI> is so lively drawn that it affects the heart, and begets a similitude of
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>sentiment.—But the communion that the Lamb leads his followers into, resembles personal acquaint∣ance, where all the charms of immediate vision and fruition are enjoyed. The God of love now shines forth in the radiance of his lovely nature to the souls of beings made meet to enjoy his endeared embraces.</P>
<P>THE scripture sets forth this blessed communion in a bold and striking view; <HI>as beholding the light of the Divine countenance; reigning for ever and ever with him; eating and drinking in his presence:</HI> All which point out the most full and intimate fellow∣ship. They do not now view God through the lattice of ordinances in an imperfect manner: They see the very brightness of his countenance. They have the most intimate knowledge of him; for <HI>they see him as he is,</HI> and love him according to that understanding they have of him, which is perfect. The whole capacity of their soul is filled with the blessed discoveries they have of the Deity. When we consider that all infirmities are now removed, all prejudices rooted out of the soul, and add to this that the object of all true joy and delight is repre∣sented without any dark shadows or intervening means, the communion must be most full and com∣prehensive.</P>
<P>OUR conceptions of this communion in this life are but very faint and inadequate, and we would have had no just views of what it is in a future state at all, if it had not been revealed unto us; but from the New Testament description of it we may gather that it will far transcend our present notions of it. When we conceive of an immediate intercourse with God, we are obliged to subtract from our conceptions every imperfection which at∣tend human intercourse, and leave room for some∣thing yet unknown. For the apostle tells us, <HI>that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>into the heart of man to conceive what God hath laid up for them who fear him.</HI> There will, no doubt, in another life be discoveries made to the saints, as much above their present comprehension, as that state is above the present.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE affords them the most pure and successive joy arising from the sense of this communion. What before they only had a right unto, they now have a full enjoyment of, and they are now admitted to <HI>drink of the fountain of life, of the rivers of pleasure at God's right-hand.</HI> In their militant state, christi∣ans are often in <HI>heaviness through manifold tempta∣tions;</HI> their joy is frequently intermitted; but in that state of perfection, their hope is perfect, and the truest and fullest sense of a present and lasting enjoyment of the highest good, affords the most pure and constant joy. The <HI>Psalmist</HI> expresses the spring of this joy under the notion of <HI>a pure foun∣tain, Psal.</HI> xxvi. 9. that is free of all mixture. And as the cause of this joy is eternally the same, so it is constant and successive. That glorious object that gave them sometimes such delight and satisfaction at a distance, will no doubt fill their souls with ex∣ceeding great joy, when they are brought so near as <HI>to see face to face,</HI> as the apostle expresses it. The invariableness of the object, and the refined capa∣city of their soul, will make them fit to enjoy a suc∣cessive fulness of joy. The very suitableness of the object to the mind, and its being capable to enjoy it, must create a constant pleasure. The sweetness of that communion, and the fulness of it, must create a constant satisfaction. Its sweetness creates delight, and its fulness and permanency make it lasting.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> is the con∣stant medium through which everlasting joy flows to every one of his redeemed children; and by bringing them to that state where the Divine glory
<PB N="121" REF="125"/>shines most remarkably through, or in his face, he for ever solaces them with a complete vision and fruition of the highest good. This joy flows from the constant excellency and beauty they behold <HI>shining in the face of Jesus,</HI> which they are admitted to see for ever through eternity. The <HI>Psalmist</HI> ex∣presseth this joy, and the cause of it, in strong and emphatical language, Psal. xvi. 11. <HI>In thy presence is fulness of joy, and at thy right-hand are pleasures for evermore.</HI>—This bliss and happiness is attributed to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as the author of it, as all men's views of God in heaven will constantly, will for ever, be thro' him; and our everlasting peace with God will come thro' our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> No other views will men have of God, but such as come through his well-beloved Son. This blessed communion, in which all their happiness consists, affords the most pure and refined joy in a continued succession of raptures: The more of God they behold, the far∣ther they see into the nature and extent of his Di∣vine perfections: The more of his love and grace they understand, the fuller will their joy be. Joy is the triumph of the soul, or the way that it ex∣presses its love and delight in the object it loves. When <HI>Jesus</HI> reveals the wonderful depths of the love of <HI>Jehovah</HI> to the glorified hosts above, the scene is so engaging, the sight so attracting, and withal the glory of the Divine love so filling and satisfying to a glorified soul, that it cannot but be ravished with the discovery. It even overcame the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in this present world, when he began to contemplate the depths thereof, it led him out into a transport of joy; <HI>O the height! and depth! the length! and breadth of the love of God! it passeth all finding out.</HI> If such a partial communion and enjoyment in a militant state, threw <HI>Paul</HI> into such raptures, what must the overflowing depths above, in the ocean of bliss, do to those whom <HI>the Lamb
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>in the midst of the throne</HI> leads into all the ravishing discoveries of Divine fulness of love, grace and mercy. It is the successive joy arising from the continued communion with God, that fills their mouths with constant praises, and their tongues with songs of everlasting joy. If we consider <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as an active Being, a person in the same activity of character as when he was in this world, we must no doubt conceive him still engaged in doing his Father's business. As it was his busi∣ness while here <HI>to shew the Father</HI> to his followers and disciples, we must not think but when he brings them to heaven, but he will still more fully discover him unto them. Heaven is certainly a place of ac∣tion, tho' the Divine employment there is an ever∣lasting rest, as none of the inhabitants are wearied with their labour. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> performs an active part in that happy situa∣tion, <HI>and leads his people</HI> into still more full <HI>fountains of joy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> wipes away all their reproaches that have been unjustly cast upon them. In this present life reproaches, like tears to a fair countenance, may darken a fair character; may make innocence appear as it were in her mourning robes. <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>reproach had near broke his heart.</HI> Tho' an innocent person may comfort himself under reproach, that he is innocent, yet it is often to him that others are imposed upon, and his usefulness in a great measure marred. Tho' integrity will stand the test and come off victorious, yet it often happens that a man's usefulness is hin∣dered by means of these unjust reproaches.</P>
<P>IN heaven these reproaches are wiped away, and innocence made to appear in all its fair and beauti∣ful charms. As the Almighty <HI>puts the tears of his people in his bottle,</HI> as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> expresseth it, and remembers his children's reproaches, so at last he
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>will wipe them away, to their everlasting vindica∣tion and eternal comfort. The scandalous tongue, that like a poisoned arrow fixed in the reputation of the innocent, shall be wrapt up in flames of fire, and the patient sufferer set free from its scandal. That obliquy that bore hard upon them in this life, God shall throw into the bottomless pit, and every piece of unjust scandal into <HI>the lake that burns with fire and brimstone.</HI> These vipers that fixt in the cha∣racter of the saints, like that which fixt upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s hand, shall be shaken off into everlasting fire; yea these temptations that <HI>Satan</HI> hath often laid before the people of God, and urged their compliance with, and tempted them again to believe they did yield, shall all of them be removed from their ac∣count, and added to his own crimes. Evey blot shall be wiped from their character, and they <HI>shall appear before God without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.</HI></P>
<P>THE last thing in the method was to make some improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may learn that all the titles of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> are full of true signification. He is called <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> and the answers his title exactly. He was a spotless sin-offering, <HI>holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners; without guile, nor was sin found in his mouth.</HI> In this character he bore the punishment of our sin; and as the Paschal Lamb was a sacrifice, whose blood saved the <HI>Israelites</HI> from temporal judgments, so the blood of <HI>the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world,</HI> and delivers believers from spiritual and eternal death.—This title carries more in it than mere al∣lusion; it also denotes his real fitness <HI>to save his peo∣ple from their sins:</HI> It shews what character he bore when here, and still sustains in his exalted state. It shews that there was a real translation of guilt upon him: This <HI>John</HI> intimates when he says, <HI>Be∣hold
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!</HI> I know that some who have gained the ap∣probation and attention of the fashionable world, alledge that guilt is personal, and cannot be im∣puted to the innocent, and that vicarious punish∣ment or atonement, is contrary to the goodness of God, which cannot make innocence suffer: But as these of that persuasion form a character to the De∣ity after their own imagination, which is not to be found in scripture; and conceive what he should be, but do not hold by his own description of his cha∣racter, it is no wonder the death of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as an atonement is foolishness to them. Nothing is more evident from the scripture, than the notion of vi∣carious punishment:—<HI>He bore our sins on his own body on the tree:—He was made sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</HI> We are not obliged to account to these monopolizers of reason, why the Deity made <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> sin, or made him suffer for our sins; but on∣ly reply, that the whole scripture is full of this doc∣trine, and if it is wrong, they know whom to chal∣lenge. Were there not a true significancy in this title of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> all the Old Testament saints have been in a great error, by trusting to unsigni∣ficant types; and the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> does not seem to have understood them right, when he says, <HI>that all the fathers passed under the cloud, and they all passed through the sea; that they all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink: For they drank of the rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. Jesus Christ</HI> answers his type not merely for the sake of form, but for the end of salvation:— That both the Old and New Testament saints might <HI>be freed from the curse of the law,</HI> and that <HI>a sure ground of hope</HI> might be laid for all future believers.</P>
<P>WITHOUT considering <HI>Jesus</HI> as <HI>the slain Lamb of God,</HI> and <HI>the atonement for our sins,</HI> there can be no
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>relief for a guilty conscience severely prest with e∣very reason of despair. Every sense of guilt and imperfection will press hard upon the mind, and every view of the Divine character in its purity and perfection, will enforce the reasons of despair, till the soul either totally despond, or seek a refuge in future non-existence.</P>
<P>IT is only a firm persuasion of the truth of <HI>Christ</HI>'s propitiation as <HI>the Lamb of God,</HI> with which the De∣ity has declared his satisfaction, that will satisfy the conscience of a sinner in his dying moments. And tho' many who have professed to discredit this truth, and have founded the ground of their ac∣ceptance upon their repentance and sincere endea∣vours, have tried to make a shift to die decently like philosophers and good men; yet notwithstanding, as much often transpires to the world as to shew the deceitfulness of their pretensions, and how weak their hopes of future happiness are.</P>
<P>IF the title of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> has signification, and there be truth in the atonement, then all who trust therein have certainty of eternal life and happiness; but on the other hand, all at best is merely probable, a pure peradventure. God is indeed good, but he bestows his goodness according <HI>to the good pleasure of his will:</HI> This is the rule of the communication of his goodness and mercy to any. The adversa∣ries of the atonement dare not say that God neces∣sarily bestows his goodness upon his creatures, o∣therwise they cannot deprive devils of their own share; for they are his creatures as well as men. The way of enjoying mercy and goodness from God is only through the atonement of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> In <HI>Jesus,</HI> his perfect character shines with resplendent glory: There every attribute of his na∣ture is perfectly illustrated: <HI>Mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss one another.</HI> The
<PB N="126" REF="130"/><HI>wisdom of men,</HI> that is <HI>foolishness with God,</HI> is ready to raise the laugh and irrefragable smile, at supposing any variance among the Divine attri∣butes; but notwithstanding of their ridicule, and blasphemous laugh, according to God's revealed character exhibited in the scriptures, his attributes cannot agree should he save men without an atone∣ment: And all his dispensations towards men since the beginning of the world, declare that salvation to sinners was always intended through an atone∣ment. Nothing could make this necessary but the honour of the Divine character, and the glory of the attributes of God: For had the Deity intended to make sinners happy at the expence of his truth, justice, and righteousness, there was no need for <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> at all. And it would be still more un∣accountable, to make a holy innocent person suffer for no reason at all, but mere arbitary pleasure, when neither love to men, nor any necessity from his own character obliged him to it. Religion may here turn the ridicule upon her adversaries, and ask what was the reason that the Deity made <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> suffer pain and agony of the severest kind, when he had never sinned, nor given the least offence to any:—When he had received the fullest testimony of the Divine approbation twice from the excellent glory: <HI>This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.</HI> Is not this to set the Divine at∣tributes at variance: To exclude goodness and justice, and represent the Deity as a being possessed of wanton cruelty? Such a character as this, one may justly form to a <HI>Nero,</HI> a <HI>Caligula,</HI> or a <HI>Domiti∣an,</HI> who out of wantonness and arbitrary cruelty, ex∣posed the primitive christians to the severest torture, when they could lay nothing to their charge that was blame-worthy.</P>
<P>To make <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> suffer such pain and tor∣ture when he had the most evident approbation of
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>innocence, and had done nothing amiss, is to give such a character of the Deity, as is only consistent with the worst of beings. But when we consider <HI>the Lamb of God</HI> suffering for the sins of an elect world, that they may enjoy eternal life, and that all the attributes of God may be glorified in their hap∣piness; a consistent character given to the Almigh∣ty: Here noble and excellent ends are proposed, and what otherwise was impossible, is rendered pos∣sible; and what was inconsistent, made agreeable. No objections can be justly brought against the real significancy of our Redeemer's title; pride only finds them out. Human pride only cannot see the need and usefulness of a satisfaction. The a∣tonement of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> sets all men on the same footing in point of acceptance with God, which hath produced no little chagrin among the votaries of human excellence, and the devotees of self-de∣pendence. The very great enmity that the world shewed against <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> arose from the consider∣ation that his life and doctrine, death and sufferings, were a check upon the pride of men, and designed <HI>to stain the pride of all glory.</HI> The proud and haughty <HI>Jews</HI> were offended at the meek and low∣ly <HI>Jesus,</HI> because he judged them to hell for their haughtiness and pride. They understood his cha∣racter a little, but did not love it: It was so far as they understood it, they hated him. They found he was designed to put all men upon a level in point of acceptance with God, and intended to bring in publicans and harlots <HI>into the kingdom of God before them:</HI>—This sadly piqued the pride of Pharisees, who imagined they were in better terms with the Deity than the rest of the world, and much nigher the kingdom of God. The same reasons prevail with all the enemies of the atone∣ment.—They are chagrined because the atonement of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> sets all their good virtues and moral
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>excellence aside, and brings them before God like other guilty men, who must either be accepted of on account of the righteouness of another, or perish for ever.—</P>
<P>THE meanness of <HI>Jesus,</HI> his outward character, made the <HI>Jews</HI> despise him, and the design of his death made them bate him. His example was op∣posite to the natural pride of the world, and these distinctions and differences that prevail so much a∣mong every sect of religionists, where every one has higher pretences to the favours of the Deity than ano∣ther; whereas <HI>Jesus</HI> made all the difference to con∣sist <HI>in bearing the cross, and self-denial.</HI> Human pride could not even admit his miracles to proceed from Divine power, because he himself did not ad∣mit of these differences:—So that when <HI>he made the blind to see, and the lame to walk, and raised the dead, and cured all manner of diseases,</HI> they still say, <HI>Is not this the carpenter's son?</HI> Because he did not establish the differences they were fond of, and loved to move in low life himself, they hated and despised him.—His death, that was designed <HI>to take away the sins of the world,</HI> they looked upon as the just demerit of his arrogance, in making himself <HI>equal with God;</HI> when he was one of the lowest of men. After his resurrection, when the fishers of <HI>Gallilee</HI> preached the doctrine of acceptance through his death, and shewed <HI>there was no salvation in any other;</HI> that it was only by <HI>believing in him</HI> that there was any difference among men in the sight of God, it made them <HI>gnash their teeth,</HI> and <HI>persecute them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the root of all the enmity of men at the atonement of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Because it sets all men in a level before God, in point of acceptance, they cannot see of what consequence their virtue and excellence is, unless it procure the Divine fa∣vour; they can assign no valuable end it is good for. There is either something too high or too
<PB N="129" REF="133"/>low about the character of <HI>Jesus</HI> for their appre∣hension. The humble pattern he set before men, piques their pride to look down to; and his Divine eminence above all creatures, and his equality with God, dazzles their pride to look up to. For this reason they have given him a middle charac∣ter, not quite consistent with either humanity or divinity.—They have raised him just as high as their pride can conceive human nature to be, and as near to God as they think it necessary, and made him a glorious creature with Divine attri∣butes: They have made him a glorious person, worthy to be followed in the shining part of his character; but not at all to be depended upon in point of acceptance with God.—There is a vast dif∣ference between the antient history of the life of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the modern draughts of it in later histories. The ancient history of his life, wrote by the apostles, informs us, when he was in his lowest state, <HI>He was the son of man that is in heaven,</HI> even at that time; <HI>that he was God as well as man</HI> in his low state of abasement:—That he still <HI>performed the same works with the father,</HI> and <HI>he and the father are one.</HI> But some writers of the history of his life in later times have found, <Q>That he was only a very “excellent man, raised up for a pattern to others in after-times, and that he was exceedingly ill used by the Almighty, who, tho' he had done no evil, yet made him suffer mortal sorrow; and die a ”shameful, painful, and ignominious death.</Q> The ancient history of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> informs us, that he died for very weighty and sufficient reasons, <HI>that he might glorify God, and save sinners from eternal mi∣sery: That he might make his people acceptable unto God,</HI> and make both their persons and performan∣ces <HI>accepted before the Almighty: That he died to bring many sons unto glory.</HI> But modern discoveries in∣form us, <Q>That there were no such reasons of his
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>“death; but that he died, or fell a victim to the arbitrary caprice of the Deity, and the malice of ”wicked men.</Q> The whole description of his character that human pride hath invented, is only like that of an antient hero struggling with many difficulties, and overcoming them all; and for a re∣ward of his fortitude and virtue, receiving a subor∣dinate Deification above angels and men.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> is only de∣spised, because his title is significant of the mortifi∣cation of all human pride and excellence.—By his humble life he has set such a meek and lowly pat∣tern to men, and by his death removed all distinc∣tions, in point of acceptance with God, that hu∣man pride, abhorring to be so much debased, takes its revenge in denying his Divine excellencies.— There is no other way of establishing human dif∣ferences in religion, but by undermining that prin∣ciple that removes all difference. That question, <HI>Who hath made thee to differ from another?</HI> is un∣answerable to human excellency, and therefore pride destroys the foundation upon which it is founded, and denies the true signification of this title of <HI>Jesus Christ, The Lamb in the midst of the throne.</HI> This title of our Redeemer is significant of his manner of life and teaching. He was in all things a pattern of meekness and true humility: And his advice to men was, <HI>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</HI> Like a lamb for meekness, he was the eye-sore of the proud and vain, and for this rea∣son was hated by the leaders of the prevailing reli∣gion, who hated nothing so much as <HI>the cross</HI> and <HI>humility.</HI>—Had <HI>Jesus</HI> assumed a Divine character, and acted up to it in that light that pride views greatness, he would soon have found acceptance in the world, and Pharisees would not challenge him for saying, <HI>he was equal to God,</HI> if he had not sent them and their pride to the devil.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
<P>THE greatest adversaries of the atonement, and the Divine character of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> could easily allow him to be a Divine person, providing he had not, by assuming so high a character, obliged them to walk so low: And by debasing himself, urged hu∣mility by such grating arguments.—But seeing that he will have men to imitate him in <HI>lowliness and humility,</HI> so contrary to their sense of self-dependence, they think it but fit that they should be sharers with him in the glory of their acceptance with God. Tho' they will allow him to be <HI>the Lamb of God,</HI> as a pattern of meekness, they will not allow him to be <HI>a Lamb for a sin-offering.</HI> But to all true belie∣vers his title in the text has a noble and true signi∣fication. It shews that he is now accepted of, as <HI>our great High Priest;</HI> or in the words of <HI>Luke, Ex∣alted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and remission of sin.</HI> He is represented as in the <HI>midst of the throne,</HI> as <HI>a king possessed of all power and authority,</HI> as <HI>Lord of the consciences of men.</HI>—And tho' he is now glorified, and possessed of all power and glory, he still sustains the character of our Re∣deemer, and his death is held as the ground of our acceptance with God.—Tho' in <HI>the midst of the throne,</HI> he is still <HI>the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.</HI> This title signifies to us, that there is but one way of access to God to all men that shall be saved: That <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>dead and risen again,</HI> is <HI>the great and one thing needful;</HI> wor∣thy of our consideration both in this life and that which is to come. As <HI>the Lamb upon a throne of grace,</HI> he is the way of the sinners access to God, and the author of his acceptance while here; and as viewed upon <HI>a throne of glory,</HI> the administrator of all Divine gifts to his church and people in both their militant and triumphant state.—With the greatest propriety he deserves the title of, <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne.</HI></P>
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
<P N="2">2. WE may learn from what has been said, that it is only <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> that can give men true and just notions of the Divine character, and make us <HI>partakers of the Divine goodness.—The only begotten who is in the bosom of the father,</HI> declares unto us what God is. All the notions that men have of God without the teaching of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> are mere conjectures. The best natural notions men have of a Deity, when compared with that knowledge of God which is obtained by knowing the character of <HI>Jesus,</HI> are only fancies and presumptions.— At best they only inform us that he exists, but do not explain his character. These natural notions are very different in different persons, and the maxim of the poet <HI>[Horace]</HI> holds true, <HI>Tot hominum totidemque studiorum.</HI> The attributes of the Deity are by these natural notions for the most bounded in their ex∣ercise, and human pride often <HI>sets limits</HI> to the infi∣nite God. Many ingenious conceits are often fallen upon to make one attribute of God absorb another, and some wrap them all up in goodness:—Yea all who read not the Divine character in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will only give the Deity such a character as best suits their own natural notions of self-dependence, and make him something <HI>like themselves.</HI> This is the same thing as to say, unless he is like them he cannot be good. It is <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> that represents unto us the best and truest character of God in his own person.—To all who know him, he says, as to <HI>Philip, He that hath seen me, hath seen the father.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the symbolic representations of God in the Old Testament dispensation, by <HI>Cherubims,</HI> the <HI>Scheniah,</HI> the <HI>Ark,</HI> the <HI>cloudy Pillar,</HI> and <HI>Mercy Seat,</HI> all referred to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as the great substance.</P>
<P>THERE is no just understanding of the charac∣ter of God <HI>Jehovah, the maker of heaven and earth,</HI> but from an acquaintance with the true character
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> he hath fully declared him, in his miraculous working, in his majesty and power, in his righteous behaviour, and holy administration, in his claiming and receiving Divine adoration, worship and reverence from men.</P>
<P>HIS words to <HI>Philip,</HI> are as much as if he had said, <HI>My father is the same as I am, for he worketh hitherto, and I work;</HI> and as he expresseth himself, <HI>John</HI> x. 30. <HI>I and my father are one.</HI> By his death he hath given the brightest display of Divine justice; <HI>if God spared not his own son,</HI> when he suffered for sinners, but vindicated the rights of justice by cau∣sing him to die a mortal death, even when he most earnestly prayed, <HI>Let this cup pass from me,</HI> he certainly is most just to his word, and severe against sin. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> did by his death give the clearest representation of the truth of the Divine threatnings. All the threatnings of the Old Testament denounced against sin, were fulfilled thereby, as also the prophecies, and a great number of promises. By this grant event we have a very copious display of what the Divine charac∣ter is, as no attribute we can conceive necessary to form a perfect Divine character, but what shines forth in the death of <HI>Christ.</HI>—</P>
<P>HOLINESS, and hatred at sin in punishing it in the person of his own son:—Justice in vindicating his own character, and giving sin its due desert, namely death:—Righteousness and truth in fulfil∣ling his threatning, according to the tenor of the first covenant:—Goodness and mercy in accepting of a surety, and pardoning sinners, and receiving them into favour for the sake of his son's righte∣ousness. In <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> we have the perfections of Deity brought as it were into one point of view; and by understanding his character, and the design of his mediatorship, we come to know truly what God is.—Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> alone makes us
<PB N="134" REF="138"/><HI>partakers of the Divine goodness;</HI> he brings near a <HI>righteousness,</HI> and <HI>works in them the work of faith with power; he sends his word and heals them:</HI> He gives them true and just notions of what is good: Never do men truly understand what is good till <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> makes them un∣derstand it, by giving them a true taste for it.— That <HI>good thing, the one thing needful,</HI> a <HI>righteousness whereby men may come before the Lord</HI> with accep∣tance, he brings near in <HI>a word of promise,</HI> and by his Divine power fixes it in the conscience. All men since <HI>Adam</HI> tasted the fruit of the forbidden tree, have had a false taste and notion for goodness.— They cry, <HI>Who will shew us any good thing?</HI> But it is what suits their false taste, agreeable to their pride and notions of self-importance. Men's natural no∣tions of goodness have a tendency to exclude the thoughts, and supersede the necessity of a media∣tor; and they reason about the Divine goodness in such a way as would make him manifestly unjust. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> teaches them that justice is good, and that when he punisheth sin, and condems it, he is then eminently good:— For he is just, and <HI>the justifier of the ungodly;</HI> this to them is the highest goodness.</P>
<P>MEN naturally have a desire for what is good, and would be happy by bringing down God to the level of their own capacity, but cannot understand the goodness of God in making them so, unless he allows them a share in the enterprize, and a part of the glory. They cannot digest the thought that they should be nothing, and <HI>their righteousness as filthy rags before God.</HI> They still would be saved in whole or in part by the works of the law, and rather than exclude their own notions of self-de∣pendence, they chuse to exclude the atonement of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> From a false notion of goodness, a∣rising from a prejudice in favour of the power of
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>human nature, men have invented ingenious con∣ceits, and published learned disputes, to such as please to read them, to shew what nature yet can do, and how little need there is of an atonement. Scarcely is there a passage in the whole Bible that mentions the atonement, but ingenious comenta∣tors have shown us that they have no such meaning; and if it were so, they can shew us a character of De∣ity that is quite inconsistent with any such sense of an atonement:—That our natural notions that are the standard of every thing, can easily find that an atonement for sin to God is opposite to his good∣ness, and contrary to his moral character.—</P>
<P>AND that this character of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> means nothing, but refers to an antient way of speaking the apostles were accustomed unto. God was al∣ways good, and well inclined towards our interest, and needs not be atoned, say they:—He had the happiness of his creatures always at heart, and ne∣ver intended that any of them should be miserable. The friends of the atonement never affirmed that the satisfaction of <HI>Christ</HI> made any change in the Deity, but was necessary to vindicate his character, <HI>that he might be just in justifying the ungodly.</HI> The change is made in men not in God. Man had sinned against his Maker, and stood in another re∣lation to him than when he was first made. He had now become guilty before God, and the threat∣ning of the Divine law stood in the way of his hap∣piness:—Justice also required a satisfaction before he could be again restored into the Divine favour, and the threatning expressed what that satisfaction was, viz. <HI>death.</HI> If God had left all men <HI>to eat the fruit of their doings,</HI> none had had reason to complain, or to challenge his goodness:—For goodness doth not consist in a mere relation to our notions of hap∣piness, but in what will answer the ends of true
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>and just government, and display the glory of the Divine character.</P>
<P>WERE we only to be considered as silent spec∣tators in this case, and had no interest in the matter, we would perhaps account it better that an infinite fair character should be kept unstained, than that the guilty should suffer, and see more goodness in punishing a delinquent than in exposing the charac∣ter of the best of judges to reproach.—But the case is, we have had an hand in the transgression, but do not see the deepness of our crime. Our notions of goodness are not moral, otherwise they would take in all the ideas of truth and justice, and see that no∣thing can be truly good which swerves from righte∣ousness and truth.</P>
<P>WHEN man had taken part with <HI>Satan</HI> against the Deity, he became a rebel against the govern∣ment of heaven, and engaged against all the rules of righteousness and truth:—To receive him again into favour against an express law of the Almighty, would have been an indulgence opposite unto the notion of true goodness, unless it could be found that <HI>Jehovah</HI> erred in framing the canon of our o∣bedience.—Even the greatest patrons of goodness, and enemies of the atonement, never shew that they really have such notions of goodness;—though they insist upon goodness in opposition unto satis∣faction, yet in every piece of practice they walk contrary.</P>
<P>IF goodness be such a shining attribute in the character of God, and men may safely trust to it for eternal happiness, it will no doubt have a spe∣cial influence upon their own conduct, and they will strive to imitate it; but these votaries for mere goodness, when offended themselves, insist as much upon satisfaction as any others.—Had they really such natural notions of Divine goodness as they pretend, they would certainly imitate that which
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>they account the highest perfection. Might it not be expected that men possessed of such high notions of goodness and forgiveness, would without all re∣compence forgive every offence committed against them:—Set prisoners free, forgive debtors, pardon rebels, and pass by all offences, in a gratuitous man∣ner? In doing this they would only be imitating what they account the highest perfection, and the most excellent attribute; they would only be imi∣tating the God whom they intended to adore, and following their own natural notions.—But when these patrons of goodness insist upon the highest rigour, and are as unforgiving and implacable as other men, it shews, however unwilling they are to allow an atonement to the Deity, they must have one themselves, otherwise no mercy can be obtain∣ed at their hands. This plainly shews that they have no such natural notions of goodness as they give out, otherwise they act very unnaturally; and if their God be like themselves, men are in a mi∣serable condition notwithstanding of his goodness. The truth is, men have no natural notions of God as he really is, till <HI>Jesus Christ, the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> teaches them. Their notions of Deity are as variable as the sense of guilt and remorse upon their conscience is, so that when they are worst, they imagine their God should be best;— nor the reasons of despair force themselves so vio∣lently into their conscience that they have no other refuge but either to admit an atonement, or form a new character to the Almighty.—But as the first is too humbling for their pride and notions of self-dependence, they betake themselves to the latter, which removes such a sense of obligation;—nor if God be as good as they say their natural notions in∣form them, then they are not obliged to him for pardoning their offences, for he cannot do otherwise without forfeiting his character.</P>
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>
<P>BUT those who read the New Testament sin∣cerely, will not envy them their natural notions, but will see the goodness of God in another point of view:—That he is only good <HI>when he is just,</HI> and <HI>justifies the ungodly</HI> through the atonement of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.</HI> In him they have the truest and just∣est notions of goodness:—What is both good for God and sinners. In <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb of God,</HI> the holy and just character of Deity is support∣ed in every degree, which is a great and eminent good; and <HI>life and salvation</HI> to guilty men <HI>opened up,</HI> as a sure and certain good to all true believers of it.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> WE may see a large and extensive pro∣spect of happiness to believers beyond death and the grave. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne will lead them to living fountains of waters, and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.</HI> Such as have just views of this character of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will in the midst of their greatest fears and doubts find great relief. When present troubles press hard upon the true christian, and the grave seems to terminate all the bliss and peace that this world can afford, a new extensive scene opens in the admini∣stration of <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne.</HI> When remorse, and every reason of despair is enforced by all the views men can have of the best of things and deeds in this world; when the imperfection and sinfulness of our most pious endeavours are ready <HI>to stare us in the face,</HI> and dash our hopes in view of death, <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> affords a sufficient answer to all those doubts and reasons of fear.</P>
<P>THE calmest Philosopher, and the most rigid devotee of virtue, cannot carry his hopes beyond death:—For as his best service was but finite, and attended with much imperfection, he can see no reason that a service that never reached higher than
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>self and private interest, should carry him to the regions of bliss; and so it has happened that the greatest number of that class have either resolved all the reward of virtue into a state of non-existence, or have spoken very doubtfully of it in a future state. None but such as believe in <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> can extend their views of happiness beyond the grave with certainty.—But such as have received <HI>power from him to become the sons of God,</HI> can in view of death triumph with <HI>Job: I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself and not another. Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> in view of death, is an object that believers only can comfort themselves with in their contemplation. In him they see how just and reasonable it is for God to receive the worthless and disobedient into <HI>everlasting habitations.</HI> That perfect obedience of his, appears worthy not only to save them from <HI>death spiritual and eternal,</HI> but to procure their ad∣mission into a state of everlasting favour and felici∣ty.—The <HI>leading them through death</HI> they see to be necessary to complete and perfect their experience, and make them perfectly understand how easy a passage death is. Death to such appears not in a formidable, but in an amiable dress:—With their faith fixt upon the Forerunner, <HI>who hath entered for them within the vail,</HI> they can say with <HI>David, When I pass thro' the valley and shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, and thy rod and thy staff doth comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the midst of the throne</HI> is the pledge of their coming to heaven; for he told his people before he left this world, that he would <HI>see them again, and come and take them to himself, that where he was they might be also.</HI> Such as believe in <HI>Jesus
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> have solid reasons of hope at death. The death of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as <HI>the slain Lamb,</HI> secures them from the power of death; his resurrection secures to them a happy re∣surrection, and his exaltation ensures to them a place in the mansions of glory.—Such as have no hope but in a doubtful non-existence, must endure the most perplexing thoughts in view of death; for conscience which will not be easily brought over to this persuasion, will feel some forebodings of im∣mortality, which must beget a terrible remorse in the mind.—To look forward to immortality, and have no view of an atonement for sin, when con∣science informs men they are guilty, is a considera∣tion that the soul cannot bear up under:—For this reason infidels at these awful moments entrench themselves in annihilation, and would persuade conscience that they shall sleep for ever in the womb of non-existence.</P>
<P>BUT the persuasion that <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the midst of the throne,</HI> has gone to heaven as the forerunner, <HI>to prepare a place for his people,</HI> makes the thoughts of immortality sweet:—For whatever goodness, mercy or glory there is in God, they are sure of a share: <HI>For worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive all glory, honour, dominion and blessing.</HI> The apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in view of death and immortality, could say, <HI>When the carthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved, we have a building not made with hands, e∣ternal in the heavens.</HI> That such as <HI>look for glory, honour and immortality,</HI> are not deceived; none can be in doubt who believe Divine revelation.—It is indeed wonderful that any who are friends to Di∣vine revelation should deny the atonement of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> when without it, it is of no great consequence to men whether there be a revelation or not.</P>
<P>ALL the scripture account of God will only af∣ford reasons of despair, but so far as he is reconciled
<PB N="141" REF="145"/><HI>through the redemption that is in Jesus.</HI> His good∣ness, as we observed, can afford no true satisfaction to any who are sensible of guilt and imperfection; nor can his expressions of goodness to creatures that never offended him, give us any reason to ex∣pect that he will be good to such as have offended, which is the whole force of all the arguments taken from his works. Tho' he by his goodness satisfies the natural desires of every one of his creatures, as he is the upholder of the world, yet nothing from hence can be gathered of what he will do hereafter; nor can we certainly infer, that because men taste of his temporal goodness, that he will reward them with eternal life hereafter:—On the contrary, we have reason to fear that he will justly punish such as have abused his goodness in this life, with misery in the next. Revelation opens up a door of com∣fort, in view of death, by revealing an atonement, with which God has declared himself <HI>well pleased;</HI> and as an evidence of the truth of this, <HI>has exalted Jesus,</HI> the author of that atonement, <HI>to the midst of his throne of glory.</HI>—And as our Saviour in this high state, and high character, is possessed of all Divine fullness, suited to the nature, and fuller than the desires of a finite soul can be, and assuredly de∣clared that believers shall be sharers thereof, they have not only the surest but the fullest hope. <HI>The Lamb in the midst of the throne, shall lead them into living fountains of waters.</HI> The meanness of their appearance here below, the reproaches they suffered in this valley of tears, for following the Lamb, <HI>shall be all wiped away. The ransomed of the Lord shall then return to Zion, with songs and everlasting joy upon their head; they shall enjoy everlasting gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, Upon the whole we may learn our dependence upon God, in every possible state of existence, for all things that can suit our happi∣ness,
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>while our being lasts, which will be for ever. We depend upon God alone for the support of our bodies:—<HI>In him we live, move, and have our being:</HI> Upon him we depend for salvation from sin and death, and for the hope of future happiness:—On him we must depend through all eternity, for that bliss which is fitted for our nature in that state; which in the words of the inspired writer is, <HI>What eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what it is.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV. The Death and Exaltation of Christ, Means of carrying forward our Views to God, both in this Life and that which is to come.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>REV. i. 18.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I am he that liveth and was dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Apostle <HI>John,</HI> who was banished into the isle of <HI>Patmos,</HI> in the reign of the em∣peror <HI>Domitian,</HI> for the testimony of <HI>Jesus,</HI> was eminently favoured of God with many bright discoveries of his glory and goodness, and revelations of his will. This book is called, <HI>The Revelation of Jesus, that he signified by his an∣gel to his servant John,</HI> because it contains a pro∣phecy of what <HI>Jesus</HI> was about to work in his church, by reforming her from antichristian super∣stition, and delivering her from that present perse∣cution which she then laboured under.</P>
<P>THIS chapter contains the substance of a vision that God gave unto the apostle, in which <HI>Jesus</HI> ap∣peared unto him, and gave him a commission to <HI>write unto the seven churches of Asia.</HI> The vision contains a representation of these churches under the figure of <HI>Candlesticks,</HI> and <HI>Jesus</HI> the Lord <HI>walk∣ing in the midst of them.</HI>—His appearance is ma∣jestic, solemn and awful, striking in the highest de∣gree, and far too splendid for human sight. There is near the same description of him mentioned in <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s vision, chapter 1st, near the close, which had the same effect upon the prophet that this had upon the apostle <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>THE awful appearance of this Godlike per∣sonage
<PB N="144" REF="148"/>was far too striking for the apostle's senses to behold, and wrought upon him in such a degree, that through fear and astonishment <HI>he fell to the ground.</HI> To comfort him in the midst of his fear, and remove the effect of his astonishment, <HI>Jesus</HI> tells him who he was, to put him in mind of the design of all his manifestations, which was to quicken not to kill his people: <HI>I am he who liveth and was dead;</HI> and in view of such a work as he was now to be called unto, it was needful he should know who-employed him, and have encouragement for such an important task.</P>
<P>THAT he might be able to endure this reve∣lation, <HI>Jesus</HI> directs him through what medium to look, and puts him in mind of his <HI>death and resur∣rection,</HI> as a perspective thro' which he might be∣hold the glory of God without confusion. The on∣ly way to behold the glory of God, and enjoy com∣munion with him, is thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as once <HI>a dead,</HI> but now <HI>a living</HI> Redeemer. <HI>No man can see God and live,</HI> but thro' him <HI>that was dead and is alive:</HI> If <HI>John</HI> could not behold the Mediator in his glory without <HI>falling to the ground,</HI> surely no man can be∣hold his perfect majesty <HI>and live.</HI> It is thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>the propitiation for our sins,</HI> that we can <HI>ap∣proach unto God;</HI> he hath <HI>consecrated a new and li∣ving way through the vail of his flesh.</HI> Our present views of God must be directed thro' <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> his son, <HI>who liveth and was dead.</HI>—</P>
<P>HERE I shall consider the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> as a medium or glass, to carry forward our views to God, or as the means of our enjoying communion with him. (2) Consider his exaltation at God's right-hand, as the means of carrying our views further. Then make some improvement.—</P>
<P>HEAD 1st, to consider the death of <HI>Jesus</HI> as a means to carry forward our views toward God, and communion with him.</P>
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
<P N="1">1. IT is through the death of <HI>Christ</HI> the rays of Divine light and grace shine upon guilty men. None of the benign beams of Divine love could have shone upon the church, unless <HI>Christ</HI> had died to make it consistent with the attributes of God, thus to express his goodness to a guilty world. <HI>Clouds and darkness are round about him:</HI> His pure Majesty is darkness to the minds of blinded sinners, and no man could have beheld his Majesty since sin came into the world, unless <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by his death and suffering, had taken away that vengeful aspect it appeared in against the guilty. But thro' the death of our Redeemer this splendour of Divine Majesty, is like <HI>a day spring from on high:</HI> That dreadful part of his character, tho' not altered in itself, appears mild and propitious, as it shines thro' God in our nature.</P>
<P>OUR Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by <HI>tabernacling among men,</HI> in their nature, <HI>and suffering for their sin,</HI> hath made it appear that there is <HI>good will to men.</HI> A guilty world could see no testimonies of his good will, as to future happiness, by all the discoveries of natural science; all things on that head were only conjectural, till the gospel revealed them. By sin there was a judicial blindness upon men as an effect of the curse; even light itself, to them by nature, is darkness <HI>i. e.</HI> the light of Divine truth. The splendour of the Divine character is too glaring for man's infected mental sight to behold, without a proper medium. The very sense of the Divine cha∣racter made our first parents flee from his presence, <HI>and hide themselves among the trees of the garden.</HI> It is through <HI>Jesus</HI> only we come <HI>to know the will of God for our salvation,</HI> and see a possibility of any of the guilty race of <HI>Adam</HI> enjoying communion with him. <HI>What was hid for ages and generations, is now made manifest through the death of the son of God.</HI> The first views of peace and happiness after the fall,
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>were conveyed to our first parents through a pro∣mise of a crucified Saviour, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent.</HI> The thoughts of God's being reconciled to men could never have entered into the heart of man; his best discoveries would have been for ever conjecture.—But through this glorious medium, God has set <HI>eternal life</HI> before our eyes.</P>
<P>EVEN the natural conscience when it reflects upon its own guiltiness, and the purity of the na∣ture of God, cannot conceive of a possibility of hap∣piness, but through some mean that makes it con∣sistent with his nature to bestow it. We cannot have any just notions of reconciliation with God, without considering if it is consistent with his cha∣racter to be reconciled: And without some method above the reach of human invention, this cannot be conceived. The heathens wandered far astray in their conceits about placating the Deity, and were far distant from enjoying communion with him. Their minds could not conceive how true communion with the Deity could be enjoyed, and therefore they conceived of their gods as removed at a great distance from them, and so feared, but did not love them. The true knowledge of happiness and communion with God, is only rightly attain∣ed unto through a view of the death and atonement of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> For thereby God appears favour∣able to men, and on account thereof has declared, <HI>he is well pleased.</HI> The publication of the death and satisfaction of <HI>Christ,</HI> as a substitute for sinners, and of God's acceptation of his performance in that capacity, affords us a view of God that is amiable and delightful. For whatever appeared vengeful-like in his character, is rendered amiable through this means of his own devising. The presence of God will be awful, but never amiable to a guilty
<PB N="147" REF="151"/>mind, till once it sees him through the death of his well-beloved son.</P>
<P>THERE will be a constant antipathy between the mind and what is pure and holy, until it per∣ceives a possibility of holiness, and sees it to be its interest. Guilt begets fear, and fear antipathy, and both produce impurity: For he who has a dread of God's vengeance, will naturally have an antipathy at his presence, which will cause the greatest moral pain in the soul; and when the soul flies from God, it also flies from holiness: For he is the source of all purity and perfection. All natu∣ral opposites have less or more antipathy at one a∣nother, and nothing is more opposite than the ho∣liness of God, and our guilty impure consciences. The more we consider our opposition to God, the greater will our aversion be to communion with him. Through the death of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> we have a prospect of reconciliation, and the removing of the opposition between God and guilty sinners: <HI>For them that were far off, are brought near by the blood of Jesus.</HI> The death of <HI>Christ</HI> is like a glass through which the Deity shines propitious to a guilty world: This is the blessed medium through which he communicates his favour to the objects of his love: This the procuring cause of all the dis∣plays of Divine favour in all the various manifesta∣tions thereof:—This also the reason why men <HI>live to the praise of the glory of God:</HI> For <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> by his death purchased every Divine gift necessary to dispose the minds of christians to delight in the Divine law. As freedom from the guilt of sin is derived from the death of <HI>Jesus:</HI> So it is the source from which Divine energy flows to support their souls in life, in the midst of every trial in this mor∣tal state.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE death of <HI>Christ</HI> may be considered ac∣tively, as having a powerful influence, not only in
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>making new discoveries to men, but in effecting the means whereby they can discern them. It hath procured that influence and power, which opens the <HI>eyes of our blinded understanding,</HI> and causeth men to discern spiritual objects in another manner. These prejudices that attend our fallen corrupt state, are powerfully removed by the efficacy of the death of our Redeemer. The death of <HI>Christ</HI> is a truth full of active power, and carries along with it such evidence, as overcomes the resistance of men's natural unbelief. It is indeed only a passive truth so far to many; but to those who are its true objects, it is a truth that gives life, a quickening truth. The darkened mind that was ready <HI>to sleep the sleep of death,</HI> is thereby enlightened, and sends comfortable intimations of peace and pardon into the conscience: For the very language of this truth to the soul is, <HI>that it shall not die, but live, and dis∣cover the works of the Lord.</HI> It is not only a reme∣dy against guilt, because accepted of by <HI>Jehovah,</HI> but a truth that operates upon the soul, as a beam of quickening light from the sun of righte∣ousness. It is a truth that nourishes the soul of a christian, and enables it to exert itself in all its par∣ticular powers. The knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI>'s death, as a ransom-price for man's redemption, revives these powers of the mind to the true exercise of love and joy, that were depressed under fear, uncertainty and remorse.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE will soon tell men when they are offenders, and sin no sooner touches this moral sense, but the thoughts of God are painful; from whence arises remorse, which when long endured begets stupidity, which no human reasoning can remove, till God discovers himself to the conscience, either as a God of vengeance or mercy. As to the first of these discoveries, the first effect it has upon the soul, is the stirring up the old remorse, fear and appre∣hension;
<PB N="149" REF="153"/>but the latter quickens it in the way of healing it. The mercy of God through the death of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is a quickening and reviving truth. That word of life which reveals <HI>Christ crucified</HI> to a guilty soul, heals that pain and remorse, which the apprehensions of God's displeasure and indignation raises in the soul: <HI>He sent his word and healed them,</HI> Psal. cvii. 20.</P>
<P>THE views of <HI>Christ</HI> crucified, and of God re∣conciled in him to guilty sinners, draw forth the va∣rious exertions of the soul to their proper objects: So fear attended with joy, reverence joined with faith, and confidence and love of God joined with hatered at sin, are all exercised with true propriety. The death of <HI>Christ</HI> as an active cause, carries for∣ward our views towards God and communion with him: For it is the nourishment of the soul in all its exercises, and acts of religion and devotion: <HI>My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</HI> are the words of the Redeemer himself.</P>
<P>THE death of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is not merely a pas∣sive medium thro' which we may see God revealed, but a powerful enlightening truth, that gives <HI>light to the blinded understanding.</HI> The evidence thereof, and the grace and favour of God, which constantly attends it, gives power to the soul to see spiritual objects, as well as make the object possible to be viewed. Hereby the object is both brought near, and the sight carried forward to the object. There are two things peculiar in the misery of a fallen state: The true object of our happiness removed far hence, and at a distance from us: The want of power to discern the object when near. <HI>Christ cru∣cified</HI> is a remedy for both these evils: For by his death he has made God our friend, and brought the Divine attributes and perfections, within the reach of our faith, as harmonizing in the salvation of guilty sinners, and by the same hath purchased
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>strength to such as were ungodly: <HI>For when we were without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,</HI> Rom. v. 6. The habits and exercises of all true Divine sentiments, depend upon the death of our Redeemer: So that as he hath brought the Deity nearer to us, he hath also given us power and strength whereby we are enabled to enjoy com∣munion with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is by contemplating <HI>Christ crucified,</HI> that our minds can be stedfast in viewing the Divine attributes. It is in him as the atonement, <HI>that mer∣cy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss one another.</HI> When the believer's mind contem∣plates the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> as the medium through which God displays his attributes in man's salva∣tion, every view of the Divine character therein is delightful, and gives joy to the soul. To behold the Divine character thro' the sufferings of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is a pleasing not a confounding sight. The soul can endure the discovery: For the radiance of the Divinity shines with love and meekness thro' the flesh of the son of the Highest. The Deity as it were becomes familiar to a christian, by display∣ing its sweetness thro' his own nature: Hereby he is enabled to look more stedfastly upon the charac∣ter of God, as expressed in him <HI>who is bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh:</HI> And is made to say, <HI>We beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten son of God, full of grace and truth,</HI> John i. 14. The true christian can with ease and delight, contemplate the character of a Deity thro' his well-beloved son our <HI>crucified Redeemer.</HI> It is there that justice as it were smiles with affability upon such as were guilty, and there that conscience can contemplate that glorious part of the Divine character, without confusion and horror. When there is some proportion between the radiance of the object, and the strength given to the mental visive faculty, that horror that arises
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>from the superior glare of a very striking object is removed.</P>
<P>A FULL glance of the Divine Majesty would confound all men at once, considering the imper∣fection of their faculties. For no man could <HI>see God's face and live,</HI> and there could be no commu∣nion intimately had with him in this present im∣perfect state: But thro' the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> every true believer enjoys a stedfast view of the Divine character: Hence, says the Apostle, <HI>We all as in a glass beholding the glory of God, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 18. The same Apostle, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 2. points out the way of our enjoying communion with God: <HI>Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking un∣to Jesus the author and finisher of</HI> our <HI>faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is now set down on the right∣hand of the throne of God.</HI> The same Apostle saw so much glory in <HI>the cross of Christ,</HI> that he deter∣mined to <HI>know,</HI> and to <HI>glory in nothing else,</HI> Gal. vi. 14. It was thro' this he beheld <HI>God as reconciled,</HI> and could with stedfastness dwell upon the subject. It is by fixing the eyes of the mind upon a <HI>crucified Jesus,</HI> that we can contemplate the nature of God with satisfaction: <HI>For in him he is well pleased.</HI></P>
<P>To consider the holiness of God, and our own impurity simply, is a thought that no man could long endure: To view his justice and our guilt, is a consideration we could not abide. But in <HI>Jesus Christ crucified,</HI> we may behold him as a God <HI>pur∣ging us from our sins, by the blood of his own well-be∣loved son,</HI> and taking away all our guilt for the sake of his <HI>perfect righteousness:</HI> Therefore our minds can thro' <HI>Jesus Christ crucified,</HI> view the attributes of God with great pleasure and satisfaction.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is by the death of <HI>Christ</HI> that the intima∣tions of peace and pardon are made to the con∣science:
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>So the Apostle says, <HI>He is our peace, that hath made us one through his cross,</HI> Eph. ii. 14, 15, 16. That satisfaction of mind, and peace of conscience, which may justly be called self-enjoyment, is con∣veyed to us thro' the blood of <HI>Jesus.</HI> This may be called communion with God in the way of peace: For till an intimation of pardon of sin be intimate to conscience, the soul cannot enjoy the benefit of comfortable communion. When a believer con∣siders the account the Divine Testimony gives of the reason, cause, and effects of the suffering of <HI>Christ,</HI> he perceives a lasting ground of reconcilia∣tion between God and his soul: And when con∣science is thus informed by the Divine record, it enjoys ease and tranquility. The view of God that is presented to conscience, in the suffering of <HI>Christ,</HI> is that he is a friend; and conscience improves the friendship, by concluding, that <HI>there is peace with God thro' our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>access to him with boldness thro' the blood of his son.</HI></P>
<P>THE death of <HI>Christ</HI> is a testimony of God's most gracious designs to men: It is an evidence of his good-will, and his purposes of peace to the guilty: <HI>It speaks better things than the blood of Abel.</HI> It is the channel of all these delightful discoveries <HI>of life and immortality, which the gospel brings to light:</HI> It is the glass the mind views them thro', and by the dis∣coveries made thereby, all fears and perplexi∣ties of mind are dispelled. Every view of the Di∣vine character, purposes and designs, which shine thro' the sufferings of <HI>Jesus,</HI> speak peace to the soul: <HI>For if he spared not his own son, but gave him up to the death for us all, how much more will be not freely give us all things?</HI> Rom. viii. 32. Whoever by a true faith considers the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> cannot but see that there is peace to him: For God cannot demand two satisfactions in justice, one from the surety, and another from the principle: And if he
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>was satisfied with what his own son hath done, as the surety of his people, he is also gracious to them for his sake. Every one who understands the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> as a ransom-price for their iniquities, must be satisfied in their own mind, with respect to God's good-will to them, as the object of that redemption: <HI>If ye seek me, let these go their way,</HI> says the Redeem∣er, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 8.</P>
<P>PEACE of conscience will obtain when christi∣ans have just apprehensions of the death of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> but whenever any person views God thro' any other medium, he will appear dreadful: His Majesty will confound their souls, and the most fa∣vourable conjectures they can have of him through any other channel, will be far from giving solid peace to the mind. The very thoughts of his holy nature will be dreadful, however strictly a man lead his life; for he cannot live so uprightly as the law of God requires, and even the old grievance of o∣riginal sin will recur upon him, and marr his tran∣quility. The conscience will be satisfied with no specious pretences, nor be rightly quieted with any other notions of peace, but peace thro' the blood of <HI>Christ.</HI> Every remembrance of God will give trou∣ble, but the remembrance of him thro' <HI>Jesus. A∣saph</HI> was troubled at remembering God, till he thought upon him as <HI>a Saviour, redeeming his people,</HI> Psal. lxxvii. 3. All mediums we can view God thro', will lead us to fearful inferences, but the <HI>blood of Jesus:</HI> But through his death the soul will draw a favourable conclusion: <HI>I shall not die, but live, and discover the works of the Lord,</HI> Psal. cxviii. 17. Thro' this blessed channel conscience enjoys peace, and sees cause with <HI>boldness to approach unto God.</HI> Heb. x. 19. <HI>Having therefore boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh.</HI></P>
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>
<P>Head 2d. To consider the exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the channel through which our com∣munion with God may be carried forward to greater perfection, <HI>I am he that liveth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> is the channel thro' which the legacies of his death are applied to his people. As he merited these blessings by his death, which are necessary to make his children happy and holy, so he <HI>ever liveth</HI> to execute his own Testa∣ment, and to see a just application of all the bene∣fits of his death to the objects thereof. <HI>Christ</HI> be∣fore his death left sundry excellent legacies to his church and people: <HI>Peace with God, joy and consola∣tion,</HI> were special legacies he bequeathed to them, and promised when he was exalted to bestow them upon his church: <HI>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. I will send you the comforter, and he shall abide with you for ever.</HI> It is by a just consideration of <HI>Christ,</HI> as an exalted Saviour, and acting faith upon him, that the christian enjoys communion with God in the way of hope. Communion with God in the way of hope, consists in the soul's entertaining itself with the promised <HI>good things to come:</HI> This com∣munion is carried forward to perfection thro' <HI>Jesus,</HI> the exalted head of his church. When the soul re∣flects upon what God has promised to bestow, it entertains itself with his testimony, and patiently hopes till the appointed time come, when the good things promised shall be bestowed. But when to the promise itself, this glorious fact of <HI>Christ</HI>'s ex∣altation is added, and when this is considered as the <HI>first fruits</HI> of their exaltation, it renders this com∣munion of hope more perfect.</P>
<P>THESE Divine legacies, which our Mediator left to his church, are the substance of our com∣munion with God here below; when we enjoy these we have communion with him in his grace.
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>But this enjoyment depends much upon the exal∣tation of the Mediator: For they depended upon his <HI>going away,</HI> and <HI>ascending into heaven,</HI> and the constant enjoyment of them to his church depends upon the same cause. He is the constant executor of his own Testament. Without being certain of <HI>Christ's living for ever at the right-hand of God,</HI> we cannot be certain that those benefits shall be for ever conferred: But when we are certain of this, we are sure that our communion with God shall for ever be carried forward to perfection. <HI>Because he lives, her children shall live also.</HI> If <HI>Christ</HI> was not exalted, we could have no communion with God in the way of mercy, nor any certainty of pardon of our iniquities. We could not be sure that his death, as a sacrifice, was accepted of for sinners, un∣less he had been exalted and glorified; nor could any one conceive who should execute his Testament, if he had not been exalted.</P>
<P>THROUGH the exaltation of our Mediator, we can see a certainty of the application of all the be∣nefits of his death: For as <HI>he died for our sins, so he rose again for our justification,</HI> and continual com∣fort.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> carries forward our views, and confirms our persuasion of a more im∣mediate sight of God in another life. By the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> we see the Divine goodness coming down from heaven to men; by his exaltation, we behold men brought up to heaven to God. <HI>Christ</HI> told his disciples before he left this world, for their comfort, <HI>That he went to prepare a place for them.</HI> And as they are certain that he has <HI>prepared a place for them,</HI> and taken possession of it in their room; they are also certain, <HI>that in due time,</HI> they shall thro' him, <HI>come to the enjoyment thereof,</HI> and fill up <HI>their own room</HI> in glory. Every view that the true christian obtains of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as <HI>exalted at God's
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>right-hand,</HI> by means of the Divine record, encreases his persuasion, that he shall enjoy that communion for himself at last, which he now hopes for, and which his Redeemer has secured for him in heaven.</P>
<P>IT is thro' that representation which <HI>Christ</HI> makes of believers, in his state of exaltation, that they in this present life see a possibility and certainty of enjoying the full and free immunities of that royal place, where <HI>the King eternal reigneth for evermore.</HI> Like as a powerful and sincere friend at court pro∣cures a place for his friend and relation, so <HI>Christ</HI> as the christian's best friend, has <HI>prepared a place for all his people,</HI> and all the certainty they have of en∣joying this happiness is thro' him; they only can see their own privilege thro' his interest.</P>
<P>BELIEVERS having the sincere persuasion that <HI>Christ</HI> hath <HI>prepared a place for them at God's right-hand in heaven,</HI> and <HI>liveth for ever</HI> as their Mediator to secure their place, behold as in a mirrour the cer∣tainty of their coming to glory, when all the for∣malities of the New Covenant are fulfilled: That as <HI>their head and husband</HI> is now exalted, so in <HI>due time</HI> they shall also be exalted together with him, and join <HI>the general assembly and church of the first∣born.</HI> As we behold these things which are invi∣sible to the naked eye by the help of mediums; so by beholding the exaltation of <HI>Jesus,</HI> by faith, we see these Divine blessings which shall be bestowed upon the saints in glory. Without taking into our view the exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> we cannot have the least hope of coming to heaven. Had not <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the surety of his people, been <HI>raised from the dead,</HI> and <HI>exalted to the father's right-hand,</HI> no man could have had the least prospect of happiness, because they would have had no evidence of justice being satisfied. But seeing our Redeemer triumph∣ed over death, and was joyfully received into hea∣ven, after he had debased himself so low by the
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>suffering of death, it is an evidence of the Divine Majesty being satisfied with what he had done.</P>
<P>WHEN this exaltation of our Saviour is reveal∣ed to our mind as a truth, as it really is in Divine revelation, through this truth the believer sees a more perfect communion with God remaining for him, when he is exalted, as his Saviour hath pro∣mised unto him: <HI>I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, ye may be also, to behold my glory.</HI> We have no evidence from scripture, of any other exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> but in the capacity of our Mediator; and that glory which he received in that capacity, he received not for himself, but for his spiritual seed: And in the capacity of a Mediator, all the honour which he requires, is to have the power and pleasure of making men hap∣py, by bringing them nearer to God. As this is the very end of <HI>Christ</HI>'s exaltation, to bring his <HI>saints nearer unto God;</HI> so when they by faith con∣template his exaltation, they see a more perfect en∣joyment of God prepared for them. The human nature of <HI>Christ</HI> exalted at the Father's right-hand, is a pledge of all the members of his mystical body enjoying the same exaltation. Something like this is implied in our Lord's promise to his disciples, Matth. xix. 28. <HI>Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a king∣dom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that ye may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. BY the exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> we come to see what that communion is which saints shall enjoy with God hereafter in heaven. It is such a com∣munion as children have with their father, a com∣munion with God in holiness and purity. It is in Scripture called, <HI>an inheritance: An inheritance in∣corruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away. Christ</HI> is the <HI>first-born,</HI> and <HI>first heir</HI> of this inheri∣tance; and what he inherits is communion and in∣timacy
<PB N="158" REF="162"/>with the Father in love and favour. <HI>Christ</HI> is by the Apostle said to make believers <HI>heirs of God,</HI> and they are called <HI>joint heirs with Christ:</HI> So their communion with God, is of the same nature with that which <HI>Christ</HI> enjoys as mediator. If we once understand what that communion is which our Re∣deemer, in his state of exaltation enjoys, we may easily learn what that is which his saints shall enjoy. Whatever notions men have of communion with God in a future life, that are not connected with <HI>Christ</HI>'s exaltation, are mere fancies, and dreams of men's imagination. <HI>Christ</HI> in his exalted state is ad∣vanced to the highest honour and glory, and the greatest degree of favour and intimacy. He sits on the <HI>Father's right-hand,</HI> as an evidence of his great love and delight in him, and all true believers are admitted at last to sit with <HI>Christ at God's right-hand.</HI></P>
<P>WE cannot but conceive from the Scripture ac∣count of our Lord's exaltation, but his human na∣ture in a state of glory does enjoy a very perfect vision of the nature and attributes of God, and of all his plans and purposes. Tho' our Lord's body and soul are not infinite, as being bounded and circumscribed, as to place, yet being glorified, are capable of beholding the brightest displays of the Divine radiance; and tho' it is more the union of that nature to the Divinity, that enables it to behold all the shining splendour of Deity and the God-head, than merely its exaltation into heaven, yet it is the exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> that brought his hu∣man nature into that place where the fullest dis∣coveries of Divine glory are made. Tho' the ca∣pacity of our natures, as individuated, is not able to behold so much of the Divine splendour, as the human nature of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> yet by virtue of men's relation to him as their head, they shall be able to
<PB N="159" REF="163"/>behold the same glory, tho' not so fully and per∣fectly.</P>
<P>WHATEVER we can conceive our Redeemer be∣holds of the Divine attributes, he shall make his people see in a state of glory, tho' their capacity will not be so perfectly able to receive so much as his. Yet that communion which all the saints will enjoy, will be the same with that which <HI>Christ</HI> en∣joys; the same way that the members may be said to have the same communion as the head. Those who would have a true knowledge of that com∣munion which glorified saints enjoy with God, must look thro' the Scripture account of <HI>Christ</HI>'s exalta∣tion, and there they will find it: <HI>For as the head is, so shall also his members be. Christ</HI> in his exalted state, enjoys mutual love and friendship with the Father; and the sum of all the communion the saints can expect in heaven is, to give and receive mutual returns of love, in the immediate presence of God. This privilege the saints do enjoy thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as by him they are admitted into the Divine presence, and for his sake are made par∣takers of this communion. Thro' him they enjoy a view of the Divine perfections, and are made sharers of the Divine love; and it is only as far as they understand the nature of his exaltation, that they have suitable views of what communion with God in heaven is.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> affords us a view of what the saints' communion among them∣selves shall be. It will chiefly consist in beholding the same glorious object, viz. <HI>Jesus Christ, who is exalted for that purpose,</HI> that all the faithful may for ever admire him. The Apostle affirms this to be the common privilege of christians: <HI>We see Jesus crowned with glory and honour.</HI> Mutual enjoyment with one another in the same privileges, is account∣ed communion among men: And mutual enjoy∣ment
<PB N="160" REF="164"/>of the privilege of <HI>beholding the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</HI> may be called the com∣munion of saints in the other life. When all their eyes are fixed upon the same object, and their views and exercise the same, they must certainly have the most intimate communion among themselves. Thus it is that the exaltation of our Redeemer carries forward our views to God, as the very center of that communion which glorified saints enjoy among themselves. The glory of Deity, which good men will ever behold, will shine thro' an exalted Saviour, so that their contemplation of exalted <HI>Jesus,</HI> will make all their souls meet in him as a center. The more they enjoy of communion with God through him, the more shall they be united among them∣selves, and have a fuller communion.</P>
<P>BUT I must now proceed to make some im∣provement of the subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. HENCE see the duty of communicants at the table of the Lord: It is to look to <HI>Jesus</HI> as he <HI>that was dead and is now alive.</HI> Here you may see a plea for pardon of sin, a foundation for peace; a glass to look into the world thro'. Here you may see a powerful cause to preserve your souls from death, and insure eternal life to you, when this life is ended. As your Lord <HI>who died for you, liveth for evermore,</HI> so <HI>ye shall live also:</HI> He is in heaven for your sake, and for your happiness: He went <HI>to pre∣pare a place for you.</HI> What you now <HI>see by faith,</HI> as it were at a distance, you shall afterwards behold immediately and distinctly.</P>
<P>CHRIST <HI>lives for evermore,</HI> as <HI>the head of his church, which is his body;</HI> and all believers, as his members, <HI>shall live with him for ever in glory.</HI> It is your present duty to have your faith exercised upon him now, and to depend upon him stedfastly, that you may come to a better understanding of what shall be your employment, when your communion
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>with him shall be more perfect. By contemplating the character of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> expressed in the Di∣vine record, you shall <HI>see God manifested in the flesh,</HI> which is the delight of glorified saints, and the ad∣miration of angels: <HI>For these things the angels de∣sire to look into.</HI> There is no possibility of seeing God aright, <HI>but in the face of Jesus;</HI> no hope of mer∣cy from him, but in <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>WHATEVER notions you may have of God will be confounding, but not comforting, unless you view him as <HI>reconciled by the death of his son:</HI> For whose righteousness sake, he has declared him∣self <HI>well pleased.</HI> In <HI>the face of his anointed,</HI> the guil∣ty and condemned may read pardon and forgive∣ness, the weak see strength, the unholy purity and sanctification. Communicants may here <HI>see the land that is afar off,</HI> and their own right to possess it: The beholding king <HI>Jesus</HI> in his beauty, affords them this discovery. Thro' him they see their own right to <HI>glory, honour, and immortality.</HI></P>
<P>HERE they have, as it were, a draught in mini∣ature of all that glory and bliss that constitutes heaven, and makes up eternal happiness. This <HI>Jesus,</HI> which our text calls us to behold, is only seen in a Divine Testimony. You have no reason to ex∣pect any other but a rational view of him: For faith is nothing but the sublimest reason. It is the soul upon sufficient evidence, embracing the truth of the Divine character, manifested thro' the Son of God. Many mistake in thinking, that what reve∣lation calls grace and faith, is different from rea∣son; but if you consider this subject right, you will find that grace, faith, or whatever you please to call them, are no more but reason rightly directed, or sublime rationality.</P>
<P>THE phrases in Scripture, <HI>Behold! look! see, &amp;c.</HI> when applied to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> or any moral or Di∣vine object, mean no more but rightly to under∣stand
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>them, so as to believe them. Enthusiasts of different denominations have afforded matter of much scandal to religion, by taking images of ano∣ther sort into the notion of looking unto <HI>Jesus.</HI> They often allow their imaginations to make an <HI>image, and fall down and worship it.</HI> This is only mental idolatry. The representation of absent pictures to the imagination, will never help men to believe matters of fact expressed in a Testimony. The ob∣jects of faith are moral and rational, and cannot be reduced into any other form, but as facts and senti∣ments. The force of imagination may help devo∣tion, but cannot give any assistance to faith, which is rationally directed by the authority of God in his word. And this devotion, which is the effect of fancy and imagination, whatever heights it may ascend to, leaves still the devotee an unbeliever.</P>
<P>THE declaration of Divine truth in revelation, is the object of judgment, or moral feeling, not of imagination and fancy, which rather affects men mechanically, than morally and rationally. The communicant's exercise is to consider seriously that Testimony where the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> is recorded, and endeavour to understand it, and believe it: In so doing they will see <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the Scripture intends they should see him, viz. <HI>by the eyes of their mind,</HI> morally and spiritually. They ought to run over in their mind the Scripture ac∣count of his death and exaltation: Consider this as truth, and suitable for the ends and purposes for which it was revealed. This is an exercise worthy of those who attempt to commemorate the death of their Lord and Saviour.</P>
<P N="2">2. SEE the design of this holy ordinance of the Lord's supper: It presents to the enlightened un∣derstanding, <HI>righteousness coming down from heaven, and truth springing out of the earth:</HI> The grace and mercy of a righteous God, descending to men in the
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>death of his Son, symbolically represented in this sacrament: The truth of all the promises of his <HI>grace and goodness,</HI> growing up in your experience, supporting, nourishing, and upholding you in the way of holiness, purity, and perfection. It is the design of God in this ordinance, to represent his justice and righteousness, in making his Son <HI>die, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to himself.</HI> And to point out to us, that <HI>he is just when he justi∣fies the ungodly:</HI> That it is now consistent with his character, to bestow the best of his favours upon the guilty, without any infringement of his pure and perfect attributes.</P>
<P>THE death of <HI>Christ</HI> represented in this sacra∣ment, is the procuring cause of all these spiritual benefits that christians enjoy in this life, and of all that they have reason to hope for hereafter. It is this that is the continual reason of all their spiritual enjoyment, and will continue to be so for evermore. What our Lord suffered, is the very ground of his plea for his saints in heaven: <HI>I have finished the work thou gavest me to do, therefore glorify thou me: I will that these whom thou hast given me, be with me, to behold my glory.</HI> This ordinance is a memorial, designed to bring to our minds a glorious fact, upon which all our happiness dependeth. And who can consider this memorial, but must call to mind the fact? <HI>That the son of God died, and suffered at Jerusa∣lem,</HI> for the reasons mentioned in the Scripture, we are all bound to believe; and the sacrament is a sacred memorial to put us in mind of this fact, as an object of our faith and regard. It is by some called <HI>a feast upon a sacrifice;</HI> but I think but improperly, for what∣ever there might be of the nature of a sacrifice in the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> I can see nothing of this in the sacra∣ment of the supper. It is indeed a memorandum of the sacrifice of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> which he offered up for our sins, but has nothing in itself of that nature.</P>
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
<P>MY reasons for the foregoing assertion are, that the first institution had nothing of either a feast or a sacrifice in it. It immediately followed a feast, viz. <HI>the Passover,</HI> and it is not likely that our Lord and his apostles meant to take two feasts at the same time; <HI>he took the bread</HI> after they had eaten, <HI>and the cup</HI> after they had supped, and consecrated both; and told his disciples they were memorials of <HI>his body and blood,</HI> which were <HI>broken and shed for them,</HI> and that they were to <HI>do this in remembrance of him.</HI> There was here no more than a thanksgiving me∣morial of the sufferings of <HI>Christ,</HI> and we cannot certainly depart from the institution, without being guilty of <HI>will-worship.</HI> It is highly probable after our Lord and his apostles had finished the passover supper, that <HI>this bread and wine</HI> which they made use of, was a very small quantity, rather signifying their thankful acknowlegement of the mercies they enjoyed by <HI>Christ,</HI> than partaking of the nature of a feast.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the original institution of this ordinance, there was nothing either of a feast or a sacrifice in it. It was immediately appointed after a feast, when the communicants were not fit for feasting. Nor do we hear of any of the solemnities of a feast in it, except the blessing of the elements, which was used even in our Saviour's ordinary con∣duct in eating and drinking. His solemn <HI>blessing the bread and wine,</HI> is no argument for this ordinance being a feast, more than his <HI>blessing the loaves and fishes</HI> is any argument for it.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it a feast upon a sacrifice, for our Saviour was not yet offered up: And if this sacra∣ment was a feast upon a sacrifice, or after one, as some term it, then it was a different ordinance to the apostles then, from what it was afterwards. The truth is, it is a solemn memorial of a glorious fact, viz. <HI>That Christ suffered and died for our sins,</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>or a thankful acknowledgement of the Divine love manifested in the death of our Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>THE design of it is to <HI>bring to our remem∣brance</HI> the friendship and love of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>to shew forth his death till he comes again:</HI> To confirm our faith in the truth of this fact, that <HI>he died for our sins,</HI> to set forth his love to us in the highest degree, in <HI>that he loved us,</HI> and <HI>gave himself to the death for us.</HI> One cannot help observing the departure from the first institution that prevails among some chris∣tians, who from their practice would make men be∣lieve that the sacrament was not only a feast upon a sacrifice, but a sacrifice itself, when they cannot administrate it but at an altar. There was no such pageantry in the first appointment, nor did the pri∣mitive christians observe it. It has no doubt been the invention of those who first made it a real sacri∣fice, and so found out an altar for it also. The true and proper design of it is, <HI>to put us in remembrance of the death of our Saviour,</HI> to commemorate his love, and to enjoy mutual communion with him therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may see the proper medium through which we can behold the manifestations of the glory of God. The death and exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> are the true means thro' which we can behold the Divine splendour of the Divine nature. We only can be∣hold the Father in him, who says, <HI>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.</HI> Thro' this medium we may learn what is in heaven, by anticipation, and <HI>see the land that is afar off</HI> thro' the light of the son of righteousness. In this ordinance of the supper, you have the same object represented which fills heaven with glory, and the hosts there with love and admiration.</P>
<P>ALL the discoveries of the love of God, which give joy to men in this life, are made through the death of his <HI>well-beloved son, in whom he is well
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>pleased.</HI> For this purpose he is revealed, as he that was <HI>dead and is now alive, and liveth for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WE may reason to try ourselves whether or not we have as yet seen God thro' the death and exaltation of his son <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>—If so, then (1) The plan of grace exhibited in the New Covenant dispensation, will appear consistent and beautiful. Such as view the Divine character thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will see it consistent with God to save guilty sinners with honour to his blessed character. The love of God in this New Covenant plan will appear exceeding great and glo∣rious: For here the expensive method of venting his love, in consistency with his other attributes, will immediately present itself. Could the love of <HI>Jehovah</HI> express itself no other way but thro' the death of his well-beloved son, how great must it be to come over such a difficulty?</P>
<P>THIS appears a very consistent thing to those who understand the nature of the New Covenant, and the character of God displayed therein: For thro' <HI>Jesus Christ, mercy and truth meet together, righ∣teousness and peace kiss one another.</HI> It is an evidence those persons have not seen God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who accuse the covenant of grace with inconsisten∣cy, or seek happiness thro' any other scheme or contrivance. Those who reason against the satis∣faction of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> accuse this whole plan with inconsistency, and look upon it as a scheme of folly, and a creature of fancy. But christians who have viewed God right, thro' his only begotten son, will see that when he accepted of a satisfaction from <HI>Christ,</HI> he only opened a way for <HI>grace to abound to the-chief of sinners,</HI> and made it consistent for his truth and righteousness <HI>to justify the ungodly;</HI> and that there appears more wisdom in appointing of <HI>Christ</HI> for this end, than if he had merely forgiven sin without a satisfaction. By comparing <HI>Christ</HI>'s
<PB N="167" REF="171"/>fitness for his office of mediatorship, and his ful∣filling it, a sincere soul admires the wisdom of God, and adores his goodness.</P>
<P>IF the Almighty had forgiven sin without a sa∣tisfaction, the rebellious minds of sinners would have been more set upon sin, and presumptuously abused the goodness of God, which they do not∣withstanding; but when they consider how severe and just he is, they can have no reason to expect impunity. They cannot look for more favour than he gave his own son, whom he made suffer the cruel death of the cross, when he found him guilty by bearing the sins of others. <HI>If it was thus in the green tree, what must it be in the dry?</HI> A true christian sees this plan of salvation as the only con∣sistent way of saving sinners: The best scheme for encreasing true love, and preventing presumption. It pleases believers, because God is the author of it. It argues a very bad heart to find fault with the schemes of the Almighty, when we are not certain, but after our deepest search, that the mistake lies in our enquiry, not in that plan which we condemn. We ought not to measure the consistency of the Divine conduct by our weak understanding; for <HI>as the heaven is higher than the earth, so are his ways higher than our ways.</HI> A true believer has this per∣suasion in himself, that all God's dispensations are right, and that he cannot err; he believes it is right whatever God says or does.</P>
<P>THOSE that wish the covenant of grace were not as it is, or do not believe the account of it in Divine revelation, have not yet seen God through the glass of <HI>Christ</HI>'s death and exaltation. The death and exaltation of the Redeemer of men, were chief and principal articles of this covenant. It was agreed that when he should <HI>make his soul an offering for sin, he should see his seed; that he should have a name above every name: That at the name of
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess.</HI> This plan of grace was the joy and consolation of <HI>David</HI> when he was on his death-bed, <HI>Tho' my house be not so with God, yet he hath made with me a cove∣nant, ordered in all things and sure: And this is all my salvation, and all my desire, tho' he makes it not to grow.</HI> It is one of the ways <HI>Satan</HI> works upon our evil hearts of unbelief, to make us find fault with the plan of salvation, and thereby make us strike at the very foundation of our own happiness. It is a peculiar property of that faith that is of the opera∣tion of God to be satisfied with, and rests upon the scheme of the New Covenant for both present and future happiness.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE who have seen the Divine charac∣ter, shining thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will be changed and transformed with that discovery: By thus <HI>beholding the glory of God,</HI> they will <HI>be changed into the same image, from glory to glory.</HI> A right view of God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will have such an influence upon the mind, as to change the whole affections from earthly to heavenly things. It will change their notions of the Divine law: What was formerly burthen some and heavy, be∣comes now easy and light. The law of God, as soon as it is considered as <HI>Christ</HI>'s yoke, becomes easy and light. The soul assents to the words of <HI>Christ, My yoke is easy, and my burthen is light.</HI> By such a view of God's character, and the excellency of his law, a christian will say with <HI>David, I have said of thy commandments, that in all things they are right.</HI> Such a view of God <HI>in the face of Jesus,</HI> sets the purity and perfection of God's law, and the fullness of grace in opposition to one another, and shews that the precepts of righteousness are easy, when <HI>Jehovah is their righteousness and strength.</HI> This consideration of God, as in <HI>Jesus reconciled,</HI> affords to the soul a sure persuasion of receiving strength.
<PB N="169" REF="173"/>The soul can now say, <HI>I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.</HI> Every affection of the mind is hereby changed. By such a discovery of the Di∣vine character, <HI>in the face of Jesus, all things</HI> in the soul <HI>become new, old things are done away.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gives christians other views of good men than they formerly had. The saints that were be∣fore the objects of their ridicule and derision, they look upon as <HI>the excellent ones in the earth,</HI> and pla∣ces <HI>their delight in them</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI>'s sake. Having seen the excellency of God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> they are persuaded that all that belongs to him are ex∣cellent. From this consideration godly men be∣come sweet companions to such as before despised them, and are looked upon as the most useful mem∣bers of society. The relation they stand in to <HI>Christ,</HI> makes such as have seen God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Jesus,</HI> love them. This change extends to thoughts, words, and actions. It begets humility, and makes the true believer account himself <HI>less than the least of all saints.</HI> Such a view of God brings down all vanity. It was such a view of the Divine character, which made <HI>Job</HI> say, <HI>I loath and abhor myself in dust and ashes:</HI> And made <HI>Isaiah</HI> say, <HI>I am a man of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.</HI> Such a view of the Deity abaseth men in their own esteem: For it shews them that they are obliged to another for all their virtues and good qualifications.</P>
<P>MEN are naturally inclined to have an over∣high opinion of themselves, and to be filled with pride and vanity, at the thoughts of their own en∣dowments. This makes them unsociable, rash and inconsiderate: But when they get a sight of God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> they see of how little esteem these things are in the sight of God; who instead of valuing men for these conceived excellencies, only esteems them when they
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>lay them aside. It is this that brings down the <HI>haughtiness of man's looks, and lays him in the dust be∣fore his maker;</HI> it is this that <HI>stains the pride of all human glory,</HI> and brings men to <HI>deny themselves, and take up their cross and follow Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH a view of God will make the christian account these things loss, which formerly he ac∣counted gain, <HI>that he may be found in Christ, not having his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is of God by faith.</HI></P>
<P>THIS also makes men change their actions and manner of Life. Such things as formerly pleased their senses, and satisfied their unruly appe∣tites, are made bitter and unpleasant. The whole moral frame being changed by the view of God they have obtained thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> they have o∣ther sentiments of men and things, and change their manner of acting, to conform to their new sentiments. <HI>They walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</HI> The reason of this is, because they have got new views of the Divine character thro' him <HI>who is the image of the invisible God,</HI> and thereby un∣derstand, <HI>that there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>ACTION is the very life of religion, and may be called its visible existence. Where we see no good action, our charity can never direct us to think there is any religion: <HI>By their fruit ye shall know them.</HI> But all those who have seen the true character of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> thro' the death and exalta∣tion of <HI>Christ,</HI> will find themselves obliged <HI>to main∣tain good works.</HI> Wherever we see a conversation abounding in good actions, we ought according to the rules of charity believe they know the true character of God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> For there can∣not be an effect without a cause. The uncharita∣ble reasonings of men towards one another are very ungodly: Many are so uncharitable as to impute
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>false motives and ends to their fellow christians, when they cannot find fault with their actions; but this is unjust, <HI>for charity thinketh no evil.</HI> There is nothing more common, than if another will not subscribe our creed for us, to think all his good actions are of no value before God. But this is in effect to say, <HI>that we are the people, and wisdom shall die with us.</HI> For if any others excel us in virtuous actions, it is an evidence they know and believe the true creed of religion better than us.</P>
<P>THE man whose life and actions best express his conformity to the law of God, declares that he has the true judgment of his character: For it is only those <HI>who know God's name, who will put their trust in him.</HI> If a man should in words deny a pro∣position of which we are very fond of; but yet di∣rect his life according to the tenor of it, it shews that all the difference consists in words, and is no more but a misunderstanding of one another. If we find others in the path of virtue, and travelling heaven-ward, we have reason to believe, that they know and believe in the things that are there. I cannot help observing with sorrow, the error that contending parties, in religion, fall into upon this head. Each are so fond of their own definition of words and sentiments, that they imagine all others should understand them in the same light which they do; words are arbitrary, and every one may have his own mode of expression, and it rarely hap∣pens that we can fully understand one another's i∣deas by the words used to express them. Action is not so equivocal, it is this that best expresses our meaning. When actions are the same, there is strong presumption that actors have the same capital ideas, and ought not to differ about words.</P>
<P>SUCH a view of God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will likewise direct our words. Vain, idle, sinful words, are expressive of a bad heart: With these God is
<PB N="170" REF="176"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="171" REF="177"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>offended, and will at last punish the offenders if they do not repent. Those who have obtained distinct views of God through the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> will endeavour not to sin with their mouths. The tongue is like the index of the heart, <HI>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</HI> Such a discovery of God, as what we have already been mentioning, will fill the mouths of christians with praise, and make them beware of polluting their lips with vain and sinful conversation: It made <HI>David hate and shun the company of vain persons,</HI> and caused him to pray that God <HI>would set a watch before his heart, and keep the door of his lips.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an evidence that men have no knowledge of the Divine character, who allow themselves to speak rashly and unadvisedly in habitual conversa∣tion. Nor is it any evidence of the knowledge of God, but the contrary, when men slanderously ca∣lumniate one another. The upright man who knows the character of God, thro' <HI>Jesus Christ, will not take up a false report against his neighbours.</HI> This is a place of the world where there is much reason to fear; but very few have seen the Divine charac∣ter as displayed in a Redeemer. My reason for this is, the greatest part, even of those who would have religious characters, are continually employed either in raising or <HI>taking up false reports</HI> of one a∣nother. This is such an use of the tongue as no good man ever allowed himself to practise. It is an evidence of ignorance of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and that Spirit of holiness and truth, which directs the tongues and conversation of good and holy men. It is indeed in this place the fashion for men to employ their tongues in vile scandal, and <HI>taking up evil reports</HI> against the innocent. But it is only shewing the world their ignorance of God, and that they are unbelievers. It would appear to me, that many have been taught this practice by their reli∣gious
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>guides, for some of them are first in publish∣ing scandal with their tongues. But among whom this abounds, whatever be their character in other respects, their real character is, that they are un∣believers.</P>
<P N="3">3. A VIEW of God thro' <HI>Jesus Christ, as once dead, but now alive,</HI> will incline men to desire the same enjoyment to others. The woman of <HI>Sama∣ria</HI> had no sooner got a view of <HI>Jesus</HI> as the Messiah, and seen him who is the spirit and truth in him, than she ran speedily to acquaint her friends and fellow citizens of her discovery: <HI>Come see a man who told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Christ?</HI> Such as have tasted of the enjoyment of communion with God in truth and reality, want to make this privilege diffusive. When <HI>Philip</HI> found <HI>Christ,</HI> he went and told <HI>Nathaniel; We have found the Messiah, who is called Christ, of whom Moses and the prophets wrote.</HI> This discovery begets genero∣sity. The sincere soul, who has seen God thro' his well-beloved son <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is ready to embrace all men into the embraces of their good-will. This opens and expands the soul, as it were, and makes men of a true benevolent disposition. It disposes men to extend their good wishes and endeavours to all they can reach. The good-will of God ex∣hibited in that discovery they have of him thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> shews them the reason why they should love all men. If he was pleased, out of love, to do good to the ill-deserving, and to us when we were his enemies, we may see it is but just for us to imitate him in goodness. Such a discovery impresses the mind with the like tem∣per and disposition, so that a christian hereby <HI>has the same mind in him that was in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>THAT man that pretends to be a child of God, and is not kind and benevolent to his brethren and fellow-men, wants the most shining branch of that
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>character: For those who have seen the love of God thro' the medium of <HI>Christ</HI>'s death and exaltation, will love to make all others share of its influence as well as themselves. Their prayers, their endea∣vours, their study night and day will be, <HI>that Jerusa∣lem may have peace, that Israel may be saved.</HI> That religion that is wrapt up in private happiness, and extends not to the good of others, proceeds from a false view of the Divine character. There are some who mean no more by being religious but to e∣scape perdition, and <HI>have their souls for a prey;</HI> to get to heaven, whoever may go to hell; but such have not true and worthy notions of God, otherwise they would wish <HI>his kingdom to come</HI> in others as well as themselves. The law is, <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. SUCH as have seen God, thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> will lay aside all their own vain conceits and inventions. Man is no sooner born, <HI>but he seeks out many inventions;</HI> the greatest part of which are vain and sinful. Inventions about hap∣piness take up a great part of men's concern and time; and their chief thought is to have a hap∣piness according to their vain conceits thereof. Some have more gross, and others more refined notions of happiness; yet both are inventions of their own. When they consider the works of God, they determine what they think he should be, and what he ought to do. A sense of guilt, in some de∣gree, is inseparable from a guilty conscience; this puts men upon some inventions to contrive a cha∣racter for God suitable to their notions of happiness. Thus they often conceive of him, as a Being all goodness, only in relation to what they find they need, without considering whether it may answer the ends of Divine government. Their hopes and fears are directed upon a plan of their own, and they live by their own inventions.—As soon as they
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>are enabled to view God thro' the death of <HI>Jesus,</HI> they will see the folly of all their inventions, in seek∣ing to justify the way of God to men, any other way than by the death of his son <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>THAT consistency they were seeking in other schemes and methods, will appear best and brightest in the face of God's anointed. There the harmony of the Divine attributes will appear with full lustre; <HI>for mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace</HI> mutually <HI>embrace each other,</HI> in the New Co∣venant plan of salvation. It is there that the truth of the Divine threatning is verified, and mercy is vented to guilty men; for <HI>Christ,</HI> in dying, bore that curse that was threatned and due to sinners, <HI>in his own body on the tree,</HI> whereby the Divine veracity is ascertained, and God appears <HI>just in justifying the ungodly.</HI> No injustice or falshood can be laid to his charge, for he has fully executed his justice upon <HI>Christ.</HI> He is also full of goodness and mercy for <HI>Christ</HI>'s sake to men. Whatever a righteous law could demand, or justice require, was fulfilled in <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> This is the scheme that justifies the ways of God to men. This is the method that the soul fixes upon, when it views the character of God thro' the death of <HI>Christ.</HI> All former vain conceits are given up, and every foolish scheme which pride and vanity were fond of. The language of faith, and dependence upon God, now is, <HI>Surely in the Lord have I righteousness and strength.</HI> Every view of God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> is amiable and sweet, and all the properties of his na∣ture and character consistent.</P>
<P>EVERY other scheme but that which is mani∣fested in the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ,</HI> makes God either dreadful, or inconsistently good. All other mediums present God in some wrong point of view; but this sets forth his character as beauti∣ful, and clear of all contradiction: No impossibili∣ty
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>nor contradiction appears in his actions, nor the least error in his plans</P>
<P N="5">5. THOSE who have seen the glory of God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> will <HI>walk in the light.</HI> Every truth concerning the na∣ture and will of God, every mean appointed by him to carry forward men's views of God to more perfec∣tion, will be their constant study and delight. The believer looks forward, <HI>and presses towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apostle calls an attendance to the truth and ordinances of the gospel, <HI>A walking in the light,</HI> 1 John i. 7. <HI>Walk in the light, as he is in the light,</HI> and <HI>have fellowship one with another; and the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanseth you from all sin.</HI> The way of righteousness is clear, and a <HI>path of light,</HI> to such as have seen the Divine character displayed thro' the death and intercession of <HI>Christ.</HI> There are no objections that can be proposed, but there is an answer to them in <HI>Christ</HI>'s death and interces∣sion. This is called a <HI>walking in the light,</HI> to make an use and improvement of these in the use of all ordinary means. Christians who contemplate God thro' this blessed medium of the Mediatorship of <HI>Christ, walk in the light of God's law:</HI> This is a <HI>light unto their feet, and a lamp unto their path. They meditate upon God's law day and night.</HI> By a belie∣ving view of him that <HI>was dead, and is now alive,</HI> the true believer <HI>runs his race with patience, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of his faith.</HI> It is his study and endeavour to <HI>walk in the law of the Lord all the days of his life.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now conclude this subject with a short exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. BE constant in fixing the eyes of your mind upon this ever blessed medium, that you may see
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>those things that are invisible. If you consider the death and exaltation of <HI>Christ</HI> right, you may see those things that are hid from the eyes of sense and carnal reason. The mind may ascend as it were to heaven, and contemplate the joys of another life, thro' <HI>Christ</HI> who hath gone before <HI>to prepare a place for his people.</HI> The excellencies of another life can never be rightly understood, but by first con∣sidering the character of God, expressed in a Media∣tor. To be acquainted with that enjoyment which will make heaven to be what it really is, will make this present life a joy, and the thought of death de∣lightful. Our views of future happiness will afford great pleasure and satisfaction to our souls; when thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the true medium of communion with God, we learn that this happiness will consist in our being ever near to the Almighty, and ever enjoy his favour. The various thoughts of God that different persons have, are most of them un∣worthy, both of his revealed character, and of that profession of holiness christians pretend to. Some consider Deity at first hand (if we may so speak) and are disposed to deal with him without any Me∣diator: They do not think their circumstances so bad as to need the mediation of another. They do imagine they are not so blind and short-sighted, but they can contemplate the most distant Divine ob∣jects without the aid of any medium. But we ought to reflect upon what revelation has told us concerning <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord: That he <HI>is the true light that lighteneth every man that cometh into the world:</HI> That he came into this world to be the light of it, and the medium thro' which we may contemplate the Divine attributes, and see God with comfort and true satisfaction. When we therefore enquire after the nature and attributes of God, let us <HI>look</HI> first <HI>to Jesus the author and finish∣er of our faith:</HI> For it is thro' him we can know God
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>in a right and acceptable manner. It is he who sees <HI>Jesus,</HI> sees the Father; <HI>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,</HI> John xiv. 9. Consider then in the most serious manner the character of our Redeemer, if you would know the character of the true God; he hath made known the Father unto us: <HI>The only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Fa∣ther, he hath declared him.</HI> In contemplating the Divine character, consider him <HI>who was dead, and is now alive.</HI></P>

<P>OUR Lord and Redeemer manifests himself in this character, in our text, for the constant comfort of his church in all ages. He declares himself vest∣ed with all power and authority, to rule over and defend his people against all the designs of earth and hell. His being <HI>alive for evermore,</HI> refers unto his being the Mediator and Administrator of the New Covenant. That he is alive as God, is not here immediately referred unto: For his <HI>being alive,</HI> is opposed unto his <HI>being dead,</HI> which could never happen unto his Deity. For the comfort of the Apostle, the seven churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> and his people in all ages, he testifies, that he is the living execu∣tor of his own Testament, and <HI>is alive for evermore,</HI> to apply the benefits of it to them for whom he died; and whatever the <HI>Jews,</HI> or any others, might think of the mean appearance while here, in his state of humiliation, yet he was alive in human na∣ture, both for his own honour, and his people's e∣ternal comfort and advantage.</P>
<P>HE shews the Apostle that in his exalted state he was invested with full power and authority, to manage all things for his church's good, and that those things that were most to be feared, and could be least avoided by men, were in his hand: <HI>For he has the keys of hell and death.</HI> No man can prevent death, nor hell after it, if the guilt of sin be not taken away; but <HI>Christ</HI> is authorised, as <HI>the King of his church,</HI> to keep off death from his people till they be converted, and to restrain the powers of darkness, that they may not hurt his children in this world, nor hinder their happiness in the next. Hell and death are here figures of all the enemies of our salvation; and <HI>Christ having the keys</HI> of these, points out that he has all our enemies under his power and command: To this purpose the church ex∣presseth herself, Isa. xxxiii. 22. <HI>The Lord is our judge,
<PB N="181" REF="189"/>the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King, and will save us.</HI></P>
<P>Method 1st, To consider <HI>Christ</HI>'s Kingly Admi∣nistration, in his exalted state, towards his church here below in the midst of her enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2d, SHEW how much the christian's comfort de∣pends upon a right understanding thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> MAKE some improvement.</P>
<P>Head 1st, To consider <HI>Christ</HI>'s Kingly Admini∣stration, in his exalted state, towards his church here below in the midst of her enemies.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE prevents his chosen seed from falling in∣to absolute ruin and misery before their conversion. His prevenient goodness keeps them from being swallowed up by death and hell, while in a state of nature and under the curse. When <HI>they are chil∣dren of wrath even as others, and heirs of condemna∣tion, following divers lusts and pleasures,</HI> and nothing between them and eternal misery, but uncertain life, which every accident threatens to take away; he preserves them safe alive till Divine power reaches their souls, in the day of conversion, and they be∣come willing subjects to his government.</P>
<P>MANY times the grave seems to open its de∣vouring mouth to swallow them up in the midst of their sins and guilt, but <HI>Jesus</HI> has power over death, shuts the grave's devouring mouth, and they are preserved. Many messengers of mortality come to the christian's door before his conversion, and to all human probability, are likely to carry him off to hell and endless misery; but as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> keeps <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> these messen∣gers cannot harm any without his warrant. He brings them back <HI>from the gates of death,</HI> and saves them from ruin and destruction. This was the <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s experience, Psal. ciii. 4. <HI>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction, and crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies.</HI> When the powers of
<PB N="182" REF="190"/>darkness are by their influence hurrying on the per∣son to death and destruction, and as it were tri∣umphing in their <HI>lawful captive,</HI> and every lust and prejudice in the heart concurring to post him on to the shelves of ruin and death; when wicked companions strengthen these prejudices, and false friends sooth him up with the safety of his present condition, so that he is to all appearance locked fast up, and secured in the prison of spiritual death, and ready for eternal ruin; <HI>Satan</HI> wants nothing but the key of natural death to send him into the prison of hell; even in this critical period he is pre∣served. He who <HI>lives for evermore,</HI> is himself Lord of that power, and keeps both the keys of spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual and temporal death: <HI>So he openeth and no man shut∣teth, and shutteth and no man openeth.</HI> Tho' <HI>Satan</HI> keeps his prisoner fast till the appointed time, yet <HI>Christ</HI> is master of the keys himself, and has power to open when he pleaseth. And as he keeps the door of natural death shut, till the time determined, so he looses the bands of spiritual death, opens the door, and sets the prisoner free. For this reason he is invested with this power, Isa. lxi. 1. <HI>The Lord God hath anointed me to open the prison doors to them that are bound.</HI> Which bringeth me to observe.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT this living <HI>esus,</HI> the Lord of his church, in his Divine administration, gives also effectual grace, and renewing influence to his people. This is the way he uses his power and authority, in saving his people from spiritual death and the dominion of sin. This power he exerciseth in the way of opening, as he before made use of in the way of shutting, <HI>for he openeth and none can shut.</HI> Tho' the heart be shut against him, and locked up with many prejudices and passions; every corrupt lust and affection, like so many bolts or bars in the soul, make resistance against the evidence of Divine truth, and the power of Divine grace; yet <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> opens them all.</P>

<P>HE removes men's ignorance with the key of knowledge. Ignorance of God, our interest and duty, is like a strong bar that keeps us fast under the power of sin: For. <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>without knowledge the heart is not good:</HI> But <HI>Christ</HI> in the day of effectual calling, enlightens the mind in the knowledge of himself, by the power of his blessed Spirit: Brings home the evidence of Divine tru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h with power upon the soul. He makes them <HI>that were sometime darkness, become light in the Lord.</HI> He was invested with the dignity of keeping the keys of hell and death, that he might <HI>open the eyes of the blind, to bring forth the prisoners out of prison; and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house,</HI> Isa. xlii. 7.</P>
<P>DIVINE knowledge is to the soul what a key is to one in a dark dungeon; it lets in light to the mind, by opening the blinded understanding, and refreshing the soul with the view of new and de∣lightful objects. <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Proverb</HI> is true in this case, in an eminent sense: <HI>Surely the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun.</HI> Our Redeemer by his Divine power opens the darkened mind, that has long been shut against the evidence of Divine truth; and the soul that was like a dungeon for darkness, is now made like a palace for light and beauty.</P>
<P>THESE truths of which the soul had no true knowledge before, nor beheld any beauty or excel∣lency in, shine forth with splendour and glory. The Redeemer by this means opens the understanding, frees the mind from the power of ignorance, and makes a glorious light shine into the soul. This key of knowledge, applied by the blessed Spirit of <HI>Jesus</HI> to the soul, makes one both know God and himself. It sets his character in the most lively view before the mind, and presents the lovely relations he stands in to men by a Redeemer. What of the
<PB N="184" REF="192"/>Divine character was hid before, or at least not rightly understood, but appeared as foolishness to the mind, now appears to be the most eminent branch of knowledge. <HI>Christ,</HI> who seemed to the ignorant soul <HI>as a root out of a dry ground,</HI> appears to the mind <HI>altogether lovely;</HI> and such as have this discovery, <HI>determine to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified.</HI> It makes them know the useful∣ness of the Redeemer, and causeth them, like <HI>Na∣thaniel,</HI> to say, <HI>Thou art the son of God, thou art the king of Israel:</HI> Or like <HI>Thomas, My Lord, and my God.</HI> It lets the soul into noble and distinguishing dis∣coveries. It is like a key that opens the door of a palace, where all the <HI>magnalia</HI> of state are seen, where the rights of the kingdom are beheld, the statutes and laws are laid open: Or it is a letting in the soul to the understanding of what God in <HI>Christ</HI> is to them that believe in him; in whom they see all things good for the present, and glorious and good things to come. The soul who knew nothing of God's method of reconciliation before, nor had the least understanding of the scheme of salvation, is by this Divine knowledge let in to the great <HI>arcana</HI> of salvation, and made to understand the glory of <HI>Christ,</HI> the king of his church, and to see the splendour of his kingdom.</P>
<P>BY this key of knowledge, <HI>Christ,</HI> who <HI>lives for evermore,</HI> lets his people into the knowledge of themselves. Many things that lay hid and un∣perceived in the time of ignorance, are now laid open to our view. The deceitfulness of the heart is laid open, by bringing in the knowledge of the truth into the mind. It is by this that <HI>the candle of the Lord</HI> is lightened in the soul, by which a man sees <HI>the plagues of his own heart.</HI> The evidence of the truth upon the conscience, is a light in the soul that the key of knowledge lets in, by opening up to the understanding <HI>the hidden works of darkness.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="193"/>It is this that opens <HI>the chambers of imagery, and digs a hole through the wall</HI> of ignorance, and discovers the rivals of the Almighty in the soul. By this key, the secret springs of pride, atheism and un∣belief, are laid open and exposed to view. This like a clue leads conscience thro' all the latent turn∣ings of iniquity in the soul, and discovers to man what he really is. This key of knowledge, is by the Redeemer made to operate in the conscience, by which it is enabled to search out the most hidden actions, and to find out their springs and first prin∣ciples: Hereby it is enabled and capacitated to banish the dominion of deadly prejudices out of the soul. After this manner does our ever living Re∣deemer deliver his people from ignorance.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST frees his people from obsti∣nacy, by the key of powerful persuasion. Our souls by nature are in bondage, as to chusing what is pure and holy; for tho' our will hath a power to chuse whatever it doth embrace, yet the corruption of our nature is such, that the will cannot chuse in a holy and pure manner. There is a natural li∣berty essential to the human will, so that it never can be forced in any condition; yet, till by the power of Divine truth it be freed from its corrup∣tion, it never chuseth both freely and purely. There is an opposition to purity in the human will since the fall of our first parents; so that men in an unconverted state make choice of evil instead of what is good. Not that any man will chuse what he is persuaded is evil; but thro' ignorance of the truth, he mistakes evil for good, and at last thro' the influence of habit and custom, is unwilling to act otherwise than he hath done. What men have had a long pleasure in, tho' it may be bad, they will find their inclination follows after, even contrary to their judgment. The will of man may be com∣pared to a spring that is made to open two ways,
<PB N="186" REF="194"/>or indifferently to incline to either side; but being spoiled, only opens one way. The human will at first, was free to either good or evil; but as soon as it was corrupted by the deceit of the evil one, the equal ballance of its power now inclined to the wrong side.</P>
<P>IT is indeed still free, that it is not forced to chuse any object, but is determined to act by its own liberty; yet purity is far from being the object of its liberty. It is goodness that now de∣termines the human will; but holiness and purity are not taken into the notion of this goodness. When human liberty was in its perfection, purity was the chief of what was accounted goodness; but since the deceit of the father of lies entered into the hearts of men, they have had a deceitful sense of liberty ever since.</P>
<P>WHAT men often account liberty, is indepen∣dency; and pretending to have a liberty to chuse or do what they please, they make themselves inde∣pendent beings. The will of man, like the spring we mentioned, was at first capable to chuse either good or evil, and while free of the deceit of the evil one turned the right way; but no sooner did the enemy of God and man deceive our first parents, and diseminate his poison into human nature, than rebellion, his genuine offspring, took up the pos∣session of the human will. Tho' all the fraud he was master of could not destroy a consciousness of guilt; yet ever after this fatal event, the will of mankind hath been obstinate against holiness and purity.</P>
<P>THO' our wills may outwardly seem to be open by a free volition towards what suits the depraved propensity of the human heart; yet when the motives of choice are considered, we will find that the choice is ill directed, and that all the liberty ungodly men are possessed of, consi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s in not being forced by any external cause. The will of a wicked
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>man is even as free as that of a good one, in chusing what suits his inclination; and in no sense can he be said to be forced, otherwise he would not be wor∣thy of blame for what he made choice of; but then his liberty runs in a deceitful channel, and he freely chuses what is really hurtful to himself. But <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> reaches home persuasion to the soul, and rectifies the inward principle of chusing, and turns power of election another way. It unde∣ceives the soul, and sets it free of that deceitful sense of liberty which directed its choice the wrong way. This powerful persuasion inclines that power we call the will, to take in purity and holiness into the notion of goodness. This determines the soul to chuse not only what is relatively good, but what is really so.</P>
<P>WE must not at the same time imagine that any finite being hath an independent liberty, for this would put them out of the order of creatures, and equal them with their Creator: So the freest choice men can be supposed to have, is a choice to be a servant under him whom he acknowledgeth to be his God. When man departed from his Ma∣ker's service, he then denied him to be his supreme master, and chose another who is called the god of this world. Then his liberty was dependent upon the will of his new god, which he had now submit∣ted unto. He now had a will and liberty to do the reverse of what he had done before, because he acknowledged his dependence upon another lord, whose service is very different from that of his first master. We then must conclude that the human will is free, dependently upon the master it is under. There is no such liberty in the will as to allow it to serve two masters; our Lord tells us this is <HI>im∣possible; ye cannot serve two masters.</HI> For when men are free as to one sovereign, they are in subjection to another. There is indeed a power in the mind
<PB N="188" REF="196"/>of man to change its master, but this is effected by persuasion, as at first, when <HI>Satan</HI> persuaded our first parents to change their God, and submit to him. Our Lord, who has all authority to save men, when he changes their will, does the reverse of what the Devil did at first persuade them, to <HI>return to their first master.</HI></P>
<P>HE who has <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> persuades and enables his chosen ones to use their natural li∣berty the right way: <HI>For whom the son maketh free, they are free indeed.</HI> And this he doth by making the key of persuasion reach their heart. The li∣berty which men enjoy in a state of sin and misery, is comparative slavery when opposed to that free∣dom that the <HI>citizens of the saints</HI> enjoy. Though they have their own choice, it is misery to have it, when it proves their hurt. But <HI>Jesus</HI> makes his people chuse what is purely good, and enables them to say of <HI>God's commandments, that in all things they are right.</HI> This choice is not effected by force, for the will cannot be forced; for all compulsion de∣stroys choice, but is effected by persuasion. <HI>Jesus</HI> our Lord, <HI>who hath the keys of hell and death,</HI> gains the consent of the heart, by the charms of truth, in which he holds forth his own excellencies, and graciously draws and inclines that power we call the will. Conversion is not violence committed upon human liberty, nor a driving men by force from <HI>Satan</HI>'s kingdom; <HI>Christ</HI> receives none but such as he makes truly willing. The word of the gospel constrains sinners by the sweetness of its call, and draws them into a liking of itself and the objects it proposes, by shewing how agreeable they are to that condition it finds men in. For this reason it is called <HI>a joyful sound.</HI> Psal. lxxxix. 15. <HI>Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound.</HI> The gospel is an address to conscience, which, if you will, you may call the moral sense, and operates upon it as
<PB N="189" REF="197"/>agreeable music doth upon our sense of hearing. When a skilful musician plays well, he will gain the approbation of our ear, tho' we had no design to be charmed with his music; yet we cannot re∣fuse the approbation that our pleasure in the music obligeth us to give. We cannot at the same time say that we are forced, because our approbation flows from pleasure. The same may be said of a beautiful picture, where variety and unity meet to please; we cannot refuse our approbation, for the pleasure arising from the sense of seeing produceth it; yet we cannot say that there is any force put upon us, but beauty charms us into approbation. <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> when he gains the approbation and consent of the soul, makes his word produce the same effects upon our moral part, that these do to our sensitive part, and charms the soul into an approbation of his own excellencies.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who has the power of hell and death,</HI> removes the enmity of the heart by the key of love. By this Divine principle he opens the hard heart, and raises the affections <HI>to things that are above.</HI> The love of <HI>Christ</HI> constrains the soul to obedience, and removes that enmity that is op∣posite to the law of God. Enmity in the heart makes a strong resistance against these tender sen∣timents that ought to fill the breast of every good and virtuous man; like a rusty spring it opposes the motions of the Spirit of love, till overcome by that superior principle. This Divine principle melts the soul, and opens the avenues to the heart, till at last it is made to say with the church, <HI>Thy love is better than wine.</HI> Men are naturally dead to all the tender sentiments of love and true affec∣tion to God, and what is truly good; but our Re∣deemer, <HI>who has power over hell and death,</HI> opens the heart to receive the tender sentiments and im∣pressions of love, and enables the soul to yield obe∣dience
<PB N="190" REF="198"/>to that precept; <HI>My son give me thine heart.</HI> This love is like oil to all the springs of motion and action in the soul: It relaxes the whole mind, and makes it pliable to the will of God. This truly Divine principle makes men like God, <HI>good and gentle to all men,</HI> and removes that sourness which wicked obstinacy had fixed in the moral constitu∣tion. It forms the soul into the likeness of God, whose character is <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. HE who has <HI>power over hell and death,</HI> sets limits and bounds to the wrath of his people's ene∣mies, and restrains all the violence of their spiritual foes: Hence the <HI>Psalmist</HI> says, <HI>The wrath of man shall praise thee, the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</HI> The enemies of the saints may make them afraid, but they cannot destroy them. They may really form very deadly plots against them, which if they were carried into execution, would issue in their ruin and destruction; but as <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>their Lord and King,</HI> the Administrator of the Covenant of grace, and hath all power committed unto him for his people's good and advantage, so he exerts it for their deliverance. The designs of devils and wicked men may be deeply laid, their purposes of wickedness well concerted, and no di∣ligence wanting to execute them; but he who hath <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> disconcerts their measures, and overturns all their schemes. When the chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> were shut up between <HI>Migdol</HI> and the sea, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his host seemed well satisfied in their own minds, that they were able either to give them a total overthrow, or to bring them back again to <HI>Egypt</HI> to keep them in bondage: They had also the sentence of death within themselves, and were very much afraid. But their Divine go∣vernor bounded the malice of their enemies, and by a turn of the key of his power and providence, shut up the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in the prison of the depth;
<PB N="191" REF="199"/>and by another exertion of his power, opened a way for his people to pass safely <HI>through the flood on foot.</HI> Often the true fearers of God are so beset with their powerful enemies, that to all human probability there is no way left for their escape, and were it not that their Redeemer is <HI>mighty, and ready to save them,</HI> nothing could preserve them. Sometimes it most eminently appears that <HI>Christ</HI> sets bounds to the fury of his people's enemies, when nothing but his Divine power could rescue them out of the snares that are laid for them. The turning of the key of providence is so visible, <HI>that he that runs may read it;</HI> then it is evident that the Lord's right∣hand <HI>brings salvation</HI> to them. When temptations are so laid, so suited to the inclinations of men, that they are ready to fall in with them every mo∣ment, the goodness of God either removes the ob∣ject, or fortifies the mind against the temptation, quite contrary to their expectation. And even when the christian is most treacherously betrayed by his spiritual foes, and as it were shut up like a prisoner in the midst of a party of the prince of darkness's auxiliaries, contrary to his stated inclination; he who has <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> opens an effectual door of deliverance, <HI>and restores the soul again for his name sake.</HI> He brings the soul thus distressed <HI>out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, and sets it upon a rock, and establishes its goings.</HI> This he doth by turning its inclinations, by the power of his grace, and inclining the mind more resolutely to follow that which is good, holy, and pure. In this he shews that he hath <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. HE limits their trials that arise from the enemies of religion, and the powers of darkness. There is a necessity that christians have trials, to make them learn <HI>hardness, as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.</HI> So <HI>Jesus,</HI> their Lord and Saviour, permits these; but he sets limits unto them that they cannot
<PB N="192" REF="200"/>go beyond his will: <HI>The heathen may rage, and the people imagine a vain thing; but he that sits in heaven shall laugh at them, the Lord shall hold them in de∣rision. He hath set his king upon his holy hill of Zion,</HI> and <HI>given him all power in heaven and earth,</HI> for the advantage of his church and people. Tho' he sometimes lets loose the enemies of his church a little, he still keeps the keys in his own hand, and limits their power, that they cannot go beyond the set bounds. He makes use of <HI>the powers of hell and death</HI> to chastise his children, but keeps them still under his own dominion and power.</P>
<P>THE Redeemer may lengthen out their chain, but never lets them altogether loose: By his power he again restrains them, and shuts them up in con∣finement. He makes them, contrary to their in∣tentions, work good to his servants. Neither <HI>prin∣cipalities nor powers</HI> can go beyond the will of him who has <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI> Death itself acts only a friendly part to the children of God: The Redeemer makes use of death as a key to open a door to let the saints into heaven, so that what in itself is most awful, the administration of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> makes most profitable and advantageous to those who fear him. By his death he hath dis∣armed death of its sting, that it cannot really hurt any who belong to him. And tho' he may make use of it, for a trial and exercise to good men, even in that respect he makes it turn out to their ad∣vantage. That persuasion made the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> triumph over death, 1 Cor. xv. 55. <HI>O death, where</HI> is <HI>thy sting? O grave, where</HI> is <HI>thy victory? The sting of death</HI> is <HI>sin; and the strength of sin</HI> is <HI>the law. But thanks</HI> be <HI>to God, that giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Head 2d, To shew how much the christian's comfort dependeth upon a right understand∣ing
<PB N="193" REF="201"/>of this administration of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in his exalted state.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE knowledge of this, makes them see the possibility of doing their duty. The strict and holy prcepts of God's law, point out duties far a∣bove the natural strength of any fallen creature; and when men consider the perfection of this holy rule of righteousness, they are ready to think that it is impossible for them to observe all or any of its precepts; and indeed it is truly impossible for any imperfect man to observe them right. When∣ever the believer considers this, and cannot find liberty in his own mind to neglect them, and finds no power to perform them, the understanding of <HI>Christ</HI>'s administration, as a head of Divine influ∣ences, joyfully removes the difficulty. When be∣lievers consider him as the fountain of all grace and strength, no duty seems either heavy or impossible; but with <HI>Paul,</HI> they will say, <HI>We can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth us.</HI> There is not the least possibility when christians look to themselves that ever they shall discharge one obligation they lie under, nor can they find how to discharge their consciences of the obligation: But when they un∣derstand that <HI>Christ</HI> is exalted <HI>to give power to them that have no might,</HI> and to enable them <HI>both to will and to do of his good pleasure,</HI> they see not only a possibility, but a certainty of discharging their duty in his strength.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Israelites</HI> were at the waters of <HI>Jor∣dan,</HI> they could not learn how to answer the com∣mandment, to go <HI>over to the promised land,</HI> till they understood the Divine administration, by <HI>the ark and the priests going before them.</HI> But what was im∣possible to their sense, was certain and easy to their faith; and when they understood that God was en∣gaged to defend them, and had promised to bring them into that land, they were encouraged to go
<PB N="194" REF="202"/>forward in the confidence of succeeding. When the Moral Law binds to some very important duty, and providence calls us to discharge it, but no in∣ward disposition seems to incline us thereto, what could we do but succumb at the thought, were it not by attempting we are assured of the promise to bear us thro'. The true christian is encouraged to go on, because <HI>his King is upon his head,</HI> and hath promised to <HI>give him grace, and withold no good thing from him</HI> when he needs it.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI>'s administration affords to believers a view of the end of all their crosses and afflictions. If <HI>Jesus</HI> be the administrator of the New Covenant, in his exalted state, for the benefit of his people here below in the midst of their enemies, then as he is ascended above all crosses and troubles, as <HI>their Lord and head,</HI> they have reason to believe that he will deliver them out of all their afflictions also: His promise they may safely depend upon, <HI>for he will not leave them till he hath done what he hath spoken to them of.</HI> He hath promised <HI>that if they suffer with him, they shall also reign with him.</HI> As Christ is appointed to manage the whole concerns of his church and chil∣dren, so his honour is engaged to bring them all to a happy issue. The understanding of this must certainly be very comforting to every christian; for hereby they are assured of a blessed deliverance from all trouble. Tho' trials may be heavy in the mean time, yet the certainty of safe deliverance out of them at last, will make men bear them with more patience, and will support the minds altho' much oppressed otherwise. It is such an under∣standing that makes present afflictions seem light, and made the Apostle account his suffering but light; says he, <HI>Our light afflictions are but for a mo∣ment, and work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Christ</HI> in his sufferings was an ex∣ample
<PB N="195" REF="203"/>to his disciples and followers, as well as the procuring cause of their happiness; and he, when he <HI>had finished his sufferings, entered into his glory.</HI> To make his people follow his glorious example with patience, he reveals unto them in his word, that the design of his administration is to put an end to their sufferings and crosses, as he hath got beyond all his.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE understanding of this administration of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> gives the christian a view of the end of his faith and obedience. Dependence upon God, and obedience to his law, would not be a reasonable service, unless some end were proposed in depending upon, and obeying <HI>Jehovah.</HI> While men are ignorant of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the character he sustains, as the administrator of the New Cove∣nant, they remain ignorant of the end of men's de∣pendence upon God. Hence it happens that self-dependence supplies the room of our dependence upon our Maker, and all the end that men in this condition propose to themselves, is self. Their own honour, interest and pleasure, are substituted in the room of the will and pleasure of the God of truth. As they know not the reason of <HI>Christ</HI>'s exaltation, they have no dependence upon him, so they walk on in the forbidden path of pride and self-dependence: After all, they have no certainty of attaining to the end they propose, <HI>viz.</HI> satisfaction from the objects they pursue, but are often mortified with disappointments and losses, as to those things they had chiefly in view; so they lose their end.</P>
<P>BUT the true believer who is acquainted with <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the Administrator of the Covenant of Grace, sees the end of his faith and dependence upon him in the truest and clearest point of view. The end of faith and dependence upon God is, to give him all the glory in our salvation; and with reference unto us, it is the salvation of our souls.
<PB N="196" REF="204"/>That we shall attain to this, we are only certain from our first knowing what relation <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> stands in to us. When we once come to the un∣derstanding that he is the <HI>author and finisher of our faith,</HI> we come also to some certainty according to the measure of our understanding, that we shall at∣tain to the end that is proposed to our dependence on God. The want of, or the weakness of our faith, arises from the want of, or weakness of our understanding of the end thereof: For no man who labours without having the understanding of the end and reason of his service, will have any true pleasure in his exercise. The believer in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who knows that he is <HI>exalted,</HI> to dispense Divine grace and power to his people, is persuaded he shall not fall short of his end: For his Redeemer <HI>will not forget his work and labour of love.</HI> When men's crosses are many and heavy, their trials beyond their ordinary strength, they can hardly see any reason to conclude that they should attain to the end they first proposed to their faith in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> were they not persuaded that he will even make these turn out to their good, and bring them nearer to the end of their faith. It affords the greatest comfort to the children of God to <HI>know that their Redeemer liveth,</HI> and is appointed to take care of their interests, when they themselves are in their worst circumstances. By contemplating his charac∣ter, as the Lord who hath <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> they are enabled to forget all things but one; and to say in the language of the <HI>Psalmist, One thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek after, that all the days of my life I may dwell in the house of the Lord,</HI> to behold his beauty.</P>
<P>THERE are few, if any enterprises, that any finite creature can perfect in an instant, to say no∣thing of weak debilitated creatures like men. There is therefore need of strength and support, to carry
<PB N="197" REF="205"/>on a work, in order to have it finished. He who engages in a service, in hope of having his reward, will at the same time have little ground for his hope, unless he have security for these necessary things that are needful to support him during the time of his service. It will considerably animate him in his obedience to his master's commands, to be certified that he shall be well supplied with all necessary things during the time of his service.</P>
<P>WHEN christians have the certain knowledge that their Redeemer is appointed and authorised to give them all needful supplies of grace and strength while they are in this world, they can then see the end of <HI>their faith, and labour of love,</HI> as a cer∣tain and sure thing. To all opposition and temp∣tations, their reply is ready, <HI>I can do all things thro' Christ that strengtheneth me: I know he will keep that which I have committed to him against that day.</HI> In the midst of all wants and weakness, wanderings and backslidings, the christian can say, <HI>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He restoreth my soul again, and causeth me to walk in the paths of righte∣ousness, for his name sake. He will perfect what con∣cerneth me.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI>'s administration, as vested with all power and authority for the hap∣piness of his people, affords them a certain evidence that they shall enjoy a glorious reward in another life. When men confine their views merely to the analogy of nature, or what notions they have of God from that analogy, they will remain still ignorant of what is to happen in the life to come. That there is any reward to virtue beyond the grave, is probable, but not certain from any discoveries of natural religion: For God may, for any thing we know from natural principles, termi∣nate our existence with our death. Neither is it contrary to his character, not to reward our services
<PB N="198" REF="206"/>with immortality, when they are not in their highest perfection, worthy of such a reward as eternal life and immortal glory. The whole sum of the argu∣ments taken and used from natural religion, comes to this, <Q>That virtue be rewarded according to “its proportion, or men receive the just reward ”of their works.</Q> But it will be hard to prove according to any principle of natural religion, that any human service deserves an eternal and immor∣tal life of bliss and happiness. And as for future punishments for misdeeds, the knowledge of their eternity arises also from revelation, not from na∣tural religion: For it will be very difficult to find from thence, that an action of a finite creature de∣serves eternal torment. Especially if we cannot find any express law or precept that they have transgressed. The greatest length we can go on this point is, to judge from feeling, and to estimate the Divine conduct from our fears, as in the former case we do from our hopes; whereas for want of the determined purpose of his will, we are uncertain but both are delusory. The most which can be said of all the arguments used upon this subject, from what is called Natural Religion is, that they are probable, but do not absolutly ascertain the truth.</P>
<P>BUT the knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Divine admini∣stration in the gospel, gives us certainty of a blessed and glorious reward <HI>laid up for them that fear God. Christ</HI> is appointed the blessed trustee of all good things in this life, <HI>for those that fear him,</HI> and the great judge and distributor of glory in the next: <HI>I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.</HI> When we are certain of <HI>Christ</HI>'s appointment <HI>to give grace and glory,</HI> and of his good intentions for this pur∣pose, we have all the certainty we could wish, that such as believe in him shall be rewarded with eter∣nal life, in the full enjoyment of God for ever: For <HI>Christ</HI> hath promised to his disciples, <HI>Because I
<PB N="199" REF="207"/>live, ye shall live also. I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am, ye may be also.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>last</HI> thing in the method was to make some improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may see a door of hope for believers in their worst circumstances. The christian may be surrounded with many enemies, and these the most powerful; yet when he looks to him who hath <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> he beholds salvation and de∣liverance at hand. Tho' all human probability should speak the contrary, and the believer should see no way of escape; yet as soon as he considers him, <HI>who openeth what none can shut,</HI> he sees <HI>the day of his redemption drawing near.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH it may happen that a good man's enemies may really seem to have him in their power, that all concurring circumstances may out∣wardly agree to favour their designs, as was the case with <HI>David</HI> when <HI>Saul</HI> hunted him around the mountains; and when all was taken from him, and the people spake of stoning him; yet they never altogether want hope, <HI>but encourage themselves in their God.</HI> And this hope of believers is well founded, and never fails them, nor disappoints them. The experience of the saints can bear witness, that <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> their Almighty Lord, effects their de∣liverance, when all human wisdom would have des∣paired of deliverance: <HI>When all refuge fails them, and no man takes care for their souls, Jesus</HI> rescues them from the hands of their enemies, <HI>according to bis wisdom and good purpose concerning them.</HI> Tho' snares may be cunningly laid, and deep counsels taken against the friends of <HI>Christ,</HI> he disconcerts these designs, <HI>breaks the snares,</HI> and his people e∣scape. When great power is joined with deep ar∣tifice, and to all appearance resistance is vain; yet then the Lord breaks the power of his saints' foes, as he did that of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> in the deep: <HI>Their Re∣deemer
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>is mighty, the Lord of Hosts is his name.</HI> Tho' <HI>Satan</HI> may have his temptations well suited to the natural constitution of the christian, and a∣dapted every way to his natural temper, that to all probability he must fall before the stratagem, and be caught in the snare; yet he who keeps <HI>the keys of hell and death, with the temptation also, finds out a way of escape,</HI> by either fortifying the mind with strength, or removing the temptation: He breaks the hellish inchantment, and sets his people free. This the church acknowledgeth in her experience, Psal. cxxiv. <HI>Had not the Lord been upon our side, when our enemies rose up against us, they had over∣whelmed us: our soul had sunk beneath the stream. But the snare is broken, and we have escaped.</HI> A view of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Divine administration, as the King and Lord of his church, opens a glorious door of hope, when all other comfort and hope is gone: The believer is like <HI>Elisha</HI>'s servant, when the Lord opened his eyes, sees God for his defence, <HI>like chariots of fire, and horses of fire</HI> to protect him. The right understanding of our Lord's administra∣tion, in his exalted state, among his people here below in the midst of their enemies, enables them <HI>to hope against hope,</HI> and affords them satisfaction contrary to all human probability. Tho' like <HI>Job</HI> they have no worldly comfort, they rejoice in this, <HI>that their Redeemer liveth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. SEE the design of all Divine ordinances and institutions. It is to render homage to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the only King and Head of his church. <HI>John</HI>'s letters to the seven churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> are prefaced with some striking evidences of <HI>Christ</HI>'s power and headship, and the force of all the duties these churches are exhorted to, is derived from his royal character, as, <HI>He who liveth, and was dead, and is alive for evermore, Amen; and hath the keys of hell and death.</HI> All ordinances are misapplied that
<PB N="201" REF="209"/>are not thus directed. Whatever ordinances in the church are not immediately derived from his authority, are will-worship and superstition. All homage must be paid to him <HI>who hath the keys of hell and death.</HI> In our improvement of every or∣dinance, we must keep this in our eye, otherwise we misimprove the institutions of <HI>Christ,</HI> and put them out of their true order. This ordinance of our Lord's Supper, which we are called this day to celebrate, must be observed in the way of paying homage to him, <HI>who hath the keys of hell and death:</HI> This duty is founded upon his royal commandment, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me;</HI> and <HI>where the word of a King is, there is power.</HI> Tho' our Redeemer hath condescended so far as to admit worms of his foot∣stool to eat and drink in his presence, yet they ought to remember in whose presence they are: And consider in the most intimate communion with him, there ought to be the deepest humility, as an homage due to him. The communicants about the throne, <HI>cast their crowns from their heads,</HI> is to∣ken of their willingness to pay him homage; and communicants here below must remember the same is due from them.</P>
<P>It is an evidence he deserves our deepest reve∣rence and greatest homage, because he is the au∣thor of this ordinance, and all the enjoyments we have in it, is his free gift; all that his friends enjoy in the sacrament of the supper is of his providing: He gives them all things in this communion freely and liberally. The homage that is due unto him is thanksgiving, for all his true friends and subjects are under an obligation to praise him: To say with the church, <HI>We will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord: we will pay our vows unto the Lord, in the presence of all his people:</HI> We will pay homage to him that hath <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>
<PB N="202" REF="210"/>
<P N="3">3. LEARN the security of the believer's hap∣piness. It is secured in the hands of him that hath <HI>the keys of hell and death;</HI> who is intrusted with all their concerns. If <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is intrusted with the salvation and happiness of his saints, then they must be saved, for he is <HI>both able and willing</HI> to do it. That he is able, our text is a certain proof; for he hath <HI>the keys of hell and death, he opens and none can shut, he shutteth and none can open.</HI> That he is willing, the revelation of him as well qualified for that end is a testimony. This character of our Redeemer would afford but little comfort to his people, if sin or <HI>Satan,</HI> or any cause whatever could hinder their salvation. Could the prince of dark∣ness wrest <HI>the keys of hell and death</HI> out of his hand, <HI>Who then could be saved?</HI> Neither would homage be due to him if he had not infinite power and per∣fection. But as he hath all power in heaven and in earth, he enjoys it for his people's good and ad∣vantage, and is disposed to apply it for their eter∣nal comfort. Therefore they are secured in peace and happiness, through him who is their head in heaven. He is for their eternal comfort and se∣curity, invested with full power to do and act for them; as <HI>he hath the keys of hell and death,</HI> none can shut heaven, or open hell but himself: For <HI>he lives for evermore, and hath the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. FROM what has been said, we have reason to exhort you, who intend to join in this holy or∣dinance of our Lord's supper, <HI>To set your affections upon things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right-hand of God.</HI> Tho' you have his death and humiliation represented in this ordinance, yet you ought to consider it as a thing past: He who was <HI>dead is now alive,</HI> and <HI>sitteth at the right hand of the majesty on high, and has the keys of hell and death</HI> in his power; or according to the words of the angel, <HI>He is not here, but is risen: See the place where the Lord
<PB N="203" REF="211"/>lay.</HI> The testimony you have of him in the word, ought to lead up your hearts to him in his exalted state; and while you commemorate his death, you ought not to forget, that he is <HI>entered into his glory.</HI> The symbols of his broken body and shed blood, ought to put you in mind of his wonderful love, in meriting life for you, but not to confine your attention to the literal part of this ordinance. The design of this sacrament is to direct the soul to him in the way of praise and thanksgiving. He left it in the church as a pledge of his love, and we ought to use it as such, to bring to our remembrance, him <HI>who loved us, and gave himself for us.</HI> If you would enjoy communion with him, you must look thro' the signs to the thing signified; consider the mean∣ing and design of this ordinance. In this life our knowledge and enjoyment of God, is in general symbolically conveyed unto us, for we are not yet capacitated to receive it immediately. Reading and hearing are but symbols whereby the know∣ledge of God is conveyed to men: For knowledge itself consists not in either sounds or letters: They only are symbols or short hierogliphics to convey to our minds what they are used to signify. The <HI>ele∣ments of bread and wine,</HI> are much of the same nature, in the sense they ought to be used. They are ano∣ther kind of language taken to express the death of <HI>Christ;</HI> or we may call them big characters, ex∣pressing the love of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Redeemer. They ought therefore to be used as means to raise our love and affections to <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>BEWARE of suffering any object to come be∣tween your heart and that Saviour, which ought to occupy your whole affections. If any object what∣ever have <HI>Christ</HI>'s just room in your heart, you will have no communion with him in that ordinance. If either pride, self, or worldly-mindedness, have the ascendant in your hearts, <HI>Christ</HI> will allow you
<PB N="204" REF="212"/>no fellowship with him; you will then eat and drink <HI>judgment</HI> to your own souls. I am sorry to say that I observe some, who in the general part of their conduct, serve <HI>Mammon</HI> more than God, and self more than <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> presumptuously ap∣proach to this holy ordinance. You ought bre∣thren to remember, tho' we have no warrant to keep you back, you have no right to be there, because <HI>your hearts are not right with God.</HI> You cannot <HI>serve two masters;</HI> God will not accept of a divided heart, for he requires the whole affections to himself. If you approach to this holy ordinance with your hearts full of covetousness and oppression, remember the condition and treatment of the man who had not on <HI>the wedding garment:</HI> The Lord of this ordinance will say unto you, <HI>Friend, how camest thou hither, not having on the wedding garment.</HI> God will most severely punish such audacious sinners. Think not that your outward form of Godliness, will cover you from the eye of him who seeth all things; for no∣thing can be hid from him at any time. He sees things past, present, and to come, by one glance of his Divine intelligence, and is <HI>a discerner of the thoughts of the heart:</HI> Fear then to approach his sacred presence in such a solemn manner, lest he pour out his fury upon you.</P>
<P>BE exhorted to lay aside all malice and wicked∣ness, lest you provoke <HI>Jehovah</HI> to discharge the thunder-bolts of his vengeance upon you. It doth not become men to approach to this ordinance, where love only ought to have the chief place, with malice in their hearts against any person, friend or enemy. Let all unmercifulness be rooted out of your souls, before you come to commemorate that great expression of Divine mercy, the death of <HI>Christ:</HI> It will be a heinous abuse of the mercy of God, for any cruel unmerciful man to make so free with what he is forbidden to approach: The <HI>leaven
<PB N="205" REF="213"/>of wickedness</HI> must be put out of the soul, if you would lawfully eat the Christian Passover.</P>
<P>ENDEAVOUR to get free of all selfish princi∣ples, and be disinterested in your religious conduct. Let not political reasons govern your views in ob∣serving the ordinances of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> observe them because he hath appointed them. Take special care that you observe them, <HI>not to be seen of men,</HI> or to serve the purpose of self and the world. It is much to be lamented, that the professors of the truth make it a secondary thing in practice, which they pretend to place first in words. One who will speak well of religion, and pretend a good deal to its experience, at least would be offended not to be accounted a true christian, will, notwithstanding, neglect some or all of its duties for a very small measure of worldly interest. What is this but to tell the world and their own consciences, they are hypocrites who never had religion at heart. Should I say, that I know there are such among our ordi∣nary communicants, I might perhaps offend some; but some consciences here present know I would say the truth. When men neglect preparation for such solemn exercises, and rashly and presumptu∣ously approach to the table of the Lord, it is a strong evidence they are near to practical atheism: For if they believed the Omniscience of God, and his pure holy character, they would not dare to approach his presence in such a solemn manner, without attempt∣ing the preparation required of christian worship∣pers. When I observe with what ceremony some persons will endeavour to prepare themselves, to address a superior, whose approbation they would wish to have, or whose aid they intend to ask; and how little diligence they use to prepare themselves to address the Almighty, I cannot but believe they do not know his character, or have no desire for his approbation.</P>
<PB N="206" REF="214"/>
<P>CERTAINLY no man who knows the nature and character of God, but will see how presumptu∣ous it is to approach his sacred presence, without endeavouring to have such sentiments as are worthy of his Majesty and Holiness. But, alas! we see too often the worms of his footstool presumptuously make use of the sacred symbols of the body and blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> without the least visible prepara∣tion. What is the language of such conduct, but <HI>that God doth not see, the Almighty doth not consider,</HI> what way men approach unto him? Allow me to address two sorts of persons who perhaps may at∣tempt to communicate on this occasion: First, I∣dolaters, for too many of this character there are, I am afraid, among those who bear the Christian Name. I mean not worshippers of stocks and stones, but such as have idols in their hearts, which supplant their Saviour. You who adore the goddess of fame, and mean no more by being religious, but to support a name among men, suffer me to say, you will be unworthy communicants. This is a piece of self you ought to deny; for if you are un∣der the influence of this principle, it is your God, and will exterminate all serious and judicious thoughts of the Most High. It is an evidence of your spiritual death, <HI>that you are dead while you live.</HI> When you seek after no more of religion than is needful to raise your character in the world among good men: This is like <HI>Laodicea, to have a name to live, while yet you are dead.</HI> You are only in this pespect idolaters, worshippers of fame, instead of the true God. You who adore the world, so far as to set your hearts upon it, and study more to encrease your wealth, than encrease your faith, you are idol∣aters, that are sure to be unworthy communicants. The man who has neither peace in his mind, nor quietness in his family, but when the world is flow∣ing in upon him; who is troubled to excess at the
<PB N="207" REF="215"/>will of Providence, when any thing happens to his worldly disadvantage; who frets for the loss of a few pounds, as if God was departed from him; who vexes himself and all his concerns, at the de∣cline of business, or decay of trade, is undoubtedly a worshipper of <HI>Mammon,</HI> and a gross-heart idola∣ter; and if he approach to this holy ordinance, <HI>will eat and drink judgment to his own soul: For what concord hath the temple of God with idols?</HI> This practice of yours, is what the Apostle calls <HI>idolatry,</HI> and none such <HI>can have communion with God.</HI> You are <HI>lovers of pleasures,</HI> and adore the god of sensuali∣ty; have no true satisfaction, <HI>but in rioting and drunkenness,</HI> and forbidden pleasures; you are idola∣ters, and cannot enjoy communion with God in this ordinance.</P>
<P>YOU who are slaves to pride and passion, allow me to tell you, that you also are idolaters, and are unfit to approach to God in this communion. What holds any man in subjection is his master, and when they willingly obey this master, in opposition to all things beside, this is to them an idol. All men, who to gratify their pride and passion, and will use undue means to obtain gratification, to the dishonour of God, and the hurt of his church, these are persons who are none of <HI>Christ</HI>'s willing subjects, but worshippers of pride, and slaves to their own vicious humours. What a strange sight it is to see that man profess friendship to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and his friends, by sitting at the same communion, when he is a continual dupe to <HI>Satan,</HI> and slave to his pride! Pride is the most unseemly thing for com∣municants, and most provoking to <HI>Christ;</HI> and no man who gives loose reins to his pride is fit to join in this holy ordinance, which we have just now be∣fore us. Any person who is proud of his gifts, whatever they are, and values himself on account of them, is a <HI>worshipper of the creature more than the
<PB N="208" REF="216"/>Creator.</HI> Be exhorted, thou proud, vain, self-con∣ceited person, to become humble: <HI>What hast thou, that thou hast not received?</HI> Thy pride is most un∣reasonable, for thou art proud of what is not thine own: <HI>Who made thee to differ from another?</HI> It was not thyself, but God.</P>
<P>CONSIDER it avails thee nothing that thou art nobly or highly descended, or that all thy pre∣decessors were men of honest repute; this is but thy disgrace, while you act unworthy of your cha∣racter, and such ancestors. The <HI>Jews had Abraham to their father,</HI> and yet <HI>were of their father the devil,</HI> and <HI>did his works.</HI> That you are honest before men, no man need to thank you, for the laws of your country oblige you to be so. What then, O vain hypocrite, do you boast of? Of that which is none of thine own virtues, nor thine own free choice. If it were any virtue in you, you would modestly conceal it, and not be always blabbing it out, and boasting thereof. When a man begins to boast of his endowments, they are no longer virtues in him; all the good he hath done, is lost in the midst of his pride. Beware of this evil principle of pride; it will hinder your communion with God, and make you <HI>eat and drink judgment to your own souls.</HI></P>
<P>ALLOW me also to address such as are thought∣less and inconsiderate. Many without consideration and thought, customarily join in this solemn ordi∣nance, when yet they neither have justly consider∣ed the needful preparation, nor how they ought to live afterwards. These will certainly provoke God to bring some judgment upon them, because they make too free with holy things.</P>
<P>THE want of consideration, is the reason why some declare themselves <HI>one bread</HI> with the friends of <HI>Christ</HI> in the sacrament of the supper, and very soon after fall into all <HI>superfluity of naughtiness.</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="217"/>Have not some of ourselves, in this society, joined in this holy communion, and soon after, <HI>like the sow that was washen, returned to the wallowing in the mire; or like the dog to his vomit?</HI> Thoughtlesness and want of consideration, was no doubt the cause of this. Could any man, who considered the na∣ture of this ordinance, and the obligations men come under by joining in it, so soon fall into such wild extravagance? Could they <HI>first drink the cup of the Lord,</HI> and after, <HI>that of the devil,</HI> if they had the least degree of consideration? I call all excess of drunkenness the <HI>cup of Satan,</HI> for it is thereby that his children, in a great measure, keep up com∣munion with him and one another. Could any man who had thought, sit down at the table of the Lord, and profess a regard to him as the author of Divine Revelation; and yet after this, blasphemous∣ly make use of his word to vindicate their crimes? Yea, in the most blasphemous and outragious man∣ner, threaten in the Almighty's own words all who would not yield to their pride and wickedness. This was no less than sitting down in the throne of the Most High, and being guilty of self deification. The exhortation to such is, <HI>consider your ways and repent,</HI> lest God be provoked to bring such a judg∣ment upon you, as shall <HI>make the ears of him who heareth of it to tingle.</HI> Consider the case of old <HI>Eli,</HI> who tho' he went not so far as to vindicate the vices of his sons, nor joined in their profanity; yet thro' an ill-judged sympathy, and want of just considera∣tion, winked at their crimes, and brought destruc∣tion upon his family. God is the same <HI>jealous God</HI> still, and will destroy root and branch of that man and his family, and all his concerns who thus thoughtlessly profane hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name and ordinances.</P>
<P>REMEMBER you have received warning from the word of God, that <HI>there is no fellowship between
<PB N="210" REF="218"/>light and darkness; between Christ and Belial; between the temple of God and idols.</HI> If you vainly hope God will forgive your profaneness, in this particular allow me to tell you, you are egregiously mistaken; you must <HI>first repent,</HI> otherwise you will <HI>perish.</HI> Consider the power of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> which is en∣gaged against the sinner who lives in sin, as well as it is engaged in favours of those, who love the Lord and repent: For he hath <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>

<P>He that being often reproved, harden<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <HI>his</HI> neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>EPROOF is an ordinance of God, and one of the ends of Divine Revela∣tion, 2 Tim. iii. 16. <HI>All scripture</HI> is <HI>given by inspiration of God, and</HI> is <HI>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,</HI> and <HI>for instruction in righteousness.</HI> It is designed as a rod for the conscience, to reclaim the soul from errors and mistakes. It supposes guilt or error actually existing, and that its objects are turned aside from the paths of virtue. Where there is no guilt, re∣proof hath no object; but wherever there is guilt, reproof takes place. Reproof is a kind of spiritual discipline, designed to reclaim men from their er∣rors and mistakes; but where it does not reclaim, it ordinarily hardens the stubborn soul. <HI>Solomon,</HI> from experience, found that reproof did not always answer the intended end, and so there was need for repeating it; but after it was often repeated with∣out success, it had a tendency to harden the heart, that no impression could be made upon it by suc∣cessive reproofs.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing more provoking to God than incorrigibleness: Not to listen to his reproofs, is to defend sin against God, and commence advo∣cate for the devil. There is no character among men more hateful than a wilful, obstinate sinner, that sins over the belly of all reproof and admoni∣tion. The condition of such a person is very hope∣less: For the conscience like an anvil grows harder by reproof, and the consequence is at last absolute
<PB N="212" REF="220"/>despair. When reproof and admonition do not gain and persuade men, they at last prove their greatest torment. The sinner that stands long out against reproof, <HI>falls suddenly at last.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY reproof that is not well received, and taken notice of, and followed with amendment, is the poison in the conscience, that breaks out in ruptures of despair in the end.</P>
<P>THOUGH it be not immediately felt, it does not cease to operate, but works silently the ruin of the soul: Tho' it does not break out in open ex∣clamations against God, or such as reprove them; yet it works in the way of secret grudge, and pri∣vate reflections. This obstinacy is like a disease that is long in gathering, that when it comes to a height, it suddenly terminates in death. It may long work slowly, but advances towards its perfec∣tion by sure steps.</P>
<P>THE man that does not amend his errors, when reproved and admonished, tho' he may not run fast, yet he walks on surely to hell. The most hopeless condition of a man is, when he has been often shewn his duty, and reproved for his sin, but ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gone on in his own way notwithstanding; our text says, <HI>he shall be destroyed, and that without reme∣dy.</HI> Tho' such persons are not without the reach of God's grace; yet we have no instances in scrip∣ture that any of them were converted.</P>
<P>IN discoursing further upon this subject, I shall first enquire, what is here meant by reproof.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, CONSIDER this obstinacy against it, which is so fatal.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, OPEN up the nature of this threatening denounced against this obstinacy.</P>
<P>THEN improve the subject.</P>
<P>THE first thing in our method is, to enquire what is meant by <HI>reproof.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT contains in it these arguments that point
<PB N="213" REF="221"/>forth truth in the clearest light. He who reproves error, ought first to shew the difference between it and truth. This is promised of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> Isa. xi. 4. <HI>But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the carth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he stay the wicked.</HI> There is not a more severe reproof can be given to a wicked man than to point forth the truth be∣fore his eyes: This brings as it were a glass be∣fore his eyes, wherein he may see his own moral complexion. The truth is a painful thing to one who is conscious of his own guilt. Suppose a re∣proof is not intended to any individual; yet the simple telling of the truth will give the guilty un∣easiness, and be a secret reproof to their conscience, and beget pain. This was the way how <HI>Christ</HI> re∣proved the world of sin: He taught the truth in opposition to the prevailing vices and errors of the times.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> hated <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> because he told them <HI>the truth,</HI> and the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> became an enemy to the <HI>Galatians</HI> for the same reason; <HI>Am I become your enemy,</HI> says he, <HI>because I tell you the truth?</HI> Gal. iv. 16.—John iii. 20, 21. <HI>For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a sufficient reproof to some persons to shew the difference between truth and error; for this is setting before the conscience a contrast, where it cannot miss to see its own deformity. All doctrinal reproof, consists in shewing the difference between truth and falshood wherever they are; so that those who are possest of either, cannot miss to see either reason to approve or condemn themselves. Such reproof as this will serve all its purposes, to a man
<PB N="214" REF="222"/>of understanding, as Prov. xix. 25. <HI>Reprove one that hath understanding,</HI> and <HI>he will understand knowledge.</HI> But when the mind is ignorant or contracted, or wrapt up in the pleasure of vice of any kind, this kind of reproof will only have the effect of displea∣sing and hardening the sinner.</P>
<P>THE strongest arguments the gospel can afford will, to some little minds and worldly souls, be like the sun which only hardens the earth: Their earth∣ly minds are more and more hardened by the truth, and make a stronger resistance against it; as 2 Kings xvii. 14. <HI>Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the necks of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord their God.</HI> Jer. xix. 15. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city, and upon all her towns, all the evil that I have pronounced against it: Because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.</HI> Every doctrinal truth which is revealed in the gospel, has no other effect upon them, than such had upon some nominal disciples, who followed <HI>Christ</HI> in the days of his flesh, John vi. 60, 66. Who <HI>said, This is an hard saying, who can hear it? And from that</HI> time <HI>many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</HI> It is evi∣dent that the arguments of the gospel are designed for a reproof to sinners, for they generally take them as such, and are offended at them, and harden their necks against them.</P>
<P>AND if we join common experience with Scrip∣ture we will see this truth clearly evidenced. Ex∣perience teacheth us, that some who have had other views of following <HI>Christ,</HI> than for truth's sake, as soon as any gospel truth is closely pressed, and ur∣ged upon them in its true nature and light, it causeth them to go back, and forsake a cause they have professed much zeal for, and been very well pleased with, even when they had no pretence of
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>conscience to alter their conduct. To say that some duties ought to be done, and that it is damnable to neglect them, in the presence of some people, is much the same as to say, <HI>thou art the man;</HI> at least it has the same effect: Nothing is the reason of this offence, but that the gospel arguments are re∣proofs to their guilty conscience.</P>
<P>DOCTRINAL reproofs are certainly needful, seeing iniquity creeps in among people insensibly, and cannot be found out otherwise. This is the first way of finding out some of the enemies of re∣ligion, by setting forth the truth as evidently against their vices as possible: For as long as truth is ex∣pressed in general terms, those who are only hang∣ers on, as it were, in the the church, will pass un∣discovered. But when once the present needful truth is clearly opened up, and present duty urged, it discovers the dross, <HI>and separates the chaff from the wheat.</HI></P>
<P>THE reason why that truth is a reproof to wicked men is, because it points against their errors on all occasions. Hence there never can be a prevailing error or vice, but there is some truth to detect it; so that one need scarcely do any thing else to re∣prove vice, but to publish its opposite truth: This will be a severe enough reproof to all who are guilty.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER branch of reproof is, the pointing forth of sin in its most lively colours. The most severe reproof that can be given to a guilty person is, to draw his moral picture, and let him see it as it is. Every description of the nature and conse∣quences of sin, is a severe reproof to the guilty. It would be a very cutting reproof certainly to a drunkard and a swearer, to draw his own picture when he was in his revels, and let him see it in his calm moments, and copy that incoherent lan∣guage of hell he expresses in his cups, and read it
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>to him when he was sober: It would either make him fall out with himself, or give him great of∣fence at the author.</P>
<P>To point out the evil of the sin of omission, and the baseness of that character who neglects his duty, will be a reproof to such as mind not their obligations to their Maker and Redeemer.</P>
<P>FOR example, if one without any particular ap∣plication, should describe the neglect of family-wor∣ship to be ingratitude to God, and a practical de∣nying of his Providence, a sin that brings down his wrath upon families, and deprives a man of a just title to the name of a christian; that it is murdering a rising generation, and robbing God of his due, by neglecting to acknowledge every return of his goodness in that social capacity it is received: That such had no right to the seals of God's Co∣venant, Baptism and the Lord's Supper; there are many who would think they were severely enough reproved, tho' no application was made. Or, if one should describe covetousness to be a too anxious concern for, and a too constant pursuit after things that are not our own, or a seeking to advance our own worldly interest at the expence of other people's happiness, or the good of the Common Weal: Such as adding <HI>house to house, and field to field,</HI> Isa. v. 8. Or a coveting another man's business or em∣ployment, because he prospers in it: That it also consisted in monopolies and forestalling of any kind of provisions that the poor make use of; or in <HI>ta∣king pledges from the poor,</HI> and keeping them when he cannot want them, without great prejudice to himself or family. Deut. xxiv. 12. <HI>If the man</HI> be <HI>poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge.</HI> If it should be urged, that such as endeavoured to en∣crease his worldly circumstances by engrossing and monopolizing, by joining more businesses than were convenient for the good of the poor, would
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>encrease the Divine anger against him: And he who <HI>keeps the poor man's pledge in his house,</HI> keeps the curse of the Almighty along with it; there are sundry would think this a hard enough reproof. And if to this it should be added, that he is a covetous per∣son, who withholds from his brother that aid that is necessary for his support, when it is in his power; or refuses the calls and demands that God and Re∣ligion have upon him to support their interest, and applies to his worldly purposes what God has given him to support christianity: Add to all, should it be affirmed, that such a man can no more <HI>enter into the kingdom of God, than a Camel can go through the eye of a needle,</HI> the reproof would be understood, and reckoned very uncharitable.</P>
<P>EVERY description of sin is a reproof to the guilty soul, and tho' often sinners find means to stave off the conviction, yet they cannot get clear of the wound. The picture of sin that is drawn in the word, and the wrath of God that attends it, will by times like a spectre recoil upon them, and give them pain.</P>
<P N="3">3. REPROOF consists in a special enumeration of the most prevalent sins, and condemning sinners for committing them. This is called, <HI>a setting sin before us.</HI> Psal. l. 21. <HI>These</HI> things <HI>thou hast done, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altoge∣ther</HI> such a one <HI>as thyself:</HI> but <HI>I will reprove thee, and set</HI> them <HI>in order before thine eyes.</HI></P>
<P>THE first two mentioned methods of reproof will prevail with such as are something tractable, that are not overcome with long habits and rooted prejudices: But a more plain, open and pointed way is needful, to reach the bottom of benumbed consciences, in order to reach a home conviction. Often it happens that sinners will join in the gene∣ral condemnation of sin in others, like <HI>David,</HI> but never mind their own, till the reproof be spoken
<PB N="218" REF="226"/>more particularly, <HI>Thou art the man.</HI> The most part of men are like thieves, who will join in the general cry against a delinquent; but when they themselves are detected will think more seriously upon the subject.</P>
<P>WHEN custom and long practice has made sin familiar to men, they become to them a part of their constitution: They are like <HI>right eyes and right hands,</HI> that must be <HI>plucked out, and cut off.</HI> General reproofs are like cutting at the branches while the root remains: There is need of a more particular dealing. It is needful to reach the reproof to the most prevalent evil, and denounce the wrath of God against those sins that are most beloved.</P>
<P>WHATEVER are prevailing sins of a nation or people, are to be enumerated and set before them, and they are to be warned of their danger on ac∣count of them. Such a method as this did the prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> observe in his reproving <HI>Israel,</HI> Hosea iv. 1, 2, 3. <HI>The Lord hath a controversy with his people: For by swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, and blood touch∣eth blood: Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that is therein.</HI></P>
<P>A FAITHFUL reprover will not fear to in∣cur the displeasure of any man, when he has a call to reprove: The very nature of just and true re∣proof, obliges him to deal plainly, that if by any means he may save men from the evil of their ways. Or, if they will not listen to his just reproof, he may clear his own conscience in dealing faithfully with theirs.</P>
<P>BUT as there is an external reproof which the ministry of the word directs against all sin and vice, in all its circumstances, in all sorts and degrees of men; there is also an inward reproof, which men have from their own consciences, for their crimes
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>and guilt. This reproof I call the reproof of conscience.</P>
<P>IT consists of a self-condemnation: It is one's heart rising against himself, for the commission of sin, which gives pain to the conscience. The A∣postle, <HI>John</HI> iii. 20. gives this as an evidence of the falshood of a man's conduct: <HI>If our heart con∣demn us, God is greater than our heart, and will much more condemn us.</HI> There are many struggles between men's consciences and their love of in∣terest, pleasures, and appetites, which none but themselves know. Tho' some by long abusing their conscience, overcome its reproofs, so as not to feel them so quick, yet it is out of their power to hinder its touches now and then.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE, that inseperable part of a man's self, gives reproofs some way or other for every known sin, which is best understood to one's self. There is a certain confusion of soul which the guilty sometimes labour under, which is nothing but conscience struggling amidst the multitude of other passions and appetites. Some hinder or stifle the reproofs of conscience by false reasonings, or by hindering it of information; but as soon as ever it is informed of sin in the soul, it expresses its antipathy by the pain it produceth in it. Sometimes it reproves, not by begetting a sharp, quick sensation of feeling in the soul, but a restlessness, whereby a sinner feels something troubles him, and he cannot tell what it is. This makes him peevish and discontent. Sometimes men will attribute the cause of their uneasiness to some other causes, when nothing but conscience is the cause.</P>
<P>THIS is often the case with such as complain of outward causes. When a friend or neighbour has spoken freely to them, and ruffled their temper, they often lay all the blame upon such an accident; but if conscience was right, this would give them
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>no trouble. The uneasiness arises from a struggle between pride and conscience; the one stirring up their passion against their neighbour, the other re∣proaching them for that resolution.</P>
<P>REPROOFS of conscience are to the soul what unknown physic is to the body; it begets a kind of sickness which men cannot soon account for: They find an uneasiness, but cannot tell the cause, and therefore have sundry false conjectures about their pain and uneasiness. An instance of this we have in the case of <HI>Ahab,</HI> 1 Kings xxi. 4. <HI>And Ahab came into his house, heavy and sore displeased, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken unto him: For he had said, I will not give thee the inhe∣ritance of my fathers: and he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</HI> It is a plain case, it was more the reproof of his conscience than <HI>Naboth</HI>'s refusal that gave him un∣easiness: He could have taken it by violence as <HI>Jezebel</HI> did, had not his conscience reproved him. His sickness was only a struggle between his con∣science, his pride and avarice, which many since his time have had.</P>
<P>WHEN men's desires and appetites are strong for any sensual enjoyment, but a sense of injustice or wrong prevents them from making free with it, it often happens that a moral disorder or sickness gets in the mind; for nothing is readier to distress the mind than desire, the presence of an object, and a forbidding conscience. This puts the soul into a kind of confusion, that it cannot well account for its disease.</P>
<P>THE second thing in the method was to explain the nature of that obstinacy, which resisteth and is strengthened by reproof.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS obstinacy consists in ignorance of the truth. Men could not if they admitted the evi∣dence of truth be obstinate against reproof. We
<PB N="221" REF="229"/>might as well say, that a man who certainly knew that his house should be burnt upon such a night, would sleep in it that night, as say that one who understood the truths of God's word would resist them obstinately.</P>
<P>DIVINE truth informs us, that the one is as dangerous as the other, and more so, as the one but endangers the body, the other the soul and body both. Ignorance is at the root of obstinacy: None are more pragmatical in their way than men of little understanding. It is but seldom that you will find a man of understanding and judgment very headstrong.</P>
<P>SOME are ignorant wilfully, because they do not attend to the proper means of instruction, and so rebelliously resist reproof offered from the truth: Such were these mentioned, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 5. who were <HI>wilfully ignorant of the second coming of Christ,</HI> tho' they had abundant evidence.</P>
<P>THERE are none so ignorant but they know something, and pursue some one thing they know; but as to these truths that are Divine, but few are at pains to know them. It happens therefore that thro' ignorance of the Gospel they resist its truths, by substituting their false knowledge in the room of it: For men will always be ready to prefer what they know, to what they are ignorant of, if it any way suit their humour and disposition.</P>
<P>THESE reproofs that ignorant men receive from the word of God, meet with the greatest op∣position, because they are ignorant of the God that gives them: They read not his word, and think any thing strange they hear from it, that seems con∣trary to their observation in temporal things. To tell a man that is accustomed to ease and pleasure, <HI>that he must deny himself,</HI> is like taking a dog by the ears: The reason is, he is acquainted with his pleasures, but not with his Bible. To acquaint a
<PB N="222" REF="230"/>worldly-minded man of the necessity of <HI>overcoming the world,</HI> is to <HI>take away his god,</HI> and he knows not where to find another. But were men acquainted with the truths of the gospel, they would find that all its reproofs were salutary, designed for health to the soul. Ignorance of the designed of gospel or∣dinances makes men obstinately perverse against reproof. When men are not acquainted with the true spiritual design of the ministry of the word, and all the institutions of the gospel, they will ob∣stinately oppose all the reproofs they meet with, for neglecting them. When <HI>Paul</HI> came into <HI>Thes∣salonia,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> there, ignorant of the true de∣sign of the gospel, violently persecuted him and his adherents, and cry'd, <HI>These who turn the world up∣side down are come here also.</HI> Had they not been ignorant of the design of the gospel, they would not have been so obstinate.</P>
<P>MANY because they are ignorant of that op∣position that the gospel establishes between christi∣anity and the world, obstinately oppose its reproofs. They imagine that these customs by which they live and have had their wealth, or as some say their bread, must not be infringed.—If you urge upon them the practice of any duty, which alters their customs, they most perversely oppose it; and if reproved by any for preferring custom to religious duties, they will plainly tell you they do not see the need of it; or if they partly see it, they cannot see why it should be opposed to their custom, to make them differ with the world.</P>
<P>MEN who know truly the value of religion, know also that the very design of the gospel is to set them at variance with the world. This is a part of that division <HI>Christ</HI> came to send upon the earth, and that fire he came to kindle, which will continue to burn till all the earth be burnt up. For this reason they submit to reproof, because they
<PB N="223" REF="231"/>know the need of it, and the worth of religion. Because they know the design of the gospel, they cheerfully obey its admonitions, and listen to its reproofs. But such as are ignorant of that division that must be between the world and the lovers of the gospel, will be offended when they are told that they must <HI>fall out with father and mother, sister and brother, and have enemies in their own house if they follow Christ,</HI> Matth. x. 34.</P>
<P>WHY men are so offended at such truths as are reproofs to them is, because they are ignorant of their importance. In the primitive times of chris∣tianity, the knowledge of the truths of the gospel made men part with what in after times the igno∣rance of these truths has made mankind fond of, and have caused them to be much offended when they have been reproved for acting inconsistent with the primitive rules.</P>
<P>MEN are now ignorant of these works of cha∣rity that the gospel requires of its followers, and for this reason are offended when they are put in mind of these duties. There is nothing more plain from Scripture than that it was the practice of the first christians to sell their possessions of houses and lands to relieve their distressed brethren, and help those in want, as in <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 34. But now one may as well make men believe the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as believe the Scripture in that particular: The very men∣tioning the truth is brought to set the world in arms.</P>
<P>IN the world the state of towns and cities were then much the same as they are now; every one had a right to his own inheritance till he sold it. But when once they embraced the Gospel, it open∣ed their hearts to help their brethren, and made them sell both houses and lands to relieve the needy. They were obliged to part with what they had, so as not to make themselves destitute, but with what they could spare, and were willing to part with
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>some of their inheritance for the sake of the gospel. However hard it may seem to our selfish views, and love of the world, to sell what we have to assist <HI>the houshold of faith;</HI> yet they have a demand upon us according to the Gospel, for we can have no lawful title to what belongs to them. Suppose the Author of nature never deigned all men to be alike; yet he has ordained by his written law, that such as are in want have a demand upon those who have possessions: And in the christian society, no man hath a just right to his own possessions while any of the godly within his reach are in want.</P>
<P>I OWN indeed, that according to the laws of na∣tions, and human institutions, the poor have no claim, but what depends upon the pleasure of the great, or these laws they see meet to frame:—Therefore christians must submit to the laws of the country where they reside, and rather suffer much want than turn rebellious:—But tho' they as sub∣jects, like their great patron, must necessarily suffer thro' the iniquity of human laws, they are like to suffer patiently; but tho' this is the case according to the order of difference between them and the world, yet it cannot be so among themselves. The laws of <HI>Christ</HI> are different; tho' they cannot go to those who are not of them, to make demands for the supply of their wants, yet they can go to a bro∣ther and ask what they need if he hath it.</P>
<P>THE Apostle <HI>James</HI> shews us the christian law in this particular, Chap. ii. 14. <HI>What</HI> doth it <HI>profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and be destitute of daily food; and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled: notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what</HI> doth it <HI>profit?</HI></P>
<P>THROUGH ignorance of this christian law, men are offended at these truths that reprove their pride
<PB N="225" REF="233"/>and covetousness. Is it any thing like christianity for any man to live luxuriously upon the fat of the earth, and be <HI>cloathed in gay cloathing,</HI> and have his children shining in apparel, beyond even an ordi∣nary station, and yet refuse needful charity to poor saints? Would it not be more like the laws of <HI>Jesus</HI> to strip a prodigal foppish child of his superfluities, and his unnecessary ornaments, and give them to a naked saint? Would it not be better to give that money which he will spend at the tavern, or at the gaming-table, to supply some hungry christian fa∣mily?</P>
<P>NOTHING but the ignorance of the gospel can make men so obstinately oppose such truths, and be offended at reproof.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER cause of this obstinacy is unbelief. Men could not withstand the force of Gospel re∣proof, unless they had unbelieving hearts. It is because men do not believe the truth of God's word that makes them so very obstinate. This is clearly evidenced in the case of <HI>Israel</HI> in the wilder∣ness: Their unbelief hindered them from taking no∣tice of God's reproof and admonitions. God often reproved and corrected them, but they still were ob∣stinate, and provoked him with their rebellion.</P>
<P>HAD they been persuaded that what <HI>Moses</HI> told them from the mouth of the Lord was true, they could not have so often rebelled against him: But the <HI>Psalmist</HI> gives the cause, Psal. lxxviii. 22. <HI>They believed not in God, nor trusted in his salvation.</HI> They had a secret distrust in their minds of the word of God, and so thought things would not turn out as they did. If men believed that the Almighty spoke truth, they would not dare to resist his reproofs, but turn to duty and from sin at every one of them. They do not believe the necessity of duty, and so are offended when it is urged; they do not firmly believe that sin will have such ill consequences, and
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>so do not fear to commit it, and are offended when they are reproved for it: They do not fully believe that wisdom or religion is the principal thing, and so are offended when it is opposed to their other interests. The reason of this obstinacy is nothing more than that they never believe that religion has the first demands upon them, and that if any com∣petition come between the world and it, religion must be preferred. They believe the very contrary, as their practice and lives amply declare: If reli∣gion was first in their hearts, it would be first in their practice also: But it is last in their practice, and so last in their hearts. It is a just saying of <HI>So∣lomon, As a man thinketh, so is he,</HI> i. e. if he have true notions of religion, and be persuaded of its truths, his life and practice declare it: But if he think otherwise, that other things beside religion are as important, or that he may mingle their in∣terests, then he will act accordingly in life.</P>
<P>UNBELIEF in heart is the cause of all obstinacy against the reproofs of the gospel, nor is there any reason to suppose the least consistency between ob∣stinacy and true faith. A man that will harden his neck against reproof, when it is evident he is a just object of it, is just as evidently an unbeliever. The cause and the effect are alike. Unbelief in its own nature, is rebellion against God; and obstinacy a∣gainst gospel reproofs is the genuine fruit of un∣belief.</P>
<P>THE soul would be quite tractable if there was no unbelief, and would listen to every law of its Maker with the greatest delight; but when once distrust, or self-dependence supplies the place of faith and dependence upon the word of God, thence arise rebellion and obstinacy. Since the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> there has been an untractableness in the na∣ture of man, and a bias to self-seeking and depen∣dence; and until faith in the saving truth of the
<PB N="227" REF="235"/>Divine record, takes place in the room of that un∣belief, men will always be offended at the reproofs of the gospel. Unbelief is opposite unto the very nature and end of the gospel, and so endeavours to make that end void, by resisting reproof. And un∣believer is not known so well any other way as by what effect reproof has upon him. He may con∣ceal his unbelief from the world, so long as he meets with no resistance, but when once his pride is piqued by reproof, he appears in his own colours an unbeliever. These unbelievers who came out of <HI>Egypt</HI> with <HI>Moses,</HI> seemed tractable till once they met with reproof and contradiction. In the xv. Chap. of <HI>Numbers</HI> we find a man <HI>gathering sticks upon the Sabbath,</HI> who by the commandment of God <HI>was stoned with stones to death.</HI> Because <HI>Moses</HI> o∣beyed the word of the Lord in curbing and repro∣ving sin, in the beginning of Chap. xvi. we find a great posse gathered against him.</P>
<P>THEY bluntly tell <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron, that they took too much upon them, seeing all the Lord's people were holy,</HI> Chap. xvi. 3. Which was as much as if they had said, we do not believe your authority, and that the miracles thou hast wrought are from God: (For <HI>Moses</HI> did nothing but by the Divine orders.) You have stoned a man for gathering a few sticks, which is, we think, an effect of your pride and tyranny, and not a command from the God of our fathers. In this you shew great disre∣spect to the princes of the congregation.</P>
<P>WHILE these unbelievers met with no reproofs to their pride and vanity, they passed for the Lord's people, and thought themselves such as in Chap. xvi. 3. But God made a very special discovery of them, first by reproving their pride, and then by sending them down alive to the sides of the pit. Reproof finds out stiff-necked unbelievers, and unbelievers discover themselves by their obstinacy
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>against reproof. The false-hearted rotten mem∣bers of the church, are found out by reproof. There is no other way of finding out these unbe∣lieving hypocrites, whose he arts are overgrown with pride and worldly-mindedness, but by this pointed weapon of the Holy Spirit. It pierces them to the heart, and tho' it does not ordinarily prove the means of their salvation, yet it makes them disco∣ver themselves by the resistance they make.</P>
<P>IT may not indeed make them fall out in con∣ceit with their own way, no more than it did <HI>Korah</HI> and his company; but they may stand out obsti∣nately as they did, till the last, and never read their error till they do it in eternal torments.—Some∣times the countenance of multitudes, and the re∣spect that is paid them by some in good repute, may strengthen them in opposition; because they have been sometimes famous in a congregation; and like <HI>Korah</HI> and <HI>Dathan,</HI> leaders in it, they reckon themselves men of importance, and cannot endure reproof, and therefore resist it to the last.</P>
<P>NEITHER will unbelievers readily fear reproof or threatening; they discover themselves unbelievers by their obstinacy, not by their fear. Tho' they were told that <HI>the earth would swallow them up</HI> in the 30th verse, yet we find no evidences of fear or suspicion among them. So strong was their unbe∣lief, that they never suspected that any such conse∣quence would happen. And perhaps I am open∣ing the cause of this obstinacy to some just now, who will resist all reproofs given them from the word, and never suspect themselves of an error, <HI>till hell be moved for them at their coming.</HI></P>
<P>I WISH Divine Grace may prevent any such dreadful consequences; but am afraid that many of the professors of religion among us are got be∣yond the power of ordinary reproof thro' unbelief. There is so much security among men, that it
<PB N="229" REF="237"/>speaks out the greatest degree of heart-unbelief. They are no more concerned about what the gospel says to them, in the way of reproof, than <HI>Korah</HI> was when standing in his tent door.</P>
<P N="3">3. AN OTHER cause of obstinacy is false hope. However far men be in an error, they are ready to hope well of themselves: Like those mentioned by the prophet, who said, <HI>All should be well, though they walked after the imaginations of their own heart.</HI> Such as are members of the church, often found their hope upon their privileges; because they are admitted into the communion of the church, and allowed to partake of her ordinances, they hope well of themselves: <HI>We are Abraham's children,</HI> said a presumptuous people.</P>
<P>THOUGH they resist the admonitions and re∣proofs of the gospel, yet they hope well of them∣selves, because they only did it under such and such circumstances. If they be reproved for neglecting their duty, they alledge they could not help it, be∣cause they were urged with pressing calls to the contrary, and so hope they may be christians because they did not neglect it, when they had nothing else to do: Not minding the words of <HI>Christ, Let the dead bury their dead, but follow thou me.</HI></P>
<P>THIS false hope, or I might rather call it pre∣sumption, makes men hope for salvation, even altho' they disunite every thing God hath joined together. We have no warrant from scripture to hope for salva∣tion when we wilfully neglect any known duty; yet many who almost neglect every ordinance and duty, published in the gospel, will put in their pretences for hopes of salvation. Even our honest fashionable mockers of God, who are masters in a great mea∣sure of their own time, and have the power of their families, will put in their claim for hope of salva∣tion, tho' they never <HI>bow their knee to him,</HI> but when they are able to do nothing else: When they can∣not
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>not longer, for weariness, serve <HI>Mammon,</HI> they pre∣sent a dead statue to the Almighty. But alas! the <HI>morning sacrifice</HI> is wanting, which is an eminent part of the christian's Duty. <HI>David</HI> did not neg∣lect morning worship to God, but most diligently performed it: Psal. cxli. 2. <HI>Let my prayer come up before thee as incense;</HI> and <HI>the lifting up of my hands, as the evening sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>THE third thing in the method was, <HI>to point out the danger of hardening our necks against reproof.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. FROM instances recorded in scripture. (1.) The <HI>old world</HI> before the flood, hardened their necks against these admonitions and reproofs they received from <HI>Noah, a preacher of righteousness.</HI> Tho' he reproved them both by his doctrine and holy life, yet they took no notice of his pure and well-intended admonitions. They went on in fol∣ly, and ran fast in the paths of wickedness; no warning or reproof had any effect upon them. But behold on a sudden <HI>the windows of heaven were opened; Noah</HI> entered into the ark, the subterranean waters gushed up from the bowels of the earth, the sea overwhelmed the adjacent lands. Now the stiff-necked world, who laughed at the reproof of righteous <HI>Noah,</HI> are forced to run from height to height, till they reach the highest summit of the nearest mountains, while their enemy, the waters, are close pursuing them on all hands. Ah! the sons of riot and drunkenness, who would not listen to reproof given them in season, how pale do they stand upon the pike of every high hill? Methinks I see some rich glutton, just new awaked from the drowsy slumbers a nocturnal debauch had thrown him into, just opening his gory eyes, and beholding the waters fast approaching his stately palace, the labour of many years, and the expence of vast sums of gold and silver. How does he start, rave, and curse his fate: Ah! my house, my gold, my silver,
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>my delicate wife, my tender children, must they all perish in the water: But, ah myself! whither shall I flee. All things are now no more to me!—Away he runs, ascends the nearest height, and stands trembling, waiting for his approaching foe! Beholds the waters ascend his height, and at last swallow him up in their billows!</P>
<P>OH! I think I hear him communing with him∣self thus: <Q>What fool was I to reject the warnings “and reproofs that holy <HI>Noah</HI> gave me? He told me of this awful flood; but I was so much en∣gaged in worldly pursuits and pleasures, so much drown'd in sensuality, that I did not be∣lieve him, and now I must be drown'd in this deluge of water. But ah! my heart trembles at the thought! My guilty conscience! ah, my conscience tells me I must fall into <HI>the hands of the living God.</HI> Oh! could this flood but drown my guilt, or swallow me up in the womb of non∣existence: This my conscience tells me is de∣nied ”me!</Q> But ah, despair seizes him, and he sinks in the deep!</P>
<P>IN yonder new-built palace stands a gay youth upon the threshold of his own door, looking this and the other way, where to run for safety, and a little respite. Perhaps he was one of those who laughed at <HI>Noah</HI>'s preaching, and hardened his neck against his loving reproofs and admonitions. Most likely in the pride of his heart he boasted <HI>that he had goods laid up for many years,</HI> and valued him∣self upon his dress, his wealth, and outward accom∣plishments. Behold he runs! forgetful of his glo∣rious palace and gorgeous raiment, to shun the de∣vouring waters. Had he listened to reproof and admonition, he had been in the ark with <HI>Noah;</HI> but he hardened his neck against reproof, and now he is <HI>suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>ON a rising declivity stands a stupendious e∣difice,
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>encircled with a grove of stately cedars: In <HI>Shinar</HI> was its situation: Stately rows of oaks, as a second guard, grew without the verge of the tall cedars. This castle belonged to a mighty lord, who for many years had exhausted vast sums upon it. He was an oppressor of mankind, and an enemy to all true religion. He looks from the parapat of his stately doom, and sees the waters o∣verflow the tops of the tallest oaks, and making fast approaches to the top of his castle. The work of many years, nor the expence of vast sums, can∣not save him. His wife and children, house and servants perish in the flood. He was too high to listen to reproof, but cannot get above the flood. <HI>He is suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>IN the door of a little cottage stands a man of low stature, but of less virtue, and a less heart: He was one of those whom you may call a worm of the earth. His house was the purchase of his own industry, the fruit of much care and labour. He robbed his Maker of his just due, and himself of peace to purchase it. He was always anxious a∣bout to-morrow, and deprived himself of rest and sleep by indulging fears that had no real founda∣tion. He always made religion subservient to <HI>Mammon,</HI> and his joys were founded, not upon re∣ligion, but ready money. He was just about set∣ting off his eldest son in the way of business when the flood came on. But, behold the clouds began to gather, the heavens put on a sable blackness: <HI>The windows of heaven were opened,</HI> the skies poured out spouts of water: The earth opened, and spewed forth subterraneous liquid. He would run, but where can he go: Willingly would he enter the ark, <HI>but Noah had shut himself in.</HI></P>
<P>UNWILLING to part with the fruit of his la∣bour and industry, and waiting for the heavens clearing up, and the clouds dispelling, he keeps
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>close by his cottage till the waters surrounded it, and is suddenly destroyed. He was warned and admonished to change his thoughts and enter into the ark, <HI>but now safety is hid from his eyes.</HI> Ah! how he wrings his hands, and wrys his counte∣nance, so that every muscle of his face is distorted: Scarce has he the appearance of human visage. Oh <HI>Noah,</HI> bring here thy ship and save me! ex∣claims he; I will listen to thy advices and reproofs now: <HI>But he is suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>BEYOND a counter stands <HI>Traffic,</HI> in a shop of his own purchasing, filled with all the rich embroideries of <HI>Eastern</HI> magnificence; on every hand of him fine linen with tapestry. There he stands from morning to night gathering in the ready cash. He was reproved and admonished for spending his time in seeking after gain; but was afraid, and would not listen to reproof. In the very mean time when a crowd of customers had just come into his shop, and his heart was full of the expec∣tation of a profitable bargain: Behold, the sun withdraws his shining, the heavens put on dark∣ness: Peals of thunder roar and rent the heaven, and water in columns pour forth upon the earth.</P>
<P>BEING situate in a level champaign country, the suddenness of the flood detains him and his cus∣tomers, waiting for the clearing of the sky. But ah! a flood breaks in upon his shop, and he and his customers <HI>are destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI> Time was when <HI>Noah</HI> preached righteousness and repentance to the world, but <HI>Traffic</HI> was too full of business to go to hear him. He was reproved for neglecting ordinances, but hardened his neck a∣gainst every reproof and admonition. He was more delighted with an assembly of customers in his shop, than with the assemblies of God's worship: But alas! he finds it is a vain thing to trust to
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>riches, or worldly good things: <HI>He is suddenly de∣stroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>UP yonder rocky cliff ascends a youth, who climbs from one steep to another to avoid the water pursuing him. He was a son much indulged by a tender parent, whose goodness he abused to serve the ends of prodigality. Many reproofs had he got, but never grew better: His heart was vain and his head empty, he never thought till destruc∣tion came. He ascends near the summit of the rock, but losing his step he tumbles headlong into the deep. His vanity cannot save him: He was too light for this earth, but is heavy enough to sink in the deep. How does he exclaim, while he hangs by a clift of the rock: Ah! wretch that I am, who would not listen to advice, but went head∣long in the ways of folly, and must now fall head∣long into the watery abyss. Thus he is <HI>suddenly de∣stroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>AS it was in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> so shall it be in the day of the Son of man, the gospel dispensa∣tion, and at the day of judgment. Our Saviour tells us, <HI>that two shall be grinding in the mill, the one shall be taken and the other left.</HI> All such as reject gospel reproofs and admonitions, shall meet with the same fate in the end that the old world met with.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER instance we have in the case of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the cities of the plain, who would not listen to the reproofs of <HI>Lot:</HI> Even his own sons-in-law looked upon all that he said as mockery, Gen. xix. 14. <HI>He seemed unto them as one that mock∣ed.</HI> Their sin vexed his holy soul, and he was grieved because they would not take advice. But their obstinacy brought upon them sudden destruc∣tion. They laughed at <HI>Lot,</HI> but their laughter was turned unto sadness. That fatal morning when <HI>Lot</HI> went out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> the sun rose clear, and the
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>inhabitants never dreamed of that terrible destruc∣tion that came before night. They went on in their voluptuous courses, and were obstinate against both men and angels: But ah, a sudden change! <HI>Fire and brimstone rain from heaven,</HI> and all the in∣habitants are swallowed up 'ere night. The inha∣bitants were an obstinate people, proud and op∣pressive. Ezek. xvi. 49. <HI>This was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom; pride, and fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</HI>—Because they enjoyed plenty and idleness, they were obsti∣nate; what should have made them grateful, made them wicked and oppressive.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE and observation teach us, that men when they enjoy affluence become proud, and the native daughters of pride are obstinancy and op∣pression. May we not see verified in common life, that some who have been teachable and tractable when poor, when once they have come into a condition of more independence, became more obstinate and untractable. <HI>Sodom</HI> became rich, and they became wicked and obstinate; till sudden destruction came upon them. Men are very unwilling to believe that the <HI>evil day will come;</HI> and those who warn and reprove them, are to them like mockers. The men of <HI>Sodom</HI> never thought that <HI>Lot</HI>'s words would be true, that <HI>God would destroy that wicked city,</HI> and became so hardened in sin that they feared no judgments.</P>
<P>WHAT a dreadful alarm would it be to the in∣habitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> when every house was full of fire and brimstone? Behold the gay citizen, the voluptuous youth, passing their time in pleasure and impurity! Perhaps some in stews, others in taverns, some at the gaming table, when suddenly they are all choaked <HI>with fire and brimstone. Lot</HI> told them that <HI>God would destroy that wicked
<PB N="236" REF="244"/>place;</HI> but they obstinately resisted his admonition, and laughed at his reproof: So they are suddenly consumed.</P>
<P>HOW sudden was their overthrow? How un∣expected their destruction? They were very un∣prepared for such a sudden blow. To be in the midst of fire and brimstone before they had finished their wicked devices: How dreadful the thought? All means of escape were then taken away. Whi∣ther, Oh whither, can they fly? The strong and weak are upon a level, no strength can save the strong man; no fortitude bear thro' the resolute. They were reso∣lute in sinning, and obstinate against all admonition, but cannot withstand the immediate hand of <HI>Jehovah.</HI></P>
<P>METHINKS I hear those who would not hear the admonitions of holy <HI>Lot,</HI> raving amidst the fire and brimstone, and exclaiming, Whither, Oh whither, shall we fly? What fools were we not to follow him and save our lives: Yea some cursing heaven in the bitterness of their torments, till the sulphur stop their breath. How wan and pale does the bloom∣ing youth look, that in the midst of rioting and debauchery, tastes of hell as it were in the body? When the sun arose, the morning clear, the heavens serene, the inhabitants of the plain pursue their filthy riots. Perhaps some rich oppressor goes forth to view his ill-gotten possessions, and feasts his eyes upon his pleasant fields; when suddenly from a sable cloud, a flash of lightning darts forth, at∣tended with a dreadful clap of thunder: A shower of fire and brimstone follows. He runs, he runs to his stately palace! When lo, on a sudden, all the city is on fire, and nothing but blackness mixt with running fire. How awful the thought! The house is no shelter, but is fewel to the fire. Ah! his house, his stately house, adorned with all the riches
<PB N="237" REF="245"/>of the <HI>East,</HI> and hung with tapestry and purple, is all in a flame about him.</P>
<P>THIS the effect of obstinacy and perverseness, this the proper fruit and effects of rebellion against God, and hardening the neck against reproof. Let <HI>Sodom</HI> and the old world be warnings to us, lest we be <HI>suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER instance we have of king <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI> and the people of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who hardened their necks against all admonitions and reproof till they were suddenly destroyed. <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> time after time warned <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his people, and re∣proved him for not letting <HI>Israel</HI> go <HI>to serve God,</HI> yet he hardened his neck against all reproof. But at last he met with a sudden overthrow.</P>
<P>THIS haughty monarch could say, <HI>Who is the Lord that I should obey him?</HI> And presumptuously pursued the peculiar people of the Most High into the Red Sea; but suddenly the swelling billows sur∣rounded him and all his host. He was warned what the consequence of obstinacy would be, but gave a deaf ear to all admonitions, till sudden de∣struction overtook him and all his host.</P>
<P>WHAT a sad change of fortune on a sudden do we see? <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his host pursued <HI>Israel,</HI> they went into the channel of the deep in hopes of bringing back their captives in triumph: But be∣hold the waters, at the commandment of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> swallowing up chariots and horsemen! <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s stately chariot and horses, the glory of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and all his princes overthrown in the depths of the sea.</P>
<P>METHINKS I hear <HI>Pharaoh</HI> calling out to his chariot-driver, Drive, drive as you would save your own life and the glory of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when suddenly a swelling billow carries off the charioteer. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> himself is obliged to take the reins, and drive the horses to shun death: What will not even kings do
<PB N="238" REF="246"/>for life? But ah! the sea oversets chariots, horses, king, and all! There the obstinate <HI>Pharaoh</HI> lies drowned in the deep, and is <HI>suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI> The admonitions of <HI>Moses</HI> had no effect upon his haughty mind; but what reason could not overcome, the floods did.</P>
<P N="4">4. I SHALL only add another instance of sud∣den destruction, as the fruit of obstinacy, and hardening the neck against reproof. The <HI>Jews,</HI> that ancient people, were an obstinate people. They would not listen to the voice of God by the pro∣phets, but persisted in their obstinacy, till they were <HI>suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI> Even the admonitions of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> could not prevail with them, but they hardened their necks like their fathers. At last the <HI>Roman</HI> army surrounded the city, destroyed it, and burnt their temple.</P>
<P>THESE Rev. priests, and bigoted pharisees; these superstitious <HI>Jews,</HI> that would not accept of a Saviour, <HI>but crucified the Lord of glory,</HI> suddenly saw their temple and city levelled with the ground. They would not listen to the voice of truth, but through obstinacy rejected the gospel; but whither now shall they flee for safety? If they remain in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the famine will destroy them; if they flee out of it, the sword of the <HI>Romans</HI> will slay them. <HI>They would not mind the things which belonged to their peace, but now they are hid from their eyes.</HI> They were called to the Most High, yet none at all would exalt him. <HI>How often would</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>have gather∣ed them, as a hen doth her chickens under her wings? and they would not.</HI> But now they see and feel the effects of their obstinacy; now they become car∣cases for the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles to prey upon.</P>
<P>THOSE who trusted in the temple, and lived by the altar, who rejected all reproofs, and would take no warning, can the temple or altar save them? No, no! Between the horns of the altar stands <HI>Levi,</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>whither he had fled for safety; fast, fast does he hold that sacred symbol: But now no more a symbol, since the signification and substance came. Blind pre∣judice and obstinacy makes <HI>Levi</HI> still keep the al∣tar, and holds by the horns. While this reverend <HI>Jew,</HI> this superstitious priest, hangs by the horns of this impotent defence, a <HI>Roman</HI> soldier throws a fire brand into the holy place, the <HI>sanctum sancto∣rum;</HI> and all of a sudden the temple is in flames! The gold melts, the wood burns, and <HI>Levi</HI> is <HI>de∣stroyed, and that without remedy.</HI> He was admonish∣ed by the prophets, he was warned by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> but continues obstinate; now he reaps the harvest of his obstinacy.</P>
<P>WHAT horrid grins, what ghastly looks might be seen in every face? These <HI>Jews</HI> who cried, <HI>Cru∣cify him! Crucify him!</HI> Lo how they stand in the inner temple, waiting the fatal moment when the devouring flames should burn them! At last the flames catch their <HI>Philacteries,</HI> and consume the holy garments: But worse, the priest, the pharisee, who gloried in them, are all reduced to a burning coal. Ah obstinacy! Obstinacy was the cause of this awful exit. They would not listen to reproof, nor hear admonition, and now they are <HI>suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>THE last thing proposed, was the improvement and application of the subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE goodness of God in giving man warn∣ing of their danger, and not cutting them off in a moment, in the first act of transgression and wicked∣ness. He reproves men for their good again and again; he gives them <HI>line upon line, precept upon pre∣cept,</HI> warning after warning. God might clear his own character in taking sinners at their first refusal, but he is long-suffering and full of compassion. The gracious parent of men, the merciful Lord of the world, shews his goodness, by the pains he is
<PB N="240" REF="248"/>at to reclaim offenders. He could easily rid him∣self of wicked rebels in the twinkling of an eye: He could give a commandment to an angel who could soon destroy multitudes; but instead of this, he waits graciously and patiently, to see if we will reform. Whether it be to clear his justice, or to shew his mercy, it is still mercy to men, as it gives them time and place for repentance, <HI>that their ini∣quities prove not their ruin.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE may see great reason of thankfulness to God who is so merciful to obstinate men. He is under no obligation, but freely spares the guilty. No man can say that God is under obligation to him to keep off the sentence of condemnation. How thankful should men be to God that he has not shut them up in eternal torments for the first sin they committed? <HI>The angels that left their first estate</HI> did not meet with such respite, nor ever got an offer of mercy: Sinners! guilty sinners, were the objects of his love, and of his patience and forbearance.</P>
<P>HOW thankful ought gospel-hearers to be, who are both spared, and have the offers of salvation? Are we better than the old world, or <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gommorah,</HI> that he should spare us, and offer his Son unto us? Nay, all the difference lies in the will of God, which makes the difference: None at all in us, we are not better than they.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may see the evil nature of obstinacy, and hardening our neck against reproof. It makes men incapable of sober impressions; it causeth them to abuse the best of things: The blessings of the gospel, which are the best things we enjoy, it marrs the usefulness of them to us. Reproofs, ad∣monitions, and loving exhortations offend, but do not reclaim obstinate persons.</P>
<P>WHEN this obstinacy takes root, it resists the most pressing calls, and the most loving exhorta∣tions.
<PB N="241" REF="249"/>This <HI>Christ</HI> witnesseth in the case of <HI>Jeru∣salem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee: how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under</HI> her <HI>wings, and ye would not?</HI> Obsti∣nacy causeth men to forget their greatest good, and their supreme happiness. Obstinacy is a constitu∣tional sin, or sin becomes a habitual part of our nature, whereby we sin without remorse: It is the privation of all feeling, or the insensibility of the soul; whereby the soul becomes insensible of mo∣ral pain or pleasure. By it the heart becomes <HI>as a piece of the nether milstone.</HI> What an evil thing must it then be?</P>
<P N="4">4. SEE the danger of obstinacy and hardening the neck against reproof: Such shall be <HI>suddenly de∣stroyed, and that without remedy.</HI> All finally obsti∣nate people have met with sudden destruction. The old world was drowned with a sudden deluge: <HI>Sodom</HI> was destroyed with fire and brimstone from heaven: <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his host were drowned, and overthrown in the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> were de∣stroyed by the <HI>Romans</HI> totally, and all for ob∣stinacy.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, be all exhorted to guard a∣gainst obstinacy: Harden not your necks against reproof, nor be offended at those who in love warn you of your danger; account them your best friends who put you in mind of your duty. Be afraid of resisting reproof; it has a tendency to harden the conscience, and in process of time will make you insensible to either mercies or judgments. Beware of once resisting any truth, for it will tend to more obstinacy. <HI>Israel,</HI> when once they began to resist the warnings God gave them by the pro∣phets, went on till they were <HI>suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>OBSTINACY is all the shield sinners have to
<PB N="242" REF="250"/>defend themselves with: But tho' it may make them proof against advice, it cannot screen them against sudden judgments. God will at last <HI>dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel.</HI> Do we not see many persons who have resisted reproof in the time of health and strength, and would not listen to reproof and admonitions, but run on in a course of riot and debauchery; when they come to dis∣tress and trouble, and at last to death, are obliged to sink under the burthen, and fall into despair. What bitter reflections, what agonizing thoughts, when they are about to launch forth into eternity? Their punishment is at last <HI>greater than they are able to bear;</HI> and they either despair of mercy, or turn stupid.</P>
<P>IN the case of old persons, who have led a life of sin and wickedness in their youth, it often hap∣pens that they sink in despondency, or end in stu∣pidity. Presumption or despair is the conse∣quence of obstinacy: They either never dread hell till they be in it, or seem to be in it before the time. Make it your study to seek <HI>a broken and a contrite heart, that may tremble at God's word:</HI> Be afraid when you find the word has no effect upon you, that your <HI>conscience becomes not seared as with a hot iron.</HI> The <HI>new heart</HI> is a tender heart, and when reproofs or admonitions are given it suspects itself.</P>
<P>NONE are more ready to presume upon the mercy of God, than such as are under the power and dominion of sin. But, ah! what a fearful wakening, never to dream of danger till in the midst of it; never to think of hell and destruction, and the wrath of God, till in the midst of eternal tor∣ments. Consider eternity, O obstinate sinner! you will have an eternity to live in obstinacy against God, when his wrath will for ever be poured out upon you, and torment your obstinate soul.</P>
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
<P>METHINKS I hear the groans and curses of some obstinate sinner, who hardened his neck a∣gainst reproof, cursing his God and his king, and looking upwards, roaring and crying, <HI>Oh, had I been wise, and considered my latter end!</HI> Had I listen∣ed to warnings and admonitions, I had not been in this place of torment; but now these things <HI>are for ever hid from mine eyes.</HI> I find I can reflect, but not repent; I can feel pain, but not compunction. Ah! what a damnable mortification, to think <HI>that such as I would not have set with the dogs of my flock,</HI> are the favourites of heaven, and enjoy eternal feli∣city there, and I must live with devils and damned spirits for ever and ever: Ah! eternity heightens my woe: Never, never will my torments end. I cannot, but must bear them.</P>
<P>IN yonder gloomy dungeon lies chained <HI>Avarice,</HI> who never would listen to reproof and admonition, but was constantly engaged in pursuing the gilded trash of this world: He sold his soul for a portion of this world's possessions; now on every hand of him stands legions of the infernal host as tormen∣tors. How awful his look! How does <HI>the smoak of his torment ascend up for ever and ever?</HI> Want and poverty, which he feared, is come upon him: <HI>The joyful sound,</HI> which he did not listen to, is also an addition to his torment. Instead of the songs of the temple, his ears hear nothing but the roar∣ing of the damned. The disgrace he feared is come upon him. His children he never taught the truths of religion, but the love of the world, are like so many vultures preying upon him, and tormenting him.</P>
<P>IN the custody of legions of black fiends is con∣fined a young man, just arrived from this sinful world, where he minded nothing but dressing his person, and following his cups, and attending the
<PB N="244" REF="252"/>gaming-table: His chief care was the finest dress, and the chief pre-eminence; but now legions of infernal fiends roast his soul in fire that is unqench∣able. He loved preferment, and now he's pre∣ferred with the warmest corner of hell. Ah! how he looks, roars, and curses: He even exceeds the devils in blasphemy: Now he hath <HI>not a drop of water to cool his tongue,</HI> nor any finery to deck or adorn him. He is in hell, and there he shall abide thro' endless eternity.—<HI>Suddenly is he de∣stroyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON VII. The Evil and Danger of Hypocrisy opened up and applied.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ISAI. lix. 5.</BIBL>
<P><HI>They hatch Cockatrice Eggs, and weave the Spider's Web: He that eateth of their Eggs dieth; and that which is crushed, breaketh out into a Viper.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is nothing which comes under our consideration so abominable as sin, and no sin more hateful in the sight of God than hypocrisy. The Spirit of God paints forth this sin in the most ugly colours, and with the highest aggravations. It is a crime that never is alone in the soul, but is attended with every other vice. In public and political matters it is attended with murder and oppression; it either murders fair characters, or takes away the life. It is in religious matters like the adultress <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks of, it watcheth for the precious life, and seeks the life of the soul.</P>
<P>THE prophet in this chapter sums up all the o∣ther crimes which he mentioneth in hypocrisy, as in the words of our text, <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Jews</HI> in this Prophet's time, were disposed to reconcile what never will be reconciled in the Mediator's spiritual kingdom, viz. Worldly power, and religious characters. They refined so much in their politics, that they introduced worldly policy into their religious system, or rather made religion subservient to their worldly and political views. Moral laws and precepts were of no weight to re∣strain
<PB N="246" REF="254"/>them from violence and oppression; for they thought it consistent with their policy to remove those out of the way who contradicted their mea∣sures, or opposed their views. This they did un∣der a pretence of regard to religion, though it was only to serve the ends of their policy. The Pro∣phets who were sent by God to reprove their vices, and to bring them back to that original system God gave them by <HI>Moses,</HI> they murdered and slew, because they spake against that policy which they had established in opposition to <HI>Moses</HI>'s institution. Nothwithstanding this their departure from the design of their theocracy, they were far from gi∣ving up the ceremonies of their religion, but cried, <HI>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are these:</HI> Though they had departed from the whole moral part of their religion, as to truth, mercy, judgment, and faith, they yet were zealous for that outward part which introduced them into wealth and preferment. It was found necessary, as it is in all countries where there is any policy, or civility, not to take away the minds of the populace from religion altogether; but at the same time to suit it to their inclinations, that thereby it might answer the ends of the priests and rulers.</P>
<P>THE common people among the <HI>Jews</HI> were the same as among all other nations, where their spi∣ritual guides keep them in ignorance of the spirit of Divine institutions, easily led by their senses, till they lose the use of them, and believed what was very foolish and senseless. They made an idol of their temple, and forsook the God whom they ought to have worshipped there: They attributed sanctity to the very gold that adorned their holy place, but were far from sanctifying the Lord who presided there in their hearts. From the most horrid acts of cruelty and impiety, they went to the temple to worship and to atone for the sin of their souls;
<PB N="247" REF="255"/>they at last went so far as to offer the fruit of their bodies. Notwithstanding all this impiety, their priests and their rulers made them believe that they were the only chosen people of God; and that the prophets, who threatened them in the name of the Lord for their sins, were enemies to their happi∣ness and the noble constitution of their church and nation. Fired with resentment against the prophets, by the instigation of their priests and rulers, they murdered them, and few of these messengers of the Lord escaped their bloody hands. Our <HI>Saviour</HI> tells them, <HI>They stoned them who were sent unto them.</HI> Our Prophet faithfully reproves this nation and church for their departure from the spirit of their law and religion, and calls their new scheme of politics, <HI>An hatching of cockatrice eggs, or working for the king of serpents,</HI> as the word signifies. He tells them openly and sincerely, that their present conduct was both deceitful and destructive; that however well they thought their scheme of politics laid, it was all vain; that they had refined too much upon their system, and that it would prove at last like a spider's web, a very empty thing; that this their wicked hypocrisy would ruin them at last, when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> should easily take them cap∣tive, when they were most secure.</P>
<P>THE words of our text give us the picture of a nation and people that were very superstitious, but very wicked. The idiom of the language points out the ugliness of their character: The prophet describes, in language something like the character, the baseness of that people's conduct: <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs,</HI> were engaged in the service of <HI>Satan,</HI> and working for him: This relates to the gradual progress of their sin and corruption: It was the effect of contrivance, and the fruit of wicked de∣signs. Sin comes not to perfection at once, but is like eggs that are first hatched before they bring
<PB N="248" REF="256"/>forth the cockatrice. Their making religion a po∣litical system was not finished in one day; they came to the height of wickedness and deceit, by a gra∣dual departure from the paths of truth and their original system. <HI>They weave the spider's web,</HI> i. e. they do a very deceitful but vain thing: They were great hypocrites, but their hypocrisy could not defend them from the judgments of God. This phrase shews unto us how much they had refined upon their ungodly system, till it could not bear any weight; it was like a spider's web, ready to be swept away by small instruments. Hypocrisy, how∣ever well it may look, has no strength in it to se∣cure men against the wrath of God, or the chal∣lenges of conscience. <HI>He who eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed, breaketh out into a viper:</HI> Such as are partakers with them in their sin, and join in their evil designs, shall die in the com∣mon judgment which shall come upon them, or rather die to all sense of true religion and virtue. Such as digests their principles shall suffer with themselves, and those who do not so heartily em∣brace them, but in the very hatching crush them like eggs, shall notwithstanding be shortened there∣with. Communion with men in sin is dangerous; it either produces death or great hurt. The word which is here rendered <HI>to eat,</HI> is rendered, <HI>Dan.</HI> vi. 24. <HI>To illuminate:</HI> For ordinarily hypocrites are greatslanderers and calumniators. These <HI>Jews</HI> abused the true servants of God with all the calumny and slander they could; they not only took away their lives, but endeavoured to ruin their name and character also. The sin of this people the Prophet describes from its ugly nature, and its ruinous effects: It was the special cause of the Lord's for∣saking them, and giving them up to their enemies. <HI>The Lord delights in the upright, but makes the ta∣bernacle of the hypocrite desolate.</HI></P>
<PB N="249" REF="257"/>
<P>IN handling this subject I shall first attempt to open up the first branch of the character in the text, <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs.</HI> 2dly, Consider the meaning of the phrase, <HI>They weave the spider's web.</HI> 3dly, Shew the danger of keeping com∣munion with persons of such a character. Then apply the subject.</P>
<P>THE first thing in the method was to open up the meaning of the first branch of the cha∣racter in the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH as have given up themselves to be servants to sin, are thereby inclined to pursue its pleasures, by all the means of malignity and deceit. Sin is both a poison and slavery to the soul; it in∣fects the whole man, soul and body; it blinds the understanding, corrupts the will, disorders the af∣fections, and benumbs the conscience. When men once engage in the practice of sin, the small know∣ledge they naturally have decays, in proportion as the habit and practice of sin advanceth. This is easily accounted for; the understanding grows in capacity, by an observance of the duties of the law of God: <HI>The law is a light unto the believer's feet, and a lamp unto his path.</HI> But sin is the re∣verse of this law, and has the very opposite effect: It is the way of darkness, in which men cannot see to walk, though they think they are walking uprightly. Sin, if once in possession of the heart, bewilders the soul: And sinners, like people gone wrong in a mist, are at a loss to know where they are: They are ready to think they are right when they are not, and congratulate themselves in their progress in the way to heaven, when they are in the high way to hell and destruction. Sin corrupts human will also; <HI>For the carnal mind is enmity a∣gainst God, and is not subject to the law of God, nei∣ther indeed can be,</HI> Sin hath corrupted the will of
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>man, as to its liberty and ease, in chusing that which is good. Had man continued innocent he could have used his liberty with ease and satisfac∣tion towards virtue and all her connexions; for goodness and purity would have been the objects which the soul would have chosen naturally: But since sin entered into the human heart, there is in it a proneness to evil, and a backwardness to that which is good: For though the will of man, when conscience points out the way of righteousness, or the way to destruction, may seem to incline to the one more than the other, yet it seldom inclines af∣ter the means which direct to happiness. The pro∣pensity is inclined another way, and so acts against the admonitions of conscience. In this case men exercise their will with uneasiness, and though they use their liberty, yet are they in bondage: For conscience and their will often directs different ways, and creates pain to the soul. When it happens, as it may sometimes do, that one may make choice of what is materially good, because it is agreeable to some passion or prejudice natural to his temper, yet does he not chuse the good thing from motives that are good: So when such a person embraceth that which is good of itself, he doth it from motives which are base and abominable. This is plain in the case of <HI>Jehu,</HI> who destroyed the house of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and the worship of <HI>Baal,</HI> which was accord∣ing to the will of the Lord; but it was to have a kingdom and crown to himself, and not to please the Lord he did it.</P>
<P>The will of man is always free, whether in a state of enmity with God, or in a condition of friend∣ship; but this liberty consists more in a desire to chuse than in full embracing, in those who are un∣der the power of sin and prejudice; for a wicked man may greedily desire sinful objects, but as he cannot altogether get clear of conscience, which
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>never will approve of chusing what is evil, so he timidly embraceth what he greedily desires. Thus is not the will free, in a proper sense of liberty, to such as are thus restrained in embracing what they greedily desire. And with respect to what is good, such is the corruption of the human will, though the mind may see necessity to chuse what is good and conducive to true happiness, yet appetite and pas∣sion is so constitutionally connected with the heart, that the desire inclines towards what is become most constitutional. Yet this is rather a thirst in a raging fever, which is an effect of a disease, than the de∣liberate fruit of reason and consideration. This error of the human will is owing to corruption of the human will.</P>
<P>SIN, in like manner, hath disordered the af∣fections, and always will do so, where it remains in its power and full force. When a propensity to sin and folly rules in the soul, and the inclination is strong to sinful objects, and conscience checks the career of the passions, there ariseth an intestine war, or rather a confusion in the soul. Love of pleasure, fear of punishment, hope of happiness, and a consciousness of guilt are contrasted so, that the affections of the mind are not only disordered, by being directed to false and wrong objects, but disordered in their direction to the very objects they are bent upon. This might be illustrated in com∣mon observation, if we consulted our own hearts, and the experiences of those, who either are or have been under the power of sin. I shall illustrate this by considering two characters. The worldly pro∣fessor of religion, and him who sinneth against the testimony of his own conscience, in any respect whatever.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE man who professeth religion, but is un∣der the influence of the world, and is directed in
<PB N="252" REF="260"/>all his views by worldly motives and reasons: His affections are miserably distracted betwixt these im∣pressions which religion now and then makes upon his mind, and that ardent regard he has to mam∣mon. Such a person is not willing to forfeit a re∣ligious character, for he has an affection to be thought religious, and he would at the same time gratify his worldly passion and affection. In the meantime his soul is divided between the love of fame and the love of riches. Often it happens that his silent slumbers depart from him, how to recon∣cile, what is altogether irreconcileable, a christian and a worldly character. When religion makes her just demands upon him, it frets his soul, because it makes too free with his idol the world: When he would willingly quit religion and sacrifice to mammon alone, then love of fame and reputation among the religious puts him to a stand: Thus he is tossed between different affections, till one may read in his very countenance the disease of his mind. These opposite affections sometimes come the length to scold one another's objects. When the man is under the influence of his worldly passion in a strong degree, he abuseth religion, and throws up to her what expence she has cost him; he ac∣cuseth her friends for bringing him into a snare, whereby he has suffered loss, and risked his cha∣racter with the profitable world. When this sally of affection is a little subsided, the other passion, the love of reputation among the religious, recoils upon him; then he is ready to call his friends un∣charitable, who blame him for his worldly temper of mind; he rages at them because they will not join with him in reconciling interest and religion: Because they cannot see any foundation to establish the kingdom of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> upon the same ground with worldly interest, he exclaims against them as uncharitable bigots, and vents his spleen against
<PB N="253" REF="261"/>them with the greatest fury: And here again he is tormented with two opposite affections, a desire to hope well of his own condition, and a desire to be friends with those whom his conscience tells him are enemies to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> and his cause. The ef∣fect of this disorder of affections is like its cause, sin in the heart, malignant and wicked: For it puts the poor distracted animal into such a madness, that he is ready to tear every character that is opposite to his own: Like a bear bereaved of her whelps, he tears the innocent; or like a madman, he throws fire-brands, arrows and death.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE also who sin against the testimony of conscience, in other instances have a sad disorder in their affections: Fears crowd in upon them, when they would willingly hope well of their condition. When they seek to apply the promises to their pre∣sent condition, their consciences tell them they have no interest in them. The promises belong to them that are in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> but their hearts tell them they do not love him, and consequently have no interest in him. These affections of hope and fear divide the man, and he is racked between the two: He finds upon trial his hope is groundless, and his fears are too well founded, so that for the most part the issue is final despair.</P>
<P>SIN also stupifies the conscience. That power of the soul we call conscience, is the last result of the mind in reviewing all her operations, and either approving or condemning herself, according as she finds them agreeable or disagreeable to that law which the Almighty hath given for a rule to the whole man. This power of judging is often ren∣dered indistinct, from the multitude of complicated thoughts, and compounded reasonings. A variety of complex causes are frequently presented to the conscience, whereby it is difficult to appropriate a right judgment unto them. Attainments, and im∣perfections,
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>motives and principles, the various degrees of each, come under consideration. Sins and duties, opportunities and ordinances, and the various uses or abuses of them, are also to be con∣sidered. All these being rendered more compli∣cated through the deceit of the human heart, it is difficult for the mind to judge of all that hath pas∣sed in it for any space of time. For this reason, like a judge who hath a number of different causes all presented to him at once, or a cause with many complex circumstances, the conscience is confused, and cannot well either approve or disapprove for the time. For whatever power of comprehension we may attribute to the conscience, we cannot say its knowledge is infinite; and as it hath received its own share of depravity, its knowledge and power of judgment is but definite in its present capacity. It is sin that is the cause of this; for if there had been no transgression, the mind would have had but one kind to survey; and if all actions and thoughts had been simple, there would have been but two kinds, good and evil. But sin hath wrought so much confusion in the soul, that it is hard to find any thought which, as to its object, is not com∣pounded.</P>
<P N="2">2. SIN makes men the very slaves of <HI>Satan.</HI> Every act of immorality is slavery to the soul, as thereby she acts contrary to her original freedom, and first design of rationality. The design of rea∣son and understanding was to imitate God in purity, perfection, and freedom of chusing what most re∣sembles him: But when men commit sin they bring themselves under the tyranny of the king and prince of darkness; <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs,</HI> or labour for the king of serpents, as the words signfy. Sin is an absolute slavery, as it never can be committed with freedom and ease. Men's lusts may force them to commit sin, against the
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>evidence of their own consciences; yet there will be a struggle within the soul, which even will make sin a bitter morsel, to such as even eagerly pursue it. The pleasure in the act is never equal to the after remorse, fear and trouble, which at∣tend it.</P>
<P>ALL sorts of sins carry along with them a great slavery. The man who follows after the world in an inordinate manner, what fears of disappoint∣ment perplex his mind; to have and to keep, dis∣tress him continually: His heart like the horse∣leach's daughters, cries always give, and never says it has enough. There is no satisfaction in the pre∣sent enjoyment; for the covetous heart still wants more, and the more it enjoys the more it would have, and craves the more.</P>
<P>HOW to keep what is acquired is also a distres∣sing consideration; thieves and bankrupts haunt the covetous man's imagination night and day: When others enjoy rest and repose, his distracted thoughts allow him no peaceful slumbers, but sleep departs from his eyes. He is a drudge to this world, and knows not the sweets of liberty, nor tastes the benefits of rational freedom. The man of pleasure is a slave to his inordinate lusts. He would preserve a character among men, and yet enjoy his unlawful pleasures; and between these two his judgment is upon the rack: Besides the distresses that attend this course of life, bear hard upon him. His evil desires would pursue unlaw∣ful pleasures, but experiences shew him that sick∣ness, distress, bitterness and remorse will be the consequence. The desire of pleasure, and the fear of poverty, divide his soul between them, so that no part is left to himself; for he hath no self en∣joyment: He is not his own master, he cannot do what he would: His desire persuades him to gra∣tify
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>his lust; his fears do check him least he come to want and disgrace.</P>
<P>THUS when men pursue the ways of sin and folly, they are bond-slaves to <HI>Satan</HI> and their own lusts, and want that which truly makes them men of liberty, thought and action. But if at any time conscience be awakened, and sets their sins and the justice of God before their eyes, horror and fears take hold of them, and bring them into bondage. They are afraid of death, and have no peace while they are living; for their minds have not what they desire, and conscience tells them if they seek it they shall perish: And it is no wonder, seeing they act contrary to the design of their nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. SIN is of a subtile nature. It penetrates like the poison of a serpent: Though not easily discern∣ed at first, it diffusseth itself through the whole man, soul and body. The <HI>Psalmist</HI> compares it to the poison of a snake, which though at first it seems to affect one part, runs by degrees through the whole body. Sin, though at first it may seem to reside in one disposition of the mind, yet will in process of time diffuse itself through all the rest. The covetous man at first desires to have, but at last puts out his hand and steals what belongs to his neighbour. The thief who intended to steal, but not to murder, will before he is discovered, embrue his hands in his neighbour's blood. The man that would only venture to the door of the harlot's house, at last goes in and hath a dart struck through his liver. So subtile a thing is sin, that if once begun, it hath no end; it spreads itself through the disposition of the mind. <HI>It is like a little leaven which leaveneth the whole lump.</HI> No man is safe who ventures to sin once, for it is impossible to sin once and not again: One sin opens the way for a train of other vices. If a man ventures to lie, he will do it again to conceal the first, and go on pro∣gressively.
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>The apostle <HI>James</HI> tells us, that lust, when it is conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</P>
<P>THE subtilty of sin will appear from its influence upon the particular thoughts of the heart, in order to actions: Where evil and vicious inclinations are once admitted into the mind, they gradually in∣crease till they terminate in some wicked action, if occasion and opportunity come in the way. And frequently the man who only allowed an inordinate desire to take a little residence in his mind, hath by the concurrence of the desire and the opportunity proceeded to gratification, and consummated the evil desire by an evil action.</P>
<P>THE nature of all sin is to ascend to an higher degree; and the better to lead on the unwary sin∣ner, the tempter begins with what seems small or indifferent at first; makes as it were a lodgement in the soul, and proceeds by sap till the persons is un∣dermined and made a consummate sinner. Like the poison of a serpent, if once allowed to reside in one member it will poison the whole rational frame, and bring death and ruin upon both soul and bo∣dy. No man is safe with the least of this moral poison in his soul: It wastes like a canker, and issues in death.</P>
<P>Lastly, IT is sometimes long before the evil principle comes to perfection. Many contrivances, plans and schemes may be fallen upon before this deadly cockatrice is hatched. Sometimes it is car∣ried on by one appearance, and sometimes by another, but it always disguiseth its real character. Deceit will sometimes wear the cloak of friendship, and he who intends no good, because it is not in his power to do evil, will use the decoy of fair words, and seem concerned for our interest, to lead us off our guard that he may ruin us when he gets an opportunity. Fair promises may, for a season,
<PB N="258" REF="266"/>pass for good designs; and they may promise fair who never intend to perform, but design the con∣trary. Zeal may wear the mask of religion, and go under the name of zeal for the Lord, when self-interest is the real motive; as was the case with <HI>Jehu.</HI> If religion is the preliminary to worldly preferment, many will seem devout and religious, but will as easily throw it aside when the end is an∣swered. An enemy may support our interest, to gain our credit, that he may have it his power at last to ruin us. Some, like <HI>Joash,</HI> do well for a season, who only want an occasion to do what has long been their purpose to do. Like the cocka∣trice that hatcheth before it bringeth forth, at last brings forth a serpent. Parasites, who long hang on about a court, may for a time be very obsequi∣ous, and seem to approve the measures of the so∣vereign; but if once in place, will intrigue, plot, and undermine, and at last prove traitors. The body of sin comes to perfection by degrees, and the cup of wicked men is not filled up at once. But at last evil principles come to their height, and the man of sin comes to his full stature: Nothing can prevent sin from coming to full perfection, but that divine truth which changeth the heart; for as to all the efforts of human energy, <HI>That which is crooked cannot be made streight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2. To open up the meaning of the phrase; <HI>They weave the spider's web;</HI> or, to explain the nature of hypocrisy under this figure of speech:</P>
<P N="1">1. HYPOCRISY is a complex vice, made up of different materials. Many vices make up this one; like the spider's web it is composed of many threads. Atheism and unbelief are ingredients in this dan∣gerous composition: For nothing can savour more rank of atheism than to conceal our real designs,
<PB N="259" REF="267"/>when we cannot but be certain that the all-seeing eye of God is ever upon us. Every hypocrite is guilty of disguising his real character, for he seldom loves to appear as he is, and this conduct carries in it the most atheistical sense imaginable; for who that believes that God sees him would pretend to be what he is not, when he is sure if there is a God he will bring all things to light, whether they be good or evil. If men can conceal their crimes from God, under any mask whatever, he may also, for aught they know, be ignorant of their wants also; and could not in that case be the portion of his people. There is the greatest atheism in the conduct of hypocrites, and the greatest contradic∣tion: For when they profess religion they pretend to depend upon God, but when they are not what they appear to be, they render worship to him that according to their own principles is not God. For if they can hide any thing from him he is not om∣niscient, and therefore is not God; and thus one part of their conduct destroys another.</P>
<P>UNBELIEF is another ingredient in hypocrisy. An hypocrite is an infidel, because he doth not be∣lieve the gospel account of God's infinite knowledge. A believer of the Divine intelligence dare not hy∣pocrise, because he is persuaded nothing is hid from <HI>Jehovah,</HI> whose eyes run to and fro to be∣hold the hearts and ways of the sons of men. Every man would be the same in his thoughts, words, and actions, at all times, and in all places, did they really believe the testimony of God concerning hyporites. The Scripture is very plain upon the head of hypocrisy, and informs men of the hate∣fulness of the sin, and awfulness of its consequences. Job xv. 34. <HI>For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate.</HI> Job xxxvi. 13. <HI>The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath.</HI> Job viii. 13. <HI>The hypocrite's hope
<PB N="260" REF="268"/>shall perish.</HI> Prov. xi. 9. <HI>An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth much good.</HI> Luke xii. 1. <HI>Beware of the leaven of hypocrisy.</HI> When the Divine testimony is so express against deceit and hypocrisy, speaks so much of its evil, and shews so plainly the many threatnings denounced against it, surely that man must be an infidel who is guilty of hypocrisy.</P>
<P>IGNORANCE and knowledge are also componant parts of hypocrisy. Ignorance is an ingredient in hypocrisy; for if men were possest of true know∣ledge they would not be hypocrites; and if they wanted it they could not be such. It is not possible for men to be guilty of hypocrisy, if they knew God right, and understood his character truly, for the knowledge of God begets faith: <HI>They who know thy name will put their trust in thee,</HI> Psal. ix. 10. and this faith would naturally produce sincerity. It is ignorance of the true character of God which maketh men hypocritical and insincere before him. Yet it must be granted, that there are sundry men of understanding, as it is so called by the world, who are hypocrites: For if they were void of knowledge altogether, or had not some competent measure of understanding, they could not contrive how to disguise themselves, and hide and conceal their real character.</P>
<P>THIS knowledge which hypocrites have, is very defective in its nature, because it never entereth in∣to the nature of truth, nor the springs of action in the human heart. The greatest length that this hypocritical knowledge reacheth, is to the decorum of things, not to their nature and proper end. Hy∣pocrisy hath its special concern employed about the out-lines of religion, but never enters into the spirit of it. Hypocrites attain to the understanding of what some call decency and order, or that part which the eyes of men behold: All the shewey part of a religious character they understand, and strive
<PB N="261" REF="269"/>to obtain; but as to the spirit of real godliness they know it not. Even the most refined part of their hypocrisy, which concerns the most spiritual part of their religion, or that which is likeliest to real godli∣ness, is a mixture of ignorance and knowledge. They are imperfect in all the parts of their reli∣gious character. Their knowledge is only some perceptions which are common to every man who hath the means of understanding; which is far from that rational knowledge, founded upon comparison of principles and drawing conclusions.</P>
<P><HI>They weave a spider's web,</HI> or in other words, are hypocrites who depend upon simple perceptions, and corporeal impressions, and embrace these for true and rational religion. Simple perceptions, such as seeing or hearing, may produce different effects upon our animal frame, such as fear, joy, and pain; as howling in the ear of a dog will make him howl also, and pleasant melody will give plea∣sure, without any comparing of ideas, and yet there may be no religion upon the whole. Reli∣gion is the right direction of our reason, or our ra∣tional powers well directed by Divine truth: And this extendeth to every power and operation of the rational soul, in a greater or lesser degree: For this change that the truth makes, is a change of the whole powers of the human mind, and enables her both to perceive, compare, and judge according to truth. When men receive the feelings which arise from mere perceptions for the workings of divine power, they have no more religion, notwith∣standing than other animals; and only deceive themselves by taking perception for reason, or, if you will judge from one feeling as if there were many. Of this kind are enthusiasts, who when any impression is made upon their fancy by simple perception, they infer the same thing from it; which can only reasonably be inferred from sundry
<PB N="262" REF="270"/>other feelings, such as judgment and reasoning. This may be called, when applied to religion, the religion of animals; but can never be christian, for christianity teacheth us that religion is an ex∣ercise of the whole mind. I shall not say that per∣ception simply is not knowledge, but only say it is not rational knowledge, but such as is competent to every animal. Rational knowledge arises from comparing our different feelings or perceptions, and making an estimate of the relation they bear to one another, and the inference justly drawn from this estimation is true knowledge. But when men, without any estimation at all, found their moral or religious characters upon any simple feeling by it∣self, they draw a false picture of their character, and judge of themselves erroneously.</P>
<P>To illustrate this by examples from Scripture and observation, allow me to point out a few cha∣racters of the kind already hinted at. The <HI>Laodi∣ceans,</HI> mentioned <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. were people who imagin∣ed themselves high in the Divine favour, though they were in the sight of the Almighty miserable and wretched. The enjoyment of privileges, and ease in the use of them, made them conclude the happiness of their present condition from the feeling of ease, without ever enquiring into the connexion between that feeling and happiness in the life to come. The account of them is, <HI>They thought them∣selves rich, and increased with goods;</HI> were fond of their present condition, and dreamed of happiness from their present feelings; when at the same time they were quite indifferent about moral truth and obligation. They were enthusiasts as to their hopes, but lukewarm in their lives and practice. Their perception of present ease excluded all comparison of their condition with the law of God. Had they exercised their judgment and reason as well as their fancy, they would have found their foolish hopes
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>altogether groundless: For nothing can be a cer∣tain rule of judgment concerning real happiness but the divine word. And even men may receive the word itself erroneously, if they receive immediate impressions from it, without examination and judg∣ment. It may happen that truth delivered in an agreeableness to our leading passion, may leave an agreeable feeling behind it, which is no more than happened to <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s hearers: It may please but not reform. Nothing but what passeth through the judgment can reform the heart. Experience shews us that the greatest pretenders to immediate feelings, and who lay the greatest weight upon an immediate intercourse with heaven, have the most unworthy notions of the Divine character, and the doctrines of the word of God.</P>
<P>THIS will appear evident when we consider that it is not the beauty of truth and sentiment that creates the perception, but the way in which it is expressed. Pleasing perceptions give delight, such as arise from music or beauty, but without reason and judgment: The pleasure is only sensitive and not rational. When men found their hopes and fears upon such pleasing perceptions, without con∣sidering what they relate to in matters of religion, they only weave a spider's web: For when they think they believe the word of God, they only be∣lieve their own sensations, and not what he hath revealed. However great pretensions men may have to the Divine favour, and an experience in religion, if they receive not Divine truth as just and rational sentiments, they have reason to suspect themselves to be hypocrites.</P>
<P>IF we examine a little farther into experience we will find that many have no more religion than what is founded upon sensitive feeling, or the fer∣vency of their animal motions. If at any time a pleasant object happens to be represented to the
<PB N="264" REF="272"/>eye, it begets a pleasure which makes the imagina∣tion go so fast, that it either magnifies or multi∣plies the object beyond reality, and from a fondness of the pleasure, one who is not accustomed to rea∣soning believes all real before ever he examines in∣to the nature of the object, or the impression it hath made upon the mind. This will hold also with respect unto disagreeable representations, and the fearful impressions they produce. When men establish their hopes and fears upon such feelings as arise from corporeal impressions, they act without judgment, and however strong either the one or the other may be, they are ready to be delusions. Such persons as have no other hope of happiness but what is founded upon these impressions, are but very uncertain of their condition.</P>
<P>SIMPLE perception cannot certify us of moral truths; for though our senses are instruments of conveying truth to the mind, it is the mind that compares the different perceptions let in by the senses, and that judges of their relation to one ano∣ther. The testimony of God in the word is re∣ceived only when believed to be true and worthy of acceptation, and this reception ariseth from ra∣tional comparison, which the mind only is capable of. To infer that we have received Divine truth, or believed the gospel, when the pleasure of the hearing is all the reason of our belief, is to do no more than the strong ground hearers did, for they received the word with joy. The true reason of belief is truth, and the rational ground of pleasure is the interest we have in it; and this is the object of moral consideration, or the result of comparing our various feelings: This is the effect of free enquiry, and not of simple perception: It is founded upon evi∣dence, which is known only by judgment and trial, and which simple perception cannot measure, more
<PB N="265" REF="273"/>than one can measure an unknown dimension, with∣out some means or intermediate rule.</P>
<P>UPON the whole it appears evident that such deceive themselves, <HI>and weave a spider's web,</HI> who rest upon corporeal impressions, without judgment and true understanding. For if we consider the way how our mind finds out the truth, it will ap∣pear to be by using her operations naturally, which are perception, judgment, and reason, the acqui∣ring simple notions, the comparing two, and mea∣suring them by a third, which constitutes a full process of rational exercise. In religion this exer∣cise may be slower or faster according to the capa∣city of the natural powers, or the measure of evi∣dence afforded, which strengthens them; but then all true Divine knowledge in this our embodied condition, is attained to by this exercise: What is repugnant to this exercise of the mind is not religi∣on but enthusiasm. Self-deceivers and hypocrites of all sorts are guilty in this particular, in found∣ing their persuasions of truth upon an imperfect or irregular exercise of the operations of the mind. When an awful truth is published, or a pleasing one declared, sometimes they produce the affections of fear or joy; but these affections arise more from the suddenness of the intimation, and the a∣greeableness or disagreeableness of the manner of address, than from any just knowledge of the con∣nexion between the intimation and fear and joy. The truths of the gospel are no more to persons of this character than an intimation of the approach of an enemy, or the coming of a friend, by one whose fidelity we know not. A whole city may be alarmed by a false report, because they do not ex∣amine the messenger, or reject a true one for the same reason, and either become enthusiasts through fear, or infidels through wilfulness and obstinacy. In like manner, many who hear the truths of the
<PB N="266" REF="274"/>Divine word misapply them, because they do not seriously examine and consider them, and compare them with their present condition: They tremble when they have cause to rejoice, and rejoice when they have reason to tremble.</P>
<P>TRUE religion and philosophy agree in this, that both direct men to an orderly exercise of the rational powers; and hypocrites and enthusiasts are neither christians nor philosophers. When the gospel changeth men's minds, it doth it by bring∣ing them to consideration, and enables them to form better sentiments, yea sentiments altogether new; and these new sentiments are no more but Divine truths fixed on the soul by true considera∣tion. This consideration is the mind going through her operations, according to the natural end and use of them. It would be dishonourable to religi∣on to say that it destroyed the end for which we were made, which was to glorify God, by acting according to our nature: And it is certain, in an innocent state, that the mind of man received all truth by a natural exercise of her powers and ope∣rations. Grace is then no more but a change of the error of the mind, and a putting it where it was at first, with this addition of keeping it right. It may then as justly be said, that such as embrace not Divine truth through these channels of know∣ledge are under a delusion, and will at last, if they repent not, together with their web of delusion, be swept into the bottomless pit.</P>
<P>HYPOCRISY is a compound of knowledge and ignorance. It would be impossible for men if they were altogether ignorant to act the hypocrite, and if they were endued with true understanding they would not do it. When men are guilty of weav∣ing this web of deceit, they have some understand∣ing of the theory of truth, or they know how to express themselves in its language; they have learned
<PB N="267" REF="275"/>as much of its common principles in theory, as serves them to converse with its friends in their own language: But then they are ignorant of the power and value of the truth, and so use it only as an engine to serve their purpose, or as a snare to entrap the unwary. This knowledge of truth with which hypocrites are endowed, is not such an understanding of its principles as directs them to love and reverence the author, but is only a few common notices from reading or observation which they have collected to serve their purposes. They receive not the truth in the love thereof, because they are ignorant of its true value, and have no more understanding of it than extendeth to worldly purposes, and political advantages.</P>
<P>HYPOCRITES are like some smatterers in science, who are not thoroughly learned, nor yet quite igno∣rant. They know some truths partially, but under∣stand not the system; and because of their want of capacity to be thoroughly learned, they through dis∣gust abuse the little knowledge which they have to bad purposes. This deficiency of knowledge which prevails in hypocrites, consists of the want of under∣standing of the intrinsic value of truth; for no ra∣tional being, who rightly understood the nature and value of truth, would make any other use of it but to serve the Author of it. Their ignorance con∣sists in not knowing how to apply it to its proper ends and purposes. Through want of a true know∣ledge of truth, they are not afraid to use it to all the purposes of deceit; and because they have some superficial traces of it in their heads, they are ca∣pacitated to make use of it to the ends of wickedness and dissimulation.</P>
<P>MEN who have not digested the truth thorough∣ly, but received the principles of religion as a way of thinking, through ignorance of the value of true christianity, pervert it to the purposes of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="268" REF="276"/>advantage, attending that way of thinking. It is evident they have some knowledge, but know not as they ought to know; for it is one thing to know religion in theory, and another thing to know it so as to practise it. The one is like that knowledge where∣by a person can give a very good account of the reason of a thing, but when called to execute it, cannot perform any part of it; the other like him, who though he can but reason imperfectly, can per∣form completely. The one's knowledge consists in thinking, but the other's consists of both thinking and practice. Every hypocrite is a compound of ignorance and some knowledge, for without both there can be no hypocrising. Knowledge makes a man capable of deceit, but ignorance makes him risk his happiness in the adventure. No man, who knows as he ought to know, would risk the danger that attends deceit and hypocrisy.</P>
<P N="2">2. HYPOCRISY fixes upon a false foundation. For <HI>want of the knowledge of the truth as it is in</HI> Jesus, every hypocrite <HI>builds his house upon the sand.</HI> The very first principles of their experience are founded upon falshood. False Notions of peace and the Divine character, are the principles of their de∣luded experience. Like the <HI>Spider,</HI> who hath been long tossed with wind and storm without, at last reaches the palace, and as <HI>Solomon</HI> expresseth it, <HI>taketh hold with her hands, and is in king's palaces;</HI> builds her house, weaves her web, and basks with pleasure in her new habitation; never reflecting up∣on the precarious right she hath to her new situa∣tion, she weaves her web with security.—But at last the broom sweeps away her web, and then she is taught her error. Many who have led a vicious course of life, being alarmed with the intimations of the word, and their own conscience, through the pain and uneasiness they feel in their own mind for sins they have committed, and for fear of Divine
<PB N="269" REF="277"/>vengeance, change their course of life all in a sud∣den; and because they have changed their actions, but not their dispositions, they <HI>speak peace to their souls,</HI> and enjoy ease. They found their hope of happiness not upon a real change of sentiment, but upon some alteration in their external conduct. They are the same in their heart, if their fears would suffer them to act. They are like a <HI>Lion</HI> in chains, which retains still its old disposition to cruelty. From the ease they find from a change of action, they con∣clude that their hearts are changed also; but all the difference of their condition lies in this, that insteed of doing things bad in themselves, they do good things badly. The same principle that inclined them before to do evil, disposeth them now to do good. Self-satisfaction, and a love to please them∣selves, was the leading principle to vice before, and self-ease and pleasure is the same actuating principle with them still. In this respect a man may pray, for the same reason he cursed or swore before. Self-interest and pleasure, or love of ease, will make men change their course of action when there is no change in their inward sentiments. <HI>Jehu</HI> was zeal∣ous for the Lord in his actions, but the leading mo∣tive with him was self-interest. When men change a course of action which has been both vitious and absurd, they may imagine they are inwardly re∣formed, when the same principles remain in full force in their heart. This is in Scripture called, a <HI>crying peace; peace, when there is no peace. Job</HI> in∣forms us that <HI>the hypocrite hath hope,</HI> though it <HI>shall perish.</HI> This hope of happiness is founded o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de∣lusionary principles; upon a change of action, with∣out a change of principle, or upon a changing of one evil course of life for one not so obnoxious. Experience teacheth us that some who have been notable patrons of open immorality, have through the bitterness of remorse changed their course of
<PB N="270" REF="278"/>open prophanity to a course of more refined iniqui∣ty, and concluded the goodness of their condition from this alteration. Yea, some have by this means passed themselves upon the world as converts to Godliness, that they might have it in their power to work more profitable wickedness.</P>
<P>OF this kind are all those, who make a sudden tran∣sition from the coarser part of <HI>Satan</HI>'s service, and embrace a religious course of life to serve him with more refinement. They suddenly change the mark of their master from their foreheads to their hands, and instead of following a course of open wicked∣ness, they change it for a course of refined hypo∣crisy. This hypocrisy is founded upon a mistaken notion of conversion. It is the opinion of these re∣ligious servants of the Devil, that conversion is no more but a change from horror to peace and tran∣quility, and that when ever a man has been badly enough frighted; the first ease is genuine peace. They as soon as their panick is over sing a <HI>requiem</HI> to their souls, never considering what motives influenced them to this course of life. And thus, though they be censorious, uncharitable, and slanderers of others, this pretended conversion atones for all. They are the children of God, and therefore may play the devil when they will with all that differ from them in opinion or sentiment. The foundation of their delusive hopes of assurance, is also founded upon a false view of the Divine character. His Mercy and Grace, and that power which they have heard at∣tributed to him in the conversion of sinners, they appropriate to themselves, and conclude that Divine power and mercy hath effected that change which they now have made, and therefore hope in God according to their own view of his character, though it be altogether false. Because they have felt fear, and now enjoy peace, they conclude it to be <HI>the peace of God that passeth all understanding;</HI> never
<PB N="271" REF="279"/>considering that this partial view of the Divine character can give hope to none. For although he be merciful, he is also a God of truth, and will ne∣ver favour hypocrisy and deceit.</P>
<P>BY attributing to God the honour of that change which they have felt in themselves, they think he is obliged to succeed it with all other Divine advanta∣ges. They both father this spurious brat of the father of lies upon the God of truth, and think him obliged to them for being so tractable as to be con∣verted. They account it a mercy that God has now made them change a course of open wicked∣ness, for a life of secret iniquity, and hope that now his mercy will never forsake them. This foolish vain conceit is founded upon as vain a no∣tion of the Divine character, that seeing they are now his friends, which at the same time they have no evidence for, they hope, though they indulge secret sin, he is still obliged to save them. More∣over they found their hopes of happiness, and assure themselves of the Divine favour upon a most par∣tial belief of the truth. These truths relating to the character and offices of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> they mi∣serably separate and divide, and yet hope, <HI>though they walk in the imagination of their own hearts.</HI> Many of these hypocritical assurances, which pass for current salvation among sundry deluded enthu∣siasts, are founded upon a preposterous division of Divine truth. They will allow that the Grace of God converted them, and the Blood of <HI>Jesus</HI> re∣deemed them, but yet refuse the perpetual efficacy of both God's Grace and <HI>Christ</HI>'s Blood. Though they are unequal for conversion, they have yet the assurance to to say, that the increase of their virtue is owing to their own power. And though God is so powerful as to convert them in spite of their pre∣judices, yet he is not able to keep them in that good state he brings them into. Thus they first establish
<PB N="272" REF="280"/>free Grace and then destroy it. Their belief of the truth is quite partial, and they have not an univer∣sal respect to the whole of Divine revelation. This is evident from the avowed principles of these con∣verts to hypocrisy: For they with the greatest zeal maintain the irrestability of Divine Grace in their first conversion, and as zealously refute its perpe∣tual energy in their after-life. There is something very wonderful in this dream, that the Grace of God should grow weaker by exercise, and should be able to conquer an enemy, and not be able to secure a friend. We are certainly as much obliged to believe that believers are kept by the Power of God through faith unto salvation, as we are obliged to believe that <HI>we are justified freely by his Grace through the redemption that is in</HI> Jesus.</P>
<P>THIS web of hypocritical conversion, is founded upon a sinful separation of what God hath joined together, <HI>free justification through the redemption that is in</HI> Jesus, and the promised assistance made to his people, <HI>to keep them in his ways. I have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness will I draw you; I will put my spirit within you; I will give you a new heart, and ye shall never depart from me.</HI> Is it possible that these persons can be converted to the truth that so evidently deny it, or can that man have any sure hope of salvation who receives not the whole revealed counsel of God. But hypocrisy is ever full of contradiction. What can be more contradictive, than to pretend to be what we are not? To hope for happiness and not <HI>receive the truth in the love thereof?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN first a sense of remorse begins to appre∣hend them, and conscience dictates from the no∣tices it hath received from the word of God a great number of horrible things, they are then ready to take the readiest relief. When <HI>Christ</HI> is revealed in the Gospel as a Saviour and Redeemer, who <HI>de∣livers
<PB N="273" REF="281"/>sinners from the wrath to come,</HI> these converts are ready to flee to him at first notice, as one who can give them ease from present pain; but at the same time they never enquire into his character fur∣ther, nor consider the nature of his kingdom. They are pleased with as much of a Saviour as will give them immediate ease from the challenges of an ac∣cusing conscience, but have not yet thought upon the purity of his Laws. All the view they have of sin is that it will bring them into condemnation, the vileness of it never gives them pain. For this rea∣son they receive not <HI>Christ</HI> in all his offices, but would willingly only have him as a Saviour to set them free from misery. Having heard that <HI>Christ</HI> delivers from wrath and condemnation, they then work up their minds to a conceit that they have received him, and then their consciences become quiet, and they enjoy rest. This sudden calm they take as a prognostic of every thing that is good, and conclude that they are now converted; and in∣deed they are so in a certain sense: They are con∣verted from a condition of fear and horror into a condition of self-conceit, and false peace. Now they, like the <HI>Spider,</HI> weave their web of false expe∣rience, upon a foolish conceit that they are the chil∣dren of God. Now they triumph in a garment of their own righteousness, which they mistake for the <HI>righteousness of</HI> Christ. And many rest here and never advance any further, till death sweeps their delusive web of false experience and themselves into the bottomless pit.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, hypocrisy makes men receive a false rule of judging of themselves. Hypocrites judge of their condition preposterously, by seeking grace within them before they look to their ways and actions. Upon this false rule of judgment, they found their false and delusive hopes of happiness.— For though their lives be no way conformable to
<PB N="274" REF="282"/>the laws of Christianity, they trust upon something they call grace in their hearts; but what this some∣thing is, no man but themselves can understand. The rule our Saviour hath left, to judge of men's state by, is of a different nature, <HI>by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye keep my command∣ments.</HI> But the hypocrites have no larger preten∣sions to good works than others, yet they excel all men for pretensions to Grace and the Divine favour. On the account of this unknown something they have given the name of Grace to, they hope for all things, and make a monopoly of the Divine favour to themselves. But what a false way of judging is this, to seek the cause before it can be evidenced by the effects of it. One may as well pretend to as∣cend to heaven, or some distant region to find that there is a God, and then come back and prove that he made the world. The best way of judging of the reality of our grace is from our love, which is evidenced by keeping God's commandments.</P>
<P N="3">3. HYPOCR<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SY consists in drawing false repre∣sentations to the conscience. Conscience will ever be faithful in marking what passes in the mind, but may sometimes be mistaken as to the object repre∣sented: A false likeness may deceive it. When objects pass through a deluded imagination, and are either magnified or diminished, mutilated or en∣creased, the conscience may not so soon see through the disguise. Though we may suppose a parent to know his own child, yet if the child act in disguise, and feign a different character, the parent may not know his own offspring in this character. Though our conscious power will ever observe moral good and evil fairly represented, yet a delusive imagina∣tion may draw the picture of falshood so like truth, that reflection cannot easily discern the difference. A false representation of terrible objects may much startle conscience, and cause fear where there is no
<PB N="275" REF="283"/>real danger, and a deceitful appearance of an ami∣able one, may calm it into peace when there is the greatest reason of fear. Often a false report of im∣pending danger makes us afraid when there is no truth in the testimony; and often a specious report of agreeable tidings will flatter us into joy, when all is fictitious and nothing real. A delusive fancy, or a giddy imagination, may paint the objects of ter∣ror or joy in the strongest point of light, from ma∣terials that never were designed for any such pur∣pose, and impress fear or joy upon the mind which are quite groundless and imaginary. This is the reason why many have fears and hopes which are altogether without foundation: This is the reason why many are frightened that were never convin∣ced, and many wrapt up in transports of joy, that were never converted. Men receive the notices of fancy and imagination, without examining the na∣ture of the object, or the truth of the representation, and satisfy themselves with a whimsical pleasure, or distress themselves with an unreasonable fear. In this respect men may be hypocrites without design, as well as with it. For when the cause of the false representation is without them, it may leave its im∣pression upon the imagination involuntarily, which insensibly becomes a habit and grows constitutional. This is ordinarily the case with these persons who have the misfortue to be under the influence of en∣thusiasts: For though they would never have been in such circumstances, had they not had these phan∣toms so often repeated unto them, yet from their connection with such persons, and their opinion of them, they fall insensibly in love with what they often represent. They are led into self-deceit by external causes, and into a good or bad opinion of their condition from the representations that are by outward causes made upon their imaginations. Yet they are no less hypocrites on that account, be∣cause
<PB N="276" REF="284"/>they do not intend it; for whoever is not what he appears to be, is an hypocrite whether he he knows it or not.</P>
<P>HYPOCRITES are of two sorts, such as deceive their consciences with representations of their own forming, by working up their imagination to a cer∣tain pitch of delusion, and persuading their minds that the phantom is a real object; and such as are insensibly led into that deceit without any design of being so. The one are designing, the other oc∣casional hypocrites: Yet neither are what they ap∣pear to be; both pretend to the Divine favour from their false feelings, but neither of them un∣derstand the true terms of acceptance with God. Impressions upon the mind, that are not directed by judgment and free enquiry, are of no more con∣sideration in religion, than dreams are in common life. They who do not receive truth according to the rational operations of the human soul, and the rules of right reason, may boast of their inter∣course with the Almighty as they please, but have no reason to conclude any thing certainly. Divine truth though it effects a supernatural change in the soul, in point of sentiment, yet it does not change the nature of her operations. Truth comes, not directly and intuitively into the soul, but passeth through all the powers of perception, judgment, and ratiocination. When the mind is renewed by the truth, it is by the truth sanctifying all the powers thereof, and enabling it to exercise all its various operations. In this our imperfect state we cannot understand truth but by reasoning and en∣quiry: And this we often pervert to bad ends and purposes. Divine truth, when it takes possession of our minds, directs our reason right, and causeth us to judge of objects truly and rationally. As all we know of the will of God concerning our happiness and duty is delivered in a Testimony, and this Tes∣timony
<PB N="277" REF="285"/>consists of sundry propositions; these propo∣sitions must enter into our mind, according to the stated method of knowledge, by perception, judg∣ment, and reason. All the supernatural assistance we have reason to expect, is only to help us to per∣ceive, judge, and reason aright, or to change our wrong perceptions, rectify our wrong judgment, and remove our false reasonings. There is no re∣ligion without such a comparison of these proposi∣tions which we receive to be truth. Perception of itself cannot judge of the truth of what is perceived; it may feel an impression, but cannot without judg∣ment determine its propriety; and the measure of two distinct feelings cannot be determined but by a third, which makes reason necessary as well as perception and judgment. An impression arising from a single perception may be very delusive, un∣less it is corrected by judgment. If one should for once be robbed upon a certain part in the high∣way, by single perception he would have the im∣pression of a robbery upon his mind every time he came to that place, unless he was to compare and judge that robbers do not always keep the same place. Most of animals have the same impressions arising from simple perception, that if they have received any harm they fear it when they come to the same place.</P>
<P>OF consequence those who do not receive the truth as reasonable propositions from enquiry and just comparison, cannot be said to understand it. I mean not that all believers must go through a course of formal logical reasoning; but that what∣ever method they take, they must compare their feelings before they determine certainly concerning them. Without this they will be ready to form false representations to their consciences, and ei∣ther fear or rejoice without any just ground.</P>
<P>ALL the conversions we read of in the <HI>New Tes∣tament,</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="286"/>consisted not only in making men feel, but judge and discern, and it was by a just estimate of things they came to a settled condition of joy and peace. Even the three thousand converted by <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>'s sermon, were converted by the exercise of judgment and reason. It was by the comparing the truth of <HI>Peter</HI>'s discourse with their own ungod∣ly practice, that made them cry, <HI>What shall we do to be saved.</HI> Without such a comparison there could have been no ground or reason of compunction: And before they had any ground given them to expect peace and forgiveness of sin, they were or∣dered <HI>to repent.</HI> All this exercise supposes a just enquiry into the truth of what was said, which need∣ed not to have been long, seeing the facts charged upon them were so recent. No immediate impulse was at all necessary, but a Divine concurrence with the ordinary means of salvation. This terror which these converts were brought into, was not the effect of any simple impression, but of the strongest proof and conviction from matter of fact. <HI>Peter</HI> had clearly proved them guilty of the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> and made evident that he was risen again, and in∣vested with all power to judge them, and call them to account; and they had all the reason in the world to believe, that in the condition they were in, they would meet with no favourable verdict.</P>
<P>THE object of the fear of these <HI>Jews,</HI> was real and not imaginary, there was no false picture drawn before the eyes of their conscience, but their cha∣racter was really drawn to the life. But many en∣thusiastical hypocrites have made an improvement of these primitive conversions in favour of their sudden transitions from open prophanity to hidden iniquity, and have formed a false representation of peace to their consciences, when they have never been convinced of sin, nor determined to forsake it. They have pleased themselves with idols of their
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>own framing, and weaved a <HI>Spider</HI>'s web of hypo∣crisy out of their own imagination.</P>
<P>I SHALL now finish this subject, by comprehend∣ing the last doctrinal head and the improve∣ment both in one.</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the preceding observations we may see what an evil thing religious deceit and hypocrisy is. It makes men abominable in the sight of God, and the truest servants of the evil one. Nothing is more offensive to the pure eye of God than this sin of hypocrisy: It is a practical denying of his Omniscience, and a questioning his Divine intelli∣gence. Who that believes that God sees all things, would love to appear in any other character but his real one? Who would hide sin under a cloak of piety, that was persuaded that the Lord would detect him sometimes or other? The hypocrite is a practical atheist, and a secret denier of God. What an evil must hypocrisy be, that makes men act such an irrational part with so much impudence? That religion which is the glory of men, that profession that distinguishes the lovers of God from the world, the hypocrite makes use of to dishonour him: By this he imposes upon men, and often gains a cha∣racter he has no title unto. But this vice is evil when we consider the threatnings denounced a∣gainst it; <HI>The hope of the hypocrite shall perish,</HI> all their vain confidences shall fail them when they need them most, and what they have so long <HI>rolled as a sweet morsel under their tongue,</HI> will prove their poison at last; fearfulness shall seize them, though they may support themselves with false confidence for a while.</P>
<P>HYPOCRITES are <HI>Satan</HI>'s politicians who manage the state of his kingdom here below by the hidden policy of hell. To serve their master they turn themselves into all shapes, and assume all charac∣ters. They intermeddle with all things sacred and
<PB N="280" REF="288"/>prophane to promote their master's interest. The basest of things are not below them, and the high∣est are not above them; <HI>they hatch Cockatrice eggs, and weave the Spider's web,</HI> labour in the dunghill of immorality, and aspire as high as the sublimest parts of religion. Nothing is either too high or too low for them to promote the kingdom of dark∣ness: At the same time they ascend the heights of religious enthusiasm, they debase the human un∣derstanding. No contradiction is so absurd but they will fall into it, and strive to reconcile it: They will attempt to reconcile knowledge and ignorance, light and darkness, and substitute one thing in the room of another however inconsistent; immediate impressions and impulses instead of Divine revela∣tion, and rule their conduct by fancy, and reject Divine truth. Hypocrisy directs men to run into all confusion, to invert all the Divine appointments of the Most High. It will lead them so far as to despise ordinances authenticated by heaven, and follow the inventions of human imposture. It will make those who cannot read attempt to preach; and such as for ever err, exhort others to righteous∣ness. It will cause those who are laden with sins and iniquities profess they have not sinned for many years, and make imperfect mortals affirm they can attain to perfection in this life. Hypocrisy, in a word, can do all things that are bad, but no good things at all. It is the bane of society, and the ruin of every individual who hath it.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is evident from what hath been observed above, that we ought carefully to examine all ap∣pearances before we lay any dependence upon them. It is not every pretence to religion and the Divine favour that will be approved of by the Almighty; nor are all such his friends who say they are so. Many refinements are made upon religion by crafty and designing persons. They have no other de∣sign
<PB N="281" REF="289"/>in all their pretences to piety and good mean∣ing, but to serve their pride, their interest, or party. The kingdom of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> among such, is made a political engine to serve the pride or advantage of those who set up to be master of the ceremonies of each department. When religion itself is not the chief enquiry, and allowed to be the privilege of every individual, these who are best capable to mix religion with human inventions, are ever ready to cry out for its interests, as thereby their own in∣terest is first served: Because gain attends a certain form of godliness, they are zealous for religion for the sake of that gain.</P>
<P>HAD we not great need to examine all appear∣ances when so many strange phaenomena appear. When so many refined webs of hypocrisy are formed by different pretenders to religion and godliness, had not every one need to try every man's pretensions if they are well authenticated or not. In these days of self-righteousness and hypocrisy, many various shapes of religion and opinion pre∣sent themselves, mostly all tending to encrease the pride or interest of the devotee; causing them to hate all others that differ from, or who cannot go the same length with themselves. Some have no more religion than what is contained in this or the other church established by law, and think there is no salvation to any who are not in full communion with some national church; others are dissenters because they cannot get the length to be chief masters of the ceremonies, and are grieved at no∣thing more than that they are dissenters.—They sigh and cry, fast and mourn, because the civil ma∣gistrate will not permit them to cut as many throats as they have sworn to do. For this very reason they envy men the favour of civil protection, and blaspheme against a toleration of religious opinions. And what is worse, they grudge men the favour of
<PB N="282" REF="290"/>the Almighty, because they walk not in their path. They pray for a reviving of religious persecution, and swear to do it when it is in their power; and because Providence has been so kind to mankind as to restrain their power, it is no small degree of mortification to their pride, and no little degree of religious exercise to their souls. What a <HI>hatching of Cockatrice eggs</HI> is this, to envy men the indul∣gence of the civil power to serve God as their con∣science directs them? There can be no medium between want of toleration and persecution. What a vengeance would it be to these realms if such hy∣pocrites had their desires. My brethren and fel∣low christians, let us try every man's pretensions by the Law and the Testimony, and judge for our∣selves, whether they speak according unto it. Let us consider our liberty, and never be entangled in the <HI>Spider</HI>'s web of ecclesiastical tyranny, whether ingrafted upon the civil constitution, or assumed by Reverend religious gentlemen to keep the poor vulgar in subjection. Tyranny and imposition of all kinds is the same; and if once we give up the right of private judgement, it is of no great consequence to whom we give ourselves up to be led in religious matters. When there are so many schemes of self-seeking and religious webs of deceit passing current in the age, is it not every one's duty, for his own preser∣vation, <HI>to enquire after the good old way, that he may find rest to his soul.</HI> Men who find their account in your ignorance and simplicity, will claim an ex∣clusive privilege to judge in some matters of chris∣tianity; but believe them not, suffer not yourselves to be brought under the power of any. If any number of men whatever, of whatever order, how∣ever reverend and learned, claim a power of dicta∣ting to you in any particular, or want to take so much trouble off your hand as to compose your creed for you; say to such, <HI>take heed to yourselves.</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="291"/>Receive no lords but <HI>Christ:</HI> No creeds but the Scriptures.</P>
<P>THERE is great need of enquiry, when there are so many pretenders, and all of them pretend∣ing to high degrees of purity and good-meaning: Claiming the Scripture for their foundation, and the rule of their direction in all their extravagan∣ces. Meetings of holy Fathers, and Reverend brethren when assembled, have been at the pains to dictate to us (as they pretend) out of the Scrip∣tures, how much we should believe; and are ever very angry when the common people are disposed to differ from them, and judge for themselves. Such as have given themselves to their direction are in abject slavery as to matters of conscience; and these ghostly guides strive to maint<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in their own importance, merely because they find their account in their superiority. But consider, my friends, that an Apostle did not aim so high; we are not, says he, <HI>Lords of your faith, but helpers of your joy.</HI> The Apostles of <HI>Christ</HI> could demean them∣selves, so as to think and act with the meanest vul∣gar. They assumed no airs of importance nor su∣periority over the flock of <HI>Christ,</HI> but in <HI>meekness and lowliness,</HI> like their Lord and Master, <HI>were ex∣amples of true humility.</HI> Where they used any au∣thority, they did it by the immediate direction of the Holy Spirit, with which they were inspired, which was promised unto, and peculiar to them as Apostles. They subjected their doctrine and con∣versation to the examination of all, and exhorted their followers <HI>to try all things, and hold that which was best.</HI> They never assumed a power distinct from the whole Church, to judge exclusively of ei∣ther doctrines or morals; and even though they were inspired Apostles, they took in the common
<PB N="284" REF="292"/>people along with them in matters of judgment. <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>MANY of you have been educated in a nation where religious subjection to clergy men is account∣ed of Divine right; and where those who are cho∣sen to be publick servants, pretend to have right from the Deity to be masters and lords of men's consciences.—But enquire and see if they have any just claim to their pretensions, and study to be satisfied in your own minds about what is truth before you acquiesce in any man's opinion.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE are taught from the preceding dis∣course, that religious deceit is very subtile, and not easily perceived, and on that account more dan∣gerous to the souls of men. Our Prophet paints it in such colours that shew its subtilty: <HI>They weave the spider's web, they hatch cockatrice eggs.</HI> Though some may have other designs than religion in pro∣pagating deceit; yet many may be deceived with∣out meaning any deception to themselves or others. Hypocrisy and deceit may involuntarily at first gain a room in their imagination, and at last be∣come an actual habit. Piety and good-meaning insensibly steal in upon the unwary; and for want of real principle, issues in deceit and religious hy∣pocrisy. Sins of every kind are subtile, little per∣ceived at first, but not easily got clear off; like poi∣son, it diffuseth itself through all the powers of the human understanding: It blinds the mind, hardens the heart, and stupifies the conscience. And when vice is cloathed in the habit and colour of religion, it most easily takes with the unwary: They see the bait, but not what is concealed under it.—When men are once deceived themselves, they often strive to make proselites to deception, and in process of time become down-right hypocrites. This may be accounted one reason why ever politicks mixed with, or supplanted religion. Men at first, by de∣ceit
<PB N="285" REF="293"/>of others, were led into double dealing, from a pretence of serving the interests of Godliness, and thought it very innocent to use guile to catch men to their party. By this means they attacked the Devil with his own weapons, but not being so dex∣terous at it as him, he overcame them, and made them proselites to his own cause and interest.—And thus by accustoming themselves to hypocriti∣cal refinements, it became constitutional for them to be hypocrites. By this means it came to pass, that every system of reputable religion was found∣ed in deceit, as being grounded in human policy, and regulated by the cunning of such as had some end to serve with it.</P>
<P>HYPOCRISY by degrees was formed into a sys∣tem, and called by the name of needful policy; and though every party cried out against one ano∣ther for deceit and religious refinement, yet they used it in their turn for their own interest. It was because men had not truth at heart, that each pre∣vailing persuasion guarded their system with canons, creeds, and confessions of faith. Conscious of their own bad intentions, they were jealous of all others; and because they wanted charity, <HI>they thought evil.</HI> So far did this religious deceit prevail, that men who understood the advantage of human policy in the kingdoms of this world, began to model the kingdom of <HI>Christ</HI> after the same fashion; and when men in power saw meet to be religious, they formed a glorious, political, religious constitution, and called it by the pompous name of, a NA∣TIONAL CHURCH.</P>
<P>THIS political kingdom, which they called <HI>The Church of Christ,</HI> was, and is managed the same way as the kingdoms of this world, and places of distinction in it, are disposed of, according to the in∣terests and pleasure of such as preside over its po∣liticks. By this means men became at last hypo∣crites
<PB N="286" REF="294"/>by law, and with a good grace could deceit∣fully refine upon christianity, because they had the scribes and pharisees of the <HI>National Religion</HI> to keep them in countenance. If at any time some flying parties broke off from the body politic, be∣cause they were not received into their deceitful councils, and set up for themselves, they carried along with them the same spirit, and formed their <HI>New Monarchy</HI> as like the old one as possibly they could; only for want of a king they called it a <HI>Re∣publick,</HI> and cried out for liberty of conscience.—But men would much mistake their meaning, if they understood them as speaking as they thought; for their liberty had no other signification, but as it respected themselves; for to all others they were as ready to act the tyrant, as ever those of whom they complained. And whenever they got their policy settled according to their mind, it was always ingrafted upon tyranny: For all these little re∣ligious republics, had laws as opposite to Christian Liberty as the great Empire they had deserted. All their rules of policy abridged the rights of pri∣vate judgment, and they would give men to the Devil for using it. When this deceit came to any great height, they served the laws of their party up the length of persecution; and if a man saw meet to think for himself, they would stile him an <HI>He∣retick,</HI> and deliver him over to <HI>Satan</HI> in order to <HI>save his soul.</HI></P>
<P>So subtile is this religious deceit, that it hath diffused itself through all religious parties, so that it is not safe for any one man to trust another. He who will inform you of his religious experience, and his intercourse with heaven, will also blast your character, and ruin your interest if he can. These same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips that utter mysteries, and blab forth de∣votion when their heart sees meet to allow them, will also utter slanders, and devoutly play the devil.</P>
<PB N="287" REF="295"/>
<P>MICAH's advice is become most necessary, <HI>Trust not in a friend, put no confidence in a guide: for every friend will deceive, and every brother will sup∣plant.</HI> Such a strange subtilty there is in this in∣iquity, that it kills when it seems to please; makes men commend with a design to gain credit, that they may have it in their power to ruin you at their pleasure. It works by flattery, insinuation and guile; and those who are best skilled in the arts of religious deceit, when they kiss <HI>they stab at the fifth rib.</HI> All their commendations of such as are not of their party, carry oblique strokes of calumny in their bosom. This evil principle directs them to express pity and compassion for others, when no∣thing delights them more than their errors and mis∣fortunes. Such weavers of <HI>Spiders webs</HI> of hypo∣crisy, will bemoan your misery to appearance, when nothing elates their pride higher than your unhap∣piness. Moreover, so subtile is this poison, that it will even make men pray for those they bear no good-will to; and address heaven for their happi∣ness, when it is far from their heart to desire it. In a word, it hath disseminated itself through all the powers of the human understanding, and through all parties and societies of men.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> LET US consider what may be the best antidote against religious deception and imposition. Pride certainly is the spring of it, and humility and self-denial will be the best remedy. Let us then study to be humble, and not to think of ourselves above what we are: He that is puft up <HI>falleth into the snare of the Devil.</HI> It is pride and self-conceit which hath led men into all these religious decep∣tions. To advance their name, their interest, or character in the world, men through pride have fre∣quently used very indirect and preposterous me∣thods. When pride cannot make its way to pre∣ferment
<PB N="288" REF="296"/>at first instance honourably, it will endea∣vour it by the hidden means of dishonesty and de∣ceit. Nothing is more agreeable to most men, in a country where religion is in repute, than to be e∣minent in the outward parts of it. Pride loves to be seen of men: And when there are many others standing in their way to cloud their eminence, their pride disposeth them to remove them by po∣licy and cunning. But the humble person has no rivals to distress him: At all times the <HI>testimony of a good conscience</HI> satisfies him, and other men's emi∣nence gives him pleasure, but not pain. Being denied to the honours and pleasures of this world, he is easy who share them among them, for he knows they are not fit for him. His chief care is over himself, and how to bear that cross his Savi∣our hath commanded him to take up. The just∣ling of religious parties for honour and preferment gives him no uneasiness, because his mind is averse to them, and he expects no preferment till <HI>the re∣surrection of the just,</HI> when he shall be <HI>openly acknow∣ledged</HI> in the day of judgment, and completely re∣ceive his due reward which his Lord hath promised him. Humility makes men pass through life, with∣out any desire to be seen of others; and when con∣tending parties are striving to raise their heads a∣bove one another, the humble soul retires from the bustle, and enjoys himself in retirement and medi∣tation. Or if in Providence he be called to busi∣ness, and to act a part for the publick weal, he en∣deavours to do his business without oftentation, and serves the publick without accounting himself important. The plaudite of publick applause doth not stir up his vanity, nor doth their slander oppress him. Unmoved with praise, he is humble; un∣shaken with reproach, he is steady and faithful. When the sons of self-righteousness and religious
<PB N="289" REF="297"/>deceit are striving who shall gain the highest ap∣probation for religion and virtue from the publick, he retires peaceable with this reflection, <HI>I am less than the least of all saints.</HI> Humility has no opi∣nion of publick applause, it neither values nor courts it, but looks down upon it, and despiseth it. A humble person wants not indeed to procure any man's displeasure by evil deeds, but would strive to do good to all: But when he hath done all the good in his power, he craves no respect for it, nor makes any merit of it; he still accounts himself <HI>but an unprofitable servant, having only done what was his duty to do.</HI></P>
<P>HUMILITY preserves men both from the heights of enthusiasm, and the unwarrantable paths of superstition. The humble person wants not to be thought the favourite of the Deity, but to be so; and has no intention to trust to <HI>beggarly elements,</HI> but seeks after <HI>pure and undefiled religion.</HI> His <HI>zeal is according to knowledge,</HI> and moderate by discre∣tion; and his devotion consists of the exercise of the heart, and not in the pageantry of ceremonies, and the dregs of will-worship. Let us strive to be humble, and we shall never be deceitful: If once we have our pride in subjection, we shall not be anxious what be the opinon of the world concern∣ing us. Let us be denied to all the glories and honours of this deceitful world, and none of these deceits which ruin the souls and bodies of men shall ever hurt us. Let such whom it may con∣cern, set up to be the directors and leaders in the National Religion in any country, or the masters of the ceremonies of this or the other petty So∣ciety: Let us submit-to Providence, and serve God <HI>in truth and sincerity.</HI> Let us keep by the primitive example of <HI>Christ</HI> and his Apostles, and <HI>in all meekness and humility have our conversation in
<PB N="290" REF="298"/>the world.</HI> Let all the various societies of religi∣ous devotees to hypocrisy, seek their own impor∣tance, and <HI>weave a Spider's web</HI> of deceit as long as they will: <HI>Let us deny ourselves, and take up our cross daily, and follow Jesus Christ.</HI> Let us say sin∣cerely, <HI>Surely in the Lord alone have we righteousness and strength.</HI></P>
