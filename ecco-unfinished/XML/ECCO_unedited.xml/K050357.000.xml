<HEAD>THE Succession TO THE Crown of England, <HI>Considered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was Remarkable, That the Very Day the <HI>Peace</HI> was Proclaim'd in <HI>London,</HI> the Moon was in a Total Eclipse, which hap∣pened to be extreamly Visible, just as we were making Bonefires for Joy.</P>
<P>I am no Dreamer of Dreams, nor the Son of a Prophet; but I cou'd not avoid hav∣ing some little Concern at the Sight, it seem'd so Directly to tell us, <HI>That our Peace would have some unexpected Eclipse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Since the Succession of a <HI>French-man</HI> to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, has given us further Cause to expect an Eclipse upon our Peace Abroad, it were to be wisht that our Peace at Home therefore were a little better secured.</P>
<P>The Death of the Duke of <HI>Gloucester</HI> was the first Blow which seem'd particularly to affect the <HI>English,</HI> after the Conclusion of the Peace, which may very justly be accounted a Misfortune to the Nation, 1. By putting us to the trouble of looking about the World for a Successor, 2. By giving Pretensions of Right to such People as our Constitution barrs from possessing the Crown. And 3<HI>dly,</HI> By giving the <HI>Scots</HI> Opportunity again to Choose whether they will join in a Settle∣ment with Us or no.</P>
<P>Since then the Succession of Crowns, and Revolutions of Kingdoms are so much the general Subjects of Discourse at this time, 'tis thought it may not be altogether Impro∣per, at least for <HI>Englishmen,</HI> to suspend a lit∣tle their Concern for the Events of Foreign Affairs, and cast their Eyes upon their Own.</P>
<P>The League of Partition; the late King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Will; the accepting that Will by the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
King of <HI>France,</HI> in favour of the Duke <HI>d'An∣jou;</HI> the Emperor declaring in Right of the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles;</HI> the Letters from and to <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Paris;</HI> the Memorial of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador at the <HI>Hague;</HI> the Process of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Envoy at <HI>Madrid;</HI> the Entry of the <HI>French</HI> Troops into <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Milan,</HI> and the like, <HI>are Matters which take up the Thoughts, and Employ the Heads of our Po∣liticians, who fill us with their Observations and Speculations relating to the</HI> Spanish <HI>Suc∣cession.</HI></P>
<P>But these things, however Material in themselves, and Eventually of Concern to us, Ought not <HI>so to Divert us,</HI> as that we shou▪d forget the proper Juncture which seems to be at hand, in which an Article will come before us, the Debate whereof is infi∣nitely of more Consequence than all these, to us in Particular, if not to <HI>Europe</HI> in General, and that is, <HI>The Succession of the Crown of</HI> Eng∣land.</P>
<P>The Settlement of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> made by Parliament on the Abdication of the late King, seems to require some further Consideration: Fate has made Two Melan∣choly Infractions in the Prospect we had of
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
a Race of Kings from the Line of the pre∣sent Establishment, by the Death of the late Queen, and the Duke of <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis Evident that if the Princess <HI>Ann</HI> has no more Children, and His Majesty shou'd continue to decline Marrying, <HI>both which are but too probable,</HI> the Settlement of the Crown as made by Consent of Parliament is at a full Stop, and it remains, That the same Autho∣rity of Parliament shou'd Consider whose Right it is to Succeed.</P>
<P>I do not think fit to Decide here, Whe∣ther the Power of Making and Declaring Kings and Successions, be Vested in the Body of the People Collectively or Representative∣ly. <HI>Originally,</HI> I think, there is no body ever disputed it, but 'tis immaterial in this Case, because it has been Debated and Decided; <HI>the Parliament have asserted their Right in its Practice and Extent,</HI> and the present Consti∣tution of <HI>England</HI> stands firm upon the Basis of that Right.</P>
<P>Nor shall I inquire, much less Dictate what the Representatives of <HI>England</HI> assembl'd in Parliament may or may not think sit to do in the Matter of our Succession, but shall go on to Examine who they are, who, on the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Expiration of the present Settlement, may put in their Claims to the Succession of the Crown, and in what particular Circumstan∣ces of Right such Claimant may now stand, respecting both the Constitution and Interest of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> finished the Line of our <HI>English Saxon</HI> Kings; the Blood of the <HI>Plantagenets</HI> and <HI>Tudors</HI> were Extinct in all the Branches of them, excepting the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who being Grandmother to <HI>James</HI> the VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Crown of <HI>England</HI> Devolv'd upon the Fa∣mily of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> in Right of that Match, and so he was Proclaimed King of <HI>England,</HI> by the Name of <HI>King James the First.</HI></P>
<P>This King had by Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the following Offspring which 'tis necessary to mention, because we shall meet with them again in the farther Prosecution of this Discourse.</P>
<P>He had Two Sons, <HI>Henry,</HI> who died unmarried:</P>
<P>And <HI>Charles,</HI> who Succeeded him in the Throne.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
And, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Married to the <HI>Palsgrave,</HI> af∣terwards King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> but Beaten out of both by the Emperor.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> left Three Sons, <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> who being re-instated in the Inheritance of his Father, was Elector <HI>Pala∣tine,</HI> and <HI>Palsgrave,</HI> and whose Posterity we shall meet with again; <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Rupert,</HI> who died without Issue.</P>
<P>And besides younger Daughters, one Daughter <HI>Sophia,</HI> Married to <HI>Ernest Augustus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by whom she had the pre∣sent Duke Elector of <HI>Brumswick,</HI> with Two Sons and one Daughter married to the present Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> which Duke of <HI>Hanno∣ver</HI> must stand fair to Claim whatever De∣volves upon that Branch by the right of a Marriage from a Daughter of <HI>England,</HI> in Case the Male-Line of King <HI>James</HI> the First should fail, which we come n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt to consi∣der.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the First, the Son▪ of King <HI>James,</HI> left these Children:</P>
<P><HI>Charles,</HI> the Eldest, who Reigned after him.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> the Second, who also Reigned after him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> who died un∣married.</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> Married to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Mother to His Present Majesty.</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who died unmarried.</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>Henrietta,</HI> married to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> by whom she had <HI>Anna Maria</HI> married to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> by whom she has had one Daughter, now the Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and since that One Son, Prince of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> and another Daughter, who with their Mother are all living. Of these in their Order.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Second, left no Legitimate Is∣sue, except One Son, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> whose Birth happening in the Time of his Father's Exile, it remained a Doubt whether he was Legitimate or no; and some People have affirm'd the <HI>Contract of Marriage with his Mother,</HI> was reserv'd, and had been produced to an <HI>English</HI> Parliament, if the <HI>Bill of Exclusion</HI> had not sunk in the <HI>Embrio,</HI> whereby all those Designs proving Abortive, the Witnesses perished in the <HI>General Destru∣ction</HI> of his Party, which from that time to the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. were Banished, drawn into Plots, and died by the <HI>Ax</HI> or <HI>Halter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
After the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> in Arms, and published a <HI>Declaration,</HI> not so much found∣ed on his <HI>Right by Birth,</HI> as upon the <HI>Male∣administration</HI> of King <HI>James,</HI> but withal re∣ferring the <HI>Examination of his own Legitimacy to a Free Parliament,</HI> but he lost the <HI>Day</HI> and his <HI>Life;</HI> and so the Legitimacy of his Birth remains <HI>undiscovered</HI> to this day, and he stands <HI>attainted in blood</HI> by Parliament, as an <HI>effectual Bar</HI> against any Claim in his Posterity.</P>
<P>Besides this, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. publickly disown'd him as Legitimate, and declared <HI>he was not married to his Mother;</HI> but still had there been any Authentick Proof of the Affir∣mative, I presume that <HI>Declaration</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> had been of small Value, especially if the Fight at <HI>Sedgmore</HI> had favour'd him with Power to have backt that <HI>Affirmative</HI> with the <HI>longest Sword;</HI> for Victory, which <HI>gives Crowns,</HI> takes off <HI>Attainders,</HI> and makes any body Le∣gitimate.</P>
<P>To King <HI>Charles</HI> succeeded <HI>James</HI> the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> by whose Abdication the Crown is Devolved on King <HI>William,</HI> and Settled by
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Parliament on the Princess <HI>Ann</HI> and her Chil∣dren, and on Default of such Issue, to the Heirs of His present Majesty.</P>
<P>Now neither His Majesty nor the Princess having any Children, it remains to examine who are the <HI>Pretenders</HI> to the <HI>Succession.</HI></P>
<P>I shall first Rank all the <HI>Pretenders to the Blood Royal of</HI> England which are now in be∣ing, and Consider their Pretensions after∣wards.</P>
<P>I shall not call Her <HI>Royal Highness</HI> the Prin∣cess <HI>Ann</HI> a Pretender, because She is <HI>Heir Ap∣parent, Included and Declared in the present Act of Settlement.</HI> Nor shall I go back to her Fa∣ther, who stands Excluded <HI>by his own Act and Deed,</HI> and the Case already Decided by Par∣liament: For as I shall not pretend to que∣stion <HI>Acts of Parliament and Settlements made by the Commons of</HI> England; so I shall not so much as suggest, that what they have done needs my weak Pen to Vindicate or De∣fend.</P>
<P>But waving those Two Articles, I proceed to Name the present Claimants in Being, whose <HI>Legitimacy is indisputable,</HI> and whose Titles are just and undeniable, so fat as
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> gives a Title to the <HI>English</HI> Crown.</P>
<P>The First and Immediate Heir, as I take it, is,</P>
<P><HI>Anna Maria,</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Daugh∣ter to the present Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> by <HI>Henrietta,</HI> Eldest Daughter to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, being without doubt the Nearest of Kin to the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as standing in the same Degree by the Female Line, as the Princess <HI>Ann</HI> by the Male.</P>
<P>From this Lady the Title Descends to her Son.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>...... Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI> and his Heirs, or to,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Mary</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> born in 1685.</ITEM>
<ITEM>...... Princess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> born in 1688.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>On Failure of this Line, the Crown De∣volves to the Posterity of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Daughter to King <HI>James</HI> the First, whose Son <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> lest One Daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Charlotte Elizabeth,</HI> now Dutchess of <HI>Orle∣ans,</HI> and Heir to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> in Right of the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> aforesaid.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
This Lady is still living, and lras Two Children.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Char<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res,</HI> And</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Charlotte,</HI> lately Married to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI></P>
<P>After the Dutchess of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and her Fa∣mily, the Princess of <HI>Conde</HI> Claims a Right of Succession to the <HI>English</HI> Crown, being Daugh∣ter to <HI>Edward</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> Grand-Daugh∣ter to the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or Great Grand-Child to King <HI>James</HI> the First.</P>
<P>Her Posterity are as follows,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> Married to one of the <HI>French</HI> King's Natural Daughters.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Maria Theresia Madamoiselle de Bourbon</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mary Ann Madamoiselle de Monmorancy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Anna Maria Victoria Madamoiselle d'Enguien.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After this Family, the Sister of this Prin∣cess Claims a Title, she is Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and has Three Daughters, the Dutchess of <HI>Mantua,</HI> the Dutchess of <HI>Modena,</HI> and the youngest Married lately to the King of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far goes the Male-Line of the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and all these <HI>Claimants</HI> are <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
The Next in Course, and the First <HI>Prote∣stant Heir,</HI> is that Excellent Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> before mentioned, Dutchess and Electoress Dowager of <HI>Hannover,</HI> Grand-Daughter to King <HI>James</HI> the First, and who is still living, Sister to the late Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the on∣ly surviving Child of the Queen of <HI>Bohe∣mia.</HI></P>
<P>Her Children are:

<ITEM>Frederick William, <HI>Prince of</HI> Bran∣denburg.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These are the Visible and Indisputable Heirs to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>England:</HI> There are Two other Pretenders, whose <HI>Legitimacy</HI> being Question'd, I have reserv'd to set down by themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
The Posterity of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. by <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> which are</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Dalkeith</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and after his Mother Duke of <HI>Buclugh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry Scot,</HI> without Title.</P>
<P>And, One Daughter.</P>
<P>And the Posterity of K. <HI>James</HI> II. <HI>viz.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> And <HI>Sophia Madamoiselle d' Angleterre.</HI></P>
<P>I should pass by the whole Line of <HI>Orleans</HI> with this Observation, <HI>That they stand Exclud∣ed on the account of Religion by the Fundamen∣tal Constitution of</HI> England <HI>declar'd in Parlia∣ment;</HI> but that we have several Suggestions made by some People, who wish no very great Good to our present Settlement, on the Head of this Article.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> They tell us, That if the Dutchess of <HI>Savoy</HI> shall make an Offer of sending hi∣ther her Son the Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI> to be brought up in the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> we can∣not deny him the <HI>Succession,</HI> he being Grand∣son to a Daughter of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They tell us, That the King of <HI>France,</HI> upon the Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI>'s quitting
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
his Pretensions, or dying without Issue, may Claim in Right of the Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> Daughter to the Dutchess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who is without Question the next Heir▪ And tho' by <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> we have thought fit to Exclude them, because <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> it may be a good reason to us to oppose her, but it can be no good reason against her putting in her Claim, and the Sword, say they, must decide it.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>These are Two <HI>Points</HI> which require some <HI>Consideration.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As to the Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI>'s being brought over hither to be educated a <HI>Prote∣stant:</HI> I make no Question but the Prince of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> after his Mother the Dutchess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> is the Next Heir to the <HI>English</HI> Crown, and, saving to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> the Right of <HI>disposing the English Government</HI> so, and to such Hands as they have either Power or just Reason to do if the Present Establishment was Extin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, I know nothing cou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said in Bar of his Title but his <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, I must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> farther, and say, That even the Prince who▪ shall Claim being a <HI>Papist</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Pro∣fest, does not <HI>weaken his Claim of Right,</HI> it only Bars the Door against him, that he can∣not get at it. The Act of Parliament <HI>Exclu∣ding a</HI> Roman Catholick <HI>from the</HI> English <HI>Suc∣cession and Crown,</HI> does not lessen that Prince's <HI>Right of Claim,</HI> but it makes it <HI>unlawful</HI> for us to receive him unless he turn <HI>Protestant.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI> is not less an Heir to the <HI>Crown of England</HI> for being a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> but <HI>England</HI> is rendred Foreign to him by the <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> whereby he <HI>stands excluded;</HI> that is, the Nation is arm'd by Law against receiving him; and this is ap∣parent, because that Hour that any such Prince professes himself a <HI>Protestant,</HI> his Right takes place, and that which before was Lawful to do, <HI>viz. to oppose him,</HI> would be then <HI>High Treason.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>It may be ask'd here,</HI> If when your Throne is Vacant you pass by the Right Heir because he is a <HI>Papist,</HI> and proceed to the next who is a <HI>Pro∣testant;</HI> If this Heir afterward turn <HI>Protestant,</HI> is not his Claim then Right, and ought not the Incumbent to relinquish it to him?</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In Descent of Estates such an <HI>Obje∣ction</HI> may be good, but in that of <HI>Crowns</HI> it
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
cannot be, Because the <HI>Crown is entred upon by mutual Stipulation,</HI> and if ye have <HI>Once admit∣ted an Heir into Possession,</HI> and a <HI>Coronation</HI> has past, which is the <HI>Seal of the Contract,</HI> Nothing but <HI>Male-administration, Death</HI> or <HI>Defection</HI> can dissolve the Peoples <HI>Allegiance.</HI></P>
<P>But if such Prince will qualifie himself for the <HI>Crown,</HI> and turn <HI>Protestant,</HI> he must do it in Time, and before the <HI>Right of Devolution</HI> fall. For <HI>Crowns</HI> are not to be <HI>transpos'd,</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms change Masters</HI> as often as Princes please to change their <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>If then the Dutchess of <HI>Savoy</HI> is willing to breed her Son up in the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> in Order to qualifie him to enjoy the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the Way is, in my poor Opinion, first to send him into <HI>England,</HI> and commit him to such <HI>Governours as the Nation may be very well satisfied in,</HI> such as are Eminently Pious, Zealous, <HI>unbiast</HI> and <HI>disinterested;</HI> if the <HI>Government will appoint them</HI> 'twill be so much the better; and, when this is first done, an Ambassador may apply himself <HI>to the King and Parliament</HI> with some Ground, but to Treat of it as at the present Distance, seems too Re∣mote for us to Concern our selves about it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
As to the Claim of the <HI>French</HI> King in <HI>Right</HI> of the Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> it must be Founded thus:</P>
<P><HI>Either that the Prince of</HI> Piedmont <HI>may re∣linquish his Right to his Sister, or that the</HI> French <HI>King may be brought in speaking thus to the Prince of</HI> Piedmont, Your Highness has a Right to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> if you will Claim it well and good, if not, it goes to your Sister, who is with us, and if you refuse, she shall Claim it.</P>
<P>'Tis Confest, That in either of these Ca∣ses the <HI>French</HI> will have a Colour of Claim; for as I have Noted already, tho' by our own <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Deeds,</HI> (for every <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> is the <HI>Act and Deed of the People;)</HI> Tho, I say, by our own Act and Deed we may agree among our Selves, <HI>that Persons so qualified shall Not Reign over us,</HI> yet, speaking of <HI>Here∣ditary Right,</HI> a <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Prince cannot have the <HI>less Right</HI> by Birth than he had be∣fore; the Dutchess of <HI>Savoy</HI> is not less the Grand-Daughter of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First for being a <HI>Papist,</HI> than she was before; Nor is she less an Heir to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> than she was <HI>before;</HI> Only the <HI>People of England</HI> have resolv'd, That be it her <HI>Right</HI> or not her
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<HI>Right</HI> as to Birth, she shall not possess, unless she turn <HI>Protestant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I might Examine here,</HI> Whether a Right by Birth has so much in it, that it cannot be in the Peoples power to reject it, or whether it be in the People to stipulate with their Princes on what Conditions they shall ascend the Throne? <HI>But this Dispute is so often Decided by the Pra∣ctice of all Nations, that 'twould be suppos'd I only wanted something to say, if I should enter upon it here.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' we have some who are very fond of calling our Government an <HI>Elective Monar∣chy,</HI> yet they cannot give us one Instance in all the last <HI>Settlement,</HI> wherein the <HI>Parliament,</HI> whatever Right they have to <HI>alter</HI> it, have not kept close to the <HI>Right of Descent,</HI> and fol∣lowed the Right Line, unless they will sup∣pose that the <HI>Administration</HI> remaining in King <HI>William</HI> during his Life, be an Infraction into the <HI>Line of Succession,</HI> which if the Doctrine of the <HI>Abdication</HI> be true, would be hard to make out.</P>
<P>But I shall not <HI>Concern</HI> my self, Whether our <HI>Succession</HI> shall be guided by <HI>Descent</HI> or <HI>Choice of the People:</HI> Only I shall suppose, if the Hereditary Descent of the <HI>Crown</HI> be observ'd,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
who the Persons are to whom it so Descends, and if not, out of what Families we may di∣rect the Choice of an Heir, so as that the <HI>Right of Descent,</HI> and the <HI>Right of Election</HI> may go hand in hand, and kiss each other.</P>
<P>As to the Right of those Princes who are <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and by our Laws are <HI>Barr'd</HI> from inheriting the <HI>Crown,</HI> let them think their Right as good as before, our Business is to <HI>stand by, and defend our Constitution;</HI> and tho' the Power of <HI>France</HI> may be concern'd in the Claim, we must do as well as we can; and when we find we cannot Defend our selves against them, 'tis time then to make as good Terms as we can.</P>
<P>Under this Head therefore, I mean, <HI>of Re∣ligion,</HI> all the Princes of the House of <HI>Savoy, Orleans</HI> and <HI>Conde,</HI> with their Numerous Off∣spring, stand Excluded from our <HI>Succession,</HI> and rendred <HI>uncapable of the Government.</HI></P>
<P>The House of <HI>Hannover</HI> therefore, is the <HI>only Line</HI> which with an undisputed Right of <HI>Descent</HI> stands fair to Claim the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and the present Elector of <HI>Hannover,</HI> being the Eldest Son of the Lady <HI>Sophia,</HI> be∣fore named, and Great Grandson to <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<HI>the</HI> First, King of <HI>England,</HI> is without doubt the Next Heir of the <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>But since those Gentlemen, who are so fond of the <HI>Electiveness</HI> of our Kingdom, make it. much their Business to <HI>find fault with Foreig∣ners,</HI> only because they are so, as if no Man were fit to Govern the <HI>English</HI> Nation, but what was Born here; I cannot but <HI>Consider one thing,</HI> in answer to that, in order to satis∣fie those People, and that is, that in Case the Settlement of the <HI>Crown of England</HI> shou'd be Declar'd by <HI>Parliament</HI> in Favour of any of the Princes of the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> that Prince may be invited over to Reside among us, to Inform himself of our Customs, Laws and Way of Living, to be acquainted with. <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things,</HI> to see the <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Ge∣nius of the Nation,</HI> and to be fully instructed in the <HI>Nature of our Constitution,</HI> and the In∣terests of the Nation as to <HI>Trade</HI> abroad and at home, that by his Presence he may become familiar to the People, and be beloved by them.</P>
<P>A Prince Born and Educated abroad must certainly be very much at a Loss when he comes to Govern a People, whose <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Customs, Tempers</HI> and <HI>Persons</HI> he is unacquaint∣ed with.</P>

It is not an <HI>easie matter</HI> for a Prince, with all the advantages of <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Education</HI> a∣mong us, to accommodate himself to the <HI>Go∣vernment of this Great People,</HI> and he that shall come from Abroad, will have <HI>innumerable dis∣advantages</HI> in the Nice Articles of <HI>Govern∣ment.</HI> He will be more liable to <HI>Mistakes</HI> and <HI>False Steps</HI> in the Choice of his Counsellors, for want of the <HI>knowledge of Men;</HI> and in the Choice of his Measures, for want of the <HI>know∣ledge of Things,</HI> more liable to Mistake him∣self, and above all, <HI>much more liable to be Mistaken by us;</HI> for the Natural ill Humour of the Nation with respect to Foreigners, will Magnifie every thing to his <HI>Disadvantage.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> are a <HI>Jealous Nation,</HI> particu∣larly as to the <HI>Encroachments of their Princes upon their Liberties.</HI> 'Tis true, they are to be Excus'd in some Measure, from the Danger of Ruine they have more than Once been in upon that account; but this will be allow'd to make them not altogether so Easie to their Princes, as otherwise they might have been; and let the Person who shall succeed, be Ow∣ner of Never so much <HI>Candour</HI> and <HI>Honesty,</HI> he will have Need of all the <HI>first</HI> to oblige them, and all the <HI>last</HI> to <HI>preserve himself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
His Present Majesty was the best acquaint∣ed with our <HI>Constitution, Laws, Temper,</HI> and whatever was <HI>Needful</HI> to qualifie him <HI>for the Government of this Nation,</HI> of any Prince in the World that had lived all his time abroad; and yet, I doubt not but His Majesty has experienced some <HI>Disadvantages</HI> he receives, as to <HI>Immediate management of Affairs,</HI> for want of a more compleat Personal Knowledge both of <HI>Things</HI> and <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Knowledge of Men</HI> is one of the most useful things to a Prince; for how else shall he judge in the Trust he is to place; and how often such are betray'd who are forced to choose their Confidents and Counsellors by <HI>other mens Characters,</HI> and not their own know∣ledge, we need but look a little way back to see.</P>
<P>'Tis not a small Concern which Princes have in the Choice of their <HI>Counsellors</HI> and <HI>Fa∣vourites;</HI> for if they are ill serv'd by them, tho' the Law look on the <HI>Instrument,</HI> and pu∣nishes the <HI>Person,</HI> clearing the King from all supposition of Blame, yet the mismanagement of Officers and Statesmen is always suppos'd to reflect obliquely upon the <HI>Discretion of the</HI> Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Wherefore 'twill be the real <HI>Interest</HI> of the Prince, whoever he be on whom the New <HI>Settlement</HI> shall fix, if he be a <HI>Foreigner,</HI> unless he be a Regent, a Sovereign in Possession, and so cannot quit his other Affairs, 'twill certainly be his <HI>Interest,</HI> and the <HI>Nations</HI> too, in many Respects, to come and Reside among us.</P>
<P>I might be expected to Descend to the <HI>Right</HI> of the Two Disputed Persons I have mentioned; and tho' 'tis a <HI>tender Point,</HI> yet I shall Venture to say something with relation to the <HI>Point,</HI> which shall be, I hope, <HI>offensive to no body.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was a Person Va∣lued and Beloved by the <HI>English</HI> Nation, at <HI>no indifferent rate.</HI> Since Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> Eld∣est Son to King <HI>James</HI> the First, No Branch of the <HI>Royal Blood</HI> has been so much the <HI>Dar∣ling of the People,</HI> of whom <HI>Dryden</HI> in his <HI>Ab∣salon</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> tho' 'twas a Satyr upon him, was forced to acknowledge:
<Q><L>Of all the Royal Progeny was none,</L>
<L>So Beautiful, so Brave as <HI>Absalon!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>His <HI>Gallantry</HI> Abroad, his <HI>obliging Carriage</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
at Home, and especially his <HI>Love to his Na∣tive Country,</HI> Endear'd him to the <HI>Nation,</HI> and his <HI>Memory</HI> is Valued by them still.</P>
<P>That he Fell at last in the same <HI>laudable Attempt</HI> of <HI>rescuing this Nation from</HI> Popery <HI>and</HI> Tyranny, which His present Majesty perform∣ed afterward with such happy Success, was Owing to God Almighty's inscrutable Provi∣dence: But the Undertaking was no less Glorious, nor the action the less Just, nor the Memory of that Blood, which was offered up as a <HI>Sacrifice for our Liberty,</HI> Ought not to be <HI>less dear</HI> to us than it would have been if it had been Crown'd with the <HI>same Success.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Right of Succession,</HI> and the <HI>Legitimacy of his Birth,</HI> were in his <HI>Declaration</HI> remitted to the <HI>Examination of a Free Parliament,</HI> which <HI>Free Parliament</HI> never having been obtained, and that Brave <HI>English</HI> Gentleman having been Overcome or Betray'd, or whatever it was, No Man has ever had the <HI>Courage</HI> or <HI>Honesty</HI> to ask the Question since, <HI>Whether his Birth was to be proved Legitimate or no?</HI></P>
<P>With a perfect subjecting my <HI>Opinion to an English Parliament,</HI> which God be praised, we now enjoy, I crave leave to say, That it seems to me a <HI>little strange,</HI> That the <HI>Blood of that</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
<HI>Gallant Man</HI> shou'd not leave <HI>Gratitude</HI> enough in <HI>Englishmen</HI> once to think it <HI>worth while at least,</HI> to enquire <HI>Whether he had any legal Right or no?</HI> Whether <HI>the Legitimacy of his Birth could be made out or no?</HI> Or so much as to declare, <HI>That if his Posterity have any Argu∣ment to prove it they shall be heard.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cause in which he died,</HI> has been revi∣ved, The <HI>Liberties</HI> for which he fought, and in the <HI>just Defence</HI> whereof he <HI>Gallantly lost his life,</HI> and so many <HI>Brave Men</HI> with him, are recovered; the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> for which he ventur'd is restored. Nay, the <HI>Blood</HI> of some of his <HI>Adherents</HI> and <HI>Familiars</HI> is restored by <HI>Parliament,</HI> and their <HI>Attainder</HI> taken off; And shall we have so much regard to the <HI>Cause,</HI> and have none to the <HI>Captain?</HI> So much <HI>Gratitude</HI> to the Members of that <HI>Army</HI> and none to the <HI>Head?</HI> He has a <HI>Noble Branch</HI> of his <HI>Stock</HI> left, which bears his Name and Image, it can do him no harm, <HI>to examine whether the Title of his Father had any thing in it or no;</HI> if not, the Son is not the worse, and the Nation wou'd shew an <HI>Act of Kindness</HI> as well as <HI>Gratitude,</HI> to the <HI>Immortal Memory</HI> of his <HI>Renowned Father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Here would be an <HI>English King,</HI> born among us, that wou'd Claim an Interest in our <HI>Hearts</HI> as well as <HI>Crown;</HI> a King whose Value wou'd be raised upon <HI>the Foundation of his Father's Merit,</HI> and be <HI>illustrated by his Own.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Phoenix,</HI> rais'd out of the <HI>Ashes of his Father,</HI> who Sacrificed <HI>his Life,</HI> to save the <HI>People</HI> his Son wou'd <HI>govern.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Pretences</HI> of Foreigners, Claims of <HI>Princes,</HI> and the Prospect of a long and bloody War, wou'd <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>vanish.</HI> If an <HI>English Parliament</HI> shou'd examine into the <HI>Arcana</HI>'s of his <HI>Father</HI>'s <HI>Production,</HI> and <HI>find cause to de∣clare him Legitimate,</HI> all the Claims of the House of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Orleans</HI> wou'd be at an end: All the <HI>Melancholy Prospect</HI> of the De∣struction of this Nation wou'd die: If the True <HI>English</HI> Courage and Gallantry of his Father be <HI>Descended with his Blood,</HI> there is no fear but he may come to be <HI>a Glory to the En∣glish Throne,</HI> and be sitly qualified to <HI>Succeed his present Majesty,</HI> both at the Head of <HI>English Armies,</HI> as well as at the Helm of <HI>English Councils.</HI></P>
<P>If not, there can be no Harm done in exa∣mining into the Truth of the Thing, the Ju∣stice of the <HI>Enquiry</HI> is not the less, tho' the
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
<HI>Legitimacy</HI> should not appear. For to search after it discharges the Debt which seems to be due to the <HI>Ashes of his Father,</HI> and who knows what smother'd <HI>Evidences</HI> may revive, if it were incouraged by a <HI>National Autho∣rity.</HI></P>
<P>If it were but Voted, <HI>That whoever could offer any Proof of the Legitimacy of the late Duke of</HI> Monmouth, <HI>shou'd be heard, and a Committee appointed to inquire into it.</HI> This would put an <HI>End</HI> to the <HI>Case,</HI> if <HI>nothing ap∣pear'd, nothing would follow,</HI> and there would be an End of it; we were but where we are, and no body would be the worse.</P>
<P>One thing I believe the <HI>Succession of this Prince</HI> would bring <HI>with it,</HI> vvhich I am afraid no other <HI>Succession</HI> vvill, and that is, it may <HI>preserve the present Ʋnion of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Scots</HI> will join again with us in the further <HI>Settlement of the Crown,</HI> I believe few People expect; those who slight the <HI>Scots</HI> so as to think 'tis not worth while to trouble our selves whether they do or no, indeed lay no stress on this Argument; <HI>Truly nor I much upon their Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>If we can expect the <HI>Scots</HI> will do that <HI>which they are sorry they did before,</HI> then in∣deed.
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<HI>we may suppose they</HI> will follow us, to settle their Crown as we please to do ours.</P>
<P>But if we will allow the <HI>Scots</HI> to think themselves ill used by us <HI>in the matter of Da∣rien,</HI> and some other <HI>Disadvantages of Trade,</HI> we cannot expect they will join in such a <HI>Settlement</HI> as we shall make, without appoint∣ing <HI>Commissioners</HI> to Treat of some <HI>Conditions</HI> which they <HI>want to have us comply with.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What else can the</HI> Scots <HI>mean when they tell us,</HI> They lost the advantage of making good Terms with us in their too hasty passing the last Settlement, and the Time is coming when we shall want them again.</P>
<P>I must confess <HI>French</HI> Councils, and <HI>French</HI> Money may do much with a <HI>Needy Nation</HI> to embroil both them and us in Case of a <HI>New Settlement;</HI> and if they should break off from us, and assert their <HI>Independent Right,</HI> which without doubt is their Due, and set up for themselves, I shall not enter into the long Detail of the <HI>Inconveniences that will follow,</HI> but One I cannot omit, <HI>Viz. That it will oblige us to keep</HI> a standing Force, <HI>always rea∣dy to Desend us against them, to strengthen and fortisie our Borders, and thereby to fall into that</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
<HI>same Inconvenience which we have made such a stir about.</HI></P>
<P>But if the <HI>Legitimacy of a Prince</HI> be clear'd up who <HI>is equally a Native of both Nations,</HI> I know nothing can be a greater Motive, nor can there be any Argument that I know of, from us to them, which can carry so much force in it to ingage that <HI>Implacable Nation</HI> to forget their <HI>Resentments,</HI> and <HI>acquiesce in the same Succession of Government with us.</HI></P>
<P>I do not examine here, Whether we have <HI>affronted</HI> the <HI>Scots,</HI> in declining to Treat of the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> they have pusht for so often; in laying <HI>Additional Duties</HI> on their <HI>Manufacture of Linnen;</HI> and in refusing to Trade with them in their Incroachment or Colony, <HI>call it what you will,</HI> at <HI>Darien.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do I lay so much stress upon the affront∣ing them, <HI>if we have done it,</HI> especially if they were <HI>singly considered,</HI> but if they are to be considered with relation to the <HI>present Circum∣stances</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> more may be said upon that Article than is fit to be <HI>made publick.</HI></P>
<P>I would forbear also giving Offence in this <HI>Article of the Succession</HI> to those whose parti∣cular Province it is, and in whose Hands the
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
right of discussing this great Head of our Fe∣licity is Deposited; and therefore I think it necessary to explain my self.</P>
<P>I do no where enter into the <HI>Merit of the Cause,</HI> however I may be <HI>Convinc'd my self</HI> of the <HI>Legitimacy of the Father,</HI> and the <HI>Right of the Son,</HI> which indeed I never doubted of, <HI>and freely ventured for;</HI> But since in a Nation where Civil Justice is Regnant, <HI>every English Subject has a Right to demand Relief.</HI> If he be <HI>injur'd,</HI> it is but <HI>equal</HI> that <HI>Inquisition</HI> be made into the Claim of a <HI>Person of this Figure,</HI> and that it only be examin'd, <HI>whether he has any such Right or no.</HI> The <HI>bare Enquiry</HI> can do no body any harm, and the Title of other▪ <HI>Pre∣tenders</HI> is not at all lessened by it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>It has been objected to me since I thought of this Affair,</HI> That to start such a thing would be to Expose the Life of the young Gentleman we speak of.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Turkey</HI> such an Argu∣ment might be good, and I should have been very Cautious of Starting the Case, but I have banished the Suggestion on the same ac∣count that <HI>Numa</HI> omitted to make a Law a∣gainst <HI>Parricide</HI> in <HI>Rome, as a Crime too horrid to be nam'd among the Citizens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
<HI>The sum of the matter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this,</HI> That the Le∣gitimacy of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> may be Ex∣amined into, and the Title of his Son consider'd, and such Measures taken thereupon, as to <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> is due, and to our wise <HI>Legislators</HI> shall seem meet.</P>
<P>I will not Dispute, Whether the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> in settling the <HI>Succession</HI> may not have a <HI>Right</HI> to fix it as they <HI>see cause,</HI> and avoid the Lineal Descent of this Family or any other.</P>
<P>But if so, then they have a Power <HI>as well to fix it upon this Head as another, whether the Legitimacy be examined or no:</HI> and the Crown of <HI>England</HI> Naturalizes and Legitimates any Body.</P>
<P>Nay, Herein the Person we speak of, has infinitely the <HI>advantage of all Pretenders;</HI> for if we have any Remembrance of the Blood of his Father, which was pour'd out by the Ene∣mies of the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> in Defence of that <HI>Religion,</HI> and the <HI>English Liberty:</HI> If vve have any Remembrance of the <HI>Bravery</HI> and <HI>Gallantry</HI> of his Person, and how tenderly the
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
Nation lov'd him. If vve have any sense of the <HI>many miserable Families</HI> that perish'd vvith him in the same <HI>Cause,</HI> we cannot <HI>but give way to the Just Claim that Blood makes,</HI> and shew our Gratitude to his Posterity.</P>
<P>I had proceeded here to consider the <HI>Preten∣sions of the pretended Prince of</HI> Wales; and tho' I am prevented very well by a late Argument proving he has no Claim to the <HI>Crown,</HI> tho' he were a <HI>Protestant,</HI> yet I must also say,</P>
<P>That if vve go back to the Right of the late Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and allow him to be <HI>Legitimate,</HI> the Title of the other <HI>falls of course,</HI> and tho' he vvere the True Son of the Late King, and a <HI>Protestant</HI> also, he has no more <HI>Title to the Crown</HI> than the Lord Mayor of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>It may be objected here;</HI> That King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second Publickly Disclaimed the Duke of <HI>Monmouth's</HI> Legiti∣macy.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> So King <HI>James</HI> II publickly as∣serted the <HI>Legitimacy of his Son</HI> And if <HI>One</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
vvas not <HI>believ'd</HI> in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> vvhy should the other in the <HI>Negative?</HI></P>
<P>Besides, 'Tis <HI>well known</HI> under vvhat <HI>Influ∣ences,</HI> and by the <HI>Conduct of what Councils</HI> that Prince acted vvhen he made <HI>that Declaration,</HI> the same <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Councils</HI> that <HI>afterwards</HI> publickly assaulted the <HI>English Liberties,</HI> and then proceeded to attempt the <HI>Subversion of the Protestant Religion:</HI> Both vvhich At∣tempts this Noble Gentleman vigorously appear'd against, and to his Utmost Oppo∣sed, and <HI>thereby disobliged his Father, who was too deeply ingaged in that</HI> Party and De∣sign, and <HI>for them</HI> vvas prevailed upon to <HI>Disclaim,</HI> and consequently <HI>Disinherit</HI> His Son.</P>
<P>So that his <HI>Early Appearing</HI> for the <HI>True</HI> Liberty and Interest of his Country first Cast him into the <HI>Displeasure of his Father,</HI> and <HI>all the Indignities of a provokt and pre∣vailing Party:</HI> And the Just Defence of the same <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Protestant Religi∣on,</HI> against the Encroachments, of a <HI>Popish</HI> King at last Cost him his Life, which join'd to the infinite Sufferings he underwent in
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
his <HI>several Banishments,</HI> his <HI>Flight, Imprison∣ment,</HI> and <HI>last Moments</HI> are more than suffi∣cient, had they been for the <HI>Popish In∣terest,</HI> to have given him the Title of a <HI>Martyr.</HI></P>
<P>Since the late Happy Revolution, Care has been taken to Vindicate the Honour of some <HI>Noble Families</HI> who fell in the same Calamities: The <HI>Sufferings of others</HI> have been Considered, Even to the most <HI>Contemptible Persons</HI> of <HI>F</HI>—and Dr. <HI>O</HI>—. And several of the Remnant of that <HI>little Army</HI> have been <HI>provided for,</HI> and <HI>preferred.</HI> We see those who joined with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> rewarded with <HI>Ho∣nours, Preferments</HI> and <HI>Trusts,</HI> both by Court and Country, and their <HI>early Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> approv'd, so as they have had <HI>Considerable Commands</HI> in our <HI>Protestant Armies:</HI> But what <HI>Gratitude</HI> this Nation has expressed, either to the <HI>Memo∣ry, Blood</HI> or <HI>Posterity</HI> of that <HI>Noble Victim,</HI> I profess my self at a Loss to find out.
