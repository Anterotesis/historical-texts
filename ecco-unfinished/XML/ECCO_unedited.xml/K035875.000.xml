<HEAD>MORE
Short-WAYS
With the DISSENTERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not without just Ground, a Challenge of Peace
was made to the Nation in the Name of the Dissen∣ters,
that the World might know who were the Men,
in spight of her Majesty's frequent Invitation to
<HI>Union,</HI> and the pressing Exhortations she had made from the
Throne for <HI>Peace,</HI> are constantly the Aggressors, on every
occasion Insult their Brethren, and prompt the Nation
to Unite in their Destruction.</P>
<P>Has the Government shown their Resentment at the
Author of <HI>the Shortest Way with the Dissenters,</HI> either it
was for Injuring the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in suggesting
that her Members intended such a thing as the Destructi∣on
of the Dissenters; or else that noble Lord, who told
the Author of his Extraordinary Guilt, wou'd be puzzl'd
to find a Crime in it, and if it was for such a suggestion,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
'tis as hard, since 'tis too plain the Fact is true, and the
Charge just, if any regard is to be given to the Preaching,
the Printing, or the Discourse of the principal Clergy,
and most noted Members of the Church.</P>
<P>From whence then I Inferr that the Author has no∣thing
to ask pardon of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for, but
that he, like a too credulous Fool▪ gave any heed to such
slight and cursory things as <HI>Preaching,</HI> and <HI>Printing</HI> of
Books.</P>
<P>What tho' a Reverend B—op had frequently said we shou'd
never be well in <HI>England,</HI> till all the Dissenters were
serv'd as the <HI>Hug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nots</HI> in <HI>France?</HI> What tho' Es{que} <HI>M</HI>—has
given it under his Hand, that he heartily prays God wou'd
give her Majesty the Grace to put all that was wrote there
in the Book call'd, <HI>the Shortest Way</HI> in Execution? What tho'
Dr. <HI>H</HI>—frequently has Preach'd and Printed too, that the
Dissenters were a Brood of Traytors, and the Spawn of
Rebels, and not fit to live? What tho' the Author of whom
we are now treating has declar'd from the Pulpit, that a
Man can't be a true Son of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but
he must lift up the bloody Flag against the Dissenters;
yet since Printing Books is but a Modern Contrivance
<HI>to get a Penny,</HI> and ought to be prepar'd so as may
best suit the Market, and Sermons are only long
Speeches directed to, and made to please the Auditory,
and consequently suited to their Circumstances and Hu∣mour,
it does not therefore follow, that because they
have Preach'd and Printed these things, they really In∣tended
and Design'd the thing, <HI>no, Good Men,</HI> it was far
from their Thoughts. The Author therefore was most
justly punish'd for his Folly, in believing any thing they
said, and pretending to Alarm the Dissenters for the little
insignificant Performances of the Pulpit, or the Press.</P>
<P>Nor are their cursory Discourses of more weight, the
People are willing to please themselves with Rallying and
Bullying the Dissenters, and make themselves merry
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
with scaring their Wives and Children, by telling them
they deserve to be all Hang'd, Banish'd and Destroy'd;
but to think they are in earnest, and mean as they say,
nothing can be more absur'd, 'tis as Ridiculous as 'tis to
talk with <HI>Houghton</HI> the Apothecary, or <HI>S—ly</HI> the Muster-Master;
'tis like Barking at a Dog, or if an Ass kicks a
Man, kicking him again; 'tis like fighting with a Chim∣ney-Sweeper,
or scolding with a Fish-Woman; 'tis like
any thing that is Ridiculous, and therefore still the Au∣thor
of <HI>the Shortest Way</HI> was punish'd deservedly, for tel∣ling
that Story in Earnest which the Church-men Preach'd,
Printed, and talkt about only in Jest.</P>
<P>But Gentlemen, if what you Preach, Print or Say be
in Earnest, if you would have us believe you, and give
any heed to your Sermons, your Satyrs and Invectives,
if your <HI>Woolf Stript,</HI> your <HI>Associations,</HI> your <HI>Peace and
Union,</HI> be of any weight, then 'tis no Scandal to affirm
that there is a barbarous Design on foot, in, and among
some who call themselves the Members of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> to Extirpate and Destroy the Dissenters, and to
do every thing by them that is Equivalent to what has
been call'd <HI>the Shortest Way,</HI> and consequently that Author
was barbarously Treated.</P>
<P>After all that has been done to dress up the Dissen∣ters
in the Fools Coat, to make all the Town Mock 'em,
and in the Knaves Coat, to make the Town hate them,
let 'em be now blacken'd with Treason, and the World
told they are dangerous to the Church, and to the Go∣vernment,
and so drest up in the Traytor's Coat in order
to set the Mob upon them.</P>
<P>The whole House of Lords are abus'd, and the Bishops
Lampoon'd for not passing a Bill to Ruin them; nay, the
Queen has not scap'd them, for her Majesty's Modera∣tion
is the only present check to their Insolent Behaviour,
for this they tell us, she has left them in the Lurch, and
for that reason the Reverend, but very Drunken Incumbent
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
at <HI>Wickham</HI> left her Majesty out of his Graces after Meat
ever since, and wou'd ha left her out of the Prayers at
Church, but that he was afraid of his <HI>Dioceson.</HI></P>
<P>Here is now a new attempt started, which strikes at
the Root of the Dissenter's Interest, and is an effectual
way to destroy the Succession of them in this Nation,
and that is, to prevent them Educating their Children in
their own Opinions, possibly some may be angry if I
shou'd call this another <HI>Short Way;</HI> but I must take leave
to say, that next to the Methods formerly propos'd in
the Book so call'd, this is doubtless <HI>the Shortest Way with
the Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P>If I shou'd tell the World that there was an Association
form'd among some Gentlemen in the World to have fol∣low'd
the <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> with an Act for disabling all such
Ministers to Preach in <HI>England,</HI> as were not, for the
future, Educated in one of the two Universities of <HI>Ox∣ford</HI>
or <HI>Cambridge.</HI> If I shou'd say that a Mercenary Re∣negado
was hir'd to expose the private Accademies of
the Dissenters, as Nurseries of Rebellious Principles, I
shou'd say nothing but what was in too many Mouths to
remain a secret.</P>
<P>I cou'd easily run a parallel between these Gentlemen's
Proceedings, and those of the present <HI>French</HI> King's, when
he first went the <HI>Shortest Way with the Protestants of</HI> France,
and could tell them that they seem exactly to follow his
blessed Example, <HI>viz.</HI> First to deprive them of all Offices
or Imployments in the State, then to take from them the
Education of their Children, and then to the pulling down
their Churches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so on to Gallows and Gallies;
that this was not the readiest Method, the <HI>Shortest Way,</HI>
I shall never deny, for the Wisdom and Pollicy of that
Prince is unquestionably Great; but that these Gentle∣men
shou'd pretend to these very steps, and yet, at the
same time, be angry to be told they design the rest,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
is Imposing things upon the World too gross to go
down.</P>
<P>Wherefore I cannot but repeat it, that either the de∣sign
is the total Destruction of the Dissenters as a Party,
or their Printing is meer Marketing, their Discourse Banter,
and their Preaching Buffoonry.</P>
<P>For one of them to Treat us with good Words, and say
this is only to secure the Government, and there is no
harm meant the Dissenters that are peaceable, they are
only excluded Preferment; and the other tell us, That
this design of suppressing their Schools does not Affect
the Dissenters, they may serve God according to the Tol∣leration
their own Way, it only prevents Posterity fol∣lowing
their Method; this is such jesting with the Dissen∣ters,
and such a civil way of telling them they are all
Fools, that it can hardly be allow'd to pass without a
a little Satyr upon the Nonsence of it.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Wesly</HI> Author of two Pamphlets, Cal∣culated
to blacken our Education in the Accademies of the
Dissenters, Ingenuously confesses himself Guilty of many
Crimes in his Youth, and is the willinger to Confess 'em,
as he would lay 'em at the Door of the Dissenters and their
Schools, among whom he was Educated, tho', I humbly
conceive, it is no more a Proof of the Immorality of the
Dissenters in their Schools <HI>that he was a little rakish
among them,</HI> or that he found others among them like
himself, than the Hanging five Students of <HI>Cambridge</HI> in
a very short compass of time for Robbing on the High-Way,
shou'd prove that Padding is a Science taught in
that University.</P>
<P>He takes a great deal of pains also to prove, that in
those Accademies were, or are taught Antimonarchical
Principles, the Author of these Sheets happens to be one
that had, what little Education he can pretend to, un∣der
the same Master that Gentleman was Taught by, <HI>viz.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Charles Morton</HI> of <HI>Newington Green,</HI> and I have now
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
by me the Manuscripts of Science the Exercises and Actions
of his School, and, among the rest, those of Politicks in
particular, and I must do that learned Gentleman's memo∣ry
that Justice to affirm, that neither in his System of
Politicks Government and Discipline, or in any other
the Exercises of that School, was there any thing Taught
or Encourag'd, that was Antimonarchical, or Destructive
to the Government, or Constitution of <HI>England;</HI> and
particularly among the Performances of that School, I
find a Declamation relating to the benefit of a single
Person in a Common-Wealth, wherein it is declar'd and
prov'd from History and Reason, that Monarchy is the
best Government, and the best suited to the Nature of
Government, and the Defence of Property; which Dis∣course,
together with the said Manuscripts, System of
Politicks and Government, as Read in that School, and
which are now above 25 Years old, are left at the Pub∣lishers
of this Book for any one to peruse, as a Satisfa∣ction
of the truth of Fact.</P>
<P>Allow then this Gentleman fell into ill Company af∣terward,
allow we had, and still have worse Rakes a∣mong
us than himself, does this prove that our Schools
teach Men thus, and that the Dissenters in general pro∣fess
Principles Destructive of Monarchy.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Friend,</HI> and <HI>Sir William Parkins,</HI> were Hang'd
for Contriving to Assassinate the late King <HI>William,</HI> and
these Gentlemen dy'd Church of <HI>England</HI>-men, and Prote∣stants,
does it follow that the Church of <HI>England</HI> therefore
Owns or Professes <HI>the Doctrin of the Dagger,</HI> teaches As∣sassination
of Princes, and the like.</P>
<P>The Schools of the Dissenters are not so private but
they may be known, they are not asham'd of their Per∣formances,
but that any Gentleman of the Church, or
any Man of Letters, may be admitted to see and hear
what they Teach, and what the Pupils Act there.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
because, for ought we know, they are Guilty, without
Examining the Truth of Fact; and if it were True in
one, or more, suppressing all the rest—. But this is
Ch—ch Justice; this is the effect of our Men of Temper,
and their Civillity to their Neighbours.</P>
<P>And if the Destruction of the Dissenting Interest was
not in this Design, why is not the Examination dire∣cted,
the Guilt prov'd, the Guilty singl'd out, and
Expos'd, or the Slander Silenc'd?</P>
<P>And when all is done, Gentlemen, why do we erect
private Accademies, and Teach our Children by them∣selves,
even for the same Reason that we don't Commu∣nicate
with you, <HI>viz.</HI> Because you shut us Out, and
Exclude us, by Imposing unreasonable Terms. Open a
Door to us in your Universities, and let our Youth be
fairly admitted to Study there, without Imposing Oaths
and Obligations upon them, and it shall no more be
said that we erect Schools in opposition to you. 'Tis
confess'd, we wou'd ask you to Reform the University
Morals a little, as to the Trifles of Drunkenness' and
Leudness, if it might be; but upon a Freedom of Study
without Unjust and Unfair Terms, and Oaths Impos'd,
we wou'd venture their Morals, and it shou'd not be our
Faults, if your Universities had not 2000 of our Children
always there.</P>
<P>Or if you refuse us this Liberty, give us leave to
Erect Foundations of our own there, and to Endow them
our Selves, give our Youth leave to study there Subject
to all General Offices and Rules of the University, and
only Free within Doors, and you shall soon see we will
neither injure your University, nor set up others of
our own.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
But while you shut our Children out of your Schools,
never Quarrel at our Teaching them at Schools of our
own, or sending 'em into Foreign Countries to be Taught,
since wherever they are Taught they generally get
a share of Learning, at least equal to your selves, and,
we hope, partake of as much Honesty; and as to their
Performances <HI>Match them</HI> and Out-preach them if
you can; I wish that was the only strife between us.</P>
<P>Upon this Article Mr. <HI>Sachevrell</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> has blown
his second Trumpet, to let us know he has not yet taken
down his Bloody Flag, and that he was the Real Author
of the <HI>Shortest Way,</HI> tho' another was Punish'd for it, and
we see he has the face to let them know, he is still of the
same mind.</P>
<P>I confess I am a little surpriz'd, to see Mr. <HI>Sachevrell</HI>
begin his Sermon with a Tenent long exploded by the
Church, till they found themselves a little Embarrass'd
with it. In short, 'tis a Whiggish Principle, and I am
glad to have his Voucher to Confirm it, this Gen∣tleman
owns, in the very first Lines, that <HI>the Regular Ad∣ministration
of Justice, is the Grand End and Design both of
Government and Law.</HI> P. first.</P>
<P>If this be true it follows that Justice <HI>which is
the End,</HI> is Superior to the King, that Executes, <HI>who
is the Means,</HI> for the End is always Superior to the Means,
and if this be true, Deposing Tyrannick evil Administra∣ting
Princes cannot be Criminal, because they Overturn
and Destroy the end of Government, and the thing it
self must fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>We thank him for this Concession, and hope he will
not take it ill if we find it convenient to Quote him upon
this occasion, in order to Confute such Authors who will
still have it be the Doctrine of the <HI>C.</HI> of <HI>E.</HI> to submit the
Laws and Administration of Justice absolutely to the Dis∣pose
of the Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
I am still farther in his debt, for a Declaration against
a persecuting Spirit, <HI>P.</HI> 5. he tells us honestly, “Who∣ever
is Guilty of an undeserv'd, unwarrantable Act of
Rigour, must be presum'd to have a malicious Incli∣nation.”</P>
<P>To state this, I am forc'd to have recourse to the Pre∣amble
of the first Occasional Bill, which ran thus,
“Whereas Persecution, meerly on Account of Consci∣ence,
is contrary to the Principles of the Christian Re∣ligion,
and to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.”</HI>
This Gentleman confirms it, for if Persecution is con∣trary
to the Christian Religion, 'tis certainly an unde∣serv'd,
unwarrantable Rigor, and consequently proceeds
from a malitious Inclination.</P>
<P>Why this Preamble was wholly left out in the second
Bill, I know not; nor will I affirm I believe it was from
what some have had Charity little enough to suggest,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Bill being to contain the very essence of
Persecution, they were loth it shou'd be Condemn'd by
its own Title.</P>
<P>As to that little part of this Gentleman's Discourse,
which he calls Sermon, or that has any Divinity in it I shall
wave any Debate, his extraordinary Eloquence I acknow∣ledge,
with gall not a little, and prejudice to extremity,
tho' Haranguing against it.</P>
<P>But as to the Jest of the Sermon, the Farce in the Play,
the Buffoonry of it, I must take it a little a-part.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> reducing his Discourse to the Article of Pre∣judice,
as it concerns Parties and Interest, he gives him∣self
a loose to play the Mad-man a little, and Banter <HI>Oc∣casional
Conformity</HI> as the most hideous Monster that ever
appear'd in this part of the World; for Answer to which,
I think 'tis enough to referr him back to the Reverend
Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s Speech in the House of Lords, where
he proves 'twas the practice of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to ad∣mit
of Persons of Different Religions into Places of Trust;
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
if the Case still continu'd the <HI>Test</HI> wou'd cease, and Oc∣casional
Conformity dye of course.</P>
<P>Then he turns his Discourse into Lampoon upon the
Bishops, and Taxes those Reverend Gentlemen, with
Breaking their Oaths, betraying the Church they pre∣tend
to support, and with favouring the Churches im∣placable
Enemies the Dissenters.</P>
<P>As to the Perjury of the Bishops, I cannot but observe,
how cunningly this Gentleman has hook'd them in;
first, he Taxes them for breaking their Oaths, and then
bewails the Insufficiency of our Laws in punishing Per∣jury;
and Exhorts the Judges, to whom he preach'd, to
prompt the Executing the utmost Severity in Cases of
Perjury, and to endeavour to have the Deficiency of the
Law supply'd,
<Q>What is it, <HI>says he,</HI> that the Infatuation of Prejudice
will not perswade Men to do: If it can prevail even upon
those, who pretend to support our Church and Government,
in spight of their Oaths and Obligations, to betray them,
<HI>P.</HI> 32.</Q>
Then running on in a scurrilous Invective on the Dissen∣ters,
he concludes, <HI>Are these the Wolves in Sheeps Cloath∣ing,
that are to be Invited and Complimented even by our
superiour Pastors into Christ's fold, to worry and devour it,</HI>
Page <HI>ibid.</HI> The Man raves.</P>
<P>First, Sir, can you prove that any of your Superiour
Pastors have Invited and Complimented the Dissen∣ters.</P>
<P>Secondly,
Can you prove they have Invited them in∣to
Christ's Fold to Worry and Devour.</P>
<P>If neither of these be true, then these are two of the
positive Untruths, I am loath to say <HI>L—s,</HI> of which I'le
prove, you have in this one Sermon debauch'd the
Pulpit with about Fourteen, to the Scandal of the
Ministerial Function, the Reproach of the Coat you
wear, and the open Discovery of your Honesty and Tem∣per:
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
As to the rest, let my Lords, the Bishops, Answer
for themselves, and, indeed, I think my Lord of <HI>Salis∣bury</HI>
has effectually done it in his Speech to the House of
Peers.</P>
<P>As to the Dissenters, Sir, we expect no good Lan∣guage
from you, <HI>for it is not your Talent,</HI> but Truth we
expect, and if you wont speak it, we must see if we can
at least expose your Falshood, and the Punishment will be
Detecting your Prevarication, and positive Falsities, of
which no Sermon sure was ever so full.</P>
<P>From your 31st page to 36. your Discourse is an en∣tire
Invective against the Dissenters, wherein, forgetting
all the Rules of Decency, you Treat them with worse
Language than, in good Manners, wou'd be thought fit
to give to <HI>Pagans, Indians,</HI> and Worshipers of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis suppos'd you dont desire we shou'd be at the pains
to prove that by <HI>Phanaticks,</HI> you mean all the several
sorts of Dissenters, and by <HI>Phanaticism</HI> their Opinions are
the terrible things you mean, and this I take for granted,
both from the Scope of your Sermon, which seems to be
a Mass of Gall, mixt up to a Consistency with Prejudice,
Envy, Pride, and ungovern'd Passion.</P>
<P>And, indeed, Sir, on these Accounts the <HI>Zeal of the
Lord having so eaten you up,</HI> as hardly to leave you your
Senses free from the Taint, we had never thought it
worth while to reply to so much Rallery, and such Abu∣sive
Language, as things not fit for a reasonable Man's
Notice, but for the sake of those honest Gentlemen's
Names who you put in the Front.</P>
<P>Now, as you are pleas'd to Dedicate your Book to
them, and to tell us it was at their Command you pub∣lish'd
it, 'twou'd ha tended much to the removing some
doubts in our Thoughts, if you had obtain'd, from those
Gentlemen, a short signification of the true Reasons why
they ordered the publication, some People, who have the
honour to know some of them, being of Opinion that
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
they did it meerly to banter you, and to let you give the
World the Character of your self; Others think those
Gentlemen might think 'twas a Compliment you expect∣ed,
and that since they knew you had prepar'd it for the
Press, they were unwilling to deprive you of what 'tis
known you are extreamly fond of, I mean the appear∣ing
in Print to the World.</P>
<P>Their Lordships the Judges, it seems, are the only two
who had Kindness and Charity enough for you, not to
prompt you to make your self so scandalously publick, and
therefore we do not find my Ld Chief Baron <HI>Ward</HI> cou'd
be perswaded to be so far accessary to the exposing you.</P>
<P>But to enter upon the Matter I ask your leave, that
laying aside all other Debates about your Sermon, and
not troubling my self with the foulness of your Language,
and the bitter Invectives against the Dissenters, as things
which do you little good, and your Argument less, I
shall only tell you, Sir, the Case in dispute between the
Church and the Dissenters on your side, is supported very
much by Rudeness and ill Manners, Opprobious Lan∣guage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> but on our side needs it not.</P>
<P>I shall therefore leave you to go on in your usual
stream of Rallery and ill Words, and only inform the
World how the Pulpit, which claims a due Reverence to
Truth, and a needful caution as to Matter of Fact, has
had the misfortune to Patronize you in Affirming a
great many things which you cannot make out to be true.</P>
<Q>1. You Affirm this <HI>Phanaticism,</HI> that is, these Opi∣nions
of the Dissenters, is <HI>nothing else but a most
Full and Comprehensive Combination of all Wayward
and Diabollical prejudices,</HI> P. 31.</Q>
<P>Now, Sir, allowing that our Dissenting from you were
ill Grounded in some Points, which, nevertheless, I do
not grant, since we agree with you in all the Fundamen∣tals
of Doctrine, and Sign to 36 of your 39 Articles of
Faith, how will you do to prove that our Dissenting,
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
which you call <HI>Phanaticism,</HI> is nothing else but a full
Combination of all Prejudices; how you Compliment
Thirty Six of the Church Articles in this Case,
to be part of this Combination I leave you to De∣fend
at your Leisure? You have been taught, Sir, in
that Fountain of Learning, where you make your present
figure, a better kind of Logick than Affirming without
Proving; so that till you prove our Principles to be <HI>No∣thing
else but a Combination of all Prejudices,</HI> we must crave
leave of you to set this Affirmation of yours down, as a
Falshood, and figure it in order <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, I demand you to prove that these Prejudices
of the Dissenters are Diabolical.</P>
<P>If it wou'd serve to convince you, I could bring you the
Testimony of all the Eminent Persons of your own Church,
who have disputed with us on the Heads of our Dissent∣ing,
and none of 'em wou'd ever Advance a Notion so
Black, so full of Malice, and so empty of Charity, that
we are under <HI>Diabolical Prejudices,</HI> and consequently <HI>can∣not
be sav'd out of your Church,</HI> this is Popery in its Ex∣alted
Extreams, and without using much Compliment
with you, I affirm that the Dissenters, Sir, are by all the
Rules from which a Christian Man may judge within the
Compass of a way of Salvation, as much as the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> and that I may not, like you, affirm what I
cannot make out. I prove it thus,</P>
<P>They Profess the same Doctrine, the same Faith, the
same Saviour, and the same Baptism with your Selves,
and if the Faith in a Redeemer, which is one and exactly
alike in those who are good Christians, and believers on
either side, is effectual to save one, it must be effectual to
save the other.</P>
<P>This position therefore being as yet unprov'd, and the
contrary own'd by the Fathers and Doctors of your own
Church in all Ages, I must mark it <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 4. and set it down as
a meer Genuine Forgery of your own Brain, form'd in that
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
very prejudice you pretend to Condemn, and advanc'd to
the World from a Heart full of Malice, thro' a Mouth full
of Cursing and Bitterness, without Argument, Proof,
Circumstance or Probability.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, you go on in the very next words, for
every Line abounds with falshood, to tell us you can never
be safe or secure from our restless and embroiling Designs.</P>
<P>How, Sir, I cannot forbear asking you what are these
Designs? We own the design to enjoy our Liberty of
Worshiping God according to our Consciences, which, to
your great mortification, is now our Right by Law, and
which her Majesty, to your yet greater Disappointment,
has promis'd us to Maintain and Continue, for which
you very fairly Unchurch'd her, and declar'd Her no
Friend to you, in another Invective of yours formerly
printed. We own also the Design of maintaining our
just Rights and Privileges as English-men, and by all
lawful Means to oppose and suppress all sorts of Tyrran∣ny
and Oppression, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil.</P>
<P>As to all other Designs, Sir, we Challenge you to prove
them, or any of them. We have always been upon the
Defensive with you; we have ever been attack'd, and
have only resisted your Violence? You are the daily
Aggressors, we Act nothing, or Say nothing, till you
force us by your furious and open Attempts upon our
just Freedom, which you will always find us willing, and,
I hope, able to defend.</P>
<P>We can prove your Party Guilty of Plots, and Em∣broiling
Designs. We defy you to show us one Dissen∣ter,
either in the late villainous Plot to Assassinate the
Nation's Deliverer, and the best King that ever sat on
the <HI>English</HI> Throne, or in the present Conspiracy. But we
are ready to give you a Black List, when you please, of
Church of <HI>England</HI> Protestants in both, Leaguing with
<HI>France</HI> to Embroil the Government of their Native Coun∣try,
Murther, and Depose their Lawful Prince, and In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roduce
a Popish Successor.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
To call upon you therefore for a Proof of the Em∣broiling
Designs of the Dissenters, is but a just return to
your Invidious Charge, and till you produce it, let that
stand for a double falshood, <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 5 6.</P>
<P>To fill up that one Page of Scandal, and make it pass
for a true Libel, you go back to <HI>the never to be forgotten</HI>
Year of 41.</P>
<P>And why, Sir, <HI>never to beforgotten;</HI> her Majesty in
her Speeches to excite the Nation to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> re∣commends
Temper, and generous Principles, all the Men
of Temper in your own Church tell us, the only way
to Peace is to lay aside former Annimosities, and Remem∣brances
of past Mischiefs. If they must never be for∣gotten,
pray, Sir, are you willing to recriminate, did we
<HI>suppose we were the Men,</HI> do any thing to King <HI>Charles</HI> I.
but what you did to his Son; has not a noble Lord vouch∣safing
to turn Author, and write the History of that Re∣bellion,
has he not told us in the first Part of his first Vo∣lume,
that the ill Conduct of that Prince brought all the
Calamities of Civil War upon his Head; had you done
less for his Son, if he had staid and fought you as his Fa∣ther
did? And did you do less when you fought him in
<HI>Ireland?</HI> How often have you been Challeng'd to bring
your Loyalty to the Test with us, and see who has rais'd
more Rebellions against the Establish'd Government, or
Murther'd more Princes, You, or We.</P>
<P>Let us look upon your present Proceedings, ...... you
say your poor Episcopal Church in <HI>Scotland</HI> suffers Bar∣barous
and Bloody Usage there, and that we never gave
the Church any Quarter when we had her in our power.</P>
<P>'Tis a Misfortune to you that your Passion so outgoes
your Reason, that when you happen to be in, you will
be in, and not content to pass the Truth in one particular,
you forget it in all the particulars, for neither of these
Cases happen to have any shaddow of Truth in 'em.</P>
<P>The Barbarisms and Bloody doings us'd with the Epis∣copal
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> amounted to so few, that when
they represented their Suffrings in an Address to Her
Majesty, all the sume of the Matter was so Trivial, that
her Majesty saw only Reason to Admonish them to more
Love and Charity with the Ministers of the National
Church, and to a due Submission to the Establish'd Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>To state this wonderful Grievance 'tis to be observ'd,
That the Great present Quarrel is at the <HI>Scots</HI> Establish∣ment,
and the Deposing Episcopacy. This the <HI>Scots</HI> have
an undoubted Right to, the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Establishment,
being the Original Protestant Settlement of that Nation,
into which they immediately Engaged at their first Re∣formation.</P>
<P>Episcopacy is an <HI>English</HI> Encroachment upon them, and
was first attempted by King <HI>James</HI> the First, about the
Year 1615, and since that, with great reluctancy, had
been submitted to in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se∣cond,
but was Abolish'd by Act of Parliament at the Re∣volution,
stands now Expell'd, and her Majesty knows
too well the Rights of her People, to attempt its Resto∣ration
against the Constitution of that Nation.</P>
<P>In which the just regard her Majesty has to the Native
Rights of her People is Conspicious, and her Moderation
known to all the World.</P>
<P>But wou'd this Gentleman be willing we shou'd inform
the World of the Patience with which these sufferers bear
the Expulsion of their Hierarchy, what Insults of the
present Incumbents, what Tumults and Breaches of the
of the Peace, what Clamours and Threatnings do the
present Establishment there bear with every day? For
which we refer to the Letter from the general Assembly
there to her Majesty, and the Accounts of Affairs daily
transmitted by Impartial Hands, and made publick.</P>
<P>As to the Bloody usage of the Dissenters there it is all
Forgery and Malice, and those Severities that have been
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
us'd with them, would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been much less had they first
submitted to the Constitution, taken the Oaths to the
Government, and made the dispute meerly Religious.</P>
<P>And yet, considering the Bloody and Barbarous usage
of the Dissenters formerly in that Kingdom, <HI>the Truth
is,</HI> they had reason to expect little favour, since I believe
'tis easy to make it out, that more People have been
Murther'd under the Episcopal Tyranny in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at
their Religious Meetings only, than the Bloody Reign of
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> formerly sacrific'd here on account of Popery
and Transubstantiation.</P>
<P>These therefore are positive untruths, your Church has
fair Quarter now in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Profession of it without
Tests, Sacraments or any Obligations, <HI>but that of the
Oath of Allegiance</HI> enjoy the advantage of Places and
Preferments, a thing we are denied here, and all this
Clamour, Sir, is so directly opposite to plain and demon∣strated
Truth, that we can Appeal even to the Queen's
Majesty her self, to testify for us, that you are mista∣ken,
and consequently encrease the List of Falsities to
<HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 7 and 8.</P>
<P>I purposely omit your bitter Invective at <HI>Occasional Con∣formity,</HI>
and at your own Friends, for rejecting the Bill
against it, let the Bishops you have Lampoon'd, and the
House of Lords you have Arraign'd, Answer you, as
thanks be to God they have effectually done.</P>
<P><HI>Then, Sir, you come in with another Forgery of your
own Brain, P.</HI> 35. These Designing Men, by the false Pre∣tences
of Moderation, serve themselves in a Twofold Way,
both upon the Church to Amuse and cast it into a Dead Sleep,
and then like <HI>Dalila</HI> to let in the <HI>Philistins,</HI> by widening a
Breach in her Constitution, First to weaken, and then to
overthrow it, and then on the Dissenters, to encourage them
in their Sins, by mitigating Theirs and the Churches Diffe∣rences,
and which is more Astonishing, by justifying their damna∣ble
Schism, <HI>and this blessed Speech you bring to this short
Conclusion,</HI> what have these Men to do with <HI>Peace and Union?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Thus, Sir, you have lift up your Banner of Defiance
a second time, and in the Name of the Church you tell
us, we shall have no <HI>Peace</HI> nor <HI>Union</HI> with you—we
are sorry for it, and if all the Church of <HI>England</HI> was of
your mind, we know what we had to expect; but bles∣sed
be God, this is the Language only of one mad Priest,
<HI>a Fury</HI> made up of a Complication of Malice, intollera∣ble
Pride, bigotted Zeal, and bloody Hellish Unchristian
Principles, to whom I shall Reply, in the Words of our
Blessed Saviour, to those high spirited passionate Disciples
that were for calling for fire from Heaven on the Jews.
<HI>Ye know not what Spirit you are of.</HI></P>
<P>But now, that the Dissenters may not stand alone, this
angry Gentleman, lets his Passion loose at all the Men of
Moderation in his own Church, and this last Paragraph
is a whole Satyr upon those we call Low Church-men.</P>
<P>These, he says, under pretence of Moderation, cast the
Church into a dead Sleep, in order to overthrow the
Constitution.</P>
<P><HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 9. This stands plain to be reckon'd a Notorious
Imposition upon 2 Millions of honest Gentlemen, who
not only are now, but at all times have been the Bul∣wark
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and it must remain to
me as a perfect Forgery, till he proves one Act, which
the Moderate Church-men ever did to overthrow the
Constitution of the Church.</P>
<P>In the mean time while I leave this Gentleman to
prove his hasty Affirmative if he can, I shall prove ano∣ther
Affirmative, out of which the Negative to his asserti∣on
will be plain by Consequence, and this I take to be a
fair way of Disputing, if he can tell me a fairer, I am
ready to join Issue with him.</P>
<P>First, Then I can prove that these Men of Modera∣tion
have, when the Church has been reduc'd to the last
Extremity, been the only Refuge, Deliverance, and re∣storers
of the Church.</P>
<P>To go no farther back than the Bishops who were sent
to the Tower in King <HI>James</HI>'s the Second's Reign, who,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
when you <HI>Gentlemen of the Tribe of</HI> Jehu had sooth'd up
that abus'd Prince to believe you spoke as you meant
when you talk'd of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non Resistance,</HI>
and upon that Presumption had encourag'd him to lay the
plan of the Churches Destruction, who were the Men
that fled from his Authority, to the Protection of the
Laws, but the present Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who first broke
the Ice by refusing the Illegal suspension of Dr. <HI>Tennison,</HI>
then Incumbent at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in the Fields, and after this
the Bishops, who went to the <HI>Tower,</HI> because they wou'd
not consent to a Suspention of the Laws, and yet, at the
same time, declar'd the Moderation of their Principles
and Charity for their Brethren, in promising to come to a
Temper with the Dissenters.</P>
<P>And, with these Worthy Prelates, joyn'd all the No∣bility
and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> who set their Hands to the
Invitation given the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and who join'd with
him to rescue this Church from the Destruction that then
threatned her.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are the Men of Moderation, most of them
are Enemies to your Fiery Temper, and have honest∣ly
appear'd against your <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> 'tis to these Mo∣derate
Church-men, you owe next to Divine Providence
the Restoration and Establishment of your Church, and in
particular, Sir, of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> of which,
if you write your self a Fellow, you ought not to be so
ungrateful as to turn upon your Deliverers, and charge
them with Overthrowing your Constitution, by whose
Courage, Honesty and Temper, you now enjoy your Fel∣lowship,
the College her Foundation Settlement, the
Church her Establishment, and the Nation her Liberties.</P>
<P>These are the Men of Moderation, who gave Peace
to the Dissenters, and while those Gentlemen Live, the
Church of <HI>England</HI> must flourish, and will do so, and her
Dissenting Brethren under their Protection enjoy the
Peace they wish for, and with which they always declar'd
themselves satisfied and content.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Many Instances more could be given you, in which
'tis plain to prove the Church owes her present Settle∣ment
under a Protestant Queen to the Justice, Candor, and
Courage of the Moderate Churchmen, when the Fury
of such Hot Spurs, as we are now talking to have brought
it to the Door of Destruction, but I think this sufficient to
detect this horrid Suggestion, that the Moderate Men are
the Overthrowers of the Constitution of the Church.</P>
<P>The Moderate Church-men there, says he, Mitigate the
Differences between the Church and the Dissenters.</P>
<P>Do they so, Sir, they then act like Christians, for whe∣ther
is the Spirit of Moderation, or that of Persecution,
the most like a Christian.</P>
<P>But if you mean by this they have made the
Differences seem less than they really are, I must call
that by the same Name with the rest, because it is
impossible you shou'd pretend to prove it.</P>
<P>But then you come with two positive Contradictions
in one Sentence, which including the former, brings the
Account up to <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>The moderate Men sooth the Dissenters by justfying
their Damnable Schism.</P>
<P>Astonishing Language! First 'tis impossible to prove
they justify this damnable Schism, because, secondly, Sir,
there is no damnable Schism nmong us.</P>
<P>Were these Gentlemen to be answer'd by Arguments
or Authorities; were they to be convinc'd by Proofs, by
Demonstrations, by any way of Arguing, they have been
told, 1st, by the whole House of Peers, Including the Spiritu∣al
Lords themselves, that the Dissenters are no Schismaticks,
Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> of <HI>Eaton,</HI> a Church of <HI>England</HI> Divine, has clear'd
us by unanswerable Arguments from the Charge of Schism.</P>
<P>If these are not sufficient, we fairly Challenge our Ad∣versary
to Answer Mr. <HI>Delaune,</HI> the Protestant Reconciler, the
Conformists Plea for the Non-Conformists Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Tongue,</HI> and multitudes more who have clear'd up
this Point, and make it very plain that our separation
from the Church is no Schism at all, much less can it
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
bear the Charitable Epethet of <HI>Damnable,</HI> bestow'd upon
it by this passionate Gentleman.</P>
<P>I come now to another false Accusation, and yet affirm'd
with as much Front as the rest, that <HI>the Dissenters never
fail'd to betray the Church, when ever they</HI> (the Church)
<HI>trusted them</HI> (the Dissenters.)</P>
<P>I think my self very civil to the Gentleman in letting
this pass but for one, and calling it <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 13. because I am
persuaded he cannot tell us, <HI>tho we can,</HI> when ever the
Church trusted the Dissenters with any thing, as well as
that he cannot prove when ever the Dissenters betray'd 'em.</P>
<P>But without putting him to prove whenever the Dissen∣ters
betray'd them, it is sufficient to prove the falsity of
his Argument, if I name him a time when the Church
did trust the Dissenters, and they did not betray them,
and when they had it in their Power to have reduc'd 'em
below the probability of an Establishment.</P>
<P>And because I purpose shortly to visit them with a full
Draught of the Treaty between the Dissenters in this
Case, and some Truths which I perceive this Author
knows nothing of, I shall be the shorter on this Head.</P>
<P>When in King <HI>James</HI> the Second's Time his Majesty
found, that in order to reduce the Church, it was his
business to Caress the Dissenters, and accordingly pub∣lish'd
an Immediate Indulgence, a great many of the Dis∣senters
made warm by their former sufferings, clos'd eager∣ly
with the Proposals, and would willingly have set their
Hand to the work; but when the Men of Temper, <HI>for
we do not deny to have some too violent Spirits among us,</HI>
came to consider the Case, they found the design struck at
the whole Body of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> they considered
them as Protestants and Brethren, they considered the
Methods useing with them as Destructive to the Laws,
as to the Church, and a Plot as well on Liberty as Reli∣gion,
they immediately stopt short, and tho' they cou'd
not but accept of Liberty as their Right and Proper due
in matters of Religion, yet they could not consent to en∣joy
it as a Ruine to the Law, and therefore vigorously
oppos'd the taking off the Penal Laws, tho' they them∣selves
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
were to reap the benefit of it. In this juncture
the Church finding the Root of her Constitution strook
at, and that if the Dissenters were brought over to joyn
in the Attempt, she should be undone without Remedy,
immediately apply'd to the Dissenters, represent to them
the design as aim'd at the whole Protestant Body, call
upon them with a <HI>Proximus Ardet,</HI> and tell them of <HI>Poly∣phemus</HI>'s
<HI>Courtesie,</HI> call the Declaration of Indulgence a
<HI>Trojan</HI> Horse, and talk to them as Brethren and Fellow
Christians all United in one Faith, Doctrine, Baptism,
hope of Life and Saviour, and at last come to the Point,
that if they would join with the Church to resist Inva∣ding
Popery, they would call in the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
and fight for their Liberty and Religion, and as to Diffe∣rences,
they would call a healing Parliament, establish In∣dulgence
by Law, fix an eternal Liberty of Conscience,
and from this time forward we should be all Brethren.</P>
<P>If you doubt, Sir, the Truth of this, either of the
Churches danger at that time, or the Dissenters quitting
their Revenge, and the Promises of their Prince, Ex∣amine
the College, of which you write Fellow, some of
your worthy Contemporaries can justify all this and more.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you trusted us, and we never betray'd you.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, We trusted you, and you have betray'd us,
our Indulgence indeed you have perform'd, and we acquit
you of that, tho' we know what we owe in that Case to K.
<HI>William,</HI> but where's the future Correspondence of Brethren
where the promis'd Temper? All this is forgot, and now,
when we say, is there Peace, you Answer, with <HI>Jehu, What
Peace so long as the Whoredomes of your Mother</HI> Jezabelle
<HI>continue,</HI> you cry, <HI>what have we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o do with</HI> Peace and Union?</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I think your Assertion is sufficiently prov'd
false, by proving we have been Trusted, and have not
betraid you, I wish you could defend the Treachery of
your Church from as plain an Example.</P>
<P>By the By, Sir, I must Note a very Christian-way of
Arguing in your 35th Page, when you come to justify
your persecuting Spirit, <HI>As to Persecution of Tender Consci∣ences,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
say you, <HI>I appeal to the Histories of our Kingdom, whe∣ther
ever they gave the Church the least Favour or Quarter,
when they had her under their power.</HI></P>
<P>I must finish my present Discourse with you upon this
Head, and first, I must Debate the Christian with you—Suppose
it were true that we had not, is it therefore justi∣fiable
that you must persecute Tender Consciences?</P>
<P>To what degrees of madness does the unbounded fury
of Men's Passions lead them, is this, Sir, your Christian
Religion, is this Church of <HI>England</HI> Religion, wou'd any
Man look for such Language in a Sermon against Prejudice.</P>
<P>I have noted in the beginning of this Book, that in the
Preface to the first <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> you will find these Words,
<HI>Persecution of tender Consciences is contrary to the Principles of
the Christian Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, but tho' it be both contrary to the
Christian and the Church of <HI>England</HI> Man, yet you will
do it because we <HI>never-show'd you any Favour or Quarter
when we had you in our Power.</HI></P>
<P>Excellent Christians, you will Revenge your selves tho'
you act against the Christian Principles, and the Doctrine
of your own Church.</P>
<P>But after all, Gentlemen, the excuse for this Matter
happens to be false too, for when we had you in our
Power in K. <HI>James</HI>'s time, we did show you favour, and give
you Quarter, for we chose War for your sakes, and quitted
all the Promises and Advantages we had made and offered
us by your Adversary, and are rewarded like your Selves.</P>
<P>In this Case your Glamours are so Unjust, that we
cannot but let you know that we are preparing an exacter
History, both of our Treatment of you, and your Treat∣ment
of us, which you shall have a Monthly Prospect of,
in which all your Barbarities and Injustices, as well as In∣gratitude
to the Dissenters, shall at large Appear.</P>
<P>And as we are forc'd to this Method to undeceive the
World, to whom such Incendiaries as you Mis-represent
us, so you are notorionsly the Agressors in your constant
Endeavours to blacken us to Posterity, and force us to
Expose you for our own just Vindication.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
We had much rather live in Peace, and Bury the Ini∣quities
of our, and your Fathers, in silence with their
Ashes, but since you are always raking up the Actions
of the Dead, and valluing your selves upon the Days of
41, we shall trace you back to your Original, and bring
you to an exact Ballance, as to Rebellion, Loyalty, killing
of Kings, Persecution, Principles, Honesty and Charity,
and we declare our selves content to stand by the Foot
of the Account with you.</P>
<P>In the mean time we have been Advertiz'd in Print of
a <HI>Black List,</HI> preparing for publick view of all the Suffer∣ings
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy in the Rebellion
of 1641. and that all well wishers to the Nation's feuds
should send in what Materials they have to raise the Bulk,
I take the freedom to give the Author Notice that we will
give them time to finish their design, we will abate 'em
all Mr. <HI>Calamy</HI>'s 9 Chapter, of Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s Life, and 3000
Ministers silenc'd and turn'd out, we will, perhaps, add
something for them to the List of their Sufferers, we will
throw them in 500000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling in the Account of Dama∣ges,
we will quit them a Tun of Dissenters Blood,
and abate them all the time they take to Muster up their
Evidences, and, in the short space of 14 days after their
Publication, come to a fair Account of Persecution with
them, and the whole cause shall turn upon the Ballance.</P>
<P>If this Challenge be not fair let them Answer this, and
I'le make them yet a fairer.</P>
<P>And as I design once a Month to give a particular of
the Mis-representations and base Treatment the Dissen∣ters
receive from this Party, till I have gone thro' the
whole History, so I shall produce such unanswerable Proofs,
such just Authorities and plain Matter of Fact, that I have
no Apprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of being disprov'd, having no need to
