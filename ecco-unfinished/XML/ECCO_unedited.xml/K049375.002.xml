<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Sir Launcelot Greaves.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which our Knight is tantalized with
a transient glimpse of felicity.</HEAD>
<P>THE success of our adventurer,
which we have particularized
in the last chapter, could not fail of
inhancing his character, not only
among those who knew him, but
also among the people of the town to
whom he was an utter stranger. The
populace surrounded the house, and
testified their approbation in loud
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
huzzas. Captain Crowe was more
than ever inspired with veneration for
his admired patron, and more than
ever determined to pursue his foot∣steps
in the road of chivalry. Fillet,
and his friend the lawyer, could not
help conceiving an affection, and
even a profound esteem, for the ex∣alted
virtue, the person, and the ac∣complishments
of the knight, dashed
as they were with a mixture of extra∣vagance
and insanity. Even Sir
Launcelot himself was elevated to an
extraordinary degree of self-compla∣cency
on the fortunate issue of his ad∣venture,
and became more and more
persuaded that a knight-errant's pro∣fession
might be exercised, even in
England, to the advantage of the
community. The only person of the
company who seemed unanimated
with the general satisfaction was Mr.
Thomas Clarke. He had, not with∣out
good re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son, laid it down as a
maxim, that knight-errantry and
madness were syn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimous terms;
and that madness, though exhibited
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
in the most advantageous and agree∣able
light, could not change its na∣ture,
but must continue a perversion
of sense to the end of the chapter.
He perceived the additional impres∣sion
which the brain of his uncle had
sustained, from the happy manner in
which the benevolence of Sir Launce∣lot
had so lately operated; and be∣gan
to fear it would be, in a little
time, quite necessary to have recourse
to a commission of lunacy, which
might not only disgrace the family of
the Crowes, but also tend to invalidate
the settlement which the captain had
already made in favour of our young
lawyer.</P>
<P>Perplexed with these cogitations,
Mr. Clarke appealed to our adven∣turer's
own reflection. He expatiated
upon the bad consequences that would
attend his uncle's perseverance in the
execution of a scheme so foreign to
his faculties; and intreated him, for
the love of God, to divert him from
his purpose, either by arguments or
authority; as, of all mankind, the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
knight alone had gained such an ascen∣dency
over his spirit, that he would
listen to his exhortations with respect
and submission. Our adventurer was
not so mad, but that he saw and
owned the rationality of these remarks.
He readily undertook to employ all
his influence with Crowe to dissuade
him from his extravagant design; and
seized the first opportunity of being
alone with the captain, to signify his
sentiments on this subject. “Cap∣tain
Crowe (said he), you are then
determined to proceed in the course
of knight-errantry?” “I am, (re∣plied
the seaman) with God's help,
d'ye see, and the assistance of wind
and weather—” “What, do'st thou
talk of wind and weather! (cried the
knight, in an elevated tone of affect∣ed
transport:) without the help of
Heaven, indeed, we are all vanity,
imbecility, weakness, and wretched∣ness;
but if thou art resolved to em∣brace
the life of an errant, let me not
hear thee so much as whisper a doubt,
a wish, an hope, or sentiment, with
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
respect to any other obstacle, which
wind or weather, fire or water, sword
or famine, danger or disappointment,
may throw in the way of thy career.
—When the duty of thy profession
calls, thou must singly rush upon in∣numerable
hosts of armed men: thou
must storm the breach in the mouth
of batteries loaded with death and de∣struction,
while, every step thou movest,
thou art exposed to the horrible ex∣plosion
of subterranea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mines, which,
being sprung, will whirl thee aloft in
air, a mangled corse, to feed the fowls
of heaven. Thou must leap into the
abyss of dismal caves and caverns, re∣plete
with poisonous toads and hissing
serpents. Thou must plunge into
seas of burning sulphur: thou must
launch upon the ocean in a crazy bark,
when the foaming billows roll moun∣tain
high, when the lightning flashes,
the thunder roars, and the howling
tempest blows, as if it would commix
the jarring elements of air and water,
earth and fire, and reduce all nature
to the original anarchy of chaos. Thus
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
involved, thou must turn thy prow
full against the fury of the storm, and
stem the boisterous surge to thy de∣stined
port, though at the distance of
a thousand leagues—thou must.”—</P>
<P>“Avast, avast, brother, (exclaim∣ed
the impatient Crowe) you've
got into the high latitudes, d'ye see:
—if so be as you spank it away at that
rate, adad, I can't continue in tow—
we must cast off the rope, or 'ware
timbers.—As for your 'osts and
breeches, and hurling aloft, d'ye see,
your caves and caverns, whistling
tuoads and serpents, burning brim∣stone
and foaming billows, we must
take our hap; I value 'em not a rot∣ten
ratline:—but, as for sailing in the
wind's eye, brother, you must give
me leave—no offence, I hope—I
pretend to be a thorough-bred seaman,
d'ye see—and I'll be damned if you,
or e'er an arrant that broke biscuit ever
sailed in a three-mast vessel within
five points of the wind, allowing for
variation and lee-way.—No, no,
brother, none of your tricks upon
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
travellers—I a'n't now to learn my
compass.” “Tricks! (cried the
knight, starting up, and laying his
hand on the pummel of his sword)
what! suspect my honour!”</P>
<P>Crowe, supposing him to be really
incensed, interrupted him with great
earnestness, saying, “Nay, don't—
what a-pize!—adds-buntlines!—I
did'n't go to give you the lie, brother,
smite my limbs: I only said as how
to sail in the wind's eye was impossi∣ble.”
“And I say unto thee, (re∣sumed
the knight) nothing is impossi∣ble
to a true knight-errant, inspired
and animated by love.” “And I say
unto thee, (hollowed Crowe) if so
be as how love pretends to turn his
hawse-holes to the wind, he's no sea∣man
d'ye see, but a snotty-nose lub∣berly
boy, that knows not a cat from
a capstan—a-don't.” “He that
does not believe that love is an infalli∣ble
pilot, must not embark upon the
voyage of chivalry; for, next to the
protection of Heaven, it is from love
that the knight derives all his prowess
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
and glory. The bare name of his
mistress invigorates his arm: the re∣membrance
of her beauty infuses in
his breast the most heroic sentiments
of courage, while the idea of her
chastity hedges him round like a
charm, and renders him invulnerable
to the sword of his antagonist. A
knight without a mistress is a mere
non-entity, or at least a monster in
nature, a pilot without compass, a
ship without rudder, and must be dri∣ven
to and fro upon the waves of dis∣comfiture
and disgrace.” “An that
be all, (replied the sailor) I told you
before as how I've got a sweet-heart,
as true a hearted girl as ever swung
in canvas.—What tho'f she may have
started a hoop in rolling—that signifies
nothing—I'll warrant her tight as a
nut-shell.” “She must, in your
opinion, be a paragon either of beauty
or virtue. Now, as you have given
up the last, you must uphold her
charms unequalled, and her person
without a parallel.” “I do, I
do uphold she will sail upon a
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
parallel as well as e'er a frigate
that was rigged to the northward
of fifty.” “At that rate she must
rival the attractions of her whom
I adore, but that, I say, is impossi∣ble:
the perfections of my Aurelia
are altogether supernatural; and as
two suns cannot shine together in the
same sphere with equal splendor, so
I affirm, and will prove with my
body, that your mistress, in compa∣rison
with mine, is as a glow-worm
to the meridian sun, a rush-light to
the full moon, or a stale mackerel's
eye to a pearl of orient.” “Harkye,
brother, you might give good words,
however: an we once fall a-jawing,
d'ye see, I can heave out as much
bilge-water as another; and since you
besmear my sweetheart Besselia, I can
as well bedaub your mistress Aurelia,
whom I value no more than old junk,
pork-slush, or stinking stockfish.”
“Enough, enough—such blasphemy
shall not pass unchastised. In consi∣deration
of our having fed from the
same table, and maintained together
a friendly, tho' short intercourse, I
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
will not demand the combat before
you are duly prepared. Proceed to
the first great town, where you can
be furnished with horse and harnessing,
with arms offensive and defensive:
provide a trusty squire, assume a mot∣to
and device—declare yourself a son
of chivalry; and proclaim the excel∣lence
of her who rules your heart.
I shall fetch a compass,; and where∣soever
we may chance to meet, let us
engage with equal arms in mortal
combat, that shall decide and deter∣mine
this dispute.”</P>
<P>So saying, our adventurer stalked
with great solemnity into another
apartment; while Crowe, being suf∣ficiently
irritated, snapped his fingers
in token of defiance. Honest Crowe
thought himself scurvily used by a
man whom he had cultivated with
such humility of veneration; and,
after an incoherent ejaculation of sea∣oaths,
went in quest of his nephew,
in order to make him acquainted with
this unlucky transaction.</P>
<P>In the mean time Sir Launcelot,
having ordered supper, retired into
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
his own chamber, and gave a loose
to the most tender emotions of his
heart. He recollected all the fond
ideas which had been excited in the
course of his correspondence with
the charming Aurelia. He remem∣bered,
with horror, the cruel letter
he had received from that young la∣dy,
containing a formal renunciation
of his attachment, so unsuitable to the
whole tenour of her character and
conduct. He revolved the late ad∣venture
of the coach, and the decla∣ration
of Mr. Clarke, with equal
eagerness and astonishment; and was
seized with the most ardent desire of
unravelling a mystery so interesting to
the predominant passion of his heart.
—All these mingled considerations
produced a kind of ferment in the
oeconomy of his mind, which sub∣sided
into a profound reverie, com∣pounded
of hope and perplexity.</P>
<P>From this trance he was waked
by the arrival of his squire, who en∣tered
the room with the blood trick∣ling
over his nose, and stood before
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
him without speaking. When the
knight asked whose livery was that he
wore, he replied, “'Tis your ho∣nour's
own livery:—I received it on
your account, and hope as you will
quit the score.” Then he proceeded
to inform his master, that two officers
of the army having come into the
kitchen, insisted upon having for their
supper the victuals which Sir Launce∣lot
had bespoke; and that he, the
squire, objecting to the proposal, one
of them had seized the poker, and
basted him with his own blood; that
when he told them he belonged to a
knight-errant, and threatened them
with the vengeance of his master,
they cursed and abused him, calling
him Sancho Panza, and such dogs
names; and bade him tell his master
Don Quicksot, that, if he made any
noise, they would confine him to his
cage, and lie with his mistress Dul∣cinea.
“To be sure, Sir, (said he)
they thought you as great a nincom∣poop
as your squire—trim tram; like
master, like man;—but I hope as
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
how you will give them a Rowland
for their Oliver.”</P>
<P>“Miscreant! (cried the knight)
you have provoked the gentlemen
with your impertinence, and they
have chastised you as you deserve.
I tell thee, Crabshaw, they have
saved me the trouble of punishing
thee with my own hands; and well
it is for thee, sinner as thou art, that
they themselves have performed the
office: for, had they complained to
me of thy insolence and rusticity, by
Heaven! I would have made thee an
example to all the impudent squires
upon the face of the earth. Hence
then, avaunt, caitif.—Let his ma∣jesty's
officers, who are perhaps fa∣tigued
with hard duty in the service
of their country, comfort themselves
with the supper which was intended
for me, and leave me undisturbed to
my own meditations.”</P>
<P>Timothy did not require a repeti∣tion
of this command, which he
forthwith obeyed, growling within
himself, that thence-forward he
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
should let every cuckold wear his own
horns; but he could not help enter∣taining
some doubts with respect to
the courage of his master, who, he
supposed, was one of those Hectors
who have their fighting days, but are
not at all times equally prepared for
the combat.</P>
<P>The knight, having taken a slight
repast, retired to his repose; and had
for some time enjoyed a very agree∣able
slumber, when he was start∣led
by a knocking at his chamber-door.
“I beg your honour's pardon,
(said the landlady) but there are two
uncivil persons in the kitchen, who
have well nigh turned my whole
house topsy-turvy. Not contented
with laying violent hands on your
honour's supper, they want to be
rude to two young ladies who are just
arrived, and have called for a post∣chaise
to go on. They are afraid to
open their chamber-door to get out—
and the young lawyer is like to be
murdered for taking the ladies part.”</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>
Sir Launcelot, though he refused
to take notice of the insult which had
been offered to himself, no sooner
heard of the distress of the ladies
than he started up, huddled on his
cloaths, and, girding his sword to his
loins, advanced with a deliberate pace
to the kitchen, where he perceived
Thomas Clarke warmly engaged in
altercation with a couple of young
men dressed in regimentals, who, with
a peculiar air of arrogance and fero∣city,
treated him with great insolence
and contempt. Tom was endeavour∣ing
to persuade them, that, in the
constitution of England, the military
was always subservient to the civil
power; and that their behaviour to a
couple of helpless young women was
not only unbecoming gentlemen, but
expresly contrary to the law, inasmuch
as they might be sued for an assault on
an action of damages.</P>
<P>To this remonstrance the two he∣roes
in red replied by a volley of dread∣ful
oaths, intermingled with threats,
which put the lawyer in some pain
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
for his ears. While one thus endea∣voured
to intimidate honest Tom
Clarke, the other thundered at the
door of the apartment to which the
ladies had retired, demanding admit∣tance,
but received no other answer
than a loud shriek. Our adventurer
advancing to this uncivil champion,
accosted him thus in a grave and so∣lemn
tone: “Assuredly I could not
have believed, except upon the evi∣dence
of my own senses, that persons
who have the appearance of gentle∣men,
and bear his majesty's ho∣nourable
commission in the army,
could behave so wide of the decorum
due to society, of a proper respect to
the laws, of that humanity which we
owe to our fellow-creatures, and that
delicate regard for the fair-sex, which
ought to prevail in the breast of every
gentleman, and which in particular
dignifies the character of a soldier.
To whom shall that weaker tho' more
amiable part of the creation, fly for
protection, if they are insulted and
outraged by those whose more imme∣diate
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
duty is it to afford them security
and defence from injury and vio∣lence?
What right have you, or any
man upon earth, to excite riot in a
public inn, which may be deemed a
temple sacred to hospitality, to disturb
the quiet of your fellow-guests, some
of them perhaps exhausted by fatigue,
some of them invaded by distemper,
to interrupt the king's lieges in their
course of journeying upon their law∣ful
occasions? Above all, what mo∣tive
but wanton barbarity, could
prompt you to violate the apartment,
and terrify the tender hearts of two
helpless young ladies travelling no doubt
upon some cruel emergency, which
compels them unattended to encoun∣ter
in the night the dangers of the
highway.”</P>
<P>“Heark ye, Don Bethlem, (said
the captain, strutting up and cocking
his hat in the face of our adventurer)
you may be as mad as e'er a straw∣crowned
monarch in Moorfields, for
aught I care; but damme! don't you
be saucy, otherwise I shall dub your
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
worship with a good stick across your
shoulders.” “How! petulant boy
(cried the knight) since you are so ig∣norant
of urbanity, I will give you a
lesson that you shall not easily forget.”
So saying, he unsheathed his sword,
and called upon the soldier to draw
in his defence.</P>
<P>The reader may have seen the
physiognomy of a stockholder at Jo∣nathan's
when the rebels were at
Derby, or the features of a bard when
accosted by a bailiff, or the counte∣nance
of an alderman when his bank∣er
stops payment; if he has seen ei∣ther
of these phaenomena, he may
conceive the appearance that was now
exhibited by the visage of the feroci∣ous
captain, when the naked sword
of Sir Launcelot glanced before his
eyes: far from attempting to pro∣duce
his own, which was of un∣conscionable
length, he stood mo∣tianless
as a statue, staring with the
most ghastly look of terror and
astonishment. His companion, who
partook of his panic, seeing matters
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
brought to a very serious crisis, in∣terposed
with a crest fallen counte∣nance,
assuring Sir Launcelot they
had no intention to quarrel, and what
they done was intirely for the sake of
the frolick.</P>
<P>“By such frolicks (cried the knight)
you become nuisances to society, bring
yourselves into contempt, and disgrace
the corps to which you belong. I
now perceive the truth of the obser∣vation,
that cruelty always resides with
cowardice. My contempt is changed
into compassion; and as you are pro∣bably
of good families, I must insist
upon this young man's drawing his
sword, and acquitting himself in such
a manner as may screen him from
the most infamous censure which an
officer can undergo.” “Lack a day,
Sir (said the other) we are no officers,
but 'prentices to two London haber∣dashers,
travellers for orders. Cap∣tain
is a good travelling name, and
we have dressed ourselves like officers
to procure more respect upon the
road.”</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23"/>
The knight said he was very glad,
for the honour of the service, to find
they were impostors; tho' they de∣served
to be chastised for arrogating to
themselves an honourable character,
which they had not spirit to sustain.</P>
<P>These words were scarce pronoun∣ced,
when Mr. Clarke approaching
one of the bravadoes, who had
threatened to crop his ears, bestowed
such a benediction on his jaw, as he
could not receive without immediate
humiliation; while Timothy Crab∣shaw,
smarting from his broken-head
and his want of supper, saluted the
other with a Yorkshire hug, that
layed him across the body of his com∣panion.
In a word, the two pseudo∣officers
were very roughly handled
for their presumption in pretending
to act characters for which they were
so ill qualified.</P>
<P>While Clarke and Crabshaw were
thus laudably employed, the two
young ladies passed through the
kitchen so suddenly, that the knight
had only a transient glimpse of their
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
backs, and they disappeared before
he could possibly make a tender of
his services. The truth is, they dread∣ed
nothing so much as their being dis∣covered,
and took the first opportu∣nity
of gliding into the chaise, which
had been for some time waiting in the
passage.</P>
<P>Mr. Clarke was much more dis∣concerted
than our adventurer, by
their sudden escape. He ran with
great eagerness to the door, and, per∣ceiving
they were flown, returned to
Sir Launcelot, saying, “Lord bless my
soul, Sir, didn't you see who it was?”
“Hah! how! (exclaimed the knight,
reddening with alarm) who was it?”
“One of them (replied the lawyer)
was Dolly, our old landlady's daugh∣ter
at the Black Lyon.—I knew her
when first she lighted, notwithstand∣ing
her being neatly dressed in a green
joseph, which, I'll assure you, Sir,
becomes her remarkably well.—I'd
never desire to see a prettier creature.
As for the other, she's a very genteel
woman; but whether old or young,
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
ugly or handsome, I can't pretend to
say; for she was masqued.—I had just
time to salute Dolly, and ask a few
questions;—but all she could tell me
was, that the masqued lady's name
was Miss Meadows; and that she,
Dolly, was hired as her waiting-wo∣man.”</P>
<P>When the name of Meadows was
mentioned, Sir Launcelot, whose
spirits had been in violent commo∣tion,
became suddenly calm and se∣rene,
and he began to communicate
to Clarke the dialogue which had
passed between him and captain
Crowe, when the hostess, addressing
herself to our errant, “Well, (said
she) I have had the honour to ac∣commodate
many ladies of the first
fashion at the White Hart, both young
and old, proud and lowly, ordinary
and handsome; but such a miracle as
Miss Meadows I never yet did see.
Lord, let me never thrive but I think
she is of something more than a hu∣man
creature.—O, had your honour
but set eyes on her, you would have
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
said it was a vision from Heaven, a
cherubim of beauty:—for my part,
I can hardly think it was any thing
but a dream:—then so meek, so mild,
so good-natured and generous! I say,
blessed is the young woman who tends
upon such a heavenly creature:—and
poor dear young lady! she seems to
be under grief and affliction; for the
tears stole down her lovely cheeks, and

pearl.”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot listened attentively to
the description, which reminded him
of his dear Aurelia, and, sighing bit∣terly,
withdrew to his own apartment.</P>

<P>THOSE who have felt the doubts,
the jealousies, the resentments,
the humiliations, the hopes, the des∣pair,
the impatience, and, in a word,
the infinite disquiets of love, will be
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
able to conceive the sea of agitation on
which our adventurer was tossed all
night long, without repose or inter∣mission.
Sometimes he resolved to
employ all his industry and address in
discovering the place in which Aurelia
was sequestred, that he might rescue
her from the supposed restraint to
which she had been subjected. But,
when his heart beat high with the an∣ticipation
of this exploit, he was sud∣denly
invaded, and all his ardour
checked, by the remembrance of that
fatal letter, written and signed by her
own hand, which had divorced him
from all hope, and first unsettled his
understanding. The emotions waked
by this remembrance were so strong,
that he leaped from the bed, and, the
fire being still burning in the chimney,
lighted a candle, that he might once
more banquet his spleen by reading the
original billet, which, together with
the ring he had received from Miss
Darnel's mother, he kept in a small
box, carefully deposited within his
portmanteau. This being instantly
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
unlocked, he unfolded the paper,
and recited the contents in these
words:</P>
<P>“Sir, Obliged as I am by the pas∣sion
you profess, and the eagerness
with which you endeavour to give me
the most convincing proof of your re∣gard,
I feel some reluctance in making
you acquainted with a circumstance,
which, in all probability, you will not
learn without some disquiet. But the
affair is become so interesting, I am
compelled to tell you, that however
agreeable your proposals may have
been to those whom I thought it my
duty to please by every reasonable con∣cession,
and howsoever you may have
been flattered by the seeming compla∣cency
with which I have heard your
addresses, I now find it absolutely ne∣cessary
to speak in a decisive strain, to
assure you, that, without sacrificing my
own peace, I cannot admit a conti∣nuation
of your correspondence; and
that your regard for me will be best
shewn by your desisting from a pur∣suit,
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
which is altogether inconsistent
with the happiness of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>AURELIA DARNEL.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Having pronounced aloud the words
that composed this dismission, he ha∣stily
replaced the cruel scroll; and,
being too well acquainted with the
hand to harbour the least doubt of its
being genuine, threw himself into his
bed in a transport of despair, mingled
with resentment; during the predo∣minancy
of which, he determined to
proceed in the career of adventure, and
endeavour to forget the unkindness of
his mistress, amidst the avocations of
knight-errantry. Such was the reso∣lution
that governed his thoughts,
when he rose in the morning, ordered
Crabshaw to saddle Bronzomarte, and
demanded a bill of his expence. Be∣fore
these orders could be executed,
the good woman of the house, enter∣ing
his apartment, told him, with
marks of concern, that the poor young
lady, Miss Meadows, had dropped her
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
pocket-book in the next chamber,
where it was found by the hostess,
who now presented it unopened.</P>
<P>Our knight, having called in Mrs.
Oakley and her son as witnesses, un∣folded
the book, without reading one
syllable of the contents, and found in
it five bank-notes, amounting to two
hundred and thirty pounds. Per∣ceiving,
at once, that the loss of this
treasure might be attended with the
most embarrassing consequences to the
owner, and reflecting that this was a
case which demanded the immediate
interposition and assistance of chivalry,
he declared, that he himself would
convey it safely into the hands of Miss
Meadows; and desired to know the
road she had pursued, that he might
set out in quest of her, without a mo∣ment's
delay. It was not without
some difficulty that this information
was obtained from the post-boy, who
had been enjoined secrecy by the lady,
and even gratified with a handsome re∣ward
for his promised discretion. The
same method was used to make him
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
disgorge his trust: he undertook to
conduct Sir Launcelot, who hired a
post-chaise for dispatch, and imme∣diately
departed, after having directed
his squire to follow his tract with the
horses.</P>
<P>Yet, whatever haste he made, it is
absolutely necessary for the reader's sa∣tisfaction,
that we should outstrip the
chaise, and visit the ladies before his
arrival. We shall therefore, without
circumlocution, premise, that Miss
Meadows was no other than that pa∣ragon
of beauty and goodness, the all-accomplished
Miss Aurelia Darnel.
She had, with that meekness of resig∣nation
peculiar to herself, for some
years submitted to every species of
oppression which her uncle's tyranny
of disposition could plan, and his un∣limited
power of guardianship execute,
till, at length, it rose to such a pitch
of despotism as she could not endure.
He had projected a match between
his niece and one Philip Sycamore,
Es{que} a young man who possessed a
pretty considerable estate in the North
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
Country; who liked Aurelia's person,
but was enamoured of her fortune,
and had offered to purchase Anthony's
interest and alliance with certain con∣cessions,
which could not but be agree∣able
to a man of loose principles, who
would have found it a difficult task to
settle the accounts of his wardship.</P>
<P>According to the present estimate
of matrimonial felicity, Sycamore
might have found admittance as a fu∣ture
son-in-law in any private family
of the kingdom. He was by birth a
gentleman, tall, straight, and muscu∣lar,
with a fair, sleek, unmeaning face,
that promised more simplicity than ill-nature.
His education had not been
neglected, and he inherited an estate of
five thousand a year. Miss Darnel,
however, had penetration enough to
discover and despise him as a strange
composition of rapacity and profusion,
absurdity and good-sense, bashfulness
and impudence, self-conceit and diffi∣dence,
aukwardness and ostentation,
insolence and good-nature, rashness
and timidity. He was continually sur∣rounded
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
and preyed upon by certain
vermin called led-captains and buf∣foons,
who shewed him in leading-strings
like a sucking giant, rifled his
pockets without ceremony, ridiculed
him to his face, traduced his charac∣ter,
and exposed him in a thousand lu∣dicrous
attitudes for the diversion of
the public; while, all the time, he
knew their knavery, saw their drift,
detested their morals, and despised
their understanding. He was so infa∣tuated
by indolence of thought, and
communication with folly, that he
would have rather suffered himself to
be led into a ditch with company, than
be at the pains of going over a bridge
alone; and involved himself in a thou∣sand
difficulties, the natural conse∣quences
of an error in the first con∣coction,
which, though he plainly saw
it, he had not resolution enough to
avoid.</P>
<P>Such was the character of squire Sy∣camore,
who professed himself the ri∣val
of Sir Launcelot Greaves in the good
graces of Miss Aurelia Darnel. He
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
had in this pursuit persevered with
more constancy and fortitude, than he
ever exerted in any other instance.
Being generally needy, from extrava∣gance,
he was stimulated by his
wants, and animated by his vanity,
which was artfully instigated by his
followers, who hoped to share the
spoils of his success. These motives
were reinforced by the incessant and
eager exhortations of Anthony Darnel,
who, seeing his ward in the last year
of her minority, thought there was no
time to be lost in securing his own in∣demnification,
and snatching his niece
for ever from the hopes of Sir Launce∣lot,
whom he now hated with redou∣bled
animosity. Finding Aurelia deaf
to all his remonstrances, proof against
ill-usage, and resolutely averse to the
proposed union with Sycamore, he en∣deavoured
to detach her thoughts
from Sir Launcelot, by forging tales to
the prejudice of his constancy and mo∣ral
character; and, finally, by recapi∣tulating
the proofs and instances of his
distraction, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch he particularized
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
with the most malicious exaggera∣tions.</P>
<P>In spite of all his arts, he found it
impracticable to surmount her objec∣tions
to the purposed alliance, and
therefore changed his battery. In∣stead
of transferring her to the arms of
his friend, he resolved to detain her in
his own power by a legal claim, which
would invest him with the uncon∣trouled
management of her affairs.
This was a charge of lunacy, in con∣sequence
of which he hoped to obtain
a commission, to secure a jury to his
wish, and be appointed sole committee
of her person, as well as steward on
her estate, of which he would then be
heir apparent. As the first steps to∣wards
the execution of this honest
scheme, he had subjected Aurelia to
the superintendency and direction of
an old duenna, who had been for∣merly
the procuress of his pleasures;
and hired a new set of servants, who
were given to understand, at their first
admission, that the young lady was
disordered in her brain.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
An impression of this nature is easily
preserved among servants, when the
master of the family thinks his interest
is concerned in supporting the im∣posture.
The melancholy produced
from her confinement, and the viva∣city
of her resentment under ill-usage,
were, by the address of Anthony,
and the prepossession of his domesticks,
perverted into the effects of insanity;
and the same interpretation was strained
upon her most indifferent words and
actions. The tydings of Miss Darnel's
disorder were carefully circulated in
whispers, and soon reached the ears
of Mr. Sycamore, who was not at all
pleased with the information. From
his knowledge of Anthony's disposi∣tion,
he suspected the truth of the re∣port;
and unwilling to see such a
prize ravished, as it were, from his
grasp, he, with the advice and assistance
of his myrmidons, resolved to set the
captive at liberty, in full hope of turn∣ing
the adventure to his own advan∣tage:
for he argued in this manner:
“If she is in fact <HI>compos mentis,</HI> her
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
gratitude will opetate in my behalf,
and even prudence will advise her to
embrace the proffered asylum from
the villany of her uncle. If she is
really disordered, it will be no great
difficulty to deceive her into a mar∣riage,
and then I become her trustee
of course.”</P>
<P>The plan was well conceived; but
Sycamore had not discretion enough
to keep his own counsel. From
weakness and vanity, he blabbed the
design, which in a little time was
communicated to Anthony Darnel;
and he took his precautions accord∣ingly.
Being infirm in his own per∣son,
and consequently unfit for oppo∣sing
the violence of some desperadoes,
whom he knew to be the satellites of
Sycamore, he prepared a private re∣treat
for his ward at the house of an
old gentleman, the companion of his
youth, whom he had imposed upon
with the fiction of her being disordered
in her understanding, and amused
with a story of a dangerous design
upon her person. Thus cautioned and
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
instructed, the gentleman had gone
with his own coach and servants to re∣ceive
Aurelia and her governante at a
third house, to which she had been
privately removed from her uncle's
habitation; and in this journey it was,
that she had been so accidentally pro∣tected
from the violence of the robbers
by the interposition and prowess of
our adventurer.</P>
<P>As he did not wear his helmet in
that exploit, she recognized his fea∣tures
as he passed the coach, and,
struck with the apparition, shrieked a∣loud.
She had been assured by her
guardian, that his design was to con∣vey
her to her own house; but per∣ceiving,
in the sequel, that the car∣riage
struck off upon a different road,
and finding herself in the hands of
strangers, she began to dread a much
more disagreeable fate, and conceive
doubts and ideas that filled her tender
heart with horror and affliction. When
she expostulated with the duenna, she
was treated like a changeling, admo∣nished
to be quiet, and reminded that
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
she was under the direction of those
who would manage her with a tender
regard to her own welfare, and the
honour of her family. When she ad∣dressed
herself to the old gentleman,
who was not much subject to the emo∣tions
of humanity, and besides firmly
persuaded that she was deprived of her
reason, he made no answer; but laid
his finger on his mouth, by way of
enjoining silence.</P>
<P>This mysterious behaviour aggrava∣ted
the fears of the poor hapless young
lady; and her terrors waxed so strong,
that when she saw Tom Clarke, whose
face she knew, she called aloud for
assistance, and even pronounced the
name of his patron Sir Launcelot
Greaves, which she imagined might
stimulate him the more to attempt
something for her deliverance.</P>
<P>The reader has already been in∣formed
in what manner the endeavours
of Tom and his uncle miscarried.
Miss Darnel's new keeper having, in
the course of his journey, halted for
refreshment at the Black Lyon, of
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
which being landlord, he believed the
good woman and her family were in∣tirely
devoted to his will and pleasure,
Aurelia found an opportunity of speak∣ing
in private to Dolly, who had a
very prepossessing appearance. She
conveyed a purse of money into the
hands of this young woman, telling
her, while the tears trickled down her
cheeks, that she was a young lady of
fortune, in danger, as she apprehended,
of assassination. This hint, which she
communicated in a whisper, while the
governante stood at the other end of
the room, was sufficient to interest
the compassionate Dolly in her behalf.
As soon as the coach departed, she
made her mother acquainted with the
transaction; and as they naturally con∣cluded
that the young lady expected
their assistance, they resolved to ap∣prove
themselves worthy of her confi∣dence.</P>
<P>Dolly having inlisted in their design
a trusty countryman, one of her own
professed admirers, they set out toge∣ther
for the house of the gentleman in
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
which the fair prisoner was confined,
and waited for her in secret at the end
of a pleasant park, in which they na∣turally
concluded she might be in∣dulged
with the privilege of taking the
air. The event justified their con∣ception:
on the very first day of their
watch they saw her approach, accom∣panied
by her duenna. Dolly and her
attendant immediately tied their horses
to a stake, and retired into a thicket,
which Aurelia did not fail to enter.
Dolly forthwith appeared, and, taking
her by the hand, led her to the horses,
one of which she mounted in the ut∣most
hurry and trepidation, while the
countryman bound the duenna with a
cord, prepared for the purpose, gagged
her mouth, and tied her to a tree,
where he left her to her own medita∣tions.
Then he mounted before Dolly,
and through unfrequented paths con∣ducted
his charge to an inn on the post∣road,
where a chaise was ready for
their reception.</P>
<P>As he refused to proceed farther,
lest his absence from his own home
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
should create suspicion, Aurelia re∣warded
him liberally; but would not
part with her faithful Dolly, who, in∣deed,
had no inclination to be dis∣charged:
such an affection and at∣tachment
had she already acquired for
the amiable fugitive, though she knew
neither her story, nor her true name.
Aurelia thought proper to conceal
both, and assumed the fictitious ap∣pellation
of Meadows, until she should
be better acquainted with the disposi∣tion
and discretion of her new atten∣dant.
The first resolution she could
take in the present flutter of her spirits,
was to make the best of her way to
London, where she thought she might
find an asylum in the house of a fe∣male
relation, married to an eminent
physician, known by the name of
Kawdle. In the execution of this hasty
resolve, she travelled at a violent rate,
from stage to stage, in a carriage drawn
by four horses, without halting for ne∣cessary
refreshment or repose, until she
judged herself out of danger of being
overtaken. As she appeared over∣whelmed
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
with grief and consternation
the good-natured Dolly endeavoured
to alleviate her distress with diverting
discourse; and, among other less in∣teresting
stories, entertained her with
the adventures of Sir Launcelot and
captain Crowe, which she had seen
and heard recited while they remained
at the Black Lyon: nor did she fail
to introduce Mr. Thomas Clarke, in
her narrative, with such a favourable
representation of his person and cha∣racter,
as plainly discovered that her
own heart had received a rude shock
from the irresistible force of his qua∣lifications.</P>
<P>The history of Sir Launcelot
Greaves was a theme which effec∣tually
fixed the attention of Aurelia,
distracted as her ideas must have been
by the circumstances of her present
situation. The particulars of his con∣duct,
since the correspondence be∣tween
her and him had ceased, she
heard with equal concern and asto∣nishment;
for, how far soever she
deemed herself detached from all
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
possibility of future connexion with
that young gentleman, she was not
made of such indifferent stuff, as to
learn without emotion the calamitous
disorder of an accomplished youth,
whose axtraordinary virtues she could
not but revere.</P>
<P>As they had deviated from the
post-road, taken precautions to con∣ceal
their route, and made such pro∣gress,
that they were now within one
day's journey of London, the careful
and affectionate Dolly seeing her dear
lady quite exhausted with fatigue, used
all her natural rhetoric, which was very
powerful, mingled with tears that
flowed from the heart, in persuading
Aurelia to enjoy some repose; and so
far she succeeded in the attempt, that
for one night the toil of travelling was
intermitted. This recess from incre∣dible
fatigue, was a pause that afford∣ed
our adventurer time to overtake
them before they reached the metro∣polis,
that vast labyrinth, in which
Aurelia might have been for ever lost
to his inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45"/>
It was in the afternoon of the day
which succeeded his departure from
the White Hart, that Sir Launcelot
arrived at the inn, where Miss Aurelia
Darnel had bespoke a dish of tea, and
a post-chaise for the next stage. He
had, by inquiry, traced her a con∣siderable
way, without ever dream∣ing
who the person really was whom
he thus pursued, and now he desired
to speak with her attendant. Dolly
was not a little surprised to see Sir
Launcelot Greaves, of whose charac∣ter
she had conceived a very sublime
idea, from the narrative of Mr
Thomas Clarke; but she was still
more surprised when he gave her to
understand, that he had charged him∣self
with the pocket-book, contain∣ing
the bank-notes, which Miss Mea∣dows
had dropped in the house where
they had been threatened with insult.
Miss Darnel had not yet discovered
her disaster, when her attendant, run∣ning
into the apartment, presented
the prize, which she had received
from our adventurer, with his com∣pliments
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
to Miss Meadows, implying
a request to be admitted into her pre∣sence,
that he might make a personal
tender of his best services.</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed that the
amiable Aurelia heard unmoved such
a message from a person, whom her
maid discovered to be the very iden∣tical
Sir Launcelot Greaves, whose
story she had so lately related: but as
the ensuing scene requires fresh at∣tention
in the reader, we shall defer
it till another opportunity, when his
spirits shall be recruited from the fa∣tigue
of this chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Exhibiting an interview, which it is to
be hoped, will interest the curiosity of
the reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of the delicate Au∣relia
was strangely agitated by
the intelligence which she received,
with her pocket-book, from Dolly.
Confounded as she was by the nature
of her situation, she at once perceived
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
that she could not, with any regard to
the dictates of gratitude, refuse com∣plying
with the request of Sir Launce∣lot;
but, in the first hurry of her
emotion, she directed Dolly to beg,
in her name, that she might be ex∣cused
for wearing a masque at the in∣terview
which he desired, as she had
particular reasons, which concerned
her peace, for retaining that disguise.
Our adventurer submitted to this pre∣liminary
with a good grace, as he had
nothing in view but the injunctions of
his order, and the duties of humani∣ty;
and he was admitted without fur∣ther
preamble. When he entered the
room, he could not help being struck
with the presence of Aurelia. Her
stature was improved since he had
seen her; her shape was exquisitely
formed; and she received him with
an air of dignity, which impressed
him with a very sublime idea of her
person and character. She was no
less affected at the sight of our adven∣turer,
who, though cased in armour,
appeared with his head uncovered;
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
and the exercise of travelling had
thrown such a glow of health and
vivacity on his features, which were
naturally elegant and expressive, that
we will venture to say, there was not
in all England a couple that excelled
this amiable pair in personal beauty
and accomplishments. Aurelia shone
with all the fabled graces of nymph
or goddess; and to Sir Launcelot
might be applied what the divine
poet Ariosto says of the prince Zer∣bino:
<Q>Natura il fece e poi ruppe la stampa.</Q></P>
<Q>“When Nature stamp'd him, she
the dye destroy'd.'</Q>
<P>Our adventurer, having made his
obeisance to this supposed Miss Mea∣dows,
told her, with an air of plea∣santry,
that altho' he thought himself
highly honoured in being admitted to
her presence, and allowed to pay his
respects to her, as superior beings are
adored, unseen; yet his pleasure
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
would receive a very considerable ad∣dition,
if she would be pleased to
withdraw that invidious veil, that he
might have a glimpse of the divinity
which it concealed. Aurelia imme∣diately
took off her masque, saying,
with a faultering accent, “I cannot
be so ungrateful as to deny such a
small favour to a gentleman who has
laid me under the most important ob∣ligations.”</P>
<P>The unexpected apparition of Miss
Aurelia Darnel, beaming with all the
emanations of ripened beauty, blushing
with all the graces of the most lovely
confusion, could not but produce a
violent effect upon the mind of Sir
Launcelot Greaves. He was, indeed,
overwhelmed with a mingled trans∣port
of astonishment, admiration,
affliction, and awe. The colour va∣nished
from his cheeks, and he stood
gazing upon her, in silence, with the
most emphatic expression of counte∣nance.
Aurelia was infected by his
disorder: she began to tremble, and
the roses fluctuated on her face.—</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50"/>
“I cannot forget (said she) that I
owe my life to the courage and hu∣manity
of Sir Launcelot Greaves, and
that he at the same time rescued from
the most dreadful death a dear and ve∣nerable
parent.” “Would to heaven
she still survived! (cried our adven∣turer
with great emotion.) She was
the friend of my youth, the kind pa∣troness
of my felicity! my guardian
angel forsook me when she expired!
her last injunctions are deep engraven
on my heart!”</P>
<P>While he pronounced these words
she lifted her handkerchief to her fair
eyes, and, after some pause, proceed∣ed
in a tremulous tone, “I hope, Sir
—I hope you have—I should be sorry
—pardon me, Sir, I cannot reflect
upon such an interesting subject un∣moved—”
Here she fetched a deep
sigh, that was accompanied with a
flood of tears; while the knight con∣tinued
to bend his eyes upon her with
the utmost eagerness of attention.
Having recollected herself a little,
she endeavoured to shift the conver∣sation:
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
“You have been abroad since
I had the pleasure to see you—I hope
you were agreeably amused in your
travels.” “No, madam, (said our
hero, drooping his head) I have been
unfortunate.” When she, with the
most enchanting sweetness of bene∣volence,
expressed her concern to
hear he had been unhappy, and her
hope that his misfortunes were not
past remedy; he lifted up his eyes,
and fixing them upon her again with
a look of tender dejection, “Cut off
(said he) from the possession of what
my soul held most dear, I wished for
death, and was visited by distraction.
—I have been abandoned by my rea∣son
—my youth is for ever blasted.”—</P>
<P>The tender heart of Aurelia could
bear no more—her knees began to
totter: the lustre vanished from her
eyes, and she fainted in the arms of
her attendant. Sir Launcelot, aroused
by this circumstance, assisted Dolly in
seating her mistress on a couch, where
she soon recovered, and saw the
knight on his knees before her. “I
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
am still happy (said he) in being able
to move your compassion, though I
have been held unworthy of your
esteem.” “Do me justice, (she re∣plied:)
my best esteem has been al∣ways
inseparably connected with the
character of Sir Launcelot Greaves”—“Is
it possible? (cried our hero) then
surely I have no reason to complain.
If I have moved your compassion,
and possess your esteem, I am but one
degree short of supreme happiness—
that, however, is a gigantic step.—
O Miss Darnel! when I remember
that dear, that melancholy mo∣ment.”
—So saying, he gently
touched her hand, in order to press
it to his lips, and perceived on her
finger the very individual ring which
he had presented in her mother's pre∣sence,
as an interchanged testimony
of plighted faith. Starting at the
well known object, the sight of which
conjured up a strange confusion of
ideas, “This (said he) was once the
pledge of something still more cordial
than esteem.” Aurelia, blushing at
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
this remark, while her eyes lightened
with unusual vivacity, replied, in a
severer tone, “Sir, you best know how
it lost its original signification.” “By
heaven! I do not, madam, (exclaim∣ed
our adventurer.) With me it was
ever held a sacred idea throned within
my heart, cherished with such fer∣vency
of regard, with such reverence
of affection, as the devout anchorite
more unreasonably pays to those saint∣ed
reliques that constitute the object of
his adoration—” “And, like those
reliques, (answered Miss Darnel) I
have been insensible of my votary's
devotion.—A saint I must have been,
or something more, to know the
sentiments of your heart by inspi∣ration.”
“Did I forbear (said he)
to express, to repeat, to enforce the
dictates of the purest passion that
ever warmed the human breast, un∣til
I was denied access, and formally
discarded by that cruel dismission.”—“I
must beg your pardon, Sir, (cried
Aurelia, interrupting him hastily) I
know not what you mean.” “That
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
fatal sentence, (said he) if not pro∣nounced
by your own lips, at least
written by your own fair hand, which
drove me out an exile for ever from
the paradise of your affection.” “I
would not (she replied) do Sir Laun∣celot
Greaves the injury to suppose
him capable of imposition: but you
talk of things to which I am an utter
stranger.—I have a right, Sir, to de∣mand
of your honour, that you will
not impute to me your breaking off a
connection, which—I would—rather
wish—had never.”—“Heaven and
earth! what do I hear? (cried our
impatient knight) have I not the bale∣ful
letter to produce? What else but
Miss Darnel's explicit and express de∣claration
could have destroyed the
sweetest hope that ever cheared my
soul; could have obliged me to re∣sign
all claim to that felicity for which
alone I wished to live; could have
filled my bosom with unutterable sor∣row
and despair; could have even
divested me of reason, and driven
me from the society of men, a poor,
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
forlorn, wandering lunatic, such as
you see me now prostrate at your feet;
all the blossoms of my youth wither∣ed,
all the honours of my family de∣cayed?”</P>
<P>Aurelia looking wistfully at her lo∣ver,
“Sir, (said she) you overwhelm
me with amazement and anxiety! you
are imposed upon, if you have re∣ceived
any such letter: you are de∣ceived,
if you thought Aurelia Dar∣nel
could be so insensible, ungrateful,
and—inconstant.”</P>
<P>This last word she pronounced with
some hesitation, and a downcast look,
while her face underwent a total suf∣fusion,
and the knight's heart began
to palpitate with all the violence of
emotion. He eagerly imprinted a
kiss upon her hand, exclaiming, in
interrupted phrase, “Can it be possi∣ble?—Heaven
grant—Sure this is no
illusion.—O, madam!—shall I call
you my Aurelia? My heart is burst∣ing
with a thousand fond thoughts
and presages. You shall see that dire
paper which hath been the source of
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
all my woes—it is the constant com∣panion
of my travels.—Last night I
nourished my chagrin with the peru∣sal
of its horrid contents.”</P>
<P>Aurelia expressed great impatience
to view the cruel forgery; for such she
assured him it must be: but he could
not gratify her desire till the arrival of
his servant with the portmanteau.
In the mean time, tea was called.
The lovers were seated: he looked
and languished; she flushed and faul∣tered:
all was doubt and delirium,
fondness and flutter. Their mutual
disorder communicated itself to the
kind-hearted sympathizing Dolly, who
had been witness to the interview, and
deeply affected with the disclosure of
the scene. Unspeakable was her sur∣prize
when she found her mistress
Miss Meadows was no other than
the celebrated Aurelia Darnel, whose
elogium she had heard so eloquently
pronounced by her sweet-heart Mr.
Thomas Clarke; a discovery which
still more endeared her lady to her
affection. She had wept plentifully
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
at the progress of their mutual expla∣nation;
and was now so disconcerted,
that she scarce knew the meaning of
the orders she had received. She set
the kettle on the table, and placed
the tea-board on the fire. Her con∣fusion,
by attracting the notice of
her mistress, helped to relieve her
from her own embarrassing situation.
She, with her own delicate hands,
rectified the mistake of Dolly; who
still continued to sob, and said, “Yaw
may think, my leady Darnel, as haw
I 'aive yeaten hool-cheese; but it
y'an't soa.—I'se think, vor maai peart,
as how I'aive bean bewitched.” Sir
Launcelot could not help smiling at
the simplicity of Dolly, whose goodness
of heart and attachment, Aurelia
did not fail to extol, as soon as her
back was turned. It was in conse∣quence
of this commendation, that,
the next time she entered the room,
our adventurer, for the first time,
considered her face, and seemed to
be struck with her features. He
asked her some questions, which she
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
could not answer to his satisfaction,
applauded her regard for her lady,
and assured her of his friendship and
protection. He now begged to know
the cause that obliged his Aurelia to
travel at such a rate, and in such an
equipage; and she informed him of
those particulars which we have al∣ready
communicated to the reader.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot glowed with resent∣ment,
when he understood how his
dear Aurelia had been oppressed by
her perfidious and cruel guardian. He
bit his nether lip, rolled his eyes
around, started from his seat, and
striding across the room, “I remem∣ber
(said he) the dying words of her
who is now a saint in heaven—“That
violent man, my brother-in-law,
who is Aurelia's sole guardian,
will thwart her wishes with every ob∣stacle
that brutal resentment and im∣placable
malice can contrive.”—What
followed, it would ill become me to
repeat: but she concluded with these
words—“The rest we must leave to
the dispensations of Providence.”—
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
Was it not Providence that sent me
hither, to guard and protect the in∣jured
Aurelia?” Then turning to
Miss Darnel, whose eyes streamed
with tears, he added, “Yes, divine
creature! heaven, careful of your
safety, and in compassion to my suf∣ferings,
hath guided me hither, in
this mysterious manner, that I might
defend you from violence, and enjoy
this transition from madness to delibe∣ration,
from despair to felicity.” So
saying, he approached this amiable
mourner, this fragrant flower of beau∣ty,
glittering with the dew-drops of
the morning; this sweetest, and gent∣lest,
loveliest ornament of human
nature: he gazed upon her with
looks of love ineffable: he sat down
by her; he pressed her soft hand in
his; he began to fear that all he saw
was the flattering vision of a distem∣pered
brain. He looked and sighed;
and turning up his eyes to heaven,
breathed, in broken murmurs, the
chaste raptures of his soul. The ten∣derness
of this communication was
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
too painful to be long endured. Au∣relia
industriously interposed other
subjects of discourse, that his atten∣tion
might not be dangerously over∣charged,
and the afternoon passed in∣sensibly
away.</P>
<P>Though he had determined, in his
own mind, never more to quit this
idol of his soul, they had not yet con∣certed
any plan of conduct, when
their happiness was all at once inter∣rupted
by a repetition of cries, de∣noting
horror; and a servant, coming
in, said he believed some rogues were
murdering a traveller on the highway.
The supposition of such distress ope∣rated
like gunpowder on the disposition
of our adventurer, who, without con∣sidering
the situation of Aurelia, and
indeed without seeing, or being capa∣ble
to think on her, or any other sub∣ject,
for the time being, ran directly
to the stable, and mounting the first
horse which he found saddled, issued
out in the twilight, having no other
weapon but his sword. He rode full
speed to the spot whence the cries
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
seemed to proceed; but they sounded
more remote as he advanced. Ne∣vertheless
he followed them to a con∣siderable
distance from the road, over
fields, ditches, and hedges; and at
last came so near, that he could plain∣ly
distinguish the voice of his own
squire, Timothy Crabshaw, bellow∣ing
for mercy, with hideous vocife∣ration.
Stimulated by this recogni∣tion,
he redoubled his career in the
dark, till at length his horse plunged
into a hole, the nature of which he
could not comprehend; but he found
it impracticable to disengage him.
It was with some difficulty that he
himself clambered over a ruined wall,
and regained the open ground. Here
he groped about, in the utmost im∣patience
of anxiety, ignorant of the
place, mad with vexation for the fate
of his unfortunate squire, and be∣tween
whiles invaded with a pang of
concern for Aurelia, left among stran∣gers,
unguarded, and alarmed. In
the midst of this emotion, he be∣thought
himself of hollowing aloud,
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
that, in case he should be in the neigh∣bourhood
of any inhabited place, he
might be heard and assisted. He ac∣cordingly
practised this expedient,
which was not altogether without ef∣fect;
for he was immediately answer∣ed
by an old friend, no other than
his own steed Bronzomarte, who,
hearing his master's voice, neighed
strenuously at a small distance. The
knight, being well acquainted with
the sound, heard with astonishment;
and, advancing in the right direction,
found his noble charger fastened to a
tree. He forthwith untied and mount∣ed
him; then, laying the reins upon
his neck, allowed him to chuse his
own path, in which he began to tra∣vel
with equal steadiness and expe∣dition.
They had not proceeded far
when the knight's ears were again sa∣luted
by the cries of Crabshaw; which
Bronzomarte no sooner heard than he
pricked up his ears, neighed, and
quickened his pace, as if he had been
sensible of the squire's distress, and
hastened to his relief. Sir Launcelot,
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
notwithstanding his own disquiet,
could not help observing and admiring
this generous sensibility of his horse:
he began to think himself some hero
of romance mounted upon a winged
steed, inspired with reason, directed
by some humane inchanter, who pitied
virtue in distress. All circumstances
considered, it is no wonder that the
commotion in the mind of our ad∣venturer
produced some such deli∣rium.
All night he continued the
chace; the voice, which was repeat∣ed
at intervals, still retreating before
him, till the morning began to ap∣pear
in the East, when, by divers
piteous groans, he was directed to
the corner of a wood, where he be∣held
his miserable squire stretched up∣on
the grass, and Gilbert feeding by
him altogether unconcerned, the hel∣met
and the launce suspended at the
saddle-bow, and the portmanteau
safely fixed upon the crupper.</P>
<P>The knight, riding up to Crabshaw,
with equal surprize and concern, ask∣ed
what had brought him there; and
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
Timothy, after some pause, during
which he surveyed his master with a
rueful aspect, answered, “The de∣vil.”
“One would imagine, indeed,
you had some such conveyance, (said
Sir Launcelot.) I have followed your
cries since last evening I know not
how, nor whither, and never could
come up with you till this moment.
But, say, what damage have you
sustained, that you lie in that wretch∣ed
posture, and groan so dismally?”
“I can't guess, (replied the squire)
if it bean't that mai hoole carcase is
drilled into oilet hools, and my flesh
pinched into a jelly.”—“How!
wherefore? (cried the knight)—who
were the miscreants that treated you
in such a barbarous manner? Do you
know the ruffians?” “I know no∣thing
at all, (answered the peevish
squire) but that I was tormented by
vive houndred and vifty thousand le∣gions
of devils, and there's an end
oon't.” “Well, you must have a
little patience, Crabshaw—there's a
salve for every sore.”—“Yaw mought
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
as well tell ma, for every zow there's
a zirreverence.” “For a man in
your condition, methinks you talk
very much at your ease—Try if you
can get up and mount Gilbert, that
you may be conveyed to some place
where you can have proper assistance.
—So—well done—chearly.”—</P>
<P>Timothy actually made an effort
to rise; but fell down again, and ut∣tered
a dismal yell. Then his master
exhorted him to take advantage of a
park-wall by which he lay, and raise
himself gradually upon it. Crab∣shaw,
eying him askance, said, by
way of reproach, for his not alight∣ing
and assisting him in person,
“Thatch your house with t—d,
and you'll have more teachers than
reachers.”—Having pronounced this
inelegant adage, he made shift to stand
upon his legs; and now, the knight
lending a hand, was mounted upon
Gilbert, though not without a world
of oh's! and ah's! and other ajacu∣lations
of pain and impatience. As
they jogged on together, our adven∣turer
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
endeavoured to learn the parti∣culars
of the disaster which had be∣fallen
the squire; but all the in∣formation
he could obtain amounted
to a very imperfect sketch of the ad∣venture.
By dint of a thousand in∣terrogations
he understood, that Crab∣shaw
had been, in the preceding
evening, encountered by three per∣sons
on horseback with Venetian
masques on their faces, which he
mistook for their natural features, and
was terrified accordingly: that they
not only presented pistols to his breast,
and led his horse out of the highway;
but pricked him with goads, and
pinched him, from time to time, till
he screamed with the torture: that he
was led through unfrequented places
across the country, sometimes at an
easy trot, sometimes at full gallop,
and tormented all night by those hi∣deous
daemons, who vanished at day-break,
and left him lying on the spot
where he was found by his master.
This was a mystery which our hero
could by no means unriddle: it was
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
the more unaccountable, as the squire
had not been robbed of his money,
horses, and baggage. He was even
disposed to believe, that Crabshaw's
brain was disordered, and the whole
account he had given, no more than
a chimera. This opinion, however,
he could no longer retain, when he
arrived at an inn on the post-road,
and found, upon examination, that
Timothy's lower extremities were co∣vered
with blood, and all the rest of
his body speckled with livid marks of
contusion. But he was still more cha∣grined
when the landlord informed
him, that he was thirty miles distant
from the place where he had left Au∣relia,
and that his way lay through
cross-roads, which were almost im∣passable
at that season of the year.
Alarmed at this intelligence, he gave
directions that his squire should be
immediately conveyed to bed in a
comfortable chamber, as he complain∣ed
more and more; and indeed was
seized with a fever, occasioned by the
fatigue, the pain, and terror he had
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
undergone. A neighbouring apo∣thecary
being called, and giving it
as his opinion that he could not for
some days be in a condition to travel,
his master deposited a sum of money
in his hands, desiring he might be
properly attended, till he should hear
further. Then mounting Bronzo∣marte,
he set out with a guide for the
place he had left, not without a thou∣sand
fears and perplexities, arising
from the reflection of having left the
jewel of his heart with such precipi∣tation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which, it is to be hoped, the reader
will find an agreeable medley of mirth
and madness, sense and absurdity.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not without reason that our
adventurer afflicted himself: his
fears were but too prophetic. When
he alighted at the inn, which he had
left so abruptly the preceding evening,
he ran directly to the apartment where
he had been so happy in Aurelia's com∣pany;
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
but her he saw not—all was
solitary. Turning to the woman of
the house, who had followed him into
the room, “Where is the lady?”
cried he, in a tone of impatience.
Mine hostess, screwing up her features
into a very demure aspect, said she saw
so many ladies, she could not pretend
to know who he meant. “I tell thee,
woman, (exclaimed the knight, in a
louder accent) thou never sawest such
another—I mean that miracle of beau∣ty—”
“Very like, (replied the dame,
as she retired to the room-door.) Hus∣band,
here's one as axes concerning a
miracle of beauty; hi, hi, hi. Can
you give him any information about
this miracle of beauty?—Ola! hi, hi,
hi.” Instead of answering this ques∣tion,
the inn-keeper advancing, and
surveying Sir Launcelot, “Friend,
(said he) you are the person that car∣ried
off my horse out of the stable.”
“Tell me not of a horse—where is
the young lady?” “Now I will tell
you of the horse, and I'll make you
find him too, before you and I part.”
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
“Wretched animal! how dar'st thou
dally with my impatience?—Speak,
or despair.—What is become of Miss
Meadows? Say, did she leave this
place of her own accord, or was she—
hah!—speak—answer, or, by the
Powers above—” “I'll answer you
flat—she you call Miss Meadows is in
very good hands—so you may make
yourself easy on that score—” “Sa∣cred
Heaven! explain your meaning,
miscreant, or I'll make you a dreadful
example to all the insolent publicans of
the realm.” So saying, he seized him
with one hand, and dashing him on
the floor, set one foot on his belly, and
kept him trembling in that prostrate
attitude. The hostler and waiter fly∣ing
to the assistance of their master,
our adventurer unsheathed his sword,
declaring he would dismiss their souls
from their bodies, and exterminate the
whole family from the face of the
earth, if they would not immediately
give him the satisfaction he required.</P>
<P>The hostess, being by this time ter∣rified
almost out of her senses, fell on
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
her knees before him, begging he
would spare their lives, and promising
to declare the whole truth. He would
not, however, remove his foot from
the body of her husband, until she told
him, that, in less than half an hour af∣ter
he had sallied out upon the sup∣posed
robbers, two chaises arrived,
each drawn by four horses: that two
men, armed with pistols, alighting
from one of them, laid violent hands
upon the young lady; and, notwith∣standing
her struggling and shrieking,
forced her into the other carriage, in
which was an infirm gentleman, who
called himself her guardian: that the
maid was left to the care of a third
servant, to follow with a third chaise,
which was got ready with all possible
dispatch, while the other two pro∣ceeded
at full speed on the road to
London. It was by this communica∣tive
lacquey the people of the house
were informed, that the old gentle∣man
his master was squire Darnel, the
young lady his niece and ward, and
our adventurer a needy sharper, who
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
wanted to make prey of her fortune.
The knight, fired even almost to
frenzy by this intimation, spurned the
carcase of his host; and, his eye
gleaming terror, rushed into the yard,
in order to mount Bronzomarte, and
pursue the ravisher, when he was di∣verted
from his purpose by a new in∣cident.</P>
<P>One of the postilions, who had dri∣ven
the chaise in which Dolly was
conveyed, happened to arrive at that
instant; when, seeing our hero, he
ran up to him cap in hand, and, pre∣senting
a letter, accosted him in these
words: “Please your noble honour,
if your honour be Sir Launcelot
Greaves of the West Riding, here's a
letter from a gentlewoman, that I pro∣mised
to deliver into your honour's
own hands.”</P>
<P>The knight, snatching the letter
with the utmost avidity, broke it up,
and found the contents couched in
these terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P><PB N="71" REF="74"/>
Nothing could be more seasonable
than the delivery of this billet; which
he had no sooner perused, than his
reflection returned, and he entered
into a serious deliberation with his own
heart. He considered that Aurelia
was by this time far beyond a possi∣bility
of being overtaken; and that
by a precipitate pursuit he should only
expose his own infirmities. He con∣fided
in the attachment of his mistress,
and in the fidelity of her maid, who
would find opportunities of com∣municating
her sentiments, by the
means of this lacquey, of whom he
perceived by the letter she had alrea∣dy
made a conquest. He therefore
resolved to bridle his impatience, to
proceed leisurely to London, and, in∣stead
of taking any rash step which
might induce Anthony Darnel to re∣move
his niece from that city, remain
in seeming quiet until she should be
settled, and her guardian returned to
the country. Aurelia had mention∣ed
to him the name of doctor Kawdle,
and from him he expected, in due
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
time, to receive the most interesting
information.</P>
<P>These reflections had an instan∣taneous
effect upon our hero, whose
rage immediately subsided, and whose
visage gradually resumed its natural
cast of courtesy and good humour.
He forthwith gratified the postilion
with such a remuneration as sent him
dancing into the kitchen, where he
did not fail to extol the generosity and
immense fortune of Sir Launcelot
Greaves.</P>
<P>Our adventurer's next step was to
see Bronzomarte properly accommo∣dated;
then he ordered a refreshment
for himself, and retired into an apart∣ment,
where mine host with his wife
and all the servants waited on him, to
beseech his honour to forgive their im∣pertinence,
which was owing to their
ignorance of his honour's quality, and
the false information they had received
from the gentleman's servant. He
had too much magnanimity to retain
the least resentment against such in∣considerable
objects. He not only par∣doned
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
them without hesitation; but
assured the landlord he would be ac∣countable
for the horse, which, how∣ever,
was that same evening brought
home by a countryman, who had
found him pounded as it were within
the walls of a ruined cottage. As
the knight had been greatly fatigued,
without enjoying any rest for eight
and forty hours, he resolved to indulge
himself with one night's repose, and
then return to the place where he had
left his squire indisposed: for by this
time even his concern for Timothy
had recurred.</P>
<P>On a candid scrutiny of his own
heart, he found himself much less
unhappy than he had been before his
interview with Aurelia; for, instead
of being as formerly tormented with
the pangs of despairing love, which
had actually unsettled his understand∣ing,
he was now happily convinced
that he had inspired the tender breast
of Aurelia with mutual affection;
and though she was invidiously
snatched from his embrace, in the
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
midst of snch endearments as had
wound up his soul to extasy and trans∣port,
he did not doubt of being able
to rescue her from the power of an
inhuman kinsman, whose guardian∣ship
would soon of course expire;
and in the mean time, he rested with
the most perfect dependence on her
constancy and virtue.</P>
<P>As he next day crossed the coun∣try,
ruminating on the disaster that
had befallen his squire, and could
now compare circumstances coolly,
he easily comprehended the whole
scheme of that adventure, which was
no other than an artifice of Anthony
Darnel and his emissaries, to draw
him from the inn where he proposed
to execute his design upon the inno∣cent
Aurelia. He took it for granted,
that the uncle, having been made
acquainted with his niece's elopement,
had followed her track by the help of
such information as he received from
one stage to another; and that, receiv∣ing
more particulars at the White Hart
touching Sir Launcelot, he had form∣ed
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
the scheme in which Crabshaw
was an involuntary instrument to∣wards
the seduction of his master.</P>
<P>Amusing himself with these and
other cogitations, our hero in the af∣ternoon
reached the place of his de∣stination;
and entering the inn where
Timothy had been left at sick quar∣ters,
chanced to meet the apothecary
retiring precipitately in a very unsa∣voury
pickle from the chamber of his
patient. When he enquired about
the health of his squire, this retainer
to medicine, wiping himself all the
while with a napkin, answered in ma∣nifest
confusion, That he apprehend∣ed
him to be in a very dangerous way,
from an inflammation of the <HI>pia mater,</HI>
which had produced a most furious
delirium. Then he proceeded to ex∣plain,
in technical terms, the method
of cure he had followed; and con∣cluded
with telling him the poor
squire's brain was so outrageously dis∣ordered,
that he had rejected all ad∣ministration,
and just thrown an uri∣nal
in his face.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79"/>
The knight's humanity being a∣larmed
at this intelligence, he re∣solved
that Crabshaw should have the
benefit of further advice, and asked
if there was not a physician in the
place. The apothecary, after some
interjections of hesitation, owned
there was a doctor in the village, an
odd sort of a humourist; but he be∣lieved
he had not much to do in the
way of his profession, and was not
much used to the forms of prescrip∣tion.
He was counted a scholar, to
be sure; but as to his medical capa∣city,—he
would not take upon
him to say—“No matter, (cried
Sir Launcelot) he may strike out
some lucky thought for the benefit of
the patient; and I desire you will call
him instantly.”—</P>
<P>While the apothecary was absent
on this service, our adventurer took
it in his head to question the landlord
about the character of this physician,
which had been so unfavourably re∣presented,
and received the following
information:</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="80"/>
“For my peart, measter, I knows
nothing amiss of the doctor—he's
a quiet sort of an inoffensive man;
uses my house sometimes, and pays
for what he has, like the rest of my
customers. They says he deals very
little in physic stuff, but cures his pa∣tients
with fasting and water-gruel,
whereby he can't expect the pothe∣cary
to be his friend. You knows,
master, one must live, and let live,
as the saying is. I must say, he, for
for the value of three guineas, set
up my wife's constitution in such a
manner, that I have saved within
these two years, I believe, forty pounds
in pothecary's bills. But what of
that? Every man must eat, tho'f at
another's expence; and I should be in
a deadly hole myself, if all my custo∣mers
should take it in their heads to
drink nothing but water-gruel, be∣cause
it is good for the constitution.
Thank God, I have as good a consti∣tution
as e'er a man in England; but
for all that, I and my whole family
bleed and purge and take a diet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>drink
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
twice a-year, by way of serving the
pothecary, who is a very honest man,
and a very good neighbour.”</P>
<P>Their conversation was interrupted
by the return of the apothecary with
the doctor, who had very little of the
faculty in his appearance. He was
dressed remarkably plain; seemed to
be turned of fifty; had a careless air,
and a sarcastical turn in his counte∣nance.
Before he entered the sick
man's chamber, he asked some que∣stions
concerning the disease; and
when the apothecary, pointing to his
own head, said, “It lies all here;”
the doctor, turning to Sir Launcelot,
replied, “If that be all, there's no∣thing
in it.”</P>
<P>Upon a more particular enquiry
about the symptoms, he was told that
the blood was seemingly viscous, and
salt upon the tongue; the urine re∣markably
acrosaline; and the faeces
atrabilious and foetid. When the
doctor said he would engage to find
the same phaenomena in every healthy
man of the three kingdoms; the apo∣thecary
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
added, that the patient was
manifestly comatous, and moreover
afflicted with griping pains and bor∣borygmata.—“A
f—t for your bor∣borygmata,
(cried the physician.)
What has been done?” To this que∣stion
he replied, that venaesection had
been three times performed: that a
vesicatory had been applied <HI>inter sca∣pulas:</HI>
that the patient had taken oc∣casionally
of a cathartic apozem, and,
between whiles, alexipharmic boluses
and neutral draughts.—“Neutral,
indeed, (said the doctor;) so neutral,
that I'll be crucified if ever they de∣clare
either for the patient or the dis∣ease.”
So saying, he brushed into
Crabshaw's chamber, followed by
our adventurer, who was almost suf∣focated
at his first entrance. The
day was close, the window-shutters
were fastened; a huge fire blazed in
the chimney; thick harateen curtains
were close drawn round the bed,
where the wretched squire lay extend∣ed
under an enormous load of blan∣kets.
The nurse, who had all the
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
exteriors of a bawd given to drink,
sat stewing in this apartment, like a
damned soul in some infernal bagnio:
but rising, when the company enter∣ed,
made her curtsies with great de∣corum.
“Well, (said the doctor)
how does your patient, nurse?”
“Blessed be God for it, I hope in a
fair way:—to be sure his apozem
has had a blessed effect—five and
twenty stools since three o'clock in
the morning.—But then a'would
not suffer the blisters to be put upon
his thighs.—Good lack! a'has been
mortally obstropolous, and out of his
senses all this blessed day.”—“You
lie, (cried the squire) I a'n't out of
my seven senses, thof I'm half mad
with vexation.”</P>
<P>The doctor having withdrawn the
curtain, the hapless squire appeared
very pale and ghastly; and having
surveyed his master with a rueful
aspect, addressed him in these words:
“Sir knight, I beg a boon: be pleas∣ed
to tie a stone about the neck of
the apothecary, and a halter about the
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
neck of the nurse, and throw the one
into the next river, and the other
over the next tree, and in so doing
you will do a charitable deed to your
fellow-creatures; for he and she do
the devil's work in partnership, and
have sent many score of their betters
home to him before their time.”
“Oh, he begins to talk sensibly.”
“Have a good heart, (said the phy∣sician.)
What is your disorder?”
“Physick. “What do you chiefly
complain of?” “The doctor.”
“Does your head ake?” “Yea,
with impertinence.” “Have you
a pain in your back?” “Yes, where
the blister lies.” “Are you sick at
stomach?” “Yes, with hunger.”
“Do you feel any shiverings?”
“Always at sight of the apothecary.”
“Do you perceive any load in your
bowels?” “I would the apothe∣cary's
conscience was as clear.” “Are
you thirsty?” “Not thirsty enough
to drink barley-water.” “Be pleased
to look into his fauces, (said the apo∣thecary:)
he has got a rough tongue,
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
and a very foul mouth, I'll assure you.”
“I have known that the case with
some limbs of the faculty, where
they stood more in need of correction
than of physick.—Well, my honest
friend, since you have already un∣dergone
the proper purgations in due
form, and say you have no other
disease than the doctor, we will set
you on your legs again, without fur∣ther
question. Here, nurse, open
that window, and throw these vials
into the street. Now lower the cur∣tain,
without shutting the casement,
that the man may not be stifled in his
own steam. In the next place, take
off two thirds of these coals, and one
third of these blankets.—How do'st
feel now, my heart?” “I should
feel heart-whole, if so be as yow
would throw the noorse a'ter the bot∣tles,
and the pothecary a'ter the noorse,
and oorder me a pound of chops for
my dinner; for I be so hoongry, I
could eat a horse behind the saddle.”</P>
<P>The apothecary, seeing what pas∣sed,
retired of his own accord, hold∣ing
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
up his hands in sign of astonish∣ment.
The nurse was dismissed in
the same breath. Crabshaw rose,
dressed himself without assistance, and
made a hearty meal on the first eatable
that presented itself to his view. The
knight passed the evening with the
physician, who, from his first appear∣ance,
concluded he was mad; but, in
the course of the conversation, found
means to resign that opinion, without
adopting any other in lieu of it, and
parted with him under all the impa∣tience
of curiosity. The knight, on
his part, was very well entertained
with the witty sarcasms and erudition
of the doctor, who appeared to be a
sort of cynic philosopher, tinctured
with misanthropy, and at open war
with the whole body of apothecaries,
whom, however, it was by no means
his interest to disoblige.</P>
<P>Next day, Crabshaw being to all
appearance perfectly recovered, our
adventurer reckoned with the apothe∣cary,
payed the landlord, and set out
on his return for the London road,
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
resolving to lay aside his armour at
some distance from the metropolis:
for, ever since his interview with Au∣relia,
his fondness for chivalry had
been gradually abating. As the tor∣rent
of his despair had disordered the
current of his sober reflection, so now,
as that despair subsided, his thoughts
began to flow deliberately in their an∣cient
channel. All day long he re∣galed
his imagination with plans of
connubial happiness, formed on the
possession of the incomparable Aure∣lia;
determined to wait with patience,
until the law should supersede the au∣thority
of her guardian, rather than a∣dopt
any violent expedient which might
hazard the interest of his passion.</P>
<P>He had for some time travelled in
the turnpike road, when his reverie
was suddenly interrupted by a con∣fused
noise; and when he lifted up
his eyes, he beheld at a little distance
a rabble of men and women, various∣ly
armed with flails, pitch-forks, poles,
and muskets, acting offensively against
a strange figure on horseback, who,
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
with a kind of lance, laid about him
with incredible fury. Our adventurer
was not so totally abandoned by the
spirit of chivalry, as to see without
emotion a single knight in danger of
being overpowered by such a multi∣tude
of adversaries. Without staying
to put on his helmet, he ordered
Crabshaw to follow him in the charge
against those plebeians: then couch∣ing
his lance, and giving Bronzomarte
the spur, he began his career with
such impetuosity as overturned all that
happened to be in his way; and inti∣midated
the rabble to such a degree,
that they retired before him like a
flock of sheep, the greater part of
them believing he was the devil <HI>in
propria persona.</HI> He came in the very
nick of time to save the life of the
other errant, against whom three
loaded muskets were actually levelled,
at the very instant that our adventurer
began his charge. The unknown
knight was so sensible of the seasona∣ble
interposition, that riding up to our
hero, “Brother, (said he) this is the
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
second time you have holp me off,
when I was bump ashore.—Bess
Mizen, I must say, is no more than
a leaky bumboat, in comparison of the
glorious galley you want to man. I
desire that henceforth we may cruise
in the same latitudes, brother; and
I'll be damned if I don't stand by you
as long as I have a stick standing, or
can carry a rag of canvas.”</P>
<P>By this address our knight recogni∣zed
the novice captain Crowe, who
had found means to accommodate
himself with a very strange suit of ar∣mour.
By way of helmet, he wore
one of the caps used by the light horse,
with straps buckled under his chin,
and contrived in such a manner as to
conceal his whole visage, except the
eyes. Instead of cuirass, mail, greaves,
and the other pieces of complete ar∣mour,
he was cased in a postilion's
leathern jerkin, covered with thin
plates of tinned iron: his buckler was
a potlid, his lance a hop-pole shod
with iron, and a basket-hilt broad
sword, like that of Hudibras, depen∣ded
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
by a broad buff belt, that girded
his middle. His feet were defended
by jack-boots, and his hands by the
gloves of a trooper. Sir Launcelot
would not lose time in examining par∣ticulars,
as he perceived some mischief
had been done, and that the enemy
had rallied at a distance: he therefore
commanded Crowe to follow him,
and rode off with great expedition;
but he did not perceive that his squire
was taken prisoner; nor did the cap∣tain
recollect that his nephew, Tom
Clarke, had been disabled and secured
in the beginning of the fray. The
truth is, the poor captain had been
so belaboured about the pate, that it
was a wonder he remembered his own
name.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing adventures of chivalry,
equally new and surprising.</HEAD>
<P>THE knight Sir Launcelot, and
the novice Crowe, retreated with
equal order and expedition to the di∣stance
of half a league from the field
of battle, where the former, halting,
proposed to make a lodgment in a
very decent house of entertainment,
distinguished by the sign of St. George
of Cappadocia encountering the dra∣gon,
an atchievement in which tem∣poral
and spiritual chivalry were hap∣pily
reconciled. Two such figures
alighting at the inn-gate, did not pass
through the yard unnoticed and un∣admired
by the guests and atten∣dants;
some of whom fairly took to
their heels, on the supposition that
these outlandish creatures were the
avant couriers, or haralds of a French
invasion. The fears and doubts,
however, of those who ventured to
stay were soon dispelled, when our
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
hero accosted them in the English
tongue, and with the most courte∣ous
demeanour desired to be shewn
into an apartment. Had captain
Crowe been the spokesman, perhaps
their suspicions would not have so
quickly subsided; for he was, in
reality, a very extraordinary novice,
not only in chivalry, but also in his
external appearance, and particu∣larly
in those dialects of the English
language which are used by the ter∣restrial
animals of this kingdom. He
desired the hostler to take his horse
in tow, and bring him to his moor∣ings
in a safe riding. He ordered the
waiter, who shewed them into a par∣lour,
to bear-a-hand, ship his oars,
mind his helm, and bring along-side
a short allowance of brandy or grog,
that he might cant a slug into his
bread-room; for there was such a
heaving and pitching, that he be∣lieved
he should shift his ballast.
The fellow understood no part of
this address but the word <HI>brandy,</HI> at
mention of which he disappeared.
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
Then Crowe, throwing himself into
an elbow-chair, “Stop my hawse-holes,
(cried he) I can't think what's
the matter, brother; but, agad, my
head sings and simmers like a pot of
chowder.—My eye-sight yaws to
and again, d'ye see:—then there's
such a walloping and whushing in my
hold—smite my—Lord have mercy
upon us.—Here you swab, ne'er mind
a glass—hand me the noggin.”</P>
<P>The latter part of this address
was directed to the waiter, who had
returned with a quartern of brandy,
which Crowe, snatching eagerly,
started into his bread-room at one
cant. Indeed there was no time to
be lost, inasmuch as he seemed to
be on the verge of fainting away
when he swallowed this cordial, by
which he was instantaneously re∣vived.
He then desired the servant
to unbuckle the straps of his helmet;
but this was a task which the drawer
could not perform, even though assist∣ed
with the good offices of Sir Laun∣celot:
for the head and jaws were
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
so much swelled with the discipline
they had undergone, that the straps
and buckles lay buried, as it were,
in pits formed by the tumefaction of
the adjacent parts. Fortunately for
the novice, a neighbouring surgeon
passed by the door on horseback; a
circumstance which the waiter, who
saw him from the window, no sooner
disclosed, than the knight had recourse
to his assistance. This practitioner
having viewed the whole figure, and
more particularly the head of Crowe,
in silent wonder, proceeded to feel
his pulse; and then declared, that as
the inflammation was very great,
and going on with violence to its
<HI>akme,</HI> it would be necessary to be∣gin
with copious phlebotomy, and
then to empty the intestinal canal.
So saying, he began to strip the arm
of the captain, who perceiving his
aim, “Avast, brother, (cried he)
you go the wrong way to work—you
may as well rummage the afterhold,
when the damage is in the forecastle.
—I shall right again, when my jaws
are unhooped.”</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95"/>
With these words he drew a clasp-knife
from his pocket, and, ad∣vancing
to a glass, applied it so vi∣gorously
to the leather straps of his
headpiece, that the Gordian-knot
was cut, without any other damage
to his face than a moderate scarifi∣cation,
which, added to the tume∣faction
of features, naturally strong,
and a whole week's growth of a very
bushy beard, produced, on the whole,
a most hideous caricatura. After all,
there was a necessity for the admini∣stration
of the surgeon, who found
divers contusions on different parts of
the skull, which even the tin-cap
had not been able to protect from the
weapons of the rusticks.</P>
<P>These being shaved, and dressed
<HI>secundum artem,</HI> and the operator dis∣missed
with a proper acknowledg∣ment,
our knight detached one of
the post-boys to the field of action
for intelligence, concerning Mr.
Clarke and squire Timothy; and,
in the interim, desired to know the
particulars of Crowe's adventures
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
since he parted from him at the
White Hart. A connected relation,
in plain English, was what he had
little reason to expect from the no∣vice,
who, nevertheless, exerted his
faculties to the uttermost for his
satisfaction: he gave him to under∣stand,
that in steering his course to
Birmingham, where he thought of
fitting himself with tackle, he had
fallen in, by accident, at a public
house, with an itinerant tinker, in
the very act of mending a kettle:
that, seeing him do his business like
an able workman, he had applied to
him for advice; and the tinker, af∣ter
having considered the subject, had
undertaken to make him such a suit
of armour as neither sword nor lance
should penetrate: that they adjourn∣ed
to the next town, where the lea∣ther
coat, the plates of tinned iron,
the lance, and the broad sword, were
purchased, together with a copper
sauce-pan, which the artist was now
at work upon, in converting it to a
shield: but, in the mean time, the
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
captain, being impatient to begin his
career of chivalry, had accommodat∣ed
himself with a pot-lid, and taken
to the highway, notwithstanding all
the intreaties, tears, and remonstran∣ces
of his nephew Tom Clarke, who
could not however be prevailed upon
to leave him in the dangerous voyage
he had undertaken: that this being
but the second day of his journal, he
descried five or six men on horseback,
bearing up full in his teeth; upon
which he threw his sails a-back, and
prepared for action: that he hailed
them at a considerable distance, and
bad them bring-to: when they came
along-side, notwithstanding his hail,
he ordered them to clew up their
corses, and furl their topsails, other∣wise
he would be foul of their quar∣ters:
that, hearing this salute, they
luffed all at once, till their cloth
shook in the wind: then he hollow∣ed
in a loud voice, that his sweetheart
Besselia Mizzen wore the broad pen∣dant
of beauty, to which they must
strike their topsails, on pain of being
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
sent to the bottom: that, after having
eyed him for some time with asto∣nishment,
they clapped on all their
sails, some of them running under
his stern, and others athwart his fore∣foot,
and got clear off: that, not
satisfied with running a-head, they
all of a sudden tacked about, and
one of them boarding him on the
lee-quarter, gave him such a drub∣bing
about his upper works, that the
lights danced in his lanthorns: that
he returned the salute with his hop∣pole
so effectually, that his aggressor
broached-to in the twinkling of an
hand-spike; and then he was en∣gaged
with all the rest of the enemy,
except one who sheered off, and soon
returned with a mosqueto fleet of
small craft, who had done him con∣siderable
damage, and, in all pro∣bability,
would have made prize of
him, hadn't he been brought off by
the knight's gallantry. He said, that
in the beginning of the conflict Tom
Clarke rode up to the foremost of the
enemy, as he did suppose, in order
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
to prevent hostilities; but before he
got up to him, near enough to hold
discourse, he was pooped with a sea
that almost sent him to the bottom,
and then towed off he knew not whi∣ther.</P>
<P>Crowe had scarce finished his nar∣ration,
which consisted of broken
hints, and unconnected explosions of
sea-terms, when a gentleman of the
neighbourhood, who acted in the
commission of the peace, arrived at
the gate, attended by a constable,
who had in custody the bodies of
Thomas Clarke and Timothy Crab∣shaw,
surrounded by five men on
horseback, and an innumerable posse
of men, women, and children, on
foot. The captain, who always kept
a good look out, no sooner descried
this cavalcade and procession than he
gave notice to Sir Launcelot, and ad∣vised
that they should crowd away
with all the cloth they could carry.
Our adventurer was of another opi∣nion,
and determined at any rate to
procure the enlargement of the pri∣soners.
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
The justice, ordering his attend∣ants
to stay without the gate, sent his
compliments to Sir Launcelot Greaves,
and desired to speak with him for a
few minutes. He was immediately
admitted, and could not help starting
at sight of Crowe, who, by this time,
had no remains of the human phy∣siognomy,
so much was the swelling
increased and the skin discoloured.
The gentleman, whose name was
Mr. Elmy, having made a polite apo∣logy
for the liberty he had taken,
proceeded to unfold his business. He
said, information had been lodged
with him, as a justice of the peace,
against two armed men on horseback,
who had stopped five farmers on the
king's highway, put them in fear
and danger of their lives, and even
assaulted, maimed, and wounded di∣vers
persons, contrary to the king's
peace; and in violation of the statute:
that, by the description, he supposed
the knight and his companion to be
the persons against whom the com∣plaint
had been lodged; and under∣standing
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
his quality from Mr. Clarke,
whom he had known in London, he
was come to wait on him, and, if
possible, effect an accommodation.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, having thanked
him for the polite and obliging man∣ner
in which he proceeded, frankly
told him the whole story, as it had
been just related by the captain; and
Mr. Elmy had no reason to doubt
the truth of the narrative, as it con∣firmed
every circumstance which
Clarke had before reported. Indeed,
Tom had been very communicative
to this gentleman, and made him ac∣quainted
with the whole history of
Sir Launcelot Greaves, as well as with
the whimsical resolution of his uncle,
capt. Crowe. Mr. Elmy now told the
knight, that the persons whom the
captain had stopped were farmers, re∣turning
from a neighbouring market,
a set of people naturally boorish, and
at that time elevated with ale to an
uncommon pitch of insolence: that
one of them, in particular, called
Prickle, was the most quarrelsome
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
fellow in the whole county; and so
litigious, that he had maintained
above thirty law-suits, in eight and
twenty of which he had been con∣demned
in costs. He said the others
might be easily influenced in the way
of admonition; but there was no
way of dealing with Prickle, except
by the form and authority of the
law: he therefore proposed to hear
evidence in a judicial capacity, and,
his clerk being in attendance, the
court was immediately opened in the
knight's apartment.</P>
<P>By this time Mr. Clarke had made
such good use of his time in explain∣ing
the law to his audience, and dis∣playing
the great wealth and un∣bounded
liberality of Sir Launcelot
Greaves, that he had actually brought
over to his sentiments the constable
and the commonalty, tag, rag, and
bob-tail, and even staggered the ma∣jority
of the farmers, who, at first,
had breathed nothing but defiance
and revenge. Farmer Stake, being
first called to the bar, and sworn,
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
touching the identity of Sir Launce∣lot
Greaves and captain Crowe, de∣clared,
that the said Crowe had stop∣ped
him on the king's highway, and
put him in bodily fear: that he af∣terwards
saw the said Crowe with a
pole or weapon, value three pence,
breaking the king's peace, by com∣mitting
assault and battery against the
heads and shoulders of his majesty's
liege subjects, Geoffrey Prickle, Hodge
Dolt, Richard Bumpkin, Mary Fang,
Catherine Rubble, and Margery Lit∣ter;
and that he saw Sir Launcelot
Greaves, baronet, aiding, assisting, and
comforting the said Crowe, contrary
to the king's peace, and against the
form of the statute.</P>
<P>Being asked if the defendant, when
he stopped them, demanded their
money, or threatened violence, he
answered, he could not say, inasmuch
as the defendant spoke in an unknown
language. Being interrogated if the
defendant did not allow them to pass
without using any violence, and if
they did not pass unmolested, the de∣ponent
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
replied in the affirmative:
being required to tell for what reason
they returned, and if the defendant
Crowe was not assaulted before he be∣gan
to use his weapon, the deponent
made no answer. The depositions of
farmer Bumpkin and Muggins, as well
as of Madge Litter and Mary Fang,
were taken much to the same pur∣pose;
and his worship earnestly ex∣horted
them to an accommodation,
observing, that they themselves were
in fact the aggressors, and that captain
Crowe had done no more than ex∣erted
himself in his own defence.</P>
<P>They were all pretty well disposed
to follow his advice, except farmer
Prickle, who, entering the court with
a bloody handkerchief about his head,
declared, that the law should deter∣mine
it at next 'size; and in the mean
time insisted, that the defendants
should find immediate bail, or go to
prison, or be set in the stocks. He
affirmed, that they had been guilty
of an <HI>affray,</HI> in appearing with ar∣mour
and weapons not usually worn,
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
to the terror of others, which is in
itself a breach of the peace: but that
they had, moreover, with force of
arms, that is to say, with swords,
staves, and other warlike instruments,
by turns, made an assault and <HI>affray,</HI>
to the terror and disturbance of him
and divers subjects of our lord the
king then and there being, and to
the evil and pernicious example of the
liege people of the said lord the king,
and against the peace of our said lord
the king, his crown and dignity.</P>
<P>This peasant had purchased a few
law-terms at a considerable expence,
and he thought he had a right to turn
his knowledge to the annoyance of
all his neighbours. Mr. Elmy, find∣ing
him obstinately deaf to all pro∣posals
of accommodation, held the
defendants to very moderate bail,
the landlord and the curate of the pa∣rish
freely offering themselves as sure∣ties.
Mr. Clarke, with Timothy
Crabshaw, against whom nothing ap∣peared,
were now set at liberty;
when the former, advancing to his
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
worship, gave information against
Geoffrey Prickle, and declared upon
oath, that he had seen him assault
captain Crowe, without any provo∣cation;
and when he, the deponent,
interposed to prevent further mischief,
the said Prickle had likewise assaulted
and wounded him the deponent, and
detained him for some time in false
imprisonment, without warrant or
authority.</P>
<P>In consequence of this information,
which was corroborated by divers evi∣dences,
selected from the mob at the
gate, the tables were turned upon
farmer Prickle, who was given to
understand, that he must either find
bail, or be forthwith imprisoned.
This <HI>honest</HI> boor, who was in opulent
circumstances, had made such popular
use of the benefits he possessed, that
there was not an housekeeper in the
parish who would not have rejoiced to
see him hanged. His dealings and
connections however were such, that
none of the other four would have
refused to bail him, had not Clarke
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
given them to understand, that, if
they did, he would make them all
principals and parties, and have two
separate actions against each. Prickle
happened to be at variance with the
inn-keeper, and the curate durst not
disoblige the vicar, who at that very
time was suing the farmer for the
small tythes. He offered to deposit a
sum equal to the recognizance of the
knight's bail; but this was rejected as
an expedient contrary to the practice
of the courts. He sent for the attor∣ney
of the village, to whom he had
been a good customer; but the lawyer
was hunting evidence in another coun∣ty.
The exci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eman presented him∣self
as a surety; but he not being
an housekeeper, was not accepted.
Divers cottagers, who depended on
farmer Prickle, were successively re∣fused,
because they could not prove
that they had payed scot and lot, and
parish taxes.</P>
<P>The farmer, finding himself thus
forlorn, and in imminent danger of
visiting the inside of a prison, was
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
seized with paroxysm of rage; during
which he inveighed against the bench,
reviled the two adventurers errant,
declared that he believed, and would
lay a wager of twenty guineas, that
he had more money in his pocket than
e'er a man in the company; and in
the space of a quarter of an hour
swore forty oaths, which the justice
did not fail to number. “Before we
proceed to other matters, (said Mr.
Elmy) I order you to pay forty shil∣lings
for the oaths you have swore;
otherwise I will cause you to be set in
the stocks, without further cere∣mony.”</P>
<P>Prickle, throwing down a couple
of guineas, with two execrations more
to make up the sum, declared, that
he could afford to pay for swearing as
well as e'er a justice in the county;
and repeated his challenge of the
wager, which our adventurer now
accepted, protesting, at the same time
that it was not a step taken from
any motive of pride, but intirely with
a view to punish an insolent plebeian,
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
who could not otherwise be chastised
without a breach of the peace.
Twenty guineas being deposited on
each side in the hands of Mr. Elmy,
Prickle, with equal confidence and
dispatch, produced a canvas bag, con∣taining
two hundred and seventy
pounds, which, being spread upon
the table, made a very formidable
shew, that dazzled the eyes of the
beholders, and induced many of
them to believe he had ensured his
conquest.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, asking if he had
any thing further to offer, and being an∣swered
in the negative, drew forth, with
great deliberation, a pocket-book, in
which there was a considerable parcel
of bank-notes, from which he select∣ed
three of one hundred pounds each,
and exhibited them upon the table,
to the astonishment of all present.
Prickle, mad with his overthrow and
loss, said it might be necessary to
make him prove the notes were ho∣nestly
come by; and Sir Launcelot
started up, in order to take vengeance
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
upon him for this insult; but was with∣held
by the arms and remonstrances
of Mr. Elmy, who assured him that
Prickle desired nothing so much as
another broken head, to lay the foun∣dation
of a new prosecution.</P>
<P>The knight, calmed by this inter∣position,
turned to the audience, say∣ing,
with the most affable deportment,
“Good people, do not imagine that I
intend to pocket the spoils of such a
contemptible rascal. I shall beg the
favour of this worthy gentleman to
take up these twenty guineas, and dis∣tribute
them as he shall think proper,
among the poor of the parish: but,
by this benefaction, I do not hold my∣self
acquitted for the share I had in
the bruises some of you have re∣ceived
in this unlucky fray; and there∣fore
I give the other twenty guineas
to be divided among the sufferers, to
each according to the damage he or
she shall appear to have sustained;
and I shall consider it as an additional
obligation, if Mr. Elmy will likewise
superintend this retribution.”</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111"/>
At the close of this address, the
whole yard and gate-way rung with
acclamation: while honest Crowe,
whose generosity was not inferior even
to that of the accomplished Greaves,
pulled out his purse, and declared, that
as he had begun the engagement, he
would at least go share and share alike
in new caulking their seams and re∣pairing
their timbers. The knight, ra∣ther
than enter into a dispute with his
novice, told him, he considered the
twenty guineas as given by them both
in conjunction, and that they would
confer together on that subject here∣after.</P>
<P>This point being adjusted, Mr. El∣my
assumed all the solemnity of the
magistrate, and addressed himself to
Prickle in these words: “Farmer
Prickle, I am both sorry and ashamed
to see a man of your years and cir∣cumstances
so little respected, that you
cannot find sufficient bail for forty
pounds; a sure testimony that you
have neither cultivated the friendship,
nor deserved the good will of your
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
neighbours. I have heard of your
quarrels and your riots, your inso∣lence,
and litigious disposition; and
often wished for an opportunity of
giving you a proper taste of the law's
correction. That opportunity now
offers—You have in the hearing of
all these people poured forth a torrent
of abuse against me, both in the cha∣racter
of a gentleman and of a ma∣gistrate:
your abusing me personally,
perhaps I should have overlooked with
the contempt it deserves; but I should
ill vindicate the dignity of my office
as magistrate, by suffering you to in∣sult
the bench with impunity. I shall
therefore imprison you for contempt;
and you shall remain in jail, until you
can find bail on the other prosecu∣tions.”</P>
<P>Prickle, the first transports of his
anger having subsided, began to be
pricked with the thorns of compunc∣tion.
He was indeed exceedingly mor∣tified
at the prospect of being sent to
jail so disgracefully. His countenance
fell, and, after a hard internal struggle,
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
while the clerk was employed in writing
the mittimus, he said he hoped his wor∣ship
would not send him to prison.
He begged pardon of him and our ad∣venturers,
for having abused them in
his passion; and observed, that as he
had received a broken head, and payed
two and twenty guineas for his folly,
he could not be said to have escaped
altogether without punishment, even if
the plaintiff should agree to exchange
releases.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, seeing this stubborn
rustic effectually humbled, became an
advocate in his favour with Mr. Elmy
and Tom Clarke, who forgave him at
his request; and a mutual release be∣ing
executed, the farmer was permit∣ted
to depart. The populace were
regaled at our adventurer's expence;
and the men, women, and children,
who had been wounded or bruised in
the battle, to the number of ten or a
dozen, were desired to wait upon Mr.
Elmy in the morning, to receive the
knight's bounty. The justice was
prevailed upon to spend the evening
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
with Sir Launcelot and his two com∣panions,
for whom supper was be∣spoke;
but the first thing the cook
prepared was a poultice for Crowe's
head, which was now enlarged to a
monstrous exhibition. Our knight,
who was all kindness and complacen∣cy,
shook Mr. Clarke by the hand,
expressing his satisfaction at meeting
with his old friends again, and told
him softly that he had compliments
for him from Mrs. Dolly Cowslip,
who now lived with his Aurelia.</P>
<P>Clarke was confounded at this in∣telligence,
and after some hesitation,
“Lord bless my soul! (cried he) I'll
be shot then if the pretended Miss
Meadows wa'n't the same as Miss
Darnel!” He then declared himself
extremely glad that poor Dolly had
got into such an agreeable situation,
passed many warm encomiums on her
goodness of heart and virtuous incli∣nations,
and concluded with appeal∣ing
to the knight whether she did not
look very pretty in her green Joseph.
In the mean time, he procured a
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
plaister for his own head, and helped
to apply the poultice to that of his un∣cle,
who was sent to bed betimes with
a moderate dose of sack-whey, to pro∣mote
perspiration. The other three
passed the evening to their mutual sa∣tisfaction;
and the justice in particu∣lar
grew enamoured of the knight's
character, dashed as it was with ex∣travagance.</P>
<P>Let us now leave them to the en∣joyment
of a sober and rational con∣versation,
and give some account of
other guests who arrived late in the
evening, and here fixed their night-quarters—But
as we have already
trespassed on the reader's patience we

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the Rave of Chivalry shine
with renovated Lustre.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero little dreamed that he
had a formidable rival in the
person of the knight who arrived
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
about eleven at the sign of the St.
George, and, by the noise he made,
gave intimation of his importance.
This was no other than squire Syca∣more,
who, having received advice
that Miss Aurelia Darnel had eloped
from the place of her retreat, imme∣diately
took the field, in quest of that
lovely fugitive; hoping that, should
he have the good fortune to find her
in her present distress, his good offices
would not be rejected. He had fol∣lowed
the chace so close, that, imme∣diately
after our adventurer's depar∣ture,
he alighted at the inn from
whence Aurelia had been conveyed;
and there he learned the particulars
which we have related above. Mr.
Sycamore had a great deal of the
childish romantic in his disposition,
and, in the course of his amours, is
said to have always taken more plea∣sure
in the pursuit than in the final
possession. He had heard of Sir Laun∣celot's
extravagance, by which he was
in some measure infected; and he
dropped an insinuation, that he could
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
eclipse his rival even in his own luna∣tic
spere. This hint was not lost up∣on
his companion, counsellor, and
buffoon, the facetious Davy Dawdle,
who had some humour and a great
deal of mischief in his composition.
He looked upon his patron as a fool,
and his patron knew him to be both
knave and fool: yet the two characters
suited each other so well, that they
could hardly exist asunder. Davy was
an artful sycophant, but he did not
flatter in the usual way; on the con∣trary,
he behaved <HI>en cavalier,</HI> and
treated Sycamore, on whose bounty
he subsisted, with the most sarcastic
familiarity. Nevertheless, he seasoned
his freedom with certain qualifying
ingredients that subdued the bitterness
of it, and was now become so neces∣sary
to the squire, that he had no
idea of enjoyment with which Dawdle
was not some how or other connec∣ted.
There had been a warm dis∣pute
betwixt them about the scheme
of contesting the prize with Sir Laun∣celot
in the lists of chivalry. Syca∣more
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
more had insinuated, that if he had
a mind to play the fool, he could
wear armour, wield a launce, and
manage a charger, as well as Sir
Launcelot Greaves. Dawdle snatch∣ing
the hint, “I had some time ago,
(said he) contrived a scheme for you,
which I was afraid you had not ad∣dress
enough to execute—It would
be no difficult matter, in imitation of
the batchelor Sampson Carrasco, to go
in quest of Greaves as a knight errant,
defy him as a rival, and establish a
compact, by which the vanquished
should obey the injunctions of the
victor.”—“That is my very idea.”
cried Sycamore) “Your idea, (replied
the other) had you ever an idea of
your own conception?”—Thus the
dispute began, and was maintained
with great vehemence; until other ar∣guments
failing, the squire offered to
lay a wager of twenty guineas. To
this proposal Dawdle answered by the
interjection <HI>Pish!</HI> which inflamed Sy∣camore
to a repetition of the de∣fiance.”
—“You are in the right (said
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
Dawdle) to use such an argument, as
you know is by me unanswerable. A
wager of twenty guineas will at any
time overthrow and confute all the
logick of the most able syllogist, who
has not got a shilling in his pocket.”</P>
<P>Sycamore looked very grave at this
declaration, and, after a short pause,
said, “I wonder, Dawdle, what you
do with all your money!” “I am
surprised you should give yourself that
trouble—I never ask what you do
with yours.”—“You have no occa∣sion
to ask: you know pretty well how
it goes.” What! do you upbraid me
with your favours?—'tis mighty well,
Sycamore.”—“Nay, Dawdle, I did
not intend to affront.”—“Z—s! af∣front!
what d'ye mean?”—“I'll as∣sure
you, Davy, you don't know me,
if you think I could be so ungenerous
as to—a—to—” “I always thought,
whatever faults or foibles you might
have, Sycamore, that you was not de∣ficient
in generosity,—tho' to be sure it
is often very absurdly displayed.” “Ay,
that's one of my greatest foibles: I
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
can't refuse even a scoundrel, when I
think he is in want.—Here, Dawdle,
take that note.”—“Not I, sir,—what
d'ye mean?—what right have I to
your notes.” “Nay, but Dawdle,—come.”—“By
no means,—It looks
like the abuse of good nature,—all the
world knows you're good-natured to
a fault.”—“Come, dear Davy, you
shall—you must oblige me.”—Thus
urged, Dawdle accepted the bank note
with great reluctance, and restored the
idea to the right owner.</P>
<P>A suit of armour being brought
from the garret or armoury of his an∣cestors,
he gave orders for having the
pieces scoured and furbished up; and
his heart dilated with joy, when he
reflected upon the superb figure he
should make when cased in complete
steel, and armed at all points for the
combat.</P>
<P>When he was fitted with the other
parts, Dawdle insisted on buckling on
his helmet, which weighed fifteen
pounds, and the head-piece being ad∣justed,
made such a clatter about his
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
ears with a cudgel, that his eyes had
almost started from their sockets. His
voice was lost within the vizor, and
his friend affected not to understand
his meaning when he made signs with
his gauntlets, and endeavoured to close
with him, that he might wrest the
cudgel from his hand. At length he
desisted, saying, “I'll warrant the hel∣met
sound, by its ringing;” and tak∣ing
it off, found the squire in a cold
sweat. He would have atchieved
his first exploit on the spot, had his
strength permitted him to assault
Dawdle; but, what with want of air,
and the discipline he had undergone,
he had well nigh swooned away; and
before he retrieved the use of his mem∣bers,
he was appeased by the apologies
of his companion, who protested he
meant nothing more than to try if the
helmet was free of cracks, and whe∣ther
or not it would prove a good pro∣tection
for the head it covered. His
excuses were accepted: the armour
was packed up, and next morning
Mr. Sycamore set out from his own
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
house, accompanied by Dawdle, who
undertook to perform the part of his
squire at the approaching combat. He
was also attended by a servant on
horseback, who had charge of the ar∣mour,
and another who blowed the
trumpet. They no sooner understood
that our hero was housed at the
George, than the trumpeter sounded
a charge, which alarmed Sir Launce∣lot
and his company, and disturbed
honest captain Crowe in the middle of
his first sleep. Their next step was
to pen a challenge, which, when the
stranger departed, was by the trum∣peter
delivered with great ceremony
into the hands of Sir Launcelot, who
read it in these words: “To the
knight of the Crescent, greeting.
Whereas I am informed you have the
presumption to lay claim to the heart
of the peerless Aurelia Darnel, I give
you notice that I can admit no rival∣ship
in the affection of that paragon of
beauty; and I expect that you will
either resign your pretensions, or-make
it appear in single combat, according
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
to the law of arms, and the institu∣tions
of chivalry, that you are worthy
to dispute her favour with him of the
Griffin. POLYDORE.”</P>
<P>Our adventurer was not a little sur∣prised
at this address, which, howe∣ver,
he pocketed in silence; and be∣gan
to reflect, not without mortifica∣tion,
that he was treated as a lunatic
by some person who wanted to amuse
himself with the infirmities of his fel∣low
creatures. Mr. Thomas Clarke,
who saw the ceremony with which
the letter was delivered, and the emo∣tions
with which it was read, hied
him to the kitchen for intelligence,
and there learned that the stranger
was squire Sycamore. He forthwith
comprehended the nature of the bil∣let,
and, in the apprehension that
bloodshed would ensue, resolved to
alarm his uncle, that he might assist
in keeping the peace. He according∣ly
entered the apartment of the captain,
who had been waked by the trum∣pet,
and now peevishly asked the
meaning of that damned piping, as
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
if all hands were called upon deck.
Clarke having imparted what he knew
of the transaction, together with his
own conjectures, the captain said, he
did not suppose as how they would
engage by candle-light; and that for
his own part he should turn out in
the larboard watch, long enough be∣fore
any signals could be hove out for
forming the line. With this assurance
the lawyer retired to his nest, where
he did not fail to dream of Mrs. Dol∣ly
Cowslip; while Sir Launcelot pas∣sed
the night awake, in ruminating on
the strange challenge he had received.
He had got notice that the sender was
Mr. Sycamore, and hesitated with
himself whether he should not punish
him for his impertinence: but when
he reflected on the nature of the dis∣pute,
and the serious consequences it
might produce, he resolved to decline
the combat, as a trial of right and me∣rit,
founded upon absurdity. Even
in his maddest hours, he never adopt∣ed
those maxims of knight-erran∣try
which related to challenges. He
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
always perceived the folly and wicked∣ness
of defying a man to mortal fight,
because he did not like the colour of
his beard, or the complexion of his
mistress; or of deciding by homicide,
whether he or his rival deserved the
preference, when it was the lady's
prerogative to determine which should
be the happy lover. It was his opi∣nion
that chivalry was an useful insti∣tution
while confined to its original
purposes of protecting the innocent,
assisting the friendless, and bringing
the guilty to condign punishment:
but he could not conceive how these
laws should be answered by violating
every suggestion of reason, and every
precept of humanity. Captain Crowe
did not examine the matter so philo∣sophically.
He took it for granted
that in the morning the two knights
would come to action, and slept sound
on that supposition. But he rose be∣fore
it was day, resolved to be some
how concerned in the fray; and un∣derstanding
that the stranger had a
companion, set him down immediate∣ly
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
for his own antagonist. So impa∣tient
was he to establish this secondary
contest, that by day-break he entered
the chamber of Dawdle, to which he
was directed by the waiter, and roused
him with a hilloah, that might have
been heard at the distance of half a
league. Dawdle, startled by this ter∣rific
sound, sprung out of bed, and
stood upright on the floor, before he
opened his eyes upon the object by
which he had been so dreadfully
alarmed. But when he beheld the
head of Crowe, so swelled and swa∣thed,
so livid, hideous, and griefly,
with a broad sword by his side, and a
case of pistols in his girdle, he believed
it was the apparition of some mur∣thered
man; his hair bristled up, his
teeth chattered, and his knees knock∣ed;
he would have prayed, but his
tongue denied its office. Crowe see∣ing
his perturbation, “May-hap,
friend, said he, you take me for a
buccaneer: but I am no such per∣son.—My
name it is captain Crowe.—I
come not for your silver nor your
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
gold; your rigging nor your stowage;
but hearing as how your friend in∣tends
to bring my friend Sir Launce∣lot
Greaves to action, d'ye see; I de∣sire
in the way of friendship, that,
while they are engaged, you and I, as
their seconds, may lie board and board
for a few glasses, to divert one ano∣ther,
d'ye see.” Dawdle hearing this
request, began to retrieve his facul∣ties,
and throwing himself into the
attitude of Hamlet, when the ghost
appears, exclaimed in theatrical ac∣cent,
“Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!—Art thou a spirit of
grace, or goblin damn'd?”—As he
seemed to bend his eye on vacancy,
the captain began to think that he
really saw something preternatural,
and stared wildly around. Then ad∣dressing
himself to the terrified Daw∣dle,
“Damn'd, (said he) for what
should I be damn'd? If you are afeard
of goblins, brother, put your trust in
the Lord, and he'll prove a sheet-an∣chor
to you.” The other having by
this time recollected himself perfect∣ly,
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
continued, notwithstanding, to
spout tragedy, and in the words of
Macbeth pronounced,</P>
<LG>
<L>“What man dare, I dare:</L>
<L>Approach thou like the rugged Rus∣sian
bear,</L>
<L>The armed rhinoceros, or Hyrca∣nian
tyger;</L>
<L>Take any shape but that, and my
firm nerves</L>
<L>Shall never tremble.”—</L>
</LG>
<P>“'Ware names, Jack, (cried the im∣patient
mariner) if so be as how you'll
bear a hand and rig yourself, and take
a short trip with me into the offing,
we'll overhaul this here affair in the
turning of a capstan.”</P>
<P>At this juncture they were joined
by Mr. Sycamore in his night-gown
and slippers. Disturbed by Crowe's
first salute he had sprung up, and now
expressed no small astonishment at
first sight of the novice's countenance.
After having gazed alternately at him
and Dawdle, “Who have we got
here, said he, raw head and bloody
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
bones?” when his friend, slipping on
his cloaths, gave him to understand
that this was a friend of Sir Launce∣lot
Greaves, and explained the pur∣port
of his errant, he treated him with
more civility. He assured him that
he should have the pleasure to break
a spear with Mr. Dawdle; and signi∣fied
his surprize that Sir Launcelot had
made no answer to his letter. It be∣ing
by this time clear day-light, and
Crowe extremely interested in this af∣fair,
he broke without ceremony in∣to
the knight's chamber, and told him
abruptly that the enemy had brought
to, and waited for his coming up, in
order to begin the action. “I've
hailed his confort, said he, a sham∣bling
chattering fellow: he took me
first for a hobgoblin, then called me
names, a tyger, a wrynose o'ross, and
a Persian bear; but egad, if I come
athwart him, I'll make him look like
the bear and ragged staff before we
part.—I wool.—”</P>
<P>This intimation was not received
with that alacrity which the captain
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
expected to find in our adventurer,
who told him in a peremptory tone,
that he had no design to come to ac∣tion,
and desired to be left to his re∣pose.
Crowe forthwith retired crest-fallen,
and muttered something which
was never distinctly heard.</P>
<P>About eight in the morning Mr.
Dawdle brought him a formal mes∣sage
from the knight of the Griffin,
desiring he would appoint the lists,
and give security of the field. To
which request he made answer in a
very composed and solemn accent,
“If the person who sent you thinks
I have injured him, let him without
disguise, or any such ridiculous cere∣mony,
explain the nature of the
wrong; and then I shall give such
satisfaction as may suit my conscience
and my character. If he hath be∣stowed
his affection upon any particu∣lar
object, and looks upon me as a
favoured rival, I shall not wrong the
lady so much as to take any step that
may prejudice her choice, especially
a step that contradicts my own reason
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
as much as it would outrage the laws
of my country. If he who calls him∣self
knight of the Griffin is really de∣sirous
of treading in the paths of true
chivalry, he will not want opportu∣nities
of signalizing his valour in the
cause of virtue.—Should he, notwith∣standing
this declaration, offer vio∣lence
to me in the course of my occa∣sions,
he will always find me in a
posture of defence: or, should he
persist in repeating his importunities,
I shall without ceremony chastise the
messenger.” His declining the com∣bat
was interpreted into fear by Mr.
Sycamore, who now became more in∣solent
and ferocious, on the supposi∣tion
of our knight's timidity. Sir
Launcelot mean while went to break∣fast
with his friends, and having put
on his armour, ordered the horses to
be brought forth. Then he payed
the bill, and walking deliberately to
the gate, in presence of squire Syca∣more
and his attendants, vaulted at
one spring into the saddle of Bronzo∣marte,
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
whose neighing and curvet∣ting
proclaimed the joy he felt in
being mounted by his accomplished
master.</P>
<P>Though the knight of the Griffin
did not think proper to insult his
rival personally, his friend Dawdle
did not fail to crack some jokes on
the figure and horsemanship of Crowe,
who again declared he should be glad
to fall in with him upon the voyage:
nor did Mr. Clarke's black patch and
rueful countenance pass unnoticed and
unridiculed. As for Timothy Crab∣shaw,
he beheld his brother squire
with the contempt of a veteran: and
Gilbert payed him his compliments
with his heels at parting: but when
our adventurer and his retinue were
clear of the 'inn, Mr. Sycamore or∣dered
his trumpeter to sound a re∣treat,
by way of triumph over his an∣tagonist.
Perhaps he would have
contented himself with this kind of
victory, had not Dawdle further in∣flamed
his envy and ambition, by
launching out in praise of Sir Launce∣lot,
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
He observed that his counte∣nance
was open and manly; his joints
strong knit, and his form unexception∣able;
that he trod like Hercules, and
vaulted into the saddle like a winged
Mercury: nay, he even hinted it was
lucky for Sycamore that the knight
of the Crescent happened to be so
pacifically disposed. His patron sick∣ened
at these praises, and took fire at
the last observation. He affected to
undervalue personal beauty, though
the opinion of the world had been
favourable to himself in that parti∣cular:
he said he was at least two
inches taller than Greaves; and as
to shape and air, he would make
no comparisons; but with respect to
riding, he was sure he had a better
seat than Sir Launcelot, and would
wager five hundred to fifty guineas,
that he would unhorse him at the first
encounter. “There is no occasion
for laying wagers, replied Mr. Daw∣dle,
the doubt may be determined in
half an hour—Sir Launcelot is not a
man to avoid you at full gallop.”
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
Sycamore, after some hesitation, de∣clared
he would follow and provoke
him to battle, on condition that
Dawdle would engage Crowe; and
this condition was accepted: for,
though Davy had no stomach to the
tryal, he could not readily find an
excuse for declining it: besides, he
had discovered the captain to be a
very bad horseman, and resolved to
eke out his own scanty valour with a
border of ingenuity. The servants
were immediately ordered to unpack
the armour, and, in a little time,
Mr. Sycamore made a very formi∣dable
appearance. But the scene
that followed is too important to be
huddled in at the end of a chapter;
and therefore we shall reserve it for
a more conspicuous place in these
memoirs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing the atchievements of the
knights of the Griffin and Crescent.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sycamore, alias the knight
of the Griffin, so denominated
from a griffin painted on his shield,
being armed at all points, and his
friend Dawdle provided with a certain
implement, which he flattered him∣self
would ensure a victory over the
novice Crowe; they set out from the
George, with their attendants, in all
the elevation of hope, and pranced
along the highway that led towards
London, that being the road which
our adventurer pursued. As they
were extremely well mounted, and
proceeded at a round pace, they, in
less than two hours, came up with
Sir Launcelot and his company;
and Sycamore sent another formal
defiance to the knight, by his trum∣peter,
Dawdle having for good rea∣sons,
declined that office.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136"/>
Our adventurer hearing himself
thus addressed, and seeing his rival,
who had passed him, posted to ob∣struct
his progress, armed capapie,
with his lance in the rest; determined
to give the satisfaction that was requir∣ed,
and desired that the regulations of
the combat might be established. The
knight of the Griffin proposed, that
the vanquished party should resign all
pretensions to Miss Aurelia Darnel, in
favour of the victor; that while the
principals were engaged, his friend
Dawdle should run a tilt with captain
Crowe; that squire Crabshaw, and
Mr. Sycamore's servant, should keep
themselves in readiness to assist their
respective masters occasionally, ac∣cording
to the law of arms; and that
Mr. Clarke should observe the motions
of the trumpeter, whose province was
to sound the charge to battle.</P>
<P>Our knight agreed to these regula∣tions,
notwithstanding the earnest and
pathetic remonstrances of the young
lawyer, who, with tears in his eyes,
conjured all the combatants, in their
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
turns, to refrain from an action that
might be attended with bloodshed
and murder; and was contrary to the
laws both of God and man. In vain
he endeavoured to move them by
tears and entreaties, by threatning
them with prosecutions in this world,
and pains and penalties in the next:
they persisted in their resolution, and
his uncle would have begun hostilities
on his carcase, had not he been pre∣vented
by Sir Launcelot, who ex∣horted
Clarke to retire from the field,
that he might not be involved in the
consequences of the combat. He re∣lished
this advice so well, that he had
actually moved off to some distance;
but his apprehension and concern for
his friends co-operating with an in∣satiable
curiosity, detained him in
sight of the engagement.</P>
<P>The two knights having fairly di∣vided
the ground, and the same pre∣cautions
being taken by the seconds,
on another part of the field, Syca∣more
began to be invaded with some
scruples, which were probably engen∣dered
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
by the martial appearance, and
well known character of his antago∣nist.
The confidence which he had
derived from the reluctance of Sir
Launcelot now vanished, because it
plainly appeared, that the knight's
backwardness was not owing to per∣sonal
timidity; and he foresaw that
the prosecution of this joke might be
attended with very serious consequen∣ces
to his own life and reputation.
He, therefore, desired a parley, in
which he observed his affection for
Miss Darnel was of such a delicate
nature, that should the discomfiture
of his rival contribute to make her
unhappy, his victory must render him
the most miserable wretch upon earth.
He proposed, therefore, that her sen∣timents
and choice should be ascer∣tained
before they proceeded to extre∣mity.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot declared that he was
much more afraid of combating Au∣relia's
inclination, than of opposing
the knight of the Griffin in arms;
and that if he had the least reason to
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
think Mr. Sycamore, or any other
person, was distinguished by her pre∣ference,
he would instantly give up
his suit as desperate. At the same
time, he observed that Sycamore had
proceeded too far to retract; that he
had insulted a gentleman, and not
only challenged, but even pursued
him, and blocked up his passage in
the public highway; outrages which
he (Sir Launcelot) would not suffer
to pass unpunished. Accordingly, he
insisted on the combat, on pain of
treating Mr. Sycamore as a craven,
and a recreant. This declaration was
reinforced by Dawdle, who told him
that should he now decline the en∣gagement,
all the world would look
upon him as an infamous poltroon.</P>
<P>These two observations gave a ne∣cessary
fillip to the courage of the
challenger. The parties took their
stations: the trumpet sounded to
charge, and the combatants began
their career with great impetuosity.
Whether the gleam of Sir Launce∣lot's
arms affrighted Mr. Sycamore's
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
steed, or some other object had an
unlucky effect on his eye-sight; certain
it is he started at about midway, and
gave his rider such a violent shake as
discomposed his attitude, and disabled
him from using his lance to the best ad∣vantage.
Had our hero continued his
career, with his launce couched, in
all probability Sycamore's armour
would have proved but a bad defence
to his carcase: but Sir Launcelot per∣ceiving
his rival's spear unrested, had
just time to throw up the point of his
own, when the two horses closed
with such a shock, that Sycamore,
already wavering in the saddle, was
overthrown, and his armour crashed
around him as he fell.</P>
<P>The victor, seeing him lie without
motion, alighted immediately and be∣gan
to unbuckle his helmet, in which
office he was assisted by the trumpe∣ter.
When the head-piece was re∣moved,
the hapless knight of the
Griffin appeared in the pale livery of
death, tho' he was only in a swoon,
from which he soon recovered by the
<PB N="138" REF="141"/>
effect of the fresh air, and the asper∣sion
of cold water, brought from a
small pool in the neighbourhood.
When he recognized his conqueror
doing the offices of humanity about
his person, he closed his eyes from
vexation, told Sir Launcelot that his
was the fortune of the day, tho' he
himself owed his mischance to the
fault of his own horse; and observed
that this ridiculous affair would not
have happened, but for the mischie∣vous
instigation of that scoundrel
Dawdle, on whose ribs he threatened
to revenge his mishap.</P>
<P>Perhaps captain Crowe might have
saved him this trouble, had that wag
honourably adhered to the institutions
of chivalry, in his conflict with our
novice: but on this occasion, his in∣genuity
was more commendable than
his courage. He had provided at the
inn a blown bladder, in which seve∣ral
smooth pebbles were inclosed;
and this he slily fixed on the head
of his pole, when the captain obeyed
the signal of battle. Instead of bear∣ing
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
the brunt of the encounter, he
turned out of the straight line, so as
to avoid the launce of his antagonist,
and rattled his bladder with such ef∣fect,
that Crowe's horse pricking up
his ears, took to his heels, and fled
across some ploughed land with such
precipitation, that the rider was obliged
to quit his spear, and lay fast hold on
the mane, that he might not be thrown
out of the saddle. Dawdle, who was
much better mounted, seeing his con∣dition,
rode up to the unfortunate no∣vice,
and belaboured his shoulders
without fear of retaliation. Mr.
Clarke, seeing his kinsman so roughly
handled, forgot his fears, and flew to
his assistance; but, before he came
up, the aggressor had retired, and
now perceiving that fortune had de∣clared
against his friend and patron,
very honourably abandoned him in
his distress, and went off at full speed
for London.</P>
<P>Nor was Timothy Crabshaw with∣out
his share in the noble atchieve∣ments
of this propitious day. He
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
had by this time imbibed such a tinc∣ture
of errantry, that he firmly be∣lieved
himself and his master equally
invincible; and this belief operating
upon a perverse disposition, rendered
him as quarrelsome in his sphere, as
his master was mild and forbearing.
As he sat on horseback, in the place
assigned to him and Sycamore's lac∣quey,
he managed Gilbert in such a
manner, as to invade with his heels,
the posteriors of the other's horse;
and this insult produced some alterca∣tion,
which ended in mutual assault.
The footman handled the butt-end
of his horse-whip with great dexte∣rity
about the head of Crabshaw, who
declared afterwards, that it sung and
simmered like a kettle of cod-fish:
but the squire who understood the na∣ture
of long lashes, as having been a
carter from his infancy, found means
to twine his thong about the neck of
his antagonist, and pull him off his
horse half strangled, at the very in∣stant
his master was thrown by Sir
Launcelot Greaves.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="144"/>
Having thus obtained the victory,
he did not much regard the punc∣tilios
of chivalry; but taking it for
granted he had a right to make the
most of his advantage, resolved to
carry off the <HI>spolia opima.</HI> Alighting
with great agility, “Brother, (cried
he) I think as haw yawrs bean't a
butcher's horse, a doan't carry calves
well—I'se make yaw knaw your
churning days, I wool—what yaw
look as if yaw was crow-trodden,
you do—now, you shall pay the
score you have been running on my
peate, you shall, brother.”</P>
<P>So saying, he rifled his pockets,
stripped him of his hat and coat,
and took possession of his master's
portmanteau. But he did not long
enjoy his plunder: for the lacquey
complaining to Sir Launcelot, of his
having been despoiled, the knight
commanded his squire to refund, not
without menaces of subjecting him
to the severest chastisement, for his
injustice and rapacity. Timothy re∣presented,
with great vehemence, that
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
he had won the spoils in fair battle,
at the expence of his head and shoul∣ders,
which he immediately unco∣vered,
to prove his allegation: but his
remonstrance having no effect upon
his master, “Wounds! (cried he) an
I mun gee thee back the pig, I'se gee
thee back the poke also; I'm a drub∣bing
still in thy debt.”</P>
<P>With these words, he made a
most furious attack upon the plaintiff,
with his horse-whip, and before the
knight could interpose, repayed the
lacquey with interest. As an appur∣tenance
to Sycamore and Dawdle, he
ran the risque of another assault from
the novice Crowe, who was so trans∣ported
with rage, at the disagreeable
trick which had been played upon
him, by his fugitive antagonist, that
he could not for some time pronounce
an articulate sound, but a few broken
interjections, the meaning of which
could not be ascertained. Snatching
up his pole, he ran towards the place
where Mr. Sycamore sat on the grass,
supported by the trumpeter, and
would have finished what our adven∣turer
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
had left undone, if the knight
of the Crescent, with admirable dex∣terity,
had not warded off the blow
which he aimed at the knight of the
Griffin, and signified his displeasure
in a resolute tone: then he collared
the lacquey, who was just disengaged
from the chastising hand of Crabshaw,
and swinging his launce with his other
hand, encountered the squire's ribs by
accident.</P>
<P>Timothy was not slow in return∣ing
the salutation, with the weapon
which he still wielded: Mr. Clarke,
running up to the assistance of his
uncle, was opposed by the lacquey,
who seemed extremely desirous of
seeing the enemy revenge his quarrel,
by falling foul of one another. Clarke,
thus impeded, commenced hostilities
against the footman, while Crowe
grappled with Crabshaw; a battle-royal
insued, and was maintained with
great vigour, and some bloodshed on
all sides, until the authority of Sir
Launcelot, reinforced by some weighty
remonstrances, applied to the squire,
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
put an end to the conflict. Crabshaw
immediately desisted, and ran roaring
to communicate his grievances to
Gilbert, who seemed to sympathize
very little with his distress. The lac∣quey
took to his heels; Mr Clarke
wiped his bloody nose, declaring he
had a good mind to put the aggres∣sor
in the Crown-office; and captain
Crowe continued to ejaculate uncon∣nected
oaths, which, however, seem∣ed
to imply that he was almost sick of
his new profession. “D—n my eyes,
if you call this—start my timbers,
brother—look ye, d'ye see—a lousy,
lubberly, cowardly son of a—among
the breakers, d'ye see—lost my
steerage way—split my binnacle;
haul away—O! damn all arrantry—give
me a tight vessel, d'ye see, bro∣ther—mayhap
you may'nt—snatch
my—sea room and a spanking gale—o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds
heart, I'll hold a whole year's—smite
my limbs: it don't signify talk∣ing.”—</P>
<P>Our hero consoled the novice for
his disaster, by observing, that if he
<PB N="145" REF="148"/>
had got some blows, he had lost no
honour. At the same time, he ob∣served
that it was very difficult, if not
impossible, for a man to succeed in
the paths of chivalry, who had passed
the better part of his days in other
occupations; and hinted that as the
cause which had engaged him in this
way of life no longer existed, he was
determined to relinquish a profession,
which, in a peculiar manner, exposed
him to the most disagreeable incidents.
Crowe chewed the cud upon this in∣sinuation,
while the other personages
of the Drama were employed in
catching the horses, which had given
their riders the slip. As for Mr. Sy∣camore,
he was so bruised by his fall,
that it was necessary to procure a lit∣ter
for conveying him to the next
town, and the servant was dispatched
for this convenience; Sir Launcelot
staying with him until it arrived.</P>
<P>When he was safely deposited in
the carriage, our hero took leave of
him in these terms. “I shall not
insist upon your submitting to the
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
terms, you yourself proposed before
this rencounter. I give you free leave
to use all your advantages, in an ho∣nourable
way, for promoting your
suit with the young lady, of whom
you profess yourself enamoured.
Should you have recourse to finister
practices, you will find Sir Launcelot
Greaves ready to demand an account
of your conduct, not in the character
of a lunatic knight-errant, but as a
plain English gentleman, jealous of
his honour, and resolute in his pur∣pose.”</P>
<P>To this address Mr. Sycamore
made no reply, but with a sullen
aspect ordered the carriage to pro∣ceed;
and it moved accordingly to
the right, our hero's road to London
lying in the other direction. Sir
Launcelot had already exchanged his
armour for a riding-coat, hat, and
boots; and Crowe parting with his
skull-cap and leathern jerkin, regain∣ed
in some respects the appearance of
a human creature. Thus metamor∣phosed,
they pursued their way in an
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
easy pace, Mr. Clarke endeavouring
to amuse them with a learned disser∣tation
on the law, tending to demon∣strate
that Mr. Sycamore was, by his
behaviour of that day, liable to three
different actions, besides a commission
of lunacy; and that Dawdle might
be prosecuted for having practised
subtle craft, to the annoyance of his
uncle, over and above an action for
assault and battery; because, for why?
The said Crowe having run away, as
might be easily proved, before any
blows were given, the said Dawdle
by pursuing him even out of the
high road, putting him in fear, and
committing battery on his body, be∣came,
to all intents and purposes, the
aggressor; and an indictment would
lie in <HI>Banco Regis.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain's pride was so shock∣ed
at these observations, that he ex∣claimed
with equal rage and impa∣tience,
“You lie, you dog, in <HI>Bil∣kum
Regis</HI>—you lie, I say, you lub∣ber,
I did not run away; nor was I
in fear, d'ye see. It was my son of
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
a bitch of a horse that would not
obey the helm, d'ye see, whereby I
coudn't use my metal, d'ye see—As
for the matter of fear, you and fear
my kiss my—So don't go and heave
your stink-pots at my character, d'ye
see, or agad I'll trim thee fore and
aft with a—I wool.” Tom protested
he meant nothing but a little specula∣tion,
and Crowe was appeased.</P>
<P>In the evening they reached the
town of Bugden, without any farther
adventure, and passed the night in
great tranquility. Next morning,
even after the horses were ordered to
be saddled, Mr. Clarke, without cere∣mony,
entered the apartment of Sir
Launcelot, leading in a female, who
proved to be the identical Mrs. Dolly
Cowslip. This young woman ad∣vancing
to the knight, cried, “O,
Sir Launcelot! my dear leady, my
dear leady”—but was hindered from
proceeding by a flood of tears which
the tender hearted lawyer mingled
with a plentiful shower of sympathy.</P>
<P>Our adventurer starting at this
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
exclamation, “O heavens! (cried he)
where is my Aurelia? speak, where
did you leave that jewel of my soul?
answer me in a moment—I am all
terror and impatience!” Dolly hav∣ing
recollected herself, told him that
Mr. Darnel had lodged his niece in
the new buildings by May-fair; that
on the second night after their arrival,
a very warm expostulation had passed
between Aurelia and her uncle, who
next morning dismissed Dolly, with∣out
permitting her to take leave of
her mistress, and that same day moved
to another part of the town, as she
afterwards learned of the landlady,
though she could not inform her
whither they were gone. That when
she was turned away, John Clump,
one of the footmen, who pretended
to have a kindness for her, had faith∣fully
promised to call upon her and
let her know what passed in the fa∣mily;
but as he did not keep his word,
and she was an utter stranger in Lon∣don,
without friends or settlement,
she had resolved to return to her mo∣ther,
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>
and travelled so far on foot since
yesterday morning.</P>
<P>Our knight, who had expected the
most dismal tidings from her lament∣able
preamble, was pleased to find
his presaging fears disappointed; tho'
he was far from being satisfied with
the dismission of Dolly, from whose
attachment to his interest, joined to
her influence over Mr. Clump, he had
hoped to reap such intelligence as
would guide him to the haven of his
desires. After a minute's reflection,
he saw it would be expedient to carry
back Mrs. Cowslip, and lodge her at
the place where Mr. Clump had pro∣mised
to visit her with intelligence;
for, in all probability, it was not for
want of inclination that he had not
kept his promise.</P>
<P>Dolly did not express any aversion
to the scheme of returning to Lon∣don,
where she hoped once more to
rejoin her dear lady, to whom by this
time, she was attached by the strong∣est
ties of affection; and her inclina∣tion,
in this respect, was assisted by
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
the consideration of having the compa∣ny
of the young lawyer, who, it plain∣ly
appeared, had made strange havock
in her heart, tho' it must be owned, for
the honour of this blooming damsel,
that her thoughts had never once deviat∣ed
from the paths of innocence and
virtue. The more Sir Launcelot sur∣veyed
this agreeable maiden, the more
he felt himself disposed to take care
of her fortune; and from this day he
began to ruminate on a scheme which
was afterwards consummated in her
favour—In the mean time, he laid
injunctions on Mr. Clarke to conduct
his addresses to Mrs. Cowslip, accord∣ing
to the rules of honour and de∣corum,
as he valued his countenance
and friendship. His next step was to
procure a saddle-horse for Dolly, who
preferred this to any other sort of
carriage; and thereby gratified the wish
of her admirer, who longed to see
her on horseback in her green joseph.</P>
<P>The armour, including the accou∣trements
of the novice and the squire,
were left in the care of the inn-keeper,
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
and Timothy Crabshaw was so meta∣morphosed
by a plain livery-frock,
that even Gilbert with difficulty re∣cognized
his person. As for the no∣vice
Crowe, his head had almost re∣sumed
its natural dimensions; but
then his whole face was so covered
with a livid suffusion; his nose ap∣peared
so flat, and his lips so tumified,
that he might very well have passed
for a Caffre or Aethiopian. Every
circumstance being now adjusted,
they departed from Bugden in a re∣gular
cavalcade, dined at Hatfield,
and in the evening arrived at the Bull
and Gate inn in Holborn, where
they established their quarters for the
night.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which our Hero descends into the
Mansions of the Damned.</HEAD>
<P>THE first step which Sir Launce∣lot
took in the morning that
succeeded his arrival in London, was
to settle Mrs. Dolly Cowslip in lodg∣ings
at the house where John Clump
had promised to visit her; as he did
not doubt, that tho' the visit was de∣layed,
it would some time or other
be performed; and in that case, he
might obtain some intelligence of Au∣relia.
Mr. Thomas Clarke was per∣mitted
to take up his habitation in the
same house, on his earnestly desiring
he might be intrusted with the office
of conveying information and instruc∣tion
between Dolly and our adven∣turer.
The knight himself resolved
to live retired until he should receive
some tidings relating to Miss Darnel,
that would influence his conduct; but
he proposed to frequent places of pub∣lic
resort incognito, that he might
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
have some chance of meeting by ac∣cident
with the mistress of his heart.
Taking it for granted that the oddities
of Crowe would help to amuse him
in his hours of solitude and disappoint∣ment,
he invited that original to be
his guest at a small house which he
determined to hire ready furnished in
the neighbourhood of Golden-square.
The captain thanked him for his cour∣tesy,
and frankly embraced his offer;
tho' he did not much approve of the
knight's choice, in point of situation.
He said he would recommend him to
a special good upper-deck hard by St.
Catherine's in Wapping, where he
would be delighted with the prospect
of the street forwards, well frequented
by passengers, carts, drays, and other
carriages; and having backwards, an
agreeable view of alderman Parsons'
great brewhouse, with two hundred
hogs feeding almost under the win∣dow.
As a further inducement, he
mentioned the vicinity of the Tower
guns, which would regale his hearing
on days of salutation: nor did he for∣get
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
get the sweet sound of mooring and
unmooring ships in the river, and the
pleasing objects on the other side of
the Thames, displayed in the oozy
docks and cabbage-gardens of Ro∣therhithe.
Sir Launcelot was not in∣sensible
to the beauties of this land∣scape;
but, his pursuit lying another
way, he contented himself with a
less enchanting situation, and Crowe
accompanied him out of pure friend∣ship.
At night Mr. Clarke arrived
at our hero's house with tidings that
were by no means agreeable. He
told him that Clump had left a letter
for Dolly, informing her that his ma∣ster
'squire Darnel was to set out early
in the morning for Yorkshire; but he
could give no account of her lady,
who had, the day before, been con∣veyed,
he knew not whither, in a
hackney-coach, attended by his uncle
and an ill-looking fellow, who had
much the appearance of a bailiff or
turnkey; so that he feared she was
in trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159"/>
Sir Launcelot was deeply affected
by this intimation. His apprehension
was even roused by a suspicion that a
man of Darnel's violent temper, and
unprincipled heart, might have prac∣tised
upon the life of his lovely niece:
but, upon recollection, he could not
suppose that he had recourse to such
infamous expedients, knowing, as he
did, that an account of her would
be demanded at his hands, and that
it would be easily proved he had con∣veyed
her from the lodging in which
she resided. His first fears now gave
way to another suggestion, that An∣thony,
in order to intimidate her into
a compliance with his proposals, had
trumped up a spurious claim against
her, and by virtue of a writ confined
her in some prison or spunging-house.
Possessed with this idea, he desired
Mr. Clarke to search the sheriff's office
in the morning, that he might know
whether any such writ had been
granted; and he himself resolved to
make a tour of the great prisons be∣longing
to the metropolis, to enquire
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>
if perchance she might not be con∣fined
under a borrowed name. Fi∣nally,
he determined, if possible, to
apprise her of his place of abode by
a paragraph in all the daily papers,
signifying that Sir Launcelot Greaves
had arrived at his house by Golden-square.</P>
<P>All these resolutions were punctual∣ly
executed. No such writ had been
taken out in the sheriff's office; and
therefore, our hero set out on his
jail expedition, accompanied by Mr.
Clarke, who had contracted some ac∣quaintance
with the commanding offi∣cers
in these garrisons, in the course
of his clerkship, and practice as an
attorney. The first day they spent in
prosecuting their inquiry through the
Gate-house, Fleet, and Marshalsea;
the next they allotted to the King's∣bench,
where they understood there
was a great variety of prisoners.
There they proposed to make a mi∣nute
scrutiny, by the help of Mr.
Norton the deputy-marshal, who was
Mr. Clarke's intimate friend, and had
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
nothing at all of jailor either in his
appearance or in his disposition, which
was remarkably humane and bene∣volent
towards all his fellow-crea∣tures.</P>
<P>The knight having bespoke dinner
at a tavern in the Borough, was, to∣gether
with captain Crowe, conduct∣ed
to the prison of the King's-bench,
which is situated in St. George's-fields,
about a mile from the end of
Westminster-bridge, and appears like
a neat little regular town, consisting
of one street, surrounded by a very
high wall, including an open piece of
ground which may be termed a gar∣den,
where the prisoners take the air,
and amuse themselves with a variety
of diversions. Except the entrance,
where the turnkeys keep watch and
ward, there is nothing in the place
that looks like a jail, or bears the least
colour of restraint. The street is
crowded with passengers. Tradesmen
of all kinds here exercise their dif∣ferent
professions. Hawkers of all
sorts are admitted to call and vend
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
their wares as in any open street of
London. Here are butchers-stands,
chandlers-shops, a surgery, a tap∣house
well frequented, and a public
kitchen in which provisions are dressed
for all the prisoners gratis, at the ex∣pence
of the publican. Here the
voice of misery never complains, and,
indeed, little else is to be heard but
the sounds of mirth and jollity. At
the farther end of the street, on the
right hand, is a little paved court lead∣ing
to a separate building, consisting
of twelve large apartments, called
state-rooms, well furnished, and fit∣ted
up for the reception of the better
sort of crown-prisoners; and on the
other side of the street, facing a se∣parate
division of ground, called the
common side, is a range of rooms
occupied by prisoners of the lowest
order, who share the profits of a beg∣ging-box,
and are maintained by this
practice, and some established funds
of charity. We ought also to ob∣serve,
that the jail is provided with a
neat chapel, in which a clergyman,
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
in consideration of a certain salary,
performs divine service every Sun∣day.</P>
<P>Our adventurer having searched the
books, and perused the description of
all the female prisoners who had been
for some weeks admitted into the jail,
obtained not the least intelligence of
his concealed charmer, but resolved
to alleviate his disappointment by the
gratification of his curiosity. Under
the auspices of Mr. Norton, he made
a tour of the prison, and in particular
visited the kitchen, where he saw a
number of spits loaded with a variety
of provision, consisting of butcher's
meat, poultry, and game: he could
not help expressing his astonishment
with up-lifted hands, and congratu∣lating
himself in secret, upon his be∣ing
a member of that community
which had provided such a comfort∣able
asylum for the unfortunate. His
ejaculation was interrupted by a tu∣multuous
noise in the street; and Mr.
Norton declaring he was sent for to
the lodge, consigned our hero to the
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
care of one Mr. Felton, a prisoner of
a very decent appearance, who paid
his compliments with a good grace,
and invited the company to repose
themselves in his apartment, which
was large, commodious, and well
furnished. When Sir Launcelot ask∣ed
the cause of that uproar, he told
him that it was the prelude to a box∣ing-match
between two of the pri∣soners,
to be decided in the ground,
or garden of the place.</P>
<P>Capt. Crowe expressing an eager
curiosity to see the battle, Mr. Fel∣ton
assured him there would be no
sport, as the combatants were both
reckoned dunghills: “But, in half
an hour (said he) there will be a bat∣tle
of some consequence between two
of the demagogues of the place, Dr.
Crabclaw and Mr. Tapley, the first
a physician, and the other a brewer.
You must know, Gentlemen, that
this microcosm or republic in minia∣ture,
is like the great world, split in∣to
sactions. Crabclaw is the leader of
one party; and the other is headed
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
by Tapley: both are men of warm
and impetuous tempers; and their
intrigues have embroiled the whole
place, insomuch that it was dange∣rous
to walk the street, on account
of the continual skirmishes of their
partizans. At length, some of the
more sedate inhabitants having met
and deliberated upon some remedy
for these growing disorders, proposed
that the dispute should be at once de∣cided
by single combat between the
two chiefs, who readily agreed to the
proposal. The match was according∣ly
made for five guineas, and this very
day and hour appointed for the trial,
on which considerable sums of money
are depending. As for Mr. Norton,
it is not proper that he should be pre∣sent,
or seem to countenance such vio∣lent
proceedings, which, however, it
is necessary to connive at, as conve∣nient
vents for the evaporation of
those humours, which being confined,
might accumulate and break out with
greater fury, in conspiracy and re∣bellion.”</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="166"/>
The knight owned he could not
conceive by what means such a num∣ber
of licentious people, amounting,
with their dependants, to above five
hundred, were restrained within the
bounds of any tolerable discipline, or
prevented from making their escape;
which they might at any time accom∣plish,
either by stealth or open vio∣lence,
as it could not be supposed
that one or two turnkeys, continually
employed in opening and shutting the
door, could resist the efforts of a
whole multitude. “Your wonder,
good Sir, (said Mr. Felton) will va∣nish,
when you consider it is hardly
possible that the multitude should co∣operate
in the execution of such a
scheme; and that the keeper perfectly
well understands the maxim <HI>divide et
impera.</HI> Many prisoners are restrained
by the dictates of gratitude towards
the deputy-marshal, whose friendship
and good offices they have experi∣enced:
some, no doubt, are actuated
by motives of discretion. One party
is an effectual check upon the other;
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
and I am firmly persuaded that there
are not ten prisoners within the place
that would make their escape, if the
doors were laid open. This is a step
which no man would take, unless
his fortune was altogether desperate;
because it would oblige him to leave
his country for life, and expose him
to the most imminent risque of being
retaken and treated with the utmost
severity. The majority of the priso∣ners
live in the most lively hope of
being released by the assistance of
their friends, the compassion of their
creditors, or the favour of the legi∣slature.
Some who are cut off from all
these proposals, are become naturalized
to the place, knowing they cannot
subsist in any other situation. I, my∣self,
am one of these. After having
resigned all my effects for the benefit
of my creditors, I have been detained
these nine years in prison, because
one person refuses to sign my certifi∣cate.
I have long outlived all my
friends from whom I could expect the
least countenance or favour: I am
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
grown old in confinement; and lay
my account with ending my days in
jail, as the mercy of the legislature in
favour of insolvent debtors, is never
extended to uncertified bankrupts
taken in execution. By dint of in∣dustry,
and the most rigid oeconomy,
I make shift to live independant in
this retreat. To this scene my facul∣ty
of subsisting, as well as my body,
is peculiarly confined. Had I an op∣portunity
to escape, where should I
go? All my views of fortune have
been long blasted. I have no friends
nor connexions in the world. I must,
therefore, starve in some sequestered
corner, or be recaptivated and confin∣ed
for ever to close prison, deprived
of the indulgences which I now en∣joy.”</P>
<P>Here the conversation was broke
off by another uproar, which was the
signal to battle between the doctor and
his antagonist. The company imme∣diately
adjourned to the field, where
the combatants were already undressed
and the stakes deposited. The doc∣tor
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
seemed of the middle age and mid∣dle
stature, active and alert, with an
atrabilarious aspect, and a mixture
of rage and disdain expressed in his
countenance. The brewer was large,
raw-boned, and round as a but of
beer, but very fat, unwieldy, short∣winded
and phlegmatic. Our adven∣turer
was not a little surprised when
he beheld in the character of seconds,
a male and a female stripped naked
from the waist upwards, the latter
ranging on the side of the physician:
but the commencement of the bat∣tle
prevented his demanding of his
guide an explanation of this phoeno∣menon.
The doctor, retiring some
paces backwards, threw himself into
the attitude of a battering ram, and
rushed upon his antagonist with great
impetuosity, foreseeing that should he
have the good fortune to over-turn
him in the first assault, it would not
be an easy task to raise him up again
and put him in a capacity of offence.
But the momentum of Crabclaw's
head, and the concomitant efforts of
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
his knuckles, had no effect upon the
ribs of Tapley, who stood firm as
the Acroceraunian promontory: and
slepping forward with his projected
fist, something smaller and softer than
a sledge-hammer, struck the physician
to the ground. In a trice, however,
by the assistance of his female second,
he was on his legs again, and grap∣pling
with his antagonist, endeavour∣ed
to tip him a fall; but, instead of
accomplishing his purpose, he re∣ceived
a cross-buttock, and the brewer
throwing himself upon him as he fell,
had well-nigh smothered him on the
spot. The amazon flew to his assist∣ance,
and Tapley shewing no incli∣nation
to get up, she smote him on
the temple 'till he roared. The male
second hastening to the relief of his
principal, made application to the
eyes of the female, which were
immediately surrounded with black
circles; and she returned the salute
with a blow which brought a double
stream of blood from his nostrils,
greeting him at the same time with
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
the opprobrious appellation of a lou∣sy
son of a b—h. A combat more fu∣rious
than the first would now have
ensued, had not Felton interposed
with an air of authority, and insis∣ted
on the man's leaving the field;
an injunction which he forthwith
obeyed, saying, “Well, damme,
Felton, you're my friend and com∣mander:
I'll obey your order—but
the b—h will be foul of me before
we sleep.—” Then Felton, advanc∣ing
to his opponent, “Madam, (said
he) I'm very sorry to see a lady of
your rank and qualifications expose
yourself in this manner.—For God's
sake, behave with a little more de∣corum;
if not for the sake of your
own family, at least for the credit of
your sex in general.” “Hark ye,
Felton, (said she) decorum is founded
upon a delicacy of sentiment and de∣portment,
which cannot consist with
the disgraces of a jail, and the mise∣ries
of indigence.—But I see the dis∣pute
is now terminated, and the mo∣ney
is to be drank: if you'll dine
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
with us you shall be welcome: if not,
you may die in your sobriety, and be
damned.”</P>
<P>By this time the doctor had given
out, and allowed the brewer to be the
better man; yet he would not honour
the festival with his presence, but re∣tired
to his chamber, exceedingly
mortified at his defeat. Our hero
was reconducted to Mr. Felton's
apartment, where he sat some time
without opening his mouth, so asto∣nished
he was at what he had seen
and heard. “I perceive, Sir, (said
the prisoner) you are surprised at the
manner in which I accosted that un∣happy
woman; and perhaps you
will be more surprised when you
hear, that within these eighteen
months, she was actually a person of
fashion, and her opponent (who by
the bye) is her husband, universally
respected as a man of honour, and a
brave officer.” “I am, indeed, (cried
our hero) overwhelmed with amaze∣ment
and concern, as well as stimu∣lated
by an eager curiosity to know
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
the fatal causes which have produced
such a deplorable reverse of character
and fortune. But I will rein my
curiosity till the afternoon, if you
will favour me with your company at
a tavern in the neighbourhood, where
I have bespoke dinner; a favour which
I hope Mr. Norton will have no ob∣jection
to your granting, as he him∣self
is to be of the party.”—The
prisoner thanked him for his kind in∣vitation,
and they adjourned imme∣diately
to the place, taking up the de∣puty-marshal
in their passage through
the lodge or entrance of the prison.</P>

<P>DInner being chearfully discus∣sed,
and our adventurer ex∣pressing
an eager desire to know the
history of the male and female who
had acted as 'squires or seconds to the
champions of the King's-bench, Fel∣ton
gratified his curiosity to this effect:</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="174"/>
“All that I know of Captain Clew∣lin,
previous to his commitment, is,
that he was commander of a sloop of
war, and bore the reputation of a
gallant officer; that he married the
daughter of a rich merchant in the
city of London against the inclina∣tion,
and without the knowledge of
her father, who renounced her for
this act of disobedience: that the cap∣tain
consoled himself for the rigour
of the parent with the possession of
the lady, who was not only remark∣ably
beautiful in person, but highly
accomplished in her mind, and ami∣able
in her disposition. Such, a few
months ago, were those two persons
whom you saw acting in such a vulgar
capacity. When they first entered
the prison they were undoubtedly the
handsomest couple mine eyes ever be∣held,
and their appearance won uni∣versal
respect even from the most bru∣tal
inhabitants of the jail. The cap∣tain
having unwarily involved himself
as security for a man to whom he
had lain under obligations, became
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
liable for a considerable sum; and
his own father-in-law being the sole
creditor of the bankrupt, took this
opportunity of wreaking vengeance
upon him for having espoused his
daughter. He watched an opportu∣nity
until the captain had actually stept
into the post-chaise with his lady for
Portsmouth, where his ship lay, and
caused him to be arrested in the most
public and shameful manner. Mrs.
Clewlin had like to have sunk under
the first transports of her grief and
mortification; but these subsiding, she
had recourse to personal sollicitation.
She went with her only child in her
arms (a lovely boy) to her father's
door, and being denied admittance,
kneeled down in the street, imploring
his compassion in the most pathetic
strain; but this hard-hearted citizen,
instead of recognizing his child, and
taking the poor mourner to his bosom,
insulted her from the window with
the most bitter reproach, saying, a∣mong
other shocking expressions,
“Strumpet, take yourself away, with
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
your brat, otherwise I shall send for
the beadle, and have you to Bride∣well.”</P>
<P>The unfortunate lady was cut to
the heart by this usage, and sainted
in the street; from whence she was
conveyed to a public house by the
charity of some passengers. She af∣terwards
attempted to soften the bar∣barity
of her father, by repeated let∣ters,
and by interesting some of his
friends to intercede with him in her
behalf; but all her endeavours prov∣ing
ineffectual, she accompanied her
husband to the prison of the King's-bench,
where she must have felt, in
the severest manner, the fatal reverse
of circumstance to which she was ex∣posed.
The captain being disabled
from going to sea, was superseded,
and he saw all his hopes blasted in the
midst of an active war, at a time
when he had the fairest prospects of
fame and fortune. He saw himself
reduced to extreme poverty, cooped
up with the tender partner of his heart
in a wretched hovel, amidst the re∣fuse
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
of mankind, and on the brink of
wanting the common necessaries of
life. The mind of man is ever inge∣nious
in finding resources. He com∣forted
his lady with vain hopes of
having friends who would effect his
deliverance, and repeated assurances of
this kind so long, that he at length
began to think they were not altoge∣ther
void of foundation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Clewlin, from a principle of
duty, recollected all her fortitude,
that she might not only bear her fate
with patience, but even contributed
to alleviate the woes of her husband,
whom her affection had ruined. She
affected to believe the suggestions of
his pretended hope; she interchanged
with him assurances of better fortune;
her appearance exhibited a calm,
while her heart was torn with anguish.
She assisted him in writing letters to
former friends, the last consolation of
the wretched prisoner; she delivered
these letters with her own hand, and
underwent a thousand mortifying re∣pulses,
the most shocking circumstan∣ces
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
of which she concealed from her
husband. She performed all the me∣nial
offices in her own little family,
which was maintained by pawning
her apparel; and both the husband
and wife, in some measure, sweetened
their cares, by prattling and toying
with their charming little boy, on
whom they doated with an enthusiasm
of fondness.—Yet even this plea∣sure
was mingled with the most ten∣der
and melancholy regret. I have
seen the mother hang over him, with
the most affecting expression of this
kind in her aspect, the tears contend∣ing
with the smiles upon her counte∣nance,
while she exclaimed: Alas!
my poor prisoner, little did your mo∣ther
once think she should be obliged
to nurse you in a jail.” The captains
paternal love was dashed with impa∣tience—He
would snatch up the boy
in a transport of grief, press him to
his breast, devour him as it were with
kisses, throw up his eyes to heaven in
the most emphatic silence; then con∣vey
the child hastily to his mother's
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
arms, pull his hat over his eyes, stalk
out into the common walk, and finding
himself alone, break out into tears and
lamentation.</P>
<P>Ah! little did this unhappy couple
know what further griefs awaited
them! The small-pox broke out in
the prison, and poor Tommy Clewlin
was infected. As the eruption appeared
unfavourable, you may con∣ceive
the consternation with which
they were overwhelmed. Their dis∣tress
was rendered inconceiveable by
indigence; for, by this time, they
were so destitute that they could nei∣ther
pay for common attendance, nor
procure proper advice. I did on that
occasion, what I thought my duty to∣wards
my fellow-creatures.—I wrote
to a physician of my acquaintance,
who was humane enough to visit the
poor little patient: I engaged a care∣ful
woman-prisoner as a nurse, and
Mr. Norton supplied them with mo∣ney
and necessaries. These helps
were barely sufficient to preserve them
from the horrors of despair, when they
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
saw their little darling panting under
the rage of a loathsome pestilential
malady, during the excessive heat of
the dog-days, and struggling for breath
in the noxious atmosphere of a con∣fined
cabin, where they scarce had
room to turn, on the most necessary
occasions. The eager curiosity with
which the mother eyed the doctor's
looks as often as he visited the boy;
the terror and trepidation of the fa∣ther,
while he desired to know his
opinion; in a word, the whole tenour
of their distress baffled all descrip∣tion.</P>
<P>At length, the physician, for the
sake of his own character, was obliged
to be explicit; and returning with the
captain to the common walk, told
him, in my hearing, that the child
could not possibly recover.—This sen∣tence
seemed to have petrified the un∣fortunate
parent, who stood motion∣less,
and seemingly bereft of sense. I
led him to my apartment, where he
sat a full hour in that state of stupe∣faction;
then he began to groan
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
hideously; a shower of tears burst
from his eyes; he threw himself on
the floor, and uttered the most piteous
lamentation that ever was heard.
Mean while, Mrs. Norton being made
aquainted with the doctor's prognos∣tic,
visited Mrs. Clewlin, and invited
her to the lodge. Her prophetic fears
immediately took the alarm. “What!
(cried she, starting up with a frantic
wildness in her looks) then our case is
desperate—I shall lose my dear Tom∣my!—the
poor prisoner will be re∣leased
by the hand of heaven!—Death
will convey him to the cold grave!”—The
dying innocent hearing this ex∣clamation,
pronounced these words:
“Tommy won't leave you, my dear
mamma—if death comes to take
Tommy, papa shall drive him away
with his sword.” This address de∣prived
the wretched mother of all re∣signation
to the will of Providence.
She tore her hair, dashed herself on
the pavement, shrieked aloud, and was
carried off in a deplorable state of dis∣traction.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="182"/>
That same evening the lovely babe
expired, and the father grew frantic.
He made an attempt on his own life;
and being with difficulty restrained,
his agitation sunk into a kind of sud∣den
insensibility, which seemed to ab∣sorb
all sentiment, and gradually vul∣garized
his faculty of thinking. In
order to dissipate the violence of his
sorrow, he continually shifted the
scene from one company to another,
contracted abundance of low con∣nexions,
and drowned his cares in re∣peated
intoxication. The unhappy lady
underwent a long scries of hysterical
fits and other complaints, which seem∣ed
to have a fatal effect on her brain
as well as constitution. Cordials were
administred to keep up her spirits; and
she found it necessary to protract the
use of them to blunt the edge of grief,
by overwhelming reflexion, and re∣move
the sense of uneasiness arising
from a disorder in her stomach. In
a word, she became an habitual dram∣drinker;
and this practice exposed her
to such communication as debatched
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
her reason, and perverted her sense of
decorum and propriety. She and her
husband gave a loose to vulgar excess,
in which they were enabled to indulge
by the charity and interest of some
friends, who obtained half-pay for the
captain. They are now metamor∣phosed
into the shocking creatures you
have seen; he into a riotous plebeian,
and she into a ragged trull. They are
both drunk every day, quarrel and
fight one with another, and often in∣sult
their fellow-prisoners. Yet they
are not wholly abandoned by virtue
and humanity. The captain is scru∣pulously
honest in all his dealings,
and pays off his debts punctually every
quarter, as soon as he receives his
half-pay. Every prisoner in distress
is welcome to share his money while
it lasts; and his wife never fails,
while it is in her power, to relieve
the wretched; so that their generosi∣ty,
even in this miserable disguise, is
universally respected by their neigh∣bours.
Sometimes the recollection of
their former rank comes over them
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
like a qualm, which they dispel with
brandy, and then humorously rally
one another on their mutual degene∣racy.
She often stops me in the walk,
and, pointing to the captain, says,
“My husband, tho' he is become a
black-guard jail-bird, must be allow∣ed
to be an handsome fellow still.”—On
the other hand, he will frequent∣ly
desire me to take notice of his rib,
as she chances to pass.—“Mind that
draggle-tail'd drunken drab—(he will
say) what an antidote it is—yet, for
all that, Felton, she was a fine woman
when I married her—Poor Bess, I
have been the ruin of her, that is
certain, and deserve to be damned for
bringing her to this pass.”</P>
<P>Thus they accommodate them∣selves
to each other's infirmities, and
pass their time not without some taste
of plebeian enjoyment—but, name
their child, they never fail to burst
into tears, and still feel a return of the
most poignant sorrow.”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot Greaves did not hear
this story unmoved. Tom Clark's
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
cheeks were bedewed with the drops
of sympathy, while with much sob∣bing,
he declared his opinion, that an
action would lie against the lady's fa∣ther.—Captain
Crowe having listened
to the story, with uncommon atten∣tion,
expressed his concern that an
honest seaman should be so taken in
stays: but he imputed all his calami∣ties
to the wife: “For why? (said he)
a sea-saring man may have a sweet∣heart
in every port; but he should
steer clear of a wife, as he would
avoid a quick-sand.—You see, brother,
how this here Clewlin lags astern in
the wake of a sniveling b—; other∣wise
he would never make a weft in
his ensign for the loss of a child—odds
heart! he could have done no
more if he had sprung a top-mast, or
started a timber.—”</P>
<P>The knight declaring that he would
take another view of the prison in the
afternoon, Mr. Felton insisted upon
his doing him the honour to drink a
dish of tea in his apartment, and Sir
Launcelot accepted his invitation.
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
Thither they accordingly repaired, af∣ter
having made another circuit of the
jail, and the tea-things were produced
by Mrs. Felton, when she was sum∣moned
to the door, and in a few mi∣nutes
returning, communicated some∣thing
in a whisper to her husband.
He changed colour, and repaired to
the stair-case, where he was heard to
talk aloud in an angry tone. When
he came back he told the company he
had been teazed by a very importunate
beggar. Addressing himself to our
adventurer, “You took notice (says
he) of a fine lady flaunting about our
walk in all the frippery of the fashion.
—She was lately a gay young widow
that made a great figure at the court
end of the town; she distinguished
herself by her splendid equipage, her
rich liveries, her brilliant assemblies,
her numerous routs, and her elegant
taste in dress and furniture. She is
nearly related to some of the best fami∣lies
in England, and, it must be own∣ed,
mistress of many fine accomplish∣ments.
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>
But being deficient in true
delicacy, she endeavoured to hide that
defect by affectation. She pretended
to a thousand antipathies which did
not belong to her nature. A breast of
veal threw her into mortal agonies. If
she saw a spider she screamed; and at
sight of a mouse she fainted away.
She could not without horror behold
an entire joint of meat; and nothing
but fricassees and other made-dishes
were seen upon her table. She cau∣sed
all her floors to be lined with green
bays, that she might trip along them
with more ease and pleasure. Her
footmen wore clogs, which were de∣posited
in the hall, and both they and
her chairmen were laid under the
strongest injunctions to avoid porter
and tobacco. Her jointure amounted
to eight hundred pounds per annum,
and she made shift to spend four times
that sum: at lenght it was mortgaged
for nearly the entire value; but, far
from retrenching, she seemed to in∣crease
in extravagance until her effects
were taken in execution, and her per∣son
<PB N="185" REF="188"/>
here deposited in safe custody.
When one considers the abrupt transi∣tion
she underwent from her spacious
apartments to an hovel scarce eight
feet square; from sumptuous furni∣ture
to bare benches; from magnifi∣cence
to meanness; from affluence to
extreme poverty; one would imagine
she must have been totally over∣whelmed
by such a sudden gush of
misery. But this was not the case:
she has, in fact, no delicate feelings.
She forthwith accommodated herself
to the exigency of her fortune; yet
she still affects to keep state amidst the
miseries of a goal; and this affecta∣tion
is truly ridiculous.—She lies a-bed
till two o'clock in the afternoon: she
maintains a female attendant for the
sole purpose of dressing her person.
Her cabin is the least cleanly in the
whole prison; she has learned to eat
bread and cheese, and drink porter;
but she always appears once a day
dressed in the pink of the fashion. She
has found means to run in debt at the
chandler's shop, the baker's, and the
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
tap-house, tho' there is nothing got
in this place but with ready money:
she has even borrowed small sums
from divers prisoners, who were them∣selves
on the brink of starving. She
takes pleasure in being surrounded
with duns, observing, that by such peo∣ple
a person of fashion is to be distin∣guished.
She writes circular letters
to her former friends and acquain∣tance,
and by this method has raised
pretty considerable contributions; for
she writes in a most elegant and irre∣sistible
stile. About a fortnight ago
she received a supply of twenty gui∣neas;
when, instead of paying her
little goal-debts, or withdrawing any
part of her apparel from pawn, she
laid out the whole sum in a fashiona∣ble
suit and laces; and next day
borrowed of me a shilling to purchase
a neck of mutton for her dinner—She
seems to think her rank in life in∣titles
her to this kind of assistance.
She talks very pompously of her fami∣ly
and connexions, by whom, howe∣ver,
she has been long renounced.
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
She has no sympathy nor compassion
for the distresses of her fellow-crea∣tures;
but she is perfectly well bred;
she bears a repulse the best of any
woman I ever knew; and her temper
has never been once ruffled since her
arrival at the King's-bench—She now
intreated me to lend her half a guinea,
for which she said she had the most
pressing occasion, and promised upon
her honour it should be repaid to∣morrow;
but I lent a deaf ear to her
request, and told her in plain terms
that her honour was already bank∣rupt.—”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot thrusting his hand
mechanically into his pocket, pulled
out a couple of guineas, and desired
Felton to accommodate her with that
trifle in his own name; but he de∣clined
the proposal, and refused to
touch the money. “God forbid,
(said he) that I should attempt to
thwart your charitable intention: but
this, my good sir, is no object—she
has many resources. Neither should
we number the clamorous beggar
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
among those who really feel distress.
He is generally gorged with bounty
misapplied. The liberal hand of cha∣rity
should be extended to modest want
that pines in silence, encountering
cold, and nakedness, and hunger, and
every species of distress. Here you
may find the wretch of keen sensa∣tions,
blasted by accident in the blos∣som
of his fortune, shivering in the
solitary recess of indigence, disdaining
to beg, and even ashamed to let his
misery be known. Here you may
see the parent who has known happier
times, surrounded by his tender off∣spring,
naked and forlorn, demand∣ing
food, which his circumstances can∣not
afford.—That man of decent ap∣pearance
and melancholy aspect, who
lifted his hat as you passed him in the
yard, is a person of unblemished cha∣racter.
He was a reputable tradesman
in the city, and failed through inevi∣table
losses. A commission of bank∣ruptcy
was taken out against him by
his sole creditor, a quaker, who re∣fused
to sign his certificate. He has
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
lived these three years in prison, with
a wife and five small children. In a
little time after his commitment, he
had friends who offered to pay ten
shillings in the pound of what he ow∣ed,
and to give security for paying the
remainder in three years, by install∣ments.
The honest quaker did not
charge the bankrupt with any disho∣nest
practices; but he rejected the
proposal with the most mortifying in∣difference,
declaring that he did not
want his money. The mother re∣paired
to his house, and kneeled be∣fore
him with her five lovely children,
imploring mercy with tears and excla∣mations.
He stood this scene un∣moved,
and even seemed to enjoy the
prospect, wearing the looks of com∣placency
while his heart was steeled
with rancour. “Woman, (said he)
these be hopeful babes, if they were
duly nurtured. Go thy ways in peace;
I have taken my resolution.” Her
friends maintained the family for some
time; but it is not in human charity
to persevere: some of them died;
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
some of them grew unfortunate; some
of them fell off; and now the poor
man is reduced to the extremity of in∣digence,
from whence he has no pro∣spect
of being retrieved. The fourth
part of what you would have bestowed
upon the lady would make this poor
man and his family sing with joy.”</P>
<P>He had scarce pronounced these
words when our hero desired the man
might be called, and in a few minutes
he entered the apartment with a low
obeisance. “Mr. Coleby, (said the
knight) I have heard how cruelly you
have been used by your creditor, and
beg you will accept this trifling pre∣sent,
if it can be of any service to you
in your distress.” So saying, he put
five guineas into his hand. The poor
man was so confounded at such an
unlooked-for acquisition, that he stood
motionless and silent, unable to thank
the donor; and Mr. Felton conveyed
him to the door, observing that his
heart was too full for utterance. But,
in a little time, his wife bursting into
the room with her five children,
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
looked around, and going up to Sir
Launcelot, without any direction, ex∣claimed:
“This is the angel sent by
Providence to succour me and my
poor innocents.” Then falling at his
feet, she pressed his hand and bathed
it with her tears—He raised her up
with that complacency which was na∣tural
to his disposition. He kissed all
her children, who were remarkably
handsome and neatly kept, though in
homely apparel; and, giving her his
direction, assured her she might always
apply to him in her distress.</P>
<P>After her departure, he produced a
bank-note for twenty pounds, and
would have deposited it in the hands
of Mr. Felton, to be distributed in
charities among the objects of the
place; but he desired it might be left
with Mr. Norton, who was the pro∣per
person for managing his benevo∣lence;
and he promised to assist the
deputy with his advice in laying it
out.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which Capt. Crowe is sublimed into
the Regions of Astrology.</HEAD>
<P>THREE whole days had our ad∣venturer
prosecuted his inquiry
about the amiable Aurelia, whom he
sought in every place of public and of
private entertainment, or resort, with∣out
obtaining the least satisfactory in∣telligence,
when he received one even∣ing,
from the hands of a porter, who
instantly vanished, the following bil∣let:
“If you would learn the parti∣culars
of Miss Darnel's fate, fail not
to be in the fields by the Foundling
Hospital, precisely at seven o'clock this
evening, when you shall be met by
a person who will give you the sa∣tisfaction
you desire, together with his
reason for addressing you in this mys∣terious
manner.—” Had this intima∣tion
concerned any other subject, per∣haps
the knight would have delibera∣ted
with himself in what manner he
should take a hint so darkly commu∣nicated:
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
but his eagerness to retrieve
the jewel he had lost, divested him of
all his caution; the time of assigna∣tion
was already at hand, and neither
the captain nor his nephew could be
found to accompany him, had he
been disposed to make use of their at∣tendance.
He therefore, after a mo∣ment's
hesitation, repaired to the place
appointed, in the utmost agitation and
anxiety, lest the hour should be elaps∣ed
before his arrival.</P>
<P>Crowe was one of those defective
spirits, who cannot subsist for any
length of time on their own bottoms.
He wanted a familiar prop, upon
which he could disburthen his cares,
his doubts, and his humours: an
humble friend who would endure his
caprices, and with whom he could
communicate, free of all reserve and
restraint. Though he loved his ne∣phew's
person, and admired his parts,
he considered him often as a little pe∣tulant
jackanapes, who presumed up∣on
his superior understanding; and as
for Sir Launcelot, there was some∣thing
<PB N="194" REF="197"/>
in his character that overawed
the seaman, and kept him at a disa∣greeable
distance. He had, in this
dilemma, cast his eyes upon Timothy
Crabshaw, and admitted him to a
considerable share of familiarity and
fellowship. These companions had
been employed in smoaking a social
pipe at an alehouse in the neighbour∣hood,
when the knight made his ex∣cursion;
and returning to the house
about supper-time, found Mr. Clarke
in waiting. The young lawyer was
alarmed when he heard the hour of
ten, without seeing our adventurer,
who had been used to be extremely
regular in his oeconomy; and the
captain and he supped in profound
silence. Finding, upon enquiry among
the servants, that the knight went out
abruptly, in consequence of having
received a biller, Tom began to be
visited with the apprehension of a
duel, and sat the best part of the night
by his uncle, sweating with the ex∣pectation
of seeing our hero brought
home a breathless corse: but no tid∣ings
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
of him arriving, he, about two
in the morning, repaired to his own
lodging, resolved to publish a descrip∣tion
of Sir Launcelot in the news-pa∣pers,
if he should not appear next
day. Crowe did not pass the time
without uneasiness. He was extreme∣ly
concerned at the thought of some
mischief having befallen his friend and
patron; and he was terrified with the
apprehension, that in case Sir Launce∣lot
was murdered, his spirit might
come and give him notice of his fate.
Now he had an insuperable aversion
to all correspondence with the dead;
and taking it for granted, that the spi∣rit
of his departed friend could not ap∣pear
to him except when he should be
alone, and a-bed in the dark, he de∣termined
to pass the remainder of the
night without going to bed. For this
purpose his first care was to visit the
garret, in which Timothy Crabshaw
lay fast asleep, snoring with his mouth
wide open. Him the captain with
difficulty roused, by dint of promising
to regale him with a bowl of rum
<PB N="196" REF="199"/>
punch in the kitchen, where the fire,
which had been extinguished, was
soon rekindled. The ingredients were
fetched from a public-house in the
neighbourhood; for the captain was too
proud to use his interest in the knight's
family, especially at these hours when
all the rest of the servants had retir∣ed
to their repose; and he and Timo∣thy
drank together until day-break,
the conversation turning upon hob∣goblins,
and God's revenge against
murder. The cookmaid lay in a little
apartment contiguous to the kitchen;
and whether disturbed by these hor∣rible
tales of apparitions, or titillated
by the savoury steams that issued from
the punch-bowl, she made a virtue of
necessity, or appetite, and dressing her∣self
in the dark, suddenly appeared be∣fore
them, to the no small perturba∣tion
of both. Timothy, in particular,
was so startled, that in his endeavours
to make an hasty retreat towards the
chimney corner, he overturned the
table; the liquor was spilt, but the
bowl was saved by falling on a heap
<PB N="197" REF="200"/>
of ashes. Mrs. Cook having repri∣manded
him for his foolish fear, de∣clared
she had got up betimes, in or∣der
to scour her saucepans; and the
captain proposed to have the bowl re∣plenished,
if materials could be pro∣cured.
This difficulty was overcome
by Crabshaw; and they sat down with
their new associate to discuss the se∣cond
edition. The knight's sudden
disappearing being brought upon the
carpet, their female companion gave
it as her opinion, that nothing would
be so likely to bring this affair to light,
as going to a cunning man, whom she
had lately consulted about a silver
spoon that was mislaid, and who told
her all the things that she ever did,
and ever would happen to her through
the whole course of her life.</P>
<P>Her two companions pricked up
their ears at this intelligence; and
Crowe asked if the spoon had been
found? She answered in the affirma∣tive,
and said, the cunning man de∣scribed
to a hair the person that should
be her true love, and her wedded hus∣band:
<PB N="198" REF="201"/>
that he was a sea-faring man;
that he was pretty well stricken in
years; a little passionate or so; and
that he went with his fingers clinch∣ed
like, as it were. The captain be∣gan
to sweat at this description, and
mechanically thrust his hands into his
pockets, while Crabshaw, pointing to
him, told her he believed she had got
the right sow by the ear. Crowe
grumbled, that may hap for all that
he should not be brought up by such
a grappling neither. Then he asked
if this cunning man dealt with the
devil, declaring, in that case he would
keep clear of him: for why? because
he must have sold himself to old
scratch; and being a servant of the
devil, how could he be a good sub∣ject
to his majesty? Mrs. Cook assur∣ed
him, the conjurer was a good
christian; and that he gained all his
knowledge by conversing with the
stars and planets. Thus satisfied, the
two friends resolved to consult him as
soon as it should be light; and being
directed to the place of his habitation,
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
set out for it by seven in the morning.
They found the house forsaken, and
had already reached the end of the
lane in their return, when they were
accosted by an old woman, who gave
them to understand, that if they had
occasion for the advice of a fortune∣teller,
as she did suppose they had,
from their stopping at the house where
Dr. Grubble lived, she would conduct
them to a person of much more emi∣nence
in that profession; at the same
time she informed them, that the said
Grubble had been lately sent to Bride∣well;
a circumstance which, with all
his art, he had not been able to fore∣see.
The captain, without any scru∣ple,
put himself and his companion
under convoy of this beldame, who,
through many windings and turnings,
brought them to the door of a ruin∣ous
house, standing in a blind alley;
which door having opened with a key
drawn from her pocket, she intro∣duced
them into a parlour, where
they saw no other furniture than a
naked bench, and some frightful fi∣gures
<PB N="200" REF="203"/>
on the bare walls, drawn, or
rather scrawled with charcoal. Here
she left them locked in, until she
should give the doctor notice of their
arrival; and they amused themselves
with decyphering these characters and
hieroglyphics. The first figure that
engaged their attention, was that of a
man hanging upon a gibbet, which
both considered as an unfavourable
omen, and each endeavoured to avert
from his own person. Crabshaw ob∣served,
that the figure so suspended
was cloathed in a sailor's jacket and
trowsers; a truth which the captain
could not deny; but on the other
hand he affirmed, that the said figure
exhibited the very nose and chin of
Timothy, together with the hump on
one shoulder. A warm dispute en∣sued;
and being maintained with
much acrimonious altercation, might
have dissolved the new-cemented
friendship of these two originals, had
it not been interrupted by the old sy∣bil,
who, coming into the parlour,
intimated that the doctor waited for
<PB N="201" REF="204"/>
them above. She likewise told them
that he never admitted more than one
at a time. This hint occasioned a
fresh contest: the captain insisted up∣on
Crabshaw's making sail a-head, in
order to look out afore; but Timothy
persisted in refusing this honour, de∣claring
he did not pretend to lead, but
he would follow, as in duty bound.
The old gentlewoman abridged the
ceremony, by leading out Crabshaw
with one hand, and locking up Crowe
with the other. The former was
dragged up stairs like a bear to the
stake, not without reluctance and ter∣ror,
which did not at all abate at sight
of the conjurer, with whom he was
immediately shut up by his conduc∣tress;
after she had told him in a
whisper, that he must deposit a shil∣ling
in a little black coffin, supported
by a human skull and thigh bones
crossed, on a stool covered with black
bays, that stood in one corner of the
apartment. The squire having made
this offering with fear and trembling,
ventured to survey the objects around
<PB N="202" REF="205"/>
him, which were very well calculated
to augment his confusion. He saw di∣vers
skeletons hung by the head; the
stuffed skin of a young alligator, a
calf with two heads, and several
snakes suspended from the cieling,
with the jaws of a shark, and a starved
weasle. On another funereal table he
beheld two spheres, between which
lay a book open, exhibiting outlandish
characters, and mathematical dia∣grams.
On one side stood an ink∣standish
with paper, and behind this
desk appeared the conjurer himself in
sable vestments, his head so oversha∣dowed
with hair, that, far from con∣templating
his features, Timothy could
distinguish nothing but a long white
beard, which, for ought he knew,
might have belonged to a four-legged
goat, as well as to a two-legged astro∣loger.</P>
<P>This apparition, which the squire
did not eye without manifest discom∣posure,
extending a white wand, made
certain evolutions over the head of Ti∣mothy,
and having muttered an eja∣culation,
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
commanded him, in a hol∣low
tone, to come forward and declare
his name. Crabshaw thus adjured ad∣vanced
to the altar; and whether
from design, or (which is more pro∣bable)
from confusion, answered “Sa∣muel
Crowe.” The conjurer taking
up the pen, and making a few
scratches on the paper, exclaimed in
a terrific accent; “How! miscreant!
attempt to impose upon the stars?—you
look more like a <HI>crab</HI> than a
<HI>crow,</HI> and was born under the sign of
Cancer.” The squire, almost anni∣hilated
by this exclamation, fell upon
his knees, crying, “I pray yaw, my
lord conjurer's worship, pardon my
ignorance, and down't go to baind me
oover to the Red Sea like—I'se a
poor Yorkshire tyke, and wou'd no
more cheat the stars than I'd cheat
my own vather, as the saying is—
a must be a good hand at <HI>trapping,</HI>
that catches the starns a <HI>napping</HI>—but
as your honour's worship observed;
my name is Tim Crabshaw, of the
East Raiding, groom and squair to Sir
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>
Launcelot Greaves, baron knaight, and
arrant knaight, who ran mad for a
wench, as your worship's conjuration
well knoweth:—the person below is
captain Crowe; and we coom by Mar∣gery
Cook's recommendation to seek
after my master, who is gone away,
or made away, the Lord he knows
how and where.”</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by the
conjurer, who exhorted him to sit
down and compose himself until he
should cast a figure: then he scrawled
the paper, and waving his wand, re∣peated
abundance of gibberish con∣cerning
the number, the names, the
houses, and revolutions of the planets,
with their conjunctions, oppositions,
signs, circles, cycles, trines, and tri∣gons.
When he perceived that this
artifice had its proper effect in disturb∣ing
the brain of Crabshaw, he pro∣ceeded
to tell him from the stars, that
his name was Crabshaw, or Crabs∣claw;
that he was born in the East∣riding
of Yorkshire, of poor, yet ho∣nest
parents, and had some skill in
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
horses; that he served a gentleman,
whose name began with the letter G—,which
gentleman had run mad
for love, and left his family; but
whether he would return alive or dead
the stars had not yet determined. Poor
Timothy was thunderstruck to find
the conjurer acquainted with all these
circumstances, and begged to know if
he mought be so bauld as to ax a ques∣tion
or two about his own fortune.
The astrologer pointing to the little
coffin, our squire understood the hint,
and deposited another shilling. The
sage had recourse to his book, erected
another scheme, performed once more
his airy evolutions with the wand, and
having recited another mystical pre∣amble,
expounded the book of fate
in these words: “You shall neither
die by war nor water, by hunger or
by thirst, nor be brought to the grave
by old age or distemper; but, let me
see—ay, the stars will have it so—you
shall be—exalted—hah!—ay,
that is—hanged for horse-stealing”
—“O, good my lord conjurer!
<PB N="206" REF="209"/>
(roared the squire) I'd as lief give for∣ty
shillings as be hanged.”—“Peace,
sirrah! (cried the other) would you
contradict or reverse the immutable
decrees of fate. Hanging is your de∣stiny;
and hanged you shall be—and
comfort yourself with the reflection,
that as you are not the first, so nei∣ther
will you be the last to swing on
Tyburn-tree.” This comfortable as∣surance
composed the mind of Timo∣thy,
and in a great measure reconciled
him to the prediction. He now pro∣ceeded
in a whining tone, to ask whe∣ther
he should suffer for the first fact?
whether it would be for a horse or a
mare? and of what colour? that he
might know when his hour was
come.”—The conjurer gravely an∣swered,
that he would steal a dappled
gelding on a Wednesday; be cast at
the Old Baily on Thursday, and suffer
on a Friday; and he strenuously re∣commended
it to him, to appear in
the cart with a nosegay in one hand,
and the Whole Duty of Man in the
other.” “But if in case it should be
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
in the winter (said the squire) when a
nosegay can't be had”—Why then
(replied the conjurer) an orange will
do as well.” These material points
being adjusted to the entire satisfaction
of Timothy, he declared he would
bestow another shilling to know the
fortune of an old companion, who
truly did not deserve so much at his
hands; but he could not help loving
him better than e'er a friend he had in
the world. So saying, he dropped a
third offering in the coffin, and desir∣ed
to know the fate of his horse Gil∣bert.
The astrologer having again
consulted his art, pronounced, that
Gilbert would die of the staggers, and
his carcase be given to the hounds; a
sentence, which made a much deeper
impression upon Crabshaw's mind,
than did the prediction of his own un∣timely
and disgraceful fate. He shed a
plenteous shower of tears, and his grief
broke forth in some passionate expres∣sions
of tenderness:—at length he told
the astrologer he would go and send up
the captain, who wanted to consult
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
him about Margery Cook, because as
how she had informed him that Dr.
Grubble had described just such ano∣ther
man as the captain for her true
love; and he had no great stomach
to the match, if so be as the stars
were not bent upon their coming to∣gether.
Accordingly the squire being
dismissed by the conjurer, descended
to the parlour with a rueful length of
face; which being perceived by the
captain, he demanded “What cheer,
ho?” with some signs of apprehen∣sion.
Crabshaw making no return to
this salute, he asked if the conjurer
had taken an observation, and told
him any thing? Then the other re∣plied,
he had told him more than he
desired to know. “Why, an that be
the case, (said the seaman) I have no
occasion to go aloft this trip, brother.”
This evasion would not serve his turn:
old Tisiphone was at hand, and led
him up growling into the hall of au∣dience,
which he did not examine
without trepidation. Having been di∣rected
to the coffin, where he present∣ed
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
half a crown, in hope of rendering
the fates more propitious, the usual
ceremony was performed; and the
doctor addressed him in these words:
“Approach, Raven.” The captain
advancing, “You an't much mistaken,
brother, (said he) heave your eye in∣to
the binnacle, and box your com∣pass;
you'll find I'm a Crowe, not a
Raven, tho'f indeed they be both fowls
of a feather, as the saying is.”—“I
know it; (cried the conjurer) thou art
a northern crow,—a sea crow; not a
crow of prey, but a crow to be preyed
upon:—a crow to be plucked,—to be
flayed,—to be basted,—to be broiled
by Margery upon the gridiron of ma∣trimony—”
The novice changing
colour at this denunciation, “I do
understand your signals, brother, (said
he) and if it be set down in the log∣book
of fate, that we must grapple,
why then, 'ware timbers. But as I
know how the land lies, d'ye see, and
the current of my inclination sets me
off, I shall haul up close to the wind,
and mayhap we shall clear Cape Mar∣gery.
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>
But, howsomever, we shall
leave that reef in the foretopsail:—I
was bound upon another voyage,
d'ye see—to look and to see, and to
know, if so be as how I could pick up
any intelligence along shore, concern∣ing
my friend Sir Launcelot, who slip∣ped
his cable last night, and has lost
company, d'ye see.” “What! (ex∣claimed
the cunning man) art thou a
crow, and can'st not smell carrion?
If thou wouldst grieve for Greaves,
behold his naked carcase lies unburied
to feed the kites, the crows, the
gulls, the rooks, and ravens.—'
“What, broach'd to?” “Dead! as a
boil'd lobster.” “Odd's heart! friend,
these are the heaviest tidings I have
heard these seven long years—there
must have been deadly odds when he
lowered his topsails—Smite my eyes!
I had rather the Mufti had foundered
at sea, with myself and all my gene∣ration
on board—well fare thy soul,
flower of the world! had honest Sam
Crowe been within hail—but what
signifies palavering.” Here the tears
<PB N="211" REF="214"/>
of unaffected sorrow flowed plentiful∣ly
down the furrows of the seaman's
cheeks:—then his grief giving way to
his indignation, “Hark ye, brother
conjurer, (said he) you that can spy
foul weather before it comes, damn
your eyes! why did not you give us
warning of this here squall? Blast my
limbs! I'll make you give an account
of this here damned, horrid, con∣founded
murder, d'ye see—mayhap
you yourself was concerned, d'ye see.—For
my own part, brother, I put
my trust in God, and steer by the
compass; and I value not your paw∣wawing,
and your conjuration, of a
rope's end, d'ye see.”—The conjurer
was by no means pleased, either with
the matter, or the manner of this
address. He therefore began to soothe
the captain's choler, by representing
that he did not pretend to omni∣science,
which was the attribute of God
alone; that human art was fallible
and imperfect; and all that it could
perform, was to discover certain par∣tial
circumstances of any particular ob∣ject
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>
to which its enquiries were direc∣ted:
that being questioned by the
other man, concerning the cause of
his master's disappearing, he had ex∣ercised
his skill upon the subject, and
found reason to believe that Sir Laun∣celot
was assassinated; that he should
think himself happy in being the in∣strument
of bringing the murderers to
justice, though he foresaw they would
of themselves save him that trouble;
for they would quarrel about dividing
the spoil, and one would give infor∣mation
against the other.</P>
<P>The prospect of this satisfaction ap∣peased
the resentment, and, in some
measure, mitigated the grief of cap∣tain
Crowe, who took his leave with∣out
much ceremony; and being join∣ed
by Crabshaw, proceeded with a
heavy heart to the house of Sir Laun∣celot,
where they found the domestics
at breakfast, without exhibiting the
least symptom of concern for their
absent master. Crowe had been wise
enough to conceal from Crabshaw
what he had learned of the knight's
<PB N="213" REF="216"/>
fate. This fatal intelligence he re∣served
for the ear of his nephew, Mr.
Clarke, who did not fail to attend
him in the forenoon.</P>
<P>As for the squire, he did nothing
but ruminate in rueful silence upon
the dappled gelding, the nosegay, and
the predicted fate of Gilbert. Him
he forthwith visited in the stable, and
saluted with the kiss of peace. Then
he bemoaned his fortune with tears,
and by the sound of his own lamenta∣tion,
was Iulled asleep among the
litter.</P>

<P>WE must now leave Capt. Crowe
and his nephew Mr. Clarke,
arguing with great vehemence about
the fatal intelligence obtained from
the conjurer, and penetrate at once
the veil that concealed our hero.
Know then, reader, that Sir Launce∣lot
Greaves, repairing to the place de∣scribed
in the billet which he had
<PB N="214" REF="217"/>
received, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a person
muffled in a cloak <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> began to
amuse him with a reigned story of
Aurelia; to which, while he listened
with great attention, he found him∣self
suddenly surrounded by armed
men, who seized and pinioned down
his arms, took away his sword, and
conveyed him by force into a hack∣ney-coach
provided for the purpose.
In vain he expostulated on this vio∣lence
with three persons who accom∣panied
him in the vehicle. He could
not extort one word by way of reply;
and, from their gloomy aspects, he
began to be apprehensive of assassi∣nation.
Had the carriage passed
through any unfrequented place, he
would have endeavoured to alarm
the inhabitants; but it was already
clear of the town, and his conductors
took care to avoid all villages and in∣habited
houses.</P>
<P>After having travelled about two
miles, the coach stopped at a large
iron-gate, which being opened, our
adventurer was led in silence thro'
<PB N="215" REF="218"/>
a spacious house into a tolerably de∣cent
apartment, which he understood
was intended for his bed-chamber.
In a few minutes after his arrival, he
was visited by a man of no very pre∣possessing
appearance, who endea∣voured
to smoothe his countenance,
which was naturally stern, welcomed
our adventurer to his house; exhort∣ed
him to be of good cheer, assuring
him he should want for nothing;
and desired to know what he would
choose for supper.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, in answer to this ci∣vil
address, begged he would explain
the nature of his confinement, and
the reasons for which his arms were
tied like those of the worst malefac∣tor.
The other postponed till to∣morrow
the explanation he demand∣ed;
but, in the mean time, unbound
his fetters, and as he declined eating,
left him alone to his repose. He took
care, however, in retiring, to double-lock
the door of the room, whose
windows were grated on the outside
with i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="219"/>
The knight, being thus abandon∣ed
to his own meditations, began to
ruminate on the present adventure
with equal surprize and concern; but
the more he revolved circumstances,
the more was he perplexed in his
conjectures. According to the state
of the mind, a very subtle philoso∣pher
is often puzzled by a very plain
proposition; and this was the case
of our adventurer—What made the
strongest impression upon his mind,
was a notion that he was apprehended
on suspicion of treasonable practices,
by a warrant from the secretary of
state, in consequence of some false
malicious information; and that his
prison was no other than the house of
a messenger, set apart for the accom∣modation
of suspected persons. In
this opinion, he comforted himself
by recollecting his own conscious in∣nocence,
and reflecting that he should
be intitled to the privilege of habeas
corpus, as the act including that ine∣stimable
jewel, was happily not sus∣pended
at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="220"/>
Consoled by this self-assurance, he
quietly resigned himself to slumber;
but, before he fell asleep, he was very
disagreeably undeceived in his con∣jecture.
His ears were all at once sa∣luted
with a noise from the next room,
conveyed in distinct bounces against
the wainscot; then an hoarse voice
exclaimed, “Bring up the artillery—let
Brutandorf's brigade advance—de∣tach
my black hussars to ravage the
country—let them be new-booted—take
particular care of the spur-lea∣thers—make
a desert of Lusatia—bombard
the suburbs of Pera—go, tell
my brother Henry to pass the Elbe
at Meissen with forty battalions and
fifty squadrons—so ho, you major∣general
Donder, why don't you finish
your second parallel?—send hither
the engineer Schittenbach—I'll lay
all the shoes in my shop, the breach
will be practicable in four and twenty
hours—don't tell me of your works—you
and your works may be damn'd”—</P>
<P>“Assuredly, (cried another voice
from a different quarter) he that
<PB N="218" REF="221"/>
thinks to be saved by works is in a
state of utter reprobation—I myself
was a prophane weaver, and trusted
to the rottenness of works—I kept my
journeymen and 'prentices at constant
work; and my heart was set upon
the riches of this world, which was
a wicked work—but now I have got
a glimpse of the new-light—I feel
the operations of grace—I am of the
new birth—I abhor good works—I
detest all working but the working
of the spirit—Avaunt, Satan—O!
how I thirst for communication with
our sister Jolly”—</P>
<P>“The communication is already
open with the Marche, (said the first)
but as for thee, thou caitif, who hast
presumed to disparage my works, I'll
have thee rammed into a mortar with
a double charge of powder, and
thrown into the enemy's quarters.”</P>
<P>This dialogue operated like a train
upon many other inhabitants of the
place: one swore he was within three
vibrations of finding the longitude,
when this noise confounded his cal∣culation:
<PB N="219" REF="222"/>
a second, in broken Eng∣lish,
complained he vas distorped in
the moment of de proshection—a
third, in the character of his holiness,
denounced interdiction, excommuni∣cation,
and anathemas; and swore by
St. Peter's keys, they should howl ten
thousand years in purgatory, without
the benefit of a single mass. A
fourth began to hollow in all the vo∣ciferation
of a fox-hunter in the
chace; and in an instant the whole
house was in an uproar—The cla∣mour,
however, was of a short du∣ration.
The different chambers be∣ing
opened successively, every indi∣vidual
was effectually silenced by the
sound of one cabalistical word, which
was no other than <HI>waistcoat:</HI> a charm
which at once cowed the king of
P—, dispossessed the fanatic, dumb∣founded
the mathematician, dismayed
the alchemist, deposed the pope, and
deprived the 'squire of all utterance.</P>
<P>Our adventurer was no longer in
doubt concerning the place to which
he had been conveyed; and the more
<PB N="220" REF="223"/>
he reflected on his situation, the more
he was overwhelmed with the most
perplexing chagrin. He could not
conceive by whose means he had been
immured in a mad-house; but he
heartily repented of his knight-erran∣try,
as a frolic which might have ve∣ry
serious consequences, with respect
to his future life and fortune. After
mature deliberation, he resolved to
demean himself with the utmost cir∣cumspection,
well knowing that every
violent transport would be interpreted
into an undeniable symptom of insa∣nity.
He was not without hope of
being able to move his jailor by a due
administration of that which is gene∣rally
more efficacious than all the
flowers of elocution; but when he
rose in the morning, he found his
pockets had been carefully examined,
and emptied of all his papers and
cash.</P>
<P>The keeper entering, he enquired
about these particulars, and was gi∣ven
to understand that they were all
safely deposited for his use, to be
<PB N="221" REF="224"/>
forthcoming at a proper season: but,
at present, as he should want for no∣thing,
he had no occasion for money.
The knight acquiesced in this decla∣ration,
and eat his breakfast in quiet.
About eleven, he received a visit from
the physician, who contemplated his
looks with great solemnity; and hav∣ing
examined his pulse, shook his
head, saying, “Well, Sir, how d'ye
do?—come, don't be dejected—
every thing is for the best—you are in
very good hands, Sir, I assure you:
and I dare say will refuse nothing that
may be thought conducive to the re∣covery
of your health.”—</P>
<P>“Doctor, (said our hero) if it is
not an improper question to ask, I
should be glad to know your opinion
of my disorder”—“O! Sir, as to that
—(replied the physician) your disor∣der
is a—kind of a—Sir, 'tis very
common in this country—a sort of
a”—“Do you think my distemper
is madness, doctor?”—“O Lord!
Sir,—not absolute madness—no—not
madness—you have heard, no doubt,
<PB N="222" REF="225"/>
of what is called a weakness of the
nerves, Sir,—tho' that is a very inac∣curate
expression; for this phrase,
denoting a morbid excess of sensation,
seems to imply that sensation itself is
owing to the loose cohesion of those
material particles which constitute the
nervous substance, inasmuch as the
quantity of every effect must be pro∣portionable
to its cause; now you'll
please to take notice, Sir, if the case
were really what these words seem to
import, all bodies, whose particles do
not cohere with too great a degree of
proximity, would be nervous; that
is, endued with sensation—Sir, I shall
order some cooling things to keep you
in due temperature; and you'll do
very well—Sir, your humble servant.”</P>
<P>So saying, he returned, and our
adventurer could not but think it was
very hard that one man should not
dare to ask the most ordinary question
without being reputed mad, while
another should talk nonsense by the
hour, and yet be esteemed as an ora∣cle
—The master of the house find∣ing
<PB N="223" REF="226"/>
Sir Launcelot so tame and tracta∣ble,
indulged him after dinner with
a walk in a little private garden, un∣der
the eye of a servant who follow∣ed
him at a distance. Here he was
saluted by a brother prisoner, a man
seemingly turned of thirty, tall and
thin, with staring eyes, a hook-nose,
and a face covered with pimples.</P>
<P>The usual compliments having
passed, the stranger, without further
ceremony, asked if he would oblige
him with a chew of tobacco, or could
spare him a mouthful of any sort of
cordial, declaring he had not tasted
brandy since he came to the house—
The knight assured him it was not
in his power to comply with his re∣quest;
and began to ask some ques∣tions
relating to the character of their
landlord, which the stranger repre∣sented
in very unfavourable colours.
He described him as a ruffian, capa∣ble
of undertaking the darkest schemes
of villainy. He said his house was a
repository of the most flagrant iniqui∣ties:
that it contained fathers kidnap∣ped
<PB N="224" REF="227"/>
by their children, wives confined
by their husbands, gentlemen of for∣tune
sequestered by their relations,
and innocent persons immured by the
malice of their adversaries. He
assirmed this was his own case; and
asked if our hero had never heard of
Dick Distich, the poet and satirist.
“Ben Bullock and I (said he)” were
confident against the world in arms—
did you never see his ode to me be∣ginning
with “Fair blooming youth.”
We were sworn brothers, admired
and praised, and quoted each other,
Sir: we denounced war against all the
world, actors, authors, and critics; and
having drawn the sword, threw away
the scabbard—we pushed through
thick and thin, hacked and hewed
helter skelter, and became as formi∣dable
to the writers of the age, as the
Boeotian band of Thebes. My friend
Bullock, indeed, was once rolled in
the kennel; but soon
<Q><L>He vig'rous rose, and from th' effluvia strong</L>
<L>Imbib'd new life, and scour'd and stunk along.</L></Q>
<PB N="225" REF="228"/>
Here is a satire, which I wrote in an
alehouse when I was drunk—I can
prove it by the evidence of the land∣lord
and his wife: I fancy you'll own
I have some right to say with my
friend Horace,
<Q><L>Qui me commorit, meliùs non tangere
clamo;</L>
<L>Flebit et insignis toto cantabitur urbe.—</L></Q></P>
<P>The knight, having perused the
papers, declared his opinion that the
verses were tolerably good; but at
the same time observed that the au∣thor
had reviled as ignorant dunces
several persons who had writ with
reputation, and were generally al∣lowed
to have genius: a circumstance
that would detract more from his
candour, than could be allowed to
his capacity.</P>
<P>“Damn their genius! (cried the
satyrist) a pack of impertinent ras∣cals!
I tell you, Sir, Ben Bullock
and I had determined to crush all that
were not of our own party—besides,
<PB N="226" REF="229"/>
I said before, this piece was written
in drink.” “Was you drunk too
when it was printed and published?”
“Yes, the printer shall make affida∣vit
that I was never otherwise than
drunk or maudlin, till my enemies,
on pretence that my brain was turn∣ed,
conveyed me to this infernal
mansion—”</P>
<P>“They seem to have been your
best friends, (said the knight) and
have put the most tender interpreta∣tion
on your conduct; for, waving
the plea of insanity, your character
must stand as that of a man who hath
some small share of genius, without
an atom of integrity—Of all those
whom Pope lashed in his Dunciad,
there was not one who did not richly
deserve the imputation of dulness; and
every one of them had provoked the
satirist by a personal attack. In this
respect the English poet was much
more honest than his French pattern
Boileau, who stigmatized several men
of acknowledged genius; such as
Quinault, Perrault, and the cele∣brated
<PB N="227" REF="230"/>
Lulli; for which reason every
man of a liberal turn must, in spite of
all his poetical merit, despise him as
a rancorous knave. If this disingenu∣ous
conduct cannot be forgiven in a
writer of his superior genius, who will
pardon it in you whose name is not
half emerged from obscurity?”</P>
<P>“Heark ye, friend, (replied the
bard) keep your pardon and your
counsel for those who ask it; or, if
you will force them upon people,
take one piece of advice in return: If
you don't like your present situation,
apply for a committee without delay:
they'll find you too much of a fool to
have the least tincture of madness;
and you'll be released without further
scruple: in that case I shall rejoice in
your deliverance; you will be freed
from confinement, and I shall be hap∣pily
deprived of your conversation.”</P>
<P>So saying, he flew off at a tangent,
and our knight could not help smil∣ing
at the peculiar virulence of his dis∣position.
Sir Launcelot then endea∣voured
to enter into conversation with
<PB N="228" REF="231"/>
his attendant, by asking how long
Mr. Distich had resided in the house;
but he might as well have addressed
himself to a Turkish mute: the fel∣low
either pretended ignorance, or
refused an answer to every question
that was proposed. He would not
even disclose the name of his land∣lord,
nor inform him whereabouts the
house was situated.</P>
<P>Finding himself agitated with im∣patience
and indignation, he returned
to his apartment, and the door being
locked upon him, began to review,
not without horror, the particulars of
his fate. “How little reason (said he
to himself) have we to boast of the
blessings enjoyed by the British sub∣ject,
if he holds them on such a pre∣carious
tenure: if a man of rank and
property may be thus kidnapped even
in the midst of the capital; if he may
be seized by ruffians, insulted, robbed,
and conveyed to such a prison as this,
from which there seems to be no pos∣sibility
of escape; Should I be in∣dulged
with pen, ink, and paper, and
<PB N="229" REF="232"/>
appeal to my relations, or to the ma∣gistrates
of my country, my letters
would be intercepted by those who
superintend my confinement. Should
I try to alarm the neighbourhood, my
cries would be neglected as those of
some unhappy lunatic under necessary
correction. Should I employ the force
which heaven has lent me, I might
imbrue my hands in blood, and after
all find it impossible to escape through
a number of successive doors, locks,
bolts, and centinels. Should I en∣deavour
to tamper with the servant,
he might discover my design, and
then I should be abridged of the little
comfort I enjoy. People may inveigh
against the Bastile in France, and the
Inquisition in Portugal; but I would
ask, if either of these be in reality so
dangerous or dreadful as a private
mad-house in England, under the di∣rection
of a ruffian. The Bastile is
a state prison, the Inquisition is a spi∣ritual
tribunal; but both are under
the direction of government. It sel∣dom,
<PB N="230" REF="233"/>
if ever, happens that a man in∣tirely
innocent is confined in either;
or, if he should, he lays his account
with a legal trial before established
judges. But in England, the most
innocent person upon earth is liable to
be immured for life under the pretext
of lunacy, sequestered from his wife,
children, and friends, robbed of his
fortune, deprived even of necessaries,
and subjected to the most brutal treat∣ment
from a low-bred barbarian, who
raises an ample fortune on the misery
of his fellow-creatures, and may, dur∣ing
his whole life, practise this horrid
oppression, without question or con∣troul.”</P>
<P>This uncomfortable reverie was in∣terrupted
by a very unexpected sound
that seemed to issue from the other
side of a thick party-wall. It was a
strain of vocal music, more plaintive
than the widow'd turtle's moan, more
sweet and ravishing than Philomel's
love-warbled song. Through his ear
it instantly pierced into his heart; for
at once he recognized it to be the voice
<PB N="231" REF="234"/>
of his adored Aurelia. Heavens!
what was the agitation of his soul,
when he made this discovery! how
did every nerve quiver! how did his
heart throb with the most violent
emotion! He ran round the room in
distraction, foaming like a lion in the
toil—then he placed his ear close to
the partition, and listened as if his
whole soul was exerted in his sense of
hearing. When the sound ceased to
vibrate on his ear, he threw himself
on the bed; he groaned with anguish,
he exclaimed in broken accents; and
in all probability his heart would have
burst, had not the violence of his sor∣row
found vent in a flood of tears.</P>
<P>These first transports were succeed∣ed
by a fit of impatience, which had
well-nigh deprived him of his senses
in good earnest. His surprize at find∣ing
his lost Aurelia in such a place,
the seeming impossibility of relieving
her, and his unspeakable eagerness to
contrive some scheme for profiting by
the interesting discovery he had made,
concurred in brewing up a second ex∣tasy,
<PB N="232" REF="235"/>
during which he acted a thou∣sand
extravagancies, which it was well
for him the attendants did not observe.
Perhaps it was well for the servant that
he did not enter while the paroxysm
prevailed: had this been the case, he
might have met with the fate of Ly∣chas,
whom Hercules in his frenzy
destroyed.</P>
<P>Before the cloth was laid for sup∣per,
he was calm enough to conceal
the disorder of his mind: but he
complained of the head-ach, and de∣sired
he might be next day visited by
the physician, to whom he resolved to
explain himself in such a manner, as
should make an impression upon him,
provided he was not altogether desti∣tute
of conscience and humanity.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Knot that puzzles human Wisdom,

<P>WHEN the doctor made his next
appearance in Sir Launcelot's
apartment, the knight addressed him
in these words: “Sir, the practice of
medicine is one of the most honour∣able
professions exercised among the
sons of men; a profession which hath
been revered at all periods and in all
nations, and even held sacred in the
most polished ages of antiquity. The
scope of it is to preserve the being, and
confirm the health of our fellow-crea∣tures;
of consequence, to sustain the
blessings of society, and crown life
with fruition. The character of a
physician, therefore, not only suppo∣ses
natural sagacity, and acquired eru∣dition,
but it also implies every deli∣cacy
of sentiment, every tenderness of
nature, and every virtue of humani∣ty.
<PB N="234" REF="237"/>
That these qualities are centered
in you, doctor, I would willingly be∣lieve:
but it will be sufficient for my
purpose, that you are possessed of com∣mon
integrity. To whose concern I
am indebted for your visits, you best
know: but if you understand the art
of medicine, you must be sensible by
this time, that with respect to me your
prescriptions are altogether unnecessa∣ry
—come, Sir, you cannot—you don't
believe that my intellects are disor∣dered.
Yet, granting me to be real∣ly
under the influence of that deplor∣able
malady, no person has a right to
treat me as a lunatic, or to sue out a
commission, but my nearest kindred.
—That you may not plead ignorance
of my name and family, you shall un∣derstand
that I am Sir Launcelot
Greaves, of the county of York, ba∣ronet;
and that my nearest relation is
Sir Reginald Meadows, of Cheshire,
the eldest son of my mother's sister—
that gentleman, I am sure, had no
concern in seducing me by false pre∣tences
under the clouds of night into
<PB N="235" REF="238"/>
the fields, where I was surprised,
overpowered, and kidnapped by arm∣ed
ruffians. Had he really believed
me insane, he would have pro∣ceeded
according to the dictates of
honour, humanity, and the laws of
his country. Situated as I am, I have
a right, by making application to the
lord chancellor, to be tried by a jury
of honest men.—But of that right I
cannot avail myself, while I remain
at the mercy of a brutal miscreant, in
whose house I am inclosed, unless you
contribute your assistance. Your as∣sistance,
therefore, I demand, as you
are a gentleman, a christian, and a
fellow-subject, who, tho' every other
motive should be overlooked, ought
to interest himself in my case as a
common concern, and concur with
all your power towards the punish∣ment
of those who dare commit such
outrages against the liberty of your
country.”</P>
<P>The doctor seemed to be a little
disconcerted; but after some recollec∣tion,
resumed his air of sufficiency and
<PB N="236" REF="239"/>
importance, and assured our adventu∣rer
he would do him all the service in
his power; but, in the mean time,
advised him to take the potion he had
prescribed.</P>
<P>The knight's eyes lightning with
indignation, “I am now convinced,
(cried he) that you are accomplice in
the villainy which has been practised
upon me; that you are a sordid
wretch, without principle or feeling,
a disgrace to the faculty, and a re∣proach
to human nature—yes, sirrah,
you are the most perfidious of all as∣sassins
—you are the hireling minister
of the worst of all villains; who from
motives even baser than malice, envy,
and revenge, rob the innocent of all
the comforts of life, brand them with
the imputation of madness, the most
cruel species of slander, and wantonly
protract their misery, by leaving them
in the most shocking confinement, a
prey to reflections infinitely more bit∣ter
than death—but I will be calm—
do me justice at your peril. I demand
the protection of the legislature—if I
<PB N="237" REF="240"/>
am refused,—remember, a day of
reckoning will come—you and the rest
of the miscreants who have combined
against me, must, in order to cloak
your treachery, have recourse to mur∣der;
an expedient which I believe
you very capable of embracing, or a
man of my rank and character cannot
be much longer concealed—Trem∣ble,
caitif, at the thoughts of my re∣lease
—in the mean time, be gone,
lest my just resentment impel me to
dash out your brains upon that mar∣ble
—away—”</P>
<P>The honest doctor was not so firm∣ly
persuaded of his patient's lunacy as
to reject his advice, which he made
what haste he could to follow, when
an unexpected accident intervened.
That this may be properly introduced,
we must return to the knight's brace
of trusty friends, captain Crowe and
lawyer Clarke, whom we left in sor∣rowful
deliberation upon the fate of
their patron. Clarke's genius being
rather more fruitful in resources than
that of the seaman, he suggested an
<PB N="238" REF="241"/>
advertisement, which was according∣ly
inserted in the daily papers; im∣porting
that, “Whereas a gentleman
of considerable rank and fortune had
suddenly disappeared on such a night
from his house near Golden-square,
in consequence of a letter delivered
to him by a porter; and there is great
reason to believe some violence hath
been offered to his life: any person
capable of giving such information as
may tend to clear up this dark trans∣action,
shall, by applying to Mr. Tho∣mas
Clarke, attorney, at his lodgings
in Upper Brook-street, receive proper
security for the reward of one hun∣dred
guineas, to be paid to him upon
his making the discovery required.”</P>
<P>The porter who delivered the let∣ter
appeared accordingly, but could
give no other information, except that
it was put into his hand with a shil∣ling,
by a man muffled up in a great
coat, who stopped him for the pur∣pose,
in his passing through Queen-street.
It was necessary that the ad∣vertisement
should produce an effect
<PB N="239" REF="242"/>
upon another person, who was no
other than the hackney coachman,
who drove our hero to the place of
his imprisonment. This fellow had
been enjoined secrecy, and indeed
bribed to hold his tongue, by a con∣siderable
gratification, which, it was
supposed, would have been effec∣tual,
as the man was a master coach∣man
in good circumstances, and well
known to the keeper of the mad∣house,
by whom he had been em∣ployed
on former occasions of the
same nature. Perhaps his fidelity to
his employer, reinforced by the hope
of many future jobbs of that kind,
might have been proof against the of∣fer
of fifty pounds; but double that
sum was a temptation he could not
resist. He no sooner read the intima∣tion
in the Daily Advertiser, over his
morning's pot at an ale-house, than
he entered into consultation with his
own thoughts; and having no reason
to doubt that this was the very fare he
had conveyed, he resolved to earn the
reward, and abstain from all such ad∣ventures
<PB N="240" REF="243"/>
in time coming. He had the
precaution, however, to take an at∣torney
along with him to Mr. Clarke,
who entered into a conditional bond;
and, with the assistance of his uncle,
deposited the money, to be forthcom∣ing
when the conditions should be ful∣filled.
These previous measures being
taken, the coachman declared what
he knew, and discovered the house in
which Sir Launcelot had been immur∣ed.
He moreover accompanied our
two adherents to a judge's chamber,
where he made oath to the truth of
his information; and a warrant was im∣ediately
granted to search the house of
Bernard Shackle, and set at liberty Sir
Launcelot Greaves, if there found.</P>
<P>Fortified with this authority, they
engaged a constable with a formidable
posse, and embarking them in coaches,
repaired, with all possible expedition,
to the house of Mr. Shackle, who
did not think proper to dispute their
claim, but admitted them, though
not without betraying evident symp∣toms
of consternation. One of
<PB N="241" REF="244"/>
the servants directing them, by his
master's order, to Sir Launcelot's
apartment; they hurried up stairs in
a body, occasioning such a noise as
did not fail to alarm the physician,
who had just opened the door to re∣tire,
when he perceived their irrup∣tion.
Captain Crowe conjecturing he
was guilty, from the confusion that
appeared in his countenance, made no
scruple of seizing him by the collar,
as he endeavoured to retreat; while
the tender-hearted Tom Clarke, run∣ning
up to the knight with his eyes
brimful of joy and affection, forgot all
the forms of distant respect, and
throwing his arms around his neck,
blubbered in his bosom.</P>
<P>Our hero did not receive this proof
of his attachment unmoved. He
strained him in his embrace, honour∣ed
him with the title of his deliverer,
and asked him by what miracle he
had discovered the place of his con∣finement.
The lawyer began to un∣fold
the various steps he had taken,
with equal minuteness and self-com∣placency,
<PB N="242" REF="245"/>
when Crowe, dragging the
doctor still by the collar, shook his
old friend by the hand, protesting he
was never so overjoyed since he got
clear of a Sallee Rover on the coast
of Barbary; and that two glasses ago
he would have started all the money
he had in the world in the hold of any
man who would have shewn Sir Laun∣celot
safe at his moorings. The knight,
having made a proper return to this
sincere manifestation of good will, de∣sired
him to dismiss that worthless
fellow, meaning the doctor, who,
finding himself released, withdrew
with some precipitation.</P>
<P>Then our adventurer, attended by
his friends, walked with a deliberate
pace to the outward gate, which he
found open, and getting into one of
the coaches, was entertained by the
way to his own house with a detail
of every measure which had been
pursued for his release. In his own
parlour he found Mrs. Dolly Cowship,
who had been waiting with great fear
and impatience for the issue of Mr.
<PB N="243" REF="246"/>
Clarke's adventure. She now fell up∣on
her knees, and bathed the knight's
hand with tears of joy; while the face
of this young woman, recalling the
idea of her mistress, roused his heart
to strong emotions, and stimulated his
mind to the immediate atchievement
he had already planned. As for Crab∣shaw,
he was not the last to signify
his satisfaction at his master's return.
After having kissed the hem of his
garment, he retired to the stable,
where he communicated these tidings
to his friend Gilbert, whom he saddled
and bridled: the same office he per∣formed
for Bronzomarte; then put∣ting
on his squire-like attire and ac∣coutrements,
he mounted one, and
led the other to the knight's door,
before which he paraded, uttering
from time to time repeated shouts, to
the no small entertainment of the po∣pulace,
until he received orders to
house his companions. Thus com∣manded,
he led them back to their
stalls, resumed his livery, and rejoin∣ed
his fellow-servants, who were re∣solved
<PB N="244" REF="247"/>
to celebrate the day with ban∣quets
and rejoicings.</P>
<P>Their master's heart was not suffi∣ciently
at ease to share in their festivi∣ty.
He held a consultation with his
friends in the parlour, whom he ac∣quainted
with the reasons he had to
believe Miss Darnel was confined in
the same house which had been his
prison: a circumstance which filled
them with equal pleasure and astonish∣ment.
Dolly, in particular, weeping
plentifully, conjured him to deliver
her dear lady without delay. Nothing
now remained but to concert the plan
for her deliverance. As Aurelia had
informed Dolly of her connection
with Mrs. Kawdle, at whose house
she proposed to lodge, before she was
overtaken on the road by her uncle,
this particular was now imparted to
the council, and struck a light which
seemed to point out the direct way to
Miss Darnel's enlargement.</P>
<P>Our hero, accompanied by Mrs.
Cowslip, and Tom Clarke, set out
immediately for the house of Dr.
<PB N="245" REF="248"/>
Kawdle, who happened to be abroad;
but his wife received them with great
courtesy. She was a well-bred, sen∣sible,
genteel woman, and strongly
attached to Aurelia by the ties of af∣fection
as well as of consanguinity.
She no sooner learned the situation of
her cousin than she expressed the most
impatient concern for her being set at
liberty; and assured Sir Launcelot she
would concur in any scheme he should
propose for that purpose. There was
no room for hesitation or choice; he
attended her immediately to the
judge, who, upon proper application,
issued another search-warrant for Aure∣lia
Darnel. The constable and his
posse were again retained; and Sir
Launcelot Greaves once more crossed
the threshold of Mr. Bernard Shackle.
Nor was the search-warrant the only
implement of justice with which he
had furnished himself for this visit.
In going thither, they agreed upon
the method in which they should in∣troduce
themselves gradually to Miss
Darnel, that her tender nature might
<PB N="246" REF="249"/>
not be too much shocked by their sud∣den
appearance.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the house
therefore, and produced their creden∣tials,
in consequence of which a fe∣male
attendant was directed to shew
the lady's apartment, Mrs. Dolly first
entered the chamber of the accom∣plished
Aurelia, who, lifting up her
eyes, screamed aloud, and flew into
the arms of her faithful Cowslip.
Some minutes elapsed before Dolly
could make shift to exclaim,—“Am
coom to live and daai with my be∣loved
leady!” “Dear Dolly! (cried
her mistress) I cannot express the
pleasure I have in seeing you again—Good
heaven! what solitary hours of
keen affliction have I passed since we
parted!—but, tell me, how did you
discover the place of my retreat?—has
my uncle relented?—do I owe
your coming to his indulgence?”</P>
<P>Dolly answered in the negative;
and by degrees gave her to understand
that her cousin, Mrs. Kawdle, was in
the next room; that lady immediate∣ly
<PB N="247" REF="250"/>
appeared, and a very tender scene
of recognition passed between the two
relations. It was she who, in the
course of conversation, perceiving that
Aurelia was perfectly composed, de∣clared
the happy tidings of the ap∣proaching
deliverance. When the
other eagerly insisted upon knowing
to whose humanity and address she
was indebted for this happy turn of
fortune, her cousin declared the obli∣gation
was due to a young gentleman
of Yorkshire, called Sir Launcelot
Greaves. At mention of that name,
her face was overspread with a crim∣son
glow, and her eyes beamed re∣doubled
splendor.—“Cousin, (said
she, with a sigh) I know not what to
say—that gentleman,—Sir Launce∣lot
Greaves was surely born—Lord
bless me!—I tell you, cousin, he has
been my guardian angel.—”</P>
<P>Mrs. Kawdle, who had maintained
a correspondence with her by letters,
was no stranger to the former part of
the connexion subsisting between those
two lovers, and had always favoured
<PB N="248" REF="251"/>
the pretensions of our hero, without
being acquainted with his person. She
now observed with a smile, that as
Aurelia esteemed the knight her guar∣dian
angel, and he adored her as a
demi-deity, nature seemed to have
intended them for each other; for
such sublime ideas exalted them both
above the sphere of ordinary mortals.
She then ventured to intimate that he
was in the house, impatient to pay his
respects in person. At this declara∣tion,
the colour vanished from her
cheeks; which, however, soon under∣went
a total suffusion. Her heart
panted; her bosom heaved; and her
gentle frame was agitated by trans∣ports
rather violent than unpleasing.
She soon, however, recollected her∣self,
and her native serenity return∣ed;
when, rising from her seat, she
declared she would see him in the next
apartment, where he stood in the most
tumultuous suspence, waiting for per∣mission
to approach her person. Here
she broke in upon him, arrayed in an
elegant white undress, the emblem of
<PB N="249" REF="252"/>
her purity, beaming forth the emana∣tions
of amazing beauty, warmed and
improved with a glow of gratitude and
affection. His heart was too big for
utterance; he ran towards her with
rapture, and, throwing himself at her
feet, imprinted a respectful kiss upon
her lilly hand. “This, divine Au∣relia,
(cried he) is a foretaste of that
ineffable bliss, which you was born to
bestow!—Do I then live to see you
smile again? to see you restored to li∣berty;
your mind at ease, and your
health unimpaired!” “You have lived
(said she) to see my obligations to Sir
Launcelot Greaves accumulated in
such a manner, that a whole life spent
in acknowledgment will scarce suffice
to demonstrate a due sense of his
goodness.” “You greatly over-rate
my services, which have been rather
the duties of common humanity, than
the efforts of a generous passion, too
noble to be thus evinced;—but let
not my unseasonable transports detain
you a moment longer on this detested
scene—Give me leave to hand you
into the coach, and commit you to
<PB N="250" REF="253"/>
the care of this good lady, attended
by this honest young gentleman, who
is my particular friend.” So saying,
he presented Mr. Thomas Clarke,
who had the honour to salute the fair
hand of the ever amiable Aurelia.</P>
<P>The ladies being safely coached un∣der
the escorte of the lawyer, Sir
Launcelot assured them he should wait
on them in the evening, at the house
of Dr. Kawdle, whither they imme∣diately
directed their course. Our
hero, who remained with the con∣stable
and his gang, enquired for Mr.
Bernard Shackle, upon whose person
he intended to serve a writ of conspi∣racy,
over and above a prosecution for
robbery, in consequence of his having
disencumbered the knight of his mo∣ney
and other effects, on the first
night of his confinement. Mr. Shackle
had discretion enough to avoid this
encounter, and even to anticipate the
indictment for felony, by directing
one of his servants to restore the cash
and papers, which our adventurer ac∣cordingly
received, before he quitted
the house.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="254"/>
In the prosecution of his search
after Shackle, he chanced to enter
the chamber of the bard, whom he
found in dishabille, writing at a ta∣ble,
with a bandage over one eye,
and his head covered with a night∣cap
of bays. The knight, having
made an apology for his intrusion,
desired to know if he could be of
any service to Mr. Distich, as he was
now at liberty to use the little influence
he had, for the relief of his fellow
sufferers.—The poet having eyed him
for some time askance, “I told you,
(said he) your stay in this place would
be of short duration.—I have sustained
a small disaster on my left eye, from
the hands of a rascally cordwainer,
who pretends to believe himself the
king of Prussia; and I am now in
the very act of galling his majesty
with keen iambicks.—If you can help
me to a roll of tobacco, and a bottle
of geneva, so;—If you are not so
inclined, your humble servant—I
shall share in the joy of your deliver∣ance.”</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="255"/>
The knight declined gratifying him
in these particulars, which he appre∣hended
might be prejudicial to his
health; but offered his assistance in
redressing his grievances, provided he
laboured under any cruel treatment,
or inconvenience. “I comprehend
the full extent of your generosity:
(replied the satyrist) you are willing to
assist me in every thing, except the
only circumstances in which assistance
is required—God b' w' ye—If you
see Ben Bullock, tell him I wish he
would not dedicate any more of his
works to me.—Damn the fellow;
he has changed his note, and begins
to snivel.—For my part, I stick to
my former maxim; defy all the world,
and will die hard, even if death should
be preceded by damnation.”</P>
<P>The knight finding him incorrigible,
left him to the slender chance of be∣ing
one day comforted by the dram∣bottle;
but resolved, if possible, to
set on foot an accurate inquiry into
the oeconomy and transactions of this
private inquisition, that ample justice
<PB N="253" REF="256"/>
might be done in favour of every injur∣ed
individual confined within its walls.
In the afternoon, he did not fail to
visit his Aurelia; and all the protes∣tations
of their mutual passion were
once more interchanged. He now
produced the letter, which had caused
such fatal disquiet in his bosom; and
Miss Darnel no sooner eyed the paper,
than she recollected it was a formal
dismission, which she had intended
and directed for Mr. Sycamore. This
the uncle had intercepted, and cun∣ningly
inclosed in another cover, ad∣dressed
to Sir Launcelot Greaves, who
was now astonished beyond measure
to see the mystery so easily unfolded.
The joy that now diffused itself in the
hearts of our lovers, is more easily
conceived than described; but, in
order to give a stability to this mutual
satisfaction, it was necessary that Au∣relia
should be secured from the ty∣ranny
of her uncle, whose power of
guardianship would not otherwise for
some months expire.</P>
<P>Dr. Kawdle and his lady having
<PB N="254" REF="257"/>
entered into their deliberations on
this subject, it was agreed that Miss
Darnel should have recourse to the
protection of the lord-chancellor: but
such application was rendered unne∣cessary
by the unexpected arrival of
John Clump with the following letter
to Mrs. Kawdle from the steward of
Anthony Darnel, dated at Aurelia's
house in the country. “Madam, it
hath pleased God to afflict Mr. Darnel
with a severe stroke of the dead pal∣sy.
—He was taken yesterday, and
now lies insensible, seemingly at the
point of death. Among the papers
in his pocket, I found the inclosed,
by which it appears that my honour∣ed
young lady Miss Darnel is confined
in a private mad-house. I am afraid
Mr. Darnel's fate is a just judgment
of God upon him for his cruelty to
that excellent person. I need not ex∣hort
you, madam, to take, imme∣diately
upon the receipt of this, such
measures as will be necessary for the
enlargement of my poor young lady.
In the mean time, I shall do the need∣ful
<PB N="255" REF="258"/>
for the preservation of her property
in this place, and send you an account
of any further alteration that may
happen; being very respectfully, Ma∣dam,
your most obedient humble ser∣vant,
Ralph Mattocks.”</P>
<P>Clump had posted up to London
with this intimation, on the wings
of love, and being covered with clay
from the heels to the eyes upwards,
he appeared in such an unfavourable
light at Dr. Kawdle's door, that the
footman refused him admittance.
Nevertheless, he pushed him aside,
and fought his way up-stairs into the
dining-room, where the company was
not a little astonished at such an ap∣parition.
The fellow himself was no
less amazed at seeing Aurelia, and
his own sweetheart Mrs. Dolly Cow∣slip.
He forthwith fell upon his
knees, and, in silence, held out the
letter, which was taken by the doctor,
and presented to his wife, according
to the direction. She did not fail to
communicate the contents, which were
far from being unwelcome to the in∣dividuals
<PB N="256" REF="259"/>
who composed this little so∣ciety.
Mr. Clump was honoured
with the approbation of his young la∣dy,
who commended him for his zeal
and expedition; bestowed upon him
an handsome gratuity in the mean
time, and desired to see him again
when he should be properly refreshed
after the fatigue he had undergone.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Clarke being con∣sulted
on this occasion, gave it as
his opinion, that Miss Darnel should
without delay, choose another guar∣dian
for the few months that remained
of her minority. The opinion was
confirmed by the advice of some emi∣nent
lawyers, to whom immediate re∣course
was had; and Dr. Kawdle,
being the person pitched upon for
this office, the necessary forms were
executed with all possible dispatch.
The first use the doctor made of his
guardianship was to sign a power, con∣stituting
Mr. Ralph Mattocks his at∣torney
<HI>pro tempore,</HI> for managing the
estate of Miss Aurelia Darnel; and
this was forwarded to the steward by
<PB N="257" REF="260"/>
the hands of Clump, who set out
with it for the seat of Darnel-hill,
though not without a heavy heart,
occasioned by some intimation he had
received, concerning the connexion
between his dear Dolly, and Mr.
Clarke the lawyer.</P>

<P>SIR Launcelot having vindicated
the liberty, confirmed the safety,
and secured the heart of his charming
Aurelia, now found leisure to unravel
the conspiracy which had been exe∣cuted
against his person; and with
that view commenced a law-suit
against the owner of the house where
he and his mistress had been separate∣ly
confined. Mr. Shackle was, not∣withstanding
all the submissions and
atonement which he offered to make,
either in private or in public, indicted
on the statute of kidnapping, tried,
convicted, punished by a severe fine,
<PB N="258" REF="261"/>
and standing in the pillory. A judi∣cial
writ <HI>ad inquirendum</HI> being exe∣cuted,
the prisons of his inquisition
were laid open, and several innocent
captives enlarged.</P>
<P>In the course of Shackle's trial, it
appeared that the knight's confine∣ment
was a scheme executed by his
rival Mr. Sycamore, according to the
device of his counsellor Dawdle, who,
by this contrivance, had reconciled
himself to his patron, after having
deserted him in the day of battle. Our
hero was so incensed at the discovery
of Sycamore's treachery and ingrati∣tude,
that he went in quest of him
immediately, to take vengeance on
his person, accompanied by captain
Crowe, who wanted to ballance ac∣counts
with Mr. Dawdle. But those
gentlemen had wisely avoided the im∣pending
storm, by retiring to the con∣tinent,
on pretence of travelling for
improvement.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot was not now so much
of a knight-errant, as to leave Aure∣lia
to the care of Providence, and pur∣sue
<PB N="259" REF="262"/>
the traitors to the farthest extre∣mities
of the earth. He practised a
much more easy, certain, and effectual
method of revenge, by instituting a
process against them, which, after
writs of <HI>capias, alias, &amp; pluries,</HI> had
been repeated, subjected them both
to outlawry. Mr. Sycamore and his
friend being thus deprived of the be∣nefit
of the law, by their own neglect,
would likewise have forfeited their
goods and chattels to the king, had
not they made such submissions as ap∣peased
the wrath of Sir Launcelot and
captain Crowe; then they ventured
to return, and by dint of interest ob∣tained
a reversal of the outlawry. But
this grace they did not enjoy, till long
after our adventurer was happily esta∣blished
in life.</P>
<P>While the knight waited impatient∣ly
for the expiration of Aurelia's mi∣nority,
and, in the mean time, con∣soled
himself with the imperfect hap∣piness
arising from her conversation,
and those indulgences which the most
unblemished virtue could bestow;
<PB N="260" REF="263"/>
captain Crowe projected another plan
of vengeance against the conjurer,
whose lying oracles had cost him such
a world of vexation. The truth is,
the captain began to be tired of idle∣ness,
and undertook this adventure to
keep his hand in use. He imparted
his design to Crabshaw, who had
likewise suffered in spirit from the
predictions of the said offender, and
was extremely well disposed to assist
in punishing the false prophet. He
now took it for granted that he should
not be hanged for stealing a horse;
and thought it very hard to pay so
much money for a deceitful prophe∣cy,
which, in all likelihood, would
never be fulfilled.</P>
<P>Actuated by these motives, they
set out together for the house of con∣sultation;
but they found it shut up
and abandoned, and, upon inquiry in
the neighbourhood, learned that the
conjurer had moved his quarters that
very day on which the captain had
recourse to his art. This was actual∣ly
the case: he knew the fate of Sir
<PB N="261" REF="264"/>
Launcelot would soon come to light,
and he did not chuse to wait the con∣sequence.
He had other motives for
decamping. He had run a score at
the public-house, which he had no
mind to discharge, and wanted to dis∣engage
himself from his female asso∣ciate,
who knew too much of his af∣fairs,
to be kept at a proper distance.
All these purposes he had answered,
by retreating softly, without beat of
drum, while his Sybil was abroad
running down prey for his devouring.
He had not, however, taken his mea∣sures
so cunningly, but that this old
hag discovered his new lodgings, and,
in revenge, gave information to the
publican. This creditor took out a
writ accordingly; and the bailiff had
just secured his person as Capt. Crowe
and Timothy Crabshaw chanced to
pass by the door in their way home∣wards,
through an obscure street near
the Seven Dials.</P>
<P>The conjurer having no subterfuge
left, but a great many particular rea∣sons
for avoiding an explanation with
<PB N="262" REF="265"/>
the justice, like the man between
the devil and the deep sea, of
two evils chose the least; and beck∣oning
to the captain, called him by
his name. Crowe, thus addressed,
replied with a “Hilloah!” and look∣ing
towards the place from whence he
was hailed, at once recognized the
negromancer. Without farther he∣sitation
he sprang across the street, and
collaring Albumazar, exclaimed, “A∣ha!
old boy; is the wind in that cor∣ner?
—I thought we should grapple
one day—now will I bring you up
by the head, tho' all the devils in hell
were blowing abaft the beam.”</P>
<P>The bailiff seeing his prisoner so
roughly handled before, and at the
same time assaulted behind by Crab∣shaw,
who cried, “Shew me a liar,
and I'll shew you a thief—who is to
be hanged now?”—I say, the bailiff,
fearing he should lose the benefit of
his job, began to put on his conten∣tious
face, and, declaring the doctor
was his prisoner, swore he could not
surrender him without a warrant from
<PB N="263" REF="266"/>
the lord chief justice. The whole
groupe adjourning into the parlour,
the conjurer desired to know of Crowe,
whether Sir Launcelot was found? be∣ing
answered, “Ey, ey, safe enough
to see you made fast in the bilboes,
brother;” he told the captain he had
something of consequence to commu∣nicate
for his advantage; and propo∣sed
that Crowe and Crabshaw should
bail the action, which lay only for a
debt of three pounds.</P>
<P>Crowe stormed, and Crabshaw grin∣ned
at this modest proposal: but when
they understood that they could only
be bound for his appearance, and re∣flected
that they needed not part with
him until his body should be surren∣dered
unto justice, they consented to
give bail; and the bond being exe∣cuted,
conveyed him directly to the
house of our adventurer. The bois∣terous
Crowe introduced him to Sir
Launcelot with such an abrupt un∣connected
detail of his offence, as the
knight could not understand without
Timothy's annotations. These were
<PB N="264" REF="267"/>
followed by some questions put to the
conjurer, who laying aside his black
gown, and plucking off his white
beard, exhibited to the astonished
spectators the very individual counte∣nance
of the empyrical politician Fer∣ret,
who had played our hero such a
slippery trick after the electioneering
adventure.</P>
<P>“I perceive (said he) you are pre∣paring
to expostulate, and upbraid me
for having given a false information
against you to the country justice. I
look upon mankind to be in a state of
nature, a truth which Hobbes hath
stumbled upon by accident: I think
every man has a right to avail himself
of his talents, even at the expence of
his fellow-creatures; just as we see
the fish, and other animals of the crea∣tion
devouring one another.—I found
the justice but one degree removed
from ideotism, and knowing that he
would commit some blunder in the
execution of his office, which would
lay him at your mercy, I contrived to
make his folly the instrument of my
<PB N="265" REF="268"/>
escape—I was dismissed without be∣ing
obliged to sign the information I
had given; and you took ample
vengeance for his tyranny and imper∣tinence.
I came to London, where my
circumstances obliged me to live in
disguise. In the character of a con∣jurer,
I was consulted by your fol∣lower
Crowe, and your 'squire Crab∣shaw.
I did little or nothing but ec∣cho
back the intelligence they brought
me, except prognosticating that Crab∣shaw
would be hanged; a prediction
to which I found myself so irresistibly
impelled, that I am persuaded it was
the real effect of inspiration—I am
now arrested for a paultry sum of mo∣ney,
and, moreover, liable to be sent
to Bridewell as an impostor—let those
answer for my conduct whose cruel∣ty
and insolence have driven me to the
necessity of using such subterfuges—
I have been oppressed and persecuted
by the government for speaking truth
—your omnipotent laws have recon∣ciled
contradictions. That which is
acknowledged to be truth in fact, is
<PB N="266" REF="269"/>
construed falshood in law; and great
reason we have to boast of a constitution
founded on the basis of absurdity—
But, waving these remarks, I own I
am unwilling to be either imprisoned
for debt, or punished for imposture—
I know how far to depend upon ge∣nerosity,
and what is called benevo∣lence;
words to amuse the weak∣minded
—I build upon a surer bottom
—I will bargain for your assistance—
it is in my power to put twelve thou∣sand
pounds in the pocket of Samuel
Crowe, that there sea-ruffian, who by
his good will would hang me to the
yard's arm—”</P>
<P>There he was interrupted by the
seaman. “Damn your rat's eyes!
none of your—hang thee! fish my
topmasts! if the rope was fairly reeved,
and the tackle sound, d'ye see—”
Mr. Clarke, who was present, began
to stare; while the knight assured
Ferret, that if he was really able and
willing to serve captain Crowe in any
thing essential, he should be amply
rewarded. In the mean time, he dis∣charged
<PB N="267" REF="270"/>
the debt, and assigned him an
apartment in his own house. That
same day Crowe, by the advice of
Sir Launcelot and his nephew, en∣tered
into conditional articles with the
Cynic, to allow him the interest of
fifteen hundred pounds for life; pro∣vided,
by his means, the captain should
obtain possession of the estate of Hob∣by-hole
in Yorkshire, which had be∣longed
to his grandfather, and of
which he was heir of blood.</P>
<P>This bond being executed, Mr.
Ferret discovered that he himself was
the lawful husband of Bridget Maple,
aunt to Samuel Crowe, by a clandes∣tine
marriage; which, however, he
convinced them he could prove by un∣deniable
evidence. This being the
case, she, the said Bridget Maple, alias
Ferret, was a <HI>covert femme,</HI> conse∣quently
could not transact any deed of
alienation without his concurrence;
ergo, the docking of the intail
of the estate of Hobby-hole was
illegal and of none effect. This was
a very agreeable declaration to the
<PB N="268" REF="271"/>
whole company, who did not fail to
congratulate captain Crowe on the
prospect of his being restored to his
inheritance. Tom Clarke, in parti∣cular,
protested, with tears in his
eyes, that it gave him unspeakable
joy; and his tears trickled the faster,
when Crowe with an arch look signi∣fied,
that now he was pretty well vic∣tualled
for life, he had some thoughts
of embarking on the voyage of matri∣mony.</P>
<P>But that point of happiness to which,
as the north pole, the course of these
adventures hath been invariably direc∣ted,
was still unattained; we mean,
the indissoluble union of the accom∣plished
Sir Launcelot Greaves and the
enchanting Miss Darnel. Our hero
now discovered in his mistress a thou∣sand
charms, which hitherto he had
no opportunity to contemplate. He
found her beauty excelled by her good
sense, and her virtue superior to both.
He found her untainted by that gid∣diness,
vanity, and affectation, which
distinguish the fashionable females of
<PB N="269" REF="272"/>
the present age. He found her un∣infected
by the rage for diversion and
dissipation; for noise, tumult, gew∣gaws,
glitter, and extravagance. He
found her not only raised by under∣standing
and taste far above the amuse∣ments
of little vulgar minds; but
even exalted by uncommon genius
and refined reflection, so as to relish
the more sublime enjoyments of ra∣tional
pleasure. He found her pos∣sessed
of that vigour of mind which
constitutes true fortitude, and vindi∣cates
the empire of reason. He found
her heart incapable of disguise or dis∣simulation;
frank, generous, and
open; susceptible of the most tender
impressions; glowing with a keen
sense of honour, and melting with
humanity. A youth of his sensibility
could not fail of being deeply affected
by such attractions. The nearer he
approached the center of happiness,
the more did the velocity of his pas∣sion
increase. Her uncle still remain∣ed
insensible, as it were, in the arms
of death. Time seemed to linger in
<PB N="270" REF="273"/>
its lapse, 'till the knight was inflamed
to the most eager degree of impa∣tience.
He communicated his distress
to Aurelia; he pressed, her with the
most pathetic remonstrances to abridge
the torture of his suspence. He in∣terested
Mrs. Kawdle in his behalf;
and, at length, his importunity suc∣ceeded.
The banns of marriage were
regularly published, and the ceremony
was performed in the parish church,
in the presence of Dr. Kawdle and his
lady, captain Crowe, lawyer Clarke,
and Mr. Dolly Cowslip.</P>
<P>The bride, instead of being disgui∣sed
in tawdry stuffs of gold or silver,
and sweating under a harness of dia∣monds,
according to the elegant taste
of the times, appeared in a negligee
of plain blue sattin, without any other
jewels than her eyes, which far out∣shone
all that ever was produced by
the mines of Golconda. Her hair had
no other extraneous ornament than a
small sprig of artificial roses; but the
dignity of her air, the elegance of her
shape, the sweetness and sensibility of
<PB N="271" REF="274"/>
her countenance, added to such
warmth of colouring, and such ex∣quisite
symmetry of features, as could
not be excelled by human nature, at∣tracted
the eyes and excited the ad∣miration
of all the beholders. The
effect they produced in the heart of
Sir Launcelot, was such a rapture as
we cannot pretend to describe. He
made his appearance on this occasion,
in a white coat and blue sattin vest,
both embroidered with silver; and all
who saw him could not but own that
he alone seemed worthy to possess the
lady whom heaven had destined for
his consort. Captain Crowe had taken
off a blue suit of cloaths strongly
guarded with bars of broad gold lace,
in order to honour the nuptials of his
friend: he wore upon his head a bag∣wig
<HI>a la pigeon,</HI> made by an old ac∣quaintance
in Wapping; and to his
side he had girded a huge plate-hilt∣ed
sword, which he had bought of a
recruiting serjeant. Mr. Clarke was
dressed in pompadour, with gold but∣tons,
and his lovely Dolly in a smart
<PB N="272" REF="275"/>
checked lutestring, a present from her
mistress.</P>
<P>The whole company dined, by in∣vitation,
at the house of Dr. Kawdle,
and here it was that the two most de∣serving
lovers on the face of the earth
attained to the consummation of all
earthly felicity. The captain and his
nephew had a hint to retire in due
time. Mrs. Kawdle conducted the
amiable Aurelia, trembling, to the
marriage-bed: our hero glowing with
a bridegroom's ardour, claimed the
husband's privilege: Hymen lighted
up his brightest torch at virtue's lamp,
and every star shed its happiest in∣fluence
on their heaven-directed union.
Instructions had been already dispatch∣ed
to prepare Greavesbury-hall for the
reception of its new mistress; and for
that place the new-married couple set
out next morning, according to the
plan which had been previously con∣certed.
Sir Launcelot and lady
Greaves, accompanied by Mrs. Kaw∣dle,
and attended by Dolly, travelled
in their own coach drawn by six dap∣pled
<PB N="273" REF="276"/>
horses. Dr. Kawdle, with cap∣tain
Crowe, occupied the doctor's post∣chariot,
provided with four bays: Mr.
Clark had the honour to bestride the
loins of Bronzomarte: Mr. Ferret
was mounted upon an old hunter:
Crabshaw stuck close to his friend
Gilbert; and two other horsemen
completed the retinue. There was not
an aching heart in the whole cavalcade,
except that of the young lawyer, which
was by turns invaded with hot desires
and chilling scruples. Though he
was fond of Dolly to distraction, his
regard to worldly reputation, and his
attention to worldly interest, were con∣tinually
raising up bars to a legal gra∣tification
of his love. His pride was
startled at the thought of marrying the
daughter of a poor country publican;
and he moreover dreaded the resent∣ment
of his uncle Crowe, should he
take any step of this nature without
his concurrence. Many a wishful
look did he cast at Dolly, the tears
standing in his eyes; and many a
woeful sigh did he utter.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="277"/>
Lady Greaves immediately per∣ceived
the situation of his heart, and,
by questioning Mrs. Cowslip, disco∣vered
a mutual passion between these
lovers. She consulted her dear knight
on the subject; and he catechised the
lawyer, who pleaded guilty. The cap∣tain
being sounded, as to his opinion,
declared he would be steered in that
as well as every other course of life,
by Sir Launcelot and his lady, whom
he verily revered as beings of an order
superior to the ordinary race of man∣kind.
This favourable response being
obtained from the sailor, our hero
took an opportunity on the road, one
day after dinner, in presence of the
whole company, to accost the lawyer
in these words: “My good friend
Clarke, I have your happiness very
much at heart—your father was an
honest man, to whom my family had
manifold obligations. I have had
these many years a personal regard for
yourself, derived from your own in∣tegrity
of heart and goodness of dis∣position
—I see you are affected, and
<PB N="275" REF="278"/>
shall be brief—Besides this regard, I
am indebted to your friendship for the
liberty—what shall I say?—for the
inestimable happiness I now enjoy, in
possessing the most excellent—But I
understand that significant glance of
my Aurelia—I will not offend her
delicacy—The truth is, my obligation
is very great, and it is time I should
evince my gratitude—If the steward∣ship
of my estate is worth your ac∣ceptance,
you shall have it immediate∣ly,
together with the house and farm
of Cockerton in my neighbourhood.
I know you have a passion for Mrs.
Dolly; and believe she looks upon
you with the eyes of tender preposses∣sion
—don't blush Dolly,—besides
your agreeable person, which all the
world must approve, you can boast of
virtue, fidelity, and friendship. Your
attachment to lady Greaves neither
she or I shall ever forget—if you are
willing to unite your fate with Mr.
Clarke, your mistress gives me leave
to assure you she will stock the farm
at her own expence; and we will ce∣lebrate
<PB N="276" REF="279"/>
the wedding at Greavesbury-hall—”</P>
<P>By this time the hearts of these
grateful lovers had overflowed. Dol∣ly
was sitting on her knees, bathing
her lady's hand with her tears; and
Mr. Clarke appeared in the same atti∣tude
by Sir Launcelot. The uncle, al∣most
as much affected as the nephew,
by the generosity of our adventurer,
cried aloud, “I pray God that you
and your glorious consort may have
smooth seas and gentle gales whither∣soever
you are bound—as for my
kinsman Tom, I'll give him a thou∣sand
pounds, to set him fairly afloat;
and if he prove not a faithful tender
to you his benefactor, I hope he will
founder in this world, and be damned
in that which is to come.” Nothing
now was wanting to the completion
of their happiness, but the consent of
Dolly's mother, at the Black Lyon,
who they did not suppose could have
any objection to such an advantageous
match for her daughter: but in this
particular they were mistaken.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="280"/>
In the mean time, they arrived at
the village where the knight had ex∣ercised
the duties of chivalry; and
there he received the gratulation of
Mr. Fillet, and the attorney who
had offered to bail him before justice
Gobble. Mutual civilities having pas∣sed,
they gave him to uuderstand, that
Gobble and his wife were turned me∣thodists.
All the rest of the prisoners
whom he had delivered came to testi∣fy
their gratitude, and were hospita∣bly
entertained. Next day they halt∣ed
at the Black Lyon, where the good
woman was overjoyed to see Dolly so
happily preferred: but when Sir
Launcelot unfolded the proposed mar∣riage,
she interrupted him with a
scream. “Christ Jesus forbid—mar∣ry
and amen! match with her own
brother!”</P>
<P>At this exclamation Dolly fainted:
her lover stood with his ears erect, and
his mouth wide open; Crowe stared;
while the knight and his lady expres∣sed
equal surprize and concern. When
Sir Launcelot intreated Mrs. Cowslip
<PB N="278" REF="281"/>
to explain this mystery, she told him
that about sixteen years ago, Mr.
Clarke senior had brought Dolly, then
an infant, to her house, when she and
her late husband lived in another part
of the country; and as she had
then been lately delivered of a child
which did not live, he hired her as
nurse to the little foundling. He
owned she was a love-begotten babe,
and from time to time paid handsome∣ly
for the board of Dolly, who he de∣sired
might pass for her own daugh∣ter.
In his last illness, he assured her
he had taken care to provide for the
child; but since his death she had re∣ceived
no account of any such provi∣sion.
She, moreover, informed his
honour, that Mr. Clarke had deposi∣ted
in her hands a diamond ring and
a sealed paper, never to be opened
without his order, until Dolly should
be demanded in marriage by the man
she should like; and not then, except
in presence of the clergyman of the
parish. “Send for the clergyman this
instant, (cried our hero, reddening,
<PB N="279" REF="282"/>
and fixing his eyes on Dolly) I hope
all will yet be well.”</P>
<P>The vicar arriving, and being made
acquainted with the nature of the
case, the landlady produced the pa∣per;
which being opened, appeared
to be an authentic certificate, that the
person, commonly known by the
name of Dorothy Cowslip, was in fact
Dorothea Greaves, daughter of Jona∣than
Greaves, es{que} by a young gentle∣woman
who had been some years de∣ceased.—</P>
<P>“The remaining part of the mys∣tery
I myself can unsold—(exclaimed
the knight, while he ran and em∣braced
the astonished Dolly, as his
kinswoman.) Jonathan Greaves was
my uncle, and died before he came
of age; so that he could make no
settlement on his child, the fruit of a
private amour founded on a promise
of marriage, of which this ring was
a token. Mr. Clarke, being his con∣fident,
disposed of the child, and at
length finding his constitution decay,
revealed the secret to my father, who,
<PB N="280" REF="283"/>
in his will, bequeathed one hundred
pounds a year to this agreeable found∣ling:
but as they both died while I
was abroad, and some of the memo∣randums
touching this transaction pro∣bably
were mislaid, I never till now
could discover where or how my
pretty cousin was situated. I shall
recompence the good woman for her
care and fidelity, and take pleasure
in bringing this affair to a happy is∣sue.”</P>
<P>The lovers were now overwhelm∣ed
with transports of joy and grati∣tude,
and every countenance was
lighted up with satisfaction. From
this place to the habitation of Sir
Launcelot the bells were rung in
every parish, and the corporation in
their formalities congratulated him in
every town through which he passed.
About five miles from Greavesbury-hall
he was met by above five thou∣sand
persons of both sexes and every
age, dressed out in their gayest appa∣rel,
headed by Mr. Ralph Mattox
from Darnel-hill, and the rector from
<PB N="281" REF="284"/>
the knight's own parish. They were
preceded by music of different kinds,
ranged under a great variety of flags
and ensigns; and the women, as well sa
the men, bedizened with fancy-knots
and marriage-favours. At the end of
the avenue, a select bevy of comely
virgins arrayed in white, and a sepa∣rate
band of choice youths, distin∣guished
by garlands of laurel and hol∣ly
interweaved, fell into the proces∣sion,
and sung in chorus a rustic epi∣thalamium
composed by the curate.
At the gate they were received by the
venerable house-keeper Mrs. Oakley,
whose features were so brightened by
the occasion, that with the first glance
she made a conquest of the heart of
captain Crowe; and this connexion
was improved afterwards into a legal
conjunction.</P>
<P>Mean while the houses of Greaves∣bury-hall
and Darnel-hill were set
open for the entertainment of all
comers, and both ecchoed with the
sounds of festivity. After the cere∣mony
of giving and receiving visits
<PB N="282" REF="285"/>
had been performed by Sir Launcelot
Greaves and his lady, Mr. Clarke
was honoured with the hand of the
agreeable Miss Dolly Greaves; and
the captain was put in possession of
his paternal estate. The perfect and
uninterrupted felicity of the knight
and his endearing consort, diffused it∣self
through the whole adjacent coun∣try,
as far as their example and influ∣ence
could extend. They were ad∣mired,
esteemed, and applauded by
every person of taste, sentiment, and
benevolence; at the same time be∣loved,
revered, and almost adored by
the commom people, among whom
they suffered not the merciless hand
of indigence or misery to seize one
single sacrifice.</P>
<P>Ferret, at first, seemed to enjoy his
easy circumstances; but the novelty
of this situation soon wore off, and all
his misanthropy returned. He could
not bear to see his fellow-creatures
happy around him; and signified his
disgust to Sir Launcelot, declaring his
intention of returning to the metropo∣lis,
<PB N="283" REF="286"/>
where he knew there would be
always food sufficient for the ravenous
appetite of his spleen. Before he de∣parted,
the knight made him partake
of his bounty, though he could not
make him taste of his happiness,
which soon received a considerable
addition in the birth of a son, destin∣ed
to be the heir and representative
of two worthy families, whose mu∣tual
animosity the union of his pa∣rents
had so happily extinguished.</P>
