<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE paths of Truth with Fancy's flowers to strow,</L>
<L>To teach improvement from delight to flow,</L>
<L>The bards of old first bade the Comic strain</L>
<L>With mirth instruct, with moral entertain.</L>
<L>No vice or folly that disgrac'd the age</L>
<L>Escap'd the daring Poet's honest rage;</L>
<L>But Satire, uncontroll'd, pursu'd her plan,</L>
<L>Nor stopp'd at general lines, but mark'd the <HI>Man;</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n features, voice, dress, gait, the scene display'd,</L>
<L>And living characters to scorn betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such rude attacks be banish'd in our times,</L>
<L>Be persons sacred, but expos'd their crimes:</L>
<L>For <HI>wise,</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>polish'd</HI> as we are,</L>
<L>We still may find some <HI>vices—</HI>here and there.</L>
<L>And if a Modern, in this <HI>prudent</HI> age,</L>
<L>Dares to obtrude a Moral on the Stage,</L>
<L>Critics be mild: tho' unadorn'd our Play,</L>
<L>Nor wisely grave, nor elegantly gay,</L>
<L>How rude soe'er, it shocks not Virtue's eye,</L>
<L>Nor injures the chaste ear of Modesty;</L>
<L>Nor with soft blandishment bids Vice allure,</L>
<L>Nor draws the Good in odious portraiture.</L>
<L><PB REF="30"/>
Our Son of Folly is of Vice's brood,</L>
<L>And willingly bids evil be his good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is there a wretch that views, without remorse,</L>
<L>The better path, and yet pursues the worse;</L>
<L>Proud of imputed guilt, yet vainly blind,</L>
<L>Call's folly sense; vice, knowledge of mankind;</L>
<L>Dup'd by the knave, he scorns and ridicules,</L>
<L>Rul'd by the <HI>Wanton,</HI> whom he thinks he rules;</L>
<L>This, this is folly: a determin'd fool</L>
<L>Provokes and justifies our ridicule.</L>

<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>MUST I be persecuted by every one in the family? Has your mistress ordered you to be rude to me too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what you mean by rude, not I; so you always call me, when I would advise you for your good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire you will not concern yourself about me, Mrs. Rose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only tell you as a friend, Miss, that if you pro∣voke my mistress, it will be the worse for yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is most astonishing insolence! I wish your ma∣ster were come home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish he were, and we'll see whose story will be believed. I only speak for peace-sake. This house will be too hot for some of us before a week's over, that's for certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean for me, I am above your malice; and so my uncle be disabused, I care not what is my lot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well! If young ladies will be so froptious, let them suffer; but remember I tell you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll hear no more of your impertinence. Begone—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into what vile hands am I fallen! And my uncle, unhappy infatuated man! to give me up to the conduct of this wicked woman.—Yet let me not carry my accusation too far.—He thinks at least she is faithful to <HI>him,</HI> and devoted to his interest; but I <HI>will</HI> undeceive him, let the consequence be what it may.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> Friendly.</STAGE>
<P>—Dear Mrs. Friendly; I thought you had quite de∣serted me; I am very glad to see you.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One would not think so, my dear; when you could be a whole month without coming near me:—And you are never at home neither.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never at home! Bless me, Madam! Why I never—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay; young people love young company: And to be sure diversions, and plays, and balls, and shews, and sights, and such things—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Madam, you are quite mistaken—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I don't blame you, child.—Youth loves pleasure, and if one does n't enjoy it when one's young, why—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that's not the case, Madam—If you'll hear me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you come to be of my age, I can tell you, Miss—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no stopping her. <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> But, dear Ma∣dam, hear what I have to say. I have never stirred out since I saw you last, nor never knew you call'd on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! you surprise me! utterly amaze me! What has been the matter? Have you been sick? I have call'd at the door a dozen times: I am quite in a labyrinth—a wilderness! I can't for my life imagine—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, if you'll allow me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, pray do—By all means I would hear it; though I have very little time to stay with you, and I have a great deal to tell you too, Miss, I can assure you—But one thing at a time; and so what were you going to say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not to trouble you with particulars, I have discovered such irregularities in Mrs. Etherdown's conduct—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A notorious creature I warrant her, though Sir John thinks her a saint—Heaven help the poor man, he is bad enough himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declared I would tell my uncle of her, and from that time I have never spoken to her.—In resentment for this (as she pretends) I have been made a prisoner; but I fear she has some other wicked view; for ever since, <HI>Sharply,</HI> her brother, that audacious fellow, dares to persecute me with his impudent addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sharply! A bold man, or I'm mistaken. There's another of Sir John's favourites;—but it's no business of mine; I never meddle in other peoples affairs; but to be sure it was an unchristian thing, and a barbarous thing, and a very unconscionable thing, in Sir John:—But Sir John has no conscience, that's what I blame him for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, his errors as much deserve pity as his faults do blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To send a young creature, an orphan as I may say, hand over head, to town here, into such a family! Little did his poor sister think when she was dying—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mrs. Friendly,—spare me on that topic. I cannot bear to think of it.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, I beg your pardon! I did not think to draw tears from you; but I'll make you amends for it:—I have such news to tell you!—Who do you think is arrived from Germany?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam!—how could you keep this from me so long?—and now to surprise me so.—You are very good, but indeed you have put me all in a flurry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> put you in a flurry! Lord, child, for what? If I had been abrupt indeed, and said any particular person was come, you might say so;—but so far from that, I intend to make you guess half-a dozen times perhaps before I tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! 'tis easy to guess:—I am interested in too few to be suspended.—Captain Wellford is returned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The very man, as I am alive.—I never was so surprised since the hour I was born.—I was combing my hair at the glass—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>When did he arrive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear—I was combing my hair—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do tell me; how does he look?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you by-and-bye; but I can't stay with you two minutes, for I have a world of business to do before dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll not detain you;—only tell me, if he can devise any means to see me:—You know I dare not admit him here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience, I was going to describe—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not now, my dear good creature; only answer my question, and leave out the rest of your narrative till another time.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I declare and vow now that is so like Mr. Friendly. He can't bear to hear a regular narrative, and when I want to be a little intelligible, with proper explana∣tions and circumstances, and so forth, he always interrupts me.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure Mr. Friendly is a very good man, and a very good husband, and all that, and we have been married now—let me see—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>[So she talks 'tis no matter on what subject.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Two and-twenty—ay, two-and-twenty years;—but no matter for that. What were we saying before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were speaking of Capt. Wellford.—I am sur∣prised he has not writ to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he arrived but this morning, child, and did not know you were in town till he came to my house. He was posting down to the country to see you, till we stop'd him. I vow and swear I think he is grown taller than he was.—Bless me! 'tis almost one o'clock; I must run away, for I have a thousand things to buy.—What do you think I have to buy now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I can't tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll reckon them up to you,—In the first place—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you going to count over the thousand articles on your fingers? For goodness sake, don't lose so much of your time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! I shall be too late as it is; but I was in such a hurry to tell you the news.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder you were admitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One of the servants was just going out,—and in I brush'd, and up I ran, without asking any questions.—Wellford would fain have come with me, only Mr. Friendly hindered him. He said he'd write too. And Mr. Friendly bid me tell you, he'd send the chariot for you this evening, to bring you to my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but the difficulty is to get thither; for it will be impossible to go out without leave, and I cannot bring myself to ask it of such a wretch.—I wish you could con∣trive some means.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="90"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear child, I am the worst in the world at con∣triving; I am not one of those that have words at will, and can make a long Canterbury tale out of nothing, and can contrive, and invent, and say this and that and t'other.—I am quite in a dilemma for my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it goes against me to condescend so far as to ask permission of such a creature; but on this occasion I will get the better of my pride, and desire leave to go to your house. If she refuses me, I must be patient till my uncle comes to town, and then I am determined to quit this house at all events.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When do you expect Sir John? I wonder he is not impatient to see the son that his mistress has brought him since he left town.—I'll lay my life he's as fond of it as if it were born in honest wedlock; a naughty man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he sent me to town, he went on a visit to an old acquaintance of his, where it seems he was seized with a fit of the gout, which has detain'd him so long; but he is now well, and we expect him every day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Drinking, and rioting, and ranting, no doubt. Poor man! he has no shame in him.—Well, I must bid you good-by.—The Captain will be on thorns till he sees me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and therefore I will keep you no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had a great deal more to say, if I could re∣member it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>[I shall never get her away. <STAGE>Aside.]</STAGE> You'll excuse me, my dear Madam, but I have letters to write into the country, by a person who waits for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! to be sure, you have your correspondents, child; why not?—Well, I wont interrupt you;—and I am so hurried, I have not had time to say a word;—and so day, day;—for I must go.—You'll be sure to send word tho', if you can't get leave to come.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! undoubtedly.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A perverse little vixen!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I said to her this morning, what signifies telling Sir John such a silly thing, only to make mischief in the fa∣mily? You know my mistress is a great deal younger than him, and it is a common thing for ladies that live with el∣derly gentlemen to go astray a little now and then, and think no harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Psha—Was that an argument? You should have frightened her by telling her my influence over Sir John, and that she had best not provoke me to revenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so I did at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And what did the unlucky prying hussy say to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say! why she said she did not care, not she;—that she would not have her uncle deceiv'd, and so she could but see you and your brat (as she called the poor innocent babe) fairly out of the house, she did not care what became of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that brat shall be gall and wormwood to her yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, if it would induce Sir John to marry you, Ma'am, as you think it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And a poor reward enough, Rose, for my three years slavery to his caprice and silly humours:—In short, I am so sick of him, and the continual disguise I am obliged to wear, that if I should once accomplish my point, I should rejoice to part from the beast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it were come to that, for then you could leave him with credit: Lady Woodall, and a separate main∣tenance. Oh that I could see that day!</P>

<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“If you have done so then, what need you trouble your head about consequences, but march off and leave him” to shake his ears?</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“How do you think I have made my money? Why by dipping him over head and ears in debt; appropri∣ating every shilling he gave me for other purposes to my own use.—This, by Sharply's management, has hitherto been kept from his knowledge: but if I were to leave him now, he would not pay sixpence for me, and I should lose the fruits of my industry.”</Q></P>

<P>And how unluckily things have fallen out! I wish Miss Emily had never come into the house, for my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I durst strangle her.—I have kept her hitherto from tatling to her croney Mrs. Friendly; but some∣thing must now be done to hinder her from blabbing to Sir John: Can you think of nothing? I never saw you so stupid in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I have found out something that may turn to account, I think, with good management.</P>

<P>A footman in a smart livery brought it to the door, and enquired for Miss Emily; I suspecting something, was resolved to find her out, and said I was her own maid, and he might give it to me: he still pressed to see her; I told him she could not be seen; but says I, looking very slily, don't you think now, I know who you came from?—Oh, Oh, cries he winking, then I suppose you expect a fee for delivering this? I laughed and twitch'd it from him, and away he went, mightily pleas'd with his own archness</P>

<P>A visit to Mrs. Friendly! yes, yes, we understand your visits; an equivocating little stirt;—this letter, then you see, was a mere work of lover's supererogation, and she may never know that it was sent, for the plan seems to be settled already between her and Madam Clack.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thought your impudence was not to be pa∣rallel'd, but I find your absurdity is even an over-match for it.—An ideot to suppose the girl would <HI>marry</HI> you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul I can't help laughing at your folly, as much as that little rustic's impertinence, in rejecting my <HI>honourable</HI> addresses.—How she did rant, and pout, and swell, when I proposed marriage! I thought I should have split my sides.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you sot! to throw away your time upon such an idle project.—Did I ever propose any thing but your getting her for a mistress, puppy? that I might have her as much in my power, as I am now in hers.—Was not that the plan I laid down for you, and told you how to behave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have really taken me for a puppet all this while, that was to be moved by your pretty finger and thumb!—A reasonable expectation to be sure! and because I have hitherto been your instrument to cheat that fool Sir John, you modestly suppose I am to have no will of my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how dare you talk thus to me? <HI>You</HI> a will! that owe the cloaths on your back, nay the very bread you eat to my bounty.—Do you remember the figure you cut when I took you up first?</P>

<P>And have not I dress'd you out like a gentle∣man, and taken you into the house, and have not you the credit of passing for my brother?</P>

<P>Dear Ma'am, you flatter.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mrs. Etherdown, you quite overwhelm me!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The most impudent rogue!</P>

<P>Nay, prithee now, don't make one blush!—such <HI>extravagant</HI> praise!—and to a friend too, fy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! you pique yourself on it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with reason too—'Twas the former of those good qualities first procured me the honour of your lady∣ship's acquaintance—the other recommended me to Sir John: since which it has been my business to flatter him, lie to him, applaud his nonsense, act the ninny to his face, and laugh at him behind his back:—so much for my ro∣guery.—And for my impudence, besides the use afore∣said, 'tis by that I keep you in awe in spite of your insolence, and by that I expected to get Emily for a wife in spite of her pride. But it was not worth while to squander such a pre∣cious talent on an intrigue; an heiress was my object, not an amour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are a rare projector, to be sure; your impu∣dence has defeated your own purpose, and undone my hopes. What had you to recommend you as a <HI>husband</HI> to such a proud minx:—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“I am rather tolerable, you are of opinion?”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Duce take you, you have fool'd away your time to no purpose.—Things are now come to an extre∣mity: Sir John will certainly be at home to-morrow, per∣haps to night; and if Emily's mouth is not stopp'd, I am undone.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sharply, sure you can't be so cruel as to leave me thus, standing upon the very brink of ruin. If that vixen cou'd be got out of the way for one week, nay but for two or three days, I shall, by that time, be above the reach of her little spiteful tongue.</P>

<P>Suppose I were to convince you that you hazard nothing in running away with her, have you address and courage enough to undertake the business?</P>

<P>Courage, you know, is not amongst the accom∣plishments I value myself <HI>chiefly</HI> upon.</P>

<P>This to me now, Barbara, to me, that knows you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have been his wife above a twelvemonth; why don't you think him sot enough to be drawn in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.—Yet I am slow, wonderfully slow of faith in this article.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I took him in a fond hour, and pretending scruples of conscience, declared I would live with him no longer, if he did not marry me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he took you at your word?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sooner than part with me he at last consented; but so contrived it, that to have the <HI>credit,</HI> as he called it, of passing for a keeper, rather than a husband, 'tis impossible for me to prove our marriage; for I knew neither the parson nor the witness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be so,—pray what difference is there be∣tween your being his wife or his mistress,<HI>—Conscience</HI> out of the question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear,—he promis'd if I brought him an heir, of which I gave him hopes before he left town, that he wou'd own me for his wife; for the fool is not really so bad as he wou'd fain be thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph.—Well and you <HI>have</HI> brought him one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore I expect he will acknowledge our marriage as soon as he comes home, provided he has not tales told him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he should; by my soul! he'd rather bas∣tardize his whole generation, than bear to be laughed at for a cuckold; especially by Friendly, with whom he would fain pass for a man of great sagacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You see therefore the present necessity of getting Emily out of the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get her out of the way then as fast as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Tol, lol, lol.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Open your plan of operations.—Now you talk rea∣son, I'll vouchsafe you a hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thus it is then, Emily has desired to go this evening to Mr. Friendly's, on pretence of a visit, but in reality to meet a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lover! some country booby I suppose, that has scampered after her from Hertfordshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Most likely.—Friendly's chariot is to call for her at five o'clock; it will be then too dark to distinguish the difference, and there will be no difficulty in putting her into another chariot, and as she does n't know the streets, con∣ducting her to another house, where you may be ready to receive her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thing is not absolutely impracticable:—But what am I to get for undertaking this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have you thought of any place to which you can convey her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not stir an inch under two hundred pound, one of which I will be paid before-hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have no more conscience in you—But you shall have it.—Whither do you mean to carry her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Private, our old acquaintance, has generally a spare room, where I sometimes meditate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The best place in the world.—Don't you ap∣pear till she is in the house; then give her into safe custody, return home, and leave it to me to charge her elopement on this lover, with the connivance of Friendly's family, which will exasperate Sir John against them, and hasten the ac∣knowlegement I want him to make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I begin to relish the scheme; for besides the profit, it will gratify my revenge on that little coy puss, for refusing me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True; for when you have her there, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No farther instructions, dear Madam: I fancy I may be able to proceed without your help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One word more, Sharply, and then I've done. I think in a few days my fool and I must separate; for this is but a temporary expedient, and all must soon come to light.—The creditors too grow pressing; but before the storm comes, don't you think something might be done for me, by way of settlement?</P>

<P>Oh! Mrs. Friendly is one of your virtuous women; but I'd have her know, I can make you as virtuous as herself when I please.—'Tis but owning you for Lady Woodall, and let me see who'll dispute your virtue.</P>

<P>Ay, my dear Sir John, you remember your promise, and my character now, you know—</P>

<P>Well, well, the thing shall be own'd some time or other; but I can't bear the thoughts of that dogmatical fellow Friendly's grinning at me; and then the curs'd im∣pertinence of his wife too, who is always meddling in other

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir John, but they have more reasons than one for hating me. You must know Miss Emily is mighty great at their house of late; and to tell you the truth, I be∣lieve she is carrying on an intrigue there.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Eth.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir John, Mr. Friendly's people have other designs; pretty friends they are indeed, to profess such a re∣gard for you, and spirit your niece up to rebellion, and then entice her away; just when you were expected home too, to marry her, I'll lay my life, to their beggarly relation; but they think they can laugh you out of your resentment.</P>

<P>Well, I'll allow you it is a little mal-a-propos. I am glad, however, that he <HI>is</HI> come; and if we can but obtain his consent to your marrying Emily—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>Emily has not answered my letter neither! Not to afford me a line! nothing but a cold excuse by word of mouth; it's very strange.</P>

<P>Poh! there's nothing strange in it; but you lovers are such restless beings!</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh! my poor wife! that tongue of her's can never lie still. 'Tis her only fault; but I never expect to cure her of it, as she fancies herself the most silent woman in Eng∣land.—She has told you, I suppose, of Sharply's addresses.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; but that I can now convince all the world, I love you for your own sake only. You, I hope, wanted no such proof of the sincerity of my affection. Oh! Friendly! I have offended, too justly provoked my Emily's resentment! persuade her to forgive my fault, and let me call her mine.—</P>

<P>Lose her! I'd lose my life as soon. Dear Friendly, if you wou'd preserve <HI>that,</HI> do you and your wife use all your influence on her. That pride too, which would de∣form another woman, makes her still more beautiful.—What is fortune in comparison with such a mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all that's good, Friendly, I despise it; let me but possess my Emily, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll live in a cottage on love—determined like a true Arcadian swain; but it won't do in this part of the world, let me tell you, boy. But to be serious; what Sharply has told me, he has no other authority for, than Mrs. Etherdown's own word; though he adds, that Sir John, on account of this child's birth, means directly to own his marriage. However, I'll suspend my belief till I am better inform'd.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you let Sharply escape? I had forgot to inquire after him.</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh! I have made him my own. I got him to draw up in writing a full account of Mrs. Etherdown's scheme con∣certed with him against Emily; together with some other curious anecdotes, to which Rose and he are privy: Which notable confession I have made them both sign.</P>
</SP>

<P>Thou art a poor shallow-pated gipsey; very unsit to share the counsels of the wise; but for once I'll inform you. I meant first to be well paid for my trouble, then to discover the whole secret (that trifling circumstance excepted) to Friendly, and fairly to deliver Emily into his hands, ma∣king a merit of my own great in tegrity;—and lastly, I meant (that I own I did) to rumple the young baggage a little, partly out of spite, and to shew my power, which would have enhanced the worth of her deliverance.</P>

<P>Sir John, now mind what I say. You know, I am very apt to give a little good advice now and then, and
<PB N="43" REF="470"/>
tho' you rail at me so, I can't for the blood of me keep it.—Now, I wou'd not have settled sixpence on her, were I you, for all she's my sister. I'd know how to manage a wife, I warrant: I am sharp enough in some things. She's as proud as Lucifer, tho' she's <HI>my</HI> sister.</P>

<P>That's a lie;—if she has any thing good, 'tis her humility and meekness, buzzard!</P>

<P>By my soul, I'll break your head, if you begin to advise, Sharply.</P>

<P>You are ever so when you are drunk, you dog; tho' you can't speak a sentence of common sense when you are sober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then 'tis my duty never to be sober; for I find myself at this minute as wise as any oracle that ever was born, and therefore my advice is <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con—</HI>No settlement.—Mark what the oracle says.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do, I do; and to shew what prodigious influ∣ence your sage counsel has on me, I intend—</P>

<P>Tho' I never <HI>thought</HI> of doing it before, I shall settle a hundred a-year upon her, for all she's your sister.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, after all my arguments against it! By this hand of mine then, I'll have nothing to say to it. Mr. Friendly wou'd no more do such a thing than he'd eat fire. Sir John, I say thirty pounds a-year; observe me now; and that only during pleasure, do you mind?</P>

<P>'Tis even as Sir John said; he is actually married. I have found out the person who was present.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="500"/>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet;—but I purpose presently going to take my leave of her; for I am determined to set out this night in order to join my regiment;—and if nothing happens to change my fortune, why then—</P>

<P>Heaven forbid! you have more grace than to do so, I hope.</P>

</SP>

<P>I declare and protest I am so grieved for you I am ready to cry perfectly;—but who knows what may hap∣pen? Emily may still change her mind.</P>

<P>Oh! I have not the least expectation of that; one thing however let me request of you both before I go.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, Wellford? you know you may command us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you will take Emily under your protection. To what must she be exposed in such a world as this? young and beautiful as she is—an orphan—without fortune—Let me not have the grief to add, without friends too.</P>

<P>You need not doubt my tenderness for her.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon for thus distressing you.—We'll talk no more on the subject; the few hours I have to stay ought not to be spent in fruitless vexation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>A few hours sometimes produces strange revolutions, especially in a woman's mind—Emily's may alter.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll not oppose you, only beg for the pre∣sent you'll clear up your brow a little. I have a mind to have some mirth with Sir John this morning, which shall however only be a prelude to a more serious scene. I shall go to him presently, and pretending not to believe a syllable in regard to his marriage, I will, by way of prevention, lay open all Mrs. Etherdown's conduct.</P>

<P>Stop, stop, stop; 's death! I have raised a wasp's nest about my own ears—What do you think your∣self, Sharply?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, that having many sins to repent of, Sir John, I'll throw my vows to Mrs. Rose in amongst the rest; but will not impose such a pennance on myself as to fulfil them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Sharply. Egad he's no fool after all. Rose, you see the banns are forbid on all sides. No more matrimony, as you love me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; no wedding, Rose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, it would spoil both their fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir John, if you weigh the good against the bad, you will find that you are arrived at a happy period of your life; for you have, within these four-and-twenty hours, acquired a piece of knowledge that you were ignorant of all your days before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have paid devilish dear for my knowledge tho', Friendly, and have learnt nothing by it, but that there is no truth in man or woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me, Sir John; the knowledge I mean is that of knowing yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir John, know yourself, as Mr. Friendly says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Sir John, I give you joy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Of what, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you have recovered your senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'd rather recover my money tho', by the mass!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John, as you have lost nothing, but a little money and a bad wife, and this affair has ended so well, I assure you it will give me great satisfaction to relate it in the most particular and circumstantial manner to every body in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Friendly, put a padlock on your wife's mouth, and then I shall be glad of her company and yours to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="720"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so I am neither to eat nor speak; I thank you for your invitation, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll attend you, and celebrate Wellford's union and your separation together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed.—And to anticipate all Mrs. Friendly can say of me for the remainder of her life, I will here ac∣knowledge that I have been a fot, a fool, a dupe, a most egregious ass; that my wife was an artful wicked strumpet; that Sharply was an hypocritical rascal; Rose a cozening bag∣gage; poor Emily an injured innocence; the Captain there a gencrous lover; Friendly a zealous honest fellow; his wife a discerning and prudent matron; and for myself, that, after passing through the fiery trial, I am come out (it is to be hoped) a discreet and sober gentleman—Now, Madam, have you any thing more to add? I'll lay you fifty pounds, Friendly, she has not another word to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Well.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take up his bett, Friendly, and I'll go your halves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Done, Sir John!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John! I thought after all the money you had squander'd away, and all you were cheated of, and all the debts you have to pay, and all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my dear; go on—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>S'death! Friendly, let me off for half my bett.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Fr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Sir John, I have not half done.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Lays his hand on her mouth.]</STAGE>
<P>Peace, peace, my dear! let us devote this day to mirth; and that Sir John may not be out of humour at his own lot, let him reflect how many are in the same predicament with himself, without ever find∣ing it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Friendly; but I hope I may at least serve as a warning to my brethren.</P>
<L>Taught by example better than by rules,</L>
<L>One dupe expos'd may save an hundred fools.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, By a FRIEND. Spoken by Mrs. CLIVE.</HEAD>
<L>LAdies—methinks I hear you all complain,</L>
<L>Lord! here's the talking creature come again!</L>
<L>The men seem frighted—for 'tis on record</L>
<L>A prating female <HI>will</HI> have the last word.</L>
<L>But you're all out; for sure as you're alive,</L>
<L>Not Mrs. <HI>Friendly</HI> now, I'm Mrs. <HI>Clive;</HI></L>
<L>No character from fiction will I borrow,</L>
<L>But if you please, I'll talk again to-morrow.</L>
<L>Then you conclude, from custom long in vogue,</L>
<L>That I come here to speak an Epilogue,</L>
<L>With satyr, humour, spirit, quite refin'd,</L>
<L>Double-entendre too, with wit combin'd,</L>
<L>Not for the ladies—but to please the men</L>
<L>All this you guess—and now you're out again;</L>
<L>For to be brief, our author bid me say</L>
<L>She tried, but cou'd n't get one to her play.</L>
<L>No Epilogue! why, Ma'am, you'll spoil your treat,</L>
<L>An Epilogue's the cordial after meat;</L>
<L>For when the feast is done, without all question,</L>
<L>They'll want liquors to help them to digestion;</L>
<L>And critics, when they find the banquet light,</L>
<L>Will come next time with better appetite;</L>
<L>So beg your friends to write—for faith 'tis hard,</L>
<L>If 'mongst them all you cannot find <HI>one</HI> bard.</L>
<L>She took the hint—Will <HI>you,</HI> good Sir? or <HI>you,</HI> Sir?</L>
<L>A sister scribbler! sure you <HI>can't</HI> refuse her!</L>
<L><PB REF="740"/>
Some lawyers try'd—not one cou'd make an end on't,</L>
<L>They'd now <HI>such</HI> work with plaintiff and defendant.</L>
<L>A poet tried, but he alleged for reason,</L>
<L>The Muses were so busy at this season,</L>
<L>In penning libels, politics and satyrs,</L>
<L>They had not leisure for such trifling matters.</L>
<L>What's to be done, she cry'd? can't <HI>you</HI> endeavour</L>
<L>To say some pretty thing?—I know you're clever.</L>
<L>I promis'd—but unable to succeed,</L>
<L>Beg you'll accept the purpose for the deed;</L>
<L>Tho' after three long hours in play-house coop'd,</L>
<L>I fear you'll say you've all been finely dup'd.</L>
