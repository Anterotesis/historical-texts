<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. POPE to Dr. SWIFT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 18, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHATEVER Apologies it might become me to make at any other time for writing to you, I shall use none now, to a man who has own'd himself as splenetic as a Cat in the Country. In that circumstance, I know by experience a letter is a very useful, as well as amusing thing: If you are too busied in State affairs to read it, yet you may find entertainment in folding it into divers figures, either doubling it into a pyrami∣dical, or twisting it into a serpentine form:
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
or, if your disposition should not be so mathe∣matical, in taking it with you to that place where men of studious minds are apt to sit longer than ordinary; where, after an abrupt division of the paper, it may not be unpleasant to try to fit and rejoin the broken lines toge∣ther. All these amusements I am no stranger to in the Country, and doubt not but (by this time) you begin to relish them, in your pre∣sent contemplative situation.</P>
<P>I remember a man, who was thought to have some knowledge in the world, used to affirm, that no people in town ever complain∣ed they were forgotten by their Friends in the country: but my encreasing experience con∣vinces me he was mistaken, for I find a great many here grievously complaining of you, up∣on this score. I am told further, that you treat the few you correspond with in a very ar∣rogant style, and tell them you admire at their insolence in disturbing your meditations, or even enquiring of your<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Some time before the Death of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> when her Ministers were quarrel∣ling, and the Dean could not reconcile them, he retired to a Friend's House in Berk∣shire, and never saw them after. S.</NOTE> retreat: but this I will not positively assert, because I never re∣ceived any such insulting Epistle from you. My Lord Oxford says you have not written
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>
to him once since you went: but this perhaps may be only policy, in him or you: and I, who am half a Whig, must not entirely credit any thing he affirms. At Button's it is reported you are gone to Hanover, and that Gay goes only on an Embassy to you. Others apprehend some dangerous State treatise from your re∣tirement; and a Wit, who affects to imitate Balsac, says, that the Ministry now are like those Heathens of old, who received their Oracles from the Woods. The Gentlemen of the Ro∣man Catholic persuasion are not unwilling to credit me, when I whisper, that you are gone to meet some Jesuits commissioned from the Court of Rome, in order to settle the most con∣venient methods to be taken for the coming of the Pretender. Dr. Arbuthnot is singular in his opinion, and imagines your only design is to attend at full leisure to the life and adven∣tures of Scriblerus <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This project (in which the principal persons engaged were Dr. Arbuthnot, Dr. Swift, and Mr. Pope) was a very noble one. It was to write a complete satire in prose upon the abuses in eve∣ry branch of science, com∣prised in the history of the life and writings of Scrible∣rus; of which only some de∣tached parts and fragments were done, such as the <HI>Me∣moirs of Scriblerus,</HI> the <HI>Tra∣vels of Gulliver,</HI> the <HI>Treatise of the Profund,</HI> the literal <HI>Criticisms on Virgil,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. This indeed must be granted of greater importance than all the rest;
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>
and I wish I could promise so well of you. The top of my own ambition is to contribute to that great work, and I shall translate Homer by the by. Mr. Gay has acquainted you what progress I have made in it. I can't name Mr. Gay, without all the acknowledgments which I shall ever owe you, on his account. If I writ this in verse, I would tell you, you are like the sun, and while men imagine you to be retir'd or absent, are hourly exerting your in∣dulgence, and bringing things to maturity for their advantage. Of all the world, you are the man (without flattery) who serve your friends with the least ostentation; it is almost ingratitude to thank you, considering your tem∣per; and this is the period of all my letter which I fear you will think the most impertinent. I am with the truest affection,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Dr. SWIFT to Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>June 28, 1715.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>St. George Ash,</HI> for∣merly a Fellow of <HI>Trinity-College, Dublin,</HI> (to whom the Dean was a Pupil) after∣wards Bishop of Clogher, and translated to the See of Derry in 1716-17. <BIBL>S.</BIBL></NOTE> Lord Bishop of Clogher gave me your kind letter full of reproaches for my not writing. I am naturally no very exact correspondent, and when I leave a country without probability of returning, I think as seldom as I can of what I loved or esteemed in it, to avoid the <HI>Desiderium</HI> which of all things makes life most uneasy. But you must give me leave to add one thing, that you talk at your ease, being wholly unconcerned in public events: For, if your friends the Whigs continue, you may hope for some favour; if the Tories re∣turn, you are at least sure of quiet. You know how well I loved both Lord Oxford and Bo∣lingbroke, and how dear the Duke of Ormond is to me: Do you imagine I can be easy while their enemies are endeavouring to take off their heads? <HI>I nunc, &amp; versus tecum meditare canoros</HI>—Do you imagine I can be easy, when I think of the probable consequences of these proceed∣ings,
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>
perhaps upon the very peace of the nation, but certainly of the minds of so many hundred thousand good subjects? Upon the whole, you may truly attribute my silence to the Eclipse, but it was that Eclipse which happened on the first of August.</P>
<P>I borrowed your Homer from the Bishop (mine is not yet landed) and read it out in two evenings. If it pleaseth others as well as me, you have got your end in profit and reputation: Yet I am angry at some bad Rhymes and Triplets, and pray in your next do not let me have so many unjustifiable Rhymes to <HI>war</HI> and <HI>gods.</HI> I tell you all the faults I know, only in one or two places you are a little obscure; but I expected you to be so in one or two and twenty. I have heard no soul talk of it here, for indeed it is not come over; nor do we very much abound in Judges, at least I have not the honour to be acquainted with them. Your Notes are perfectly good, and so are your Preface and Essay. You were pretty bold in mentioning Lord Bolingbroke in that Pre∣face. I saw the Key to the Lock but yester∣day: I think you have changed it a good deal, to adapt it to the present times <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Put these two last ob∣servations together, and it will appear, that Mr. Pope was neither wanting to his friends for fear of party, nor would insult a ministry to humour his friends.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="25"/>
God be thanked I have yet no Parliamen∣tary business, and if they have none with me, I shall never seek their acquaintance. I have not been very fond of them for some years past, not when I thought them tolerably good, and therefore if I can get leave to be absent, I shall be much inclined to be on that side, when there is a Parliament on this: but truly I must be a little easy in my mind before I can think of Scriblerus.</P>
<P>You are to understand that I live in the cor∣ner of a vast unfurnish'd house; my family consists of a steward, a groom, a helper in the stable, a footman, and an old maid, who are all at board-wages, and when I do not dine abroad, or make an entertainment (which last is very rare) I eat a mutton pye, and drink half a pint of wine: My amusements are defending my small dominions against the Archbishop, and endeavouring to reduce my rebellious Choir. <HI>Perditur haec inter misero lux.</HI> I desire you will present my humble service to Mr. Addison, Mr. Congreve, and Mr. Rowe, and Gay. I am, and will be always, extremely yours, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 20, 1716.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot suffer a friend to cross the Irish seas without bearing a testimony from me of the constant esteem and affection I am both ob∣liged and inclined to have for you. It is bet∣ter he should tell you than I, how often you are in our thoughts and in our cups, and how I learn to sleap less<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Alluding to his constant custom of sleeping after dinner.</NOTE> and drink more, whenever you are named among us. I look upon a friend in Ireland as upon a friend in the other world, whom (popishly-speaking) I believe constantly well-disposed towards me, and ready to do me all the good he can, in that state of separation, though I hear nothing from him, and make ad∣dresses to him but very rarely. A protestant divine cannot take it amiss that I treat him in the same manner with my patron Saint.</P>
<P>I can tell you no news, but what you will not sufficiently wonder at, that I suffer many things as an author militant: whereof, in your days of probation, you have been a sharer, or you had not arrived to that triumphant state
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>
you now deservedly enjoy in the Church. As for me, I have not the least hopes of the Car∣dinalat, tho' I suffer for my Religion in almost every weekly paper. I have begun to take a pique at the Psalms of David (if the wicked may be credited, who have printed a scandalous one<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In Curl's Collection.</NOTE> in my name.) This report I dare not dis∣courage too much, in a prospect I have at pre∣sent of a post under the Marquis de Langal∣lerie <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">One who made a noise then, as Count Bonnival has done since.</NOTE>, wherein if I can but do some signal ser∣vice against the Pope, I may be considerably advanced by the Turks, the only religious peo∣ple I dare confide in. If it should happen here∣after that I should write for the holy law of Ma∣homet, I hope it may make no breach between you and me; every one must live, and I beg you will not be the man to manage the contro∣versy against me. The Church of Rome I judge (from many modern symptoms, as well as an∣cient prophecies) to be in a declining condi∣tion; that of England will in a short time be scarce able to maintain her own family: so Churches sink as generally as Banks in Europe, and for the same reason; that Religion and Trade, which at first were open and free, have
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>
been reduced into the Management of Com∣panies, and the Roguery of Directors.</P>
<P>I don't know why I tell you all this, but that I always loved to talk to you; but this is not a time for any man to talk to the pur∣pose. Truth is a kind of contraband commo∣dity, which I would not venture to export, and therefore the only thing tending that dangerous way which I shall say, is, that I am, and al∣ways will be, with the utmost sincerity,</P>

<P>I Had the favour of yours by Mr. F. of whom, before any other question relating to your health or fortune, or success as a Poet, I en∣quired your principles in the common form, "Is he Whig or a Tory?" I am sorry to find they are not so well tallied to the present jun∣cture as I could wish. I always thought the terms of <HI>Facto</HI> and <HI>Jure</HI> had been introduced by the Poets, and that Possession of any sort in
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>
Kings was held an unexceptionable title in the courts of Parnassus. If you do not grow a per∣fect good subject in all its present latitudes, I shall conclude you are become rich, and able to live without dedications to men in power, whereby one great inconvenience will follow, that you and the world and posterity will be ut∣terly ignorant of their Virtues. For, either your brethren have miserably deceived us these hun∣dred years past, or Power confers Virtue, as naturally as five of your Popish sacraments do Grace.—You sleep less and drink more.—But your master Horace was <HI>Vini somnique benig∣nus:</HI> and, as I take it, both are proper for your trade. As to mine, there are a thousand poe∣tical texts to confirm the one; and as to the other, I know it was anciently the custom to sleep in Temples for those who would consult the Oracles, "Who dictates to me slumbring <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>," &amp;c.</P>
<P>You are an ill Catholick, or a worse Geo∣grapher, for I can assure you, Ireland is not Pa∣radise, and I appeal even to any Spanish divine whether Addresses were ever made to a friend in Hell, or Purgatory? And who are all these enemies you hint at? I can only think of Curl, Gildon, Squire Burnet, Blackmore, and a few
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>
others whose same I have forgot; Tools, in my opinion as necessary for a good writer, as pen, ink, and paper. And besides, I would fain know whether every Draper doth not shew you three or four damn'd pieces of stuff to set off his good one? However, I will grant, that one tho∣rough Bookselling-Rogue is better qualified to vex an author, than all his cotemporary scrib∣lers in Critic or Satire, not only by stolen Co∣pies of what was incorrect or unfit for the pub∣lic, but by downright laying other mens dul∣ness at your door. I had a long design upon the Ears of that Curl, when I was in credit, but the Rogue would never allow me a fair stroke at them, although my penknife was ready drawn and sharp. I can hardly believe the re∣lation of his being poisoned, although the Hi∣storian pretends to have been an eye-witness: But I beg pardon, Sack might do it, although Rats-bane would not. I never saw the thing you mention as falsely imputed to you; but I think the frolicks of merry hours, even when we are guilty, should not be left to the mercy of our best friends, until Curl and his resem∣blers are hang'd.</P>
<P>With submission to the better judgment of you and your friends, I take your project of an employment under the Turks to be idle and unnecessary. Have a little patience, and you
<PB N="15" REF="31"/>
will find more merit and encouragement at home by the same methods. You are ungrate∣ful to your country; quit but your own Religion, and ridicule ours, and that will allow you a free choice for any other, or for none at all, and pay you well into the bargain. Therefore pray do not run and disgrace us among the Turks, by telling them you were forced to leave your native home, because we would oblige you to be a Christian; whereas we will make it appear to all the world, that we only compelled you to be a Whig.</P>
<P>There is a young ingenious Quaker in this town who writes verses to his mistress, not very correct, but in a strain purely what a poetical Quaker should do, commending her look and ha∣bit, &amp;c. It gave me a hint that a sett of Qua∣ker pastorals might succeed, if our friend Gay<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gay did write a pastoral of this kind, which is pub∣lished in his works.</NOTE> could fancy it, and I think it a fruitful subject; pray hear what he says. I believe further, the pastoral ridicule is not exhausted; and that a porter, footman,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Swift himself wrote one of this kind, intitled <HI>Dermot and Sheelah.</HI></NOTE> or chairman's pastoral might do well. Or what think you of a Newgate∣pastoral, among the whores and thieves there.</P>
<P>Lastly, to conclude, I love you never the worse for seldom writing to you. I am in an
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
obscure scene, where you know neither thing nor person. I can only answer yours, which I promise to do after a sort whenever you think fit to employ me. But I can assure you, the scene and the times have depressed me wonder∣fully, for I will impute no defect to those two paltry years which have slipt by since I had the happiness to see you.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>Jan. 10, 1721.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A Thousand things have vexed me of late years, upon which I am determined to lay open my mind to you. I rather chuse to ap∣peal to you than to my Lord Chief Justice Whit∣shed, under the situation I am in. For, I take this cause properly to lie before you: You are a much fitter Judge of what concerns the cre∣dit of a Writer, the injuries that are done him, and the reparations he ought to receive. Be∣sides, I doubt whether the Arguments I could
<PB N="17" REF="33"/>
suggest to prove my own innocence would be of much weight from the gentlemen of the Long-robe to those in Furs, upon whose de∣cision about the difference of Style or Senti∣ments, I should be very unwilling to leave the merits of my Cause.</P>
<P>Give me leave then to put you in mind (al∣though you cannot easily forget it) that about ten weeks before the Queen's death, I left the town, upon occasion of that incurable breach among the great men at Court, and went down to Berkshire, where you may remember that you gave me the favour of a visit. While I was in that retirement, I writ a Discourse which I thought might be useful in such a juncture of affairs, and sent it up to London; but, upon some difference in opinion between me and a certain great Minister now abroad, the pub∣lishing of it was deferred so long that the Queen died, and I recalled my copy, which hath been ever since in safe hands. In a few weeks after the loss of that excellent Princess, I came to my station here; where I have continued ever since in the greatest privacy, and utter igno∣rance of those events, which are most common∣ly talked of in the world. I neither know the names nor number of the Royal Family which now reigns, further than the Prayer-book in∣forms me. I cannot tell who is Chancellor,
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>
who are Secretaries, nor with what nations we are in peace or war. And this manner of life was not taken up out of any sort of Affectation, but merely to avoid giving offence, and for fear of provoking Party-zeal.</P>
<P>I had indeed written some Memorials of the four last years of the Queen's reign, with some other informations, which I receiv'd, as neces∣sary materials to qualify me for doing something in an employment then designed me <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Historiographer. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>: But, as it was at the disposal of a person, who had not the smallest share of steddiness or sincerity, I disdained to accept it.</P>
<P>These papers, at my few hours of health and leisure, I have been digesting<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">These papers some years after were brought finished by the Dean into England, with an intention to publish them. But a friend, on whose judgment he relied (the same I suppose whom he mentions above, as being a∣broad at the time of writ∣ing this letter) dissuaded him from that design. He told the Dean, there were several facts he knew to be false, and that the whole was so much in the spirit of party-writing, that, though it might have made a sea∣sonable pamphlet in support of their Administration it was a dishonour to just history. The Dean would do nothing against his Friend's judg∣ment, yet it extremely cha∣grined him. And he told a common friend, that since ** did not approve his his∣tory, he would cast it into the fire, tho' it was the best work he had ever written. However it did not undergo this fate, and is said to be yet in being.</NOTE> into order by one sheet at a time, for I dare not venture any fur∣ther, lest the humour of searching and seizing
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>
papers should revive; not that I am in pain of any danger to myself (for they contain nothing of present Times or Persons, upon which I shall never lose a thought while there is a Cat or a Spaniel in the house) but to preserve them from being lost among Messengers and Clerks.</P>
<P>I have written in this kingdom, a<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">A Proposal for the universal Use of Irish Manufactures. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> discourse to persuade the wretched people to wear their own Manufactures instead of those from Eng∣land. This Treatise soon spread very fast, be∣ing agreeable to the sentiments of the whole nation, except of those gentlemen who had em∣ployments, or were Expectants. Upon which a person in great office here immediately took the alarm: he sent in haste for the Chief Jus∣tice, and informed him of a seditious, factious, and virulent Pamphlet, lately published with a de∣sign of setting the two Kingdoms at variance; di∣recting at the same time that the Printer should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of law. The Chief Justice had so quick an understand∣ing, that he resolved, if possible, to out-do his orders. The Grand-Juries of the county and city were practised effectually with to represent the said Pamphlet with all aggravating Epithets, for which they had thanks sent them from Eng∣land, and their Presentments published for seve∣ral weeks in all the news-papers. The Printer
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>
was seized, and forced to give great bail: af∣ter his trial the Jury brought him in Not Guil∣ty, although they had been culled with the utmost industry; the Chief Justice sent them back nine times, and kept them eleven hours, until being perfectly tired out, they were forced to leave the matter to the mercy of the Judge, by what they call a special Verdict. During the trial, the Chief Justice, among other sin∣gularities, laid his hand on his breast, and pro∣tested solemnly that the Author's design was to bring in the Pretender; although there was not a single syllable of Party in the whole Trea∣tise, and although it was known that the most eminent of those who professed his own prin∣ciples, publickly disallowed his proceedings. But the cause being so very odious and impo∣pular, the trial of the Verdict was deferred from one Term to another, until upon the Duke of G—ft-n the Lord Lieutenant's arrival, his Grace, after mature advice, and permission from Eng∣land, was pleased to grant a <HI>noli prosequi.</HI></P>
<P>This is the more remarkable, because it is said that the man is no ill decider in common cases of property, where Party is out of the question; but when that intervenes, with am∣bition at heels to push it forward, it must needs confound any man of little spirit, and low birth, who hath no other endowment than that sort
<PB N="21" REF="37" MS="y"/>
of Knowledge, which, however possessed in the highest degree, can possibly give no one good quality to the mind <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This is a very strange as∣sertion. To suppose that a con∣summate knowledge of the Laws, by which civilized so∣cieties are governed, can <HI>give no one good quality to the mind,</HI> is making Ethics (of which public laws are so considera∣ble a part) a very unprofit∣able study. The best divi∣sion of the sciences is that old one of Plato, into Ethics, Physics, and Logic. The se∣verer Philosophers condemn a total application to the two latter, because they have no tendency to mend the heart; and recommend the first as our principal study, for its efficacy in this important ser∣vice. And sure, if any hu∣man speculations can mend the heart, they must be those which have Man for their ob∣ject, as a reasonable, a so∣cial, and a civil being. And these are all included under <HI>Ethics;</HI> whether you call the science <HI>Morality</HI> or <HI>Law.</HI> And with regard to the Law of England, we must be much prejudiced against it not to allow that what Tully affirms concerning the Law of the twelve tables, may be modestly applied to ours. <Q>“Fremant omnes licet▪ di∣cam quod sentio: biblio∣thecas mehercule omnium Philosophorum unum mihi videtur Pandectarum volu∣men et authoritatis pon∣dere et utilitatis ubertate superare.”</Q> But the best proof of its moral efficacy is the manners of its professors: and these, in every age, hath been such as were the first improved, or the last cor∣rupted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is true, I have been much concerned, for several years past, upon account of the publick as well as for myself, to see how ill a taste for wit and sense prevails in the world, which Po∣litics, and South-sea, and Party, and Opera's, and Masquerades have introduced. For, be∣sides many insipid papers which the malice of
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>
some hath entitled me to, there are many per∣sons appearing to wish me well, and pretend∣ing to be judges of my style and manner, who have yet ascribed some writings to me, of which any man of common sense and literature would be heartily ashamed. I cannot forbear instancing a Treatise called a <HI>Dedication upon Dedications,</HI> which many would have to be mine, although it be as empty, dry, and ser∣vile a composition, as I remember at any time to have read. But above all, there is one Cir∣cumstance which makes it impossible for me to have been Author of a Treatise, wherein there are several pages containing a Panegyric on King George, of whose character and person I am utterly ignorant, nor ever had once the cu∣riosity to enquire into either, living at so great a distance as I do, and having long done with whatever can relate to public matters.</P>
<P>Indeed I have formerly delivered my thoughts very freely, whether I were asked or no; but never affected to be a Councellor, to which I had no manner of call. I was humbled enough to see myself so far out-done by the Earl of Oxford in my own trade as a Scholar, and too good a Courtier not to discover his contempt of those who would be men of importance out of their sphere. Besides, to say the truth, although I have known many great Ministers ready e∣nough
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>
to hear Opinions, yet I have hardly seen one that would ever descend to take Advice; and this pedantry ariseth from a Maxim them∣selves do not believe at the same time they prac∣tise by it, that there is something profound in Politics, which men of plain honest sense can∣not arrive to.</P>
<P>I only wish my endeavours had succeeded better in the great point I had at heart, which was that of reconciling the Ministers to each other. This might have been done, if others, who had more concern and more influence, would have acted their parts; and, if this had succeeded, the public interest both of Church and State would not have been the worse, nor the Protestant Succession endangered.</P>
<P>But, whatever opportunities a constant at∣tendance of four years might have given me for endeavouring to do good offices to particu∣lar persons, I deserve at least to find tolerable quarter from those of the other Party; for many of which I was a constant advocate with the Earl of Oxford, and for this I appeal to his Lordship: He knows how often I pressed him in favour of Mr. Addison, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Row, and Mr. Steel; although I freely confess that his Lordship's kindness to them was alto∣gether owing to his generous notions, and the esteem he had for their wit and parts, of which
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>
I could only pretend to be a remembrance<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. For I can never forget the answer he gave to the late Lord Hallifax, who upon the first change of the Ministry interceded with him to spare Mr. Congreve: It was by repeating these two lines of Virgil,
<Q><L>Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni,</L>
<L>Nec tam aversus equos Tyria Sol jungit ab urbe.</L></Q>
Pursuant to which, he always treated Mr. Con∣greve with the greatest personal civilities, assu∣ring him of his constant favour and protection, and adding that he would study to do some∣thing better for him.</P>
<P>I remember it was in those times a usual subject of raillery towards me among the Mi∣nisters, that I never came to them without a Whig in my sleeve; which I do not say with any view towards making my Court: For, the new Principles<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">He means particularly the principle at that time charged upon them, by their Enemies, of an intention <HI>to proscribe the Tories.</HI></NOTE> fixed to those of that denomi∣nation, I did then, and do now from my heart abhor, detest, and abjure, as wholly degenerate from their predecessors. I have conversed in some freedom with more Ministers of State of all parties than usually happens to men of my level, and, I confess, in their capacity as Mi∣nisters,
<PB N="25" REF="41"/>
I look upon them as a race of people whose acquaintance no man would court, other∣wise than upon the score of Vanity or Ambi∣tion. The first quickly wears off (and is the Vice of low minds, for a man of spirit is too proud to be vain) and the other was not my case. Besides, having never received more than one small favour, I was under no neces∣sity of being a slave to men in power, but chose my friends by their personal merit, without examining how far their notions agreed with the politics then in vogue. I frequently con∣versed with Mr. Addison, and the others I named (except Mr. Steel) during all my Lord Oxford's Ministry, and Mr. Addison's friend∣ship to me continued inviolable, with as much kindness as when we used to meet at my Lord Sommers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lord Sommers had very warmly recommended Dr. Swift to the favour of Lord Wharton when he went the Queen's Lieutenant into Ire∣land, in the year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> or Hallifax, who were leaders of the opposite Party.</P>
<P>I would infer from all this, that it is with great injustice I have these many years been pelted by your Pamphleteers, merely upon ac∣count of some regard which the Queen's last Ministers were pleased to have for me: and yet in my conscience I think I am a partaker in every ill design they had against the Protestant
<PB N="26" REF="42"/>
Succession, or the Liberties and Religion of their Country; and can say with Cicero, <Q>“that I should be proud to be included with them in all their actions <HI>tanquam in equo Trojano.”</HI></Q> But if I have never discovered by my words, writ∣ings, or actions, any Party virulence <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Examiners,</HI> I sup∣pose, were not then published amongst the Dean's works.</NOTE>, or dan∣gerous designs against the present powers; if my friendship and conversation were equally shewn among those who liked or disapproved the proceedings then at Court, and that I was known to be a common Friend of all deserv∣ing persons of the latter sort, when they were in distress; I cannot but think it hard, that I am not suffered to run quietly among the com∣mon herd of people, whose opinions unfortu∣nately differ from those which lead to Favour and Preferment.</P>
<P>I ought to let you know, that the Thing we called a Whig in England is a creature altoge∣ther different from those of the same denomi∣nation here; at least it was so during the reign of her late Majesty. Whether those on your side have changed or no <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">He says before, that they had changed.</NOTE>, it hath not been my business to enquire. I remember my excellent friend Mr. Addison, when he first came over hither Secretary to the Earl of Wharton then
<PB N="27" REF="43"/>
Lord Lieutenant, was extremely offended at the conduct and discourse of the Chief Mana∣gers here: He told me they were a sort of peo∣ple who seemed to think, that the principles of a Whig consisted in nothing else but damning the Church, reviling the Clergy, abetting the Dissenters, and speaking contemptibly of re∣vealed Religion.</P>
<P>I was discoursing some years ago with a cer∣tain Minister about that whiggish or fanatical Genius, so prevalent among the English of this kingdom: his Lordship accounted for it by that number of Cromwell's Soldiers, adven∣turers established here, who were all of the sourest leven, and the meanest birth, and whose posterity are now in possession of their lands and their principles. However, it must be confessed, that of late some people in this country are grown weary of quarrelling, be∣cause interest, the great motive of quarrelling, is at an end; for, it is hardly worth contend∣ing who shall be an Exciseman, a Country-Vicar, a Cryer in the Courts, or an Under-Clerk.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be inclined to think, that a person so ill treated as I have been, must at some time or other have discovered very dan∣gerous opinions in government; in answer to which, I will tell you what my Political prin∣ciples
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>
were in the time of her late glorious Ma∣jesty, which I never contradicted by any action, writing, or discourse.</P>
<P>First, I always declared myself against a Popish Successor to the Crown, whatever Ti∣tle he might have by the proximity of blood: Neither did I ever regard the right line, except upon two accounts: first, as it was established by law; and secondly, as it hath much weight in the opinions of the people. For necessity may abolish any Law, but cannot alter the sentiments of the vulgar; Right of inheritance being perhaps the most popular of all topics: and therefore in great Changes when that is broke, there will remain much heart-burning and discontent among the meaner people; which (under a weak Prince and corrupt Administra∣tion) may have the worst consequences upon the peace of any state.</P>
<P>As to what is called a Revolution-principle, my opinion was this; That whenever those evils, which usually attend and follow a violent change of Government, were not in probabi∣lity so pernicious as the grievance we suffer un∣der a present power, then the public good will justify such a Revolution. And this I took to have been the case in the Prince of Orange's expedition, although in the consequences it pro∣duced
<PB N="29" REF="45"/>
some very bad effects, which are likely to stick long enough by us.</P>
<P>I had likewise in those days a mortal antipa∣thy against Standing Armies in times of Peace: Because I always took Standing Armies to be only servants hired by the Master of the family for keeping his own children in slavery; and because I conceived, that a Prince, who could not think himself secure without Mercenary Troops, must needs have a separate interest from that of his Subjects. Although I am not ignorant of those artificial Necessities which a corrupted Ministry can create, for keeping up Forces to support a Faction against the publick Interest.</P>
<P>As to Parliaments, I adored the wisdom of that Gothic Institution, which made them an∣nual: and I was confident our Liberty could never be placed upon a firm foundation until that ancient law were restored among us. For, who sees not, that, while such Assemblies are permitted to have a longer duration, there grows up a commerce of corruption between the Mi∣nistry and the Deputies, wherein they both find their accounts, to the manifest danger of Liber∣ty? which Traffic would neither answer the design nor expence, if Parliaments met once a year.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="46" MS="y"/>
I ever abominated that scheme of Politics, (now about thirty years old) of setting up a monied Interest in opposition to the landed. For I conceived, there could not be a truer maxim in our Government than this, That the Possessors of the soil are the best Judges of what is for the advantage of the kingdom. If others had thought the same way, Funds of Credit and South-sea Projects would neither have been felt nor heard of.</P>
<P>I could never discover the necessity of sus∣pending any Law upon which the Liberty of the most innocent persons depended; neither do I think this Practice hath made the taste of Arbitrary Power so agreeable, as that we should desire to see it repeated. Every Rebellion sub∣dued and Plot discovered, contribute to the firmer established of the Prince: In the latter case, the knot of Conspirators is entirely broke, and they are to begin their work anew under a thousand disadvantages; so that those diligent enquiries into remote and problematical guilt, with a new power of enforcing them by chains and dungeons to every person whose face a Mi∣nister thinks fit to dislike, are not only oppo∣site to that Maxim, which declareth it better that ten guilty men should escape, than one in∣nocent suffer; but likewise leave a gate wide
<PB N="31" REF="47"/>
open to the whole Tribe of Informers, the most accursed, and prostitute, and abandoned race, that God ever permitted to plague mankind.</P>
<P>It is true the Romans had a custom of chu∣sing a Dictator, during whose administration the Power of other Magistrates was suspended; but this was done upon the greatest emergen∣cies; a War near their doors, or some civil Dissention: For Armies must be governed by arbitrary power. But when the Virtue of that Commonwealth gave place to luxury and am∣bition, this very office of Dictator became per∣petual in the persons of the Caesars and their Successors, the most infamous Tyrants that have any where appeared in story.</P>
<P>These are some of the sentiments I had, re∣lating to publick affairs, while I was in the world: what they are at present, is of little importance either to that or myself; neither can I truly say I have any at all, or, if I had, I dare not venture to publish them: For how∣ever orthodox they may be while I am now writing, they may become criminal enough to bring me into trouble before midsummer. And indeed I have often wished for some time past, that a political Catechism might be published by authority four times a year, in order to in∣struct us how we are to speak, write, and act during the current quarter. I have by expe∣rience
<PB N="32" REF="48"/>
felt the want of such an instructer: For, intending to make my court to some people on the prevailing side, by advancing certain old whiggish principles, which, it seems, had been exploded about a month before, I have passed for a disaffected person. I am not ignorant how idle a thing it is, for a man in obscurity to at∣tempt defending his reputation as a Writer, while the spirit of Faction hath so universally possessed the minds of men, that they are not at leisure to attend to any thing else.

<P>All I can reasonably hope for by his letter, is to convince my friends, and others who are pleased to wish me well, that I have neither been so ill a Subject nor so stupid an Author, as I have been represented by the virulence of Libellers, whose malice hath taken the same train in both, by fathering dangerous Princi∣ples in government upon me, which I never maintained, and insipid Productions, which I am not capable of writing. For, however I

<P>COming home after a short Christmas ram∣ble, I found a letter upon my table, and little expected when I opened it to read your name at the bottom. The best and greatest part of my life, until these last eight years, I spent in England; there I made my friendships, and there I left my desires. I am condemned for ever to another country; what is in pru∣duence to be done? I think, to be <HI>oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis.</HI> What can be the design of your letter but malice, to wake me out of a scurvy sleep, which however is better
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>
than none? I am towards nine years older since I left you, yet that is the least of my al∣terations; my business, my diversions, my con∣versations, are all entirely changed for the worse, and so are my studies and my amusements in writing; yet, after all, this humdrum way of life might be passable enough, if you would let me alone. I shall not be able to relish my wine, my parsons, my horses, nor my garden for three months, until the spirit you have raised shall be dispossessed. I have sometimes won∣dered that I have not visited you, but I have been stopt by too many reasons, besides years and laziness, and yet these are very good ones. Upon my return after half a year amongst you, there would be to me <HI>Desiderio nec pudor nec modus.</HI> I was three years reconciling my∣self to the scene, and the business, to which fortune hath condemned me, and stupidity was what I had recourse to. Besides, what a figure should I make in London, while my friends are in poverty, exile, distress, or imprisonment, and my enemies with rods of iron? Yet I often threaten myself with the journey, and am every summer practising to get health to bear it: The only inconvenience is, that I grow old in the ex∣periment. Although I care not to talk to you as a Divine, yet I hope you have not been author of your colic: do you drink bad wine, or keep
<PB N="35" REF="51"/>
bad company? Are you not as many years ol∣der as I? It will not be always <HI>Et tibi quos mihi dempserit Apponet annos.</HI> I am heartily sorry you have any dealings with that ugly distem∣per, and I believe our friend Arbuthnot will recommend you to temperance and exercise. I wish they could have as good an effect upon the giddiness I am subject to, and which this mo∣ment I am not free from. I should have been glad if you had lengthened your letter by tel∣ling me the present condition of many of my old acquaintance, Congreve, Arbuthnot, Lewis, &amp;c. but you mention only Mr. Pope, who I believe is lazy, or else he might have added three lines of his own. I am extremely glad he is not in your case of needing great mens fa∣vour, and could heartily wish that you were in his. I have been considering why Poets have such ill success in making their Court, since they are allowed to be the greatest and best of all flatterers: The defect is, that they flatter only in print or in writing, but not by word of mouth: They will give things under their hand which they make a conscience of speaking. Besides, they are too libertine to haunt anti∣chambers, too poor to bribe Porters and foot∣men, and too proud to cringe to second-hand favourites in a great family. Tell me, are you not under Original sin by the dedication of your
<PB N="36" REF="52"/>
Eclogues to Lord Bolingbroke? I am an ill Judge at this distance; and besides, am, for my ease, utterly ignorant of the commonest things that pass in the world; but if all Courts have a sameness in them (as the Parsons phrase it) things may be as they were in my time, when all employments went to Parliament-mens Friends, who had been useful in Elections, and there was always a huge List of names in ar∣rears at the Treasury, which would at least take up your seven years expedient to discharge even one half. I am of opinion, if you will not be offended, that the surest course would be to get your Friend who lodgeth in your house to recommend you to the next chief Governor who comes over here for a good civil employ∣ment, or to be one of his Secretaries, which your Parliament-men are fond enough of, when there is no room at home. The wine is good and reasonable; you may dine twice a week at the Deanry-house; there is a sett of company in this town sufficient for one man; folks will admire you, because they have read you, and read of you; and a good employment will make you live tolerably in London, or sump∣tuously here; or if you divide between both places, it will be for your health.</P>
<P>I wish I could do more than say I love you. I left you in a good way both for the late
<PB N="37" REF="53"/>
Court, and the Successors; and by the force of too much honesty or too little sublunary wis∣dom, you fell between two stools.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Jan. 12, 1723.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Find a rebuke in a late Letter of yours, that both stings and pleaseth me extremely. Your saying that I ought to have writ a Post∣script to my friend Gay's, makes me not con∣tent to write less than a whole Letter; and your seeming to take his kindly, gives me hopes you will look upon this as a sincere ef∣fect of Friendship. Indeed as I cannot but own the Laziness with which you tax me, and with which I may equally charge you, for both of us have had (and one of us hath both had and given <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Alluding to his large work on Homer.</NOTE>) a Surfeit of writing; so I
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
really thought you would know your self to be so certainly intitled to my Friendship, that it was a possession you could not imagine stood in need of any further Deeds or Writings to assure you of it.</P>
<P>Whatever you seem to think of your with∣drawn and separate state at this distance, and in this Absence, Dean Swift lives still in Eng∣land, in every place and company where he would chuse to live, and I find him in all the Conversations I keep, and in all the Hearts in which I desire any share.</P>
<P>We have never met these many years with∣out mention of you. Besides my old Acquaint∣ance, I have found that all my friends of a later date are such as were yours before: Lord Oxford, Lord Harcourt, and Lord Harley may look upon me as one entailed upon them by you: Lord Bolingbroke is now returned (as I hope) to take Me with all his other He∣reditary Rights: and, indeed, he seems grown so much a Philosopher, as to set his heart up∣on some of them as little, as upon the Poet you gave him. It is sure my ill fate, that all those I most loved, and with whom I most lived, must be banished: After both of you left Eng∣land, my constant Host was the Bishop of<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Dr Atterbury.</NOTE> Ro∣chester. Sure this is a nation that is cursedly

afraid of being over-run with too much Polite∣ness, and cannot regain one great Genius, but at the expence of another <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The Bishop of Roches∣ter thought this to be indeed the case; and that the price agreed on for Lord B.'s re∣turn was his banishment: an imagination, which so strongly possessed him when he went abroad, that all, which his friends could say or do, could not convince him of the solly of it.</NOTE>.

This leads me to give you some ac∣count of the manner of my life and Conversa∣tion, which has been infinitely more various and dissipated, than when you knew me and cared for me; and among all Sexes, Parties, and Professions. A Glut of Study and Retire∣ment in the first part of my life cast me into this; and this, I begin to see, will throw me again into Study and Retirement.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="56" MS="y"/>
The Civilities I have met with from oppo∣site Setts of people, have hinder'd me from be∣ing violent or sour to any Party; but at the same time the Observations and Experiences I cannot but have collected, have made me less fond of, and less surprized at, any: I am there∣fore the more afflicted and the more angry at the Violences and Hardships I see practised by either. The merry Vein you knew me in, is sunk into a Turn of Reflection, that has made the world pretty indifferent to me; and yet I have acquired a Quietness of mind which by sits improves into a certain degree of Chearful∣ness, enough to make me just so good humour∣ed as to wish that world well. My Friend∣ships are encreased by new ones, yet no part of the warmth I felt for the old is diminished. Aversions I have none, but to Knaves (for Fools I have learned to bear with) and such I cannot be commonly civil to; for I think those men are next to Knaves who converse with them. The greatest Man in power of this sort shall hardly make me bow to him, unless I had a personal obligation, and that I will take care not to have. The top pleasure of my life is one I learned from you both how to gain and how to use; the Freedom of Friendship with men much my Superiors. To have pleased great men, according to Horace, is a praise; but not to
<PB N="41" REF="57" MS="y"/>
have flattered them and yet not have displeased them, is a greater. I have carefully avoided all Intercourse with Poets and Scriblers, un∣less where by great chance I have found a mo∣dest one. By these means I have had no quar∣rels with any personally; none have been Ene∣mies, but who were also Strangers to me; and as there is no great need of an Eclaircisment with such, whatever they writ or said I never retaliated, not only never seeming to know, but often really never knowing, any thing of the matter. There are very few things that give me the Anxiety of a Wish; the strongest I have would be to pass my days with you, and a few such as you: But Fate has dispersed them all about the world; and I find to wish it is as vain, as to wish to see the Millennium and the Kingdom of the Just upon earth.</P>
<P>If I have sinned in my long silence, consider there is one to whom you yourself have been as great a sinner. As soon as you see his hand, you will learn to do me justice, and feel in your heart how long a man may be silent to those he truly loves and respects.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord BOLINGBROKE to Dr. SWIFT.</HEAD>
<P>I Am not so lazy as Pope, and therefore you must not expect from me the same indul∣gence to Laziness; in defending his own cause he pleads yours, and becomes your Advocate while he appeals to you as his Judge: You will do the same on your part; and I, and the rest of your common Friends, shall have great justice to expect from two such righteous Tri∣bunals: You resemble perfectly the two Ale∣house-keepers in Holland, who were at the same time Burgomasters of the Town, and tax∣ed one another's Bills alternately. I declare be∣fore-hand I will not stand to the award; my Title to your Friendship is good, and wants neither Deeds nor Writings to confirm it: but annual Acknowledgments at least are necessary to preserve it: and I begin to suspect by your defrauding me of them, that you hope in time to dispute it, and to urge Prescription against me. I would not say one word to you about myself (since it is a subject on which you ap∣pear to have no curiosity) was it not to try how far the contrast between Pope's fortune and manner of life, and mine, may be carried.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="59"/>
I have been, then, infinitely more uniform and less dissipated than when you knew me and cared for me. That Love which I used to scatter with some profusion among the female kind, has been these many years devoted to one object. A great many misfortunes (for so they are called, though sometimes very impro∣perly) and a retirement from the world, have made that just and nice discrimination between my Acquaintance and my Friends, which we have seldom sagacity enough to make for our selves; those insects of various hues, which used to hum and buz about me while I stood in the sunshine, have disappeared since I lived in the shade. No man comes to a Hermitage but for the sake of the Hermit; a few philo∣sophical Friends come often to mine, and they are such as you would be glad to live with, if a dull climate and duller company have not al∣tered you extremely from what you was nine years ago.</P>
<P>The hoarse voice of Party was never heard in this quiet place; Gazettes and Pamphlets are banished from it, and if the Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff be admitted, this distinction is owing to some strokes by which it is judged that this illustrious Philosopher had (like the Indian Fohu, the Grecian Pythagoras, the Per∣sian Zoroaster, and others his Precursors among
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
the Zabians, Magians, and the Egyptian Seers) both his outward and his inward Doctrine, and that he was of no side at the bottom. When I am there, I forget I ever was of any party my self; nay, I am often so happily absorbed by the abstracted reason of things, that I am ready to imagine there never was any such monster as Party. Alas, I am soon awakened from that pleasing dream by the Greek and Roman Hi∣storians, by Guicciardine, by Machiavel, and Thuanus; for I have vowed to read no History of our own country, till that body of it which you promise to finish, appears <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See the first note on Lett. V. of this Vol.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am under no apprehension that a glut of Study and Retirement should cast me back in∣to the hurry of the world; on the contrary, the single regret which I ever feel, is that I fell so late into this course of life; my Philosophy grows confirmed by habit, and if you and I meet again, I will extort this approbation, from you: <HI>Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eo per∣ductus, ut non tantum recte facere possim, sed nisi recte facere non possim.</HI> The little incivilities I have met with from opposite setts of people, have been so far from rendering me violent or sour to any, that I think my self obliged to them all; some have cured me of my fears, by shewing me how impotent the malice of the
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
world is; others have cured me of my hopes, by shewing how precarious popular friendships are; all have cured me of surprize: In driving me out of party, they have driven me out of cursed company; and in stripping me of Titles and Rank, and Estate, and such trinkets, which every man that will may spare, they have given me that which no man can be happy without.</P>
<P>Reflection and habit have rendered the world so indifferent to me, that I am neither afflicted nor rejoiced, angry nor pleased at what happens in it, any farther than personal friendships interest me in the affairs of it, and this principle extends my cares but a little way. Perfect Tranquillity is the general tenour of my life: good digestions, serene weather, and some other mechanic springs, wind me above it now and then, but I never fall below it; I am sometimes gay, but I am never sad. I have gained new friends, and have lost some old ones; my acquisitions of this kind give me a good deal of pleasure, because they have not been made lightly: I know no vows so solemn as those of friendship, and therefore a pretty long noviciate of acquaintance should methinks precede them: My losses of this kind give me but little trouble, I contributed nothing to them, and a friend who breaks with me un∣justly, is not worth preserving. As soon as I
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>
leave this Town (which will be in a few days) I shall fall back into that course of life, which keeps knaves and fools at a great distance from me: I have an aversion to them both, but in the ordinary course of life I think I can bear the sensible knave better than the fool. One must indeed with the former be in some or other of the attitudes of those wooden men whom I have seen before a sword-cutler's shop in Germany; but even in these constrained postures the witty Rascal will divert me; and he that diverts me does me a great deal of good, and lays me under an obligation to him, which I am not obliged to pay him in another coin: The Fool obliges me to be almost as much up∣on my guard as the knave, and he makes me no amends; he numbs me like the Torpor, or he teazes me like the Fly. This is the Picture of an old Friend, and more like him than that will be which you once asked, and which he will send you, if you continue still to desire it.—Adieu, dear Swift, with all thy faults I love thee intirely; make an effort, and love me on with all mine.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>Sept. 20, 1723.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>REturning from a summer expedition of four months on account of my health, I found a letter from you, with an appendix longer than yours from Lord Bolingbroke. I believe there is not a more miserable malady than an unwillingness to write letters to our best friends, and a man might be philosopher enough in finding out reasons for it. One thing is clear, that it shews a mighty difference betwixt Friendship and Love, for a lover (as I have heard) is always scribling to his mistress. If I could permit my self to believe what your ci∣vility makes you say, that I am still remem∣bered by my friends in England, I am in the right to keep my self here—<HI>Non sum qualis eram.</HI> I left you in a period of life when one year does more execution than three at yours, to which if you add the dullness of the air, and of the people, it will make a terrible sum. I have no very strong faith in you pretenders to Retirement; you are not of an age for it, nor have gone through either good or bad fortune enough to go into a corner, and form conclu∣sions <HI>de contemptu mundi &amp; fuga saeculi,</HI> unless
<PB N="48" REF="64"/>
a Poet grows weary of too much applause, as Ministers do of too much weight of business.</P>
<P>Your happiness is greater than your Merit, in chusing your Favourites so indifferently among either Party: this you owe partly to your Education, and partly to your Genius employing you in an Art in which Faction has nothing to do, for I suppose Virgil and Horace are equally read by Whigs and Tories. You have no more to do with the Constitution of Church and State, than a Christian at Constan∣tinople; and you are so much the wiser and the happier, because both Parties will approve your Poetry as long as you are known to be of neither.</P>
<P>Your notions of Friendship are new to me <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Yet they are the Christian notions.</NOTE>: I believe every man is born with his <HI>quantum,</HI> and he cannot give to one without robbing an∣other. I very well know to whom I would give the first places in my Friendship, but they are not in the way: I am condemned to an∣other scene, and therefore I distribute it in Pen∣nyworths to those about me, and who displease me least; and should do the same to my fel∣low prisoners if I were condemned to jayl. I can likewise tolerate Knaves much better than Fools, because their knavery does me no hurt in the commerce I have with them, which
<PB N="49" REF="65"/>
however I own is more dangerous, tho' not so troublesome, as that of Fools. I have often endeavoured to establish a Friendship among all Men of Genius, and would fain have it done: they are seldom above three or four Contemporaries, and if they could be united, would drive the world before them. I think it was so among the Poets in the time of Au∣gustus: but Envy, and Party, and Pride, have hindered it among us. I do not include the Subalterns, of which you are seldom without a large Tribe. Under the name of Poets and Scriblers I suppose you mean the Fools you are content to see sometimes, when they happen to be modest; which was not frequent among them while I was in the world.</P>
<P>I would describe to you my way of living, if any method could be call'd so in this Coun∣try. I chuse my companions among those of least consequence and most complyance: I read the most trifling Books I can find, and whenever I write, it is upon the most trifling subjects: But riding, walking, and sleeping take up eighteen of the twenty-four hours. I procrastinate more than I did twenty years ago, and have several things to finish which I put off to twenty years hence; <HI>Haec est vita Solutorum,</HI> &amp;c. I send you the compliments of a friend of yours, who hath passed four months

this summer with two grave acquaintance at his country-house without ever once going to Dublin, which is but eight miles distant; yet when he returns to London, I will engage you shall sind him as deep in the Court of Requests, the Park, the Opera's, and the Coffee-house, as any man there. I am now with him for a few days.</P>
<P>You must remember me with great affec∣tion to Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Congreve, and Gay,—I think there are no more <HI>eodem tertio's</HI> be∣tween you and me, except Mr. Jervas, to whose house I address this, for want of knowing where you live: for it was not clear from your last whether you lodge with Lord Peterborow, or he with you?</P>

I am disappointed at not knowing better a man whom you esteem, and comfort myself only with having got a Let∣ter from you, with which (after all) I sit down a gainer; since to my great pleasure it confirms my hope of once more seeing you. After so many dispersions and so many divisions, two or three of us may yet be gather'd together: not to plot, not to contrive silly schemes of ambi∣tion, or to vex our own or others hearts with busy vanities (such as perhaps at one time of life or other take their Tour in every man) but to divert ourselves, and the world too if it pleases; or at worst, to laugh at others as innocently and as unhurtfully as at ourselves. Your Tra∣vels<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gulliver.</NOTE> I hear much of; my own I promise you shall never more be in a strange land, but a di∣ligent, I hope useful, investigation of my own Territories <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Essay on Man.</NOTE>. I mean no more Translations, but something domestic, fit for my own country, and for my own time.</P>
<P>If you come to us, I'll find you elderly La∣dies enough that can halloo, and two that can nurse, and they are too old and feeble to make

too much noise; as you will guess, when I tell you they are my own mother, and my own nurse. I can also help you to a Lady who is as deaf, tho' not so old, as yourself; you'll be pleas'd with one-another I'll engage, tho' you don't hear one-another: you'll converse like spirits by intuition. What you'll most won∣der at is, she is considerable at Court, yet no Party-woman, and lives in Court, yet would be easy, and make you easy.</P>
<P>One of those you mention (and I dare say always will remember) Dr. Arbuthnot, is at this time ill of a very dangerous distemper, an imposthume in the bowels; which is broke, but the event is very uncertain. Whatever that be (he bids me tell you, and I write this by him) he lives or dies your faithful friend; and one reason he has to desire a little longer life, is the wish to see you once more.</P>
<P>He is gay enough in this circumstance to tell you, he wou'd give you (if he cou'd) such ad∣vice as might cure your deafness, but he would not advise you, if you were cured, to quit the pretence of it; because you may by that means hear as much as you will, and answer as little as you please.

<P>I Am now returning to the noble scene of Dublin, into the grand Monde, for fear of burying my parts: to signalize myself among Curates and Vicars, and correct all corruptions crept in relating to the weight of bread and butter, through those dominions where I go∣vern. I have employ'd my time (besides ditch∣ing) in finishing, correcting, amending, and transcribing my<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gulliver's Travels.</NOTE> Travels, in four parts com∣pleat, newly augmented, and intended for the press when the world shall deserve them, or ra∣ther when a Printer shall be found brave enough to venture his ears. I like the scheme of our meeting after distresses and dispersions; but the chief end I propose to myself in all my la∣bours, is to vex the world, rather than divert it; and if I could compass that design with∣out hurting my own person or fortune, I would be the most indefatigable writer you have ever seen, without reading. I am exceedingly pleased that you have done with Translations; Lord Treasurer Oxford often lamented that a
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>
rascally world should lay you under a necessity of misemploying your genius for so long a time. But since you will now be so much better em∣ploy'd, when you think of the world, give it one lash the more at my request. I have ever hated all Nations, Professions, and Commu∣nities; and all my love is towards Individuals: for instance, I hate the Tribe of Lawyers, but I love Counsellor such a one, and Judge such a one: 'Tis so with Physicians, (I will not speak of my own Trade) Soldiers, English, Scotch, French, and the rest. But principally I hate and detest that animal called Man, although I heartily love John, Peter, Thomas, and so forth. This is the system upon which I have governed myself many years (but do not tell) and so I shall go on till I have done with them. I have got materials towards a Treatise, prov∣ing the falsity of that definition <HI>Animal ratio∣nale,</HI> and to shew it should be only <HI>rationis capax.</HI> Upon this great foundation of Misan∣throphy (tho' not in Timon's manner) the whole building of my Travels is erected; and I never will have peace of mind, till all honest men are of my opinion: By consequence you are to embrace it immediately, and procure that all who deserve my esteem may do so too. The matter is so clear, that it will admit of
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>
no dispute; nay, I will hold a hundred pounds that you and I agree in the point.</P>
<P>I did not know your Odyssey was finished, being yet in the country, which I shall leave in three days. I thank you kindly for the pre∣sent, but shall like it three fourths the less, from the mixture you mention of other hands; how∣ever, I am glad you sav'd yourself so much drudgery—I have been long told by Mr. Ford of your great atchievements in building and planting, and especially of your subterranean passage to your garden, whereby you turned a Blunder into a Beauty, which is a piece of <HI>Ars Poetica.</HI></P>
<P>I have almost done with Harridans, and shall soon become old enough to fall in love with girls of fourteen. The Lady whom you describe to live at Court, to be deaf, and no party-woman, I take to be Mythology, but know not how to moralize it. She cannot be Mercy, for Mercy is neither deaf, nor lives at Court: Justice is blind, and perhaps deaf, but neither is she a Court-lady: Fortune is both blind and deaf, and a Court-lady, but then she is a most damnable Party-woman, and will never make me easy, as you promise. It must be Riches, which answers all your description: I am glad she visits you, but my voice is so weak, that I doubt she will never hear me.</P>

Mr. Lewis sent me an account of Dr. Ar∣buthnot's illness, which is a very sensible af∣fliction to me, who by living so long out of the world, have lost that hardness of heart con∣tracted by years and general conversation.

But however he is not without fault: There is a passage in Bede, highly commend∣ing the piety and learning of the Irish in that age, where after abundance of praises he over∣throws them all, by lamenting that, alas! they kept Easter at a wrong time of the year. So our Doctor has every quality and virtue that can make a man amiable or useful; but alas, he hath a sort of slouch in his Walk! I pray God protect him, for he is an excellent Chri∣stian, though not a Catholic.</P>
<P>I hear nothing of our Friend Gay, but I find the Court keeps him at hard meat. I advised him to come over here with a Lord Lieutenant. Philips writes little Flams (as Lord Leicester call'd those sort of verses) on Miss Carteret. A Dublin Blacksmith, a great Poet, hath imi∣tated his manner in a poem to the same Miss. Philips is a complainer, and on this occasion I told Lord Carteret, that Complainers never succeed at Court, though Railers do.</P>

Are you altogether a country gentleman? that I must address to you out of London, to the ha∣zard of your losing this precious letter, which I will now conclude altho' so much paper is left. I have an ill Name, and therefore shall not sub∣scribe it, but you will guess it comes from one who esteems and loves you about half as much as you deserve, I mean as much as he can.</P>
<P>I am in great concern, at what I am just told is in some of the news-papers, that Lord Bolingbroke is much hurt by a fall in hunting. I am glad he has so much Youth and vigour left (of which he hath not been thrifty) but I wonder he has no more Discretion.</P>

<P>I Am wonderfully pleas'd with the sudden∣ness of your kind answer. It makes me hope you are coming towards us, and that you incline more and more to your old friends, in proportion as you draw nearer to them; and are getting into our Vortex. Here is One, who was once a powerful planet, but has now (af∣ter long experience of all that comes of shining) learned to be content, with returning to his
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>
first point, without the thought or ambition of shining at all. Here is Another, who thinks one of the greatest glories of his Father was to have distinguish'd and loved you, and who loves you hereditarily. Here is Arbuthnot, re∣covered from the jaws of death, and more pleas'd with the hope of seeing you again, than of reviewing a world every part of which he has long despis'd, but what is made up of a few men like yourself. He goes abroad again, and is more chearful than even health can make a man, for he has a good conscience into the bargain (which is the most Catholic of all re∣medies, tho' not the most Universal.) I knew it would be a pleasure to you to hear this, and in truth that made me write so soon to you.</P>
<P>I'm sorry poor P. is not promoted in this age; for certainly if his reward be of the next, he is of all Poets the most miserable. I'm also sorry for another reason; if they don't promote him, they'll spoil the conclusion of one of my Satires, where, having endeavour'd to correct the Taste of the town in wit and criticism, I end thus,</P>
<LG>
<L>But what avails to lay down rules for sense?</L>

Our friend Gay is used as the friends of Tories are by Whigs (and generally by Tories too.) Because he had humour, he was supposed to have dealt with Dr. Swift; in like manner as when any one had learning formerly, he was thought to have dealt with the Devil. He puts his whole trust at Court in that Lady whom I describ'd to you, and whom you take to be an allegorical creature of fancy: I wish she really were Riches for his sake; though as for yours, I question whether (if you knew her) you would change her for the other?</P>
<P>Lord Bolingbroke had not the least harm by his fall, I wish he had receiv'd no more by his other fall; Lord Oxford had none by his. But Lord Bolingbroke is the most improved Mind since you saw him, that ever was improved without shifting into a new body, or being: <HI>paullo minus ab angelis.</HI> I have often imagined to myself, that if ever all of us meet again, af∣ter so many varieties and changes, after so much of the old world and of the old man in each of us has been alter'd, that scarce a single thought of the one, any more than a single atome of the other, remains just the same; I've fancy'd, I say, that we should meet like the righteous in the Millennium, quite in peace, divested of all our former Passions, smiling at our past fol∣lies, and content to enjoy the kingdom of the
<PB N="60" REF="76" MS="y"/>
Just in tranquillity. But I find you would ra∣ther be employ'd as an avenging Angel of wrath, to break your Vial of Indignation over the heads of the wretched creatures of this world; nay, would make them <HI>Eat your Book,</HI> which you have made (I doubt not) as bitter a pill for them as possible.</P>
<P>I won't tell you what designs I have in my head (besides writing a set of Maxims in op∣position to all Rochefoucault's principles <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was only said as an oblique reproof of the horrid misanthropy in the foregoing Letter; and which, he sup∣posed, might be chiefly oc∣casioned by the Dean's fond∣ness for <HI>Rochefoucault,</HI> whose <HI>Maxims</HI> are founded on the principle of an universal sel∣fishness in human nature.</NOTE>) till I see you here, face to face. Then you shall have no reason to complain of me, for want of a generous disdain of this world, though I have not lost my Ears in yours and their service. Lord Oxford too (whom I have now the third time mention'd in this Letter, and he deserves to be always mention'd in every thing that is address'd to you, or comes from you) expects you: That ought to be enough to bring you hither; 'tis a better reason than if the Nation expected you. For I really enter as fully as you can desire, into your principle of Love of Indi∣viduals: and I think the way to have a public spirit is first to have a private one; for who can believe (said a friend of mine) that any man
<PB N="61" REF="77" MS="y"/>
can care for a hundred thousand people, who never cared for one? No ill-humour'd man can ever be a Patriot, any more than a Friend.</P>
<P>I designed to have left the following page for Dr. Arbuthnot to fill, but he is so touch'd with the period in yours to me concerning him, that he intends to answer it by a whole letter. He too is busy about a book, which I guess he will tell you of. So adieu—what remains worth telling you? Dean Berkley is well, and happy in the prosecution of his Scheme. Lord Oxford and Lord Bolingbroke in health, Duke Disney so al∣so; Sir William Wyndham better, Lord Bathurst well. These and some others, preserve their ancient honour and ancient friendship. Those who do neither, if they were d—d, what is it to a Protestant priest, who has nothing to do with the dead? I answer for my own part as a Pa∣pist, I would not pray them out of Purgatory.</P>
<P>My name is as bad an one as yours, and ha∣ted by all bad Poets, from Hopkins and Stern∣hold to Gildon and Cibber. The first pray'd against me with the Turk; and a modern Imi∣tator of theirs (whom I leave you to find out) has added the Christian to 'em, with proper definitions of each in this manner,</P>

<P>I Should sooner have acknowledged yours, if a feverish disorder and the relics of it had not disabled me for a fortnight. I now begin to make excuses, because I hope I am pretty near seeing you, and therefore I would culti∣vate an acquaintance; because if you do not know me when we meet, you need only keep one of my letters, and compare it with my face, for my face and letters are counterparts of my heart. I fear I have not express'd that right, but I mean well, and I hate blots: I look in your letter, and in my conscience you say the same thing, but in a better manner. Pray tell my Lord Bolingbroke that I wish he were ba∣nish'd again, for then I should hear from him, when he was full of philosophy, and talked <HI>de contemptu mundi.</HI> My Lord Oxford was so ex∣tremely kind as to write to me immediately an account of his son's birth; which I immediate∣ly acknowledg'd, but before my letter could reach him, I wish'd it in the sea: I hope I was more afflicted than his Lordship. 'Tis hard that Parsons and Beggars should be over-run with bratts, while so great and good a family
<PB N="63" REF="81"/>
wants an heir to continue it. I have receiv'd his Father's picture, but I lament <HI>(sub sigillo confessionis)</HI> that it is not so true a resemblance as I could wish. Drown the world! I am not content with despising it, but I would anger it, if I could with safety. I wish there were an Hospital built for its Despisers, where one might act with safety, and it need not be a large building, only I would have it well en∣dow'd. P ** is <HI>fort chancellant</HI> whether he shall turn Parson or no. But all employments here are engaged, or in reversion. Cast Wits and cast Beaux have a proper sanctuary in the church: yet we think it a severe judgment, that a fine gentleman, and so much the finer for hating Ecclesiastics, should be a domestic humble retainer to an Irish Prelate. He is nei∣ther Secretary nor Gentleman-usher, yet serves in both capacities. He hath published several reasons why he never came to see me, but the best is, that I have not waited on his Lordship. We have had a Poem sent from London in imi∣tation of that on Miss Carteret. It is on Miss Harvey of a day old; and we say and think it is yours. I wish it were not, because I am against monopolies—You might have spared me a few more lines of your Satire, but I hope in a few months to see it all.

I am older by thirty years, Lord Bolingbroke by twenty, and you but by ten, than when we last were together; and we should differ more than ever, you coquetting a maid of honour, my Lord looking on to see how the gamesters play, and I railing at you both. I desire you and all my friends will take a special care that my Disaffection to the world may not be im∣puted to my Age, for I have credible witnesses ready to depose, that it hath never varied from the twenty-first to the f—ty-eighth year of my life (pray fill that blank charitably.) I tell you after all, that I do not hate mankind, it is <HI>vous autres</HI> who hate them, because you would have them reasonable Animals, and are angry at be∣ing disappointed: I have always rejected that definition, and made another of my own. I am no more angry with—than I was with the Kite that last week flew away with one of my chickens; and yet I was pleased when one of my servants shot him two days after. This I say, because you are so hardy as to tell me of your intentions to write Maxims in opposition to Rochefoucault, who is my favourite, because I found my whole character in him <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This, methinks, is no great compliment to his own heart.</NOTE>; how∣ever I will read him again, because it is possible I may have since undergone some alterations.—

Take care the bad Poets do not out-wit you, as they have served the good ones in every age, whom they have provok'd to transmit their names to posterity. Moevius is as well known as Virgil, and Gildon will be as well known as you, if his name gets into your Verses: and as to the difference between good and bad fame, 'tis a perfect trifle.

<P>I Find myself the better acquainted with you for a long Absence, as men are with them∣selves for a long Affliction: Absence does but hold off a Friend, to make one see him the more truly. I am infinitely more pleas'd to hear you are coming near us, than at any thing you seem to think in my favour; an opinion which has perhaps been aggrandized by the distance or dulness of Ireland, as objects look larger thro' a medium of Fogs: and yet I am infinitely pleas'd with that too. I am much the happier for finding (a better thing than our

Wits) our Judgments jump, in the notion that all Scriblers should be past by in silence. To vindicate one's self against such nasty slander, is much as wise as it was in your country-man, when the people imputed a stink to him, to prove the contrary by shewing his backside. So let Gildon and Philips rest in peace! what Virgil had to do with Moevius, that he should wear him upon his sleeve to all eternity, I don't know. I've been the longer upon this, that I may prepare you for the reception both you and your works may possibly meet in England. We your true acquaintance will look upon you as a good man, and love you; others will look upon you as a Wit, and hate you. So you know the worst; unless you are as vindicative as Virgil, or the aforesaid Hibernian.</P>
<P>I wish as warmly as you for an Hospital in which to lodge the Despisers of the world; on∣ly I fear it would be fill'd wholly like Chelsea, with maimed Soldiers, and such as had been disabled in its service. I would rather have those, that, out of such generous principles as you and I, despise it, fly in its face, than re∣tire from it. Not that I have much anger a∣gainst the Great, my spleen is at the little rogues of it; it would vex one more to be knock'd on the head with a Piss-pot, than by a Thun∣der-bolt As to great Oppressors, they are like

<P>So much for enemies, now for friends. Mr. L—thinks all this indiscreet: the Dr. not so; he loves mischief the best of any good-natur'd man in England. Lord B. is above trifling: when he writes of any thing in this world, he is more than mortal; <HI>if ever he trifles, it must be when he turns a Divine.</HI> Gay is writing Tales for Prince William: I suppose Mr. Philips will take this very ill, for two reasons; one that he thinks all childish things belong to him, and the other because he'll take it ill to be taught that one may write things to a child without being childish.

My Lord Peterbo∣row spoiled every body's dinner, but especially mine, with telling us that you were detained by sickness. Pray let me have three lines under any hand or pot-hook that will give me a better account of your health; which concerns me more than others, because I love and esteem you for reasons that most others have little to do with, and would be the same although you had never touched a pen, further than with writing to me.</P>

'Tis a sensation like that of a limb lopp'd off, one is trying every minute unawares to use it, and finds it is not. I may say you have used me more cruelly than you have done any other man; you have made it more impossible for me to live at ease with∣out you: Habitude itself would have done that, if I had less friendship in my nature than I have. Besides my natural memory of you, you have made a local one, which presents you to me in every place I frequent; I shall never more think of Lord Cobham's, the woods of Ciceter, or the pleasing prospect of Byberry, but your Idea must be join'd with 'em; nor see one seat in my own garden, or one room in my own house,

without a Phantome of you, sitting or walking before me. I travell'd with you to Chester, I felt the extream heat of the weather, the inns, the roads, the confinement and closeness of the un∣easy coach, and wish'd a hundred times I had either a Deanery or a Horse in my gift. In real truth, I have felt my soul peevish ever since with all about me, from a warm uneasy desire after you. I am gone out of myself to no pur∣pose, and cannot catch you. <HI>Inhiat in pedes</HI> was not more properly apply'd to a poor dog after a hare, than to me with regard to your departure. I wish I could think no more of it, but lye down and sleep till we meet again, and let that day (how far soever off it be) be the morrow. Since I cannot, may it be my amends that every thing you wish may attend you where you are, and that you may find eve∣ry friend you have there, in the state you wish him, or her; so that your visits to us may have no other effect, than the progress of a rich man to a remote estate, which he finds greater than he expected; which knowledge only serves to make him live happier where he is, with no disagreeable prospect if ever he should chuse to remove. May this be your state till it be∣come what I wish. But indeed I cannot ex∣press the warmth, with which I wish you all things, and myself you. Indeed you are in∣graved

while in the way to it: otherwise believe me, every tittle of each is important to me, which sets any one thing before my eyes that happens to you. I writ you a long letter, which I guess reach'd you the day after your arrival. Since then I had a conference with Sir—who ex∣press'd his desire of having seen you again before you left us. He said he observed a willingness in you to live among us; which I did not deny; but at the same time told him, you had no such design in your coming this time, which was merely to see a few of those you loved: but that indeed all those wished it, and particular∣ly Lord Peterborow and myself, who wished you lov'd Ireland less, had you any reason to love England more. I said nothing but what I think wou'd induce any man to be as fond of you as I, plain Truth, did they know either it, or you. I can't help thinking (when I consider the whole short List of our friends) that none of 'em except you and I are quali∣fy'd for the Mountains of Wales. The Dr. goes to Cards, Gay to Court; one loses mo∣ney, one loses his time: Another of our friends labours to be unambitious, but he labours in an unwilling soil.

Mr. Congreve is too sick to bear a thin air; and she that leads him too rich to enjoy any thing. Lord Peterborow can go to any climate, but never stay in any.

Mr. Bethel indeed is too good and too honest to live in the world, but yet 'tis fit, for its example, he should. We are left to ourselves in my opinion, and may live where we please, in Wales, Dublin, or Ber∣mudas: And for me, I assure you I love the world so well, and it loves me so well, that I care not in what part of it I pass the rest of my days. I see no sunshine but in the face of a friend.</P>
<P>I had a glympse of a letter of yours lately, by which I find you are (like the vulgar) apter to think well of people out of power, than of people in power; perhaps 'tis a mistake, but however there's something in it generous. Mr. ** takes it extreme kindly, I can perceive, and he has a great mind to thank you for that good opinion, for which I believe he is only to thank his ill fortune: for if I am not in an error, he would rather be in power, than out.</P>

<P>ABout ten days ago a Book was publish'd here of the Travels of one Gulliver, which hath been the conversation of the whole town ever since: The whole impression sold in a week; and nothing is more diverting than to hear the different opinions people give of it, though all agree in liking it extremely. 'Tis generally said that you are the Author; but I am told, the Bookseller declares, he knows not from what hand it came. From the highest
<PB N="76" REF="94"/>
to the lowest it is universally read, from the Cabinet-council to the Nursery. The Politi∣cians to a man agree, that it is free from par∣ticular reflections, but that the Satire on gene∣ral societies of men is too severe. Not but we now and then meet with people of greater per∣spicuity, who are in search for particular appli∣cations in every leaf; and 'tis highly probable we shall have keys publish'd to give light into Gulliver's design. Lord—is the person who least approves it, blaming it as a design of evil consequence to depreciate human nature, at which it cannot be wondered that he takes most offence, being himself the most accom∣plish'd of his species, and so losing more than any other of that praise which is due both to the dignity and virtue of a man <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is no wonder a man of worth should <HI>condemn</HI> a satire on his species; as it injures Virtue and violates Truth: And, as little, that a very corrupt reader should <HI>approve</HI> it, because it justi∣fies his principles and tends to excuse his practice.</NOTE>. Your friend, my Lord Harcourt, commends it very much, though he thinks in some places the matter too far carried. The Duchess Dowager of Marl∣borough is in raptures at it; she says she can dream of nothing else since she read it: she de∣clares, that she hath now found out, that her whole life hath been lost in caressing the worst part of mankind, and treating the best as her
<PB N="77" REF="95"/>
foes; and that if she knew Gulliver, tho' he had been the worst enemy she ever had, she would give up her present acquaintance for his friendship. You may see by this, that you are not much injur'd by being suppos'd the Au∣thor of this piece. If you are, you have dis∣oblig'd us, and two or three of your best friends, in not giving us the least hint of it while you were with us; and in particular Dr. Arbuthnot, who says it is ten thousand pitys he had not known it, he could have added such abundance of things upon every subject. A∣mong Lady-critics, some have found out that Mr. Gulliver had a particular malice to Maids of honour. Those of them who frequent the Church, say, his design is impious, and that it is depreciating the works of the Creator. Not∣withstanding, I am told the Princess hath read it with great pleasure. As to other Critics, they think the flying island is the least enter∣taining; and so great an opinion the town have of the impossibility of Gulliver's writing at all below himself, 'tis agreed that part was not writ by the same hand, tho' this hath its defenders too. It hath pass'd Lords and Com∣mons, <HI>nemine contradicente;</HI> and the whole town, men, women, and children are quite full of it.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="96"/>
Perhaps I may all this time be talking to you of a Book you have never seen, and which hath not yet reach'd Ireland; if it hath not, I believe what we have said will be sufficient to recommend it to your reading, and that you will order me to send it to you.</P>

<P>I Have resolved to take time; and in spite of all misfortunes and demurs, which sickness, lameness, or disability of any kind can throw in my way, to write you (at intervals) a long letter. My two least fingers of one hand hang impediments to the others <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was occasioned by a bad accident as he was re∣turning home in a friends Chariot; which in passing a bridge was overturned, and thrown with the horses into the River. The glasses be∣ing up, and Mr. Pope un∣able to break them, he was in immediate danger of drowning, when the postil∣lion, who had just recovered himself, beat the glass, which lay uppermost to pieces: a fragment of which cut one of Mr. Pope's hands very desperately.</NOTE>, like useless depend∣ents,
<PB N="80" REF="98"/>
who only take up room, and never are active or assistant to our wants: I shall never be much the better for 'em—I congratulate you first upon what you call your Cousin's wonder∣ful Book, which is <HI>publica trita manu</HI> at pre∣sent, and I prophesy will be hereafter the ad∣miration of all men. That countenance with which it is received by some statesmen, is de∣lightful; I wish I could tell you how every single man looks upon it, to observe which has been my whole diversion this fortnight. I've never been a night in London since you left me, till now for this very end, and indeed it has fully answered my expectations.</P>
<P>I find no considerable man very angry at the book: some indeed think it rather too bold, and too general a Satire: but none, that I hear of, accuse it of particular reflections (I mean no persons of consequence, or good judgment; the mob of Critics, you know, always are de∣sirous to apply Satire to those they envy for be∣ing above them) so that you needed not to have been so secret upon this head. Motte re∣ceiv'd the copy (he tells me) he knew not from whence, nor from whom, dropp'd at his house in the dark, from a Hackney-coach: by com∣puting the time, I found it was after you left England, so, for my part, I suspend my judg∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="99"/>
I am pleas'd with the nature and quality of your Present to the Princess. The Irish stuff you sent to Mrs. H. her R. H. laid hold of, and has made up for her own use. Are you de∣termin'd to be National in every thing, even in your civilities? you are the greatest Politician in Europe at this rate; but as you are a ratio∣nal Politician, there's no great fear of you, you will never succeed.</P>
<P>Another thing, in which you have pleased me, was what you say to Mr. P. by which it seems to me that you value no man's civility above your own dignity, or your own reason. Surely, without flattery, you are now above all parties of men, and it is high time to be so, after twenty or thirty years observation of the great world.</P>
<P><Q><L>Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri.</L></Q>
I question not, many men would be of your intimacy, that you might be of their interest: But God forbid an honest or witty man should be of any, but that of his country. They have scroundrels enough to write for their passions and their designs; let us write for truth, for honour, and for posterity. If you must needs write about Politics at all (but perhaps 'tis full as wise to play the fool any other way) sure∣ly it ought to be so as to preserve the dignity
<PB N="82" REF="100"/>
and integrity of your character with those times to come, which will most impartially judge of you.</P>
<P>I wish you had writ to Lord Peterborow, no man is more affectionate toward you. Don't fancy none but Tories are your friends; for at that rate I must be, at most, but half your friend, and sincerely I am wholly so. Adieu, write often, and come soon, for many wish you well, and all would be glad of your company.</P>

<P>I Am just come from answering a Letter of Mrs. H—'s writ in such mystical terms, that I should never have found out the mean∣ing, if a Book had not been sent me called <HI>Gulliver's Travels,</HI> of which you say so much in yours. I read the Book over, and in the se∣cond volume observe several passages, which appear to be patch'd and altered <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was the fact, which is complained of and redres∣sed in the Dublin Edition of the Dean's works.</NOTE>, and the style of a different sort (unless I am much mis∣taken)

Dr. Arbuthnot likes the Projectors least <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Because he understood it to be intended as a satire on the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></NOTE>; others, you tell me, the Flying island; some think it wrong to be so hard upon whole Bo∣dies or Corporations, yet the general opinion is, that reflections on particular persons are most to be blam'd: so that in these cases, I think the best method is to let censure and opinion take their course. A Bishop here said, that book was full of improbable lies, and for his part, he hardly believed a word of it; and so much for Gulliver.</P>
<P>Going to England is a very good thing, if it were not attended with an ugly circumstance of returning to Ireland. It is a shame you do not persuade your Ministers to keep me on that side, if it were but by a court expedient of keeping me in prison for a Plotter; but at the same time I must tell you, that such journeys very much shorten my life, for a month here is longer than six at Twickenham.</P>
<P>How comes friend Gay to be so tedious? another man can publish fifty-thousand Lies sooner than he can fifty Fables.</P>
<P>I am just going to perform a very good of∣fice, it is to assist with the Archbishop, in de∣grading a Parson who couples all our beggars, by which I shall make one happy man: and

<P>I am come back, and have deprived the par∣son, who by a law here is to be hanged the next couple he marries: he declared to us that he resolved to be hanged, only desired that when he was to go to the gallows, the Archbishop would take off his Excommunication. Is not he a good Catholic? and yet he is but a Scotch-man. This is the only Irish event I ever troubled you with, and I think it deserves notice—Let me add, that, if I were Gulliver's friend, I would desire all my acquaintance to give out that his copy was basely mangled, and abused, and added to, and blotted out by the Printer; for so to me it seems, in the second volume particularly.</P>

<P>I Believe the hurt in your hand affects me more than it does yourself, and with reason, be∣cause

I may probably be a greater loser by it. What have Accidents to do with those who are neither jockeys, nor fox-hunters, nor bullies, nor drunkards? And yet a rascally Groom shall gallop a foundred horse ten miles upon a causeway, and get home safe.</P>
<P>I am very much pleas'd that you approve what was sent, because I remember to have heard a great man say, that nothing required more judgment than making a present; which when it is done to those of high rank, ought to be of something that is not readily got for money. You oblige me, and at the same time do me justice in what you observe as to Mr. P. Besides, it is too late in life for me to act other∣wise, and therefore I follow a very easy road to virtue, and purchase it cheap. If you will give me leave to join us, is not your life and mine a state of power, and dependence a state of slavery? We care not three pence whether a Prince or Minister will see us or no: We are not afraid of having ill offices done us, nor are at the trouble of guarding our words for fear of giving offence. I do agree that Riches are Li∣berty, but then we are to put into the balance how long our apprenticeship is to last in ac∣quiring them.</P>
<P>Since you have receiv'd the verses, I most earnestly intreat you to burn those which you

do not approve, and in those few where you may not dislike some parts, blot out the rest, and sometimes (tho' it be against the laziness of your nature) be so kind to make a few cor∣rections, if the matter will bear them. I have some few of those things I call Thoughts moral and diverting; if you please, I will send the best I can pick from them, to add to the new volume. I have reason to chuse the method you mention of mixing the several verses, and I hope thereby among the bad Critics to be entitled to more merit than is my due.</P>
<P>This moment I am so happy to have a let∣ter from my Lord Peterborow, for which I intreat you will present him with my humble respects and thanks, tho' he all-to-be-Gulli∣vers me by very strong insinuations. Though you despise Riddles, I am strongly tempted to send a parcel to be printed by themselves, and make a nine-penny jobb for the bookseller. There are some of my own, wherein I exceed mankind, <HI>Mira Poemata!</HI> the most solemn that were ever seen; and some writ by others, admirable indeed, but far inferior to mine; but I will not praise myself.

<P>MR. Stopford will be the bearer of this let∣ter, for whose acquaintance I am, among many other favours, obliged to you: and I think the acquaintance of so valuable, ingeni∣ous, and unaffected a man, to be none of the least obligations.</P>
<P>Our Miscellany is now quite printed. I am prodigiously pleas'd with this joint-volume, in which methinks we look like friends, side by side, serious and merry by turns, conversing in∣terchangeably, and walking down hand in hand to posterity; not in the stiff forms of learned Authors, flattering each other, and setting the rest of mankind at nought: but in a free, un∣important, natural, easy manner; diverting o∣thers just as we diverted ourselves. The third volume consists of Verses, but I would chuse to print none but such as have some peculiarity, and may be distinguish'd for ours, from other writers. There's no end of making Books, So∣lomon
<PB N="88" REF="106"/>
said, and above all of making Miscella∣nies, which all men can make. For unless there be a character in every piece, like the mark of the Elect, I should not care to be one of the Twelve-thousand signed.</P>
<P>You receiv'd, I hope, some commendatory verses from a Horse and a Lillipputian, to Gulliver; and an heroic Epistle of Mrs. Gul∣liver. The Bookseller would fain have print∣ed 'em before the second Edition of the Book, but I would not permit it without your ap∣probation: nor do I much like them. You see how much like a Poet I write, and yet if you were with us, you'd be deep in Politics. People are very warm, and very angry, very little to the purpose, but therefore the more warm and the more angry: <HI>Non nostrum est, Tantas componere lites.</HI> I stay at Twitnam, without so much as reading news-papers, votes, or any other paltry Pamphlets: Mr. Stopford will carry you a whole parcel of them, which are sent for your diversion, but not imitation. For my own part, methinks I am at Glubdub∣drib with none but ancients and spirits about me.</P>
<P>I am rather better than I use to be at this season, but my hand (tho', as you see, it has not lost its cunning) is frequently in very aukward
<PB N="89" REF="107"/>
sations, rather than pain. But to convince you it is pretty well, it has done some mischief al∣ready, and just been strong enough to cut the other hand, while it was aiming to prune a fruit-tree.</P>
<P>Lady Bolingbroke has writ you a long, lively letter, which will attend this; She has very bad health, he very good. Lord Peterborow has writ twice to you; we fancy some letters have been intercepted, or lost by accident. About ten thousand things I want to tell you: I wish you were as impatient to hear them, for if so, you would, you must come early this spring. Adieu. Let me have a line from you. I am vex'd at losing Mr. Stopford as soon as I knew him: but I thank God I have known him no longer.

<P>IT is a perfect trouble to me to write to you, and your kind letter left for me at Mr. Gay's affected me so much, that it made me like a girl. I can't tell what to say to you; I
<PB N="90" REF="108"/>
only feel that I wish you well in every circum∣stance of life; that 'tis almost as good to be hated as to be loved, considering the pain it is to minds of any tender turn, to find them∣selves so utterly impotent to do any good or give any ease to those who deserve most from us. I would very fain know, as soon as you recover your complaints, or any part of them. Would to God I could ease any of them, or had been able even to have alleviated any! I found I was not, and truly it grieved me. I was sorry to find you could think your∣self easier in any house than in mine, tho' at the same time I can allow for a tenderness in your way of thinking, even when it seem'd to want that tenderness. I can't explain my meaning, perhaps you know it: But the best way of con∣vincing you of my indulgence, will be, if I live, to visit you in Ireland, and act there as much in my own way as you did here in yours. I will not leave your roof, if I am ill. To your bad health I fear there was added some disagree∣able news from Ireland, which might occasion your so sudden departure: For the last time I saw you, you assured me you would not leave us this whole winter, unless your health grew better, and I don't find it did so. I never com∣ply'd so unwillingly in my life with any friend as with you, in staying so intirely from you:
<PB N="91" REF="109"/>
nor could I have had the constancy to do it, if you had not promised that before you went, we shou'd meet, and you would send to us all to come. I have given your remembrances to those you mention in yours: we are quite sorry for you, I mean for ourselves. I hope, as you do, that we shall meet in a more durable and more satisfactory state; but the less sure I am of that, the more I would indulge it in this. We are to believe, we shall have something better than even a friend, there, but certainly here we have nothing so good.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>Oct. 12, 1727.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been long reasoning with myself upon the condition I am in, and in conclusion have thought it best to return to what fortune hath made my home; I have there a large house, and servants and conveniencies about me. I may be worse than I am, and I have
<PB N="92" REF="110"/>
no where to retire. I therefore thought it best to return to Ireland, rather than go to any di∣stant place in England. Here is my maintain∣ance, and here my convenience. If it pleases God to restore me to my health, I shall readi∣ly make a third journey; if not, we must part as all human creatures have parted. You are the best and kindest friend in the world, and I know no-body alive or dead to whom I am so much obliged; and if ever you made me an∣gry, it was for your too much care about me. I have often wish'd that God almighty would be so easy to the weakness of mankind, as to let old friends be acquainted in another state; and if I were to write an Utopia for heaven, that would be one of my schemes. This wild∣ness you must allow for, because I am giddy and deaf.</P>
<P>I find it more convenient to be sick here, without the vexation of making my friends un∣easy; yet my giddiness alone would not have done, if that unsociable comfortless deafness had not quite tired me. And I believe I should have returned from the Inn, if I had not fear∣ed it was only a short intermission, and the year was late, and my licence expiring. Surely besides all other faults, I should be a very ill judge, to doubt your friendship and kindness. But it hath pleased God that you are not in a state
<PB N="93" REF="111"/>
of health, to be mortified with the care and sickness of a friend. Two sick friends never did well together; such an office is fitter for servants and humble companions, to whom it is wholly indifferent whether we give them trouble or no. The case would be quite other∣wise if you were with me; you could refuse to see any body, and here is a large house where we need not hear each other if we were both sick. I have a race of orderly elderly peo∣ple of both sexes at command, who are of no consequence, and have gifts proper for at∣tending us; who can bawl when I am deaf, and tread softly when I am only giddy and would sleep.</P>
<P>I had another reason for my haste hither, which was changing my Agent, the old one having terribly involved my little affairs; to which however I am grown so indifferent, that I believe I shall lose two or three hundred pounds rather than plague myself with ac∣compts; so that I am very well qualified to be a Lord, and put into Peter Walter's hands.</P>
<P>Pray God continue and increase Mr. Con∣greve's amendment, though he does not de∣serve it like you, having been too lavish of that health which Nature gave him.</P>
<P>I hope my Whitehall-landlord is nearer to a place than when I left him; as the Preacher
<PB N="94" REF="112"/>
said, <Q>“the day of judgment was nearer, than ever it had been before.”</Q></P>
<P>Pray God send you health, <HI>det salutem, det opes; animam aequam tibi ipse parabis.</HI> You see Horace wished for money, as well as health; and I would hold a crown he kept a coach; and I shall never be a friend to the Court, till you do so too.</P>

<P>THE first letter I writ after my landing was to Mr. Gay; but it would have been wiser to direct it to Tonson or Lintot, to whom I believe his lodgings are better known than to the runners of the Post-office. In that Letter you will find what a quick change I made in seven days from London to the Deanery, thro' many nations and languages unknown to the civilized world. And I have often reflected in how few hours, with a swift horse or a strong gale, a man may come among a people as un∣known to him as the Antipodes. If I did not know you more by your conversation and kind∣ness
<PB N="95" REF="113"/>
than by your letter, I might be base enough to suspect, that in point of friendship you act∣ed like some Philosophers who writ much bet∣ter upon Virtue than they practised it. In an∣swer, I can only swear that you have taught me to dream, which I had not done in twelve years further than by inexpressible nonsense; but now I can every night distinctly see Twickenham, and the Grotto, and Dawley, and many other et cetera's, and it is but three nights since I beat Mrs. Pope. I must needs confess, that the pleasure I take in thinking on you is very much lessened by the pain I am in about your health: You pay dearly for the great talents God hath given you; and for the consequences of them in the esteem and distinction you re∣ceive from mankind, unless you can provide a tolerable stock of health; in which pursuit I cannot much commend your conduct, but ra∣ther entreat you would mend it by following the advice of my Lord Bolingbroke and your other Physicians. When you talk'd of Cups and Impressions, it came into my head to imi∣tate you in quoting Scripture, not to your ad∣vantage; I mean what was said to David by one of his brothers: <Q>“I knew thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart;”</Q> I remember when it grieved your soul to see me pay a pen∣ny more than my club at an inn, when you
<PB N="96" REF="114"/>
had maintained me three months at bed and board; for which if I had dealt with you in the Smithfield way it would have cost me a hundred pounds, for I live worse here upon more. Did you ever consider that I am for life almost twice as rich as you, and pay no rent, and drink French wine twice as cheap as you do Port, and have neither Coach, Chair, nor mother? As to the world, I think you ought to say to it with St. Paul, <HI>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</HI> This is more proper still, if you consider the French word <HI>spiritual,</HI> in which sense the world ought to pay you better than they do. If you made me a present of a thousand pound, I would not al∣low myself to be in your debt; and if I made you a present of two, I would not allow my∣self to be out of it. But I have not half your pride: witness what Mr. Gay says in his letter, that I was censured for begging Presents, tho' I limited them to ten shillings. I see no reason, (at least my friendship and vanity see none) why you should not give me a visit, when you shall happen to be disengaged: I will send a person to Chester to take care of you, and you shall be used by the best folks we have here, as well as civility and good-nature can contrive; I be∣lieve local motion will be no ill physic, and I
<PB N="97" REF="115"/>
will have your coming inscribed on my Tomb, and recorded in never-dying verse.</P>
<P>I thank Mrs. Pope for her prayers, but I know the mystery. A person of my acquaint∣ance, who used to correspond with the last Great Duke of Tuscany, shewing one of the Duke's letters to a friend, and professing great sense of his Highness's friendship, read this passage out of the letters, <HI>I would give one of my fingers to procure your real good.</HI> The Person to whom this was read, and who knew the Duke well, said, the meaning of <HI>real good</HI> was only that the other might turn a good Catholic. Pray ask Mrs. Pope whether this story is applicable to her and me? I pray God bless her, for I am sure she is a good Christian, and (which is al∣most as rare) a good Woman.</P>

<P>I Entirely approve your refusal of that em∣ployment, and your writing to the Queen. I am perfectly confident you have a keen enemy in the Ministry. God forgive him, but not till he puts himself in a state to be forgiven. Upon reasoning with myself, I should hope they are gone too far to discard you quite, and that they will give you something; which, al∣though much less than they ought, will be (as far as it is worth) better circumstantiated: And since you already just live, a middling help will make you just tolerable. Your lateness in life (as you so soon call it) might be improper to be∣gin the world with, but almost the eldest men
<PB N="100" REF="118"/>
may hope to see changes in a Court. A Mi∣nister is always seventy: You are thirty years younger; and consider, Cromwel himself did not begin to appear till he was older than you. I beg you will be thrifty, and learn to value a shilling, which Dr. Birch said was a serious thing. Get a stronger fence about your 1000<HI>l.</HI> and throw the inner fence into the heap, and be advised by your Twickenham landlord and me about an annuity. You are the most re∣fractory, honest, good-natur'd man I ever have known; I could argue out this paper—I am very glad your Opera is finished, and hope your friends will join the readier to make it succeed, because you are ill-used by others.</P>
<P>I have known Courts these thirty-six years, and know they differ; but in some things they are extremely constant: First, in the trite old maxim of a Minister's never forgiving those he hath injured; Secondly, in the insincerity of those who would be thought the best friends: Thirdly, in the love of fawning, cringing, and tale-bearing: Fourthly, in sa∣crificing those whom we really wish well, to a point of interest, or intrigue: Fifthly, in keep∣ing every thing worth taking, for those who can do service or dis-service.</P>
<P>Now why does not Pope publish his dul∣ness? the rogues he marks will die of them∣selves

Have you dedicated your Opera, and got the usual dedication-fee of twenty guineas? How is the Doctor? does he not chide that you ne∣ver called upon him for hints? Is my Lord Bo∣lingbroke at the moment I am writing, a planter, a philosopher, or a writer? Is Mr. Pultney in expectation of a son, or my Lord Oxford of a new old Manuscript?</P>

<P>POPE charges himself with this letter; he has been here two days, he is now hur∣rying to London, he will hurry back to Twick∣enham in two days more, and before the end of the week he will be, for ought I know, at
<PB N="104" REF="122"/>
Dublin. In the mean time his<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Dunciad.</NOTE> <HI>Dulness</HI> grows and flourishes as if he was there already. It will indeed be a noble work: the many will stare at it, the few will smile, and all his Pa∣trons from Bickerstaff to Gulliver will rejoice, to see themselves adorn'd in that immortal piece.</P>
<P>I hear that you have had some return of your illness which carried you so suddenly from us (if indeed it was your own illness which made you in such haste to be at Dublin.) Dear Swift take care of your health, I'll give you a receipt for it, <HI>à la Montagne,</HI> or which is better, <HI>à la Bruyere. Nourisser bien vôtre corps; ne le fatiguer jamais: laisser rouiller l'ésprit, meuble inutil, voire outil dangereux: Laisser sonner vos cloches le matin pour eveiller les cha∣noines, et pour faire dormir le Deyen d'un som∣meil doux et profond, qui luy procure de beaux songes: Lever vous tard, et aller à l'Eglise, pour vous faire payer d'avoir bien dormi et bien de∣jeuné.</HI> As to myself (a person about whom I concern myself very little) I must say a word or two out of complaisance to you.

<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. According to Lord Bolingbroke's ac∣count I shall be at Dublin in three days. I cannot help adding a word, to desire you to expect my soul there with you by that time; but as for the jade of a body that is tack'd to it, I fear there will be no dragging it after. I assure you I have few friends here to detain me, and no powerful one at Court absolutely to forbid my journey. I am told the Gyno∣cracy are of opinion, that they want to better writers than Cibber and the British journalist; so that we may live at quiet, and apply ourselves to our more abstruse studies. The only Cour∣tiers I know, or have the honour to call my friends, are John Gay and Mr. Bowry; the former is at present so employed in the ele∣vated airs of his Opera, and the latter in the exaltation of his high dignity (that of her Ma∣jesty's Waterman) that I can scarce obtain a categorical answer from either to any thing I say to 'em. But the Opera succeeds extreme∣ly, to yours and my extreme satisfaction, of which he promises this post to give you a full

account. I have been in a worse condition of health than ever, and think my immortality is very near out of my enjoyment: so it must be in you, and in posterity, to make me what amends you can for dying young. Adieu. While I am, I am yours. Pray love me, and take care of yourself.</P>

<P>I Send you a very odd thing, a paper printed in Boston in New-England, wherein you'll find a real person, a member of their Parlia∣ment, of the name of Jonathan Gulliver. If the fame of that Traveller has travel'd thither, it has travel'd very quick, to have folks christ∣en'd already by the name of the supposed Au∣thor. But if you object, that no child so late∣ly christen'd could be arrived at years of matu∣rity to be elected into Parliament, I reply (to solve the Riddle) that the person is an <HI>Anabap∣tist,</HI> and not christen'd till full age, which sets all right.

Mr. Gay's Opera has been acted near forty days running, and will certainly continue the whole season. So he has more than a fence about his thousand pound <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Before Mr. Gay had <HI>fenced</HI> this thousand pounds, he had a consultation with his friends about the disposal of it. Mr. L. advised him to intrust it to the funds, and live upon the interest: Dr. Arbuthnot, to intrust it to Providence, and live upon the principal; and Mr. Pope was for purchasing an an∣nuity for life. In this un∣certainty he could only say with the old man in Te∣rence, <HI>fecistis probe:</HI>
<Q><L>Incertior sum multo, quam dudum.</L></Q></NOTE>: he'll soon be thinking of a fence about his two thousand. Shall no one of us live as we would wish each other to live? Shall he have no annuity, you no settlement on this side, and I no prospect of getting to you on the other? This world is made for Caesar—as Cato said, for ambitious, false, or flatter∣ing people to domineer in: Nay they would not, by their good will, leave us our very books, thoughts, or words, in quiet. I despise the world yet, I assure you, more than either Gay or you, and the Court more than all the rest of the world. As for those Scriblers for whom you apprehend I would suppress my <HI>Dulness</HI> (which by the way, for the future, you are to call by a more pompous name, <HI>The Dunceiad)</HI> how much that nest of Hornets are my regard,

<P>At all adventures, yours and my name shall stand linked as friends to posterity, both in verse and prose, and (as Tully calls it) in <HI>consuetu∣dine Studiorum.</HI> Would to God our persons could but as well, and as surely, be insepara∣ble! I find my other Tyes dropping from me: some worn off, some torn off, others relaxing daily: My greatest, both by duty, gratitude, and humanity, Time is shaking every moment, and it now hangs but by a thread! I am many years the older, for living so much with one so old; much the more helpless, for having been so long help'd and tended by her; much the more considerate and tender, for a daily commerce with one who requir'd me justly to be both to her; and consequently the more melancholy and thoughtful; and the less fit for others, who want only in a companion or a friend, to be amused or entertained. My con∣stitution too has had its share of decay, as well as my spirits, and I am as much in the decline at forty as you at sixty. I believe we should be fit to live together, cou'd I get a little more health, which might make me not quite insup∣portable: Your Deafness wou'd agree with my Dulness; you would not want me to speak when
<PB N="109" REF="127"/>
you could not hear. But God forbid you shou'd be as destitute of the social comforts of life, as I must when I lose my mother; or that ever you shou'd lose your more useful acquaintance so utterly, as to turn your thoughts to such a broken reed as I am, who could so ill supply your wants. I am extremely troubled at the returns of your deafness; you cannot be too particular in the accounts of your health to me; every thing you do or say in this kind obliges me, nay, delights me, to see the justice you do me in thinking me concern'd in all your con∣cerns; so that though the pleasantest thing you can tell me be that you are better or easier; next to that it pleases me, that you make me the person you would complain to.</P>
<P>As the obtaining the love of valuable men is the happiest end I know of this life, so the next felicity is to get rid of fools and scoun∣drels; which I can't but own to you was one part of my design in falling upon these Au∣thors, whose incapacity is not greater than their insincerity, and of whom I have always found (if I may quote myself)

<P>I Have with great pleasure shewn the New-England News-paper with the two names Jonathan Gulliver, and I remember Mr. For∣tescue sent you an account from the assizes, of one Lemuel Gulliver who had a Cause there, and lost it on his ill reputation of being a liar. These are not the only observations I have made upon odd strange accidents in trifles, which in things of great importance would have been matter for Historians. Mr. Gay's Opera hath been acted here twenty times, and my Lord Lieutenant tells me, it is very well per∣form'd; he hath seen it often, and approves it much.</P>
<P>You give a most melancholy account of yourself, and which I do not approve. I reckon
<PB N="111" REF="129"/>
that a man subject like us to bodily infir∣mities, should only occasionally converse with great people, notwithstanding all their good qualities, easinesses, and kindnesses. There is another race which I prefer before them, as Beef and Mutton for constant diet before Par∣tridges: I mean a middle kind both for under∣standing and fortune, who are perfectly easy, never impertinent, complying in every thing, ready to do a hundred little offices that you and I may often want, who dine and sit with me five times for once that I go to them, and whom I can tell without offence, that I am otherwise engaged at present. This you can∣not expect from any of those that either you or I or both are acquainted with on your side; who are only fit for our healthy seasons, and have much business of their own. God forbid I should condemn you to Ireland <HI>(Quanquam O!)</HI> and for England I despair; and indeed a change of affairs would come too late at my season of life, and might probably produce nothing on my behalf. You have kept Mrs. Pope longer, and have had her care beyond what from na∣ture you could expect; not but her loss will be very sensible, whenever it shall happen. I say one thing, that both summers and winters are milder here than with you; all things for life in general better for a middling fortune: you
<PB N="112" REF="130"/>
will have an absolute command of your com∣pany, with whatever obsequiousness or freedom you may expect or allow. I have an elderly house-keeper, who hath been my <HI>W-lp-le</HI> above thirty years, whenever I liv'd in this kingdom. I have the command of one or two villa's near this town: You have a warm apartment in this house, and two gardens for amusement. I have said enough, yet not half. Except absence from friends, I confess freely that I have no discontent at living here; besides what arises from a silly spirit of Liberty, which as it nei∣ther sours my drink, nor hurts my meat, nor spoils my stomach farther than in imagination, so I resolve to throw it off.</P>
<P>You talk of this Dunciad, but I am impa∣tient to have it <HI>volare per ora</HI>—there is now a vacancy for fame; the Beggar's Opera hath done its task, <HI>discedat uti conviva satur.</HI></P>

<P>I Look upon my Lord Bolingbroke and us two, as a peculiar Triumvirate, who have
<PB N="113" REF="131"/>
nothing to expect, or to fear; and so far fittest to converse with one another: Only he and I are a little subject to schemes, and one of us (I won't say which) upon very weak appear∣ances, and this you have nothing to do with. I do profess without affectation, that your kind opinion of me as a Patriot (since you call it so) is what I do not deserve; because what I do is owing to perfect rage and resentment, and the mortifying sight of slavery, folly, and baseness about me, among which I'm forc'd to live. And I will take my oath that you have more Virtue in an hour, than I in seven years; for you despise the follies, and hate the vices of mankind, without the least ill effect on your temper; and with regard to particular men, you are inclined always rather to think the bet∣ter, whereas with me it is always directly con∣trary. I hope however, this is not in you from a superior principle of virtue, but from your situation, which hath made all parties and in∣terests indifferent to you, who can be under no concern about high and low-church, Whig and Tory, or who is first Minister—Your long let∣ter was the last I receiv'd till this by Dr. Delany, although you mention another since. The Dr. told me your secret about the Dunciad, which does not please me, because it defers gratifying my vanity in the most tender point, and per∣haps
<PB N="114" REF="132"/>
may wholly disappoint it. As to one of your enquiries, I am easy enough in great mat∣ters, and have a thousand paltry vexations in my little station, and the more contemptible, the more vexatious. There might be a Lutrin writ upon the tricks used by my Chapter to teize me. I do not converse with one creature of Station or Title, but I have a sett of easy people whom I entertain when I have a mind; I have formerly describ'd them to you, but, when you come, you shall have the honours of the country as much as you please, and I shall on that account make a better figure, as long as I live. Pray God preserve Mrs. Pope for your sake and ease, I love and esteem her too much to wish it for her own: If I were five and twenty, I would wish to be of her age, to be as secure as she is of a better life. Mrs. P. B. has writ to me, and is one of the best Letter-writers I know; very good sense, civi∣lity and friendship, without any stiffness or con∣straint. The Dunciad has taken wind here, but if it had not, you are as much known here as in England, and the University-lads will crowd to kiss the hem of your garment. I am griev'd to hear that my Lord Bolingbroke's ill health forc'd him to the Bath. Tell me, is not Temperance a necessary virtue for great men, since it is the parent of Ease and Liberty?
<PB N="115" REF="133"/>
so necessary for the use and improvement of the mind, and which Philosophy allows to be the greatest felicities of life? I believe, had health been given so liberally to you, it would have been better husbanded without shame to your parts.</P>

<P>I Now hold the pen for my Lord Bolingbroke, who is reading your letter between two Hay∣cocks; but his attention is somewhat diverted by casting his eyes on the clouds, not in admi∣ration of what you say, but for fear of a shower. He is pleas'd with your placing him in the Triumvirate between yourself and me; tho' he says that he doubts he shall fare like Lepidus, while one of us runs away with all the power like Augustus, and another with all the plea∣sures like Anthony. It is upon a foresight of this, that he has fitted up his farm, and you will agree, that this scheme of retreat at least is not founded upon weak appearances. Upon his return from the Bath, all peccant humours, he finds, are purg'd out of him; and his great Temperance and Oeconomy are so signal, that the first is fit for my constitution, and the lat∣ter
<PB N="116" REF="134"/>
would enable you to lay up so much mo∣ney as to buy a Bishoprick in England. As to the return of his health and vigour, were you here, you might enquire of his Hay-makers; but as to his temperance, I can answer that (for one whole day) we have had nothing for dinner but mutton-broth, beans and bacon, and a Barn-door fowl.</P>
<P>Now his Lordship is run after his Cart, I have a moment left to myself to tell you, that I over-heard him yesterday agree with a Pain∣ter for 200 <HI>l.</HI> to paint his country-hall with Trophies of Rakes, spades, prongs, &amp;c. and other ornaments merely to countenance his cal∣ling this place a Farm—now turn over a new leaf—</P>
<P>He bids me assure you, he should be sorry not to have more schemes of kindness for his friends, than of ambition for himself: There, tho' his schemes may be weak, the motives at least are strong; and he says further, if you could bear as great a fall, and decrease of your revenues, as he knows by experience he can, you wou'd not live in Ireland an hour.</P>
<P>The Dunciad is going to be printed in all pomp, with the inscription, which makes me proudest. It will be attended with <HI>Proeme, Prolegomena, Testimonia Scriptorum, Index Au∣thorum,</HI> and Notes <HI>Variorum.</HI> As to the latter,

<P>I Have often run over the <HI>Dunciad</HI> in an Irish edition (I suppose full of faults) which a gentleman sent me. The notes I could wish to be very large, in what relates to the persons concern'd; for I have long observ'd that twen∣ty miles from London no-body understands hints, initial letters, or town-facts and pas∣sages; and in a few years not even those who
<PB N="118" REF="136"/>
live in London. I would have the names of those scriblers printed indexically at the begin∣ning or end of the Poem, with an account of their works, for the reader to refer to. I would have all the Parodies (as they are call'd) re∣ferred to the author they imitate—When I be∣gan this long paper, I thought I should have fill'd it with setting down the several passages I had mark'd in the edition I had; but I find it unnecessary, so many of them falling under the same rule. After twenty times reading the whole, I never in my opinion saw so much good satire, or more good sense, in so many lines. How it passes in Dublin I know not yet; but I am sure it will be a great disadvantage to the poem, that the persons and facts will not be understood, till an explanation comes out, and a very full one. I imagine it is not to be pub∣lished till towards winter, when folks begin to gather in town. Again I insist, you must have your Asterisks fill'd up with some real names of real Dunces.</P>
<P>I am now reading your preceding letter, of June 28, and find that all I have advis'd above is mention'd there. I would be glad to know whether the quarto edition is to come out ano∣nymously, as published by the Commentator, with all his pomp of presaces, &amp;c. and among many complaints of spurious editions? I am
<PB N="119" REF="137"/>
thinking whether the Editor should not follow the old style of, This excellent author, &amp;c. and refine in many places when you meant no refinement; and into the bargain take all the load of naming the dunces, their qualities, his∣tories, and performances?</P>
<P>As to your self, I doubt you want a spurrer∣on to exercise and to amusements; but to talk of decay at your season of life is a jest. But you are not so regular as I. You are the most tem∣perate man God-ward, and the most intem∣perate your self-ward, of most I have known. I suppose Mr. Gay will return from the Bath with twenty pounds more flesh, and two hundred less in money: Providence never design'd him to be above two and twenty, by his thoughtlessness and Cullibility. He hath as little foresight of age, sickness, poverty, or loss of admirers, as a girl at fifteen. By the way, I must observe, that my Lord Bolingbroke (from the effects of his kindness to me) argues most sophistically: The fall from a million to an hundred-thou∣sand pounds is not so great, as from eight hun∣dred pounds a year to one: Besides, he is a controller of Fortune, and Poverty dares not look a great Minister in the face, under his low∣est declension. I never knew him live so great and expensively as he hath done since his re∣turn from Exile; such mortals have resources
<PB N="120" REF="138"/>
that others are not able to comprehend. But God bless You, whose great genius has not so transported you as to leave you to the courtesy of mankind; for wealth is liberty, and liberty is a blessing fittest for a Philosopher—and Gay is a Slave just by two thousand pounds too lit∣tle.—And Horace was of my mind, and let my Lord contradict him, if he dares.—</P>

<P>I Have past six weeks in quest of health, and found it not; but I found the folly of sol∣licitude about it in a hundred instances; the contrariety of opinions and practices, the inabi∣lity of physicians, the blind obedience of some patients, and as blind rebellion of others. I be∣lieve at a certain time of life, men are either fools, or physicians for themselves, and zealots, or divines for themselves.</P>
<P>It was much in my hopes that you intended us a winter's visit, but last week I repented that wish, having been alarm'd with a report of your lying ill on the road from Ireland; from which I am just reliev'd by an assurance that you are still at Sir A—'s planting and building; two things that I envy you for, besides a third,
<PB N="121" REF="139"/>
which is the society of a valuable Lady. I conclude (tho' I know nothing of it) that you quarrel with her, and abuse her every day, if she is so. I wonder I hear of no Lampoons upon her, either made by yourself, or by others, because you esteem her. I think it a vast plea∣sure that whenever two people of merit regard one another, so many scroundrels envy and are angry at them; 'tis bearing testimony to a me∣rit they cannot reach; and if you knew the infinite content I have receiv'd of late, at the finding yours and my name constantly united in any silly scandal, I think you would go near to sing <HI>Io Triumphe!</HI> and celebrate my happiness in verse; and, I believe, if you won't, I shall. The inscription to the Dunciad is now printed and inserted in the Poem. Do you care I should say any thing farther how much that poem is yours? since certainly without you it had never been. Would to God we were together for the rest of our lives! The whole weight of Scriblers would just serve to find us amusement, and not more. I hope you are too well em∣ployed to mind them: every stick you plant, and every stone you lay, is to some purpose; but the business of such lives as theirs is but to die daily, to labour, and raise nothing. I only wish we could comfort each other under our bodily infirmities, and let those who have so
<PB N="122" REF="140"/>
great a mind to have more Wit than we, win it and wear it. Give us but ease, health, peace, and fair weather! I think it is the best wish in the world, and you know whose it was. If I liv'd in Ireland, I fear the wet climate wou'd indanger more than my life; my humour, and health; I am so Atmospherical a creature.</P>
<P>I must not omit acquainting you, that what you heard of the words spoken of you in the Drawing-room, was not true. The sayings of Princes are generally as ill related as the sayings of Wits. To such reports little of our regard should be given, and less of our conduct in∣fluenc'd by them.</P>

<P>I Liv'd very easily in the country: Sir A. is a man of sense, and a scholar, has a good voice, and my Lady a better; she is perfectly well bred, and desirous to improve her under∣standing, which is very good, but cultivated too much like a fine Lady. She was my pu∣pil there, and severely chid when she read wrong; with that, and walking, and making

twenty little amusing improvements, and writ∣ing family verses of mirth by way of libels on my Lady, my time past very well and in very great order; infinitely better than here, where I see no creature but my servants and my old Presbyterian house-keeper, denying myself to every body, till I shall recover my ears.</P>
<P>The account of another Lord Lieutenant was only in a common news-paper, when I was in the country; and if it should have hap∣pen'd to be true, I would have desired to have had access to him as the situation I am in re∣quires. But this renews the grief for the death of our friend Mr. Congreve, whom I loved from my youth, and who surely, besides his other talents, was a very agreeable companion. He had the misfortune to squander away a ve∣ry good constitution in his younger days; and I think a man of sense and merit like him, is bound in conscience to preserve his health for the sake of his friends, as well as of himself. Upon his own account I could not much desire the continuance of his life, under so much pain, and so many infirmities. Years have not yet hardened me; and I have an addition of weight on my spirits since we lost him; tho' I saw him so seldom, and possibly, if he had liv'd on, should never have seen him more. I do not only wish as you ask me, that I was unac∣quainted

Here is an ingeni∣ous good-humour'd Physician, a fine gentle∣man, an excellent scholar, easy in his fortunes, kind to every body, hath abundance of friends, entertains them often and liberally, they pass the evening with him at cards, with plenty of good meat and wine, eight or a dozen together; he loves them all, and they him. He has twen∣ty of these at command; if one of them dies, it is no more than poor Tom! he gets another, or takes up with the rest, and is no more mov'd than at the loss of his cat; he offends no-body, is easy with every body—Is not this the true happy man? I was describing him to my La∣dy A—, who knows him too, but she hates him mortally by my character, and will not drink his health: I would give half my fortune for the same temper, and yet I cannot say I love it, for I do not love my Lord—who is much of the Doctor's nature. I hear Mr. Gay's se∣cond Opera, which you mention, is forbid; and then he will be once more fit to be advis∣ed, and reject your advice.</P>

<P>YOU tell me you have not quitted the de∣sign of collecting, writing, &amp;c. This is the answer of every sinner who defers his re∣pentance. I wish Mr. Pope were as great an urger as I, who long for nothing more than to see truth under your hands, laying all detraction in the dust—I find myself disposed every year, or rather every month, to be more angry and revengeful; and my rage is so ignoble, that it descends even to resent the folly and baseness of the enslav'd people among whom I live. I knew an old Lord in Leicestershire, who amused himself with mending pitchforks and spades for his Tenants <HI>gratis.</HI> Yet I have higher ideas left, if I were nearer to objects on which I might employ them; and contemning my private fortune, would gladly cross the channel and stand by, while my betters were driving the Boars out of the garden, if there be any probable expectation of such an endeavour. When I was of your age I often thought of death, but now after a dozen years more, it is never out of my mind, and terrifies me less. I
<PB N="126" REF="144"/>
conclude that Providence hath order'd our fears to decrease with our spirits; and yet I love <HI>la bagatelle</HI> better than ever: for finding it trou∣blesome to read at night, and the company here growing tasteless, I am always writing bad prose, or worse verses, either of rage or raillery, whereof some few escape to give of∣fence, or mirth, and the rest are burnt.</P>
<P>They print some Irish trash in London, and charge it on me, which you will clear me of to my friends, for all are spurious except one<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Entituled,</HI> A Libel on Dr. Delany, and a certain great Lord.</NOTE> paper, for which Mr. Pope very lately chid me. I remember your Lordship us'd to say, that a few good speakers would in time carry any point that was right; and that the common method of a majority, by calling, To the ques∣tion, would never hold long when reason was on the other side. Whether politics do not change like gaming by the invention of new tricks, I am ignorant? but I believe in your time you would never, as a Minister, have suf∣fer'd an Act to pass thro' the H. of C—s, only because you were sure of a majority in the H. of L—s to throw it out; because it would be unpopular, and consequently a loss of reputation. Yet this we are told hath been the case in the qualification-bill relating to Pen∣sioners.
<PB N="127" REF="145"/>
It should seem to me, that Corrup∣tion, like avarice, hath no bounds. I had op∣portunities to know the proceedings of your ministry better than any other man of my rank; and having not much to do, I have of∣ten compar'd it with these last sixteen years of a profound peace all over Europe, and we run∣ning seven millions in debt. I am forc'd to play at small game, to set the beasts here a madding, meerly for want of better game, <HI>Tentanda via est qua me quoque possim,</HI> &amp;c.—The D—take those politics, where a Dunce might govern for a dozen years together. I will come in person to England, if I am pro∣vok'd, and send for the Dictator from the plough. I disdain to say, <HI>O mihi praeteritos</HI>—but <HI>cruda deo viridisque senectus.</HI> Pray, my Lord, how are the Gardens? have you taken down the mount, and remov'd the yew hedges? Have you not bad weather for the spring-corn? Has Mr. Pope gone farther in his Ethic Poems? and is the head-land sown with wheat? and what says Polybius? and how does my Lord St. John? which last question is very material to me, because I love Burgun∣dy, and riding between Twickenham and Dawley.—I built a wall five years ago, and when the masons play'd the knaves, nothing delighted me so much as to stand by, while my
<PB N="128" REF="146"/>
servants threw down what was amiss: I have likewise seen a Monkey overthrow all the dishes and plates in a kitchen, merely for the pleasure of seeing them tumble and hearing the clatter they made in their fall. I wish you would in∣vite me to such another entertainment; but you think, as I ought to think, that it is time for me to have done with the world, and so I would if I could get into a better before I was called into the best, and not die here in a rage, like a poison'd rat in a hole. I wonder you are not ashamed to let me pine away in this kingdom while you are out of power.</P>
<P>I come from looking over the <HI>Melange</HI> above-written, and declare it to be a true co∣py of my present disposition, which must needs please you, since nothing was ever more dis∣pleasing to myself. I desire you to present my most humble respects to my Lady.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>April 5, 1729.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Do not think it could be possible for me to hear better news than that of your getting over your scurvy suit, which always hung as a
<PB N="129" REF="147"/>
dead weight on my heart; I hated it in all its circumstances, as it affected your fortune and quiet, and in a situation of life that must make it every way vexatious. And as I am infinitely obliged to you for the justice you do me in supposing your affairs do at least concern me as much as my own; so I would never have par∣doned your omitting it. But before I go on, I cannot forbear mentioning what I read last summer in a news-paper, that you were writ∣ing the history of your own times. I suppose such a report might arise from what was not secret among your friends, of your intention to write another kind of history; which you often promis'd Mr. Pope and me to do: I know he desires it very much, and I am sure I desire nothing more, for the honour and love I bear you, and the perfect knowledge I have of your public virtue. My Lord, I have no other notion of Oeconomy than that it is the parent of Liberty and Ease, and I am not the only friend you have who hath chid you in his heart for the neglect of it, tho' not with his mouth, as I have done. For there is a silly error in the world, even among friends other∣wise very good, not to intermeddle with mens affairs in such nice matters. And, my Lord, I have made a maxim, that should be writ in letters of diamonds, That a wise man ought to
<PB N="130" REF="148"/>
have Mony in his head, but not in his heart. Pray, my Lord, enquire whether your Proto∣type, my Lord Digby, after the Restoration when he was at Bristol, did not take some care of his fortune, notwithstanding that quotation I once sent you out of his speech to the H. of Commons? In my conscience, I believe For∣tune, like other drabbs, values a man gradually less for every year he lives. I have demonstra∣tion for it; because if I play at piquet for six∣pence with a man or a woman two years younger than myself, I always lose; and there is a young girl of twenty, who never fails of winning my mony at Back-gammon, tho' she is a bungler, and the game be Ecclesiastic. As to the public, I confess nothing could cure my itch of medling with it but these frequent re∣turns of deafness, which have hindred me from passing last winter in London; yet I can∣not but consider the perfidiousness of some people, who I thought when I was last there, upon a change that happened, were the most impudent in forgetting their professions that I have ever known. Pray, will you please to take your pen, and blot me out that political maxim from whatever book it is in, that <HI>Res nolunt diu male administrari;</HI> the commonness makes me not know who is the author, but sure he must be some Modern.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="149"/>
I am sorry for Lady Bolingbroke's ill health; but I protest I never knew a very deserving person of that sex, who had not too much rea∣son to complain of ill health. I never wake without finding life a more insignificant thing than it was the day before: which is one great advantage I get by living in this country, where there is nothing I shall be sorry to lose. But my greatest misery is recollecting the scene of twenty years past, and then all on a sudden dropping into the present. I remember, when I was a little boy, I felt a great fish at the end of my line, which I drew up almost on the ground, but it dropt in, and the disappoint∣ment vexes me to this very day, and, I believe, it was the type of all my future disappoint∣ments. I should be asham'd to say this to you, if you had not a spirit fitter to bear your own misfortunes, than I have to think of them. Is there patience left to reflect, by what qualities wealth and greatness are got, and by what qualities they are lost? I have read my friend Congreve's verses to Lord Cob∣ham, which end with a vile and false moral, and I remember is not in Horace to Tibullus, which he imitates, <Q>“that all times are equally virtuous and vicious,”</Q> wherein he differs from all Poets, Philosophers, and Christians that ever writ. It is more probable that there
<PB N="132" REF="150"/>
may be an equal quantity of virtues always in the world, but sometimes there may be a peck of it in Asia, and hardly a thimble-full in Eu∣rope. But if there be no virtue, there is abund∣ance of sincerity; for I will venture all I am worth, that there is not one humane creature in power, who will not be modest enough to con∣fess that he proceeds wholly upon a principle of Corruption. I say this, because I have a scheme in spite of your notions, to govern England upon the principles of Virtue, and when the nation is ripe for it, I desire you will send for me. I have learn'd this by liv∣ing like a Hermit, by which I am got back∣wards about nineteen hundred years in the Aera of the world, and begin to wonder at the wickedness of men. I dine alone upon half a dish of meat, mix water with my wine, walk ten miles a day, and read Baronius. <HI>Hic ex∣plicit Epistola ad Dom.</HI> Bolingbroke, <HI>et incipit ad amicum</HI> Pope.</P>
<P>Having finished my Letter to Aristippus, I now begin to you. I was in great pain about Mrs. Pope, having heard from others that she was in a very dangerous way, which made me think it unseasonable to trouble you. I am ashamed to tell you, that when I was very young I had more desire to be famous than
<PB N="133" REF="151"/>
ever since; and fame, like all things else in this life, grows with me every day more a tri∣fle. But you who are so much younger, al∣though you want that health you deserve, yet your spirits are as vigorous as if your body were sounder. I hate a crowd, where I have not an easy place to see and be seen. A great Library always makes me melancholy, where the best Author is as much squeezed, and as obscure, as a Porter at a Coronation. In my own little library, I value the compilements of Graevius and Gronovius, which make thirty∣one volumes in folio (and were given me by my Lord Bolingbroke) more than all my books besides; because whoever comes into my clo∣set, casts his eyes immediately upon them, and will not vouchsafe to look upon Plato or Xe∣nophon. I tell you it is almost incredible how Opinions change by the decline or decay of spirits, and I will further tell you, that all my endeavours, from a boy to distinguish myself, were only for want of a great Title and For∣tune, that I might be used like a Lord by those who have an opinion of my parts; whether right or wrong, it is no great matter; and so the reputation of wit or great learning does the office of a blue ribband, or of a coach and six horses. To be remembred for ever on the ac∣count of our friendship, is what would exceed∣ingly
<PB N="134" REF="152"/>
please me; but yet I never lov'd to make a visit, or be seen walking with my betters, be∣cause they get all the eyes and civilities from me. I no sooner writ this than I corrected my∣self, and remember'd Sir Fulk Grevil's Epi∣taph, <Q>“Here lies, &amp;c. who was friend to Sir Philip Sidney.”</Q> And therefore I most heartily thank you for your desire that I would record our friendship in verse, which if I can succeed in, I will never desire to write one more line in poetry while I live. You must present my humble service to Mrs. Pope, and let her know I pray for her continuance in the world, for her own reason, that she may live to take care of you.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Dr. SWIFT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Aug. 11, 1729.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very sensible that in a former letter I talked very weakly of my own affairs, and of my imperfect wishes and desires, which however I find with some comfort do now daily decline, very suitable to my state of health for some months past. For my head is never perfectly free from giddiness, and es∣pecially towards night. Yet my disorder is
<PB N="135" REF="153"/>
very moderate, and I have been without a fit of deafness this half year; so I am like a horse, which, though off his mettle, can trot on tole∣rably; and this comparison puts me in mind to add, that I am returned to be a rider, where∣in I wish you would imitate me. As to this country, there have been three terrible years dearth of corn, and every place strowed with beggars; but dearths are common in better cli∣mates, and our evils here lie much deeper. Imagine a nation the two thirds of whose re∣venues are spent out of it, and who are not permitted to trade with the other third, and where the pride of women will not suffer them to wear their own manufactures even where they excel what come from abroad: This is the true state of Ireland in a very few words. These evils operate more every day, and the kingdom is absolutely undone, as I have been telling often in print these ten years past.</P>
<P>What I have said requires forgiveness, but I had a mind for once to let you know the state of our affairs, and my reason for being more moved than perhaps becomes a Clergyman, and a piece of a Philosopher: and perhaps the increase of years and disorders may hope for some allowance to complaints, especially when I may call myself a stranger in a strange land. As to poor Mrs. Pope (if she be still alive) I
<PB N="136" REF="154"/>
heartily pity you and pity her: her great piety and virtue will infallibly make her happy in a better life, and her great age hath made her ful∣ly ripe for heaven and the grave, and her best friends will most wish her eased of her labours, when she hath so many good works to follow them. The loss you will feel by the want of her care and kindness, I know very well; but she has amply done her part, as you have yours. One reason why I would have you in Ireland when you shall be at your own disposal, is that you may be master of two or three years reve∣nues, <HI>provisae frugis in annos copia,</HI> so as not to be pinch'd in the least when years increase, and perhaps your health impairs: And when this kingdom is utterly at an end, you may support me for the few years I shall happen to live; and who knows but you may pay me exorbitant interest for the spoonful of wine, and scraps of a chicken it will cost me to feed you? I am confident you have too much rea∣son to complain of ingratitude; for I never yet knew any person, one tenth part, so heartily dis∣posed as you are, to do good offices to others, without the least private view.</P>
<P>Was it a Gasconade to please me, that you said your fortune was increased 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year since I left you? you should have told me how. Those <HI>subsidia senectuti</HI> are extremely
<PB N="137" REF="155"/>
desirable, if they could be got with justice, and without avarice; of which vice tho' I can∣not charge myself yet, nor feel any approaches towards it, yet no usurer more wishes to be richer (or rather to be surer of his rents.) But I am not half so moderate as you, for I de∣clare I cannot live easily under double to what you are satisfied with.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. Gay will keep his 3000<HI>l.</HI> and live on the interest without decreasing the prin∣cipal one penny; but I do not like your sel∣dom seeing him. I hope he is grown more disengaged from his intentness on his own af∣fairs, which I ever disliked, and is quite the reverse to you, unless you are a very dextrous disguiser. I desire my humble service to Lord Oxford, Lord Bathurst, and particularly to Mrs. B—, but to no Lady at court. God bless you for being a greater Dupe than I: I love that character too myself, but I want your charity.</P>

<P>IT pleases me that you received my books at last: but you have never once told me if you approve the whole, or disapprove not of
<PB N="138" REF="156"/>
some parts, of the Commentary, &amp;c. It was my principal aim in the entire work to perpe∣tuate the friendship between us, and to shew that the friends or the enemies of one were the friends or enemies of the other: If in any particular, any thing be stated or mention'd in a different manner from what you like, pray tell me freely, that the new Editions now coming out here, may have it rectify'd. You'll find the octavo rather more correct than the quarto, with some additions to the Notes and Epigrams cast in, which I wish had been en∣creas'd by your acquaintance in Ireland. I re∣joyce in hearing that Drapiers-Hill is to emu∣late Parnassus; I fear the country about it is as much impoverish'd. I truly share in all that troubles you, and wish you remov'd from a scene of distress, which I know works your compassionate temper too strongly. But if we are not to see you here, I believe I shall once in my life see you there. You think more for me, and about me, than any friend I have, and you think better for me. Perhaps you'll not be contented, tho' I am, that the addi∣tional 100<HI>l.</HI> a year is only for my life. My mother is yet living, and I thank God for it: she will never be troublesome to me, if she be not so to herself: but a melancholy object it is, to observe the gradual decays both of body and
<PB N="139" REF="157"/>
mind, in a person to whom one is tyed by the links of both. I can't tell whether her death itself would be so afflicting.</P>
<P>You are too careful of my worldly affairs; I am rich enough, and I can afford to give away a 100<HI>l.</HI> a year. Don't be angry: I will not live to be very old; I have Revelations to the contrary. I would not crawl upon the earth without doing a little good when I have a mind to do it: I will enjoy the pleasure of what I give, by giving it, alive, and seeing an∣other enjoy it. When I die, I should be a∣sham'd to leave enough to build me a monu∣ment, if there were a wanting friend above ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Gay assures me his 3000<HI>l.</HI> is kept en∣tire and sacred; he seems to languish after a line from you, and complains tenderly. Lord Bolingbroke has told me ten times over he was going to write to you. Has he, or not? The Dr. is unalterable, both in friendship and Qua∣drille: his wife has been very near death last week: his two brothers buried their wives within these six weeks. Gay is sixty miles off, and has been so all this summer, with the Duke and Duchess of Queensbury. He is the same man: So is every one here that you know: mankind is unamendable. <HI>Optimus ille Qui minimis urgetur</HI>—Poor Mrs. * is like the rest,
<PB N="140" REF="158" MS="y"/>
she cries at the thorn in her foot, but will suf∣fer no-body to pull it out. The Court-lady I have a good opinion of, yet I have treated her more negligently than you wou'd do, because you like to see the inside of a court, which I do not. I have seen her but twice. You have a desperate hand at dashing out a character by great strokes, and at the same time a delicate one at fine touches. God forbid you shou'd draw mine, if I were conscious of any guilt: But if I were conscious only of folly, God send it! for as no-body can detect a great fault so well as you, no-body would so well hide a small one. But after all, that Lady means to do good, and does no harm, which is a vast deal for a Courtier. I can assure you that Lord Peterborow always speaks kindly of you, and certainly has as great a mind to be your friend as any one. I must throw away my pen; it cannot, it will never tell you, what I inward∣ly am to you. <HI>Quod nequeo monstrare, et sen∣tio tantum.</HI></P>

<P>I Have brought your French acquaintance thus far on her way into her own country, and considerably better in health than she was when she went to Aix. I begin to entertain hopes that she will recover such a degree of health as may render old age supportable. Both of us have closed the tenth Luster, and it is high time to determine how we shall play the last act of the Farce. Might not my life be entituled much more properly a <HI>What-d'ye-call-it</HI> than a <HI>Farce?</HI> some Comedy, a great deal of Tragedy, and the whole interspersed with scenes of Harlequin, Scaramouch, and Dr. Baloardo, the prototype of your Hero.—I used to think sometimes formerly of old age and of death: enough to prepare my mind; not enough to anticipate sorrow, to dash the joys of youth, and to be all my life a dying. I find the benefit of this practice now, and find it more as I proceed on my journey: little regret when I look backwards, little apprehen∣sion when I look forward. You complain grievously of your situation in Ireland: I would complain of mine too in England, but I will
<PB N="142" REF="160" MS="y"/>
not, nay, I ought not; for I find by long ex∣perience that I can be unfortunate without be∣ing unhappy. I do not approve your joining together the <HI>figure of living,</HI> and the <HI>pleasure of giving,</HI> tho' your old prating friend Mon∣tagne does something like it in one of his Rap∣sodies. To tell you my reasons would be to write an Essay, and I shall hardly have time to write a Letter; but if you will come over, and live with Pope and me, I'll shew you in an instant why <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose two things should not <HI>al∣ler de pair,</HI> and that forced retrenchments on both may be made, without making us even uneasy. You know that I am too expensive, and all mankind knows that I have been cruel∣ly plundered; and yet I feel in my mind the power of descending without anxiety two or three stages more. In short (Mr. Dean) if you will come to a certain farm in Middlesex, you shall find that I can live frugally without growling at the world, or being peevish with those whom fortune has appointed to eat my bread, instead of appointing me to eat theirs: and yet I have naturally as little disposition to frugality as any man alive. You say you are no philosopher, and I think you are in the right to dislike a word which is so often abused; but I am sure you like to follow reason, not cus∣tom, (which is sometimes the reason and oft∣ner
<PB N="143" REF="161"/>
the caprice of others, of the mob of the world.) Now to be sure of doing this, you must wear your philosophical spectacles as con∣stantly as the Spaniards used to wear theirs. You must make them part of your dress, and sooner part with your broad-brimm'd beaver, your gown, your scarf, or even that emblema∣tical vestment your surplice. Thro' this me∣dium you will see few things to be vexed at, few persons to be angry at: and yet there will fre∣quently be things which we ought to wish al∣tered, and persons whom we ought to wish hanged.</P>
<P>In your letter to Pope, you agree that a regard for Fame becomes a man more towards his Exit, than at his entrance into life; and yet you confess, that the longer you live, the more you grow indifferent about it. Your sentiment is true and natural; your reasoning, I am afraid, is not so upon this occasion. Prudence will make us desire Fame, because it gives us many real and great advantages in all the affairs of life. Fame is the wise man's means; his ends are his own good, and the good of society. You Poets and Orators have inverted this or∣der; you propose Fame as the end; and good, or at least great actions, as the means. You go further: You teach our self-love to antici∣pate the applause which we suppose will be
<PB N="144" REF="162"/>
paid by posterity to our names; and with idle notions of immortality you turn other heads be∣sides your own: I am afraid this may have done some harm in the world.</P>
<P>Fame is an object which men pursue success∣fully by various and even contrary courses. Your doctrine leads them to look on this end as essential, and on the means as indifferent; so that Fabricius and Crassus, Cato and Caesar pressed forward to the same goal. After all perhaps it may appear, from a consideration of the depravity of mankind, that you could do no better, nor keep up virtue in the world without calling this passion or this direction of self-love, in to your aid: <HI>Tacitus</HI> has crowded this excuse for you, according to his manner, into a maxim, <HI>Contemptu famae, contemni vir∣tutes.</HI> But now whether we consider Fame as an useful instrument in all the occurrences of private and public life, or whether we consi∣der it as the cause of that pleasure which our self-love is so fond of; methinks our entrance into life, or (to speak more properly) our youth, not our old age, is the season when we ought to desire it most, and therefore when it is most becoming to desire it with ardor. If it is useful, it is to be desired most when we have, or may hope to have, a long scene of ac∣tion open before us: Towards our exit, this
<PB N="145" REF="163"/>
scene of action is or should be closed; and then, methinks, it is unbecoming to grow fonder of a thing which we have no longer occasion for. If it is pleasant, the sooner we are in possession of fame the longer we shall enjoy this pleasure. When it is acquired early in life it may tickle us on till old age; but when it is acquired late, the sensation of pleasure will be more faint, and mingled with the regret of our not having tast∣ed it sooner.</P>
<Q><L>From my Farm, Oct. <HI>5.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I am here; I have seen Pope, and one of my first enquiries was after you. He tells me a thing I am sorry to hear: You are building, it seems, on a piece of land you have acquired for that purpose, in some county of Ireland. Tho' I have built in a part of the world, which I pre∣fer very little to that where you have been thrown and confined by our ill fortune and yours, yet I am sorry you do the same thing. I have re∣pented a thousand times of my resolution, and I hope you will repent of yours before it is exe∣cuted. Adieu, my old and worthy friend; may the physical evils of life sall as easily upon you, as ever they did on any man who lived to be old; and may the moral evils which surround us, make as little impression on you, as they ought to make on one who has such superior sense to estimate things by, and so much vir∣tue to wrap himself up in.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="164" MS="y"/>
My wife desires not to be forgotten by you; she's faithfully your servant, and zealously your admirer. She will be concerned and disap∣pointed not to find you in this Island at her re∣turn, which hope both she and I had been made to entertain before I went abroad.</P>

<P>I Receiv'd your Lordship's travelling letter of several dates, at several stages, and from different nations, languages, and religions. Nei∣ther could any thing be more obliging than your kind remembrance of me in so many places. As to your ten Lustres, I remember, when I complain'd in a letter to Prior, that I was fifty years old, he was half angry in jest, and an∣swered me out of Terence, <HI>ista commemoratio est quasi exprobratio.</HI> How then ought I to rat∣tle you, when I have a dozen years more to answer for, all monastically passed in this Coun∣try of liberty and delight, and money, and good company!

But I granted he had the greatest inequalities of any man alive, and his whole scene was fifty times more a What-d'ye-call it, than yours: for, I declare, yours was <HI>unie,</HI> and I wish you would so order it, that the world may be as wise as I upon that arti∣cle: Mr. Pope wishes it too, and I believe there is not a more honest man in England, even without wit. But you regard us not.—I was<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Year of Queen Anne's Death.</NOTE> forty seven years old when I began to think of death, and the reflections upon it now begin when I wake in the morning, and end when I am going to sleep.—I writ to Mr. Pope and not to you. My birth, although from a fa∣mily not undistinguished in its time, is many degrees inferior to your's; all my pretensions from person and parts infinitely so; I a youn∣ger son of younger sons; you born to a great fortune: yet I see you with all your advan∣tages, sunk to a degree that you could never have been without them: But yet I see you as much esteemed, as much beloved, as much dreaded, and perhaps more (though it be al∣most impossible) than ever you were in your highest exaltation—only I grieve like an Al∣derman that you are not so rich. And yet, my Lord, I pretend to value money as little as you,
<PB N="148" REF="166" MS="y"/>
and I will call five hundred witnesses (if you will take Irish witnesses) to prove it. I renounce your whole philosophy, because it is not your practice. By the <HI>figure of living,</HI> (if I used that expression to Mr. Pope) I do not mean the pa∣rade, but a suitableness to your mind; and as for the <HI>pleasure of giving,</HI> I know your soul suffers when you are debarr'd of it. Could you, when your own generosity and contempt of outward things (be not offended, it is no Ecclesiastical but an Epictetian phrase) could you, when these have brought you to it, come over and live with Mr. Pope and me at the Deanery? I could almost wish the experiment were tried—No, God forbid, that ever such a scoundrel as Want should dare to approach you. But, in the mean time, do not brag, Retrench∣ments are not your talent. But, as old Wey∣mouth said to me in his Lordly Latin, <HI>Philoso∣pha verba, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnava opera;</HI> I wish you could learn Arithmetic, that three and two make five, and will never make more. My philosophical spectacles which you advise me to, will tell me that I can live on 50 <HI>l.</HI> a year (wine excluded, which my bad health forces me to) but I can∣not endure that <HI>Otium</HI> should be <HI>sine dignitate.</HI>—My Lord, what I would have said of Fame is meant of fame which a man enjoys in his life; because I cannot be a great Lord, I would
<PB N="149" REF="167" MS="y"/>
acquire what is a kind of <HI>subsidium,</HI> I would en∣deavour that my betters should seek me by the merit of something distinguishable, instead of my seeking them. The desire of enjoying it in after-times is owing to the spirit and folly of youth: but with age we learn to know the house is so full, that there is no room for above one or two at most in an age, through the whole world. My Lord, I hate and love to write to you, it gives me pleasure, and kills me with melancholy. The D—take stupidity, that it will not come to supply the want of philo∣sophy.</P>

<P>YOU were so careful of sending me the Dunciad, that I have received five of them, and have pleased four friends. I am one of every body who approve every part of it, Text and Comment; but am one abstracted from every body, in the happiness of being record∣ed your friend, while wit, and humour, and politeness shall have any memorial among us. As for your octavo edition, we know nothing
<PB N="150" REF="168"/>
of it, for we have an octavo of our own, which hath sold wonderfully, considering our poverty, and dulness the consequence of it.</P>
<P>I writ this post to Lord B. and tell him in my letter, that, with a great deal of loss for a frolick, I will fly as soon as build; I have nei∣ther years, nor spirits, nor money, nor pati∣ence for such amusements. The frolick is gone off, and I am only 100 <HI>l.</HI> the poorer. But this kingdom is grown so excessively poor, that we wise men must think of nothing but getting a little ready money. It is thought there are not two hundred thousand pounds of species in the whole island; for we return thrice as much to our Absentees, as we get by trade, and so are all inevitably undone; which I have been tel∣ling them in print these ten years, to as little purpose as if it came from the pulpit. And this is enough for Irish politics, which I only men∣tion, because it so nearly touches myself. I must repeat what, I believe, I have said before, that I pity you much more than Mrs. Pope. Such a parent and friend hourly declining be∣fore your eyes is an object very unfit for your health, and duty, and tender disposition; and I pray God it may not affect you too much. I am as much satisfied that your additional 100 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> is for your life as if it were for ever. You hare enough to leave your friends, I would
<PB N="151" REF="169"/>
not have them glad to be rid of you; and I shall take care that none but my enemies will be glad to get rid of me. You have embroil∣ed me with Lord B—about the figure of living, and the pleasure of giving. I am under the necessity of some little paultry figure in the station I am; but I make it as little as possible. As to the other part you are base, because I thought myself as great a giver as ever was of my ability; and yet in proportion you exceed, and have kept it till now a secret even from me, when I wondred how you were able to live with your whole little revenue.</P>

<P>I Find that you have laid aside your project of building in Ireland, and that we shall see you in this island <HI>cum zephyris, et hirundine prima.</HI> I know not whether the love of fame increases as we advance in age; sure I am that the force of friendship does. I lov'd you al∣most twenty years ago, I thought of you as well as I do now, better was beyond the power

of conception, or, to avoid an equivoque, be∣yond the extent of my ideas. Whether you are more obliged to me for loving you as well when I knew you less, or for loving you as well after loving you so many years, I shall not de∣termine. What I would say is this: whilst my mind grows daily more independant of the world, and feels less need of leaning on exter∣nal objects, the ideas of friendship return oft∣ner, they busy me, they warm me more: Is it that we grow more tender as the moment of our great separation approaches? or is it that they who are to live together in another state, (for <HI>vera amicitia non nisi inter bonos)</HI> begin to feel more strongly that divine sympathy which is to be the great band of their future society? There is no one thought which sooths my mind like this: I encourage my imagination to pur∣sue it, and am heartily afflicted when another faculty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Viz. <HI>Reason.</HI> Tully (or, what is much the same, his Disciple) observes something like this on the like occasion, where, speaking of Plato's famous book of the Soul, he says, <HI>Niscio quom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>do, dum l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go, adsentior: cum posui librum, et mecum ipse de im∣mortalitate animorum coepi cogitare, adsensio illa omnis elabitur.</HI> Cicero, seems to have had but a confused no∣tion of the <HI>cause,</HI> which the Letter-writer has here ex∣plained, namely, that the <HI>imagination</HI> is always ready to indulge so flattering an idea, but severer <HI>reason</HI> cor∣rects and disclaims it.

and wakes me from so pleasing a dream, if it be a dream. I will dwell no more on Oecono∣micks than I have done in my former letter. Thus much only I will say, that <HI>otium cum dig∣nitate</HI> is to be had with 500 <HI>l.</HI> a year as well as with 5000: the difference will be found in the value of the man, and not in that of the estate. I do assure you, that I have never quitted the design of collecting, revising, improving, and extending several materials whicha are still in my power; and I hope that the time of fetting my∣self about this last work of my life is not far off. Many papers of much curiosity and importance are lost, and some of them in a manner which would surprize and anger you. However I shall be able to convey several great truths to poste∣rity, so clearly and so authentically, that the Burnets and the Oldmixons of another age may rail, but not be able to deceive. Adieu, my friend. I have taken up more of this paper than belongs to me, since Pope is to write to you; no matter, for, upon recollection, the rules of proportion are not broken; he will say as much to you in one page, as I have said in three. Bid him talk to you of the work he is about, I hope in good earnest; it is a fine one; and will be, in his hands, an original <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Essay on Man.</NOTE>. His sole complaint is, that he finds it too easy in the

<P>THIS letter (like all mine) will be a Rhapsody; it is many years ago since I wrote as a Wit <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He used to value himself on this particular.</NOTE>. How many occurrences or informations must one omit, if one determin'd to say nothing that one could not say prettily? I lately receiv'd from the widow of one dead correspondent, and the father of another, se∣veral of my own letters of about fifteen and twenty years old; and it was not unentertain∣ing to myself to observe, how and by what de∣grees I ceas'd to be a witty writer; as either my experience grew on the one hand, or my affection to my correspondents on the other. Now as I love you better than most I have ever met with in the world, and esteem you too the more, the longer I have compar'd you with the rest of the world; so inevitably I write to you more negligently, that is, more openly, and what
<PB N="155" REF="173"/>
all but such as love one another will call writ∣ing worse. I smile to think how Curl would be bit, were our Epistles to fall into his hands, and how gloriously they would fall short of ev'ry ingenious reader's expectations?</P>
<P>You can't imagine what a vanity it is to me, to have something to rebuke you for in the way of Oeconomy. I love the man that builds a a house <HI>subito ingenio,</HI> and makes a wall for a horse: then cries, <Q>“We wise men must think of nothing but getting ready money.”</Q> I am glad you approve my annuity; all we have in this world is no more than an annuity, as to our own enjoyment: but I will encrease your regard for my wisdom, and tell you, that this annuity includes also the life of another <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">His Mother's.</NOTE>, whose concern ought to be as near me as my own, and with whom my whole prospects ought to finish. I throw my javelin of Hope no far∣ther, <HI>Cur brevi fortes jaculamur aevo</HI>—&amp;c.</P>
<P>The second (as it is called, but indeed the eighth) edition of the Dunciad, with some ad∣ditional notes and epigrams, shall be sent you, if I know any opportunity; if they reprint it with you, let them by all means follow that octavo edition.—The Drapier's letters are again printed here, very laudably as to paper, print, &amp;c. for you know I disapprove Irish politics, (as my Commentator tells you) being a strong
<PB N="156" REF="174" MS="y"/>
and jealous subject of England. The Lady you mention, you ought not complain of for not acknowledging your present; she having lately receiv'd a much richer present from Mr. Knight of the S. Sea; and you are sensible she cannot ever return it to one in the condition of an out∣law. It's certain, as he can never expect any favour <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">He was mistaken in this. Mr. Knight was pardoned, and came home in the year 1742.</NOTE>, his motive must be wholly dis-in∣terested. Will not this Reflection make you blush? Your continual deplorings of Ireland, make me wish you were here long enough to forget those scenes that so afflict you: I am on∣ly in fear if you were, you would grow such a patriot here too, as not to be quite at ease, for your love of old England.—It is very possi∣ble, your journey, in the time I compute, might exactly tally with my intended one to you; and if you must soon again go back, you would not be un-attended. For the poor woman decays perceptibly every week; and the winter may too probably put an end to a very long, and a very irreproachable life. My constant attend∣ance on her does indeed affect my mind very much, and lessen extremely my desires of long life; since I see the best that can come of it is a miserable benediction. I look upon myself to be many years older in two years since you
<PB N="157" REF="175"/>
saw me: The natural imbecillity of my body, join'd now to this acquir'd old age of the mind, makes me at least as old as you, and we are the fitter to crawl down the hill together: I only desire I may be able to keep pace with you. My first friendship at sixteen, was contracted with a man of seventy, and I found him not grave enough or consistent enough for me, tho' we lived well to his death. I speak of old Mr. Whcherly; some letters of whom (by the by) and of mine, the Booksellers have got and printed, not without the concurrence of a no∣ble friend of mine and yours <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See the occasion, in the second and third Paragraphs of the Preface to the first Volume of Letters. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. I don't much approve of it; tho' there is nothing for me to be asham'd of, because I will not be asham'd of any thing I do not do myself, or of any thing that is not immoral but merely dull (as for instance, if they printed this letter I am now writing, which they easily may, if the un∣derlings at the Post-office please to take a copy of it.) I admire on this consideration, your send∣ing your last to me quite open, without a seal, wafer, or any closure whatever, manifesting the utter openness of the writer. I would do the same by this, but fear it would look like affec∣tation to send two letters so together.—I will fully represent to our friend (and, I doubt not, it
<PB N="158" REF="176"/>
will touch his heart) what you so feelingly set forth as to the badness of your Burgundy, &amp;c. He is an extreme honest man, and indeed ought to be so, considering how very indiscreet and unreserved he is: But I do not approve this part of his character, and will never join with him in any of his idlenesses in the way of wit. You know my maxim to keep as clear of all offence, as I am clear of all interest in either party. I was once displeas'd before at you, for complaining to Mr. * of my not having a pension, and am so again at your naming it to a certain Lord. I have given proof in the course of my whole life, (from the time when I was in the friendship of Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Craggs, even to this when I am civilly treated by Sir R. Walpole) that I never thought myself so warm in any Party's cause as to deserve their money; and therefore would never have accepted it: But give me leave to tell you, that of all mankind the two persons I would least have accepted any favour from, are those very two, to whom you have unluckily spoken of it. I desire you to take off any impressions which that dialogue may have left on his Lordship's mind, as if I ever had any thought of being beholden to him, or any other, in that way. And yet, you know I am no enemy to the present Constitution; I believe, as sincere a well-wisher to it, nay, even
<PB N="159" REF="177"/>
to the church establish'd, as any Minister in, or out of employment whatever; or any Bishop of England or Ireland. Yet am I of the Religion of Erasmus, a Catholic; so I live, so I shall die; and hope one day to meet you, Bishop Atterbury, the younger Craggs, Dr. Garth, Dean Berkeley, and Mr. Hutchenson, in that place, To which God of his infinite mercy bring us, and every body!</P>

<P>THIS is a letter extraordinary, to do and say nothing but recommend to you (as a Clergyman, and a charitable one) a pious and a good work, and for a good and an honest man: Moreover he is above seventy, and poor, which you might think included in the word honest. I shall think it a kindness done my∣self; if you can propagate Mr. Westley's sub∣scription for his Commentary on Job, among your Divines, (Bishops excepted, of whom there is no hope) and among such as are be∣lievers, or readers, of Scripture. Even the cu∣rious
<PB N="160" REF="178"/>
may find something to please them, if they scorn to be edified. It has been the la∣bour of eight years of this learned man's life; I call him what he is, a learned man, and I engage you will approve his prose more than you formerly could his poetry. Lord Boling∣broke is a favourer of it, and allows you to do your best to serve an old Tory, and a sufferer for the Church of England, tho' you are a Whig, as I am.</P>
<P>We have here some verses in your name, which I am angry at. Sure you wou'd not use me so ill as to flatter me? I therefore think it is some other weak Irishman.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I did not take the pen out of Pope's hands, I protest to you. But since he will not fill the remainder of the page, I think I may without offence. I seek no epistolary fame, but am a good deal pleased to think that it will be known hereafter that you and I lived in the most friendly intimacy together.—Pliny writ his letters for the public, so did Seneca, so did Balsac, Voiture, &amp;c. Tully did not, and there∣fore these give us more pleasure than any which have come down to us from antiquity. When we read them, we pry into a secret which was intended to be kept from us. That is a plea∣sure. We see Cato, and Brutus, and Pompey,
<PB N="161" REF="179"/>
and others, such as they really were, and not such as the gaping multitude of their own age took them to be, or as Historians and Poets have represented them to ours. That is another pleasure. I remember to have seen a procession at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> wherein an image of Charle∣magne is carried on the shoulders of a man, who is hid by the long robe of the imperial Saint. Follow him into the vestry, you see the bearer slip from under the robe, and the gigan∣tic figure dwindles into an image of the ordina∣ry size, and is set by among other lumber—I agree much with Pope, that our climate is ra∣ther better than that you are in, and perhaps your public spirit would be less grieved, or oft∣ner comforted, here than there. Come to us therefore on a visit at least. It will not be the fault of several persons here, if you do not come to live with us. But great good-will and little power produce such slow and feeble effects as can be acceptable to heaven alone, and heaven∣ly men.—I know you will be angry with me, if I say nothing to you of a poor woman, who is still on the other side of the water in a most languishing state of health. If she regains strength enough to come over, (and she is bet∣ter within a few weeks) I shall nurse her in this farm with all the care and tenderness pos∣sible. If she does not, I must pay her the last
<PB N="162" REF="180"/>
duty of friendship wherever she is, tho' I break thro' the whole plan of life which I have form∣ed in my mind. Adieu. I am most faithful∣ly and affectionately yours.</P>

<P>I Begin my Letter by telling you that my wife has been returned from abroad about a month, and that her health, tho' feeble and precarious, is better than it has been these two years. She is much your servant, and as she has been her own physician with some success, imagines she could be yours with the same. Would to God you was within her reach. She would, I believe, prescribe a great deal of the <HI>medicina animi,</HI> without having recourse to the Books of Trismegistus. Pope and I should be her principal apothecaries in the course of the cure; and tho' our best Botanists complain, that few of the herbs and simples which go to the composition of these remedies, are to be found at present in our soil, yet there are more of them here than in Ireland; besides, by the help of a little chemistry the most noxious
<PB N="163" REF="181"/>
juices may become salubrious, and rank poison a specific.—Pope is now in my library with me, and writes to the world, to the present and to future ages, whilst I begin this letter which he is to finish to you. What good he will do to mankind I know not; this comfort he may be sure of, he cannot do less than you have done before him. I have sometimes thought, that if preachers, hangmen, and moral-writers keep vice at a stand, or so much as retard the progress of it, they do as much as human na∣ture admits: a real reformation is not to be brought about by ordinary means; it requires those extraordinary means which become pu∣nishments as well as lessons: National corrup∣tion must be purged by national calamities.—Let us hear from you.

<P>I Have delayed several posts answering your letter of January last, in hopes of being a∣ble to speak to you about a project which con∣cerns
<PB N="164" REF="182"/>
us both, but me the most, since the suc∣cess of it would bring us together. It has been a good while in my head, and at my heart; if it can be set a going, you shall hear more of it. I was ill in the beginning of the winter for near a week, but in no danger either from the na∣ture of my distemper, or from the attendance of three physicians. Since that bilious inter∣mitting feaver, I have had, as I had before, better health than the regard I have payed to health deserves. We are both in the decline of life, my dear Dean, and have been some years going down the hill; let us make the pas∣sage as smooth as we can. Let us fence against physical evil by care, and the use of those means which experience must have pointed out to us: Let us fence against moral evil by philosophy. I renounce the alternative you propose. But we may, nay (if we will follow nature, and do not work up imagination against her plainest dic∣tates) we shall of course grow every year more indifferent to life, and to the affairs and interests of a system out of which we are soon to go. This is much better than stupidity. The decay of passion strengthens philosophy, for passion may decay, and stupidity not succeed. <HI>Passions</HI> (says Pope, our Divine, as you will see one time or other) are the <HI>Gales</HI> of life: Let us not com∣plain that they do not blow a storm. What
<PB N="165" REF="183"/>
hurt does age do us, in subduing what we toil to subdue all our lives? It is now six in the morning: I recall the time (and am glad it is over) when about this hour I used to be going to bed, surfeited with pleasure, or jaded with business: my head often full of schemes, and my heart as often full of anxiety. Is it a mis∣fortune, think you, that I rise at this hour, re∣freshed, serene, and calm? that the past, and even the present affairs of life stand like objects at a distance from me, where I can keep off the disagreeable so as not to be strongly affected by them, and from whence I can draw the others nearer to me? Passions in their force, would bring all these, nay even future contingencies, about my ears at once, and Reason would but ill defend me in the scuffle.</P>
<P>I leave Pope to speak for himself, but I must tell you how much my Wife is obliged to you. She says she would find strength enough to nurse you, if you was here, and yet, God knows, she is extremely weak: The slow fever works un∣der, and mines the constitution; we keep it off sometimes, but still it returns, and makes new breaches before nature can repair the old ones. I am not ashamed to say to you, that I admire her more every hour of my life: Death is not to her the King of Terrors; she beholds him without the least. When she suffers much, she
<PB N="166" REF="184"/>
wishes for him as a deliverer from pain; when life is tolerable, she looks on him with dislike, because he is to separate her from those friends to whom she is more attached than to life itself.—You shall not stay for my next, as long as you have for this letter; and in every one, Pope shall write something much better than the scraps of old Philosophers, which were the presents, Munuscula, that Stoical Fop Seneca used to send in every Epistle to his friend Lucilius.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. My Lord has spoken justly of his La∣dy: why not I of my Mother? Yesterday was her birth-day, now entering on the ninety-first year of her age; her memory much diminish'd, but her senses very little hurt, her sight and hearing good; she sleeps not ill, eats moderate∣ly, drinks water, says her prayers; this is all she does. I have reason to thank God for con∣tinuing so long to me a very good and tender parent, and for allowing me to exercise for some years, those cares which are now as necessary to her, as hers have been to me. An object of this sort daily before one's eyes very much soft∣ens the mind, but perhaps may hinder it from the willingness of contracting other tyes of the like domestic nature, when one finds how pain∣ful it is even to enjoy the tender pleasures. I
<PB N="167" REF="185"/>
have formerly made some strong efforts to get and to deserve a friend: perhaps it were wiser never to attempt it, but live Extempore, and look upon the world only as a place to pass thro', just pay your hosts their due, disperse a little charity, and hurry on. Yet am I just now writing (or rather planning) a book, to make mankind look upon this life with comfort and pleasure, and put morality in good humour.—And just now too, I am going to see one I love very tenderly; and to-morrow to entertain several civil people, whom if we call friends, it is by the Courtesy of England.—<HI>Sic, sic ju∣vat ire sub umbras.</HI> While we do live, we must make the best of life,

<P>YOU may assure yourself, that, if you come over this spring, you will find me not on∣ly got back into the habits of study, but de∣voted to that historical task, which you have

set me these many years. I am in hopes of some materials which will enable me to work in the whole extent of the plan I propose to myself. If they are not to be had, I must accommodate my plan to this deficiency. In the mean time Pope has given me more trouble than he or I thought of; and you will be surprized to find that I have been partly drawn by him and part∣ly by myself, to write a pretty large volume upon a very grave and very important subject; that I have ventur'd to pay no regard whatever to any authority except sacred authority, and that I have ventured to start a thought, which must, if it is push'd as successfully as I think it is, render all your Metaphysical Theology both ridiculous and abominable. There is an expression in one of your letters to me, which makes me believe you will come into my way of thinking on this subject; and yet I am per∣swaded that Divines and Freethinkers would both be clamorous against it, if it was to be submitted to their censure, as I do not intend that it shall. The passage I mean, is that where you say that you told Dr. * the Grand points of Christianity ought to be taken as infallible Revelations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In this maxim all bigot∣ted <HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>free-thinking</HI> Politicians agree: the one, for fear of disturbing the esta∣blished Religion; the other, lest that disturbance should prove injurious to their admi∣nistration of government.</NOTE>, &amp;c.</P>

It has happened, that, whilst I was writing this to you, the Dr. came to make me a visit from London, where I heard he was arrived some time ago: He was in haste to return, and is, I perceive, in great haste to print. He left with me eight Dissertations <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Revelation examined with candor.</NOTE>, a small part, as I understand, of his work, and desired me to peruse, consider, and observe upon them against monday next, when he will come down again. By what I have read of the two first, I find my∣self unable to serve him. The principles he reasons upon are begged in a disputation of this sort, and the manner of reasoning is by no means close and conclusive. The sole advice I could give him in conscience would be that which he would take ill and not follow. I will get rid of this task as well as I can, for I esteem the man, and should be sorry to disoblige him where I cannot serve him.</P>
<P>As to retirement, and exercise, your notions are true: The first should not be indulged so much as to render us savage, nor the last neg∣lected so as to impair health. But I know men, who, for fear of being savage, live with all who will live with them; and who, to preserve their health, saunter away half their time. Adieu: Pope calls for the paper.</P>

<P>P. S. I hope what goes before will be a strong motive to your coming. God knows if ever I shall see Ireland; I shall never desire it, if you can be got hither, or kept here. Yet I think I shall be, too soon, a Free-man.—Your recommendations I constantly give to those you mention; tho' some of 'em I see but seldom, and am every day more retired. I am less fond of the world, and less curious about it: yet no way out of humour, disappointed, or angry: tho' in my way I receive as many injuries as my betters, but I don't feel them, therefore I ought not to vex other people, nor even to re∣turn injuries. I pass almost all my time at Dawley and at home; my Lord (of which I partly take the merit to myself) is as much estranged from politics as I am. Let Philoso∣phy be ever so vain, it is less vain now than Politics, and not quite so vain at present as Di∣vinity: I know nothing that moves strongly but Satire, and those who are asham'd of nothing else, are so of being ridiculous. I fancy, if we three were together but for three years, some good might be done even upon this Age.</P>
<P>I know you'll desire some account of my health: It is as usual, but my spirits rather worse. I write little or nothing. You know I never had either a taste or talent for politics, and the world minds nothing else. I have per∣sonal
<PB N="171" REF="189"/>
obligations which I will ever preserve, to men of different sides, and I wish nothing so much as public quiet, except it be my own quiet. I think it a merit, if I can take off any man from grating or satirical subjects, merely on the score of Party: and it is the greatest vanity of my life that I've contributed to turn my Lord Bolingbroke to subjects moral, useful, and more worthy his pen. Dr.—'s Book is what I can't commend so much as Dean Berkley's <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">A fine original work cal∣led, <HI>The Minute Philosopher.</HI></NOTE>, tho' it has many things ingenious in it, and is not deficient in the writing part: but the whole book, tho' he meant it <HI>ad Popu∣lum,</HI> is, I think, purely <HI>ad Clerum</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">He might have added <HI>à Clero,</HI> as most of these <HI>inge∣nious things</HI> are borrowed from his Brethren.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I Deny it. I do write to you according to the old stipulation, for, when you kept your old company, when I writ to one I writ to all. But I am ready to enter into a new bargain since you are got into a new world, and will answer all your letters. You are first to present my most humble respects to the Duchess of Queensbury, and let her know that I never dine without thinking of her, although it be with some dif∣ficulty
<PB N="173" REF="191"/>
that I can obey her when I dine with forks that have but two prongs, and when the sauce is not very consistent. You must likewise tell her Grace that she is a general Toast among all honest folks here, and particularly at the Deanery, even in the face of my Whig sub∣jects.—I will leave my money in Lord Ba∣thurst's hands, and the management of it (for want of better) in yours: and pray keep the interest-mony in a bag wrapt up and sealed by itself, for fear of your own fingers under your carelessness. Mr. Pope talks of you as a per∣fect stranger; but the different pursuits and manners and interests of life, as fortune hath pleased to dispose them, will never suffer those to live together, who by their inclinations ought never to part. I hope when you are rich enough, you will have some little oecono∣my of your own in town or country, and be able to give your friend a pint of Port; for the domestic season of life will come on. I had never much hopes of your vampt Play, al∣though Mr. Pope seem'd to have, and although it were ever so good: But you should have done like the Parsons, and changed your Text, I mean the Title, and the names of the persons. After all, it was an effect of idleness, for you are in the prime of life, when invention and judgment go together. I wish you had 100<HI>l.</HI>

a year more for horses—I ride and walk when∣ever good weather invites, and am reputed the best walker in this town and five miles round.

<P>WHEN my Lord Peterborow in the Queen's time went abroad upon his Ambassies, the Ministry told me, that he was such a vagrant, they were forced to write <HI>at</HI> him by guess, because they knew not where to write <HI>to</HI> him. This is my case with you; sometimes in Scotland, sometimes at Ham∣walks, sometimes God knows where. You are a man of business, and not at leisure for insig∣nificant correspondence. It was I got you the employment of being my Lord Duke's <HI>premier Ministre:</HI> for his Grace having heard how good a manager you were of my revenue, thought you fit to be entrusted with ten talents. I have had twenty times a strong inclination to spend a summer near Salisbury-downs, having rode
<PB N="175" REF="193"/>
over them more than once, and with a young parson of Salisbury reckoned twice the stones of Stonehenge, which are either ninety-two or ninety-three. I desire to present my most humble acknowledgements to my Lady Duchess in return of her civility. I hear an ill thing, that she is <HI>matre pulchra filia pulchrior:</HI> I never saw her since she was a girl, and would be an∣gry she should excel her mother, who was long my principal Goddess. I desire you will tell her Grace, that the ill management of forks is not to be help'd when they are only bidential, which happens in all poor houses, especially those of Poets; upon which account a knife was absolutely necessary at Mr. Pope's, where it was morally impossible with a bidential fork to convey a morsel of beef, with the incum∣brance of mustard and turnips, into your mouth at once. And her Grace hath cost me thirty pounds to provide Tridents for fear of offend∣ing her, which sum I desire she will please to return me.—I am sick enough to go to the Bath, but have not heard it will be good for my disorder. I have a strong mind to spend my 200<HI>l.</HI> next summer in France: I am glad I have it, for there is hardly twice that sum left in this kingdom. You want no settlement (I call the family where you live, and the foot you are upon, a settlement) till you increase
<PB N="176" REF="194"/>
your fortune to what will support you with ease and plenty, a good house and a garden. The want of this I much dread for you: For I have often known a She-cousin of a good family and small fortune, passing months among all her relations, living in plenty, and taking her circles, till she grew an old Maid, and every body weary of her. Mr. Pope complains of seldom seeing you; but the evil is unavoidable, for different circumstances of life have always separated those whom friendship would join: God hath taken care of this, to prevent any progress towards real happiness here, which would make life more desirable, and death too dreadful. I hope you have now one advantage that you always wanted before, and the want of which made your friends as uneasy as it did yourself; I mean the removal of that solicitude about your own affairs, which perpetually fill'd your thoughts and disturb'd your conversation. For if it be true what Mr. Pope seriously tells me, you will have opportunity of saving every groat of the interest you receive; and so by the time he and you grow weary of each other, you will be able to pass the rest of your wine∣less life, in ease and plenty, with the addition∣al triumphal comfort of never having receiv'd a penny from those tasteless ungrateful people from whom you deserved so much, and who
<PB N="177" REF="195"/>
deserve no better Genius's than those by whom they are celebrated.—If you see Mr. Cesar, pre∣sent my humble service to him, and let him know that the scrub Libel printed against me here, and re-printed in London, for which he shew∣ed a kind concern to a friend of us both, was written by myself, and sent to a Whig-printer: It was in the style and genius of such scoun∣drels, when the humour of libelling ran in this strain against a friend of mine whom you know.—But my paper is ended.</P>

<P>I Writ to you a long letter about a fortnight past concluding you were in London, from whence I understood one of your former was dated: Nor did I imagine you were gone back to Aimsbury so late in the year, at which season I take the Country to be only a scene for those who have been ill used by a Court on account of their Virtues; which is a state of happiness the more valuable, because it is not accompa∣nied by Envy, although nothing deserves it more. I would gladly sell a Dukedom to lose favour in the manner their Graces have done. I believe my Lord Carteret, since he is no
<PB N="178" REF="196" MS="y"/>
longer Lieutenant, may not wish me ill, and I have told him often that I only hated him as Lieutenant: I confess he had a genteeler man∣ner of binding the chains of this kingdom than most of his predecessors, and I confess at the same time that he had, six times, a regard to my recommendation by preferring so many of my friends in the church; the two last acts of his favour were to add to the dignities of Dr. Delany and Mr. Stopford, the last of whom was by you and Mr. Pope put into Mr. Pult∣ney's hands. I told you in my last, that a con∣tinuance of giddiness (tho' not in a violent de∣gree) prevented my thoughts of England at present. For in my case a domestic life is ne∣cessary, where I can with the Centurion say to my servant, Go, and he goeth, and Do this, and he doth it. I now hate all people whom I cannot command, and consequently a Duchess is at this the hatefullest Lady in the world to me, one only excepted, and I beg her Grace's pardon for that exception, for, in the way I mean, her Grace is ten thousand times more hateful. I confess I begin to apprehend you will squander my money, because I hope you never less wanted it; and if you go on with success for two years longer, I fear I shall not have a far∣thing of it left. The Doctor hath ill-informed me, who says that Mr. Pope is at present the
<PB N="179" REF="197"/>
chief Poetical Favourite, yet Mr. Pope himself talks like a Philosopher and one wholly retir'd. But the vogue of our sew honest folks here is, that Duck is absolutely to succeed Eusden in the laurel, the contention being between Concannen or Theobald, or some other Hero of the Dun∣ciad. I never charged you for not talking, but the dubious state of your affairs in those days was too much the subject, and I wish the Du∣chess had been the voucher of your amendment. Nothing so much contributed to my ease as the turn of affairs after the Queen's death; by which all my hopes being cut off, I could have no Ambition left, unless I would have been a greater rascal than happened to suit with my temper. I therefore sat down quietly at my morsel, adding only thereto a principle of ha∣tred to all succeeding Measures and Ministries by way of sauce to relish my meat: And I con∣fess one point of conduct in my Lady Duchess's life hath added much poignancy to it. There is a good Irish practical bull towards the end of your letter, where you spend a dozen lines in telling me you must leave off, that you may give my Lady Duchess room to write, and so you proceed to within two or three lines of the bottom; though I would have remitted you my 200 <HI>l.</HI> to have left place for as many more.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My beginning thus low is meant as a mark of respect, like receiving your Grace at the bot∣tom of the stairs. I am glad you know your duty; for it hath been a known and establish'd rule above twenty years in England, that the first advances have been constantly made me by all Ladies who aspir'd to my acquaintance, and the greater their quality, the greater were their advances. Yet, I know not by what weakness, I have condescended graciously to dispense with you upon this important article. Though Mr. Gay will tell you that a nameless person sent me eleven messages before I would yield to a visit: I mean a person to whom he is infinite∣ly obliged, for being the occasion of the hap∣piness he now enjoys under the protection and favour of my Lord Duke and your Grace. At the same time, I cannot forbear telling you, Madam, that you are a little imperious in your manner of making your advances. You say, perhaps you shall not like me; I affirm you are mistaken, which I can plainly demonstrate; for I have certain intelligence, that another per∣son dislikes me of late, with whose likings yours have not for some time past gone toge∣ther
<PB N="181" REF="199"/>
However, if I shall once have the ho∣nour to attend your Grace, I will out of fear and prudence appear as vain as I can, that I may not know your thoughts of me. This is your own direction, but it was needless: For Diogenes himself would be vain, to have re∣ceiv'd the honour of being one moment of his life in the thoughts of your Grace.</P>

<P>YOUR situation is an odd one; the Du∣chess is your Treasurer, and Mr. Pope tells me you are the Duke's. And I had gone a good way in some Verses on that occasion, prescribing lessons to direct your conduct, in a negative way, not to do so and so, &amp;c. like other Treasurers; how to deal with Servants, Tenants, or neighbouring Squires, which I take to be Courtiers, Parliaments, and Princes in alliance, and so the parallel goes on, but grows too long to please me: I prove that Poets are the fittest persons to be treasurers and managers to great persons, from their virtue, and con∣tempt of money, &amp;c.—Pray, why did you not get a new heel to your shoe? unless you would make your court at St. James's by affecting to
<PB N="182" REF="200"/>
imitate the Prince of Lilliput.—But the rest of your letter being wholly taken up in a very bad character of the Duchess, I shall say no more to you, but apply myself to her Grace.</P>
<P>Madam, since Mr. Gay affirms that you love to have your own way, and since I have the same perfection; I will settle that matter im∣mediately, to prevent those ill consequences he apprehends. Your Grace shall have your own way, in all places except your own house, and the domains about it. There and there only, I expect to have mine, so that you have all the world to reign in, bating only two or three hun∣dred acres, and two or three houses in town and country. I will likewise, out of my special grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, allow you to be in the right against all human kind, except myself, and to be never in the wrong but when you differ from me. You shall have a greater privilege in the third article of speaking your mind; which I shall graciously allow you now and then to do even to myself, and only rebuke you when it does not please me.</P>
<P>Madam, I am now got as far as your Grace's letter, which having not read this fortnight (having been out of town, and not daring to trust myself with the carriage of it) the pre∣sumptuous manner in which you begin had
<PB N="183" REF="201"/>
slipt out of my memory. But I forgive you to the seventeenth line, where you begin to banish me for ever, by demanding me to answer all the good Character some partial friends have given me. Madam, I have lived sixteen years in Ireland, with only an intermission of two summers in England; and consequently am fifty years older than I was at the Queen's death, and fifty-thousand times duller, and fifty-mil∣lion times more peevish, perverse, and morose; so that under these disadvantages I can only pre∣tend to excel all your other acquaintance about some twenty barrs length. Pray, Madam, have you a clear voice? and will you let me sit at your left hand at least within three of you, for of two bad ears, my right is the best? My Groom tells me that he likes your park, but your house is too little. Can the Parson of the parish play at back-gammon, and hold his tongue? is any one of your Women a good nurse, if I should fancy myself sick for four and twenty hours? how many days will you main∣tain me and my equipage? When these preli∣minaries are settled, I must be very poor, very sick, or dead, or to the last degree unfortunate, if I do not attend you at Aimsbury. For, I pro∣fess, you are the first Lady that ever I desired to see, since the first of August 1714, and I have forgot the date when that desire grew strong up∣on
<PB N="184" REF="202"/>
me, but I know I was not then in England, else I would have gone on foot for that happiness as far as to your house in Scotland. But I can soon re∣collect the time, by asking some Ladies here the month, the day, and the hour when I began to endure their company? which however I think was a sign of my ill judgment, for I do not per∣ceive they mend in any thing but envying or admiring your Grace. I dislike nothing in your letter but an affected apology for bad writing, bad spelling, and a bad pen, which you pre∣tend Mr. Gay found fault with; wherein you affront Mr. Gay, you affront me, and you af∣front yourself. False spelling is only excusable in a Chamber-maid, for I would not pardon it in any of your Waiting-women.—Pray God preserve your Grace and family, and give me leave to expect that you will be so just to re∣member me among those who have the great∣est regard for virtue, goodness, prudence, cou∣rage and generosity; after which you must conclude that I am with the greatest respect and gratitude, Madam, your Grace's most obe∣dient and most humble servant, &amp;c.</P>

<P>EVER since I received your letter, I have been upon a balance about going to Eng∣land, and landing at Bristol, to pass a month at Aimsbury, as the Duchess hath given me leave. But many difficulties have interfered; first, I thought I had done with my law-suit, and so did all my lawyers, but my adversary, after being in appearance a Protestant these twenty years, hath declared he was always a Papist, and consequently by the law here, cannot buy nor (I think) sell; so that I am at sea a∣gain, for almost all I am worth. But I have still a worse evil; for the giddiness I was sub∣ject to, instead of coming seldom and violent, now constantly attends me more or less, tho' in a more peaceable manner, yet such as will not qualify me to live among the young and healthy: and the Duchess, in all her youth, spi∣rit,
<PB N="186" REF="204"/>
and grandeur, will make a very ill nurse, and her women not much better. Valetudina∣rians must live where they can command, and scold; I must have horses to ride, I must go to bed and rise when I please, and live where all mortals are subservient to me. I must talk non∣sense when I please, and all who are present must commend it. I must ride thrice a week, and walk three or four miles besides, every day.</P>
<P>I always told you Mr.—was good for nothing but to be a rank Courtier. I care not whether he ever writes to me or no. He and you may tell this to the Duchess, and I hate to see you so charitable, and such a Cully; and yet I love you for it, because I am one my∣self.</P>
<P>You are the silliest lover in Christendom: If you like Mrs.—why do you not command her to take you? if she does not, she is not worth pursuing; you do her too much honour; she hath neither sense nor taste, if she dares to refuse you, though she had ten thousand pounds. I do not remember to have told you of thanks that you have not given, nor do I understand your meaning, and I am sure I had never the least thoughts of any myself. If I am your friend, it is for my own reputation, and from a prin∣ciple of self-love, and I do sometimes reproach
<PB N="187" REF="205"/>
you for not honouring me by letting the world know we are friends.</P>
<P>I see very well how matters go with the Du∣chess in regard to me. I heard her say, Mr. Gay, fill your letter to the Dean, that there may be no room for me, the frolic is gone far enough, I have writ thrice, I will do no more; if the man has a mind to come, let him come; what a clutter is here? positively I will not write a syllable more. She is an ungrateful Duchess considering how many adorers I have procured her here, over and above the thou∣sands she had before.—I cannot allow you rich enough till you are worth 7000 <HI>l.</HI> which will bring you 300 <HI>per Annum,</HI> and this will main∣tain you, with the perquisite of spunging while you are young, and when you are old will af∣ford you a pint of port at night, two servants, and an old maid, a little garden, and pen and ink—provided you live in the country—Have you no scheme either in verse or prose? The Duchess should keep you at hard meat, and by that means force you to write; and so I have done with you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since I began to grow old, I have found all ladies become inconstant, without any reproach from their conscience. If I wait on you, I de∣clare
<PB N="188" REF="206"/>
that one of your women (which ever it is that has designs upon a Chaplain) must be my nurse, if I happen to be sick or peevish at your house, and in that case you must suspend your domineering-Claim till I recover. Your omitting the usual appendix to Mr. Gay's let∣ters hath done me infinite mischief here; for while you continued them, you would wonder how civil the Ladies here were to me, and how much they have altered since. I dare not con∣fess that I have descended so low as to write to your Grace, after the abominable neglect you have been guilty of; for if they but suspected it, I should lose them all. One of them, who had an inklin of the matter (your Grace will hardly believe it) refused to beg my pardon up∣on her knees, for once neglecting to make my rice-milk.—Pray, consider this, and do your duty, or dread the consequence. I promise you shall have your will six minutes every hour at Aimsbury, and seven in London, while I am in health: but if I happen to be sick, I must govern to a second. Yet properly speaking, there is no man alive with so much truth and respect your Grace's most obedient and devoted servant.</P>

<P>YOU and the Duchess use me very ill, for, I profess, I cannot distinguish the style or the hand-writing of either. I think her Grace writes more like you than herself, and that you write more like her Grace than yourself. I would swear the beginning of your letter writ by the Duchess, though it is to pass for yours; because there is a cursed lie in it, that she is neither young nor healthy, and besides it per∣fectly resembles the part she owns. I will like∣wise swear, that what I must suppose is written by the Duchess, is your hand; and thus I am puzzled and perplexed between you, but I will go on in the innocency of my own heart. I am got eight miles from our famous metropo∣lis, to a country Parson's, to whom I lately gave a City-living, such as an English Chaplain would leap at. I retired hither for the public good, having two great works in hand: One to reduce the whole politeness, wit, humour, and style of England into a short system, for the use of all persons of quality, and particu∣larly the maids of honour <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wagstaff's Dialogues of Polite Conversation,</HI> published in his life time.</NOTE>. The other is of
<PB N="190" REF="208"/>
almost equal importance; I may call it the Whole duty of servants, in about twenty seve∣ral stations, from the steward and waiting-woman down to the scullion and pantry-boy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">An imperfect thing of this kind, called <HI>Directions to servants in general,</HI> has been published since his death.</NOTE>.—I believe no mortal had ever such fair Invi∣tations, as to be happy in the best company of England. I wish I had liberty to print your letter with my own comments upon it. There was a fellow in Ireland, who from a shoe-boy grew to be several times one of the chief go∣vernors, wholly illiterate, and with hardly com∣mon sense: A Lord Lieutenant told the first King George, that he was the greatest subject he had in both kingdoms; and truly this cha∣racter was gotten and preserved by his never ap∣pearing in England, which was the only wise thing he ever did, except purchasing sixteen thousand pounds a year—Why, you need not stare: it is easily apply'd: I must be absent, in order to preserve my credit with her Grace—Lo here comes in the Duchess again (I know her by her d d's; but am a fool for discovering my Art) to defend herself against my conjec∣ture of what she said—Madam, I will imitate your Grace and write to you upon the same line. I own it is a base un-romantic spirit in me, to suspend the honour of waiting at your
<PB N="191" REF="209"/>
Grace's feet, till I can finish a paltry law-suit. It concerns indeed almost all my whole for∣tune; it is equal to half Mr. Pope's, and two thirds of Mr. Gay's, and about six weeks rent of your Grace's. This cursed accident hath drill'd away the whole summer. But, Madam, understand one thing, that I take all your iro∣nical civilities in a literal sense, and whenever I have the honour to attend you, shall expect them to be literally performed: though per∣haps I shall find it hard to prove your hand∣writing in a Court of justice; but that will not be much for your credit. How miserably hath your Grace been mistaken in thinking to avoid Envy by running into exile, where it haunts you more than ever it did even at Court? <HI>Non te civitas, non Regia domus in exilium miserunt, sed tu utrasque.</HI> So says Cicero (as your Grace knows) or so he might have said.</P>
<P>I am told that the Craftsman in one of his papers is offended with the publishers of (I sup∣pose) the last edition of the Dunciad; and I was asked whether you and Mr. Pope were as good friends to the new disgraced person as for∣merly? This I knew nothing of, but suppose it was the consequence of some mistake. As to writing, I look on you just in the prime of life for it, the very season when judgment and invention draw together. But schemes are per∣fectly
<PB N="192" REF="210"/>
accidental; some will appear barren of hints and matter, but prove to be fruitful; and others the contrary: And what you say, is past doubt, that every one can best find hints for himself: though it is possible that sometimes a friend may give you a lucky one just suited to your own imagination. But all this is almost past with me: my invention and judgment are perpetually at fisty-cuffs, till they have quite disabled each other; and the meerest trifles I ever wrote are serious philosophical lucubra∣tions, in comparison to what I now busy myself about; as (to speak in the author's phrase) the world may one day see <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">His ludicrous prediction was, since his death, and very much to his dishonour, seriously fulfilled.</NOTE>.</P>

I know you can find dinners, but you love twelve∣penny coaches too well, without considering that the interest of a whole thousand pounds brings you but half a crown a day. I find a greater longing than ever to come amongst you; and reason good, when I am teazed with Dukes and Duchesses for a visit, all my demands com∣ply'd with, and all excuses cut off. You re∣member, <Q>“O happy Don Quixote! Queens held his horse, and Duchesses pulled off his armour,”</Q> or something to that purpose. He was a mean-spirited fellow; I can say ten times more; O happy, &amp;c. such a Duchess was de∣signed to attend him, and such a Duke invited him to command his Palace. <HI>Nam istos reges ceteros memorare nolo, hominum mendicabula:</HI> go read your Plautus, and observe Strobilus va∣poring after he had found the pot of gold.—I will have nothing to do with that Lady: I have long hated her on your account, and the more, because you are so forgiving as not to hate her; however, she has good qualities enough to make
<PB N="194" REF="212"/>
her esteemed; but not one grain of feeling. I only wish she were a fool.—I have been several months writing near five hundred lines on a pleasant subject, only to tell what my friends and enemies will say on me after I am dead <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This has been published, and is amongst the best of his poems.</NOTE>. I shall finish it soon, for I add two lines every week, and blot out four, and alter eight. I have brought in you and my other friends, as well as enemies and detractors.—It is a great comfort to see how corruption and ill conduct are instrumental in uniting Virtuous persons and Lovers of their country of all denominations: Whig and Tory, High and Low-church, as soon as they are left to think freely, all joining in opinion. If this be disaffection, pray God send me always among the disaffected! and I hear∣tily wish you joy of your scurvy treatment at Court, which hath given you leisure to culti∣vate both public and private Virtue, neither of them likely to be soon met with within the walls of St. James's or Westminster.—But I must here dismiss you, that I may pay my ac∣knowledgments to the Duke for the great ho∣nour he hath done me.</P>

<P>I could have sworn that my Pride would be always able to preserve me from Vanity; of
<PB N="195" REF="213"/>
which I have been in great danger to be guilty for some months past, first by the conduct of my Lady Duchess, and now by that of your Grace, which had like to finish the work: And I should have certainly gone about shew∣ing my letters under the charge of secrecy to every blab of my acquaintance; if I could have the least hope of prevailing on any of them to believe that a man in so obscure a corner, quite thrown out of the present world, and within a few steps of the next, should receive such condescending invitations, from two such per∣sons, to whom he is an utter stranger, and who know no more of him than what they have heard by the partial representations of a friend. But in the mean time, I must desire your Grace not to flatter yourself, that I waited for Your Consent to accept the invitation. I must be ig∣norant indeed not to know, that the Duchess, ever since you met, hath been most politickly employ'd in encreasing those forces, and sharp∣ning those arms with which she subdued you at first, and to which, the braver and the wiser you grow, you will more and more submit. Thus I knew myself on the secure side, and it was a mere piece of good manners to insert that clause, of which you have taken the ad∣vantage. But as I cannot forbear informing your Grace that the Duchess's great secret in
<PB N="196" REF="214"/>
her art of government, hath been to reduce both your wills into one; so I am content, in due observance to the forms of the world, to return my most humble thanks to your Grace for so great a favour as you are pleased to of∣fer me, and which nothing but impossibilities shall prevent me from receiving, since I am, with the greatest reason, truth, and respect, my Lord, your Grace's most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I have consulted all the learned in occult sciences of my acquaintance, and have sate up eleven nights to discover the meaning of those two hieroglyphical lines in your Grace's hand at the bottom of the last Aimsbury letter, but all in vain. Only 'tis agreed, that the language is Coptic, and a very profound Behmist assures me, the style is poetic, containing an invita∣tion from a very great person of the female sex to a strange kind of man whom she never saw; and this is all I can find, which after so many former invitations, will ever confirm me in that respect, wherewith I am, Madam, your Grace's most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>YOU us'd to complain that Mr. Pope and I would not let you speak: you may now be even with me, and take it out in writing. If you don't send to me now and then, the post∣office will think me of no consequence, for I have no correspondent but you. You may keep as far from us as you please, you cannot be for∣gotten by those who ever knew you, and there∣fore please me by sometimes shewing that I am not forgot by you. I have nothing to take me off from my friendship to you: I seek no new acquaintance, and court no favour; I spend no shillings in coaches or chairs to levees or great visits, and, as I don't want the assistance of some that I formerly convers'd with, I will not so much as seem to seek to be a depend∣ant. As to my studies, I have not been en∣tirely idle, though I cannot say that I have yet perfected any thing. What I have done is something in the way of those fables I have al∣ready publish'd. All the money I get is by sav∣ing, so that by habit there may be some hopes (if I grow richer) of my becoming a miser. All
<PB N="198" REF="216"/>
misers have their excuses; the motive to my parsimony is independance. If I were to be represented by the Duchess (she is such a down∣right niggard for me) this character might not be allow'd me; but I really think I am cove∣tous enough for any who lives at the court-end of the town, and who is as poor as myself: for I don't pretend that I am equally saving with S—k. Mr. Lewis desired you might be told that he hath five pounds of yours in his hands, which he fancies you may have forgot, for he will hardly allow that a Verse-man can have a just knowledge of his own affairs. When you got rid of your law-suit, I was in hopes that you had got your own, and was free from every vexation of the law; but Mr. Pope tells me you are not entirely out of your perplexity, though you have the security now in your own pos∣session; but still your case is not so bad as Cap∣tain Gulliver's, who was ruined by having a de∣cree for him with costs. I have had an injunc∣tion for me against pirating-booksellers, which I am sure to get nothing by, and will, I fear, in the end drain me of some money. When I began this prosecution, I fancy'd there would be some end of it; but the law still goes on, and 'tis probable I shall some time or other s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e an Attorney's bill as long as the Book.

<P>You have the good wishes of those I con∣verse with; they know they gratify me, when they remember you; but I really think they do it purely for your own sake. I am sa∣tisfied with the love and friendship of good men, and envy not the demerits of those who are most conspicuously distinguish'd. There∣fore as I set a just value upon your friendship, you cannot please me more than letting me now and then know that you remember me (the on∣ly satisfaction of distant friends!)</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. Mr. Gay's is a good letter, mine will be a very dull one; and yet what you will think the worst of it, is what should be its excuse, that I write in a head-ach that has lasted three days. I am never ill but I think of your ailments, and repine that they mutually hinder our being together: tho' in one point I am apt to differ from you, for you shun your friends when you are in those circumstances, and I desire them; your way is the more generous, mine the more tender. Lady—took your letter very kindly, for I had prepared her to expect no answer un∣der a twelve-month; but kindness perhaps is
<PB N="200" REF="218"/>
a word not applicable to courtiers. However she is an extraordinary woman there, who will do you common justice. For God's sake why all this scruple about Lord B—'s keeping your horses, who has a park; or about my keep∣ing you on a pint of wine a day? We are infi∣nitely richer than you imagine; John Gay shall help me to entertain you, tho' you come like King Lear with fifty knights—Tho' such pro∣spects as I wish, cannot now be formed for fix∣ing you with us, time may provide better be∣fore you part again: the old Lord may die, the benefice may drop, or, at worst, you may carry me into Ireland. You will see a work of Lord B—'s and one of mine; which, with a just neglect of the present age, consult only poste∣rity; and, with a noble scorn of politics, aspire to philosophy. I am glad you resolve to med∣dle no more with the low concerns and interests of Parties, even of Countries (for Countries are but larger parties) <HI>Quid verum atque decens, curare, et rogare, nostrum sit.</HI> I am much pleased with your design upon Rochefoucault's maxim, pray finish it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Poem on his own death, formed upon a maxim of Rochefoucault.</NOTE> I am happy whenever you join our names together: so would Dr. Ar∣buthnot be, but at this time he can be pleas'd with nothing: for his darling son is dying in

I agree with you in my contempt of most popularity, fame, &amp;c. even as a writer I am cool in it, and whenever you see what I am now writing, you'll be convinced I would please but a few, and (if I could) make mankind less Admirers, and greater Rea∣soners<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Poem he means is the <HI>Essay on Man.</HI> But he could never compass his Pur∣pose: His readers would in spite of him <HI>admire</HI> his poe∣try, and would not under∣stand his <HI>reasoning.</HI></NOTE> I study much more to render my own portion of Being easy, and to keep this peevish frame of the human body in good humour.

(such as my late rheumatism) the servants bathe and plaster me, or the surgeon scarifies me, and I bear it, because I must. This is the evil of Nature, not of Fortune.

I sincerely wish my life were past near you, and, such as it is, I would not repine at it.—All you mention remember you, and wish you here.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>May 4, 1732.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now as lame as when you writ your letter, and almost as lame as your letter it∣self, for want of that limb from my Lady Du∣chess, which you promis'd, and without which I wonder how it could limp hither. I am not in a condition to make a true step even on Aims∣bury Downs, and I declare that a corporeal false step is worse than a political one; nay worse than a thousand political ones, for which I ap∣peal to Courts and Ministers, who hobble on and prosper, without the sense of feeling. To talk of riding and walking is insulting me, for I can as soon fly as do either. It is your pride
<PB N="203" REF="221"/>
or laziness, more than chair-hire, that makes the town expensive. No honour is lost by walking in the dark; and in the day, you may beckon a black-guard-boy under a gate, near your visiting place, <HI>(experto crede)</HI> save eleven pence, and get half a crown's worth of health. The worst of my present misfortune is, that I eat and drink, and can digest neither for want of exercise; and, to encrease my misery, the knaves are sure to find me at home, and make huge void spaces in my cellars. I congratulate with you, for losing your Great acquaintance; in such a case, philosophy teaches that we must submit, and be content with Good ones. I like Lord Cornbury's refusing his pension, but I demur at his being elected for Oxford; which, I conceive, is wholly changed; and entirely de∣voted to new principles; so it appeared to me the two last times I was there.</P>
<P>I find by the whole cast of your letter, that you are as giddy and as volatile as ever, just the reverse pf Mr. Pope, who hath always loved a domestic life from his youth. I was going to wish you had some little place that you could call your own, but, I profess, I do not know you well enough to contrive any one system of life that would please you. You pretend to preach up riding and walking to the Dutchess, yet, from
my knowledge of you after twenty years, you
<PB N="204" REF="222"/>
always joined a violent desire of perpetually shifting places and company, with a rooted la∣ziness, and an utter impatience of fatigue. A coach and six horses is the utmost exercise you can bear, and this only when you can fill it with such company as is best suited to your taste, and how glad would you be if it could waft you in the air to avoid jolting? while I, who am so much later in life, can, or at least could, ride 500 miles on a trotting horse. You mortally hate writing, only because it is the thing you chiefly ought to do; as well to keep up the vogue you have in the world, as to make you easy in your fortune: You are merciful to every thing but money, your best friend, whom you treat with inhumanity. Be assured, I will hire people to watch all your motions, and to return me a faithful account. Tell me, have you cured your Absence of mind? can you at∣tend to trifles? can you at Aimsbury write do∣mestic libels to divert the family and neigh∣bouring squires for five miles round? or ven∣ture so far on horseback, without apprehend∣ing a stumble at every step? can you set the foot-men a laughing as they wait at dinner? and do the Duchess's women admire your wit? in what esteem are you with the Vicar of the parish? can you play with him at back-gam∣mon? have the farmers sound out that you can∣not
<PB N="205" REF="223"/>
distinguish rye from barley, or an oak from a crab-tree? You are sensible that I know the full extent of your country skill is in fishing for Roaches, or Gudgeons at the highest.</P>
<P>I love to do you good offices with your friends, and therefore desire you will show this letter to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chess, to improve her Grace's good opinion of your qualifications, and con∣vince her how useful you are like to be in the fa∣mily. Her Grace shall have the honour of my correspondence again when she goes to Aims∣bury. Hear a piece of Irish news, I buried the famous General Meredyth's father last night in my Cathedral, he was ninety-six years old: so that Mrs. Pope may live seven years longer. You saw Mr. Pope in health, pray is he gene∣rally more healthy than when I was amongst you? I would know how your own health is, and how much wine you drink in a day? My stint in company is a pint at noon, and half as much at night, but I often dine at home like a hermit, and then I drink little or none at all. Yet I differ from you, for I would have so∣ciety, if I could get what I like, people of mid∣dle understanding, and middle rank.</P>

<P>I Had your letter by Mr. Ryves a long time after the date, for I suppose he stayed long in the way. I am glad you determine upon something; there is no writing I esteem more than Fables, nor any thing so difficult to suc∣ceed in, which however you have done ex∣cellently well, and I have often admir'd your happiness in such a kind of performances which I have frequently endeavour'd at in vain. I remember I acted as you seem to hint; I found a Moral first and studied for a Fable, but could do nothing that pleased me, and so left off that scheme for ever. I remember one, which was to represent what scoundrels rise in Armies by a long War, wherein I suppos'd the Lion was engaged, and having lost all his animals of worth, at last Serjeant Hog came to be Briga∣deer, and Corporal Ass a Colonel, &amp;c. I agree with you likewise about getting something by the stage, which, when it succeeds, is the best crop for poetry in England: But, pray, take some new scheme, quite different from any thing you have already touched. The present humour of the players, who hardly (as I was
<PB N="207" REF="225"/>
told in London) regard any new play, and your present situation at the Court, are the difficul∣ties to be overcome; but those circumstances may have altered (at least the former) since I left you. My scheme was to pass a month at Aimsbury, and then go to Twickenham, and live a winter between that and Dawley, and sometimes at Riskins, without going to Lon∣don, where I now can have no occasional lodg∣ings: But I am not yet in any condition for such removals. I would fain have you get enough against you grow old, to have two or three servants about you and a convenient house. It is hard to want those <HI>subsidia senec∣tuti,</HI> when a man grows hard to please, and few people care whether he be pleased or no. I have a large house, yet I should hardly pre∣vail to find one visiter, if I were not able to hire him with a bottle of wine: so that, when I am not abroad on horseback, I generally dine alone, and am thankful, if a friend will pass the evening with me. I am now with the re∣mainder of my pint before me, and so here's your health—and the second and chief is to my Tunbridge acquaintance, my Lady Du∣chess—and I tell you that I fear my Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Pope (a couple of Philo∣sophers) would starve me, for even of port wine I should require half a pint a day, and as
<PB N="208" REF="226"/>
much at night: and you were growing as bad, unless your Duke and Duchess have mended you. Your colic is owing to intemperance of the philosophical kind; you eat without care, and if you drink less than I, you drink too little. But your Inattention I cannot pardon, because I imagined the cause was removed, for I thought it lay in your forty millions of schemes by Court-hopes and Court-fears. Yet Mr. Pope has the same defect, and it is of all others the most mortal to conversation; neither is my Lord Bolingbroke untinged with it: all for want of my rule, <HI>Vive la bagatelle!</HI> but the Doctor is the King of Inattention. What a vexatious life should I lead among you? If the Duchess be a <HI>reveuse,</HI> I will never come to Aimsbury; or, if I do, I will run away from you both, to one of her women, and the steward and chaplain.</P>

<P>I mentioned something to Mr. Gay of a Tunbridge-acquaintance, whom we forget of course when we return to town, and yet I am assured that if they meet again next summer, they have a better title to resume their com∣merce. Thus I look on my right of corre∣sponding with your Grace to be better esta∣blish'd upon your return to Aimsbury; and I
<PB N="209" REF="227"/>
shall at this time descend to forget, or at least suspend my resentments of your neglect all the time you were in London. I still keep in my heart, that Mr. Gay had no sooner turned his back, than you left the place in his letter void which he had commanded you to fill: though your guilt confounded you so far, that you wanted presence of mind to blot out the last line, where that command stared you in the face. But it is my misfortune to quarrel with all my acquaintance, and always come by the worst; and fortune is ever against me, but ne∣ver so much as by pursuing me out of mere partiality to your Grace, for which you are to answer. By your connivance, she hath pleas∣ed, by one stumble on the stairs, to give me a lameness that six months have not been able perfectly to cure: and thus I am prevented from revenging myself by continuing a month at Aimsbury, and breeding confusion in your Grace's family. No disappointment through my whole life hath been so vexatious by many degrees; and God knows whether I shall ever live to see the invisible Lady to whom I was obliged for so many favours, and whom I ne∣ver beheld since she was a bratt in hanging∣sleeves. I am, and shall be ever, with the greatest respect and gratitude, Madam, your Grace's most obedient, and most humble, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Know not what to say to the account of your stewardship, and it is monstrous to me that the South-sea should pay half their debts at one clap. But I will send for the money when you put me into the way, for I shall want it here, my affairs being in a bad condi∣tion by the miseries of the kingdom, and my own private fortune being wholly embroiled, and worse than ever; so that I shall soon peti∣tion the Duchess, as an object of charity, to lend me three or four thousand pounds to keep up my dignity. My one hundred pound will buy me six hogsheads of wine, which will sup∣port me a year; <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>visae frugis in annum Copia.</HI> Horace desired no more; for I will construe <HI>frugis</HI> to be wine. You are young enough to get some lucky hint, which must come by chance, and it shall be a thing of importance, <HI>quod &amp; hunc in annum vivat &amp; in plures,</HI> and you shall not finish it in haste, and it shall be diverting, and usefully satirical, and the Du∣chess shall be your critic; and betwixt you and me, I do not find she will grow weary of you till this time seven years. I had lately an offer
<PB N="211" REF="229"/>
to change for an English living, which is just too short by 300<HI>l.</HI> a year: and that must be made up out of the Duchess's pin-money be∣fore I can consent. I want to be Minister of Aimsbury, Dawley, Twickenham, Riskins, and Prebendary of Westminster, else I will not stir a step, but content myself with making the Duchess miserable three months next sum∣mer. But I keep ill company: I mean the Duchess and you, who are both out of favour; and so I find am I, by a few verses wherein Pope and you have your parts. You hear Dr. D—y has got a wife with 1600<HI>l.</HI> a year; I, who am his governor, cannot take one under two thousand; I wish you would enquire of such a one in your neighbourhood. See what it is to write godly books! I profess I envy you above all men in England; you want nothing but three thousand pounds more, to keep you in plenty when your friends grow weary of you. To prevent which last evil at Aimsbury, you must learn to domineer and be peevish, to find fault with their victuals and drink, to chide and direct the servants, with some other lessons, which I shall teach you, and always practised myself with success. I believe I formerly de∣sired to know whether the Vicar of Aimsbury can play at back-gammon? pray ask him the question, and give him my service.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I was the most unwary creature in the world, when, against my old maxims, I writ first to you upon your return to Tunbridge. I beg that this condescension of mine may go no farther, and that you will not pretend to make a prece∣dent of it. I never knew any man cured of any Inattention, although the pretended causes were removed. When I was with Mr. Gay last in London, talking with him on some poetical subjects, he would answer; <Q>“Well, I am de∣termined not to accept the employment of Gentleman-usher:”</Q> and of the same dispo∣sition were all my poetical friends, and if you cannot cure him, I utterly despair.—As to yourself, I will say to you (though comparisons be odious) what I said to the—, that your qua∣lity should be never any motive of esteem to me: My compliment was then lost, but it will not be so to you. For I know you more by any one of your letters than I could by six months conversing. Your pen is always more natural and sincere and unaffected than your tongue; in writing you are too lazy to give yourself the trouble of acting a part, and have indeed acted so indiscreetly that I have you at mercy; and although you should arrive to such
<PB N="213" REF="231"/>
a height of immorality as to deny your hand, yet, whenever I produce it, the world will unite in swearing this must come from you only.</P>
<P>I will answer your question. Mr. Gay is not discreet enough to live alone, but he is too discreet to live alone; and yet (unless you mend him) he will live alone even in your Grace's company. Your quarrelling with each other upon the subject of bread and butter, is the most usual thing in the world; Parliaments, Courts, Cities, and Kingdoms quarrel for no other cause; from hence, and from hence only arise all the quarrels between Whig and To∣ry; between those who are in the Ministry, and those who are out; between all pretenders to employment in the Church, the Law, and the Army: even the common proverb teaches you this, when we say, It is none of my bread and butter, meaning it is no business of mine. Therefore I despair of any reconcilement be∣tween you till the affair of bread and butter be adjusted, wherein I would gladly be a media∣tor. If Mahomet should come to the moun∣tain, how happy would an excellent lady be, who lives a few miles from this town? As I was telling of Mr. Gay's way of living at Aimsbury, she offer'd fifty guineas to have you both at her house for one hour over a bottle of Burgundy, which we were then drinking. To
<PB N="214" REF="232"/>
your question I answer, that your Grace should pull me by the sleeve till you tore it off, and when you said you were weary of me, I would pretend to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaf, and think (according to an∣other proverb) that you tore my cloaths to keep me from going. I never will believe one word you say of my Lord Duke, unless I see three or four lines in his own hand at the bottom of yours. I have a concern in the whole family, and Mr. Gay must give me a particular ac∣count of every branch, for I am not ashamed of you tho' you be Duke and Duchess, tho' I have been of others who are, &amp;c. and I do not doubt but even your own servants love you, even down to your postilions; and when I come to Aimsbury, before I see your Grace I will have an hour's conversation with the Vicar, who will tell me how familiarly you talk to Goody Dobson and all the neighbours, as if you were their equal, and that you were god∣mother to her son Jacky.</P>

<P>I Usually write to friends after a pause of a few weeks, that I may not interrupt them in better company, better thoughts, and better diversions. I believe, I have told you of a great Man, who said to me, that he never once in his life receiv'd a good letter from Ireland: for which there are reasons enough without affront∣ing our understandings. For there is not one person out of this country, who regards any events that pass here, unless he hath an estate or employment.—I cannot tell that you or I ever gave the least provocation to the present Ministry, and much less to the Court; and yet I am ten times more out of favour than you. For my own part, I do not see the politic of opening common letters, directed to persons generally known: for a man's understanding would be very weak to convey secrets by the post, if he knew any, which, I declare, I do not: and besides I think the world is already so well informed by plain events, that I question whether the Ministers have any secrets at all. Neither would I be under any apprehension if a letter should be sent me full of treason; be∣cause I cannot hinder people from writing what
<PB N="216" REF="234"/>
they please, nor sending it to me; and although it should be discover'd to have been open'd be∣fore it came to my hand, I would only burn it and think no further. I approve of the scheme you have to grow somewhat richer, though, I agree, you will meet with discouragements; and it is reasonable you should, considering what kind of pens are at this time only em∣ployed and encouraged. For you must allow that the bad painter was in the right, who, hav∣ing painted a cock, drove away all the cocks and hens and even the chickens, for fear those who passed by his shop might make a compa∣rison with his work. And I will say one thing in spite of the Post-officers, that since Wit and Learning began to be made use of in our king∣doms, they were never professedly thrown aside, contemned, and punished, till within your own memory; nor Dulness and Igno∣rance ever so openly encouraged and promoted. In answer to what you say of my living among you, if I could do it to my ease; perhaps you have heard of a scheme for an exchange in Berkshire proposed by two of our friends; but, besides the difficulty of adjusting certain cir∣cumstances, it would not answer. I am at a time of life that seeks ease and independence; you'll hear my reasons when you see those friends, and I concluded them with saying;
<PB N="217" REF="235"/>
That I would rather be a freeman among slaves, than a slave among freemen. The dig∣nity of my present station damps the pertness of inferior puppies and squires, which, without plenty and ease on your side the channel, would break my heart in a month.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>See what it is to live where I do. I am ut∣terly ignorant of that same Strado del Poe; and yet, if that Author be against lending or giving money, I cannot but think him a good Courtier; which, I am sure, your Grace is not, no not so much as to be a Maid of honour. For I am certainly informed, that you are neither a free∣thinker, nor can sell bargains; that you can neither spell, nor talk, nor write, nor think like a Courtier; than you pretend to be respect∣ed for qualities which have been out of fashion ever since you were almost in your cradle; that your contempt for a fine petticoat is an infallible mark of disaffection; which is further confirm∣ed by your ill taste for Wit, in preferring two old-fashion'd poets before Duck or Cibber. Besides, you spell in such a manner as no court∣lady can read, and write in such an old-fashion∣ed style, as none of them can understand.—You need not be in pain about Mr. Gay's stock of health. I promise you he will spend it all
<PB N="218" REF="236"/>
upon laziness, and run deep in debt by a win∣ter's repose in town; therefore I entreat your Grace will order him to move his chops less and his legs more for the six cold months, else he will spend all his money in physic and coach∣hire. I am in much perplexity about your Grace's declaration, of the manner in which you dispose what you call your love and respect, which, you say, are not paid to Merit but to your own Humour. Now, Madam, my m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣fortune is, that I have nothing to plead but abundance of Merit, and there goes an ugly observation, that the Humour of ladies is apt to change. Now, Madam, if I should go to Aimsbury with a great load of merit, and your Grace happen to be out of humour, and will not purchase my merchandize at the price of your respect, the goods may be damaged, and no body else will take them off my hands. Be∣sides, you have declared Mr. Gay to hold the first part, and I but the second; which is hard treatment, since I shall be the newest acquaint∣ance by some years; and I will appeal to all the rest of your sex, whether such an innovation ought to be allowed? I should be ready to say in the common forms, that I was much obliged to the Lady who wish'd she could give the best living, &amp;c. if I did not vehemently suspect it was the very same Lady who spoke many
<PB N="219" REF="237"/>
things to me in the same style, and also with regard to the gentleman at your elbow when you writ, whose Dupe he was, as well as of her Waiting-woman; but they were both ar∣rant knaves, as I told him and a third friend, though they will not believe it to this day. I desire to present my most humble respects to my Lord Duke, and with my heartiest prayer for the prosperity of the whole family, remain your Grace's, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Doubt, habit hath little power to reconcile us with sickness attended by pain. With me, the lowness of spirits hath a most unhappy effect; I am grown less patient with solitude, and harder to be pleas'd with company; which I could formerly better digest, when I could be easier without it than at present. As to send∣ing you any thing that I have written since I left you (either verse or prose) I can only say, that I have order'd by my Will, that all my Papers of any kind shall be deliver'd you to dis∣pose of as you please. I have several things
<PB N="220" REF="238"/>
that I have had schemes to finish, or to attempt, but I very foolishly put off the trouble, as sin∣ners do their repentance: for I grow every day more averse from writing, which is very na∣tural, and, when I take a pen, say to myself a thousand times, <HI>non est tanti.</HI> As to those pa∣pers of four or five years past, that you are pleas'd to require soon; they consist of little accidental things writ in the country; family amusements, never intended further than to divert ourselves and some neighbours: or some effects of anger on Public Grievances here, which would be insignificant out of this king∣dom. Two or three of us had a fancy, three years ago, to write a Weekly paper, and call it an Intelligencer. But it continued not long; for the whole Volume (it was re-printed in Lon∣don, and, I find, you have seen it) was the work only of two, myself and Dr. Sheridan. If we could have got some ingenious young man to have been the manager, who should have pub∣lished all that might be sent to him, it might have continued longer, for there were hints enough. But the Printer here could not afford such a young man one farthing for his trouble, the sale being so small, and the price one half∣penny; and so it dropt. In the Volume you saw (to answer your questions) the 1, 3, 5, 7, were mine. Of the 8th I writ only the Verses,
<PB N="221" REF="239"/>
(very uncorrect, but against a fellow we all hated) the 9th mine, the 10th only the Verses, and of those not the four last slovenly lines; the 15th is a Pamphlet of mine printed before with Dr. Sh—'s Preface, merely for laziness not to disappoint the town; and so was the 19th, which contains only a parcel of facts re∣lating purely to the miseries of Ireland, and wholly useless and unentertaining. As to other things of mine since I left you; there are in prose a View of the State of Ireland; a Project for eating Children; and a Defence of Lord Carteret; in verse a Libel on Dr. D—and Lord Carteret; a Letter to Dr. D—on the Libels writ against him; the Barrack (a stolen Copy) the Lady's Journal; the Lady's Dress∣ing-room (a stolen Copy) the Plea of the Damn'd (a stolen Copy;) all these have been printed in London. (I forgot to tell you that the Tale of Sir Ralph was sent from England.) Be∣sides these there are five or six (perhaps more) Papers of Verses writ in the North, but per∣fect Family-things, two or three of which may be tolerable; the rest but indifferent, and the humour only local, and some that would give offence to the times. Such as they are, I will bring them, tolerable or bad, if I recover this lameness, and live long enough to see you ei∣ther here or there. I forget again to tell you,
<PB N="222" REF="240"/>
that the Scheme of paying Debts by a Tax on Vices, is not one syllable mine, but of a young Clergy-man whom I countenance; he told me it was built upon a passage in Gulliver, where a Projector hath something upon the same Thought. This young Man is the most hope∣ful we have: a book of his Poems was printed in London; Dr. D—is one of his Patrons: he is marry'd and has children, and makes up about 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year, on which he lives decent∣ly. The utmost stretch of his ambition is, to gather up as much superfluous money as will give him a sight of you, and half an hour of your presence; after which he will return home in full satisfaction, and in proper time die in peace.</P>
<P>My poetical fountain is drain'd, and I pro∣fess, I grow gradually so dry, that a Rhime with me is almost as hard to find as a Guinea; and even Prose speculations tire me almost as much. Yet I have a thing in prose, begun above twen∣ty-eight years ago, and almost finish'd. It will make a four-shilling Volume, and is such a perfection of folly, that you shall never hear of it till it is printed, and then you shall be left to guess <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polite Conversation.</NOTE>. Nay I have another of the same age, which will require a long time to perfect, and is worse than the former, in which I will serve
<PB N="223" REF="241"/>
you the same way. I heard lately from Mr.—, who promises to be less lazy in order to mend his fortune. But women who live by their beauty, and men by their wit, are seldom pro∣vident enough to consider that both Wit and Beauty will go off with years, and there is no living upon the credit of what is past.</P>
<P>I am in great concern to hear of my Lady Bolingbroke's ill health returned upon her, and, I doubt, my Lord will find Dawley too solitary without her. In that, neither he nor you are companions young enough for me, and, I be∣lieve, the best part of the reason why men are said to grow children when they are old, is because they cannot entertain themselves with thinking; which is the very case of little boys and girls, who love to be noisy among their play-fellows. I am told Mrs. Pope is without pain, and I have not heard of a more gentle decay, without uneasiness to herself or friends; yet I cannot but pity you, who are ten times the greater sufferer, by having the person you most love, so long before you, and dying daily; and I pray God it may not affect your mind or your health.</P>

<P>IT is not a time to complain that you have not answered me two letters (in the last of which I was impatient under some fears:) It is not now indeed a time to think of myself, when one of the nearest and longest tyes I have ever had, is broken all on a sudden, by the unexpected death of poor Mr. Gay. An in∣flammatory fever hurried him out of this life in three days. He died last night at nine o'clock, not deprived of his senses entirely at last, and possessing them perfectly till within five hours. He asked of you a few hours before, when in acute torment by the inflammation in his bowels and breast. His effects are in the Duke of Queensbury's custody. His sisters, we sup∣pose, will be his heirs, who are two widows; as yet it is not known whether or no he left a will.—Good God! how often are we to die before we go quite off this stage?

<P>I shall never see you now, I believe; one of your principal calls to England is at an end. Indeed he was the most amiable by far, his qualities were the gentlest; but I love you as well and as firmly. Would to God the man we have lost had not been so amiable, nor so good! but that's a wish for our own sakes, not for his. Sure if Innocence and Integrity can deserve Happiness, it must be his.

and, I believe, at last a mortification of the bowels; it was the most precipitate case I ever knew, having cut him off in three days. He was attended by two Physicians besides my∣self.

<P>I Received yours with a few lines from the Doctor, and the account of our losing Mr. Gay, upon which event I shall say nothing. I am only concern'd that long living hath not hardened me: for even in this kingdom, and in a few days past, two persons of great merit, whom I loved very well, have died in the prime of their years, but a little above thirty. I would endeavour to comfort myself upon the loss of friends, as I do upon the loss of money; by turning to my account-book, and seeing whether I have enough left for my support; but in the former case I find I have not, any
<PB N="227" REF="245" MS="y"/>
more than in the other; and I know not any man who is in a greater likelyhood than my∣self to die poor and friendless. You are a much greater loser than me by his death, as being a more intimate friend, and often his compa∣nion; which latter I could never hope to be, except perhaps once more in my life for a piece of a summer. I hope he hath left you the care of any writings he may have left, and I wish, that, with those already extant, they could be all published in a fair edition under your in∣spection. Your Poem on the Use of Riches hath been just printed here, and we have no objection but the obscurity of several passages by our ignorance in facts and persons, which makes us lose abundance of the Satire. Had the printer given me notice, I would have ho∣nestly printed the names at length, where I happened to know them; and writ explanatory notes, which however would have been but few, for my long absence hath made me igno∣rant of what passes out of the scene where I am. I never had the least hint from you about this work, any more than of your former, upon Taste. We are told here, that you are pre∣paring other pieces of the same bulk to be in∣scribed to other friends, one (for instance) to my Lord Bolingbroke, another to Lord Ox∣ford, and so on.—Doctor Delany presents you
<PB N="228" REF="246"/>
his most humble service: he behaves himself very commendably, converses only with his former friends, makes no parade, but enter∣tains them constantly at an elegant plentiful ta∣ble, walks the streets as usual, by day-light, does many acts of charity and generosity, culti∣vates a country-house two miles distant, and is one of those very few within my knowledge, on whom a great access of fortune hath made no manner of change. And particularly he is often without money, as he was before. We have got my Lord Orrery among us, being forced to continue here on the ill condition of his estate by the knavery of an Agent; he is a most worthy Gentleman, whom, I hope, you will be acquainted with. I am very much obliged by your favour to Mr. P—, which, I desire, may continue no longer than he shall de∣serve by his Modesty, a virtue I never knew him to want, but is hard for young men to keep, without abundance of ballast. If you are acquainted with the Duchess of Queens∣bury, I desire you will present her my most humble service: I think she is a greater loser by the death of a friend than either of us. She seems a Lady of excellent sense and spirit. I had often Postscripts from her in our friend's letters to me, and her part was sometimes longer than his, and they made up a great part of the
<PB N="229" REF="247"/>
little happiness I could have here. This was the more generous, because I never saw her since she was a girl of five years old, nor did I envy poor Mr. Gay for any thing so much as being a domestic friend to such a Lady. I de∣sire you will never fail to send me a particular account of your health. I dare hardly enquire about Mrs. Pope, who, I am told, is but just among the living, and consequently a continual grief to you: she is sensible of your tenderness, which robs her of the only happiness she is capable of enjoying. And yet I pity you more than her; you cannot lengthen her days, and I beg she may not shorten yours.</P>

<P>IT is indeed impossible to speak on such a a subject as the loss of Mr. Gay, to me an irreparable one. But I send you what I intend for the inscription on his tomb, which the Duke of Queensbury will set up at Westmin∣ster. As to his writings, he left no Will, nor spoke a word of them, or any thing else, dur∣ing his short and precipitate illness, in which I attended him to his last breath. The Duke
<PB N="230" REF="248"/>
has acted more than the part of a brother to him, and it will be strange if the sisters do not leave his papers totally to his disposal, who will do the same that I would with them. He has managed the Comedy (which our poor friend gave to the playhouse the week before his death) to the utmost advantage for his rela∣tions; and proposes to do the same with some Fables he left finished.</P>
<P>There is nothing of late which I think of more than Mortality, and what you mention, of collecting the best monuments we can of our friends, their own images in their writings: (for those are the best, when their minds are such as Mr. Gay's was, and as yours is.) I am preparing also for my own, and have nothing so much at heart, as to shew the silly world that men of Wit, or even Poets, may be the most moral of mankind. A few loose things sometimes fall from them, by which censorious fools judge as ill of them as possibly they can, for their own comfort: and indeed, when such unguarded and trifling <HI>Jeux d' E∣spirit</HI> have once got abroad, all that prudence or repentance can do, since they cannot be de∣ny'd, is to put 'em fairly upon that foot; and teach the public (as we have done in the pre∣face to the four volumes of Miscellanies) to di∣stinguish betwixt our studies and our idlenesses,
<PB REF="249" MS="y"/>
<PB N="231" REF="250" MS="y"/>
our works and our weaknesses. That was the whole end of the last Vol. of Miscellanies, with∣out which our former declaration in that pre∣face, "That these volumes contained all that "we have ever offended in that way," would have been discredited. It went indeed to my heart, to omit what you called the Libel on Dr. D—, and the best Panegyric on myself, that either my own times or any other could have afforded, or will ever afford to me. The book as you observe, was printed in great haste; the cause whereof was, that the booksellers here were doing the same, in collecting your pieces, the corn with the chaff; I don't mean that any thing of yours is chaff, but with other wit of Ireland which was so, and the whole in your name. I meant principally to oblige them to separate what you writ seriously from what you writ carelessly; and thought my own weeds might pass for a sort of wild flowers, when bun∣dled up with them.</P>
<P>It was I that sent you those books into Ire∣land, and so I did my Epistle to Lord Bathurst even before it was publish'd, and another thing of mine, which is a<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sat. i. Lib. ii.</NOTE> Parody from Horace, writ in two mornings. I never took more care in my life of any thing than of the former of these, nor less than of the latter: yet every
<PB N="232" REF="251"/>
friend has forced me to print it, tho' in truth my own single motive was about twenty lines toward the latter end, which you will find out.</P>
<P>I have declined opening to you by letters the whole scheme of my present Work, expecting still to do it in a better manner in person: but you will see pretty soon, that the letter to Lord Bathurst is a part of it, and you will find a plain connexion between them, if you read them in the order just contrary to that they were pub∣lish'd in. I imitate those cunning tradesmen, who show their best silks last; or (to give you a truer idea, tho' it sounds too proudly) my works will in one respect be like the works of Nature, much more to be liked and under∣stood when consider'd in the relation they bear with each other, than when ignorantly look'd upon one by one; and often, those parts which attract most at first sight, will appear to be not the most, but the least considerable <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the first note on the Epistle to Lord Cobham, <HI>Of the Knowledge and Characters of men.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am pleas'd and flatter'd by your expression of <HI>Orna me.</HI> The chief pleasure this work can give me is, that I can in it, with propriety, de∣cency, and justice, insert the name and charac∣ter of every friend I have, and every man that deserves to be lov'd or adorn'd. But I smile
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
at your applying that phrase to my visiting you in Ireland; a place where I might have some apprehension (from their extraordinary passion for Poetry, and their boundless Hospitality) of being <HI>adorned</HI> to death, and buried under the weight of garlands, like one I have read of somewhere or other. My Mother lives (which is an answer to that point) and, I thank God, tho' her memory be in a manner gone, is yet awake and sensible to me, tho' scarce to any thing else; which doubles the reason of my attend∣ance, and at the same time sweetens it. I wish (beyond any other wish) you could pass a sum∣mer here; I might (too probably) return with you, unless you preferr'd to see France first, to which country, I think, you would have a strong invitation. Lord Peterborow has narrowly es∣caped death, and yet keeps his chamber: he is perpetually speaking in the most affectionate manner of you: he has written you two letters, which you never received, and by that has been discouraged from writing more. I can well believe the post-office may do this, when some letters of his to me have met the same fate, and two of mine to him. Yet let not this discourage you from writing to me, or to him inclos'd in the common way, as I do to you: Innocent men need fear no detection of their thoughts; and for my part, I wou'd give 'em
<PB N="234" REF="253"/>
free leave to send all I write to Curll, if most of what I write was not too silly.</P>
<P>I desire my sincere services to Dr. Delany, who, I agree, with you is a man every way e∣steemable: my Lord Orrery is a most virtuous and good-natur'd Nobleman, whom I should be happy to know. Lord B. receiv'd your let∣ter thro' my hands; it is not to be told you how much he wishes for you: The whole list of persons, to whom you sent your services, re∣turn you theirs, with proper sense of the di∣stinction—Your Lady friend is <HI>Semper Eadem,</HI> and I have written an Epistle to her on that qua∣lification in a female character; which is thought by my chief Critic in your absence to be my <HI>Chef d'Oeuvre:</HI> but it cannot be printed perfectly, in an age so sore of Satire, and so wil∣ling to misapply Characters.</P>
<P>As to my own health, it is as good as usual. I have lain ill seven days of a slight fever (the complaint here) but recover'd by gentle sweats, and the care of Dr. Arbuthnot. The play Mr. Gay left succeeds very well; it is another ori∣ginal in its kind. Adieu. God preserve your life, your health, your limbs, your spirits, and your friendships!</P>

<P>YOU say truly, that death is only terrible to us as it separates us from those we love, but I really think those have the worst of it who are left by us, if we are true friends. I have felt more (I fancy) in the loss of Mr. Gay, than I shall suffer in the thought of going away myself into a state that can feel none of this sort of losses. I wish'd vehemently to have seen him in a condition of living independent, and to have lived in perfect indolence the rest of our days together, the two most idle, most in∣nocent, undesigning Poets of our age. I now as vehemently wish you and I might walk into the grave together, by as slow steps as you please, but contentedly and chearfully: Whe∣ther that ever can be, or in what country, I know no more, than into what country we shall walk out of the grave. But it suffices me to know it will be exactly what region or state our Maker appoints, and that whatever <HI>Is,</HI> is <HI>Right.</HI> Our poor friend's papers are partly in my hands, and for as much as is so, I will take care to suppress things unworthy of him. As to the Epitaph, I'm sorry you gave a copy, for
<PB N="236" REF="255"/>
it will certainly by that means come into print, and I would correct it more, unless you will do it for me (and that I shall like as well:) Upon the whole, I earnestly wish your coming over hither, for this reason among many others, that your influence may be join'd with mine to suppress whatever we may judge proper of his papers. To be plunged in my Neighbour's and my papers, will be your inevitable fate as soon as you come. That I am an author whose characters are thought of some weight, ap∣pears from the great noise and bustle that the Court and Town make about any I give: and I will not render them less important, or less interesting, by sparing Vice and Folly, or by betraying the cause of Truth and Virtue. I will take care they shall be such, as no man can be angry at but the persons I would have angry. You are sensible with what decency and justice I paid homage to the Royal Fami∣ly, at the same time that I satirized false Cour∣tiers, and Spies, &amp;c. about 'em. I have not the courage however to be such a Satirist as you, but I would be as much, or more, a Phi∣losopher. You call your satires, Libels; I would rather call my satires, Epistles: They will consist more of Morality than of Wit, and grow graver, which you will call duller. I shall leave it to my Antagonists to be witty (if they
<PB N="237" REF="256"/>
can) and content myself to be useful, and in the right. Tell me your opinion as to Lady—'s or Lord *'s performance? they are certainly the Top-wits of the Court, and you may judge by that single piece what can be done against me; for it was labour'd, corrected, prae-com∣mended and post-disapprov'd, so far as to be dis-own'd by themselves, after each had highly cry'd it up for the others <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Epistle written on this occasion at the end of the second Vol. of Letters.</NOTE>. I have met with some complaints, and heard at a distance of some threats, occasion'd by my verses: I sent fair messages to acquaint them where I was to be found in town, and to offer to call at their houses to satisfy them, and so it dropp'd. It is very poor in any one to rail and threaten at a distance, and have nothing to say to you when they see you.—I am glad you persist and abide by so good a thing as that Poem <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The ironical libel on Dr. Delany.</NOTE>, in which I am immortal for my Morality: I never took any praise so kindly, and yet, I think, I deserve that praise better than I do any other. When does your collection come out, and what will it consist of? I have but last week finished an∣other of my Epistles, in the order of the system; and this week <HI>(exercitandi gratia)</HI> I have trans∣lated
<PB N="238" REF="257"/>
(or rather parody'd) another of Horace's, in which I introduce you advising me about my expences, housekeeping, &amp;c. But these things shall lie by, till you come to carp at 'em, and alter rhymes, and grammar, and triplets, and cacophonies of all kinds. Our Parliament will sit till Midsummer, which, I hope, may be a motive to bring you rather in summer than so late as autumn: you us'd to love what I hate, a hurry of politics, &amp;c. Courts I see not, Cour∣tiers I know not, Kings I adore not, Queens I compliment not; so I am never like to be in fashion, nor in dependance. I heartily join with you in pitying our poor Lady for her un∣happiness, and should only pity her more, if she had more of what they at Court call Hap∣piness. Come then, and perhaps we may go all together into France at the end of the sea∣son, and compare the Liberties of both king∣doms. Adieu.

<P>I Answer your Letter the sooner because I have a particular reason for doing so. Some weeks ago came over a Poem call'd, <HI>The Life and Character of Dr.</HI> S. <HI>written by himself.</HI> It was reprinted here, and is dedicated to you. It is grounded upon a Maxim in Rochefoucault, and the dedication, after a formal story, says, that my manner of writing is to be found in every line. I believe I have told you, that I writ a year or two ago near five hundred lines upon the same Maxim in Rochefoucault, and was a long time about it, as that Impostor says in his Dedication, with many circumstances, all pure invention. I desire you to believe, and to tell my friends, that in this spurious piece there is not a single line, or bit of a line, or thought, any way resembling the genuine Copy, any more than it does Virgil's Aeneis; for I never gave a Copy of mine, nor lent it out of my sight. And although I shew'd it to all common ac∣quaintance indifferently, and some of them (especially one or two females) had got many lines by heart, here and there, and repeated
<PB N="240" REF="259"/>
them often; yet it happens that not one single line, or thought is contained in this Imposture, although it appears that they who counterseited me, had heard of the true one. But even this trick shall not provoke me to print the true one, which indeed is not proper to be seen, till I can be seen no more: I therefore desire you will un∣deceive my friends, and I will order an Adver∣tisement to be printed here, and transmit it to England, that every body may know the delu∣sion, and acquit me, as, I am sure, you must have done yourself, if you have read any part of it, which is mean, and trivial, and full of that Cant that I most despise: I would sink to be a Vicar in Norfolk rather than be charged with such a performance. Now I come to your letter.</P>
<P>When I was of your age, I thought every day of death, but now every minute; and a continual giddy disorder more or less is a greater addition than that of my years. I cannot af∣firm that I pity our friend Gay, but I pity his friends, I pity you, and would at least equally pity myself, if I liv'd amongst you; because I should have seen him oftner than you did, who are a kind of Hermit, how great a noise soever you make by your Ill nature in not letting the honest Villains of the times enjoy themselves in this world, which is their only happiness, and
<PB N="241" REF="260"/>
terrifying them with another. I should have added in my libel, that of all men living you are the most happy in your Enemies and your Friends: and I will swear you have fifty times more Charity for manking than I could ever pretend to. Whether the production you men∣tion came from the Lady or the Lord, I did not imagine that they were at least so bad versifyers. Therefore, <HI>facit indignatio versus,</HI> is only to be apply'd when the indignation is against general Villainy, and never operates when some sort of people write to defend themselves. I love to hear them reproach you for dulness; only I would be satisfy'd, since you are so dull, why are they so angry? Give me a shilling, and I will ensure you, that posterity shall never know you had one single enemy, excepting those whose memory you have preserv'd.</P>
<P>I am sorry for the situation of Mr. Gay's pa∣pers. You do not exert yourself as much as I could wish in this affair. I had rather the two sisters were hang'd than see his works swell'd by any loss of credit to his memory. I would be glad to see the most valuable printed by themselves, those which ought not to be seen burn'd immediately, and the others that have gone abroad, printed separately like opuscula, or rather be stifled and forgotten. I thought your Epitaph was immediately to be ingrav'd,
<PB N="242" REF="261" MS="y"/>
and therefore I made less scruple to give a Copy to Lord Orrery, who earnestly desir'd it, but to no body else; and, he tells me, he gave only two, which he will recall. I have a short Epi∣gram of his upon it, wherein I would correct a line, or two at most, and then I will send it you (with his permission.) I have nothing against yours, but the last line, <HI>Striking their aching;</HI> the two participles, as they are so near, seem to sound too like. I shall write to the Duchess, who hath lately honoured me with a very friendly letter, and I will tell her my opinion freely about our friend's papers. I want health, and my affairs are enlarged: but I will break through the latter, if the other mends. I can use a course of medicines, lame and giddy. My chief design, next to seeing you, is to be a se∣vere Critic on you and your neighbour; but first kill his father, that he may be able to maintain me in my own way of living, and particularly my horses. It cost me near 600<HI>l.</HI> for a wall to keep mine, and I never ride without two ser∣vants for fear of accidents; <HI>hic vivimus ambi∣tiosa paupertate.</HI> You are both too poor for my acquaintance, but he much the poorer. With you I will find grass, and wine, and servants, but with him not.—The Collection you speak of is this. A Printer came to me to desire he might print my works (as he call'd them) in
<PB N="243" REF="262"/>
four volumes, by subscription. I said I would give no leave, and should be sorry to see them printed here. He said they could not be printed in London. I answer'd, they could, if the Part∣ners agreed. He said he <Q>“would be glad of my permission, but as he could print them without it, and was advis'd that it could do me no harm, and having been assur'd of nu∣merous subscriptions, he hoped I would not be angry at his pursuing his own interest, &amp;c.”</Q> Much of this discourse past, and he goes on with the matter, wherein I determine not to intermeddle, though it be much to my discontent; and I wish it could be done in Eng∣land, rather than here, although I am grown pretty indifferent in every thing of that kind. This is the truth of the story.</P>
<P>My Vanity turns at present on being person∣ated in your <HI>Quae Virtus,</HI> &amp;c. You will ob∣serve in this letter many marks of an ill head and a low spirit; but a Heart wholly turned to love you with the greatest Earnestness and Truth.</P>

<P>I Have begun two or three letters to you by snatches, and been prevented from finishing them by a thousand avocations and dissipations.
<PB N="244" REF="263"/>
I must first acknowledge the honour done me by Lord Orrery, whose praises are that precious ointment Solomon speaks of, which can be given only by men of Virtue: all other praise, whether from Poets or Peers, is contemptible alike: and I am old enough and experienced enough to know, that the only praises worth having, are those bestowed <HI>by</HI> Virtue <HI>for</HI> Vir∣tue. My Poetry I abandon to the critics, my Morals I commit to the testimony of those who know me; and therefore I was more pleas'd with your Libel, than with any Verses I ever receiv'd. I wish such a collection of your writings could be printed here, as you mention going on in Ireland. I was surpriz'd to receive from the Printer that spurious piece, call'd The Life and Character of Dr. Swift, with a letter telling me the person, <Q>“who publish'd it, had assur'd him the Dedication to me was what I would not take ill, or else he would not have printed it.”</Q> I can't tell who the man is, who took so far upon him as to answer for my way of thinking; tho', had the thing been genuine, I should have been greatly displeas'd at the publisher's part, in doing it without your knowledge.</P>
<P>I am as earnest as you can be, in doing my best to prevent the publishing of any thing un∣worthy of Mr. Gay; but I fear his friends par∣tiality.
<PB N="245" REF="264"/>
I wish you would come over. All the mysteries of my philosophical work shall then be clear'd to you, and you will not think that I am not merry enough, nor angry enough: It will not want for Satire, but as for Anger I know it not; or at least only that sort of which the Apostle speaks, <Q>“Be ye angry and sin not.”</Q></P>
<P>My Neighbour's writings have been meta∣physical, and will next be historical. It is cer∣tainly from him only that a valuable History of Europe in these latter times can be expected. Come, and quicken him; for age, indolence, and contempt of the world, grow upon men apace, and may often make the wisest indiffer∣ent whether posterity be any wiser than we. To a man in years, Health and Quiet become such rarities, and consequently so valuable, that he is apt to think of nothing more than of en∣joying them whenever he can, for the remainder of life; and this, I doubt not, has caus'd so many great men to die without leaving a scrap to posterity.</P>
<P>I am sincerely troubled for the bad account you give of your own health. I wish every day to hear a better, as much as I do to enjoy my own, I faithfully assure you.</P>

<P>I Must condole with you for the loss of Mrs. Pope, of whose death the papers have been full. But I would rather rejoice with you, be∣cause, if any circumstances can make the death of a dear Parent and Friend a subject for joy, you have them all. She died in an extreme old age, without pain, under the care of the most dutiful Son that I have ever known or heard of, which is a felicity not happening to one in a million. The worst effect of her death falls up∣on me, and so much the worse, because I expect∣ed <HI>aliquis damno usus in illo,</HI> that it would be followed by making me and this kingdom hap∣py with your presence. But I am told, to my great misfortune, that a very convenient offer happening, you waved the invitation pressed on you, alledging the fear you had of being killed here with eating and drinking. By which I find that you have given some credit to a no∣tion, of our great plenty and hospitality. It is true, our meat and wine is cheaper here, as it is always in the poorest countries, because there is no money to pay for them: I believe there are
<PB N="247" REF="266"/>
not in this whole city three Gentlemen out of Employment, who are able to give Entertain∣ments once a month. Those who are in em∣ployments of church or state, are three parts in four from England, and amount to little more than a dozen: Those indeed may once or twice invite their friends, or any person of distinction that makes a voyage hither. All my acquaint∣ance tell me, they know not above three fami∣lies where they can occasionally dine in a whole year: Dr. Delany is the only gentleman I know, who keeps one certain day in the week to en∣tertain seven or eight friends at dinner, and to pass the evening, where there is nothing of ex∣cess, either in eating or drinking. Our old friend Southern (who hath just left us) was in∣vited to dinner once or twice by a judge, a bi∣shop, or a commissioner of the revenues, but most frequented a few particular friends, and chiefly the Doctor, who is easy in his fortune, and very hospitable. The conveniences of tak∣ing the air, winter or summer, do far exceed those in London. For the two large strands just at two ends of the town are as firm and dry in winter as in summer. There are at least six or eight gentlemen of sense, learning, good∣humour and taste, able and desirous to please you; and orderly females, some of the better sort, to take care of you. These were the motives that
<PB N="248" REF="267"/>
I have frequently made use of to entice you hi∣ther. And there would be no failure among the best people here, of any honours that could be done you. As to myself, I declare, my health is so uncertain that I dare not venture amongst you at present. I hate the thoughts of London, where I am not rich enough to live otherwise than by shifting, which is now too late. Nei∣ther can I have conveniences in the country for three horses and two servants, and many others, which I have here at hand. I am one of the governors of all the hackney-coaches, carts, and carriages round this town, who dare not insult me, like your rascally waggoners or coach-men, but give me the way; nor is there one Lord or Squire for a hundred of yours, to turn me out of the road, or run over me with their coaches and six. Thus, I make some advantage of the public poverty, and give you the reasons for what I once writ, why I chuse to be a freeman among slaves, rather than a slave among free∣men. Then, I walk the streets in peace with∣out being justled, nor ever without a thousand blessings from my friends the vulgar. I am Lord Mayor of 120 houses, I am absolute Lord of the greatest Cathedral in the kingdom, am at peace with the neighbouring Princes, the Lord Mayor of the city, and the Arch-bishop of Dublin, only the latter, like the K. of
<PB N="249" REF="268"/>
France, sometimes attempts encroachments on my dominions, as old Lewis did upon Lor∣rain. In the midst of this raillery, I can tell you with seriousness, that these advantages con∣tribute to my ease, and therefore I value them. And in one part of your letter relating to my Lord B—and your self, you agree with me entirely, about the indifference, the love of quiet, the care of health, &amp;c. that grow upon men in years. And if you discover those in∣clinations in my Lord and yourself, what can you expect from me, whose health is so pre∣carious? and yet at your or his time of life, I could have leap'd over the moon.</P>

<P>I Have every day wish'd to write to you, to say a thousand things; and yet, I think, I should not have writ to you now, if I was not sick of writing any thing, sick of myself, and (what is worse) sick of my friends too. The world is become too busy for me; every body is so concerned for the public, that all private enjoyments are lost, or dis-relish'd. I write more to show you I am tired of this life, than to
<PB N="250" REF="269"/>
tell you any thing relating to it. I live as I did, I think as I did, I love you as I did; but all these are to no purpose: the world will not live, think, or love, as I do. I am troubled for, and vexed at, all my friends by turns. Here are some whom you love, and who love you; yet they receive no proofs of that affecti∣on from you, and they give none of it to you. There is a great gulph between. In earnest, I would go a thousand miles by land to see you, but the sea I dread. My ailments are such, that I really believe a sea-sickness (considering the oppression of colical pains, and the great weakness of my breast) would kill me: and if I did not die of that, I must of the excessive eating and drinking of your hospitable town, and the excessive flattery of your most poetical country. I hate to be cramm'd, either way. Let your hungry Poets, and your rhyming Poets digest it, I cannot. I like much better to be abused and half starved, than to be so over-praised and over-fed. Drown Ireland! for hav∣ing caught you, and for having kept you: I only reserve a little charity for her, for know∣ing your value, and esteeming you: You are the only Patriot I know, who is not hated for serving his country. The man who drew your Character and printed it here, was not much in the wrong in many things he said of you:
<PB N="251" REF="270"/>
yet he was a very impertinent fellow, for say∣ing them in words quite different from those you had yourself employed before on the same subject: for surely to alter your words is to pre∣judice them; and I have been told, that a man himself can hardly say the same thing twice over with equal happiness; Nature is so much a better thing than artifice.</P>
<P>I have written nothing this year: It is no af∣fectation to tell you, my Mother's loss has turn∣ed my frame of thinking. The habit of a whole life is a stronger thing than all the reason in the world. I know I ought to be easy, and to be free; but I am dejected, I am confined: my whole amusement is in reviewing my past life, not in laying plans for my future. I wish you cared as little for popular applause as I; as little for any nation, in contradistinction to o∣thers, as I: and then I fancy, you that are not afraid of the sea, you that are a stronger man at sixty than ever I was at twenty, would come and see several people who are (at last) like the primitive christians, of one soul and of one mind. The day is come, which I have often wished, but never thought to see; when <HI>every mortal, that I esteem, is of the same sentiment in Politics and in Religion.</HI></P>

<P>I Never think of you and can never write to you, now, without drawing many of those short sighs of which we have formerly talk'd: The reflection both of the friends we have been depriv'd of by Death, and of those from whom we are separated almost as eternally by Ab∣sence, checks me to that degree that it takes away in a manner the pleasure (which yet I feel very sensibly too) of thinking I am now con∣versing with you. You have been silent to me as to your Works; whether those printed here are, or are not genuine? but one, I am sure, is yours; and your method of concealing your self puts me in mind of the Indian bird I have read of, who hides his head in a hole, while all his feathers and tail stick out. You'll have immediately by several franks (even before 'tis here publish'd) my Epistle to Lord Cobham, part of my <HI>Opus Magnum,</HI> and the last Essay on Man, both which, I conclude, will be grate∣ful to your bookseller, on whom you please to bestow them so early. There is a woman's war declar'd against me by a certain Lord; his weapons are the same which women and chil∣dren use, a pin to scratch, and a squirt to be∣spatter:

I writ a sort of answer, but was ashamed to enter the lists with him, and after shewing it to some people, suppress'd it: otherwise it was such as was worthy of him and worthy of me <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is printed, in this edition, at the end of the second Volume of Letters.</NOTE>. I was three weeks this autumn with Lord Pe∣terborow, who rejoices in your doings, and al∣ways speaks with the greatest affection of you. I need not tell you who else do the same; you may be sure almost all those whom I ever see, or desire to see. I wonder not that B—paid you no sort of civility while he was in Ireland: he is too much a half-wit to love a true wit, and too much half-honest, to esteem any entire merit. I hope and think he hates me too, and I will do my best to make him: he is so insupportably insolent in his ci∣vility to me when he meets me at one third place, that I must affront him to be rid of it. That strict neutrality as to public parties, which I have constantly observ'd in all my writings, I think gives me the more title to attack such men, as slander and belye my character in pri∣vate, to those who know me not. Yet even this is a liberty I will never take, unless at the same time they are Pests of private society, or mischievous members of the public, that is to say, unless they are enemies to all men as

<P>I Have ever thought you as sensible as any man I knew, of all the delicacies of friend∣ship, and yet I fear (from what Lord B. tells me you said in your last letter) that you did not quite understand the reason of my late si∣lence. I assure you it proceeded wholly from the tender kindness I bear you. When the heart is full, it is angry at all words that cannot come up to it; and you are now the man in all
<PB N="255" REF="274"/>
the world I am most troubled to write to, for you are the friend I have left whom I am most grieved about. Death has not done worse to me in separating poor Gay, or any other, than disease and absence in dividing us. I am afraid to know how you do, since most accounts I have, give me pain for you, and I am unwil∣ling to tell you the condition of my own health. If it were good, I would see you; and yet if I found you in that very condition of deafness, which made you fly from us while we were together, what comfort could we derive from it? In writing often I should find great relief, could we write freely; and yet, when I have done so, you seem by not answering in a very long time, to feel either the same uneasiness as I do, or to abstain, from some prudential rea∣son. Yet I am sure, nothing that you and I wou'd say to each other, (tho' our own souls were to be laid open to the clerks of the post-office) could hurt either of us so much, in the opinion of any honest man or good subject, as the intervening, officious, impertinence of those Goers between us, who in England pretend to intimacies with you, and in Ireland to intima∣cies with me. I cannot but receive any that call upon me in your name, and in truth they take it in vain too often. I take all opportu∣nities of justifying you against these Friends,
<PB N="256" REF="275"/>
especially those who know all you think and write, and repeat your slighter verses. It is generally on such little scraps that Witlings feed, and 'tis hard the world should judge of our house-keeping from what we fling to our dogs, yet this is often the consequence. But they treat you still worse, mix their own with yours, print them to get money, and lay them at your door. This I am satis∣fied was the case in the Epistle to a Lady; it was just the same hand (if I have any judg∣ment in style) which printed your Life and Character before, which you so strongly dis∣avow'd in your letters to Lord Carteret, myself, and others. I was very well informed of ano∣ther fact, which convinced me yet more; the same person who gave this to be printed, offer'd to a bookseller a piece in prose as yours, and as commissioned by you, which has since ap∣pear'd, and been own'd to be his own. I think (I say once more) that I know your hand, tho' you did not mine in the Essay on Man. I beg your pardon for not telling you, as I should, had you been in England: but no secret can cross your Irish Sea, and every clerk in the post-office had known it. I fancy, tho' you lost sight of me in the first of those Essays, you saw me in the second. The design of conceal∣ing myself was good, and had its full effect;

I was thought a Divine, a Philosopher, and what not; and my doctrine had a sanction I could not have given to it. Whether I can pro∣ceed in the same grave march like Lucretius, or must descend to the gayeties of Horace, I know not, or whether I can do either? but be the future as it will, I shall collect all the past in one fair quarto this winter, and send it you, where you will find frequent mention of your∣self. I was glad you suffer'd your writings to be collected more completely than hitherto, in the volumes I daily expect from Ireland; I wish'd it had been in more pomp, but that will be done by others: yours are beauties, that can never be too finely drest, for they will ever be young. I have only one piece of mercy to beg of you; do not laugh at my gravity, but permit me to wear the beard of a Philosopher, till I pull it off, and make a jest of it myself. 'Tis just what my Lord B. is doing with Me∣taphysics. I hope, you will live to see, and stare at the learned figure he will make, on the same shelf with Locke and Malbranche.</P>
<P>You see how I talk to you (for this is not writing) if you like I should do so, why not tell me so? if it be the least pleasure to you, I will write once a week most gladly; but can you abstract the letters from the person who writes them them, so far, as not to feel more
<PB N="258" REF="277"/>
vexation in the thought of our separation, and those misfortunes which occasion it, than satis∣faction in the Nothings he can express? If you can, really and from my heart, I cannot.

<P>P. S. Our friend, who is just returned from a progress of three months, and is setting out in three days with me for the Bath, where he will stay till towards the middle of October, left this letter with me yesterday, and I cannot seal and dispatch it till I have scribled the remainder of this page full. He talks very pompously of my Metaphysics, and places them in a very honourable station. It is true, I have writ six letters and an half to him on subjects of that kind, and I propose a letter and an half more, which would swell the whole up to a consi∣derable volume. But he thinks me fonder of the Name of an Author than I am.

<P>I Have yours with my Lord B—'s Post∣script of September 15: it was long on its way, and for some weeks after the date I was very ill with my two inveterate disorders, gid∣diness and deafness The latter is pretty well off; but the other makes me totter towards evenings, and much dispirits me. But I con∣tinue to ride and walk, both of which, although they be no cures, are at least amusements. I did never imagine you to be either inconstant,
<PB N="260" REF="279"/>
or to want right notions of friendship, but I apprehend your want of health; and it hath been a frequent wonder to me how you have been able to entertain the world so long, so fre∣quently, so happily, under so many bodily dis∣orders. My Lord B. says you have been three months rambling, which is the best thing you can possibly do in a summer season; and when the winter recalls you, we will, for our own interests, leave you to your speculations. God be thanked, I have done with every thing, and of every kind that requires writing, except now and then a letter, or, like a true old man, scrib∣bling trifles only fit for children or school-boys of the lowest class at best, which three or four of us read and laugh at to-day, and burn to∣morrow. Yet, what is singular, I never am without some great work in view, enough to take up forty years of the most vigorous healthy man: although I am convinced that I shall never be able to finish three Treatises, that have lain by me several years, and want nothing but correction. My lord B. said in his postcript, that you would go to Bath in three days: we since heard that you were dangerously ill there, and that the news-mongers gave you over. But a gentleman of this kingdom, on his return from Bath, assured me he left you well, and so did
<PB N="261" REF="280"/>
some others whom I have forgot. I am sorry at my heart that you are pestered with people who come in my name, and I profess to you, it is without my knowledge. I am confident I shall hardly ever have occasion again to re∣commend, for my friends here are very few, and fixed to the free-hold, from whence no∣thing but death will remove them. Surely I never doubted about your Essay on Man; and I would lay any odds, that I would never fail to discover you in six lines, unless you had a mind to write below or beside yourself on purpose. I confess I did never imagine you were so deep in Morals, or that so many new and excellent rules could be produced so advan∣tageously and agreeably in that science, from any one head. I confess in some few places I was forced to read twice, I believe I told you before what the Duke of D—said to me on that occasion, How a Judge here, who knows you, told him that on the first reading those Es∣says, he was much pleased, but found some lines a little dark: On the second most of them cleared up, and his pleasure increased: On the third he had no doubt remained, and then he admired the whole. My lord B—'s attempt of reducing Metaphysics to intelligible sense and usefulness, will be a glorious undertaking, and
<PB N="262" REF="281"/>
as I never knew him fail in any thing he at∣tempted, if he had the sole management, so I am confident he will succeed in this. I desire you will allow that I write to you both at pre∣sent, and so I shall while I live: It saves your money, and my time; and he being your Ge∣nius, no matter to which it is addressed. I am happy that what you write is printed in large letters; otherwise between the weakness of my eyes, and the thickness of my hearing, I should lose the greatest pleasure that is left me. Pray command my lord B—to follow that ex∣ample, if I live to read his Metaphysics. Pray God bless you both. I had a melancholy ac∣count from the Doctor of his health. I will answer his letter as soon as I can. I am ever entirely yours.</P>

<P>I Am truly sorry for any complaint you have, and it is in regard to the weakness of your eyes that I write (as well as print) in folio. You'll think (I know you will, for you have all the candor of a good understanding) that the thing which men of our age feel the most, is the friendship of our equals; and that there∣fore whatever affects those who are stept a few years before us, cannot but sensibly affect us who are to follow. It troubles me to hear you complain of your memory, and if I am in any part of my constitution younger than you, it will be in my remembring every thing that has pleased me in you, longer than perhaps you will. The two summers we pass'd together dwell always on my mind, like a vision which gave me a glympse of a better life and better com∣pany, than this world otherwise afforded. I am now an individual, upon whom no other depends; and may go where I will, if the wretched carcase I am annex'd to did not hin∣der me. I rambled by very easy journeys this year to Lord Bathurst and Lord Peterborow, who upon every occasion commemorate, love, and wish for you. I now pass my days be∣tween
<PB N="264" REF="283"/>
Dawley, London, and this place, not studious, nor idle, rather polishing old works than hewing out new. I redeem now and then a paper that hath been abandon'd several years; and of this sort you'll soon see one, which I in∣scribe to our old friend Arbuthnot.</P>
<P>Thus far I had written, and thinking to fi∣nish my letter the same evening, was prevented by company, and the next morning found my∣self in a fever, highly disorder'd, and so conti∣nued in bed for five days, and in my chamber till now; but so well recover'd as to hope to go abroad to-morrow, even by the advice of Dr. Arbuthnot. He himself, poor man, is much broke, tho' not worse than for these two last months he has been. He took extremely kind your letter. I wish to God we could once meet again, before that separation, which yet, I would be glad to believe, shall re-unite us: But he who made us, not for ours but his purposes, knows only whether it be for the better or the worse, that the affections of this life should, or should not continue into the other: and doubtless it is as it should be. Yet I am sure that while I am here, and the thing that I am, I shall be imper∣fect without the communication of such friends as you; you are to me like a limb lost, and bu∣ried in another country; tho' we seem quite divided, every accident makes me feel you were
<PB N="265" REF="284"/>
once a part of me. I always consider you so much as a friend, that I forget you are an au∣thor, perhaps too much, but 'tis as much as I would desire you would do to me. However, if I could inspirit you to bestow correction up∣on those three Treatises, which you say are so near completed, I should think it a better work than any I can pretend to of my own. I am al∣most at the end of my Morals, as I've been, long ago, of my Wit; my system is a short one, and my circle narrow. Imagination has no limits, and that is a sphere in which you may move on to eternity; but where one is confined to Truth (or to speak more like a human creature, to the appearances of Truth) we soon find the short∣ness of our Tether. Indeed by the help of a metaphysical chain of Ideas, one may extend the circulation, go round and round for ever, without making any progress beyond the point to which Providence has pinn'd us: But this does not satisfy me, who would rather say a little to no purpose, than a great deal. Lord B. is voluminous, but he is voluminous only to destroy volumes. I shall not live, I fear, to see that work printed; he is so taken up still (in spite of the monitory hint given in the first line of my Essay) with particular Men, that he neg∣lects mankind, and is still a creature of this world, not of the Universe: This World,
<PB N="266" REF="285"/>
which is a name we give to Europe, to Eng∣land, to Ireland, to London, to Dublin, to the Court, to the Castle, and so diminishing, till it comes to our own affairs, and our own persons. When you write (either to him or to me, for we accept it all as one) rebuke him for it, as a Divine if you like it, or as a Badineur, if you think that more effectual.</P>
<P>What I write will show you that my head is yet weak. I had written to you by that gentle∣man from the Bath, but I did not know him, and every body that comes from Ireland pre∣tends to be a friend of the Dean's. I am al∣ways glad to see any that are truly so, and therefore do not mistake any thing I said, so as to discourage your sending any such to me. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOUR letter was sent me yesterday by Mr. Stopford, who landed the same day, but I have not yet seen him. As to my silence, God knows it is my great misfortune. My little do∣mestic affairs are in great confusion by the vil∣lainy
<PB N="267" REF="286"/>
of agents, and the miseries of this king∣dom, where there is no money to be had: nor am I unconcerned to see all things tending to∣wards absolute power, in both nations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Dean was fre∣quently troubled, he tells us, with a <HI>giddiness</HI> in his head.</NOTE> (it is here in perfection already) although I shall not live to see it established. This condition of things, both public and personal to myself, hath given me such a kind of despondency, that I am almost unqualified for any company, diversion, or amusement. The death of Mr. Gay and the Doctor, hath been terrible wounds near my heart. Their living would have been a great comfort to me, although I should ne∣ver have seen them; like a sum of money in a bank, from which I should receive at least an∣nual interest, as I do from you, and have done from my Lord Bolingbroke. To shew in how much ignorance I live, it is hardly a fortnight since I heard of the death of my Lady Ma∣sham, my constant friend in all changes of times. God forbid that I should expect you to make a voyage that would in the least affect your health: but in the mean time how unhap∣py am I, that my best friend should have per∣haps the only kind of disorder for which a sea∣voyage is not in some degree a remedy? The

old Duke of Ormond said, he would not change his dead son (Ossory) for the best liv∣ing son in Europe. Neither would I change you my absent friend for the best present friend round the Globe.</P>
<P>I have lately read a book imputed to Lord B. called a Dissertation upon Parties. I think it very masterly written.</P>
<P>Pray God reward you for your kind prayers: I believe your prayers will do me more good than those of all the Prelates in both kingdoms, or any Prelates in Europe except the Bishop of Marseilles <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Who continued there with his flock all the time a dreadful pestilence desolated that city.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS letter will be delivered to you by Faulkner the printer, who goes over on his private affairs. This is an answer to yours
<PB N="269" REF="288"/>
of two months ago, which complains of that profligate fellow Curl. I heartily wish you were what they call disaffected, as I am. I may say as David did, I have sinned greatly, but what have these sheep done? You have given no of∣fence to the Ministry, nor to the Lords, nor Commons, nor Queen, nor the next in Power. For you are a man of virtue, and therefore must abhor vice and all corruption, although your discretion holds the reins. <Q>“You need not fear any consequence in the commerce that hath so long passed between us; although I never destroy'd one of your letters. But my Executors are men of honour and vir∣tue, who have strict orders in my will to burn every letter left behind me.”</Q> Neither did our letters contain any Turns of Wit, or Fancy, or Politics, or Satire, but mere inno∣cent Friendship: yet I am loth that any letters, from you and a very few other friends, should dye before me; I believe we neither of us ever leaned our head upon our left hand to study what we should write next; yet we have held a constant intercourse from your youth and my middle age, and from your middle age it must be continued till my death, which my bad state of health makes me expect every month. I have the ambition, and it is very earnest as well as in haste, to have one Epistle inscribed to
<PB N="270" REF="289"/>
me while I am alive, and you just in the time when wit and wisdom are in the height. I must once more repeat Cicero's desire to a friend; <HI>Orna me.</HI> A month ago were sent me over by a friend of mine, the works of John Hughes, Esq. They are in verse and prose. I never heard of the man in my life, yet I find your name as a subscriber too. He is too grave a Poet for me, and, I think, among the <HI>medio∣cribus</HI> in prose as well as verse. I have the honour to know Dr. Rundle; he is indeed worth all the rest you ever sent us, but that is saying nothing, for he answers your character; I have dined thrice in his company. He brought over a worthy clergyman of this king∣dom as his chaplain, which was a very wise and popular action. His only fault, is, that he drinks no wine, and I drink nothing else.</P>
<P>This kingdom is now absolutely starving, by the means of every oppression that can be in∣flicted on mankind—Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. You advise me right, not to trouble myself about the world: But, oppression tortures me, and I cannot live with∣out meat and drink, nor get either without money; and money is not to be had, except they will make me a Bishop, or a Judge, or a Colonel, or a Commissioner of the Revenues.</P>

<P>TO answer your question as to Mr. Hughes, what he wanted as to genius he made up as an honest man: but he was of the class you think him.</P>
<P>I am glad you think of Dr. Rundle as I do. He will be an honour to the Bishops, and a disgrace to one Bishop, two things you will like: But what you will like more particularly, he will be a friend and benefactor even to your un-friended, un-benefited Nation; he will be a friend to human race, wherever he goes. Pray tell him my best wishes for his health and long life: I wish you and he came over toge∣ther, or that I were with you. I never saw a man so seldom whom I liked so much as Dr. Rundle.</P>
<P>Lord Peterborow I went to take a last leave of, at his setting sail for Lisbon: No Body can be more wasted, no Soul can be more alive. Im∣mediately after the severest operation of being cut into the bladder for a suppression of urine, he took coach, and got from Bristol to South∣ampton. This is a man that will neither live nor die like any other mortal.</P>
<P>Poor Lord Peterborow! there is another string lost, that wou'd have help'd to draw
<PB N="272" REF="291"/>
you hither! He order'd on his death-bed his Watch to be given me (that which had accom∣panied him in all his travels) with this reason, <Q>“That I might have something to put me eve∣ry day in mind of him.”</Q> It was a present to him from the King of Sicily, whose arms and <HI>Insignia</HI> are graved on the inner-case; on the outer, I have put this inscription. <HI>Victor Amadeus, Rex Siciliae, Dux Sabaudiae, &amp;c. &amp;c. Carolo Mordaunt, Comiti de Peterborow, D. D. Car. Mor. Com. de Pet. Alexandro Pope moriens legavit,</HI> 1735.</P>
<P>Pray write to me a little oftner: and if there be a thing left in the world that pleases you, tell it one who will partake of it. I hear with approbation and pleasure, that your present care is to relieve the most helpless of this world, those objects<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idiots.</NOTE> which most want our compas∣sion, tho' generally made the scorn of their fellow-creatures, such as are less innocent than they. You always think generously; and of all charities, this is the most disinterested, and least vain-glorious, done to such as never will thank you, or can praise you for it.</P>
<P>God bless you with ease, if not with plea∣sure; with a tolerable state of health, if not with its full enjoyment; with a resign'd temper
<PB N="273" REF="292"/>
of mind, if not a very chearful one. It is upon these terms I live myself, tho' younger than you, and I repine not at my lot, could but the presence of a few that I love be added to these.</P>

<P>I Answer'd your letter relating to Curl, &amp;c. I believe my letters have escap'd being pub∣lish'd, because I writ nothing but Nature and Friendship, and particular incidents which could make no figure in writing. I have ob∣serv'd that not only Voiture, but likewise Tully and Pliny writ their letters for the public view, more than for the sake of their correspondents; and I am glad of it, on account of the Enter∣tainment they have given me. Balsac did the same thing, but with more stiffness, and conse∣quently less diverting: Now I must tell you, that you are to look upon me as one going very fast out of the world; but my flesh and bones are to be carried to Holy-head, for I will not lie in a Country of slaves. It pleaseth me to find that you begin to dislike things in spite of
<PB N="274" REF="293"/>
your Philosophy; your Muse cannot forbear her hints to that purpose. I cannot travel to see you; otherwise, I solemnly protest I would do it. I have an intention to pass this winter in the country with a friend forty miles off, and to ride only ten miles a day; yet is my health so uncertain that I fear it will not be in my power. I often ride a dozen miles, but I come to my own bed at night: My best way would be to marry, for in that case any bed would be better than my own. I found you a very young man, and I left you a middle∣aged one; you knew me a middle-aged man, and now I am an old one. Where is my Lord—? methinks, I am enquiring after a Tu∣lip of last year.—<Q>“You need not apprehend any Curll's meddling with your letters to me; I will not destroy them, but have or∣der'd my Executors to do that office.”</Q> I have a thousand things more to say, <HI>longaevitas est garrula,</HI> but I must remember I have other letters to write if I have time, which I spend to tell you so; I am ever, dearest Sir, Your, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Cannot properly call you my best friend, because I have not another left who deserves the name, such a havock have Time, Death, Exile, and Oblivion made. Perhaps you would have fewer complaints of my ill health and lowness of spirits, if they were not some ex∣cuse for my delay of writing even to you. It is perfectly right what you say of the indiffer∣ence in common friends, whether we are sick or well, happy or miserable. The very maid∣servants in a family have the same notion: I have heard them often say, Oh, I am very sick, if any body cared for it! I am vexed when my visiters come with the compliment usual here, Mr. Dean, I hope you are very well. My popularity that you mention, is wholly confined to the common people, who are more con∣stant than those we mis-call their betters. I walk the streets, and so do my lower friends, from whom and from whom alone, I have a thousand hats and blessings upon old scores, which those we call the Gentry have forgot. But I have not the love, or hardly the civility,
<PB N="$$6" REF="295"/>
of any one man in power or station; and I can boast that I neither visit nor am acquainted with any Lord Temporal or Spiritual in the whole kingdom; nor am able to do the least good office to the most deserving man, except what I can dispose of in my own Cathedral upon a vacancy. What hath sunk my spirits more than even years and sickness, is reflecting on the most execrable Corruptions that run through every branch of public management.</P>
<P>I heartily thank you for those lines translated, <HI>Singula de nobis anni,</HI> &amp;c. You have put them in a strong and admirable light; but however I am so partial, as to be more delighted with those which are to do me the greatest honour I shall ever receive from posterity, and will outweigh the malignity of ten-thousand ene∣mies. I never saw them before, by which it is plain that the letter you sent me miscarry'd.—I do not doubt that you have choice of new acquaintance, and some of them may be deserving: For Youth is the season of Virtue; Corruptions grow with years, and I believe the oldest rogue in England is the greatest. You have years enough before you<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He was mistaken.</NOTE> to watch whe∣ther these new acquaintance will keep their Virtue, when they leave you and go into the world; how long will their spirit of indepen∣dency
<PB N="277" REF="296"/>
last against the temptations of future Mi∣nisters, and future Kings.—As to the new Lord Lieutenant, I never knew any of the family; so that I shall not be able to get any jobb done by him for any deserving friend.</P>

<P>IT is some time since I dined at the bishop of Derry's, where Mr. Secretary Cary told me with great concern, that you were taken very ill. I have heard nothing since, only I have continued in great pain of mind, yet for my own sake and the world's more than for yours; because I well know how little you va∣lue life both as a Philosopher and a Christian, particularly the latter, wherein hardly one in a million of us heretics can equal you. If you are well recovered, you ought to be reproached for not putting me especially out of pain, who could not bear the loss of you; although we must be for ever distant as much as if I were in the grave, for which my years and continual indisposition are preparing me every season. I have staid too long from pressing you to give
<PB N="278" REF="297"/>
me some case by an account of your health; pray do not use me so ill any more. I look upon you as an estate from which I receive my best annual rents, although I am never to see it. Mr. Tickel was at the same meeting un∣der the same real concern; and so were a hun∣dred others of this town who had never seen you.</P>
<P>I read to the Bishop of Derry the paragraph in your letter which concerned him, and his Lordship express'd his thankfulness in a manner that became him. He is esteemed here as a person of learning and conversation and huma∣nity, but he is beloved by all people.</P>
<P>I have no-body now left but you: Pray, be so kind to out-live me, and then die as soon as you please but without pain; and let us meet in a better place, if my Religion will permit, but rather my Virtue, although much unequal to yours. Pray, let my Lord Bathurst know how much I love him; I still insist on his re∣membring me, although he is too much in the world to honour an absent friend with his let∣ters. My state of health is not to boast of; my giddiness is more or less too constant; I sleep ill, and have a poor appetite. I can as easily write a Poem in the Chinese-language as my own: I am as fit for Matrimony as inven∣tion; and yet I have daily schemes for innu∣merable
<PB N="279" REF="298"/>
Essays in prose, and proceed sometimes to no less than half a dozen lines, which the next morning become waste paper. What vexes me most is, that my semale friends, who could bear me very well a dozen years ago, have now forsaken me, although I am not so old in proportion to them, as I formerly was: which I can prove by Arithmetic, for then I was double their age, which now I am not. Pray, put me out of fear as soon as you can, about that ugly report of your illness; and let me know who this Cheselden is, that hath so lately sprung up in your favour? Give me also some account of your neighbour who writ to me from Bath: I hear he resolves to be strenuous for taking off the Test; which grieves me extremely, from all the unprejudiced Reasons I ever was able to form, and against the maxims of all wise Chri∣stian governments <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Author of the <HI>Dissertation on parties</HI> appears to be of the same opinion.</NOTE>, which always had some establish'd Religion, leaving at best a toleration to others.</P>

<P>IF ever I write more Epistles in Verse, one of them shall be address'd to you. I have long concerted it, and begun it, but I would make what bears your name as finished as my last work ought to be, that is to say, more fi∣nished than any of the rest. The subject is large, and will divide into four Epistles, which naturally follow the Essay on Man, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Of the Extent and Limits of Human Reason and Science. 2. A view of the useful and therefore attainable, and of the un-useful and therefore un-attainable, Arts. 3. Of the Nature, Ends, Application, and Use of different Capacities. 4. Of the Use of <HI>Learning,</HI> of the <HI>Science</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> and of <HI>Wit.</HI> It will conclude with a Satire against the mis-application of all these, exemplify'd by pictures, characters, and exam∣ples.</P>
<P>But alas! the task is great, and <HI>non sum qua∣lis eram!</HI> My understanding indeed, such as it is, is extended rather than diminish'd: I see things more in the whole, more consistent, and more clearly deduced from, and related to, each other. But what I gain on the side of philoso∣phy, I lose on the side of poetry: the flowers are gone, when the fruits begin to ripen, and
<PB N="281" REF="300"/>
the fruits perhaps will never ripen perfectly. The climate (under our Heaven of a Court) is but cold and uncertain; the winds rise, and the winter comes on. I find myself but little disposed to build a new house; I have nothing left but to gather up the reliques of a wreck, and look about me to see how few friends I have left. Pray, whose esteem or ad∣miration should I desire now to procure by my writings? whose friendship or conversation to obtain by 'em? I am a man of desperate for∣tunes, that is, a man whose friends are dead: for I never aim'd at any other fortune than in friends. As soon as I had sent my last letter, I receiv'd a most kind one from you, expressing great pain for my late illness at Mr. Cheselden's. I conclude you was eased of that friendly ap∣prehension in a few days after you had dis∣patch'd yours, for mine must have reached you then. I wondered a little at your quaere, who Cheselden was? It shews that the truest merit does not travel so far any way as on the wings of poetry; he is the most noted, and most de∣serving man, in the whole profession of Chirur∣gery; and has sav'd the lives of thousands by his manner of cutting for the stone.—I am now well, or what I must call so.</P>
<P>I have lately seen some writings of Lord B.'s, since he went to France. Nothing can depress
<PB N="282" REF="301"/>
his Genius: What ever befals him, he will still be the greatest man in the world, either in his own time, or with posterity.</P>
<P>Every man you know or care for here, en∣quires of you, and pays you the only devoir he can, that of drinking your health. I wish you had any motive to see this kingdom. I could keep you, for I am rich, that is, I have more than I want. I can afford room for yourself and two servants; I have indeed room enough, nothing but myself at home; the kind and hearty house-wife is dead! the agreeable and instructive neighbour is gone! yet my house is inlarg'd, and the gardens extend and flourish, as knowing nothing of the guests they have lost. I have more fruit-trees and kitchen-garden than you have any thought of; nay I have good Melons and Pine-apples of my own growth. I am as much a better Gardener, as I am a worse Poet, than when you saw me: But gardening is near a-kin to Philosophy, for Tully says, <HI>Agri∣cultura proxima sapientiae.</HI> For God's sake, why should not you (that are a step higher than a Philosopher, a Divine, yet have too much grace and wit than to be a Bishop) e'en give all you have to the Poor of Ireland (for whom you have already done every thing else) so quit the place, and live and die with me? And let <HI>Tales animae concordes</HI> be our Motto and our Epitaph.</P>

<P>MY common illness is of that kind which utterly disqualifies me for all conversa∣tion; I mean my Deafness; and indeed it is that only which discourageth me from all thoughts of coming to England; because I am never sure that it may not return in a week. If it were a good honest Gout, I could catch an interval, to take a voyage, and in a warm lodging get an easy chair, and be able to hear and roar among my friends. <Q>“As to what you say of your Letters, since you have many years of life more than I, my resolution is to direct my Executors to send you all your let∣ters, well sealed and pacqueted, along with some legacies mentioned in my will, and leave them entirely to your disposal: Those things are all tied up, endors'd and locked in a cabinet, and I have not one servant who can properly be said to write or read: No mor∣tal shall copy them, but you shall surely have them when I am no more.”</Q> I have a little repined at my being hitherto slipped by you in your Epistles, not from any other
<PB N="284" REF="303"/>
ambition than the Title of a Friend, and in that sense I expect you shall perform your pro∣mise, if your health and leisure and inclination will permit. I deny your losing on the side of Poetry; I could reason against you a little from experience; you are, and will be some years to come, at the age when Invention still keeps its ground, and Judgment is at full maturity; but your subjects are much more difficult when confin'd to Verse. I am amazed to see you exhaust the whole science of Morality in so ma∣sterly a manner. Sir W. Temple, said that the loss of Friends was a Tax upon long life: It need not be very long, since you have had so great a share, but I have not above one left: and in this Country I have only a few general companions of good nature and middling under∣standings. How should I know Cheselden? On your side, men of fame start up and die be∣fore we here (at least I) know any thing of the matter. I am a little comforted with what you say of Lord B.'s Genius still keeping up, and preparing to appear by effects worthy of the author, and useful to the world.—Common reports have made me very uneasy about your neighbour Mr. P. It is affirmed that he hath been very near death: I love him for being a Patriot in most corrupted times, and highly esteem his excellent understanding. Nothing
<PB N="285" REF="304"/>
but the perverse nature of my disorders, as I have above described them, and which are ab∣solute disqualifications for converse, could hin∣der me from waiting on you at Twittenham, and nursing you to Paris. In short, my Ail∣ments amount to a prohibition, although I am, as you describe yourself, what <HI>I must call well,</HI> yet I have not spirits left to ride out, which (excepting walking) was my only diversion. And I must expect to decline every month, like one who lives upon his principal sum which must lessen every day; and indeed I am like∣wise literally almost in the same case, while every body owes me, and no-body pays me. Instead of a young race of Patriots on your side, which gives me some glimpse of joy, here we have the direct contrary, a race of young Dunces and Atheists, or old Villains and Monsters, whereof four fifths are more wicked and stu∣pid than Chartres. Your wants are so few, that you need not be rich to supply them; and my wants are so many, that a King's seven millions of guineas would not support me.</P>

<P>I Find, tho' I have less experience than you, the truth of what you told me some time ago, that increase of years makes men more talkative but less writative: to that degree, that I now write no letters but of plain business, or plain how-d'ye's, to those few I am forced to correspond with, either out of necessity, or love: And I grow Laconic even beyond Laco∣nicisme; for sometimes I return only Yes, or No, to questionary or petitionary Epistles of half a yard long. You and Lord Bolingbroke are the only men to whom I write, and always in folio. You are indeed almost the only men I know, who either can write in this age, or whose writings will reach the next: Others are mere mortals. Whatever failings such men may have, a respect is due to them, as Lumi∣naries whose exaltation renders their motion a little irregular, or rather causes it to seem so to others. I am afraid to censure any thing I hear of Dean Swift, because I hear it only from mortals, blind and dull: And you shou'd be cautious of censuring any action or motion of Lord B. because you hear it only from shallow,
<PB N="287" REF="308"/>
envious, or malicious reporters. What you writ to me about him I find to my great scan∣dal repeated in one of yours to—. Whatever you might hint to me, was this for the pro∣phane? the thing, if true, should be conceal'd; but it is, I assure you, absolutely untrue, in eve∣ry circumstance. He has fixed in a very agree∣able retirement near Fontainbleau, and makes it his whole business <HI>vacare literis.</HI> But tell me the truth, were you not angry at his omitting to write to you so long? I may, for I hear from him seldomer than from you, that is twice or thrice a year at most. Can you possibly think he can neglect you, or disregard you? If you catch yourself at thinking such nonsense, your parts are decay'd: For, believe me, great Ge∣nius's must and do esteem one another, and I question if any others can esteem or compre∣hend uncommon merit. Others only guess at that merit, or see glimmerings of their minds: A genius has the intuitive faculty: Therefore, imagine what you will, you cannot be so sure of any man's esteem as of his. If I can think that neither he nor you despise me, it is a greater honour to me by far, and will be thought so by posterity, than if all the House of Lords writ Commendatory Verses upon me, the Com∣mons order'd me to print my Works, the Uni∣versities
<PB N="288" REF="309"/>
gave me public thanks, and the King, Queen, and Prince crown'd me with Laurel. You are a very ignorant man; you don't know the figure his name and yours will make here∣after: I do, and will preserve all the memo∣rials I can, that I was of your intimacy; <HI>longo, sed proximus, intervallo.</HI> I will not quarrel with the present Age; it has done enough for me, in making and keeping you two my friends. Do not you be too angry at it, and let not him be too angry at it; it has done and can do neither of you any manner of harm, as long as it has not, and cannot burn your works: while those subsist, you'll both appear the greatest men of the time, in spite of Princes and Ministers; and the wisest, in spite of all the little Errors you may please to commit.</P>
<P>Adieu. May better health attend you, than, I fear, you possess; may but as good health at∣tend you always as mine is at present; tolerable, when an easy mind is join'd with it.</P>

<P>I Think you owe me a letter, but whether you do or not, I have not been in a condi∣tion to write. Years and Infirmities have quite broke me; I mean that odious continual disor∣der in my head. I neither read, nor write, nor remember, nor converse. All I have left is to walk and ride; the first I can do tolerably; but the latter, for want of good weather at this sea∣son, is seldom in my power; and having not an ounce of flesh about me, my skin comes off in ten miles riding, because my skin and bone can∣not agree together. But I am angry, because you will not suppose me as sick as I am, and write to me out of perfect charity, although I should not be able to answer. I have too many vexations by my station and the impertinence of people, to be able to bear the mortification of not hearing from a very few distant friends that are left; and, considering how time and fortune have ordered matters, I have hardly one friend left but yourself. What Horace says, <HI>Singula de nobis anni praedantur,</HI> I feel every month, at farthest; and by this computation, if I hold

out two years, I shall think it a miracle. My comfort is, you begun to distinguish so con∣founded early, that your acquaintance with dis∣tinguish'd men of all kinds was almost as antient as mine. I mean Wycherly, Row, Prior, Con∣greve, Addison, Parnel, &amp;c. and in spite of your heart, you have owned me a Cotemporary. Not to mention Lords Oxford, Bolingbroke, Harcourt, Peterborow: In short, I was t'other day recollecting twenty-seven great Ministers, or Men of Wit and Learning, who are all dead, and all of my acquaintance, within twenty years past; neither have I the grace to be sorry, that the present times are drawn to the dregs as well as my own life.—May my friends be happy in this and a better life, but I value not what be∣comes of Posterity when I consider from what Monsters they are to spring.—My Lord Orrery writes to you to-morrow, and you see I send this under his cover, or at least franked by him. He has 3000<HI>l.</HI> a year about Cork, and the neighbourhood, and has more than three years rent unpaid; This is our condition, in these blessed times. I writ to your neighbour about a month ago, and subscribed my name: I fear he hath not received my letter, and wish you would ask him; but perhaps he is still a ramb∣ling; for we hear of him at Newmarket, and that Boerhaave hath restored his health.—How

my services are lessened of late with the num∣ber of my friends on your side! yet, my Lord Bathurst and Lord Masham and Mr. Lewis re∣main, and being your acquaintance I desire when you see them to deliver my compliments; but chiefly to Mrs. P. B. and let me know whether she be as young and agreeable as when I saw her last? Have you got a supply of new friends to make up for those who are gone? and are they equal to the first? I am afraid it is with friends as with times; and that the <HI>laudator tem∣poris acti se puero,</HI> is equally applicable to both. I am less grieved for living here, because it is a perfect retirement, and consequently fittest for those who are grown good for nothing: for this town and kingdom are as much out of the world as North-Wales—My head is so ill that I can∣not write a paper full as I used to do; and yet I will not forgive a blank of half an inch from you.—I had reason to expect from some of your letters, that we were to hope for more Epistles of Morality; and, I assure you, my acquaintance resent that they have not seen my name at the head of one. The subjects of such Epistles are more useful to the public, by your manner of handling them, than any of all your writings; and although, in so profligate a world as ours, they may possibly not much mend our man∣ners, yet posterity will enjoy the benefit, when∣ever

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Decemb. 30, 1736▪</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very kind letter has made me more melancholy, than almost any thing in this world now can do. For I can bear every thing in it, bad as it is, better than the complaints of my friends. Tho' others tell me you are in pretty good health, and in good spirits, I find the contrary when you open your mind to me: And indeed it is but a prudent part, to seem not so concern'd about others, nor so crazy ourselves as we really are: for we shall neither be be∣loved nor esteem'd the more, by our common acquaintance, for any affliction or any infirmi∣ty. But to our true friend we may, we must complain, of what ('tis a thousand to one) he complains with us; for if we have known him long, he is old, and if he has known the world long, he is out of humour at it. If you have but as much more health than others at your age, as you have more wit and good temper, you shall not have much of my Pity: But if you ever live
<PB N="293" REF="316"/>
to have less, you shall not have less of my Af∣fection. A whole people will rejoyce at every year that shall be added to you, of which you have had a late instance in the public rejoycings on your birth-day. I can assure you, something better and greater than high birth and quality must go toward acquiring those demonstrations of public esteem and love. I have seen a royal birth-day uncelebrated, but by one vile Ode, and one hired bonfire. Whatever years may take away from you, they will not take away the general esteem, for your Sense, Virtue, and Charity.</P>
<P>The most melancholy effect of years is that you mention, the catalogue of those we lov'd and have lost, perpetually encreasing. How much that Reflection struck me, you'll see from the Motto I have prefix'd to my Book of Let∣ters, which so much against my inclination has been drawn from me. It is from Catullus:
<Q><L>Quo desiderio veteres revocamus Amores,</L>
<L>Atque olim amissas flemus Amicitias!</L></Q>
I detain this letter till I can find some safe con∣veyance; innocent as it is, and as all letters of mine must be, of any thing to offend my supe∣riors, except the reverence I bear to true merit and virtue. "But I have much reason to fear, "those which you have too partially kept in
<Q>“

<PB N="294" REF="317"/>
your hands will get out in some very disagree∣able shape, in case of our mortality: and the more reason to fear it, since this last month Curl has obtain'd from Ireland two letters, (one of Lord Bolingbroke and one of mine, to you, which we wrote in the year 1723) and he has printed them, to the best of my memory, rightly, except one passage concern∣ing Dawley, which must have been since in∣serted, since my Lord had not that place at that time. Your answer to that letter he has not got; it has never been out of my custo∣dy; for whatever is lent is lost (Wit as well as Money) to these needy poetical Readers.”</Q></P>
<P>The world will certainly be the better for his change of life. He seems in the whole turn of his letters, to be a settled and principled Phi∣losopher, thanking Fortune for the Tranquillity he has been led into by her aversion, like a man driven by a violent wind, from the sea into a calm harbour. You ask me, if I have got any supply of new Friends to make up for those that are gone? I think that impossible, for not our friends only, but so much of ourselves is gone by the mere flux and course of years, that, were the same Friends to be restored to us, we could not be restored to ourselves, to enjoy them. But as when the continual washing of a river takes away our flowers and plants, it
<PB N="295" REF="318"/>
throws weeds and sedges in their room <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There are some strokes in this letter, which can no otherwise be accounted for, than by the Author's extreme compassion and tenderness of heart, too much affected by the complaints of a peevish old man, labouring and im∣patient under his infirmities; and too intent in the friend∣ly office of mollifying them.</NOTE>; so the course of time brings us something, as it de∣prives us of a great deal; and instead of leaving us what we cultivated, and expected to flourish and adorn us, gives us only what is of some lit∣tle use, by accident. Thus I have acquired, without my seeking, a few chance-acquaintance, of young men, who look rather to the past age than the present, and therefore the future may have some hopes of them. If I love them, it is because they honour some of those whom I, and the world, have lost, or are losing. Two or three of them have distinguish'd themselves in Parliament, and you will own in a very uncom∣mon manner, when I tell you it is by their as∣serting of Independency, and contempt of Cor∣ruption. One or two are link'd to me by their love of the same studies and the same authors: but I will own to you, my moral capacity has got so much the better of my poetical, that I have few acquaintance on the latter score, and none without a casting weight on the former. But I find my heart harden'd and blunt to new
<PB N="296" REF="319"/>
impressions, it will scarce receive or retain af∣fections of yesterday; and those friends who have been dead these twenty years, are more present to me now, than these I see daily. You, dear Sir, are one of the former sort to me in all respects, but that we can, yet, correspond toge∣ther. I don't know whether 'tis not more vex∣atious, to know we are both in one world, with∣out any further intercourse. Adieu. I can say no more, I feel so much: Let me drop into common things—Lord Masham has just mar∣ried his son. Mr. Lewis has just buried his wife. Lord Oxford wept over your letter in pure kindness. Mrs. B. sighs more for you, than for the loss of youth. She says, she will be agreeable many years hence, for she has learn'd that secret from some receipts of your writing.—Adieu.</P>

<P>THO' you were never to write to me, yet what you desired in your last, that I would write often to you, would be a very easy task; for every day I talk with you, and of you, in my heart; and I need only set down what that is thinking of. The nearer I find myself verging
<PB N="297" REF="320"/>
to that period of life which is to be labour and sorrow, the more I prop myself upon those few supports that are left me. People in this state are like props indeed, they cannot stand alone, but two or more of them can stand, leaning and bearing upon one another. I wish you and I might pass this part of life together. My only necessary care is at an end. I am now my own master too much; my house is too large; my gardens furnish too much wood and provision for my use. My servants are sensible and ten∣der of me; they have intermarried, and are be∣come rather low friends than servants: and to all those that I see here with pleasure, they take a pleasure in being useful. I conclude this is your case too in your domestic life, and I some∣times think of your old house-keeper as my nurse; tho' I tremble at the sea, which only divides us. As your fears are not so great as mine, and, I firmly hope, your strength still much greater, is it utterly impossible, it might once more be some pleasure to you to see England? My sole motive in proposing France to meet in, was the narrowness of the passage by sea from hence, the Physicians having told me the weak∣ness of my breast, &amp;c. is such, as a sea-sickness might indanger my life. Tho' one or two of our friends are gone, since you saw your native country, there remain a few more who will last
<PB N="298" REF="321"/>
so till death, and who, I cannot but hope, have an attractive power to draw you back to a Country, which cannot quite be sunk or en∣slaved, while such spirits remain. And let me tell you, there are a few more of the same spi∣rit, who would awaken all your old Ideas, and revive your hopes of her future recovery and Virtue. These look up to you with reverence, and would be animated by the sight of him at whose soul they have taken fire, in his writings, and deriv'd from thence as much Love of their species as is consistent with a contempt for the knaves of it.</P>
<P>I could never be weary, except at the eyes, of writing to you; but my real reason (and a strong one it is) for doing it so seldom, is Fear; Fear of a very great and experienced evil, that of my letters being kept by the partiality of friends, and passing into the hands, and malice of enemies; who publish them with all their Imperfections on their head; so that I write not on the common terms of honest men.</P>
<P>Would to God you would come over with Lord Orrery, whose care of you in the voyage I could so certainly depend on; and bring with you your old house-keeper and two or three servants. I have room for all, a heart for all, and (think what you will) a fortune for all. We could, were we together, contrive to make

our last days easy, and leave some sort of Mo∣nument, what Friends two Wits could be in spite of all the fools in the world.</P>

<P>IT is true, I owe you some letters, but it has pleased God, that I have not been in a con∣dition to pay you. When you shall be at my age, perhaps you may lie under the same disabi∣lity to your present or future friends. But my age is not my disability, for I can walk six or seven miles, and ride a dozen. But I am deaf for two months together; this deafness unqua∣lifies me for all company, except a few friends with counter-tenor voices, whom I can call names, if they do not speak loud enough for my ears. It is this evil that hath hindered me from venturing to the Bath, and to Twicken∣ham; for deafness being not a frequent disor∣der, hath no allowance given it; and the scurvy figure a man affected that way makes in com∣pany, is utterly insupportable.</P>
<P>It was I began with the petition to you of <HI>Orna me,</HI> and now you come like an unfair merchant, to change me with being in your
<PB N="300" REF="323"/>
debt; which by your way of reckoning I must always be, for yours are always guineas, and mine farthings; and yet I have a pretence to quarrel with you, because I am not at the head of any one of your Epistles. I am often won∣dring how you come to excel all mortals on the subject of Morality, even in the poetical way; and should have wondred more, if Na∣ture and Education had not made you a profes∣sor of it from your infancy. <Q>“All the letters I can find of yours, I have fastened in a folio cover, and the rest in bundles endors'd: But, by reading their dates, I find a chasm of six years, of which I can find no copies; and yet I keep them with all possible care: But, I have been forced, on three or four occa∣sions, to send all my papers to some friends; yet those papers were all sent sealed in bun∣dles, to some faithful friends; however, what I have are not much above sixty.”</Q> I found nothing in any one of them to be left out: None of them have any thing to do with Par∣ty, of which you are the clearest of all men by your Religion, and the whole tenour of your life; while I am raging every moment against the Corruption of both kingdoms, especially of this; such is my weakness.</P>
<P>I have read your Epistle of Horace to Au∣gustus: it was sent me in the English Edition,
<PB N="301" REF="324"/>
as soon as it could come. They are printing it in a small octavo. The curious are looking out, some for flattery, some for Ironies in it; the four folks think they have found out some: But your admirers here, I mean every man of taste, affect to be certain, that the Profession of friendship to Me in the same poem, will not suffer you to be thought a Flatterer. My hap∣piness is that you are too far engaged, and in spite of you the ages to come will celebrate me, and know you were a friend who loved and esteemed me, although I dyed the object of Court and Party hatred.</P>
<P>Pray, who is that Mr. Glover, who writ the Epic Poem called Leonidas, which is re-print∣ing here, and hath great vogue? We have fre∣quently good Poems of late from London. I have just read one upon Conversation, and two or three others. But the croud do not incum∣ber you, who, like the Orator or Preacher, stand alost, and are seen above the rest, more than the whole assembly below.</P>

<P>I Sent a letter to you some weeks ago, which my Lord Orrery inclosed in one of his, to which I receiv'd as yet no answer, but it will be time enough when his Lordship goes over, which will be, as he hopes, in about ten days, and then he will take with him <Q>“all the letters I preserved of yours, which are not above twenty-five. I find there is a great chasm of some years, but the dates are more early than my two last journeys to England, which makes me imagine, that in one of those journeys I carried over another Cargo.”</Q> But I cannot trust my memory half an hour; and my disorders of deafness and giddiness increase daily. So that I am declining as fast as it is easily possible for me, if I were a dozen years older.</P>
<P>We have had your volume of letters, which, I am told, are to be printed here: Some of those who highly esteem you, and a few who know you personally, are grieved to find you make no distinction between the English Gentry of this Kingdom, and the savage old Irish (who are only the vulgar, and some Gentlemen who
<PB N="303" REF="326"/>
live in the Irish parts of the Kingdom) but the English Colonies, who are three parts in four, are much more civilized than many Counties in England, and speak better English, and are much better bred. And they think it very hard, that an American who is of the fifth generation from England, should be allowed to preserve that title, only because we have been told by some of them that their names are entered in some parish in London. I have three or four Cou∣sins here who were born in Portugal, whose pa∣rents took the same care, and they are all of them Londoners. Dr. Delany, who, as I take it, is of an Irish family, came to visit me three days ago, on purpose to complain of those pas∣sages in your Letters; he will not allow such a difference between the two climates, but will assert that North - Wales, Northumberland, Yorkshire, and the other Northern Shires have a more cloudy ungenial air than any part of Ireland. In short, I am afraid your friends and admirers here will force you to make a Pa∣linody.</P>
<P>As for the other parts of your volume of Letters, my opinion is, that there might be collected from them the best System that ever was wrote for the Conduct of human life, at least to shame all reasonable men out of their Follies and Vices. It is some recommenda∣tion
<PB N="304" REF="327"/>
of this Kingdom, and of the taste of the people, that you are at least as highly cele∣brated here as you are at home. If you will blame us for Slavery, Corruption, Athe∣ism, and such trifles, do it freely, but include England, only with an addition of every other Vice.—I wish you would give orders against the corruption of English by those Scriblers, who send us over their trash in Prose and Verse, with abominable curtailings and quaint modern∣isms.—I now am daily expecting an end of life: I have lost all spirit, and every scrap of health; I sometimes recover a little of my hear∣ing, but my head is ever out of order. While I have any ability to hold a commerce with you, I will never be silent, and this chancing to be a day that I can hold a pen, I will drag it as long as I am able. Pray let my Lord Or∣rery see you often; next to yourself I love no man so well; and tell him what I say, if he vi∣sits you. I have now done, for it is evening, and my head grows worse. May God always protect you, and preserve you long, for a pat∣tern of Piety and Virtue.</P>

<P>I Have yours of July 25, and first I desire you will look upon me as a man worn with years, and sunk by public as well as personal vexations. I have entirely lost my memory, uncapable of conversation by a cruel deafness, which has last∣ed almost a year, and I despair of any cure. I say not this to encrease your compassion (of which you have already too great a part) but as an excuse for my not being regular in my Let∣ters to you, and some few other friends. I have an ill name in the Post-Office of both Kingdoms, which makes the Letters addressed to me not seldom miscarry, or be opened and read, and then sealed in a bungling manner be∣fore they come to my hands. Our friend Mrs. B. is very often in my thoughts, and high in my esteem; I desire, you will be the messenger of my humble thanks and service to her. That superior universal Genius you describe, whose hand-writing I know towards the end of your Letter, hath made me both proud and happy; but by what he writes I fear he will be too soon gone to his Forest abroad. He began in the Queen's time to be my Patron, and then de∣scended to be my Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="329"/>
It is a great favour of Heaven, that your health grows better by the addition of years. I have absolutely done with Poetry for several years past, and even at my best times I could produce nothing but trifles: I therefore reject your compliments on that score, and it is no compliment in me; for I take your second Dia∣logue that you lately sent me, to equal almost any thing you ever writ; although I live so much out of the world, that I am ignorant of the facts and persons, which, I presume, are very well known from Temple-bar to St. James's; (I mean the Court exclusive.)</P>
<Q>“I can faithfully assure you, that every let∣ter you have favour'd me with, these twenty years and more, are sealed up in bundles, and delivered to Mrs. W—, a very worthy, rational, and judicious Cousin of mine, and the only relation whose visits I can suffer: All these Letters she is directed to send safely to you upon my decease.”</Q>

You never deceived me, even when you were a great Minister of State: and yet I love you still more, for your condes∣cending to write to me, when you had the ho∣nour to be an Exil.

<P>I am more and more con∣vinced that your letters are neither lost nor burnt: but who the Dean means by a <HI>safe hand</HI> in Ireland, is beyond my power of guessing, tho' I am particularly acquainted with most, if not all, of his friends. As I know you had the recovery of those Letters at heart, I took more than ordinary pains, to find out where they were; but my en∣quiries were to no purpose, and, I fear, whoever has them, is too tenacious of them to dis∣cover where they lie. <Q>“Mrs. W—did assure me she had not one of them, and seem'd to be under great uneasiness that you should imagine they were left with her. She likewise told me she had stop'd the Dean's let∣ter which gave you that information; but believed he would write such an∣other; and therefore de∣sir'd me to assure you, from her, that she was to∣tally ignorant where they were.”</Q></P>

<P>I Saw Mr. M. yesterday who has rea∣dily allowed Mr. V. to copy the Pic∣ture. I have enquired for the best Originals of those two subjects, which, I found, were fa∣vorite ones with you, and well deserve to be so, the Discovery of Joseph to his Brethren, and the Resignation of the Captive by Scipio. Of the latter, my Lord Burlington has a fine one done by Ricci, and I am promised the other in a good Print from one of the chief Italian Paint∣ers. That of Scipio is of the exact size one would wish for a Basso Relievo, in which man∣ner, in my opinion, you would best ornament your Hall, done in Chiaro oscuro.</P>
<P>A man not only shews his Taste, but his
<PB N="311" REF="334"/>
Virtue, in the choice of such ornaments: And whatever example most strikes us, we may rea∣sonably imagine, may have an influence upon others. So that the History itself, if well cho∣sen, upon a rich man's walls, is very often a better lesson than any he could teach by his conversation. In this sense, the Stones may be said to speak when Men cannot, or will not. I can't help thinking (and I know you'll join with me, you who have been making an Al∣tar-piece) that the zeal of the first Reformers was ill placed, in removing <HI>pictures</HI> (that is to say, examples) out of Churches; and yet suffer∣ing <HI>Epitaphs</HI> (that is to say, flatteries and false history) to be the burthen of Church walls, and the shame, as well as derision, of all ho∣nest men.</P>
<P>I have heard little yet of the subscription <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">For his own Edit. of the 1st Vol. of his letters; under∣taken at Mr. Allen's request.</NOTE>. I intend to make a visit for a fortnight from home to Lady Peterborow at Southampton, about the middle of May. After my return I will inquire what has been done; and I really believe, what I told you will prove true, and I shall be honourably acquitted of a task I am not fond of <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The printing his letters by subscription.</NOTE>. I have run out my leaf, and will only add my sincere wishes for your happiness of all kinds. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Need not say I thank you for a Letter, which proves so much friendship for me. I have much more to say upon it than I can, till we meet. But, in a word, I think your notion of the value of those things<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His Letters.</NOTE> is greatly too high, as to any service they can do to the public; and, as to any advantage they may do to my own Character, I ought to be content with what they have done already. I assure you, I do not think it the least of those advantages that they have occasioned me the good-will (in so great a degree) of so worthy a man <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Allen's friendship with the Author was con∣tracted on the sight of his Letters, which gave the for∣mer the highest opinion of the other's general benevo∣lence and goodness of heart.</NOTE>. I fear (as I must rather retrench than add to their number, unless I would publish my own commendations) that the common run of Subscribers would think themselves injured by not having every thing, which discretion must suppress; and this, they (without any other consideration than as buyers of a book) would call giving them an imperfect collection: whereas the only use to my own character, as
<PB N="313" REF="336"/>
an Author, of such a publication, would be the suppression of many things: and as to my character as a Man, it would be but just where it is; unless I could be so vain, for it could not be virtuous, to add more and more honest sentiments; which, when done <HI>to be printed,</HI> would surely be wrong and weak also.</P>
<P>I do grant it would be some pleasure to me to expunge several idle passages, which will otherwise, if not go down to the next age, pass, at least, in this, for mine; altho' many of them were not, and, God knows, none of them are my present sentiments, but, on the contrary, wholly disapproved by me.</P>
<P>And I do not flatter you when I say, that pleasure would be increased to me, in know∣ing I should do what would please <HI>you.</HI> But I cannot persuade myself to let the whole bur∣den, even tho' it were a public good, lie upon you, much less to serve my private fame entire∣ly at another's expence <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mr. A. offered to print the Letters at his own ex∣pence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, understand me rightly▪ Did I believe half so well of them as you do, I would not scruple your assistance; because I am sure, that to occasion you to contribute to a real good would be the greatest benefit I could oblige you in. And I hereby promise you, if ever I
<PB N="314" REF="337"/>
am so happy as to find any just occasion where your generosity and goodness may unite for such a worthy end, I will not scruple to draw upon you for any sum to effect it.</P>
<P>As to the present affair; that you may be convinced what weight your opinion and your desires have with me, I will do what I have not yet done: I will tell my Friends I am as willing to publish this book as to let it alone. And, rather than suffer you to be taxed at your own rate, will publish, in the News, next win∣ter, the Proposals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I tell you all these particulars to shew you how willing I am to follow your advice, nay, to accept your assistance in any moderate de∣gree. But I think you should reserve so great a proof of your benevolence to a better occa∣sion.</P>
<P>Since I wrote last, I have found, on further inquiry, that there is another fine picture on the subject of Scipio and the Captive, by Pietro da Cortona, which Sir Paul Methuen has a sketch of: and, I believe, is more expressive than that of Ricci, as Pietro is famous for expression. I have also met with a fine Print of the disco∣very of Joseph to his Brethren, a design, which, I fancy, is of La Sueur, and will do perfectly well.</P>

<P>I Do not write too often to you for many reasons; but one, which I think a good one, is, that Friends should be left to think of one another for certain intervals without too frequent memorandums: it is an exercise of their friendship, and a trial of their memory: and moreover to be perpetually repeating assu∣rances, is both a needless and suspicious kind of treatment with such as are sincere: not to add the tautology one must be guilty of, who can make out so many idle words as to fill pages with saying one thing. For all is said in this word, <HI>I am truly yours.</HI></P>
<P>I am now as busy in planting for myself as I was lately in planting for another. And I thank God for every wet Day and for every Fog, that gives me the head-ach, but prospers my works. They will indeed outlive me (if they do not die in their Travels from place to place; for my Garden, like my Life, seems, to me, every day to want correction, I hope, at least, for the better) but I am pleased to think my Trees will afford shade and fruit to others, when I shall want them no more. And it is no sort of grief to me, that those others will
<PB N="316" REF="339"/>
not be Things of my own poor body: But it is enough, they are Creatures of the same Spe∣cies, and made by the same hand that made me. I wish (if a wish would transport me) to see you in the same employment: and it is no partiality even to you, to say it would be as pleasing to the full to me, if I could improve your works as my own.</P>
<P>Talking of works, mine in prose are above three quarters printed, and will be a book of fifty and more▪sheets in quarto. As I find, what I imagined, the slowness of subscribers, I will do all I can to disappoint <HI>you</HI> in particu∣lar, and intend to publish in January, when the Town fills, an Advertisement, that the book will be delivered by Lady-day, to oblige all that will subscribe, to do it. In the mean time, I have printed Receipts, which put an end to any persons delaying upon pretence of <HI>doubt,</HI> by determining that time. I send you a few that you may see I am in earnest, endeavouring all I can to save your money, at the same time that nothing can lessen the obligation to me.</P>

<P>I Was very sorry to hear how much concern your humanity and friendship betrayed you into upon the false report which occasioned your grief. I am now so well, that I ought not to conceal it from you, as the just reward of your goodness which made you suffer for me. Perhaps when a Friend is really dead (if he knows our concern for him) he knows us to be as much mistaken in our sorrow as you now were: so that, what we think a real evil is, to such spi∣rits as see things truly, no more of moment than a meer imaginary one. It is equally as God pleases; let us think or call it good or evil.</P>
<P>I wish the world would let me give myself more to such people in it as I like, and dis∣charge me of half the honours which persons of higher rank bestow on me; and for which one generally pays a little too much of what they cannot bestow, Time and Life. Were I arrived to that happier circumstance, you would see me at Widcombe, and not at Bath. But whether it will be as much in my power as in my wish, God knows. I can only say, I think of it with the pleasure and sincerity becoming one who is, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THE event<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Queen's death.</NOTE> of this week or fortnight has filled every body's mind and mine so much, that I could not get done what you de∣sired as to Dr. P. but as soon as I can get home, where my books lie, I will send them to Mr. K. The death of great persons is such a sort of surprize to <HI>all,</HI> as every one's death is to himself, tho' both should equally be expected and prepared for. We begin to esteem and commend our superiors, at the time that we pity them, because then they seem not above ourselves. The Queen shewed, by the con∣fession of all about her, the utmost firmness and temper to her last moments, and thro' the course of great torments. What character hi∣storians will allow her, I do not know; but all her domestic servants, and those nearest her, give her the best testimony, that of sincere tears. But the Public is always hard; rigid at best, even when just, in its opinion of any one. The only pleasure which any one, either of high or low rank, must depend upon receiving, is in the candour or partiality of friends, and that small circle we are conversant in: and it is therefore the greatest satisfaction to such as wish us well,
<PB N="319" REF="342"/>
to know we enjoy that. I therefore thank you particularly for telling me of the continuance, or rather increase of those blessings which make your domestic life happy. I have nothing so good to add, as to assure you I pray for it, and am always faithfully and affectionately, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IT is a pain to me to hear your old complaint so troublesome to you; and the share I have borne, and still bear too often, in the same com∣plaint, gives me a very feeling sense of it. I hope we agree in every other sensation besides this; for your <HI>heart</HI> is always right, whatever your body may be. I will venture too to say, my body is the worst part of me, or God have mercy on my soul. I can't help telling you the rapture you accidentally gave the poor wo∣man (for whom you left a Guinea, on what I told you of my finding her at the end of my garden) I had no notion of her want being so great, as I then told you, when I gave her half a one. But I find I have a pleasure to come, for I will allow her something yearly, and that may be but one year, for, I think, by her looks she is not less than eighty. I am determined to
<PB N="320" REF="343"/>
take this charity out of your hands, which, I know, you'll think hard upon you. But so it shall be.</P>
<P>Pray tell me if you have any objection to my putting your name into a poem of mine (inci∣dentally, not at all going out of the way for it) provided I say something of you, which most people would take ill, for example, that you are no man of high birth or quality? You must be perfectly free with me on this, as on any, nay, on every other occasion.</P>

<P>I Ought sooner to have acknowledged yours; but I have been severely handled by my Asthma, and, at the same time, hurried by bu∣siness that gave an increase to it by catching cold. I am truly sorry to find that neither yours nor Mrs. A.'s disorder is totally removed: but God forbid your pain should continue to return every day, which is worse by much
<PB N="321" REF="344"/>
than I expected to hear. I hope your next will give me a better account. Poor Mr. Be∣thel too is very ill in Yorkshire. And, I do assure you, there are no two men I wish better to. I have known and esteemed him for every moral virtue these twenty years and more. He has all the charity, without any of the weak∣ness of—; and, I firmly believe, never said a thing he did not think, nor did a thing he could not tell. I am concerned he is in so cold and remote a place, as in the Wolds of York∣shire, at a hunting-seat. If he lives till spring, he talks of returning to London, and, if I pos∣sibly can, I would get him to lye out of it at Twickenham, tho' we went backward and forward every day in a warm coach, which would be the properest exercise for both of us, since he is become so weak as to be deprived of riding a horse.</P>
<P>L. Bolingbroke stays a month yet, and I hope Mr. Warburton will come to town before he goes. They will both be pleased to meet each other; and nothing, in all my life, has been so great a pleasure to my nature, as to bring deserving and knowing men together. It is the greatest favour that can be done, either to great genius's or useful men. I wish too, he were a while in town, if it were only to lye a little in the way of some proud and power∣ful

<P>I Thank you very kindly for yours. I am sure we shall meet with the same hearts we ever met; and I could wish it were at Twick∣enham, tho' only to see you and Mrs. Allen twice there instead of once. But, as matters have turned out, a decent obedience to the go∣vernment has since obliged me to reside here, ten miles out of the capital; and therefore I must see you here or no where. Let that be an additional reason for your coming and stay∣ing what time you can.</P>
<P>The utmost I can do, I will venture to tell you in your ear. I may slide along the Surrey side (where no Middlesex justice can pretend any cognizance) to Battersea, and thence cross the water for an hour or two, in a close chair, to dine with you, or so. But to be in town, I
<PB N="323" REF="346"/>
fear, will be imprudent, and thought insolent. At least, hitherto, all comply with the pro∣clamation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">On the Invasion, at that time threatened from France and the Pretender.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I write thus early, that you may let me know if your day continues, and I will have every room in my house as warm for you as the own∣er always would be. It may possibly be, that I shall be taking the secret flight I speak of to Battersea, before you come, with Mr. Warbur∣ton, whom I have promised to make known to the only great man in Europe, who knows as much as He. And from thence we may re∣turn the 16th, or any day, hither, and meet you, without fail, if you fix your day.</P>
<P>I would not make ill health come into the scale, as to keeping me here (tho', in truth, it now bears very hard upon me again, and the least accident of cold, or motion almost, throws me into a very dangerous and suffering condi∣tion.) God send you long life, and an easier enjoyment of your breath than I now can ex∣pect, I fear, &amp;c.</P>

I can only say, you do him too much honour, and me too much right, so odd

It is indeed the same system as mine, but illustrated with a ray of your own, as they say our natural body is the same still when it is glorified. I am sure I like it better than I did before, and so will every man else. I know I meant just what you explain, but I did not explain my own meaning so well as you. You understand me as well as I do myself, but you express me better than I could express my∣self. Pray accept the sincerest acknowledg∣ments. I cannot but wish these letters were put together in one book, and intend (with your leave) to procure a translation of part, at least, of all them into French <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">They were all translated into that language by a French gentleman of condi∣tion, who is now in an e∣minent station in his own country.</NOTE>; but I shall not proceed a step without your consent and opi∣nion, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IT is a real truth that I should have written to you oftener, if I had not a great respect for you, and owed not a great debt to you. But it may be no unnecessary thing to let you know that most of my friends also pay you their thanks; and some of the most knowing, as well as most candid Judges think me as much beholden to you as I think myself. Your <HI>Let∣ters</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the</HI> Essay on Man.</NOTE> meet from such with the Approbation they merit, and I have been able to find but two or three very slight Inaccuracies in the

whole book, which I have, upon their observa∣tion, altered in an exemplar which I keep a∣gainst a second Edition. My very uncertain state of health, which is shaken more and more every winter, drove me to Bath and Bristol two months since; and I shall not return to∣wards London till February. But I have re∣ceived nine or ten Letters from thence on the success of your book <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Commentary on the Essay on Man.</NOTE>, which they are earnest to have translated. One of them is begun in France. A French gentleman, about Monsieur Cambis the Ambassador, hath done the great∣est part of it here.

Pray, suffer me to be what you have made me, one of them, and let my house have its share of you: or, if I can any way be instrumental in accom∣modating you in town during your stay, I have lodgings and a library or two in my disposal; which, I believe, I need not offer to a man to whom all libraries ought to be open, or to one who wants them so little; but that 'tis possi∣ble you may be as much a stranger to this

about Bath and Bristol, endeavouring to amend a complaint which more or less has troubled me all my life: I hope the regimen this has obliged me to, will make the remainder of it more philosophical, and improve my resigna∣tion to part with it at last.

He is the same person who translated the <HI>Essay</HI> into prose, which Mr. Crouzaz should have profited by, who, I am really afraid, when I lay the circumstances all together, was moved to his proceeding in so very unreasonable a way, by some malice either of his own, or some other's: tho' I was very willing, at first, to impute it to ignorance or prejudice. I see nothing to be added to your work; only some commendatory Deviations from the Ar∣gument itself, in my favour, I ought to think might be omitted.</P>

<P>YOU could not give me more pleasure than by your short letter, which acquaints me that I may hope to see you so soon. Let us meet like men who have been many years ac∣quainted with each other, and whose friendship is not to begin, but continue. All forms should be past, when people know each other's mind so well: I flatter myself you are a man after my own heart, who seeks content only from within, and says to greatness, <HI>Tuas habeto tibi res, egomet habebo meas.</HI> But as it is but just your other friends should have some part of you, I insist on my making you the first visit in London; and thence, after a few days, to car∣ry you to Twitenham, for as many as you can afford me. If the press be to take up any part of your time, the sheets may be brought you hourly thither by my waterman: and you will have more leisure to attend to any thing of that sort than in town. I believe also I have most of the Books you can want, or can easily bor∣row them. I earnestly desire a line may be left at Mr. R.'s, where and when I shall call upon you, which I will daily enquire for, whe∣ther I chance to be here, or in the country.

<P>IT is true that I am a very unpunctual cor∣respondent, tho' no unpunctual agent or friend; and that, in the commerce of words, I am both poor and lazy. Civility and Com∣pliment generally are the goods that letter∣writers exchange, which, with honest men, seems a kind of illicite trade, by having been, for the most part carried on, and carried fur∣thest by designing men. I am therefore re∣duced to plain enquiries, how my friend does, and what he does? and to repetitions, which I am afraid to tire him with, <HI>how much I love him.</HI> Your two kind letters gave me real satis∣faction, in hearing you were safe and well; and in shewing me you took kindly my unaf∣fected endeavours to prove my esteem for you, and delight in your conversation. Indeed my languid state of health, and frequent deficiency of spirits, together with a number of dissipa∣tions, <HI>et aliena negotia centum,</HI> all conspire to throw a faintness and cool appearance over my
<PB N="334" REF="357"/>
conduct to those I best love; which I perpetu∣ally feel, and grieve at: But in earnest, no man is more deeply touched with merit in ge∣neral, or with particular merit towards me, in any one. You ought therefore in both views to hold yourself what you are to me in my opinion and affection; so high in each, that I may perhaps seldom attempt to tell it you. The greatest justice, and favour too that you can do me, is to take it for granted.</P>
<P>Do not therefore commend my talents, but instruct me by your own. I am not really learned enough to be a judge in works of the nature and depth of yours. But I travel thro' your book as thro' an amazing scene of ancient Egypt or Greece; struck with veneration and wonder; but at every step wanting an instruc∣tor to tell me all I wish to know. Such you prove to me in the walks of antiquity; and such you will prove to all mankind: but with this additional character, more than any other searcher into antiquities, that of a genius equal to your pains, and of a taste equal to your learning.</P>
<P>I am obliged greatly to you, for what you have projected at Cambridge, in relation to my Essay <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope desired the editor to procure a good translation of the <HI>Essay on Man</HI> into latin prose.</NOTE>; but more for the motive which did
<PB N="335" REF="358"/>
originally, and does consequentially in a man∣neer, animate all your goodness to me, the opinion you entertain of my honest intention in that piece, and your zeal to demonstrate me no irreligious man. I was very sincere with you in what I told you of my own opinion of my own character as a poet<SUP>b</SUP>, and, I think I may conscientiously say, I shall die in it. I have no∣thing to add, but that I hope sometimes to hear you are well, as you certainly shall now and then hear the best I can tell you of myself.</P>

<P>I Am grown so bad a correspondent, partly thro' the weakness of my eyes, which has much increased of late, and partly thro' other disagreeable accidents (almost peculiar to me) that my oldest as well as best friends are rea∣sonable enough to excuse me. I know you are of the number who deserve all the testimonies of any sort, which I can give you of esteem and friendship; and I confide in you, as a man of candour enough, to know it cannot be otherwise, if I am an honest one. So I will say no more on this head, but proceed to thank <NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>a</SUP> See his life.</NOTE>
<PB N="336" REF="359"/>
you for your constant memory of whatever may be serviceable or reputable to me. The Tran∣slation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Of his <HI>Essay on Man</HI> into latin prose.</NOTE> you are a much better judge of than I, not only because you understand my work bet∣ter than I do myself, but as your continued fa∣miliarity with the learned languages, makes you infinitely more a master of them. I would only recommend that the Translator's attention to Tully's Latinity may not preclude his usage of some <HI>Terms</HI> which may be more <HI>precise</HI> in modern philosophy than such as he could serve himself of, especially in matters metaphysical. I think this specimen close enough, and clear al∣so, as far as the classical phrases allow; from which yet I would rather he sometimes deviat∣ed, than suffered the sense to be either dubious or clouded too much. You know my mind perfectly as to the intent of such a version, and I would have it accompanied with your own remarks translated, such only I mean as are ge∣neral, or explanatory of those passages, which are concise to any degree of obscurity, or which demand perhaps too minute an attention in the reader.</P>
<P>I have been unable to make the Journey I designed to Oxford, and Lord Bathurst's, where I hoped to have made you of the party. I am going to Bath for near two months. Yet
<PB N="337" REF="360"/>

I will not give you the pain of acquainting you what they are. Your simile of B. and his nephew, would make an excellent epigram. But all Satire is become so ineffectual (when the last step that Virtue can stand upon, <HI>shame,</HI> is taken away) that Epigram must expect to do no∣thing even in its own little province, and up∣on it its own little subjects.

<P>IF I had not been made by many accidents so sick of letter-writing, as to be almost
<PB N="338" REF="361"/>
afraid of the shadow of my own pen, you would be the person I should oftenest pour myself out to: indeed for a good reason, for you have given me the strongest proofs of understanding, and accepting, my meaning in the best manner; and of the candour of your heart, as well as the clearness of your head. My vexations I would not trouble you with, but I must just mention the two greatest I now have. They have print∣ed in Ireland, my letters to Dr. Swift, and (which is the strangest circumstance) by his own consent and direction <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.

The other is one that will continue with me till some prosperous event to your service shall bring us nearer to each other. I am not content with those glympses of you, which a short spring visit af∣fords; and from which you carry nothing away with you but my sighs and wishes, without any real benefit.</P>
<P>I am heartily glad of the advancement of your <HI>second Volume</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Of</HI> the Divine Lega∣tion.</NOTE>; and particularly of the <HI>Di∣gressions,</HI> for they are <HI>so much more of you;</HI> and I can trust your judgment enough to depend up∣on their being pertinent.

not, verify the good proverb, that the fur∣thest way about, is the nearest way home: and much better than plunging thro' thick and thin, <HI>more Theologorum;</HI> and persisting in the same old track, where so many have either broken their necks, or come off very lamely.</P>
<P>This leads me to thank you for that very en∣tertaining, and, I think, instructive story of Dr. W***, who was, in this, the image of***, who never admit of any remedy from a hand they dislike. But I am sorry he had so much of the modern Christian rancour, as, I believe, he may be convinced by this time, that the kingdom of Heaven is not for such.</P>

<P>THE general indisposition I have to writ∣ing, unless upon a belief of the necessity or use of it, must plead my excuse in not do∣ing it to you. I know it is not (I feel it is not) needful to repeat assurances of the true and con∣stant friendship and esteem I bear you. Ho∣nest and ingenuous minds are sure of each other's; the tye is mutual and solid. The use of writing letters resolves wholly into the gra∣tification given and received in the knowledge of each other's welfare: Unless I ever should be so fortunate (and a rare fortune it would be)
<PB N="341" REF="364"/>
to be able to procure, and acquaint you of, some real benefit done you by my means. But Fortune seldom suffers one disinterested man to serve another. 'Tis too much an insult upon her to let two of those who most despise her favours, be happy in them at the same time, and in the same instance. I wish for nothing so much at her hands, as that she would per∣mit some great Person or other to remove you nearer the banks of the Thames; tho' very lately a nobleman, whom you esteem much more than you know, had destined &amp;c.—</P>
<P>I thank you heartily for your hints; and am afraid if I had more of them, not on this only, but on other subjects, I should break my reso∣lution, and become an author anew: nay a new author, and a better than I yet have been; or God forbid I should go on jingling only the same bells!</P>
<P>I have received some chagrin at the delay of your Degree at Oxon <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This relates to an ac∣cidental affair which hap∣pened this summer, in a ram∣ble that Mr. P. and Mr. W. took together, in which Oxford fell in their way, where they parted; Mr. P. after one day's stay going westward, and Mr. W. who staid a day after him, to vi∣sit the dean of C. C. return∣ing to London. On this day the Vice-chancellor, the Rev. Dr. L. sent him a mes∣sage to his lodgings, by a person of eminence in that place, with an usual compli∣ment, to know if a Doctor's degree in Divinity would be acceptable to him; to which such an answer was return∣ed as so civil a message de∣served. About this time, Mr. Pope had the same offer made him of a Doctor's de∣gree in Law.

<P>I Am always naturally sparing of my letters to my Friends; for a reason I think a great one; that it is needless after experience, to re∣peat assurances of Friendship; and no less irk∣some to be searching for words, to express it over and over. But I have more calls than one for this letter. First, to express a satisfaction at your resolution not to keep up the ball of dispute with Dr. M. tho', I am satisfied, you could have done it; and to tell you that Mr. L. is pleased at it too, who writes me word upon this occasion, that he must infinitely esteem a Divine, and an Author who loves Peace better than Victory. Secondly, I am to recom∣mend to you as an author, a bookseller in the room of the honest one you have lost, Mr. G. and I know none who is so worthy, and has so good a title in that character to succeed him as Mr. Knapton. But my third motive of now troubling you is my own proper interest and pleasure. I am here in more leisure than I can possibly enjoy even in my own house, <HI>vacare literis.</HI> It is at this place, that your ex∣hortations may be most effectual, to make me resume the studies I have almost laid aside, by
<PB N="345" REF="368"/>
perpetual avocations and dissipations. If it were practicable for you to pass a month or six weeks from home, it is here I could wish to be with you: And if you would attend to the continu∣ation of your own noble work, or unbend to the idle amusement of commenting upon a poet, who has no other merit, than that of aiming by his moral strokes to merit some re∣gard from such men as advance Truth and Vir∣tue in a more effectual way; in either case, this place and this house would be an inviola∣ble asylum to you, from all you would desire to avoid, in so public a scene as Bath. The worthy man, who is the master of it, invites you in the strongest terms; and is one who would treat you with love and veneration, ra∣ther than what the world calls civility and re∣gard. He is sincerer and plainer than almost any man now in this world, <HI>antiquis moribus.</HI> If the waters of the Bath may be serviceable to your complaints (as I believe from what you have told me of them) no opportunity can ever be better. It is just the best season. We are told the Bishop of Salisbury is expected here daily, who, I know, is your friend: at least, though a bishop, is too much a man of learn∣ing to be your enemy. You see I omit nothing to add to the weight in the balance, in which,
<PB N="346" REF="369"/>
however, I will not think myself light, since I have known your partiality. You will want no servant here. Your room will be next to mine, and one man will serve us. Here is a Library and a Gallery ninety feet long to walk in, and a coach whenever you would take the air with me. Mr. ALLEN tells me, you might on horseback be here in three days; it is less than 100 miles from Newarke, the road through Leicester, Stow in the Wolde in Gloucestershire, and Cirencester by Lord Ba∣thurst's. I could engage to carry you to Lon∣don from hence, and I would accommodate my time and journey to your conveniency.</P>

I hope this will find you before you set out. For I think (on all considerations) your best way will be to take London in your way. It will secure you from accidents of weather to travel in the coach, both thither, and from thence hither. But in particular, I think you should take some care as to Mr. G.'s executors. And I am of opinion, no man will be more service∣able in settling any such accounts than Mr. Knapton, who so well knows the trade, and is of so acknowledged a credit in it. If you can stay but a few days there, I should be glad; tho' I would not have you omit any necessary thing to yourself. I wish too you would just see ***, tho' when you have pass'd a month here, it will be time enough, for all we have to do in town, and they will be less busy, pro∣bably, than just before the Session's opens, to think of men of letters.</P>

be then alive, as yet he is) his old servant—In that case I think to go with him, and if it should be at a season when the waters are beneficial (which agree particularly with him too) would it be an impossibility to meet you at Mr. Allen's? whose house, you know, and heart are yours.

And this misfortune of my own dulness, and my own absence, only quickens my ardent wish that some good fortune would draw you nearer, and enable me to enjoy both, for a greater part of our lives in this neighbourhood; and in such a situa∣tion, as might make more beneficial friends, than I, esteem and enjoy you equally.—I have again heard from Lord * * and another hand, that the Lord I writ to you of, declares an intention to serve you. My answer (which they re∣lated to him) was, that he would be sure of your acquaintance for life, if once he served,
<PB N="354" REF="377"/>
or obliged you; but that, I was certain, you would never trouble him with your expectation, tho' he would never get rid of your gratitude.—Dear Sir, adieu, and let me be sometimes certified of your health. My own is as usual; and my affection the same, always yours.</P>

<P>I Write to you amongst the very few I now desire to have my Friends, merely, <HI>Si valeas, valeo.</HI> 'Tis in effect all I say: but it is very literally true, for I place all that makes my life desirable in their welfare. I may truly affirm, that vanity or interest have not the least share in any friendship I have; or cause me now to cultivate that of any one man by any one let∣ter. But if any motive should draw me to flat∣ter a great man, it would be to save the friend I would have him serve from doing it. Rather than lay a deserving person under the necessity of it, I would hazard my own character and keep his in dignity. Tho', in truth, I live in a time when no measures of conduct influence the success of one's applications, and the best thing to trust to is chance and opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="378"/>
I only meant to tell you, I am wholly yours, how few words so ever I make of it.—A greater pleasure to me is, that I chanced to make Mr. Allen so, who is not only worth more than—intrinsically; but, I foresee, will be effectually more a comfort and glory to you every year you live. My confidence in any man less truly great than an honest one is but small.—</P>
<P>I have lived much by myself of late, partly thro' ill health, and partly to amuse myself with little improvements in my garden and house, to which possibly I shall (if I live) be soon more confined. When the Dunciad may be pub∣lished I know not. I am more desirous of car∣rying on the best, that is your edition of the rest of the <HI>Epistles</HI> and <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> &amp;c. I know it is there I shall be seen most to advan∣tage. But I insist on one condition, that you never think of this when you can employ your∣self in finishing that noble work of the <HI>Divine Legation</HI> (which is what, above all, <HI>iterum ite∣rumque monebo)</HI> or any other useful scheme of your own. It would be a satisfaction to me at present only to hear that you have supported your health among these epidemical disorders, which, tho' not mortal to any of my friends, have afflicted almost every one.</P>

<P>I Wish that, instead of writing to you once in two months, I could do you some service as often; for I am arrived to an age when I am as sparing of words as most old men are of mo∣ney, though I daily find less occasion for any. But I live in a time when benefits are not in the power of an honest man to bestow; nor indeed of an honest man to receive, consi∣dering on what terms they are generally to be had. It is certain you have a full right to any I could do you, who not only monthly, but weekly of late, have loaded me with favours of that kind, which are most acceptable to ve∣teran Authors; those garlands which a Com∣mentator weaves to hang about his Poet, and which are flowers both of his own gathering and painting too; not blossoms springing from the dry Author.</P>
<P>It is very unreasonable after this, to give you a second trouble in revising the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Editor did revise and correct it as it now stands in the last edition.</NOTE> <HI>Essay on Homer.</HI> But I look upon you as one sworn to suffer no errors in me: and tho' the common way with a Commentator be to erect them into beauties, the best office of a Critic is to correct and amend

<P>YOU may well expect letters from me of thanks: but the kind attention you shew to every thing that concerns me is so manifest, and so repeated, that you cannot but tell your∣self how necessarily I must pay them in my heart, which makes it almost impertinent to say so. Your alterations to the Preface and Essay<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prefix'd to his Homer's Iliad.</NOTE> are just; and none more obliging to me than where you prove your concern, that my notions in my first writings should not be repug∣nant
<PB N="358" REF="381"/>
to those in my last. And you will have the charity to think, when I was then in an er∣ror, it was not so much that I thought wrong or perversely, as that I had not thought sufficient∣ly. What I could correct in the dissipated life I am forced to lead here, I have: and some there are which still want your help to be made as they should be.—Mr. Allen depends on you at the end of the next month or in September, and I will join him as soon as I can return from the other party. I believe not till Sep∣tember at soonest.—You will pardon me (dear Sir) for writing to you but just like an attorney or agent. I am more concerned for your Finances<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">His debt from the Executor of Mr. G.</NOTE> than your Fame; because the first, I fear, you will never be concerned about your∣self; the second is secure to you already, and (whether you will or not) will follow you.</P>
<P>I have never said one word to you of the pub∣lic. I have known the greater world too long to be very sanguine. But accidents and occasions may do what Virtue would not; and God send they may! Adieu. Whatever becomes of public Virtue, let us preserve our own poor share of the private. Be assured, if I have any, I am with a true sense of your merit and friendship, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AN unwillingness to write nothing to you, whom I respect; and worse than nothing (which would afflict you) to one who wishes me so well, has hitherto kept me silent. Of the Public I can tell you nothing worthy the re∣flection of a reasonable man; and of myself on∣ly
<PB N="360" REF="383"/>
an account that would give you pain; for my asthma has increased every week since you last heard from me, to the degree of confining me totally to the fire-side; so that I have hardly seen any of my friends but two, who happen to be divided from the world as much as my∣self, and are constantly retired at Battersea. There I have past most of my time, and often wish'd you of the company, as the best I know to make me not regret the loss of all others, and to prepare me for a nobler scene than any mortal greatness can open to us. I fear by the account you gave me of the time you design to come this way, one of them (whom I much wish you had a glympse of) will be gone again, unless you pass some weeks in London before Mr. Allen arrives there in March. My pre∣sent indisposition takes up almost all my hours, to render a very few of them supportable: yet I go on softly to prepare the great edition of my Things with your Notes, and as fast as I re∣ceive any from you, I add others in order.—</P>
<P>I am told the Laureat is going to publish a very abusive pamphlet. That is all I can desire; it is enough, if it be abusive and if it be his. He threatens you; but, I think, you will not fear or love him so much as to answer him, though you have answered one or two as dull. He will be more to me than a dose of harts∣horn:
<PB N="361" REF="384"/>
and as a stink revives one who has been oppressed with perfumes, his railing will cure me of a course of flatteries.</P>
<P>I am much more concerned to hear that some of your Clergy are offended at a verse or two of mine <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ver. 355 to 358. second book of the Dunciad.</NOTE>, because I have a respect for <HI>your</HI> Clergy, (though the verses are harder up∣on <HI>ours.)</HI> But if they do not blame <HI>you</HI> for de∣fending those verses, I will wrap myself up in the layman's cloak, and sleep under your shield.</P>
<P>I am sorry to find by a letter two posts since from Mr. Allen, that he is not quite recovered yet of all remains of his indisposition, nor Mrs. Allen quite well. Don't be discouraged from telling me how you are: for no man is more yours than, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IF I was not ashamed to be so behind hand with you, that I can never pretend to fetch it up (any more than I could in my present state, to overtake you in a race) I would par∣ticularize which of your letters I should have answered first. It must suffice to say I have re∣ceived them all; and whatever very little re∣spites

I have had, from the daily care of my malady, have been employed in revising the papers <HI>on the use of Riches,</HI> which I would have ready for your last revise, against you come to town, that they may be begun with while you are here.—I own, the late encroachments upon my constitution make me willing to see the end of all further care about me or my works. I would rest for the one, in a full re∣signation of my Being to be disposed of by the Father of all mercy; and for the other (though indeed a trifle, yet a trifle may be some ex∣ample) I would commit them to the candour of a sensible and reflecting judge, rather than to the malice of every short-sighted and malevo∣lent critic, or inadvertent and censorious rea∣der. And no hand can set them in so good a light, or so well turn their best side to the day as your own. This obliges me to confess I have for some months thought myself going, and that not slowly, down the hill. The rather as every attempt of the physicians, and still, the last medicines more forceable in their na∣ture, have utterly fail'd to serve me. I was at last, about seven days ago, taken with so violent a fit at Battersea, that my friends Lord M. and Lord B. sent for present help to the surgeon; whose bleeding me, I am persuaded, saved my life, by the instantaneous effect it had; and
<PB N="363" REF="386"/>
which has continued so much to amend me, that I have pass'd five days without oppression, and recovered, what I have three months want∣ed, some degree of expectoration, and some hours together of sleep. I am now got to Twitenham, to try if the air will not take some part in reviving me, if I can avoid colds; and between that place and Battersea with my Lord B. I will pass what I have of life, while he stays (which I can tell you, to my great satisfaction will be this fortnight or three weeks yet.) What if you came before Mr. Allen, and staid till then, instead of postponing your journey long∣er? Pray, if you write, just tell him how ill I have been, or I had wrote again to him: But that I will do, the first day I find myself alone with pen, ink, and paper, which I can hard∣ly be even here, or in any spirits yet to hold a pen.

<PB REF="389"/>
<HEAD>THE LAST WILL and TESTAMENT OF ALEXANDER POPE, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. I Alexander Pope, of Twickenham, in the county of Middlesex, make this my last Will and Testament. I resign my Soul to its Crea∣tor in all humble hope of its future happiness, as in the disposal of a Being infinitely good. As to my Body, my will is, that it be buried near the monument of my dear Parents at Twickenham, with the addition, after the words <HI>filius fecit</HI>—of these only, <HI>et sibi: Qui obiit anno</HI> 17—<HI>aetatis</HI>—and that it be carried to the grave by six of the poorest men of the pa∣rish, to each of whom I order a suit of grey coarse cloth, as mourning. If I happen to die at any inconvenient distance, let the same be done in any other other parish, and the Inscrip∣tion be added on the monument at Twicken∣ham. I hereby make and appoint my particu∣lar
<PB N="368" REF="390"/>
friends, Allen lord Bathurst, Hugh earl of Marchmont, the honourable William Murray his Majesty's solicitor general, and George Arbuthnot, of the court of Exchequer, Esq. the survivors or survivor of them, Executors of this my last Will and Testament.</P>
<P>But all the manuscript and unprinted papers which I shall leave at my decease, I desire may be delivered to my noble Friend, Henry St. John, lord Bolingbroke, to whose sole care and judgment I commit them, either to be pre∣served or destroyed; or, in case he shall not sur∣vive me, to the abovesaid Earl of Marchmont. These, who in the course of my Life have done me all other good offices, will not refuse me this last after my Death: I leave them there∣fore this trouble, as a mark of my trust and friendship; only desiring them each to accept of some small memorial of me: That my lord Bolingbroke will add to his library all the vo∣lumes of my Works and Translations of Ho∣mer, bound in red morocco, and the eleven volumes of those of Erasmus: That my lord Marchmont will take the large paper edition of Thuanus, by Buckley, and that portrait of Lord Bolingbroke, by Richardson, which he shall prefer: That my lord Bathurst will find a place for the three statues of the Hercules of Furnese, the Venus of Medicis, and the Apollo
<PB N="369" REF="391"/>
in chiaro oscuro, done by Kneller: That Mr. Murray will accept of the marble head of Ho∣mer, by Bernini; and of Sir Isaac Newton, by Guelfi: and that Mr. Arbuthnot will take the Watch I commonly wore, which the King of Sardinia gave to the late Earl of Peterborow, and he to me on his death-bed; together with one of the pictures of Lord Bolingbroke.</P>
<P>Item, I desire Mr. Lyttelton to accept of the busts of Spencer, Shakespear, Milton, and Dry∣den, in marble, which his royal master the Prince was pleased to give me. I give and de∣vise my library of printed books to Ralph Al∣len, of Widcombe, Esq. and to the Reverend Mr. William Warburton, or to the survivor of them (when those belonging to Lord Boling∣broke are taken out, and when Mrs. Martha Blount has chosen Threescore out of the num∣ber.) I also give and bequeath to the said Mr. Warburton the property of all such of my Works already printed, as he hath written, or shall write Commentaries or Notes upon, and which I have not otherwise disposed of, or alie∣nated; and all the profits which shall arise af∣ter my death from such editions as he shall pub∣lish without future alterations.</P>
<P>Item, In case Ralph Allen, Esq. abovesaid shall survive me, I order my Executors to pay him the sum of One hundred and fifty pounds,
<PB N="370" REF="392"/>
being, to the best of my calculation, the ac∣count of what I have received from him; part∣ly for my own, and partly for charitable uses. If he refuse to take this himself, I desire him to employ it in a way, I am persuaded, he will not dislike, to the benefit of the Bath hos∣pital.</P>
<P>I give and devise to my sister-in-law, Mrs. Magdalen Racket, the sum of Three hundred pounds; and to her sons, Henry, and Robert Racket, One hundred pounds each. I also re∣lease, and give to her all my right and interest in and upon a bond of Five hundred pounds due to me from her son Michael. I also give her the family pictures of my Father, Mother, and Aunts, and the diamond ring my Mother wore, and her golden watch. I give to Erasmus Lewis, Gilbert West, Sir Clement Cotterell, William Rollinson, Nathaniel Hook, Esqrs. and to Mrs. Anne Arbuthnot, to each the sum of Five pounds, to be laid out in a ring, or any memorial of me; and to my servant, John Searl, who has faithfully and ably served me many years, I give and devise the sum of One hundred pounds over and above a year's wages to himself, and his wife; and to the Poor of the parish of Twickenham, Twenty pounds, to be divided among them by the said John Searl: And it is my Will, if the said John
<PB N="371" REF="393"/>
Searl die before me, that the said sum of One hundred pounds go to his wife or children.</P>
<P>Item, I give, and devise to Mrs. Martha Blount, younger daughter of Mrs. Martha Blount, late of Welbeck-Street, Cavendish-Square, the sum of One thousand pounds im∣mediately on my decease: and all the furniture of my grotto, urns in my garden, houshold goods, chattels, plate, or whatever is not other∣wise disposed of in this my Will, I give and devise to the said Mrs. Martha Blount, out of a sincere regard, and long friendship for her. And it is my will, that my abovesaid Execu∣tors, the survivors or survivor of them, shall take an account of all my estate, money, or bonds, &amp;c. and, after paying my debts and le∣gacies, shall place out all the residue upon go∣vernment, or other securities, according to their best judgment; and pay the produce thereof, half-yearly, to the said Mrs. Martha Blount, during her natural life: And after her decease, I give the sum of One thousand pounds to Mrs. Magdalen Racket, and her sons Robert, Henry, and John, to be divided equally among them, or to the survivors or survivor of them; and af∣ter the decease of the said Mrs. Martha Blount, I give the sum of Two hundred pounds to the abovesaid Gilbert West; Two hundred to Mr. George Arbuthnot; Two hundred to his sister,

Mrs. Anne Arbuthnot; and One hundred to my servant, John Searl, to which soever of these shall be then living: And all the residue and remainder to be considered as undisposed of, and go to my next of kin.</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. Pope to Aaron Hill Esq:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The little Thing which you take so kindly, is but a very small part of what I owe you; and whatever my studies, or (to use a properer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) Illeness, are capa∣ble of producing ought to be returned you in mere Gratitude for the Pleasure I have received from your own Writings: In which give me leave to say, your good will to me in particular, is as distinguishable, as the obligation you lay on the Public in ge∣neral. I am very happy in the Envy and silly Attacks of such People, as have awakened the Generosity of so powerful a Defender. Nor am I ashamed of those Weaknesses of mine, which they have exposed in Print (the greatest of which was my thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> candidly of them, to whom I wrote my Letters with so much unguard∣ed Friendliness and Freedom), since you have found a way to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those Weaknesses into Virtue, by your partial regard of them. The Eye of Candour, like the Sun, makes all the Beauties which it sees; it gives colour and Brightness to the mean∣est objects purely by looking on them. I agree with you, that there is a pleasure in seeing the Nature and Temper of Men in the plainest undress; but few Men are of Consequence enough to deserve, or reward, that curiosity. I shall indeed (and so will all Mankind) be highly pleased to see the great C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zar of Muscovy in this Light, drawn by himself▪ like an ancient Master, in rough strokes, without heightening, or shadowing: What a satisfaction to behold that perfect likeness, without art, affecta∣tion, or even the Gloss of Colouring, with a noble Neglect of all that finishing and smoothing, which any other Hand would have been obliged to bestow on so principal a Figure? I write this to a Man whose Judgment I am certain of, and therefore am as certain you will give the World this great Deposition, just as you have received it: There will be no danger of your dressing this Mars too finely, whose Armour is not gold, but adamant, and whose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in all probability is much more strong than it is polish'd. I congratulate you, that this great Treasure is fallen into your Hands; and I congratulate all Europe, that it is to be delivered to them through the Hands of one, who will think it Sacrilege to touch upon, much less to alter, any great Lines of such an Original.</P>
<P>I can make you no better return for your great Compliment upon me (which it would be Arrogance in me to show to any other, and dangerous even to remember myself) but by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elling you, that it is honour enough to reward all my studies, to find my Character and reputation is part of the Care of that person, to whom the fame and

<P>I was unwilling to answer your too obliging Letter (which puts much too great a stress upon my opinion) till I had read your Play with the atten∣tion it deserves; I mean, not once, but several times over. In a Word, to comply with my Judgment will cost you no trouble, except to your Modesty; which is, to act it as soon as possible. Nothing but Triffles have I to object, and which were such as did not once stop one at the first Reading; the Spirit, Design, and Characters, carrying me on, without Stop, Check, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven Intermission. You certainly are Master of the art of the Stage, in the manner of forming and conducting the Design, which I which impossible to be mended; of that great Part, and of the other, the raising the Passions, I will say nothing to you, who know them so much better than myself. I would only point out a few particularities in thought or expression, as material as excepting to a Button on your Coat; or a loose Hair. Two or three Lines I have with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imorousness written on one of your blank Leaves, in Black lead, half afraid to be legible, and not without some hope that before you see them, they may be vanished: So may perhaps my objections, every one of them.

Or must I return you the Play now? Your orders will be obey'd as soon as you give them.—I really rejoice at your Lady's Recovery: I would have her and you think, the air of Richmond is particularly good to re-establish her. Pray let <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hill know, I am ready to believe all the good Things her own Father can see in her: I can safely trust both his Judgments, and his Affections.

<P>Since I am fully satisfied we are each of us sincerely and affectionately Servants to the other, I desire we may be no further mis-led by the warmth of writing on this Subject. If you think I have shown too much Weakness, or if I think you have shown too much warmth, let us forgive one another's Temper. I told you I thought my Letter a silly one; but the more I thought so, the more in sending it I shew'd my First in your good Disposition toward me. I am sorry you took i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir of Neglect, or Superiority: Because I know in my Heart, I had not the least▪ Thought of being any way superior to M<SUP>r</SUP>. Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; and, far from the least design <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o shew Neglect to a Gentleman who was shewing me Civility, I meant in return to shew him a better thing, Sincerity; which I am sorry should be so ill express'd as to seem Rudeness. I meant but to complain as frankly as you, that all complaints on both sides might be out, and at a period for ever: I meant by this to have said a surer Foundation for your opinion of me for the future, that it might no more be shaken by Mistakes or Whispers.</P>
<P>I am sure, Sir, you have a higher Opinion of my Poetry than I myself. But I am so desirous you should have a just one of me every way, that I wish you understood both my Temper in general, and my Justice to you in particular, better than I find my Letter represented them. I wish it the more, since you tell me how i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a picture my Enemies take upon 'em to give, of the Mind of a Man they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter Strangers to. However, you will observe, that much Sple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Emotion are a little inconsistent with Neglect; and an Opinion of Superiority. Towards them God knows, I never fell any Emotions, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t what bad Writers raise in all Men,
<PB N="376" REF="398"/>
those gentle ones of Laughter or Pity: That I was so open, concern'd and serious, with respect to you only, is sure a proof of Regard, not Neglect. For in Truth, nothing ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>'d me, till I saw your Epigram against D<SUP>r</SUP>. S. and me, come out in the Papers: and this, indeed, did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x me, to see One Swan among the Geese.</P>
<P>That the Letters A. H. were apply'd to you in the Papers, I did not know (for I seldom read them); I heard it only from M<SUP>r</SUP>. Savage, as from yourself, and sent my Assurances to the Contrary. But I don't see how the Annotator on the D. could have rectify'd that Mistake, publickly, without particularizing your Name, in a Book where I thought it too good to be inserted. No doubt he has apply'd that Passage in the D. to you, by the Story he tells; but his mention of Bom bast, on by in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome of your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Pieces, I think, was meant to shew, that passage hinted only at that Allegori∣cal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ddiness▪ and not any worse sort of Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, with which some other Writers were charg'd. I hale to say what will not be believed: Yet when I told you, "many ask'd me to whom that oblique praise was meant?" I did not tell you I answerd, it was you. Has it escap'd your observation, that the name is a Syllable too long? Or (if you will have it a Christian Name) is there any other in the whole Book? Is there no author of two Syllables whom it will better fit, not only as getting out of the Allegorical Muddiness, but as having been dipt in the Dirt of Party-Writing, and recovering from it betimes? I know such a Man, who would take it for a Compliment, and so would his Patrons too—But I ask you not to believe this, except you are vastly incli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to it. I will come closer to the Point: Would you have the note left out? It shall. Would you have it expressly vaid, you were not meant? It shall, if I have any Influence on the Editors.</P>
<P>I believe the Note was meant only as a gentle Rebuke, and friendlily: I understood very well the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eat on your part to be the same; and complain'd (you see) of nothing but two or three Lines reflecting on my Behaviour and Temper to other Writers; because I know they were not true, and you cou'd not know they were.</P>
<P>You can not in your cool Judgment think it fair to fix a Man's Character on a point, of which you do not give one Instance? Name but the Man, or Men, to whom I have unjustly omitted approbation or Encouragement, and I'll be ready to do them justice. I think I have publickly prais'd all the best Writers of my Time, except yourself, and such as I have had no fair opportunity to praise. As <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Great and Popular, I've prais'd but few, and those at the Times when they were least popular. Many of those writers have done nothing else but flatter'd the great and popular, or been worse employ'd by 'em in Party-stuff. I do indeed think it no great Pride in me, to speak about them with some air of Superiority; and this, Sir, must be the Cause (and no other) that made me address that▪declaration of my Temper towards them, to you, who had accus'd one of the Contrary; not, I assure you, from the least Imagination of any Resemblance between you and them, either in Merit or Circumstances.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="399" MS="y"/>
I nam'd M<SUP>r</SUP>. Dennis, because you distinguish him from the rest: So do I. But, moreever, he was uppermost in my Thoughts, from having endeavour'd (before your admonition) to promote his Affair, with Lord Wilmington, Lord Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sdown, Lord Blandford, and M<SUP>r</SUP>. Pullency, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who promised one to favour it. But it would be unjust to measure my Good-will by the Effects of it on the Great, many of whom are the last Men in the World who will pay tributes of this so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, from their own ungiving Nature; and many of whom laugh at me when I seriously petition for M<SUP>r</SUP>. Dennis. After this, I must not name the many whom I have fruitlessly solli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited: I hope yet to be more successful. But, Sir, you seem too iniquitous in your Conceptions of me, when you fancy I call'd such Things Services. I call'd 'em but humane Offices: Services I said I would render him, if I could. I would ask a place for life for him; and I have; but that is not in my Power: If it was, it would be a Service, and I wish it. I mentioned the Possibility of M<SUP>r</SUP>. D. 's abusing me for forgiving him, because he actually did, in Print, lately represent my Poor, undesigning, Subscriptions to him, to be the Effect of Fear and Desire; to stop his Critiques upon me. I wish M<SUP>r</SUP>. Hill would (for once) think so can didly of me, as to believe me Sincere in one Declaration, that "I desire no Man to bel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his own Judgment in my Favour." Therefore, the I acknowledge your generous Offer to give Examples of Imperfections rather out of your own Works than mine, in your intended Book; I consent, with all any Heart, to your con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining them to mine; for two Reasons: The one, that I fear your Sensibility that way is greater than any own (by observing you seem too concern'd at that Hint given by the Notes on the D. of a little Fault in the Works of your Youth only): The other is a better, namely, that I intend to amend by your Remarks, and correct the Faults you find, if they are such as I expect from M<SUP>r</SUP>. Hill's cool Judgment.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that any Poetical Talent is all that may (I say not, will) make me remembered: But it is my Morality only that must make me Beloved, or Happy: And if it be any Deviation from Greatness of Mind▪ to prefer Friendships to Fame, or the honest Enjoyments of Life to noisy Praises; I fairly confess that Meanness. Therefore it is, for, that I much more resent any attempt against my moral Character (which I know to be unjust) than any to lessen my poetical one (which for all I know, may be very just).</P>
<P>Pray then, Sir, excuse my weak Letter, as I do your warm one. I end as I begun. You guess'd right, that I was sick when I wrote it: Yours are very well written, but I have neither Health nor time to make mine so. I have writ a whole Book of Retractations of my Writings (which would greatly improve your Criticisms on any Errors), but of my Life and manners I do not yet repent one jot, especially when I find in my Heart I continue to be, without the least <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rimony (even as little as I desire you should bear to myself),</P>

This was all, to the best of my Memory, that pass'd between us; and you may imagine it was some Surprize to me when I saw your Preface a very short time after.

<P>It is a serious Pleasure to me to find you concern'd, that I should do your good Sense and Discernment the Justice it deserves. It is impossible for me not to think just what you would have me on this Head; the whole Spirit and meaning of your Poem shews all little thoughts to be strangers to your Soul. I happen to know many Particulars relating to the Earl of Peterborough's con∣duct, and just Glory, in that Scene you draw so well: But no Man ought (I think) to attempt what you hint at, or can pretend to do him more Ho∣nour than what you yourself here have done, except himself: I have long pres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d him to put together many Papers lying by him, to that End. On this late Occasion he told me you had formerly endeavoured the same, and it comes into my Mind, that, on many of those Papers, I've seen an Endorsement A. H. which I fancy might be those you over look'd. My Lord spoke of you with great Regard, and told me how narrowly you both miss'd of going toge∣ther on an Adventurous Expedition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On an Expedition to the West Indies.</NOTE>. The real Reason I carried him your Poem was, that I imagin'd you would never send it him, of all Mankind; and that I was truly pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>I am troubled to reflect, how unequall a Correspondent I am to you, partly through want of Health (for I have since had a Fever), partly through want of Spirits, and want of Solitude; for the last Thing we Poets care to own, is the other Want; that of Abilities.</P>
<P>But I am sensibly pleased with your Letter, not only that which seem'd to prompt it, but with the Things said in it: And I thank you for both—Believe me desirous to see you: When, and where, you shall determine; tho' I wish it were here: You'll see a place seeming more fit for me than it is; looking Poetical, yet too much in the World; Romantic, and not retir'd: However, I can lock up all avenues to is sometimes, and I know no better Reason for doing so, or for shutting out the World, than to enjoy such a one as your self.</P>

<P>I could not persuade myself to write to you since your great Less, till I hoped you had received some alleviation to it, from the only Hand which can give any, that of time. Not to have mention'd it, however fashion able it may be, I think unnatural, and in some Sense inhuman; and I fear the Contrary Custom is too much an Excuse, in reality, for that Indifference we usually have for the Con∣cern of another: In truth, that was not my Case: I know the Reason of one Man is of little Effect toward the Resignation of another; and when I compar'd the Forces of yours and mine, I doubted not which had the advantage, even tho in your own Concern. 'Tis hard, that in these tender Afflictions the greatness of the Mind and the Goodness are opposite to each other; and that while Reason, and the Consideration upon what Conditions we receive all the Goods of this Life, operate towards our Quiet; over the best of our Passions (which are the same things with the softest of our Virtues) refuse us that Comfort.

<P>It was my Hope you had Thoughts of passing a few Days here abouts, that made me impertinent enough to wish, you would make use of this Place, which is as much at your Service as its Master. It is otherwise too great a Trouble to you, no less than too great a Distinction shown to me, to have you come purposely; much less to give the young Lady the Fatigue of an Afternoon's Visit to what so little merits it. My wish was, that you could have when a Bed here, as long as you could allow your self to be in the Country; and have done me the Pleasure to

<P>I see the Season will not allow me the pleasure of seeing you, nor of shewing my faded garden this year to Miss Urania. I assure you I would willingly make a Trip to London on purpose to see you and her, but my Constitution, of late, has been fiaster in Decline than the year. I have been as ill, as when I writ you that, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish Image of my Soul, a Letter, some time since, which had the good Effect of making us know one another.</P>
<P>This is the first Day I have been able to see Lady S. who shew'd me a very polite Letter of yours that put her out of Countenance. The truth is, she makes no pretension to judge of Poetry. But the Tragedy will be shewn, as I told you, to one, or rather (I think) to Both will be better. I wish you was not so soon to bring it on, by what M<SUP>r</SUP>. Savage tells me of M<SUP>r</SUP>. Booth and M<SUP>rs</SUP>. Porter. I think it will be a Loss both to the Play, and to them, if they do not make one another shine: I hope, in a Week to wait on you in London, and tell you with what plain Truth I am, dear Sir,</P>

<P>There is an ill Fate hangs upon me in re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation to the pleasure I're often (from the very first time I saw you at D<SUP>r</SUP>. Young's) propos'd in our acquaintance. I really stay'd that Night in Town, upon Bowry's Notice, which he left in Writing, that you should be at Home all Wednesday, and had dedicated three hours to you, or more properly, to myself wish you. I ask'd, particularly, for Miss Urania; but thought myself, tho old enough, not familiar enough, to ask to see her. I desire your first Notice, if you come this way; or, rather, I wish you would take up your Lodging with me. In the mean time, pray send the Tragedy of Athelwo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d (for so I would call it), under Cover, to the Countess of Suffolk, before Monday, at her Lodgings in S<SUP>t</SUP>. James's. I promis'd it her again; and if you think it of any Consequence that the K. should see it in Manuscript, I think nothing more easy. In truth, all this is doing it no Credit; 'tis only doing some to those who may commend it. I could not imagine in what parts it needed Addition; sure every incident is well prepar'd: but no Man can see so far into his own Work as the author, if a good one; so little, if a bad or indifferent one.</P>

<P>I thank you for your Tragedy, which I have now read over a Sixth Time; and of which I not only preserve, but increase, my Esteem. You have been kind to this age, in not telling the next, in your Preface, the ill Taste of the Town, of which the Reception you describe it to have given of your Play (worse, indeed, than I had heard, or could have imagin'd), is a more flagrant Instance than any of those Triff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es mention'd in my Epistle; which yet, I hear, the sore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anity of our Pretenders to Taste flinches at extremely—The Title you mention had been a properer to that Epistle–I have heard no Criticisms about it; nor do I listen after them; Nos haec <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>imus e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ihi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (I mean, I think the Verses to be so): But as you are a Man of tnder Sentiments of Honour, I know it will gziev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you to hear another, undeservedly chang'd with a Crime his Heart is free from: For, if there be Truth in the World, I declare to you, I never imagin'd the least Application of what I said of Jimon could be made to the D. of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h—s, than whom there is scarce a more Hameless, worthy, and Ge∣nerous, beneficent Character, among all our Nobility: And if I have not lost my Senses, the Town has lost 'em, by what I heard so sate, as but two Days ago, of the uproar on this Head. I am certain, if you calmly read every particular of that Descrip∣tion, you'll find almost all of 'em point blank the Reverse of that Person's Villa.

Yet it would have been a Pleasure to me, to have found some Friend saying a Word in my Justification, against a most malicious Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shood. I speak of such, as have known by their own Experience, those Twenty Years, that I always took up their Defence, when any stream of Calumny ran upon 'em▪ If it gives the Duke one Moment's uneasiness, I should think myself ill paid, if the whole. Earth admir'd the Poetry; and believe me, would rather never have written a Verse in my Life, than any one of 'em should trouble a truly good Man.

I look upon the Fate of your Piece, like that of a great Trea∣sure, which is bury'd as soon as brought to light; but it is sure to be dug up the next age, and enrich Posterity.</P>
<P>I have been very sensible, on these two occasions, to feel them (as I have done) at a Time, when I daily fear'd the Loss of (what is, and ought to be dearer to one than any Reputation, but that of a Friend, or than any thing of my own, except my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rals) the Loss of a most tender Parent—She is alive▪ and that is all!

<P>I sent you as honest an Answer▪ as I could, to the Letter you favour'd me with; and am sorry you imagine any civil Reproach, or latent meaning, where I meant to express myself with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>most openness.

<P>In what I said; I gave you a true Picture of my own Heart, as far as I know it

myself. It is true, I have shewn a scorn of some Writers; but it proceeded from an Experience that they were bad Men, or bad Friends, or vile <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inelings; in which Case, their being Authors did not make them, to me, either more respectable, or more formidable. As for any other Pique, my Mind is not so susceptible of it as you have seem'd, on each Occasion, too much inclin'd (I think) to believe. what may have sometimes seem'd a Neglect of others, was rather a Laziness to cultivate or contract new Friends, when I was satisfied with those I had; or when I apprehend∣ed their Demands were too high for me to answer.</P>
<P>I thank you for the Confidence you shew you have in me, in selling me what you judge a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iss in my Nature. If it be (as you too partially say) my only Fault, I might soon be a perfect Character: For I would endeavour to correct this fault in myself, and intreat you to correct all those in my Writings; I see by the Specimen you generously gave me in your late Seller, you are able to do it, and I would rather a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and (and own Serve) that Correction to your Friendship, than to my own Industry.</P>

I am sorry yours was attended with any Thoughts less pleasing, either from the Conduct towards you of the World in general, or of any one else in particular. As to the Subject matter of the Letter, I found what I have often done in receiving Letters from those I most esteem'd and most wished to be esteem'd by; a great pleasure in reading it, and a great inability to answer it, I can only say, you oblige me, in seeming so well to know me again; as one extremely willing that the free Exercise of Criticism should extend over my own Writings, as well as those of others, whenever the Public may receive the least Benefit from it; as I question not they will a great deal, when exerted by you.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have now little to say of your Tragedy, which I return with my Thanks for your Indulgence to my Opinion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lutely deser'd to, that I wish I had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roso'd less, frequently. I cannot, find another thing I think a fault in you. But my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord thinks, three things may yet reconsider'd. Brutus, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Sight of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sign'd for his Death, takes at once the Resolution of murdering Ce∣sar, as none of his Father. Que<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Whether in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ene that follows between him and Cesar, all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nderness on the side of Brutus, and all beyond the point of Honour that Friendship exacted, should not rather be avoided than heigh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned?</P>
<P>Another Quere is, Whether it would not bege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more Indignation in the Au∣dience against Cassius and more Compassion, for Cesar, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Cassius suspected Brutus to be Cesars Sen, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acted from Brutus the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aring neither Father, Relation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The third thing is, Whether the Efforts made by Cesar to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the Civil War, not only by the equall Offer he made, while the matter was under Deba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the senate (and which the Consuls Lentulus and Marcellus refused to report to the Senate), but by the Message he sent to Pempcy, when he was at Brandasion, to desire a Meeting, to settle the Matter, and avoid the Civil War.—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. bell. Civili, lib. I. The mention of these somewhere in the Hay might help to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Prepossession against Cesar.</P>
<P>After our little Cavils (for so we will rather call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and verbal Points of Cri¦sicism) we owe you the Justice to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> highly, what we highly approve, and you need not desire us to speak as we think: 'Tis what we have (in different Ways) done all our Lives, where it was to our prejudice, and cannot but do here, where it is to our Honour. I only wish you a Stage, Actors, and an Audi∣ence worthy of you, and it.—I have often wished to live to see the Day when Prologues and Epilogues should be no more. I wish a great Genius would break thro' the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy, useless, Formality. But at least I would have one try, to leave the Audience full of the Effects of a good Tragedy, without an Epilogue. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et
<PB N="390" REF="412" MS="y"/>
me add another Hint, concerning the apparatus and Circumstantials of your Play (since I have nothing left more to wish in the Play itself); that you would intitle i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> barely. The Tragedy of Cesar, and give no Intimation of his being a Patrie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for I fear, instead of preparing the Audience, it might revolt them, and put all the little Criticks upon carping previously <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the very design and Cha∣racter; which would appear by and with the proper Preparations, in the Piece on the Stage. Another thing was a Thought of my Lord's, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be printed before Acting, a day or two; for the Sentiments are so thick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, and the Sense so deep sometimes, that they require more attention and Thought than the Hearer may be apt to give on the first Representation. I am not positive▪ either as to this, or my Thought, but submit them to your Consideration.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add, but to lament <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur unhappiness, that we cannot see you personally to conform what these Letters tell you, of our real Opinion of your Work, Esteem of its Author, and wishes for your Success, in this, and every thing.</P>

<P>I have been confirmed by M<SUP>r</SUP>.

<P>I must express, on my own Part, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Regret to be so little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to you.

<P>I have felt an uneasing's of Mind (occasioned by a conscious sense, here unequally I have express'd any Anger and Contempt, at the Treatment of your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ar by the Man of the stage) ever since I fast wrote to you; and a Hundred Interruptions from Day to Day (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r I have lived in the World, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and idle World both, it is) have ever since hindered me from enjoying one Hour of collected Thought.

I have yet seen but three. Acts of M<SUP>r</SUP>. Thomson's, but I am told, and believe by what I have seen, that it excess in the Pathetic.

<P>I am obliged to you for your Compliment, and can truly say, I never gave you just Cause of Complaint. You once misteck on a Booksellers Idle Report, and publickly express'd your Mistake; yet you mistech a Second time; that two initial Letters, only, were meant of you, tho every Letter in the Alphabet was put in the same manner; and, in Truth (except some few), those Letters were set at Random to occasion what they did Occasion, the Suspicion of bad and jealous Writers, of which Number I could never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M<SUP>r</SUP>. Hill. and most of whose Names I did not know.</P>
<P>Upon this Mistake you were too ready to attach me, in a paper of very pretty Verses, in some publick Journal.—I should imagine the Dunciad meant you a real Compliment, and so it has been thought by many, who have ask'd, to whom that Passage made that oblique Panegyrich? As to the Notes I am weary of telling a great Truth, which is, that I am not Author of 'em; tho I love Truth so well, as fairly to tell you, Sir, I think even that Note a Commendation, and should think myself not ill us'd to have the same Words said of me: Therefore, believe me, I never was other than Friendly to you, in my own Mind.</P>
<P>Have I not much more Reason to complain of the Cavea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Where give me Leave,
<PB N="393" REF="415"/>
Sir, to tell you, with the same Love of Truth, and with the Frankness is inspir'd (which, I hope, you will see, thro this whole Letter), I am <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly abus'd, in being represented "Sneakingly to approve, and want the Worth to cherish, or be friend Men of Merit." It is, indeed, Sir, a very great Error: I am sorry the Author of that Reflection knew me no better, and happen'd to be unknown to those who could have better inform'd him: For I have the Charity to think, he was misted only by his Ignorance of me, and the Be∣nevolence to Forgive the worst thing that ever (in my Opinion) was said of me, on that Supposition.</P>
<P>I do faithfully assure you, I never was angry at any Criticism made on my Poetry, by whomsoever: If I could do W. Dennis any humane office I would, tho' I were sure he would abuse me personally To-morrow; therefore it is no great Merit in me to find, at my Heart, I am your Servant. I am very sorry you ever was of another Opinion.—I see, by many Marks, you distin∣guish'd me from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>temporary Writers: Had we known one another, you had distinguish'd me from others, as a Man, and no ill, or ill-natured one. I only wish you knew, as well as I do, how much I prefer Qualities of the Heart to those of the Head: I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow to God, I never thought any great Matters of my Poetical Capacity; I only thought it a little better, comparatively, than that of some very mean Writers, who are too proud.—But, I do know cer∣tainly, my moral Life is superier to that of most of the Wits of these Days.
