<HEAD>THE LIFE and CHARACTER of the late Capt. <HI>Goodere,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE having been many false and injurious Reports spread, and with great Industry propogated to the Disadvantage of a Gentleman who had been so unhappy as to bring himself under the greatest Disadvantage before, in order to do his Character Justice, we shall pro∣ceed to give the following impartial Account of him.</P>
<P>Having thus pav'd the way to the History of a Life, which the Hand of publick Justice has put an End to, we shall go up to the Fountain Head, and trace the unhappy Person, who is the principal Subject of the following Sheets; from his Cradle to his unexpected, much lamented, and most deplorable Catastrophe; we will begin with his Original, and follow him thro' the various Scenes of uncertain Life, till we view him a pub∣lick Spectacle for one of the most heinous Offences, in the sight of God and Man, that human Na∣ture is capable of.</P>
<P>We shall be led, and that naturally enough too, or rather necessitated, in order to be full and faithful in our Memoirs, to bring the unfortu∣nate
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Brother who fell in Ireland, with him who fell by the Captain's hand, and the Father of the unfortunate Family, as it may well be call'd, up-the Stage; and without injuring the Memories of the Dead; without fear of offering any offence on one hand, or false incense on the other, to their surviving Relations, we shall as much record the behaviour of each, as may be consistent with our design of furnishing out a Treatise fit for publick Perusal.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Samuel Goodere</HI> the mournful Subject which at present engrosses our Attention, was the third, youngest Son of Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> of <HI>Burhope</HI> in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> Bart. by the only Daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Dineley</HI> of <HI>Charlton</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> Bart. and <HI>Frances,</HI> Sister to the Earl of <HI>Rockingham</HI>; and for the better explain∣ing, how Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> came by the large Estate he was possess'd of, even in the Life-time of his Father Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> we must be some∣thing more particular on that Head, than there would otherwise be Occasion for.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s Lady, as we have just observed, was the only Daughter, of Sir <HI>Edward Dineley,</HI> Bart. Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s Estate was much inferior to what the young Lady was Heir to, at the time he courted her, not above a thou∣sand Pounds a Year, whereas Miss <HI>Dineley,</HI> if her Father dy'd without any other Issue, was sure if she liv'd, of at least three times as much: This Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> knew very well, and there∣fore made his first Addresses secretly to the young Lady herself, being determined to engage her Affections, if possible, before he broke the Mat∣ter to Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI>; and by this Method he
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
succeed so much to his satisfaction that Miss <HI>Dine∣ly</HI> became absolutely engaged to him, before her Father or Mother knew any thing of the Mat∣ter.</P>
<P>Having thus secured a main Point, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> thought he might now, safely enough, propose the Match, which he did accordingly; but for a long time it met with great Opposition from all, but Miss <HI>Dinely</HI> herself; who at length contriv'd a way to let her Father and her Mamma know, that she was engaged, and had actually promised, and sworn to Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> to have him, and to have nobody else: This had the desired Effect, for, rather than baulk the young Lady, force her to break her Word, or cross her Incli∣nation, the Matter was made up; the Marriage was agreed to and completed. Miss <HI>Dinely</HI> had a handsome Fortune given her when she married; but a much handsomer afterwards; for at her Father's Death she came in for the whole of the <HI>Dinely</HI> Estate, which was rather better than Three Thousand Pounds a Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and this was by Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI>'s Will, who settled it, after her decease, upon her eldest Son, by virtue of which, the late Sir <HI>John Dinely,</HI> <STAGE><HI>who was oblig'd by his Grandfath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r's Will to take the Name of Dinely</HI></STAGE> came in upon the Death of the Lady <HI>Goodere,</HI> his Mo∣ther, for an Estate, much superior to his own Father's: Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI> liv'd many Years after the Marriage of his Daughter, and within a few years as long as the Lady <HI>Goodere</HI> herself.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> had three Sons and one Daughter by this Lady, who was his only Wife, tho' he long surviv'd her; and happy would it have been, considering what sad Ends they have
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
all come to, had neither of the Sons ever been born.</P>
<P>The Grandfather, by the Mother's Side, liv'd to see the two eldest arrive to Man's Estate, and the youngest within a few Years of it. The eldest Brother, as Heir Expectant of a very noble Fortune; had an Education suitable to what he was one Day, had he lived, to come into the Pos∣session of, and brought up a Gentleman; but the other two, when of a proper Age, and after having had an Education at School suitable there∣to, were sent to Sea.</P>
<P>The eldest of the two had not been long at Sea, hardly long enough to commence Sailor, but an Accident happen'd, which gave a sudden Turn to his Fortune and Expectations in the World: An Accident, which brought him with∣in View of both the Honour and Estate he was possess'd of when he fell a Sacrifice to his Bro∣ther's Resentment and Cruelty.</P>
<P>And this Accident was the first Misfortune which fell to the share of the unfortunate Off∣spring of Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>: His eldest Son, whose name was <HI>Edward,</HI> and call'd after his Fa∣ther and Grandfather, by the Mother's Side, was then in <HI>Ireland</HI>; where a Gentleman and he hav∣ing some Words, matters were at length car∣ry'd so high, that it was determined the Sword should decide the Quarrel; and they fought ac∣cordingly: Mr. <HI>Goodere</HI> had the worst of it, and his lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Life was the Consequence of the En∣gagement; thus first fell the eldest Son, to the in∣expressible Grief of his whole Family, and of Sir <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ward Dinely</HI> in particular, who had taken a more than ordinary liking to him, and had al∣ways
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
shewn a very great Affection for him; which arose 'tis said, nor only from his being his eldest Grandson and his Namesake, but from his Accom∣plishments, and the Indications the young Gen∣tleman early gave of his agreeable Acquirements, and many amiable Qualities of Body and Mind.</P>
<P>This young Gentleman being dead, his Brother then Heir, after his Mother, to the <HI>Dineley</HI> Estate, was the lately murder'd Man: He was taken from Sea as soon as could be done, and little did he ever think afterwards, that he should lose his Life on board a Ship; and especially by the hands of his own Brother, till the hour which brought him to his Death, and his Murderers within al∣most sight of theirs.</P>
<P>Bring at home, the late Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> suc∣ceeded, if not to the Affection his Father and Grandfather had for his deceased Brother, at least to the Regards which had been paid to him, as the eldest hopes of the Family, and now he was con∣sidered as such, and treated as such by both; and instead of the Sailor he was design'd for, they endeavoured to form him for the Gentleman, that he might become and fill up the higher Station in Life, Providence had given him a prospect of acting in: But these were attempts they were not over successful in, there was something in his cast of Thought, in his turn of Mind, in his whole Frame and Constitution which they could never tho∣roughly get the better of; but found themselves much baffled in the Methods they took to polish and refine his Memory, and render him the social fine Gentleman his late Brother had given so ma∣ny Testimonies of, had Providence thought fit to prolong'd his Days, and placed him in the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
situation the late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> at his Mother's Death came to be placed in. 'Tis much to be feared that it was greatly owing to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s un∣steadiness of Temper, and to a too constant un∣happiness of behaviour, to say no worse of it, thro' the course of many Years, that the Captain's Re∣sentment arose against his Brother, and that these have been the main provocations to the dreadful Tragedy we have been witness to, and which the Friends to both have so much Cause to lament.</P>
<P>The late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> being taken from Sea, as mention'd, was sometimes with his Father in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and sometimes with his Grandfather in <HI>Worcestershire</HI>; being oblig'd by them both, <HI>and as some say, against his Will,</HI> to give over all Thoughts of returning to Sea, or of any other Employment or Business, but such as was fit for a young Gentleman of Fortune to be engag'd in; but his Brother, the late Captain, was continu'd at Sea, as the way design'd for his Advancement in the World; and he carry'd himself very well, got the good Word of the Captain he sailed with, and behav'd much to the Satisfaction of his own Father.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Dinely</HI> did not long survive the Death of his Grandson Mr. <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> whom he was extremely fond of; and 'twas even thought that the unhappy, untimely Fate, which that young Gentleman met with, did not a little contribute to the shortening of his Days: This was succeeded by Lady <HI>Goodere</HI>'s Death, who, a few Years after her Father, paid the like Debt to Nature, and left the <HI>Dinely</HI> Estate to become the Inheritance of the lately murder'd Baronet, and reduced his Fa∣ther, Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> thereby to his original
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
Estate of about Eight Hundred or a Thousand Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>This great Encrease of his Fortune might have made <HI>John Dinely,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>for he was no more during his Father's Life,</HI> one of the happiest Men in the World; but, perhaps, if we were critically to examine the Matter, we should find it was the Cause of his Misconduct and Death.</P>
<P>He marry'd a Gentleman's Daughter near <HI>Bri∣stol,</HI> an Heiress; with whom he had Twenty Thou∣sand Pounds, who, besides this opulent Fortune, to Youth and Beauty, was added every amiable Quality of Mind, and desirable Accomplishment, towards inhancing and compleating his Felicity; but the Lady's Endeavours to render Life agree∣able to him, became in vain, and all her Wishes for his Happiness were render'd abortive.</P>
<P>But all Men are not equal, or rather very few are so, to superior Stations in Life which they are unexpectedly lifted up to; and which neither Na∣ture or Education has fitted them for: Too much Wealth has undone many a Man, whose encrease of Fortune has been sudden upon him; and the Prosperity of Fools often destroy them; an endless flow of Prosperity and Fullness, with∣out any change of Fortune, or a little Check in their career of Delights, make Men sometimes grow giddy and intoxicated, and they run into Excesses, which, for wanting of some Rubbs in their way, they are not as they ought to be, upon their guard against; and this seems to have been too much the Case, upon many Occasions, with the unfortunate Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI>: He often, too often, gave way to his Resentments, and too great a loose to his Pleasures, and in short the whole
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
tenour of his Conduct, for a series of Years, was such, and so inconsistent with his Brother's, the unhappy Captain <HI>Goodere</HI>'s Behaviour, that the one sunk whilst the other rose in the Esteem and good Opinion of Mankind; and one gain'd upon, whilst the other lost the Affections of Friends and Relations; tho' this Difference in their manner of Life, and ways of Management was not so conspicuous, or did Matters come to the great Extremity they at last arrived at, till many Years after they were both married; and the late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> had a Son drawing on apace towards Manhood, which he had but little more than ar∣rived to when he died, whose Death and coming to Age, open'd more Breaches than one, that never have been clos'd since.</P>
<P>One of these we shall be oblig'd to take No∣tice of, as it will be a Means to assist our come∣ing at the real Motives which could induce a Gentleman, who was always distinguish'd for great Honour and Probity; and as remarkable for his great Humanity and Tenderness, to divest himself of all these at once; and break through all the Ties of Nature, most sacriligiously to im∣brue his Hands in the Blood of his own, and only Brother. The other are Breaches of too ten∣der a Nature for us to touch upon; nor is it re∣quisite we should, they are of too private, too much a family Concern, and it would be making the Wounds to bleed a fresh, for the Publick to be made acquainted with them.</P>
<P>But to return more immediately to Capt. <HI>Good∣ere,</HI> he began the World in the Merchants Service; and learnt the first Rudiments of Naviga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, (ex∣cept what he had been furnish'd with in Theory
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
at School) in the Merchant-way; when have∣ing made several Voyages in safety, and gained the good Word and good Will of the Captains he sail'd with, and being withal duly qualify'd, he got the Command of a Vessel, in the Mer∣chant Service himself; and in that Station made two or three Voyages with Success; but his Views enlarging with his Years and Experience he was determined, if possible, to get preferment in the Navy; and pursuant to this Resolution, enter'd himself on board a Man of War, in the Reign of her late Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> His Father, soon after his going on board, pro∣cured him a Commission and when he had served some Time, according to the Rules prescribed by the Navy, got him made a Lieutenant be∣fore her Majesty's Death: All this Time he con∣ducted himself suitable to his Birth, to his own hopes of Preferment, and to Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s Wishes and Expectations.</P>
<P>And if he behav'd well abroad, he did the same at home; and so became his Father's fa∣vourite Son, the Son in whom he most confided; with whom he conversed most and oftnest, and the Son he seldom or never cared to enter upon any thing of Consequence or Moment, after the Death of his Lady, without having first consulted him. As his judicious Behaviour, and dutiful Carriage to his own Father, gained him his paternal Regard and Affection; so his Sobriety, good Nature, free Conversation, and Candour, discoverable upon all Occasions, gain'd him the Love of his Acquaintance and the general Esteem of the whole Country; and we may, with great Truth assert, that 'till he became guilty of the late direful
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
Action, the unhappy Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI> had as valua∣ble and as well establish'd a Character in <HI>Hereford∣shire,</HI> and in every other place where he came, and was known, as a Gentleman of his Station in Life, could hope for or desire.</P>
<P>Soon after he was made a Lieutenant, with the Consent of Relations on both Sides, he was mar∣ry'd to a young Gentlewoman of a worthy Fami∣ly, and who is much too worthy and valuable in herself, to have her Maiden Name mention'd upon this miserable, melancholy Occasion; who is in∣consoleable for the dreadful Disaster befallen her Brother in Law; for the Disgrace and Infamy brought upon her Children, and for the more dreadful Doom her wretched Husband brought upon himself.</P>
<P>The Captain had a handsome Fortune with his Lady, and equal to the Estate his Father settled upon him, and they was as happy in each other, and always liv'd as happily and as hand∣somely together, as those always do whose Hearts, as well as Interests are united, and make in their continual Study, by every Act of Kindness in their power, to be endearing themselves to one another; and indeed he must have been a Brute of a Man, who could have made a bad Husband to Mrs. <HI>Goodere,</HI> who is by universal Consent al∣low'd, to be as good a Woman as ever was born.</P>
<P>The Differences between the Captain and his Brother grew now every Day greater; and an ir∣reconcileable Enmity seem'd to have commenced; the late Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> took, as the Captain said, a causeless and an unjustifiable Antipathy at him; and shewed he had done so whenever he
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
could. In short they now oppos'd each other up∣on all Occasions when it was possible for them to shew their private Resentments; and appear'd in publick in as different Interests as if they were de∣termined the World should be witness to their in∣veterate hatred of each other.</P>
<P>But the Captain was not the only Person whom Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> used ill, and it was thought that the Captain's taking of his Lady's part against him, for Sir <HI>John</HI>'s unkind usage of her, was one of the principal Reasons of his persecuting the Captain with so much Ill-nature and Rancour.</P>
<P>Such was the Difference in the Behaviour of the two Brothers, that the Gentry in general con∣demn'd that of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s, and the Father not aba∣ting of his Fondness for the Captain, added Fuel to that Flame which already burnt but too fierce∣ly, and made a Compromise of their Differences more difficult, than otherwise perhaps it might have proved. Sir <HI>John</HI>'s high Spirit could not brook this sort of Treatment, and he gave into the fatal Resolution, fatal indeed, as 'tis fear'd it has since prov'd to himself, of cutting off the Entail of his Estate, as soon as his Son should come of Age to join with him in it, and disin∣heriting his Brother, if his Son dy'd without Issue Male.</P>
<P>The late Sir <HI>John</HI> kept to what he had so rashly resolved on; and, when the young Gentle∣man came of Age, he oblig'd him to join with him in his Design of disinheriting his Uncle, and cut off the Entail accordingly; and settled the Estate upon his only Sister, who was married to one Mr. <HI>Fote,</HI> a Gentleman belonging to the Law, and after her Decease, upon her eldest Son.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>This was undoubtedly a Transaction which irri∣tated and exasperated Capt. <HI>Goodere,</HI> more than any thing his Brother had done before, or could have done but this; and more so when he heard of the Death of Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI>'s Son, who, as we since said, died presently afterwards; and 'tis much to be apprehended that the unhappy Captain meditated the direful Revenge he has since taken, for such an Indignity and Injury offer'd to him and his Children, by this unkind Act; however, he smother'd his great Resentment for several Years, and 'till the Death of old Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> their Father; when the Captain met with fresh Disappointment, and Matter to enrage him still more; and when 'tis believed he became more absolutely determin'd, than ever he had been, of putting his bloody Design on foot, when-ever Time would favour him with an Opportunity of performing it effectually.</P>
<P>There were many other Quarrels between the two Brothers, which as we have hinted, we could write at large and give the World all the Particu∣lars of, but those we think should now be bury'd in everlasting Oblivion: If the unfortunate Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> was to blame, as undoubtedly he was in many of them, he has paid dearly for his having been to blame; and we would not disturb his Ashes, with any recapitulation of his Weakness and Miscarriages in Times past; and if the Cap∣tain has likewise been to blame, we would equal∣ly avoid adding to the Grief of his afflicted Fa∣mily, by a Rehearsal of his Faults, who has ac∣counted for them all, and received from the Justice of his Country a Punishment equal to the crying Sin he has been guilty of, if it is within the Power
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
of Man to inflict a Punishment equal to so heinous an Offence.</P>
<P>To go back then to Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI> who was Lieutenant of a Man of War; he carry'd himself in a becoming manner to all below him, as well as to all above him, he became beloved by both Officers and Sailors, and shewed great intrepidity and resolution upon all Occasions; tho' whilst he continued a Lieutenant he had not perform'd any remarkable Exploit in his Station, so as to make himself be taken Notice of, yet in time of Action, or any imminent Danger by Storms and Tempest at Sea, he discovered such Calmness of Mind and undaunted Courage and Bravery, that he soon got his Reputation establish'd for as gallant a young Fellow as any in the Navy.</P>
<P>Had he been otherwise, he never would been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to have procur'd his Father's Esteem and Value <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or him as he did to the last: Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI> was himself look'd upon as gallant a Man in his Days as ever drew a Sword in <HI>Britain</HI>; so that Courage was part of his hereditary Inheritance, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd as his Father used to say, was he to have had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Son who did not dare fight, he should think the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oward a Bastard, and that he had none of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood in him; and deserv'd to be disinherited.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI> continued many Years a Lieute∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt only, sometimes in full, but now in half pay, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d it was very lately that he was able to get a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptain's Commission; the reports which have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ely flown about of several brave and gallant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions perform'd by the late Captain, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast of Spain, are all fictitious, and mere inven∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ns, without any Foundation; the Poor unhap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Man, not having drawn any Blood, since he
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
was made a Captain, but what was some of the same, which run in his own Veins, and for the commission of which he has paid the forfeiture of his own Life.</P>
<P>Not any thing deserving particular remark, or worth taking Notice of in the Captain's publick Life is to be found, till he comes to the Command of the <HI>Ruby</HI> Man of War, and even then, only that, which we could heartily wish there was not so much dreadful Reason as there is, to remem∣ber with Horror: The <HI>Ruby</HI> has been an unhappy Ship to the two last Captains of her; Captain <HI>Goodere</HI>'s immediate Predecessor on board, shot him∣self, as 'tis said; and in the very Place where the Ship rode, where her last Commander contam∣minated his Fingers, and dyed them in his Bro∣ther's Blood.</P>
<P>But we are under the obligation to go once more into private Life, with the Captain and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unfortunate Brother Sir <HI>John Dineley Goodere</HI>; and explain a Circumstance or two, which put th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finishing hand to the Work, and brought to Per¦fection what was before but in Embrio: Abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Years ago happened the Demise of their Fa¦ther Sir <HI>Edward Goodere,</HI> who to shew that hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Regard for the Captain and his Family was wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> founded, testify'd they were so by his Will; leav¦ing Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> only Tenant for Life of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Estate at <HI>Burghope</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> and the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Family, and which at Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was to go to the Captain: This usage of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Father provoked Sir <HI>John,</HI> but that it should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was something surprizing, since it was no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or rather much less than what he had no litt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Reason to expect; for it had for sometime befo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
been currently reported, that Sir <HI>Edward</HI> intend∣ed to have cut him off from every Shilling, which it was in his Power to have hindered him of; and leave the Whole immediately to the Captain, and so much did this Report gain Credit in <HI>Here∣fordshire,</HI> that it was generally believ'd, this would have been the Case, had not Sir <HI>Edward Goodere</HI>'s sudden Sickness and Death prevented the execu∣tion of his Design.</P>
<P>Tho' if Sir <HI>John Dineley</HI> was disappointed and displeased at being left only Tenant for Life, the Captain was as much baulk'd at finding that his Father had not been so kind to him, as he was in hopes he would have been; and left that Estate to him, which for some time he had lived in the full expectation of; Some little Contest arose hereup∣on, which, <HI>for us,</HI> shall be nameless, and had better be forgot than remembered, for the sake of both Sides? however it would be doing of the Captain great Injustice, not to let it be known, that he acquiessc'd in what his Father had done, and behaved much better than his Brother upon the Occasion, for so little was Sir <HI>John</HI> from brook∣ing of the Injustice which he pretended, his Fa∣ther had done him, that he would shew his Re∣sentment even to his dead Remains and carry'd his Disgust to the Grave.</P>
<P>To offer all the Indignity to his Father's Corpse in his Power, he not only deny'd it all the Ho∣nours due to his Birth and Fortune, but even a decent Interment, and unattended Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was carry'd to his Grave, and so much of a piece was the whole, that neither Shroud or Coffin was so good as a Gentleman would bury a Servant in, or as are often seen for our Parish Poor; this ig∣nomious
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
Treatment of his Father, and of a Gen∣tleman who had always lived handsomely, had be∣haved well, and been a generous Benefactor to the Poor, raised the Indignation of all Ranks of Peo∣ple, and the whole Country exclaimed loudly again Sir <HI>John</HI>'s shameful Usage of him; such a scandalous Sight had not ever been seen in that Country before, and was such, as 'tis very likely may never be matched either in that, or in any o∣ther Christian Country again.</P>
<P>But if others were displeased and grieved at this shocking Transaction, the Captain was enraged and incensed at it, to the highest Degree; and this dishonour, as he look'd upon it to be done to his deceas'd Father and to his Family, blew up the Coals afresh, and re-kindled the Fire which was not extinguished 'till quench'd with the Blood of him who was chiefly instrumental in making it burn with Fury.</P>
<P>The Captain was now fully determined to dis∣patch Sir <HI>John,</HI> and had form'd divers Schemes to effect his barbarous Resolution, and at last con∣cluded on the very one which was afterwards put in Execution. The Account he gave of the whole Scene of that tragical Affair was as follows:</P>
<P><HI>That about the Beginning of the Month of</HI> January <HI>last he spoke to</HI> Charles Bryan, Edward M'Daniel <HI>and</HI> William Hammond, <HI>and to his Confederates</HI> Mahony <HI>and</HI> White <HI>about seizing the Captain. They seemed at first averse to the Proposal he made them of giving them Money, to seize the Deceased and carry him on board the</HI> Ruby, <HI>but advancing them some∣thing considerable in Hand, and</HI> Mahony <HI>spiriting them on, by plying them well with Liquor, they made no great Difficulty to come into the Captain's Mea∣sures;
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
that they din'd at the</HI> White Hart <HI>on</HI> College Green <HI>the Day the Murder was committed, and that after Dinner, while the before-nam'd Persons were regaling themselves, he went to Mr.</HI> Smith<HI>'s, an Attorney on</HI> College Green, <HI>and begg'd of that Gen∣tleman to introduce him to the deceas'd Sir</HI> John, <HI>that he might have an Opportunity to speak to him, and that he did not then doubt but he should accom∣modate all Differences that were subsisting between them. This Gentleman, not having the least Suspi∣cion of any ill Intention of the Captain's, was very ready to bring them together; and as both Brothers were his intimate Acquaintance, it gave him a good deal of Pleasure to see a Reconciliation. He says, that his Presence surprized his Brother; but the before-mention'd Gentleman informing him of the Cause of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oming, Sir</HI> John <HI>shook Hands, task'd some Time with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, and desir'd he would sit down; that he (the Captain) was uneasy, lest the Fellows who were at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he</HI> White Hart <HI>should drink too much; and when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Evening was clos'd, he persuaded Sir</HI> John <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rry no longer; and as soon as they had left the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse, and got on the Green, he gave the watch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rd to</HI> Mahony <HI>(who stood with his Comrades in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Balcony) and they all instantly rush'd on Sir</HI> John <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d seiz'd him: That Sir</HI> John <HI>cry'd,</HI> Brother, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other, what's the Matter? Who's here? — <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ieves! Thieves! —— <HI>And</HI> Mahony <HI>answer'd, —mn him, along with him: That they had no! got <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on the Green before some Women came by, one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom ask'd,</HI> What was the Matter? <HI>Sir</HI> John <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld have said, I am Sir</HI> John Dinely Goodere, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>as he was uttering the Words, he (the Captain) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dered him, by thrusting one of the Sleeves of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> close up to his Mouth, so that he could not
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
speak: That as they hurried him along, he was ready to drop; so four of the Men, before-mentioned, car∣ried him, and</HI> Mahony <HI>follow'd, telling any Person who came along, that the Man they had got was a Deserter, and had run away with the King's Bounty Money, and was carrying on board to be put in Irons for his Tryal by a Court Martial: That as soon as they got him in the Boat, the three Men first-mentioned left him, and the others, with the Captain's Assistance, carried him on board the</HI> Ruby, <HI>where he lay several Hours before he was strangled, crying out, that they had brought him on board to kill him: This was in a Cabin which was not made use of, either by Officers or any of the Ship's Crew, but re∣serv'd for the Captain to entertain Friends who came on board to see him, and chose to tarry all Night. This Outcry was not overheard but by few of the Crew, who were told, the Deceas'd was a Madman and brought on board purposely that he might not de∣stroy himself; but the Murder being discovered by the Cooper of the Ship, the Scheme was not effected; which, as the Captain has confess'd, was after Sir</HI> John <HI>was strangled, to heave him overboard, and pretend he had got up in the Night, gone out of his Cabin, and accidentally fell into the Sea; and to make this story the more plausible,</HI> Mahony <HI>and</HI> White <HI>(who were the two Murderers) were to say, that they saw the Captain and Sir</HI> John <HI>drinking Punch, and that the Baronet was in Liquor, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Brother pulling him to go to Bed, but that he re∣fused to go before he made him some more Punch, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same Time swearing he would never more come o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> board the Ship, for that the Captain did not tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him handsomely to grudge him Liquor. This w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Scheme intended, but the Cooper as is before o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

and the Centry, whose Place I had taken, seeing me without a Candle, brought one to the Cabbin-Door, but I held my Sword to his Breast, and order'd him to keep back — and this was the very Time that my poor Brother was giving his last Gasp; for about a Minute before, I heard him say, <HI>Oh my poor Life!</HI> and this was the last Word he ever spoke.</P>
<P>In a Minute or two after the Deceased expired, both <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> came out of the Cabbin, and I asked if he was dead? They said he was: And then I went into the Cabbin, and felt my Brother's Corpse, and then lock'd the Cabbin Door, and put the Key into my Pocket, and or∣der'd <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Mahony</HI> to attend me in my Cabbin, where I went and sat down. <HI>Mahony</HI> came in first, and said D——mn me, Captain, we have done it, Boy. Then Ma∣hony gave me my Brother's Gold Watch, and I gave him in return a Silver one, that I wore. As to the Money they took out of his Pockets, they shar'd it, each having up∣wards of 14l. tho' <HI>White</HI> had the most Cash, because <HI>Ma∣hony</HI> had the Watch. About four o'Clock they went into the Yaul, and got on Shore, I having promised to send them Tickets for three Weeks or a Month's Absence from the Ship.</P>
<P>As to the Disposal of the Deceased's Body, we intended to have concealed it 'till the Ship sail'd, and flung it over∣board sew'd up in a Hammock; or if it had been discover∣ed before, then I intended to have prov'd by <HI>Mahony,</HI> that the Deceased strangled himself and could have influenced a Jury to have brought him in Lunatick.</P>
<P>I cannot help reflecting on my Conduct in this unhappy Affair, and what makes a great Impression on me is, when my Brother was first brought into the Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, he told me, <HI>He knew my Intent was to murder him: And</HI> (says he) <HI>why don't your Men throw me over-board now; and then you may go ashore, and hang yourself on the Boats Fore Sheet.</HI> Justice has most deservedly overtaken me; and what gives me the greatest Concern is, that the Death of these two poor Crea∣tures <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> lies at my Door. Pray God for∣give me; for sure never was any Man guilty of so much Wickedness. As to what the Witnesses swore on my Trial, I can contradict no Part of it. They did their Duty, and I forgive them, as I hope, through the Merits of my dear Saviour, the Almighty will forgive me.</P>
<P>This is the Account the Captain gave of the Murder to the Clergymen who attended him, and
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
to some of his particular Friends who visited him while he was under Confinement; but it was re∣markable, that he would not confess any thing till within a few Days of Execution; for on Thursday the 2d Day of this Instant <HI>April,</HI> the Captain's Lady got a Petition, signed by a great many Gentlemen of Credit and Reputation, in his Behalf, presented to the King, recommend∣ing him her Husband as an Object of Compas∣sion; but the Petition had no Effect, and Advice thereof being carried to <HI>Bristol,</HI> the Captain seem∣ed perfectly compos'd, and said he knew he de∣served Death, and therefore would prepare him∣self to die; and on the Saturday, as soon as he received Advice that his Petition was rejected he sent to all the Churches in <HI>Bristol</HI> to be particu∣larly pray'd for, and he was accordingly pray'd for, by Name, throughout the whole City, as were also his two Confederates <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> during the Time they remained under Sentence of Death, as well on Sundays, as at Times of pub∣lick Prayer.</P>
<P>We forgot to mention the Fate of the Villains, viz. <HI>Charles Bryan, Edward Mac Daniel,</HI> and <HI>William Hammon</HI> (who first seized Sir <HI>John</HI>) who were taken up soon after the Murder. These three were try'd and found guilty of an Assault, and each sentenc'd to pay a Fine of 40 s. to re∣main close Prisoners for the Space of one Year, and find sufficient Sureties for their good Behavi∣our for 12 Months after: A very mild Sentence for such Villains, who 'tis certain knew Mr <HI>Goodere</HI>'s Design in seizing his Brother in such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manner, tho' the Law could not prove them a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Accessaries in the Murder. <HI>White</HI> indeed had lik<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
to have escap'd the Gallows, for when the Bill of Indictment was preferr'd to the Grand Jury, the Names of <HI>Goodere</HI> and <HI>Mahony</HI> were only inserted, but the Gentlemen of the Grand Inquest finding there was sufficient Proof to convict all three, a Bill was then preferr'd against <HI>White</HI> (who was before intended as an Evidence for the King) and he was also found guilty; and this was the Reason they were not all try'd on one Day, the Captain and <HI>Mahony</HI> being try'd on <HI>Thursday,</HI> and <HI>White</HI> on the <HI>Saturday</HI> following, the very Day they all re∣ceived Sentence of Death.</P>
<P>The Captain, in passing from the Court House, where he had received Sentence, to Newgate, bow'd to several People, and pull'd of his Hat three Times but appear'd deeply affected, and look'd to the Ground, wrapping himself close in his Scarlet Cloak, the Goaler and two Servants attending him. <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> were both strongly guarded, and put into the Condemned Hold, and three Days after they had received Sentence, an order came to the Goal that <HI>Mahony</HI> (as he had all along been a principal Actor in this Tragedy) should after his Execution be hang'd up in Chains as near as possible where the Fact was committed.</P>
<P>As to the Captain's Behaviour in Prison, it was such as became a Man in his unhappy Circum∣stances, for he behaved penitent to the last. He was often visited by his Wife, and their taking leave of each other was a very moving Scene, and can be only imagined by those, who after a long and strict Union of Hearts and Affections, feel the Pangs of Separation. In him Grief appear'd with a silent gloomy Aspect, and whilst Tears,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
in large Drops, roll'd down his manly Cheeks, a few, short, broken Sentences spoke more the An∣guish of his Heart, and unutterable Concern for his Wife and Children. As to his Wife, her Tears, the wringing her Hands, &amp;c. sufficiently testify'd the Vastness of her Grief, her Heart was, as it were rent in two, and all the dreadful To∣kens of the most abandon'd Despair appear'd in every Gesture, in every Action and Motion, and the most terrifying Agonies were beheld in every distorted Feature of her Countenance. What can be said more, than that she seem'd not only the lively Picture of Grief, but even Grief itself, with all its dismal Attendants, Horror, Anguish, and Despair.</P>
<P>On the Day he suffered he rose at Day-break, and was very fervent in Prayer until the Officers came to demand his Body; the Goaler's Servant, who attended him, went up and told him the Of∣ficers waited, and his Reply was, <HI>I am ready as soon as they please.</HI> He then gave the Man some Silver out of his Pocket, and went down directly, desiring the Spectators present to pray for him.</P>
<P>They were carried to Execution in the Morn∣ing, amongst a vast Crowd of Spectators, and, after some short Prayers at the Gallows, were turn'd off, as they were calling on God to receive their Souls. The Captain's Body was cut down in less than 20 Minutes, and put into a Hearse, in order for a decent Burial.</P>
<P><HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> were both <HI>Irishmen,</HI> under 30; the latter born in <HI>Drogeda.</HI> They dy'd Ro∣man Catholicks. They said they forgave the Captain, as they hop'd to be forgiven. <HI>White</HI> was buried the same Night, and <HI>Mahony</HI> hung up in Irons.</P>
