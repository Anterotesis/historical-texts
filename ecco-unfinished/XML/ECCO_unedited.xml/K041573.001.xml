<HEAD>THE LIFE
OF
CHRISTOPHER SMART.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the life of an Author seldom abounds
with very interesting events, yet of those who have
undertaken to instruct or to amuse mankind, some ac∣count
will be expected. Biography is generally consi∣dered
as one of the most entertaining subjects of Lite∣rature:
but its utility may perhaps be questioned.
Concerning persons of humble and common attain∣ments
we are not wont to be solicitous; and the im∣portant
actions of eminent characters few readers will
be able to imitate. Of these however the Historian is
best informed, and treats them with the greatest satis∣ction.
Yet he is seldom the first of men, who most.
attracts the attention of the public. For, if great
talents be necessarily rare, the opportunities are still
rarer of displaying them to the world; to this a
multitude of events, whose connection is impercepti∣ble
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
to human eyes, must necessarily concur. The ex∣ternal
distinctions therefore between man and man are
derived less from nature than from fortune; so that
most, if not all, of those characters which are held up
to public view, may be considered as a picture of the
human species. To extract from Biography all its
advantages, let the writer restrain his fancy, and the
reader his admiration; let not the first suppose that
he describes a perfect model, nor the latter forget
that he contemplates a man.</P>
<P>Mr. Christopher Smart, the Author of the follow∣ing
Poems, was born at Shipbourne in Kent, the 11th
of April, 1722.</P>
<P>His Father was possessed of an estate of about
3001. a year in that neighbourhood, and having been
originally intended for Holy Orders, had a better
taste for literature than is commonly found in country
gentlemen; a taste which, he transmitted to his Son.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his life our Author was of a
very delicate constitution, having been born earlier
than the natural period; and his body being too fee∣ble
to permit his indulging freely in childish amuse∣ments,
his mind had leisure to exercise and expand
its powers. He discovered a very early taste for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etry; and proved when he was only four years
old, by an extemporary effusion, that even then he had
a relish for Verse and an ear for Numbers. He was
educated at Maidstone, till he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leven years old:
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
on the death of his Father, which happened at that
time, his Mother, Mrs. Winifred Smart, determined
to send him to Durham, where he would have the
advantages of a good school, change of air to
strengthen a weakly frame, and the notice and pro∣tection
of his Father's relations. The family had
been long established in that country. An ancestor
of his, Mr. Peter Smart, had been a Prebendary of
Durham in the reign of Charles the first; and for
resisting innovations in the church worship suffered
considerably both in person and in property; of this
he published an interelling narrative in a pamphlet,
of which few copies now remain. Mr. Smart's
Grandfather married a Miss Gilpin, of the family of
the celebrated Barnard Gilpin, Rector of Houghton
le Spring. The enumeration of ancesitors, remark∣able
only for rank or fortune, is idle ostentation; but
to mention the brave and the good is a tribute due
to merit, and a favour to mankind.</P>
<P>As our Author's Father had been Steward of the
estates in Kent of Lord Barnard, afterwards Earl of
Darlington, the Son was very cordially received at
Raby Castle, when absent, during the holidays, from
School. In this noble family he had the honour of
making an acquaintance with the late Dutchess of
Cleveland, who discerned and patronized his talents.
She allowed him forty pounds a year till her death.
In the Ode to Lord Barnard, he alludes beautifully to
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
his literary habits and to the splendor of his connec∣tions
at this early period of his life.</P>
<P>Mr. Smart did not continue without distinction at
Durham School; and a very learned and eminent
Divine, now living, has expressed obligations to our
Author for his own first successful essays in Latin
Versification. The Master of the School at that
time was the Rev. Mr. Dongworth, an Etonian, and
so eminent a scholar, that in the judgment of one,
who was himself in that station, he would have ob∣tained
the Mastership of that celebrated Seminary,
had it been accessible to simple merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Smart was removed from this place to the
University of Cambridge, when he was seventeen;
being admitted of Pembroke Hall, Oct. 30, 1739.</P>
<P>Though the favourite studies of this Seat of Learn∣ing
were not congenial with his mind, yet his classical
attainments and poetical powers were so eminent, as
to attract the notice of persons, not very strongly pre∣judiced
in favour of such accomplishments. Such was
the force of his genius, and such the vivacity of his
disposition, that his company was very earnestly soli∣cited;
and to suppress or with-hold our talents, when
the display of them is repaid by admiration, is com∣monly
too great an effort for human prudence. He
was therefore quickly involved in habits and ex∣peces,
of which he felt the consequences during the
rest of his life. His allowance from home was scanty;
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
for as his father had died suddenly, and in embarrassed
circumstances, his widowed mother had been com∣pelled
to sell the largest portion of the estate at consi∣derable
loss. Our Author's chief dependance was
the assistance he derived from his College, and from
the Duchess of Cleveland's bounty. Many distin∣guished
characters now living were notwithstanding
of his intimate acquaintance; and it appears, by the
Latin invitation of a friend to supper, preserved
among his works, that he knew how to relish the
Feast of Reason.</P>
<P>In the early part of his residence at Cambridge
he wrote the Tripos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Verses so called are compositions published every year, when the Bachelors of Arts have compleated their de∣grees. Young men of poetical talents are appointed to this employment; and on one side of their paper, the names are printed of those students, who at the public examination, on the occasion just mentioned, have succeeded the best.</NOTE> Poems in the present Col∣lection.
These verses have more system and de∣sign
than is generally found in the compositions of
young Academics: and it is some argument of their
being well approved, that they were all thought
worthy of a translation into English. He was en∣couraged
by the commendations of his friends, to
offer himself a Candidate for a University Scholar∣ship.
The yearly value of these appointments is
barely 20l.; but the election is open to the whole
University under the degree of Master of Arts; and
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
as the electors are of approved learning, and fix their
choice after the strictest scrutiny, the honour of ob∣taining
these Scholarships is considerable. It has
been said that upon this occasion he translated Mr.
Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day; but I do not find
any sufficient authority for such a conjecture; which
is rendered improbable by the length and labour of
the composition. But that a scholar equal to such a
work, in an impartial classical examination should sur∣pass
his competitors, is no matter of surprize.—His
extraordinary success in this poem, induced him to
turn his mind to eother Translations from that fa∣vourite
Bard; and he seems to have written to Mr.
Pope for his approbation. He received from that
gentleman the following Letter:—</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>“TWICKENHAM, <DATE>Nov. 18th.</DATE>”</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>“SIR,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I thank you for the favour of yours;” I would not
give you the trouble of translating the whole Essay
you mention; the two firss;t Epistles are already well
done, and if you try, I could wish it were on the last,
which is less abstracted, and more easly falls into
poetry and common place. A few lines at the be∣ginning
and the conclusion, will be sufficient for a
trial whether you yourself can like the task or not.
I believe the Essay on Criticism will in general be
the more agreeable, both to a young writer, and to
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he majority of readers. What made me wish the
other well done, was the want of a right understand∣ing
of the subject, which appears in the foreign ver∣sions,
in two Italian, two French, and one German.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>There is one indeed in Latin verse printed at Wir∣femberg,
very faithful, bat inelegant; and another
in French prose; but in these the spirit of Poetry is
as much lost, as the sense and system itself in the
others. I ought to take this opportunity of acknow∣ledging
the Latin Translation of my Ode, which you
sent me, and in which I could see little or nothing to
alter, it is so exact. Believe me, Sir, equally desirous
of doing you any service, and afraid of engaging you
in an art so little profitable, tho' so well deserving, as
good poetry.”</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
Your most: obliged
and sincere humble servant,
<SIGNED>A. POPE.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I do not find that he bestowed any farther notice
on our Author, excepting that he received him once
very civilly at his house; and Mr. Smart seems to
have been induced by his suggestion to undertake
and finish the Latin translation of the Essay on Cri∣ticism;
with much praise from the learned, but with∣out
either profit or popularity, He was admitted to
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
the Degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1743, and was
elected Fellow of Pembroke-Hall, July 3, 1745.</P>
<P>About this time he wrote a Comedy, of which no
remains have yet been found, but a few of the Songs,
and the Soliloquy of the Princess Perriwinkle, pre∣served
in the Old Woman's Magazine, which is in∣serted
below.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Princess Perriwinkle sola, attended by fourteca Maids of great honour.</P>
<L>Sure such a wretch as I was never born,</L>
<L>By all the world deserted and forlorn;</L>
<L>This bitter-sweet, this honey-gall to prove,</L>
<L>And all the oil and vinegar of love.</L>
<L><HI>Pride, Love</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> will not let me rest,</L>
<L>But make a dev'lish bustle in my breast.</L>
<L>To wed with Fizgig, <HI>Pride, Pride, Pride</HI> denies,</L>
<L>Put on a Spanish padlock, <HI>Reason</HI> cries;</L>
<L>But tender gentle <HI>Love</HI> with every wish complies.</L>
<L><HI>Pride, Love</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> fight till they are cloy'd,</L>
<L>And each by each in mutual wounds destroy'd.</L>
<L>Thus when a Barber and a Collier fight,</L>
<L>The Barber beats the luckless Collier—white.</L>
<L>The dusty Collier heaves his pond'rous sack,</L>
<L>And, big with vengeance, beats the Barber—black.</L>
<L>In comes the Brickdust man, with grime o'erspread,</L>
<L>And beats the Collier and the Barber—red.</L>
<L>Black, red and white in various clouds arc toss'd,</L>
<L>And in the dust they raise, the combatants are lost.</L>
<P>The following account of the Plot, and Dramatis Personae, in the words of an eminent person, who was an actor in it, may not be unacceptable to our readers. “It was called <HI>A Trip to Cambridge,</HI> or the <HI>Grateful Fair.”</HI> The business of the Drama was laid in bringing up an old country Baronet to admit his nephew a Fellow Commoner at one of the Col∣leges; in which expedition a daughter or niece attended. In their approach to the seat of the Muses, the waters from a heavy rain happened to be out at Fenstanton, which gave a young student of Emmanuel an opportunity of shewing his gal∣lantry as he was riding out, by jumping from his horse and plunging into the flood to rescue the distressed damsel, who was near perishing in the stream, into which she had fallen from her poney, as the party travelled on horseback. The swain being lucky enough to effect his purpose, of course gained an interest in the lady's heart, and an acquaintance with the rest of the family, which he did not fail to cultivate on their arrival at Cambridge, with success as far as the fair one was concerned. To bring about the consent of the father, (or guardian, for my memory is not accurate) it was contrived to have a play acted, of which entertainment he was highly sond; and the Norwich company luckily came to Cambridge just at the time; only one of the actors had been detained on the road; and they could not perform (the play that night, unless the Baronet would consent to take a part; which, ra∣ther than be disappointed of his favourite amusement, he was prevailed upon to do, especially as he was assured that it would amount to nothing more than sittin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great table, and signuing an instrument, as a Justice of Peace might sign a warrant: and, having been some years of the Quorum, he felt himself quite equal to the undertaking. The under play to be acted by the Norwich company on this occasion, was the <HI>Bloody War of the King of Diamonds with the King of Spades;</HI> and the actors in it came on with their respective emblems on their shoulders, taken from the suits of the cards they represented. The Ba∣ronet was the King of one of the parties, and in signing a de∣claration of war, signed his consent to the marriage of his niece or daughter, and a surrender of all her fortune.</P>
<P>After many disappointments in attempting to get an old play-house at Hannibun's the coach-maker's, and afterwards the Free-School in Free School-Lane, it was acted in Pem∣broke College-Hall, the parlour of which made the Green Room. The Dramatis Personae, as far as I recollect them, were</P>

<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
Arts in 1747, and became a candidate for Mr. Sea∣ton's
Prize, and for five years, four of which were in
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
succession, obtained the laurel. Though these are
condessedly, excepting the short poems, the most
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
finished of his works, yet even here confidence in
genius and aversion to the labour of correction some∣times
<PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>
times prevailed over better considerations. One of
these Essays, that on the Divine Goodness, which
was written in London, he so long delayed to under∣take,
that there was barely opportunity to write it
upon paper, and to send it to Cambridge by the most
expeditions conveyance, within the time limited for
receiving the Compositions. That he waited for the
moments propitious to invention, I will rot plead as
his apology; though I cannot agree with our great
Critic,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He (Mr. Gray) had a notion, not very peculiar, that he could not write but at certain times, or at happy moments; a fantastick foppery to which my kindness for a man of learn∣ing and of virtue wishes him to have been superior.</P>
<P>Johnson's Lifeof Gray.</P></NOTE> that such moments will by the wise be never
expected. In works of mere mechanical exertion,
<PB N="xvii" REF="17"/>
or where only the understanding is employed, all
seasons to the industrious will be favourable alike;
but in those, in which we must call on the imagina∣tion
for her assistance, the may not be always a willing
help-mate. Submit she must when resolutely sum∣moned,
to the lawful and resistless power of reason,
and obeys her superior with a good grace; but she
must be sought with assiduity, and soothed with
kindness, by such as would obtain her most enchant∣ing
smiles. Long practice produces sacility, and
some poets have written well who have written for
bread; but haste is commonly inconsistent with cor∣rectness,
and praise may easily be over looked by
him whose chief pursuit is prosit. By exercise and
by rest, by leisure and by employment, from every
object, in every pursuit, the poet and the painter sup∣ply
themselves with materials; extracting sweets alike
from the flowers of the parterre and from the wild
and simple plants of the field and forest. Such seem
to have been the sentiments of Mr. Smart; who has
been frequently known to rise suddenly from his bed,
that he might six by writing those delightful ideas
which floated before his fancy in the visions of the
night.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am happy in con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irming these sentiments by the opinion at one period of Dr. Johnson himself. “It does not always happen that the success of a poet is proportionate to his labour.—The same observation may be extended to all works of imagination, which are often influenced by causes wholly out of the performer's power, by hints of which he perceives not the origin, by sudden elevations of mind which he cannot produce in himself, and which sometimes rise when he expects them least.”</P>
<P>Remarks on Mr. Pope's Epitaphs.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="18"/>
In 1753 he quitted College, on his marriage with
Miss Anna Maria Carnan, the daughter by a former
husband, of Mary, the wife of the late Mr. John
Newbery. He was introduced to this gentleman's
acquaintance by Dr. Burney, the celebrated and
learned author of the General History of Music, who
set for Mr. Smart several songs, and has enriched
the present collection with some original compositions.</P>
<P>As Mr. Smart had relinquished his Fellowship with∣out
engaging in any of the professions, he seems to
have trusted for his future maintenance to his powers
as an author.—But he had either over-rated his own
abilities and perseverance, or the favour of the pub∣lic.
—Though Mr. Newbery, to whom he was now
allied, was himself a man of genius and a liberal patron
of genius in others; yet the difficulties that had
perplexed Mr. Smart at Cambridge pursued him to
London; to which the expence of a family was super-added.
Yet such was his thoughtlessness, that he
has often, as his widow relates, invited company to
<PB N="xix" REF="19"/>
dinner, when no means appeared of providing a meal
for themselves. About this time he wrote for the <HI>Student,</HI> or <HI>Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany;</HI> a peri∣odical
work of considerable reputation, in which
many of the wits of both the Universities displayed
their talents. To the <HI>Old Woman's Magazine,</HI> pub∣lished
at the same period, Mr. Newbery and himself
were the chief, if not the only contributors. He
translated also the works of Horace into English
prose, a task which he has very ably executed; but
of that kind which never will be praised in propor∣tion
to the labour. By few and apposite terms
Smart has expressed the sentiments of Horace, in an
idiom not placed very near the Roman in the table of
grammatical affinities. Of an author not among the
least difficult, he is at once an accurate and an ele∣gant
translator; and though he engaged in the un∣dertaking
when a very young man, he shews the
humblest attention to the language of the original,
and an absolute command ever his own.</P>
<P>He enjoyed, while thus engaged in the metropolis, the
familiar acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, Dr. James, Dr.
Goldsmith, and Mr. Garrick; and indeed of most,
who were then celebrated for genius, or for learning.
of Mr. Garrick's extreme parsimony much has been
told, in an occupation, where oeconomy is not usually
ranked among the virtues. To this opinion may be
opposed the fact of his offering to Mr. Smart, when
<PB N="xx" REF="20"/>
under the pressure of severe distress, the profits of a
free benefit at Drury-Lane Theatre; an offer which
his friends did not permit him to refuse. Upon this
occasion Mr. Garrick introduced on the stage for
the first time the short Drama of the <HI>Guardian;</HI> and performed in it himself the principal character.</P>
<P>Among the noble friends of Mr. Smart may be
reckoned the present Lord Delavai, to whom he was
private tutor in College, and who snowed him upon
various occasions particular instances of regard. It
was at the request of this Nobleman that he wrote a
Prologue and Epilogue to the Tragedy of Othello,
acted at Drury-Lane Theatre by several persons of
quality; the parts of Othello and Iago being filled by
Sir Francis Delaval and his Lordship.</P>
<P>Though the fortune as well as constitution of Mr.
Smart required the utmost care, he was equally neg∣ligent
in the management of both, and his various
and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagi∣nation
uncommonly fervid, produced temporary alie∣nations
of mind; which at last were attended with
paroxysms so violent and continued as to render con∣finement
necessary. In this melancholy state, his fa∣mily,
for he had now two children, must have been
much embarrassed in their circumstances, but for the
kind friendship and assistance of Mr. Newbery. Many
other of Mr. Smart's acquaintance were likewise for∣ward
in their sevices; and particulartly Dr. Samuel
<PB N="xxi" REF="21"/>
Johnson, who, on the firsr approaches of Mr. Smart's
malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publi∣cation
in which that gentleman was concerned, to
secure his claim to a share in the profits of it. Mrs.
Smart also received from Dr. Johnson several letters.
One of these, addressed to her at Dublin, is still pre∣served;
and as every effusion from that celebrated
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n is now become interesting, it is here presemed to
the reader.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Madam,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“To enumerate the causes that have hindered me
from answering your letter would be of no use; be
assured that disrespect had no part in the delay. I
have been always glad to he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of you, and have not
neglected to enquire after you. I am not surprised to
hear that you are not much delighted with Ireland.
To one that has passd so many years in the pleasures
and opulence of London, there are few places that
can give much delight; but we can never unite all
conveniences in any sphere; and must only consider
which has the most good in the whole, or more pro∣perly
which has the least evil. You have gone at the
worst time; the splendor of Dublin is only to be seen
in a parliament winter; and even then matters will
be but little mended. I think, Madam, you may
look upon your expedition as a proper preparative to
the voyage which we have often talked of. Dublin,
though a place much worss than London, is: not so
<PB N="xxii" REF="22"/>
bad as Iceland. You will now be hardened to all
from the sight of poverty, and will be qualified to
lead us forward, when we shrink at rueful spectacles
of smoaky cottages and ragged inhabitants. One
advantage is always to be gained from the sight of
poor countries; we learn lo know the comforts of our
own. I wish, however, it was in my power to make
Ireland please you better; and whatever is in my
power you may always command. I shall be glad to
hear from you the history of your management; whe∣ther
you have a house or a shop, and what compa∣nons
you have found; let me know every good and
every evil that besalls you. I must insist that you
don't use me as I have used you, for we must not
copy the faults of our friends: for my part I intend
to mend mine, and for the future to tell you more
frequently that I am, etc.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After an interval of little more than two years,
Mr. Smart appeared to be pretty well restored, and
was accordingly set at liberty; but his mind had re∣ceived
a shook from which it never entirely recover∣ed.
He took a pleasant lodging in the neighbour∣hood
of the Park; conducting his affairs for some
time with sufficient prudence. He was maintained
partly by his literary occupations, and partly by the
generosity of his friends; receiving among other be∣nefactions
fifty pounds a year from the Treasury; but
<PB N="xxiii" REF="23"/>
by whose interest, as I do not certainly know, I will
not hazard a conjecture. Of the state of his mind,
and of his modes of life at this period some idea may
be formed by the following letter from Dr. Hawkes∣worth
to Mrs. Hunter, one of his sisters.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Dear Madam,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I am afraid that you have before now secretly
accused me, and I confess that appearances are against
me; I did not however delay to call upon Mr.
Smart, but I was unfortunate enough twice to miss him.
I was the third day of my being in town seized with a
fever that was then epidemic, from which I am but
just recovered. I have since my being in town this
second time called on my old friend, and seen him.
He received me with an ardour of kindness natural
to the sensibility of his temper, and we were soon
seated together by his fire side: I perceived upon his
table a quarto book, in which he had been writing, a
prayer book and a Horace: after the first compli∣ments,
I said I had been at Margate, had seen his
mother and his sister, who expressed great kindness
for him, and made me promise to come and see him;
to this he made no reply; nor did he make any en∣quiry
after those I mentioned; he did not even men∣tion
the place, nor ask me any questions about it, or
what carried me thither. After some pause, and some
indifferent chat, I returned to the subject, and said
that Mr. Hunter and you would be very glad to see
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24"/>
him in Kent: to this he replied very quick, “I can∣not
afford to be idle;” I said he might employ his
mind as well in the country as in town, at which he
only shook his head; and I intirely changed the subject.
Upon my asking him when we should see the Psalms,
he said they were going to press immediately: as to
his other undertakings, I found he had compleated
a transiation of Phoedrus in verse for Dodsley at a
certain price, and that he is now busy in translating
all Horace into verse, which he sometimes thinks of
publishing; on his own account, and sometimes of con∣trasting
for it with 2 bookseller; I advised him to
the latter, and he then told me he was in treaty about
it, and believed it would be a bargain: he told me
his principal motive for translating Horace into verse,
was to supersede the prose translation which he did
for Newbery, which he said would hurt his memory.
He intends however to review that translation, and
print it at the foot of the page in his poetical version,
which he proposes to print in quarto with the Latin,
both in verse and prose, on the opposite page; he
told me he once had thoughts of printing it by subscrip∣tion,
but as he had troubled his friends already, he
was unwilling to do it again, and had been persuaded
to publish it in numbers, which, though I rather dis∣suaded
him, seemed at last to be the prevailing bent
of his mind: he read me some of it: it is very close,
and his own poetical fire sparkles in it very fre∣quently;
<PB N="xxv" REF="25"/>
yet, upon the whole, it will scarcely take
place of Francis's, and therefore, if it is not adopted'
as a school book, which perhaps may be the case,
it will turn to little account. Upon mentioning his
prose translation, I saw his countenance kindle, and
matching up the book, “what, says he, do you think
I had for this?” I said I could not tell, “why,
says he, with great indignation, thirteen pounds.” I
expressed very great astonishment, which he seemed
to think he should increase by adding, “but, Sir, I
gave a receipt for a hundred”; my astonishment
however was now over, and I found that he received
only thirteen pounds because the rest had been ad∣vanced
for his family; this was a tender point, and I
found means, immediately to divert him from it.</P>
<P>He is with very decent people, in a house most de∣lighlfully
situated with a terras that overlooks. St.
James's Park, and a door into it. He was going to dine
with an old friend of my own, Mr. Richard Dalton,
who has an appointment in the King's library, and if
I had not been particularly engaged, I would have
dined with him. He had lately received a very gen∣teel
letter from Dr. Lowth, and is by no means con∣sidered
in any light that makes his company as a
gentleman, a scholar, and a genius less desirable. I
have been very particular, dear Madam, in relating
all the particulars of this conference, that you may
<PB N="xxvi" REF="26"/>
draw any inference, that I could draw from it, your∣self.</P>
<P>“I should incur my own censure, which is less
tolerable than all others; if I did not express my
sense of the civilities I received from you and Mr.
Hunter, while I was at Margate: I have Mrs.
Hawkesworth's express request in a letter now before
me to do the same on her part: if you, or any of the
family come into our part of the country, we shall be
very glad to accommodate you with a table and a
bed; you will and a chearful fire side and a hearty
welcome. If in the mean time I can do you any
service or pleasura here, you will the more oblige as
you the more freely command me.</P>
<P>“Our best compliments a tend you, Mr. Hunter,
your young gentleman, and Mrs. Smart, not forget∣ting
the ladies we met at your house, particularly one
who I think is daughter to Mrs. Holmes.</P>

<P>In the course of a few years Mr. Smart's oeconomy
forsook. him, and he was confined for debt in the
King's Bench Prison, the rules of which he afterwards
<PB N="xxvii" REF="27"/>
obtained by the kindness of his brother-in-law, Mr.
Thomas Carnan. He died after a short illness the
18th of May, 1770, of a disorder in his liver, leaving
behind him two daughters, who with his widow are
settled at Reading in Berkshire, and by their prudent
management of a business, transferred to them by
the late Mr. John Newbery,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of these pages gives his testimony with pecu∣liar pleasure to the merits of a gentleman whose friendship and civilities he experienced in early life; and whose benefi∣cence indeed to say nothing of his intellectual powers, suf∣fered no object within the sphere of its exertions, to be un∣cheared by his kindness. The following epitaph, drawn up some years ago, but not published, will be a further evidence of the Author's opinion of Mr. Newbery's character. It is sup∣posed to be written at the place where he was born and buried.</P>
<L>Stay, Passenger, and contemplate</L>

<L>Urbanity that adorned Society;</L>

<L>is sunk in dust!</L>
<L>Rejoice,—</L>
<L>That, through Christ,</L>
<L>it is immortal!</L></NOTE> are in good cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>His character, compounded like that of all human
beings, of good qualities and of defects, may easily
be collected from this account of his life. A few of
his peculiarities remain to be mentioned.</P>
<P>Though he was a very diligent student while at
Cambridge, he was also extremely fond of exrciese,
and of walking in particular; at which times it was
his custom to pursae his meditations. A fullow seu∣dent
remembers a path worn by his constant treading
on the pavement under the Cloisters of his College.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="28"/>
His piety was exemplary and fervent; it may not be
uninteresting to the reader to be told, that Mr. Smart,
in composing the religious poems, was frequently so
impressed with the sentiment of devotion, as to write
particular passages on his knees.</P>
<P>He was friendly, affectionate, and liberal to excess;
so as often to give that to others, of which he was in
the utmost want himself; he was also particularly en∣gaging
in conversation, when his first shyness was worn
away; which he had in common with literary men,
but in a very remarkable degree. Having under∣taken</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="29"/>
to introduce his wife to my Lord Darlington,
with whom he was well acquainted; he had no sooner
mentioned her name to his Lordship, than he retreated
suddenly, as if stricken with a panic, from the room,
and from the house, leaving her to follow overwhelmed
with confusion.</P>
<P>As an instance of the wit of his conversation, the
following extemporary spondiac, descriptive of the
three Bedels of the University, who were at that time
all very fat men, is still remembered by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is acade∣mical
acquaintance.</P>
<P>Pinguia tergeminorum abdomina Bedellorum.</P>
<P>This line he afterwards inserted in one of his
poems for the Tripos.</P>
<P>During the far greater part of his life he was
wholly inattentive to oeconomy; and by this negli∣gence
lost first his fortune and then his credit.
The civilities shewn him by persons greatly his su∣periors
in rank and character, either induced him
to expect mines of wealth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Modo non montes auri. TER.</NOTE> from the exertion of
his talents; or encouraged him to think himself ex∣empted
from attention to common obligations. The
engagement into which he entered with Gardner
the bookseller, to furnish papers monthly in conjunc∣tion
with Mr. Rolt for the <HI>Universal Visitor,</HI> is a
memorable example of thoughtless imprudence. It
<PB N="xxx" REF="30"/>
was settled between the publisher and the poets, that
these last should divide between them one third of the
profits of the work, and they engaged themselves
moreover by a bond, not to write for ninety-nine
years to come in any other publication.</P>
<P>But his chief fault, from which most of his other
faults proceeded, was his deviations from the rules of
sobriety; of which the early use of cordials in the
infirm state of his childhood and his youth, might per∣haps
be one cause, and is the only extenuation.</P>
<P>Of the Odes of Smart it may be said in general,
that they are spirited and poetical; it will be difficult
to find any other quality equally applicable to com∣positions
very different from each other, and in many
of which opposite characters occasionally predominate.
The Poet has followed the example of Horace, ra∣ther
than that of the Grecian models, and of him he
is for the most part <HI>doctus imitator;</HI> but in one or two
of the serious poems he surprises the reader with pas∣sages
of a ludicrous cast, and debases by an impure
admixture, what otherwise would have been gold of
the standard value. The example of his model may
possibly be pleaded as authority for this confusion of
sentiments; but besides that the blemishes of the ori∣ginal
will be avoided by the judicious copyist, it may
fairly be questioned whether in any of the Odes
<PB N="xxx" REF="31"/>
of Horace which are confessedly grave, incontrover∣tible
instances can be shewn of low and colloquial
manners. In the page of the poet and the historian
familiar customs and domestic habits are rarely ex∣hibited
with distinctness: in order to be understood,
they must be seen; nor can we now with precision
ascertain the limits between the coarse and vulgar hu∣mour
of ancient Rome, and that which was accounted
elegant and liberal. At any rate let us not hastily
impute a deviation from the principles of universal
taste to so great a name as Horace.</P>
<P>I know not whether I shall be patiently permitted
to reckon <HI>perspicuity</HI> among the excellencies of the
Odes of Smart; as the <HI>obscure</HI> has prevailed with
more modern and very celebrated poets, sanctioned
as it should seem by the example of Pindar himself.
The lyre indeed of the immortal Theban may be
truly said to be <HI>vocal to the wise;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></P>
<P>PINDAR OLYMP. 2.</P></NOTE> but its strains were
also intelligible to inferior minds; for otherwise the
mixed multitudes, assembled at the Olympic and Isth∣mian
games from every quarter of Greece, would not
have distinguished them with applause. Obscurity,
or in other words a meaning so conveyed as not to
be comprehended without painful exertion, cannot re∣commend
any composition; if it be true that we
write, as well as speak, to be understood. The happy
<PB N="xxxii" REF="32"/>
few that can penetrate into mysteries, at which the un∣initiated
can only wonder, will exult in their own saga∣city;
but they may chance to forget their author in
their admiration of themselves. The meaning of Pin∣dar,
as well as of Simonides, does not indeed always
appear upon the surface; but the fragments of the latter
poet, scattered through the works of the Greek histo∣rians
and scholiasts, are too imperfect to make him a
pattern for imitation; and of Pindar many beauties,
once eminent and splendid, lie buried under the ruins of
time. Allusions delicate and remote to eminent per∣sons
and distingoished events, derive from their very
remoteness their interest and beauty; but this is not
obscurity; every cotemporary urderstands them, who
is capable of tasting poetry. What however was
beautiful, must quickly become unintelligible, without
any fault of its author, if the events to which it refers
be not recorded by the historians who have descended
to after ages.</P>
<P>Even trifles become interesting and important,
when related accidentally of important characters.
We are gratified in finding by an inscription in
Pausanias, that Hiero, the favourite hero of Pindar,
was crowned thrice, like Psaumis of Camerina, in
the Olympic games; honours which his poet seems
to presage in the conclusion of the Olympic Ode
inscribed to him; and Homer, the most intelligible
of poets, is not less engaging in his familiar nar∣ratives;
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="33"/>
when he tells us, that the Oilean Ajax was
shorter in stature than his brother, and that Ulysses
was less dignified in his manner than Menelaus, till
he began to speak.</P>
<P>As to the merit of particular Odes on our Author,
the first, addressed to <HI>Idleness,</HI> and the second, to <HI>Ethe∣linda,</HI>
which was <HI>written,</HI> when he was only thirteen,
possess, the one the elegance of Sappho, and the other,
the sprightliness of Anacreon; the Morning-Piece is
uniformly beautiful, and has long been admired for
its happy description of labour; the Ode on St. Ce∣cilia's
Day, inferior only to the great model by
Dryden, has none of the inequalities of his two pre∣decessors,
being uniformly dignified throughout; and
the Hymn to the Supreme Being, on his Recovery
from Sickness, is pious, animated, and pathetic.
The Ode on the fifth of December, being the Birth-Day
of a beautiful Young Lady, has been much ad∣mired.
It was written on Miss Harriot Pratt, of
Downham in Norfolk, a lady for whom our Author
had entertained a long and unsuccessful passion; who
was the subiect also of the Crambo Ballad, and other
verses inserted among these Poems. The Ode, of
which we are speaking is indeed highly poetical; its
chief blemish is the too frequent and affected use of
alliteration.</P>
<P>The five Poems on the Divine Attributes are
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="34"/>
written with the sublimest energies of religion, and
the true enthusiasm of poetry; and had the pen of their
author stopped with, these compositions, they alone
would have given him a very distinguished rank
among the writers of verse. They are also more ac∣curate
than the generality of his poems; which may
be attributed to the deference he might feel from
those persons, who were to adjudge the prizes which
he obtained. That Mr. Seaton's donation has pro∣duced
so few poems of genuine merit has been a sub∣ject
of surprise among those, who accustomed only
to cursory contemplations on the human mind, ima∣gine
that its operations may be generated by the
same methods, by which men produce improvements
in commerce, or effects in mechanics; that genius, to
appear, needs only to be invoked; and that in the
parsimony or kindness of patrons may be traced the
history of the rise and declension of the arts.</P>
<P>To the foundation of Seaton, however we are
indebted for the poems of a <HI>Smart,</HI> a <HI>Glynn,</HI> and-a
<HI>Porteus;</HI> and if other compositions have been unno∣ticed,
it has been <HI>less</HI> owing to their real inferiority,
than to the temper of mankind; who are too deeply
engaged with themselves, to bestow much time on the
exertions of others.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Hop Garden</HI> much commendation cannot
justly be conferred; and the praise, which is withheld
<PB N="xxxv" REF="35"/>
from the poetry, will not be very chearfully lavished
on the instructions. The Author seems to have ad∣dressed
himself to the task without previous informa∣tion
on the art of which he treats. Poets are seldom
acquainted with the detail of mechanical improve∣ments;
but Hops were the production of his native
country, and therefore Hops must be adorned by the
labours of the Muse. Hesiod, and the Poet of Man∣tua
had both probably turned up the glebe with their
own hands; but poetry was the only vehicle of in∣struction
in the age of the Ascrean; who taught in short
precepts, easily retained, like the Shepherd' of Ban∣bury,
what is commonly better learnt by experience
and observation. But the refined system of modern
bards soar far above the reach of those for whose use
we must suppose them intended; and we are well
contented that bread should be prepared, and a beve∣rage
extracted from the apple by men who seek not
wisdom in the <HI>Georgia</HI> of Virgil, nor in the <HI>Cyder</HI>
of Phillips.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hilliard</HI> contains many spirited lines; and
may afford entertainment to those who care little about
the hero of the poem, or the subject of the quarrel.
Compositions of this class, as they gratify malignity,
are usually read with great avidity on their first ap∣pearance;
but without uncommon merit they quickly
sink into oblivion. Even the <HI>Dunciad</HI> is read per∣haps
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="36"/>
with less delight than any other work of its cele∣brated
author; nor should we resort at all to the
<HI>Temple of Dulness</HI> to contemplate the characters of
Curll or Theobald, could we not also feast on the
dispute of the Virtuosos before the throne of the Goddess.</P>
<P>The <HI>Judgment of Midas</HI> is classical and elegant;
but Dramatic Pastorals, even if the generally interest∣ing
topic of love be superadded, will not greatly en∣tertain,
without their proper embellishments, acting
and music. The <HI>Comus</HI> of Milton, with all its ex∣cellance,
has been recommended entirely to general
reception by the aids of the stage; and the <HI>Amyntas</HI>
of Tasso, with the exq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isitely beautiful <HI>Pastor-Fido,</HI>
must be habited in that ancient and characteristic dres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
if they return again to the admiration of the public.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Fables</HI> and <HI>lighter Poems,</HI> the greater part
are either printed for the first time, or collected by
the kind diligence of friends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among these a name that should be mentioned is that of Mr. Isaac Reed, the extent of whose communications could be equalled only by the facility and kindness with which they were made.</NOTE> from books now scarcely
to be found; and from these, and the Fables in parti∣cular,
we can promise our readers considerable enter-tainment.
Fable is indeed a species of writing in-teresting
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="37"/>
to every rank of mankind, and to every age.
We love to be instructed while we are amused; and
exercise our critical sagacity in applying the Dramatis
Personae of the narrative to our acquaintance or our
selves, in exact proportion to our propensity for satire,
or our desire of moral information. Rousiean, from
a just opinion that the former inclination predomi∣nates,
in his famous Critique on the <HI>Fox and Crow</HI> of
La Fontaine, objects with his usual love of paradox
and his usual spirit, to this class of compositions;
but I believe he did not expect that his arguments
would prevail upon mothers to withhold from their
children the only writings that can induce them to
read. The fable in question has certainly no merit of
the moral kind; but it delights us as a just picture of
human life; it is a very ancient representation of Folly
duped by Flattery; and was revived as early as the
time of Apuleius, and introduced by him into a seri∣ous
work with all the graces of novelty, and the
energy of invention.</P>
<P>Of the merit of the Fables before us some estimate
may be made, by comparing the <HI>Pig</HI> of our Author
with the same story in Phaedius, of which it is a very
exact and beautiful translation. If in any instances
the modern is surpassed by the most charming fa∣bulist
of antiquity, for which perhaps the Roman is
not a little indebted to the superior force and concise∣ness.
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="38"/>
of the language in which he wrote, in others the
original is undoubtedly rivalled, if not excelled; and
obtains at last a doubtful victory. The Poet unites
in these little compositions, the grace and ease of
Prior with the humour of Swift; and to these is super∣added
a very considerable portion of poetical spirit; a
quality in which many compositions-of this nature
are deficient, that have had the fortune to obtain con∣siderable reputation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is particularly the case with respect to Gay's Fables, which are now almost wholly confined to the nursery and the school; seldom recollected as poems but when forced on the memory as a task; and scarcely more than a single fable can be cited, amongst so many favourite stories, that is re∣markable either for the beauty of its images, or the harmony of its numbers.</NOTE></P>
<P>I know not whether our Author, in his fable of <HI>the
Citizen and the Red Lion of Bren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford,</HI> has not trans∣gressed
the limits even of mythological probability.
On the productions of nature the fabulist has been
permitted to lavish the powers of speech; and religi∣ous sentiment among the ancients has co-operated
with him; for every oak had its dryad or hama∣dryad;
every stream and mountain its tutelary divi∣nity,
and bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts spoke, if we will trust to Livy, long
after the days of <HI>Aesop.</HI> But the works of art only
began to shew themselves, as the dominion of super∣stition
and ignorance disappeared; and we cannot
<PB N="xxxix" REF="39"/>
help applying the <HI>incredulus odi</HI> of the poet to events
of which we have heard of no example.</P>
<P>Still however, the handmaid of nature may be
permitted to use some of the privileges of her mistress,
if the uses them with caution and reserve: we can lis∣ten
with patience, perhaps with pleasure, to the con∣versation
of <HI>the Bag-H'ig and the Tobacco-Pipe,</HI> if
the poet gives spcech to his imaginary characters,
and speech alone. Bat when art assumes the person
of nature; when the lion of the painter roars, and
shakes his mane, and reasons like his archetype in the
forest; when imitation exercises functions, which it is
an indulgence to suppose even in the original, the
mind rejects the fiction as improbable, and revolts
against it as absurd.</P>
<P>But after all it may favour too much of the rigour of
criticism, to attempt to restrain by the stricter rules of
art poems of whose essence it is to be anomalous and
excentric; taste and feeling must at last decide the
question; and the irregularity of the fable, intro∣ducing
a dialogue between a man and a painted board,
may be forgiven for its humour.</P>
<P>Of the Latin Translations, the first in order as in
merit is that of <HI>Mr. Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's
Day;</HI> and in reading the letter from him to our Au∣thor,
where he speaks of this performance, one cannot
help being offended at the parsimony of his praise.</P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="40"/>
The kindest apology that can be made for him is
that he had little relish for Latin poetry. Self-inte∣rest
however might have prompted him to more
liberal commendation of a translator, who had enabled
his author to appear in the different countries of
Europe in attire at once elegant and appropriate. He
equals his original in the sublimest passages, if we ex∣cept
only that one so much admired by Dr. Johnson;
and to the ballad and epigrammatic stanzas gives dig∣nity
and grace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the Review of Dr. Warton's Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope, who is said to be Dr. Johnson, observes on the first of the stanzas alluded to, that though “the two passions of merriment and exultation are undoubtedly different; as different as a gambol and a triumph, yet each is a species of joy; and poetical measures have not in any language been so far refined, as to provide for the subdivi∣sions of passion.” This is true; but it is also true, that there is a want of taste in applying any metre to subjects of dignity, which has been dabased by ludicrous and burlesque associations.</NOTE> The vulgar lines, which describe
the power of Styx over the inthralled Euridice, and
the suuerior power of music and of love, are translated
with truth and beauty. In these inelegant deviations
from the majesty of the ode, the example of Dryden
occurred probably to his admirer; but they are faults
<PB N="xli" REF="41"/>
which no example can justify. It has been objected,
and with some reason, to Smart's celebrated transla∣tion,
that it exhibits a variety of metres, unauthorized
by any single example amongst the Latin poets. But
had our author, too timid to pursue the rapid flights
and wild genius of his original, confined himself to
the regular recurrence of the Roman stanza, his imi∣tation
would not have been exact, and probably would
not have been interesting. Admiration is in works
of taste one source of our delight; and admiration is
felt in a considerable degree, when we find the poeti∣cal
measures of a dead, and of a living language ca∣pable
of so close a likeness. When two excellencies
cannot be united in the same effort of genius, to
choose between them is the province of discretion;
and the opinion of the public in the present instance
has fully justified the choice of Smart.</P>
<P>The Translation of Milton's <HI>L'Allegro,</HI> (the idea of
which our Author might have more happily expressed
in Greek than by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) will probably be less
admired, as it his been done since with greater suc∣cess
by a classical Prelate: but I am not sure that this
work is in the possession of the public.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tripos-Poems,</HI> though written as college exer∣cises
at an early age, are not wholly unworthy of this
collection; they show considerable knowledge of the
Latin Tongue, at a time when the generality of stu∣dents
<PB N="xlii" REF="42"/>
are familiar only with its elements;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Latin Translation of the Ballad, <HI>When Fanny Blooming Fair,</HI> was written at the age of sixteen; and the Latin verses on <HI>Atrae</HI> at fourteen.</NOTE> they are
the work of a mind, attentive both to the substantial
parts and to the decorations of poetry.</P>
<P>To the labours of Smart on the <HI>Essay of Criticism</HI>
those persons chiefly are indebted, who being un∣acquainted
with the English tongue, wish to see Mr.
Pope's just rules of taste, embellished indeed with his
powers of poetry, though appearing with less gloss
and lustre through the medium of translation. Smart
is a very diligent imitator of the epistolary style of
Horace; and we shall find him carefully following
the footsteps of his master, where we might ofherwise
have been disposed to suspect the purity of his lan∣guage.
In the famous lines intended as an echo to
the sense, he has laboured through a very painful task
with considerable dexterity; and in the beautiful pic∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re
of the Reign of Leo, of Vida, and of the Arts,
on foreigner need regret that he is unacquainted with
Pope.</P>
<P>On the whole, if we consider that every species of
Poetry, not even excepting the Epic, has been at∣tempted
by our Author, and most of them with emi∣nent
success, we shall be inclined to admit that the
present collection is not excelled by many in the En∣glish
<PB N="xiii" REF="43"/>
language; that the gay may extract amusement
from it, and the grave instruction; or as all men par∣take
at different seasons of both these humours, that no
moments of leisure can occur to the admirer of poetry,
in which he will not be able in these volumes to gra∣tify
his tafte.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the works contained in this edition, our Author wrote a Poem called <HI>a Song to David,</HI> and a <HI>new Version of the Psalms:</HI> he also translated the Works of Horace, and the Fabies of Phaedrus into English Metre; and versified our Saviour's Parables. These, with two small pamphlets of Poems, were written after his confinement, and bear for the most part melancholy proofs of the recent estrangement of his mind. Such poems however have been selected from his pamphlets, and inserted in the present work, as were likely to be acceptable to the Reader.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following piece has been told,
that the writing an Ode on S. Cecilia's Day, after Mr.
Dryden and Mr. Pope, would be great presumption,
which is the reason he detains the reader in this place
to make an apology, much against his will, he having
all due contempt for the impertinence of Prefaces.
In the first place then, it will be a little hard (he
thinks) if he should be particularly mark'd out for
censure, many others having written on the same sub∣ject
without any such imputations; but they (it may be)
did not live long enough to be laughed at, or, by some
lucky means or other, escaped those shrewd remarks,
which, it seems, are reserved for him. In the second
place, this subject was not his choice, but imposed upon
him by a gentleman very eminent in the science of
Musick, for whom he has a great friendship, and who
is, by his good sense and humanity, as much elevated
above the generality of mankind, as by his exquisite
art he is above most of his profession. The request
of a friend, undoubtedly, will be sneer'd at by some
as a stale and antiquated apology: it is a very good
<PB REF="80"/>
one notwithstanding, which is manifest even from it's
triteness; for it can never be imagined, that so many
excellent Authors, as well as bad ones, would have
made use of it, had they not been convinced of it's
cogency. As for the writer of this piece, he will re∣joice
in being derided, not only for obliging his
friends, but any honest man whatsoever, so far as may
be in the power of a person of his mean abilities. He
does not pretend to equal the very worst parts of the
two celebrated performances already extant on the sub∣ject;
which acknowledgment alone will, with the
good-natured and judicious, acquit him of presump∣tion;
because thess pieces, however excellent upon the
whole, are not without their blemishes. There is in
them both an exact unity of design, which though in
compositions of another nature a beauty, is an impro∣priety
in the Pindaric, which should consist in the ve∣hemence
of sudden and unlook'd for transitions: hence
chiefly it derives that enthusiastic fire and wildness,
which greatly distinguish it from other species of Poesy.

have been to no purpose, I think myself bound by all the
ties of gratitude, to render my next acknowledgments
to you, who, under God, restored me to health from
as violent and dangerous a disorder, as perhaps ever
man survived. And my thanks become more parti∣cularly
your just tribute, since this was the third time,
that your judgment and medicines rescued me from
the grave, permit me to say, in a manner almost mi∣raculous.</P>
<P>If it be meritorious to have investigated medicines
for the cure of distempers, either overlooked or disre∣garded

will celebrate the man, who wrote the <HI>Medicinal Dic∣tionary,</HI>

against the impotent attacks of those whose in∣terest

displease you to have those for your particular enemies,
who are foes to the Public in general.</P>
<P>It is no wonder, indeed, that some of the retailers.
of medicines should zealously oppose whatever might
endanger their Trade, but 'tis amazing that there
should be any Physicians mercenary and mean enough
to pay their court <HI>to,</HI> and ingratiate themselves <HI>with,</HI>
such persons, by the strongest efforts to prejudice the
inventor of the Fever Powder at the expence of ho∣nour,
dignity, and conscience. Believe me, however,
and let this be a part of your consolation, that there
are very few Physicians in <HI>Britain,</HI> who were born
gentlemen, and whose fortunes place them above such
sordid dependencies, who do not think and speak of
you, as I do.</P>

<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO A
FRIEND at the University of CAMBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear *****,</OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge several letters, which I
lately received from you, without any return on my
part. As I have been very much hurried of late with
a multiplicity of affairs, I must beg you will not only
be kind enough to overkook my past omission, but to
indulge me for a little time longer. As soon as I am
master of sufficient leisure, I will give you my senti∣ments
without reserve, concerning the affair, about
which you have thought proper to consult me; for the
present I desire you will consider this as a receipt for
your many favours, or a promissory note to discharge
my debt of friendship as soon as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="186"/>
The design and colouring of a poem, such as you
have planned, are not to be executed in a hurry, but
with slow and careful touches, which will give that
finishing to your piece, remarkable in every thing
that comes from your hand, and which I could wish
the precipitancy of my temper would permit me to
aim at upon all occasions. I long to see you take a
new flight to the regions of fame, not upon unequal
wings, that sometimes rise to a degree of elevation,
and then fall again, but with an uniform tenour, like
the bird in VIRGIL,
<Q>“Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.”</Q></P>
<P>I have been now for about three weeks in this scene
of smoke and dust, and I think the republic of letters
seems to be lamentably upon the decline in this me∣tropolis.
Attornies clerks, and raw unexperienced
boys, are the chief critics we have at present. With
a supercilious look and peremptory voice, which
they have caught from a few of their oracles, as dark
and ignorant as themselves, these striplings take upon
them to decide upon fable, character, language and
sentiment.</P>
<Q><L>“Nescis, heu nescis dominae fastidia Romae;</L>
<L>Crede mil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, nimium Martia turba sapit.”</L></Q>
<P>With regard to writers, the town swarms with them,
and the aim of them all is pretty much the same, viz.
<PB N="159" REF="187"/>
to elevate and surprize, as Mr. Bays says. At the head
of these still continues the INSPECTOR. As we fre∣quently
laughed together concerning this writer, when
you were last in town, I need not here give you a de∣scription
of his parts and genius. I remember you
express'd great amazement at the reception his essays
seemed to meet with in all our coffee-houses; but you
must consider that there are artifices to gain success,
as well as merit to deserve it. The former of these
his INSPECTORSHIP is eminently possessed of, and
sooner than fail, he will not hesitate, in order to make
himself talked of at any rate, to become most glaringly
ridiculous. This answers the purpose of the book∣sellers,
as well perhaps as Attick wit, and hence it re∣sults
that they are willing to continue him in their pay.</P>
<P>In the packet, which I have sent to you by the
stage coach, you will find a paper called the IMPER∣TINENT,
written by himself. In this curious piece he
has not stopped at abusing his own dear person, which
is the only subject he has not handled with his usual
malice, and the rest of it is made a vehicle for invec∣tive
against Mr. Fielding and me. It was ushered
into the world in a pompous manner, as if intended to
be continued, but no second number was ever pub∣lished,
and to shew you a further instance of his fallacy,
he thence took occasion to triumph over a pretender
<PB N="160" REF="188"/>
to essay-writing, which he would fain insinuate, can∣not
be executed by any one but himself.</P>
<P>This unfair dealing, so unworthy a man, who as∣pires
to be a member of the serene republic of letters,
induced me to wave for a time the design you know
I was engaged in, in order to bestow a few lines upon
this scribbler, who in my eyes is a disgrace to literature.
In the first heat of my poetic fury, I formed the idea
of another DUNCIAD, which I intended to call after
the mime of my hero, THE HILLIAD. The first
book of it you will receive, among other things, by
the coach, and I shall be glad to be favoured with
your opinion of it.</P>
<P>If it conduces to your entertainment, I shall have
gained my end; for though I have received such pro∣vocation
from this man, I believe I shall never carry
it any further. I really find some involuntary sensa∣tions
of compassion for him, and I cannot help think∣ing,
that, if he could keep within the bounds of de∣cency
and good manners, he would be a rare instance
of what may be done by a fluency of periods, without
genius, sense, or meaning. Though I am persuaded
he is quite incorrigible, I am still reluctant to publish
that piece, for I would rather be commended to pos∣terity
by the elegant and amiable muses, than by the
satyric sister, politely called by an eminent author,
<HI>the least engaging of the Nine.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="189"/>
On this account I shall proceed no further 'till you
have favoured me with your opinion, by which I will
absolutely determine myself. I hope therefore you
will peruse it as soon as you can with convenience,
and return it to me by the stage. You may shew it
to Jack ******, and to Mr. ****.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, with great sincerity,
Dear *****,
Your most obedient humble servant,

</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<OPENER>DEAR SMART,</OPENER>
<P>THE perusal of your poem has given me so much
pleasure, that I cannot postpone thanking you for it,
by the first opportunity that has offered. I have read
it to the persons you desired I should, and they ap∣prove
the design in the highest manner. I cannot
conceive what should make you hesitate a moment
about the publication, and to be free with you, you
<PB N="162" REF="190"/>
must not by any means suppress it. When I say this,
I must observe, that I should be glad to see you bet∣ter
employed, than in the dissection of an insect; but
since the work should be done by some body, and
since you have made such a progress, I must take
the liberty to insist, that you will not drop this un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>To speak in plain terms; I look upon it to be in∣dispensably
incumbent on you to bring the miscreant
to poetic justice; it is what you owe to the cause of
learning in general, to your Alma Mater, this Uni∣versity,
and, let me add, it is what you owe to your∣self.
The world will absolve you from any imputa∣tion
of ill-nature, when it is considered that the pen
is drawn in defence of your own character. Give me
leave upon this occasion▪ to quote a passage from the
SPECTATOR, which I think pertinent to the present
subject. “Every honest man ought to look upon
himself as in a natural state of war with the libeller
and lampooner, and to annoy them, wherever
they fall in his way. This is but retaliating upon
them, and treating them as they treat others.”</P>
<P>Thus thought the polite Mr. Addison in a case
where he was not immediately concerned; and can
you doubt what to do, when personally attacked? As
soon as the hissing of the snake is heard, some means
<PB N="163" REF="191"/>
should be devised to crush him. The advice of VIR∣GIL
is,—“Cape saxa manu, cape robora pastor.”</P>
<P>I can tell you that your friends here expect this of
you, and we are all unanimous in thinking, that a
man who has the honour of belonging to this learned
University, and to whom the prize, for displaying
with a masterly hand the attributes of his Maker, has
been adjudged for three years successively, should not,
on any account, suffer himself to be trifled with,
by so frigid and empty a writer. I would have
you reflect that you launched into the world with
many circumstances, that raised a general expectation
of you, and the early approbation of such a genius as
Mr. POPE, for your elegant version of his ode, made
you considered as one, who might hereafter make a
figure in the literary world; and let me recommend
to you, not to let the laurel, yet green upon your
brow, be torn off by the prophane hands of an unhal∣lowed
hireling. This, I think, as is observed already,
you owe to yourself, and to that University which has
distinguished you with honour.</P>
<P>Besides the motives of retaliation, which I have
urged for the publication of your poem, I cannot help
considering this matter in a moral light, and I must
avow, that in my eyes it appears an action of very
great merit. If to pull off the mask from an im∣postor,
<PB N="164" REF="192"/>
and detect him in his native colours to the
view of a long-deluded public, may be looked upon
as a service to mankind (as it certainly is) a better
opportunity never can offer itself.</P>
<P>In my opinion the cause of literature is in imminent
danger of a total degeneracy, should this writer's
diurnal productions meet with further encouragement.
Without straining hard for it, I can perceive a cor∣ruption
of taste diffusing itself, throughout the cities
of London and Westminster. For a clear vein of
thinking, easy natural expression, and an intelligible
stile, this pretender has substituted brisk question and
answer, pert, unmeaning periods, ungrammatical con∣struction,
unnatural metaphors, with a profusion of
epithets, inconsistent for the most part with the real
or figurative meaning of his words, and in snort, all
the masculine beauties of stile, are likely to be ba∣nished
from among us by the continuation of his pa∣pers
for almost two years together.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I submit it to you, whether this may
not lead on to a total depravity of sense and taste.
Should the more sober at our coffee-houses be daz∣zzled
with false embellishments; should boys ad∣mire
this unnatural flourishing, I do not in the least
question, but the rising generation will be totally in∣fected
with this strange motley stile, and thus anti∣thesis
<PB N="165" REF="193"/>
and point will be the prevailing turn of the
nation.</P>
<P>It is to prevent a contagion of this sort, that HO∣RACE
took the pen in hand; for this Quintilian fa∣voured
the world with his excellent work. The in∣genious
authors of France have always attended to
this point. Truth, they insisted, is the very founda∣tion
of fine writing, and that no thought can be
beautiful, which is not just, was their constant lesson.
To enforce this and preserve a manly way of think∣ing
BOILEAU lashed the scribblers of his time, and
in our own country the Spectators, Tatlers, and Guar∣dians
have laboured for this end. To this we owe
the Bathos, in which we find exposed, with the most
delicate traits of satire, all false figures in writing;
and finally to this we owe the Dunciad of Mr. POPE.</P>
<P>These instances, dear Smart, are sufficient to justify
your proceeding, and let me tell you, that a cultiva∣tion
of taste is a point of more moment than perhaps
may appear at first sight. In the course of my read∣ing
I have observed that a corruption in morals has
always attended a decline of letters. Of this Mr.
POPE seems to be sensible, and, hence we find in the
conclusion of his Dunciad, the general progress of
dulness over the land is the final coup de grace to
every thing decent, every thing laudable, elegant
and polite.</P>
<Q><PB N="166" REF="194"/>
<L>Religion blushing veils her sacred fire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L>And unawares morality expires.</L>
<L>Nor public fame, nor private dares to shine,</L>
<L>Nor human spark is left, nor glympse divine.</L>
<L>Lo! thy dread empire, CHAOS! is restor'd.</L>
<L>Light dies before thy uncreating word.</L>
<L>Thy hand great ANARCH lets the curtain fall,</L>
<L>And universal darkness buries all.</L></Q>
<P>I am aware that you may answer to what has been
promised, that the man is not of consequence enough
for all this, and you may observe to me, that at first
sitting out, I myself called him by the figurative and
typical appellation of an iusect. But if an infect gets
into the sunshine, and there blazes, shines and buzzes
to the annoyance of those, who may be basking in the
beams, it is time for the muses wing to brush the
thing away. In plain English, the rapidity, with
which this writer went on in his progress, was so
astonishing, that I really looked upon him to be re∣served
for the great instrument of dullness in the com∣pletion
of her work, which certainly must be accom∣plished,
unless a speedy stop be put to that inundation
of nonsense and immorality with which he has over∣whelmed
the nation.</P>
<P>I have mentioned immorality, nor will I retract the
word. Has he not attacked, maliciously attacked the
reputations of many gentlemen, to whom the world
has been greatly obliged?—He did not brandish his
<PB N="167" REF="195"/>
goose-quill for any length of time, before he dis∣charged
a torrent of abuse upon the reverend Mr.
Francis, whose amiable character, and valuable trans∣lation
of HORACE, have endeared him both to those,
who are, and those who are not acquainted with him.
Even beauty and innocence were no safe-guards against
his calumny, and the soft-eyed virgin was by him
cruelly obliged to shed the tender tear.</P>
<P>Upon the commencement of the Covent-Garden
Journal, Mr. Fielding declared an humorous war
against this writer, which was intended to be carried
with an amicable pleasantry, in order to contribute to
the entertainment of the town. It is recent in every
bodies memory, how the INSPECTOR behaved upon that
occasion. Conscious that there was not an atom of
humour in his composition, he had recourse to his usual
shifts, and instantly disclosed a private conversation;
by which he reduced himself to the alternative men∣tioned
by Mr. POPE; “and if he lies not, must at
least betray.” Through all Mr. Fielding's ini∣mitable
comic Romances, we perceive no such thing
as personal malice, no private character dragged into
light; but every stroke is copied from the volume
which nature has unfolded to him; every scene of life
is by him represented in its natural colours, and every
species of folly or humour is ridiculed with the most
exquisite touches. A genius like this is perhaps more
<PB N="168" REF="196"/>
useful to mankind, than any class of writers; he serves
to dispel all gloom from our minds, to work off our
ill-humours by the gay sensations excited by a well
directed pleasantry, and in a vein of mirth he leads
his readers into the knowledge of human nature; the
most useful and pleasing science we can apply to. And
yet so deserving an author has been most, grossly treat∣ed
by this wild Essayist, and, not to multiply instances,
has he not attempted to raise tumults and divisions in
our theatres, contrary to all decency and common
sense, and contrary to the practice of all polite writers,
whose chief aim has ever been to cherish harmony
and good manners, and to diffuse through all ranks
of people a just refinement of taste in all our public
entertainments?</P>
<P>These considerations, dear Sir, prompt you to the
blow, and will justify it when given. I believe, I
may venture to add, never had poet so inviting a sub∣ject
for satire; POPE himself had not so good an hero
for his DUNCIAD. The first Worthy who sat in that
throne, viz. Lewis Theobald of dull memory, em∣ployed
himself in matters of some utility, and, upon
being dethroned, the person, who succeeded, was one,
who formerly had some scattered rays of light; and
in most of his comedies, though whimsical and extra∣vagant,
there are many strokes of drollery; not to
mention that the Careless Husband is a finished piece.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="197"/>
But in the Hero of the Hilliad all the requisites
seem to be united, without one single exception. You
remember, no doubt, that in the dissertation prefixed
to the Dunciad the efficient qualities of an hero for
the little epic are mentioned to be vanity, impudence
and debauchery. These accomplishments, I appre∣hend,
are glaring in the person you have fixed upon.
As a single and notable instance of the two first, has
he not upon all occasions joined himself to some cele∣brated
name, such as the Right Honourable the Earl
of Orrery, or some other such exalted character? I
have frequently diverted myself by comparing this
proceeding to the cruelty of a tyrant, who used to tie
a living person to a dead carcass; and as to your hero's
debauchery, there are, I am told, many pleasant in∣stances
of it.</P>
<P>Add to these several subordinate qualifications;
such as foppery, a surprizing alacrity to get into
scrapes, with a notable facility of extricating himself,
an amazing turn for politicks, a wonderful knowledge
of herbs, minerals and plants, and to crown all, a
comfortable share of gentle dulness. This gentle
dulness is not that impenetrable stupidity, which is
remarkable in some men, but it is known by that
countenance, which Dr. Garth calls, “demurely
meek, insipidly serene.” It is known by a brisk vo∣lubility
of speech, a lively manner of saying nothing
<PB N="170" REF="198"/>
through an entire paper, and upon all occasions by a
conscious simper, short insertions of witty remarks,
the frequent exclamation of wonder, the self-applaud∣ing
chit-chat, and the pleasant repartee.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, dear Smart, I cannot conceive
what doubt can remain in your mind about the pub∣lication;
it is conferring on him that ridicule, which
his life, character, and actions deserve. I shall be in
town in less than a fortnight, when I shall bring your
poem with me, and if you will give me leave, I will
help you to some notes, which I think will illustrate
many passages.</P>

</LG>
<P><NOTE TYPE="foot"><P><HI>Thou God of jest.</HI> As the design of heroic poetry is to celebrate the virtues and noble achievements of truly great personages, and conduct them through a series of hardships to the comple∣tion of their wishes, so the little epic delights in represent∣ing, with an ironical drollery, the mock qualities of those, who, for the benefit of the laughing part of mankind, are pleased to become egregiously ridiculous, in an affected imitation of the truly renown'd worthies above-mentioned. Hence ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poet calls upon Momus, at the first opening of his poem, to convert his hero into a jest. So that in the presect case, it can∣not be said, <HI>facit indignatio versum,</HI> but, iv I may be allowed the expression, <HI>facit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ilatio versum;</HI> which may serve to shew our author's temper of mind is free from rancour, or ill-nature. Notwith standing the great incentives he has had to prompt him to this undertaking, he is not actuated by the spirit of re∣venge; and to check the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allies of fancy and humourous inven∣tion, he further invokes the goddess Themis, to administer strict, poetic justice.</P>
<P><HI>Shakes the pole.</HI>] Several cavils have been raised against this passage. QUINRUS FLESTRIN, the unborn poet, is of opinion that it is brought in merely to eke out a verse; but though in many points I am inclined to look upon this critick as irrefra∣gable, I must beg leave at present to appeal from his verdict; and, tho' Horace lays it down as rule not to admire any thing, I cannot help enjoying so pleasing an operation of the mind upon this occasion. We are here presented with a grand idea, no less than Jupiter shaking his sides and the heavens at the same time. The Pagan thunderer has often been said to agitate the pole with a nod, which in my mind gives too awful an image, whereas the one in question conveys an idea of him in good humour, and confirms what Mr. Orator Henley says in his excellent tracts, that “the deity is a joyous being.”</P>
<P>MARTINUS MACULARIUS,

<P><HI>Grafts the bays,</HI>] Much puzzle hath been occasioned among the naturalists concerning the engraftment here mentioned. HILL's natural history of trees and plants, vol. 52, page 336 saith, it has been frequently attempted, but that the tree of dulness will not admit any such inoculation. He adds in page 339, that he himself tried the experiment for two years succes∣sively, but that the twig of laurel, like a feather in the state of electricity, drooped and died the moment he touched it. Not∣withstanding this authority, it is well known that this opera∣tion has been performed by some choice spirits. ERASMUS in his encomium on Folly shews how it may be accomplished; in our own times POPE and GARTH found means to do the same: and in the sequel of this work, we make no doubt but the stem here-mentioned will bear some luxuriant branches, like the tree in VIRGIL,
<Q><L>Nec longum tempus, et ingens</L>
<L>Exait ad Caelum ramis felicibus arbos,</L>

<P><HI>Pimp,</HI>] An old English word for a mean fellow; see CHAU∣CER and SPENCER.</P>
<P><HI>Poet,</HI>] QUINBUS FLESTRIN saith, with his usual impor∣tance, that this is the only piece of justice done to our hero in this work. To this assents the widow at Cuper's who it seems is not a little proud of the “words by Dr. Hill, and the mu∣sick by Lewis Granon, Esq;” This opinion is further con∣firmed by Major England, who admires the pretty turns on Kitty, and Kate, and Catherine and Katy, but from these ve∣nerable authorities, judicious Reader, you may boldly dissent, <HI>meo periculo.</HI></P>
<P>MART. MAC.</P>
<P><HI>Puffer,</HI>] of this talent take a specimen. In a letter to him∣self he saith; “you have discovered many of the beauties of the ancients; they are obliged to you; we are obliged to you; were they alive they would thank you; we who are alive do thank you.” His constant custom of running on in this manner, occasioned the following epigram,

<L>An insect vile and mean.</L>
<L>Mast first, he knows, be magnify'd</L>
<L>Before it can be seen.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>'Pothecary, Play'r.</HI>] For both these vide WOODWARD's-letter,
Passim.</P>
<P><HI>Like the huge earth.</HI>] The allusion here seems to be taken from OVID, who describes the earth fixed in the air, by its own stupidity, or <HI>vis inertiae:</HI>—
<Q><L>Pendebat in aere tellus</L>
<L>Ponderitus librata suis.—</L></Q>
But, reader, dilate. your imagination to take in the much greater idea our poet here presents to you. consider the immense in∣anity of space, and then the comparative nothingness of the globe, and you may attain an adequate conception of our hero's reputation▪ and the mighty b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis it stands upon. It is worth ob∣serving here that our author▪ <HI>quasi aliud agens,</HI> displays at one touch of his pen more knowledge of the planetary system, than is to be found in all the volumes of the mathematicians.</P>
<P>This note is pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly by Macularius, and partly by Mr. Jinkyns, fhilomath.</P>
<P><HI>Say, Muse,</HI>] Observe, gentle reader, how tenderly our author treats his hero throughout his whole poem; he does not here impute his ridiculous conduct, and all that train of errors which have attended his consummate vanity, to his own perverse in∣clination, but with greater candour insinuates that some Daemon, soe to Hillario's repose, first misled his youthful imagination; which is a kind of apology for his life and character. He is not the only one who has been seduced to his ruin in this man∣ner. We read it in POPE,
<Q>Some Daemon whisper'd, Visto have a lade.</Q></P>
<P>Hence then arise our hero's misfortunes; and that the Daemon above-mentioned was a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe to truth, will appear from Hilliario's notable talent at misrepresenting circumstances, for which vide all the INSPECTORS.</P>
<P><HI>May that day appear,</HI>] This seems to be wrote with an eye to a beautiful passage in a very elegant poem;
<Q><L>Ye Gods annihilate both space and time,</L>
<L>And make two lovers happy.—</L></Q></P>
<P>The request is extremely modest, and I really wonder it was never complied with; but it must be said in favour of Mr. Smart, that he is still more reasonable in his demand, and it appears by the alteration in the stile, that his scheme may be reduced to practice though the other is mighty fine in theory. The INSPECTOR is of this opinion, and so is Monsieur de Scaizau.</P>
<P><HI>A tatter'd tap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stry</HI>] Our Author has been extremely negligent upon this occasion, and has indolently omitted an opportunity of displaying his talent for poetick imagery. HOMER has described ihe shield of Achilles with all the art of his imagi∣nation; VIRGIL has followed him in this point, and indeed both he and OVID, seem to be delighted when they have ei∣ther a picture to describe, or some representation in the labours of the loom. Hence arises a double delight; we admire the work of the artificer, and the poet's account of it; and this pleasure Mr. Smart might have impressed upon his readers in this passage, as many things were wrought into the tapestry here-mentioned. In one part our hero was administering to a patient, “and the fresh vomit runs for ever green.” The theatre at May-fair made a conspicuous figure in the piece—the pit seemed to rise in an uproar—the gallery opened its rude throats—and apples, oranges and halfpence flew about our hero's ears.—The mall in St. James's Park was displayed in a beautiful Vista, and you might perceive Hillario with his janty air waddling along.—In Mary le Bone fields, he was dancing round a glow worm, and finally the Rotunda at Ranelagh filled the eye with its magnificence, and in a corner of it stood a handsome young fellow holding a personage, dressed in blue s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k, by the ear; “the very worsted still looked black and blue.” There were many other curious figures, but out of a shameful laziness has our poet omitted them.</P>
<P>POLYMBTIS CANTABRIGIENSIS.</P>
<P><HI>Th' astonish'd hair:</HI>] This passage seems to be an imitation of the Sybil in the sixth book of VIRGIL;
<Q><L>Subito non wiltus, non color unus</L>
<L>Nec comtae mansere c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mae.—</L></Q>
and is admirably expressive of the witch's prophetic fury, and ushers in the prediction of Hillario's fortune with proper so∣lemnity.—</P>
<P>This note is by one of the Aeolists, mentioned with honour in the Tale of a Tub.</P>
<P><HI>Be th'</HI> INSPECTOR, <HI>&amp;c</HI>] When the Distemper first raged among the horned cattle, the king and council ordered a cer∣tain officer to super-intend the beasts, and to direct that such, as were found to be infected, should be knocked in the head.</P>
<P>This officer was called the INSPECTOR, and from thence I would venture to lay a wager, our hero derived his title.</P>
<P>BENTLEY, Junior.</P>
<P><HI>Beware of Irishman, &amp;c.</HI>] It extremely probable that our poet is intimately acquainted with the classics; he seems fre∣quently to have them in his eye, and such an air of enthusiasm runs through his whole speech, that the learned reader may easily perceive he has taken fire at some of the prophecies in HOMER and VIRGIL.—The whole is delivered in breaks, and unconnected transitions, which denote vehement emotions in the mind; and the hint here concerning the Irish is perfectly in the manner of all great epic poets, who generally give the reader some idea of what is to ensue, without unfolding the whole. Thus we fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in VIRGIL,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ella, horrida bella,</L>
<L>Et Tybrim multo spumantem sanguine cerno.</L></Q>
and again,
<Q>Alius Lati. jam partus Achilles.</Q>
And in The sequel of this work, I believe, it will be found, that as Aeneas had another Achilles, so our hero has had as formidable an adversary.</P>
<P><HI>Farewel, a long farewel,</HI>] The ingenious Mr. L—der says that the following passage is taken from a work, which he intends shortly to publish by subscription, and he has now in the press a pamphlet, called “Mr. Smart's Use and Abuse of the Mo∣derns.” But, with his leave, this passage is partly imitated from Cardinal Wolsey's speech, and from Othello.</P>
<P><HI>Neutral nonsense, &amp;c.</HI> The train, here described, is worthy of Hillahrio, pertness, dulness, scandal and malice, &amp;c, being the very constituents of an hero for the mock heroic, and it is not without propriety that nonsense is introduced with the epithet, neutral; nonsense being like a Dutchman, not only in an un∣meaning stupidity, but in the art of preserving a strict neu∣trality. This neutrality may be aptly explained by the fol∣lowing epigram,
<Q><L>Word-valiant wight, thou great he shrew,</L>
<L>That wrangles to no end;</L>
<L>Since nonsense is nor false nor true,</L>
<L>Thou'rt no man's foe or friend▪</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Falshood,</HI>] Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lady is described with two books in her hand, but our author chusing to preserve a neutrality, though not a nonsensical one, upon this occasion, the tories are at li∣berty to fill up this blank with Rapin, Burnet, or any names that will-sit the niches; and the whigs may, if they please, in∣sert Ec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard Higgons, &amp;c. But why, exclaimeth a certain critic, should falshood be given to Hillario?—Because, replieth Macularius, he has given many specimens of his talent that way. OUT hero took it into his he-id some time since to tell the world that he caned a gentleman, whom he called by the name of Mario; what degree of faith the town gave him upon that occasion, may be collected from the two following lines, by a certain wag who shall be nameless.
<Q><L>To beat one man great Hill was fated;</L>
<L>What man?—a man that he created.</L></Q>
The following epig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am may be also properly inserted here.</P>
<Q><L>What H—ll one day says, he the next does deny,</L>
<L>And candidly tells us—'tis all a damn'd lye:</L>
<L>Dear Doctor—this candour from you is not wanted;</L>
<L>For why shou'd you own it? 'tis taken for granted.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Crawls Flatt'ry, &amp;c.</HI>] Our hero is as remarkable for his en∣comiums, where it is his interest to commend, as for his abuse, where he has taken a dislike mslike; but from the latter he is casily to be bought off, as may be seen in the following excellent epigram.
<Q><L>An author's writings oft reveal,</L>
<L>where now and then he takes a meal.</L>

<L>What will not beef and pudding do?</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Without a muse, &amp;c.</HI>] No the devil a bit!—I am the only person that can do that!—My poems, written at fifteen, were done without the assistance of any muse, and better than all Smart's poetry.—The Muses are strumpets—they frequently give an intellectual <HI>gonorrhaea</HI>—Court debt not paid—I'll never be poet laureate.—Coup de grace unanswerable—Our foes shall knuckle—five pounds to any bishop that will equal this—<HI>Gum guiacum</HI> for <HI>Latin lignum vitae.</HI>—Adam the first Dutchman—victorious stroke for Old England—Tweedle-dum and Twee∣dle-dee.</P>
<P>Oratory-Right-Reason-Chapel, Saturday
13th of January, and old stile for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Jargon grav'd, &amp;c.</HI>] JARGON is here properly introduced graving our hero's titles, which are admirably brought into verse▪ but the gentleman who wrote the last note, Mr. Orator H—ley, takes umbrage at this passage, and exclaimeth to the following effect. “Jargon is meant for me.” There is more music in a peal of marrowbones and cleavers than in these verses.—I am a logician upon fundamentals.—Arationalist,—lover of <HI>mankande,</HI> Glastonberry thorn.-r-huzza, boys.—Wit a vivacious command of all objects and ideas.—I am the only wit in Great Britain. See Oratory tracts, &amp;c. 10036.”</P>
<P>Patience, good Mr. Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ator! We are not at leisure to answer thee at present, but must observe that <HI>Jargon</HI> has done more for our hero, than ever did the society at Bordeaux, as will ap∣pear from the following extract of a letter sent to MARTINUS MACULARIUS, by a fellow of that society:</P>

<Q><L>As things seem large which we thro' mists desecy,</L>

<P><HI>Wooden lion roar'd.</HI>] Not the black lion in Salisbury-court, Fleet-street, where the New Craftsman is published, nor yet the red lion at Brentford, but the beast of the Bedford, who may truly be said to have been alive, when animated by Ad∣dison and Steel, though now reduced to that state of Block∣headism, which is so conspicuous in his master. <HI>Ficulnus, in∣utile lignum!.</HI></P>

<P>VETUS SCHOL.</P>
<P><HI>Another Duck,</HI>] Hillario having a mind to celebrate and re∣commend a genius to the world, compares him to Stephen Duck, and at the close of a late INSPECTOR, cries<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out, “I have found another Duck, but who shall find a Caroline?”</P>
<P><HI>Print my soft essays,</HI>] Our hero for once has spoke truth of himself, for which we could produce the testimonies of several persons of distinction. Bath and Tunbridgewells have upon many occasions testified their gratitude to him on this head, as his works have been always found of singular use with the waters of those places. To this effect also speaketh that excellent commedian, Mr. Henry Woodward, in an ingenious parody <HI>on busy, curious, thirsty fly, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>And now, thou Goddess, &amp;c.</HI>] This invocation is perfectly in the spirit of ancient poetry. If I may use Milton's words, our author here presumes into the heavens, an earthly guest, and draws empyreal air. Hence he calls upon the Goddess to assist his strain, while he relates the councils of the Gods. VIRGIL, when the plot thickens upon his hands, as Mr. Byes has it, has offered up his prayers a second time to the Muse, and he seems to labour under: the weight of his subject, when he cries out,
<Q><HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> of us moveo, major rerum mihi nascitur ordo.</Q>
This is the case at present with the writer of the HILLIAD, and this piece of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>machinery will evince the absurdity of that Lucretian doctrine, which asserts that the Gods are wrapped up in a lazy indolence, and do not trouble themselves about human affairs. The words of Lucretius are,
<Q><L>Omn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s enim per se divûm natura necesseest▪</L>
<L>Immortali a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. summa cum pace fruatur,</L>
<L>Semota a rebus nofiris, disjunctaque longè.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is now recommended to the editors of the Anti-Lucretius
to make use of this instance to the contrary in the next publi∣cation of that work.—</P>
<P>M. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>Incumier'd space</HI>] Jupiter's speech is full of pomp and so∣lemnity, and is finely closed by a description of our hero, who is here said to take up a place in the creation to no purpose. What a different notion of the end of his existence has Hilla∣rio, from what we find delivered by the excellent Longinus in his treatise on the sublime. The passage is admirable, translated by the author of the pleasures of imagination. “The Godlike geniuses of Greece were well-assured that nature had not intended man for a low spirited or ignoble being; but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe, as before a multitude assembled at some heroic solemnity, that we might be spectators of all her magnifi∣cence, and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory▪ she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextin∣guishable love of every thing great and exalted, of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension. Hence by the very propensity of nature we are led to ad∣mire, not little springs or shallow rivulets, however clear and delicious, but the Nile, the Rhine, the Danube, and much more than all the Ocean.”—Instead of acting upon this plan, Hillario is employed in pursuit of insects in Ken∣sington-gardens, and as this is all the gratitude he pays for the being conferred upon him, he is finely termed an Insolvent tenant.</P>
<P><HI>By adoptior▪ be the fire, &amp;c.</HI>] Our hero has taken an entire letter from Sir Thomas Fnz-Osborne, and with inimitable effrontery published it in his INSPECTOR, NO. 239, as a pro∣duction of his own. We are informed that having been taxed with this affair, he declares with a great deal of art, that it was given him by another person, to which all we have to say is, that, the receiver is as bad as the thief.</P>
<P>M. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>Gierious to procure.</HI>] If our author could be thought capable of punning, I should imagine that the word <HI>procure,</HI> in this place, is made use of in preference to an appellation given to our hero in the commencement of this poem, viz. a <HI>Pimp,</HI> but the reader will please to recollect that the term <HI>Pimp</HI> is not in that passage used in its modern acceptation.</P>
<P><HI>Small was th' exertion, &amp;c</HI>] Not so fast, good poet, cries out in this place, M. MACULARIUS. We do not find that HIL∣LARIO, upon any occasion whatever, has been charged with stealing Apollo's quiver, and certain it is, that those arrows, which he has shot at all the word, never were taken from thence. But of Mercury it is recorded by HORACE, that he really did deceive the God of wit in this manner;
<Q><L>Te boves elim nisì reddidisses</L>
<L>Per dolum amotas, puerum minaci</L>
<L>Voce dum terret viduus pharetra</L>
<L>Risit Apollo.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Venus next express'd,</HI>] Venus rises in this assembly quite in the manner attributed to her in the ancient poets; thus we see in VIRGIL that she is all mildness, and at every word breathes Ambrosia;
<Q><L>—At non Venus aurea contra,</L>
<L>Pauca refert.—</L></Q></P>
<P>She is to speak upon this occasion, as well as in the case pro∣duced from the Aeneid, in favour of a much loved son, though indeed we cannot say that she has been quite so kind. to Hilla∣rio, as formerly she was to Aeneas, it being evident that she has not bestowed upon him that lustre of youthful bloom, and that liquid radiance of the eye, which she is said to have given the pious Trojan.</P>
<Q><L>—L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>enque juventae</L>
<L>Purpureum, et laetos oculis afflavit honores.</L></Q>
<P>On the contrary Venus here talks of his black self, which makes it suspected that she reconciled herself to this hue, out of a compliment to Vulcan, of whom she has frequent fa∣vours to solicit: and perhaps it may appear hereafter, that she procured a sword for our hero from the celestial black∣smith's forge. One thing is not a little surprizing, that, while Venus speaks on the side of Hillario, she should omit the real utility he has been of to the cause of love by his experience as an apothecary, of which he himself hath told us, several have profited; and it should be remembered at the same time, that he actually has employed his person in the service of Venus, and has now an offspring of the amorous congress. It is moreover notorious, that having, in his elegant language, tasted of the cool stream, he was ready to plunge in again, and therefore publicly set himself up for a wife, and thus, became a fortune-hunter with his pen, and if he has failed in his de∣sign, it is because the ladies do not approve the new scheme of propagation without the knowledge of a man, which Hil∣lario pretended to explain so handsomely in the <HI>Lucina sine concubitu.</HI>—But the truth is, he never wrote a syllable of this book, though he transcribed part of it, and shewed it to a bookseller, in order to procure a higher price for his pro∣ductions.</P>
<P>QUIN<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>US FLESTRIN.</P>
<P><HI>Diamond in an Aethiop's ear,</HI>] There is neither morality, nor integrity, nor unity, nor universality in this poem.—The au∣thor of it is a SMART; I hope to see a SMARTEAD published; I had my pocket picked the other day, as I was going through Paul's Church-yard, and I firmly believe it was this little au∣thor, as the man who can pun, will also pick a pocket.</P>
<P>JOHN DENNIS, Junior.
<HI>Inanity</HI></P>
<P><HI>Inanity will ever be, &amp;c.]</HI> Our author does not here mean to list himself among the disputants concerning pure space, but the doctrine he would advance, is, that nothing can come from nothing. In so unbelieving an age as this, it is possible this tenet may not be received, but if the reader has a mind to see it handled at large, he may find it in Rumgurtius, vol. 16, pagi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a 1001. “De hac re multum et turpiter hallucinantur scriptores tam exteri quam domestici. Spatium enim ab∣solutum et relativum debe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t distingui, priusquam distincta esse possunt; neque ulla alia regula ad normam rei meta∣physicâ quadrabit, quam triplex consideratio de substantiâ inanitatis, sive entitate nihili, quae quidem consideratio tri∣plex ad unam reduci potest necessitatem; nempe idem spa∣tium de quo jam satis dictum est.” This opinion is further corroborated by the tracts of the society of Bourdeaux. “Se∣lon la distinction entre les choses, qui n'ont pas de diffe∣rence, il nous faut absolument agréer, que les idées, qui ont frappé l'imagination, peuvent bien être effacées, pourvu qu'on ne s'avise pas d'oublier cet espace immense, qui envi∣ronne toute la nature, et le systéme des étoiles.” Among our countrymen, I do not know any body that has handled this subject so well as the accurate Mr. Fielding, in his essay upon Nothing, which the reader may find in the first volume of his miscellanies; but with all due deference to his autho∣rity, we beg leave to dissent from one assertion in the said essay; the residence of nothing might in his time have been in a critick's head, and we are apt to believe that there is a something like nothing in most critick's heads to this day, and this false appearance misled the excellent metaphysician just quoted; for nothing, in its <HI>puris naturelibus,</HI> as Gravesend describes it in his experimental philosophy, doe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subsist no where so properly at present as in the pericranium of our hero.</P>
<P>MART. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>Musick slows,</HI>] Persons of most genius, says the INSPECTOR, Friday Jan. 26, Number 587, “have in general been the fondest of musick; Sir Isaac Newton was remarkable for his affection for harmony; he was scarce ever missed at the beginning of any performance, but was seldom seen at the end of it.” And indeed of this opinion is M. MACULA∣RIUS; and he further adds, that if Sir Isaac was still living it is probable he would be at the beginning of the INSPECTOR's next song at Cuper's, but that he would not be at the end of it, may be proved to a mathematical demonstration, though Hillario takes somuch pleasure in beating time to them himself, and though he so frequently exclaims, very fine!—O fine!—vastly fine!—Since the lucubration of Friday Jan. 26th has been mentioned, we think proper to observe here, that his IN∣SPECTORSHIP has the most notable talent at a motto—QUIN∣BUS FLESTRIN saith, “he is a tartar for that,” and of this, Jearned reader, take a specimen along with you. How aptly upon the subject of musick does he bid his readers pluck grapes from the loaded vine!</P>
<Q>Carpite de plenis pendentes vitibus uvas. <HI>OVID.</HI></Q>
<P>The above-mentioned QUINBUS FLESTRIN, peremptorily says, this line has been cavilled at by some minor critics, be∣cause, “the grapes are sour;” and indeed of that way of thinking is MACULARIUS, who hath been greatly astonished at the taste of Hillario, in so frequently culling from Valerius Flaccus. But he is clearly of opinion, that the lines from Welstead and Dennis, are selefcted with great judgment, and are hung out as proper signs of what entertainment is to be furnished up to his customers.</P>
<P><HI>Penumbra of a thing,</HI>] Whatever mean opinion Dr. Phoebus may entertain of his terrestial brother physician and poet: on earth, Hillario is talked of in a different manner, as will ap∣pear from the following parody on the lines prefixed by Mr.|DRYDEN, to Milton's Paradise Lost<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<Q><L>Three wise great men in the same Aera born,</L>

<P>QUINBUS FLESTRIN.</P>
<P><HI>Lull'd to sleep again.]</HI> The hypnotick, or soporiferous quaili∣ty of Hillario's pen, is manifest from the following assevera∣tion, which was published in the New Craftsman, and is a letter from a tradesman in the city.</P>
<P>“SIR,”</P>
<P>“From a motive of gratitude, and for the sake of those of my fellow-creatures, who may unhappily be afflicted; as I have been for some time past, I beg leave, through the channel of your paper, to communicate the disorder I have laboured under, and the extraordinary cure I have lately met with. I have had for many months successively a slow nervous fever, with a constant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lutter on my spirits, attend∣ed with pertinacious watchings, twitchings of the nerves, “and other grievous symptoms, which reduced me to a mere shadow. At length, by the interposition of divine provi∣dence, a friend who had himself experienced it, advised me to have recourse to the reading of the INSPECTORS. I ac∣cordingly took one of them, and the effect it had upon me was such, that I fell into a profound sleep, which lasted near six and thirty hours. By this I have attained a more composed habit of body, and I now doze away almost all my time, but for fear of a lethargy, am ordered to take them in smaller quantities. A paragraph at a time now answers my purpose, and under heaven I owe my sleeping powers to the above-mentioned INSPECTORS. I look upon them to be a grand soporificum mirabile, very proper to be had in all families. He makes great allowance to those who by them to sell again, or to send abroad to the plantations; and the above fact I am ready to attest when∣ever called upon.

<P><HI>A paltry Play'r, &amp;c.]</HI> It appears that the first effort of this universal genius, who is lately become remarkable as the Bo∣badil of literature, was to excell in Pantomime. What was the event?—he was damned.—Mr. Cross, the prompter, took great pains to fit him for the part of Oroonoko—he was damned.—He attempted Captain Blandford—he was damned.—He acted Constant in the Provok'd Wife—he was damned.—He represented the Botanist in Romeo and Juliet, at the Little.</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatre in the Hay-market, under the direction of Mr. The. Cibber—he was damned.—He appeared in the character of Lothario, at the celebrated theatre in May-Fair—he was damned there too. Mr. Cross, however, to alleviate his misfortune, charitably bestowed upon him a 15th part of his own benefit. See the Gentleman's Magazine for last December, and also Woodward's letter, passim.</P>
<P><HI>No mortal read.]</HI> Notwithstanding this assertion of Momus, our hero pro eâ, quâ est, verecundaì, compareth himself to Addison and Steele, which occasioned the following epigram, by the right hon. the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl * * * addressed to the right ho∣nourable G—e D—n.</P>

<P>And now, reader, please to observe, that, since so ingenious a nobleman hath condescended to take notice of his INSPECTOR∣SHIP, Mr. Smart doth not need any apology for the notice he hath also taken of him.</P>
<P>M. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>The trumpet; &amp;c.]</HI> In a very pleasant account of the riots in Drury-lane Play-house, by Henry Fielding, Es{que} we find the following humorous description of our hero in the character of a trumpeter. “They all ran away except the trumpeter, who having an empyema in his side, as well as several dreadful bruises on his breech, was taken. When he was brought before Garrick to be examined, he said the ninnies, to whom he had the honour to be trumpeter, had resented the use made of the monsters by Garrick. That it was unfair, that it was cruel, that it was inhuman to employ a man's own subjects against him. That Rich was lawful sovereign over all the monsters in the uni∣verse, with much more of the same kind; all which Garrick seemed to think unworthy of an answer; but when the trum∣peter challenged him as his acquaintance, the chief with great disdain turned his back, and ordered the fellow to be dismissed with full power of trumpeting again on what side he pleased;.” Hillario has since trumpeted in the cause of Pantomime, the gaudy scenery of which with great judgment he dismisses from the Opera-house, and saith, it is now fixed in its proper place in the theatre. On this occasion, MAGULARIUS cannot help exclaiming, “O Shakespear! O Johnson! rest, rest per∣turbed spirits.”</P>
<P><HI>Handel, Arne, and Boyce,</HI>] The first of these gentlemen may be justly looked upon as the Milton of musick, and the talent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the two latter may not improperly be delineated by callings them the Drydens of their profession, as they not only touch the strings of love with exquisite art, but also, when they please, reach the truly sublime.</P>
<P><HI>Hogarth is the Garrick, &amp;c.]</HI> The opinion which Mr. Hogarth entertains of our hero's writings, may be guess'd at, by any one who will take the pleasure of looking at a print called Beer-street, in which Hillario's critique upon the Royal Soci∣ety is put into a basket directed to the trunk-maker in St. Paul's Church-yard. I shall only just observe that the com∣pliment in this passage to Mr. Hogarth is reciprocal, and re∣flects a lustre on Mr. Garrick, both of them having similar talents, equally capable of the highest elevation, and of repre∣senting the ordinary scenes of life, with the most exquisite humour.</P>
<P><HI>Conclusion.]</HI> And now candid reader, MARTINUS MACU∣LARIUS hath attended thee throughout the first book of this most delectable poem. As it is not improbable that those will be inquisitive after the particulars relating to this thy commentator, he here gives thee notice that he is preparing for the press, Memoirs of MARTINUS MACULARIUS, with his travels by sea and land, together with his slights aerial, and descents subterraneous, &amp;c. And in the mean time he bids thee farewell, until the appearance of the second book of the HILLIIAD, of which we will say, <HI>speciosa miracula pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eti.</HI> And so as Terence says, <HI>Vos valete &amp; plaudite.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>THE SWEETS OF EVENING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE sweets of evening charm the mind,</L>
<L>Sick of the sultry day;</L>
<L>The bodv then no more confin'd,</L>

<L>When Phabus sheathes his ray.</L>

<L>While all-serene the summer moon</L>
<L>Sends glances thro' the trees,</L>
<L>And Philomel begins ker tune,</L>
<L>Asteria too shall help her soon</L>
<L>With voice of skilful ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A nosegay, every thing that grows,</L>
<L>And music, every sound</L>
<L>To lull the sun to his repose;</L>
<L>The skies are coloured like the rose</L>
<L>With lively streaks around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all the changes rung by time</L>
<L>None half so sweet appear,</L>
<L>As those when thoughts themselves sublime,</L>
<L>And with superior natures chime</L>
<L>In fancy's highest sphere.</L>

<L>Sweet bird! whose fate and mine agree,</L>

<L>When heavy hung thy flagging wing,</L>
