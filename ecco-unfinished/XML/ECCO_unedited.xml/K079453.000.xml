<LG>
<L>ROSCIUS deceas'd, each high aspiring play'r</L>
<L>Push'd all his int'rest for the vacant chair;</L>
<L>The buskin'd heroes of the mimic stage</L>
<L>No longer whine in love, and rant in rage;</L>
<L>The monarch quits his throne, and condescends</L>
<L>Humbly to court the favour of his friends;</L>
<L>For pity's sake tells undeserv'd mishaps,</L>
<L>And, their applause to gain, recounts his claps.</L>
<L>Thus the victorious chiefs of ancient Rome,</L>
<L>To win the mob, a suppliant's form assume;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
In pompous strain fight o'er th' extinguish'd war,</L>
<L>And shew where honour bled in ev'ry scar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But though bare Merit might in Rome appear</L>
<L>The strongest plea for favour, 'tis not here;</L>
<L>We form our judgment in another way;</L>
<L>And they will best succeed, who best can pay:</L>
<L>Those, who would gain the votes of British tribes,</L>
<L>Must add to force of Merit, force of Bribes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What can an actor give? in ev'ry age</L>
<L>Cash hath been rudely banish'd from the stage;</L>
<L>Monarchs themselves, to grief of ev'ry play'r,</L>
<L>Appear as often as their image there:</L>
<L>They can't, like candidate for other seat,</L>
<L>Pour seas of wine, and mountains raise of meat.</L>
<L>Wine! they could bribe you with the world as soon;</L>
<L>And of roast beef, they only know the tune:</L>
<L>But what they have they give; could CLIVE do more,</L>
<L>Though for each million he had brought home four?</L>

<L>SHUTER keeps open house at Southwark fair,</L>
<L>And hopes the friends of humour will be there.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
In Smithfield, YATES prepares the rival treat</L>
<L>For those who laughter love, instead of meat;</L>
<L>FOOTE, at Old House, for even FOOTE will be,</L>
<L>In self-conceit, an actor, bribes with tea;</L>
<L>Which WILKINSON at second-hand receives,</L>
<L>And at the New, pours waters on the leaves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The town divided, each runs sev'ral ways,</L>
<L>As passion, humour, int'rest, party, sways.</L>
<L>Things of no moment, colour of the hair,</L>
<L>Shape of a leg, complexion brown or fair,</L>
<L>A dress well chosen, or a patch misplac'd,</L>
<L>Conciliate favour, or create distaste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From galleries loud peals of laughter roll,</L>
<L>And thunder SHUTER'S praises,—he's so <HI>droll.</HI></L>
<L>Embox'd, the ladies must have something smart,</L>
<L>PALMER! Oh! PALMER tops the janty part.</L>
<L>Seated in pit, the dwarf, with aching eyes,</L>
<L>Looks up, and vows that BARRY'S out of size,</L>
<L>Whilst to six feet the vig'rous stripling grown,</L>
<L>Declares that GARRICK is another COAN.</L>

<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>When place of judgment is by whim supply'd,</L>
<L>And our opinions have their rise in pride;</L>
<L>When, in discoursing on each mimic elf,</L>
<L>We praise and censure with an eye to self;</L>
<L>All must meet friends, and ACKMAN bids as fair</L>
<L>In such a court, as GARRICK, for the chair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length agreed, all squabbles to decide,</L>
<L>By some one judge the cause was to be try'd;</L>
<L>But this their squabbles did afresh renew,</L>
<L>Who should be judge in such a trial:—Who?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For JOHNSON some, but JOHNSON, it was fear'd,</L>
<L>Would be too grave; and STERNE too gay appear'd;</L>
<L>Others for FRANKLIN voted; but 'twas known,</L>
<L>He sicken'd at all triumphs but his own;</L>
<L>For COLMAN many, but the peevish tongue</L>
<L>Of prudent Age found out that he was Young.</L>
<L>For MURPHY some few <HI>pil'fring</HI> wits declar'd,</L>
<L>Whilst FOLLY clapp'd her hands, and WISDOM star'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To mischief train'd, e'en <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom his mother's womb,</L>

Adopting arts, by which gay villains rise,</L>
<L>And reach the heights, which honest men despise;</L>
<L>Mute at the bar, and in the senate loud,</L>
<L>Dull 'mongst the dullest, proudest of the proud;</L>
<L>A pert prim Prater of the <HI>northern</HI> race,</L>
<L>Guilt in his heart, and famine in his face,</L>
<L>Stood forth,—and thrice he wav'd his lilly hand—</L>
<L>And thrice he twirl'd his Tye—thrice strok'd his band—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“At Friendship's call (thus oft with trait' rous aim,</L>
<L>Men, void of faith, usurp faith's sacred name)</L>
<L>At Friendship's call I come, by MURPHY sent,</L>
<L>Who thus by me <HI>developes</HI> his intent.</L>
<L>But lest, <HI>tranfus'd,</HI> the Spirit Should be lost,</L>
<L>That Spirit, which in storms of <HI>Rhet'ric</HI> tost,</L>

<L>In his own words his own intentions hear.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Thanks to my friends.—But to vile <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortunes born,</L>
<L>No robes of fur these shoulders must adorn.</L>
<L>Vain your applause, no aid from thence I draw;</L>
<L>Vain all my wit,—for what is wit in law?</L>
<L>Twice (curs'd rememb'rance!) twice I strove to gain</L>

Who in the TEMPLE and GRAY'S-INN, prepare</L>
<L>For client's wretched feet the legal snare;</L>
<L>Dead to those arts, which polish and refine,</L>
<L>Deaf to all worth, because that worth was MINE,</L>
<L>Twice did those blockheads startle at my name,</L>
<L>And, foul rejection! gave me up to shame.</L>
<L>To laws and lawyers then I bad adieu,</L>
<L>And plans of far more lib'ral note pursue.</L>
<L>Who will may be a Judge—my kindling breast</L>
<L>Burns for that Chair which ROSCIUS once possess'd.</L>
<L><HI>Here</HI> give your votes, your int'rest <HI>here</HI> exert,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>With slcek appearance, and with ambling pace,</L>
<L>And, type of vacant head, with vacant face,</L>
<L>The Proteus HILL put in his <HI>modest</HI> plea,—</L>
<L>“Let Favour speak for others, Worth for me.”—</L>
<L>For who, like him, his various pow'rs could call</L>
<L>Into so many shapes, and shine in all?</L>
<L>Who could so nobly grace the motley list,</L>
<L>Actor, Inspector, Doctor, Botanist?</L>

Who can?—But WOODWARD came,—HILL slipp'd away.</L>
<L>Melting, like ghosts before the rising day.</L>

<L>With that <HI>low</HI> CUNNING, which in fools supplies,</L>

<L>Which nature, kind indulgent parent, gave</L>
<L>To qualify the Blockhead for a Knave;</L>
<L>With that <HI>smooth</HI> FALSHOOD, whose appearance charms,</L>

<L>Which to the lowest depths of guile descends,</L>
<L>By vilest means pursues the vilest ends,</L>
<L>Wears Friendship's mask for purposes of spite,</L>
<L>Fawns in the day, and Butchers in the night;</L>
<L>With that <HI>malignant</HI> ENVY, which turns pale,</L>
<L>And sickens, even if a friend prevail,</L>
<L>Which merit and success pursues with hate,</L>
<L>And damns the worth it cannot imitate;</L>
<L>With the <HI>cold</HI> CAUTION of a coward's spleen,</L>
<L>Which fears not guilt, but always seeks a screen,</L>
<L>Which keeps this maxim ever in her view—</L>
<L>What's basely done, should be done safely too;</L>
<L>With that <HI>dull, rooted, callous</HI> IMPUDENCE,</L>

Ne'er blush'd, unless, in spreading VICE'S snares,</L>
<L>She blunder'd on some Virtue <HI>unawares;</HI></L>
<L>With all these blessings, which we seldom find</L>
<L>Lavish'd by Nature on <HI>one</HI> happy mind,</L>
<L>A Motley Figure, of the FRIBBLE Tribe,</L>
<L>Which Heart can scarce conceive, or pen describe,</L>
<L>Came <HI>simp'ring</HI> on; to ascertain whose sex</L>
<L>Twelve sage impannell'd Matrons would perplex.</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Male,</HI> nor <HI>Female; Neither,</HI> and yet both;</L>
<L>Of <HI>Neuter</HI> Gender, tho' of <HI>Irish</HI> growth;</L>
<L>A six-foot suckling, mincing in its gait;</L>
<L>Affected, peevish, prim, and delicate;</L>
<L>Fearful <HI>it</HI> seem'd, tho' of Athletic make,</L>

<L><HI>Its</HI> tender form, and <HI>savage</HI> motion spread</L>
<L>O'er its pale cheeks the horrid manly red.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Much did <HI>It</HI> talk, in <HI>its</HI> own <HI>pretty</HI> phrase,</L>

Much too <HI>It</HI> chatter'd of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Laws,</L>
<L>Misjudging Critics, and misplac'd applause,</L>
<L>Then, with a self-complacent jutting air,</L>
<L>It smil'd, it smirk'd, It wriggl'd to the chair;</L>
<L>And with an aukward briskness not its own,</L>
<L>Looking around, and <HI>perking</HI> on the throne,</L>
<L>Triumphant seem'd, when that strange savage Dame,</L>
<L>Known but to few, or only known by name,</L>
<L>Plain COMMON SENSE, appear'd, by Nature there</L>
<L>Appointed, with plain TRUTH, to guard the Chair.</L>
<L>The Pageant saw, and blasted with her frown,</L>

<LG>
<L>Nor shall the MUSE (for even there the pride</L>

<L>Nor shall the MUSE (should Fate ordain her rhimes,</L>

<L>With such a Trifler's name her pages blot;</L>
<L>Known be the Character, the <HI>Thing</HI> forgot;</L>

<L>Cold-blooded critics, by enervate sires</L>
<L>Scarce hammer'd out, when nature's feeble sires</L>

Glimmer'd their last; whose slugglish blood, half froze,</L>
<L>Creeps lab'ring thro' the veins; whose heart ne'er glows</L>
<L>With fancy-kindled heat:—A servile race,</L>
<L>Who, in mere want of fault, all merit place;</L>
<L>Who blind obedience pay to ancient schools,</L>
<L>Bigots to Greece, and slaves to musty rules;</L>
<L>With solemn consequence declar'd that none</L>
<L>Could judge that cause but SOPHOCLES alone.</L>
<L>Dupes to their fancied excellence, the crowd,</L>
<L>Obsequious to the sacred dictate, bow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When, from amidst the throng, a Youth stood forth,</L>
<L>Unknown his person, not unknown his worth;</L>
<L>His looks bespoke applause; alone he stood,</L>
<L>Alone he stemm'd the mighty critic flood.</L>
<L>He talk'd of ancients, as the man became</L>
<L>Who priz'd our own, but envied not their same;</L>
<L>With noble rev'rence spoke of Greece and Rome,</L>
<L>And scorn'd to tear the laurel from the tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“But more than just to other countries grown,</L>
<L>Must we turn base apostates to our own?</L>
<L>Where do these words of Greece and Rome excel,</L>
<L>That England may not please the car as well?</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
What mighty magic's in the place or air,</L>
<L>That all perfection, needs must center there?</L>
<L>In states, let strangers blindly be preferr'd;</L>
<L>In state of letters, Merit should be heard.</L>
<L>Genius is of no country, her pure ray</L>
<L>Spreads all abroad, as gen'ral as the day:</L>
<L>Foe to restraint, from place to place she flies,</L>
<L>And-may hereafter e'en in Holland rise,</L>
<L>May not, to give a pleasing fancy scope,</L>
<L>And chear a patriot heart with patriot hope;</L>
<L>c May not some great extensive genius raise,</L>
<L>The name of Britain 'bove Athenian praise;</L>
<L>And, whilst brave thirst of same his bosom warms,</L>
<L>Make England great in Letters as in Arms?</L>
<L>There may—there hath—and SHAKESPEARE'S muse aspires</L>
<L>Beyond the reach of Greece; with native fires</L>
<L>Mounting aloft, he wings his daring flight,</L>
<L>Whilst SOPHOCLES below stands trembling at his height.</L>
<L>Why should we then abroad for judges roam,</L>
<L>When abler judges we may find at home?</L>
<L>Happy in tragic and in comic pow'rs,</L>
<L>Have we not SHAKESPEARE?—Is not JOHNSON ours?</L>
<L>For them, your nat'ral judges, Britons, vote;</L>
<L>Tliey'll judge like Britons, who like Britons wrote.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L>He said, and conquer'd—Sense resum'd her sway,</L>
<L>And disappointed pedants stalk'd away.</L>
<L>SHAKESPEARE and JOHNSON, with deserv'd applause,</L>
<L>Joint-judges were ordain'd to try the cause.</L>
<L>Mean-time the stranger ev'ry voice employ'd,</L>
<L>To ask or tell his name.—“Who is it?”—LLOYD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, when the aged friends of JOB stood mute,</L>
<L>And, tamely prudent, gave up the dispute,</L>
<L>ELIHU, with the decent warmth of youth,</L>
<L>Boldly stood forth the advocate of Truth;</L>
<L>Consuted Falshood, and disabled pride,</L>
<L>Whilst bassled age stood snarling at his side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The day of tryal's flx'd, nor any fear</L>
<L>Lest day of tryal should be put off here.</L>
<L>Causes but seldom for delay can call</L>
<L>In courts where forms are few, fees none at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning came, nor find I that the sun,</L>
<L>As he on other great events hath done,</L>

<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<L>Full in the centre of a spacious plain,</L>
<L>On plan entirely new, where nothing vain,</L>
<L>Nothing magnificent appear'd, but Art,</L>
<L>With decent modesty, perform'd her part,</L>
<L>Rose a tribunal: from no other court</L>
<L>It borrow'd ornament, or sought support:</L>
<L>No juries here were pack'd to kill or clear,</L>
<L>No bribes were taken, nor oaths broken here;</L>
<L>No gownsmen, partial to a client's cause,</L>
<L>To their own purpose tun'd the pliant laws.</L>
<L>Each judge was true and steady to his trust:,</L>
<L>As MANSFIELD wise, and as old FORSTER just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the first seat, in robe of various dyes,</L>
<L>A noble wildness flashing from his eyes,</L>
<L>Sat SHAKESPEARE.—In one hand a wand he bore.</L>
<L>For mighty wonders fam'd in days of yore;</L>
<L>The other held a globe, which to his will</L>
<L>Obedient turn'd, and own'd the master's skill:</L>
<L>Things of the noblest kind his genius drew,</L>
<L>And look'd through Nature at a single view:</L>
<L>A loose he gave to his unbounded soul,</L>
<L>And taught new lands to rise, new seas to roll;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Call'd into being scenes unknown before,</L>
<L>And, passing Nature's bounds, was something more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next JOHNSON sat, in antient learning train'd,</L>
<L>His rigid Judgment Fancy's flights restrain'd,</L>
<L>Correctly prun'd each wild luxuriant thought,</L>
<L>Mark'd out her course, nor spar'd a glorious fault.</L>
<L>The book of man he read with nicest art,</L>
<L>And ransack'd all the secrets of the heart;</L>
<L>Exerted Penetration's utmost force,</L>
<L>And trac'd each passion to its proper source,</L>
<L>Then, strongly mark'd, in liveliest. colours drew,</L>
<L>And brought each foible forth to public view.</L>
<L>The Coxcomb felt a lash in ev'ry word,</L>
<L>And fools hung out, their brother fools deterr'd.</L>
<L>His comic humour kept the world in awe,</L>
<L>And Laughter frighten'd Folly more than Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, hark!—The trumpet sounds, the crowd gives way,</L>
<L>And the procession comes in just array.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now should I, in some sweet poetic line,</L>

Invoke the muse to quit her calm abode,</L>
<L>And waken mem'ry with a sleeping ode.</L>
<L>For how should mortal man, in mortal verse,</L>

<L>But give, kind Dulness, memory and rhime,</L>
<L>We'll put off Genius till another time.</L>

<LG>
<L>First, ORDER came,—with solemn step, and slow,</L>
<L>In measur'd time his feet were taught to go.</L>
<L>Behind, from time to time, he cast his eye,</L>
<L>Lest This should quit his place, That step awry.</L>
<L>Appearances to save his only care;</L>
<L>So things seems right, no matter what they are.</L>
<L>In him his parents saw themselves renew'd,</L>
<L>Begotten by sir Critic on saint Prude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then came <HI>drum, trumpet, hautboy, fiddle, flute;</HI></L>
<L>Next <HI>snuffer, sweeper, shifter, soldier, mute:</HI></L>
<L>Legions of angels all in white advance;</L>
<L>Furies, all fire, come forward in a dance:</L>
<L>Pantomine figures then are brought to view,</L>
<L>Fools hand in hand with fools, go two by two.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here HAVARD, all serene, in the same strains,</L>
<L>Loves, hates, and rages, triumphs, and complains;</L>
<L>His easy vacant face proclaim'd a heart</L>

<L>With him came mighty DAVIES.—On my life,</L>
<L>That DAVIES hath a very pretty wife!</L>
<L>Statesman all over!—In plots famous grown!—</L>
<L>He mouths a sentence, as curs mouth a bone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next HOLLAND came.—With truly tragic stalk,</L>
<L>He creeps, he flies.—A Hero should not walk.</L>
<L>As if with heav'n he warr'd, his eager eyes</L>
<L>Planted their batteries against the skies,</L>
<L>Attitude, action, air, pause, start, sigh, groan,</L>
<L>He borrow'd, and made use of as his own.</L>
<L>By fortune thrown on any other stage,</L>
<L>He might, perhaps, have pleas'd an easy age;</L>

<L>His eyes, in gloomy socket taught to roll,</L>

<L>Small diff'rence 'twixt the Stoic and the Brute.</L>
<L>In fancied scenes, as in life's real plan,</L>
<L>He could not, for a moment, sink the Man.</L>
<L>In whate'er cast his character was laid,</L>
<L>Self still, like oil, upon the surface play'd.</L>

<L>His action's always strong, but sometimes such</L>

Wantonly cheating o'er and o'er</L>
<L>Those who had cheated been before:</L>
<L>Such FLATT'RY came in evil hour,</L>
<L>Pois'ning the royal ear of pow'r,</L>

<L>Would be first Minister of State.</L>

<LG>
<L>Within the Chariot, all alone,</L>
<L>High seated on a kind of throne,</L>
<L>With pebbles grac'd, a Figure came,</L>
<L>Whom Justice would, but dare not, name.</L>
<L>Hard times when Justice, without fear,</L>
<L>Dare not bring forth to public ear</L>
<L>The names of those, who dare offend</L>

<L>In <HI>foreign</HI> garments he was clad,</L>
<L><HI>Sage</HI> Ermine o'er the glossy <HI>Plaid</HI></L>
<L>Call: rev'rend honour, on his heart,</L>
<L>Wrought by the curious hand of Art,</L>
<L>In silver wrought, and brighter far</L>
<L>Than heav'nly or than earthly Star,</L>

Shone a <HI>White Rose,</HI> the Emblem dear</L>
<L>Of him He ever must revere,</L>
<L>Of that dread Lord, who, with his host</L>
<L>Of faithful native rebels lost,</L>
<L>Like those black Spirits doom'd to hell,</L>
<L>At once from pow'r and virtue fell;</L>
<L>Around his clouded brows was plac'd</L>
<L>A <HI>Bonnet,</HI> most superbly grac'd</L>
<L>With mighty <HI>Thistles,</HI> nor forgot</L>
<L>The sacred motto, <HI>Touch me not.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>In the right-hand a sword He bore</L>
<L>Harder than Adamant, and more</L>
<L>Fatal than winds, which from the mouth</L>
<L>Of the rough North invade the South;</L>
<L>The reeking blade to view presents</L>
<L>The blood of helpless Innocents,</L>
<L>And on the hilt, as meek become</L>
<L>As Lambs before the Shearers dumb,</L>
<L>With downcast eye, and solemn show</L>
<L>Of deep unutterable woe,</L>
<L>Mourning the time when FREEDOM reign'd,</L>
<L>Fast to a rock was Justice chain'd.</L>

<L>In his left-hand, in wax imprest,</L>

<L>An <HI>Image,</HI> cast in baby mould,</L>
<L>He held, and seem'd o'erjoy'd to hold.</L>
<L>On this he fix'd his eyes, to this</L>
<L>Bowing he gave the loyal kiss,</L>

<L>Seem'd to desire the ANTITYPE.</L>
<L>What if to that <HI>Pretender</HI>'s foes</L>
<L>His greatness, nay, his life he owes,</L>

<L>Faithful to JAMES he still remains,</L>
<L>Tho' he the friend of GEORGE appear:</L>
<L>Dissimulations Virtue here:</L>

<LG>
<L>Jealous and Mean, he with a frown</L>

Aw'd by his fears, he has ho heart</L>
<L>To take a great and open part;</L>
<L>Mines in a subtle train he springs,</L>
<L>And, secret, saps the ears of Kings;</L>
<L>But not e'en there continues firm</L>
<L>'Gainst the resistance of a worm;</L>

<L>Much to the credit of his brain</L>
<L>Puzzles the cause he can't maintain,</L>
<L>Proceeds on most familiar grounds,</L>
<L>And, where he can't convince, confounds;</L>
<L>Talents of rarest stamp and size,</L>
<L>To Nature false, he misapplies,</L>
<L>And turns to poison what was sent</L>
<L>For purposes of nourishment.</L>

<PB N="367" REF="365"/>
<L><HI>Paleness,</HI> not such as on his wings</L>

<L>From conscious baseness, conscious vice,</L>

<L>To upstart Fortunes, ever tied,</L>

<L>Soon as the Car reach'd land, He rose,</L>

<L>In Cities than elsewhere, to make</L>

He cast his baleful eyes around;</L>
<L>Fix'd without motion to the ground,</L>
<L>Fear waiting on surprize, All stood,</L>

<L>No more they thought of <HI>Pomp,</HI> no more</L>

Abash'd the Monster hung his head,</L>

<L>LOYALTY, LIBERTY, and LAW,</L>
<L>Impatient of the galling chain,</L>
