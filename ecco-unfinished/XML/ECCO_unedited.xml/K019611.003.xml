<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the TRUE HONOUR of MAN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROVERBS, iv. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she
shall bring thee to honour.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE love of honour is one of the
strongest passions in the human
heart.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE> It shows itself in our earliest
years; and is coeval with the first exer∣tions
or reason. It accompanies us through
all the stages of subsequent life; and in
private stations discovers it self no less than
in the higher ranks of society. In their
ideas of what constitutes honour, men
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
greatly vary, and often grossly err. But
of somewhat which they conceive to form
pre-eminence and distinction, all are desi∣rous.
All wish, by some means or other,
to acquire respect from those among whom
they live; and to contempt and disgrace,
none are insensible.</P>
<P>Among the advantages which attend reli∣gion
and virtue, the honour which they
confer on man is frequently mentioned in
scripture as one of the most considerable.
<HI>Wisdom is the principal thing,</HI> says Solomon
in the passage where the text lies, <HI>therefore
get wisdom; and with all thy getting, get
understanding. Exalt her, and she shall pro∣mote
thee; she shall bring thee to honour, when
thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thine
head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory
shall she deliver to thee.</HI> It is evident that
throughout all the sacred writings, and par∣ticularly
in this book of Proverbs, by <HI>wisdom</HI>
is to be understood a principle of re∣ligion
producing virtuous conduct. <HI>The
fear of the Lord</HI> is said to be <HI>the beginning
of wisdom:</HI> And by this fear of the Lord
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
men are said to <HI>depart from evil; to walk
in the way of good men, and to keep the path
of the righteous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. ii. 20.</NOTE>. Man is then regulated by
the <HI>wisdom which is from above,</HI> when he is
formed by piety to the duties of virtue and
morality; and of the wisdom which pro∣duces
this effect, it is asserted in the text,
that it <HI>bringeth us to honour.</HI></P>
<P>On this recommendation of religion it
is the more necessary to fix our attention,
because it is often refused to it by men of
the world. Their notions of honour are
apt to run in a very different channel.
Wherever religion is mentioned, they con∣nect
with it ideas of melancholy and de∣jection,
or of mean and feeble spirits. They
perhaps admit that it may be useful to the
multitude, as a principle of restraint from
disorders and crimes; and that to persons
of peculiar turn of mind, it may afford
consolation under the distresses of life. But
from the active scenes of the world, and
from those vigorous exertions which dis∣play
to advantage the human abilities, they
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
incline totally to exclude it. It may sooth
the timid, or the sad: But they consider it
as having no connection with what is pro∣per
to raise men to honour and distinction.
I shall now endeavour to remove this re∣proach
from religion; and to show that in
every situation of human life, even in the
highest stations, it forms the honour, as
well as the happiness of man.</P>
<P>But first, let us be careful to ascertain
what true religion is. I admit that there
is a certain species of religion (if we can
give it that name) which has no claim to
such high distinction; when it is placed
wholly in speculation and belief, in the re∣gularity
of external homage, or in fiery
zeal about contested opinions. From a su∣perstition
inherent in the human mind, the
religion of the multitude has always been
tinctured with too much of this spirit.
They serve God as they would serve a
proud master, who may be flattered by
their prostrations, appeased by their gifts,
and gained by loud protestations of attach∣ment
to his interests, and of enmity to all
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
whom they suppose to be his foes. But
this is not that <HI>wisdom</HI> to which Solomon
ascribes, in the text, such high preroga∣tives.
It is not the religion which we
preach, nor the religion of Christ. That
religion consists in the love of God and
the love of man, grounded on faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer of
the world, the Intercessor for the penitent,
and the Patron of the virtuous; through
whom we enjoy comfortable access to the
Sovereign of the universe in the acts of
worship and devotion. It consists in ju∣stice,
humanity, and mercy; in a fair and
candid mind, a generous and affectionate
heart; accompanied with temperance, self∣government,
and a perpetual regard in all
our actions to conscience, and to the law
of God. A religious, and a thoroughly
virtuous character, therefore, I consider as
the same.</P>
<P>By the true honour of man is to be un∣derstood,
not what merely commands ex∣ternal
respect, but what commands the re∣spect
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
of the heart; what raises one to ac∣knowledged
eminence above others of the
same species; what always creates esteem,
and in its highest degree, produces vene∣ration.
The question now before us is,
from what cause this eminence arises? By
what means is it to be attained?</P>
<P>I SAY, first, from riches it does not arise.
These, we all know, may belong to the
vilest of mankind. Providence has scatter∣ed
them among the crowd with an undis∣tinguishing
hand, as of purpose to show of
what small account they are in the sight
of God. Experience every day proves that
the possession of them is consistent with
the most general contempt. On this point
therefore I conceive it not necessary to in∣sist
any longer.</P>
<P>NEITHER does the honour of man arise
from mere dignity of rank or office. Were
such distinctions always, or even generally,
obtained in consequence of uncommon me∣rit,
they would indeed confer honour on
the character. But, in the present state of
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
society, is too well known that this is
not the case. They are often the cose∣quence
of birth alone. They are some∣times
the fruit of mere dependence and
assiduity. They may be the recompence
of flattery, versatility, and intrigue; and
so be conjoined with meanness and base∣ness
of character. To persons graced with
noble birth, or placed in high stations,
much external honour is due. This is
what the subordination of society necessa∣rily
requires; and what every good mem∣ber
of it will chearfully yield. But how
often has it happened that such persons,
when externally respected, are, neverthe∣less,
despised by men in their hearts; nay,
sometimes execrated by the public? Their
elevation, if they have been unworthy of
it, is so far from procuring them true ho∣nour,
that it only renders their insignifi∣cance,
perhaps their infamy, more conspi∣cuous.
By drawing attention to their con∣duct,
it discovers in the most glaring light
how little they deserved the station which
they posses.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17"/>
I MUST next observe, that the proper ho∣nour
of man arises not from some of those
splendid actions and abilities which excite
high admiration. Courage and prowess,
military renown, signal victories and con∣quests,
may render the name of a man fa∣mous,
without rendering his character tru∣ly
honourable. To many brave men, to
many heroes renowned in story, we look
up with wonder. Their exploits are re∣corded.
Their praises are sung. They stand
as on an eminence above the rest of man∣kind.
Their eminence, nevertheless, may
not be of that sort before which we bow
with inward esteem and respect. Some∣thing
more is wanted for that purpose, than
the conquering arm, and the intrepid mind.
The laurels of the warrior must at all times
be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the
tears of the widow and the orphan. But
if they have been stained by rapine and in∣humanity;
if sordid avarice has marked his
character; or low and gross sensuality has
degraded his life; the great hero sinks into
a little man. What at a distance, or on a
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
superficial view, we admired, becomes mean,
perhaps odious, when we examine it more
closely. It is like the Colossal statue, whose
immense size struck the spectator afar off
with astonishment; but when nearly view∣ed,
it appears disproportioned, unshapely,
and rude.</P>
<P>Observations of the same kind may be
applied to all the reputation derived from
civil accomplishments; from the refined
politics of the statesman; or the literary
efforts of genius and erudition. These be∣stow,
and, within certain bounds, ought
to bestow, eminence and distinction on
men. They discover talents which in them∣selves
are shining; and which become high∣ly
valuable, when employed in advancing
the good of mankind. Hence, they fre∣quently
give rise to fame. But a distinc∣tion
is to be made between fame and true
honour. The former is a loud and noisy
applause: The latter, a more silent and in∣ternal
homage. Fame floats on the breath
of the multitude: Honour rests on the
judgement of the thinking. Fame may
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
give praise while it with-holds esteem:
True honour implies esteem mingled with
respect. The one regards particular distin∣guished
talents: the other looks up to the
whole character. Hence the statesman, the
orator, or the poet, may be famous; while
yet the man himself is far from being ho∣noured.
We envy his abilities. We wish
to rival them. But we would not chuse to
be classed with him who possessed them.
Instances of this sort are too often found in
every record of ancient or modern history.</P>
<P>FROM all this it follows, that in order to
discern where man's true honour lies, we
must look, not to any adventitious circum∣stance
of fortune; not to any single sparkling
quality; but to the whole of what forms
a man; what intitles him, as such, to rank
high among that class of beings to which
he belongs; in word, we must look to
the mind and the soul.—A mind superior
to fear, to selfish interest and corruption;
a mind governed by the principles of uni∣form
rectitude and integrity; the same in
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
prosperity and adversity; which no bribe
can seduce, nor terror overawe: neither by
pleasure melted into effeminancy, nor by
distress sunk into dejection; such is the
mind which forms the distinction and emi∣nence
of man.—One, who in no situa∣tion
of life is either ashamed or afraid of
discharging his duty, and acting his proper
part with firmness and constancy; true to
the God whom he worships, and true to
the faith in which he professes to believe;
full of affection to his brethren of man∣kind;
faithful to his friends, generous to
his enemies, warm with compassion to the
unfortunate; self-denying to little private
interests and pleasures, but zealous for pub∣lic
interest and happiness; magnanimous,
without being proud; humble, without be∣ing
mean; just, without being harsh; sim∣ple
in his manners, but manly in his feel∣ings;
on whose word you can entirely re∣ly;
whose countenance never deceives you;
whose professions of kindness are the effu∣sions
of his heart: one, in fine, whom in∣dependent
of any views of advantage, you
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
would chuse for a superior, could trust in
as a friend, and could love as a brother:
—This is the man, whom in your heart,
above all others, you do, you must, ho∣nour.</P>
<P>SUCH a character, imperfectly as it has
now been drawn, all must acknowledge to
be formed solely by the influence of steady
religion and virtue. it is the effect of prin∣ciples
which, operating on conscience, de∣termine
it uniformly to pursue <HI>whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things
are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, what∣soever
things are of good report, if there be
any virtue, and if there be any praise.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. iv. 8.</NOTE> By
these means, <HI>wisdom,</HI> as the text asserts,
<HI>bringeth us to honour.</HI></P>
<P>In confirmation of this doctrine it is to
be observed, that the honour which man
acquires by religion and virtue is more in∣dependent,
and more complete, than what
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
can be acquired by any other means. It is
independent of any thing foreign or exter∣nal.
It is not partial, but entire respect,
which it procures. Wherever fortune is
concerned, it is the station or rank which
commands our deference. Where some shi∣ning
quality attracts admiration, it is only
to a part of the character that we pay ho∣mage.
But when a person is distinguished
for eminent worth and goodness, it is the
man, the whole man, whom we respect.
The honour which he possesses is intrinsic.
Place him in any situation of life, even an
obscure one; let room only be given for
his virtues to come forth and show them∣selves,
and you will revere him; as a pri∣vate
citizen; or as the father of a family.
If in higher life he appear more illustrious,
this is not owing merely to the respect crea∣ted
by rank. It is, because there a nobler
sphere of action is opened to him; because
his virtues are brought forth into more ex∣tended
exertion; and placed in such con∣spicuous
view, that he appears to grace
and adorn the station which he fills. Even
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
in the silence of retirement, or in the re∣treat
of old age, such a man sinks not in∣to
forgotten obscurity. His remembered
virtues continue to be honoured, when their
active exertions are over; and to the last
stage of life he is followed by public esteem
and respect. Whereas, if genuine worth
be wanting, the applause which may have
attended a man for a while, by degrees dies
away. Though, for a part of his life, he
had dazzled the world, this was owing to
his deficiency in the essentail qualities ha∣ving
not been suspected. As soon as the
imposture is discovered, the falling star
sinks in darkness.—There is therefore a
standard of independent, intrinsic worth,
to which we must bring in the end what∣ever
claims to be honourable among men.
By this we must measure it; and it will al∣ways
be found, that nothing but what is
essential to man has power to command the
respect of man's heart.</P>
<P>IT is to be farther observed, that the
universal consent of mankind in honouring
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
real virtue, is sufficient to show what the
genuine sense of human nature is on this
subject. All other claims of honour are
ambulatory and changeable. The degrees
of respect paid to external stations vary with
forms of government, and fashions of the
times. Qualities which in one country are
highly honoured, in another are lightly
esteemed. Nay, what in some regions of
the earth distinguishes a man above others,
might elsewhere expose him to contempt or
ridicule. But where was ever the nation
on the face of the globe, who did not ho∣nour
unblemished worth, unaffected piety,
stedfast, humane, and regular virtue? To
whom were altars erected in the Heathen
world but to those who by their merits and
heroic labours, by their invention of useful
arts, or by some signal acts of beneficence
to their country, or to mankind, were
found worthy, in their opinion, to be trans∣ferred
from among men, and added to the
number of the gods?—Even the coun∣terfeited
appearances of virtue, which are
so often found in the world, are testimo∣nies
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
to its praise. The hypocrite knows
that, without assuming the garb of virtue,
every other advantage he can possess is in∣sufficient
to procure him esteem. Interfe∣rence
of interest, or perverfity of disposi∣tion,
may occasionally lead individuals to
oppose, even to hate, the upright and the
good. But however the characters of such
persons may be mistaken, or misrepresent∣ed,
yet, as far as they are acknowledged to
be virtuous, the profligate dare not traduce
them. Genuine virtue has a language that
speaks to every heart throughout the world.
It is a language which is understood by all.
In every region, every clime, the homage
paid to it is the same. In no one senti∣ment
were ever mankind more generally a∣greed.</P>
<P>FINALLY, the honour acquired by reli∣gion
and virtue is honour divine and im∣mortal.
It is honour, not in the estima∣tion
of men only, but in the sight of God;
whose judgement is the standard of truth
and right; whose approbation confers a
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
<HI>crown of glory that fadeth not away.</HI> All
the honour we can gain among men is li∣mited
and confined. Its circle is narrow.
Its duration is short and transitory. But
the honour which is founded on true good∣ness,
accompanies us through the whole
progress of our existence. It enters with
man into a future state; and continues to
brighten throughout eternal ages. What
procured him respect on earth, shall ren∣der
him estimable among the great assem∣bly
of angels, and <HI>spirits of just men made
perfect;</HI> where, we are assured, they who
have been eminent in righteousness shall
<HI>shine as the brightness of the firmament, and
as the stars fir ever and ever.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel xii. 3.</NOTE>.—Earthly
honours are both shortlived in their con∣tinuance,
and, while they last, tarnished
with spots and, stains. On some quarter
or other, their brightness is obscured; their
exaltation is humbled. But the honour
which proceeds from God, and virtue, is
unmixed and pure. It is a lustre which is
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
derived from heaven; and is likened, in
scripture, to <HI>the light of the morning, when
the sun riseth; even a morning without clouds;</HI>
to <HI>the light which shineth more and more unto
the perfect day.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii. 4.; Prov. iv. 18.</NOTE> Whereas the honours
which the world confers resemble the feeble
and twinkling flame of a taper; which is
often clouded by the smoke it sends forth;
is always wasting; and soon dies totally
away.</P>
<P>LET him, therefore, who retains any sense
of human dignity; who feels within him
that desire of honour which is congenial to
man, aspire to the gratification of this pas∣sion
by methods which are worthy of his
nature. Let him not rest on any of those
external distinctions which vanity has con∣trived
to introduce. These can procure
him no more than the semblance of re∣spect.
Let him not be flattered by the ap∣plause
which some occasional display of a∣bilities
may have gained him. That ap∣plause
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
may be mingled with contempt.
Let him look to what will dignify his
character as a man. Let him cultivate
those moral qualities which all men in
their hearts respect. <HI>Wisdom</HI> shall then <HI>give
to his head an ornament of grace; a crown
of glory shall she deliver to him.</HI> This is an
honour to which all may aspire. It is a
prize, for which every one, whether of
high or low rank, may contend. It is al∣ways
in his power so to distinguish, him∣self
by worthy and virtuous conduct, as to
command the respect of those around him;
and, what is highest of all, to obtain praise
and honour from God.</P>
<P>LET non one imagine that in the reli∣gious
part of this character there is any
thing which casts over it a gloomy shade,
or derogates from that esteem which men
are generally disposed to yield to exemplary
virtues. False ideas may be entertained of
religion; as false and imperfect conceptions
of virtue have often prevailed in the world.
But to true religion there belongs no sul∣len
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
gloom; no melancholy austerity, tend∣ing
to withdraw men from human society,
or to diminish the exertions of active vir∣tue.
On the contrary, the religious prin∣ciple,
rightly understood, not only unites
with all such virtues, but supports, forti∣fies,
and confirms them. It is so far from
obscuring the lustre of a character, that it
heightens and ennobles it. It adds to all
the moral virtues a venerable and autho∣ritative
dignity. It renders the virtuous
character more august. To the decorations
of a palace, it joins the majesty of a tem∣ple.</P>
<P>He who divides religion from virtue,
understands neither the one, nor the other.
It is the union of the two which consum∣mates
the human character and state. It
is their union which has distinguished those
great and illustrious men, who have shone
with so much honour in former ages; and
whose memory lives in the remembrance
of succeeding generations. It is their u∣nion
which forms that <HI>wisdom which is
from above;</HI> that wisdom to which the text
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
ascribes such high effects; and to which
belongs the sublime encomium given of it
by an author of one of the apocryphal
books of Scripture; with whose beautiful
and emphatical expressions I conclude this
discourse. The memorial of virtue is immor∣tal.
It is known with God, and with men.
When it is present, men take example at it;
and when it is gone, they desire it. it wear∣eth
a crown, and triumpheth for ever; ha∣ving
gotten the victory; striving for undefiled
rewards. Wisdom is the breath of the power
of God; and a pure influence flowing from the
glory of the Almighty. Therefore can no de∣filed
thing fall into her. She is the bright∣ness
of the everlasting light; the unspotted
mirror of the power of God; and the image
of his goodness. Remaining in herself, she
maketh all things new; and in all ages, en∣tering
into holy souls, she maketh them friends
of God, and prophets: For God loveth none
but him that dwelleth with wisdom. She is
more beautiful than the sun; and above all the
order of the stars. Being compared with light,
she is found before it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom of Solomon, iv. 2. 3.—vii. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE amiable spirit of our holy reli∣gion
appears in nothing more than in
the care it hath taken to enforce on men
the social duties of life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II.</NOTE> This is one of the
clearest characteristics of its being a reli∣gion
whose origin is divine: For every doc∣trine
which proceeds from the Father of
mercies will undoubtedly breathe benevo∣lence
and humanity. This is the scope of
the two exhortations in the text, <HI>to rejoice
with them that rejoice, and to weep with them
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
that weep;</HI> the one calculated to promote
the happiness, the other, to alleviate the
sorrows of our fellow-creature; both con∣curring
to form that temper which interests
us in the concerns of our brethren; which
disposes us to feel along with them, to take
part in their joys, and in their sorrows.
This temper is known by the name of Sen∣sibility;
a word, which in modern times
we hear in the mouth of every one; a qua∣lity,
which every one affects to possess; in
itself, a most amiable and worthy disposi∣tion
of mind; but often mistaken and ab∣used;
employed as a cover, sometimes, to
capricious humour; sometimes, to selfish
passions. I shall endeavour to explain the
nature of true sensibility. I shall consider
its effects: and after showing its advanta∣ges,
shall point out the abuses, and mista∣ken
forms of this virtue.</P>
<P>THE original constitution of our nature
with respect to the mixture of selfish and
social affections, discovers in this, as in eve∣ry
other part of our frame, profound and
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
admirable wisdom. Each individual is, by
his Creator, committed particularly to him∣self,
and his own car. He has it more in
his power to promote his own welfare, than
any other person can possibly have to pro∣mote
it. It was therefore fit, it was neces∣sary,
that in each individual self-love should
be the strongest and most active instinct.
This self-love, if he had been a being who
stood solitary and alone, might have pro∣ved
sufficient for the purpose both of his
preseveration, and his welfare. But such is
not the situation of man. He is mixed a∣mong
multitudes of the same nature. In
these multitudes, the self-love of one man,
or attention to his particular interest, en∣countering
the self-love and the interests of
another, could not but produce frequent
opposition, and innumerable mischiefs. It
was necessary, therefore, to provide a coun∣terbalance
to this part of his nature; which
is accordingly done, by implanting in him
those social and benevolent instincts which
lead him in some measure out of himself, to
follow the interest of others. The strength
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
of these social instincts is, in general, pro∣portioned
to their importance in human
life. Hence that degree of sensibility which
prompts us to <HI>weep with them that weep,</HI> is
stronger than that which prompts us to <HI>re∣joice
with them that rejoice;</HI> for this reason,
that the unhappy stand more in need of
our fellow-feeling and assistance than the
prosperous. Still however it was requisite,
that in each individual the quantity of self∣love
should remain in a large proportion,
on account of its importance to the preser∣vation
of his life and well-being. But as the
quantity requisite for this purpose is apt both
to ingross his attention, and to carry him
into criminal excesses, the perfection of his
nature is measured by the due counterpoise
of those social principles which, tempering
the force of the selfish affection, render
man equally useful to himself, and to those
with whom he is joined in society. Hence
the use and the value of that sensibility of
which we now treat.</P>
<P>THAT it constitutes an essential part of a
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
religious character, there can be no doubt.
Not only are the words of the text express
to this purpose, but the whole New Testa∣ment
abounds with passages which enjoin
the cultivation of this disposition. Being
<HI>all one body, and members one of another,</HI> we
are commanded to <HI>love our neighbour as our∣self;
to look every man not on his own things
only, but on those of others also; to be pitif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d,
to be courteous, to be tender-hearted; to bear
one another's burdens, and so to fulfil the law
of Christ.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, x. 27.; Philip. ii. 4.; 1 Peter, iii. 8.; Ephes. iv. 23.; Galat. vi. z.</NOTE> The dispositions opposite to
sensibility are, cruelty, hardness of heart,
contracted attachment to worldly interests;
which every one will admit to be directly
opposite to the Christian character. Accor∣ding
to the different degrees of constitutio∣nal
warmth in men's affections, sensibility
may, even among the virtuous, prevail in
different proportions. For all derive not
from nature the same happy delicacy, and
tenderness of feeling. With some, the heart
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
melts, and relents, in kind emotions, much
more easily than with others. But with
every one who aspires to the character of a
good man, it is necessary that the humane
and compassionate dispositions should be
found. There must be that within him
which shall form him to feel in some degree
with the heart of a brother; and when he
beholds others enjoying happiness, or sees
them sunk in sorrow, shall bring his af∣fections
to accord, and, if we may speak
so, it found a note unison to theirs. This
is to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice, and
to weep with them that weep.</HI> How much
this temper belongs to the perfection of
our nature, we learn from one who exhi∣bited
that perfection in its highest degree.
When our Lord Jesus, on a certain occa∣sion,
came to the grave of a beloved friend,
and saw his relations mourning around it,
he presently caught the impression of their
sorrow; <HI>he groaned in spirit, and was trou∣bled.</HI>
He knew that he was about to re∣move
the cause of their distress, by re∣calling
Lazarus to life: Yet, in the mo∣ment
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
of grief, his heart sympathised with
theirs; and, together with the weeping
friends, <HI>Jesus wept.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, ii. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>LET us next proceed to consider the ef∣fect
of this virtuous sensibility on our cha∣racter,
and our state. I shall consider it in
two views; its influence on our moral con∣duct,
and its influence on our happiness.</P>
<P>FIRST, it powerfully influences the proper
discharge of all the relative and social du∣ties
of life. Without some discharge of
those duties there could be no comfort or
security in human society. Men would
become hordes of savages, perpetually ha∣rassing
one another. In one way or other,
therefore, the great duties of social life must
be performed. There must be among man∣kind
some reciprocal co-operation and aid.
In this all consent. But let us observe,
that these duties may be performed from
different principles, and in different ways.
Sometimes they are performed merely from
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
decency and regard to character; some∣times
from fear, and even from selfishness,
which obliges men to show kindness, in or∣der
that they may receive returns of it. In
such cases, the exterior of fair behaviour
may be preserved. But all will admit, that
when from constraint only, the offices of
seeming kindness are performed, little de∣pendance
can be placed on them, and little
value allowed to them.</P>
<P>By others, these offices are discharged
solely from a principle of duty. They are
men of cold affections, and perhaps of an
interested character. But, overawed by a
sense of religion, and convinced that they
are bound to be beneficent, they fulfil the
course of relative duties with regular tenor.
Such men act from conscience and prin∣ciple.
So far they do well, and are wor∣thy
of praise. They assist their friends;
they give to the poor; they do justice to
all. But what a different complexion is
given to the same actions, how much high∣er
flavour do they acquire, when they flow
from the sensibility of a feeling heart? If
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
one be not moved by affection, even sup∣posing
him influenced by principle, he
will go no farther than strict principle
appears to require. He will advance slow∣ly,
and reluctantly. As it is justice, not
generosity, which impells him, he will of∣ten
feel as a task what he is required by
conscience to perform. Whereas, to him
who is prompted by virtuous sensibility,
every office of beneficence and humanity
is a pleasure. He gives, assists, and relives,
not merely because he is bound to do so,
but because it would be painful for him
to refrain. Hence, the smallest benefit he
confers rises in its value, on account of its
carrying the affection of the giver impress∣ed
upon the gift. It speaks his heart; and
the discovery of the heart is very frequent∣ly
of greater consequence than all that li∣berality
can bestow. How often will the
affectionate smile of approbation gladden
the humble, and raise the dejected? How
often will the look of tender sympathy, or
the tear that involuntarily falls, impart con∣solation
to the unhappy? By means of this
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
correspondence of hearts, all the great du∣ties
which we owe to one another are both
performed to more advantage, and endear∣ed
in the performance. From true sensibi∣lity
flow a thousand good offices, apparent∣ly
small in themselves, but of high impor∣tance
to the felicity of others; offices which
altogether escape the observation of the cold
and unfeeling, who, by the hardness of
their manner, render themselves unamiable,
even when they mean to do good.—How
happy then would it be for mankind, if this
affectionate disposition prevailed more ge∣nerally
in the world! How much would
the sum of public virtue and public felicity
be increased, if men were always inclined
to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep
with them that weep!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, besides the effect of such a temper
on general virtue and happiness, let us con∣sider
its effect on the happiness of him who
possesses it, and the various pleasure to
which it gives him access. If he be ma∣ster
of riches or influence, it affords him
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
the means of increasing his own enjoy∣ment,
by relieving the wants, or increa∣sing
the comforts of others. If he com∣mand
not these advantages, yet all the
comforts which he sees in the possession of
the deserving become in some sorts his, by
his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy.
Even the face of nature yields a satisfac∣tion
to him which the insensible can never
know. The profusion of goodness which
he beholds poured forth on the universe,
dilates his heart with the thought that in∣numerable
multitudes around him are blest
and happy. When he sees the labours of
men appearing to prosper, and views a
country flourishing in wealth and indus∣try;
when he beholds the spring coming
forth in its beauty, and reviving the de∣cayed
face of nature; or in autumn be∣holds
the fields loaded with plenty, and
the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts
his affections with gratitude to the great
Father of all, and rejoices in the general
felicity and joy.</P>
<P>It may indeed be objected, that the same
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
sensibility lays open the heart to be pier∣ced
with many wounds from the distresses
which abound in the world; exposes us to
frequent suffering from the participation
which it communicates of the sorrows, as
well as of the joys of friendship. But let
it be considered, that the tender melancho∣ly
of sympathy is accompanied with a sen∣sation,
which they who feel it would not
exchange for the gratifications of the sel∣fish.
When the heart is strongly moved
by any of the kind affections, even when
it pours itself forth in virtuous sorrow, a
secret attractive charm mingles with the
painful emotion; there is a joy in the
midst of grief. Let it be farther consider∣ed,
that the griefs which sensibility intro∣duces
are counterbalanced by pleasures
which flow from the same source. Sensibi∣lity
heightens in general the human pow∣ers,
and is connected with acuteness in all
our feelings. If it make us more alive to
some painful sensations, in return, it ren∣ders
the pleasing ones more vivid and a∣nimated.
The selfish man languishes in
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
his narrow circle of pleasures. They are
confined to what affects his own interest.
He is obliged to repeat the same gratifica∣tions,
till they become insipid. But the
man of virtuous sensibility moves in a wi∣der
sphere of felicity. His powers are much
more frequently called forth into occupa∣tions
of pleasing activity. Numberless oc∣casions
open to him of indulging his fa∣vourite
taste, by conveying satisfaction to
others. Often it is in his power, in one way
or other, to sooth the afflicted heart; to
carry some consolation into the house of
woe. In the scenes of ordinary life, in the
domestic and social intercourses of men,
the cordiality of his affections chears and
gladdens him. Every appearance, every
description of innocent happiness, is enjoy∣ed
by him. Every native expression of
kindness and affection among others is felt
by him, even though he be not the object
of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying
one another, he is as happy as the happiest.
In a word, he lives in a different sort of
world from what the selfish man inhabits.
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
He possesses a new sense, which enables
him to behold objects which the selfish
cannot see. At the same time, his enjoy∣ments
are not of that kind which remain
merely on the surface of the mind. They
penetrate the heart. They enlarge and e∣levate,
they refine and ennoble it. To all
the pleasing emotions of affection, they add
the dignified consciousness of virtue.—
Children of men! Men formed by nature
to live and to feel as brethren! How long
will ye continue to estrange yourselves from
one another by competitions and jealou∣sies,
when in cordial union ye might be so
much more blest? How long will ye seek
your happiness in selfish gratifications a∣lone,
neglecting those purer and better
sources of joy, which flow from the affec∣tions
and the heart?</P>
<P>HAVING now explained the nature, and
shown the value and high advantages of
true sensibility, I proceed to point out some
of the mistaken forms, and abuses of this
virtue.—In modern times, the chief im∣provement
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
of which we have to boast, is a
sense of humanity. This, notwithstanding
the selfishness that still prevails, is the fa∣vourite
and distinguishing virtue of the age.
On general manners, and on several depart∣ments
of society, it has had considerable
influence. It has abated the spirit of per∣secution:
It has even tempered the horrors
of war; and man is now more ashamed than
he was in some former ages, of acting as a
savage to man. Hence, sensibility is be∣come
so reputable a quality, that the ap∣pearance
of it is frequently assumed when
the reality is wanting. Softness of man∣ners
must not be mistaken for true sensi∣bility.
Sensibility indeed tends to produce
gentleness in behaviour; and when such
behaviour flows from native affection, it is
valuable and amiable. But the exterior
manner alone may be learned in the school
of the world; and often, too often, is found
to cover much unfeeling hardness of heart.
Professions of sensibility on every trifling
occasion, joined with the appearance of ex∣cessive
softness, and a profusion of senti∣mental
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
language, afford always much
ground for distrust. They create the sus∣picion
of a studied character. Frequently,
under a negligent and seemingly rough
manner, there lies a tender and feeling
heart. Manliness and sensibility are so far
from being incompatible, that the truly
brave are, for the most part, generous and
humane; while the soft and effeminate are
hardly capable of any vigorous exertion of
affection.</P>
<P>As sensibility supposes delicacy of feel∣ing
with respect to others, they who af∣fect
the highest sensibility are apt to carry
this delicacy to excess. They are, perhaps,
not incapable of the warmth of disinterest∣ed
friendship; but they are become so re∣fined
in all their sensations; they enter∣tain
such high notions of what ought to
correspond in the feelings of others to their
own; they are so mightily hurt by every
thing which comes not up top their ideal
standard of reciprocal affection, as to pro∣duce
disquiet and uneasiness to all with
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
whom they are connected. Hence, unjust
suspicions of their friends hence, ground∣less
upbraidings, and complaints of un∣kindness;
hence, a proneness to take vio∣lent
offence at trifles. In consequence of
examining their friends with a microsco∣pic
eye, what to an ordinary observer
would not be unpleasing, to them is gra∣ting
and disgusting. At the bottom of the
character of such persons there always lie
much pride, and attention to themselves.
This is indeed a false species of sensibility.
It is the substitution of a capricious and
irritable delicacy, in the room of that plain
and native tenderness of heart, which
prompts men to view others with indul∣gent
eye, and to make great allowances for
the imperfections which are sometimes ad∣herent
to the most amiable qualities.</P>
<P>THERE are others who affect not sensi∣bility
to this extreme, but who found
high claims to themselves upon the degree
of interest which they take in the concerns
of others. Although their sensibility can
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
produce no benefit to the person who is
its object, they always conceive that it in∣titles
themselves to some profitable returns.
These, often, are persons of refined and art∣ful
character; who partly deceive them∣selves,
and partly employ their sensibility
as a cover to interest. He who acts from
genuine affection, when he is feeling along
with others in their joys or sorrows, thinks
not of any recompence to which this gives
him a title. He follows the impulse of his
heart. He obeys the dictate of his nature;
just as the vine by its nature produces
fruit, and the fountain pours forth its
streams. Wherever views of interest, and
prospects of return, mingle with the feel∣ings
of affection, sensibility acts an imper∣fect
part, and intitles us to small share of
praise.</P>
<P>BUT supposing it to be both complete
and pure, I must caution you against rest∣ing
the whole merit of your character on
sensibility alone. It is indeed a happy con∣stitution
of mind. It fits men for the pro∣per
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
discharge of many duties, and gives
them access to many virtuous pleasures.
It is requisite for our acceptance either
with God or man. At the same time, if
it remain an instinctive feeling alone, it
will form no more than an imperfect cha∣racter.
Complete virtue is of a more ex∣alted
and dignified nature. It supposes
sensibility, good temper, and benevolent
affections it includes them as essential
parts; but it reaches farther: It supposes
them to be strengthened and confirmed by
principle; it requires them to be support∣ed
by justice, temperance, fortitude, and
all those other virtues which enable us to
act with propriety, in the trying situations
of life.</P>
<P>It is very possible for a man to possess
the kind affections in a high degree, while,
at the same time, he is carried away by
passion and pleasure into many criminal
deeds. Almost every man values himself
on possessing virtue in one or other of its
forms. He wishes to lay claim to some
quality which will render him estimable
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
in his own eye, as well as in that of the
public. Hence, it is common for many,
especially for those in the higher classes of
life, to take much praise to themselves on
account of their sensibility, though it be, in
truth, a sensibility of very defective kind.
They relent at the view of misery when it is
strongly set before them. Often too, affected
chiefly by the powers of description, it is at
feigned and pictured distress, more than at
real misery, that they relent. The tears which
they shed upon these occasions they consider
as undoubted proofs of virtue. They applaud
themselves for the goodness of their hearts;
and conclude, that with such feelings they
cannot fail to be agreeable to Heaven. At
the same time, these transient relentings
make flight impression on conduct. They
give rise to few, if any, good deeds; and
soon after such persons have wept at some
tragical tale, they are ready to stretch forth
the hand of oppression, to grasp at the gain
of injustice, or to plunge into the torrent
of criminal pleasures. This sort of sensi∣bility
affords no more than a fallacious
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
claim to virtue, and gives men no ground
to think highly of themselves. We must
inquire not merely how they feel, but how
their feelings prompt them to act, in order
to ascertain their real character.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with observing, that
sensibility, when genuine and pure, has a
strong connection with piety. That warmth
of affection, and tenderness of heart, which
lead men to feel for their brethren, and to
enter into their joys and sorrows, should
naturally dispose them to melt at the re∣membrance
of the divine goodness; to
glow with admiration of the divine ma∣jesty;
to send up the voice of praise and
adoration to that Supreme Being who
makes his creatures happy. He who pre∣tends
to great sensibility towards men, and
yet has no feeling for the high objects of
religion, no heart to admire and adore the
great Father of the universe, has reason to
distrust the truth and delicacy of his sensi∣bility.
He has reason to suspect, that in
some corner of his heart there lodges a se∣cret
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
depravity, an unnatural hardness and
callousness, which vitiates his character.
—Let us study to join all the parts of
virtue in proper union; to be consistently
and uniformly good; just and upright, as
well as pitiful and courteous; pious, as
well as sympathising. Let us pray to him
who made the heart, that he would fill it
with all proper dispositions; rectify all its
errors; and render it the happy abode of
personal integrity and social tenderness, of
purity, benevolence, and devotion.</P>

<P>TIME is of so great importance to man∣kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE>
that it cannot too often employ
religious meditation. There is nothing in
the management of which wisdom is more

inconsistency more. In its particular par∣cels,
they appear entirely careless of it; and
throw it away with thoughtless profusion.
But, when collected into some of its great
portions, and viewed as the measure of
their continuance in life, they become sen∣sible
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
of its value, and begin to regard it
with a serious eye. While day after day is
wasted in a course of idleness or vicious
pleasures, if some incident shall occur
which leads the most inconsiderate man to
think of his age, or time of life; how
much of it is gone; at what period of it he
is now arrived; and to what proportion of
it he can with any probability look for∣ward,
as yet to come; he can hardly avoid
feeling some secret compunction, and re∣flecting
seriously upon his state. Happy,
if that virtuous impression were not of mo∣mentary
continuance, but retained its in∣fluence
amidst the succeeding cares and
pleasures of the world! To the good old
Patriarch mentioned in the text, we have
reason to believe that such impressions
were habitual. The question put to him
by the Egyptian monarch produced, in his
answer, such reflections as were naturally
suited to his time of life. <HI>And Jacob said
unto Pharoah, the days of the years of my pil∣grimage

few and evil have the days of the years of my

upon our age, whether we be young, or
advanced in years; in order that the que∣stion,

to any of us without some good effect.
There are three different portions of our
life which such a question naturally calls to

which is now present; and that to which
we fondly look forward, as future. Let
us consider in what manner we ought to

<P>I. LET us review that part of our time

which we have made in the journey of life,
the field which past years present to our re∣view
will be more or less extensive. But

to every one they will be found to afford

For where is the person, who having acted
for any time in the world, remembers not
many errors, and many follies, in his past
behaviour? Who dares to say, that he has
improved, as he might have done, the va∣rious
advantages which were afforded him;
and that he recalls nothing for which he
has reason either to grieve, or to blush?
When we recollect the several stages of life
through which we have passed; the succes∣sive
occupations in which we have been
engaged, the designs we have formed, and
the hopes and fears which alternately have
filled our breast; how barren for most
part is the remembrance; and how few
traces of any thing valuable or important
remain? like characters drawn on the
sand, which the next wave washes totally
away, so one trivial succession of events has
effaced the memory of the preceding; and
though we have seemed all along to be bu∣sy,
yet for much of what we have acted,
we are neither wiser nor better than if such
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
actions had never been. Hence, let the re∣trospect
of what is past produce, as its first
effect, humiliation in our own eyes, and
abasement before God. Much do human
pride and self-complacency require some
correction; and that correction is never
more effectually administered, than by an
impartial and serious review of former life.</P>
<P>But though past time be gone, we are
not to consider it as irredeemably lost. To
a very profitable purpose it may yet be ap∣plied,
if we lay hold of it while it remains in
remembrance, and oblige it to contribute to
future improvement. If you have gained
nothing more by the years that are past,
you have at least gained experience; and
experience is the mother of wisdom. You
have seen the weak parts of your character;
and may have discovered the chief sources of
your misconduct. To these let your atten∣tion
be directed; on these, let the proper
guards be set. If you have trifled long,
resolve to trifle no more. If your passions
have often betrayed and degraded you,
study how they may be kept, in future,
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
under better discipline. Learn, at the same
time, never to trust presumptuously in your
own wisdom. Humbly apply to the Au∣thor
of your being, and beseech his grace
to guide you safely through those slippery
and dangerous paths, in which experience
has shown that you are so ready to err, and
to fall.</P>
<P>In reviewing past life, it cannot but oc∣cur,
that many things now appear of in∣considerable
importance, which once occu∣pied
and attached us, in the highest de∣gree.
Where are those keen competitions,
those mortifying disappointments, those
violent enmities, those eager pursuits, which
we once thought were to last for ever, and
on which we considered our whole happi∣ness
or misery as suspended? We look
back upon them now, as upon a dream
which has passed away. None of those
mighty consequences have followed which
we had predicted. The airy fabric has va∣nished,
and left no trace behind it. We
smile at our former violence; and wonder
how such things could have ever appeared
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
so significant and great. We may rest as∣sured,
that what hath been, shall again be.
When Time shall once have laid his lenient
hand on the passions and pursuits of the
present moment, they too shall lose that i∣maginary
value which heated fancy now
bestows upon them. Hence, let them al∣ready
begin to subside to their proper level.
Let wisdom infuse a tincture of moderation
into the eagerness of contest, by anticipa∣ting
that period of coolness, which the lapse
of time will, of itself, certainly bring.—
When we look back on years that are past,
how swiftly do they appear to have fleeted
away? How insensibly has one period of
life stolen upon us after another, like the
successive incidents in <HI>a tale that is told?</HI>
Before we were aware, childhood had grown
up into youth; youth had passed into man∣hood;
and manhood now, perhaps, begins
to assume the gray hair, and to decline in∣to
old age. When we are carrying our
views forward, months and years to come
seem to stretch thorough a long and exten∣sive
space. But when the time shall arrive
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
of our looking back, they shall appear con∣tracted
within narrow bounds. Time, when
yet before us, seems to advance with slow
and tardy steps; no sooner is it past, than
we discern its wings.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable peculiarity in the re∣trospect
of former life, that it is commonly
attended with some measure of heaviness of
heart. Even to the most prosperous, the
memory of joys that are past is accompa∣nied
with secret sorrow. In the days of
former years, many objects arise to view,
which make the most unthinking, grave;
and render the serious, sad. The pleasu∣rable
scenes of youth, the objects on which
our affections had been early placed, the
companions and friends with whom we had
spent many happy days, even the places
and the occupations to which we had been
long accustomed, but to which we have
now bid farewell, can hardly ever be re∣called,
without softening, nor sometimes,
without piercing, the heart. Such sensa∣tions,
to which few, if any, of my hearers,
are wholly strangers, I now mention, as
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
affording a strong proof of that vanity of
the human state, which is so often repre∣sented
in the sacred writings: And vain
indeed must that state be, where shades of
grief tinge the recollection of its brightest
scenes. But, at the same time, though it
be very proper that such meditations should
sometimes enter the mind, yet on them I
advise not the gentle and tender heart to
dwell too long. They are apt to produce a
fruitless melancholy; to deject, without
bringing much improvement; to thicken
the gloom which already hangs over hu∣man
life, without furnishing proportionable
assistance to virtue.</P>
<P>Let me advise you, rather to recall to view
such parts of former conduct, if any such
there be, as afford in the remembrance a
rational satisfaction. And what parts of
conduct are these? Are they the pursuits
of sensual pleasure, the riots of jollity or
the displays of show and vanity? No; I
appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what
you recollect with most pleasure be not the
innocent, the virtuous, the honourable parts
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
of your past life; when you were employ∣ed
in cultivating your minds, and impro∣ving
them with useful knowledge; when,
by regular application and persevering la∣bour,
you were laying the foundation of
future reputation and advancement; when
you were occupied in discharging with fi∣delity
the duties of your station, and ac∣quiring
the esteem of the worthy and the
good; when in some trying situation you
were enabled to act your part with firm∣ness
and honour; or had seized the happy
opportunity of assisting the deserving of
relieving the distressed, and bringing down
upon your heads the <HI>blessings of those that
were ready to perish.—</HI> These, these are the
parts of former life which are recalled with
most satisfaction! On them alone, no heavi∣ness
of heart attends. You enjoy them as a
treasure which is now stored up, and put
beyond all danger of being lost. These
chear the hours of sadness, lighten the bur∣den
of old age, and, through the mortify∣ing
remembrance of much of the past dart
a ray of light and joy.—From the review
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
of these, and the comparison of them with
the deceitful pleasures of sin, let us learn
how to form our estimate of happiness. Let
us learn what is true, what is false, in hu∣man
pleasures; and from experience of the
past, judge of the quarter to which we
must in future turn, if we would lay a
foundation for permanent satisfaction. Af∣ter
having thus reviewed the former years
of our life, let us consider,</P>
<P>II. WHAT attention is due to that period
of age in which we are at present placed.
Here lies the immediate and principal ob∣ject
of our concern. For the recollection
of the past is only as far of moment, as it
acts upon the present. The past, to us
now, is little; the future, as yet, is no∣thing.
Between these two great gulphs of
time subsists the present, as an isthmus or
bridge, along which we are all passing.
With hasty and inconsiderate steps let us
not pass along it; but remember well, how
much depends upon our holding a steady,
and properly conducted course. <HI>Whatso∣ever
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
ever thine hand findeth to do, do it now with
all thy might; for now is the accepted time;
now is the day of salvation.</HI> Many direc∣tions
might be given for the wise and reli∣gious
improvement of the present; a few
of which only I shall hint.</P>
<P>Let us begin with excluding those super∣fluous
avocations which unprofitably con∣sume
it. Life is short; much that is of
real importance remains to be done. If we
suffer the present time to be wasted either
in absolute idleness, or in frivolous em∣ployments,
it will hereafter call for ven∣geance
against us. Removing therefore
what is merely superfluous, let us bethink
ourselves of what is most material to be at∣tended
to at present: As, first and chief,
the great work of our salvation; the dis∣charge
of the religious duties which we
owe to God our Creator, and to Christ our
Redeemer. <HI>God waiteth</HI> as yet <HI>to be gra∣cious;</HI>
whether he will wait longer, none of
us can tell. Now, therefore, <HI>seek the Lord
while he may be found, call upon him while
be is near.</HI> Our spiritual interests will be
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
best promoted by regular performance of
all the duties of ordinary life. Let these,
therefore, occupy a great share of the pre∣sent
hour. Whatever our age, our charac∣ter,
our profession, or station in the world,
requires us to do, in that let each revolving
day find us busy. Never delay till to-mor∣row
what reason and conscience tell you
ought to be performed to-day. To-mor∣row
is not yours; and though you should
live to enjoy it, you must not overload it
with a burden not its own. <HI>Sufficient for
the day will prove the</HI> duty <HI>thereof.</HI></P>
<P>The observance of order and method, is
of high consequence for the improvement
of present time. He who performs every
employment in its due place and season,
suffers no part of time to escape without
profit. He multiplies his days; for he
lives much in little space. Whereas he who
neglects order in the arrangement of his
occupations, is always losing the present in
returning upon the past, and trying, in
vain, to recover it when gone.—Let me
advise you frequently to make the present
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
employment of time an object of thought.
Ask yourselves, about what are you now
busied? What is the ultimate scope of
your present pursuits and cares? Can you
justify them to yourselves? Are they like∣ly
to produce any thing that will survive
the moment, and bring forth some fruit
for futurity? He who can give no satis∣factory
answer to such questions as these,
has reason to suspect that his employment
of the present is not tending either to his
advantage, or his honour.—Finally let
me admonish you, that while you study to
improve, you should endeavour also to en∣joy,
the present hour. Let it not be dis∣turbed
with groundless discontents, or poi∣soned
with foolish anxieties about what is
to come: But look up to Heaven, and ac∣knowledge,
with a grateful heart, the actual
blessings you enjoy. If you must admit,
that you are now in health, peace and
safety; without any particular or uncom∣mon
evils to afflict your condition; what
more can you reasonably look for in this
vain and uncertain world? How little can
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
the greatest prosperity add to such a state?
Will any future situation ever make you
happy, if now, with so few causes of grief,
you imagine yourselves miserable? The
evil lies in the state of your mind, not in
your condition of fortune; and by no al∣teration
of circumstances is likely to be re∣medied.
Let us now,</P>
<P>III. CONSIDER with what dispositions
we ought to look forward to those years of
our life that may yet be to come. Merely
to look forward to them, is what requires
no admonition. Futurity is the great ob∣ject
on which the imaginations of men are
employed; for the sake of which the past
is forgotten, and the present too often ne∣glected.
All time is in a manner swallow∣ed
up by it. On futurity, men build their
designs; on futurity, they rest their hopes;
and though not happy at the present, they
always reckon on becoming so, at some
subsequent period of their lives. This pro∣pensity
to look forward, was for wise pur∣poses
implanted in the human breast. It
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
serves to give proper occupation to the active
powers of the mind, and to quicken all its
exertions. But it is too often imoderate∣ly
indulged, and gorssly abused. The cu∣riosity
which sometimes prompts persons to
inquire, by unlawful methods, into what
is to come, is equally foolish and sinful.
Let us restain all desire of penetrating far∣ther
than is allowed us, into that dark and
unknown region. Futurity belongs to God:
and happy for us is that mysterious veil
with which his wisdom has covered it.
Were it in our power to lift up the veil,
and to behold what it conceals, many and
many a thorn we would plant in our
breasts. The proper and rational conduct
of men with regard to futurity, is regulated
by two considerations: First, that much
of what it contains, must remain to us
absolutely unknown; next, that there are
also some events in it which may be cer∣tainly
known and foreseen.</P>
<P>First, much of futurity is, and must be,
entirely unknown to us. When we specu∣late
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
late about the continuance of our life, and
the events which are to fill it, we behold a
river which is always flowing; but which
soon escapes out of our sight, and is cover∣ed
with mists and darkness. Some of its
windings we may endeavour to trace; but
it is only for a very short way that we are
able to pursue them. In endless conjec∣tures
we quickly find ourselves bewil∣dered;
and, often, the next event that
happens baffles all the reasonings we had
formed concerning the succession of events.
The consequence which follows from this
is, that all the anxiety about futurity,
which passes the bounds of reasonable pre∣caution,
is unprofitable and vain. Certain
measures are indeed necessary to be taken
for our safety. We are not to rush for∣ward
inconsiderate and headlong. We must
make, as far as we are able, provision for
future welfare; and guard against dangers
which apparently threaten. But having
done this, we must stop; and leave the rest
to Him who disposeth of futurity at his
will. <HI>He who sitteth in the heavens laughs</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
at the wisdom and the plans of worldly
men. Wherefore, <HI>boast not thyself of to-mor∣row;
for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth.</HI> For the same reason, despair
not of to-morrow; for it may bring forth
good as well as evil. Vex not yourselves
with imaginary fears. The impending
black cloud, to which you look up with
so much dread, may pass by harmless; or
though it should discharge the storm, yet,
before it breaks, you may be lodged in
that lowly mansion which no storms ever
touch.</P>
<P>In the next place, there are in futurity
some events which may be certainly fore∣seen
by us, through all its darkness. First,
it may be confidently predicted, that no
situation into which it will bring us, shall
ever answer fully to our hopes, or confer
perfect happiness. This is as certain as if
we already saw it, that life, in its future
periods, will continue to be what it has
heretofore been; that it will be a mixed
and varied state; a checquered scene of
pleasures and pains, of fugitive joys and
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
transient griefs, succeeding in a round to
one another. Whether we look forward
to the years of youth, or to those of man∣hood
and advanced life, it is all the same.
The world will be to us, what it has been
to generations past. Set out, therefore, on
what remains of your journey under this
persuasion. According to this measure,
estimate your future pleasures; and calcu∣late
your future gains. Carry always along
with you a modest and a temperate mind.
Let not your expectations from the years
that are to come rise too high; and your
disappointments will be fewer, and more
easily supported.</P>
<P>Farther; this may be reckoned upon as
certain, that in every future situation of life,
a good conscience, a well ordered mind, and
a humble trust in the favour of Heaven,
will prove the essential ingredients of your
happiness. In reflecting upon the past,
you have found this to hold. Assure your∣selves
that in future, the case will be the
same. The principal correctives of human
vanity and distress, must be sought for in
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
religion and virtue. Entering on paths
which to you are new and unknown, place
yourselves under the conduct of a divine
guide. Follow the great <HI>Shepherd of Israel,</HI>
who, amidst the turmoil of this world,
leads his flock <HI>into green pastures and by the
still waters.</HI> As you advance in life, study
to improve both in good principles, and
in good practice. You will be enabled to
look to futurity without fear, if, whatever
it brings, it shall find you regularly em∣ployed
in <HI>doing justly, loving mercy, and
walking humbly with the Lord your God.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, Whatever other things may be
dubious in futurity, two great events are
undoubtedly certain, death and judgement.
These, we all know, are to terminate the
whole course of time; and we know them
to be not only certain, but to be approach∣ing
nearer to us, in consequence of every
day that passes over our heads. To these,
therefore, let us look foward, not with the
dread of children, but with that manly se∣riousness
which belongs to men and Chri∣stians.
Let us not avert our view from
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
them, as if we could place them at some
greater distance by excluding them from
our thoughts. This indeed is the refuge of
too many; but it is the refuge of fools,
who aggravate thereby the terrors they
must encounter. For <HI>he that cometh, shall
come, and will not tarry.</HI> To his coming, let
us look with a steady eye; and as life ad∣vances
through its progressive stages, pre∣pare
for its close, and for appearing before
him who made us.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to point out
the reflections proper to be made, when the
question is put to any of us, <HI>How old art
thou?</HI> I have shown with what eye we should
review the past years of your life; in what
light we should consider the present; and
with what dispositions look forward to the
future: In order that such a question may
always leave some serious impression behind
it; and may dispose us <HI>so to number</HI> to years
of our life, <HI>that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom.</HI></P>

Piety to God, and charity to men, are in∣cumbent
upon persons of every age, as
soon as they can think and act. Yet these
virtues, in different stages of life, assume
different forms; and when they appear in
that form which is most suited to our age,
they appear with peculiar gracefulness;
they give propriety to conduct, and add
dignity to character. In former discourses
I have treated of the virtues which adorn
youth, and of the duties which specially
belong to old age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">See vol. 1. Sermons 11. and 12.</NOTE> The circle of those
duties which respect middle age is indeed
much larger. As that is the busy period
in the life of man, it includes in effect the
whole compass of religion, and therefore
cannot have its peculiar character so de∣finitely
marked and ascertained. At the
same time, during those years wherein one
is sensible that he has advanced beyond
the confines of youth, but has not yet pass∣ed
into the region of old age, there are se∣veral
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
things which reflection on that por∣tion
of human life suggests, or at least
ought to suggest, to the mind. Inconsi∣derate
must he be, who, in his gradual
progress throughout middle age, pauses not,
at times, to think, how far he is now re∣ceding
from youth; how near he draws to
the borders of declining age; what part it
is now incumbent on him to act; what
duties both God and the world have a title
to expect from him. To these, I am at
present to call your attention; as what
materially concern the greatest part of those
who are now my hearers.</P>
<P>I. I BEGIN with observing, that the first
duty of those who are become men is, as
the text expresses it, <HI>to put away childish
things.</HI> The season of youthful levities,
follies, and passions, is now over. These
have had their reign; a reign perhaps too
long; and to which a termination is cer∣tainly
proper at last. Much indulgence is
due to youth. Many things admit of ex∣cuse
then, which afterwards become un∣pardonable.
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
Some things may even be
graceful in youth, which, if not criminal,
are at least ridiculous, in persons of matu∣rer
years. It is a great trial of wisdom, to
make our retreat from youth with pro∣priety;
to assume the character of man∣hood,
without exposing ourselves to re∣proach,
by an unseasonable remainder of
juvenility, on the one hand, or by precise
and disgusting formality, on the other.
Nature has placed certain boundaries, by
which she discriminates the pleasures, ac∣tions,
and employments, that are suited to
the different stages of human life. It be∣comes
us, neither to overleap those boun∣daries
by a transition too hasty and vio∣lent;
nor to hover too long on one side of
the limit, when nature calls us to pass o∣ver
to the other.</P>
<P>There are particularly two things in
which middle age should preserve its dis∣tinction
and separation from youth; these
are, levities of behaviour, and intemperate
indulgence of pleasure. The gay spirits of
the young often prompt an inconsiderate
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
degree of levity, sometimes amusing, some∣times
offensive; but for which, though be∣traying
the occasionally into serious dan∣gers,
their want of experience may plead
excuse. A more composed, and manly be∣haviour
is expected in riper years. The
affectation of youthful vanities, degrades
the dignity of manhood; even renders its
manners less agreeable; and by aukward
attempts to please, produces contempt.
Chearfulness is becoming in every age.
But the proper chearfulness of a man is as
different from the levity of the boy, as the
flight of the eagle is from the fluttering of
a sparrow in the air.</P>
<P>As all unseasonable returns to the levity
of youth ought to be laid aside,—an admo∣nition
which equally belongs to both the
sexes,—still more are we to guard against
those intemperate indulgences of pleasure,
to which the young are unhappily prone.
From these we cannot too soon retreat.
They open the path to ruin, in every pe∣riod
of our days. As long, however, as
these excesses are confined to the first stage
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
of life, hope is left, that when this fever of
the spirits shall abate, sobriety may gain the
ascendant, and wiser counsels have power
to influence conduct. But after the sea∣son
of youth is past, if its intemperate spi∣rit
remain; if, instead of listening to the
calls of honour, and bending attention to
the cares, and the business of men, the
same course of idleness and sensuality con∣tinue
to be pursued, the case becomes
more desperate. A sad presumption a∣rises,
that long immaturity is to prevail;
and that the pleasures and passions of the
youth are to sink and overwhelm the man.
Difficult, I confess, it may prove to over∣come
the attachments which youthful habits
had for a long while been forming. Hard,
at the beginning, is the task, to impose on
our conduct restraints which are altogether
unaccustomed and new. But this is a trial
which every one must undergo, in enter∣ing
on new scenes of action, and new pe∣riods
of life. Let those who are in this
situation bethink themselves, that all is now
at stake. Their character and honour, their
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
future fortune and success in the world,
depend in a great measure on the steps they
take, when first they appear on the stage
of active life. The world then looks to
them with observing eye. It studies their
behaviour; and interprets all their motions,
as presages of the line of future conduct
which they mean to hold. Now, there∣fore,
<HI>put away childish things;</HI> dismiss your
former trifling amusements, and youthful
pleasures; blast not the hopes which your
friends are willing to conceive of you.
Higher occupations, more serious cares, a∣wait
you. Turn your mind to the steady
and vigorous discharge of the part you are
called to act. This leads me,</P>
<P>II. To point out the particular duties
which open on those who are in the middle
period of life. They are now come for∣ward
to that field of action where they are
to mix in all the stir and bustle of the
world; where all the human powers are
brought forth into full exercise; where all
all that is conceived to be important in hu∣man
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
affairs is incessantly going on around
them. The time of youth was the prepa∣tion
for future action. In old age our ac∣tive
part is supposed to be finished, and rest
is permitted. Middle age is the season when
we are expected to display the fruits which
education had prepared and ripened. In
this world, all of us were formed to be as∣sistants
to one another. The wants of so∣ciety
call for every man's labour, and re∣quire
various departments to be filled up.
They require that some be appointed to
rule, and others to obey; some, to defend
the society from danger, others to main∣tain
its internal order and peace; some, to
provide the conveniencies of life, others to
promote the improvement of the mind;
many, to work; others to contrive and di∣rect.
In short, within the sphere of society
there is employment for every one; and in
the course of these employments, many a
moral duty is to be performed; many a
religious grace to be exercised. No one is
permitted to be a mere blank in the world.
No rank, nor station, no dignity of birth,
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
nor extent of possessions, exempt any man
from contributing his share to public uti∣lity
and good. This is the precept of God.
This is the voice of nature. This is the
just demand of the human race upon one
another.</P>
<P>One of the first questions, therefore,
which every man who is in the vigour of
his age should put to himself is, “What
am I doing in this world? What have
I yet done, whereby I may glorify God,
and be useful to my fellows? Do I pro∣perly
fill up the place which belongs to
my rank and station? Will any memo∣rial
remain of my having existed on the
earth? or are my days passing fruitless
away, now when I might be of some im∣portance
in the system of human affairs?”
—Let not any man imagine that he is of
no importance, and has, upon that ac∣count,
a privilege to trifle with his days
at pleasure. <HI>Talents</HI> have been give to all;
to some, <HI>ten;</HI> to others, <HI>five;</HI> to others,
<HI>two. Occupy with these</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, xix. 13.</NOTE> <HI>till I come,</HI> is the
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
command of the great Master to all. Where
superior abilities are possessed, or distin∣guished
advantages of fortune are enjoyed,
a wider range is afforded for useful exer∣tion,
and the world is intitled to expect it.
But among those who fill up the inferior
departments of society, though the sphere
of usefulness be more contracted, no one is
left entirely insignificant. Let us remem∣ber,
that in all stations and conditions, the
important relations take place, of masters
or servants, husbands and wives, parents
and children, brothers and friends, citizens
and subjects. The discharge of the duties
arising from those various relations, forms
a great portion of the work assigned to
the middle age of man. Though the part
we have to act may be confined within a
humble line, yet if it be honourably act∣ed,
it will be always found to carry its
own reward.</P>
<P>In fine, industry, in all its virtuous
forms, ought to inspirit and invigorate
manhood. This will add to it both satis∣faction
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
and dignity; will make the current
of our years, as they roll, flow along in a
clear and equable stream, without the pu∣trid
stagnation of sloth and idleness. Idle∣ness
is the great corrupter of youth; and
the bane and dishonour of middle age. He
who, in the prime of life, finds time to
hang heavy on his hands, may with much
reason suspect, that he has not consulted
the duties which the consideration of his
age imposed upon him; assuredly he has
not consulted his own happiness. But a∣midst
all the bustle of the world, let us not
forget,</P>
<P>III. To guard with vigilance against the
peculiar dangers which attend the period of
middle life. It is much to be regretted,
that in the present state of things there is
no period of man's age in which his virtue
is not exposed to perils. Pleasure lays its
snares for youth: and after the season of
youthful follies is past, other temptations,
no less formidable to virtue, presently arise.
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
The love of pleasure is succeeded by the
passion for interest. In this passion the
whole mind is too often absorbed; and the
change thereby induced on the character is
of no amiable kind. Amidst the excesses
of youth, virtuous affections often remain.
The attachments of friendship, the love of
honour, and the warmth of sensibility, give
a degree of lustre to the character, and co∣ver
many a failing. But interest, when it is
become the ruling principle, both debases
the mind, and hardens the heart. It dead∣ens
the feeling of every thing that is sub∣lime
or refined. It contracts the affections
within a narrow circle; and extinguishes
all those sparks of generosity and tender∣ness
which once glowed in the breast.</P>
<P>In proportion as worldly pursuits multi∣ply,
and competitions rise, ambition, jealou∣sy,
and envy, combine with interest to ex∣cite
bad passions, and to increase the corrup∣tion
of the heart. At first, perhaps, it was
a man's intention to advance himself in the
world by none but fair and laudable me∣thods.
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
He retained for some time an aver∣sion
to whatever appeared dishonourable.
But here, he is encountered by the violence
of an enemy. There, he is supplanted by
the address of a rival. The pride of a su∣perior
insults him. The ingratitude of a
friend provokes him. Animosities ruffle
his temper. Suspicions poison his mind.
He finds, or imagines that he finds, the
artful and designing surrounding him on
every hand. He views corruption and
iniquity prevailing; the modest neglected;
the forward and the crafty rising to distinc∣tion.
Too easily, from the example of
others, he learns that mystery of vice, call∣ed
the way of the world. What he has
learned he fancies necessary to practise for
his own defence; and of course assumes
that supple and versatile character, which
he observes to be frequent, and which of∣ten
has appeared to him successful.</P>
<P>To these, and many more dangers of the
same kind, is the man exposed who is deep∣ly
engaged in active life. No small degree
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
of firmness in religious principle, and of
constancy in virtue, is requisite, in order to
prevent his being assimilated to the spirit of
the world, and carried away by the <HI>multi∣tude
of evil doers.</HI> Let him therefore call
to mind those principles which ought to
fortify him against such temptations to vice.
Let him often recollect that, whatever his
station in life may be, he is a man; he is
a Christian. These are the chief characters
which he has to support; characters supe∣rior
far, if they be supported with dignity,
to any of the titles with which courts can
decorate him; superior to all that can be
acquired in the strife of a busy world. Let
him think, that though it may be desire∣able
to increase his opulence, or to advance
his rank, yet what he ought to hold much
more sacred is, to maintain his integrity and
honour. If these be forfeited, wealth or
station will have few charms left. They
will not be able to protect him long from
sinking into contempt in the eye of an ob∣serving
world. Even to his own eye he
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
will at last appear base and wretched.—
Let not the affairs of the world entirely in∣gross
his time and thoughts. From that
contagious air which he breaths in the
midst of it, let him sometimes retreat into
the salutary shade consecrated to devotion
and to wisdom. There, conversing serious∣ly
with his own soul, and looking up to
the Father of spirits, let him study to calm
those unquiet passions, and to rectify those
internal disorders, which intercourse with
the world had excited and increased. In
order to render this medicine of the
mind more effectual, it will be highly pro∣per,</P>
<P>IV. THAT as we advance in the course
of years, we often attend to the lapse of
time and life, and to the revolutions which
these are ever effecting. In this medita∣tion,
one of the first reflections which
should occur is, how much we owe to that
God who hath hitherto helped us; who
hath brought us on so far in life; hath
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
guided us through the slippery paths of
youth, and now enables us to flourish in
the strength of manhood. Look back, my
friends, to those who started along with
yourselves in the race of life. Think how
many of them have fallen around you.
Observe how many blank spaces you can
number in the catalogue of those who were
once your companions. If, in the midst
of so much devastation, you have been
preserved and blessed; consider seriously
what returns you owe to the goodness of
Heaven. Inquire whether your conduct
has corresponded to these obligations; whe∣ther,
in public and in private, you have
honoured, as became you, the God of your
fathers; and whether, amidst the unknown
occurrences that are yet before you, you
have ground to hope for the continued
protection of the Almighty.</P>
<P>Bring to mind the various revolutions
which you have beheld in human affairs,
since you became actors on this busy the∣atre.
Reflect on the changes which have
taken place in men and manners, in opi∣nions
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
and customs, in private fortunes, and
in public conduct. By the observations
you have made on these, and the experi∣ence
you have gained, have you impro∣ved
poroportionably in wisdom? Have the
changes of the world which you have wit∣nessed,
loosened all unreasonable attachment
to it? Have they taught you this great
lesson, that, while <HI>the fashion of the world</HI> is
ever <HI>passing away,</HI> only in God and in vir∣tue,
stability is to be found? Of great use,
amidst the whirl of the world, are such
pauses as these in life; such resting places
of thought and reflection; whence we can
calmly and deliberately look back on the
past, and anticipate the future.</P>
<P>To the future, we are often casting an
eager eye, and fondly storing it, in our i∣magination,
with many a pleasing scene.
But if we would look to it, like wise men,
let it be under the persuasion that it is
nearly to resemble the past, in bringing
forward a mixture of alternate hopes and
fears, of griefs and joys. In order to be
prepared for whatever it may bring, let us
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
cultivate that manly fortitude of mind,
which, supported by a pious trust in God,
will enable us to encounter properly the
vicissitudes of our state. No quality is
more necessary than this, to them who are
passing through that stormy season of life
of which we now treat. Softness and ef∣feminacy,
let them leave to the young and
unexperienced, who are amusing themselves
with florid prospects of bliss. But to those
who are now engaged in the middle of
their course, who are supposed to be well
acquainted with the world, and to know
that they have to struggle in it with va∣rious
hardships, firmness, vigour, and re∣solution,
are dispositions more suitable.
They must buckle on well this armour of
the mind, if they would issue forth into
the contest with any prospect of success.—
While we thus study to correct the er∣rors,
and to provide against the dangers,
which are peculiar to this stage of life,
let us also,</P>
<P>V. LAY foundation for comfort in old
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
age. That is a period which all expect and
hope to see; and to which, amidst the toils
of the world, men sometimes look for∣ward,
not without satisfaction, as to the
period of retreat and rest. But let them
not deceive themselves. A joyless and
dreary season it will prove, if they arrive
at it with an unimproved, or corrupted
mind. For old age, as for every other
thing, a certain preparation is requisite;
and that preparation consists chiefly in three
particulars; in the acquisition of know∣ledge,
of friends, of virtue. There is an
acquisition of another kind, of which it is
altogether needless for me to give any re∣commendation,
that of riches. But though
this, by many, will be esteemed a more mate∣rial
acquisition than all the three I have na∣med,
it may be confidently pronounced,
that, without these other requisites, all the
wealth we can lay up in store will prove
insufficient for making our latter days pass
smoothly away.</P>
<P>First, He who wishes to render his old
age comfortable, should study betimes to
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>
enlarge and improve his mind; and by
thought and inquiry, by reading and re∣flecting,
to acquire a taste for useful know∣ledge.
This will provide for him a great
and noble entertainment, when other en∣tertainments
leave him. If he bring into
the solitary retreat of age a vacant, unin∣formed
mind, where no knowledge dawns,
where no ideas rise, which has nothing to
feed upon within itself, many a heavy and
comfortless day he must necessarily pass.—
Next, When a man declines into the vale
of years, he depends more on the aid of
his friends, than in any other period of his
life. Then is the time, when he would
especially wish to find himself surrounded
by some who love and respect him; who
will bear with his infirmities, relieve him
of his labours, and chear him with their
society. Let him, therefore, now, in the
summer of his days, while yet active and
flourishing, by acts of seasonable kindness
and beneficence ensure that love, and by
upright and honourable conduct lay foun∣dation
for that respect, which in old age
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
he would wish to enjoy.—In the last place,
Let him consider a good conscience, peace
with God, and the hope of heaven, as the
most effectual consolations he can possess,
when the <HI>evil days</HI> shall come, wherein,
otherwise, he is likely to find little plea∣sure.
It is not merely by transient acts
of devotion that such consolations are
to be provided. The regular tenor of a
virtuous and pious life, spent in the faith∣ful
discharge of all the duties of our sta∣tion,
will prove the best preparation for
old age, for death, and for immortality.</P>
<P>AMONG the measures thus taken for the
latter scenes of life, let me admonish every
one not to forget to put his worldly affairs
in order, in due time. This is a duty
which he owes to his character, to his fa∣mily,
or to those, whoever they be, that
are to succeed him; but a duty too often
unwisely delayed, from a childish aversion
to entertain any thoughts of quitting the
world. Let him not trust much to what
he will do in his old age. Sufficient for
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
that day, if he shall live to see it, will be
the burden thereof. It has been remark∣ed,
that as men advance in years, they
care less to think of death. Perhaps it oc∣curs
oftener to the thoughts of the young,
than of the old. Feebleness of spirit ren∣ders
melancholy ides more oppressive;
and after having been so long accustomed
and inured to the world, men bear worse
with any thing which reminds them that
they must soon part with it.—However,
as to part with it is the doom of all, let
us take measures betimes for going off the
stage, when it shall be our turn to with∣draw,
with decency and propriety; leaving
nothing unfulfilled which it is expedient
to have done before we die. To live long,
ought not to be our favourite wish, so
much as to live well. By continuing too
long on earth, we might only live to wit∣ness
a greater number of melancholy scenes,
and to expose ourselves to a wider compass
of human woe. He who has served his
generation faithfully in the world, has du∣ly
honoured God, and been beneficent and
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
useful to mankind; he who in his life has
been respected and beloved; whose death
is accompanied with the sincere regret of
all who knew him, and whose memory is
honoured; that man has sufficiently fulfil∣led
his course, whether it was appointed by
Providence to be long or short. For <HI>ho∣nourable
age is not that which standeth in
length of time, nor that which is measured by
number of years; but wisdom is the gray hair
to man; and an unspotted life is old age</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom, iv. 8. 9.</NOTE>.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a sight which incessantly pre∣sents
itself.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE> Our eyes are so much
accustomed to it, what it hardly makes any
impression. Throughout every season of
the year, and during the course of almost
every day, the funerals which pass along
the streets show us <HI>man going to his long
home.</HI> Were death a rare and uncommon
object; were it only once in the course of
a man's life, that he beheld one of his fel∣low-creatures
carried to the grave, a solemn
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>
awe would fill him; he would stop short in
the midst of his pleasures; he would even
be chilled with secret horror. Such impres∣sions,
however, would prove unsuitable to
the nature of our present state. When they
became so strong as to render men unfit for
the ordinary business of life, they would in
a great measure defeat the intention of our
being placed in this world. It is better or∣dered
by the wisdom of Providence, that
they should be weakened by the frequency
of their recurrence; and so tempered by
the mixture of other passions, as to allow
us to go on freely in acting our parts on
earth.</P>
<P>Yet, familiar as death is now become, it
is undoubtedly fit, that by an event of so
important a nature, some impression should
be made upon our minds. It ought not to
pass over, as one of those common incidents
which are beheld without concern, and a∣waken
no reflection. There are many things
which the funerals of our fellow-creatures
are calculated to teach; and happy it were
for the gay and dissipated, if they would
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
listen more frequently to the instructions
of so awful a monitor. In the context, the
wise man had described, under a variety of
images suited to the eastern style, the grow∣ing
infirmities of old age, until they arrive
at that period which concludes them all;
when, as he beautifully expresses it, <HI>the sil∣ver
cord being loosened, and the golden bowl
broken, the pitcher being broken at the foun∣tain,
and the wheel at the cistern, man goeth
to his long home, and the mourners go about
the streets.</HI> In discoursing from these words,
it is into my purpose to treat, at present, of
the instructions to be drawn from the pro∣spect
of our own death. I am to confine
myself to the death of others; to consider
death as one of the most frequent and con∣siderable
events that happen in the course
of human affairs; and to show in what
manner we ought to be affected, first, by
the death of strangers, or indifferent per∣sons;
secondly, by the death of friends;
and thirdly, by the death of enemies.</P>
<P>1. BY the death of indifferent persons;
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
if any can be called indifferent, to whom
we are so nearly allied as brethren by na∣ture,
and brethren in mortality. When
we observe the funerals that pass along the
streets, or when we walk among the mo∣numents
of death, the first thing that na∣turally
strikes us is the undistinguishing
blow, with which that common enemy le∣vels
all. We behold a great promiscuous
multitude all carried to the same abode;
all lodged in the same dark and silent man∣sions.
There, mingle persons of every age
and character, of every rank and condition
in life; the young and the old, the poor
and the rich, the gay and the grave, the
renowned and the ignoble. A few weeks
ago, most of those whom we have seen car∣ried
to the grave, walked about as we do
now on the earth; enjoyed their friends,
beheld the light of the sun, and were form∣ing
designs for future days. Perhaps, it is
not long since they were engaged in scenes
of high festivity. For them, perhaps, the
cheerful company assembled; and in the
midst of the circle they shone with gay and
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
pleasing vivacity. But now—to them, all is
finally closed. To them, no more shall the
seasons return, or the sun arise. No more shall
they hear the voice of mirth, or behold the
face of man. They are swept from the
universe, as though they had never been.
They are <HI>carried away as with a flood: The
wind has passed over them, and they are gone.</HI></P>
<P>When we contemplate this desolation of
the human race; this final termination of
so many hopes; this silence that now regins
among those who, a little while ago, were
so busy, or so gay; who can avoid being
rouched with sensations at once awful and
tender? What heart but then warms with
the glow of humanity? In whose eye does
not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of
passing and shortlived man? Such sensa∣tions
are so congenial to human nature, that
they are attended with a certain kind of
sorrowful pleasure. Even voluptuaries them∣selves,
sometimes indulge a taste for fune∣real
melancholy. After the festive assembly
is dismissed, they chuse to walk retired in
the shady grove, and to contemplate the ve∣nerable
sepulchres of their ancestors. This
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
melancholy pleasure arises from two differ∣ent
sentiments meeting at the same time in
the breast; a sympathetic sense of the short∣ness
and vanity of life, and a persuasion
that something exists after death; senti∣ments,
which unite at the view of <HI>the house
appointed for all living.</HI> A tomb, it has
been justly said, is a monument situated on
the confines of both worlds. It, at once,
presents to us the termination of the inquie∣tudes
of life, and sets before us the image
of eternal rest. <HI>There,</HI> in the elegant ex∣pressions
of Job, <HI>the wicked cease from trou∣bling;
and there the weary be at rest. There
the prisoners rest together; they hear not the
voice of the oppressor. The small and the great
are there; and the servant is free from his
master.</HI> It is very remarkable, that in all
languages, and among all nations, death
has been described in a style of this kind;
expressed by figures of speech, which con∣vey
every where the same idea of rest, or
sleep, or retreat from the evils of life. Such
a style perfectly agrees with the general be∣lief
of the soul's immortality; but assuredly
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
conveys no high idea of the boasted plea∣sures
of the world. It shows how much
all mankind have felt this life to be a scene
of trouble and care; and have agreed in
opinion, that perfect rest is to be expected
only in the grave.</P>
<P><HI>There,</HI> says Job, <HI>are the small and the
great.</HI> There, the poor man lays down at
last the burden of his wearisome life. No
more shall he groan under the load of po∣verty
and toil. No more shall he hear the
insolent calls of the master, from whom he
received his scanty wages. No more shall
he be raised from needful slumber on his
bed of straw, nor be hurried away from
his homely meal, to undergo the repeated
labours of the day. While his humble grave
is preparing, and a few poor and decayed
neighbours are carrying him thither, it is
good for us to think, that this man too was
our brother; that for him the aged and de∣stitute
wife, and the needy children now
weep; that, neglected as he was by the
world, he possessed perhaps both a sound
understanding, and a worthy heart; and is
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
now carried by angels to rest in Abraham's
bosom.—At no great distance from him, the
grave is opened to receive the rich and proud
man. For, as it is said with emphasis in
the parable, <HI>the rich man also died, and was
buried</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke. xvi. 22.</NOTE>. He <HI>also</HI> died. His riches prevent∣ed
not his sharing the same fate with the
poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they
accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, <HI>the
mourners go about the streets;</HI> and while, in
all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his
funeral is prepared, his heirs, in the mean
time, impatient to examine his will, are
looking on one another with jealous eyes,
and already beginning to quarrel about the
division of his substance.—One day, we
see carried along the coffin of the smiling
infant; the flower just nipped as it began to
blossom in the parents view: and the next
day, we behold the young man, or young
woman, of blooming form and promising
hopes laid in an untimely grave. While
the funeral is attended by a numerous, un∣concerned
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
company, who are discoursing
to one another about the news of the day,
or the ordinary affairs of life, let our
thoughts rather follow to the house of
mourning, and represent to themselves what
is going on there. There, we would see a
disconsolate family, sitting in silent grief,
thinking of the sad breach that is made in
their little society; and, with tears in their
eyes, looking to the chamber that is now
left vacant, and to every memorial that
presents itself of their departed friend. By
such attention to the woes of others, the
selfish hardness of our hearts will be gra∣dually
softened, and melted down into hu∣manity.</P>
<P>Another day, we follow to the grave one
who, in old age, and after a long career
of life, has in full maturity sunk at last
into rest. As we are going along to the
mansion of the dead, it is natural for us to
think, and to discourse, of all the changes
which such a person has seen during the
course of his life. He has passed, it is
likely, through varieties of fortune. He
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
has experienced prosperity, and adversity.
He has seen families and kindreds rise and
fall. He has seen peace and war succeed∣ing
in their turns; the face of his country
undergoing many alterations; and the ve∣ry
city in which he dwelt rising, in a man∣ner,
new around him. After all he has
beheld, his eyes are now closed for ever.
He was becoming a stranger in the midst
of a new succession of men. A race who
knew him not, had arisen to fill the earth.
Thus passes the world away. Throughout
all ranks and conditions, <HI>one generation pass∣eth,
and another generation cometh;</HI> and this
great inn is by turns evacuated, and re∣plenished,
by troops of succeeding pilgrims.
—O vain and inconstant world! O fleet∣ing
and transient life! When will the sons
of men learn to think of thee, as they
ought? When will they learn humanity
from the afflictions of their brethren; or
moderation and wisdom, from the sense of
their own fugitive state?—But, now to
come nearer to ourselves, let us,</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="107"/>
II. CONSIDER the death of our friends.
Want of reflection, or the long habits, ei∣ther
of a very busy, or a very dissipated life,
may have rendered men insensible to all
such objects as I have now described. The
stranger, and the unknown, fall utterly
unnoticed at their side. Life proceeds with
them in its usual train, without being af∣fected
by events in which they take no
personal concern. But the dissolution of
those ties which had long bound men toge∣ther,
in intimate and familiar union, gives
a painful shock to every heart. When a
family, who, for years, had been living in
comfort and peace, are suddenly shattered
by some of their most beloved or respected
members being torn from them; when
the husband or the spouse are separated for
ever from the companion who, amidst eve∣ry
vicissitude of fortune, solaced their life;
who had shared all their joys, and partici∣pated
in all their sorrows; when the weep∣ing
parent is folding in his arms the dying
child whom he tenderly loved; when he
is giving his last blessing, receiving the
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>
last fond adieu, looking for the last time
on that countenance, now wasting and fa∣ded,
which he had once beheld with much
delight; then is the time, when the heart
is made to drink all the bitterness of hu∣man
woe.—But I seek not to wound your
feelings by dwelling on these sad descrip∣tions.
Let us rather turn our thoughts to
the manner in which such events ought
to be received and improved, since happen
they must in the life of man.</P>
<P>Then, indeed, is the time to weep. Let
not a false idea of fortitude, or mistaken
conceptions of religious duty, be employed
to restrain the bursting emotion. Let the
heart seek its relief, in the free effusion of
just and natural sorrow. It is becoming in
every one to show, on such occasions, that
he feels, as a man ought to feel. At the
same time, let moderation temper the grief
of a good man and a Christian. He must
not <HI>sorrow like those who have no hope.</HI> As
high elation of spirits befits not the joys,
so continued and overwhelming dejection
suits not the griefs of this transitory world.
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
Grief, when it goes beyond certain bounds,
becomes unmanly; when it lasts beyond a
certain time, becomes unseasonable. Let
him not reject the alleviation which time
brings to all the wounds of the heart, but
suffer excessive grief to subside, by degrees,
into a tender and affectionate remem∣brance.
Let him consider, that it is in the
power of Providence to raise him up other
comforts in the place of those he has lost.
Or, if his mind, at present, reject the
thoughts of such consolation, let it turn
for relief to the prospect of a future meet∣ing
in a happier world. This is indeed
the chief soother of affliction; the most
powerful balm of the bleeding heart. It
assists us to view death, as no more than
a temporary separation of friends. They
whom we have loved still live, though not
present to us. They are only removed in∣to
a different mansion in the house of the
common Father. The toils of their pil∣grimage
are finished; and they are gone
to the land of rest and peace. They are
gone from this dark and troubled world,
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
to join the great assembly of the just; and
to dwell in the midst of everlasting light.
In due time we hope to be associated with
them in these blissful habitations. Until
this season of re-union arrive, no principle
of religion discourages our holding corre∣spondence
of affection with them by means
of faith and hope.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, let us respect the virtues,
and cherish the memory, of the deceased.
Let their little failings be now forgotten.
Let us dwell on what was amiable in their
character, imitate their worth, and trace
their steps. By this means, the remem∣brance
of those whom we loved shall be∣come
useful and improving to us, as well
as sacred and dear; if we accustom our∣selves
to consider them as still speaking,
and exhorting us to all that is good; if,
in situations where our virtue is tried, we
call up their respected idea to view, and,
as placed in their presence, think of the
part which we could act before them with∣out
a blush.</P>
<P>Moreover, let the remembrance of the
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
friends whom we have lost, strengthen our
affection to those that remain. The nar∣rower
the circle becomes of those we love,
let us draw the closer together. Let the
heart that has been softened by sorrow,
mellow into gentleness and kindness; make
liberal allowance for the weaknesses of
other; and divest itself of the little pre∣judices
that may have formerly prepossess∣ed
it against them. The greater havock
that death has made among our friends
on earth, let us cultivate connection more
with God, and heaven, and virtue. Let
those noble views which man's immortal
character affords, fill and exalt our minds.
Passengers only through this sublunary re∣gion,
let our thoughts often ascend to that
divine country, which we are taught to
consider as the native seat of the soul.
There, we form connections that are ne∣ver
broken. There, we meet with friends
who never die. Among celestial things
there is firm and lasting constancy, while
all that is on earth changes and passes a∣way.—
Such are some of the fruits we
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
should reap from the tender feelings ex∣cited
by the death of friends. But they
are not only our friends who die. Our
enemies also must go to their <HI>long home.</HI>
Let us, therefore,</P>
<P>III. CONSIDER how we ought to be af∣fected,
when they from whom suspicions
have alienated, or rivalry has divided us;
they with whom we have long contended,
or by whom we imagine ourselves to have
suffered wrong, are laid, or about to be
laid, in the grave. How inconsiderable
then appear those broils in which we had
been long involved, those contests and
feuds which we thought were to last for
ever? The awful moment that now ter∣minates
them, makes us feel their vanity.
If there be a spark of humanity left in the
breast, the remembrance of our common
fate then awakens it. Is there a man, who,
if he were admitted to stand by the death∣bed
of his bitterest enemy, and beheld him
enduring that conflict which human na∣ture
must suffer at the last, would not be
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
inclined to stretch forth the hand of friend∣ship,
to utter the voice of forgiveness, and
to wish for perfect reconciliation with him
before he left the world? Who is there
that, when he beholds the remains of his
adversary deposited in the dust, feels not,
in that moment, some relentings at the re∣membrance
of those past animosities which
mutually embittered their life?—“There
lies the man with whom I contended so
long, silent and mute for ever. He is
fallen; and I am about to follow him.
How poor is the advantage which I now
enjoy? Where are the fruits of all our
contests? In a short time we shall be
laid together; and no remembrance re∣main
of either of us, under the sun.
How many mistakes may there have
been between us? Had not he his vir∣tues
and good qualities, as well as I?
When we shall both appear before the
judgement-seat of God, shall I be found
innocent, and free of blame, for all the
enmity I have borne to him?”—My
friends, let the anticipation of such senti∣ments,
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
serve now to correct the inveteracy
of prejudice, to cool the heat of anger, to
allay the fierceness of resentment. How
unnatural is it for animosities so lasting to
possess the hearts of mortal men, that no∣thing
can extinguish them, but the cold
hand of death? Is there not a sufficient
proportion of evils in the short span of
human life, that we seek to increase their
number, by rushing into unnecessary con∣tests
with one another? When a few suns
more have rolled over our heads, friends
and foes shall have retreated together; and
their love and their hatred be equally bu∣ried.
Let our few days, then, be spent in
peace. While we are all journeying on∣wards
to death, let us rather <HI>bear one an∣other's
burdens,</HI> than harass one another by
the way. Let us smooth and chear the
road as much as we can, rather than fill
the valley of our pilgrimage with the
hateful monuments of our contention and
strife.</P>
<P>THUS I have set before you some of
<PB N="106" REF="115"/>
those meditations which are naturally sug∣gested
by the prevalence of death around
us; by the death of strangers, of friends,
and of enemies. Because topics of this na∣ture
are obvious, let it not be thought that
they are without use. They require to be
recalled, repeated, and enforced. Moral
and religious instruction derives its efficacy,
not so much from what men are taught to
know, as from what they are brought to
feel. It is not the dormant knowledge of
any truths, but the vivid impression of
them, which has influence on practice.
Neither let is be thought, that such medita∣tions
are unseasonable intrusions upon those
who are living in health, in affluence, and
ease. There is no hazard of their making
too deep or painful an impression. The
gloom which they occasion is transient; and
will soon, too soon, it is probable, be dis∣pelled
by the succeeding affairs and plea∣sures
of the world. To wisdom it certain∣ly
belongs, that men should be impressed
with just views of their nature, and their
state: and the pleasures of life will always
<PB N="107" REF="116"/>
be enjoyed to most advantage when they
are tempered with serious thought. There
is <HI>a time to mourn,</HI> as well as <HI>a time to rejoice.</HI>
There is a virtuous <HI>sorrow, which is better
than laughter.</HI> There is a <HI>sadness of the coun∣tenance,
by which the heart is made better.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>

<Q>Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt
good manners.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH human nature be now fallen
from its original honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> several good
principles still remain in the hearts of men.
There are few, if any, on whose minds the
reverence for a Supreme Being continues
not, in some degree, impressed. In every
breast, some benevolent affections are found;
and conscience still retains a sense of the
distinction between moral good and evil.
These principles of virtue are always sus∣ceptible
of improvement; and, in favour∣able
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
situations, might have a happy in∣fluence
on practice. But such is the frail∣ty
of our nature, and so numerous are the
temptations to evil, that they are in perpe∣tual
hazard of being either totally effaced,
or so far weakened as to produce no effect
on conduct. They are good seeds original∣ly
sown in the heart; but which require
culture, in order to make them rise to any
maturity. If left without assistance, they
are likely to be stifled by that profusion of
noxious weeds which the soil sends forth
around them.</P>
<P>Among the numerous causes which in∣troduce
corruption into the heart, and ac∣celerate
its growth, none is more unhappily
powerful than that which is pointed out in
the text, under the description of <HI>evil com∣munications;</HI>
that is, the contagion which is
diffused by bad examples, and heightened
by particular connections with persons of
loose principles, or dissolute morals. This,
in a licentious state of society, is the most
common source of those vices and disorders
which so much abound in great cities;
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
and often proves, in particular manner, fa∣tal
to the young; even to them whose be∣ginnings
were once auspicious and promi∣sing.
It may therefore be an useful em∣ployment
of attention, to trace the progress
of this principle of corruption; to examine
the means by which <HI>evil communications</HI> gra∣dually
undermine, and at last destroy <HI>good
manners,</HI> or (which here is the proper sig∣nification
of the original word) <HI>good morals.</HI>
It is indeed disagreeable to contemplate hu∣man
nature, in this downward course of its
progress. But it is always profitable to
know our own infirmities and dangers.
The consideration of them will lead me to
suggest some of the means proper to be u∣sed,
for preventing the mischiefs arising
from <HI>evil communications.</HI></P>
<P>AGREEABLY to what I observed of cer∣tain
virtuous principles being inherent in
human nature, there are few but who set
out at first on the world with good disposi∣tions.
The warmth which belongs to youth
naturally exerts itself in generous feelings,
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>
and sentiments of honour; in strong at∣tachment
to friends, and the other emo∣tions
of a kind and tender heart. Almost
all the plans with which persons who have
been liberally educated begin the world, are
connected with honourable views. At that
period, they repudiate whatever is mean
or base. It is pleasing to them to think, of
commanding the esteem of those among
whom they live, and of acquiring a name
among men. But alas! how soon does this
flattering prospect begin to be overcast!
Desires of pleasure usher in temptation, and
forward the growth of disorderly passions.
Ministers of vice are seldom wanting to en∣courage,
and flatter, the passions of the
young. Inferiors study to creep into fa∣vour,
by servile obsequiousness to all their
desires and humours. Glad to find any
apology for the indulgences of which they
are fond, the young too readily listen to the
voice of those who suggest to them, that
strict notions of religion, order, and vir∣tue,
are old fashioned and illiberal; that
the restraints which they impose are only
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>
fit to be prescribed to those who are in the
first stage of pupillage; or to be preached
to the vulgar, who ought to be kept within
the closest bounds of regularity and subjec∣tion.
But the goodness of their hearts, it
is insinuated to them, and the liberality of
their views, will fully justify their emanci∣pating
themselves, in some degree, from
the rigid discipline of parents and teachers.</P>
<P>Soothing as such insinuations are to the
youthful, and inconsiderate, their first steps,
however, in vice, are cautious and timid,
and occasionally checked by remorse. As
they begin to mingle more in the world,
and emerge into the circles of gaiety and
pleasure, finding these loose ideas counte∣nanced
by too general practice, they gra∣dually
become bolder in the liberties they
take. If they have been bred to business,
they begin to tire of industry, and look
with contempt on the plodding race of citi∣zens.
If they be of superior rank, they
think it becomes them to resemble their e∣quals;
to assume that freedom of beha∣viour,
that air of forwardnese, that tone of
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
dissipation, that easy negligence of those
with whom they converse, which appear
fashionable in high life. If affluence of
fortune unhappily concur to favour their
inclinations, amusements and diversions
succeed in a perpetual round; night and
day are confounded; gaming fills up their
vacant intervals; they live wholly in public
places; they run into many degrees of ex∣cess,
disagreeable even to themselves, mere∣ly
from weak complaisance, and the fear of
being ridiculed by their loose associates.
Among these associates, the most hardened
and determined always take the lead. The
rest follow them with implicit submission;
and make proficiency in this school of ini∣quity,
in exact proportion to the weakness
of their understandings, and the strength
of their passions.</P>
<P>How many pass away, after this manner,
some of the most valuable years of their
life, tost in a whirlpool of what cannot be
called pleasure, so much as mere giddiness
and folly? In the habits of perpetual con∣nection
with idle or licentious company,
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>
all reflection is lost; while, circulated from
one empty head, and one thoughtless heart,
to another, folly shoots up into all its most
ridiculous forms; prompts the extravagant,
unmeaning frolic in private; or sallics forth
in public into mad riot; impelled some∣times
by intoxication, sometimes by mere
levity of spirits.</P>
<P>All the while, amidst this whole course
of juvenile infatuation, I readily admit, that
much good nature may still remain. Ge∣nerosity
and attachments may be found;
nay, some awe of religion may still subsist,
and some remains of those good impressions
which were made upon the mind in early
days. It might yet be very possible to re∣claim
such persons, and to form them for
useful and respectable stations in the world,
if virtuous and improving society should
happily succeed to the place of that idle
crew with whom they now associate; if
important business should occur, to bring
them into a different sphere of action; or,
if some seasonable stroke of affliction should
in mercy be sent, to recall them to them∣selves,
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
and to awaken serious and manly
thought. But, if youth and vigour, and
flowing fortune continue; if a similar suc∣cession
of companions go on to amuse them,
to ingross their time, and to stir up their
passions; the day of ruin,—let them take
heed, and beware!—the day of irrecover∣able
ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune
is squandered; health is broken; friends
are offended, affronted, estranged; aged
parents, perhaps, sent afflicted and mourn∣ing,
to the dust.</P>
<P>There are certain degrees of vice which
are chiefly stamped with the character of
the ridiculous, and the contemptible: and
there are also certain limits, beyond which
if it pass, it becomes odious and execra∣ble.
If, to other corruptions which the
heart has already received, be added the
infusion of sceptical principles, that worst
of all the <HI>evil communications</HI> of sinners, the
whole of morals is then on the point of
being overthrown. For, every crime can
then be palliated to conscience; every check
and restraint which had hitherto remained,
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
is taken away. He who, in the beginning
of his course, soothed himself with the
thought, that while he indulged his de∣sires,
he did hurt to no man; now, pressed
by the necessity of supplying those wants
into which his expensive pleasures have
brought him, goes on without remorse to
defraud, and to oppress. The lover of plea∣sure,
now becomes hardened and cruel;
violates his trust, or betrays his friend; be∣comes
a man of treachery, or a man of
blood; satisfying, or at least endeavouring
all the while to satisfy himself, that circum∣stances
form his excuse; that by necessity
he is impelled; and that, in gratifying the
passions which nature had implanted within
him, he does no more than follow nature.</P>
<P>Miserable and deluded man! to what
art thou come at the last? Dost thou
pretend to follow nature, when thou art
contemning the laws of the God of nature?
when thou art stifling his voice within
thee, which remonstrates against thy crimes?
when thou art violating the best part of
thy nature, by counteracting the dictates
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
of justice and humanity? Dost thou fol∣low
nature, when thou renderest thyself an
useless animal on the earth; and not use∣less
only, but noxious to the society to
which thou belongest, and to which thou
art a disgrace; noxious, by the bad ex∣ample
thou hast set; noxious, by the crimes
thou hast committed; sacrificing innocence
to thy guilty pleasures, and introducing
shame and ruin into the habitations of
peace; defrauding of their due the unsus∣picious
who have trusted thee; involving
in the ruins of thy fortune many a worthy
family; reducing the industrious and the
aged to misery and want; by all which, if
thou hast escaped the deserved sword of ju∣stice,
thou hast at least brought on thyself
the resentment, and the reproach of all the
respectable and the worthy.—Tremble then
at the view of the gulph which is opening
before thee. Look with horror at the pre∣cipice,
on the brink of which thou stand∣est:
and if yet a moment be left for re∣treat,
think how thou mayst escape, and
be saved.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127"/>
THIS brings me to what I proposed
as the next head of discourse; to suggest
some means that may be used for stopping
in time the progress of such mischiefs; to
point out some remedies against the fatal
infection of <HI>evil communications.</HI></P>
<P>THE first and most obvious is, to with∣draw
from all associations with bad men,
with persons either of licentious principles,
or of disorderly conduct. I have shown to
what issue such dangerous connections are
apt to bring men at last. Nothing, there∣fore,
is of more importance for the young,
to whom I now chiefly address myself, than
to be careful in the choice of their friends
and companions. This choice is too fre∣quently
made without much thought, or
is determined by some casual connection;
and yet, very often, the whole fate of their
future life depends upon it. The circum∣stances
which chiefly attract the liking and
the friendship of youth, are vivacity, good
humour, engaging manners, and a cheer∣ful
or easy temper; qualities, I confess, a∣miable
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
in themselves, and useful and va∣luable
in their place. But I intreat you to
remember, that these are not all the quali∣ties
requisite to form an intimate compa∣nion
or friend. Something more is still to
he looked for; a sound understanding, a
steady mind, a firm attachment to prin∣ciple,
to virtue, and honour. As only so∣lid
bodies polish well, it is only on the sub∣stantial
ground of these manly endowments,
that the other amiable qualities can receive
their proper lustre. Destitute of these es∣sential
requisites, they shine with no more
than a tinsel brilliancy. It may sparkle for
a little, amidst a few circles of the frivolous,
and superficial; but it imposes not on the
discernment of the public. The world in
general seldom, after a short trial, judges
amiss of the characters of men. You may
be assured, that its character of you will be
formed by the company you frequent; and
how agreeable soever they may seem to be,
if nothing is to be found among them but
hollow qualities, and external accomplish∣ments,
they soon fall down into the class,
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
at best, of the insignificant, perhaps of the
worthless; and you sink of course, in the
opinion of the public, into the same despi∣cable
rank.</P>
<P>Allow me to warn you, that the most
gay and pleasing, are sometimes the most
insidious and dangerous companions; an
admonition which respects both the sexes.
Often they attach themselves to you from
interested motives; and if any taint or suspi∣cion
lie on their character, under the cover
of your rank, your fortune, or your good
reputation, they seek protection for them∣selves.
Look round you, then, with atten∣tive
eye, and weigh characters well before
you connect yourselves too closely with any
who court your society. <HI>He that walketh
with wise men shall be wise; but a companion
of fools shall be destroyed.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>enter
not thou into the counsel of the scorner. Walk
not in the way with evil men; avoid it; pass
not by it, turn from it, and pass away</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 20.; Prov. iv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="130"/>
IN order to prevent the influence of <HI>evil
communications,</HI> it is farther needful, that
you fix to yourselves certain principles of
conduct, and be resolved and determined
on no occasion to swerve from them. Set∣ting
the consideration of religion and vir∣tue
aside, and attending merely to interest
and reputation, it will be found, that he
who enters on active life without having
ascertained some regular plan, according to
which he is to guide himself, will be un∣prosperous
in the whole of his subsequent
progress. But when conduct is viewed in
a moral and religious light, the effect of
having fixed no principles of action; of
having formed no laudable standard of
character, becomes more obviously fatal.
For hence it is, that the young and thought∣less
imbibe so readily the poison of <HI>evil
communications,</HI> and fall a prey to every se∣ducer.
They have no internal guide whom
they are accustomed to follow and obey; no∣thing
within themselves, that can give firm∣ness
to their conduct. They are of course
the victims of momentary inclination or
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>
caprice; religious and good by starts,
when, during the absence of temptation
and tempters, the virtuous principle stirs
within them; but never long the same;
changing and fluctuating according to the
passion that chances to rise, or the instiga∣tion
of those with whom they have con∣nected
themselves. They are sailing on a
dangerous sea, which abounds with rocks;
without compass, by which to direct their
course, or helm, by which to guide the ves∣sel.
Whereas, if they acted on a system,
if their behaviour made it appear that they
were determined to conduct themselves by
certain rules and principles, not only would
they escape innumerable dangers, but they
would command respect from the licenti∣ous
themselves. Evil doers would cease to
lay their snares for one whom they saw
moving above them, in a higher sphere,
and with a more steady course.</P>
<P>As a farther corrective of <HI>evil communi∣cations,</HI>
and as a foundation to those prin∣ciples
which you lay down for conduct,
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>
let me advise you sometimes to think se∣riously,
of what constitutes real enjoyment
and happiness. Your days cannot be en∣tirely
spent in company and pleasure.
How closely soever you are surrounded and
besieged by evil companions, there must
be some intervals, in which you are left by
yourselves; when, after all the turbulence
of amusement is over, your mind will na∣turally
assume a graver and more pensive
cast. These are precious intervals to you,
if you knew their value. Seize that sober
hour of retirement and silence. Indulge
the meditations which then begin to rise.
Cast your eye backwards on what is past
of your life; look forward to what is pro∣bably
to came. Think of the part you
are now acting; and of what remains to
be acted, perhaps to be suffered, before you
die. Then is the time to form your plans
of happiness, not merely for the next day,
but for the general course of your life.
Remember, that what is pleasing to you at
twenty, will not be equally so at forty or
fifty years of age; and that what continues
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>
longest pleasing, is always most valuable.
Recollect your own feelings in different
scenes of life. Inquire on what occasions
you have felt the truest satisfaction; whe∣ther
days of sobriety, and rational employ∣ment,
have not left behind them a more a∣greeable
remembrance, that nights of li∣centiousness
and riot. Look round you on
the world; reflect on the different socie∣ties
which have fallen under your obser∣vation;
and think who among them ap∣pear
to enjoy life to most advantage; whe∣ther
they who, encircled by gay compa∣nions,
are constantly fatiguing themselves
in quest of pleasure; of they to whom plea∣sure
comes unsought, in the course of an
active, virtuous, and manly life. Compare
together these two classes of mankind, and
ask your own hearts, to which of them
you would chuse to belong. If, in a hap∣py
moment, the light of truth begin to
break in upon you, refuse not admittance
to the ray. If your hearts secretly re∣proach
you for the worng choice you have
made, bethink yourselves that the evil is
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>
not irreparable. Still there is time for re∣pentance
and retreat; and a return to wis∣dom,
is always honourable.</P>
<P>Were such meditations often indulged,
the <HI>evil communications</HI> of sinners would die
away before them; the force of their poi∣son
would evaporate; the world would be∣gin
to assume in your eyes a new form
and shape. Disdain not, in these solitary
hours, to recollect what the wisest have
said, and have written, concerning human
happiness, and human vanity. Treat not
their opinions, as effusions merely of pee∣vishness
or disappointment: but believe
them to be, what they truly are, the result
of long experience, and thorough acquaint∣ance
with the world. Consider that the
season of youth is passing fast away. It
is time for you to be taking measures for
an establishment in life; nay, it were wise
to be looking forward to a placid enjoy∣ment
of old age. That is a period you
wish to see; but how miserable when it
arrives, if it yield you nothing but the
dregs of life; and present no retrospect,
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
except that of a thoughtless, and disho∣noured
youth!</P>
<P>LET me once more advise you, to look
forward sometimes beyond old age; to
look to a future world. Amidst <HI>evil commu∣nications,</HI>
let your belief, and your character
as Christians, arise to your view. Think
of the sacred name in which you were
baptized. Think of the God whom your
fathers honoured and worshipped; of the
religion in which they trained you up; of
the venerable rites in which they brought
you to partake. Their paternal cares have
now ceased. They have finished their
earthly course: and the time is coming
when you must follow them. You know
that you are not to live always here; and
you surely do not believe that your exist∣ence
is to end with this life. Into what

will you meet with there? Before whose
tribunal are you to appear? What account
will you be able to give of your present
trifling and irregular conduct to him who
<PB N="127" REF="136"/>
made you?—Such thoughts may be treat∣ed
as unseasonable intrusions. But intrude
they sometimes will, whether you make
them welcome or not. Better then, to al∣low
them free reception when they come,
and to consider fairly to what they lead.
You have seen persons die; at least, you
have heard of your friends dying near you.
Did it never enter into your minds, to
think what their last reflections probably
were in their concluding moments; or
what your own, in such a situation, would
be? What would be then your hopes and
fears; what part you would then wish to
have acted; in what light your closing
eyes would then view this life, and this

<P>These are thoughts, my friends, too im∣portant

highest attention. Let us regard them as
becomes reasonable and mortal creatures;
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
and they will prove effectual antidotes to
the <HI>evil communications</HI> of petulant scoffers.

with which I conclude, sound full

<P>THIS world is a region of danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE> in
which perfect safety is possessed by
no man. Though we live in times of e∣stablished
tranquility, when there is no
ground to apprehend that <HI>an host</HI> shall, in
the literal sense, <HI>encamp against us;</HI> yet eve∣ry
man, from one quarter or other, has

The most flourishing family may unexp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t∣edly
<PB N="130" REF="139"/>
be scattered. The appearances of our
security are frequently deceitful. When
our sky seems most settled and serene, in
some unobserved quarter gathers the little
black cloud, in which the tempest ferments,
and prepares to discharge itself on our head.
Such is the real situation of man in this
world; and he who flatters himself with an
opposite view of his state, only lives in the
paradise of fools.</P>
<P>In this situation, no quality is more re∣quisite
than constancy, or fortitude of
mind; a quality which the Psalmist ap∣pears,
from the sentiment in the text, to
have possessed in an eminent degree. For∣titude
was justly classed by the ancient
philosophers, among the cardinal virtues.
It is indeed essential to the support of them
all; and is most necessary to be acquired
by every one who wishes to discharge with
fidelity the duties of his station. It is the
armour of the mind, which will fit him
for encountering the trials, and surmount∣ing
the dangers, that are likely to occur in
the course of his life. It may be thought,
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>
perhaps, to be a quality, in some measure,
constitutional; dependent on firmness of
nerves, and strength of spirits. Though,
partly, it is so, yet experience shows that
it may also be acquired by principle, and
be fortified by reason; and it is only when
thus acquired, and thus fortified, that it
can be accounted to carry the character of
virtue. Fortitude is opposed, as all know,
to timidity, irresolution, a feeble and a
wavering spirit. It is placed, like other
virtues, in the middle between two ex∣tremes;
standing at an equal distance from
rashness on the one hand, and from pusil∣lanimity
on the other. In discoursing on
this subject, I purpose, first, to show the
importance of fortitude or constancy; next,
to ascertain the grounds on which it must
rest; and, lastly, to suggest some considera∣tions
for assisting the exercise of it.</P>
<P>I. THE high importance of fortitude will
easily appear, if we consider it as respect∣ing
either the happiness of human life, or
the proper discharge of its duties.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="141"/>
Without some degree of fortitude there
can be no happiness: because, amidst the
thousand uncertainties of life, there can be
no enjoyment of tranquility. The man
of feeble and timorous spirit, lives under
perpetual alarms. He foresees every distant
danger, and trembles. He explores the re∣gions
of possibility, to discover the dangers
that may arise. Often he creates imaginary
ones; always magnifies those that are real.
Hence, like a person haunted by spectres,
he loses the free enjoyment even of a safe
and prosperous state. On the first shock of
adversity, he desponds. Instead of exerting
himself to lay hold on the resources that
remain, he gives up all for lost; and re∣signs
himself to abject and broken spirits.
—On the other hand, firmness of mind is
the parent of tranquility. It enables one
to enjoy the present without disturbance;
and to look calmly on dangers that ap∣proach,
or evils that threaten in future. It
suggests good hopes. It supplies resources.
It allows a man to retain the full possession
of himself, in every situation of fortune.
Look into the heart of this man, and you
<PB N="133" REF="142"/>
will find composure, cheerfulness, and mag∣nanimity.
Look into the heart of the other,
and you will see nothing but confusion,
anxiety, and trepidation. The one is the
castle built on a rock, which defies the at∣tacks
of surrounding waters. The other
is a hut placed on the shore, which every
wind shakes, and every wave overflows.</P>
<P>IF fortitude be thus essential to the enjoy∣ment
of life, it is equally so, to the proper
discharge of all its most important duties.
He who is of a cowardly mind is, and
must be, a slave to the world. He fashions
his whole conduct according to its hopes
and fears. He smiles, and fawns, and be∣trays,
from abject considerations of personal
safety. He is incapable of either concei∣ving,
or executing, any great design. He
can neither stand the clamour of the mul∣titude,
nor the frowns of the mighty. The
wind of popular favour, of the threats of
power, are sufficient to shake his most
determined purpose. The world always
knows where to find him. He may pretend
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>
to have principles; but on every trying oc∣casion,
it will be seen, that his pretended
principles bend to convenience and safety.
—The man of virtuous fortitude, again,
follows the dictates of his heart, unembar∣rassed
by those restraints which lie upon
the timorous. Having once determined
what is fit for him to do, no threatenings
can shake, nor dangers appall him. He
rests upon himself, supported by a con∣sciousness
of inward dignity. I do not say
that this disposition alone, will secure him
against every vice. He may be lifted up
with pride. He may be seduced by plea∣sure.
He may be hurried away by passion.
But at least on one quarter, he will be safe;
by no abject fears misled into evil.</P>
<P>Without this temper of mind, no man
can be a thorough Christian. For his pro∣fession,
as such, requires him to be supe∣rior
to that <HI>fear of man which bringeth a
snare;</HI> enjoins him, for the sake of a good
conscience, to encounter every danger; and
to be prepared, if called, even to lay down
his life in the cause of religion and truth.
<PB N="135" REF="144"/>
All who have been distinguished as ser∣vants
of God, or benefactors of men; all
who, in perilous situations, have acted their
part with such honour as to render their
names illustrious through succeeding ages,
have been eminent for fortitude of mind.
Of this we have one conspicuous example in
the Apostle Paul, whom it will be instruc∣tive
for us to view in a remarkable occur∣rence
of his life. After having long acted
as the apostle of the Gentiles, his mission
called him to go to Jerusalem, where he
knew that he was to encounter the utmost
violence of his enemies. Just before he set
sail, he called together the elders of his
favourite church at Ephesus, and in a pa∣thetic
speech, which does great honour to
his character, gave them his last farewel.
Deeply affected by their knowledge of the
certain dangers to which he was exposing
himself, all the assembly were filled with
distress, and melted into tears. The cir∣cumstances
were such, as might have con∣veyed
dejection even into a resolute mind;
and would have totally overwhelmed the
<PB N="136" REF="145"/>
feeble. <HI>They all wept fore, and fell on Paul's
neck, and kissed him; sorrowing most of all
for the words which he spake, that they should
see his face no more.</HI> What were then the
sentiments, what was the language, of this
great and good man? Hear the words
which spoke his firm and undaunted
mind. <HI>Behold, I go bound in the spirit, un∣to
Jerusalem, not knowing the things that
shall befall me there; save that the Holy
Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying, that
bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of
these things move me; neither count I my life
dear unto myself, so that I might finish my
course with joy, and the ministry which I
have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the
gospel of the grace of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 22. 23. 24.; 37. 38.</NOTE>. There was ut∣tered
the voice, there breathed the spirit, of
a brave, and a virtuous man. Such a man
knows not what it is to shrink from dan∣ger,
when conscience points out his path.
In that path he is determined to walk; let
the consequences be what they will. <HI>Till
<PB N="137" REF="146"/>
I die, I will not remove my integrity from me.
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let
it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long
as I live</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 5. 6.</NOTE>. “For me, there is a part ap∣pointed
to act. I go to perform it. My
duty I shall do to-day. Let <HI>to-morrow
take thought for the things of itself.”</HI>—
Having thus shown the importance, I pro∣ceed,</P>
<P>II. To show the proper foundations of
constancy and fortitude of mind. They
are principally two; a good conscience,
and trust in God.</P>
<P>A corrupted and guilty man, can possess
no true firmness of heart. He who by
crooked paths, pursues dishonourable ends,
has many things to dismay him. He not
only dreads the disappointment of his de∣signs,
by some of those accidents to which
all are exposed; but he has also to dread
the treachery of his confederates, the dis∣covery
and reproach of the world, and the
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>
just displeasure of Heaven. His fears he
is obliged to conceal; but while he assumes
the appearance of intrepidity before the
world, he trembles within himself; and
the bold and steady eye of integrity, fre∣quently
darts terror into his heart. There
is, it is true, a sort of constitutional cou∣rage,
which sometimes has rendered men
daring in the most flagitious attempts.
But this fool-hardiness of the rash, this
boldness of the russian, is altogether differ∣ent
from real fortitude. It arises merely
from warmth of blood, from want of
thought, and blindness to danger. As it
forms no character of value, so it appears
only in occasional sallies; and never can be
uniformily maintained. It requires adven∣titious
props to support it; and in some
hour of trial, always fails. There can be
no true courage, no regular persevering
constancy, but what is connected with
principle, and founded on a consciousness
of rectitude of intention. This, and this
only, erects that brazen wall which we can
oppose to every hostile attack. It cloaths
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
us with an armour, on which fortune will
spend its shafts in vain. All is found
within. There is no weak place, where we
particularly dread a blow. There is no
occasion for false colours to be hung out.
No disguise is needed to cover us. We
would be satisfied if all mankind could
look into our hearts. What has he to
fear, who not acts on a plan which
his conscience approves, but who knows
that every good man, nay, the whole un∣biassed
world, if they could trace his in∣tentions,
would justify and approve his
conduct?</P>
<P>HE knows, at the same time, that he is act∣ing
under the immediate eye and protec∣tion
of the Almighty. <HI>Behold my witness is
in heaven; and my record is on high</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xvi. 19.</NOTE>. Here
opens a new source of fortitude to every
virtuous man. The consciousness of such
an illustrious spectator, invigorates and ani∣mates
him. He trusts, that the eternal lo∣ver
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
of righteousness not only beholds and
approves, but will strengthen and assist;
will not suffer him to be unjustly oppressed,
and will reward his constancy in the end,
with glory, honour, and immortality. A
good conscience, thus supported, bestows
on the heart a much greater degree of intre∣pidity,
than it could otherwise inspire. One
who rests on an Almighty, though invisible,
Protector, exerts his powers with double
force; acts with vigour not his own. Ac∣cordingly,
it was from this principle of
trust in God, that the Psalmist derived that
courage and boldness, which he expresses
in the text. He had said immediately be∣fore,
<HI>The Lord is my light and my salvation;
the Lord is the strength of my life.</HI> The con∣sequence
which directly follows is, <HI>of whom
shall I be afraid? Though an host should en∣camp
against me, my heart shall not fear.</HI> It
remains,</P>
<P>III. THAT I suggest a few considerations
which may prove auxiliary to the exercise
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>
of virtuous fortitude, in the midst of dan∣gers.</P>
<P>From what was just now said, it appears,
first, that it is of high importance to every
one who wishes to act his part with be∣coming
resolution, to cultivate a religious
principle, and to be inspired with trust in
God. The imperfections of the best are
indeed so numerous, as to give them no
title to claim, on their own account, the
protection of Heaven. But we are taught
to believe, that the merciful God, who made
us, and who <HI>knows our frame,</HI> favours the
sincere and upright; that the supreme ad∣ministration
of the universe is always on
the side of truth and virtue; and, that,
therefore, every worthy character, and eve∣ry
just and good cause, though for a while
it should be depressed, is likely to receive
countenance and protection in the end.
The more firmly this belief is rooted in
the heart, its influence will be more power∣ful,
in surmounting the fears which arise
from a sense of our own weakness or dan∣ger.
The records of all nations afford a
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>
thousand remarkable instances of the ef∣fect
of this principle, both on individuals,
and on bodies of men. Animated by the
strong belief of a just cause, and a pro∣tecting
God, the <HI>feeble have waxed strong,</HI>
and have despised dangers, sufferings,
and death. Handfuls of men have defied
<HI>hosts that were encamped against them;</HI> and
have gone forth, conquering and to con∣quer.
<HI>The sword of the Lord, and of Gi∣deon,</HI>
have called forth a valour which a∣stonished
the world; and which could have
been exerted by none, but those who fought
under a divine banner.</P>
<P>IN the next place, let him who would
preserve fortitude in difficult situations, fill
his mind with a sense, of what constitutes
the true honour of man. It consists not in
the multitude of riches, or the elevation of
rank; for experience shows, that these may
be possessed by the worthless, as well as by
the deserving. It consists, in being deterred
by no danger when duty calls us forth; in
fulfilling our allotted part, whatever it may
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
be, with faithfulness, bravery, and con∣stancy
of mind. These qualities never fail
to stamp distinction on the character. They
confer on him who discovers them, an ho∣nourable
superiority, which all, even ene∣mies,
feel and revere. Let every man,
therefore, when the hour of danger comes,
bethink himself, that now is arrived the
hour of trial; the hour which must deter∣mine
whether he is to rise, or to sink for
ever, in the esteem of all around him. If,
when put to the rest, he discover no firm∣ness
to maintain his ground, no fortitude
to stand a shock, he has forfeited every
pretension to a manly mind. He must
reckon on being exposed to general con∣tempt;
and what is worse, he will feel that
he deserves it. In his own eyes he will be
contemptible; than which, surely, no mi∣sery
can be more severe.</P>
<P>BUT in order to acquire habits of forti∣tude,
what is of the highest consequence
is, to have formed a just estimate of the
goods and evils of life, and of the value of
<PB N="144" REF="153"/>
life itself. For here lies the chief source of
our weakness and pusillanimity. We over∣value
the advantages of fortune; rank and
riches, ease and safety. Deluded by vain
opinions, we look to these as our ultimate
goods. we hang upon them with fond at∣tachment;
and to forfeit any hope of ad∣vancement,
to incur the least discredit with
the world, or to be brought down but one
step from the station we possess, is regard∣ed
with consternation and dismay. Hence,
a thousand weights hang upon the mind,
which depress its courage, and bend it to
mean and dishonourable compliances. What
fortitude can he posses, what worthy or
generous purpose can he form, who con∣ceives
diminution of rank, or loss of for∣tune,
to be the chief evils which man can
suffer? Put these into the balance with
true honour, with conscious integrity, with
the esteem of the virtuous and the wise,
with the favour of Almighty God, with
peace of mind, and hope of heaven; and
then think, whether those dreaded evils are
sufficient to intimidate you from doing
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>
your duty. Look beyond external appear∣ances
to the inside of things. Suffer not
yourselves to be imposed on by that glitter∣ing
varnish, with which the surface of the
world dazzles the vulgar. Consider how
many are contented and happy without
those advantages of fortune, on which you
put so extravagant a value. Consider whe∣ther
it is possible for you to be happy with
them, if, for their sake, you forfeit all that
is estimable in man. The favour of the
great, perhaps, you think, is at stake; or
that popularity with the multitude, on
which you build plans of advancement.
Alas! how precarious are the means which
you employ in order to attain the end you
have in view; and the end itself, how little
is it worthy of your ambition? That fa∣vour
which you pursue, of dubious advan∣tage
when gained, is frequently lost by
servile compliance. The timid and abject
are detected, and despised even by those
whom they court; while the firm and re∣solute
rise in the end to those honours,
which the other pursued in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155"/>
PUT the case at the worst. Suppose not
your fortune only, but your safety, to be
in hazard; your life itself to be endanger∣ed,
by adhering to conscience and vir∣tue.
Think, what a creeping and igno∣minious
state you would render life, if,
when your duty calls, you would expose it
to no danger; if by a dastardly behaviour,
you would, at any expence, preserve it.
That life, which you are so anxious to pre∣serve,
can at any rate be prolonged only
for a few years more; and those years may
be full of woe. He who will not risk death
when conscience requires him to face it,
ought to be ashamed to live.—Consider,
as a man and a Christian, for what purpose
life was given thee by Heaven. Was it,
that thou mightest pass a few years in low
pleasures, and ignoble sloth; flying into
every corner to hide thyself, when the least
danger rises to view? No: Life was given,
that thou mightest come forth to act some
useful and honourable part, on that theatre
where thou hast been placed by Provi∣dence;
mightest glorify him that made
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
thee; and by steady perseverance in virtue,
rise in the end to an immortal state.</P>
<P>Son of man! Remember thine original
honours. Assert the dignity of thy nature.
Shake off this pusillanimous dread of death;
and seek to fulfil the ends for which thou
wert sent forth by thy Creator.—The
sentiment of a noble mind is, <HI>I count not
my life dear unto myself, so that I may finish
my course with joy.</HI> To the <HI>finishing of his
course,</HI> let every one direct his eye; and let
him now appretiate life according to the
value it will be found to have, when sum∣med
up at the close. That is the period
which brings every thing to the test. Illu∣sions
may formerly have imposed on the
world; may have imposed on the man him∣self.
But all illusion then vanishes. The
real character comes forth. The estimate
of happiness is fairly formed. Hence it
has been justly said, that no man can be
pronounced either great or happy, until his
last hour come. To that last hour, what
will bring such satisfaction, or add so much
dignity, as the reflection, on having sur∣mounted
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
with firmness all the discourage∣ments
of the world, and having persevered
to the end in one uniform course of fidelity
and honour? We remarked before, the
magnanimous behaviour of the Apostle
Paul, when he had persecution and distress
full in view. Hear now the sentiments of
the same great man, when the time of his
last suffering approached; and remark the
majesty, and the ease; with which he look∣ed
on death. <HI>I am now ready to be offered,
and the time of my departure is at hand. I
have fought the good fight. I have finished
my course. I have kept the faith. Hence∣forth
there is laid up for me a crown of righ∣teousness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Timothy, iv. 6. 7.</NOTE>.
How many years of life does
such a dying moment overbalance? Who
would not chuse, in this manner, to go off
the stage, with such a song of triumph in
his mouth, rather than prolong his exist∣ence
through a wretched old age, stained
with sin and shame?</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="158"/>
ANIMATED by these considerations, let
us nourish that fortitude of mind, which is
so essential to a man, and a Christian. Let
no discouragement, nor danger, deter us
from doing what is right. Through <HI>ho∣nour
and dishonour, through good report and
bad report,</HI> let us preserve fidelity to our
God and our Saviour. <HI>Though an host should
encamp against us,</HI> let us not fear to dis∣charge
our duty. God assists us in the vir∣tuous
conflict; and will crown the conque∣ror
with eternal rewards. <HI>Be thou faithful
unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
life. To him that overcometh,</HI> faith our bless∣ed

<P>ENVY is a sensation of uneasiness
and disquiet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE> arising from the ad∣vantages
which others are supposed to
possess above us, accompanied with ma∣lignity
towards those who possess them.
This is universally admitted to be one of
the blackest passions in the human heart.
In this world, we depend much on one
another; and were therefore formed by
God to be mutually useful and assisting.
The instincts of kindness and compassion
which belong to our frame, show how
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
much it was the intention of our Creator,
that we should be united in friendship. If
any infringe this great law of nature, by
acts of causeless hostility, resentment may
justly arise. No one is to be condemned
for defending his rights, and showing dis∣pleasure
against a malicious enemy. But
to conceive ill-will at one who has attacked
none of our rights, nor done us any inju∣ry,
solely because he is more prosperous
than we are, is a disposition altogether un∣natural;
it suits not the human constitu∣tion,
and partakes more of the rancour of
an evil spirit. Hence, the character of an
envious man is universally odious. All dis∣claim
it; and they who feel themselves un∣der
the influence of this passion, carefully
conceal it.</P>
<P>But it is proper to consider, that among
all our passions, both good and bad, there
are many different gradations. Sometimes
they swim on the surface of the mind,
without producing any internal agitation.
They proceed no farther than the begin∣nings
of passion. Allayed by our consti∣tution,
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
or tempered by the mixture of other
dispositions, they exert no considerable in∣fluence
on the temper. Though the cha∣racter
in which envy forms the ruling pas∣sion,
and reigns in all its force, be one too
odious, I hope, to be common; yet some
shade, some tincture, of this evil disposi∣tion,
mixes with most characters in the
world. It is, perhaps, one of the most pre∣vailing
infirmities to which we are subject.
There are few but who, at one time or
other, have found somewhat of this nature
stirring within them; some lurking unea∣siness
in their mind, when they looked up
to others, who enjoyed a greater share than
had fallen to their lot, of some advantages
which they wished, and thought themselves
intitled, to possess. Though this should
not embitter their disposition; though it
should create the uneasiness only, without
the malignity, of envy; yet still it is a dis∣turbed
state of mind; and always borders
upon, if it actually include not, some vi∣cious
affections. In order, as far as pos∣sible,
to remedy this evil, I shall now con∣sider
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
what are the most general grounds of
the envy which men are apt to bear to
others; and shall examine what foundation
they afford, for any degree of this trouble∣some
and dangerous passion.—The chief
grounds of envy may be reduced to three:
Accomplishments of mind; advantages of
birth, rank, and fortune; superior success
in worldly pursuits.</P>
<P>I. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, or endowments
of the mind. The chief endowment for
which man deserves to be valued, is virtue.
This, unquestionably, forms the most esti∣mable
distinction among mankind. Yet
this, which may appear surprising, never
forms any ground of envy. No man is
envied for being more just, more generous,
more patient, or forgiving, than others.
This may, in part, be owing to virtue pro∣ducing
in every one who beholds it, that
high degree of respect and love, which ex∣tinguishes
envy. But probably, it is more
owing to the good opinion which every
one entertains of his own moral qualities.
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
Some virtues, or, at least, the seeds of them,
he finds within his breast. Others, he vain∣ly
attributes to himself. Those in which
he is plainly deficient, he undervalues; as
either not real virtues, or virtues of very
inferior rank; and rests satisfied, that, on
the whole, he is as worthy and respectable
as his neighbour.</P>
<P>The case is different, with regard to those
mental abilities and powers which are a∣scribed
to others. As long as these are ex∣erted
in a sphere of action remote from
ours, and not brought into competition
with talents of the same kind, to which we
have pretensions, they create no jealousy.
They are viewed as distant objects, in
which we have not any concern. It is not
until they touch our own line, and appear
to rival us in what we wish to excel, that
they awaken envy. Even then, envy is,
properly speaking, not grounded on the
talents of others. For here, too, our self-complacency
brings us relief; from the
persuasion, that were we thoroughly known,
and full justice done to us, our abilities
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>
would be found not inferior to those of
our rivals. What properly occasions envy,
is the fruit of the accomplishments of
others; the pre-eminence which the opi∣nion
of the world bestows, or which we
dread it will bestow, on their talents above
ours. Hence, distinguished superiority in
genius, learning, eloquence, or any other
of those various arts that attract the no∣tice
of the world, often become painful
grounds of envy; not indeed to all indif∣ferently,
but to those who follow the same
line of pursuit. Mere rivality, inspired by
emulation, would carry no reproach; were
not that rivality joined with obliquity, and
a malignant spirit; did it not lead to se∣cret
detraction, and unfair methods of di∣minishing
the reputation of others. Too
frequently has such a spirit tarnished the
character of those who sought to shine in
the elegant arts; and who, otherwise, had a
just title to fame.—Let such as are ad∣dicted
to this infirmity consider, how much
they degrade themselves. Superior merit,
of any kind, always rests on itself. Con∣scious
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
of what it deserves, it disdains low
competitions and jealousies. They who
are stung with envy, especially when they
allow its malignity to appear, confess a sense
of their own inferiority; and, in effect, pay
homage to that merit from which they en∣deavour
to detract.</P>
<P>But in order to eradicate the passion,
and to cure the disquiet which it creates,
let such persons farther consider, how in∣considerable
the advantage is which their
rivals have gained, by any superiority over
them. They whom you envy, are them∣selves
inferior to others who follow the
same pursuits. For how few, how very
few, have reached the summit of excel∣lence,
in the art or study which they cul∣tivate?
Even that degree of excellence
which they have attained, how seldom is
it allowed to them by the world, till after
they die? Public applause is the most fluc∣tuating,
and uncertain, of all rewards. Ad∣mired,
as they may be, by a circle of their
friends, they have to look up to others,
who stand above them in public opinion;
<PB N="157" REF="166"/>
and undergo the same mortifications which
you suffer in looking up to them. Con∣sider
what labour it has cost them to arrive
at that degree of eminence they have gain∣ed;
and after all their labour, how im∣perfect
their recompence is at last. With∣in
what narrow bounds is their fame con∣fined?
With what a number of humilia∣tions
is it mixed? To how many are they
absolutely unknown? Among those who
know them, how many censure and decry
them?—Attending fairly to these consi∣derations,
the envious might come in the
end to discern, that the fame acquired by
any accomplishment of the mind, by all
that skill can contrive, or genius can exe∣cute,
amounts to no more than a small ele∣vation;
raises rhe possessor to such an in∣considerable
height above the crowd, that
others may, without disquiet, sit down con∣tented
with their own mediocrity.</P>
<P>II. ADVANTAGES of fortune, superiority
in birth, rank and riches, even qualifica∣tions
of body and form, become grounds
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
of envy. Among external advantages,
those which relate to the body ought cer∣tainly,
in the comparative estimation of
ourselves and others, to hold the lowest
place; as in the acquisition of them we
can claim no merit, but must ascribe them
entirely to the gift of nature. Yet envy
has often showed itself here in full malig∣nity;
though a small measure of reflection
might have discovered, that there was little
or no ground for this passion to arise. It
would have proved a blessing to multi∣tudes,
to have wanted those advantages for
which they are envied. How frequently,
for instance, has Beauty betrayed the pos∣sessors
of it into many a snare, and brought
upon them many a disaster? Beheld with
spiteful eyes by those who are their rivals,
they, in the mean time, glow with no less
envy against others by whom they are sur∣passed;
while, in the midst of their com∣petitions,
jealousies, and concealed enmi∣ties,
the fading flower is easily blasted;
shortlived at the best; and trifling, at any
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
rate, in comparison with the higher, and
more lasting beauties of the mind.</P>
<P>But of all the grounds of envy among
men, superiority in rank and fortune is
the most general. Hence, the malignity
which the poor commonly bear to the
rich, as ingrossing to themselves all the
comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with
which persons of inferior station scrutinise
those who are above them in rank; and if
they approach to that rank, their envy is ge∣nerally
strongest against such as are just one
step higher than themselves.—Alas! my
friends, all this envious disquietude, which
agitates the world, arises from a deceitful
figure which imposes on the public view.
False colours are hung out: the real state
of men is not, what it seems to be. The
order of society requires a distinction of
ranks to take place; but in point of hap∣piness,
all men come much nearer to equa∣lity
than is commonly imagined; and the
circumstances, which form any material
difference of happiness among them, are not
of that nature which renders them grounds
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
of envy. The poor man possesses not, it
is true, some of the conveniences and
pleasures of the rich; but, in return, he
is free of many embarrassments to which
they are subject. By the simplicity and
uniformity of his life, he is delivered from
that variety of cares, which perplex those
who have great affairs to manage, intricate
plans to pursue, many enemies, perhaps, to
encounter in the pursuit. In the tranquil∣lity
of his small habitation, and private
family, he enjoys a peace which is often
unknown at courts. The gratifications of
nature, which are always the most satis∣factory,
are possessed by him to their full
extent; and if he be a stranger to the re∣fined
pleasures of the wealthy, he is un∣acquainted
also with the desire of them,
and by consequence, feels no want. His
plain meal satisfies his appetite, with a re∣lish,
probably, higher than that of the rich
man, who sits down to his luxurious ban∣quet.
His sleep is more sound; his health
more firm; he knows not what spleen,
languor, or listlessness are. His accustom∣ed
<PB N="161" REF="170"/>
employments or labours are not more
oppressive to him, than the labour of at∣tendance
on courts and the great, the la∣bours
of dress, the fatigue of amusements,
the very weight of idleness, frequently are
to the rich. In the mean time, all the
beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoy∣ments
of domestic society, all the gaiety
and chearfulness of an easy mind, are as
open to him as to those of the highest
rank. The splendour of retinue, the sound
of titles, the appearances of high respect,
are indeed soothing, for a short time, to
the great. But become familiar, they are
soon forgotten. Custom effaces their im∣pression.
They sink into the rank of those
ordinary things, which daily recur, without
raising any sensation of joy.—Cease, there∣fore,
from looking up with discontent and
envy to those whom birth or fortune have
placed above you. Adjust the balance of
happiness fairly. When you think of the
enjoyments you want, think also of the
troubles from which you are free. Allow
their just value to the comforts you pos∣sess;
<PB N="162" REF="171"/>
and you will find reason to rest sa∣tisfied,
with a very moderate, though not
an opulent and splendid, condition of for∣tune.
Often, did you know the whole,
you would be inclined to pity the state of
those whom you now envy.</P>
<P>III. SUPERIOR success in the course of
worldly pursuits, is a frequent ground of
envy. Among all ranks of men, compe∣titions
arise. Wherever any favourite ob∣ject
is pursued in common, jealousies sel∣dom
fail to take place among those who
are equally desirous of attaining it; as in
that ancient instance of envy recorded of
Joseph's brethren, who <HI>hated their brother,
because their father loved him more than all
the rest</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxvii. 4.</NOTE>. “I could easily bear,” says one,
“that some others should be more repu∣table
or famous, should be richer or
greater, than I. It is but just, that this
man should enjoy the distinction to
which his splendid abilities have raised
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
him. It is natural for that man, to
command the respect to which he is in∣titled
by his birth or his rank. But
when I, and another, have started in the
race of life, upon equal terms, and in
the same rank; that he, without any
pretension to uncommon merit, should
have suddenly so far outstripped me;
should have ingrossed all that public fa∣vour
to which I am no less intitled than
he; this is, what I cannot bear; my
blood boils, my spirit swells with indig∣nation,
at this undeserved treatment I
have suffered from the world.” Com∣plaints
of this nature are often made, by
them who seek to justify the envy which
they bear to their more prosperous neigh∣bours.
But if such persons wish not to be
thought unjust, let me desire them to in∣quire,
whether they have been altogether
fair in the comparison they have made of
their own merit with that of their rivals;
and whether they have not themselves to
blame, more than the world, for being left
behind in the career of fortune. The world
<PB N="164" REF="173"/>
is not always blind or unjust, in conferring
its favours. Instances indeed, sometimes,
occur, of deserving persons prevented, by a
succession of cross incidents, from rising
into public acceptance. But, in the ordi∣nary
course of things, merit, sooner or later,
receives a reward; while the greater part
of men's misfortunes and disappointments
can, generally, be traced to some misconduct
of their own. <HI>Wisdom bringeth to honour:
The hand of the diligent maketh rich;</HI> and, it
has been said, not altogether without rea∣son,
that, of his own fortune in life, every
man is the chief artificer. If Joseph was
preferred by the father to all his brethren,
his subsequent conduct showed how well
he merited the preference.</P>
<P>Supposing, however, the world to have
been unjust, in an uncommon degree, with
regard to you, this will not vindicate ma∣lignity
and envy towards a more pros∣perous
competitor. You may accuse the
world; but what reason have you to bear
ill-will to him, who has only improved the
favour which the world showed him? If,
<PB N="165" REF="174"/>
by means that are unfair, he has risen;
and, to advance himself, has acted inju∣riously
by you, resentment is justifiable;
but if you cannot accuse him of any such
improper conduct, his success alone gives
no sanction to your envy. You, perhaps,
preferred the enjoyment of your ease, to the
stir of a busy, or to the cares of a thought∣ful
life. Retired from the world, and fol∣lowing
your favourite inclinations, you were
not always attentive to seize the opportu∣nities
which offered, for doing justice to
your character, and improving your situa∣tion.
Ought you then to complain, if the
more active and laborious have acquired
what you were negligent to gain? Consi∣der,
that if you have obtained less prefer∣ment,
you have possessed more indulgence
and ease. Consider, moreover, that the ri∣val
to whom you look up with repining
eyes, though more fortunate in the world,
may perhaps, on the whole, not be more
happy than you. He has all the vicissi∣tudes
of the world before him. He may
have much to encounter, much to suffer,
<PB N="166" REF="175"/>
from which you are protected by the great∣er
obscurity of your station. Every situa∣tion
in life, has both a bright and a dark
side. Let not your attention dwell only
on what is bright on the side of those you
envy, and dark on your own. But bring∣ing
into view both sides of your respective
conditions, estimate fairly the sum of fe∣licity.</P>
<P>THUS I have suggested several consider∣ations,
for evincing the unreasonableness of
that disquietude which envy raises in our
breasts; considerations, which tend at least
to mitigate and allay the workings of this
malignant passion, and which, in a sober
mind, ought totally to extinguish it. The
scope of the whole has been, to promote,
in every one, contentment with his own
state. Many arguments of a different na∣ture
may be employed against envy; some
taken from its sinful and criminal nature;
some, from the mischiefs to which it gives
rise in the world; others, from the misery
which it produces to him who nourishes
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
this viper in his bosom. But, undoubted∣ly,
the most efficacious arguments, are such
as show, that the circumstances of others,
compared with our own, afford no ground
for envy. The mistaken ideas which are
entertained, of the high importance of cer∣tain
worldly advantages and distinctions,
form the principal cause of our repining
at our own lot, and envying that of others.
To things light in themselves, our imagi∣nation
has added undue weight. Did we
allow reflection and wisdom to correct the
prejudices which we have imbibed, and to
disperse those phantoms of our own creating,
the gloom which overcasts us would gra∣dually
vanish. Together with returning
contentment, the sky would clear up, and
every object brighten around us. It is in
the sullen and dark shade of discontent,
that noxious passions, like venomous ani∣mals,
breed, and prey upon the heart.</P>
<P>ENVY is a passion of so odious a nature,
that not only it is concealed as much as
possible from the world, but every man is
<PB N="168" REF="177"/>
glad to dissemble the appearances of it to
his own heart. Hence, it is apt to grow
upon him unperceived. Let him who is
desirous to keep his heart chaste and pure
from its influence, examine himself strictly
on those dispositions which he bears to∣wards
his prosperous neighbours. Does he
ever view, with secret uneasiness, the merit
of others rising into notice and distinction?
Does he hear their praises with unwilling
ear? Does he feel an inclination to depre∣ciate,
what he dares not openly blame?
When obliged to commend, does his cold
and aukward approbation, insinuate his be∣lief
of some unkown defects in the ap∣plauded
character? From such syptoms
as these, he may infer that the disease of
envy is forming; that the poison is be∣ginning
to spread its infection over his
heart.</P>
<P>THE causes that nourish envy are prin∣cipally
two; and which, very frequent∣ly,
operate in conjunction; these are, pride
and indolence. The connection of pride
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
with envy, is obvious and direct. The high
value which the proud set on their own
merit, the unreasonable claims which they
form on the world, and the injustice which
they suppose to be done to them by any prefe∣rence
given to others, are perpetual sources,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rst of discontent, and next of envy. When
indolence is joined to pride, the disease of
the mind becomes more inveterate and in∣curable.
Pride leads men to claim more
than they deserve. Indolence prevents them
from obtaining what they might justly
claim. Disappointments follow; and spleen,
malignity, and envy, rage within them.
The proud and indolent, are always envi∣ous.
Wrapt up in their own importance,
they sit still, and repine, because others are
more prosperous than they; while, with
all their high opinion of themselves, they
have done nothing either to deserve, or to
acquire, prosperity. As, therefore, we va∣lue
our virtue, or our peace, let us guard
against these two evil dispositions of mind.
Let us be modest in our own esteem, and,
by diligence and industry, study to acquire
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
the esteem of others. So shall we shut up
the avenues that lead to many a bad pas∣sion;
and shall learn, <HI>in whatsoever state we
are, therewith to be content.</HI></P>
<P>FINALLY, in order to subdue envy, let
us bring often into view those religion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
considerations which regard us particularly
as Christians. Let us remember how un∣worthy
we all are in the sight of God; and
how much the blessings which each of us
enjoy, are beyond what we deserve. Let us
nourish reverence and submission to that
Divine government, which has appointed
to every one such a condition in the world
as is fittest for him to possess. Let us re∣collect
how opposite the Christian spirit is
to envy; and what sacred obligations it
lays upon us, to walk in love and charity
towards one another. Indeed, when we
reflect on the many miseries which abound
in human life; on the scanty proportion of
happiness which any man is here allowed
to enjoy; on the small difference which the
diversity of fortune makes on that scanty
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
proportion; it is surprising, that envy should
ever have been a prevalent passion among
men, much more that it should have pre∣vailed
among Christians. Where so much
is suffered in common, little room is left
for envy. There is more occasion for pity
and sympathy, and inclination to assist each
other. To our own good endeavours for
rectifying our dispositions, let us not forget
to add serious prayers to the Author of our
being, that he who made the heart of man,
and knows all its infirmities, would tho∣roughly
purify our hearts from a passion so
base, and so criminal, as envy. <HI>Create in me,
O God, a clean heart; and renew a right spi∣rit
within me. Search me, and know my
heart. Try me, and know my thoughts. See
if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
me in the way everlasting</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. li. 10.; cxxxix. 23. 24.</NOTE>.</P>

<Q>—Why stand ye here all the day idle?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is an observation which naturally oc∣curs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IX.</NOTE>
and has been often made, that all
the representations of the Christian life in
scripture are taken from active scenes;
from carrying on a warfare, running a
race, striving to enter in at strait gate,
and, as in this context, labouring in a vine∣yard.
Hence the conclusion plainly fol∣lows,
that various active duties are requi∣red
of the Christian; and that sloth and
indolence are inconsistent with his hope of
heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="182"/>
But it has been sometimes supposed, that
industry, as far as it is matter of duty, re∣gards
our spiritual concerns and employ∣ments
only; and that one might be very
busy as a Christian, who was very idle as a
man. Hence, among some denominations of
Christians, an opinion has prevailed, that the
perfection of religion was to be found in
those monastic retreats, where every active
function of civil life was totally excluded,
and the whole time of men filled up with
exercises of devotion. They who hold such
opinions proceed on the supposition, that
religion has little or no concern with the
ordinary affairs of the world; that its du∣ties
stand apart by themselves; and mingle
not in the intercourse which men have with
one another. The perfect Christian was
imagined to live a sort of angelic life, se∣questered
from the business or pleasures
of this contemptible state. The gospel, on
the contrary, represents the religion of
Christ as intended for the benefit of human
society. It assumes men as engaged in the
business of active life; and directs its ex∣hortations,
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
accordingly, to all ranks and
stations; to the magistrate and the subject,
to the master and the servant, to the rich
and the poor, to them that buy and them
that sell, them <HI>that use</HI> and them <HI>that abuse</HI>
the world. Some duties, indeed, require
privacy and retreat. But the most import∣ant
must be performed in the midst of the
world, where we are commanded to <HI>shine
as lights,</HI> and <HI>by our good works to glorify
our Father which is in heaven.</HI> This world,
as the context represents it, is God's vine∣yard,
where each of us has a task assigned
him to perform. In every station, and at
every period of life, labour is required. At
the third, the sixth, or the eleventh hour,
we are commanded to work, if we would
not incur, from the great Lord of the vine∣yard,
this reproof, <HI>Why stand ye here all the
day idle?</HI>—We may, I confess, be busy
about many things, and yet be found ne∣gligent
of the <HI>One thing needful.</HI> We may
be very active, and, withal, very ill employ∣ed.
But though a person may be indu∣strious
without being religious, I must at
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
the same time admonish you, that no man
can be idle without being sinful. This I
shall endeavour to show in the sequel of the
discourse; wherein I purpose to reprove a
vice which is too common among all ranks
of men. Superiors admonish their infe∣riors,
and parents tell their children, that
idleness is the mother of every sin; while,
in their own practice, they often set the
example of what they reprobate severely in
others. I shall study to show, that the idle
man is, in every view, both foolish, and
criminal; that he neither lives to God;
nor lives to the world; nor lives to him∣self.</P>
<P>I. HE lives not to God. The great and
wise Creator certainly does nothing in vain.
A small measure of reflection might con∣vince
every one, that for some useful pur∣pose
he was sent into the world. The na∣ture
of man bears no mark of insignifican∣cy,
or neglect. He is placed at the head
of all things here below. He is furnished
with a great preparation of faculties and

powers. He is enlightened by reason with
many important discoveries; even taught
by revelation to consider himself as ranso∣med,
by the death of Christ, from misery;
and intended to rise, by gradual advances,
to a still higher rank in the universe of
God. In such a situation, thus distin∣guished,
thus favoured and assisted by his
Creator, can he hope to be forgiven, if he
aim at no improvement, if he pursue no
useful design, live for no other purpose but
to indulge in sloth, to consume the fruits
of the earth, and to spend his days in a
dream of vanity? Existence is a sacred
trust; and he who thus misemploys, and
squanders it away, is treacherous to its Au∣thor.
—Look around you, and you will
behold the whole universe full of active
powers. Action is, to speak so, the genius
of nature. By motion and exertion, the sy∣stem
of being is preserved in vigour. By
its different parts always acting in subordi∣nation
one to another, the perfection of the
whole is carried on. The heavenly bodies
perpetually revolve. Day and night inces∣santly
<PB N="177" REF="190"/>
repeat their appointed course. Con∣tinual
operations are going on in the earth,
and in the waters. Nothing stands still.
All is alive, and stirring, throughout the
universe.—In the midst of this animated
and busy scene, is man alone to remain
idle in his place? Belongs it to him, to be
the sole inactive and slothful being in the
creation, when he has so much allotted
him to do; when in so many various ways
he might improve his own nature; might
advance the glory of the God who made
him; and contribute his part to the gene∣ral
good?</P>
<P>Hardly is there any feeling of the hu∣man
heart more natural, or more univer∣sal,
than that of our being accountable to
God. It is, what the most profligate can
never totally erase. Almost all nations have
agreed in the belief, that there is to come
some period, when the Almighty will act
as the judge of his creatures. Presenti∣ments
of this, work in every breast. Con∣science
has already erected a tribunal, on
which it anticipates the sentence which at
<PB N="178" REF="191"/>
that period shall be passed. Before this tri∣bunal
let us sometimes place ourselves in
serious thought, and consider what account
we are prepared to give of our conduct to
Him who made us. “I placed you,” the
great Judge may then be supposed to say,
“in a station where you had many occa∣sions
action, and many opportunities
of improvement. You were taught, and
you knew, your duty. Throughout a
course of years I continued your life. I
surrounded you with friends, to whom
you might be useful. I gave you health,
ease, leisure, and various advantages of
situation.—Where are the fruits of
those talents which you possessed? What
good have you done with them to your∣selves?
what good, to others? How
have you filled up your place, or answer∣ed
your destination, in the world? Pro∣duce
some evidence, of your not having
existed altogether ill vain?”—Let such
as are now mere blanks in the world, and
a burden to the earth, think what answer
they will give to those awful questions.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="192"/>
II. THE idle live not to the world, and
their fellow-creatures around them, any
more than they do to God. Had any man
a title to stand alone, and to be independ∣ent
of his fellows, he might then consider
himself as at liberty to indulge in solitary
ease and sloth, without being responsible
to others for the manner in which he
chose to live. But, on the face of the
earth, there is no such person, from the
King on his throne, to the beggar in his
cottage. We are all connected with one
another, by various relations; which create
at chain of mutual dependence, reaching
from the highest, to the lowest station in
society. The order and happiness of the
world cannot be maintained, without a per∣petual
circulation of active duties and of∣fices,
which all are called upon to perform
in their turn. Superiors are no more inde∣pendent
of their inferiors, than these infe∣riors
are of them. Each have demands
and claims upon the other; and he, who
in any situation of life, refuses to act his
part, and to contribute his share to the ge∣neral
<PB N="180" REF="193"/>
stock of felicity, deserves to be pro∣scribed
from society, as an unworthy mem∣ber.
<HI>If any man will not work,</HI> says the A∣postle
Paul, <HI>neither should he eat</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. iii. 10.</NOTE>. If he
will do nothing to advance the purposes of
society, he has no title to enjoy the advan∣tages
of it.</P>
<P>It is sometimes supposed, that industry
and diligence are duties required of the
poor alone, and that riches confer the pri∣vilege
of being idle. This is so far from
being justified by reason, how often soever
it may obtain in fact, that the higher one
is raised in the world, his obligation to be
useful is proportionably increased. The
claims upon him, from various quarters,
multiply. The sphere of his active duties
widens on every hand. Even supposing
him exempted from exerting himself in be∣half
of his inferiors, supposing the relation
between superiors and inferiors abolished,
the relation among equals must still subsist.
If there be no man, however high in rank,
who stands not frequently in need of the
<PB N="181" REF="194"/>
good offices of his friends, does he think
that he owes nothing to them in return?
Can he fold his arms in selfish indolence,
and expect to be served by others, if he
will not exert himself, in doing service to
any?—Were there no other call to indu∣stry,
but the relation in which every one
stands to his own family, the remembrance
of this alone, should make the man of idle∣ness
blush. Pretends he to love those with
whom he is connected by the dearest ties,
and yet will he not bestir himself for their
guidance, their support, or their advance∣ment
in the world? How immoral, and
cruel, is the part he acts, who slumbers in
sensual ease, while the wants and demands
of a helpless family cry aloud, but cry in
vain, for his vigorous exertions? Is this a
husband, is this a father, that deserves to
be honoured with those sacred names?
How many voices will be lifted up against
him, at the last day? Let such persons re∣member
the awful words of scripture, and
tremble. It is written in the First Epistle
to Timothy, the fifth chapter, and eighth
<PB N="182" REF="195"/>
verse, <HI>If any provide not for his own, and
specially for those of his own house, he hath
denied the faith, and is worse than an infi∣del.</HI></P>
<P>III. THE idle man lives not to himself,
with any more advantage than he lives to
the world. It is indeed on a supposition
entirely opposite, that persons of this cha∣racter
proceed. They imagine that, how
deficient soever they may be in point of
duty, they at least consult their own satis∣faction.
They leave to others the drudge∣ry
of life; and betake themselves, as they
think, to the quarter of enjoyment and
ease. Now, in contradiction to this, I as∣sert,
and hope to prove, that the idle man,
first, shuts the door against all improve∣ment;
next, that he opens it wide to every
destructive folly; and, lastly, that he ex∣cludes
himself from the true enjoyment of
pleasure.</P>
<P>FIRST, He shuts the door against im∣provement
of every kind, whether of mind,
<PB N="183" REF="196"/>
body, or fortune. The law of our nature,
the condition under which we were placed
from our birth, is, that nothing good or
great is to be acquired, without toil and in∣dustry.
A price is appointed by Provi∣dence
to be paid for every thing; and the
price of improvement, is labour. Indu∣stry
may, indeed, be sometimes disappointed.
<HI>The race</HI> may not be always <HI>to the swift,</HI>
nor <HI>the battle to the strong.</HI> But, at the
same time, it is certain that, in the ordi∣nary
course of things, without strength,
the battle cannot be gained; without swift∣ness,
the race cannot be run with success.
<HI>In all labour,</HI> says the wise man, <HI>there is
profit; but the soul of the sluggard desireth,
and hath nothing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 23.; xiii. 4.</NOTE>. If we consult either
the improvement of the mind, or the health
of the body, it is well known that exercise
is the great instrument of promoting both.
Sloth enfeebles equally the bodily, and the
mental powers. As in the animal system
it engenders disease, so on the faculties of
<PB N="184" REF="197"/>
the soul it brings a fatal rust, which cor∣rodes
and wastes them; which, in a short
time, reduces the brightest genius to the
same level with the meanest understanding.
The great differences which take place a∣mong
men, are not owing to a distinction
that nature has made in their original
powers, so much as to the superior dili∣gence
with which some have improved
these powers beyond others. To no pur∣pose
do we possess the seeds of many great
abilities, if they are suffered to lie dormant
within us. It is not the latent possession,
but the active exertion of them, which
gives them merit. Thousands whom in∣dolence
has sunk into contemptible obscu∣rity,
might have come forward to the high∣est
distinction, if idleness had not frustra∣ted
the effect of all their powers.</P>
<P>Instead of going on to improvement, all
things go to decline, with the idle man.
His character falls into contempt. His for∣tune
is consumed. Disorder, confusion,
and embarrassment, mark his whole situa∣tion.
Observe in what lively colours the
<PB N="185" REF="198"/>
state of his affairs is described by Solomon.
<HI>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the
vineyard of the man void of understanding.
And lo! it was all grown over with thorns;
and nettles had covered the face thereof; and
the stone wall thereof was broken down.
Then I saw and considered it well. I looked
upon it, and received instruction</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv. 30. 31. 32.</NOTE>. In the
midst, too, of those distresses which idle∣ness
brings on its votaries, they must sub∣mit
to innumerable mortifications, which
never fail to attend their shameful conduct.
They must reckon, on seeing themselves
contemned by the virtuous and wise, and
slighted by the thriving part of mankind.
They must expect to be left behind by eve∣ry
competitor for rank or fortune. They
will be obliged to humble themselves be∣fore
persons, now far their superiors in the
world, whom, once, they would have dis∣dained
to acknowledge as their equals.—
Is it in this manner, that a man lives to
himself? Are these the advantages, which
<PB N="186" REF="199"/>
were expected to be found in the lap of ease?
The down may at first have appear∣ed
soft: But it will soon be found to cover
thorns innumerable. <HI>How long wilt thou
sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out
of thy sleep? Yet a little sleep; yet a little
slumber, a little folding of the bands to sleep.
So shall thy poverty come as one that travel∣leth;
and thy want as an armed man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv. 33. 34.</NOTE>.—
But this is only a small part of the evils
which persons of this description bring on
themselves: For,</P>
<P>IN the second place, while in this man∣ner
they shut the door against every im∣provement,
they open it wide to the most
destructive vices and follies. The hu∣man
mind cannot remain always unem∣ployed.
Its passions must have some exer∣cise.
If we supply them not with proper
employment, they are sure to run loose
into riot and disorder. While we are un∣occupied
by what is good, evil is continu∣ally
<PB N="187" REF="200"/>
at hand; and hence it is said in Scrip∣ture,
that as soon as Satan <HI>found the house
empty,</HI> he took possession, and filled it <HI>with evil spirits</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 44.</NOTE>. Every man who recollects
his conduct, may be satisfied, that his
hours of idleness have always proved the
hours most dangerous to virtue. It was
then, that criminal desires arose; guilty
pursuits were suggested; and designs were
formed, which, in their issue, have dis∣quieted
and embittered his whole life. If
seasons of idleness be dangerous, what must
a continued habit of it prove? Habitual
indolence, by a silent and secret progress,
undermines every virtue in the soul. More
violent passions run their course, and ter∣minate.
They are like rapid torrents, which
foam, and swell, and bear down every
thing before them. But after having over∣flowed
their banks, their impetuosity sub∣sides.
They return, by degrees, into their
natural channel; and the damage which
they have done, can be repaired. Sloth is
<PB N="188" REF="201"/>
like the slowly-flowing, putrid stream, which stagnates in the marsh, breeds veno∣mous
animals, and poisonous plants; and
infects with pestilential vapours the whole
country round it. Having once tainted
the soul, it leaves no part of it sound; and,
at the same time, gives not those alarms
to conscience, which the eruptions of bold∣er
and fiercer emotions often occasion. The
disease which it brings on, is creeping and
insidious; and is, on that account, more
certainly mortal.</P>
<P>One constant effect of idleness, is to nou∣rish
the passions, and, of course, to height∣en
our demands for gratification; while it
unhappily withdraws from us the proper
means of gratifying these demands. If the
desires of the industrious man be set upon
opulence or rank, upon the conveniencies,
or the splendour of life, he can accomplish
his desires, by methods which are fair and
allowable. The idle man has the same de∣sires
with the industrious, but not the same
resources for compassing his ends by ho∣nourable
means. He must therefore turn
<PB N="189" REF="202"/>
himself to seek by fraud, or by violence,
what he cannot submit to acquire by in∣dustry.
Hence, the origin of those multi∣plied
crimes to which idleness is daily gi∣ving
birth in the world; and which con∣tribute
so much to violate the order, and
to disturb the peace, of society.—In gene∣ral,
the children of idleness may be rank∣ed
under two denominations or classes of
men; both of whom may, too justly, be
termed, The children of the devil. Either,
incapable of any effort, they are such as sink
into absolute meanness of character, and
contentedly wallow with the drunkard and
debauchee, among the herd of the sensual;
until poverty overtake them, or disease cut
them off; Or, they are such as, retaining
some remains of vigour, are impelled, by
their passions, to venture on a desperate at∣tempt
for retrieving their ruined fortunes.
In this case, they employ the art of the
fraudulent gamester to ensnare the un∣wary.
They issue forth with the high∣wayman
to plunder on the road; or with
the thief and the robber, they infest the
<PB N="190" REF="203"/>
city by night. From this class, our pri∣sons
are peopled; and by them the scaffold
is furnished with those melancholy admo∣nitions,
which are so often delivered from it
to the crowd. Such are frequently the tra∣gical,
but well known, consequences of the
vice against which I now warn you.</P>
<P>IN the third, and last place, how dangerous
soever idleness may be to virtue,
are there not pleasures, it may be said
which attend it? Is there not ground to
plead, that it brings a release from the op∣pressive
cares of the world; and sooths the
mind with a gentle satisfaction, which is
not to be found amidst the toils of a busy
and active life?—This is an advantage
which, least of all others, we admit it to
possess. In behalf of incessant labour, no
man contends. Occasional release from toil,
and indulgence of ease, is what nature de∣mands,
and virtue allows. But what we
assert is, that nothing is so great an enemy
to the lively and spirited enjoyment of life,
as a relaxed and indolent habit of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="204"/>
He who knows not what it is to labour,
knows not what it is to enjoy. The feli∣city
of human life, depends on the regular
profecution of some laudable purpose or
object, which keeps awake and enlivens all
our powers. Our happiness consists in the
pursuit, much more than in the attainment,
of any temporal good. Rest is agreeable;
but it is only from preceding labours, that
rest acquires its true relish. When the
mind is suffered to remain in continued
inaction, all its powers decay. It soon lan∣guishes
and sickens; and the pleasures
which it proposed to obtain from rest, end
in tediousness and insipidity. To this, let
that miserable set of men bear witness,
who, after spending great part of their life
in active industry, have retired to what
they fancied was to be a pleasing enjoy∣ment
of themselves, in wealthy inacti∣vity;
and profound repose. Where they
expected to find an elysium, they have
found nothing but a dreary and com∣fortless
waste. Their days have dragged
on, in uniform languor; with the melan∣choly
<PB N="192" REF="205"/>
remembrance often returning, of the
chearful hours they passed, when they were
engaged in the honest business, and labours
of the world.</P>
<P>We appeal to every one who has the least
knowledge or observation of life, whether
the busy, or the idle, have the most agree∣able
enjoyment of themselves? Compare
them in their families. Compare them
in the societies with which they mingle;
and remark, which of them discover most
chearfulness and gaiety; which possess the
most regular flow of spirits; whose temper
is most equal; whose good humour, most
unclouded. While the active and diligent
both enliven, and enjoy, society, the idle
are not only a burden to themselves, but a
burden to those with whom they are con∣nected;
a nuisance to all whom they op∣press
with their company. On whom does
time hang so heavy, as on the slothful and
lazy? To whom are the hours so linger∣ing?
Who are so often devoured with
spleen, and obliged to fly to every expedi∣ent
which can help them to get rid of
<PB N="193" REF="206"/>
themselves? Instead of producing tran∣quillity,
indolence produces a fretful rest∣lessness
of mind; gives rise to cravings
which are never satisfied; nourishes a sick∣ly
effeminate delicacy, which sours and cor∣rupts
every pleasure.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has now been said to convince
every thinking person, of the folly, the
guilt, and the misery, of an idle state. Let
these admonitions stir us up, to exert our∣selves
in our different occupations, with
that virtuous activity which becomes men
and Christians. Let us arise from the bed
of sloth; distribute our time with attention
and care; and improve to advantage the
opportunities which Providence has bestow∣ed.
The material business in which our
several stations engage us, may often prove
not sufficient to occupy the whole of our
time and attention. In the life even of
busy men, there are frequent intervals of
leisure. Let them take care, that into
these, none of the vices of idleness creep.
Let some secondary, some subsidiary em∣ployment,
<PB N="194" REF="207"/>
of fair and laudable kind, be
always at hand to fill up those vacant spaces
of life, which too many assign, either to
corrupting amusements, or to mere ina∣ction.
We ought never to forget, that en∣tire
idleness always borders, either on mi∣sery,
or on guilt.</P>
<P>AT the same time, let the course of our
employments be ordered in such a manner,
that in carrying them on, we may be also
promoting our eternal interest. With the
business of the world, let us properly in∣termix
the exercises of devotion. By reli∣gious
duties, and virtuous actions, let us stu∣dy
to prepare ourselves for a better world.
In the midst of our labours for this life, it is
never to be forgotten, that we must <HI>first
seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;</HI>
and <HI>give diligence to make our calling and
election sure.</HI> Otherwise, how active soever
we may seem to be, our whole activity will
prove only a laborious idleness: We shall
appear in the end, to have been busy to no
purpose, or to a purpose worse than none.
<PB N="195" REF="208"/>
Then only we fulfil the proper character of
Christians, when we join that pious zeal
which becomes us as the servants of God,
with that industry which is required of
us, as good members of society; when, ac∣cording
to the exhortation of the Apostle,
we are found <HI>not slothful in business,</HI> and, at
the same time, <HI>servent in spirit, serving the
Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 11.</NOTE>.</P>

every where around us the traces of
that supreme goodness, which enlivens and
supports the universe. <HI>Day uttereth speech
of it to day; and night showeth knowledge of
it to night.</HI> Yet, surrounded as we are with
the perfections of God, meeting him where∣ever
we go, and called upon by a thousand
objects, to confess his presence, it is both the
misfortune and the crime of a great part
<PB N="197" REF="210"/>
of mankind, that they are strangers to Him
in whose world they dwell. Occupied with
nothing but their pursuits of interest and
pleasure, they pass through this world, as
though God were not there. The virtu∣ous
and reflecting, are particularly distin∣guished
from the giddy and dissolute, by
that habitual sense of the divine presence
which characterises the former. To them,
nothing appears void of God. They con∣template
his perfections in the works of
nature; and they trace his Providence in
the incidents of life. When retired from
the world, he often employs their medita∣tion.
When engaged in action, he always
influences their conduct. Wherever a pious
man is, or whatever he does, in the style
of the text, he is <HI>continually with God.</HI></P>
<P>The happy effect of this sentiment on
the heart, is fully displayed in the context.
We see it allaying all the disquiet which
the Psalmist, in the preceding verses, de∣scribes
himself to have suffered on account
of the prosperity of the wicked. The first
reflection which restored tranquillity to his
<PB N="198" REF="211"/>
mind, was the remembrance of the pre∣sence
of God. <HI>Nevertheless, I am continu∣ally
with thee; thou hast holden me by my
right hand.</HI> He became sensible, that what∣ver
distresses the righteous might suffer
for a time, they could not fail of being
compensated in the end, by that Almighty
Protector, whose propitious presence ever
continued to surround them. Whereupon
follow those memorable expressions of his
trust and joy in God. <HI>Thou shalt guide me
with thy counsel; and afterwards receive me
to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee?
and there is none upon earth I desire besides
thee.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are principally two effects, which
the sense of the divine presence is fitted to
produce upon men. One is, to restrain
them from vice; the other, to encourage
their virtue. Its operation, as a check up∣on
the sinner, is obvious. The perpetual
presence of so powerful and venerable a
witness, is one of the most awful considera∣tions
which can be addressed to the dis∣solute.
<PB N="199" REF="212"/>
It removes all the security which
secrecy can be supposed to give to crimes.
It aggravates the guilt of them, from be∣ing
committed in face of the Almighty;
and has power to strike terror into the
heart of the greatest criminal, in the midst
of his misdeeds. While this principle of
religion thus checks and terrifies the sin∣ner,
it produces also another effect, that of
strengthening and comforting the good
man, in the practice of his duty. It is the
influence of the divine presence on good
men, which, in consequence of the Psalmist's
sentiment, I purpose to consider. To their
character, it belongs to <HI>be continually with
God.</HI> I shall endeavour to show the high
benefit and comfort which they derive
from such a habit of mind; and shall, for
this end, first consider their internal moral
state; and next, view them as they are af∣fected
by several of the external accidents
and situations of life.</P>
<P>LET us begin with considering them in
their internal state. The belief of divine
<PB N="200" REF="213"/>
presence acts upon them here, first, as an
incitement to virtue. The presence of one
whom we highly esteem and revere, of a
sovereign, for instance, a father, or a friend,
whose approbation we are solicitous to gain,
is always found to exalt the powers of men,
to refine, and improve their behaviour.
Hence, it has been given as a rule by an∣cient,
moralists, that, in order to excel in
virtue, we should propound to ourselves
some person of eminent and distinguished
worth; and should accustom ourselves to
act, as if he were standing by, and behold∣ing
us. To the esteem and approbation,
of their fellow creatures, none are insen∣sible.
There are few who, in the conspi∣cuous
parts of their life, when they know
the eyes of the public to be fixed on them,
act not their part with propriety and de∣corum.
But what is the observation of the
public, what is the presence of the greatest
or wisest man on earth, to that presence of
the Divinity which constantly surrounds
us? The man who realises to his mind
this august presence, feels a constant incen∣tive
<PB N="201" REF="214"/>
for acquitting himself with dignity.
He views himself as placed on an illustri∣ous
theatre. To have the Almighty for
the spectator and witness of his conduct,
is more to him than if the whole world
were assembled to observe him. Men judge
often falsely, always imperfectly, of what
passes before them. They are imposed on
by specious appearances; and the artful
carry away the praise which is due to the
deserving. Even supposing them to judge
fairly, we may want the opportunity of
doing justice to our character, by any pro∣per
display of it in the sight of the world.
Our situation may bury in obscurity, those
talents and virtues which were intitled to
command the highest esteem. But he, in
whose presence the good man acts, in both
an impartial, and an unerring judge of
worth. No fallacious appearances impose
on him. No secret virtue is hidden from
him. He is attentive equally to the mean∣est
and the greatest; and his approbation
confers eternal rewards. The man, there∣fore,
who <HI>sets the Lord always before him,</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="215"/>
is prompted to excel in virtue by motives,
which are peculiar to himself, and which
engage, on the side of duty, both honour
and interest. <HI>I have kept thy precepts, and
thy testimonies; for all my ways are before
thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxix. 168.</NOTE></P>
<P>SUPPOSING, however, his virtuòus en∣deavours
to be faithful, many imperfect∣tions
will attend them. A faultless tenor
of unblemished life, is beyond the reach of
man. Passions will sometimes overcome
him; and ambition or interest, in an un∣guarded
hour, will turn him aside into e∣vil.
Hence, he will be ashamed of him∣self,
and disquieted by a sense of guilt and
folly. In this state, to which we are often
reduced by the weakness of human nature,
the belief of God's continual presence brings
relief to the heart. It acted before as an
animating principle. It now acts as a prin∣ciple
of comfort. In the midst of many
imperfections, a virtuous man appeals to
his divine witness, for the sincerity of his
<PB N="203" REF="216"/>
intentions. He can appeal to him who
<HI>knows his frame,</HI> that in the general train
of his conduct, it is his study to keep the
law of God.</P>
<P>Mere law, among men, is rigid and
inflexible. As no human lawgiver can
look into the hearts of his subjects, he
cannot, even though he were ever pre∣sent
with them, estimate their character
exactly. He can make no allowance for
particular situations. He must prescribe
the same terms to all whom he rules; and
treat all alike, according to their outward
actions. But every minute diversity of
character, temper, and situation, is known
to God. It is not only from what his ser∣vants
do, but from what they seek to do,
that he forms his judgement of them. He
attends to all those circumstances which
render the trial of their virtue, at any time,
peculiarly hard. He hears the whisper of
devotion as it rises in the soul. He beholds
the tear of contrition which falls in secret.
He sees the good intention struggling in
its birth; and pursues it, in its progress,
<PB N="204" REF="217"/>
through those various obstacles which may
prevent it from ripening into action. Good
men, therefore, in their most humbled and
dejected state, draw some consolation from
his knowledge of their heart. Though they
may sometimes have erred from the right
path, they can look up to him who is ever
with them, and say, as an apostle, who
had grievously offended, once said to his
great Master; <HI>Lord, thou knowest all things;
thou knowest that I love thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John, xxi. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Appealing thus to their omniscient wit∣ness,
they are naturally foothed and encou∣raged
by the hope of his clemency. At
the same time, it is the peculiar advantage
of this sentiment of the divine prefence,
that it prevents such hope from flattering
them too much, or rising into undue pre∣sumption.
For while it encourages, it tends
also to humble, a pious man. If it encou∣rage
him, by the reflection on all his good
dispositions being known and attended to
by God, it humbles him, by the remem∣brance,
<PB N="205" REF="218"/>
that <HI>his secret sins</HI> also <HI>are ever in
the light of the divine countenance.</HI> So that, by
dwelling under the sense of God being con∣tinually
with us, we keep alive the proper
temper of a Christian in the soul; humility,
without dejection; fear, mingled with hope.
We are cheared, without being lifted up.
We feel ourselves obnoxious to the all-obser∣ving
eye of justice; but are comforted with
the thoughts of that mercy which, through
Jesus Christ, the Discerner of all hearts
holds forth to the sincere and penitent.—
Such are the blessed effects which this prin∣ciple
of religion produces upon the inward
moral state of a good man. Let us now,</P>
<P>IN the second place, consider his exter∣nal
circumstances; and examine the in∣fluence
which the same principle has upon
his happiness, in several different situations
of life.</P>
<P>LET us first view him in what the world
calls prosperity; when his circumstances
are easy or affluent, and his life flows in a
<PB N="206" REF="219"/>
smooth untroubled stream. Here, it might
be thought, that a sense of the divine pre∣sence
could operate upon him only, or
chiefly, for promoting temperance, and re∣straining
the disorders incident to a prospe∣rous
state. Valuable effects, indeed, these
are; and most conducive to the true enjoy∣ment
of all that is agreeable in life. But
though it, doubtless, does exert this salu∣tary
influence, yet it stops not there. It
not only preserves the virtue of a good man
amidst the temptations of pleasure, but it
gives to his prosperity a security, and a pe∣culiar
relish, which to others is unknown.
He who is without a sense of God upon
his mind, beholds in human affairs nothing
but a perpetual fluctuation, and vicissitude
of events. He is surrounded with unknown
causes, which may be working his destruc∣tion
in secret. He cannot avoid perceiving,
that there hangs over him the irresistible
arm of that Providence, whose displeasure
he has done nothing to stay or avert. But
he who, in the day of prosperity, dwells
with God, is delivered from those disquiet∣ing
<PB N="207" REF="220"/>
alarms. He dwells as with a friend
and protector, from whom he conceives his
blessings to proceed. He can appeal to him
for the thankfulness with which he receives
them; and for his endeavours to employ
them well. He trusts, that the God whom
he serves will not forsake him; that the
goodness which he has already experienced,
will continue to bless him; and though he
believes himself not exempted from the
changes of the world, yet, in the midst of
these, he has ground to hope, that sources
of comfort and happiness shall always be
left open to him.</P>
<P>Moreover, the pleasures of life, while
they last, are unspeakably heightened by
the presence of that Benefactor who be∣stows
them. The pleasing emotion of gra∣titude
to the giver, mingles with the enjoy∣ment
of the gift. While to the mere world∣ly
man, the whole frame of nature is only
a vast irregular fabric; and the course of
human affairs no more than a confused suc∣cession
of fortuitous events; all nature is
beautified, and every agreeable incident is
<PB N="208" REF="221"/>
enlivened, to him who beholds God in all
things. Hence arise a variety of pleasing
sensations, to fill up those solitary hours, in
which external prosperity supplies him with
no entertainment. In the smiling scenes of
nature, he contemplates the benignity of
its author. In its sublime objects, he ad∣mires
his majesty. In its awful and ter∣rible
ones, he adores his power. He dwells
in this world as in a magnificent temple,
which is full of the glory of its founder;
and every where views nature offering up
its incense to him, from a thousand altars.
Such ideas exalt and ennoble the human
mind; and reflect an additional lustre on
the brightness of prosperity.</P>
<P>FROM the prosperous, let us next turn to
the afflicted condition of a good man. For,
as prosperity may, affliction certainly will,
at one time or other, be his lot. It enters
into the appointed trial of his virtue; and,
in one degree or other, is the doom of all.
Here we shall find various situations occur,
in which no relief is equal to what a vir∣tuous
<PB N="209" REF="222"/>
and holy man derives from a sense of
the perpetual presence of God.</P>
<P>Is he, for instance, thrown into an obscure
condition in the world, without friends
to assist him, or any to regard and consider
his state? He enjoys the satisfaction of
thinking, that though he may be neglected
by men, he is not forgotten by God. In∣considerable
as he is in himself, he knows,
that he will not be overlooked by the Al∣mighty,
amidst the infinite variety of be∣ing,
or lost in the immensity of his works.
The poor man can, with as much en∣couragement
as the rich or great, lift up
his eyes to heaven, and say, <HI>Nevertheless, O
Lord, I am continually with thee: Thou hold∣est
me by my right hand.</HI> The gracious pre∣sence
of that Supreme Being is affected by
no diversity of rank or fortune. It imparts
itself alike to all the virtuous and upright;
like its glorious image, the sun in the fir∣mament,
which sheds its rays equally upon
the humble cottage, and upon the palace of
Kings. In the presence of the great Lord
of heaven and earth, all the distinctions
<PB N="210" REF="223"/>
which vanity has contrived to make among
men, totally disappear. All ranks are on one
level. <HI>The rich and the poor</HI> here indeed
<HI>meet together;</HI> without any other distinction
than what arises from the heart and the soul.
The sense of this, lifts the poor man above
contempt; supports his spirits when apt to
be dejected; and bestows dignity on the
part which he acts. How inconsiderable
soever that part may appear in the estima∣tion
of an injudicious world, it is ennobled,
when virtuously performed, by the appro∣bation
of his divine witness. He can bear
with indifference the scorn of the proud,
as long as he knows, that there is one
higher than the highest to regard him.
He can enjoy himself with pleasure in
his mean habitation, because he believes
that God dwells with him there. The
Divine presence chears to him the most
lonely retreat. It accompanies his steps to
the most distant regions of the earth. If
he should be driven into exile from all his
friends, and obliged to <HI>dwell in the utter∣most
parts of the sea,</HI> even there God's <HI>hand
<PB N="211" REF="224"/>
would hold him, and his right hand would
guide him.</HI> Though left without compa∣nion
or friend, he never thinks himself de∣solate,
as long as he can say, <HI>I am still with
God.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though raised above obscurity or
poverty, yet, in any situation of fortune, ca∣lumny
and reproach may be the lot of the
servant of God. His good intentions may
be misconstructed; his character unjustly
traduced; and, to the open reviling of ene∣mies,
the more bitter unkindness of friends
may sometimes be joined. In this situa∣tion,
when wounded in spirit, and, per∣haps,
unable to make his innocence appear,
to whom shall he have recourse for defence,
to whom make his last appeal, but to that
God who is ever present with him, and
who knoweth his heart? How frequent∣ly,
amidst the injustice and oppression of
the world, has distressed innocence had no
other relief but this? “God is my wit∣ness.
God is my avenger. He hath seen
it; and he will repay.” A good con∣science,
<PB N="212" REF="225"/>
it is true, is, of itself, a powerful
support. But God is Lord of the con∣science;
and it is only when connected
with a sense of divine presence and appro∣bation,
that a good conscience becomes a
steady principle of fortitude in the mind,
under all discouragements. Hence, a vir∣tuous
man possesses a high degree of inde∣pendence,
both on the praise, and on the
censure of the world. It is enough to him,
if, when undergoing the same reproaches
which Job suffered from his mistaken
friends, he can say with him, <HI>Behold my
witness is in heaven, and my record is on
high</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job. xvi. 19.</NOTE> He affects not to divulge his good
deeds to the world. He is without con∣cern
whether the world be acquainted with
them, or not. He knoweth, that his <HI>Father
which is in heaven seeth in secret;</HI> and that
<HI>his prayers and his alms come up</HI> in grateful
<HI>memorial before him. With me, it is a small
thing to be judged of you, or of man's judge∣ment;
he that judgeth me is the Lord</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1. Cor. iv. 3. 4.</NOTE>. <HI>He
<PB N="213" REF="226"/>
shall bring forth my righteousness,</HI> at last, <HI>as
the light, and my judgement as the noon day.</HI>
In this consciousness of integrity, he looks
down with indifference, as from a superior
station, upon the harsh censures of a giddy
and ignorant world. The sense of being
continually with God diffuses over his soul
a holy calm, which unjust reproach cannot
disturb. In the presence of that august and
venerable witness, all the noise and cla∣mours
of men, like the murmurings of a distant storm,
die away.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Supposing the character of a
good man to be untainted by reproach,
supposing also his external situation to be
opulent or distinguished, many, notwith∣standing,
and severe, are the distresses to
which he may be exposed. Secret griefs
may be preying upon him; and his heart
left to feed in silence on its own bitterness.
He may labour under sore disease, and dis∣cern
his earthly frame gradually moulder∣ing
into dust. He may be deprived of those
friends and relatives who had been the
<PB N="214" REF="227"/>
chief comforts of his state; or may be ob∣liged
to prepare himself for taking farewel
of them for over. In the midst of these
various afflicting scenes of human life, no
consolation can be more powerful than
what arises from the presence of a divine
protector and guardian, to whom our case,
with all its sorrows, is perfectly known.
<HI>To him,</HI> says the psalmist, <HI>I poured out my
complaint. I showed before him my trouble.
I looked on my right hand and viewed; but
behold there was no man who cared for my
soul. I said unto thee, O Lord, thou art my
refuge. When my spirit was overwhelmed
within me, then thou knewest my path</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxlii. 2. 3. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We all know, that to communicate our
grief to a faithful friend, often gives ease
and relief to the burdened heart. Such com∣munication
we are encouraged to make, and
such relief we may expect to find, in pour∣ing
out our heart before that God <HI>in whom
compassions flow.</HI> We may have no earthly
friend to whom we can with full confi∣dence
<PB N="215" REF="228"/>
disclose all our sorrows; or we may
want words in which to express them. But
God is the searcher of all hearts; and the
hearer of all prayers. To the secret an∣guish
of the soul, he is no inattentive wit∣ness.
Every groan which is heaved from the
labouring bosom, though heard by no hu∣man
ear, reaches his throne. As he <HI>knows
our frame,</HI> so he <HI>remembers we are dust;</HI> and
thence <HI>light arises to the upright in dark∣ness.</HI>
For the hope naturally springs, that
this beneficent being will pity them, <HI>as a
father pitieth his children;</HI> and in the midst
of those distresses which the present cir∣cumstances
of man render unavoidable,
will <HI>send them help from his sanctuary.</HI> Sur∣rounded
with this compassionate presence
of the Almighty, good men never view
themselves as left in this vale of tears, to
bear, solitary and alone, the whole weight
of human woe. In their dark, as well as
in their brighter hours, God is with them.
Even in that valley of the shadow of death,
where no friend, no comforter, can go a∣long
to aid them, he is with them still. In
<PB N="216" REF="229"/>
the last extremity of nature, <HI>the rod and
staff of the Shepherd of Israel support them.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have shown, though in an im∣perfect
manner, what benefits holy men
derive from a habitual sense of the divine
presence. It animates and strengthens their
virture. It enlivens and brightens their pro∣sperity.
Under various forms of adversity,
it affords them consolation and relief.—
Such considerations, undoubtedly, form a
strong argument in favour of devout spi∣rit,
and a virtuous life. But they are con∣siderations
which may, probably, be regard∣ed
by some, as ideal and visionary; requiring
aid from a heated, or an enthusiastic fancy,
in order to give them force. I readily ad∣mit,
that amidst the hurry and turbu∣lence
of the world, it may be difficult to
bring these religious sentiments as fully in∣to
view, as is necessary for their making a
just impression on the soul. This requires
the effort of an intelligent and feeling
mind; and therefore cannot be expected
to be commonly found. To the unreflect∣ing
<PB N="217" REF="230"/>
crowd, nothing appears real, but what
is exposed to sense. What is invisible, is
the same to them, as if it had no existence.
But by the grossness of their own concep∣tions,
they have no title to measure those of
others. While they affect to treat all con∣siderations
taken from the sense of the di∣vine
presence, as visionary and enthusias∣tic,
it can on the contrary, be clearly
shown, that they are founded on the most
certain and unquestionable principles of
reason. They essentially belong not to re∣vealed
only, but to natural, religion. Their
reality can be denied by none, but those
who deny that God exists, or that he go∣verns
the world. For, if he exist, he must
undoubtedly pervade and inspect the world
which he governs. He must know what
is going on throughout his own universe;
and especially must know what passes with∣in
the hearts which he has made, and of
which he is to judge. To be every where
present, is the attribute of his nature,
which, of all others, is the most necessary
to his administration of the universe. This,
<PB N="218" REF="231"/>
accordingly, is an attribute which all re∣ligions
have ascribed to him. All nations
have believed in it. All societies appeal to
it, in the solemnities of an oath, by which
they determine controversies. This attri∣bute
being once admitted to belong to the
Deity, the consequences which I have de∣duced
from it, plainly and naturally fol∣low:
And every good man has ground to
say, <HI>O Lord, I am continually with thee.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="sermon">

<HEAD>SERMON XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON PATIENCE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE, xxi. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>In your Patience possess ye your souls.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>possession of our souls</HI> is a very em∣phatical
expression.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> It describes that
state in which a man has both the full
command, and the undisturbed enjoyment
of himself; in opposition to his undergo∣ing
some inward agitation which discom∣poses
his powers. Upon the least reflec∣tion,
it must appear, how essential such a
state of mind is to happiness. He only
who thus <HI>possesses his soul</HI> is capable of pos∣sessing
any other thing with advantage;
and in order to attain and preserve this
<PB N="220" REF="233"/>
self-possession, the most important requisite
is, the habitual exercise of patience.</P>
<P>I know that patience is apt to be ranked
by many, among the more humble and
obscure virtues; belonging chiefly to those
who groan on a sick-bed, or who languish in
a prison. If their situation be, happily, of a
different kind, they imagine that there is
no occasion for the discipline of patience
being preached to them. But I hope to
make it appear, that, in every circumstance
of life, no virtue is more important, both
to duty and to happiness; or more requi∣site
for forming a manly and worthy cha∣racter.
It is not confined to a situation of
continued adversity. It principally, in∣deed,
regards the disagreeable circum∣stances
which are apt to occur. But, in
our present state, the occurrence of these
is so frequent, that, in every condition of
life, patience is incessantly called forth.
Prosperity cannot be enjoyed, any more
than adversity supported, without it. It
must enter into the temper, and form the
habit of the soul, if we would pass through
<PB N="221" REF="234"/>
the world with tranquillity and honour.
What I purpose is, to point out some of
the chief occasions on which patience is re∣quired;
and to recommend and enforce
the exercise of it, in order to <HI>our possessing
our souls.</HI></P>
<P>I. PATIENCE under provocations. The
wide circle of human society is diversified
by an endless variety of characters, dispo∣sitions,
and passions. Uniformity is, in no
respect the genius of the world. Every
man is marked by some peculiarity which
distinguishes him from another: and no
where can two individuals be found who
are exactly, and in all respects, alike.
Where so much diversity obtains, it can∣not
but happen, that, in the intercourse
which men are obliged to maintain, their
tempers shall often be ill adjusted to that
intercourse; shall jar, and interfere with
each other. Hence, in every station, the
highest as well as the lowest, and in every
condition of life, public, private, and dome∣stic,
occasions of irritation frequently arise.
<PB N="222" REF="235"/>
We are provoked, sometimes, by the folly
and levity of those with whom we are con∣nected;
sometimes, by their indifference or
neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the
haughtiness of a superior, or the insolent
behaviour of one in lower station. Hardly
a day passes, without somewhat or other oc∣curring,
which serves to ruffle the man of im∣patient
spirit. Of course, such a man lives
in a continual storm. He knows not what
it is to enjoy a train of good humour.
Servants, neighbours, friends, spouse, and
children, all, through the unrestrained vio∣lence
of his temper, become sources of di∣sturbance
and vexation to him. In vain
is affluence; in vain are health and prospe∣rity.
The least trifle is sufficient to dis∣compose
his mind, and poison his plea∣sures.
His very amusements are mixed
with turbulence and passion.</P>
<P>I would beseech this man to consider, of
what small moment the provocations which
he receives, or at least imagines himself to
receive, are really in themselves; but of
what great moment he makes them, by
<PB N="223" REF="236"/>
suffering them to deprive him of the pos∣session
of himself. I would beseech him,
to consider, how many hours of happiness
he throws away, which a little more pa∣tience
would allow him to enjoy; and how
much he puts it in the power of the most
insignificant persons to render him mise∣rable.
“But who can expect,” we hear him
exclaim, “that he is to possess the insensi∣bility
of a stone? How is it possible for
human nature to endure so many re∣peated
provocations? or to bear calmly
with such unreasonable behaviour?”—
My brother! if you can bear with no in∣stances
of unreasonable behaviour, with∣draw
yourself from the world. You are
no longer fit to live in it. Leave the in∣tercourse
of men. Retreat to the moun∣tain,
and the desert; or shut yourself up
in a cell. For here, in the midst of so∣ciety,
<HI>offences must come.</HI> You might as well
expect, when you beheld a calm atmo∣sphere,
and a clear sky, that no clouds were
ever to rise, and no winds to blow, as that
your life was long to proceed, without re∣ceiving
<PB N="224" REF="237"/>
provocations from human frailty.
The careless and the imprudent, the giddy
and the fickle, the ungrateful and the in∣terested,
every where meet us. They are
the briars and the thorns, with which the
paths of human life are beset. He only
who can hold his course among them with
patience and equanimity, he who is pre∣pared
to bear what he must expert to hap∣pen,
is worthy of the name of a man.</P>
<P>Did you only preserve yourself compo∣sed
for a moment, you would perceive the
insignificancy of most of those provocations
which you magnify so highly. When a few
suns more have rolled over your head, the
storm will have, of itself, subsided; the cause
of your present impatience and disturbance
will be utterly forgotten. Can you not, then,
anticipate this hour of calmness to your∣self;
and begin to enjoy the peace which
it will certainly bring? If others have be∣haved
improperly, leave them to their own
folly, without becoming the victim of their
caprice, and punishing yourself on their
account.—Patience, in this exercise of it,
<PB N="225" REF="238"/>
cannot be too much studied by all who
wish their life to flow in a smooth stream.
It is the reason of a man, in opposition to
the passion of a child. It is the enjoyment
of peace, in opposition to uproar and con∣fusion.
<HI>He that hath no rule over his own
spirit, is like a city that is broken down, and
without walls</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv. 28.</NOTE>.—The next important ex∣ercise
of patience is,</P>
<P>II. PATIENCE under disappointments.
These will often happen to the best and
wisest men; sometimes, to the wisest and
best concerted plans. They may happen,
too, not through any imprudence of those
who have devised the plan, not even
through the malice or ill design of others;
but merely in consequence of some of those
cross incidents of life which could not be
foreseen. On such occasions, persons of a
warm and sanguine temper are presently in
a ferment. They had formed their hopes,
as they think, upon the justest grounds.
<PB N="226" REF="239"/>
They had waited long for success; and
borne with many delays. But when their
designs are brought to so unexpected an
issue; when, without any fault of their
own, they find their hopes finally blasted,
all patience forsakes them; they no longer
possess their souls; the most passionate ex∣clamations
break forth. “To whom, ex∣cept
to them, could such a disappoint∣ment
have happened? Since the creation
of the world, was such a combination of
disastrous incidents ever beheld? Why
are they doomed to be so unfortunate
beyond all others?”—Alas! how un∣skilfully
have you calculated the course of
human events? How rashly and presump∣tuously
had you trusted to success? To
whom was it ever given, to guard against
all the vicissitudes, which the fluctuating
<HI>fashion of the world</HI> is incessantly bringing
about? If one friend, to whom you look∣ed
up, has died, or another has lost his in∣fluence
and power; if the opinion of the
public is changed, and its favour has been
withdrawn; if some mistakes have occur∣red
<PB N="227" REF="240"/>
to lessen the good will of a patron on
whom you depended; if, through the con∣currence
of these, or such like circum∣stances,
a more fortunate rival has prevail∣ed
against you; what is there in all this,
that differs from the ordinary lot of man?
Are we not, each in his turn, doomed to
experience the uncertainty of worldly pur∣suits?
Why, then, aggravate our misfor∣tunes
by the unreasonable violence of an
impatient spirit? If our designs have fail∣ed
through rashness or misconduct, let
us blame ourselves. If they have failed
through circumstances which we could not
prevent, let us submit to the fate of man;
and wait, with patience, till a more favour∣able
opportunity shall occur of regaining
success.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, let us turn to the other side
of the prospect; and calmly consider how
dubious it was, whether the success which
we longed for, would have proved a bles∣sing.
<HI>Who knoweth what is good for man
in this life?</HI> Perhaps, the accomplishment
of our designs might have been pregnant
<PB N="228" REF="241"/>
with misery. Perhaps, from our present
disappointment, future prosperity may rise.
Of such unlooked for issues, we all know
there have been many examples. Who can
tell, whether our case may not add one to the
number?—At any rate, let us recollect,
that there is a Supreme Ruler, who disposes
of the affairs of men; under whom, all se∣cond
causes work only as subordinate a∣gents.
Looking up to that irresistible arm
which is stretched over our heads, let us
be calm; let us submit and adore. Either
to despair, or to rage, under disappoint∣ments,
is sinful. By the former, we injure
ourselves. By the latter, we insult Provi∣dence,
and provoke its displeasure to con∣tinue.
<HI>To possess our souls in patience</HI> is, at
once, our wisdom as men, and our duty
as Christians. The benefits of this virtue
are so often reaped in this world, that
good policy alone would recommend it to
every thinking man. Disappointments de∣range,
and overcome, vulgar minds. The
patient and the wise, by a proper improve∣ment,
frequently make them contribute to
<PB N="229" REF="242"/>
their high advantage.—Let me next recom∣mend,</P>
<P>III. PATIENCE under restraints. Nu∣merous
are the restraints imposed on us, by
the nature of the human condition. To
the restraints of authority and law, all
must submit. The restraints of education
and discipline lie on the young. Consi∣derations
of health restrain the indulgence
of pleasure. Attentions to fortune restrain
expence. Regard to friends, whom we are
bound to please; respect to established cu∣stoms,
and to the opinions of society, im∣pose
restraints on our general behaviour.
There is no man, in any rank of life, who
is always at liberty to act according as he
would incline. In some quarter or other,
he is limited by circumstances, that either
actually confine, or that ought at least to
confine and restrain him.</P>
<P>These restraints, the impatient are apt to
scorn. They will needs burst the barriers
which reason had erected, or their situa∣tion
had formed; and without regard to
<PB N="230" REF="243"/>
consequences, give free scope to their pre∣sent
wish. Hence, many dangerous ex∣cesses
flow; much confusion and misery
are produced in human life. Had men
the patience to submit to their condition,
and to wait till it should allow them a
freer indulgence of their desires, they
might, in a short time, obtain the power
of gratifying them with safety. If the
young, for instance, would undergo, with
patience, the labours of education, they would
rise, at a proper period, to honours,
riches, or ease. If the infirm would, with
patience, bear the regulations which their
constitution demands, they might regain
the comforts of health. If persons of strait∣ened
fortune had patience to conform them∣selves
to their circumstances, and to abridge
their pleasures, they might, by degrees, im∣prove
and advance their state. Whereas,
by eagerness of temper, and precipitancy
of indulgence, they forfeit all the advan∣tages
which patience would have procu∣red;
and incur the opposite evils to their
full extent.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="244"/>
IN the present state of human affairs,
no lesson is more necessary to be learned
by all, to be inculcated on the young, and
to be practised by the old, than that of
patient submission to necessity. For under
the law of necessity, we are all inevitably
placed. No man is, or can be, always his
own master. We are obliged, in a thou∣sand
cases, to submit and obey. The dis∣cipline
of patience preserves our minds ea∣sy,
by conforming them to our state. By
the impetuosity of an impatient and un∣submitting
temper, we fight against an un∣conquerable
power; and aggravate the e∣vils
we must endure.—Another important
exercise of the virtue concerning which
we discourse, is,</P>
<P>IV. PATIENCE under injuries and
wrongs. To these, amidst the present con∣fusion
of the world, all are exposed. No
station is so high, no power so great, no
character so unblemished, as to exempt
men from being attacked by rashness, ma∣lice,
or envy. To behave under such at∣tacks
<PB N="232" REF="245"/>
with due patience and moderation,
is, it must be confessed, one of the most
trying exercises of virtue.—But, in order
to prevent mistakes on this subject, it is
necessary to observe, that a tame submis∣sion
to wrongs is not required by religion.
We are, by no means, to imagine, that re∣ligion
tends to extinguish the sense of ho∣nour,
or to suppress the exertion of a man∣ly-spirit.
It is under a false apprehension
of this kind, that Christian patience is
sometimes stigmatised in discourse, as no
other than a different name for cowardice.
On the contrary, every man of virtue
ought to feel what is due to his character,
and to support properly his own rights.
Resentment of wrong, is an useful principle
in human nature; and for the wisest pur∣poses,
was implanted in our frame. It is
the necessary guard of private rights; and
the great restraint on the insolence of the
violent, who, if no resistance were made,
would trample on the gentle and peace∣able.</P>
<P>Resentment, however, if not kept with∣in
<PB N="233" REF="246"/>
due bounds, is in hazard of rising into
fierce and cruel revenge. It is the office of
patience, to temper resentment by reason.
In this view, it is most properly described in
the text, by a man's <HI>possessing his soul;</HI> acting
the part which self-defence, which justice, or
honour, require him to act, without being
transported out of himself by the vehe∣mence
of anger; or insisting on such de∣grees
of reparation as bear no proportion
to the wrong that he has suffered. What
proportion, for instance, is there between
the life of a man, and an affront received
by some rash expression in conversation,
which the wise would have slighted; and
which, in the course of a few weeks, would
have been forgotten by every one? How
fantastic, then, how unjustifiable, are those
supposed laws of modern honour, which
for such an affront, require no less repara∣tion
than the death of a fellow-creature;
and which, to obtain this reparation, re∣quire
a man to endanger his own life?
Laws, which as they have no foundation
in reason, never received the least sanction
<PB N="234" REF="247"/>
from any of the wise and polished nations
of antiquity; but were devised in the
darkest ages of the world, and are derived
to us from the ferocious barbarity of Go∣thic
manners.</P>
<P>Nothing is so inconsistent with self-pos∣session
as violent anger. It overpowers
reason; confounds our ideas; distorts the
appearance, and blackens the colour, of
every object. By the storm which it raises
within, and by the mischiefs which it oc∣casions
without, it generally brings on the
passionate and revengeful man, greater mi∣sery
than he can bring on his enemy. Pa∣tience
allays this destructive tempest, by
making room for the return of calm and
sober thought. It suspends the blow which
sudden resentment was ready to inflict. It
disposes us to attend to the alleviating cir∣cumstances,
which may be discovered in
the midst of the wrongs we suppose our∣selves
to have suffered. Hence, it natural∣ly
inclines us to the moderate and gentle
side; and while it allows all proper mea∣sures
to be taken, both for safety, and for
<PB N="235" REF="248"/>
just redress, it makes way for returning
peace. Without some degree of patience
exercised under injuries, human life would
be rendered a state of perpetual hostility;
offences and retaliations would succeed to
one another in endless train; and the world
would become a field of blood.—It now
remains to recommend,</P>
<P>V. PATIENCE under adversity and af∣fliction.
This is the most common sense
in which this virtue is understood; as it
respects disease, poverty, old age, loss of
friends, and the other calamities which are
incident to human life. <HI>Though a man live
many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let
him remember the days of darkness, for they
shall be many</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. xi. 8.</NOTE> The various duties to
which patience, under this view, gives rise,
afford a larger subject to discourse than I
am at present to pursue. In general, there
are two chief exercises of patience under
adversity; one respecting God, and another
respecting men.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="249"/>
Patience, with respect to God, must, in
in the days of trouble, suppress the risings
of a murmuring and rebellious spirit. It
must appear in that calm resignation to the
will of Heaven, which is expressed in those
pious sentiments of ancient good men: <HI>I
was dumb: I opened not my mouth, because
thou didst it. It is the Lord, let him do what
seemeth good in his eyes. Shall the receive
good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we
not receive evil also?</HI> This is loyalty to the
great Governor of the universe. This is
that reverence which so well becomes crea∣tures
who know they are dependent, and
who must confess themselves to be sinful.
Such a spirit is fitted to attract the favour
of Heaven; and to bring the severe visita∣tion
sooner to a close. Whereas the stub∣born
and impatient, who submit not them∣selves
to the decrees of the Most High, re∣quire
to be humbled and subdued by a
continuance of chastisement.</P>
<P>Patience in adversity, with respect to
men, must appear by the composure and
tranquillity of our behaviour. The loud
<PB N="237" REF="250"/>
complaint, the querulous temper, and fret∣ful
spirit, disgrace every character. They
show a mind that is unmanned by misfor∣tunes.
We weaken thereby the sympathy
of others; and estrange them from the of∣fices
of kindness and comfort. The exer∣tions
of pity will be feeble, when it is
mingled with contempt. At the same time,
by thus weakly yielding to adversity, we
allow its weight to bear us down with
double pressure. Patience, by preserving
composure within, resists the impression
which trouble makes from without. By
leaving the mind open to every consolation,
it naturally tends to alleviate our burden.
—To maintain a steady and unbroken
mind, amidst all the shocks of the world,
forms the highest honour of a man. Pa∣tience,
on such occasions, rises to magna∣nimity.
It shows a great and noble mind,
which is able to rest on itself, on God, and
a good conscience; which can enjoy itself
amidst all evils; and would rather endure
the greatest hardships, than submit to what
was dishonourable, in order to obtain re∣lief.
<PB N="238" REF="251"/>
This gives proof of a strength that
is derived from Heaven. It is a beam of
the Immortal Light, shining on the heart.
Such patience, is the most complete triumph
of religion and virtue; and accordingly it
has ever characterised those whose names
have been transmitted with honour to pos∣terity.
It has ennobled the hero, the saint,
and the martyr. <HI>We are troubled on every
side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but
not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken;
cast down, but not destroyed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 8. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS I have traced Patience through
several of its most important operations, in
different circumstances of life; under pro∣vocations;
under disappointments; under
restraints; under injuries; and under af∣flictions.
We now see, that it is a virtue
of universal use. No man, in any condi∣tion,
can pass his days with tolerable com∣fort,
who has not learned to practise it.
His prosperity will be continually distrub∣ed;
<PB N="239" REF="252"/>
and his adversity will be clouded with
double darkness. He will be uneasy and
troublesome to all with whom he is con∣nected;
and will be more troublesome
to himself than to any other.—Let me
particularly advise those who wish to cul∣tivate
so necessary a virtue, to begin their
cultivation of it, on occasions when small
offences and provocations arise. It is a
great, but common, error to imagine, that
we are at liberty to give loose reins to tem∣per,
among the trivial occurrences of life.
No excuse for irritation and impatience can
be worse, than what is taken from the per∣son
being inconsiderable, or the incident
being slight, which threw us off our guard.
With inconsiderable persons we are sur∣rounded.
Of slight incidents, the bulk of
human life is composed. In the midst of
these, the ruling temper of the mind is
formed. It is only by moderation and self-command
then acquired, that we can inure
ourselves to patience, when the great con∣junctures
of life shall put it to a severer
trial. If neglected then, we shall after∣wards
<PB N="240" REF="253"/>
solicit its return in vain. <HI>If thou
hast run with footmen, and they have wea∣ried
thee, how canst thou contend with horses?
and if in the land of peace, wherein thou
trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt
thou do in the swellings of Jordan</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xii. 5.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>IN order to assist us in the acquisition of
this grace, let us often contemplate that
great model of it, which is displayed in the
whole life of our Saviour Jesus Christ.
Whose temper was ever tried by more fre∣quent
provocations, more repeated disap∣pointments,
more flagrant injuries, or more
severe distress? Yet, amidst them all,
we behold him patiently enduring <HI>the contra∣diction
of sinners;</HI> to their rudeness,
oppo∣sing a mild and unruffled, though firm,
spirit; and, in the cause of mankind, gene∣rously
bearing with ever indignity. Well
might he say, <HI>Learn of me, for I am meek
and lowly in heartgggg</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 29.</NOTE>. Having such a high
example before our eyes, let us be ashamed
<PB N="241" REF="254"/>
of those sallies of impatience which we so
often suffer to break forth, in the midst of
prosperity. By a more manly tranquillity
and self-command, let us discover to the
world, that, as men, and as Christians,
we have learned <HI>in patience to possess our souls.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PHILLIPPIANS, iv. 5.</BIBL>
<Q>Let your Moderation be known unto all Men.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE present state of man is neither
doomed to constant misery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XII.</NOTE> nor de∣signed
for complete happiness. It is, in
general, a mixed state, of comfort and sor∣row,
of prosperity and adversity; neither
brightened by uninterrupted sunshine,
nor overcast with perpetual shade; but subject
to alternate successions of the one, and the
other. While such a state forbids despair,
it also checks presumption. It is equally
adverse to despondency of mind, and to
<PB N="243" REF="256"/>
high elevation of spirits. The temper which
best suits it, is expressed in the text by <HI>mo∣deration;</HI>
which, as the habitual tenor of
the soul, the apostle exhorts us to discover
in our whole conduct; <HI>let it be known unto
all men.</HI> This virtue consists in the equal
balance of the soul. It imports such pro∣per
governement of our passions and plea∣sures,
as shall prevent us from running in∣to
extremes of any kind; and shall pro∣duce
a calm and temperate frame of mind.
It chiefly respects our conduct in that state,
which comes under the description of ease,
or prosperity Patience, of which I treat∣ed
in the preceding discourse, directs the
proper regulation of the mind, under the
disagreeable incidents of life. Moderation
determines the bounds within which it
should remain, when circumstances are a∣greeable
or promising. What I now pur∣pose
is, to point out some of the chief in∣stances
in which Moderation ought to take place,
and to show the importance of pre∣serving
it.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="257"/>
I. MODERATION in our wishes. The
active mind of man seldom or never rests
satisfied with its present condition, how
prosperous soever. Originally formed for
a wider range of objects, for a higher sphere
of enjoyments, it finds itself, in every si∣tuation
of fortune, straitened and confi∣ned.
Sensible of deficiency in its state, it
is ever sending forth the fond desire, the
aspiring wish, after something beyond what
is enjoyed at present. Hence, that restless∣ness
which prevails so generally among
mankind. Hence, that disgust of pleasures
which they have tried; that passion for
novelty; that ambition of rising to some
degree of eminence or felicity, of which
they have formed to themselves an indis∣tinct
idea. All which may be considered
as indications of a certain native, original
greatness in the human soul, swelling be∣yond
the limits of its present condition;
and pointing at the higher objects for
which it was made. Happy, if these latent
remains of our primitive state served to di∣rect
our wishes towards their proper desti∣nation,
<PB N="245" REF="258"/>
and to lead us into the path of true
bliss!</P>
<P>But in this dark and bewildered state,
the aspiring tendency of our nature unfor∣tunately
takes an opposite direction, and
feeds a very misplaced ambition. The
flattering appearances which here present
themselves to sense; the distinctions which
fortune confers; the advantages and plea∣sures
which we imagine the world to be
capable bestowing, fill up the ultimate
wish of most men. These are the objects
which ingross their solitary musings, and
stimulate their active labours; which warm
the breasts of the young, animate the in∣dustry
of the middle aged, and often keep
alive the passions of the old, until the very
close of life. Assuredly, there is nothing
unlawful in our wishing to be freed from
whatever is disagreeable, and to obtain a
fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life.
But when these wishes are not tempered by
reason, they are in danger of precipitating
us into much extravagance and folly. De∣sire
and wishes are the first springs of ac∣tion.
<PB N="246" REF="259"/>
When they become exorbitant, the
whole character is likely to be tainted. If
we suffer our fancy to create to itself, worlds
of ideal happiness; if we feed our imagi∣nation,
with plans of opulence and splendor
far beyond our rank; if we fix to our
wishes certain stages of high advancement,
or certain degrees of uncommon reputation
or distinction, as the sole stations of feli∣city;
the assured consequence will be, that
we shall become unhappy in our present
state; unfit for acting the part, and dis∣charging
the duties that belong to it; we
shall discompose the peace and order of our
minds, and foment many hurtful passions.
Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign;
by bringing within reasonable bounds the
wishes that we form. As soon as they be∣come
extravagant, let us check them, by
proper reflections on the fallacious nature
of those objects, which the world hangs out
to allure desire.</P>
<P>You have strayed, my friends, from the
road which conducts to felicity; you have
dishonoured the native dignity of your
<PB N="247" REF="260"/>
souls, in allowing your wishes to terminate
on nothing higher than worldly ideas of
greatness or happiness. Your imagination
roves in a land of shadows. Unreal forms
deceive you. It is no more than a phan∣tom,
an illusion of happiness, which at∣tracts
your fond admiration; nay, an illu∣sion
of happiness, which often conceals
much real misery. Do you imagine, that
all are happy, who have attained to those
summits of distinction, towards which your
wishes aspire? Alas! how frequently has
experience shewed, that where roses were
supposed to bloom, nothing but briars and
thorns grew? Reputation, beauty, riches,
grandeur, nay, royalty itself, would, many
a time, have been gladly exchanged by the
possessors, for that more quiet and humble
station, with which your are now dissatis∣fied.
With all that is splendid and shining
in the world, it is decreed that there should
mix many deep shades of woe. On the e∣levated
situations of fortune, the great ca∣lamities
of life chiefly fall. There the storm
spends its violence, and there the thunder
<PB N="248" REF="261"/>
breaks; while safe and unhurt, the inhabit∣ant
of the vale remains below.—Retreat,
then, from those vain and pernicious excur∣sions
of extravagant desire. Satisfy your∣selves
with what is rational and attainable.
Train your minds to moderate views of
human life, and human happiness. Re∣member,
and admire, the wisdom of Agur's
wish. <HI>Remove far from we vanity and lies.
Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me
with food convenient for me: Lest I be full,
and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord? or
lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of
my God in vain</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 8. 9.</NOTE>.—Let me recommend,</P>
<P>II. MODERATION in our pursuits.
Wishes and desires rest within. If immo∣derate
and improper, though they taint
the heart, yet society may not be affected
by them. The obscure and harmless in∣dividual
may indulge his dreams, without
disturbing the public peace. But when
the active pursuits in which we engage,
<PB N="249" REF="262"/>
rise beyond moderation, they fill the world
with great disorders; often with flagrant
crimes. This admonition chiefly respects
the ambitious men of the world. I say not,
that all ambition is to be condemned; or
that high pursuits ought, on every occa∣sion,
to be checked. Some men are form∣ed
by nature, for rising into conspicuous
stations of life. In following the impulse
of their minds, and properly exerting the
talents with which God has blessed them,
there is room for ambition to act in a lau∣dable
sphere, and to become the instru∣ment
of much public good. But this may
safely be pronounced that the bulk of
men are ready to over-rate their own abi∣lities,
and to imagine themselves equal to
higher things than they were ever design∣ed
for by nature. Be sober, therefore, in
fixing your aims, and planning your de∣stined
pursuits. Beware of being led a∣side
from the plain path of sound and mo∣derate
conduct, by those false lights which
self-flattery is always ready to hang out.
By aiming at a mark too high, you may
<PB N="250" REF="263"/>
fall short of what it was within your
power to have reached. Instead of attain∣ing
to eminence, you may expose your∣selves
to derision; nay, may bring upon
your heads manifold disasters. <HI>I say to
every man that is among you, not to think of
himself more highly than he ought to think,
but to think soberly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whatever your aims be, there is one ex∣ercise
of moderation which must be en∣joined
to those of the greatest abilities, as
well as to others; that is, never to trans∣gress
the bounds of moral duty. Amidst
the warmth of pursuit, accustom your∣selves
to submit to the restraints, which re∣ligion
and virtue, which propriety and de∣cency,
which regard to reputation and cha∣racter,
impose. Think not, that there are
no barriers which ought to stop your pro∣gress.
It is from a violent and impetuous
spirit that all the evils spring, which are
so often found to accompany ambition.
Hence, in private life, the laws of truth
<PB N="251" REF="264"/>
and honour are violated. Hence, in pu∣blic
contests, the peace and welfare of na∣tions
have been so often sacrificed to the
ambitious projects of the great. The man
of moderation, as he is temperate in his
wishes, so in his pursuits he is regulated
by virtue. A good conscience is to him
more valuable than any success. He is
not so much bent on the accomplishment
of any design, as to take a dishonourable
step, in order to compass it. He can have
patience. He can brook disappointments.
He can yield to unsurmountable obstacles;
and, by gentle and gradual progress, is
more likely to succeed in the end, than
others are, by violence and impetuosity. In
his highest enterprise, he wishes not to
have the appearance of a meteor, which
fires the atmosphere; or, of a comet, which
astonishes the public, by its blazing, ec∣centric
course; but rather to resemble those
steady luminaries of heaven, which ad∣vance
in their orbits, with a silent and re∣gular
motion. He approves himself there∣by
to the virtuous, the wise, and discern∣ing;
<PB N="252" REF="265"/>
and, by a temperate and unexcep∣tionable
conduct, escapes those dangers
which persons of an opposite description
are perpetually ready to incur.</P>
<P>III. BE moderate in your expectations.
When your state is flourishing, and the
course of events proceeds according to your
wish, suffer not your minds to be vainly
lifted up. Flatter not yourselves with high
prospects of the increasing favours of the
world, and the continuing applause of men.
Say not within your hearts, <HI>My mountain
stands strong, and shall never be moved. I
shall never see adversity. To-morrow shall
be as this day, and more abundantly.</HI>—You
are betraying yourselves; you are laying a
sure foundation of disappointment and mi∣sery,
when you allow your fancy to soar
to such lofty pinnacles of confident hope.
By building your house in this airy region,
you are preparing for yourselves a great
and cruel fall. Your <HI>trust is the spider's
web.</HI> You <HI>may lean on your house; but it
shall not stand. You may hold it fast; but it
<PB N="253" REF="266"/>
shall not endure.</HI> For, to man on earth it
was never granted, to gratify all his hopes;
or to persevere in one tract of uninterrup∣ted
prosperity. Unpleasing vicissitudes ne∣ver
fail to succeed those that were grateful.
<HI>The fashion of the world,</HI> how gay or smi∣ling
soever, <HI>posseth,</HI> and often passeth sud∣denly,
<HI>away.</HI></P>
<P>By want of moderation in our hopes,
we not only increase dejection, when dis∣appointment
comes, but we accelerate dis∣appointment;
we bring forward, with great∣er
speed, disagreeable changes in our state.
For the natural consequence of presump∣tuous
expectation, is rashness in conduct.
He who indulges confident security, of
course neglects due precautions against the
dangers that threaten him; and his fall
will be foreseen, and predicted. He not
only exposes himself unguarded to dan∣gers,
but he multiplies them against him∣self.
By presumption and vanity, he either
provokes enmity, or incurs contempt.</P>
<P>The arrogant mind, and the proud
hope, and equally contrary to religion, and
<PB N="254" REF="267"/>
to prudence. The world cannot bear such
a spirit; and Providence seldom fails to
check it. The Almighty beholds with dis∣pleasure
those who, intoxicated with pro∣sperity,
forget their dependence on that Su∣preme
Power which raised them up. His
awful government of the world has been
in nothing more conspicuous than in <HI>bring∣ing
low the lofty looks of man, and scattering
the proud in the imaginations of their minds.
—Is not this the great Babylon which I have
built by the might of my power, and for the
honour of my Majesty</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel, iv. 30. 31.</NOTE>? Thus exclaimed
the presumptuous monarch, in the pride of
his heart. But, lo! when the word was
yet in his mouth, the visitation from hea∣ven
came, and the voice was heard; <HI>O,
Nebuchadnezzar! to thee it is spoken; thy
kingdom is departed from thee.—He that ex∣alteth
himself, shall be humbled; and he that
humbleth himself, shall be exalted</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiv. 11.</NOTE>. A tem∣perate
spirit, and moderate expectations,
are the best safeguard of the mind in this
<PB N="255" REF="268"/>
uncertain and changing state. They en∣able
us to pass through life with most
comfort. When we rise in the world, they
contribute to our elevation; and if we
must fall, they render our fall the lighter.</P>
<P>IV. MODERATION in our pleasures is an
important exercise of the virtue which we
are now considering. It is an invariable
law of our present condition, that every
pleasure which is pursued to excess, con∣verts
itself into poison. What was intend∣ed
for the cordial and refreshment of hu∣man
life, through want of moderation, we
turn to its bane. In all the pleasures of
sense, it is apparent, that only when indul∣ged
within certain limits, they confer sa∣tisfaction.
No sooner do we pass the line
which temperance had drawn, than perni∣cious
effects come forward, and show them∣selves.
Could I lay open to your view the
monuements of death, they would read a
lecture in favour of moderation, much
more powerful than any that the most elo∣quent
preacher can give. You would be∣hold
<PB N="256" REF="269"/>
hold the graves peopled with the victims
of intemperance. You would behold those
chambers of darkness hung round, on eve∣ry
side, with the trophies of luxury, drunk∣enness,
and sensuality. So numerous would
you find those martyrs of iniquity, that it
may safely be asserted, where war or pesti∣lence
have slain their thousands, intempe∣rate
pleasure has slain its ten thousands.</P>
<P>While the want of moderation in plea∣sure
brings men to an untimely grave,
at the same time, until they arrive there,
it pursues and afflicts them with evils
innumerable. To what cause so much
as to this, are owing, faded youth, and
premature old age; an evervated body,
and an enfeebled mind; together with
all that long train of diseases, which the
indulgence of appetite and sense have in∣troduced
into the world? Health, chear∣fulness,
and vigour, are known to be the
offspring of temperance. The man of
moderation brings to all the natural and
innocent pleasures of life, that sound un∣corrupted
relish, which gives him a much
<PB N="257" REF="270"/>
fuller enjoyment of them, than the palled
and vitiated appetite of the voluptuary al∣lows
him to know. He culls the flower of
every allowable gratification, without dwell∣ing
upon it until the flavour be lost. He
tastes the sweet of every pleasure, without
pursuing it till the bitter dregs rise. Where∣as
the man of opposite character dips so
deep, that he never fails to stir an impure
and noxious sediment, which lies at the
bottom of the cup.—In the pleasures,
besides, which are regulated by modera∣tion,
there is always that dignity which
goes along with innocence. No man needs
to be ashamed of them. They are consist∣ent
with honour; with the favour of God,
and of man. But the sensualist, who dis∣dains
all restraint in his pleasures, is odious
in the public eye. His vices become gross;
his character, contemptible; and he ends
in being a burden both to himself and to
society. Let me exhort you, once more,</P>
<P>V. To moderation in all your passions.
This exercise of the virtue is the more re∣quisite,
<PB N="258" REF="271"/>
because there is no passion in hu∣man
nature but what has, of itself, a ten∣dency
to run into excess. For all passion
implies a violent emotion of mind. Of
course, it is apt to derange the regular
course of our ideas; and to produce con∣fusion
within. Nothing, at the same time,
is more seducing than passion. During the
time when it grows and swells, it constant∣ly
justifies, to our apprehension, the tumult
which it creates, by means of a thousand
false arguments which it forms, and brings
to its aid. Of some passions, such as anger
and resentment, the excess is so obviously
dangerous, as loudly to call for modera∣tion.
He who gives himself up to the im∣petuosity
of such passions, without restraint,
is universally condemned by the world;
and hardly accounted a man of sound
mind. But, what is less apt to be attend∣ed
to, some even of those passions which
are reckoned innocent, or whose tendency
to disorder and evil is not apparent, stand,
nevertheless, in need of moderation and re∣straint,
as well as others. For, such is the
<PB N="259" REF="272"/>
feebleness of our nature, that every passion
which has for its object any worldly good,
is in hazard of attaching us too strongly,
and of transporting us beyond the bounds
of reason. If allowed to acquire the full and
unrestrained dominion of the heart, it is
sufficient, in various situations, to render
us miserable; and almost in every situa∣tion,
by its ingrossing power, to render
us negligent of duties which, as men or
Christians, we are bound to perform.</P>
<P>Of the insidious growth of passion, there∣fore,
we have great reason to beware. We
ought always to have at hand considera∣tions,
which may assist us in tempering its
wramth, and in regaining possession of our
souls. Let us be persuaded, that moments
of passion are always moments of delusion;
that nothing truly is, what it then seems to
be; that all the opinions which we then
form, are erroneous; and all the judge∣ments
which we pass, are extravagant. Let
modertaion accustom us to wait until the
fumes of passion be spent; until the mist
which it has raised begin to be dissipated.
<PB N="260" REF="273"/>
We shall then be able to see where truth
and right lie; and reason shall, by degrees,
resume the ascendant. On no occasion let
us imagine, that strength of mind is shown
by violence of passion. This is not the
strength of men, but the impetuosity of
children. It is the strength of one who is
in the delirium of a fever, or under the
disease of madness. The strength of such a
person is indeed increased. But it is an
unnatural strength; which being under no
proper guidance, is directed towards ob∣jects
that occasion his destruction. True
strength of mind is shown in governing
and resisting passion, not in giving it scope;
in restraining the wild beast within; and
acting, on the most trying occasions, ac∣cording
to the dictates of conscience, and
temperate reason.</P>
<P>THUS I have pointed out, in several in∣stances,
how moderation ought to be dis∣played:
Moderation in our wishes; mo∣deration
in our pursuits; moderation in
our hopes; moderation in our pleasures;
<PB N="261" REF="274"/>
moderation in our passions. It is a prin∣ciple
which should habitually influence our
conduct and form the reigning tempera∣ture
of the soul.</P>
<P>THE great motive to this virtue is suggest∣ed
by the words immediately following the
text; <HI>the Lord is at hand.</HI> The Judge is co∣ming,
who is to close this temporary scene of
things, and to introduce a higher state of
existence. The day is at hand, which will
place the great concerns of men in a point
of view very different from that in which
they are at present beheld; will strip the
world of its false glory; will detect the va∣nity
of earthly pursuits; and disclose ob∣jects
which have the proper title to interest
a rational mind. Objects acquire power
to engage our passions, only in proportion
as they are conceived to be great. But
great, or little, are no more then terms of
comparison. Those things which appear
great to one who knows nothing greater,
will sink into a diminutive size, when he
becomes acquainted with objects of a high∣er
<PB N="262" REF="275"/>
nature. Were it oftener in our thoughts,
that <HI>the Lord is at hand,</HI> none of those
things which now discompose and agitate
worldly men, would appear of sufficient
magnitude to raise commotion in our
breasts. Enlarged views of the future de∣stination
of man, and of the place which
he may hope to possess in an eternal
world, naturally give birth to modera∣tion
of mind. They tend to cool all mis∣placed
ardour about the advantages of this
state; and to produce that calm and tem∣perate
frame of spirit, which becomes men
and Christians. They give no ground for
entire disregard of earthly concerns. While
we are men, we must feel and act as such.
But they afford a good reason why they
who believe <HI>the Lord to be at hand,</HI> should
let their <HI>moderation</HI> appear, and <HI>be known
unto all men.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the JOY, and the BITTERNESS of the
HEART.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROVERBS, xiv. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>The heart knoweth his own bitterness, and a
stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is well known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> that men have always
been much inclined to place their hap∣piness
in the advantages of fortune, and
the distinctions of rank. Hence these have
been pursued by the multitude with such
avidity, that every principle of honour,
probity, and virtue, have been sacrificed
to the attainment of them. At the same
time, many circumstances might have con∣vinced
men, that supposing them to suc∣cessful
<PB N="264" REF="277"/>
in the pursuit, it by no means fol∣lowed,
that happiness was to be the re∣ward.
For if happiness be, in truth, es∣sentially
connected with splendid fortune,
or exalted rank, how comes it to pass that
many in the inferior stations of life, visibly
spend their days with more comfort than
they who occupy the higher departments
of the world? Why does the beggar sing,
while the King is sad? A small measure of
reflection on our nature might satisfy us,
that there are other principles of happiness
or misery, too often overlooked by the
world, which immediately affect the heart,
and operate there with greater force and
power, than any circumstances of rank or
fortune. This is the observation of the
wise man in the text; and what I now pur∣pose
to illustrate. I shall take a view of
the chief sources of that <HI>bitterness which the
heart knoweth,</HI> and of that <HI>joy with which
a stranger doth not intermeddle;</HI> and then
shall point out the proper improvements to
be made of the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="278"/>
IF we inquire carefully into the sources
of the joy or bitterness of the heart, we
shall find, that they are chiefly two; that
they arise either from a man's own mind
and temper; or, from the connection in
which he stands with some of his fellow∣creatures.
In other words, the circum∣stances
which most essentially affect every
man's happiness are, his personal character,
and his social feelings.</P>
<P>I. EVERY man's own mind and temper
is, necessarily, to himself a source of much
inward joy or bitterness. For every man,
if we may be allowed the expression, is
more connected with himself, than with
any external object. He is constantly a
companion to himself in his own thoughts;
and what he meets with there, must of all
things, contribute most to his happiness or
his disquiet. Whatever his condition in
the world be, whether high or low, if he
find to cause to upbraid himself for his
behaviour; if he be satisfied that his con∣duct
proceeds upon a rational plan; if,
<PB N="266" REF="279"/>
amidst the failings incident to humanity,
his conscience be, in the main, free from
reproach, and his mind undisturbed by
any dismal presages of futurity; the foun∣dation
is laid for a placid and agreeable te∣nor
of life. If to this you add a calm and
chearful temper, not easily fretted or di∣sturbed,
not subject to envy, nor prone to
violent passion, much of that joy will be
produced, which it is said in the text, <HI>a
stranger intermeddleth not with.</HI> For this is
an intrinsic joy, independent of all foreign
causes. <HI>The upright man,</HI> as it is written,
<HI>is satisfied from himself.</HI> Undisturbed by
the vexations of folly, or the remorse of
guilt, his nights will be peaceful, and his
days serene. His mind is a kingdom to it∣self.
A good conscience, and good tem∣per,
prepare, even in the midst of poverty,
<HI>a continual feast.</HI></P>
<P>But how sadly will the scene be reversed,
if the first thoughts which occur to a man
concerning himself, shall be of a gloomy
and threatening kind; if his temper, in∣stead
of calmness and self-enjoyment, shall
<PB N="267" REF="280"/>
yield him nothing but disquiet and painful
agitation? In any situation of fortune, is
it possible for him to be happy, whose
mind is in this troubled state? <HI>The spirit
of a man will sustain his infirmities; but a
wounded spirit, who can bear?</HI> Vigour of
mind, may enable a man to sustain many
shocks of adversity. In his spirit, as long
as it is sound, he can find a resource,
when other auxiliaries fail. But if that
which should sustain him be enfeebled and
broken; if that to which he has recourse
for the cure of other sorrows, become itself
the wounded part; to what quarter can he
turn for relief?</P>
<P>The wounds which the spirit suffers are
owing chiefly to three causes; to folly, to
passion, or to guilt. They frequently ori∣ginate
from folly; that is, from vain, and
improper pursuits, which, though not di∣rectly
criminal, are unsuitable to a man's
age, character, or condition, in the world.
In consequence of these, he beholds him∣self
degraded and exposed; and suffers the
pain of many a mortifying reflection, and
<PB N="268" REF="281"/>
many a humbling comparison of himself
with others. The distress occasioned by a
sense of folly, is aggravated by any violent
passion being allowed to take possession of
the heart. Even though it be of the class
of those which are reckoned innocent, yet,
if it have entirely seized and overpowered
a man, it destroys his tranquillity, and
brings his mind into a perturbed state.
But if it be a passion of the black and vi∣cious
kind, it is sufficient to blast the most
flourishing condition, and to poison all his
joys. If to those wounds inflicted by fol∣ly,
or by passion, you add the wound of
guilt, the remorse and fear produced by
criminal deeds, you fill up the measure of
pain, and bitterness of heart. Often have
the terrors of conscience occasioned inward
paroxysms, or violent agitations of mind.
A dark and threatening cloud seems, to the
conscious sinner, to be hanging over his
head. He who believes himself despised,
or hated, by men, and who dreads, at the
same time, an avenging God, can derive
little pleasure from the external comforts of
<PB N="269" REF="282"/>
life. The bitterness of his hearts infuses it∣self
into every draught which pleasure of∣fers
to his lips.</P>
<P>The external misfortunes of life, disap∣pointments,
poverty, and sickness, are no∣thing
in comparison of those inward di∣stresses
of mind, occasioned by folly, by
passion, and by guilt. They may indeed
prevail in different degrees, according as
one or other of those principles of bitter∣ness
is predominant. But they are seldom
parted far asunder from one another; and
when, as it too often happens, all the three
are complicated, they complete the misery
of man. The disorders of the mind, ha∣ving
then arisen to their height, become of
all things the most dreadful. The shame
of folly, the violence of passion, and the
remorse of guilt, acting in conjuction,
have too frequently driven men to the last
and abhorred refuge, of seeking relief in
death from a life too embittered to be any
longer endured. I proceed to consider</P>
<P>II. OTHER troubles, and other joys of
<PB N="270" REF="283"/>
the heart, arising from sources different
from those that I have now described;
founded in the relations or connections
which we have with others and springing
from the feelings which these occasion.
Such causes of sorrow or joy are of an
external nature. Religion does not teach,
that all the sources of inward pleasure or
pain are derived from our temper, and mo∣ral
behaviour. These are indeed the prin∣cipal
springs of bitterness or joy. In one
way or other, they affect all the pleasures
and pains of life; but they include not,
within themselves, the whole of them. Our
Creator did not intend, that the happiness
of each individual should have no depend∣ence
on those who are around him. Ha∣ving
connected us in society by many ties,
it is his decree, that these ties should prove,
both during their subsistence, and in their
dissolution, causes of pleasure or pain, im∣mediately,
and often deeply, affecting the
human heart My doctrine, therefore, is
not, that <HI>the bitterness which the heart know∣eth
as its own,</HI> and <HI>the joy with which a
<PB N="271" REF="284"/>
stranger intermeddleth not,</HI> is independent of
every thing external. What I assert is,
that this <HI>bitterness,</HI> and this <HI>joy,</HI> depend
much more on other causes, than on riches
or poverty, on high or low stations in the
world; that, equally in the conditions of
elevated fortune, and of private life, the
most material circumstances of trouble or
felicity, next to the state of our own mind
and temper, are the sensations and affec∣tions
which arise from the connections we
have with others.</P>
<P>IN order to make this appear, let us sup∣pose
a man, in any rank or condition of
life, happy in his family and his friends;
soothed by the cordial intercourse of kind
affections, which he partakes with them;
enjoying the comfort of doing them good
offices, and receiving in return their since∣rest
gratitude; experiencing no jealousy
nor envy, no disquiet or alienation of af∣fection,
among those with whom he is con∣nected;
—how many, and how copious
sources of inward joy open to such a man!
<PB N="272" REF="285"/>
How smooth is the tenor of a life that pro∣ceeds
in such a course! What a smiling
aspect does the love of parents and chil∣dren,
of brothers and sisters, of friends and
relations, give to every surrounding object,
and every returning day! With what a
lustre does it gild even the small habitation
where such placid intercourse dwells; where
such scenes of heartfelt satisfaction succeed
uninterruptedly to one another!</P>
<P>But let us suppose this joyful intercourse
to be broken off, in an untimely hour, by
the cruel hand of the last foe; let us ima∣gine
the family, once so happy among
themselves, to behold the parent, the child,
or the spouse, to whom their hearts were
attached by the tenderest ties, stretched on
the cold bed of death; then, what bitter∣ness
does the heart know! This, in the
strictest sense, is its <HI>own bitterness;</HI> from
which it is not in the power of any exter∣nal
circumstance whatever to afford it re∣lief.
Aidst those piercing griefs of the
heart, all ranks of life are levelled; all dis∣tinctions
of fortune are forgotten. Un∣availing
<PB N="273" REF="286"/>
availing are the trophies of splendid woe,
with which riches deck the fatal couch, to
give the least comfort to the mourner. The
prince, and the peasant, then equally feel
their own bitterness. Dwelling on the me∣lancholy
remebrance of joys that are past
and gone, the one forgets this poverty; the
other despises the gilded trappings of his
state. Both, in that sad hour, are fully
sensible, that on the favours of fortune it
depends not to make man happy in this
world.</P>
<P>But it is not only the death of friends,
which, in the midst of a seemingly pro∣sperous
state, is able to bring distress home
to the heart. From various failures in their
conduct when living, arises much of the
inward uneasiness we suffer. It will, in
general, be found, that the behaviour of
those among whom we live in near connec∣tion,
is, next to personal character and
temper, the chief source, either of the plea∣sures,
or of the disquietudes, of every man's
life. As, when their behaviour is cordial
and satisfactory, it is of all external things
<PB N="274" REF="287"/>
the most soothing to the mind; so, on the
other hand, their levity, their inattention,
or occasional harshness, even though it pro∣ceed
to no decided breach of friendship,
yet ruffles and frets the temper. Social
life, harassed with those petty vexations,
resembles a road which a man is doomed
daily to travel; but finds it rugged, and
stony, and painful to be trod.</P>
<P>The case becomes much worse, if the
base and criminal conduct of persons whom
we have once loved, dissolve all the bonds
of amity, and show that our confidence
has been abused. Then are opened, some
of the deepest springs of bitterness in the
human heart.—Behold the heart of the
parent, torn by the unworthy behaviour,
and cruel ingratitude of the child whom
he had trained up with the fondest hopes;
on whom he had lavished his whole affec∣tion;
and for whose sake he had laboured
and toiled, through the course of a long life.
Behold the endearments of the conjugal
state changed into black suspicion, and mis∣trust;
the affectionate spouse, or the vir∣tuous
<PB N="275" REF="288"/>
husband, left to mourn, with a bro∣ken
heart, the infidelity of the once-beloved
partner of their life. Behold the unsus∣pecting
friend betrayed, in the hour of
danger, by the friend in whom he trusted;
or, in the midst of severe misfortune, meet∣ing
nothing but cold indifference, perhaps
scorn and contempt, where he had expect∣ed
to find the kindest sympathy.—Are
these, let me ask, uncommon scenes in the
world? Are such distresses peculiar to any
rank or station? Do they chiefly befall
persons in humble life, and have the great
any prerogative which affords them exemp∣tion?
When the heart is sorely wounded
by the ingratitude or faithlessness of those
on who it had leaned with the whole
weight of affection, where shall it turn for
relief? Will it find comfort in the recol∣lection
of honours and titles, or in the con∣templation
of surrounding treasures?—
Talk not of the honours of a court. Talk
not of the wealth of the east. These, in
the hours of heart-bitterness are spurned,
as contemptible and vile; perhaps cursed,
<PB N="276" REF="289"/>
as indirect causes of the present distress.
The dart has made its way to the heart.
There, there, it is fixed. The very seat of
feeling is assailed; and in proportion to
the sensibility of the sufferer's heart, and
the tenderness of his affections, such, un∣fortunately,
will be his degree of anguish.
A good conscience, and hope in God, may
indeed bring him consolation. But un∣der
such distresses of the heart, as I have
described, fortune, be it as flourishing as
you will, is no more than an empty pa∣geant.
It is a feeble reed, which affords
no support. It is a house of straw, which
is scattered before the wind.</P>
<P>THUS you see his doctrine meeting us
from many quarters, that the heart knows
a bitterness and a joy of its own, altogether
distinct from the uneasiness or the pleasure
that is produced by the circumstances of
external fortune; arising either from per∣sonal
character, and the state of a man's
own mind; or from the affections excited
by the relations in which he stands to others.
<PB N="277" REF="290"/>
This joy, and this bitterness, are, each of
them, of so much greater consequence than
any distinctions of fortune, that blessed with
the former, one may be happy, as far as
human happiness goes, in a cottage; and
afflicted with the latter, he must be mise∣rable
in a palace.—Let us now proceed
to an important part of the subject, the
practical improvement to which this doc∣trine
leads.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let is serve to moderate our pas∣sion
for riches, and high situations in the
world. It is well known, that the eager
pursuit of these is the chief incentive to the
crimes that fill the world. Hence, among
the middle and lower ranks of men, all the
fraud, falsehood, and treachery, with which
the competition for gain infests society.
Hence, in the higher stations of the world,
all the atrocious crimes flowing from am∣bition,
and the love of power, by which
the peace of mankind has so often been
broken, and the earth stained with blood.
Had these coveted advantages the power,
<PB N="278" REF="291"/>
when obtained, of ensuring joy to the
heart, and rendering it a stranger to bitter∣ness,
some apology might be offered for
the violence to which they have given oc∣casion.
The prize might be supposed wor∣thy
of being acquired at a high expence,
when so much depended on the attain∣ment.
But I have shown, I hope with sa∣tisfactory
evidence, that the contrary is the
truth. I say not, that the advantages of
fortune deserve no regard from a wise or a
good man. Poverty is always distressing.
Opulence and rank are both attended with
many comforts, and may be rendered sub∣servient
to the most valuable purposes. But
what I say is, that it is a great error to rate
them beyond their just value. Secondary
advantages, inferior assistances to felicity,
they are; and no more. They rank below
every thing that immediately affects the
heart; and that is a native source of joy or
bitterness there. If a man be either un∣happy
in his dispositions, or unhappy in all
his connections, you heap upon him in
vain, all the treasures, and all the honours,
<PB N="279" REF="292"/>
which kings can bestow. Divest these
things, then, of that false glare which the
opinions of the multitude throw around
them. Contemplate them with a more im∣partial
eye. Pursue them with less eager∣ness.
Above all, never sacrifice to the pur∣suit
any degree of probity or moral worth
of candour or good affection; if you would
not lay a foundation for that bitterness of
heart, which none of the goods of fortune
can either compensate or cure.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Let the observations which
have been made, correct our mistakes, and
check our complaints, concerning a suppo∣sed
promiscuous distribution of happiness
in this world. The charge of injustice,
which so often, on this account, hath been
brought against Providence, rests entirely
on this ground, that the happiness and mi∣sery
of men may be estimated by the de∣gree
of their external prosperity. This is
the delusion under which the multitude
have always laboured; but which a just
consideration of the invisible springs of hap∣piness
<PB N="280" REF="293"/>
that affect the heart, is sufficient to
correct. If you would judge whether a
man be really happy, it is not solely to his
houses and his lands, to his equipage and
his retinue, you are to look. Unless you
could see farther, and discern what joy, or
what bitterness, his heart feels, you can
pronounce nothing concerning him. That
proud and wicked man, whom you behold
surrounded with state and splendour, and
upon whom you think the favours of Hea∣ven
so improperly lavished, may be a
wretch, pining away in secret, with a thou∣sand
griefs unknown to the world. That
poor man, who appears neglected and over∣looked,
may, in his humble station, be
partaking of all the moral, and all the so∣cial
joys, that exhilarate the heart; may
be living chearful, contented, and happy.
Cease, then, to murmur against dispensa∣tions
of Providence, which are, to us, so im∣perfectly
known. Envy not the prosperity
of sinners. Judge not of the real condition
of men, from what floats merely on the
surface of their state. Let us rather,</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="294"/>
THIRDLY, Turn our attention to those
internal sources of happiness or misery, on
which it hath been shown that so much
depends. As far as the bitterness or joy
of the heart arises from the first of those
great springs which I assigned to it, our
own conduct and temper, so far our hap∣piness
is placed, in some measure in our
own hands. What is amiss or disordered
within, in consequence of folly, of passion,
or guilt, may be rectified by due care, un∣der
the assistance of divine grace. He who
thereby attains to a tranquil and composed
state of heart, free from ill humour and
disgust, from violent passions, and from
vexing remorse, is laying a foundation for
enjoyment of himself, much surer and
broader, than if he were amassing thou∣sands
to increase his estate.</P>
<P>With regard to the other spring of joy
or bitterness of heart, arising from our con∣nections
with others, here indeed, we are
more dependent on things not within our
power. These connections are not al∣ways
of our own forming; and even when
<PB N="282" REF="295"/>
they have been formed by choice, the wisest
are liable to be disappointed in their expec∣tations.
Yet here too it will be found, that
the proper regulation of the heart is of the
utmost importance, both for improving the
joys which our situation affords, and for
mitigating the griefs which our connec∣tions
may render unavoidable. As far as
the choice of friends or relatives depends
on ourselves, let their virtue and worth
ever direct that choice, if we look for
any lasting felicity from it. In all the
habits and attachments of social life, after
they are formed, let it be our study, to ful∣fil
properly our own part. Let nothing be
wanting on our side, to nourish that mutual
harmony and affectionate friendship which,
in every situation of life, as has been shown,
is of so great consequence to our peace and
satisfaction. It is not, indeed, in our power
to preserve always alive those friends, in
whom our hearts delight. It is often not
in our power to prevent the ingratitude and
unworthy behaviour of other friends, from
whom we once expected comfort. But
<PB N="283" REF="296"/>
under those afflicting incidents of life,
much may be done by proper employment
of the thoughts, and direction of the affec∣tions,
for obtaining relief. To a purified
and well-regulated heart, reason and reli∣gion
can bring many aids for healing its
wounds, and restoring its peace; aids which,
to the negligent and vicious, are wholly
unknown. The greater experience we have
of the vicissitudes of human life, with more
weight will that precept of the wise man
always come home to our remembrance;
<HI>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of
it are the issues of life</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. iv. 23.</NOTE>—Hence, arises,</P>
<P>IN the fourth and last place, another in∣struction,
that it is of the utmost import∣ance
to us all, frequently to look up to
Him who made the human heart; and to
implore his assistance in the regulation and
government of it. Known to him, are all
the sources of bitterness and joy by which
it is affected. On him it depends, to let
<PB N="284" REF="297"/>
them forth, or to shut them up; to in∣crease,
or to diminish them, at his plea∣sure.
In a study so infinitely important to
happiness, as that of the preservation of in∣ward
peace, we cannot be too earnest in
beseeching aid from the great Father of
Spirits, to enable us to keep our hearts free
from distress and trouble.—Besides the
assistance which we may hope to derive
from divine grace, the employments of de∣votion
themselves, form one of the most
powerful means of composing, and tran∣quillising
the heart. One various occasions,
when the sources of heart-bitterness have
been most overflowing, devotion has been
found the only refuge of the sufferer. De∣votion
opens a sanctuary, to which they,
whose hearts have been most deeply wound∣ed,
can always fly. Within that quiet and
sacred retreat, they have often found a
healing balsam prepared. When grieved
by men, they have derived, from the ascent
of the mind towards God and celestial ob∣jects,
much to sooth them at present, and
much to hope for in future. Let us, there∣fore,
<PB N="285" REF="298"/>

can furnish us, for promoting the joys, and
assuaging the bitterness of the heart. A∣midst
the frailties of our nature, the incon∣stancy

of human life, we shall find every assistance
that can be procured, little enough, for en∣abling

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On CHARACTERS of IMPERFECT GOOD∣NESS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MARK, x. 21.</BIBL>
<Q>Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE characters of men which the world
presents to us are infinitely diversified.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE>
In some, either the good or the bad qualities
are so predominant, as strongly to mark
the character; to discriminate one person
as a virtuous, another as a vicious man.
In others, these qualities are so mixed to∣gether,
as to leave the character doubtful.
The light and the shade are so much blend∣ed,
the colours of virtue and vice run in
such a manner into one another, that we
<PB N="287" REF="300"/>
can hardly distinguish where the one ends,
and the other begins; and we remain in
suspence, whether to blame or to praise.
While we admire those who are thorough∣ly
good, and detest the grossly wicked, it
is proper also to bestow attention on those
imperfect characters, where there may be
much to praise, and somewhat to blame;
and where regard to the commendable part,
shall not hinder us from remarking what
is defective or faulty. Such attentions will
be found the more useful, as characters of
this mixed sort are, more frequently than
any other, exhibited to us in the commerce
of society.</P>
<P>It was one of this sort, which gave occa∣sion
to the incident recorded in the text. The
incident seems to have been considered as re∣markable,
since it is recounted by three of
the evangelical writers; and by them all,
with nearly the same circumstances. The
person to whom the history relates was <HI>a ru∣ler;</HI>
one of higher rank and station than
those who usually resorted to Jesus. He
was <HI>a rich man:</HI> He was <HI>a young man.</HI> His
<PB N="288" REF="301"/>
whole behaviour was prepossessing and en∣gaging.
He appears to have conceived a
high opinion of our Lord. He addressed
him with the utmost respect; and the que∣stion
which he put to him was proper and im∣portant.
<HI>He kneeled to him; and said, Good
Master, What shall I do that I may inherit
eternal life?</HI> His conduct in the world had
been regular and decent. He could pro∣test,
that he had hitherto kept himself free
from any gross vice; and in his dealings
with others, had observed the precepts of
God. Our Lord, <HI>beholding him,</HI> is said to
have <HI>loved him;</HI> whence we have reason to
conclude, that he was not hypocritical in
his professions; and that his countenance
carried the expression of good dispositions,
as his speech, and his manners, were altoge∣ther
complacent and gentle. Yet this per∣son,
amiable as he was, when his virtue
was put to the test, disappointed the hopes
which he had given reason to form. At∣tached,
in all probability, to the indulgence
of ease and pleasure, he wanted fortitude
of mind to part with the advantages of the
<PB N="289" REF="302"/>
world, for the sake of religion. When our
Lord required him to fulfil his good inten∣tions,
by relinquishing his fortune, beco∣ming
one of his followers, and preparing
himself to encounter sufferings, the sacri∣fice
appeared to him too great. Impressions
of virtue, however, still remained on his
mind. He was sensible of what he ought
to have done; and regretted his want of
courage to do it. He <HI>was sorrowful:</HI> He
<HI>was grieved:</HI> Yet <HI>be went away.</HI></P>
<P>PERSONS of a character somewhat re∣sembling
this, all of us may have met with;
especially, among the young; among those
who have been liberally educated, and
polished by good society. That abhor
open vice, and crimes that disturb the
world. They have a respect for religion.
They are willing to receive instruction for
their conduct. They are modest and un∣assuming;
respectful to their superiors in
age or station; gentle in their address; in∣offensive
and courteous in their whole be∣haviour.
They are fond of obliging every
<PB N="290" REF="303"/>
one; unwilling to hurt or displease any.—
Such persons we cannot but love. We
gladly promise well of them; and are dis∣posed
to forward and assist them. Yet such
is the weakness of our nature, that at the
bottom of this character there may lie, as
we see exemplified in the instance before
us, some secret and material defects. That
vigour of mind, that firmness of principle,
may be wanting, which is requisite for en∣abling
them to act with propriety, when
their virtue is put to a decisive trial. The
softness of their nature is unfavourable to a
steady perseverance in the course of inte∣grity.
They possess the amiable qualities;
but there is ground to suspect, that in the
estimable ones they are deficient. While,
therefore, we by no means class them among
the bad, we dare not give them the full
praise of virtue. When they set out in the
world, we cannot pronounce with confi∣dence,
what confirmed features their cha∣racter
will assume; nor how far they can
be depended upon, in future life. Allow
me now to point out the dangers which
<PB N="291" REF="304"/>
such persons are most likely to incur; and
to show what is requisite for them farther
to study, in order to their fulfilling the part
of good men and true Christians.</P>
<P>I. PERSONS of this description are not
qualified for discharging aright many du∣ties,
to which their situation in life may
call them. In certain circumstances, they
behave with abundance of propriety. When
all is calm and smooth around them; when
nothing occurs to agitate the mind, or to
disturb the tenor of placid life, none of
their defects come forward. They are be∣loved;
and they are useful. They promote
the comfort of human society; and, by
gentleness, and courtesy of manners, serve
to cement men together in agreeable union.
But to sail on the tranquil surface of an
unrussled lake, and to steer a safe course
through a troubled and stormy ocean, re∣quire
different talents: and alas! human
life oftener resembles the stormy ocean,
than the unruffled lake. We shall not
have been long embarked, without find∣ing
<PB N="292" REF="305"/>
the resemblance to hold too close∣ly.</P>
<P>Amidst the bustle of the world, amidst
the open contentions, and secret enmities,
which prevail in every society, mildness
and gentleness alone, are not sufficient to
carry us, with honour, through the duties
of our different stations; as heads of fami∣lies,
citizens, subjects, magistrates, or as
engaged in the pursuits of our several call∣ings.
Disturbances and trials arise, which
demand vigorous exertions of all the moral
powers; of patience, vigilance, and self∣denial;
of constancy and fortitude, to sup∣port
us under danger and reproach; of
temperance, to restrain us from being car∣ried
away by pleasure; of firm and deter∣mined
principle, to make us despise the
brides of sin. These many dispositions of
mind are indispensably necessary to prepare
one, for surmounting the discouragements
of virtue; and for struggling honourably
through the hardships of life. Unless he
be thus armed and fortified, whatever good
intentions have been in his heart, they are
<PB N="293" REF="306"/>
likely to be frustrated in action. Nothing
that is great, can be undertaken. Nothing
that is difficult or hazardous, can be accom∣plished.
Nor are we to imagine, that it is
only in times of persecution, or war, or ci∣vil
commotions, that there is occasion for
those stronger, efforts, those masculine vir∣tues
of the soul, to be displayed. The pri∣vate,
and seemingly quiet, stations of life,
often call men forth, in the days of peace,
to severe trials of firmness and constancy.
The life of very few proceeds in so uniform
a train, as not to oblige them to discover,
in some situation or other, what portion
they possess of the estimable qualities of
man. Hence it sometimes happens, that
persons, whose manners were much less
promising and engaging than those of
others, have, nevertheless, when brought
to act a part in critical circumstances, per∣formed
that part with more unsullied ho∣nour,
and firmer integrity, than they.</P>
<P>II. PERSONS of the character I have de∣scribed
are ill fitted, not only for dischar∣ging
the higher duties of life, but also for
<PB N="294" REF="307"/>
resisting the common temptations to vice.
With good dispositions in their mind, with
a desire, like the young ruler in the text,
to know what they shall do, in order <HI>to in∣herit
eternal life;</HI> yet, when the terms re∣quired
of them interfere with any favou∣rite
enjoyment, like him, they are <HI>sorrow∣ful;
and go away.</HI> The particular trial to
which he was put, may appear to be a hard
one, and to exceed the ordinary rate of
virtue. Our Lord, who discerned his heart,
saw it to be necessary, in his case, for
bringing his character to the test. But in
cases, where trials of much less difficulty
present themselves, they who partake of a
character similar to his, are often found to
give way. The good qualities which they
possess, border on certain weaknesses of the
mind; and these weaknesses are apt to be∣tray
them insensibly into vices, with which
they are connected.</P>
<P>Good nature, for instance, is in dan∣ger
of running into that unlimited com∣plaisance,
which assimilates men to the
loose manners of those whom they find
around them. Pliant, and yielding in
<PB N="295" REF="308"/>
their temper, they have not force to stand
by the decisions of their own minds, with
regard to right and wrong. Like the a∣nimal
which is said to assume the colour
of every object to which it is applied, they
lose all proper character of their own; and
are formed by the characters of those with
whom they chance to associate.—The mild
are apt to sink into habits of indolence and
sloth. The chearful and gay, when warm∣ed
by pleasure and mirth, lose that sobriety
and self-denial, which is essentail to the
support of virtue.—Even modesty and
submission, qualities so valuable in them∣selves,
and so highly ornamental to youth,
sometimes degenerate into a vicious timi∣dity;
a timidity which restrains men from
doing their duty with firmness; which can∣not
stand the frown of the great, the re∣proach
of the multitude, or even the ridi∣cule
and sneer of the scorner.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more amiable than a
constant desire to please; and an unwilling∣ness
to offend or hurt. Yet in characters
where this is a predominant feature, de∣fects
<PB N="296" REF="309"/>
are often found. Fond always to ob∣lige,
and afraid to utter any disagreeable
truth, such persons are sometimes led to
dissemble. Their love of truth is sacrificed
to their love of pleasing. Their speech, and
their manners, assume a studied courtesy.
You cannot always depend on their smile;
nor, when they promise, be sure of the per∣formance.
They mean and intend well.
But the good intention is temporary. Like
wax, they yield easily to every impression;
and transient friendship contracted with
one person, is effaced by the next. Undis∣tinguishing
desire to oblige, often proves, in
the present state of human things, a dan∣gerous
habit. They who cannot, on many
occasions, give a firm and steady denial, or
who cannot break off a connection, which
has been hastily and improperly formed,
stand on the brink of many mischiefs.
They will be seduced by the corrupting,
ensuared by the artful, betrayed by those
in whom they had placed their trust. Un∣suspicious
themselves, they were flattered
with the belief of having many friends a∣round
<PB N="297" REF="310"/>
them. Elated with sanguine hopes,
and cheerful spirits, they reckoned, that <HI>to∣morrow
would be as this day, and more abun∣dant.</HI>
Injudicious liberality, and thought∣less
profusion, are the consequence; until,
in the end, the straits to which they are re∣duced,
bring them into mean or dishonour∣able
courses. Through innocent, but un∣guarded
weakness, and from want of the
severer virtues, they are, in process of time,
betrayed into downright crimes. Such may
be the conclusion of those, who, like the
young ruler before us, with many amiable
and promising dispositions, had begun their
career in life.</P>
<P>III. SUCH persons are not prepared for
sustaining, with propriety and dignity, the
distresses to which our state is liable. They
were equipped for the season of sunshine
and serenity; but when the sky is overcast,
and the days of darkness come, their feeble
minds are destitue of shelter, and ill pro∣vided
for defence. Then is the time, when
more hardy qualities are required; when
<PB N="298" REF="311"/>
courage must face danger, constancy sup∣port
pain, patience possess itself in the midst
of discouragements, magnanimity display
its contempt of threatenings. If those high
virtues be altogether strangers to the mind,
the mild and gentle will certainly sink un∣der
the torrent of disasters.—The ruler
in the text could plead, that his behaviour
to others, in the course of social life, had
been unexceptionable. So far, the reflec∣tion
on his conduct would afford him com∣fort
amidst adversity. But no man is with∣out
failings. In the dejecting season of
trouble, it will occur to every one, that he
has been guilty of frequent transgression;
that much of what ought to have been
done, was neglected; and that much of
what has been done, had better have been
omitted. In such situations, when a thou∣sand
apprehensions arise to alarm conscience,
nothing is able to quiet its uneasiness, ex∣cept
a well-grounded trust in the mercy
and acceptance of Heaven. It is firm reli∣gious
principle, acting upon a manly and
enlightened mind, that gives dignity to the
<PB N="299" REF="312"/>
character, and composure to the heart, un∣der
all the troubles of the world. This
enables the brave and virtuous man, with
success to buffet the storm. While he, who
had once sparkled in society with all the
charms of gay vivacity, and had been the
delight of every circle in which he was
engaged, remains dispirited, overwhelmed,
and annihilated, in the evil day.</P>
<P>SUCH are the failings incident to persons
of mixed and imperfect goodness: such
the defects of a character formed merely of
the amiable, without the estimable quail∣ties
of man.</P>
<P>It appears from this, that we must not
place too much trust in the fair appear∣ances,
which a character may at first exhi∣bit.
In judging of others, let us always
think the best, and employ the spirit of
charity and candour. But in judging of
ourselves, we ought to be more severe. Let
us remember him whom our Lord beheld,
and <HI>loved;</HI> and who yet fell short of the
kingdom of heaven. Let us not forget,
<PB N="300" REF="313"/>
that something more than gentleness and
modesty, than complacency of temper and
affability of manner, is requisite to form a
worthy man, or a true Christian. To a
high place in our esteem, these qualities are
justly intitled. They enter essentially into
every good man's character. They form
some of its most favourable distinctions.
But they constitute a part of it; not the
whole. Let us not, therefore, rest on them
entirely, when we conceive an idea of what
manner of persons we ought to be.</P>
<P>LET piety form the basis of firm and
established virtue. If this be wanting, the
character cannot be sound and entire. Mo∣ral
virtue will always be endangered, often
be overthrown, when it is separated from
its surest support. Confidence in God,
strengthened by faith in the great Redeem∣er
of mankind, not only, amidst the seve∣rer
trials of virtue, gives constancy to the
mind, but, by nourishing the hope of im∣mortality,
adds warmth and elevation to
the affections. They whose conduct is not
<PB N="301" REF="314"/>
animated by religious principle, are depri∣ved
of the most powerful incentive to wor∣thy
and honourable deeds.</P>
<P>Let such discipline, next, be studied, as
may form us to the active and manly vir∣tues.
To natural good affections, we can
never entirely trust our conduct. These,
as has been shown, may sometimes be
warped into what is wrong; and often will
prove insufficient, for carrying us rightly
through all the duties of life. Good affec∣tions
are highly valuable; but they must
be supported by fixed principles, cultivated
in the understanding, and rooted in the
heart. Habits must be acquired of tempe∣rance
and self-denial, that we may be able
to resist pleasure, and endure pain, when
either of them interfere with our duty;
that we may be prepared to make a sacri∣fice
of any worldly interest, when the voice
of God and conscience demand it. Let us
always remember, that without fortitude
of mind, there is no manhood; there can
be no perseverance in virtue. Let a sacred
and inviolable regard for truth reign in
<PB N="302" REF="315"/>
our whole behaviour. Let us be distin∣guished
for fidelity to every promise we
have made; and for constancy in every
worthy friendship we have formed. Let
no weak complaisance, no undue regard to
the opinions of men, ever make us betray
the rights of conscience. What we have
once, upon due consideration, adopted as
rules of conduct, to these let us adhere un∣shaken.
However the world may change
around us, let it find us the same in pro∣sperity
and adversity; faithful to God and
virtue; faithful to the convictions of our
own heart. What our lot in the world
may be, is not ours to foresee or determine.
But it is ours to resolve, that whatever it
shall be, it shall find us persevering in one
line of uprightness and honour.</P>
<P>BY such discipline, such attentions as
these, we are to guard against those fail∣ings,
which are sometimes found to stain
the most engaging characters. Joining in
proper union the amiable and the estimable
qualities, by the one we shall attract the
<PB N="303" REF="316"/>
good; and by the other, command respect
from the bad. We shall both secure our
own integrity, and shall exhibit to others a
proper view of what virtue is, in its native
grace and majesty. In one part of our
character, we shall resemble the flower that
smiles in spring; in another, the firmly∣rooted
tree, that braves the winter storm.
For, remember we must, that there is a
season of winter, as well as of spring and
summer, in human life; and it concerns
us to be equally prepared for both.</P>
<P>A higher and more perfect example of
such a character as I now recommend,
cannot be found, that what is presented to
us in the life of Jesus Christ. In him, we
behold all that is gentle, united with all
that is respectable. It is a remarkable ex∣pression,
which the Apostle Paul employs
concerning him; <HI>I beseech you by the meek∣ness
and gentleness of Christ</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 1.</NOTE>. Well might
these qualities be singled out, as those for
which he was known and distinguished.
<PB N="304" REF="317"/>
We see him in his whole behaviour affable,
courteous, and easy of access. He con∣versed
familiarly with all who presented
themselves; and despised not the meanest.
With all the infirmities of his disciples he
calmly bore; and his rebukes were mild,
when their provocations were great. He
wept over the calamities of his country,
which persecuted him; and apologised and
prayed for them who put him to death.
Yet the same Jesus we behold, awful in the
strictness of his virtue; inflexible in the
cause of truth; uncomplying with prevail∣ing
manners, when he found them cor∣rupt;
setting his face boldly against the
hypocritical leaders of the people; over∣awed
by none of their threatenings; in
the most indignant terms, reproving their
vices, and stigmatizing their characters.
We behold him gentle, without being tame;
firm, without being stern; courageous,
without being violent. <HI>Let this mind be in
us which was also in Jesus Christ;</HI> and we
shall attain to honour, both with God and
with man.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITH these words of our blessed Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XV.</NOTE>
the Evangelist concludes his account
of the institution of the sacrament of the
Supper. It is an institution which, solemn
and venerable in itself, is rendered still more
so, by the circumstances which accompanied
<PB N="306" REF="319"/>
it. Our Lord had now, for about three
years, continued <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appear in his public
character, in the land of Judea. He had,
all along, been watched with a jealous eye,
by his enemies; and the time was come,
when they were to prevail against him. A
few friends he had, from the beginning,
selected, who, in every vicissitude of his
state, remained faithfully attached to him.
With these friends he was now meeting for
the last time, on the very evening in which
he was betrayed and seized. He perfectly
knew all that was to befal him. He knew
that this was the last meal in which he was
to join with those, who had been the com∣panions
of all his labours, the confidents of
all his griefs; among whom he had passed
all the quiet and private moments of his life.
He knew, that within a few hours, he was
to be torn from this loved society, by a
band of ruffians; and by to-morrow, was
to be publicly arraigned, as a malefactor.
With a heart melting with tenderness, he
said to the twelve Apostles, as he sat down
with them at table, <HI>With desire I have desired
<PB N="307" REF="320"/>
to eat this passover with you before I suffer</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, xxii. 15.</NOTE>
And then, having gratified himself for the
last time in their society, and having insti∣tuted
that commemoration of his death
which was to continue in the Christian
church until the end of ages, he took a so∣lemn
and affectionate farewell of his friends,
in the words of the text, <HI>I say unto you,
that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
of the vine, until that day when I drink it
new with you in my Father's kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>As these words were uttered by our
Lord, in the prospect of his sufferings;
when preparing himself for death, and
looking forward to a future meeting with
his friends in heaven; let us, under this
view, consider the sacrement, which he
then instituted, as a preparation for all the
sufferings of life, and especially, a prepa∣ration
for death. It is fit and proper, that
such solemn prospects should enter into the
service which we are this day to perform.
We have no reason to imagine, that they
<PB N="308" REF="321"/>
will render it a gloomy service. A good
and wise man is often disposed to look for∣ward
to the termination of life. The num∣ber
of our days is determined by God; and
certainly it will not tend to shorten their
number, that we employ ourselves in pre∣paring
for death. On the contrary, while
our days last, it will tend to make us pass
them more comfortably, and more wisely.
Let us now then, as if for the last time we
were to partake of this sacrament, consider
how it may serve to prepare us for the dy∣ing
hour.</P>
<P>1. IT is a high exercise of all those dispo∣sitions
and affections, in which a good man
would wish to die. He would surely wish
to leave this world, in the spirit of devo∣tion
towards God, and of fellowship and
charity with all his brethren on earth.
Now, these are the very sentiments, which
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in∣spires
into the heart of every pious com∣municant.
It includes the highest acts of
devotion of which human nature is ca∣pable.
<PB N="309" REF="322"/>
It imports, a lively sense of the in∣finite
mercies of Heaven; of the gratitude
we owe to that God, who, by the death of
his Son, hath restored the forfeited happi∣ness
and hopes of the human race. It im∣ports,
the consecration of the soul to God;
the entire resignation of ourselves, and all
our concerns, into his hands; as to the God
whom we serve and love; the guardian in
whom we confide. <HI>To thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my soul. I will go to that altar of God, to God
my exceeding joy. I will come into thy house
in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear,
I will worship towards thy holy temple</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xliii. 4.; v. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These devout affections towards God are,
on this occasion, necessarily accompanied
with benevolent dispositions towards men,
Our communion is not only with God, but
with one another. In this solemn service,
the distinction of ranks is abolished. We
assemble in common before our great
Lord, professing ourselves to be all mem∣bers
of his family, and children of the
same Father. No feud, nor strife, nor en∣mity,
<PB N="310" REF="323"/>
is permitted to approach the sacred
table. All within that hallowed space
breathes peace, and concord, and love. <HI>If
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there re∣memberest
that thy brother hath ought against
thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and
go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother;
and then come and offer thy gift</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew, v. 23. 24.</NOTE>. What can
be more becoming men and Christians,
than such sentiments of piety to the great
Father of the universe; gratitude to the
merciful Redeemer of mankind; and cha∣rity
and forgiveness towards all our bre∣thren?
Is not this the temper in which a
good man would wish to live? more espe∣cially,
is not this the frame of mind which
will give both dignity and peace to his last
moments? How discomposed and embit∣tered
will these important moments prove,
if, with a mind soured by the remembrance
of unforgiven injuries, with a breast rankled
by enmity, which a heart alienated from
God, and insensible to devotion, one be
forced away from life?</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="324"/>
Contemplate the manner in which our
blessed Lord died; which the service of this
day brings particularly into your view.
You behold him, amidst the extremity of
pain, calm and collected within himself;
possessing his spirit with all the serenity
which sublime devotion, and exalted bene∣volence
inspire. You hear him, first, la∣menting
the fate of his unhappy country;
next, when he was fastened to the cross,
addressing words of consolation to his af∣flicted
parent; and lastly, sending up pray∣ers,
mixed with compassionate apologies,
for those who were shedding his blood.
After all those exercises of charity, you be∣hold
him in an act of devout adoration and
trust, resigning his breath; <HI>Father, into thy
hands I commend my spirit.</HI>—Can any death
be pronounced unhappy, how distressful so∣ever
its circumstances may be, which is
thus supported, and dignified? What could
we wish for more in our last moments, than
with this peaceful frame of mind, this calm
of all the affections, this exaltation of heart
<PB N="312" REF="325"/>
towards God, this diffusion of benevolence
towards men, to bid adieu to the world?</P>
<P>If, in such a spirit as this, we would all
wish to die, let us think, that now is the
time to prepare for it, by seasonably cul∣tivating
this spirit while we live; by im∣bibing,
in particular, from the holy sacra∣ment,
those dispositions and affections
which we would wish to possess at our
latest period. It is altogether vain to ima∣gine,
that when the hour of death ap∣proaches,
we shall be able to form our∣selves
into the frame of mind which is then
most proper and decent. Amidst the strug∣gles
of nature, and under the load of sick∣ness
or pain, it is not time for unaccustom∣ed
exertions to be made, or for new refor∣mations
to be begun. <HI>Sufficient,</HI> and more
than sufficient, <HI>for that day is the evil there∣of.</HI>
It will be too late to assume then the
hero, or the saint, if we have been totally
unacquainted with the character before.
The sentiments we would display, and the
language we would utter, will be alien and
strange to us. They will be forced, and fo∣reign
<PB N="313" REF="326"/>
to the heart. It is only in conse∣quence
of habits acquired in former and
better days, that a temper of piety and
charity can grow up into such strength, as
to confer peace and magnanimity on the
concluding hours of life. Peculiarly fa∣vourable
to the acquisition of such a tem∣per,
are the devotions of this day. In this
view, let us perform them; and study to
be at the table of the Lord, what we would
wish to be when the summons of death shall
come.</P>
<P>II. THIS sacrament becomes a prepara∣tion
for death, by laying a foundation for
peace with God. What is important at the
close of life, is not only the temper in
which we leave the world, but the situation
in which we stand with respect to that
great Judge, before whom we are about to
appear. This view of our situation is apt
to escape us, during the ordinary course of
life. Occupied with the affairs and con∣cerns
of this world; flattered by those illu∣sive
colours of innocence and virtue, in
<PB N="314" REF="327"/>
which self-love dresses up our character,
apprehensions of guilt create little uneasi∣ness
to the multitude of men. But, on the
approach of death, their ideas change. As
the inquisition of the supreme Judge draws
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh, remembered transgressions crowd up∣on
the mind. Guilt becomes strongly rea∣lised
to the imagination; and alarms, be∣fore
unknown, begin to arise. Hence the
anxiety, in the prospect of a future invi∣sible
world, which is so often seen to attend
the bed of death. Hence those various me∣thods,
which superstition has devised for
quieting this anxiety; the trembling mind
eagerly grasping every feeble plank on
which it can lay hold; and flying for pro∣tection
to the most unavailing aid. The
stoutest spirits have been then known to
bend; the proudest hearts, to be humbled.
They who are now most thoughtless about
their spiritual concerns, may, perhaps, be
in this state before they die.</P>
<P>The dispensation of grace, discovered in
the gospel, affords the only remedy against
those terrors, by the promise of pardon, ex∣tended
<PB N="315" REF="328"/>
to the penitent, through the merits
of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is the very
essence of this sacrament, to exhibit this
promised grace to mankind; <HI>My body which
was broken for you; my blood shed for many,
for the remission of sins.</HI> Here, shines from
above, the ray of hope. Divine justice, we
are assured, is not inexorable. Divine mer∣cy
is accessible, to all who believe and re∣pent.
The participation of this sacrament,
Therefore naturally imparts comfort to the
Worthy communicant; as it supposes, on
his part, a cordial compliance with those
terms, on which pardon is offered by the
gospel to mankind.</P>
<P>I mean not to say, that the participation
of this sacrament, how pious and proper
soever our dispositions at the time may be,
is, of itself, sufficient to ensure us of com∣fort
at death. It were unwarrantable to
flatter Christians, with hopes to this extent.
No single act of the most fervent devotion
can afford assured hopes of peace with Hea∣ven,
until these hopes be confirmed by the
succeeding tenor of a good life. But what
<PB N="316" REF="329"/>
may safely be asserted is, that communica∣ting
in a proper manner, makes way for
such hopes. It is an introduction to that
state of reconciliation with God, which will
give you peace in death. It is the begin∣ning
of a good course, which, if duly pur∣sued,
will make your latter end blessed. It
is the entrance of <HI>the path of the just;</HI> the
morning of that <HI>light, which shineth more
and more unto the perfect day.</HI> For this holy
sacrament is a professed renunciation of the
vices and corruptions of the world. It is
a professed dereliction of former evil ha∣bits;
a solemn return, on our part, to God
and virtue, under the firm trust, that God
will, through Jesus Christ, show mercy to
the frailties of the penitent. If you conti∣nue
to support the character which you
this day assume, the invisible world will no
longer present to you a scence of terrors.
You will be comforted with the view of
goodness and compassion, as predominant
in the administration of the universe. Af∣ter
having finished a virtuous course, you
will be able to look up to that God whom
<PB N="317" REF="330"/>
you have worshipped, and to say, <HI>I know
in whom I have trusted. Though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil; for thou art with me. Thy
rod and thy staff shall comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>III. THIS sacrament prepares us for a
happy death, by strengthening the connec∣tion
between Christians, and Christ their
Saviour. This is a connection which, in
various ways, redounds to their benefit;
and will be found particularly consolatory
at the hour of death. The awful majesty
of Heaven is in danger of overwhelming
the mind, in the feeble moments of depart∣ing
life. The reverence it inspires is ming∣led
with sensations of dread, which might
be too strong for us then to bear. When
we look up to it, through a Mediator and
Intercessor, that Majesty assumes a milder
aspect, and appears to invite our approach.
Whatever, therefore, forms a connection
with this great Mediator, this powerful
friend and patron of the human race, must
be most desirable to every one, especially to
<PB N="318" REF="331"/>
the dying man. Now, this sacrament u∣nites
us closely with him. It is the oath of
our allegiance. It is the act of enlisting
ourselves under the banner of this divine
Leader. Of course, it strengthens our faith
in him, as our guide through life, and our
guardian and protector in death. It gives
us a title to look up to him, under the
confidence of that reciprocal engagement,
which fidelity on the one hand is always
understood to imply, of protection on the
other.</P>
<P>His participation of our nature conveys
a degree of encouragement, which we could
derive from no being altogether celestial,
how gracious or benign soever. In our ut∣most
extremity, we can have recourse to
his sympathizing aid, who had experience
both of the distresses of life, and of the
terrors of death. We behold, in the text,
with what firm tranquillity he looked for∣ward
to his approaching sufferings. Sin∣cere
attachment to our great Master, may
be expected to infuse into us some degree
of the same happy composure of mind. It
<PB N="319" REF="332"/>
is owing to our losing out of view this per∣fect
model; to our following the crowd,
and adopting the common spirit of the
world, that we become mean-spirited and
base; servilely attached to life, and afraid
to die. Did we, according to our engage∣ments
at the Lord's table, keep our eye
fixed on our divine Leader, and study to
follow his steps, a portion of this spirit
would descend upon us at the hour of
death. It would be as the mantle of Eli∣jah,
falling on a chosen disciple; and would
enable us, as it did Elisha of old, to smite,
and divide the waters.—We believe our
Saviour now to rule in the world of spirits.
The grave, therefore, bars not his follow∣ers
from access to him. In the grave, for
our sake, he once lay down, that he might
dispel the gloom which appears to us to
cover that formidable mansion. In a short
time he arose from it, in order to assure us,
that the dark and narrow house was not to
confine his followers for ever. By his
death, he conquered death; and him that
had the power of it; and his voice to us
<PB N="320" REF="333"/>
is, <HI>Because I live, ye shall live also.</HI> Hence,
as long as we preserve that attachment to
him which we this day profess, we are fur∣nished
with a variety of considerations pro∣per
for supporting us in the prospect of our
dissolution.—This leads me to observe,</P>
<P>IV. THAT the sacrament of which we
are to partake, prepares us for death, by
confirming and enlivening our hope of im∣mortality.
In this sacrament, my friends,
you act for both worlds. As inhabitants
of the earth, you are on this day to look
forward, with care, to your future beha∣viour
in it. For you are not, by any means
disengaging yourselves totally from this life,
and its concerns. On the contrary, you
are forming, and even strengthening, those
connections, which virtue requires you to
maintain with you friends, and fellow∣creatures
around you.—At the same time,
you are not to consider yourselves as citi∣zens
of earth only; but also as citizens of
heaven. You are to recognise, on this oc∣casion,
your relation to a higher and better
<PB N="321" REF="334"/>
country, with which you are connected by
the most facred ties; and from which you
derive those comforts and hopes, that will
both purify your life, and render your
death happy. The sacrament of the supper
is, in this view, an ascent of the mind a∣bove
terrestrial things. At the Lord's table,
we associate ourselves, in some degree, with
spirits of a more exalted order. We de∣clare,
that we are tending towards their so∣ciety;
and have fixed our final rest within
the veil. This view of the institution, so
comfortable to the last period of life, is
plainly given us in the words of the text.
For it is worthy of particular observation,
that, as soon as our Lord had instituted
this sacrament, he straightway leads the
thoughts of his disciples to a state of future
existence. Employing that metaphorical
style, which the occasion naturally suggest∣ed,
he tells them, that though he was not
henceforth to drink of the fruit of the vine
on earth, yet a day was coming, when he
was again to drink it <HI>with them;</HI> to drink
it, <HI>in his Father's kingdom.</HI> Two distinct
<PB N="322" REF="335"/>
ideas are, in these words, presented to us.
One is, the abode into which our Saviour
was to remove; <HI>his Father's kingdom.</HI> The
other, the society which he was there to en∣joy;
<HI>with you, in my Father's kingdom.</HI> These
correspond to the two views, under which
death is most formidable to men; both of
which he intended to banish, by the insti∣tution
of this sacrament: first, that death
is a transition to a new and unknown
world; and next, that it is a final separa∣tion
from all the friends whom we have
loved on earth.</P>
<P>FIRST; if death terminates our existence
here, the abode to which it translates the
faithful followers of Christ, is the kingdom
of his Father. The institution of this sa∣crament
dispels of the gloomy ideas of an∣nihilation,
of non-existence, of total dark∣ness,
which our imagination is ready to as∣sociate
with the grave. We are here assu∣red,
that, to good men, death is not the
close of being, but a change of state; a re∣moval,
from a distant and obscure province
<PB N="323" REF="336"/>
of the universe, into the city of God,
the chief seat of their Father's kingdom.
They have every reason to believe, that
the objects which are to meet them there,
how new and unknown soever, shall all be
propitious and friendly. For into the king∣dom
of his Father, their Lord has decla∣red,
that he is entered as their <HI>forerunner.
I go to my Father, and your Father; to my
God, and your God. In my Father's house are
many mansions. I go to prepare a place for
you. I will come again, and receive you to
myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.</HI>
What reasonings, what speculations, can
have power to impart so much peace to the
dying man, as a promise so direct and ex∣plicit,
coming from him who is truth itself,
and cannot lie? <HI>If it were not so, I would
have told you</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, xiv. 2.</NOTE> The prospect becomes still
more chearing and relieving, when we in∣clued,</P>
<P>THE other circumstance mentioned in
<PB N="324" REF="337"/>
the text; the society to be enjoyed in that
future state of being. <HI>With you, I shall
drink of the fruit of the vine in my Father's
kingdom.</HI> In how amiable a light does our
Saviour here appear, looking forward to a
future reunion with those beloved friends,
whom he was now leaving, as to a circum∣stance
which should increase both his own
felicity and theirs, when they met again in
a happier world! Thus, in the most affec∣tionate
manner, chearing their drooping
and dejected spirits; and, by a similar pro∣spects,
providing for the comfort of his fol∣lowers
in future generations, when they
should be about to leave the world.</P>
<P>The expressions in the text plainly suggest
a joyful intercourse among friends, who
had been separated by death: and therefore
seem to give much confirmation, to what
has always been a favourite hope of good
men; that friends shall know and recog∣nise
each other, and renew their former
connections, in a future state of existence.
How many pleasing prospects, does such an
intimation open to the mind! How much
<PB N="325" REF="338"/>
does it tend to compensate the vanity of life,
and to mitigate the sorrows of death! For
it is not to be denied, that one of the most
bitter circumstances attending death, is the
final separation from beloved friends. This
is apt equally to wring the hearts of the
dying, and the surviving; and it is an an∣guish
of that sort, which descends most
deeply into the virtuous and worthy breast.
When, surrounded with an affectionate fa∣mily,
and weeping friends, a good man is
taking his last adieu of all whom he held
most dear on earth; when, with a feeble
voice, he is giving them his blessing, before
he leaves them for ever; when, for the
last time, he beholds the countenance, he
touches the hand, he hears the voice, of the
person nearest his heart; who could bear
this bitterness of grief, if no support were
to be ministered by religious hope? if there
were no voice to whisper to our spirits, that
hereafter we, and those whom we love,
shall meet again in a more blissful land?
—What higher view can possibly be gi∣ven,
of the benefit redounding from this
<PB N="326" REF="339"/>
divine institution, than its affording us con∣solation
in such situations of extreme di∣stress,
by realising to our souls the belief
of an immortal state, in which all the vir∣tuous
and worthy shall be reunited in the
presence of their common Lord?</P>
<P>THUS I have set before you many consi∣derations,
arising from the sacrament of
our Lord's supper, which render it a pro∣per
preparation, not only for a good life,
but for a comfortable and happy death.
The great improvement to be made of the
subject is, to bring to the altar of God
such dispositions of heart, as may give us
ground to hope for this blessed effect. Let
us approach to the sacrament with the same
seriousness of frame, as if it were the last
time we were ever to partake of it; as if we
were now making provision for a journey
to that land whence none return; as if we
were never to <HI>drink,</HI> in this manner, <HI>of the
fruit of the vine, until that day when we drink
it,</HI> with those whom we have loved, <HI>in our
Father's kingdom.</HI>—God only knows to
<PB N="327" REF="340"/>
whom this may be truly spoken! God
knows who, of this assembly, shall never
have opportunity to approach again to the
sacred table, and to meet with their bre∣thren,
on such an occasion, in the courts
of the Lord's house!—Whatever our doom
is to be, whether we are appointed for life
or for death, such is the frame of mind
which now best becomes, and will most
improve us, in partaking of the holy sacra∣ment.</P>
<P>LET me caution you, before I conclude,
against judging of the propriety of your
disposition in this solemn act of worship,
solely by the warmth of your affections,
and the fervour of your devotion. This
state of heart, how desirable soever it may
be, cannot be at all times possessed. It de∣pends,
in some measure, on natural sensi∣bility.
All are not equally endowed with
warm and tender feelings. Even they who
are susceptible of the highest degrees of
pious and virtuous sensibility, cannot, on
every occasion, command that happy tem∣perature
<PB N="328" REF="341"/>
of mind. We are not, therefore,
to judge unfavourably of ourselves, if this
be not always the privilege of our devo∣tions.
It is chiefly a sedate and compo∣sed
frame of spirit, that we must study to
cultivate; arising from grave and sober
thoughts; from serious and penitent recol∣lection
of past errors; from good purposes
for the future; and from a deep sense of
the approaching events of death and im∣mortality.
Penetrated with such disposi∣tions,
you have ground to come to the al∣tar
of God with humble trust and joy;
under the belief, that you are approaching,
through the great Redeemer, to that mer∣ciful
Creator, to whom, <HI>in the high and holy
Place of eternity,</HI> the devout aspirations of
his servants on earth, are ever acceptable
and pleasing.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the USE and ABUSE of the WORLD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CORINTHIANS, vii. 31.</BIBL>
<Q>—They that use this world, as not abusing it.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE world is always represented in
Scripture as the great scene of trial to
a Christian.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVI.</NOTE> It sets before him a variety of
duties, which are incumbent on him to per∣form;
and, at the sam time, surrounds
him with many dangers, against which he
has to guard. The part which is proper
for him to act, may be comprised in these
two expressive words of the text; <HI>using the
world, and not abusing it;</HI> the significancy
and extent of which, I purpose now to ex∣plain.
The subject is of the higher im∣portance,
<PB N="330" REF="343"/>
as in the world we must live;
and according as we use, or abuse it, it will
prove either our friend, or our greatest
foe.</P>
<P>It is natural to begin with observing,
that the Christian is here supposed to <HI>use
the world;</HI> by which we must certainly un∣derstand
the Apostle to mean, maintaining
intercourse and connection with the world;
living in it, as one of the members of hu∣man
society; assuming that rank which
belongs to his station. No one can be said
to <HI>use the world</HI> who lives not thus. Hence
it follows, that sequestration from the world
is no part of Christian duty; and it ap∣pears
strange, that even among those who
approve not of monastick confinement, se∣clusion
from the pleasures of society should
have been sometimes considered, as belong∣ing
to the character of a religious man.
They have been supposed to be the best
servants of God, who, consecrating their
time to the exercises of devotion, mingle
least in the ordinary commerce of the
world; and especially who abstain most
<PB N="331" REF="344"/>
rigidly from all that has the appearance of
amusement. But how pious and sincere
soever the intentions of such persons may
be, they certainly take not the properest
method, either for improving themselves, or
for advancing religion among others. For
this is not using the world, but relinquish∣ing
it. Instead of making the light of a
good example shine with useful splendour
throughout the circle of society, they con∣fine
it within a narrow compass. Accord∣ing
to the metaphor employed by our Sa∣viour,
after the <HI>candle is lighted, they put it
under a bushel.</HI> Instead of recommending
religion to the world, they exhibit it un∣der
the forbidding aspect of unnecessary au∣sterity.
Instead of employing their influ∣ence,
to regulate and temper the pleasures
of the world, by a moderate participation
of those that are innocent, they deliver up
all the entertainments of society, into the
hands of the loose and giddy.</P>
<P>The various dangers which the world
presents to one who is desirous of main∣taining
his piety and integrity, have given
<PB N="332" REF="345"/>
rise to this scrupulous caution concerning
the use of the world; and so far, the prin∣ciple
is commendable. But we must re∣member,
that the virtue of a Christian is
to be shown, in surmounting dangers which
he is called o encounter. Into the post of
danger we were ordered by Providence,
when we were brought into this world.
We were placed as soldiers, on the field of
battle. It is there, that our fidelity to our
great Commander must appear. The most
signal virtues which adorn and improve the
human character, are displayed in active
life. There, the strength of the mind is
brought forth, and put to the test. There,
all the amiable dispositions of the heart find
their proper exercise: humanity is culti∣vated;
patience, fortitude, and self-denial,
come forward in all their forms; and the
light of good men's works so shines before
others, as to lead them to <HI>glorify their Fa∣ther
which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It may be assumed, therefore, as a prin∣ciple
justified by the text, and by the whole
strain of Scripture, that <HI>to use,</HI> and in a cer∣tain
<PB N="333" REF="346"/>
degree to enjoy, <HI>the world,</HI> is altoge∣ther
consistent with religion. According
to the rank which men possess in society,
according to their age, their employment
and connections, their intercourse with the
world will be more or less extended. In
private life, they use the world with pro∣priety,
who are active and industrious in
their callings; just and upright in their
dealings; sober, contented, and chearful in
their station. When the circumstances of
men allow them a wider command of the
enjoyments of the world, of those enjoy∣ments
they may freely partake, within the
bounds of temperance, moderation, and
decency. The highest situations of rank
and opulence, ought to be distinguished by
dignity of character; by extensive benefi∣cence,
usefulness, and public spirit; by
magnificence, without ostentation; and ge∣nerous
hospitality, without profusion.</P>
<P>We shall have a clearer view of the pro∣per
use of the world, when we contrast it
with that abuse of the world, which we too
often observe. Those abuses manifest them∣selves
<PB N="334" REF="347"/>
in various forms; but in general may
be classed under three great heads.</P>
<P>I. They are abusers of the world, who
intemperately give themselves up to its plea∣sures,
and lead a life of licentiousness,
riot, and dissipation. Amidst the wealth
and luxury of the present age, it will be
admitted, that persons of this description
are not unfrequent, who, being opulent in
fortune, and perhaps high in rank, think
themselves intitled to pass their days in a
careless manner, without any other object
in view, than the gratification of their senses
and passions. It shall be granted, that they
are not obliged to that exact oeconomy and
attention in their manner of living, which
the state of fortune may require of others.
Gaiety shall be permitted to them; change
of scene, and variety of amusements. But
let them not forget, that as men and mem∣bers
of society, not to say professors of the
Christian faith, they are bound to stop short
in their career of pleasure, as soon as it be∣comes
disgraceful to themselves, and hurt∣ful
<PB N="335" REF="348"/>
to the world. By the train of life which
they lead, they defeat every purpose for
which Providence bestowed on them the
blessings of prosperity. They sink every
talent which they possess, into useless insig∣nificancy.
They corrupt the public man∣ners
by their examples; and diffuse among
others the spirit of extravagance and folly.
They behave in a manner altogether un∣suitable
to the condition of the world in
which we live; where we are exposed to so
much change, surrounded with so much
distress, and daily behold so many affecting
scenes, as ought to awaken serious reflec∣tion,
and chasten dissolute mirth.</P>
<P>With indignant eyes, the sober and think∣ing
part of mankind, view the luxury and
riot of those abusers of the world. To them
are owing the discontents of the poor, their
disaffection to their superiors, their prone∣ness
to disturb the peace of the world.
When the poor behold wealth properly
used, they look up with respect to them
who possess it. They rest contented in
their station; and bless the just and the ge∣nerous,
<PB N="336" REF="349"/>
from whose munificence they re∣ceive
employment and reward. But when
they behold those men of pleasure dissipa∣ting,
in vice and folly, the fortune which
their forefathers had honourably earned;
when they behold them oppressing all their
dependents, merely that they may revel in
luxurious extravagance, then their hearts
swell within them; with murmurs of sul∣len
grief, they eye their own mean habita∣tion,
and needy family; and become pre∣pared
for robbery, tumult, sedition, and
every evil work.</P>
<P>The conduct of such abusers of the
world, is not only pernicious to the wel∣fare
of society, and to the interests of vir∣tue;
it is equally ruinous to themselves.
I shall not insist on the loss of reputation,
the waste of fortune, the broken health,
and debilitated frame, which are the well∣known
consequences of a life of intempe∣rate
pleasure. I shall not recount all the
better and more substantial enjoyments
which they forfeit. Amidst the turbulence
of riot, and the fumes of intoxication, un∣known
<PB N="337" REF="350"/>
to them are the rational entertain∣ments
of regular life; the enjoyment of the
face of nature; the pleasures of knowledge,
and an improved mind; the pleasures of
private friendship, and domestic society;
the conscious satisfaction which accompa∣nies
honourable labours, and the justly ac∣quired
esteem of those who surround them.
All these they have thrown away; and in
their room have substituted, what they
think more high and vivid pleasures. But
of what nature are those pleasures? <HI>Even in
laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of
that mirth is heaviness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the hearts of all men,
there lies a secret sense of propriety, virtue,
and honour. This sense may be so far blunt∣ed,
as to lose its influence in guiding men to
what is right, while yet it retains its power
of making them feel that they are acting
wrong. Hence remorse often gnaws the
heart, which affects to appear light, and gay,
before the world. Among the crowd of a∣musements,
<PB N="338" REF="351"/>
the voluptuary may endea∣deavour
to stifle his uneasiness; but through
all his defences it will penetrate. A con∣scious
sense of his own insignificance, when
he sees others distinguished for acting a
manly and worthy part; reflection on the
time he has wasted, and the contempt he
has incurred; the galling remembrance of
his earlier and better days, when he gave
the fair promise of accomplishments, which
now are blasted, have frequently been found
to sadden the festive hour. The noise of
merriment may be heard; but heaviness
lies at the heart. While the tabret and the
viol play, a melancholy voice founds in his
ears. The wasted estate, the neglected halls,
and ruined mansion of his fathers, rise to
view. The angry countenances of his
friends, seem to stare him in the face. A
hand appears to come forth on the wall,
and to write his doom.</P>
<P>Retreat then, from your dishonourable
courses, ye who by licentiousness, extra∣vagance,
and vice, are abusers of the world!
you are degrading, you are ruining your∣selves.
<PB N="339" REF="352"/>
You are grossly misemploying the
gifts of God; and the giver will not fail to
punish. Awake to the pursuits of men of
virtue, and honour. Break loose from that
magic circle, within which you are at pre∣sent
held. Reject the poisoned cup which
the enchantress Pleasure holds up to your
lips. Draw aside the veil which she throws
over your eyes. You will then see other
objects than you now behold. You will
see a dark abyss opening below your feet.
You will see virtue and temperance mark∣ing
out the road, which conducts to true
felicity. You will be enabled to discern, that
the world is enjoyed to advantage, by none
but such as follow those divine guides; and
who consider pleasure as the seasoning, but
not as the business of life.</P>
<P>II. THE world is abused, not only by an
intemperate pursuit of its pleasures, but by
a fordid attachment to its gains. This respects
a set of men of very different de∣scription
from the former; more decent in
their carriage, and less flagrant in their
<PB N="340" REF="353"/>
vices; but corrupted by the world in no
less a degree. For the world is often abused
by the men of business, as much as by the
men of pleasure. When worldly success
becomes the sole object of their life; when
the accumulation of fortune so engrosses
them, as to harden their heart against eve∣ry
feeling of moral obligation; when it
renders them insensible to the calls of af∣fection,
and to the impressions of piety
and religion; they then come under the
class of the covetous, whom, it is said, <HI>the
Lord abhorreth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm x. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>The world, with its advantages, is a
lawful object of pursuit to a Christian.
He may seek, by fair industry, to ren∣der
his circumstances affluent. Without
reproof, he may aim at distinction and
consideration in the world. He may be∣stow
a considerable portion of his time and
attention, on the successful management of
his worldly interests. All this is within the
limits of that allowable use of the world, to
which religion gives its sanction. But to
<PB N="341" REF="354"/>
a wise and good man, the world is only a
secondary object. He remembers there is
an eternity beyond it. His care is, not
merely to amass and possess, but to use his
possessions well, as one who is accountable
to God, He is not a slave, either to the
hopes, or the fears of the world. He would
rather forfeit any present advantage, than
obtain it at the expence of violating the di∣vine
law or neglecting his duty. This is
using the world like a good man. This is
living in it, as a subject of God, and a
member of the great community of man∣kind.
To such a man, riches are a bles∣sing.
He may enjoy them with magnifi∣cence;
but he will use them with liberali∣ty.
They open a wide field to the exercise
of his virtue, and allow it to shine with
diffusive lustre.</P>
<P>Very opposite to this, is the character of
the worldly-minded. To them, the mere
attainment of earthly possessions, is an ulti∣mate
aim. They cannot be said to <HI>use the
world;</HI> for to possess, not to use or enjoy,
is their object. They are emphatically said
<PB N="342" REF="355"/>
in Scripture, to <HI>load themselves with thick
clay</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habakkuk, ii. 6.</NOTE> Some sort of apology may be framed
for them who seek to extract from the
world, pleasure of one kind or other. But
for those who know no pleasure, farther
than <HI>adding house to house, and field to field,</HI>
and calling them their own, it is hardly
possible to frame any apology. Such per∣sons
are idolaters of the worst kind; for
they have made the world their God. They
daily worship and bow down before it;
and hold nothing to be mean or base, which
can promote the enlargement of their for∣tune.
—He is an abuser of the world, let
his possession of it be ever so ample, who
knows nothing higher than the gains of the
world. He is an abuser of the world, who
sacrifices probity, virtue, or humanity, to
its interests. He is an abuser of the world,
who cannot occasionally retreat from it, to
consider what character he bears in the
sight of God; and to what issue his con∣duct
will bring him at last. In a word, the
<PB N="343" REF="356"/>
world is then properly used, when it is ge∣nerously
and beneficently enjoyed; neither
hoarded up by avarice, nor squandered by
ostentation.</P>
<P>III. THE world is abused, by those who
employ its advantages to the injury or op∣pression
of their brethren. Under this class
are included, the world and most criminal
abusers of the world; who turn against
their fellow - creatures, those advantages
with which it has pleased Heaven to distin∣guish
them. It is a class which compre∣hends,
the sovereign who tyrannises over his
people; the great man who oppresses his
dependents; the master who is cruel to his
servants; every one, in fine, who renders
his superiority of any kind, whether of
wealth or power, unnecessarily grievous to
those who are his inferiors: Whose super∣ciliousness
dejects the modest; whose inso∣lence
tramples on the poor; whose rigour
makes the widow and the orphan weep.
Persons of this character, while thus abu∣sing
<PB N="344" REF="357"/>
the advantages of the world, may, for
a while, enjoy their triumph. But let them
not think, their triumph is always to last.
Their turn shall come, to be humbled as
low as those whom they now oppress. For
there is a vigilant eye ill the heavens, atten∣tive
to observe their procedure. There is
an impartial ear, which listens to every just
complaint preferred against them. There
is an irresistible arm stretched over their
heads, whose weight they shall one day
feel. The Sovereign of the universe cha∣racterises
himself in the sacred writings, as
peculiarly an adversary to the insolent and
haughty. <HI>For the oppression of the poor, for
the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith
the Lord; I will set him in safety from him
that, puffeth at him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xii. 5.</NOTE> I will come near to you
in judgement; and I will be a swift witness
against those that oppress the hireling in his
wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and
that turn aside the stranger from his right<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malachi, iii. 5.</NOTE>
He that oppresseth the poor, reproacheth his
<PB N="345" REF="358"/>
<HI>Maker</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 31.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord will plead their cause;
and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After hearing these awful words, is it
not srange, O men, at once infatuated and
cruel! that you cannot use the world, with∣out
abusing it, to the distress of your bre∣thren?
Even supposing no punishment to
be threatened, no arm to be lifted up a∣gainst
you, is there nothing within you,
that relents at the circumstances of those
below you in the world? Is it not enough,
that they suffer their own hard fate, with∣out
its being aggravated, by your severity
and oppression? Why must the aged, the
poor, and the friendless, tremble at your
greatness? Cannot you be happy, unless
you make them eat their scanty morsel
in bitterness of heart? You happy!—profane
not the word—what is such happiness as
yours, compared with that of him who
could say, <HI>When the car heard me, then it
blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave
witness to me; because I delivered the poor
<PB N="346" REF="359"/>
that cried, and the fatherless, and him that
had none to help him. I was a father to the
poor. The blessing of him that was ready to
perish, came upon me; and I caused the widow's
heart to sing for joy.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, xxix. 11.—16.</NOTE> How properly did
such a man <HI>use the world,</HI> and with what
just honour did he flourish in it! <HI>Unto me
men gave car; they kept silence, and waited
for my counsel. The princes refrained talking.
The aged arose, and stood up. My root was
spread out by the waters; and the dew lay
upon my branch.</HI>—Not only unknown to
you are such pleasures of virtuous prospe∣rity;
but, even previous to prepared pu∣nishment,
be assured, that remorse is ap∣proaching
to wring your hearts. Of the
world, which you now abuse, in a short
time nothing shall remain, but the horror
arising from remembered crimes. The
wages you have detained, the wealth you
have squeezed from the needy, shall lie
heavy on your souls. The stately build∣ings
which your pride has erected, by means
<PB N="347" REF="360"/>
of violence and oppression, shall seem haunt∣ed
by injured ghosts. <HI>The stone shall cry
out of the wall; and the beam out of the tim∣ber
shall answer it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habak. ii. 11.</NOTE> When you lie on the
bed of death, the poor, whom you have
oppressed, shall appear to you, as gather∣ed
together; stretching forth their hands,
and lifting up their voices against you, at
the tribunal of Heaven. <HI>I have seen the
wicked great in power, and spreading himself
like a green bay-tree. But he passed away,
and was not. I sought him, but he could not be
found. They are brought down to desolation
in a moment, and utterly consumed with ter∣rors.
As a dream when one awaketh, so, O
Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise
their image</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxvii. 35.; lxxiii. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS I have shown what it is <HI>to use,</HI> and
what to <HI>abuse the world.</HI> When, according
to our different stations, we enjoy the ad∣vantages
of the world with propriety and
decency; temperate in our pleasures; mo∣derate
<PB N="348" REF="361"/>
in our pursuits of interest; mindful
of our duty to God, and, at the same time,
just, humane, and generous to our bre∣thren;
then, and then only, we <HI>use the
world,</HI> as becomes men, and Christians.
Within these limits, we may safely enjoy
all the comforts which the world affords,
and our station allows. But if we pass be∣yond
these boundaries, into the regions of
disorderly and vicious pleasure, of debasing
covetousness, or of oppressive insolence, the
world will then serve only to corrupt our
minds, and to accelerate our ruin. The
licentious, the avaricious, and the insolent,
form the three great classes of abusers of
the world.</P>
<P>Let not those who are in wealthy and
flourishing circumstances, complain of the
restraints which religious doctrine attempts
to impose on their enjoyments. For, to
what do these restraints amount? To no
more than this, that, by their pleasures,
they would neither injure themselves, nor
injure others. We call not on the young,
to relinquish their gaiety; nor on the rich,
<PB N="349" REF="362"/>
to forego their opulence; nor on the great,
to lay aside their state. We only call on
them, not to convert gaiety into licentious∣ness;
not to employ opulence in mere ex∣travagance;
nor to abuse greatness for the
oppression of their inferiors: While they
enjoy the world, not to forget that they are
the subjects of God, and are soon to pass
into another state. Let the motive by
which the Apostle enforces the exhortation
in the text, present itself to their thought;
<HI>Use this world as not abusing it; for the fa∣shion
of the world passeth away.</HI> Its pomp
and its pleasures, its riches, magnificence,
and glory, are no more than a transient
show. Every thing that we here enjoy,
changes, decays, and comes to an end. All
floats on the surface of a river, which, with
swift current, is running towards a bound∣less
ocean. Beyond this present scene of
things, above these sublunary regions, we
are to look for what is permanent and
stable. The world passes away; but God,
and heaven, and virtue, continue unchange∣ably
the same. We are soon to enter into
<PB N="350" REF="363"/>
eternal habitations: and into these, our
works shall follow us. The consequences
shall for ever remain of the part which we
have acted as good, or bad men; as faith∣ful
subjects of God, or as servants of a vain
world.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>I Will behave myself wisely,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVII.</NOTE> said the Psalmist
David, <HI>in a perfect way</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm ci. 2.</NOTE> Wisdom is
no less necessary in religious, and moral,
than in civil conduct. Unless there be a
proper degree of light in the understand∣ing,
it will not be enough that there are
good dispositions in the heart. Without
regular guidance, they will often err from
the right scope. They will be always wa∣vering
<PB N="352" REF="365"/>
and unsteady; nay, on some occa∣sions,
they may betray us into evil. This
is too much verified by that propensity to
run into extremes, which so often appears
in the behaviour of men. How many have
originally set out with good principles, and
intentions, who, through want of discre∣tion
in the application of their principles,
have in the end injured themselves, and
brought discredit on religion? There is a
certain temperate mean, in the observance
of which, piety and virtue consist. On
each side there lies a dangerous extreme.
Bewildering paths open; by deviating into
which, men are apt to forfeit all the praise
of their good intentions; and to finish
with reproach, what they had begun with
honour. This is the ground of the wise
man's exhortation in the text. <HI>Let thine
eyes look right on, and let thine eye-lids look
straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy
feel, and let all thy ways be established. Turn
not to the right hand, nor to the left; remove
thy foot from evil.</HI> In discoursing from these
words, I purpose to point out some of the
<PB N="353" REF="366"/>
extremes into which men are apt to run in
religion and morals; and to suggest direc∣tions
for guarding against them.</P>
<P>WITH regard to religious principle in
general, it may perhaps be expected, that
I should warn you of the danger of being,
on one hand, too rigid in adhering to it,
and, on the other hand, too easy in relax∣ing
it. But the distinction between these
supposed extremes, I conceive to have no
foundation. No man can be too strict, in
his adherence to a principle of duty. Here,
there is no extreme. All relaxation of prin∣ciple,
is criminal. What conscience dictates
is to be ever obeyed. Its commands are
universally sacred. Even though it should
be misled, yet, as long as we conceive it to
utter the voice of God, in disobeying it we
sin. The error, therefore, to be here a∣voided
is, not too scrupulous or tender re∣gard
to conscience, but too little care to
have conscience properly enlightened, with
respect to what is matter of duty and of
sin.—Receive not, without examination,
<PB N="354" REF="367"/>
whatever human tradition has consecrated
as sacred. Recur, on every occasion, to
those great fountains of light and know∣ledge,
which are opened to you in the pure
word of God. Distinguish, with care, be∣tween
the superstitious fancies of men, and
the everlasting commandments of God.
Exhaust not on trifles that zeal, which
ought to be reserved for the weightier mat∣ters
of the law. Overload not conscience,
with what is frivolous and unnecessary.
But when you have once drawn the line,
with intelligence and precision, between
duty and sin, that line you ought on no
occasion to transgress.</P>
<P>THOUGH there is no extreme in the reve∣rence
due to conscience, there may un∣doubtedly
be an extreme, in laying too
much stress, either on mere principle, or
on mere practice. Here we must take par∣ticular
care, not to <HI>turn to the right hand,
nor to the left;</HI> but to <HI>hold faith and a good
conscience</HI> united, as the Scripture, with great
<PB N="355" REF="368"/>
propriety, exhorts us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Timothy, i. 19.</NOTE> The error of rest∣ing
wholly on faith, or wholly on works,
is one of those seductions, which most ea∣sily
mislead men; under the semblance of
piety on the one hand, and of virtue on
the other. This is not an error peculiar to
our times. It has obtained in every age of
the Christian church. It has run through
all the different modes of false religion. It
forms the chief distinction of all the va∣rious
sects which have divided, and which
still continue to divide the church; accord∣ing
as they have leaned most to the side of
belief, or to the side of morality.</P>
<P>Did we listen candidly to the voice of Scrip∣ture,
it would guard us against either extreme.
The Apostle Paul every where testifies, that
by no works of our own we can be justi∣fied;
and that <HI>without faith it is impossible
to please God.</HI> The Apostle James as clear∣ly
shows, that faith, if it be unproductive
of good works, justifies no man. Between
those sentiments, there is no opposition.
<PB N="356" REF="369"/>
Faith without works, is nugatory and in∣significant.
It is a foundation, without any
superstructure raised upon it. It is a foun∣tain
which sends forth no stream; a tree
which neither bears fruit, nor affords shade.
Good works, again, without good princi∣ples,
are a fair, but airy structure; without
firmness or stability. They resemble the
house built on the sand; the reed which
shakes with every wind. You must join
the two in full union, if you would exhi∣bit
the character of a real Christian. He
who sets faith in opposition to morals, or
morals in opposition to faith, is equally an
enemy to the interests of religion. He
holds up to view an imperfect and disfi∣gured
form; in the room of what ought to
command respect from all beholders. By
leaning to one extreme, he is in danger of
falling into vice; by the other, of running
into impiety.</P>
<P>WHATEVER the belief of men be, they
generally pride themselves, in the possession
of some good moral qualities. The sense
<PB N="357" REF="370"/>
of duty is deeply rooted in the human
heart. Without some pretence to virtue,
there is no self-esteem; and no man wishes
to appear in his own view, as entirely
worthless. But as there is a constant strife
between the lower and higher parts of our
nature, between inclination and principle,
this produces much contradiction and in∣consistency
in conduct. Hence arise most
of the extremes, into which men run in
their moral behaviour; resting their whole
worth on that good quality, to which, by
constitution or temper, they are most in∣clined.</P>
<P>ONE of the first and most common of
those extremes, is that of placing all virtue,
either in justice, on the one hand; or in
generosity, on the other. The opposition
between these, is most discernible among
two different classes of men in society.
They who have earned their fortune by a
laborious and industrious life, are naturally
tenacious of what they have painfully ac∣quired.
To justice, they consider them∣selves
<PB N="358" REF="371"/>
as obliged; but to go beyond it in
acts of kindness, they consider as super∣fluous
and extravagant. They will not
take any advantage of others, which con∣science
tells them is iniquitous; but nei∣ther
will they make any allowance for their
necessities and wants. They contend, with
rigorous exactness, for what is due to them∣selves.
They are satisfied, if no man suf∣fer
unjustly by them. That no one is be∣nefited
by them, gives them little concern.
—Another set of men place their whole
merit in generosity and mercy; while to
justice and integrity they pay small regard.
These are persons generally of higher rank,
and of easy fortune. To them, justice ap∣pears
a sort of vulgar virtue, requisite chief∣ly
in the petty transactions, which those of
inferior station carry on with one another.
But humanity and liberality, they consider
as more refined virtues, which dignify their
character, and cover all their failings. They
can relent at representations of distress; can
bestow with ostentatious generosity; can
even occasionally share their wealth with a
<PB N="359" REF="372"/>
companion of whom they are fond; while,
at the same time, they with-hold from
others what is due to them; are negligent
of their family and their relations; and to
the just demands of their creditors give no
attention.</P>
<P>Both these classes of men run to a faulty
extreme. They divide moral virtue be∣tween
them. Each takes that part of it
only, which suits his temper. Without ju∣stice,
there is no virtue. But without hu∣manity
and mercy, no virtuous character
is complete. The one man leans to the ex∣treme
of parsimony. The other, to that of
profusion. The temper of the one is un∣feeling.
The sensibility of the other is
thoughtless. The one you may in some
degree respect; but you cannot love. The
other may be loved; but cannot be re∣spected:
and it is difficult to say, which
character is most defective.—We must un∣doubtedly
begin with being just, before we
attempt to be generous. At the same time,
he who goes no farther than bare justice,
stops at the beginning of virtue. We are
<PB N="360" REF="373"/>
commanded to <HI>do justly;</HI> but, to <HI>love mercy.</HI>
The one virtue, regulates our actions. The
other, improves our heart and affections.
Each is equally necessary to the happiness
of the world. Justice is the pillar, that
upholds the whole fabric of human society.
Mercy is the genial ray, which chears and
warms the habitations of men. The per∣fection
of our social character consists, in
properly tempering the two with one an∣other;
in holding that middle course,
which admits of our being just, without
being rigid; and allows us to be generous,
without being unjust.</P>
<P>WE must next guard against either too
great severity, or too great facility of man∣ners.
These are extremes, of which we
every day behold instances in the world.
He who leans to the side of severity, is
harsh in his censures, and narrow in his
opinions. He cannot condescend to others
in things indifferent. He has no allowance
to make for human frailty; or for the dif∣ference
of age, rank, or temper, among
<PB N="361" REF="374"/>
mankind. With him, all gaiety is sinful
levity; and every amusement is a crime.
To this extreme, the admonition of Solo∣mon
may be understood to belong; <HI>Be not
righteous over much; neither make thyself over
wife. Why shouldst thou destroy thyself</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vii. 16.</NOTE>?
When this severity of manners is hypocri∣tical,
and assumed as a cloak to secret in∣dulgence,
it is one of the worst prostitu∣tions
of religion. But I now consider it,
not as the effect of design, but of natural
austerity of temper, and of contracted ma∣xims
of conduct. Its influence upon the
person himself, is to render him gloomy
and four; upon others, to alienate them
both from his society, and his counsels;
upon religion, to set it forth as a morose
and forbidding principle.—The opposite
extreme to this is, perhaps, still more dan∣gerous;
that of too great facility, and ac∣commodation
to the ways of others. The
man of this character, partly from indolent
weakness, and partly from softness of tem∣per,
<PB N="362" REF="375"/>
is disposed to a tame and universal as∣sent.
Averse either to contradict or to
blame, he goes along with the manners that
prevail. He views every character with in∣dulgent
eye; and with good dispositions in
his breast, and a natural reluctance to pro∣fligacy
and vice, he is enticed to the com∣mission
of evils which he condemns, mere∣ly
through want of fortitude to oppose
others.</P>
<P>Nothing, it must be confessed in moral
conduct, is more difficult, than to avoid
turning here, either <HI>to the right hand or to
the left.</HI> One of the greatest trials both of
wisdom and virtue is, to preserve a just
medium, between that harshness of auste∣rity,
which disgusts and alienates mankind,
and that weakness of good-nature, which
opens the door to sinful excess. The one
separates us too much from the world. The
other connects us too closely with it; and
seduces us to <HI>follow the multitude in doing
evil.</HI> One who is of the former character,
studies too little to be agreeable, in order to
render himself useful. He who is of the
<PB N="363" REF="376"/>
latter, by studying too much to be agree∣able,
forfeits his innocence. If the one
hurt religion, by cloathing it in the garb
of unnecessary strictness; the other, by un∣warrantable
compliance, strengthens the
power of corruption in the world. The
one borders on the character of the Pha∣risee;
the other, on that of the Sadducee.
True religion enjoins us to stand at an
equal distance from both; and to pursue
the difficult, but honourable aim, of uni∣ting
good nature with fixed religious principle;
affable manners, with untainted vir∣tue.</P>
<P>FARTHER; we run to one extreme, when
we contemn altogether the opinions of man∣kind;
to another, when we court their
praise too eagerly. The former discovers
a high degree of pride and self-conceit.
The latter betrays servility of spirit. We
are formed by nature and Providence, to be
connected with one another. No man can
stand entirely alone, and independent of
his fellow-creatures. A reasonable re∣gard,
<PB N="364" REF="377"/>
therefore, for their esteem and good
opinion, is a commendable principle. It
flows from humanity; and coincides with,
the desire of being mutually useful. But,
if that regard be carried too far, it becomes
the source of much corruption. For in the
present state of mankind, the praise of the
world often interferes with our acting that
steady and conscientious part, which gains
the approbation of God. Hence arises the
difficulty of drawing a proper line, between
the allowable regard for reputation, and
the excessive desire of praise. On the one
side, and on the other, dangers meet us; and
either extreme will be pernicious to virtue.</P>
<P>He who extinguishes all regard to the
sentiments of mankind, suppresses one in∣centive
to honourable deeds; nay, he re∣moves
one of the strongest checks on vice.
For, where there is no desire of praise,
there will be also no sense of reproach and
shame; and when this sense is destroyed,
the way is paved to open profligacy. On
the other hand, he who is actuated solely
by the love of human praise, incroaches on
<PB N="365" REF="378"/>
the higher respect which he owes to con∣science,
and to God. Hence, virtue is
often counterfeited; and many a splen∣did
appearance has been exhibited to the
world, which had no basis in real prin∣ciple,
or inward affection. Hence, reli∣gious
truths have been disguised, or un∣fairly
represented, in order to be suited
to popular taste. Hence the Scribes and
Pharisees rejected our blessed Lord, <HI>because
they loved the praise of men more than the
praise of God.</HI>—Turn, therefore, neither to
<HI>the right hand, nor to the left.</HI> Affect not to
despise what the world thinks of your con∣duct
and character; and yet, let not the
sentiments of the world entirely rule you.
Let a desire of esteem be one motive of
your conduct; but let it hold a subordi∣nate
place. Measure the regard that is due
to the opinions of men, by the degree in
which these coincide with the law of God.</P>
<P>ALLOW me next to suggest, the danger
of running to the extreme of anxiety about
worldly interests on the one hand, and of
<PB N="366" REF="379"/>
negligence on the other. It is hard to say
which of these extremes is fraught with
most vice, and most misery. Industry and
diligence are unquestionable duties, strict∣ly
enforced on all Christians; and he who
fails in making suitable provision for his
household and family, is pronounced to be
<HI>worse than an infidel.</HI> But there are bounds,
within which our concern for worldly suc∣cess
must be confined. For anxiety is the
certain poison of human life. It debases
the mind; and sharpens all the passions.
It involves men in perpetual distractions,
and tormenting cares; and leads them aside
from what ought to be the great scope of
human action. Anxiety is, in general, the
effect of a covetous temper. Negligence is
commonly, the offspring of licentiousness,
and always, the parent of universal disor∣der.
By anxiety, you render yourselves
miserable. By negligence, you too often
occasion the ruin of others. The anxious
man is the votary of riches; the negligent
man, the votary of pleasure. Each offers
his mistaken worship, at the shrine of a
<PB N="367" REF="380"/>
false deity; and each shall reap only such
rewards as an idol can bestow; the one sa∣crificing
the enjoyment and improvement
of the present, to vain cares about futuri∣ty;
the other so totally taken up in enjoying
the present, as to store the future with cer∣tain
miseries.—True virtue holds a tem∣perate
course between these extremes; nei∣ther
careless of to-morrow, nor taking too
much thought for it; diligent, but not
anxious; prudent, but not covetous; at∣tentive
to provide comfortable accommo∣dation
on earth, but chiefly concerned to
<HI>lay up treasures in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only warn you farther against the
extreme, of engaging in a course of life too
busy and hurried, or of devoting your∣selves
to one too retired and unemployed.
We are formed for a mixture of action,
and retreat. Our connections with society,
and the performance of the duties which we
owe to one another, necessarily engage us
in active life. What we owe to ourselves,
requires occasional retirement. For he who
<PB N="368" REF="381"/>
lives always in the bustle of the world can∣not,
it is to be feared, always preserve his
virtue pure. Sentiments of piety will be
deprived of that nourishment and support,
which they would derive from meditation
and devotion. His temper will be often
ruffled and disturbed. His passions will be
kept too much on the stretch. From the
contagious manners which every where a∣bound,
he will not be able to avoid con∣tracting
some dangerous infection.—On
the other hand, he who flies to total retreat,
in order either to enjoy ease, or to escape
from the temptations of the world, will of∣ten
find disquiet meeting him in solitude,
and the worst temptations arising from
within himself. Unoccupied by active and
honourable pursuits, unable to devote his
whole time to improving thoughts, many
an evil passion will start up, and occupy the
vacant hour. Sullenness and gloom will be
in danger of overwhelming him. Peevish
displeasure, and suspicions of mankind, are
apt to persecute those who withdraw them∣selves
altogether from the haunts of men.
<PB N="369" REF="382"/>
—Steer therefore a middle course, be∣tween
a life oppressed with business on the
one hand; and burdened, for the burden
is no less, with idleness on the other. Pro∣vide
for yourselves matter of fair and ho∣nest
pursuit, to afford a proper object to
the active powers of the mind. Temper
business with serious meditation; and en∣liven
retreat by returns of action and in∣dustry.</P>
<P>THUS I have pointed out some of those
extremes into which men are apt to run,
by forsaking the line which religion and
wisdom have drawn. Many more, I am
sensible, might be suggested; for the field
is wide, and hardly is there any appearance
of piety, virtue, or good conduct, but what
the folly of men is apt to push into undue
excess, on one or other side. What I have
mentioned, will be sufficient to show the
necessity of prudent circumspection, in or∣der
to escape the dangers which beset us in
this state of trial. Let us study to attain
a regular, uniform, consistent character;
<PB N="370" REF="383"/>
where nothing that is excessive or dispro∣portioned
shall come forward to view;
which shall not plume itself with a fair
show on one side only, while in other quar∣ters
it remains unadorned, and blemished;
but, where the different parts of worth and
goodness shall appear united, and each shall
exert its proper influence on conduct.
Thus, <HI>turning neither to the right hand nor to
the left,</HI> we shall, as far as our frailty per∣mits,
approach to the perfection of the hu∣man
character; and shall have reason <HI>not
to be ashamed when we have</HI> equal <HI>respect to
all God's commandments.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 Peter, iii. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>—There shall come in the last days Scoffers.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the Christian religion is adverse to the
inclinations and passions of the corrupt∣ed
part of mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVIII.</NOTE> it has been its fate, in eve∣ry
age, to encounter the opposition of various
foes. Sometimes, it has undergone the storms
of violence and persecution. Sometimes, it
has been attacked by the arms of false
reasoning, and sophistry. When these have
failed of success, it has at other times been
exposed to the scoffs of the petulant. Men
of light and frivolous minds, who had no
comprehension of thought for discerning
<PB N="372" REF="385"/>
what is great, and no solidity of judge∣ment
for deciding on what is true, have
taken upon them to treat religion with con∣tempt,
as if it were of no consequence to
the world. They have affected to represent
the whole of that venerable fabric, which
has so long commanded the respect of man∣kind;
which, for ages, the learned have
supported, and the wise have admired, as
having no better foundation than the
gloomy imagination of fanatics and visio∣naries.
Of this character were those <HI>scof∣fers,</HI>
predicted by the Apostle to arise <HI>in the
last days;</HI> a prediction which we have seen
too often fulfilled. As the false colours
which such men throw on religion, are apt
to impose on the weak and unwary, let us
now examine, whether religion affords any
just grounds for the contempt or ridicule
of the scoffer. They must be either the
doctrines, or the precepts of religion, which
he endeavours to hold forth to contempt.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of the Christian religion
are rational and pure. All that it has re∣vealed
<PB N="373" REF="386"/>
concerning the perfections of God,
his moral government and laws, the desti∣nation
of man, and the rewards and pu∣nishments
of a future state, is perfectly con∣sonant
to the most enlightened reason. In
some articles which transcend the limits of
our present faculties, as in what relates to
the essence of the Godhead, the fallen state
of mankind, and their redemption by Jesus
Christ, its doctrines may appear mysterious
and dark. Against these, the scoffer has of∣ten
directed his attacks; as if whatever could
not be explained by us, ought upon that
account to be exploded as absurd.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to enter, at present, on any
particular defence of these doctrines, as there
is one observation which, if duly weighed,
is sufficient to silence the cavils of the scof∣fer.
Is he not compelled to admit, that the
whole system of nature around him is full
of mystery? What reason, then, had he to
suppose, that the doctrines of revelation,
proceeding from the same author, were to
contain no mysterious obscurity? All that
is requisite for the conduct of life, both in
<PB N="374" REF="387"/>
nature and in religion, divine wisdom has
rendered obvious to all. As nature has af∣forded
us sufficient information concerning
what is necessary for our food, our accom∣modation,
and our safety; so religion has
plainly instructed us in our duty towards
God, and our neighbour. But as soon as
we attempt to rise towards objects that lie
beyond our immediate sphere of action,
our curiosity is checked; and darkness meets
us on every side. What the essence is of
those material bodies which we see and
handle; how a seed grows up into a tree;
how man is formed in the womb; or how
the mind acts upon the body, after it is
formed; are mysteries of which we can give
no more account, than of the most obscure
and difficult parts of revelation. We are
obliged to admit the existence of the fact,
though the explanation of it exceeds our fa∣culties.</P>
<P>After the same manner, in natural reli∣gion,
questions arise concerning the crea∣tion
of the world from nothing, the origin
of evil under the government of a perfect
<PB N="375" REF="388"/>
Being, and the consistency of human liber∣ty
with divine prescience, which are of as
intricate nature, and of as difficult solution,
as any questions in Christian theology. We
may plainly see, that we are not admitted
into the secrets of Providence, any more
than into the mysteries of the Godhead. In
all his ways, the Almighty is a <HI>God that
hideth himself. He maketh darkness his pavi∣lion.
He holdeth back the face of his throne;
and spreadeth a thick cloud upon it.</HI>—In∣stead
of its being any objection to revela∣tion,
that some of its doctrines are myste∣rious,
it would be much more strange and
unaccountable, if no such doctrines were
found in it. Had every thing in the Chri∣stian
system been perfectly level to our ca∣pacities,
this might rather have given ground
to a suspicion, of its not proceeding from
God; since it would have been then so un∣like
to what we find, both in the system
of the universe, and in the system of natu∣ral
religion. Whereas, according as mat∣ters
now stand, the gospel has the same fea∣tures,
the same general character, with the
<PB N="376" REF="389"/>
other two, which are acknowledged to be of
divine origin; plain and comprehensible, in
what relates to practice; dark and myste∣rious,
in what relates to speculation and be∣lief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this argument fully pursued, and placed in a strong light, by the masterly hand of Bishop Butler, in his <HI>Analogy of Natural and Revealed Religion.</HI></NOTE>.
The cavils of the scoffer, therefore,
on this head, are so far from having any
just foundation, that they only discover
his ignorance, and the narrowness of his
views.</P>
<P>LET us next proceed to what relates to
practice, or the preceptive part of religion.
—The duties which religion enjoins us to
perform towards God, are those which have
oftenest furnished matter to the scoffs of
the licentious. They attempt to represent
these as so idle and superfluous, that they
could owe their birth to nothing but en∣thusiasm.
—For, is not the Deity so far ex∣alted
above us, as to receive neither advan∣tage
nor pleasure, from our worship? What
are our prayers, or our praises, to that infinite
<PB N="377" REF="390"/>
mind, who, resting in the full enjoyment
of his own beatitude, beholds all his crea∣tures
passing before him, only as the insects
of a day? What but superstitious terrors,
could have dictated those forms of homage,
and those distinctions of sacred days, in
which vulgar minds delight, but which the
liberal and enlarged look upon with scorn?</P>
<P>Now, in return to such insults of the
scoffer, it might be sufficient to observe,
that the united sentiments of mankind, in
every age and nation, are against him.
Thoughtless as the bulk of men are, and
attached only to objects which they see a∣round
them; this principle has never been
extinguished in their breasts, that to the
great Parent of the human race, the uni∣versal,
though invisible, benefactor of the
world, not only internal reverence, but ex∣ternal
homage is due. Whether he need
that homage or not, is not the question. It
is what, on our part, we undoubtedly owe;
and the heart is, with reason, held to be
base, which stifles the emotions of grati∣tude
to a benefactor, how independent so∣ever
<PB N="378" REF="391"/>
ever he may be of any returns. True vir∣tue,
always prompts a public declaration of
the grateful sentiments which it feels; and
glories in expressing them. Accordingly,
over all the earth, crowds of worshippers
have assembled to adore, in various forms,
the Ruler of the world. In these adorations,
the philosopher, the savage, and the saint,
have, equally joined. None but the cold
and unfeeling can look up to that benefi∣cent
Being, who is at the head of the uni∣verse,
without some inclination to pray, or
to praise. In vain, therefore, would the
scoffer deride, what the loud voice of na∣ture
demands and justifies. He erects him∣self
against the general, and declared sense
of the human race.</P>
<P>But apart from this consideration, I must
call on him to attend to one of a still more
serious and awful nature. By his licentious
ridicule of the duties of piety, and of the
institutions of divine worship, he is weak∣ening
the power of conscience over men;
he it undermining the great pillars of so∣ciety;
he is giving a mortal blow to public
<PB N="379" REF="392"/>
order, and public happiness. All these rest
on nothing so much, as on the general be∣lief
of an all-seeing witness, and the gene∣ral
veneration of an Almighty Governor.
On this belief, and this veneration, is founded
the whole obligation of an oath; with∣out
which, government could not be admi∣nistered,
nor courts of justice act; contro∣versies
could not be determined, nor private
property be preserved safe. Our only se∣curity
against innumerable crimes, to
which the restraints of human laws cannot
reach, is the dread of an invisible avenger,
and of those future punishments which
he hath prepared for the guilty. Remove this
dread from the minds of men; and you
strengthen the hands of the wicked, and
endanger the safety of human society.</P>
<P>But how could impressions so necessary to
the public welfare be preserved, if there were
no religious assemblies, no sacred institu∣tions,
no days set apart for divine worship,
in order to be solemn remembrancers to
men of the existence, and the dominion of
God; and of the future account they have
<PB N="380" REF="393"/>
to give of their actions to him? To all ranks
of men, the sentiments which public reli∣gion
tends to awaken, are salutary and be∣neficial.
But with respect to the inferior
classes, it is well known, that the only prin∣ciples
which restrain them from evil, are
acquired in the religious assemblies which
they frequent. Destitute of the advantages
of regular education; ignorant, in great
measure, of public laws; unacquainted
with those refined ideas of honour and pro∣priety,
to which others of more knowledge
have been trained; were those sacred tem∣ples
deserted to which they now resort,
they would be in danger of degenerating
into a ferocious race, from whom lawless
violence was perpetually to be dreaded.</P>
<P>He, therefore, who treats sacred things
with any degree of levity and scorn, is ac∣ting
the part, perhaps without his seeing or
knowing it, of a public enemy to society.
He is precisely the <HI>madman</HI> described in the
book of Proverbs,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvi. 18.</NOTE> <HI>who casteth firebrands,
<PB N="381" REF="394"/>
arrows, and death; and saith, am I not in
sport?</HI> We shall hear him, at times, com∣plain
loudly of the undutifulness of chil∣dren,
of the dishonesty of servants, of the
tumults and insolence of the lower ranks;
while he himself is, in a great measure,
responsible for the disorders of which he
complains. By the example which he sets
of contempt for religion, he becomes ac∣cessory
to the manifold crimes, which that
contempt occasions among others. By his
scoffing at sacred institutions, he is encou∣raging
the rabble to uproar and violence;
he is emboldening the false witness to take
the name of God in vain; he is, in effect,
putting arms into the hands of the high∣wayman,
and letting loose the robber on
the streets by night.</P>
<P>We come next to consider that great
class of duties, which respect our conduct
towards our fellow-creatures. The absolute
necessity of these to general welfare is so
apparent, as to have secured them, in a
great degree, from the attacks of the scof∣fer
<PB N="382" REF="395"/>
He who should attempt to turn ju∣stice,
truth, or honesty, into ridicule, would
be avoided by every one. To those who
had any remains of principle, he would be
odious. To those who attended only to
their interest, he would appear a dangerous
man. But though the social virtues are
treated in general as respectable and sacred,
there are certain forms and degrees of them,
which have not been exempted from the
scorn of the unthinking. That extensive
generosity, and high public spirit, which
prompt a man to sacrifice his own interest,
in order to promote some great general
good; and that strict and scrupulous inte∣grity,
which will not allow one, on any
occasion, to depart from the truth; have
often been treated with contempt by those
who are called men of the world. They
who will not stoop to flatter the great; who
disdain to comply with prevailing manners,
when they judge them to be evil; who re∣fuse
to take the smallest advantage of others,
in order to procure the greatest benefit for
themselves; are represented as persons of
<PB N="383" REF="396"/>
romantic character, and visionary notions,
unacquainted with the world, and unfit
to live in it.</P>
<P>Such persons are so far from being liable
to any just ridicule, that they are intitled
to a degree of respect, which approaches to
veneration. For they are, in truth, the
great supporters and guardians of public
order. The authority of their character
overawes the giddy multitude. The weight
of their example retards the progress of cor∣ruption;
checks that relaxation of morals,
which is always too apt to gain ground in∣sensibly,
and to make incroachments on
every department of society. Accordingly,
it is this high generosity of spirit, this in∣flexible
virtue, this regard to principle, su∣perior
to all opinion, which has ever mark∣ed
the characters of those who have emi∣nently
distinguished themselves in public
life; who have patronised the cause of ju∣stice
against powerful oppressors; who, in
critical times, have supported the falling
rights and liberties of men; and have re∣flected
honour on their nation and country.
<PB N="384" REF="397"/>
Such persons may have been scoffed at by
some among whom they lived; but poste∣rity
has done them ample justice; and they
are the persons, whose names are recorded
to future ages, and who are thought and
spoken of with admiration.</P>
<P>The mere temporizer, the man of accom∣modating
principles, and inferior virtue,
may support a plausible character for a
while among his friends and followers;
but as soon as the hollowness of his prin∣ciples
is detected, he sinks into contempt.
They who are prone to deride men of in∣flexible
integrity, only betray the littleness
of their minds. They show that they un∣derstand
not the sublime of virtue; that
they have no discernment of the true ex∣cellence
of man. By affecting to throw any discouragement
on purity and strict∣ness
of morals, they not only expose them∣selves
to just contempt, but propagate sen∣timents
very dangerous to society. For, if
we loosen the regard due to virtue in any
of its parts, we begin to sap the whole of
it. No man, as it has been often said, be∣comes
<PB N="385" REF="398"/>
entirely profligate at once. He de∣viates,
step by step, from conscience. If
the loose casuistry of the scoffer were to
prevail, open dishonesty, falsehood, and
treachery, would speedily grow out of those
complying principles, those relaxations of
virtue, which he would represent to be ne∣cessary
for every man who knows the world.</P>
<P>THE last class of virtues I am to men∣tion,
are those which are of a personal na∣ture,
and which respect the government to
be exercised over our pleasures and passions.
Here, the scoffer has always considered
himself as having an ample field. Often,
and often, have such virtues as sobriety,
temperance, modesty, and chastity, been
made the subject of ridicule, as monkish
habits, which exclude men from the com∣pany
of the fashionable and the gay; ha∣bits,
which are the effect of low education,
or of mean spirits, or of mere feebleness of
constitution; while scoffers, <HI>walking,</HI> as it is
too truly said of them by the Apostle, <HI>after
<PB N="386" REF="399"/>
their lusts,</HI> boast of their own manners as
liberal and free, as manly and spirited.
They fancy themselves raised thereby much
above the crowd; and hold all those in con∣tempt,
who confine themselves within the
vulgar bounds of regular and orderly life.</P>
<P>Infatuated men! who see not that the
virtues of which they make sport, not
only derive their authority from the laws of
God, but are moreover essentially requisite
both to public, and to private happiness.
By the indulgence of their licentious plea∣sures
for a while, as long as youth and vi∣gour
remain, a few passing gratifications
may be obtained. But what are the conse∣quences?
Suppose any individual to per∣severe
unrestrained in this course, it is cer∣tainly
to be followed, by disrepute in his
character, and disorder in his affairs; by a
wasted and broken constitution; and a
speedy and miserable old age. Suppose a
society to be wholly formed of such persons
as the scoffers applaud; suppose it to be
filled with none but those whom they call
the sons of pleasure; that is, with the in∣temperate,
<PB N="387" REF="400"/>
the riotous, and dissolute, among
whom all regard to sobriety, decency, and
private virtue, was abolished; what an odious
scene would such a society exhibit? How
unlike any civilised or well-ordered state,
in which mankind have chosen to dwell?
What turbulence and uproar, what contests
and quarrels, would perpetually reign in
it? What man of common understanding
would not rather chuse to dwell in a de∣sert,
than to be associated for life with such
companions? Shall, then, the scoffer pre∣sume
to make light of those virtues, with∣out
which there could be neither peace,
nor comfort, nor good order, among man∣kind?</P>
<P>Let him be desired to think, of his do∣mestic
situation and connections. Is he a
father, a husband, or a brother? Has he
any friend or relation, male or female, in
whose happiness he is interested?—Let
us put the question to him, whether he be
willing that intemperance, unchastity, or
dissipation, of any kind, should mark their
character? Would he recommend to them
<PB N="388" REF="401"/>
such excesses? Would he chuse, in their
presence, openly, and without disguise, to
scoff at the opposite virtues, as of no con∣sequences
to their welfare?—If even the
most licentious shudders at the thought;
if, in the midst of is loose pleasures, he
be desirous that his own family should re∣main
untainted; let this teach him the va∣lue
of those private virtues, which, in the
hours of dissipation, in the giddiness of his
mind, he is ready to contemn. Banish so∣briety,
temperance, and purity, and you
tear up the foundations of all public order,
and all domestic quiet. You render every
house a divided and miserable abode, re∣sounding
with terms of shame, and mutual
reproaches of infamy. You leave nothing
respectable in the human character. you
change the man into a brute.</P>
<P>THE conclusion from all the reasonings
which we have now pursued, is, that reli∣gion
and virtue, in all their forms, either
of doctrine or of precept; of piety towards
God, integrity towards men, or regularity
<PB N="389" REF="402"/>
in private conduct; are so far from afford∣ing
any grounds of ridicule to the petulant,
that they are intitled to our highest vene∣ration;
they are names, which should ne∣ver
be mentioned, but with the utmost ho∣nour.
It is said in Scripture, <HI>Fools make a
mock at sin.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 9.</NOTE> They had better make a
mock at pestilence, at war, of famine.
With one, who should chuse these public
calamities for the subject of his sport, you
would not be inclined to associate. You
would fly from him, as worse than a fool;
as a man of distempered mind, from whom
you might be in hazard of receiving a sud∣den
blow. Yet certain it is, that, to the
great society of mankind, sin is a greater
calamity, than either pestilence, of famine,
or war. These operate, only as occasional
causes of misery. But the sins and vices
of men, are perpetual scourges of the world.
Impiety and injustice, fraud and falsehood,
imtemperance and profligacy, are daily pro∣ducing
mischief and disorder; bringing
<PB N="390" REF="403"/>
ruin on individuals; tearing families and
communities in pieces; giving rise to a
thousand tragical scenes on this unhappy
theatre. In proportion as manners are vi∣cious,
mankind are unhappy. The per∣fection
of virtue which reigns in the world
above, is the chief source of the perfect
blessedness which prevails there.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we observe any tenden∣cy
to treat religion or morals with disre∣spect
and levity, let us hold it to be a sure
indication of a perverted understanding, or
a depraved heart. <HI>In the seat of the scorner</HI>
let us never sit. Let us account that wit
contaminated, which attempts to sport itself
on sacred subjects. When the scoffer arises,
let us maintain the honour of our God,
and our Redeemer; and resolutely adhere
to the cause of virtue and goodness. <HI>The
lips of the wise utter knowledge; but the mouth
of the foolish is near to destruction. Him that
honoureth God, God will honour. The fear of
the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and he
that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his
own soul.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SUCH in the commencement of the his∣tory
of mankind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIX.</NOTE> an aera, to which we
must ever look back with solemn awe and
veneration. Before the sun and the moon
had begun their course; before the sound
of the human voice was heard, or the
name of man was known; <HI>in the beginning
God created the heaven, and the earth.</HI>—
To a beginning of the world, we are led
back by every thing that now exists; by
all history, all records, all monuments of
<PB N="392" REF="405"/>
antiquity. In tracing the transactions of
past ages, we arrive at a period, which clear∣ly
indicates the infancy of the human race.
We behold the world peopled by degrees.
We ascend to the origin of all those useful
and necessary arts, without the knowledge
of which, mankind could hardly subsist.
We discern society and civilization arising
from rude beginnings, in every corner of
the earth; and gradually advancing to the
state in which we now find them: All
which afford plain evidence, that there was
a period, when mankind began to inhabit
and cultivate the earth. What is every re∣markable,
the most authentic chronology
and history of most nations, coincides with
the account of Scripture; and makes the
period during which the world has been
inhabited by the race of men, not to ex∣tend
beyond six thousand years.</P>
<P>To the ancient philosophers, creation
from nothing appeared an unintelligible
idea. They maintained the eternal exist∣ence
of matter, which they supposed to be
modeled by the sovereign mind of the uni∣verse,
<PB N="393" REF="406"/>
into the form which the earth now
exhibits. But there is nothing in this opi∣nion
which gives it any title to be opposed
to the authority of revelation. The doc∣trine
of two self-existent, independent prin∣ciples,
God and matter, the one active, the
other passive, is a hypothesis which presents
difficulties to human reason, at least as
great as the creation of matter from no∣thing.
Adhering then to the testimony of
Scripture, we believe, that <HI>in the beginning
God created,</HI> or from non-existence brought
into being, <HI>the heaven and the earth.</HI></P>
<P>But though there was a period when this
globe, with all that we see upon it, did not
exist, we have no reason to think, that the
wisdom and power of the Almighty were
then without exercise of employment.
Boundless is the extent of his dominion.
Other globes and worlds, enlightened by
other suns, may then have occupied, as
they still appear to occupy, the immense
regions of space. Numberless orders of be∣ings,
to us unknown, people the wide ex∣tent
of the universe; and afford an endless
<PB N="394" REF="407"/>
variety of objects to the ruling care of the
great Father of all. At length, in the
course and progress of his government,
there arrived a period, when this earth was
to be called into existence. When the sig∣nal
moment, predestined from all eternity,
was come, the Deity arose in his might;
and with a world created the world.—
What an illustrious moment was that,
when, from non-existence, there sprang at
once into being, this mighty globe, on
which so many millions of creatures now
dwell!—No preparatory measures were re∣quired.
No long circuit of means was em∣ployed.
<HI>He spake; and it was done: He
commanded; and it stood fast.</HI> The earth
was at first, <HI>without form, and void; and
darkness was on the face of the deep.</HI> The Al∣mighty
surveyed the dark abyss; and fix∣ed
bounds to the several divisions of na∣ture.
He said, <HI>Let there be light; and there
was light.</HI> Then appeared the sea, and the
dry land. The mountains rose; and the
rivers flowed. The sun and moon began
their course in the skies. Herbs and plants
<PB N="395" REF="408"/>
cloathed the ground. The air, the earth,
and the waters, were stored with their re∣spective
inhabitants. At last, man was
made after the image of God. He appear∣ed,
walking with countenance erect; and
received his Creator's benediction, as the
Lord of this new world. The Almighty
beheld his work when it was finished; and
pronounced it good. Superior beings saw
with wonder this new accession to existence.
<HI>The morning stars sang together; and all the
sons of God shouted for joy.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxviii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, on this great work of creation, let
us not merely gaze with astonishment. Let
us consider how it should affect our con∣duct,
by presenting the divine perfections
in a light which is at once edifying, and
comforting, to man. It displays the Crea∣tor
as supreme in power, in wisdom, and
in goodness.</P>
<P>I. An supreme in power. When we con∣sider
with how much labour and difficulty
<PB N="396" REF="409"/>
human power performs its inconsiderable
works; what time it costs to rear them;
and how easily, when reared, they are de∣stroyed;
the very idea of creating power
overwhelms the mind with awe. Let us
look around, and survey this stupendous
edifice, which we have been admitted to
inhabit. Let us think of the extent of the
different climates and regions of the earth;
of the magnitude of the mountains, and of
the expanse of the ocean. Let us conceive
that immense globe which contains them,
launched at once from the hand of the Al∣mighty;
made to revolve incessantly on its
axis, that it might produce the vicissitudes
of day and night; thrown forth, at the
same time, to run its annual course in perpetual
circuit through the heavens; after
such a meditation, where is the greatness,
where is the pride of man? Into what total
annihilation do we sink, before an omnipo∣tent
Being? Who is not disposed to exclaim,
<HI>Lord, what is man, that thou are mindful of
him; or the son of man, that thou shouldst visit
him? When compared with thee, all men are
<PB N="397" REF="410"/>
vanity; their works are nothing.</HI>—Reve∣rence,
and humble adoration, ought spon∣taneously
to arise. He who feels no pro∣pensity
to worship and adore, is dead to all
sense of grandeur and majesty; has extin∣guished
one of the most natural feelings of
the human heart. <HI>Know the Lord, that he
is God, we are all his people; the workman∣ship
of his hands. Let us worship and how
down. Let us kneel before the Lord our
Maker.</HI></P>
<P>Of all titles to legislation and rule, none
is so evident and direct as that of a Crea∣tor.
The conviction is felt in every breast,
that he who gave us being, hath an abso∣lute
right to regulate our conduct. This
gives a sanction to the precepts of God,
which the most hardened dare not contro∣vert.
When it is a Creator and a Father
that speaks, who would not listen and
obey? Are justice and humanity his de∣clared
laws; and shall we, whom but ye∣sterday
he called from the dust, and whom
to-morrow he can reduce into dust again,
presume, in contempt of him, to be unjust
<PB N="398" REF="411"/>
or inhuman? Are there any little interests
of our own which we dare to erect, in op∣position
to the pleasure of him who made
us? <HI>Fear ye not me, saith the Lord; will ye
not tremble at my presence, who have placed
the sand for the bound of the sea, by a per∣petual
decree, that it cannot pass it; who
stretch forth my hand over the earth, and none
hindereth?</HI></P>
<P>At the same time, the power of a Crea∣tor
is encouraging, as well as awful. While
it enforces duty, it inspires confidence un∣der
affliction. It brings to view a relation,
which imports tenderness and comfort; for
it suggests the compassion of a father. In
the time of trouble, mankind are led by
natural impulse, to fly for aid to Him, who
knows the weakness of the frame which he
has made; who <HI>remembers we are dust;</HI> and
sees the dangers with which we are envi∣roned.
“Iam thine; for thou hast made
me: Forsake not the work of thine own
hands,” is one of the most natural ejacula∣tions
of the distressed mind.—How bles∣sed
are the virtuous, who can rest under the
<PB N="399" REF="412"/>
protection of that powerful arm, which
made the earth and the heaven? The om∣nipotence
which renders God so awful, is
to them a source of joy. In the whole com∣pass
of nature, nothing is formidable to
them, who firmly repose their trust in the
Creator. To them, every noxious power
can be rendered harmless; every threaten∣ed
evil, if not averted, can be transformed
into good. In the Author of nature, they
find not only the author of their being;
but their protector and defender, the lifter
up of their heads. <HI>Happy</HI> is he that hath the
God of Jacob for his help; whose hope is in
the Lord his God; which made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that therein is; which
keepeth truth for ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xlvi. 5. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. THE work of creation is the display of
supreme wisdom. It carries no character
more conspicuous than this. If, from the
structure and mechanism of some of the most
complicated works of human art, we are led
<PB N="400" REF="413"/>
to high admiration of the wisdom of the
contriver, what astonishment may fill our
minds, when we think of the structure of
the universe! It is not only the stupendous
building itself, which excites admiration;
but the exquisite skill, with which the end∣less
variety of its parts are adapted to their
respective purposes. Insomuch, that the
study of nature, which, for ages, has em∣ployed
the lives of so many learned men,
and which is still so far from being ex∣hausted,
is no other than the study of di∣vine
wisdom displayed in the creation. The
farther our researches are carried, more
striking proofs of it every where meet us.
The provision made for the constant regu∣larity
of the universe, in the disposition of
the heavenly bodies, so that in the course
of several thousand years, nature should
ever exhibit the same useful and grateful
variety, in the returns of light and dark∣ness,
of summer and winter; and ever fur∣nish
food and habitation to all the animals
that people the earth; must be a lasting
theme of wonder to every reflecting mind.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="414"/>
But they are not only the heavens that
<HI>declare the glory of God, and the firmament
that sheweth forth his handy work.</HI> In the most
inconsiderable, as well as in the most il∣lustrious
works of the Creator, consummate
art and design appear. There is not a crea∣ture
that moves, nor a vegetable that grows,
but, when minutely examined, furnishies
materials of the highest admiration. The
same wisdom that placed the sun in the
centre of the system, and arranged the se∣veral
planets around him in their order,
has no less shown itself, in the provision
made for the food and dwelling of every
bird that roams the air, and every beast
that wanders in the desert; equally great,
in the smallest, and in the most magnifi∣cent
objects; in the star, and in the infect;
in the elephant, and in the fly; in the beam
that shines from heaven, and in the grass
that cloaths the ground. Nothing is over∣looked.
Nothing is carelessly performed.
Every thing that exists, is adapted with per∣fect
symmetry to the end for which it was
designed. All this infinite variety of par∣ticulars
<PB N="402" REF="415"/>
must have been present to the mind
of the Creator; all beheld with one glance
of his eye; all fixed and arranged, from
the beginning in his great design, when
he formed the heavens and the earth. Just∣ly
may we exclaim with the Psalmist, <HI>How
excellent, O Lord, is thy name in all the earth!
How manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast
thou made them all. No man can find out the
work that God maketh, from the beginning
to the end, Such knowledge is too wonderful
for us. It is high; we cannot attain unto it.</HI></P>
<P>This wisdom displayed by the Almighty
in the creation, was not intended merely to
gratify curiosity, and to raise wonder. It
ought to beget profound submission, and
pious trust, in every heart. It is not un∣common
for many who speak with rapture
of creating wisdom, to be guilty, at the same
time, of arraigning the conduct of Provi∣dence.
In the structure of the universe,
they confess that all is goodly and beauti∣ful.
But in the government of human af∣fairs,
they can see nothing but disorder and
confusion.—Have they forgotten, that
<PB N="403" REF="416"/>
both the one, and the other, proceed from
the same author? Have they forgotten, that
he who balanced all the heavenly bodies,
and adjusted the proportions and limits of
nature, is the same who hath allotted them
their condition in the world, who distri∣butes
the measures of their prosperity and
adversity, and fixes <HI>the bounds of their habi∣tation?</HI>
If their lot appear to them ill sorted,
and their condition hard and unequal, let
them only put the question to their own
minds, Whether it be most probable, that
the great and wise Creator hath erred in
his distribution of human things, or that
they have erred, in the judgement which
they form concerning the lot assigned to
them? Can they believe, that the divine
Artist, after he had contrived and finished
this earth, the habitation of men, with
such admirable wisdom, would then throw
it out of his hands as a neglected work;
would suffer the affairs of its inhabitants to
proceed by chance; and would behold them
without concern, running into misrule and
disorder? Where were then that consisten∣cy
<PB N="404" REF="417"/>
of conduct, which we discover in all the
works of nature, and which we cannot but
ascribe to a perfect Being?—My brother!
when thy plans are disappointed, and thy
heart is ready to despair; when virtue is
oppressed, and the wicked prosper around
thee; in those moments of disturbance, look
up to him who created the heaven and the
earth; and confide, that he who made light
to spring from primaeval darkness, will make
order at last to arise from the seeming con∣fusion
of the world.</P>
<P>Had any one beheld the earth in its state
of chaos; when the elements lay mixed and
confused; when the earth <HI>was without form
and void, and darkness was on the face of the
deep;</HI> would he have believed, that it was
presently to become so fair and well order∣ed
a globe as we now behold; illumined
with the splendor of the sun, and decorated
with all the beauty of nature? The same
powerful hand, which perfected the work
of creation, shall, in due time, disembroil the
plans of Providence. Of creation, we can
judge more clearly, because it stood forth
<PB N="405" REF="418"/>
at once; it was perfect from the beginning.
But the course of Providence is progressive.
Time is required for the progression to ad∣vance;
and before it is finished, we can
form no judgement, or at least a very imper∣fect
one, concerning it. We must wait un∣til
the great aera arrive, when the secrets of
the universe shall be unfolded; when the
divine designs shall be consummated; when
Providence shall be brought to the same
completion which creation has already at∣tained.
Then, we have every reason to be∣lieve,
that the wise Creator shall appear in
the end, to have been the wise and just ruler
of the world. Until that period come, let
us be contented and patient; let us submit
and adore. <HI>Although thou sayest thou shalt
not see him, yet judgement is before him; there∣fore,
trust thou in him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE> This exhortation
will receive more force, when we.</P>
<P>III. Consider creation as a display of supreme
goodness, no less than of wisdom and
<PB N="406" REF="419"/>
power. It is the communication of num∣berless
benefits to all who live, together
with existence. Justly is the earth said to
be <HI>full of the goodness of the Lord.</HI> Through∣out
the whole system of things, we behold
a manifest tendency to promote the benefit
either of the rational, or the animal crea∣tion.
In some parts of nature, this tenden∣cy
may be less obvious than in others. Ob∣jects,
which to us seem useless, or hurtful,
may sometimes occur; and strange it were,
if in so vast and complicated a system, dif∣ficulties
of this kind should not occasional∣ly
present themselves to beings, whose views
are so narrow and limited as ours. It is
well known, that in proportion as the
knowledge of nature has increased among
men, these difficulties have diminished. Sa∣tisfactory
accounts have been given of ma∣ny
perplexing appearances. Useful and
proper purposes have been found to be pro∣moted,
by objects which were, at first,
thought unprofitable or noxious.</P>
<P>Malignant must be the mind of that per∣son;
with a distorted eye he must have con∣templated
<PB N="407" REF="420"/>
creation, who can suspect, that
it is not the production of infinite benigni∣ty
and goodness. How many clear marks
of benevolent intention appear, every where
around us? What a profusion of beauty and
ornament is poured forth on the face of na∣ture?
What a magnificent spectacle pre∣sented
to the view of man? What supply
contrived for his wants? What a variety of
objects set before him, to gratify his senses,
to employ his understanding, to entertain
his imagination, to cheer and gladden his
heart? Indeed, the very existence of the
universe is a standing memorial of the
goodness of the Creator. For nothing ex∣cept
goodness could originally prompt crea∣tion.
The supreme Being, self-existent and
all-sufficient, had no wants which he could
seek to supply. No new accession of felici∣ty
or glory was to result to him, from crea∣tures
whom he made. It was goodness
communicating and pouring itself forth,
goodness delighting to impart happiness
in all its forms, which in the beginning
created the heaven and the earth. Hence,
<PB N="408" REF="421"/>
those innumerable orders of living creatures
with which the earth is peopled; from the
lowest class of sensitive being, to the high∣est
rank of reason and intelligence. Where∣ever
there is life, there is some degree of
happiness; there are enjoyments suited to
the different powers of feeling; and earth,
and air, and water, are, with magnificent
liberality, made to teem with life.</P>
<P>Let those striking displays of creating
goodness call forth, on our part, responsive
love, gratitude, and veneration. To this
great Father of all existence and life, to
Him who hath raised us up to behold the
light of day, and to enjoy all the comforts
which his world presents, let our hearts
send forth a perpetual hymn of praise.
Evening and morning let us celebrate Him,
who maketh the morning and the evening
to rejoice over our heads; who <HI>openeth his
hand, and satisfieth the desire of every living
thing.</HI> Let us rejoice, that we are brought
into a world, which is the production of
infinite goodness; over which a supreme
intelligence presides; and where nothing
<PB N="409" REF="422"/>
happens, that was not planned and arran∣ged
from the beginning, in his decree. Con∣vinced
that he hateth not the works which
he hath made, nor hath brought creatures
into existence, merely to suffer unnecessary
pain, let us, even in the midst of sorrow,
receive, with calm submission, whatever he
is pleased to send; thankful for what he
bestows; and satisfied, that, without good
reason, he takes nothing away.</P>
<P>SUCH, in general, are the effects which
meditation on the creation of the world
ought to produce. It presents such an asto∣nishing
conjunction of power, wisdom, and
goodness, as cannot be beheld without re∣ligious
veneration. Accordingly, among
all nations of the earth, it has given rise to
religious belief and worship. The most
ignorant and savage tribes, when they look∣ed
round on the earth and the heavens,
could not avoid ascribing their origin to
some invisible designing cause, and feeling
a propensity to adore. They are, indeed, the
awful appearances of the Creator's power,
<PB N="410" REF="423"/>
by which, chiefly, they have been impressed;
and which have introduced into their
worship so many rites of dark supers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion.
When the usual course of nature seemed to
be interrupted; when loud thunder rolled
above them in the clouds, or earthquakes
shook the ground, the multitude fell on
their knees, and, with trembling horror,
brought forth the bloody sacrifice to ap∣pease
the angry divinity. But it is not in
those tremendous appearances of power
merely, that a good and well-instructed
man beholds the Creator of the world. In
the constant and regular working of his
hands, in the silent operations of his wis∣dom
and goodness, ever going on through∣out
nature, he delights to contemplate and adore him.</P>
<P>This is one of the chief fruits to be de∣rived
from that more perfect knowledge of
the Creator, which is imparted to us by the
Christian revelation. Impressing our minds
with a just sense of all his attributes, as not
wise and great only, but as gracious and
merciful let it lead us to view every object
<PB N="411" REF="424"/>
of calm and undisturbed nature, with a per∣petual
reference, to its author. We shall
then behold all the scenes which the hea∣vens
and the earth present, with more refi∣ned
feelings, and sublimer emotions, than
they who regard them solely as objects of
curiosity, or amusement. Nature will ap∣pear
animated, and enlivened, by the pre∣sence
of its author. When the sun rises
or sets in the heavens; when spring paints
the earth, when summer shines in its glory,
when autumn pours forth its fruits, or
winter returns in its awful forms, we shall
view the Creator manifesting himself in his
works. We shall meet his presence in the
fields. We shall feel his influence in the
cheering beam. We shall hear his voice in
the wind. We shall behold ourselves every
where surrounded with the glory of that
universal spirit, who fills, pervades,
and upholds all. We shall live in the world as
in a great and august temple; where the
presence of the divinity, who inhabits it,
inspires devotion.</P>
<P>Magnificent as the fabric of the world
<PB N="412" REF="425"/>
is, it was not, however, intended for per∣petual
duration. It was erected as a tem∣porary
habitation for a race of beings, who,
after acting there a probationary part, were
to be removed into a higher state of exist∣ence.
As there was an hour fixed from all
eternity for its creation, so there is an hour
fixed for its dissolution; when the heavens
and the earth shall pass away, and their
place shall know them no more. The con∣sideration
of this great event, as the coun∣terpart
to the work of creation, shall be the
subject of the following Discourse.</P>

<Q>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief
in the night; in the which the heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, and the ele∣ments
shall melt with fervent heat; the
earth also, and the works that are therein,
shall be burnt up.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words present to us an awful
view of the final catastrophe of the
world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XX.</NOTE> Having treated, in the preceding
Discourse, of the commencement, let us
now contemplate the close, of all human
things. The dissolution of the material
system is an article of our faith, often allu∣ded
<PB N="414" REF="427"/>
to in the Old Testament, clearly pre∣dicted
in the New. It is an article of faith
so far from being incredible, that many
appearances in nature lead to the belief of
it. We see all terrestrial substances chan∣ging
their form. Nothing that consists of
matter, is formed for perpetual duration.
Every thing around us, is impaired and
consumed by time; waxes old by degrees,
and tends to decay. There is reason, there∣fore,
to believe, that a structure so complex
as the world must be liable to the same
law; and shall, at some period, undergo
the same fate. Through many changes, the
earth has already passed; many shocks it
has received, and still is often receiving. A
great portion of what is now dry land ap∣pears,
from various tokens, to have been
once covered with water. Continents bear
the marks of having been violently rent,
and torn asunder from one another. New
islands have risen from the bottom of the
ocean; thrown up by the force of subter∣raneous
fire. Formidable earthquakes have,
in divers quarters, shaken the globe; and
<PB N="415" REF="428"/>
at this hour terrify, with their alarms, ma∣ny
parts of it. Burning mountains have,
for ages, been discharging torrents of flame;
and from time to time renew their explo∣sions,
in various regions. All these circum∣stances
show, that in the bowels of the
earth, the instruments of its dissolution are
formed. To our view, who behold only
its surface, it may appear firm and unsha∣ken;
while its destruction is preparing in
secret. The ground on which we tread is
undermined. Combustible materials are
stored. The train is laid. When the mine
is to spring, none of us can foresee.</P>
<P>Accustomed to behold the course of na∣ture
proceeding in regular order, we in∣dulge,
meanwhile, our pleasures and pur∣suits
with full security; and such awful
scenes as the convulsion of the elements,
and the dissolution of the world, are fo∣reign
to our thoughts. Yet, as it is certain
that some generation of men must witness
this great catastrophe, it is fit and proper
that we should sometimes look forward to
it. Such prospects may not, indeed, be al∣luring
<PB N="416" REF="429"/>
to the bulk of men. But they carry
a grandeur and solemnity, which are con∣genial
to some of the most dignified feel∣ings
in our nature; and tend to produce
elevation of thought. Amidst the circle of
levities and follies, of little pleasures and
little cares, which fill up the ordinary round
of life, it is necessary that we be occasional∣ly
excited to attend to what is serious and
great. Such events as are now to be the
subject of our meditation, awake the slum∣bering
mind; check the licentiousness of
idle thought, and bring home our recollect∣tion
to what most concerns us, as men and
Christians.</P>
<P>Let us think what astonishment would
have filled our minds, and what devout e∣motions
would have swelled our hearts, if
we could have been spectators of the crea∣tion
of the world; if we had seen the earth
when it arose at first <HI>without form and void,</HI>
and beheld its parts arranged by the divine
word; if we had heard the voice of the
Almighty, calling light to spring forth from
the <HI>darkness that was on the face of the deep;</HI>
<PB N="417" REF="430"/>
if we had seen the sun arising, for the first
time, in the east with majestic glory; and
all nature instantly beginning to teem with
life. This wonderful scene, it was impos∣sible
that any human eye could behold. It
was a spectacle afforded only to angels, and
superior spirits. But to a spectacle no less
astonishing, the final dissolution of the
world, we know there shall be many hu∣man
witnesses. The race of men living in
that last age, shall see the presages of the
approaching fatal day. There shall be <HI>signs
in the sun,</HI> as the Scripture informs us, <HI>and</HI>
signs in the moon, and stars; upon the earth,
distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea
and the waves roaring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, xxi. 25.</NOTE> They shall clear∣ly
perceive, that universal nature is tend∣ing
to ruin. They shall feel the globe
shake; shall behold their cities fall; and
the final conflagration begin to kindle a∣round
them.—Realising then this awful
scene; imagining ourselves to be already
spectators of it, let us,</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="431"/>
I. CONTEMPLATE the Supreme Being
directing the dissolution, as he directed the
original formation, of the world. He is
the great agent in this wonderful transac∣tion.
It was by him foreseen. It was by
him intended; it entered into his plan
from the moment of creation. This world
was destined from the beginning to fulfil a
certain period; and then its duration was
to terminate. Not that it is any pleasure to
the Almighty, to display his omnipotence
in destroying the works which he has made;
but as for wise and good purposes the earth
was formed, so for wise and good ends it
is dissolved, when the time most proper for
its termination is come. He who, in the
counsels of his Providence, brings about so
many revolutions among mankind; who
<HI>changeth the times and the seasons;</HI> who rai∣ses
up empires to rule, in succession, among
the nations, and at his pleasure puts an end
to their glory; hath also fixed a term for
the earth itself, the seat of all human great∣ness.
He saw it meet, that after the pro∣bationary
course was finished, which the
<PB N="419" REF="432"/>
generations of men were to accomplish,
their present habitation should be made to
pass away. Of the seasonableness of the
period when this change should take place,
no being can judge, except the Lord of the
universe. These are counsels, into which
it is not ours to penetrate. But amidst this
great revolution of nature, our comfort is,
that it is a revolution brought about by
Him, the measures of whose government
are all founded in goodness.</P>
<P>It is called in the text, <HI>the day of the Lord;</HI>
a day peculiarly his, as known to him on∣ly;
a day in which he shall appear with
uncommon and tremendous majesty. But
though it be the day of the terrors of the
Lord, yet from these terrors, his upright
and faithful subjects shall have nothing to
apprehend. They may remain safe and
quiet spectators of the threatening scene.
For it is not to be a scene of blind confu∣sion;
of universal ruin, brought about by
undesigning chance. Over the shock of
the elements, sund the wreck of nature,
Eternal Wisdom presides. According to its
<PB N="420" REF="433"/>
direction, the conflagration advances which
is to consume the earth. Amidst every
convulsion of the world, God shall conti∣nue
to be, as he was from the beginning,
<HI>the dwelling-place of his servants to all gene∣rations.</HI>
The world may be lost to them;
but the ruler of the world is ever the same,
unchangeably good and just This is the
<HI>high tower</HI> to which they can fly, and be
safe. <HI>The righteous</HI> Lord loveth righteous∣ness;
and under every period of his govern∣ment,
<HI>his countenance beholdeth the upright.</HI></P>
<P>II. LET us contemplate the dissolution of
the world, as the end of all human glory.
This earth has been the theatre of many a
great spectacle, and many a high atchieve∣ment.
There, the wise have ruled, the
mighty have fought, and conquerors have
triumphed. Its surface has been covered
with proud and stately cities. Its temples
and palaces have raised their heads to the
skies. Its kings and potentates, glorying
in their magnificence, have erected pyra∣mids,
constructed towers, founded monu∣ments,
<PB N="421" REF="434"/>
which they imagined were to defy
all the assaults of time. <HI>Their inward
thought was, that their houses were to conti∣nue
for ever, and their dwelling-places to all
generations.</HI> Its philosophers have explored
the secrets of nature; and flattered them∣selves,
that the fame of their discoveries
was to be immortal.—Alas! all this was
no more than a transient show. Not only
<HI>the fashion of the world,</HI> but the world it∣self,
<HI>passeth away.</HI> The day cometh, when
all the glory of this world shall be remem∣bered,
only as <HI>a dream when one awaketh.</HI>
No longer shall the earth exhibit any of
those scenes which now delight our eyes.
The whole beautiful fabric is thrown down,
never more to arise. As soon as the de∣stroying
angel has sounded the last trum∣pet,
the everlasting mountains fall; the
foundations of the world are shaken; the
beauties of nature, the decorations of art,
the labours of industry, perish in one com∣mon
flame. The globe itself shall either
return into its ancient chaos, <HI>without form
and void;</HI> or, like a star fallen from the
<PB N="422" REF="435"/>
heavens, shall be effaced from the universe,
and <HI>its place shall know it no more.</HI></P>
<P>THIS day of the Lord, it is foretold in
the text, <HI>will come as a thief in the night;</HI>
that is, sudden and unexpected. Mankind,
notwithstanding the presages given them,
shall continue to the last in their wonted
security. Our Saviour tells us, that <HI>as in
the days of Noah before the flood, they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the flood came, and took them
all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of
man be.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew, xxiv. 38.</NOTE>—How many projects and de∣signs
shall that day suddenly confound?
What long-contrived schemes of pleasure
shall it overthrow? What plans of cunning
and ambition shall it utterly blast? How
miserable they, whom it shall overtake in
the midst of dark conspiracies, of criminal
deeds, or profligate pleasures? In what
strong colours is their dismay painted, when
they are represented in the book of Reve∣lations,
<PB N="423" REF="436"/>
as calling <HI>to the hills and mountains
to fall on them and cover them?</HI>—Such de∣scriptions
are apt to be considered as exag∣gerated.
The impression of those awful
events is weakened by the great distance of
time, at which our imagination places
them. But have not we had a striking
image set before us, in our own age, of the
terrors which the day of the Lord shall pro∣duce,
by those partial ruins of the world,
which the visitation of God has brought on
countries well known, and not removed very
far from ourselves? When in the midst of
peace, opulence, and security, suddenly the
earth was felt by the terrified inhabitants to
tremble, with violent agitation, below them;
when their houses began to shake over their
heads, and to overwhelm them with ruins;
the flood, at the same time, to rise from its
bed, and to swell around them; when en∣compassed
with universal desolation, no
friend could aid another; no prospect of
escape appeared; no place of refuge remain∣ed;
how similar were such scenes of de∣struction
to the terrors of the last day?
<PB N="424" REF="437"/>
What similar sensations of dread, and re∣morse,
and too late repentance, must they
have excited among the guilty and pro∣fane?</P>
<P>To such formidable convulsions of na∣ture,
we, in these happy islands, through
the blessing of Heaven, are strangers; and
strangers to them may we long continue!
But however we may escape partial ruins
of the globe, in its general and final ruin,
we also must be involved. To us must
come at last that awful day, when the sun
shall for the last time arise, to perform his
concluding circuit round the world. They
how blest, whom that day shall find em∣ployed
in religious acts, or virtuous deeds;
in the conscientious discharge of the duties
of life; in the exercise of due preparation
for the conclusion of human things, and for
appearing before the great Judge of the
world! Let us now,</P>
<P>III. CONTEMPLATE the soul of man, as
remaining unhurt in the midst of this gene∣ral
desolation, when the whole animal crea∣tion
<PB N="425" REF="438"/>
perishes, and the whole frame of na∣ture
falls into ruins. What a high idea
does this present, of the dignity pertaining
to the rational spirit! The world may fall
back into chaos; but, superior to matter,
and independent of all the changes of ma∣terial
things, the soul continues the same.
When <HI>the heavens pass away with a great
noise, and the elements melt with fervent heat,</HI>
the soul of man, stamped for immortality,
retains its state unimpaired; and is capable
of flourishing in undecaying youth and vi∣gour.
Very different indeed the condition
of human spirits is to be, according as
their different qualities have marked,
and prepared them, for different future man∣sions.
But for futurity, they are all de∣stined.
Existence, still, is theirs. The ca∣pacity
of permanent felicity they all pos∣sess;
and, if they enjoy it not, it is owing to
themselves.</P>
<P>Here then, let us behold what is the true
honour and excellence of man. It consists
not in his body; which, beautiful or vigo∣rous
as it may now seem, is no other than
<PB N="426" REF="439"/>
a fabrick of dust, quickly to return to dust
again. It is not derived from any connec∣tion
he can form with earthly things; which,
as we have seen, are all doomed to perish.
It consists in that thinking part, which is
susceptible of intellectual improvement and
moral worth; which was formed after the
image of God; which is capable of perpe∣tual
progress in drawing nearer to his na∣ture;
and shall partake of the divine eter∣nity,
when time and the world shall be no
more. This is all that is respectable in man.
By this alone, he is raised above perishable
substances, and allied to those that are ce∣lestial
and immortal. This part of our na∣ture,
then, let us cultivate with care; and,
on its improvement, rest our self-estimation.
If, on the contrary, suffering ourselves to
be wholly immersed in matter, plunged in
the dregs of sensuality, we behave as if we
were only made for the body and its ani∣mal
pleasures, how degenerate and base do
we become? Destined to survive this whole
material system, sent forth to run the race of
immortality and glory, shall we thus abuse
<PB N="427" REF="440"/>
our Maker's goodness, degrade our origi∣nal
honour, and sink ourselves into deser∣ved
misery? It remains, that,</P>
<P>IV. WE contemplate the dissolution of
the world, as the introduction to a greater
and nobler system, in the government of
God. <HI>We, according to his promise, look for
new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwel∣leth
righteousness.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Peter, iii. 13.</NOTE>. Temporal things are
now to give place to things eternal. To
this earthly habitation is to succeed the city
of the living God. The earth had com∣pleted
the purpose for which is was created.
It had been employed as a theatre, on which
the human generations were successively to
come forth, and to fulfil their term of trial.
As long as the period of trial continued,
much obscurity was of course to cover the
counsels of Providence. It was appointed,
that <HI>all things</HI> should appear as <HI>coming alike
to all;</HI> that the righteous should seem of∣ten
neglected by Heaven, and the wicked be
<PB N="428" REF="441"/>
allowed externally to prosper; in order that
virtue and piety might undergo a proper
test; that it might be shown who were sin∣cere
adherents to conscience, and who were
mere followers of fortune. The day which
terminates the duration of the world, ter∣minates
all those seeming disorders. The
time of trial is concluded. The final dis∣crimination
of characters is made. When
the righteous go to everlasting happiness,
and the wicked are dismissed into the re∣gions
of punishment, the whole mystery of
human affairs is unravelled; and the con∣duct
of Providence is justified to man.</P>
<P>Suited to a condition of trial was the state
and form of the world, which we now in∣habit.
It was not designed to be a mansion
for innocent and happy spirits; but a dwell∣ing
for creatures of fallen nature, and of
mixed characters. Hence, those mixtures
of pleasure and pain, of disorder and beau∣ty,
with which it abounds. Hence, some
regions of the earth, persenting gay and
pleasing scenes; others, exhibiting nothing
but ruggedness and deformity; the face of
<PB N="429" REF="442"/>
nature, sometimes brightened by a serene
atmosphere, and a splendid sun; sometimes
disfigured by jarring elements, and over∣cast
with troubled skies. But far unlike
shall be the everlasting habitations of the
just: Though how they are formed, or
what objects they contain, is not given us
not to conceive; nor, in all probability,
would our faculties be equal to the con∣ception.
The emblematical descriptions of
them in Scripture, are calculated to excite
high ideas of magnificence and glory. This
one particular we know with certainty, that
<HI>therein dwelleth righteousness;</HI> that is, com∣plete
virtue and eternal order; and where∣ever
these are found, the most perfect
sources are opened of joy and bliss. This
earth was never intended for more than the
outer court, the porch, through which the
righteous were to pass into the temple and
sanctuary of the Divinity. <HI>When that which
is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be
done away.</HI></P>
<P>THE inference which follows from what
<PB N="430" REF="443"/>
has been said on this subject, cannot be so
well expressed as in the words of the Apostle,
in the verse immediately following the text;
<HI>seeing that all these things shall be dissolved,
what manner of persons ought we to be in all
holy conversation and godliness?</HI> Ought not
the important discoveries which have been
made to us, of the designs of the Almighty,
and of the destiny of man, to exalt our sen∣timents,
and to purify our life from what
is vitious or vain? While we pursue the
business and cares of our present station,
and partake of the innocent pleasures which
the world affords, let us maintain that dig∣nity
of character, which becomes immortal
beings; let us act with that circumspection,
which becomes those who know they are
soon to stand before the judgement-seat of
the Son of God: In a word, let us study to
be what we would wish to be found, if to
us the day of the Lord should come.</P>
<P>I KNOW it will occur, that the prospect of
that day cannot be expected to have much
influence of the present age. The events
<PB N="431" REF="444"/>
of which I have treated, must needs, it will
be said, belong to some future race of men.
Many prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled.
Many preparatory events must take place,
before the world is ripe for final judgement.
—Whether this be the case of not, none
of us with certainty know.—But allow me
to remind you, that to each of us, an event
is approaching, and not far distant, which
shall prove of the same effect, with the co∣ming
of the day of the Lord. The day of
death is, to every individual, the same as
the day of the dissolution of the world.
The sun may continue to shine; but to
them who are laid in the grave, his light is
finally extinguished. The world may re∣main
active, busy, and noisy; but to them,
all is silence. The voice which gives the
mandate, <HI>Return again to your dust,</HI> is the
same with the sound of the last trumpet.
Death fixes the doom of every one, finally
and irrevocably. This surely is an event
which none of us can remove in our
thoughts to a remote age. To-morrow,
to-day, the fatal mandate may be is∣sued.
<PB N="432" REF="445"/>
<HI>Watch therefore; be sober and vigi∣lant;
ye know not at what hour the Son of
Man cometh.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING now treated both of the crea∣tion
and dissolution of the world, I cannot
conclude, without calling your thoughts to
the magnificent view, which these events
give us, of the kingdom and dominion of
the Almighty. With reverence we con∣template
his hand in the signal dispensa∣tions
of Providence among men; deciding
the fate of battles; raising up, or overthrow∣ing
empires; casting down the proud, and
lifting the low from the dust. But what
are such occurrences to the power and wis∣dom,
which He displays in the higher re∣volutions
of the universe; by his word,
forming, or dissolving worlds; at his plea∣sure,
transplanting his creatures from one
world to another; that he may carry on
new plans of wisdom and goodness, and
fill all space with the wonders of creation!
Successive generations of men have arisen
to possess the earth. By turns they have
<PB N="433" REF="446"/>
passed away, and gone into regions un∣known.
Us he hath raised up, to occupy
their room. We too shall shortly disappear.
But human existence never perishes. Life
only changes its form, and is renewed.
Creation is ever filling, but never full.
When the whole intended course of the ge∣nerations
of men shall be finished, then, as
a shepherd leads his flock from one pasture
to another, so the great Creator leads forth
the souls which he has made, into new and
prepared abodes of life. They go from this
earth to a new earth, and new heavens;
and still they remove, only from one pro∣vince
of the divine dominion to another.
Amidst all those changes of nature, the great
Ruler himself remains, <HI>without variableness
or shadow of turning.</HI> To him, these succes∣sive
revolutions of being are but <HI>as yetsterday
when it is past.</HI> From his eternal throne, he
beholds worlds rising and passing away;
measures out, to the creatures who inhabit
them, powers and faculties suited to their
state; and distributes among them rewards
and punishments, proportioned to their ac∣tions.
<PB N="434" REF="447"/>
—What an astonishing view do such
meditations afford of the kingdom of God;
infinite in its extent; everlasting in its du∣ration;
exhibiting, in every period, the
reign of perfect righteousness and wisdom!
<HI>Who by searching can find out God? who can
find out the Almighty to perfection? Great
and marvellous are all thy works, Lord God
Almighty! Just and true are all thy ways,
thou King of saints!</HI></P>
