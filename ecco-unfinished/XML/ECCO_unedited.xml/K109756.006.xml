<HEAD>The FLY-BIRD. <HI>L'Oiseau</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Spanish <HI>Tomineios:</HI> in Peruvian <HI>Quinti</HI> or <HI>Quindé,</HI> which name obtains also in Paraguay: in Mexican <HI>Huitzitzil</HI> or <HI>Hoitzitzil, Ourissia</HI> (sun-beam): in Brazilian <HI>Guianumbi,</HI> which is generic. It is also called <HI>Vicililin</HI> and <HI>Guachichil</HI> (flower-sucker) in Mexico. Brisson terms it <HI>Mellisuga</HI> or honey-sucker; Linnaeus <HI>Trochilus,</HI> or little-top. In English it is usually known by the name of <HI>hum∣ming-bird.</HI> Mr. Pennant denominates it <HI>honey-sucker.</HI></P>
<P>[The Mexican appellations of <HI>Huitzitzil</HI> and <HI>Vicililin,</HI> signify <HI>re∣generated;</HI> which alludes to a notion entertained by the Indians that in autumn this bird stuck its bill into the trunk of a tree, and remained insensible during the winter months, till the vernal warmth again waked it to animation, and invited it to its flowery pasture.

<P>OF all animated beings, the Fly-bird is the most elegant in its form, and the most brilliant in its colours. The precious stones and metals polished by our art cannot be com∣pared to this jewel of nature. Her miniature
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
productions are ever the most wonderful; she has placed it in the order of birds, at the bottom of the scale of magnitude; but all the talents which are only shared among the others, nim∣bleness, rapidity, sprightliness, grace, and rich decoration, she has bestowed profusely upon this little favourite. The emerald, the ruby, the topaz, sparkle in its plumage, which is never soiled by the dust of the ground. It inhabits the air; it flutters from flower to flower; it breathes their freshness; it feeds on their nec∣tar, and resides in climates where they blow in perpetual succession.</P>
<P>It is in the hottest part of the new world that all the species of Fly-birds are found. They are numerous, and seem confined between the two tropics <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laet. <HI>Ind. Occid.</HI> Lib. V. 256.</NOTE>; for those which penetrate in summer within the temperate zones make but a short stay. They follow the course of the sun; with him they advance or retire; they fly on the wings of the zephir, to wanton in eternal spring.</P>
<P>The Indians, struck with the dazzle and glow of the colours of these brilliant birds, have named them the <HI>beams or locks of the sun</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.</NOTE>. The Spaniards call them <HI>tomineos,</HI> on account of their diminutive size, <HI>tomine</HI> signifying a weight of twelve grains. "I saw," says Nie∣remberg, "one of these birds weighed with its
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
nest, and the whole together did not amount to two tomines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg, p. 239. Acosta, Lib. IV. cap. 37.</NOTE>." The smaller species do not exceed the bulk of the great gad-fly, or the thickness of the drone. Their bill is a fine needle, and their tongue a delicate thread; their little black eyes resemble two brilliant points; the feathers of their wings are so thin as to look transparent <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.</NOTE>; hardly can the feet be perceiv∣ed, so short they are and so slender: and these are little used, for they rest only during the night. Their flight is buzzing, continued, and rapid; Marcgrave compares the noise of their wings to the <HI>whirr</HI> of a spinning-wheel: so rapid is the quiver of their pinions, that when the bird halts in the air, it seems at once de∣prived of motion and of life. Thus it rests a few seconds beside a flower, and again shoots to another like a gleam. It visits them all, thrusting its little tongue into their bosom, and caressing them with its wings; it never settles, but it never quite abandons them. Its playful inconstancy multiplies its innocent pleasures; for the dalliance of this little lover of flowers never spoils their beauty. It only sips their ho∣ney, and its tongue seems calculated for that purpose: it consists of two hollow fibres, form∣ing a small canal <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Macrgrave.</NOTE>, parted at the end into two
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
filaments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Labat, t. IV. 13.</NOTE>: it resembles the proboscis of insects, and performs the same office <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Natural History of Guiana, p. 165.</NOTE>. The bird pro∣trudes it from its bill, probably by a mechanism of the <HI>os hyoides,</HI> similar to what obtains in the tongue of wood-peckers. It thrusts it to the bottom of the flowers, and sucks their juices. Such is its mode of subsisting according to all the authors who have written on the subject <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Garcilasso, Gomara, Hernandez, Clusius, Nieremberg, Mare∣grave, Sloane, Catesby, Feuillée, Labat, Dutertre, &amp;c.</NOTE>. One person alone denies the fact; he is Ba∣dier <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Journal de Physique, <HI>Janvier</HI> 1778, p. 32.</NOTE>, who, finding in the oesophagus some portions of insects, concludes that the bird lives on these, and not the nectar of flowers. But we cannot reject a number of respectable au∣thorities for a single hasty assertion; though the Fly-bird swallow some insects, does it thence follow that it subsists upon them? Nay, must it not necessarily happen, that, sucking the ho∣ney from the flowers, or gathering their pol∣len, it will sometimes swallow the little in∣sects which are entangled? Besides, the rapid waste of its spirits, the consequence of its ex∣treme vivacity and its rapid incessant motion, must continually be recruited by rich nutriti∣ous aliments: and Sloane, on whose observa∣tions I lay the greatest stress, positively avers
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
that he found the stomach of the Fly-bird en∣tirely filled with the pollen, and sweet juice of flowers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nat Hist. Jamaica, p. 307.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the vivacity of these lit∣tle creatures, but their courage, or rather auda∣city; they furiously pursue birds twenty times larger than themselves, fix in the plumage, and as they are hurried along strike keenly with the bill, till they vent their feeble rage <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Browne, p. 475; Charlevoix, <HI>Nouvelle France,</HI> t. III. p. 158; Dutertre, <HI>t.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 263.</NOTE>: sometimes even they fight obstinately with each other. They are all impatience; if upon alighting in a flower they find it faded, they will pluck the petals with a precipitation that marks their dis∣pleasure. Their voice is only a feeble cry <HI>screp, screp,</HI> which is frequent and reiterated <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave compares this note, for its continuance, to that of the sparrow, <HI>p.</HI> 196.</NOTE>. They are heard in the woods at the dawn of the morn∣ing <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave, <HI>p.</HI> 196.</NOTE>, and as soon as the sun begins to gild the summits of the trees, they take wing and dis∣perse in the fields.</P>
<P>They are solitary <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Philosophical Transactions, <HI>No.</HI> 200, <HI>art.</HI> 5.</NOTE>; and indeed, fluttering irregular in the breeze, they could hardly asso∣ciate. But the power of love surmounts the elements, and, with its golden chains, it binds all animated beings. The Fly-birds are seen to pair in the breeding season; their nest corres∣ponds

to the delicacy of their bodies; it is form∣ed with the soft cotton or silky down gathered from flowers, and has the consistency and feel of a thick smooth skin. The female performs the work, and the male collects the materials <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutertre, <HI>t.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 262.</NOTE>. She applies herself with ardour; selects, one by one, the fibres proper to form the texture of this kindly cradle for her progeny; she smooths the margin with her breast, the inside with her tail; she covers the outside with bits of the bark of the gum tree, which are stuck to shelter from the weather, and give solidity to the fabric <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>: the whole is attached to two leaves, or a single sprig of the orange or citron <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Browne.</NOTE>, or sometimes to a straw hanging from the roof of an hut <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dutertre.</NOTE>. The nest is not larger than the half of an apri∣cot <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Feuillée <HI>Journal d'Observations,</HI> t. I. p. 413.</NOTE>, and it is also shaped like a half cup. It contains two eggs, which are entirely white, and not exceeding the bulk of small pease. The cock and hen sit by turns twelve days; on the thirteenth the young are excluded, which are then not larger than flies. "I could never perceive," says Father Dutertre, "how the mother fed them, except that she presented the tongue covered entirely with honey extracted from flowers."</P>
<P>We may easily conceive that it is impossible to raise these little flutterers. Those who have
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
tried to feed them with syrups could not keep them alive more than a few weeks; these ali∣ments, though of easy digestion, are very dif∣ferent from the delicate nectar collected from the fresh blossoms. Perhaps honey would have succeeded better.</P>
<P>The method of obtaining them is to shoot with sand, or by means of the <HI>trunk-gun;</HI> they will allow one to approach within five or six paces of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are so numerous, says Marcgrave, that a fowler may easily take sixty in a day.</NOTE>. They may be caught by placing a twig smeared over with a clammy gum in a flowering shrub. It is easy to lay hold of the little creature while it hums at a blossom. It dies soon after it is caught <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dutertre and Marcgrave.</NOTE>, and serves to decorate the Indian girls, who wear two of these charming birds, as pendants from their ears. The Peruvians had the art of forming their feathers into pictures, whose beauty is perpetually extolled in the older narratives <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Ximenes, who attributes the same art to the Mexicans: Gemelli Carreri, Thevet, Lery, Hernandez, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Marcgrave, who saw some of these pieces of workmanship, admires their brilliancy and de∣licacy.</P>
<P>With the lustre and gloss of flowers, these pretty birds have been supposed to have also the perfume; and many authors have asserted that
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
they have the fragrance of musk. The mistake originated probably from the name applied by Oviedo, of <HI>passer mosquitus,</HI> which would easily be changed into <HI>passer moscatus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner very justly remarks that this epithet is derived rather from <HI>musca</HI> (a fly), than from <HI>moschus</HI> (the name in modern Latin for musk.)</NOTE>. But this is not the only marvellous circumstance with which their history has been clouded <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dutertre corrects very judiciously many pue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile exagger∣ations, and detects, as usual, the mistakes of Rochefort, <HI>t.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 263.</NOTE>; it has been said that they are half birds, half flies, and produced from a fly <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Nieremberg, <HI>p.</HI> 240.</NOTE>; and a Provincial of the Jesuits gravely affirms in Clusius, that he was witness to this transformation <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This Jesuit, says Clusius, made strange relations in natural history. <HI>Exotic, p.</HI> 96.</NOTE>.

mentioned their being frequent the whole year in the woods of Brazil.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with twenty-four spe∣cies in the genus of the Fly-bird; and it is pro∣bable some have been overlooked. We shall distinguish them by their different denomi∣nations, drawn from the most obvious cha∣racters.</P>

The <HI>Least Humming-bird,</HI> Sloane, Edw. and Lath.</HEAD>
<P>IT is congruous to begin with the smallest species, in enumerating the smallest genus. This Least Fly-bird is scarce fifteen lines in length; its bill is three and a half, its tail four: so that there remains only nine lines for the head, the neck, and the body. It is smaller, therefore, than some of our flies. All the up∣per side of the head and body is of a gold green changing brown, and with reddish reflections; all the under side is of a white grey. The fea∣thers of the wing are brown, inclining to violet, and this is the general colour of the wings in all the Fly-birds, as well as in the colibris. The bill also and the feet are commonly black, the legs are clothed pretty low with little downy plumules; and the toes are furnished with little sharp curved nails. All of them have six feathers in the tail; Marcgrave mentions only four, which
<PB N="11" REF="24"/>
is probably a mistake of the transcriber. The colour of these tail-feathers is, in most of the species, bluish black, with the lustre of bur∣nished steel. In the female the colours are ge∣nerally not so bright; it is acknowledged too by the best observers to be rather smaller than the male <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grew in the Philosophical Transactions, <HI>No.</HI> 200, <HI>art.</HI> 5.—Labat, Dutertre.</NOTE>. The bill of the Fly-bird is equally thick throughout, slightly swelled at the tip, compressed horizontally and <HI>straight.</HI> This last character distinguishes the Fly-bird from the co∣libris, which most naturalists, and even Marc∣grave, have confounded.</P>
<P>This first and least species is found in Brazil and the Antilles. The bird was sent to us from Martinico with its nest; Edwards received it from Jamaica. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Trochilus Minimus:</HI> "Its lateral tail-feathers white at their outer edge, its body of shining green, below whitish."

<P>IN observing the scale of magnitude, many would occupy the second place. We shall take the Carolina Fly-bird, and denominate it the <HI>Ruby.</HI> Catesby feebly expresses the lustre and beauty of the colour of its throat, when he calls it a <HI>crimson enamel:</HI> it has the brilliancy and fire of the ruby. In a side view, it has a gold tinge, and, seen from below, it appears a dull garnet. We may remark that the feathers of the throat are fashioned and disposed like scales, round and detached; which arrange∣ment multiplies the reflections, that play both on the neck and the head of the Fly-birds, among all their sparkling feathers. In the pre∣sent, all the upper side of the body is gold-green, changing into red copper; the breast and the fore part of the body are mixed with
<PB N="13" REF="26"/>
white, grey, and blackish; the two feathers in the middle of the tail are of the colour of the back, and the lateral feathers are purple-brown; Catesby says <HI>copper colour.</HI> The wing is brown, tinged with violet, which, as we have already observed, is the common colour of the wings in all these birds; so that we may omit them in the subsequent descriptions. The form of the wings is singular: Catesby compares it to the blade of a Turkish scimeter. The four or five first outer quills are long, the next much less so, and those nearest the body are extremely small; which, joined to another circumstance, that the largest are curved outwards, makes the two wings when spread resemble a drawn bow, of which the little body of the bird represents the arrow in the middle.</P>
<P>The Ruby appears in summer in Carolina, and even in New England; it is the only Fly-bird that penetrates into the northern pro∣vinces <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catesby and Edwards.</NOTE>. Some narratives transport it to Gas∣pesia <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nouvelle relation de la Gaspesie,</HI> par le R. P. Chretien le Clerque, <HI>Paris,</HI> 1691, <HI>p.</HI> 486.

Gen. des Voy. <HI>t.</HI> XIV. <HI>p.</HI> 456.</NOTE>; it breeds in Ca∣rolina in summer, and departs when the flow∣ers begin to fade. It extracts its nourishment from the flowers only; "and I have always observed," says Catesby, "that it never feeds on insects, but entirely on honey-juices <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Carolina, Vol. I. p. 65.</NOTE>." <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Trochilus-Colubris:</HI> "It is gold-green; its tail-feathers black, the three lateral ones ferruginous tipt with white; its throat flame coloured."

<P>ALL the throat and the fore part of the neck are of a brilliant amethyst, which it is impossible to figure or paint. This is one of the smallest of the Fly-birds; its size and form the same with those of the Ruby; its tail is also forked. The fore side of the body is marbled with white, grey, and brown; the upper side is gold-green; the amethyst colour of the throat changes into purple brown, when the eye is placed lower than the object. The wings seem rather shorter than in the other Fly-birds, and reach not the two middle feathers of the tail, which are however the shortest, and give it a forked shape. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Trochilus Amethystinus:</HI> "It is gold-green, below variegated with ash and brown, its throat ame∣thystine."

<P>GREEN and gold yellow sparkle more or less in all the Fly-birds; but these fine co∣lours cover the whole plumage of this, with a brilliancy and gloss which the eye cannot enough admire.

<P>THIS name marks a very singular character, which distinguishes this bird from all the rest.

but the ends a little windened, and tipt with a green dot. The bird erects them reclining them back; while at rest they lie flat on the neck, as also does the beautiful tuft: but they are all bristled when it flies, and the bird ap∣pears quite round. The throat and the fore fide of the neck are of a rich gold-green (if the eye be held much lower than the object, these brilliant feathers appear entirely brown); the head and all the upper side of the body green, with dazzling reflections of gold and bronze, as far as the white bar that crosses the rump; beyond this, to the end of the tail, is spread a shining gold on a brown ground on the outer webs of the quills, and rufous on the inner ones; the under side of the body is gold-green brown; the lower belly, white. The Tufted-neck does not exceed the size of the Amethyst; the female resembles it, except that it has no tuft or external ears: the bar of the rump is rusty, and so is the throat; the rest of the under side of the body rufous, shaded with greenish; its back and the upper side of the head are as in the male, green with gold and bronze reflections.</P>

<P>OF all the birds of the genus, this is the most beautiful, says Marcgrave, and the most elegant: it has colours and the spark∣ling fire of the Ruby and the Topaz: the upper side of its head and neck is as brilli∣ant as a ruby; the throat, all the fore side of the neck, in the front view, dazzle like the Aurora Topaz of Brazil. The same parts, seen a little lower, resemble unburnished gold, and still lower, change into a dull green; the top of the neck and the belly are of a velvet black brown; the wing is violet brown; the lower belly white; the inferior coverts of the tail and its quills are of a fine gold-rufous, and tinged with purple; it is edged with brown at the end; the rump is brown, heightened with gold-green; the wings, when closed, do not extend beyond the tail, whose quills are equal. Marcgrave remarks that it is broad, and that the bird displays it gracefully in flying. It is pretty large for its kind. Its total length is three inches and from four to six lines; its bill is seven or eight; Marcgrave calls this <HI>half an</HI>

We may notice a cha∣racter which all the Fly-birds and Colibris have, viz that the bill is thick feathered at its base, and sometimes as far as the fourth or third of its length.</P>

In other respects, the resemblance is striking; and, from a comparison of the figures, the latter appears rather smaller and its colours not so deep, though the tints and distributions are essentially the

same: so that the one seems to be young, the other adult. Or perhaps it is a variety of cli∣mate; since the one comes from Cayenne, the other from Brazil.

But the female of the Topaz-breasted Fly-bird, whose body is brown, can∣not surely be green. In this, as in every other genus of birds, the colours of the female are al∣ways duller than those of the male.

<P>TWO naked shafts, extending from the two middle feathers of the tail, are terminated with little fans, which gives them the form of rackets. The ribs of all the quills of the tail are very thick, and of a rusty white; the rest is brown, like the wings. The upper side of the body is of a bronze green, which is the colour common to all the Fly-birds; the throat is of a rich emerald-green. The point of the bill is about thirty lines from the end of the true tail; the two shafts extend ten lines farther. This species is not well known, and seems very rare. We have described it from a specimen in Mauduit's cabinet.

<P>WE apply the epithet <HI>eared</HI> to this Fly-bird, both on account of the remarkable colour of the two pencils of feathers, which

These are the remarks of Mauduit, and well agree with his ingenious ob∣servation, which we formerly had occasion to mention, viz. that all the feathers which ap∣pear superabundant, or, so to speak, parasite, in birds are not peculiarities of structure, but merely the extension and developement of parts common to all the others. The Eared Fly-bird is of the first magnitude, being four inches and a half long. Of the two pencils which dis∣tinguish the ears, and which consist each of five or six feathers, the one is emerald-green, and the other amethyst-violet; a streak of velvet black stretches under the eye; all the fore part of the head and body is of a bright gold-green, which changes on the coverts of the tail into a very lively bright green; the throat and un∣der side of the body are of a fine white; of the tail quills, the six lateral ones are of the same white, the four mid-ones black, inclining to deep blue; the wing is blackish, and the tail projects beyond it nearly one-third of its length.

<P>THIS bird and the preceding are the two largest of the genus.

<P>THE beautiful violet blue, which covers the head, throat, and neck, would seem to in∣dicate an analogy to the sapphire, did not length of the tail exhibit too great a difference. The two exterior quills are two inches longer than the two mid-ones; the lateral ones continually diminish, which makes the tail very much forked. The bird is dark blue, glistening like burnished steel; all the body, both above and below, is of a shining gold-green; there is a white spot on the lower belly; the wings, when closed, reach only to the middle of the tail, which is three inches and three lines; the bill is eleven lines, and the total length is six inches.

<P>WHEN nature bestowed beauty so lavish∣ly on the fly-birds, she neglected not their kindred tribe, the Colibris. Both inha∣biting the same climate, fashioned after the same model, and decorated by the same brilliancy of plumage: the same vivacity, the same perpe∣tual flutter of action, and the same habits and economy. As their resemblance is so entire, they have often been confounded under the same name: that of <HI>Colibri</HI> is adopted from the lan∣guage of the Caribbees. Marcgrave applies to both indifferently the Brazilian appellation, <HI>Guainumbi.</HI> But they are distinguished by an obvious and permanent character: in the Co∣libris the bill is equal and taper, inflated slight∣ly near the end, and not straight, as in the fly-birds, but curved throughout, and longer also in proportion. Further, the neat and slender form of the Colibris seems to be more length∣ened than that of the fly-birds; and they are in general larger: yet there are some little Co∣libris smaller than the great fly-birds. The
<PB REF="56"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>COLIBRIS, OF THE NATURAL SIZE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="41" REF="57"/>
Colibris should be ranged below the creepers, though they differ in the shape and length of their bill; in the number of the feathers of their tail, there being ten in the former and twelve in the latter; and in the structure of their tongue, which is simple in the latter, but in the former divided into two semi-cylindrical portions, as in the fly-bird.</P>
<P>All naturalists agree that the Colibris and fly-birds have the same manner of living. It has, indeed, been denied that either of these tribes feed on the honey of flowers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal de Physique, <HI>Janvier</HI> 1778.</NOTE>. But the rea∣sons already adduced convince us that this as∣sertion is unfounded; and the general resem∣blance of these birds corroborates the evidence that their mode of subsisting is the same.</P>
<P>It is no less difficult to breed the young of the Colibri than those of the fly-bird; they are as delicate, and confinement proves equally fa∣tal to them. The parents have been seen, hur∣ried on by the audacity of affection, to rush with food for their progeny into the very hands of the plunderer. Labat relates an instance of this, which deserves to be quoted. "I show∣ed," says he, "to Father Montdidier a nest of Colibris, which was placed on a shed near the house. He carried it off with the young, when they were about fifteen or twenty days old, and put them in a cage at his room window, where
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
the cock and hen continued to feed them, and grew so tame, that they scarcely ever left the room; and though not shut in the cage, nor subjected to any restraint, they used to eat and sleep with their brood. I have often seen all the four sitting upon Father Montdidier's finger, singing, as if they had been perched upon a branch. He fed them with a very fine and almost limpid paste, made with biscuit, Spanish wine, and sugar. They dipt their tongue in it, and when their appetite was sa∣tisfied they fluttered and chanted... I never saw any thing more lovely than those four pret∣ty little birds, which flew about the house, and attended the call of their foster-father <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"He preserved them in this way five or six months, and we hoped soon to see them breed, when Father Montdidier, having one night forgotten to tie the cage in which they roosted by a cord that hung from the ceiling, to keep them from the rats, had the vexation in the morning to find that they were disappeared; they had been devoured." Labat, <HI>Nouveau Voyage aux Iles de l'Ame∣rique.</HI> Paris, 1722, t. IV. p. 14.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Marcgrave, who does not discriminate the Colibris from the fly-birds, mentions them as having only a feeble cry, and no travellers ascribe song to them. Thevet and Lery alone assert of their <HI>gonambouch</HI> that it chants so as to rival the nightingale <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"But, as a singular curiosity, and as a master-piece of little∣ness, we must not omit a bird which the savages call <HI>gonambouch,</HI> of a whitish and shining plumage, which, though not larger than a hornet, excels in song; insomuch that this diminutive creature, searce stirring from the great millet, which the Americans name <HI>avati,</HI> or other great plants, has its bill and throat always open. If one did not repeatedly see and hear, he would hardly be per∣suaded that from so slender a body could proceed notes so clear, so liquid, and so loud, as not to yield to those of the nightingale." <HI>Voyage au Bresil, par Jean de Lery.</HI> Paris, 1578, p. 175. The same fact is mentioned by Thevet. <HI>Singularités de la France An∣lartique.</HI> Paris, 1558. p. 94.</NOTE>; for it is from them

<P>It does not appear that the Colibris advance so far into North America as the fly-birds; at least, Catesby says that he saw only one species of these in Carolina. And Charlevoix, who pretends that he found a fly-bird in Canada, confesses that he never saw there a Colibri <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Saint Domingue. <HI>Paris,</HI> 1730, <HI>t.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 32.</NOTE>.

Its form is delicate, slender, elegant, and rather smaller than the common creeper, its total length, from the point of the bill to the end of the true tail, being near six inches; the two long shafts project two inches and a half beyond it; the throat, and the fore side of the
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
neck, decorated by the most brilliant topaz mark; that colour viewed obliquely changes into gold-green, and from below it appears pure green; a hood of soft black covers the head, a thread of the same black incloses the topaz mark; the breast, the neck, the top of the back, are of a finer deep purple; the belly is of a still richer purple, and dazzling with red and gold reflections; the shoulders and the lower part of the back, are orange rufous; the great quills of the wing, violet-brown; the lit∣tle quills, rufous; the colour of the superior and inferior coverts of the tail, gold-green; the la∣teral quills rufous, the two middle ones, pur∣ple brown; these project into two long shafts, which are webbed with a small edging a line broad on each side; these long shafts, in their natural position, cross each other a little beyond the tail, and then diverge; they drop in moult∣ing, and the male to which they belong would then resemble the female, were he not discri∣minated by other characters. The female has not the topaz breast, but only a slight trace of red; and in place of the fine purple and flame rufous of the male's plumage, almost all that of the female is gold-green: in both the feet are white. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Trochilus Pella:</HI> "It is red, its middle tail-feathers very long, its head brown, its throat golden, and its rump green."</NOTE></P>

<P>ACCORDING to Seba, whom Klein and Bris∣son have followed in reckoning this a spe∣cies of Colibri, the two long projections of fea∣thers which decorate its tail are of a fine blue; the same colour, only deeper, covers the sto∣mach and fore part of the head; the upper side of the body and of the wings is light green; the belly cinereous.

shades in the form of the bill which discrimi∣nate these three tribes, the fly-birds, the colibris, and the creepers. Nor is he more fortunate in displaying his erudition; he applies to this Co∣libri the Mexican name <HI>yayauhquitototl,</HI> which, in Fernandez, denotes a bird of the size of a stare.

<P>THE animals which man has the most ad∣mired, are those that seem to partici∣pate of his nature. He is struck with wonder as often as he traces his external form in the ape, or hears his voice imitated by the Parrot; and, in first moments of his surprise, he is dis∣posed to rank them above the rest of the brutes. These animals have fixed even the stupid at∣tention of savages, who behold the magnificent scene of nature and her exquisite productions with the most perfect insensibility: they stop the progress of their canoes, and linger gazing whole hours at the capers of the marmoset. Parrots are the only birds which they are fond of raising and educating, and which they are even at pains to improve; for they have discovered the art, which is still unknown to us, of vary∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="80"/>
and heightening the colours that deck the plumage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those Parrots to which the savages give artificial colours are termed <HI>tapirés.</HI> This is effected, it is said, by means of the blood of a frog, which they drop into the small wounds made in young Parrots by plucking their feathers: those which sprout again change their green or yellow tints into orange, rose colour, or variegated hues, according to the medicaments employed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The power of using the hand, and of walk∣ing on two feet, the resemblance, how faint soever, to the face, the want of a tail, the naked hams; the similarity of the sexual parts, the position of the breasts, and the menstrual flux in the females; the ardent passion of the males for women: all these circumstances have procured to the ape the name of <HI>wild man</HI> from those who themselves are indeed only half-men, and who can compare only the exterior charac∣ters. Had what was equally possible taken place, had the voice of the Parrot been bestow∣ed on the ape; the human race would have been struck dumb with astonishment, and the philosopher could hardly have been able to de∣monstrate that the ape was still a brute. It is fortunate, therefore, that nature has separated the faculties of imitating our speech and our gestures, and shared them between two very different species; and while she has conferred on all animals the same senses, and on some the same members and organs, with man, she has reserved for him alone the power of improving
<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
them; that noble mark of our pre-eminence, which constitutes our empire over the animated world.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of improvement; the one barren, and confined to the individual; the other prolific, and extending through the spe∣cies, and cultivated in proportion as it is encou∣raged by the institutions of the society. Among brutes, the experience of one race is never transmitted to the succeeding; their acqui∣sitions are merely individual; they are the same now that they ever were—ever will be. But man is progressive; he receives the instructions of past ages, he reaps the benefit of the disco∣veries of others, and, by a proper use of his time, he may continually advance in know∣ledge. And who can, without regret and in∣dignation, view that long gloomy night of ig∣norance and barbarism, which overspread Eu∣rope, and which not only arrested our improve∣ment, but thrust us back from that elevation which we had attained? But for these unfor∣tunate vicissitudes, the human species would invariably approach towards the point of per∣fection.</P>
<P>The mere savage, who shuns all society, and receives only an individual education, cannot improve his species, and will not differ, even in understanding, from those animals on which he has bestowed his name. Nor will he acquire even speech, if the family be dispersed, and the
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
children abandoned soon after birth. The first rudiments of the social disposition are therefore unfolded by the tender attachment and the watchful solicitude of the mother; the helpless state of the infant requires constant and assidu∣ous attention; its claimant cries are answered by soothing expressions, which begins the form∣ation of language, and, during the space of two or three years, this grows in some degree fixed and regular. But, in other animals, the growth is much more rapid; the parental endearments last only six weeks or two months; and the impressions are slight and transitory; and, after separation, they entirely cease. It is not, there∣fore, to the peculiar structure of our organs that we are indebted for the attainment of speech; the Parrots can articulate the same sounds, but their language is mere prattle, and void of sig∣nification.</P>
<P>The power of imitating our discourse or our actions, confers no real superiority on an ani∣mal. It never incites to the cultivation of ta∣lents; it never tends to the improvement of the species. The articulation of the Parrot implies only the close analogy of its organs of hearing and of voice to those in man; and that similarity of structure obtains, though in a less degree, in many other birds, whose tongue is thick, round, and nearly of the same form. The stares, the blackbirds, the jays, the jack-daws, &amp;c. can imitate words. Those whose tongue is forked

(and almost all the small birds may be ranged in that class), whistle more easily than they prattle; and if, with this structure, they have also sensibility of ear, and can accurately retain the impressions made on that organ, they will learn to repeat airs: the canary, the linnet, the siskin, and the bulfinch, seem natural musicians. The Parrot imitates every sort of noise, the mewing of cats, the barking of dogs, and the notes of other birds, as well as the human voice; yet it can only scream or pronounce very short phrases; and, though capable of even articulating sounds, it is unable to mo∣dulate these, or support them by intermingling gentle cadences. It has therefore less acute∣ness of perception, less memory, and less flexi∣bility of organs.</P>
<P>There are also two different kinds of imita∣tion; the one is acquired from reflection; the other is innate and mechanical: the latter pro∣ceeds from the common instinct diffused through a whole species, which prompts or constrains each individual to perform similar actions; and the more stupid the animal, the more entire will be this influence, and the closer will be the resemblance. A sheep has invariably the same habits with every other sheep; the first cell of a bee is precisely like the last. The knowledge of the individual is equal to that of the species;—such is the distinction between reason and instinct. The other kind of imita∣tion,
<PB N="68" REF="84"/>
which should be regarded as artificial, is the acquisition of the individual, and cannot be communicated. The most accomplished Parrot will never transmit his talent of prattling to his offspring. When an animal is instructed by man, the improvement rests with it alone. This imitation depends as well as the former on the peculiar structure; but it also implies sen∣sibility, attention, and memory; and those spe∣cies which are susceptible of education, rank high in the order of organized beings. If the animal be easily trained, and each individual re∣ceive a certain degree of instruction, as in the case of the dogs, the whole species will acquire superiority under the direction of man; but when abandoned to nature, the dog will relapse into the wolf or the fox, and would never of itself emerge from that state.</P>
<P>All animals may therefore be improved by associating with man; but they cannot be in∣structed to improve each other; for they ne∣ver can communicate the ideas and know∣ledge which they have acquired. Even birds whose shape and proportions are so different from those of quadrupeds, are susceptible of the same degrees of education. The <HI>agamis</HI> can be trained to perform nearly all the actions of the dogs; a canary, properly bred, shews its attachment by caresses that are equally ani∣mated, and more innocent and more sincere than those of the cat. There are many in∣stances

of the wonderful effects of education on the rapacious birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"In 1763," says M. Fontaine, "a buzzard was brought to me that had been taken in a snare: it was at first extremely savage and even cruel. I undertook to tame it, and I succeeded by leav∣ing it to fast, and constraining it to come and eat out of my hand. By pursuing this plan, I brought it to be very familiar; and after having shut it up about six weeks, I began to allow it a little li∣berty, taking the precaution, however, to tie both pinions of its wings. In this condition it walked out into my garden, and re∣turned when I called it to feed. After some time, when I judged that I could trust to its fidelity, I removed the ligatures, and fas∣tened a small bell, an inch and a half in diameter, above its talon, and also attached on the breast a bit of copper having my name engraved. I then gave it entire liberty, which it soon abused; for it took wing, and flew as far as the forest of Belesme. I gave it up for lost; but four hours after I saw it rush into my hall, which was open, pursued by five other buzzards, which had con∣strained it to seek its asylum.... After this adventure it ever preserved its fidelity to me, coming every night to sleep on my window; it grew so familiar with me, as to seem to take singular pleasure in my company. It attended constantly at dinner, sat on a corner of the table, and very often caressed me with its head and bill, emitting a weak sharp cry, which however it sometimes sof∣tened. It is true that I alone had this privilege. It one day fol∣lowed me, when I was on horseback, more than two leagues, sail∣ing above my head.... It had an aversion both to dogs and cats, nor was it in the least afraid of them; it had often tough battles with them, and always came off victorious. I had four very strong cats, which I collected into my garden beside my buzzard; I threw to them a bit of raw flesh, the nimblest cat seized it, the rest pursued; but the bird darted upon her body, bit her ears with his bill, and squeezed her sides with his talons, with such force that the cat was obliged to relinquish her prize. Often another cat snatched it the instant it dropt, but she suffered the same treat∣ment, till the buzzard got entire possession of the plunder. He was so dexterous in his defence, that when he perceived himself as∣sailed at once by the four cats, he took wing, and uttered a cry of exultation. At last, the cats, chagrined at their repeated disap∣pointment, would no longer contend.</P>
<P>"This buzzard had a singular antipathy; he would not suffer a red cap on the head of any peasant, and so alert he was in whip∣ping it off, that they found their head bare without knowing what was become of their cap. He also snatched wigs without doing any injury, and he carried these caps and wigs to the tallest tree in a neighbouring park, which was the ordinary deposit of his booty.... He would suffer no other bird of prey to enter his do∣main; he attacked them very boldly, and put them to flight. He did no mischief in my court-yard, and the poultry, which at first dreaded him, grew insensibly reconciled to him. The chickens and ducklings received not the least harsh usage, and yet he bathed among the latter. But what is singular, he was not gentle to my neighbours' poultry; and I was often obliged to publish that I would pay for the damages which he might occasion. However, he was often fired at, and he received fifteen musket-shots, with∣out suffering any fracture. But once early in the morning, hover∣ing over the skirts of a forest, he dared to attack a fox; and the keeper seeing him on the shoulders of the fox, fired two shots at him; the fox was killed and the buzzard had his wing broken; yet notwithstanding this fracture he escaped from the keeper, and was lost seven days. This man having discovered, from the noise of the bell, that he was my bird, came next morning to inform me; I sent to make a search near the spot; but the bird could not be found, nor did it return till seven days after. I had been used to call him every evening with a whistle, which he answered not for six days; but, on the seventh, I heard a feeble cry at a distance, which I judged to be that of my buzzard: I repeated the whistle a second time, and I heard the same cry. I went to the part whence the sound came, and, at last, found my poor buzzard with his wing broken, which had travelled more than half a league on foot to regain his asylum, from which he was then distant about 120 paces. Though he was extremely reduced, he gave me many caresses. It took near six weeks till he was recruited, and his wounds healed; after which he began to fly as before, and follow his old habits for about a year: he then disappeared for ever. I am convinced that he was killed by accident; and that he would not have forsaken me from choice."</P>

In Asia, the pigeon is taught to carry letters between places an hundred leagues distant: and the art of falconry proves that, by directing the instinct of birds, they may be as much im∣proved as the other animals. On the whole, it appears that if man bestowed equal time and attention upon any animal as upon a child, it would acquire a mechanical imitation of the same actions; the effects only would differ. In
<PB N="71" REF="87"/>
the one case, reason extends and diffuses the attainments; in the other, they continue sta∣tionary, and perish with the possessor.</P>
<P>But that education which seems to unfold the faculties, and meliorate the dispositions of qua∣drupeds or birds, renders them odious to the rest of their species. When a buzzard, for instance, a magpie, or a jay, escapes to the woods, its savage kindred flock around it to gaze at the novelty. Their wonder is soon converted into rage; and they furiously attack and drive off the intruder: nor is it admitted into their society till it relinquishes its artificial habits, and adopts the manners of the tribe.</P>
<P>Birds are destined by nature to enjoy the completest independence, and exult in the most unbounded freedom. Other animals are con∣demned to crawl on the surface; these soar aloft
<PB N="72" REF="88"/>
in the air. No obstacle can oppose their pro∣gress; no spot can fix their residence: the sky is their country, and their course is on the wings of the breeze. They foresee the vicissi∣tude of the seasons, and watch their return. They generally appear when the mild influence of spring has clothed the forests with verdure; there they nestle, concealed under the foliage. Heaven and earth seem to conspire to their fe∣licity. But solicitude soon arises: they dread the cruel visits of the same animals on which they before looked down with contempt. The wild cat, the marten, the weazel, seek to de∣vour the objects of their tenderest affection: the adder clambers to gain their eggs, or devour their progeny: and children, that amiable por∣tion of human kind, but who, from want of em∣ployment, are ever in mischief, wantonly plun∣der the sacred deposits of love. Often the mo∣ther rushes into danger in defence of her young; and sacrifices to the ardor of her attachment, her love, her liberty, and her life.</P>
<P>Why is the season of the highest pleasures also the season of the greatest solicitude? Why are the most delicious enjoyments always damp∣ed, even in the freest and most innocent of be∣ings, by the cruellest anxieties? May we not complain of harshness in nature, the common mother of all? Her benevolence is never pure, or of long continuance. No sooner the hap∣py pair united, by choice and by their mu∣tual
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>
labours, have fabricated the mansion of love, than they dread the plunderer's attack. The feathered race has also its tyrants; and the ra∣pacious birds are the more formidable, as they are more independent. The eagle snatches with impunity the prey from the lion; all dread his aspect; the feebler birds scream at his approach, and seek immediate shelter. Per∣haps the eagle would have occupied a large por∣tion of the earth, if man had not driven him to the summits of mountains and inaccessible tracks, where in solitude he stretches out his gloomy dominion.</P>
<P>From this cursory view, it would appear that birds rank next to man in the great scale of ex∣istence. Nature has accumulated and concen∣trated more strength in their little bodies than she has communicated to the huge limbs of the most powerful quadrupeds; agility is combined with solidity; their empire extends over the in∣habitants of the air, the earth, and the waters. The whole of the insect tribes are exclusively subject to their dominion, and seem only des∣tined to feed these destroyers: they also seize the noxious reptiles on the ground, and snatch the fish from their element. They even at∣tack the quadrupeds; the buzzard sometimes darts on the fox, and the falcon stops the ante∣lope; the eagle preys on the sheep, murders the dog equally with the hare, and transports their carcases to his eyry. The birds walk on two
<PB N="74" REF="90"/>
feet, imitate speech, and repeat musical airs; in these respects too they resemble man, while their power of flying marks a decided superi∣ority above all the other terrestrial animals.</P>
<P>But from this general view of the nature of birds, let us descend to survey the genus of the Parrots. That tribe, the most numerous of all, affords striking illustrations of a new proposi∣tion: that, in birds, as in quadrupeds, those which inhabit the tropical regions are confined exclusively to their respective continents. This principle serves to fix their nomenclature; the species are much diversified and multiplied; above 100 are known, and yet of these not one is common to both continents. What can be a more decisive proof of this general proposition which we explained in the History of Quadru∣peds? The two continents were never joined, except towards the north, and therefore no ani∣mal incapable of supporting the intense cold of the frozen regions could migrate from the one into the other. Birds also, such as the Parrots, which live and propagate only in warm cli∣mates, have remained indigenous; some inha∣bit the tropical regions of the new continent, others those of the old, and occupy in each a zone extending twenty-five degrees on both sides of the equator.</P>
<P>But it will be said that if the elephants and other large quadrupeds, which at present are peculiar to Africa and India, inhabited origi∣nally
<PB N="75" REF="91"/>
the northern tracts in both continents, might not this have also been the case in regard to the Parrots? And as the earth gradually cooled, these might continually advance to∣wards the tropics; and neither the lofty moun∣tains, nor the narrow pass of the isthmus of Panama, could prevent their migration.</P>
<P>This objection, though plausible, is only a new question, which, in whatever way it be resolved, cannot affect our hypothesis, that the north was the primaeval residence of animals, and that they afterwards removed to the regions of the south. But those birds whose constitu∣tion is adapted to a hot climate could never rise to the frozen summits of mountains; and the cold that prevails in the elevated regions of the air would as effectually stop their flight, as the various obstacles to be surmounted would limit the progress of the elephant. Thus what appears at first an objection, is really a con∣firmation of the theory; since not only the quadrupeds, but also the birds, which are na∣tives of the torrid tracts in the old world, have never penetrated or settled in the insulated con∣tinent of South America. In the case of the birds, however, this principle has some excep∣tions; for a few species are found equally in the equatorial parts of both continents. But this is owing to particular circumstances; their vi∣gorous wings and their power of resting on the surface of the water by means of the broad mem∣branes
<PB N="76" REF="92"/>
of their feet. The Parrots can neither soar to a vast height, nor fly to a great distance, and their feet are not webbed. Accordingly, none of these have ever migrated from the one continent to the other, unless transported by men across the intervening ocean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Parrots have a laborious short flight, so that they cannot cross an arm of the sea seven or eight leagues broad. Each island of South America has its particular Parrots; those of St. Lucia, of St. Vincent, of Dominica, of Martinico, are different from each other: those of the Caribbee islands do not resemble them, nor are these Caribbee Parrots found near the Oronooco, which is the part of the continent nearest these islands. <HI>Note communicated by M. de la Borde, King's Physician at Cayenne.</HI></NOTE>.

And this facility of education seems to result from their superior understanding; they are more attentive and obedient than other Parrots, and they strive, though without success, to re∣peat what they hear. Their defects are com∣pensated by other expressions of feeling, and by affectionate caresses. All their motions have a gentleness and grace which adds new charms to their beauty.

<P>We saw this beautiful Cockatoo alive. It expresses joy by shaking its head briskly several times upwards and downwards, making a slight cracking with its bill, and displaying its elegant crest. It returns the caresses; touches the face with its tongue, and seems to lick it; the kisses are soft and gentle. When the one hand is laid flat under its body, and the other rests on its back, or only touches its bill, it presses firm∣ly, claps its wings, and with its bill half open it blows and pants, and seems to feel the most intoxicating delight. It repeats this as often as one chooses. It is also very fond of being scratched; holds its head, and raises its wing to be stroked: it often whets its bill, by gnaw∣ing and breaking bits of wood. It cannot bear the confinement of the cage, but it never roves out of its master's sight. It answers its call, and retires when he commands; in which case it discovers anxiety, often looking back for the sign of invitation.

Its plumage is entirely bluish black, which is deep∣er on the back and the wings than under the body; the crest is brown or blackish, and the bird has, like the other Cockatoos, the power of erecting it high, and of reclining it almost close on the head; the cheeks below the eye are covered by a red, naked, wrinkled skin, which covers the inferior mandible of the bill, whose colour, as well as that of the feet, is blackish brown; the eye is fine black. The bird may be reckoned the negro of the Cock∣atoos, which are generally white; the tail is long, and consists of tapered feathers. The fi∣gure delineated from nature was sent from Cey∣lon to Edwards, and that naturalist recognised the same bird in a collection published by <HI>Vander Meulen</HI> at Amsterdam, in 1707, and termed by <HI>Peter Schenk</HI> the <HI>Indian Crow.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Aterrimus:</HI> "It is black, its crest large and lighter coloured, its cheeks red and naked."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The PARROTS PROPERLY SO CALLED.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall apply the name of Parrot to those of the old continent whose tail is short, and consists of quills nearly equal in length. We may reckon eight species, all natives of Africa or India, and none of them found in America.</P>

<P>THIS species is now the most commonly brought into Europe, and generally pre∣ferred, as well on account of the mildness of its disposition, as of its sagacity and docility, in which it at least equals the green Parrot, with∣out the disagreeable cries. It seems to pronounce the word <HI>Jaco,</HI> and hence its usual appellation. All the body is of a fine pearl and slaty gray, which is deeper on the upper surface, lighter on the lower, and inclined to white on the
<PB N="89" REF="106"/>
belly. The tail, which is vermilion, termi∣nates and heightens this plumage, which is glossed and powdered with a snowy colour, that gives it constantly a fresh appearance. The eye is placed in a white, naked, mealy skin, that covers the check; the bill is black; the feet gray; and the iris gold colour. The total length of the bird is a foot.</P>
<P>Most of these Parrots are imported from the coast of Guinea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, and come from the interior parts of Africa <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"They are found on the whole of this coast (of Guinea), but in small numbers, and most of them even come from the interior parts of the country. Those of Benin, of Calbari, of Cabolopez, are most esteemed, for which reason they are brought from those places; but they are much older than such as can be obtained here, and consequently are not so docile, nor so easily trained. All the Parrots here on the coast, and also near the angle of Guinea, and in the above-mentioned places, are of a blue colour... These birds are so common in Holland, that they are less esteemed there than here, and not sold so dear." <HI>Voyage en Guinée,</HI> par Bosman, <HI>Utrecht,</HI> 1705.—Albin is mistaken when he says that this species comes from the East Indies; it appears confined to Africa, and <HI>à fortiori</HI> it occurs not in America, though Brisson places it at Jamaica, pro∣bably from the indication of Browne and Sloane; but without hav∣ing consulted them, since Sloane (Jamaica, <HI>Vol. II. p.</HI> 297) says expressly that the Parrots, which are numerous in Jamaica, were all brought thither from Guinea.

It has indeed been remarked by the older writers <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Albertus, <HI>Lib. XXIII.</HI></NOTE> that the birds most susceptible of imitating the human voice are eager to listen to children, whose articula∣tion is imperfect and unequal, and therefore more correspondent to their own. But the ci∣nereous Parrot copies also the deep tones of the adult; though the effort is laborious, and the words are less distinct. One of these Guinea Parrots was so completely drilled by an old sailor, that it acquired exactly his hoarse voice and cough; and though it was afterwards given to a young person, and was in no other com∣pany, it never forgot the lessons of its first master, and it was diverting to observe its tran∣sitions from a soft gracious tone to its former hoarseness and coarse sea tones.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="108"/>
But not only has this bird a facility, it has also an eagerness, in imitating the human voice. It listens with attention, and strives to repeat; it dwells constantly on some syllables which it has heard, and seeks to surpass every voice by the loudness of its own. We are often sur∣prised at its repeating words or sounds, which we never taught it, and which we should not suppose it to have noticed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Witness that Parrot of Henry VIII. which, as Aldrovandus relates, having fallen into the Thames, called to the boatmen for assistance, as it had heard the passengers call from the beach.</NOTE>. It seems to set itself tasks, and tries every day to retain its les∣son <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cardan goes so far as to ascribe to it meditation and inward reflection on what it has been taught, and this, says he, through emulation and the love of glory.. <HI>Meditatur ob fludium gloriae...</HI> The love of the marvellous must have had mighty influence upon this philosopher, to make him advance such absurdities.</NOTE>. This engages its attention even in sleep, and, according to Marcgrave, it prattles in its dreams <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aristotle had proposed a quaere, whether animals hatched from eggs ever dream <HI>(Lib. V.</HI> 10. <HI>Hist. Anim.)</HI> Marcgrave an∣swers, that "his Parrot Laura often rose in the night, and prattled half asleep."</NOTE>. They are most capable of improve∣ment when young; then they shew more sa∣gacity, more docility: and their memory, if early cultivated, becomes sometimes astonish∣ing. Rhodiginus <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. III.</HI> 32.</NOTE> mentions a Parrot which a Cardinal purchased for 100 crowns, because it <HI>recited correctly the Apostles' Creed</HI> <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">M. de la Borde tells us that he saw one, which served as al∣moner on board a vessel; it recited the sailors prayer, then the rosary.</NOTE>. But when
<PB N="92" REF="109"/>
it grows older, it becomes stubborn, and will hardly be taught. Olina recommends the evening, after their meal, as the proper time to instruct them; for their wants being satis∣fied, they are most docile and attentive.</P>
<P>The education of the Parrot has been com∣pared to that of the child <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aelian.</NOTE>. At Rome, the person who trained a Parrot held in his hand a small rod, with which he struck it on the head. Pliny says that its skull is very hard, and that it requires smart blows to make it feel <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>Lib. X.</HI> 42.</NOTE>. How∣ever, the bird which we mentioned feared the rod more than a child that has been often whip∣ped. If after remaining perched the whole day, it anticipated the hour of walking out into the garden, and descended too soon (which seldom happened), threats and the sight of the rod drove it with precipitation to its roost; there it continued, but showed its impatience by flap∣ping its wings and screaming.</P>
<P>"We should suppose that the Parrot does not perceive when he speaks himself, but fancies that some person addresses him. He often asked his paw, and answered by holding up the paw. Though he liked to hear the voice of children, he seemed to have an antipathy to them; he pursued and bit them till he drew blood. He had also his objects of attachment, and though his choice was not very nice, it was constant.
<PB N="93" REF="110"/>
He was excessively fond of the cook-maid; fol∣lowed her every where, sought for her, and seldom missed finding her. If she had been some time out of his sight, the bird climbed with his bill and claws to her shoulders, lavish∣ed his caresses, and would, on no account, leave her. His fondness had all the marks of close and warm friendship. The girl happened to have a very fore finger, which was tedious in healing, and so painful as to make her scream. While she uttered her moans, the Parrot never left her chamber. The first thing he did every day was to pay her a visit; and this tender condolence lasted the whole time of the cure, and he again returned to his former calm settled attachment. Yet this strong pre∣dilection for the girl seems to have been more directed to her office in the kitchen, than her person; for when another cook-maid succeeded to her, the Parrot shewed the same degree of fondness the very first day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by Madame Nadault, my sister, to whom this Parrot belonged.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>But Parrots of this kind not only imitate discourse; they also mimic gestures and ac∣tions. Scaliger saw one that performed the dance of the Savoyards, at the same time re∣peating their song. The one already mentioned liked to hear a person sing, and, when he saw him dance, he also tried to caper, but with the worst grace imaginable, holding in his toes, and
<PB N="94" REF="111"/>
tumbling back clumsily. He was then the most cheerful; but he had also an extravagant joy, and an incessant prattling when in the state of intoxication: for all Parrots love wine, particularly the Spanish and the muscadine. Even in the time of Pliny it was remarked that the sumes of that liquor gave the Parrots a flow of spirits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In vino praecipue lasciva.</HI> Lib. X. 42.</NOTE>. He crept near the fire in winter, and his greatest pleasure, in that season, was to get on the chimney; and when warmed he gave many signs of his comfortable feelings. He had equal pleasure in the summer showers; he continued whole hours exposed, and spread his wings the better to receive the rain, and did not seek for cover till he was wet to the skin. After he had returned to his roost, he stripped all the feathers one after another through his bill. If the weather was dry, he liked to bathe in a cistern of water, and entered into it repeatedly, though always very careful not to wet his head. But he was as averse to plunge in winter; and if then shewn a vessel full of water, he would run off, and even scream.</P>
<P>Sometimes he was observed to yawn, and this was almost always the symptom of weari∣ness. He whistled with more force and clear∣ness than a man; but, though he expressed many tones, he could never be taught to copy an air. He imitated perfectly the cries of wild
<PB N="95" REF="112"/>
and domestic animals, particularly the crow, which he mimicked so well, that he might have been taken for one. He seldom prattled in a room with company; but if alone in the adjacent room, he was noisy in proportion to the loudness of the conversation which he over∣heard; he seemed prompted to repeat precipi∣tately all that he had learnt, and was never so animated or so clamorous. In the evening he retired of his own accord to his cage, which he shunned during the day: there with one foot concealed in the plumage, or hooked to the bars of the cage, and his head beneath his wings, he slept until he perceived the dawn of the morn∣ing; but he often wakened to the blaze of can∣dles. Then he stepped down to the bottom of the cage, and sharpened his claws, using the same motion with the scratching of a hen. Sometimes he whistled or prattled in the night when exposed to light; but in the dark he was silent and tranquil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rest of the note communicated by Madame Nadault.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That sort of society which the Parrot forms with man, is, by means of language, more inti∣mate and pleasing than what the monkey can claim from its antic imitation of our gestures and actions. If the useful and amiable qualities of the dog, the horse, or the elephant, command our attention and esteem, the singular talents of the
<PB N="96" REF="113"/>
prattling bird sometimes engage more power∣fully our curiosity. It diverts and amuses; in solitude it is company; it takes part in conver∣sation, it laughs, it breathes tender expressions, or mimics grave discourse; and its words ut∣tered indiscriminately please by their incongru∣ity, and sometimes excite surprise by their apt∣ness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby speaks from Clusius of a Parrot, which, when a person said to it, <HI>Laugh, Poll, laugh,</HI> laughed accordingly, and the instant after screamed out, <HI>What a fool to make me laugh!</HI> We have seen another which grew old with its master, and shared with him the infirmities of age. Being accustomed to hear scarce any thing but the words <HI>I am sick</HI> (Je suis malade); when a person asked it, <HI>How d'ye, Poll, how d'ye</HI> (Qu'as-tu, perroquet, qu'as∣tu)? <HI>I am sick,</HI> it replied with a doleful tone, stretching itself over the fire, <HI>I am sick</HI> (Je suis malade).</NOTE>. This play of language without mean∣ing is uncommonly whimsical, and though not more empty than much other talk, it is always more amusing. The Parrot seems also to re∣ceive a tincture of our inclinations and manners; it loves, or it hates; it has particular attach∣ments, predilections, and caprices; it is the object of its own admiration and applause; it becomes joyous or sad; it is melted by caresses, and bills tenderly in return: in a house of mourning, it learns to moan <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See,</HI> in the Annals of Constantine Manasses, the story of the young Prince Leo, son of the Emperor Basil, condemned to death by his implacable father, whom the cries of the persons around him could not move, till the accents of the bird, which had learnt to deplore the fate of the Prince, at last stung his barbarous heart.</NOTE>, and often ac∣customed to repeat the dear name of a mistress
<PB N="97" REF="114"/>
whose loss is bewailed, it awakens, in feeling hearts, the memory of past joys <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See,</HI> in Aldrovandus (p. 662), a pleasing and affecting piece, which a poet, who grieves for his mistress, addresses to his Parrot, that incessantly repeats her name.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The power of imitating exactly articulate dis∣course implies in the Parrot a peculiar and more perfect structure of organ; and the accuracy of its memory, though independent of the under∣standing, manifests a closeness of attention and a strength of mechanical recollection that no bird posses in so high a degree. Accordingly, all the naturalists have remarked the singular form of its bill, its tongue, and its head: its bill, round on the outside and hollow within, has, in some measure, the capacity of a mouth, and allows the tongue to play freely; and the sound, striking against the circular border of the lower mandible, is there modified as on a row of teeth, while the concavity of the upper mandible re∣flects it like the palate; and hence it does not utter a whistling, but a full, articulation. The tongue, which modulates all the sounds, is pro∣portionally larger than in man, and would be more voluble, were it not harder than flesh, and invested with a strong horny membrane.</P>
<P>But this organization, though adjusted with skill, is still inferior to the structure contrived to give an easy and powerful motion to the up∣per mandible, and, at the same time, not to hinder its opening. The muscles are not fixed
<PB N="98" REF="115"/>
to the root, where they would have exerted no force; nor to the sides, where they would have closed the aperture. Nature has adopted a dif∣ferent plan; at the bottom of the bill are fixed two bones, which, extending on both sides, and under the cheeks, form a continuation of it, similar in form to the <HI>pterygoid</HI> bones in man, except that their hinder extremity is not con∣creted into another bone, but loose. Thick layers of muscles, sent off from the back of the head, and inserted in these bones, move them and the bill. For a fuller description of this singular contrivance, I shall refer to Aldrovan∣dus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tom. I. pp.</HI> 640 <HI>and</HI> 641.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This naturalist properly observes, that, be∣tween the eye and the lower jaw, there is a space, which deserves better the name of cheek than in any other bird; it is also more protu∣berant, occasioned by the number of muscles that extend over it to the bill.</P>
<P>The bill is very strong; the Parrot easily cracks the nuts of the red fruits; it gnaws the wood, and even bends or wrenches the bars of its cage, if they be slender, or if it be tired of confinement. It uses its bill, oftener than its claws, in climbing and suspending itself; it also holds by the bill in descending, as if it were a third foot, which steadies its motion; it also serves to break its fall <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>Lib. X.</HI> 42.</NOTE>. It is a second organ
<PB N="99" REF="116"/>
of touch, and is equally useful with its toes, in scrambling and clenching.</P>
<P>The mobility of its upper mandible gives it a power which no other birds have, of chewing its food. In those, whether of the granivorous or carnivorous tribes, the bill is like a hand which throws the food into the gizzard, or an arm which splits or tears it. The Parrot seizes the piece sideways, and gnaws deliberately <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We must remark that the external hind toe is moveable, and that the bird draws it sidewise and forward, to seize and handle what is given to it; but only in this single case does it use that power, and at other times, whether it walks or perches, it con∣stantly carries two toes before and two behind. Apuleius and So∣linus speak of Parrots with five toes; but this was owing to their mistaking a passage of Pliny, where that naturalist ascribes that uncommon property to a family of magpies <HI>(Lib. X.</HI> 42.)</NOTE>. The lower mandible has little motion, but that from right to left is most perceptible; and this is often performed when the bird is not eating, which has made it be supposed to ruminate. In such cases it probably only whets the edge of this mandible, with which it cuts and bites its aliments.</P>
<P>The Parrot discovers hardly any choice in its food: it lives in its native country on almost every sort of fruit or grain. The seeds of the bastard saffron <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carthanius Carduncellus,</HI> Linn.</NOTE> have been found to fatten it, though they act on man as a violent purge <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Spaniards call this seed <HI>Same de Papagey,</HI> Parrot-seed.</NOTE>. In the domestic state, it eats whatever is pre∣sented;
<PB N="100" REF="117"/>
but flesh, which it would rather prefer, is extremely hurtful to it, and occasions an un∣natural longing, which prompts it to suck and gnaw its feathers, and pluck them one by one from every part that its bill can reach. This cinereous Guinea Parrot is particularly subject to that disease; it tears the feathers from its body, and even from its beautiful tail, which never afterwards recovers the same bright red as at first.</P>
<P>Sometimes after moulting this Parrot is ob∣served to become marbled with white and rose colour; occasioned either by some distemper, or by advanced age.</P>
<P>What Brisson reckons as varieties, under the names of the <HI>Red-winged Guinea Parrot,</HI> and the <HI>Red variegated Guinea Parrot,</HI> are owing to such accidental changes of plumage. In the one figured by Edwards, the red feathers are mingled at random with the gray, as if the bird had been dressed out <HI>(tapired).</HI> The cinereous Parrot is like others of the genus, subject to the epilepsy and the cramp <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina. <HI>Occelleria, p.</HI> 23.</NOTE>; yet is it very hardy and lives to a great age <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"I knew one at the Cape of St. Domingo, which was averred to be forty-six years old." <HI>Note communicated by M. de la Borde.</HI></NOTE>.

It is uncommon for Parrots to propagate in our temperate climates; but they frequently lay addle eggs. There are some instances, however, of Parrots being reared in France. M. de le Pigeoniere had a cock and hen in the town of Marmande in Agenois, which hatched regularly each spring for five or six years, and the young Parrots lived, and were educated by the parents. Each hatch con∣sisted of four eggs, three of which succeed∣ed. The birds were shut in a room with no∣thing but a barrel open at top and filled with saw dust; sticks were fastened both on the outside and inside, that the male might scram∣ble upwards and downwards, and sit beside the hen. In entering the room it was necessary to have boots; for the male, fired by jealousy, bit furiously whatever he perceived to approach his female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter dated from <HI>Marmande en Agenois,</HI> 25th August, 1774.</NOTE>.

<P>These Parrots are frequent in Senegal; they fly in small flocks of five or six, and perch on the straggling trees in the burning, sandy plains of that country, and utter a shrill, dis∣agreeable cry.

<HEAD>The LORIS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS name has been applied in the East In∣dies to a family of Parrots whose cry re∣sembles the sound of the word <HI>lori.</HI> They are hardly distinguished from the rest of the genus, except by their plumage, which is chiefly red, and of various intensity. Their bill is also small∣er, not so much hooked, but sharper than that of the other Parrots. Their aspect is lively, their voice shrill, and their motions quick. They are, according to Edwards, the most nimble of all the Parrots, and the only ones that can leap to the height of a foot. These well ascertained facts confute the assertion of a traveller, that they brood in silent melan∣choly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy.</HI> t. X. p. 459.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are taught with great ease to whistle and articulate words; they soon grow tame, and, what is uncommon in all animals, they retain their cheerfulness in captivity. But they are in general very delicate, and difficult to trans∣port; and, in our temperate climates, they are short lived. Even in their native regions, they are subject to epileptic fits, like the maccaws and other Parrots; yet it is probable that this disorder attacks only the domesticated birds.</P>

"Ornithologists have improperly," says Son∣nerat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage a la Nouvelle Guinee, p.</HI> 173.</NOTE>, "discriminated the Loris by the epi∣thets of the <HI>Philippine,</HI> the <HI>East Indian,</HI> the <HI>Chinese,</HI> &amp;c. These birds inhabit only the Moluccas and New Guinea, and those found in other parts have been carried thither." But these nomenclators are guilty of a greater im∣propriety in reckoning some species of Loris as natives of America, since none exist there: and, if travellers have seen a few individuals, they must have been introduced from the Asi∣atic islands.</P>
<P>Sonnerat adds too, that he constantly found the Loris in one island to be of a different spe∣cies from those in another, though at a short distance only. A similar observation has been made in regard to the islands of the West In∣dies.</P>

<P>SO far is this Parrakeet from being peculiar to the new world, as Brisson represents it, that it is there entirely unknown. It inhabits many parts of Africa, and is brought in great num∣bers to Cairo by the caravans of Ethiopia. The vessels that sail from Senegal or Guinea, where it is common, carry it with the negroes into the West India islands. None of these Parrakeets are found on the continent of America; they are only seen near the settlements of St. Do∣mingo, Martinico, Guadeloupe, &amp;c. which the African vessels perpetually frequent, but at Cay∣enne, where negroes are very seldom imported, they never occur. All these facts, which were communicated by an excellent observer, prove that the Rose-ringed Parrakeet is not a native
<PB N="135" REF="155"/>
of the new world. But it is still more singular that Brisson should consider the same bird as the Parrot of the ancients; as if the Greeks and Romans went to America to find it. Besides, it is a different species, which we have already described.</P>
<P>The Rose-ringed Parrakeet is fourteen inches long, but of this extent the tail and its two pro∣jecting feathers occupy near two thirds; these feathers are of a beryl blue; all the rest of the plumage is a light soft green, which is rather more vivid on the quills of the wings and mix∣ed with yellow on those of the tail; a small rose collar clasps the back of the neck and joints with the black of the throat; a bluish tinge ap∣pears on the feathers of the nape of the neck, which recline upon the collar; the bill is brown red.</P>

<P>THE bird, which Brisson has termed the <HI>Mo∣lucca Maccaw,</HI> is undoubtedly only a Par∣rakeet; for no Maccaw inhabits either India, or any part of the ancient continent. Seba calls the same bird a <HI>Lory;</HI> but the long fea∣thers of its tail shew evidently that it is a Par∣rakeet. The total length of the bird is four∣teen inches, of which the tail is near seven. The head has a black band, and the neck a red and green collar; the breast is of a fine light red; the wings and back are of a rich Turkey∣blue; the belly is deep green, sprinkled with red feathers; the tail, of which the middle quills are the largest, is coloured with green and red, with black edges. This Parrakeet was, according to Seba, brought from the Pa∣puan islands; a Dutch settler at Amboyna pur∣chased it of an Indian for five hundred florins. This price was not extravagant, considering the beauty and gentleness of the bird; it pronounc∣ed distinctly several words in different languages, it made its salute in the morning, and sung its

Willughby observes even that both the figure and its de∣scription appeared suspicious. The plumage is composed of green, red, and a little blue; the first of these colours is spread on the upper side of the body, the second on the under side and the tail, except the two long shafts, which are green, and the blue that tinges the shoulders and the quills of the wings: there are two spots of the same colour on each side of the eye.</P>

<P>THIS is the <HI>small Parrot of Bontius,</HI> whose lustre and variety of plumage are extolled by Willugh by; the pencil can hardly imitate, he says, its brilliancy and beauty. It is com∣posed of bright red, and of rose colour, mixed with yellow and green on the wings, and with green and blue on the tail, which is very long, and projects beyond the wings ten inches; a re∣markable excess in a bird which is not larger than a lark. The feathers on its head form a crest, which must be very elegant, since it is compared to a peacock's tuft in the following extract, which seems to allude to this beautiful species. "This Parrakeet is about the bulk of a siskin; on its head is a tuft of three or four feathers, resembling that of the peacock. This bird is exceedingly gentle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres Edifiantes, <HI>second recueil, p.</HI> 69.</NOTE>." These little Parrakeets are found in Java, in the interior parts of the country.

<HEAD>THE SHORT-TAILED PARRAKEETS OF THE OLD CONTINENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are frequent in the south of Asia, and in Africa. They are entirely dif∣ferent from the Parrakeets of America, except a few which were probably carried thither. The species of Parrakeets that inhabit the old continent are much more numerous than those of the new: their habits are also different; some, for instance, cling to a small branch, and sleep with their head hanging downwards, which is not remarked of those settled in America.</P>
<P>In general, the Parrots of the new world make their nests in the hollows of trees, parti∣cularly those deserted by the woodpeckers, which are called <HI>carpenters</HI> in the West India islands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lery positively avers that the American Parrots never suspend their nests, but make them in cavities of trees. <HI>Apud Clusium Auct. p.</HI> 364.</NOTE>.

flame coloured mask, mixed with a blush tint, which covers the forehead, encloses the eye, and descends under the throat, and, in the mid∣dle of it, the bill appears of a reddish white; the tail is very short, and appears all green when closed, but if displayed it is perceived to be in∣tersected transversely with three bars, the one red, the other black, and the third green, which borders and terminates the extremity; the pi∣nions of the wings are blue in the male, and yellow in the female, which differs not from the former, except that its head is of a fainter red.</P>

<P>THIS species comes likewise from the isle of Luçon, and Sonnerat thus describes it. "It is rather smaller than the preceding; the upper side of the neck, the back, the small fea∣thers of the wings and of the tail, are of a deep green; the belly is light green and yellowish; the crown of the head is a very bright red in the male, and the feathers, which border the

<HEAD>PARROTS OF THE NEW CONTINENT.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ARAS.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Parrots, the Ara is the largest, and the most magnificently decked; purple, gold, and azure, blaze on its plumage; its aspect is steady and composed; its deportment grave, and even supercilious, and as if conscious of its beauty. But its calm temper soon renders it familiar, and even susceptible of a degree of at∣tachment. It may be domesticated without be∣ing enslaved; it never abuses the liberty which has been granted to it; it contracts a fondness for the family where it is adopted, and con∣stantly returns from its rambling.</P>
<P>All these Aras are natives of the tropical parts of the new world, and inhabit both the conti∣nent and the islands; but none are found in Africa, or in India. Christopher Columbus, in his second voyage, touched at Guadeloupe, and there saw Aras, which he named <HI>Guacamayas</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, <HI>Lib. II. cap.</HI> 10.</NOTE>. They occur even in the desert islands, and every∣where
<PB N="157" REF="178"/>
constitute the finest ornament of those gloomy forests with which the wild luxuriancy of nature clothes the face of the earth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"While Commodore Anson and his officers were contemplat∣ing the natural beauties of this solitude, a flook of Aras flew over their heads; and as if these birds wished to improve the entertain∣ment, and heighten the magnificence of the spectacle, they stopped to make numberless circles in the air, which allowed time to ob∣serve the Iustre and brilliancy of their plumage. Those who wit∣nessed this scene cannot describe it without raptures." <HI>Anson's Voy∣age round the World.—</HI>"It is the finest sight in the world, to be∣hold ten or twelve Aras on a very green tree; never are more charming colours displayed." Dutertre. <HI>Hist. des Antilles, t. II. p.</HI> 247.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When these Parrots were introduced into Europe, they were beheld with admiration. Aldrovandus, who, for the first time, saw an Ara at Mantua in 1572, remarks that they were then quite novelties, and highly esteemed; and that princes received these birds from one another as rare and valuable presents. Even Belon, that curious observer, had never seen a maccaw, for he says that the gray Parrots are the largest of all.</P>
<P>We know four species of Aras, viz. the red, the blue, the green, and the black. Our no∣menclators enumerate six <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brisson.</NOTE>, but which ought to be reduced to one half, as we shall afterwards find.</P>
<P>The characters which distinguish the Aras from the other Parrots of the new world are, 1. their size, which is at least double that of the others; 2. the length of the tail, which is
<PB N="158" REF="179"/>
also much longer even in proportion to the bo∣dy; 3. the naked and dirty white skin, which covers both sides of the head, surrounds it be∣low, and covers also the base of the lower man∣dible. This naked skin, in which the eyes are placed, gives them a disagreeable aspect. Their voice is harsh; they seem to articulate only the sound <HI>ara,</HI> and with a raucous, thick tone, which is grating to the ear.</P>

<P>ALL the nomenclators have followed Gesner and Aldrovandus in ranging the Red Aras in two species. But, on the other hand, Marc∣grave, and all the travellers, who have had an opportunity of viewing and comparing the birds, consider them as belonging to the same family. They inhabit only the warm climates of Ame∣rica, the Antilles, Mexico, the isthmus of Pa∣nama,
<PB N="159" REF="180"/>
Peru, Guiana, Brazil, &amp;c. and are found in no part of the old continent. It is strange, therefore, that some authors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albin and Willughby.</NOTE> have copied Al∣bin in calling them <HI>Macao Parrots,</HI> and have imagined that they came from Japan. Some may have been carried thither from America, but they are undoubtedly not natives of Japan, and it is probable that these authors have confounded the great Red Lory of the East Indies with the Red Ara of the West Indies.</P>
<P>The great Red Ara is near thirty inches in length, but of this the tail occupies almost the one half; all the body, except the wings, is vermilion, the four longest feathers of the tail are the same; the great quills of the wing are Turkey-blue above, and copper-coloured on a black ground beneath; in the middle quills the blue and green are admirably melted into each other; the great coverts are gold-yellow, and terminated with green; the shoulders are of the same red with the back; the superior and infe∣rior coverts of the tail are blue; four of the la∣teral quills, on each side, are blue above, and the whole under surface copper-colour, which is lighter and has more of the metallic gloss un∣der the four great middle quills: a tuft of snuff-coloured velvet feathers projects, like a cushion, on the forehead; the throat is brown-red; a white and naked membranous skin encircles the eye,
<PB N="160" REF="181"/>
covers the cheek, and sheathes the lower man∣dible, which is blackish, and so are the legs. This description was made from a living bird, and one of the largest and most beautiful.—Travellers remark differences both in regard to colour and size, according to the different coun∣tries, or even islands, from which they are brought <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"These birds are so dissimilar according to the grounds where they procure their food, that every island has its Parrots, its Aras, and its Parroquets, different in size of body, in tone of voice, and in the tints of the plumage." Dutertre, <HI>Hist. des Antilles.</HI> Paris, 1667, t. II. p. 247.—"The Aras are birds of extreme beauty: they have a long tail, which is composed of charming feathers of different colours, according to the islands which have given them birth." <HI>Hist. Nat. &amp; Morale des Antilles. Rotterdam,</HI> 1658, <HI>p.</HI> 134.</NOTE>. We have seen some in which the tail was entirely blue, others in which it was red, and terminated with blue. Their bulk is as various; but the little Red Aras are more rare than the large ones.</P>
<P>In general, the Aras were formerly very common in St. Domingo. I see from a letter of the Chevalier Deshayes that, since the French have extended their settlements to the summits of the mountains, these birds are become less frequent <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"In all these islands (the Antilles) the Aras have become very rare, because the inhabitants kill them for eating. They re∣tire to the least frequented places, and are no more observed to approach the plantations." <HI>Observations of M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne.</HI></NOTE>. Both the Red and Blue Aras in∣habit the same climates, and their habits and economy are exactly the same; and what we
<PB N="161" REF="182"/>
shall now relate, in regard to the one, will equally apply to the other.</P>
<P>Aras live in the woods that cover the swampy grounds, where the palm trees abound, and they feed chiefly on the dates of the palmettoes, of which there are immense forests in the over∣flowed savannahs. They generally appear in pairs, seldom in flocks; sometimes, however, they assemble together, and their united screams are heard at a great distance. When any thing scares or surprises them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Indians were in profound security (at Yubarco, in Da∣rien), when the cries of a sort of red Parrots of extraordinary size, which they call <HI>guacamayas,</HI> gave them notice of the approach of their enemies." <HI>Expedition of Ojeda,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. t. XII. p.</HI> 156.</NOTE>, they vent the same screams, and while on the wing they cry in∣cessantly. Of all the Parrots, they fly the best; they traverse the cleared lands, but never alight; they perch on the summit of trees, or on the highest branch. During the day, they roam to a distance not exceeding a league in search of ripe fruits, but always return in the evening to the same spot. Dutertre <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Antilles, <HI>t. II. p.</HI> 248.</NOTE> says that they are sometimes compelled by hunger to eat the ap∣ples of the manchineel, which is poisonous to man, and probably to most animals; he adds that the flesh of such birds is unwholesome, and even envenomed. Yet the Aras are commonly eaten in Guiana, Brazil, &amp;c. without any bad
<PB N="162" REF="183"/>
consequences; whether it be that the manchi∣neel does not grow in those countries, or that the Aras, finding abundance of their proper food, shun the food of that poisonous tree.</P>
<P>It appears that the Parrots of the new world had nearly the same dispositions with all those animals which inhabit desert tracts; they were familiar, unsuspecting, and fearless of the ap∣proach of men, who in those regions were feebly armed and few in number, and never could dis∣play their dominion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The small birds which inhabited the woods of New Zea∣land were so little acquainted with men, that they calmly roosted on the branches of trees next us, even on the end of our muskets. We were new objects to them, which they regarded with a cu∣riosity equal to our own." <HI>Forster's Relation of Captain Cook's second Voyage.</HI></NOTE>. Peter of Angleria <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. X. dec.</HI> 3.</NOTE> as∣sures us, that, on the discovery of America, the Parrots were caught with the noose, and almost by the hand of the sportsman; that they were seldom scared by the noise of fire arms, and did not take to flight when they saw their compa∣nions drop dead; that they preferred the trees planted near houses to the solitude of forests; and though the Indians caught them three or four times a year, to strip them of their rich plumage, this violence did not drive them from their favourite haunts <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lery, <HI>p.</HI> 174.</NOTE>. Hence Aldrovandus, who drew his information from the early ac∣counts of America, says that these birds are na∣turally attached to man, or, at least, shew no
<PB N="163" REF="184"/>
symptoms of fear in his presence; that they follow the Indians into their huts, and seem to contract an affection to the spots inhabited by these peaceful men. A part of this confidence and security adheres to the Parrots which have retired to the forests. M. de la Borde informs us that this is the case with those settled in Gui∣ana; they allow one to approach very near them without betraying suspicion or fear. And Piso says of the Brazilian birds, what may be applied to all those of the new world, that they are in∣cautious, and easily decoyed into every kind of snare.</P>
<P>The Aras make their nests in the holes of old rotten trees, which are very common in their native regions, and more numerous even than the rising vigorous plants: they enlarge the aperture, when it is too narrow, and line the inside with feathers. They have two hatches annually, like all the other American Parrots, and each consists of two eggs, which, accord∣ing to Dutertre, are as large as pigeons' eggs, and spotted like those of partridges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It often happens that an Ara will lay an egg or two in our temperate climates; Aldrovandus cites some instances. M. le Mar∣quis d'Abzac has informed us that a large Red Ara of his laid three eggs; they had no germ: however, as the bird was ardent and clamorous to cover, a hen's egg was given to her, which she hatched." <HI>Letter of M. le Marquis d'Abzac, dated from the Castle of Noyac, near Perigueux,</HI> 21 <HI>September,</HI> 1776.</NOTE>. He adds that the young ones have two small worms in their nostrils, and a third on a small ball which
<PB N="164" REF="185"/>
gathers above the head; and that these little worms die when the birds begin to be fledged <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Antilles, <HI>t. II. p.</HI> 249.</NOTE>. Such worms in the nostrils are not peculiar to the Aras; the other Parrots, the cassiques, and many other birds, are subject to them when in the nest: many quadrupeds also, the monkeys in particular, have worms in the nose, and in other parts of the body. These insects are well known in America, and in the French settle∣ments are called <HI>macaques worms.</HI> They creep into the flesh, and occasion dangerous abscesses both in men and the other animals; horses sometimes die of such disorders, owing to their negligent treatment in those countries, where they are never stabled nor dressed.</P>
<P>The male and female Aras sit alternately on their eggs, or cherish their young, and both equally carry food; they never desert the charge as long as their assistance is needed, and always perch together near the nest.</P>
<P>The young Aras are easily tamed, and, in ma∣ny parts of America, these birds are never taken but in the nests, because the adults are too dif∣ficult to educate. Yet Dutertre relates, that the Carribs had a singular way of catching them alive; they observed when the Aras were on the ground, eating fallen fruit; they endea∣voured to surround them, and on a sudden hal∣looed, clapt their hands, and made so great a
<PB N="165" REF="186"/>
noise, that the birds, in the moment of surprise, lost the use of their wings, and turned on their back to defend themselves with their bill and nails; the savages then held out a stick, on which they clenched, and were immediately tied by a small string. He also pretends that they could be tamed, though old, and caught in this violent way. But this account appears rather suspicious; particularly, as all the Aras in fact fly from man, a loud noise must have a greater effect in driving them away. Wafer says that the Indians who inhabit the isthmus tame the Aras as we do magpies, and allow them to make excursions into the woods during the day, but that they constantly return home in the evening; that they imitate their master's voice, and the song of a bird called <HI>chicali</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wafer, in Dampier's Voyage.</NOTE>. Fernandez relates that they can be taught to speak, but that their articulation is coarse and dis∣agreeable; that when they are kept in the house, they rear their young like other domestic birds. It is certain, that they never prattle so well as the other Parrots; and after they are tamed, they never try to escape.</P>
<P>The Indians work the plumage into festival caps, and other ornaments; they also stick some of the rich feathers into the cheek, and through the nostrils, or the ears. The flesh of the Aras, though commonly hard and black, is not un∣pleasant
<PB N="166" REF="187"/>
food, and makes excellent soup; and, in general, the Parrots are usually eaten as the most plentiful game in the settlement at Cay∣enne.</P>
<P>The Ara is, more than any bird perhaps, sub∣ject to the cramp, which is more violent, and more quickly mortal, in the hot countries, than in the temperate climates. I kept one of the largest and handsomest of the kind, which was given to me by the Marchioness of Pompadour in 1751. It was seized with an epilepsy two or three times every month, and yet it lived se∣veral years at my seat in Burgundy, and might have lived much longer, if it had not been kill∣ed. But in South America, these birds com∣monly die of the falling sickness, and this is also the fate of all the other Parrots, which are equally subject to that disorder, in the domestic state. Perhaps the cause which we assigned in treating of the canary finches, obtains here, viz. the separation from the female, and the super∣abundance of nutrition. The Indians, who rear the Aras in their huts with the view to sell their feathers, have a remedy for the epilepsy; they cut the point of the toe, and the discharge of a single drop of blood works an immediate cure. The same operation succeeds equally in procur∣ing relief to the other disorders incident to the domestic state. I have formerly remarked that the canaries die when the blood does not form a drop at the bill. Nature seems to point out
<PB N="167" REF="188"/>
the same remedy which the Indians have disco∣vered.</P>
<P>This epilepsy, or cramp, as it is called in the colonies, invariably happens to domesticated Parrots when they perch on a bit of iron, such as a nail, a curtain rod, &amp;c.; so that great care is taken that they alight only on wood. This fact seems to shew that the fit, which is a vio∣lent convulsion of the nerves, is analogous to electricity, whose action, it is well known, is more violent when transmitted through iron than through wood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This analogy seems to be rather fanciful. The effect must be referred to the irritability of the muscular fibres, excited by the sharpness or asperity of the touching substance, and by the sudden cold shot through the bird's toes by the contact of metals, which is a rapid conductor of heat.

<P>It is easy to describe the Blue Ara: the up∣per side of the body, the wings, and the tail, are entirely azure, and the under side of the body is fine yellow <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The other called <HI>Canidé,</HI> having all the plumage under its belly and round its neck as yellow as fine gold; the upper side of the back, the wings, and the tail, are of the purest blue: you would say that it is attired below with a cloth of gold, and mantled above with violet figured damask."

<P>THE Green Ara is much rarer than the two preceding; it is also much smaller. It consists of only one species, though nomencla∣tors
<PB N="170" REF="192"/>
have divided it into two; because they con∣found it with the Green Parrakeet, which they call the <HI>Ara Parrakeet,</HI> on account of the length of its tail, and its distinctly articulating the word ara: but notwithstanding these properties it is still a Parrakeet, and very common in Cayenne; whereas the Green Ara is there altogether un∣known. Sloane says that the Little Maccaw, or Little Green Ara, is very frequent in the woods of Jamaica. But Edwards properly ob∣serves that this is certainly a mistake, because, though he made several applications, he could procure none from his correspondents in that island. Perhaps Sloane confounded the long-tailed Green Parrakeet with the Green Ara.</P>
<P>We had a Green Ara alive: it was presented by M. Sonini of Manoncour, who procured it at Cayenne from the savages of Oyapoc, where it was caught in the nest. Its length, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, is about sixteen inches; its body, both above and below, is green, which according to the position is golden and sparkling or deep olive; the great and small quills of the wing are beryl blue, on a brown ground, and the under side copper coloured; the under side of the tail is the same, and the upper side painted with beryl blue, melting into olive green; the green on the head is brighter and less mixed with olive than that on the rest of the body; at the base of the upper mandible, on the face, there is a black border of small
<PB N="171" REF="193"/>
linear feathers that resemble bristles; the white naked skin that surrounds the eyes is sprinkled with small pencils of the same black bristles ranged in rows; the iris of the eye is yellow∣ish.</P>
<P>This bird is as beautiful as it is rare; and it is still more amiable for its social temper and gentle disposition. It soon grows familiar with persons whom it sees frequently, and is pleased to receive and repay their caresses. But it has an aversion to strangers, and particularly to chil∣dren, and flies at them furiously. Like all other domesticated Parrots, it clings to the finger when presented to it; it also clasps wood: but in winter, and even in summer, when the weather is cool and rainy, it prefers the arm or the shoulder, especially if the person has wool∣len clothes, for in general it likes warm stuffs. It is also fond of kitchen stoves when they are cooled so much as to retain only a gentle warmth. For the same reason, it avoids sitting on hard bodies which quickly communicate cold, such as iron, marble, glass, &amp;c.; and in cold rainy weather, though in summer, it shud∣ders and trembles if water be thrown upon it. However, in sultry days, it bathes of its own accord, and often dips its head in the water.</P>
<P>If one stroke it gently, it spreads its wings, and squats; it then utters its disagreeable cry, which resembles the chatter of the jay, raising its wings during the action, and bristling its
<PB N="172" REF="194"/>
feathers: and this habitual cry seems to express either pleasure, or languor. Sometimes it has a short shrill cry, which is less equivocal than the former, and denotes joy and satisfaction; for it is generally addressed to persons whom it loves; but this cry also marks its impatience, fits, and its pettish gusts of ill-humour. But it is im∣possible to be precise on this subject; for birds organized like the Parrots perpetually vary or modify their voice, as they are prompted by imi∣tation.</P>
<P>The Green Ara is jealous: it is fired at seeing a young child sharing in its mistress's caresses and favours; it tries to dart at the infant, but, as its flight is short and laborious, it only shews its displeasure by gestures and restless move∣ments, and continues tormented by these fits till its mistress is pleased to leave the child, and take the bird on her finger. It is then over∣joyed, murmurs satisfaction, and sometimes makes a noise exactly like the laugh of an old person. Nor can it bear the company of other Parrots, and if one be lodged in the same room, it will strive to deprive it of every comfort. It would appear, therefore, that the bird can suffer no rivals whatever in its mistress's favour, and that its jealousy is founded on attachment; ac∣cordingly it takes no notice when it sees a dif∣ferent person fondle a child.</P>
<P>It eats nearly the same things that we do. It is particularly fond of bread, beef, fried fish,
<PB N="173" REF="195"/>
pastry, and sugar; but it seems to prefer roasted apples, which it swallows greedily. It cracks nuts with its bill, and picks them dexterously with its claws. It does not chew the soft fruits, but sucks them, by pressing its tongue against the upper mandible; and, with respect to the harder sort of foods, such as bread, pastry, &amp;c. it bruises or chews them, by pressing the tip of the lower mandible upon the most hollow part of the upper. But, whatever be the nature of its food, its excrements are always green, and mixed with a sort of white chalky substance, as in most other birds, except when it is sick, and then they assume an orange or deep yellow cast.</P>
<P>Like all the other Parrots, the Blue Ara uses its claws with great dexterity; it bends forward the hind toe to lay hold of the fruits and other crumbs which are given to it, and to carry them to its bill. The Parrots, therefore, em∣ploy their toes nearly as the squirrels or mon∣keys; they also cling and hang by them. The Green Ara almost always sleeps in this way, hooked to the wires of its cage. There is also another habit common to the Parrots, viz. they never climb or creep without fastening by the bill, with which they begin, and use the feet only as a second point of their motion.</P>
<P>The nostrils are not visible in this Ara, as in most of the other Parrots; instead of being placed in the uncovered part of the horn of the
<PB N="174" REF="196"/>
bill, they are concealed in the first small fea∣thers that cover the base of the upper mandible, which rises and forms a cavity at its root when the bird makes an effort to imitate difficult sounds: in such cases the tongue folds back at the tip, and recovers its shape when it eats; a power not commonly possessed by birds which can only move it backwards or forwards in the direction of the bill. This little Green Ara is as hardy as most of the other Parrots, or even more so. It learns more easily to prattle, and pronounces much more distinctly, than the Red or Blue Aras. It listens to the other Parrots, and improves beside them. Its cry is like that of the other Aras, only its voice is not near so strong, and does not articulate so distinctly the sound <HI>ara.</HI></P>
<P>It is said that bitter almonds will kill Parrots, but I am not certain of the fact; I know, how∣ever, that parsley, of which they are very fond, if taken even in small quantity, is very perni∣cious; as soon as they eat it, a thick viscous li∣quor runs from the bill, and they die in an hour or two.</P>
<P>It appears that there is the same variety in the Green Aras as in the Red; at least Edwards has described a <HI>great Green Maccaw,</HI> which is thirteen inches long, and fifteen to the middle feather of the tail: the face was red; the quills of the wing blue, and also the lower part of the back and the rump. Edwards calls the colour
<PB N="175" REF="197"/>
of the under surface of the wings and of the tail, <HI>dull orange,</HI> and it is probably the same with that dull bronze red which we perceived below the wings of our Green Ara; the feathers of the tail, in that of Edwards, were red above, and terminated by blue <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Severus:</HI> "It is green; its cheeks naked; the quills of its wings and tail blue, below pur∣plish."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE plumage is black, with reflections of shining green, and these mingled colours are much like those of the ani. We can only indicate this species, which is known to the sa∣vages of Guiana, but which we have not been able to procure. It differs from the other Aras in some of its habits; it never approaches the settlements, but remains on the arid and barren summits of rocks and mountains.

he subjoins; the bill and the eyes reddish, and it resides in the interior parts of the coun∣try.</P>
<P>Brisson has formed another Ara from a Par∣rakeet, and called it the <HI>variegated Ara of the Moluccas.</HI> But, as we have frequently observ∣ed, there are no Aras in India, and we have spoken of this bird in treating of the Parrakeets of the old continent. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Ater:</HI> "It is black with a greenish splendour; its bill and eyes are reddish; its legs yel∣low."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>THE AMAZONS and CRICKS.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall apply the name of <HI>Amazon Par∣rots</HI> to all those which are marked with red on the fan of the wing; they have re∣ceived that appellation in America, because they are brought from the country of the Amazons. We shall appropriate the term <HI>Crick</HI> to those which have no red on the fan, but only on the wing: this too is the name given by the sa∣vages of Guiana to these Parrots. They are distinguished from Amazons by other properties also: 1. the plumage of the Amazons is shin∣ing, and even dazzling, whereas the green co∣lour of the Cricks is dull and yellowish; 2. in the Amazons the head is covered with a fine and very bright yellow, but, in the Cricks, this yellow is dull and intermixed with other colours; 3. the Cricks are rather smaller than the Amazons, which are much smaller than the Aras; 4, the Amazons are exceedingly beauti∣ful and rare, but the Cricks are the most com∣mon of the Parrots, and the most inferior in point of beauty; they are extensively spread, while the Amazons are hardly ever found, ex∣cept at Para, and in some other countries bor∣dering on the river of Amazons.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="200"/>
But the Cricks, having red on their wings, ought to be joined with the Amazons, of which this red forms the principal character: their na∣tural habits are likewise the same; they fly in numerous flocks, perch in multitudes on the same spots, and all scream together so loud that they may be heard at a great distance. They frequent also the woods, both those on the mountains and those which grow in the low grounds, and even the swamps that abound with palms, elastic-gum trees, and bananas, &amp;c. and are fond of the fruit of these trees. They eat, therefore, a greater variety of fruits than the Aras, which commonly subsist on the pal∣mettoes alone; but these dates are so hard that they can hardly be cut; they are round, and as large as pippins.</P>
<P>Some authors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutertre, <HI>Hist. des Antilles,</HI> t. II. p. 251.—Labat, <HI>Nouv. Voy aux Iles de l'Amerique,</HI> t. II. p. 159.</NOTE> have said that the flesh of all the American Parrots contracts the odour and colour of the substances on which they feed; that it smells of garlic, when they eat the fruit of the acajou; that it has the scent of musk and of cloves, when they eat the fruit of the Indian wood; and that it receives a black tinge, when they live upon the fruit of the <HI>genipa,</HI> whose juice, though at first as limpid as water, be∣comes as black as ink in the space of a few hours. They subjoin that the Parrots become very fat during the maturity of the mangroves,
<PB N="179" REF="201"/>
which yield excellent food; and lastly that the seeds of the cotton shrub intoxicate them to such a degree, that they may be caught with the hand.</P>
<P>The Amazons, the Cricks, and all the other Parrots of America, construct their nests in holes formed in decayed trees by the woodpeckers, and only lay two eggs twice a year, which the cock and hen hatch by turns: it is said that they never forsake their nest, and persist in hatching, though their eggs be handled and de∣ranged. In the love season, they assemble and breed in the same haunt, and search their food in company; when their appetite is satisfied they make a continual and noisy babbling, shift∣ing their place incessantly, and fluttering from tree to tree, till the darkness of night and the fatigue of action invite to repose. In the morn∣ing they are observed on the naked branches, at sun-rise, and they remain quiet till the dew is dried from their plumage, and their warmth recovered; then they rise in a flock, with a noise like that of gray crows, but louder. They breed in the rainy season <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. de la Borde, King's Physician at Cayenne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The savages commonly take the Parrots in the nest, because they are more easily reared and better-tamed. But the Caribbs, according to Labat, catch them also after they are old: they observe the trees on which they perch in
<PB N="180" REF="202"/>
great numbers in the evening, and, after dark, they carry near the spot lighted coals, on which they throw gum and green pimento; the birds are suddenly involved and stifled in thick smoke, and fall to the ground; the savages then seize them, tie their feet, and recover them from the suffocation, by throwing water on the head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Labat, <HI>Nouv. Voy. aux Iles de l'Amerique,</HI> t. II. 52.</NOTE>. They also bring down the Parrots without hurt∣ing them much, by shooting them with blunt arrows <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The savages of Brasil have very long arrows, headed with a ball of cotton, for shooting at Parrots." <HI>Belon.</HI></NOTE>. But the old ones thus caught are dif∣ficult to tame. There is only one method of rendering them tractable; it is to blow the smoke of tobacco into their bill, which partly intoxicates them, and makes them gentle and pliant. If they grow mutinous again, the dose is repeated, and thus in the course of a few days their disposition is softened. We can hardly form an idea of the envenomed temper of the wild Parrots; they bite cruelly without provo∣cation, and will not quit their hold. The old birds never learn to prattle in perfection. To∣bacco smoke is also used to cure them of their noisy disagreeable cry.</P>
<P>Some authors <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Frisch, &amp;c.</NOTE> alledge that the female Par∣rakeets never learn to speak; but this is a mis∣take: they are more easily taught than the males, and even more docile and gentle. Of
<PB N="181" REF="203"/>
all the American Parrots, the Amazons and the Cricks are the most susceptible of education, especially when caught young.</P>
<P>As the savages traffic with each other in the feathers of Parrots, they claim a certain number of trees on which these birds make their nests. This is a kind of property from which they derive an income by selling the Par∣rots to strangers, or by bartering the feathers with other savages. These trees descend from father to son, and are often their richest inherit∣ance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, <HI>Hist. Nov. Hisp. p.</HI> 38.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE crown of the head is a fine bright yel∣low; the throat, the neck, the upper side of the back, and the superior coverts of the wings, of a brilliant green; the breast and the belly green, with a little yellowish; the fans of the wings are of a bright red; the quills of the wings are variegated with green, black, violet-blue, and red; the two exterior quills, on each side of the tail, have their inner webs red at their origin, and then deep green, which, at the extremity, changes into a yellowish green; the bill is red at the base, all the rest of it ci∣nereous;

the iris is yellow; the feet gray, and the nails black.</P>
<P>We must observe that Linnaeus commits an error in saying that this bird has naked cheeks; which confounds the Amazons with the Aras, to which alone that character belongs.

<DIV4>
<HEAD>VARIETIES or CONTIGUOUS SPECIES of the YELLOW-HEADED AMAZON.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two other species, or perhaps va∣rieties, related to the preceding.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Red and Green Parrot of Cayenne,</HI> which has not been mentioned by any natural∣ist, though known in Guiana by the name of <HI>Bastard Amazon</HI> or <HI>Half-Amazon.</HI> It is said to be a cross-breed of the Amazon with another Parrot. It is indeed inferior in beauty to the one just described; for it has not the fine yellow on the face near the root of the bill; the green co∣lour of its plumage is not so brilliant, but has a yellowish cast; the red on the plumage is the only colour which is similar and disposed in the
<PB N="184" REF="206"/>
same way; there is also a shade of yellowish under the tail; the bill is reddish, and the feet gray; and as it has the same bulk, we can hardly doubt but that it is nearly related to the species of the Amazon.</P>
<P N="2">II. The second variety was first noticed by Aldrovandus, and, according to his description, it appears to differ from this Amazon Parrot only in the colours of its bill, which that au∣thor says is ochrey on the sides of the upper mandible, whose ridge is bluish, with a small white bar near the tip; the lower mandible is also yellowish in the middle, and lead colour through the rest of its length. But all the co∣lours of the plumage, the size, and shape of the body, being the same as in the Yellow-headed Amazon, it may be only a variety.</P>

<P>IT would be more accurate to name this bird the <HI>White-fronted Parrot;</HI> because the white is generally confined to the face. But some∣times it surrounds the eye, and extends to the crown of the head; and often it only borders the face. The species appears subject, there∣fore, to variety. In one specimen, the plumage was also of a deeper green, and less waved with black: in another, it was lighter, mixed with yellowish, and intersected with black festoons all over the body; the throat and the fore-side of the neck are of a fine red. That colour is not so much spread in the former, or so bright, but there is a spot of it under the belly. In both of them, the quills of the wing are blue; those of the tail yellowish green, tinged with
<PB N="186" REF="209"/>
red in the first half; and, on the fan, a red spot is perceived, which is the livery of the Ama∣zons. Sloane says that these Parrots are fre∣quently brought from Cuba to Jamaica, and that they occur also in St. Domingo. They are found in Mexico, but never in Guiana. Brisson divides them into two species; and this mistake was occasioned by Edwards's White-headed Parrot being different from his. The Martinico Parrot mentioned by Labat, in which the upper side of the head is slate colour, with a little red, is different from our White-headed Parrot, though Brisson asserts that they are the same <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Leucocephalus:</HI> "It is green; its wing-quills blue; its front white; its orbits snowy."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the AOUROU-COURAOU.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are several varieties which may be referred to this species.</P>
<P N="1">I. The bird mentioned by Aldrovandus under the appellation of <HI>Psittacus Viridis Melanorinchos,</HI> which hardly differs at all from the preceding.</P>
<P N="2">II. There is another also described by Aldro∣vandus, in which the face is beryl blue with a bar of the same colour above the eyes, which is only a shade different from the species of this article. The crown of the head is also of a paler yellow; the upper mandible is red at the base, bluish in the middle, and black at the end; the lower mandible is whitish. In all other properties, the colours are precisely the same as in the <HI>Aourou-Couraou.</HI> It is found in Guiana, Brazil, and Mexico, and also in Ja∣maica; and it must be very common in Mexi∣co, since the Spaniards give it a proper name, <HI>Catherina</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many beautiful kinds of Parrots are distinguished in New Spain; the <HI>caterinillas</HI> have their plumage entirely green; the <HI>loros</HI> have it green likewise, except the head and the extremity of the wings, which are of a fine yellow; the <HI>pericos</HI> are of the same co∣lour, and are not larger than a thrush." <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. t. XII. p.</HI> 626.</NOTE>. From Guiana it has probably been carried into Jamaica, which is at too great dis∣tance from the continent to correspond with the excursions of the Parrots. Labat says that they cannot fly from one island to another, and that
<PB N="189" REF="213"/>
those of the different islands may be distinguish∣ed. The Parrots of Brazil, Cayenne, and the rest of the continent of America, which are seen in the islands, have been transported thither, and few which are natives of the islands are found on the continent, on account of the dif∣ficulty of the passage; for a strong current sets out from the Bay of Mexico, so that a vessel is carried in six or seven days from the continent to the islands, though it takes six weeks or two months to work back again.</P>
<P N="3">III. Another variety is the <HI>Aiuru-Curuca</HI> of Marcgrave. There is on the head a blue cap mixed with a little black, in the midst of which is a yellow spot: this indication differs in no∣thing from the description which we have given. But the bill is ash-coloured at the base, and black at the end; this is the only slight variation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Marcgrave notices another variety, and remarks that it is like the preceding; yet our nomenclators have ranged them in different spe∣cies, and even doubled these. The only dif∣ference is that the yellow extends a little more on the neck.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>The Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrot</HI> of Bris∣son <HI>(Psittacus Amazonicus fronte lutea).</HI> The only difference is that the face is whitish, or pale yellow, but in the other it is bluish; which is by no means sufficient to constitute a distinct and separate species.</P>

<P>THE whole of the head, the throat, and the lower part of the neck, are of a very fine yellow; the under side of the body is of a shin∣ing green, and the upper side also green, but with a little mixture of yellow; the fan of the wing is yellow, whereas the same part is red in the Amazons; the first row of the coverts

of the wing is red and yellow; the other rows are of a fine green; the quills of the wings and of the tail are variegated with green, black, violet, yellowish, and red; the iris is yellow; the bill and feet whitish.</P>
<P>This bird is living at present with Father Bougot, who has communicated to us the fol∣lowing account of its disposition and habits.</P>
<P><Q>“”It is very susceptible of attachment to its master;</Q> it is fond of him, but requires frequent caresses, and seems disconsolate if neglected, and vindictive if provoked. It has fits of obsti∣nacy; it bites during its ill humour, and im∣mediately laughs, exulting in its mischief. Cor∣rection and rigorous treatment only harden it, and make it more stubborn and wayward; gentle usage alone succeeds in mollifying its temper.</P>
<P><Q>“”The inclination to gnaw whatever it can reach, is very destructive in its effects;</Q> it cuts the cloth of the furniture, splits the wood of the chairs, and tears paper, pens, &amp;c. And if it be removed from the spot, its proneness to contradiction will instantly hurry it back. But this mischievous bent is counterbalanced by agreeable qualities, for it remembers easily what it is taught to say. Before articulating it claps its wings and plays on its roost; in the cage it grows dejected, and continues silent; never prattles well, except when it enjoys liberty. It chatters less in winter than during the summer
<PB N="192" REF="216"/>
months, forgetting its food, when it never ceases from morning to night.</P>
<P><Q>“”In its cheerful days it is affectionate, re∣ceives and returns caresses, and listens and obeys;</Q> though a peevish fit often interrupts the harmony. It seems affected by the change of weather, and becomes silent; the way to re∣animate it is to sing beside it; it strives by its noisy screams to surpass the voice which excites it. It is fond of children; in which respect it differs from other Parrots. It contracts a pre∣dilection for some of them, and suffers them to handle and carry it; it caresses them, and if any person then touches them, it bites at him fiercely. If its favourite children leave it, it is unhappy, follows them, and calls loudly after them. During moulting it is much reduced, and seems to endure great pain; and that state lasts near three months.</P>
<P>"Its ordinary food is hemp-seed, nuts, fruits of all kinds, and bread soaked in wine; it would prefer flesh, but that diet makes it low spirited and inactive, and, after some time, occasions its feathers to drop.

It is the biggest of all the Parrots of the new world, except the Aras. It is called <HI>meunier,</HI> or the <HI>miller,</HI> by the settlers at Cayenne, because its plumage, whose ground colour is green, ap∣pears sprinkled with meal: there is a yellow spot on the head; the feathers on the upper surface of the neck have a broad edging of brown; the under side of the body is of a light∣er green than the upper side, and is not mealy; the outer quills of the wings are black, except a part of the outer webs, which are blue; there is a large red spot on the wings; the quills of the tail are of the same colour with the under side of the body, from their origin to three fourths of their length, and the remaining fourth yellowish green.</P>

<P>THIS Parrot was sent to us from the Havan∣na, and it is probably common in Mexico and near the isthmus of Panama; but it is not found in Guiana. It is much smaller than the Mealy Crick, its length being only twelve inches. Among the quills of the wings, which

<P>THE name <HI>Crick</HI> is bestowed on this bird at Cayenne, where it is so common that the same appellation is extended to a considerable tribe of Parrots. It is smaller than the Ama∣zons; but we ought not, with the nomencla∣tors, to range it among the Parrakeets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby, Ray, Linnaeus, and Brisson.</NOTE>: they have mistaken it for the Guadeloupe Parrakeet, because it is entirely green. They would have avoided this error, if they had consulted Marc∣grave, who says expressly that it is large as a hen; and this character is alone sufficient to ex∣clude it from the Parrakeets.</P>
<P>This Crick has also been confounded with
<PB N="197" REF="221"/>
the <HI>Tahua,</HI> or <HI>Tavoua</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barrere and Brisson.</NOTE>, which is widely dif∣ferent; for the Tavoua has no red on its wings, and is therefore neither an Amazon nor a Crick, but rather a Popinjay, of which we shall speak in the following article.</P>
<P>The Crick is near a foot long from the tip of the bill to the extremity of the tail, and its wings, when closed, extend a little beyond the middle of the tail; both the upper and under sur∣face are of a pretty light handsome green, par∣ticularly on the belly and the neck, where the green is very brilliant; the front and the crown of the head are also of a pleasant green; the cheeks are greenish-yellow; there is a red spot on the wings, and their quills are black, terminated with blue; the two middle quills of the tail are of the same green with the back, and the outer quills, being five on either side, have each an oblong red spot on the inner webs, and which spread more and more from the inner quill to the outer one; the iris is red; the bill and feet whitish.</P>

<P>THIS is described by Edwards; it is found also in Guiana.

I. The <HI>Cocho Parrot,</HI> mentioned by Fernan∣dez, which differs in so far only as it is varie∣gated with red and whitish instead of red and bluish; in every other respect it is the same with the Blue-headed Crick.

Its face, and the top of its neck, are of a fine red, whereas these parts are bluish in the Blue-headed Crick; but, in other respects, the resemblance is exact.—We cannot conceive why Brisson ranges this bird with the Dominica Parrot, mentioned by La∣bat; for that author says only that there are a few red feathers in the wings, in the tail, and under the throat, and that all the rest of its plumage is green.

<P>THIS Parrot is found in Guadaloupe, and was first described by Father Dutertre. "Its colours are so beautiful," he says, "and so sin∣gular, that it deserves to be selected from all the rest for description. It is almost as large as a hen; its bill and eyes are edged with carnation; all the feathers of its head, of its neck, and of its belly, are violet, mixed with a tincture of green and black, changing like the neck of a pigeon; all the upper side of the back is of a very brown green; the great quills of the wings are black, all the others yellow, green, and red; on the coverts of the wings are two rose-shaped spots of the same colours. When it bristles the feathers of its neck, it makes a fine ruff round the head, on which it seems to pride itself, as the peacock does on its tail; it has a strong voice, speaks very distinctly, and is easily taught, if taken young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. des Antilles,</HI> t. II. p. 251.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>We have not seen this Parrot; it is not found at Cayenne, and it must now be very rare in Guadeloupe, since none of the inhabitants of
<PB N="201" REF="225"/>
this island could give us any account of it. But this is not extraordinary; for as the islands ad∣vance in population, the number of Parrots gradually decreases, and Dutertre remarks in particular, that the French colonists commit great havock among the Violet-headed Cricks in the season of the maturity of the guavas, cachi∣mans, &amp;c. when their flesh is excessively fat and juicy. He adds that they are of a gentle dispo∣sition, and easily tamed: "We have two," says he, "which build their nest in a large tree a hundred paces from our hut; the male and fe∣male sit alternately, and come one after another to the hut for food, and bring their young ones with them as soon as these can leave the nest."</P>
<P>We may observe that, as the Cricks are the most common kind of Parrots, and at the same time speak the best, the savages have amused themselves in rearing these, and in trying to va∣ry their plumage. For that operation they use the blood of a small frog, which is very differ∣ent from those of Europe; it is only half the size, and of a fine azure colour, with longi∣tudinal bars of gold: it is the handsomest of all the frogs, and seldom frequents marshes, but inhabits the sequestered forests. The savages take a young Crick from the nest, and pluck the scapular feathers and some of those on the back; then they rub it with the frog's blood, and the new feathers which grow are no longer green, but fine yellow or beautiful red. These
<PB N="202" REF="226"/>
birds thus altered are called <HI>Tapired Parrots</HI> in France. The operation must have been an∣ciently in use among the savages, for it is no∣ticed by Marcgrave; those which inhabit Gui∣ana and the banks of the Amazons equally prac∣tise it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de M. de Gennes au detroit de Magellan. <HI>Paris,</HI> 1698, <HI>p.</HI> 163.</NOTE>. The plucking of the feathers hurts the birds greatly, and so many die of it, that those which survive are very rare, and are sold much dearer than the other Parrots.</P>
<P>The Parrot mentioned by Klein and Frisch is one of these artificial birds; it would therefore be idle to copy their description. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Violaceus:</HI> "It is violet, variegated with green, and a mixture of black; its back partly dusky green; its greater wing-quills black, the rest variegated with yellow, green, and red; a rosy spot on the coverts."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS Parrot is very handsome. Its body is yellow, and all the feathers edged with dark glossy red; the great quills of the wings are white, and all the others yellow, like the feathers on the body; the two quills in the middle of the tail are also yellow, and all the lateral ones red, from their origin as far as two

<P>It would seem that this species admits of some variety; for in the specimen described by Cates∣by, the throat and belly were entirely red, though there are others in which these parts were yellow, and the feathers only edged with white. Perhaps the breadth of the red borders differs according to age or sex, which would ac∣count for the diversity.—The bird is found in the island of Cuba <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Paradisi:</HI> "It is yellow; its throat, its belly, and the base of its tail-quills, are red."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The top of the head and the face are sur∣rounded with narrow long feathers, white and radiated with blackish, and which it bristles when irritated, and disposes into a fine ruff. The nape and sides of the neck are of a fine brown red, and edged with lively blue; the feathers on the breast and stomach are clouded with the same colours, only more dilute, and with a mixture of green; a more beautiful silky shining green covers the upper side of the body and of the tail, except that some of the lateral feathers on each side appear blue exteriorly, and the primaries of the wing are brown, and also the under surface of those of the tail.</P>

<PB N="206" REF="232"/>
It is rare in Guiana; yet it sometimes approaches the dwellings. Bird-fanciers are eager to obtain it, for of all the Parrots it speaks the best, and even excels the Red-tailed Gray Parrot of Gui∣nea; and yet it was not known till lately, which is somewhat singular. But its talents are at∣tended with an essential defect; it is faithless and mischievous, and bites cruelly when it pre∣tends to caress: it would even seem to lay plans of malice, and its physiognomy, though spright∣ly, is dubious. It is an exceedingly beautiful bird, and more nimble and agile than any other Parrot.</P>
<P>Its back and its rump are of a very beautiful red; it has also some red on the front, and the upper side of its head is light blue; the rest of the upper side of the body is a fine full green, and the under side of a lighter green; the quills of the wings are of a fine black, with deep blue reflections; so that in some positions they ap∣pear entirely of a very deep blue: the coverts of the wings are variegated with deep blue and green.</P>

<HEAD>The PARROQUETS. <HI>Les Perriches,</HI> Buff.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we consider the great tribe of Parroquets, we shall survey separately a little genus that appears to belong neither to the Parroquets nor to the Popinjays, and which is intermediate in regard to size. It contains only two species, the <HI>Maipouri</HI> and the <HI>Caica;</HI> which last was unknown till very lately.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="species">
<HEAD>The MAIPOURI, <HI>Buff.</HI> FIRST SPECIES. <HI>Psittacus Melanocephalus,</HI> Linn. and Gmel. <HI>Psittacus Mexicanus pectore albo,</HI> Briff. <HI>Psittacus Atricapillus,</HI> Miller. The <HI>White breasted Parrot,</HI> Edw. and Lath:</HEAD>
<P>THE name is very applicable; for this Parrot whistles like the tapir, which is called <HI>maipouri</HI> in Cayenne; and though there is a vast difference between that huge quadruped and this little bird, they utter sounds so exactly si∣milar, as not to be distinguishable. It is found in Guiana, in Mexico, and as far as the Ca∣raccas; it never comes night the settlements, but commonly lives in woods surrounded with wa∣ter,
<PB N="216" REF="242"/>
or even among the trees which grow in the deluged savannas. It has no other note than the sharp whistle, which it repeats often while on the wing, and it never learns to speak.</P>
<P>These birds commonly associate in small bo∣dies, but often without any tie of affection; for they fight frequently, and with rancourous ob∣stinacy. When any are caught, they reject every kind of food, so that it is impossible to keep them alive; and their temper is so stub∣born that it cannot be softened by the smoke of tobacco, which calms the most froward of the Parrots. The Maipouris require to be bred when young, and they would not repay the trouble of educating them, were not their plum∣age so beautiful, and their figure so singular: for their shape is very different from that of the Parrots, or even of the Parroquets; their body is thicker and shorter, their head much larger, their neck and tail extremely short; so that they have an heavy unwieldy air. All their motions are suitable to their figure; even their feathers are entirely different from those of other Parrots and Parrakeets, being short, close, and cohering to the body; so that they seem com∣pressed and glued artificially on the breast and on all the lower parts of the body.—The Mai∣pouri is as large as a small Popinjay, and, for this reason perhaps, have Edwards, Brisson, and Linnaeus, classed it with the Parrots; but the
<PB N="217" REF="243"/>
difference is so great as to require a distinct ge∣nus.</P>

Its species is not only new in Europe, but even in Cayenne. M. Sonini de Mononcour tells us, that he saw it the first in 1773. Prior to that date none ever appeared in Cayenne, and it is still uncertain from what country they come. But they have since continued to arrive annu∣ally in small flocks, about the months of Sep∣tember and October, and halt only a short time during the fine weather, so that they are only birds of passage.</P>
<P>The hood which envelopes the Caica is pierc∣ed with a hole, in which the eye is placed; the hood extends very low, and spreads into two chin pieces of the same colour; the circuit of the neck is fulvous and yellowish; the beautiful green which covers the rest of the body is in∣terrupted by an azure tinge, that marks the edges of the wing from the shoulder, borders the great quills on a darker ground, and tips those of the tail, except the two middle ones, which are entirely green, and appear rather shorter than the lateral ones. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Pileatus:</HI> "It is green; its head black; its orbits white; a sky-blue spot on its shoulders; the tail tipt with blue."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>PARROQUETS WITH LONG AND EQUALLY TAPERED TAILS.</HEAD>
<P>THE distinction of long and short tailed Parrakeets obtains both in the new and in the old continent. Of the long-tailed ones, some have the tail equally tapered, others un∣equally. We shall therefore pursue the former plan; we shall begin with such as have long and equal tails, then consider such as have long but unequal tails, and conclude with the short-tailed ones.</P>

<P>THIS is one of the handsomest of the Parro∣quets. It is pretty common in Cayenne, and is also found in the Antilles, as M. de la Borde assures us. It learns more easily to speak than any of the Parroquets of the new conti∣nent;

but, in other respects, it is indocile, for it always retains its wild savage character. Its aspect is angry and turbulent, but as it has a quick eye and a slender active shape, its figure is pleasing. Our bird-fanciers have adopted the name <HI>Pavouane,</HI> which it has in Guiana. These Parroquets fly in flocks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It is remarked that the Parrakeets never associate with the Parrots, but always keep together in great flocks." <HI>Wafer,</HI> in Dampier's Voyage.</NOTE>, perpetually screaming and squalling; and they range through the woods and savannas, and prefer the fruit of a large tree, called in that country the <HI>immortal,</HI> and which Tournefort denominates the <HI>corallo dendron.</HI></P>
<P>It is a foot long; its tail is near six inches, and regularly tapered; the upper side of the wings and tail of a very fine green. In propor∣tion as the bird grows older, the sides of the head and neck are covered with small spots of a bright red, which become more and more nu∣merous; so that, in such as are aged, these parts are almost entirely covered with beautiful red spots. These never begin to appear till the second or third year. The small inferior coverts of the wings are of the same bright red, in every pe∣riod of its age, only the colour is not quite so bright when the bird is young. The great in∣ferior wings are of a fine yellow; the quills of the wings and tail are of a dull yellow below; the wing is whitish, and the feet are gray.</P>

<P>THIS species is called the <HI>Common Parrakeet</HI> in Cayenne. It is not so large as a black-bird, being only eight inches and four lines long, including the tail, which is three inches and a half. These Parroquets keep in numer∣ous flocks, prefer the cleared grounds, and even resort to the settled spots. They are very fond of the buds of the <HI>immortal</HI> tree, and when in blossom they perch on it in crowds. One of these large trees planted in the new town of Cayenne draws the visits of these birds; they are frightened away by firing upon them, but they soon return. It is difficult to teach them to speak.</P>
<P>In this Parroquet the head, the whole body, the tail, and the superior coverts of the wings, are of a fine green; the quills of the wings are variegated with yellow, bluish green, white, and green; the quills of the tail are edged with yellowish on the inside; the bill, the feet, and the nails, are gray.</P>

<P>THE Anaca is a very handsome Parroquet, which is found in Brazil. It is only of the size of a lark; the crown of the head is chesnut; the sides of the head brown; the throat cinereous; the upper side of the neck and the flanks green; the belly is rusty brown; the back green with a brown spot; the tail light brown; the quills of the wings green, terminated with blue, and there is a spot or ra∣ther a fringe of blood colour on the top of the wings; the bill is brown; the feet cinereous.</P>

Farther, is it cre∣dible that birds which live upon tender and juicy fruits would wing their course to frozen tracts, which yield nothing but a few starved berries? Yet such are the lands which border on the Straits of Magellan, where some travellers are supposed to have seen Parrots.

<HEAD>The SINCIALO. FIRST SPECIES, With a long and unequal Tail. <HI>Psittacus Rusirostris,</HI> Linn. Gmel. and Gerini. The <HI>Long-tailed Green Parrakeet,</HI> Edw. and Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS bird is called <HI>Sincialo</HI> at St. Domingo. It is not larger than a blackbird, but is twice as long, its tail being seven inches, and its body five. It is disposed to chatter, and easily learns to speak, to whistle, and to mimic the cries of all the animals which it hears: these Parroquets fly in flocks, and perch on the closest and most verdant trees; and as they are green themselves, they can hardly be perceived. They make a great noise among the trees, many at once screaming, squalling, and chattering; and if they overhear the voice of men or other ani∣mals, they cry the louder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutertre, <HI>t. II. p.</HI> 252.</NOTE>. This habit is not peculiar to the Sincialos, for almost all Parrots that are kept in the house babble with more vo∣ciferation when a person speaks high. They feed like the other Parrots, but are more lively
<PB N="229" REF="255"/>
and cheerful: they are soon tamed; they seem fond of being taken notice of, and they seldom are silent, for whenever a person talks, they scream and chatter likewise. They grow fat and delicate to eat, during the maturity of the seeds of Indian wood, which principally sup∣ports them.</P>
<P>The whole plumage of this Parroquet is yel∣lowish green; the inferior coverts of its wings and tail are almost yellow; the two quills in the middle of the tail are longer, by an inch and nine lines, than those contiguous on either side, and the other lateral quills contract gradually, so that the outermost are five inches shorter than the mid-ones. The eyes are encircled by a flesh coloured skin; the iris is fine orange; the bill is black, with a little red at the base of the upper mandible; the feet and nails are flesh coloured. This species is scattered through al∣most all the warm parts of America.</P>

<P>THIS bird is found, like the preceding, in al∣most all the warm parts of America. It was first described by Edwards. The front is of a bright red; the crown of the head of a fine blue; the back of the head, the upper side of the neck, the superior coverts of the wings and those of the tail are deep green; the throat and all the under side of the body are a little yellow∣ish; some of the great coverts of the wings are blue; the primaries are dull ash colour on the inside, and blue on the outside, and at the ex∣tremity; the iris is orange; the bill cinereous; and the feet reddish.</P>
<P>We must observe that Edwards, and Linnaeus, who has copied him, confound this Parroquet with the <HI>Tui-apute-juba</HI> of Marcgrave, which constitutes a different species, as will appear from the following description. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Psittacus Canicularis:</HI> "It is green, with a red front; the back of its head and the outermost quills of its wings, are blue; its orbits fulvous."</NOTE></P>

<P>THE front, the sides of the head, and the top of the throat, are of a fine yellow; the crown and back of the head, the upper surface of the neck and of the body, the wings and the tail, are of a fine green. Some of the superior coverts of the wings, and the great quills, are edged exteriorly with blue; the two quills in the middle of the tail are longer than the lateral ones, which continually shorten, insomuch that the mid-ones exceed the outermost by an inch and nine lines; the lower belly is yellow; the iris deep orange; the bill and feet cinereous.</P>
<P>From this description alone it is manifest that this species is not the same with the preceding, and is even widely different. Besides, it is very common in Guiana, where the former is never found. It is vulgarly called at Cayenne the <HI>Wood-lice Parrakeet,</HI> because it generally lodges in the holes where these insects nestle.

What he described was really a female, since it layed five or six small white eggs in Eng∣land, and lived fourteen years in that climate.

This Parroquet, which the Brazilians call <HI>Guiaruba,</HI> that is, Yellow Bird, does not learn to speak at all; and it is melancholy and solitary. Yet the sa∣vages hold it in great estimation for the sake of its plumage, which is very different from that of the other Parrots, and on account of its be∣ing easily tamed. It is almost entirely yellow; only there are some green spots on the wings, whose small quills are green, fringed with yel∣low; the primaries are violet fringed with blue; and the same mixture of colours appears on the tail, whose extremity is blue-violet; its middle and rump are green, edged with yellow; all the rest of the body is pure yellow, and vi∣vid saffron, or orange. The tail is five inches in length, which is that of the body; it is much tapered, so that the last lateral feathers are one half shorter than those of the middle. The Yellow Mexican Parrakeet, given by Brisson from Seba, appears to be a variety of this; and the little pale red which Seba represents on the head of his bird <HI>Cocho,</HI> and which was perhaps only an orange tint, does not form a specific character.</P>

<P><PB N="236" REF="263"/>
These birds, says Catesby, feed upon the seeds and kernels of fruits, particularly apples, and the grains contained in cypress cones. In autumn they resort to the orchards in great flocks, and as they tear and mangle fruits to obtain the kernel, which is the only part that they eat, they do much injury. They pene∣trate as far as Virginia, which is the most northern colony, subjoins Catesby, where I heard of Parrots being seen. This is also the only species found in Carolina, where a few breed; but most of them retire south wards in the love season, and appear again during the harvest; being enticed by the fruit trees, and rice crops. The colonies between the tropics suffer greatly from the influx of Parrots on their plantations. In the months of August and Sep∣tember of 1750 and 1751, a prodigious number of Parrots of all kinds arrived in Surinam, and spread in flocks among the ripe coffee; they ate the red husks, without touching the beans, which they suffered to fall to the ground.

<P>SOSOVE is the Galibi name of this charming little bird, which is easily described, since it is entirely of a brilliant green, except a spot of light yellow on the quills of the wings, and on the superior coverts of the tail; the bill is white, and the feet gray.</P>
<P>This species is common in Guiana, especially near Oyapoe, and the river Amazons. It can easily be tamed, and taught to speak.

<P>MARCGRAVE first described this bird. Its plumage is entirely green; the eyes are black; the bill carnation; and the feet bluish. It is soon tamed and taught to speak, and is very gentle, and easily managed.</P>
<P>The <HI>small Chatterer</HI> of the <HI>Planches Enlumi∣nées</HI> seems to be of the same species: it is also entirely green; its bill flesh coloured, and of the usual size of a Toui.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tuin</HI> of Jean de Laët <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Description des Indes Occidentalis, p.</HI> 490.</NOTE> does not mean any particular species, but comprehends all the Parroquets in general; and therefore we ought not, with Brisson, to refer it to the <HI>Tui-tirica</HI> of Marcgrave.</P>
<P>Sonnerat mentions a bird which he saw in the island of Luçon, and which much resembles the <HI>Tui-tirica</HI> of Marcgrave. It is of the same bulk, and its plumage wholly dyed green, though deeper above, and lighter below. But it is dis∣tinguished by the gray colour of its bill, which is carnation in the other, and by the gray cast

of its feet, which are bluish in the former: these differences would be insufficient to constitute a species, if the climates were not so distant.

<P>THIS bird is also found in Brazil.

<HEAD>The CURUCUIS. <HI>Les Couroucous, ou Couroucoais,</HI> Buff.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the name which these birds bear in their native climate of Brazil. This word imitates their cry so exactly, that the natives of Guiana have omitted only the first letter, and call them <HI>Urucoos.</HI> Their characters are these: Their bill short, hooked, indented, broader than it is thick, and much like that of the Par∣rots; it is surrounded at its base by ragged fea∣thers, projecting forwards, but not so long as in the bearded birds, which we shall afterwards describe; the legs also are very short, and fea∣thered within a little of the insertion of the toes, which are placed two behind and two before. We know only three species, and these may perhaps be reduced to two, though nomen∣clators reckon six, some of which are varieties, and others belong to a different genus.</P>

<P>THIS bird is ten inches and a half long; the head, the whole of the neck and the rise of the breast, the back, the rump, and the co∣verts of the upper side of the tail, are of a fine brilliant green, but changing, and, in a certain position, blue; the coverts of the wings are blue gray, variegated with small black zig-zag lines; and the great quills of the tail are black, except their shafts, which are partly white; the quills of the tail are of a fine green, like the back, ex∣cept the two outer ones, which are blackish, and have small transverse gray lines; a part of the breast, the belly, and the coverts of the un∣der side of the tail, are of a fine red; the bill is yellowish, and the legs are brown.</P>
<P>Another subject, which appears to have been a female, differed in no respect, except that all the parts, which were of a fine brilliant green in the first, are blackish-gray in this, and without any reflections; the small zig-zag lines are much more indistinct, because the dark brown predo∣minates, and the three outer quills of the tail
<PB N="247" REF="275"/>
have, on their exterior webs, alternate black and white bars; the upper mandible is entirely brown, and the lower yellowish; lastly, the red colour is much less spread, occupying only the lower belly, and the coverts of the under surface of the tail.</P>
<P>There is a third subject in the King's Cabi∣net, which differs chiefly from the two pre∣ceding in these respects: the tail is longer, and the three outer quills on each side have their outer webs and their tips white; the three exterior quills of the wing are marked with transverse spots, that are alternately white and black at their margin; there is also a gold-green shade, waving on the back and on the quills in the middle of the tail, which has not place in the preceding. But the red tinge is disposed in the same way, and begins only at the lower belly, and the bill is similar in its shape and colour.</P>
<P>The Chevalier Le Febvre Deshayes, corres∣pondent of the Cabinet, whom we have often had occasion to quote as an excellent observer, has sent us a coloured drawing of this bird, with excellent observations. He says that it is called at St. Domingo <HI>the red drawers</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caleçon rouge.</NOTE>, and in many of the other islands it is termed <HI>the English lady</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Demoiselle ou Dame Angloise.</NOTE>.
<Q>"This bird retires," he adds, “”into the depths of the forests during the season of its amours;</Q> its melancholy and even dismal accents seem to
<PB N="248" REF="276"/>
express that profound sensibility which carries it into the desert, to enjoy in solitude the tender∣ness of love, and that languor, which is more delicious perhaps than its transports. This cry alone reveals its retreat, which is often inacces∣sible, and difficult to discover.</P>
<P><Q>“”Their loves commence in April: they choose the hole of a tree, and line it with the dust of worm-eaten wood;</Q> and this bed is as soft as cotton or down. If they cannot find such dust, they break fresh wood with their bill, and reduce it to powder; and their bill, which is indented near the point, is sufficiently strong for that purpose: it also serves to enlarge the hole, when not sufficiently wide. They lay three or four eggs, which are white, and somewhat smaller than those of a pigeon.</P>
<P><Q>“”While the female hatches, the employ∣ment of the male is to bring supplies of food, to keep watch on a neighbouring bough, and to sing.</Q> At other times he is silent and reserved; but during incubation, he fatigues the echos with those languishing sounds, which how in∣sipid soever they may appear to us, undoubt∣edly sooth the tedious occupation of his dear companion.</P>
<P><Q>“”The young, at the moment of their exclu∣sion, are entirely naked, without any trace of feathers, but which begin to sprout two or three days after.</Q> Their head and bill appear uncommonly thick, compared with the rest of
<PB N="249" REF="277"/>
their body; their legs too seem excessively long, though they are very short when the bird is grown. The male becomes silent the instant that the brood are hatched; but he again re∣sumes his song, with his loves, in the months of August and September.</P>
<P><Q>“”They feed their young with worms, ca∣terpillars, and insects.</Q> Their enemies are the rats, the serpents, and both the nocturnal and diurnal birds of prey; so that the species of the <HI>Ooroocoais</HI> is not numerous, most of them fall∣ing a sacrifice to depredation.</P>
<P><Q>“”After the young ones are flown, they re∣main not long together;</Q> they yield to their so∣litary instinct and disperse.</P>
<P>"In some individuals the legs are reddish, in others they are slaty blue. It has not been ob∣served whether this diversity is occasioned by age, or results from the difference of sex."</P>
<P>The Chevalier Deshayes tried to raise some of the preceding year, but his attempts were fruit∣less; and, either from a languid or a lofty tem∣per, they obstinately refused to eat. "Per∣haps," says he, "I should have succeeded bet∣ter, if I had taken them just after hatching; but a bird, which lives so remote from us, and which seeks felicity in the freedom and silence of the desert, seems not adapted for slavery, and must continue a stranger to all the habits of the domestic state." <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Trogon-Curucui:</HI> It is gold-green, below fulvous; its throat black."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS bird is about eleven inches long; the wings when closed do not reach quite to the tail; the head and the upper side of the neck are blackish, with reflections of handsome green in some parts; the back, the rump, and the coverts of the upper side of the tail, are bril∣liant green, like the thighs; the great coverts of the wings are blackish, with small white spots; the great quills of the wings are black∣ish, and the four or five outer ones have a white shaft; the quills of the tail are of the same co∣lour with those of the wings, except that they have some reflections of a brilliant green; the three outer ones on each side are radiated trans∣versely with black and white; the throat and the under side of the neck are dark brown; the breast, the belly, and the coverts below the tail, are of a fine yellow; the bill is indent∣ed, and appears dark brown, as well as the legs; the nails are black; the tail is tapered, the feather on each side being two inches

<P>Between the Red-bellied Curucui and the Yellow-bellied Curucui lie some varieties, which our nomenclators have taken for different spe∣cies.

<P>Further, the bird represented in the <HI>Planches Enluminées</HI> by the name of the <HI>Rufous-tailed Cu∣rucui of Cayenne,</HI> is a variety of the same Yel∣low-bellied Curucui, produced by moulting; since the only difference is that the feathers of the back and tail are rufous instead of blue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>THE throat, neck, and breast, are of a very dusky violet; the head is of the same co∣lour, except that of the front, and of the space round the eyes and ears, which is blackish; the eye-brows yellow; the back and rump of a deep green, with gold reflections; the superior co∣verts of the tail are bluish-green, with the same gold reflections: the wings are brown, and their coverts, as well as the middle quills, are dotted with white; the two central quills of the tail are green, verging on bluish, and terminated with black; the two adjacent pairs are of the
<PB N="253" REF="281"/>
same colour in the uncovered part, and blackish in the rest; the three lateral pairs are black, striped and terminated with white; the bill is lead colour at the base, and whitish near the point; the tail exceeds the wings when closed, by two inches and nine lines, and the total length of the bird is nine inches and a half.</P>
<P>M. Koelreuter calls this bird <HI>Lanius</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Comment. Petropol.</HI> 1763.</NOTE>; but it is of a genus very different from that of a shrike, a lanner, or another bird of prey. A broad short bill, and bristles around the lower mandible; such are the characters which it has in com∣mon with the Curucuis. But the properties wherein it resembles the cuckoos, that the legs are very short and feathered to the nails, which are slender and disposed in pairs, the one before and the other behind; that the nails are short, and slightly hooked; and lastly, the want of a membrane around the base of the bill: all these differ from the characters of the rapacious tribe.</P>
<P>The Curucuis are solitary birds which live in the heart of damp forests, where they subsist on insects; they are never observed to consort in flocks; they generally sit on the middle branches, the cock and hen on separate but adjacent trees, and call each other alternately, by repeating their hollow monotonous cry, <HI>ooroocoais.</HI> They never fly far, but only from tree to tree, and seldom even do that; for they remain during the greatest part
<PB N="254" REF="282"/>
of the day in the same spot, concealed beneath the thickest boughs; where, though their voice is continually heard, yet, as they are motion∣less, they can hardly be discovered. They are clothed so thickly with plumage, that they ap∣pear larger than in reality; they would seem to equal the bulk of a pigeon, though they have not more flesh than a thrush. But if their feathers be numerous and close, they are weakly rooted, for they drop with the least rubbing; so that it is difficult to prepare speci∣mens for the cabinet. These birds are among the most beautiful of South America. Fernan∣dez says that the fine feathers of the Red-bel∣lied Curucui were used by the Mexicans in making portraits, a gaudy kind of paintings, and other ornaments which they wore at festi∣vals, or in battle <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Trogon Violaceus:</HI> "It is violet; its eye-brows bright yellow; its back and rump gold-green; its wings brown; its intermediate tail-quills bluish-green, tipt with black."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are two other birds mentioned by Fer∣nandez, which Brisson supposes to be Curucuis; but they undoubtedly belong not to that genus.</P>
<P>The first is what Fernandez compares to the stare, and which we have formerly noticed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Trogon Mexicanus,</HI> Briss.</NOTE>. I am astonished that Brisson could fancy that it was a Curucui, since Fernandez himself refers it to the genus of the stares, and their figures are similar. But the shape of the bill, the dis∣position
<PB N="255" REF="283"/>
of the toes, the form of the body, every property of the bird in short, is so widely dif∣ferent from those of the Curucuis, that they ne∣ver with propriety can be associated.</P>
<P>The second bird which Brisson has taken for a Curucui is one which Fernandez <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Trogon Mexicanus Varius,</HI> Briss.</NOTE> says is ex∣ceedingly beautiful, and of the size of a pigeon; that it frequents the sea shore; and that its bill is long, broad, black, and a little hooked: this form of the bill is very different from what obtains in the Curucuis, a circumstance alone sufficient to exclude it from this genus. Fernandez subjoins that it does not sing, and that its flesh is unfit for eating; that its head is blue, and the rest of its plumage blue, variegated with green, black, and whitish. But these indications are not pre∣cise enough to determine the species.</P>

<P>BETWEEN the extensive family of the Cuckoo and that of the Curucui, we shall place a bird which seems to participate of both; supposing that the indication of Seba is less faulty than most of those inserted in his bulky work: his account is as follows—"The head is of a pale red, bearing a fine tuft of brighter red, va∣riegated with black. The bill is pale red; the upper side of the body is bright red; the coverts of the wings and the under side of the body are pale red; the quills of the wings and those of the tail are yellow, shaded with a blackish tint."</P>
<P>This bird is not so large as the magpie, its total length being about ten inches.</P>
<P>We must observe that Seba takes no notice of the disposition of its toes, and in his figure they are disposed by three and one, not by two and two. But the asserting the bird to be a <HI>Cuckoo,</HI> implied the latter.</P>

<HEAD>The TOURACO. <HI>Cuculus-Persa,</HI> Linn. and Gmel. <HI>Cuculus Guineensis Cristatus Viridis,</HI> Briss. The <HI>Crown Bird from Mexico,</HI> Alb.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the most beautiful of the African birds; for besides that its plum∣age is brilliant and its eyes sparkle with fire, it has a sort of crest on the head, or rather a crown, which confers an air of distinction. I cannot conceive, therefore, why our nomencla∣tors range it with the cuckoos, which, every body knows, are ugly birds; it is also discrimi∣nated by its tuft, and by the shape of its bill, of which the upper part is more arched than in the cuckoos. Indeed the only common character is that it has two toes before and two behind; a property which belongs to many birds.</P>
<P>The Touraco is as large as a jay; but its long broad tail seems to increase its bulk: its wings are however very short, not reaching to the ori∣gin of the tail. The upper mandible is convex, and covered with feathers reflected from the forehead, and in which the nostrils are conceal∣ed. Its eye, which is lively and full of fire, is encircled by a scarlet eye-lid, which has a great number of protuberant <HI>papillae</HI> of the same co∣lour. The beautiful tuft, or rather <HI>mitre,</HI> that
<PB N="258" REF="287"/>
crowns its head is a bunch of bristled feathers, which are fine and silky, and consist of such delicate fibres that the whole is transparent. The beautiful green which covers all the neck, the breast, and the shoulders, is also composed of fibres of the same kind, and equally fine and silky.</P>
<P>We know two species, or rather two varieties, of the genus; the one termed the <HI>Abyssinian Tou∣raco,</HI> and the second the <HI>Touraco from the Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>The only difference lies in the tints, for the bulk of the colours is the same. The Abyssi∣nian Touraco has a blackish tuft, compact like a lock, and reflected backwards: the feathers on the forehead, the throat, and compass of the neck, are meadow green; the breast, and top of the back, are of the same colour, but with an olive tinge, which melts into a purple brown, heightened by a fine green gloss; all the back, the coverts of the wings, and their quills next the body, and all those of the tail, are coloured in the same way; all the primaries are of a fine crimson, with a black indenting on the small webs, near the tip: we cannot conceive how Brisson saw only four of these red feathers. The under side is dun gray, slightly shaded with light gray.</P>
<P>The Touraco of the Cape of Good Hope dif∣fers not from the Abyssinian one, except that
<PB N="259" REF="288"/>
the tuft is of a light green, and sometimes fringed with white. The neck is of the same green, which melts on the shoulders into a darkish tint, with glossy green reflections.</P>
<P>We had a Touraco alive from the Cape, and were assured that it lived upon rice. No other food was offered to it at first, and this it would not touch, but grew famished, and, in that ex∣tremity, it ate its own excrements. During three days, it subsisted only on water and a bit of sugar. But observing grapes brought to the table, it shewed a strong appetite for them; some were given to it, which it swallowed greedily. It discovered in the same way a fondness for apples, and afterwards for oranges. From that time it was fed on fruit for several months. This seemed to be the natural food, its curved bill not being in the least adapted for collecting grain. The bill is wide, and cleft as far as under the eyes; the bird hops, but does not walk; its nails are sharp and strong, its hold firm; its toes are stout, and invested with thick scales. It is lively, and bustles much; it continually utters a weak, low, and hoarse cry, <HI>crêu, crêu,</HI> from the bottom of its gizzard, without opening its bill. But sometimes it has a very loud scream, <HI>cõ, cõ, cŏ, cŏ, cŏ, cŏ, cŏ;</HI> the first notes low, the others higher, rapid, and noisy, with a shrill and harsh voice. It vents this cry of its own accord, when it is hungry;
<PB N="260" REF="289"/>
but it may be made to repeat it at pleasure, if one prompts it by imitation.</P>
<P>This beautiful bird was given to me by the Princess of Tingri, to whom my most respect∣ful thanks are due. It is even handsomer than at first, for it was in moult when I made the foregoing description. At present, which is four months since that time, the plumage is restored with fresh beauties; there are two white streaks of small feathers, or short silky hairs, the one pretty near the inner corner of the eye, the other before the eye, and extend∣ing backwards to the outer corner; between these two is another streak of the same down, but of a deep violet cast; the upper surface of the body and of the tail shines with a rich pur∣plish blue, and the crest is green and not fring∣ed. These new characters dispose me to think that it does not resemble the Touraco from the Cape of Good Hope so much as I at first sup∣posed; it seems also to differ in the same pro∣perties from the Abyssinian Touraco. We have therefore three varieties; but we cannot determine whether the diversity belongs to the species or to the individual, whether it is pe∣riodical or constant, or only sexual.</P>
<P>It does not appear that this bird is found in America, though Albin gives it as brought from Mexico. Edwards affirms that it is indige∣nous in Guinea, from whence the individual
<PB N="261" REF="290"/>
mentioned by Albin was possibly transported into the new world. We are unacquainted with the habits of the bird, when it enjoys its native freedom; but as it is exceedingly beau∣tiful, we may hope that travellers will observe them, and communicate their remarks. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Persa:</HI> "Its tail is equal; its head crested; its body bluish green; its wing-quills blood coloured."</NOTE></P>

<P>IN the age of Aristotle it was generally said that no one had ever seen the hatch of the Cuckoo: it was known that this bird lays like the rest, but makes no nest; that it drops its eggs, or its egg (for it seldom deposits two in the same place) in the nests of other birds, whe∣ther
<PB N="263" REF="292"/>
larger or smaller than itself, such as the warblers, the green-finches, the larks, the wood pigeons, &amp;c.; that it often sucks the eggs which it finds, and leaves its own in their stead, to be hatched by the stranger; that this stranger, particularly the pettychaps, acts the part of a tender mother to her supposititious brood, so that the young ones become very fat and plump <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said even that the adults are not bad eating in autumn; but there are countries where, at no period of their age, in no con∣dition of their flesh, at no season of the year, they are ever eaten, being regarded as birds unclean and unlucky: in others they are held propitious, and venerated as oracles: and some countries there are, where it is imagined that the soil under the person's right foot, who first hears the Cuckoo's note, is a certain preservative against sleas and vermin.</NOTE>; that their plumage changes much when they arrive at maturity; and lastly, that the Cuckoos begin to appear and are heard early in the spring; that they are feeble on their arrival; that they are silent during the dog-days; and that a cer∣tain species of them build in craggy rocks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">May not this be the Andalusian Cuckoo of Brisson, and the Great Spotted Cuckoo of Edwards? The subject mentioned by the latter was killed on the rock of Gibraltar, and its fellows might have been bred in Greece, whose climate is so nearly the same: lastly, might not these have been sparrow-hawks, mistaken for Cuckoos by reason of the resemblance of their plumage; and it is known that sparrow hawks breed in the holes of craggy rocks.</NOTE>. Such are the principal facts in the history of the Cuckoo: they were known two thousand years ago, and succeeding ages have added nothing to the stock. Some circumstances had even fallen into oblivion, particularly their breeding in holes
<PB N="264" REF="293"/>
of precipices. Nor have even the fabulous sto∣ries related of this singular bird undergone any alteration: error has its limits as well as truth, and, on a subject of so great celebrity, both have been exhausted.</P>
<P>Twenty centuries ago it was asserted, as at present, that the Cuckoo is nothing else than a little sparrow-hawk metamorphosed; that this change is effected every year at a certain stated season; that when it appears in the spring, it is conveyed on the shoulders of the kite, which, to assist the weakness of its wings, is so oblig∣ing as to carry it (remarkable complaisance in a bird of prey like the kite); that it discharges upon plants a saliva which proves pernicious to them by engendering insects; that the female Cuckoo takes care to lay into each nest she can discover, an egg like those contained in it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Aelian, Salerne, &amp;c. The true egg of the Cuckoo is larger than that of the nightingale; of a longer shape, of a gray colour almost whitish, spotted near the large end with violet-brown, very obscure, and with deeper and more apparent brown; and lastly, marked in the middle with some irregular streaks of ches∣nut.</NOTE>, the better to deceive the mother; that the mother nurses the young Cuckoo, and sacrifices her own brood to it, because they appear not so handsome <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observe that the Cuckoos are frightful when first hatched, and even many days after.</NOTE>; that, like a true step-mother, she neglects them, or kills them, and directs the intruder to eat them: some supposed that the
<PB N="265" REF="294"/>
female Cuckoo returned to the nest where she had deposited her egg, and expelled or devoured the other young, that her own might fare the better: others fancied that the little pretender destroyed its foster-brothers, or rendered them victims to its voracity, by seizing exclusively all the food provided by their common nurse. Elian relates that the young Cuckoo, sensible that it is a bastard, or rather an intruder, and afraid of being betrayed by its plumage and treated as such, flies away as soon as it can use its wings, and joins its real mother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Anim. Lib. III.</HI> 30. It is also said, by running into an opposite extreme, that the Hen-cuckoo, neglecting her own eggs, hatches those of others. <HI>See</HI> Acron, <HI>in Sat. VII. Horat. Lib. I.</HI></NOTE>. Others pretend that the nurse discovers the fraud from the colours of the plumage, and abandons the intruder. Lastly, others imagine that the young bird, before it flies, devours even its second pa∣rent <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, and others.</NOTE>, which had given it every thing but life; and the Cuckoo has been made the great symbol of ingratitude <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"Ungrateful as a Cuckoo," say the Germans. Melancthon has lest a fine harangue on the ingratitude of this bird.</NOTE>.—But it is absurd to impute crimes that are physically impossible. How could the young Cuckoo, which can hardly feed without assistance, have strength sufficient to devour a wood-pigeon, a lark, a yellow bunting, or a pettychaps? It is true, that, in support of the possibility of the fact, the evidence of a grave author, Klein, may be
<PB N="266" REF="295"/>
adduced, who made the observation at the age of sixteen. Having discovered in his father's garden a pettychaps' nest with a single egg, which was suspected to belong to a Cuckoo, he suffered the incubation to proceed, and even waited till the bird was feathered. He then shut both it and the nest in a cage, which he placed on the same spot. A few days after he found the hen-pettychaps entangled in the wires of the cage, and its head sticking in the throat of the young Cuckoo, which had swallowed it through mistake, while catching greedily at a caterpillar that was probably too near. To some accident of this kind the Cuckoo owes its bad name. But it is not true that it devours its nurse, or its foster brothers: for, in the first place, its bill, though large, is too weak; the one mentioned by Klein could not crush the head of the pettychaps, and was choked by it; in the second place, to remove all objections and scruples, I have decided the point by expe∣riment. On the 27th of June, I put a young Cuckoo, which had been hatched in the spring, and was already nine inches long, in an open cage, with three young pettychaps, which were not one quarter feathered, and could not eat without assistance. The Cuckoo, far from devouring them, or even threatening them, seemed eager to repay its obligations to the spe∣cies. It suffered the little birds, which were not in the least afraid, to warm themselves un∣der
<PB N="267" REF="296"/>
its wings. On the other hand, a young owl, which had as yet only been fed, began of itself to eat by devouring a pettychaps, which was lodged with it. I know that some qualify the account by saying that the Cuckoo swallows the chicks just as they burst from the shell; and as these little embryos might be regarded as beings intermediate between eggs and birds, they might therefore be eaten by an animal which habitually feeds on eggs, whether hatched or not. But though this state∣ment is less improbable, it ought not to be ad∣mitted till it is evinced by observation.</P>
<P>With respect to the saliva of the Cuckoo, it is nothing else than a frothy exudation from the <HI>larva</HI> of a certain kind of grassshopper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This insect is the <HI>Cicada Spumaria</HI> of Linnaeus. It inhabits Europe, and is frequent on brambles, withies, and grass stalks; it settles in the forking of the stalks, and evacuates numerous vesi∣cles, resembling froth, under which the larva lies concealed. This spittle, so frequent in the fields, is termed in French <HI>ecume print-ann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere,</HI> or spring froth, and the insect which emerges is denomi∣nated <HI>sauterelle-puce</HI> (grasshopper flea), or <HI>cigale bedaude.</HI> This in∣sect, it is said, kills the Cuckoo by pricking it beneath the wing; which at best is only some misrepresented fact.—This frothy sub∣stance is well known in England by the name of <HI>Cuckoo-spittle,</HI> or <HI>woodsare.</HI></NOTE>. Per∣haps the Cuckoo was observed to seek the larva under this froth, which might give occasion to its being supposed to deposit its saliva; and as an insect was perceived to emerge, it would be imagined, that the saliva of the Cuckoo engen∣dered vermin.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="297"/>
I will not seriously combat the notion, that the Cuckoo is annually metamorphosed into a sparrow-hawk <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have just witnessed an odd enough scene. A sparrow-hawk alighted in a pretty populous court yard; a young cock of this year's hatching instantly darted at him, and threw him on his back; in this situation the hawk, shielding himself with his talons and his bill, intimidated the hens and turkies, which screamed tumultu∣ously round him: when he had a little recovered himself, he rose and was taking wing, when the cock rushed upon him a second time, overturned him, and held him down so long that he was caught.</NOTE>. It is an absurdity which ne∣ver was believed by the real naturalists, and some of them have confuted it. I shall only ob∣serve that the opinion seems to have taken rise from the following circumstances: the two birds are seldom found in our climates at the same time; they resemble each other in their plum∣age <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Especially seen from below when they fly. The Cuckoo rustles with its wings in rising, and then shoots along like the tiercel falcon.</NOTE>, in the colour of their eyes and legs, in the length of their tail, in having a membran∣ous stomach, and a long tail, in their size, in their flight, and in their little fecundity; both live solitary, and have long feathers that descend from the legs on the tarsus, &amp;c.; their plum∣age is also subject to vary, so that a bird which was taken for a beautiful merlin from its co∣lours, was found on dissection to be a female Cuckoo <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Salerne, <HI>Hist. des Oiseaux, p.</HI> 40. M. Herissant saw many Cuckoos which, by their plumage, resembled different kinds of male hawks, and one that resembled a wood pigeon. <HI>Mem. de l' Acad. des Sciences,</HI> 1752, p. 417.</NOTE>. But these qualities are not what
<PB N="269" REF="298"/>
constitute a bird of prey; there are wanting the proper bill and talons, and the requisite courage and strength, in which the Cuckoo, consider∣ing its bulk, is very deficient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle justly observes that it is a timid bird; but I know not why he cites, as a proof of this timidity, its laying in the nest of another. <HI>De Generatione,</HI> Lib. III. 1.</NOTE>. M. Lottinger has observed that Cuckoos of five or six months old are as helpless as young pigeons; that they remain for hours in the same spot, and have so little appetite, that they must be assisted in swal∣lowing. It is true that when they grow up, they assume a little more resolution, and may sometimes pass for birds of rapine. The Viscount de Querhoent, whose testimony has the greatest weight, saw one which, being apprehensive of an attack from another bird, bristled its feathers, and raised and depressed its head slowly and re∣peatedly, and then screamed out; so that in this manner it often put to flight a kestril, which was kept in the same house <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An adult Cuckoo, raised by M. Lottinger, charged all other birds, the strongest equally as the weakest, those of its own kind or those of another, aiming preferably at the head and eyes. It rushed even upon stuffed birds, and, though roughly repelled, it would never desist from the attack. For my own part, I know from experience that the Cuckoos menace the hand extended to catch them, that they rise and sink alternately, bristling their fea∣thers, and that they even bite in a sort of anger, though with lit∣tle effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Cuckoo, far from being ungrateful, seems conscious and mindful of its obligations. On its return from its winter retreat, it eagerly
<PB N="270" REF="299"/>
hastens, it is said, to the place of its birth, and if it finds its nurse or foster-brothers, they all join in mutual gratulations, each venting its joy in its own manner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch.</NOTE>. These different expres∣sions, these reciprocal caresses, these salutations of gladness, and these sportive frolics, are what have no doubt been mistaken for battles between the small birds and the Cuckoo. A real com∣bat, however, may sometimes take place, as when the birds surprise a Cuckoo about to de∣stroy their eggs, in order to deposit its own <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, Pliny, and those who have copied or amplified from them, agree that the Cuckoo is timid; that all the small birds an∣noy them, and that it can put none of these to flight: others add, that this persecution originates from its resemblance to a bird of prey; but when did the small birds ever pursue the birds of prey?</NOTE>. This well-ascertained fact, that it lays in an∣other's nest, is the chief singularity in its his∣tory, though not altogether unexampled. Ges∣ner speaks of a certain bird of prey, which is much like the goss-hawk, that lays in the nest of the jackdaw: and though this unknown bird should be supposed to be nothing but the Cuckoo, especially as this is often taken for one of the rapacious tribe; it at least cannot be de∣nied that the wry-necks sometimes raise their numerous progeny in the nest of the nuthatch, as I myself have ascertained; that the sparrows sometimes occupy the swallows' nests, &amp;c. These instances, however, are very rare, and
<PB N="271" REF="300"/>
the conduct of the Cuckoo must be regarded as an extraordinary phenomenon.</P>
<P>Another singularity in its history is, that it drops only one egg, at least in the same nest. It may indeed lay two eggs, as Aristotle sup∣poses, and which appears possible from the dis∣section of females, of which the ovarium fre∣quently contained two eggs, well formed and of equal size <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus and Salerne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These two singularities seem to imply a third: it is that their moulting is slower and more com∣plete than in most birds. Sometimes in the winter season we find, in the hollows of trees, one or two Cuckoos entirely naked, insomuch that they may be taken for real toads. Father Bougaud, whom we have often quoted with that confidence which he merits, avers that he saw one in that state, which was taken out of a hollow tree about the end of December. Of four other Cuckoos raised, the one by Johnson, as mentioned by Willughby, the other by the Count de Buffon, the third by Hebert, and the fourth by myself; the first languished on the approach of winter, grew scabby, and died; the second and third cast the whole of their feathers in November, and the fourth, which died to∣wards the end of October, had lost more than half. The second and third also soon died; but, previous to their death, they fell into a
<PB N="272" REF="301"/>
kind of numbness and torpor. Many other si∣milar facts are adduced; and though it has been erroneously concluded that all the Cuckoos which made their appearance in summer re∣main torpid during the winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those who speak of these Cuckoos found in winter lodged in holes, agree that they are absolutely naked, and resemble toads. This account makes me suspect that the supposed Cuckoos were of∣ten toads or frogs, which really pass the winter without food, their mouth being then shut, and their jaws, as it were, glued together.—Aristotle positively asserts that the Cuckoos never appear during winter in Greece.</NOTE>, concealed in hollow trees or under ground, disrobed of their plumage, and, according to some, with an am∣ple provision of corn (which this species never eats): if these conclusions ought not to be ad∣mitted, we may at least safely infer that those which, on the moment of their departure, are sick or wounded, or too young, or in short too weak, from whatever cause, to perform their distant re∣treat, remain behind, and pass the winter sheltered in the first hole they meet with which has a good aspect, as do the quails <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In winter, sportsmen sometimes meet with quails squatted un∣der a large root, or in some other hole facing the south, with a little provision of grain and heads of different sorts of corn. I must own that the Marquis de Piolenc and another person assured me that two Cuckoos which they reared and kept several years did not drop all their feathers in the winter: but as they remarked not the time, nor the duration, nor the quantity of the moult, we can draw no conclusion from these two observations.</NOTE>: 2. That, in general, these birds are very late in moulting, and con∣sequently slow in resuming their plumage, which is hardly restored on their appearance in the be∣ginning
<PB N="273" REF="302"/>
of spring; accordingly, their wings are then very weak, and they seldom perch on lofty trees, but struggle from bush to bush, and sometimes alight on the ground, where they hop like the thrushes. We may therefore say that, during the love season, the surplus food is almost entirely spent on the growth of the fea∣thers, and can furnish very little towards the reproduction of the species; that, for this rea∣son, the female Cuckoo never lays above one egg, or at most two; and that, as the bird has little abilities for generation, it has also less ar∣dour for all the subordinate functions, which have the preservation of the species as their ob∣ject, such as nestling, hatching, and rearing their young, &amp;c. which all originate from the same source, and are proportioned to it. Be∣sides, as the male instinctively devours birds' eggs, the female must be careful to conceal hers; she must not return to the spot where she has deposited one, lest the male discover it; she must therefore choose the most concealed nest, and which is also the most remote from his usual haunts; and if she has two eggs, she must entrust them to different nurses: and thus she takes all the precautions suggested by con∣cern for her progeny, and yet carefully avoids betraying it through indiscretion. Viewed in this way, the conduct of the Cuckoo will coin∣cide with the general rule, and imply in the mother an affection for her young, and even a
<PB N="274" REF="303"/>
rational kind of concern, which prefers their interest to the tender satisfaction of fondling and assisting them by her offices. The dispersion too of the eggs in different nests, whatever be the cause, whether the necessity of concealing them from the male, or the smallness of the nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Persons of veracity have told me that they twice saw two Cuckoos in a single nest, but both times in the nest of a throstle: but the throstle's nest is larger than that of the pettychaps, of the willow-wren, or of the red-breast.</NOTE>, would alone render it impossible for the female to hatch them. This fact is the more probable, as two eggs are often found completely formed in the ovarium, but very seldom two eggs in the same nest. Besides, the Cuckoo is not the only bird which never builds; many species of titmice, wood-peckers, king-fishers, &amp;c. come under the same description. We have already seen that it is not the only one that lays in other's nests; there is also another example of a bird which never hatches its eggs; the ostrich, in the torrid zone, deposits its eggs in the sand, and the heat of the sun accomplishes the deve∣lopement of the embryos. It never loses sight of them indeed, and guards them assiduously; but it has not the same motives as the Cuckoo to conceal its attachment, and therefore does not take all the precautions which might ex∣empt it from farther solicitude. The conduct of the Cuckoo is not then an absurd irregularity, a monstrous anomaly, a deviation from the laws
<PB N="275" REF="304"/>
of nature, as Willughby expresses it; it is the necessary consequence of established principles, and the want of it would occasion a void in the general system, and interrupt the chain of phae∣nomena.</P>
<P>What seems to have astonished some natu∣ralists the most, is that attention which they term unnatural in the nurse of the Cuckoo, which neglects its own eggs to cherish those of a foreign, and even hostile bird. One of these, an excellent ornithologist, struck with the appear∣ance, has made a series of observations on this subject: he took the eggs of several small birds out of their nests, and in their place substituted a single egg of a bird of a different kind, and not a Cuckoo; and he inferred from his expe∣riments that, in similar circumstances, birds will hatch no single egg but the Cuckoo's, which is therefore favoured by a special law of the Creator.</P>
<P>But this conclusion will appear rash and pre∣carious, if we attend to the following consider∣ations: 1. the assertion being general, one con∣trary fact is sufficient to overturn it; and for this reason, forty-six experiments made on twen∣ty species are too few: 2. It would require many more, and those performed with greater nicety, to establish a proposition which is an ex∣emption to the general laws of nature: 3. Ad∣mitting the experiments to be sufficiently nu∣merous and accurate, they would be inconclusive, if not made precisely in the same manner, and
<PB N="276" REF="305"/>
in like circumstances. For instance, the case in not similar when the egg is left by a bird or dropped by a man, especially by one who is bi∣assed to a favourite hypothesis; nay the fre∣quent appearance of a person will disturb the most eager brooder, and even cause her to aban∣don the education of a Cuckoo, though far advanced <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A meadow green-finch, whose nest was on the ground under a thick root, abandoned the education of a young Cuckoo, merely from the inquietude occasioned by the repeated visits of some cu∣rious persons.</NOTE>, as I have myself experienced: 4. The fundamental assertions of this author are not quite accurate; for, though it seldom hap∣pens, the Cuckoo sometimes lays two eggs in the same nest. Further, he supposes that the Cuckoo sucks all the eggs in the nest, or de∣stroys them somehow, leaving only its own; but this is hardly susceptible of proof, and is improbable. But I have often received nests, in which were several besides the Cuckoo's egg which properly belonged to these nests <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>16 May, 1774, five eggs of a titmouse with one of the Cuckoo; the eggs of the titmouse disappeared by degrees.</P>

<P>Lastly, a hen red-breast, ardently bent on brooding, has been seen to unite with her mate in repelling a female Cuckoo from the nest; they screamed, attacked furiously, and hotly pursued her <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Observations sur l'instinct des Animaux, t. I. p. 167, note 32. The author of that note adds some details relative to the his∣tory of our bird: "While one of the red-breasts was striking with its bill the lower belly of the Cuckoo, this bird shivered its wings with an almost insensible quiver, opened its bill so wide that an∣other red-breast, which assailed it in front, drove its head several times into the cavity, without receiving any injury; for the Cuckoo was no way irritated, but seemed to be in the condition of a fe∣male under the necessity of laying. In a little while the Cuckoo, being exhausted, began to totter, lost its balance, and turned on the branch, from which it hung by the feet, its eyes half-shut, its bill open, and its wings expanded. Having remained about two mi∣nutes in this attitude, constantly harassed by the two red-breasts, it quitted the branch, flew to perch at a distance, and appeared no more. The female red-breast resumed her incubation, and all her eggs were hatched, and formed a little family, that long lived at∣tached to this district." M. le Marquis de Piolenc also tells me in his letters of a Cuckoo being repelled by buntings.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="281" REF="310"/>
<P>It follows from these experiments, 1. That the females of many species of small birds which hatch the Cuckoo's egg, hatch likewise other eggs along with their own: 2. That they often sit on these eggs in preference to their own, which they sometimes entirely destroy: 3. That they will hatch a single egg, though it be not a Cuckoo's: 4. That they boldly drive off the fe∣male Cuckoo, when they surprise her dropping the egg in their nest: 5. Lastly, that they some∣times eat this favoured egg, even in cases where it is single and alone. But a more general and important consequence is, that the instinct of hatching which sometimes appears so powerful in birds, is not determined by the kind or qua∣lity of the eggs; since they often eat or break them, or sit on addle ones; they sit even on balls of chalk or wood, and sometimes brood in the empty nest. When a bird hatches the egg of a Cuckoo, or of any other bird, she follows therefore the general instinct; and it is unne∣cessary to recur to any special appointment of

the Author of Nature in accounting for the conduct of the female Cuckoo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch supposes another particular law, to explain why the present Cuckoos never hatch their eggs; it is, he says, because a bird never hatches unless itself has been hatched by a female of its own species. He admits indeed that the first female Cuckoo emit∣ted from Noah's ark must have laid in its own nest, and must itself have taken the trouble of hatching its eggs. He might have spared this exception, for there are many instances of small birds succeed∣ing with their own eggs along with that of the Cuckoo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I ask my reader's pardon for this long discus∣sion, of the importance of which he may not be convinced. The bird which is the subject of this article has given rise to so many errors, that I have thought it necessary, not only to extir∣pate these from natural history, but to oppose the attempts of those who endeavour to convert them into metaphysical principles. Nothing is more inconsistent with sound philosophy, than to multiply the laws of the universe; a phae∣nomenon appears single and unconnected, be∣cause it is not accurately known; and it re∣quires an attentive comparison of the works of nature, a close investigation of the relations which subsist, to enable us to penetrate into her views.</P>
<P>I know more than twenty species of birds, in the nests of which the Cuckoo deposits her eggs; the pettychaps, the blackcap, the babbling warbler, the wagtail, the red-breast, the com∣mon wren, the yellow wren, the titmouse,
<PB N="283" REF="312"/>
the nightingale, the red-tail, the sky-lark, the wood-lark, the tit-lark, the linnet, the green-finch, the bulfinch, the throstle, the jay, the black-bird, and the shrike. The Cuckoo's eggs are never found in the nests of partridges or quails, at least they never succeed in them, be∣cause the young of these birds run almost the instant they are hatched. It is even singular that the young Cuckoos, which, when bred in the cage, require several months before they eat without assistance, can ever be raised in the nests of larks, which, as we have seen in their his∣tory, bestow only fifteen days on their educa∣tion. But in the state of nature, necessity, li∣berty, and the proper choice of food, will con∣spire to unfold their instinct, and hasten their growth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I must own that Salerne says, that this bird is fed whole months by its adoptive mother, which it follows crying incessantly for food. But this fact would be difficult to observe.</NOTE>; and may not the attention of the nurse be proportioned to the wants of her adopt∣ed child?</P>
<P>We shall perhaps be surprised to find ma∣ny granivorous birds, such as the linnet, the greenfinch, and the bulfinch, in the list of the Cuckoo's nurses. But many of these, it should be remembered, feed their brood with in∣sects; and even the vegetable substances mace∣rated in their craw, may suit the Cuckoo for a certain time, till it can pick up caterpillars,
<PB N="284" REF="313"/>
spiders, and beetles, &amp;c. which swarm about its mansion.</P>
<P>When the nest, where it is lodged, belongs to a small bird, and consequently is constructed on a narrow scale, it is usually found so much flat∣tened that it can hardly be recognised; the na∣tural effect of the bulk and weight of the young Cuckoo. Another consequence is, that the eggs or young birds are frequently thrust out of the nest; but, though expelled from their paternal abode, they sometimes survive; for if they be somewhat grown, if the nest be near the ground, and if the aspect is favourable and the season mild, they find shelter under the moss or fo∣liage, and the parents, without forsaking the intruder, continue to feed and watch them.</P>
<P>All the inhabitants of forests assert, that when the female Cuckoo has once deposited her egg in the nest which she has selected, she re∣tires to a distance, and seems to forget her pro∣geny; and that the male never discovers the smallest concern in the matter. But M. Lot∣tinger has observed that, though the parent Cuckoos do not visit their offspring, they ap∣proach within a certain distance of the spot, calling, and seem to listen and reply to each other. He adds that the young Cuckoo con∣stantly answers to the call, whether in the woods or in a volery, provided it be not disturbed by the sight of a person. It is certain that the old
<PB N="285" REF="314"/>
ones can be enticed by imitating their call, and that they sometimes chant in the vicinity of the nest; but there is no proof that these are the parents of the young bird. They never render those tender offices which mark parental at∣tachment, and their calls proceed only from the sympathy common between birds of the same species.</P>
<P>Every body knows the ordinary song of the Cuckoo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cou cou, cou cou, cou cou cou, tou cou cou (ou,</HI> in French, pro∣nounced <HI>oo).</HI> This frequent repetition has given rise to two modes of proverbial expressions: when a person dwells upon the same subject, he is said in German <HI>to sing the Cuckoo's song.</HI> The same phrase is applied to a small body of people, who, by their tumultu∣ary vociferation, seem to form a numerous assembly.</NOTE>; it is so distinctly formed, and so of∣ten repeated, that, in almost all languages, it has given name to the bird. It belongs ex∣clusively to the male, and is heard only during the spring, the season of love, and either when he sits on a dry branch, or while he moves on the wing: sometimes it is interrupted by a dull rattling sound, <HI>crou, crou,</HI> uttered with a hoarse lisping voice. There is also another occasional cry, which is loud but rather quavering, and composed of several notes, like that of the lit∣tle diver: it is heard when the male and female pursue each other in amorous frolic <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Those who have heard it express it thus; <HI>go, go, guet, guet. guet.</HI></NOTE>. Some have also suspected it to be the cry of the fe∣male. When she is animated she has besides a
<PB N="286" REF="315"/>
sort of clucking, <HI>glou, glou,</HI> which is repeated five or six times with a strong clear voice, while she flies from tree to tree. This would seem intended to incite the male; for as soon as he hears the call he hastens to her with ardour, uttering <HI>tou, cou, cou</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by the Count de Riollet, who makes a laudable amusement of observing what so many others only look at.</NOTE>. But notwithstanding this variety of inflection, the song of the Cuckoo ought never to be compared with that of the nightingale, except in the fable <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is said that the nightingale and the Cuckoo disputed the merits of the song in presence of the ass, which adjudged the prize to the Cuckoo; but that the nightingale appealed to man, who pronounced in its savour, since which time the nightingale sings as soon as it sees a man, in gratitude for his decision, or in justifica∣tion of it.</NOTE>. It is very uncertain whether these birds ever pair; they are stimulated by appetite, but they shew no∣thing like sentiment or attachment. The males are much more numerous than the females, and often contend for them <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Seldom or never do persons kill or take any but the singing Cuckoos, and, by consequence, the males. I have seen three or four killed in a single excursion, and not one female among them. "In a trap, which we placed on a tree frequented by Cuckoos," says the author of the British Zoology, "we caught not sewer than five male birds in one season."</NOTE>; yet the object of the struggle is a female in general, without any symptom of choice or predilection; and when their passion is satisfied, they desert her with the coldest indifference. They discover no so∣licitude, and make no provision, for their off∣spring. The mutual attachment between pa∣rents
<PB N="287" REF="316"/>
is founded on the common tenderness to their young.</P>
<P>The young Cuckoos, soon after their exclu∣sion, have also a call not shriller than that of the pettychaps and red-breasts, their nurses, whose tone they assume from the force of imitation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The singular structure of their nostrils contributes perhaps," says M. Frisch, "to produce this sharp cry." It is true that the nostrils of the Cuckoo have, with regard to their exterior, a pretty singular structure; but I am convinced that they contribute not in the least to modify this cry, which continued the same after I had stopt the nostrils with wax. I have discovered, by repeating this experiment upon other birds, and particularly upon the wren, that the cry remains unvaried, whether the nostrils be shut or left open. It is besides known that the voice of birds is formed not in the nos∣trils, or at the <HI>glottis,</HI> but at the lower part of the <HI>trachea arteria,</HI> near its forking.</NOTE>: and as if sensible of the necessity of soliciting and importuning an adoptive mother, who cannot have the compassion of a real parent, they con∣tinually repeat their entreaty; and, to remove ambiguity, their broad bill is opened to its ut∣most width, and the expression is rendered still more significant by the clapping of their wings. After their wings have acquired some strength, they pursue their nurse among the neighbour∣ing branches, or meet her when she brings food. The young Cuckoos are voracious <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hence the proverb <HI>to swallow like a Cuckoo.</HI></NOTE>, and can hardly be maintained by little birds, such as the red-breast, the pettychaps, the common and yellow wrens, which have besides a fa∣mily to support. They retain their call, ac∣cording
<PB N="288" REF="317"/>
to Frisch, till the fifteenth or twentieth of September; it then begins to grow flat, and is soon lost entirely.</P>
<P>Most ornithologists agree, that insects are the chief part of the Cuckoo's food, and that, as I have already remarked, it is peculiarly fond of birds' eggs. Ray found caterpillars in its sto∣mach; I have also perceived vestiges of veget∣able substances, small beetles, &amp;c. and some∣times pebbles. Frisch asserts that the young Cuckoos ought, in every season, to be fed in the morning and evening at the same time as in the longest days of summer. That author has also observed the way in which they eat the insects alive: they lay hold of the caterpillar by the head, and, drawing it into their bill, they squeeze the juicy matter through the anus, and then shake it several times before they swal∣low it. They also seize butterflies by the head, and, pressing with their bill, they crush the breast, and swallow the whole together with the wings. They likewise eat worms; but they prefer such as are alive. When insects could not be had, Frisch gave a young Cuckoo which he raised, sheep's liver, and especially kid∣neys, cutting them into small strips like the in∣sects for which they were substituted. When these were too dry, he soaked them a little, that they might be easily swallowed. The bird never drank unless its food was too dry, and then it drank awkwardly and with reluctance.
<PB N="289" REF="318"/>
In every other case it rejected water, and shook off the drops which were forcibly or artfully in∣troduced into its bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have remarked this fact, as well as the Carthusian of Sa∣lerne. May not this be the reason why a decoction of the Cuckoo's dung in wine has been recommended as a sure remedy for the hy∣drophobia?</NOTE>; in short, it is habitually under the impression of a hydrophobia.</P>
<P>The young Cuckoos never sing during their first year, and the old ones cease towards the end of June, at least their song is then unfre∣quent. But this silence does not announce their departure; they are found in the open country until the end of September, and even later <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Querhoent and Hebert.</NOTE>. It is the scarcity of insects, no doubt, which determines them to retire to warmer climates: they migrate for the most part into Africa, since the Commanders of Godeheu and des Mazys reckon them among those birds which are seen twice a year passing and repassing the island of Malta <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Salerne relates, from Voyagers, that the Cuckoos sometimes alight in great numbers on ships.</NOTE>. On their arrival in our cli∣mates they approach nearest our dwellings; dur∣ing the rest of their stay they fly about among the woods, the meadows, &amp;c. and wherever they can discover nests to plunder or deposit their egg, or find insects and fruits.

The ancients watched the times of the appearance and disappearance of the Cuckoo in Italy. The vine-dressers who had not lopped their vines before its arrival were reckoned lazy, and held the object of public derision. The by-passers who saw the back∣ward state of the vineyard, mocked the owner's indolence by repeating the call of that bird, which was itself, and with much propriety, re∣garded as the emblem of sloth, since it dispenses with the sacred obligations of nature. It was an usual expression also, <HI>crafty as a Cuckoo</HI> (for cunning and indolence may subsist together);
<PB N="291" REF="320"/>
either because, declining the task itself, it con∣trives to make other birds hatch its eggs; or for another reason furnished by the ancient mythology <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jupiter having perceived that his sister Juno was alone on the Dictean mount, or Thronax, raised a violent storm, and came in shape of a Cuckoo, and alighted on the knees of the goddess, who seeing it drenched and beaten by the tempest, pitied it, and che∣rished it under her robe: the god then resumed his proper form, and became the husband of his sister. From that moment the Dictean mount was called <HI>Coccygian,</HI> or <HI>Cuckoo-mountain;</HI> and hence the origin of the <HI>Jupiter-cuculus. See</HI> Gesner, p. 368.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though subtle, though solitary, the Cuckoos are susceptible of a sort of education. Many per∣sons of my acquaintance have reared and tamed them; they are fed with minced meat, either cooked or raw, with insects, eggs, soaked bread, fruits, &amp;c. One of the Cuckoos thus bred knew its master, answered his call, followed him to the sport, perched on his fowling-piece, and if it found a black cherry tree on the road, it flew to it, and returned not till satiated with the fruit; sometimes it did not join its master again the whole day, but followed him at a dis∣tance, shifting from tree to tree: when at home it was permitted to run about, and to roost at night. The dung of this bird is white and abundant, which is a great inconvenience in its education; it must be carefully guarded-against the cold during the transition of autumn into winter: this is a critical period for the Cuckoo; at least I lost at this time all those
<PB N="292" REF="321"/>
which I tried to rear, and indeed many of other kinds.</P>
<P>Olina says that the Cuckoo may be trained for the chase like the sparrow-hawks and the falcons; but he is the only person who makes that assertion, which, perhaps, as well as many other errors in the history of this bird, has its source in the resemblance of its plumage to that of the sparrow-hawk.</P>
<P>The Cuckoos are generally diffused in the an∣cient continent; and though those of America have different habits, many of them still retain a certain family likeness. The common kind appear only during summer in the colder tempe∣rate climates, such as those of Europe; and they reside in the winter only in the warmer coun∣tries, such as those of the north of Africa: they seem to shun both extremes alike.</P>
<P>When the Cuckoos alight on the ground, they hop, as I have remarked; but this seldom happens: and even though it were not ascer∣tained by experience, we might infer it from the shortness of their legs and thighs. A young Cuckoo, which I had occasion to observe in the month of June, made no use of its legs in walk∣ing, but crept on its belly, assisting its motion by means of its bill, like the parrot in climbing. When it clambered in its cage, I perceived that the largest of the hind toes was turn∣ed forwards, but was less used than the two
<PB N="293" REF="322"/>
other anterior ones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this habit be common to the species, what becomes of the expression, <HI>digiti scansorii,</HI> applied by many naturalists to the toes disposed, as in the Cuckoo, two before and two behind? Besides, do not the nut-hatches, the titmice, and the creepers, excel in climbing, though their toes are placed in the ordinary way, three before and one behind?</NOTE>. It assisted its progressive motion by flapping its wings.</P>
<P>I have already said that the plumage of the Cuckoo is very subject to vary in different indi∣viduals; and consequently, in describing the bird, we can do nothing more than give an idea of the colours and their distribution, such as they are most commonly observed. The greater number of the full-grown males, which were brought to me, resembled much the one de∣scribed by Brisson; in all of them, the upper∣side of the head and body, including the coverts of the tail, the small coverts of the wings, the great ones next the back, and the three quills covered by them, are of a fine ash-colour; the great coverts of the middle of the wing are brown, spotted with rufous, and terminated with white; the most remote on the back, and the ten first quills of the wing are deep cine∣reous, the inside of the latter being spotted with rusty white; the six contiguous quills brown, and marked, on both surfaces, with rufous spots, terminated with white; the throat and the fore-part of the neck are light cinereous; the rest of the underside of the body is radiated transversely with brown, on a dirty white ground; the fea∣thers
<PB N="294" REF="323"/>
of the thighs the same, and falling on each side on the tarsus, like ruffles; the tar∣sus clothed exteriorly with ash-coloured fea∣thers as far as the middle; the quills of the tail blackish, and terminated with white; the eight intermediate ones are spotted with white near the shaft on the inside; the two middle ones are spotted in the same manner on the outer edge, and the last of the lateral quills is barred transversely with the same colour; the iris is chesnut, sometimes yellow; the internal membrane of the eye is very transparent; the bill is black without, and yellow within; the corners of the bill are orange; the legs yellow, and a little yellow appears also at the base of the lower mandible.</P>
<P>I have seen several females which were very like the males; and in some I perceived, on the sides of the neck, traces of those brown streaks mentioned by Linnaeus.</P>
<P>Dr. Derham says, that, in females, the neck is variegated with rusty, and the upperside of the body is of a darker cast <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A person of veracity assured me that he saw some of these in∣dividuals of a browner cat. which were also larger: if they were females. this would be another point of analogy to the rapacious birds. On the other hand, Frisch remarks, that of two young Cuckoos of different sexes, which he raised, the male was the brownest.</NOTE>; that the wings also are of a rusty hue, and the eyes not so yel∣low. According to other observers, the plum∣age
<PB N="295" REF="324"/>
of the male is always darker than that of the female; but the variation is so great, that no certain discrimination can be drawn.</P>
<P>In young Cuckoos, the bill, the legs, the tail, and the underside of the body, are nearly the same as in the adults, except that the quills are more or less retained in their tubes: the throat, the forepart of the neck, and the un∣derside of the body, are barred with white and blackish; in such manner, however, that the blackish predominates on the anterior parts more than on the posterior (in some subjects there is hardly any white under the throat); the upper∣side of the head and body is beautifully varie∣gated with blackish, white, and rusty, distri∣buted so that the rusty appears more on the middle of the body, and the white on the ex∣tremities; there is a white spot behind the head, and sometimes above the face; all the quills of the wings are brown tipped with white, and spotted more or less with rusty and white; the iris is greenish gray, and the ground of the plumage is a very light ash colour. It is pro∣bable that the female so handsomely <HI>mottled,</HI> of which Salerne speaks, was hatched the same year. Frisch tell us, that young Cuckoos rear∣ed in the woods have a plumage less variegated, and more like the plumage of those which are bred in the house. If this be not the case, we should at least expect it; for domestication in general alters the colours of animals, and we
<PB N="296" REF="325"/>
might presume that those species of birds which participate of that state, undergo a proportional change of colours. At the same time I must own, that I could perceive no difference be∣tween the young wild Cuckoos which I have seen (and I have seen many of them) and those which I reared. Perhaps what Frisch examined were older than the domestic ones with which he compared them. The same author adds that the young males have a darker plumage than the females, and that the inside of their mouth is redder, and their neck thicker <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch suspects that the thickness of the throat, which is pecu∣liar to the male, may have some relation to the cry of the males. Yet I must observe that, in the numerous dissections which I have made, I could not perceive that the organs of voice were larger in the males than in the females.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The weight of a full grown Cuckoo, weigh∣ed on the 12th of April, was four ounces two gros and a half; that of another, on the 17th of August, was about five ounces. But they are heavier in the autumn, being then much fatter, and the difference is not inconsi∣derable. I weighed a young one on the 22d of July, whose total length was near nine inches, and found it two ounces two gros; another al∣most as large, though much leaner, was only one ounce four gros, that is near one third less than the first.</P>
<P>In the full grown male the intestinal tube is about twenty inches; there are two <HI>caeca</HI> of un∣equal length, the one fourteen lines (sometimes
<PB N="297" REF="326"/>
twenty-four), the other ten (sometimes eigh∣teen), both directed forwards, and adhering all along to the great intestine, by means of a thin transparent membrane; there is a gall bladder; the kidnies are placed on each side of the spine, divided into three principal lobes, and these sub∣divided into others smaller, secreting a whitish liquor; the two testicles are of an oval shape, and of unequal size, attached to the upper part of the kidnies, and separated by a membrane.</P>
<P>The oesophagus dilates, at its lower part, into a sort of glandular sac, parted from the stomach by a contraction; the stomach is slightly muscu∣lar on its circumference, membranous on its middle, and adhering by means of fibrous net∣work to the muscles of the lower belly, and to the different parts which surround it. It is be∣sides much smaller and better proportioned in a young bird reared by a red-breast or pettychaps than in one bred and tamed by man; in the lat∣ter, the stomach, being distended by excessive feeding, is as large as a common hen's egg, and occupies all the anterior part of the cavity of the belly, from the sternum to the anus, and some∣times stretches under the sternum five or six lines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Mémoires de l' Academic Royale des Sciences, <HI>année,</HI> 1752, <HI>p.</HI> 420. The Cuckoo of M. Herissant was domestic, to judge by the quantity of flesh with which its stomach was filled. In the nutcracker the stomach is also very bulky, situated likewise in the middle of the belly, and not covered by the intestines.</NOTE>, and, at other times, it conceals the
<PB N="298" REF="327"/>
whole of the intestines; whereas in the wild Cuckoo, which I directed to be killed the in∣stant they were brought to me, it never ex∣tended quite to the sternum, but left uncovered, between its lower part and the anus, two cir∣cumvolutions of the intestines, and three on the right side of the abdomen. I should add, that in most of the birds which I dissected, nothing was required to be compressed or displaced in or∣der to perceive one or two circumvolutions of intestines in the cavity of the belly on the right side of the stomach, and one between the lower part of the stomach and the anus. This differ∣ence of conformation, therefore, consists but in degree, since, in the greater number of the winged tribes, not only is the posterior surface of the stomach separated from the spine by a por∣tion of the intestinal tube which is interposed, but the left side is never covered by any portion of these intestines; and this single difference is far from proving that the Cuckoo is incapable of hatching, as an ornithologist alleges. It is not, probably, because the stomach is too hard, since the sides being membranous, its tenseness pro∣ceeds from accident or repletion; nor is the rea∣son because the bird avoids cooling its stomach, which is less shielded than that of other birds; for it is evident, that it would be much less li∣able to be affected by cold, if employed hatch∣ing than in fluttering and perching on trees. The nut-hatch has the same structure, and yet
<PB N="299" REF="328"/>
it sits. Besides, not only the stomach, but the whole of the lower part of the body, rests upon the eggs, otherwise most birds which, like the Cuckoo, have a long sternum, could not cover above three or four at once, which falls much short of the usual number.</P>
<P>I found in the stomach of a young Cuckoo, which I reared, a lump of raw flesh almost dry, and which had not passed through the <HI>pylorus;</HI> it was decomposed, or rather divided into exceed∣ingly fine <HI>fibrillae.</HI> In another, which was picked up dead in the woods about the beginning of August, the internal membrane of the ventri∣cle was hairy, the bristles being about a line in length, and directed towards the orifice of the <HI>oesophagus:</HI> in general, one meets with very few pebbles in the stomach of young Cuckoos, and there are hardly any which have not some ves∣tige of vegetable matter in their stomach. Per∣haps these have been bred by the greenfinches, the larks, and other birds, which nestle on the ground; the sternum forms a re-entrant angle.</P>
<P>Total length thirteen or fourteen inches; the bill thirteen lines and a half; the edges of the upper mandible scolloped near the point (but not in all the young ones); the nostrils ellipti∣cal, encircled by a projecting margin, and in the centre there is a small whitish speck which rises almost as high as the margin; the tongue is white at the point, and not forked; the tar∣sus ten lines; the thigh less than twelve; the

inner one of the hind nails is the weakest and the least hooked; the two fore toes are connected together at their base by a membrane; the un∣der side is of a very fine texture, like shagreen; the alar extent about two feet; the tail is seven inches and a half, consisting of ten tapered quills <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray reckons only eight in one which he observed in 1693; but assuredly two were wanting.</NOTE>, and exceeding the wings by two inches <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Canorus:</HI> "Its tail is rounded, blackish, and dotted with white."

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the CUCKOO.</HEAD>
<P>IT might be regarded as singular that the fi∣gure and aspect of a bird, which lives in the state of nature, should be so inconstant and va∣riable. But as the Cuckoos never pair, they are stimulated only by vague and general ap∣petite unrestrained by personal attachment, and contract irregular alliances; which has given rise to diversity in the bulk, in the shape, and in the plumage, and which, in the opinion of many, has converted them into falcons, mer∣lins, gos-hawks, sparrow-hawks, &amp;c. But, not to enter into a detail of these exhaustless va∣rieties, which appear to fluctuate, I shall only
<PB N="301" REF="330"/>
observe that in Europe Cuckoos are found dif∣fering greatly in size; that the colours, ash-gray, rufous, brown, and whitish, are distri∣buted differently in different individuals, so that each of these predominates more or less, and, by the multiplicity of their shades, increases the variations of the plumage. With regard to the foreign Cuckoos, I find two which seem to be varieties of the European kind, occasioned by the influence of climate; and perhaps I should add several others, if I had an opportunity of surveying them more closely.</P>

Travellers speak of a Cuckoo of the king∣dom of Loango in Africa, which is rather larger than ours, but having the same colours, and differing chiefly in its song; this must be understood of its tone, for it pronounces <HI>cuckoo</HI> as ours does. The cock begins, it is said, with sounding the gamut, and sings alone the three first notes; then the hen strikes in, and accom∣panies him through the rest of the octave. She differs from our female Cuckoo, which calls much less than the male, and in a different manner. This is still another reason for dis∣tinguishing the Loango Cuckoo from our spe∣cies, and considering it as a variety.</P>

<HEAD>The FOREIGN CUCKOOS.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal characters of the European Cuckoo are, as we have seen, a large head, a broad wide bill, the toes placed two before and two behind, the legs feathered and short, the thighs still shorter, the nails slender and slightly hooked, the tail long and con∣sisting of ten tapered quills. It is discriminated from the curucuis by the number of tail-quills, these being twelve, and particularly by the greater length of its bill, and the greater con∣vexity of its upper mandible: it is also dis∣tinguished from the barbus, by having no bristles round the base of the bill. But the whole must be received with a degree of lati∣tude, nor must we expect to find all the cha∣racters exactly combined in each bird that ought to be classed with the Cuckoo of Europe. The various tribes of animals melt into each other, and no absolute limits can be assigned. It is enough if the birds which we shall refer to the genus of the Cuckoos be more closely related to it than to any other genus. Our object is to trace nature as she actually exists, not to form artificial arrangements; and to facilitate the pro∣gress of knowledge, by condensing and abridg∣ing the detail of facts, which serves as the foundation. Among the foreign Cuckoos,
<PB N="304" REF="333"/>
therefore, we shall meet with some species that have even tails, as the spotted Cuckoo of Chi∣na, that of the island of Pannay, the vourou∣driou of Madagascar, and a variety of the brown Cuckoo spotted with rufous, from the East Indies; with some, that are in some de∣gree forked, such as the Cuckoo which has two long shafts instead of the two outer quills; with others, which have the tail exceedingly tapered, like the widow birds, such as the san∣hia of China, and the crested collared Cuckoo; with others, wherein it is only partly tapered, as the old-man with rufous wings from Caro∣lina, which has only two pairs of quills taper∣ed, and as a variety of the crested jacobine from Coromandel, which has only the outer pair ta∣pered, that is, shorter than the four other pairs, which are equal to each other in length; with others, which have twelve quills in the tail, such as the honey-guide of the Cape; with others, which have only eight, as the guira∣cantara of Brasil, if Marcgrave was not deceived in counting them; with others, which spread their tail even when in a state of repose, as the Madagascar coua, the gold-green and white Cuckoo of the Cape of Good Hope, and the se∣cond coukeel of Mindanao; with others, which have all the quills close and imbricated, both the middle and lateral ones; with others, which have some hairs about the bill, as the sanhia, the honey-guide, and a variety of the greenish
<PB N="305" REF="334"/>
Cuckoo of Madagascar; with others, which have a proportionally longer and slenderer bill, as the tocco of Cayenne; with others, wherein the internal and posterior toe is armed with a long spur, like that of our larks, as the houhou of Egypt, the Cuckoo of the Philippines, the green Cuckoo of Antigua, the toulou and the rusty-white; and lastly, with others, wherein the legs are more or less short, more or less feathered, or even without any feather or down. Even what is regarded as the most fixed and certain character, I mean the disposition of the toes, two placed before and two behind, is also liable to vary; since I have observed, in the Cuckoo, that one of the hind toes sometimes turns forwards, and others have found, in the owls, that one of the anterior toes sometimes turns backwards; but these slight differences, far from confounding the genus of the Cuckoos, display the true order of nature; as they shew the richness of her plans, and the ease with which they are executed; exhibiting the end∣less variety of shades, the infinite diversity of features which distinguish the individual, and yet without obliterating the general family like∣ness.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable circumstance with regard to the tribe of Cuckoos, that the branch settled in the new world seems less subject to the va∣riations which I have mentioned, and retains a greater resemblance to the European species
<PB N="306" REF="335"/>
considered as the common trunk, and from which it was perhaps later separated. In fact, the European Cuckoo visits the northern coun∣tries, and pushes its excursions as far as Den∣mark and Norway, and consequently might cross the narrow straits which divide the con∣tinents at these high latitudes: but it could much more easily pass the isthmus of Suez, or some narrow inlets, to spread through Africa; and nothing could oppose or retard its progress into Asia. In these countries, therefore, the settlement must have been more early, and a greater deviation from the primitive stock may be expected. Accordingly, though there are scarcely two or three exceptions or exterior ano∣malies in fifteen species or varieties found in America, there are fifteen or twenty in thirty∣four species that occur in Asia and in Africa; and no doubt there are more, if all the Cuckoos were known, which is so far from being the case, that it is still undecided whether, among so many, there be one that drops its eggs in the nests of other birds; we know only that many of these foreign kinds build their nest, and hatch their own eggs. But though we are com∣monly acquainted with the superficial differences only, some general and radical ones must ob∣tain, especially between the two branches set∣tled in the old and in the new world, which must undoubtedly receive an impression from the climate. I have noticed that the American
<PB N="307" REF="336"/>
species are in general smaller than those of the old continent, probably owing to the same causes which check the growth and expansion of quadrupeds in the new world, whether those be indigenous, or introduced. There are at most two species of Cuckoos in America of nearly the same size with ours; but the others exceed not our blackbirds and thrushes. In Africa and Asia, there are a dozen species as large as the European, or larger, and some of them equal to hens in bulk.</P>
<P>This statement will I hope justify the plan which I have adopted, of separating the Cuckoos of America from those of Asia and Africa. Time and observation, the two great sources of inform∣ation, are still wanting to illustrate the habits and economy of these birds, and to point out their true differences, external or internal, ge∣neral or particular.</P>

<HEAD>BIRDS OF THE OLD CONTINENT, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE CUCKOO.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1">
<HEAD>I. The Great SPOTTED CUCKOO. <HI>Cuculus Glandarius,</HI> Linn. Gmel. and Bor. <HI>Cuculus Andalusiae,</HI> Briss.</HEAD>
<P>I BEGIN with this Cuckoo, which is not entirely foreign to Europe, since one was killed on the rock of Gibraltar. It would seem to be migratory, wintering in Asia or in Africa, and appearing sometimes in the south of Europe. Both this and the following species may be con∣sidered as intermediate between the common and the foreign kinds: it differs, however, from the common not only by its size and plumage, but by its proportions.</P>
<P>The most remarkable ornament of this Cuc∣koo is a silky tuft of a bluish gray, which can be erected at pleasure, but in the ordinary state lies flat on the head; there is a black bar on the eyes, which gives it a marked aspect; brown predominates on all the upper parts, including the wings and the tail, but the middle quills, and almost all the coverts of the wings, the
<PB N="309" REF="338"/>
four lateral pairs of the tail, and their superior coverts, are terminated with white, which forms a pleasant enamel; all the under surface of the body is brown orange, which is pretty bright on the anterior parts, and duller on the posterior; the bill and legs are black.</P>
<P>It is as large as a magpie; the bill fifteen or sixteen lines; the legs short; the wings not so long as in the ordinary Cuckoo; the tail about eight inches, consisting of ten tapered quills, and exceeding the wings about four inches and a half <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Glandarius:</HI> "Its tail is wedge-shaped, its head somewhat crested, with a black bar on its eyes."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>II. The BLACK and WHITE CRESTED CUCKOO. <HI>Cuculus Pisanus,</HI> Gmel. <HI>Cuculus ex-nigro et albo mixtus,</HI> Gerini. The <HI>Pisan Cuckoo,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Cuckoo likewise must be regarded as only half foreign, since it was seen once in Europe. The authors of the Italian Orni∣thology inform us that in 1739 a male and fe∣male of this species nestled in the vicinity of Pisa, and that the hen laid four eggs, which
<PB N="310" REF="339"/>
she hatched, &amp;c <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These authors say expressly that neither before nor since that time have these birds been seen in the neighbourhood of Pisa.</NOTE>. It must, therefore, be very different from the ordinary Cuckoo, which un∣doubtedly never recur to incubation in our cli∣mates.</P>
<P>The head is black, and ornamented with a tuft of the same colour, which lies backwards; all the upper side of the body, including the su∣perior coverts, is black and white; the great quills of the wings rufous, terminated with white; the quills of the tail are blackish, ter∣minated with light rufous; the throat and breast are rufous; the inferior coverts of the tail are rusty; the rest of the under side of the body white, and even the feathers on the lower part of the thigh, which descend to the tarsus; the bill is greenish-brown, and the legs green.</P>
<P>This Cuckoo is rather larger than the ordi∣nary kind, and its tail is proportionally longer; its wings are also longer, and its tail more ta∣pered than in the Great Spotted Cuckoo, which it resembles in other respects <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Pisanus:</HI> "Its tail is wedge-shaped; its body variegated with black and white above, and white below; its head crested with black; its throat and breast, rufous."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>III. The GREENISH CUCKOO of MADAGASCAR. <HI>Cuculus Madagascariensis,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Great Madagascar Cuckow,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Cuckoo is chiefly distinguished by its magnitude: all the upper side of the body is deep olive, variegated with waves of a darker brown; some of the lateral quills of the tail are terminated with white; the throat is light olive, shaded with yellow; the breast, and the top of the belly, fulvous; the lower belly brown, and also the inferior coverts of the tail; the thighs are of a gray wine colour; the iris orange; the bill black; the legs yellowish brown; the tarsus not feathered.</P>
<P>Total length twenty-one inches and a half; the bill twenty-one or twenty-two lines; the tail ten inches, and composed of ten tapered quills, and extending more than eight inches beyond the wings, which are not long <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Madagascariensis:</HI> "It is olive, waved with brown; below fulvous; the throat olive, diluted with yellow."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I find a note of Commerson on a Cuckoo from the same country, and very similar to the pre∣sent:—I shall only remark the differences.</P>
<P>It is nearly as large as a hen, and weighs thir∣teen
<PB N="312" REF="341"/>
ounces and a half; on the head there is a naked space, furrowed slightly, tinged with blue, and encircled by fine black feathers; those of the head and neck are soft and silky; there are some bristles around the base of the bill, whose inside is black; the tongue is also black and forked; the iris reddish; the thighs and the inside of the wing-quills blackish; the legs black.</P>
<P>Total length twenty-one inches and three quarters; the bill nineteen lines, its edges sharp; the nostrils like those of the gallinaceous tribe; the outer of the two hind toes can turn backwards or forwards (as I have observed in the European Cuckoo); the alar extent twenty-one inches, and each wing contains eighteen quills.</P>
<P>All that Commerson says with regard to the habits of this bird is, that it associates with the other Cuckoos. It would appear to be a variety of the greenish Cuckoo; perhaps it dif∣fers only in sex, in which case I should reckon it the male.</P>

<P>IRETAIN the name given by the inhabitants of Madagascar, because it certainly denotes the bird's call. It has a tuft which reclines back, whose feathers, and also those of the rest of the head and of all the upper side of the body, are greenish cinereous; the throat and fore-part of the neck are cinereous; the breast red wine colour; the rest of the under side of the body whitish; the legs barred almost imper∣ceptibly with cinereous; what appears of the quills of the tail and of the wings is light green, changing into blue and shining violet, but the lateral quills of the tail are terminated with white; the iris is orange; the bill and legs black; it is rather larger than the ordinary Cuckoo, and is differently proportioned.</P>
<P>Total length fourteen inches; the bill thir∣teen lines; the tarsus nineteen lines; and the toes are also longer than in our Cuckoo; the alar extent is seventeen inches; the tail is se∣ven inches, consisting of quills that are a little tapered, and exceeds the wings six inches.</P>
<P>Commerson made this description in the
<PB N="314" REF="344"/>
month of November, from the living subject, and in its native climate; he adds that its tail diverges, or rather expands, that its throat is short, its nostrils oblique and uncovered, that its tongue terminates in a cartailginous tip; its cheeks naked, wrinkled, and bluish.</P>
<P>The flesh is excellent. The bird is found in the woods near Fort Dauphin <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Cristatus:</HI> "Its tail is rounded; its head crested; its body of a glossy greenish ash-co∣lour."</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5">
<HEAD>V. The HOUHOU of EGYPT. <HI>Cuculus Aegyptius,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Egyptian Cuckoo,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Cuckoo has named itself; for its cry, <HI>hou, hou,</HI> is repeated several times succes∣sively, in a hollow tone. It is seen frequently in the Delta; the male and female seldom separate from each other; but it is more rare to find se∣veral pairs collected together. They are <HI>acri∣dophagites</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>locust-eaters,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>lacustae.</HI></NOTE> in the full sense of the word; for they seem to subsist mostly, if not entirely, on grass-hoppers. They never alight on large trees, and far less on the ground; but perch on bushes near some brook. They have two un∣common
<PB N="315" REF="345"/>
characters: the first is, that all the feathers which cover the head and neck are thick and hard, while those on the belly are soft and loose; the second is, that the nail of the inner hind toe is long and straight, like that of the lark.</P>
<P>In the female (for I have no certain account of the male) the head and upper side of the neck are dull green, with polished steel reflections; the superior coverts of the wings are greenish rufous; the quills of the wings rufous, termi∣nated with shining green, except the two last, which are entirely of that colour, and the two or three preceding these, which are mixed with it; the back is brown, with greenish reflec∣tions; the rump brown, and also the superior coverts of the tail, whose quills are shining green, with the gloss of burnished steel; the throat and all the under side of the body are rusty white, which is lighter under the belly than on the anterior parts, and on the flanks; the iris is bright red; the bill black, and the legs blackish.</P>
<P>Total length from fourteen inches and a half to sixteen and a half; the bill sixteen or seven∣teen lines; the nostrils three lines, and very narrow; the tarsus twenty-one lines; the inner hind nail nine or ten lines; the wings six or se∣ven inches; the tail eight lines, consisting of ten tapered quills, and exceeding the wings five inches.</P>
<P>M. de Sonini, to whom I am indebted for the
<PB N="316" REF="346"/>
account of this bird, adds that the tongue is broad, and slightly cut at the tip; the stomach is like that of the European Cuckoo; the intes∣tines are twenty inches, and there are two <HI>caeca,</HI> of which the shortest is an inch.</P>
<P>After attentively comparing the description of this female, in all its details, with the bird represented No. 824, <HI>Planches Enlumineés,</HI> un∣der the name of <HI>Philippine Cuckoo,</HI> I am of opinion that it is the male, or at least a variety, of that species: the same size, the same propor∣tions, the same lark's spur, the same stiffness in the feathers of the head and neck, and the same tapered tail; only the colours are duller, for, ex∣cept those of the wings, which are rufous, as in the Houhou, all the rest of the plumage is glossy black. The bird described by Sonnerat in his Voyage to New Guinea, under the name of the <HI>green Antigua Cuckoo,</HI> resembles the pre∣ceding so much, that what I have said equally applies to it: the head, the neck, the breast, and the belly, are of a dull green verging on black; the wings are of a deep brown rufous; the nail of the inner toe is more slender, and perhaps rather longer; all its feathers are in ge∣neral hard and stiff; the webs are ragged, and each fibre is a new shaft, to which shorter fibres are attached. The tail does not indeed appear tapered in the figure, but this was perhaps an oversight. This Cuckoo is hardly larger than that of Europe.</P>

Lastly, the Madagascar bird, called <HI>Toulou,</HI> resembles the female of the Egyptian Houhou in the same properties as the Cuckoo of the Philippines; its plumage is not so dark, espe∣cially on the anterior part, where the black is softened by spots of light rufous; in some indi∣viduals the olive assumes the place of the black on the body, and it is sprinkled with whitish longitudinal spots, which appear also on the wings. I should therefore suppose that they are young ones of the year's hatch, especially as, in the birds of this genus, the plumage un∣dergoes considerable change, it is well known, at the first moulting <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Aegyptius:</HI> "It is brown, below rufous white; its head and neck dull green; its tail wedge-shaped, and bright green; its wing-quills rufous."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE two prevailing colours of its plumage are rufous and white. When it perches, the tail spreads, as that of the <HI>Coua,</HI> like a fan; it is almost perpetually in motion; its cry is pre∣cisely the sound made by two or three jerks of
<PB N="318" REF="349"/>
the tongue upon the palate. Like the two preceding, it has a straight long nail on the inner hind claw, similar in form to that of the lark's; the upper surface of the head and neck blackish; the sides of each feather deeper co∣loured, and yet more brilliant; the wings ru∣fous, and their coverts rather darker near the tip; the back is of a very brown rufous; the rump and the superior coverts of the tail barred transversely with light brown on a deeper brown ground; the throat, the fore part of the neck, and all the under side of the body, are dirty white, only the feathers of the throat and neck have a more brilliant shaft, and the rest of the under side of the body is radiated transversely with delicate stripes of a lighter colour; the tail is blackish; the bill black, and the legs gray brown; the body is scarcely larger than that of a blackbird, but it has a much longer tail.</P>
<P>Total length fifteen or sixteen inches; the bill fifteen lines; the tarsus nineteen; the nail of the inner hind toe is above five lines; the alar extent a foot and seven or eight inches; the tail eight inches, consisting of ten tapered quills, and exceeding the wings about four inches <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Senegalensis:</HI> "Its tail is wedge-shaped; its body gray, white below; its cap and its tail-quills blackish."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The prevailing colour is brown, which is deeper and spotted with a lighter brown on the upper part, more dilute and spotted with white, orange, and black, on the lower part; the light brown or rusty spots form, by their arrange∣ment on the quills of the tail and wings, a trans∣verse barring, which is a little inclined towards the point of the quills; the bill and legs are yellowish.</P>
<P>Total length thirteen or fourteen inches; the bill twelve or thirteen lines; the tarsus eleven

Its throat, head, neck, and all the upper part of the body, are spotted with white or rufous, which is more or less dilute on a brown ground, which is itself variable, and verges on a gold green more or less brilliant on all the upper part of the body, including the wings and tail; but the disposition of these spots is changed on the quills of the wings, where they form transverse bars of pure white externally, and tinged inter∣nally with rufous, and on the quills of the tail, where they form transverse bars of a rusty co∣lour;

<HEAD>XIII. The BROWN and YELLOW CUCKOO, With a radiated Belly. <HI>Cuculus Radiatus,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Panayan Cuckow,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THE throat and the sides of the head resemble the colour of the lees of wine; the upper part of the head is blackish gray; the back and the wings are of a dull dark brown; the under side of the quills of the wings next the body is marked with white spots; the tail is black, ra∣diated, and terminated with white; the breast is of a dull orpiment colour; the belly is light yellow; the belly and breast radiated with black; the iris pale orange; the bill black, and the legs reddish.</P>

This Cuckoo is found in Panay, one of the Philippines; it is almost as large as the com∣mon Cuckoo, and its tail is composed of ten equal quills <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Radiatus:</HI> "It is brown black; below yellow, lineated with black; its throat and cheeks wine-colour; its top blackish gray."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>XIV. The CRESTED JACOBINE of COROMANDEL. <HI>Cuculus Melanoleucus,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Coromandel Crested Cuckoo,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS bird is termed <HI>Jacobine,</HI> because it is black above and white below; its crest, consisting of several long narrow feathers, lies on the crown of the head, and projects a little backwards. It is probable that the bird erects its crest when excited by passion.</P>
<P>With regard to the colours of its plumage, we might say that there is a sort of black hood thrown over a white tunic; the white on the lower part is pure and unmixed, but the black on the upper part is interrupted, on the edge of the wing, by a white spot immediately below the superior coverts, and by spots of the same
<PB N="328" REF="359"/>
colour, which terminate the quills of the tail; the bill and legs are black.</P>
<P>This bird is found on the coast of Coroman∣del; it is eleven inches in total length, its tail is composed of ten tapered quills, and exceeding the wings by one half its length <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Melanoleucus:</HI> "It is black, below white; its tail wedge-shaped, tipt with white; a white spot on its wings; its head somewhat crested."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is in the King's Cabinet a Cuckoo brought from the Cape of Good Hope, and pretty much like this; the only differences are, that is an inch longer, that it is entirely black both above and below, except the white spot on the wing, which occupies its exact place, and that, of the ten middle quills of the tail, eight are not tapered, the remaining outer pair being eighteen lines shorter than the rest. It is pro∣bably a variety produced by climate.</P>

<HEAD>XV. The LITTLE CUCKOO, with a Gray Head and Yellow Belly. <HI>Cuculus Flavus,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Yellow-bellied Cuckoo,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS species is found in the island of Panay; and we owe the account of it to Sonnerat:
<PB N="329" REF="360"/>
the upper side of the head and throat is light gray; the upper side of the neck, back, and wings, umber coloured; the belly, the thighs, and the inferior coverts of the tail, are pale yel∣low, tinged with rufous; the tail is black, strip∣ed with white; the legs are pale yellow, and so is the bill, only blackish at the point.</P>
<P>This bird is as large as a blackbird, not so bulky, but much longer, being eight inches and some lines, and the tail, which is tapered, oc∣cupies more than one half of this length <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Flavus:</HI> "It is brick-co∣loured, below yellowish; its top and throat dilute gray; its tail wedge-shaped, and black, lineated with white."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>XVI. The COUKEELS.</HEAD>
<P>I FIND in systems of ornithology, three birds of different sizes, which are made into as many distinct species; but they appear so ana∣logous in their plumage, that I am disposed to regard them as the same, only varying in bulk, especially as they are all natives of the eastern parts of Asia. Edwards infers from the resem∣blance between their names, that the call of the Bengal Coukeel must resemble that of the Eu∣ropean Cuckoo.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="361"/>

<P>Specific character: "Its tail is rounded; its body glossy green∣ish black; its bill brown."</P></NOTE> of the three is very near equal in size to the pigeon; its plumage is entirely of a shining black, changing into green and also into violet, but only under the quills of the tail; the under and inner side of the quills of the wings black; the bill and legs brown gray; and the nails blackish.</P>
<P>The second comes from Mindanao, and is hardly larger than our Cuckoo; it is interme∣diate in regard to size between the preceding and the following one; all its plumage is blackish, verging on blue; the bill is blackish at the base and yellowish at the point; the first of the quills of the wings is almost one half shorter than the third, which is one of the longest; the tail is generally spread.</P>

<PB N="331" REF="362"/>
rainbow. It is thus that Edwards, the original observer, describes it, and I know not why Bris∣son mentions only green and violet. As in the first Coukeel, the inner and under side of the quills of the wing are black; the bill is bright orange, rather shorter and thicker than in the European Cuckoo; the tarsus is thick and short, and of a reddish brown, which is also the colour of the toes.</P>
<P>We must observe that the name <HI>Coukeel,</HI> be∣stowed in Bengal, is peculiarly applicable to this bird, and therefore the inferences drawn be∣tween the similarity of names and the resem∣blance of calls, will be more conclusive with regard to it than with regard to the other two. The edges of the upper mandible are not straight, but undulated.</P>
<P>In all the three the tail consists of ten tapered quills. Their dimensions are as follow:</P>

<HEAD>XVII. The GOLD-GREEN and WHITE CUCKOO. <HI>Cuculus Auratus,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Gilded Cuckoo,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>ALL that we know of this bird is that it is found at the Cape of Good Hope, and car∣ries its tail spread like a fan. It is a new spe∣cies.</P>
<P>All the upper surface from the base of the bill to the end of the tail is gold-green, waving and rich, whose uniformity is interrupted on the head by five white bars, one on the middle of the front, two others above the eyes, like eye∣brows, and stretching backwards, and two others, which are narrower and shorter, below the eyes; most of the superior coverts also, and the middle quills of the wings, all the quills of the tail, and its two largest superior coverts, are terminated with white; the two outermost of the quills of the tail, and the outermost of those of the wings are streaked with white on the outside; the throat is white, and also the whole under surface of the body, except some green stripes on the flanks, and the ruffles which fall from the lower part of the thigh upon the tar∣sus; the bill is brown green, and the legs gray.</P>
<P>This Cuckoo is nearly of the size of a thrush;
<PB N="333" REF="364"/>
its total length about seven inches; the bill se∣ven or eight lines; the tarsus the same, clothed with white feathers as far as the middle; the tail three inches and a few lines, and consist∣ing of ten tapered quills, which in their na∣tural position diverge; it exceeds by only fif∣teen lines the wings, which are very long in proportion.</P>

<P>THE plumage of this bird is entirely of a dark green, which appears on the head, the body, the wings, and the tail. Yet it has not been neglected by nature, but, on the contrary, it is decorated by unusual feathers. Beside the tuft which distinguishes the head, the tail has a remarkable form; the outermost pair of quills is near six inches longer than all the rest; and they have no webs except for the space of three inches at their extremity. It was on account of these two shafts that Linnaeus gave the bird the appellation of <HI>Paradise Cuckoo:</HI> for the same reason the two following might be termed <HI>Wi∣dow</HI>

<P>THIS bird is also ornamented with a crest, and is remarkable for the length of two quills of its tail; but these are the middle ones, which project beyond the lateral ones, as also obtains in some species of widow-birds.</P>
<P>All the upper side is blackish, from the head inclusively to the end of the tail, except a white collar about the neck, and two round spots of

<P>THIS Cuckoo resembles the preceding spe∣cies, and consequently the widow birds, by the length of the two middle quills of the tail; its plumage is remarkable, though it con∣sists of only two principal colours, blue on the upper side, and snowy white on the under side; but it would seem that nature, happy always in her careless mood, has suffered a few drops that are snowy white to fall from her pallet upon the crown of the head, where it forms a spot through which the blue appeared in a thou∣sand points; and also upon the cheeks a little behind, where two sorts of ear-pendants are re∣presented, as in the preceding species; and upon the quills and coverts of the tail, each of which is marked by a round white speck near the tip: besides, it appears melted into the azure of the rump and of the base of the great quills of the wing, and has considerably diluted the tinge; the whole is set off to advantage by the dark blackish colour of the throat and the sides of the head; and lastly, the beautiful colour of the iris,

<HEAD>XXII. The POINTER CUCKOO. <HI>Cuculus Indicator,</HI> Gmel. and Bor. The <HI>Honey-Guide,</HI> Sparrman. The <HI>Honey Cuckoo,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>IT is in the interior part of Africa, at some dis∣tance from the Cape of Good Hope, that this bird is found, which is known by its singular instinct of pointing out the nests of wild bees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to some travellers, the cry of this bird is <HI>wieki, wieki;</HI> and this word <HI>wieki</HI> signifies honey in the language of the Hottentots. It sometimes happens that the hunter in following the call of this Cuckoo, is devoured by wild beasts; which has given occasion to say that the bird concerts with them to conduct their prey.</NOTE>. In the morning and evening it utters its cry, <HI>cherr, cherr, cherr,</HI> which is very shrill, and
<PB N="339" REF="371"/>
seems to invite the hunters and others, who search for honey in the wilderness; they an∣swer it in a more hollow tone, and continue al∣ways advancing: as soon as it perceives them it flies onward, and hovers over the hollow tree where the swarm is lodged; if the hunters are too tardy in following it, it redoubles its cries, returns back to them, stops and flutters about, to rouse their attention. It omits nothing to in∣duce them to profit by the little treasure which it discovers, but which it probably could not enjoy without the assistance of man; either because the entrance into the nest is too narrow, or on ac∣count of some other circumstances. While the party are employed in plundering the honey, the bird sits in a neighbouring bush, watching ea∣gerly and expecting its share of the booty, which is commonly left for it, though never in sufficient quantity to satiate its appetite, or extinguish or blunt its ardour in this kind of pursuit.</P>
<P>This is not the idle tale of a common tra∣veller; it is the observation of an enlightened man, who assisted at the destruction of several republics of bees, betrayed by this little spy, and who communicates an account of what he saw to the Royal Society of London. I shall add the description of the female, which he made from the only two subjects that he could pro∣cure, and which he shot to the great scandal of
<PB N="340" REF="372"/>
the Hottentots; the existence of a useful crea∣ture is every where precious.</P>
<P>The upper side of the head is gray; the throat, the fore part of the neck, and the breast, are whitish with a green tinge, which grows more dilute as it spreads, and is scarcely per∣ceptible on the breast; the belly is white; the thighs the same, marked with an oblong black spot; the back and rump are rusty gray; the superior coverts of the wings are brown gray, those next the body marked with a yellow spot, which, on account of its situation, is often con∣cealed under the scapular feathers; the quills of the wings are brown; the two middle quills of the tail are longer and narrower than the rest, and of a brown verging on rust colour; the two following pairs are blackish, their inside dirty white; those which succeed are white, ter∣minated with brown, and marked with a white spot near their base, except the last pair, where this spot almost vanishes; the iris is rusty gray; the eye-lids black; the bill brown at its base, yellow at the end, and the legs are black.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and a half; the bill about six lines, and there are some bristles about the base of the lower mandible; the nostrils are oblong, with a projecting margin, placed near the base of the upper mandible, and separat∣ed only by its ridge; the tarsus is short; the

<P>THIS species and the preceding differ from all the rest, in the number of quills in the tail; these amounting to twelve, though com∣monly they are only ten. The differences pe∣culiar to the Vourou-driou consist in the shape of its bill, which is longer, straighter, and not so convex above; in the position of the nostrils, which are oblong, and placed obliquely near the middle of the bill; and in a character which belongs also to the birds of prey, viz. that the female is larger than the male, and of a very

different plumage. This bird is found in the island of Madagascar, and no doubt on the cor∣responding part of Africa.</P>
<P>In the male the crown of the head is black∣ish, with reflections of green and rose copper; there is a streak of black placed obliquely between the bill and the eye; the rest of the head, the throat, and the neck, are cinereous; the breast, and all the rest of the under side of the body, are of a handsome white gray; the upper side of the body, as far as the end of the tail, is of a green colour, changing into rose-copper; the middle quills of the wing are nearly of the same colour; the large ones blackish, verging on green; the bill is deep brown; and the legs reddish.</P>

<P>THE name of <HI>Old-Man</HI> has been given to this bird, because, under its throat, there is a sort of white down or beard, the attribute of age: it is also called the <HI>Rain-Bird,</HI> because it never calls, except before rain. It continues the whole year in Jamaica, and haunts not only the woods, but the straggling bushes: it suffers the hunters to approach very near before it takes flight. Its ordinary food consists of seeds and worms.</P>
<P>The upper side of the head is covered with downy or silky feathers of a deep brown; the rest of the upper side of the body, including the wings and the two middle quills of the tail, is olive cinereous; the throat is white, and the fore part of the neck the same; the breast, and the rest of the under surface of the body, rufous; all the
<PB N="345" REF="377"/>
lateral quills of the tail are black tipt with white, and the outermost is edged with white; the up∣per mandible is black; the lower one is almost white; the legs bluish black: it is somewhat larger than the blackbird.</P>
<P>The stomach of the one dissected by Sloane was very large in proportion to the size of the bird, in which respect it resembles the Eu∣ropean species; it was lined by an exceedingly thick membrane; the intestines were twisted like a ship's cable, and covered with a quantity of yellow fat.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and three quarters; the bill one inch; the tarsus thirteen lines; the alar extent equal to the total length; the tail from seven and a half to eight inches, com∣posed of ten tapering quills, and projecting al∣most entirely beyond the wings <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Pluvialis:</HI> "It is cine∣reous olive, below rufous; its throat white."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>SLOANE positively asserts that, except the bill, which in the Tacco is longer, more slender, and whiter, it resembles the Rain-bird precise∣ly; he ascribes to it the same habits, and ap∣plies
<PB N="348" REF="380"/>
the same names. But Brisson, resting pro∣bably on this remarkable difference in the length and conformation of the bill, has made this bird a distinct species. This separation is the more proper, as it appears from closer inspection that the plumage is not the same, and that even the white beard is wanting, which gave name to the preceding species: besides, the Chevalier Lefebre Deshayes, who has observed the Tac∣co with attention, finds that its habits are dif∣ferent from those ascribed by Sloane to the Rain-bird.</P>
<P><HI>Tacco</HI> is the usual cry of this Cuckoo, but is seldom heard. It pronounces the first syllable hard, and descends a whole octave on the se∣cond; it never utters this till after it has given a jerk with its tail, which it commonly does when it shifts its place, or perceives any one approach. It has also another cry <HI>qua, qua, qua, qua,</HI> but which is never heard unless it be alarmed by the sight of a cat, or some other dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>Sloane says that this Cuckoo, like the one which he terms <HI>Rain-bird,</HI> forebodes rain by its loud calls; but the Chevalier Deshayes disco∣covered no such habit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the Chevalier Deshayes I owe my information with regard to the habits and economy of the Tacco.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the Tacco lives generally in culti∣vated grounds, it also frequents the woods, be∣cause it there finds its proper food, which con∣sists

T.</NOTE>, small snakes, frogs, young rats, and sometimes, it is said, upon small birds. It surprises the lizards when they are eagerly watching on the branches for flies, and therefore off their guard. With regard to snakes, it seizes them by the head, and in proportion as the part swallowed digests, it sucks up the rest of the body, which hangs out from the bill. It is thus useful, since it destroys the pernicious animals: it would prove of still greater utility, could it be domes∣ticated; and this might be possible, for it is not shy, but even suffers the young negroes to catch it in the hand, though it has a strong bill, and could make a stout defence.</P>
<P>Its flight is never lofty; it begins flapping with its wings, and, then spreading its tail, it shoots along, or rather skims than flies. It flutters from bush to bush, and hops from bough to bough: it even springs upon the trunks of trees, to which it clings like the wood-peckers; and sometimes it alights on the ground, and hops about like the magpye, always in pursuit of
<PB N="350" REF="382"/>
insects or reptiles. It is said to exhale conti∣nually a rank smell, and that its flesh is unpa∣latable; which is very probable, considering the kind of substances upon which it feeds.</P>
<P>These birds retire in the breeding season into the depth of the forests, and remain so well con∣cealed, that no person has ever seen their nest. One might almost be induced to suppose that they have none, and that, like the European Cuckoo, they lay their eggs in other birds' nests; but if this were the case, they would differ from all the other American Cuckoos, which themselves build and hatch.</P>
<P>The Tacco has no brilliant colours in its plumage, but it has always a neat and becom∣ing air; the upper side of its head and body, in∣cluding the coverts of the wings, is gray, which is pretty deep, with greenish reflections on the great coverts only; the fore side of the neck and breast is ash gray, and over all these shades of gray there is spread a faint reddish tint; the throat is light fulvous; the rest of the under side of the body, including the thighs, and the in∣ferior coverts of the wings, are more or less of a lively fulvous; the ten first quills of the wing are of a bright rufous, terminated with green∣ish brown, which, in the following quills, ap∣proaches constantly to a rust colour; the two middle quills of the tail are of the colour of the back, with greenish reflections; the eight others are the same about their middle, dark brown,

with blue reflections, near their base, and ter∣minated with white; the iris is brown yellow; the eyebrows red; the bill blackish above, and of a lighter colour below; the legs are bluish. This Cuckoo is not so large as the European one; it is found in Jamaica, in St. Domingo, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Total length fifteen inches and a half (seven∣teen and one-third, according to Sloane); the bill is eighteen lines according to Sloane; twen∣ty-one according to the Chevalier Deshayes, and twenty-five according to Brisson; the tongue is cartilaginous, terminated by filaments; the tar∣sus about fifteen lines; the alar extent equal to the total length of the bird; the tail eight inches, according to Deshayes, and eight inches and three quarters, according to Brisson, and consisting of ten tapering quills; the inter∣mediate ones overlap the lateral ones; it pro∣jects about five inches and a half beyond the wings <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Vetula:</HI> "Its tail is wedge-shaped; its body duskish, below brick coloured; the eye-lids red."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS Cuckoo is very noisy; it lives in the forests of Brazil, and makes them echo to its cry, which is louder than pleasant. It has a kind of tuft, whose feathers are brown, edged with yellowish; those of the neck and wings are, on the contrary, yellowish, edged with brown; the upper and under sides of the body are of a pale yellow; the quills of the wings are brown; those of the tail brown also, but ter∣minated with white; the iris is brown; the bill dun-yellow; the legs sea-green.

<P>THIS Cuckoo is called the <HI>Laughing-bird,</HI> on account of its call; and for the same rea∣son, says Fernandez, it was reckoned unlucky by the Mexicans before the true religion was introduced among them. With regard to the Mexican name <HI>Quapachtototl,</HI> which I have contracted and softened, it alludes to the fulvous colour which is spread over all the upper surface of its body, and even on the quills of the wings; those of the tail are also fulvous, but of a darker cast; the throat is cinereous, and also the fore-part of the neck and breast; the rest of the un∣der side of the body is black; the iris is white, and the bill bluish black.</P>
<P>The size of this Cuckoo is nearly equal to that of the European kind; it is sixteen inches in total length, and the tail alone occupies the one half of this. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Ridibundus:</HI> "It is ful∣vous; its throat and breast cinereous; its belly, its thighs, and the lower coverts of its tail, black."</NOTE></P>

<P>THE singular property of this Brazilian Cuckoo is, that there are long feathers on the head, which it can erect at pleasure, and form a dou∣ble tuft; and hence the epithet of <HI>horned,</HI> which has been bestowed by Brisson. The head is large, and the neck short, as usual in this ge∣nus; all the upper surface of the head and body is sooty; the wings are the same, and even the tail, though this has a darker cast, and the fea∣thers at its extremity are marked with a rusty white spot, shaded with black, which melts in∣to a pure white; the throat is cinereous, and so is all the under side of the body; the iris is blood coloured; the bill yellowish green, and the legs cinereous.</P>
<P>This bird is distinguished too by the length of its tail; for though not larger than a field∣fare or large thrush, and its body only three inches long, its tail is nine; it consists of ten tapering quills, the intermediate ones overlap∣ping the lateral ones; the bill is a little hooked

<P>THE upper side of the body is variegated with brown and with different shades of rufous; the throat is light rufous variegated with brown; the rest of the under side of the body is rusty white, which assumes a distinct light rufous on the inferior coverts of the tail; its quills and those of the wings are brown, edged with light rufous, having a greenish cast, particularly on the lateral quills of the tail; the bill is black above, rufous on the sides, rusty below, and the legs cinereous. It is observed as a singular pro∣perty, that some of the superior coverts of the tail extend almost to two-thirds of its length. With regard to size, this Cuckoo is compared to the red-wing.</P>
<P>Total length ten inches and two thirds; the bill nine lines; the tarsus fourteen lines;
<PB N="356" REF="388"/>
the alar extent above an inch; the tail about six inches, consisting of ten tapering quills, and exceeding the wings by four inches.</P>
<P>The Cuckoo known at Cayenne by the name of the <HI>Barrier-bird</HI> is nearly as large as the pre∣ceding, and very similar in regard to plumage: in general, it has rather less rufous, gray occu∣pying its place, and the lateral quills of the tail are tipt with white; the throat is light gray, and the under side of the body white; the tail too is longer. But notwithstanding these trifling differences, we must consider it as a variety of the preceding, perhaps only sexual.</P>
<P>The name <HI>Barrier-bird</HI> alludes to its habit of perching upon the palisades round plantations; in that situation it continually shakes its tail.</P>
<P>These birds, though not very wild, never gather in flocks; yet many live in the same dis∣trict at once; they seldom haunt the forests: they are more common, we are assured, than the <HI>Piaye</HI> Cuckoos, both in Cayenne and Gui∣ana. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Naevius:</HI> "Its tail is wedge-shaped; its body brown and ferruginous; its throat marked with brown furrows; its tail-quills tipt with tawny."</NOTE></P>

<P>I ADOPT the epithet <HI>Piaye,</HI> applied to this Cuckoo in the island of Cayenne; but I adopt not the superstition which gave it birth: <HI>Piaye</HI> signifies <HI>devil</HI> in the language of the na∣tives, and also <HI>priest,</HI> that is among an idolatrous people, <HI>minister</HI> or <HI>interpreter of the devil.</HI> This obviously shews that it is looked upon as an un∣lucky bird: for this reason the Indians and ne∣groes are said to have an abhorrence of its flesh; but may not its perpetual leanness and unpalat∣able quality account for their aversion?</P>
<P>The Piaye is not shy; it allows a person to get very near it, and does not fly away till the moment he is about to seize it: its flight is compared to that of the king-fisher; it com∣monly frequents the banks of rivers, and lodges
<PB N="359" REF="391"/>
beneath the low branches of trees, where it pro∣bably watches the insects which constitute its food; when perched it wags its tail, and perpe∣tually shifts its place. Persons who have lived at Cayenne and seen this Cuckoo several times in the fields, have never yet heard its call. It is nearly as large as a blackbird; the upper side of its head and body is purple chesnut, includ∣ing the wings of the tail, which are black near the end, terminated with white, and the quills of the wings, which are terminated with brown; the throat and the fore part of the neck are also purple-chesnut, but of a lighter tinge, and which varies in different individuals; the breast and all the under side of the body are cinereous; the bill and legs are brown gray.</P>
<P>Total length fifteen inches and nine lines; the bill fourteen lines; the tarsus fourteen lines and a half; the alar extent fifteen inches and one third; the tail ten lines, consisting of ten tapered and very unequal quills; it exceeds the wings about eight inches.

<HEAD>The ANIS.</HEAD>
<P>ANI is the name which the natives of Bra∣zil give to this bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.</NOTE>, and which we re∣tain, though the French travellers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dutertre.</NOTE> and our modern nomenclators call it <HI>Tobacco-end</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bout de Petun,</HI> or <HI>Bout de Tabac.</HI></NOTE>, a ridiculous appellation bestowed on account of the resemblance of its plumage to the colour of a tobacco roll. Father Dutertre asserts, indeed, as the reason of that denomination, that it seems to articulate the words <HI>petit bout de petun,</HI> which is false and improbable; especially as the Creoles of Cayenne have an appropriated designation for its ordinary warble, <HI>Canary boiler,</HI> because it resembles the noise of a kettle boiling. It has also the name <HI>Devil,</HI> and one of the species is called the <HI>Savanna devil,</HI> and the other the <HI>Mangrove devil;</HI> the former living constantly in the savannas, and the latter frequenting the sea shores and the margins of salt marshes, where the mangroves grow.</P>
<P>Their generic characters are these:—Two toes before and two behind, the bill short, hook∣ed, thicker than broad; the lower mandible straight, the upper one raised into a semicircle at its origin, and this remarkable convexity ex∣tends over all the upper part of the bill till
<PB N="364" REF="396"/>
within a little distance of its extremity, where it is hooked; this convexity is compressed on the sides, and forms a sort of sharp ridge quite along the upper mandible; below and round there rise small ragged feathers as stiff as hogs' bristles, about half an inch long, and all point∣ed forwards: this singular conformation of the bill is sufficient to discriminate these birds, and seems to constitute a separate genus, though it includes only two species.</P>

The <HI>Razor-billed Blackbird,</HI> Catesby. The <HI>Lesser Ani,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Ani is as large as a blackbird, but its large tail gives it a longer form; for this is seven inches, which is more than half the to∣tal length of the bird: the bill is thirteen lines long, and rises nine lines and a half; it is black, and so are the legs, which are seventeen lines in height. The description of its colours shall be very short: all the body is black, faintly shaded with some violet reflections, except a
<PB N="365" REF="397"/>
small edge of deep shining green, which borders the feathers on the upper part of the back and the coverts of the wings, and which cannot be perceived at a certain distance, for then the bird appears entirely black. The female differs not from the male; they constantly keep in troops, and are of so social a disposition that they lodge and lay their eggs together in the same nest. They construct it with dry sticks, but use no lining; it is exceedingly wide, often a foot in diameter, and its capacity is said to be proportioned to the number of fellow-lodgers which they intend to admit. The females hatch in company, and five or six are often seen in the same nest. This instinct, which would prove useful in the cold countries, seems to be at least superfluous in the southern regions, where the nest will easily pre∣serve its heat. It originates entirely from the impulse of social temper; for they are constantly together, both when they fly and when they repose and settle on the branches of trees as near as possible to each other. In this situation they all warble in concert, and almost through the whole day; and their smallest troops consist of eight or ten, and they sometimes amount to twenty-five or thirty. They fly low, and to short distances; and hence they oftener alight among bushes and thickets than upon trees. They are neither timorous nor shy, and never make any remote retreat. They are hardly scared by the report of fire arms, and it is easy
<PB N="366" REF="398"/>
to kill many, one after another. But they are in no request, for their flesh cannot be eaten, and the birds have an offensive smell: they feed on seeds and small serpents, lizards, and other reptiles; they also alight upon oxen and cows to feed on the ticks, maggots, and insects, which nestle in their skin <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Crotophaga-Ani:</HI> "It is smaller; its feet scansory."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS bird is larger than the preceding, and almost equal to the jay; it is eighteen inches long, including the tail, which occupies the half of that extent: its plumage is nearly of the same brownish black colour as that of the former, only it is somewhat more variegated with brilliant green, which terminates the fea∣thers of the back and the coverts of the wings; insomuch that if we rested our opinion solely on the difference of size and colours, we might re∣gard these two birds as only varieties of the same
<PB N="367" REF="399"/>
species. But what proves that they are really two distinct species is, that they never inter∣mingle; the one kind constantly inhabits the open savannas, the other lodges among the man∣groves only: yet the latter have the same na∣tural habits with the former; they likewise keep in flocks; they haunt the brinks of salt marshes; they lay and hatch, many of them together in the same nest, and seem to be only a different race accustomed to live in more wet situations, where the abundance of insects and reptiles affords an easier subsistence.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have received a letter from the Chevalier lefebre Deshayes con∣cerning these St. Domingo birds, and I shall here extract what he says with regard to the Mangrove Ani.</P>
<P><Q>"This bird," says he, “”is one of the most common in the island of St. Domingo....</Q> The negroes give it different appellations, <HI>To∣bacco end, Amangoua, Black Parrot,</HI> &amp;c..... If we attentively consider the structure of the wings of this bird, the shortness of its flight, and the weight of its body compared to its bulk, we shall not hesitate to conclude that it is a na∣tive of the new world: how, with its feeble narrow wings, could it traverse the vast ocean that divides the two continents?... The kind is peculiar to south America. When it flies it spreads its wings; but its motion is not so quick nor so continued as the parrot's... It cannot
<PB N="368" REF="400"/>
withstand the violence of the wind, and the hurricanes destroy numbers of these birds.</P>
<P><Q>“”They inhabit the cultivated grounds, or such as have once been in the state of cultiva∣tion, and they are never found in the lofty fo∣rests.</Q> They feed on various sorts of seeds and fruits, such as small millet, maize, rice, &amp;c. and when reduced to want, they eat caterpil∣lars and some other insects. We cannot say that they have a song or warble; it is rather a whis∣tling or chirping: sometimes, however, this becomes more varied, but it is always harsh and disagreeable; it receives different inflexions ac∣cording to the passions which incite it. If the bird perceives a cat, or other dangerous animal, it informs its companions by a very distinct scream, which it prolongs or repeats until its apprehensions are quieted: its fears are most re∣markable when it has young, for then it flut∣ters and beats about its nest. These birds live in society, though they do not form into such large flocks as the stares; they seldom part from one another.... and even previous to their hatching, we see several males and females working together at the construction of the nest, and afterwards the females hatch beside each other, each sitting on her eggs and rearing her young. This harmony is the more admirable, since love commonly dissolves all other ties but what it forms... Their amours commence early: in February the males ardently court
<PB N="369" REF="401"/>
the females, and in the following month the happy couple are busy in collecting materials for the nest.... These birds are more lasci∣vious than even sparrows; and, during the whole season of their ardour, they are much more lively and cheerful than at any other time... They breed in shrubs, coffee-trees, bushes, and hedges; and they place their nests in the cleft where the stem divides into several branches... When several females associate together, the one readiest to lay does not wait till the nest be completed, but sits on her eggs while the rest are employed in enlarging the fabric. They employ a precaution which is unusual with other birds, viz. to cover their eggs with leaves and grass-stalks, as fast as they lay them.... And during incubation, they cover the eggs in the same manner, if they are obliged to leave them in quest of food.... The females which thus hatch beside each other are not quarrel∣some, like hens that breed in the same crib; they take their stations in order: some, how∣ever, before they lay, make a partition in the nest with stalks of herbs, to contain their own eggs; but if the eggs happen to be jumbled to∣gether, one female hatches them indiscrimi∣nately; she collects them, heaps them, and co∣vers the whole with leaves, so as to diffuse the heat equally, and prevent its dissipation... Yet each female lays several eggs... These birds build their nest very solid, though rude, with

the small stems of filamentous plants, the branches of the citron trees, and other shrubs; the inside only is covered with tender leaves that soon wither; and upon this bed the eggs are deposited: these nests are wide, and much raised at the margin; sometimes the diameter is more than eighteen inches, but its size de∣pends on the number of females which it is des∣tined to receive. It would be difficult to decide with accuracy whether all the females contained in the same nest have each their male; perhaps these birds are polygamous, in which case it would, in some measure, be necessary to enlarge the nests, and thus, even without any friendly social principles, they might be constrained to unite in performing the work... The eggs are as large as those of a pigeon; they are of an uniform beryl, and have none of those little spots on the ends, which are usual on most of the eggs of wild birds... It is probable that the females hatch twice or thrice a year, according to circumstances; if the first suc∣ceeds, they do not make another till autumn; if on the contrary, the eggs are robbed, or eaten by snakes or cats, they makes second, and towards the end of July, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> during the course of August, they hatch a third time: certain it is, that their nests are found in the months of March, May, and August...

<P>WE retain the name <HI>Houtou,</HI> which has been given by the natives of Guiana, since it is expressive of the cry. Whenever the bird makes a spring, it briskly and distinctly ar∣ticulates <HI>Houtou;</HI> the tone is deep, and resem∣bles a man's voice: that character alone suffi∣ciently discriminates the living bird, whether it be in the state of freedom or of domestication.</P>
<P>Fernandez, who first noticed the Houtou, has inadvertently mentioned it by two different names, and this mistake has been copied by all the nomenclators: Marcgrave is the only na∣turalist who has not been misled. It would seem that Fernandez was deceived by the sight of a mutilated specimen, which induced him to admit two species; for the single naked quill which he observed could not be natural, since in all birds the feathers grow constantly by pairs, just as other animals have two legs or two arms.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="405"/>
The Houtou is about the size of the magpie; it measures seventeen inches and three lines from the point of the bill to the end of the great quills of the tail; its toes are placed as in the king-fishers, the manakins, &amp;c. But it is distin∣guished from these, and even from all other birds, by the form of its bill, which, though proportioned to the body, is conical and incur∣vated, and the edges of the two mandibles in∣dented. This character would discriminate the Houtou; but it has another more singular one peculiar to itself; to wit, near the ends of the two long quills of the middle of the tail there is a space of about an inch, absolutely bare or shaved, so that the shaft is naked in that part. This appearance, however, belongs to the adult; for when the bird is young these quills are, like the other feathers, webbed their whole length. It has been supposed that this naked space is not a natural production, and that it is perhaps ow∣ing merely to the caprice of the bird, which plucks the feathery fibres. But it is observed that in young subjects the webs are continuous and entire, and as they grow up these become shorter by degrees, so as at last to disappear. We shall not stop to describe more particularly the plumage of this bird, for the colours are so much intermingled that it would be impossible by words to convey a distinct idea of them; they are also affected by age or sex.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="406"/>
They are difficult to rear, though Piso as∣serts the contrary; and as they feed upon in∣sects, it is not easy to choose what will suit their taste. Those caught old cannot be bred; they are extremely shy, and refuse all suste∣nance. The Houtou is a wild solitary bird, ne∣ver found but in the gloomy recesses of forests; it associates not in flocks, or even in pairs; it is almost continually on the ground, or among the low branches, for it never properly flies, but leaps nimbly, pronouncing smartly <HI>hou∣tou.</HI> It is early in motion, and its cry is heard before the warble of the other birds. Pi∣so was ill informed when he said that it builds on lofty trees; for it never constructs a nest, nor does it rise to any considerable height: it is contented with some hole of the <HI>armadillos,</HI> of the <HI>cavies,</HI> or of other small qua∣drupeds, which it finds on the surface of the ground; it lines this with dry herb stalks, and there lays its eggs, which are generally two in number. The Houtous are common in the in∣terior parts of Guiana; but they seldom frequent the neighbourhood of plantations. Their flesh is hard and unpalatable food. Piso is mistaken too, in saying that they live upon fruits. As this is the third time he has been misled, it is probable that he has applied the attributes of another bird to the present, which he describes only from Marcgrave, and with which he was
<PB N="375" REF="407"/>
perhaps unacquainted; for it is certain that the <HI>Houtou</HI> is the same bird with the <HI>Guira-guai∣numbi</HI> of Marcgrave, which is difficult to tame, which is unfit for eating, and which neither perches nor nestles upon trees, nor feeds on fruits. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Ramphastos-Momota:</HI> "Its feet are gressory <HI>(i. e.</HI> the toes disposed three before and one be∣hind)."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The HOOPOES, the PROMEROPS, and the BEE-EATERS.</HEAD>
<P>COMPARISON is the great source of knowledge. When objects have many common properties, their contrast throws mu∣tual light; it points out the real differences which obtain, and destroys those false analogies which are apt to be formed when they are viewed separately. For this reason, I have ranged in a single article the general facts with regard to the three contiguous genera of the Hoopoes, the Promerops, and the Bee-eaters.</P>
<P>Our Hoopoe is well known by its beautiful double tuft, which is almost <HI>unique</HI> in its kind, since it resembles no other, except that of the cockatoo: its bill is long, slender, and incur∣vated, and its legs are short. The black and white Hoopoe of the Cape differs from ours in several particulars, and especially because its bill is shorter and more pointed, as will be found in the descriptions. But it ought to be referred to that genus, being more related to it than to any other.</P>
<P>The Promerops resembles the Hoopoes so much that, were we for a moment to adopt the principles of the system-makers, we should say that they are Hoopoes without the crest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Huppes sans Huppe.</NOTE>. But
<PB N="377" REF="409"/>
the fact is that they are rather taller, and their tail is much longer.</P>
<P>The Bee-eaters resemble, in the shortness of their legs, the Hoopoe and king-fisher, more especially the latter, by the singular disposition of their toes, of which the middle one adheres to the outer as far as the third phalanx, and to the inner one as far as the first phalanx only. The bill of the Bee-eaters, which is pretty broad and strong at its base, holds a middle rank between the slender bills of the Hoopoes and Promerops on the one hand, and the long, straight, thick, and pointed bills of the king-fishers on the other; but, on the whole, it ra∣ther inclines to the former, since the Bee∣eaters live upon insects like the Hoopoes and the Promerops, and not upon small fish like the king-fishers; and it is well known how much the force and conformation of the bill serve to regulate the choice of the food.</P>
<P>There are also some traces of analogy between the genus of the Bee-eaters and that of the king-fishers. In the first place, the beautiful beryl, which is by no means common in the European birds, decorates alike the plumage of our king-fisher and of our Bee-eater. In the second place, the greatest number of the species of Bee-eaters have their two middle quills of the tail projecting far beyond the lateral ones; and the genus of the king-fisher contains also some species in which these two middle quills project
<PB N="378" REF="410"/>
also. And in the third place, there are some species of king-fishers in which the bill is a lit∣tle incurvated, which, in this respect, resem∣bles that of the Bee-eaters.</P>
<P>On the other hand, how close soever the Bee-eaters and Promerops be related, nature, ever rich and unexhausted, has still separated them; or rather she has melted them into one another by imperceptible shades. These intermediate birds incline sometimes more to the one genus, and sometimes more to the other; I shall deno∣minate them <HI>Merops.</HI></P>
<P>All these different birds, which resemble each other in so many respects, are similar also in point of size. The largest species exceed not the thrushes, and the least are scarcely smaller than the sparrows and the warblers. The ex∣ceptions are few, and obtain equally in the dif∣ferent genera.</P>
<P>With regard to climate, a discrimination takes place. The Promerops inhabit Asia, Africa, and America; and never occur in Europe: if they are natives of the old continent, they must have migrated into the new by the north of Asia. The Hoopoe is peculiar to the old world, and I may assert the same thing of the Bee-eaters, though there is a bird termed the <HI>Cayenne Bee-eater:</HI> for ornithologists who have frequently visited that island have never seen this bird. And with regard to the two Bee-eaters depicted by Seba, the one from Brazil and the other from

I had occasion to see a Hoopoe, which was caught in a net, and which was old, or at least grown up, and consequently had ac∣quired its natural habits. Its attachment for its mistress was already strict and ardent; it seemed uneasy unless it alone enjoyed her company; if strangers happened to break in upon its domes∣tic society, it erected its tuft, through surprise or disquietude, and fled to the top of a bed which was in the same room; sometimes it had the re∣solution to descend from its asylum, but then it flew directly to its mistress, who enjoyed exclu∣sively all its regard and affection. It had two very different kinds of cries; the one soft and tender, flowing from sentiment, and directed to its mis∣tress; the other harsh and shrill, and expressing anger or fear. It was never confined in its cage, either by day or night, but ran about the house; and, though the windows were often open, it never shewed any desire of effecting its escape. At last, happening to be scared, it dis∣appeared suddenly; it flew but a short distance, and not being able to find its way back again, it
<PB N="381" REF="414"/>
threw itself into a nun's cell, where the win∣dow had been left open; so necessary was hu∣man society become to its existence and com∣fort! It died in this retreat, where it could only be fed, and where its proper mode of treatment was unknown. Yet it lived three or four months in its first condition, its sole subsistence being a little bread and cheese. Another Hoo∣poe was fed for eighteen months upon raw flesh <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner fed one with hard eggs: Olina with worms, or with the hearts of oxen and sheep, cut into little longish shreds, nearly like worms; but, above all, he advises not to shut it up in a cage.</NOTE>; it was excessively fond of this, and hastened to eat it out of the hand; it rejected, on the contrary, what had been cooked. This predilection for raw flesh seems to indicate an analogy to the rapacious birds and those which live upon insects.</P>
<P>The ordinary food of the Hoopoe is insects in general, and especially such as grovel on the surface <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Hoopoe seldom perches upon trees; but, when it does, it prefers oziers, willows, and probably all such as grow in wet grounds.</NOTE>, either their whole life, or during a part of it; beetles, ants <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Frisch says that it digs with its long bill into the ant-hills, to extract the eggs: and, in fact, the one fed by Gesner was very fond of the eggs or nymphs of ants, but rejected the ants themselves.</NOTE>, worms, wild bees, and many kinds of caterpillars <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Salerne adds that it clears the house of mice; but this is un∣doubtedly by driving them away, for with a bill so slender, with claws so weak, and with a throat so narrow, it could neither seize nor devour them, still less swallow them entire.

I found in the gizzard of those which I dissected, besides insects and worms, sometimes grass, small seeds, and buds, sometimes round grains of an earthy matter, sometimes small stones, and sometimes nothing at all.</NOTE>, &amp;c.

It is easy, indeed, to conceive that Hoopoes which live remote from man, in forsaken plains, are better food than such as haunt the streets or the environs of a large city: the former subsist upon the in∣sects that lodge among the clay or mud; the latter prowl among all sorts of filth, which abounds wherever vast numbers of men are col∣lected; a circumstance which cannot fail to be∣get an aversion to the city Hoopoes, and even communicate an offensive odour to their flesh <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is to these stationary, city Hoopoes that we must refer what Belon asserts, perhaps with too great latitude, "that their flesh is good for nothing, and that no person in any country will taste it."

<P>In Egypt the Hoopoes gather, it is said, in

small flocks, and if one happens to stray, it calls on its companions with a very shrill cry of two notes, <HI>zi, zi</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. de Sonini.</NOTE>. In most other countries they appear either single, or at most in pairs. Some∣times in the season of their passage numbers are found in the same district; but these are solitary individuals, unconnected by any social tie, so that when they are hunted, one rises after an∣other. Yet as they have all the same organi∣zation, they must be actuated by the same views; hence they direct their flight towards the same country, and follow nearly the same rout. They are scattered through almost the whole of the ancient continent, from Sweden, where they in∣habit the great forests, and even from the Ork∣neys and Lapland <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Schoeffer.</NOTE>, as far as the Canaries and the Cape of Good Hope on the one hand, and the islands of Ceylon and Java <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE> on the other.

It must, however, be confessed, that they do not constantly hold the same course; for it often happens, that though they appear numerous in a
<PB N="385" REF="418"/>
place one year, very few or none of them can be found there in the following year. In some countries too, such as England, they are very rare, and never nestle; in others, as in Bugey, they never occur at all. And since Bugey is mountainous, it follows that they are not attached to mountains, at least not to that degree which Aristotle supposed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Anim. <HI>Lib.</HI> I. 1.</NOTE>. But this is not the only fact which contradicts the assertion of that phi∣losopher; for the Hoopoes settle in the midst of our plains, and are frequently seen on the strag∣gling trees which grow on sandy islands, such as those of Camargue in Provence <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by the Marquis de Piolenc.</NOTE>. Frisch says that they can creep on the bark of trees like the woodpeckers; which is perfectly con∣sistent with analogy, since, like these birds, they nestle in the hollow trunks. In these they usually lay their eggs, and also in the holes of walls upon the mould or dust which is usually collected at the bottoms of such cavities, but do not line it with straw, as Aristotle says. Yet there are some exceptions, at least what are ap∣parently such: of six hatches that were brought to me, four of them had no litter, but the two others had a very soft bedding composed of leaves, moss, wool, feathers <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the bottom of one of these nests was more than two litrons of moss (a litron is a measure, the 16th part of a bushel) fragments of May-flies, and some worms that had no doubt dropt from the bill of the mother or of her young. The six trees in which these nests were found were three black cherries, two oaks, and a pear-tree; the lowest of these nests was three or four feet above the ground, the highest ten.</NOTE>, &amp;c. These
<PB N="386" REF="419"/>
seeming disparities may be reconciled; for it is very probable that the Hoopoe sometimes lays her eggs in nests that were, in the preceding year, occupied by woodpeckers, wrynecks, tit∣mice, and other birds, which had lined them according to their different instincts.</P>
<P>It has been long said and often repeated, that the Hoopoe besmears her nest with the excre∣ments of the wolf, of the fox, of the horse, of the cow, and of all sorts of animals, not ex∣cepting man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Salerne, Gerini, &amp;c. It is pretty singular that the an∣cients, who regarded the Hoopoe as an inhabitant of the mountains, of the forests, and of the deserts, should impute to it the employing human excrements for its nest. This is another particular fact in∣judiciously generalized: the mother, in collecting the insects for her young among filth, might dirty herself, and so pollute her nest; and superficial observers would thence conclude that this was a habit common to the whole species.</NOTE>; and that she does this with the view to defend her young by the loathsome stench <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It has also been said that her object was to dispel the charms that might be cast upon her brood; for the Hoopoe was reckoned very skilful in this way. She knew all the plants that defeat fas∣cinations, those which give sight to the blind, those which open barred gates; which last is propped by a fable equally absurd. Aelian gravely relates that a man having three times in succession closed the nest of a Hoopoe, and having remarked the herb with which the bird opened it, he employed the same herb with success to charm the locks of the strongest coffers. Death even does but heighten its virtues, and give them new energy; its heart, its liver, its brain, &amp;c. eaten, with certain magical incantations applied, sus∣pended to different parts of the body, occasioned pleasant or fright∣ful dreams, &amp;c. In England, it was formerly held an unlucky bird; and even at present, the people of Sweden regard its ap∣pearance as a presage of war. The ancients had better reason, me∣thinks, to believe that when it was heard to sing before the time when they usually began to dress the vine, it promised a good vin∣tage: in fact, its early song would imply a mild spring and a for∣ward season, which is ever favourable to the maturity of the vine, and to the quality of its fruit.</NOTE>. But the fact is not more true than the intention; for the Hoopoe never plasters the mouth of its nest like the nuthatch. At the same time, the nest is indeed very dirty and of∣fensive,
<PB N="387" REF="420"/>
the necessary consequence of its great depth, which is often twelve, fifteen, or even eigh∣teen inches: the young ones cannot throw out their excrements, and therefore grovel a long time among filth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Schwenckfeld was a child, he had his fingers dirted in taking a brood of Hoopoes out of a hollow oak.</NOTE>. Hence undoubtedly the proverb, "Nasty as a Hoopoe." But it is only in rear∣ing its young that this bird can be accused of nastiness; at other times it is very cleanly. The one which I before spoke of never soiled its mistress, nor the chairs, nor even the middle of the room, but always retired to the top of the bed, which was the remotest and most con∣cealed place.</P>
<P>The female lays from two to seven <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus and the authors of the British Zoology mention only two eggs. But this case is as rare, at least in our climates, as that of seven eggs. In the more northern countries, such as that of Sweden, the Hoopoe may be less prolific.</NOTE> eggs,
<PB N="388" REF="421"/>
but more commonly four or five; these eggs are greyish, somewhat larger than those of the par∣tridge. They do not all hatch at the same time; for three young Hoopoes, taken out of the same nest, differed very much in size; in the largest one, the quills of the tail had sprouted seventeen lines, and in the smallest only seven lines. The mother has often been seen carrying food to the nestlings, but I never heard that the father paid them that attention. As these birds hardly ever appear in knots, it is most likely that the family disperses as soon as the brood are fledged; and this is the more probable, if, as the authors of the <HI>Italian Ornithology</HI> assert, each pair makes two or three hatches in the course of the year, those of the first hatch might fly as early as the end of June.—These are the few facts and con∣jectures that I am able to offer in regard to the incubation of the Hoopoe and the education of its young.</P>
<P>The cry of the male is <HI>bou, bou, bou;</HI> it is most frequent in the spring, and may be heard at a great distance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristophanes thus expresses the cry of these birds: <HI>epopoe, popopo, popoe, popoe, io, io, ito, ito, ito, ito.</HI> I suspect he inclines to make them speak Greek. Of all the names that have been given to them, that which imitates their song the best is <HI>bou, bou;</HI> by which they are known in Lorrain, and in some other provinces of France. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greek, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifies <HI>to sing like a Hoopoe.</HI></NOTE>. Those who have listened attentively to these birds, pretend to have no∣ticed different inflections and accents, corres∣ponding to their different circumstances: some∣times
<PB N="389" REF="422"/>
a hollow moaning, which foreboded rain; sometimes a shriller cry, indicating a fox in sight, &amp;c. This character bears some analogy to the two voices of the tame Hoopoe men∣tioned above. That bird seemed fond of mu∣sic; whenever its mistress played on the harp∣sichord or the mandoline, it kept as near the in∣struments as possible during the whole time.</P>
<P>It is said that this bird never drinks at springs or brooks; and that, for this reason, it is sel∣dom caught in snares. It is true that the Hoopoe killed in Epping Forest in England shunned the numerous decoys laid for the pur∣pose of taking it alive; but the one which I have frequently mentioned had been caught in a net, and drank, from time to time, by plunging its bill with a brisk motion, and with∣out repeatedly lifting up its head, like many birds: it had probably a power of raising the water into its gullet by a kind of suction. The Hoopoes retain that brisk motion of the bill even at other times, when they neither eat nor drink; this habit must arise from their mode of living in the savage state; catching insects, cropping buds, boring into the mud for worms, or perhaps for earthy liquor alone, and search∣ing ants' nests for the eggs. If they be difficult to ensnare, they are easy to shoot; for they suf∣fer a person to come very near them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those who have judged of the Hoopoe from mythology, have represented it as very shy, and as seeking the heart of forests and the summits of mountains, to avoid man. Sportsmen assure me that this bird will not suffer them to get quite so near it in autumn; it having then, no doubt, acquired a little more experience.</NOTE>, and,
<PB N="390" REF="423"/>
though they fly with sudden jerks and in a tor∣tuous course, their motion is slow. They flap their wings in launching off, like the lap∣wing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Its resemblance, in its flight and in its crest and its size, to the lapwing, is certainly the cause why the same name Hoop has been applied to both birds.</NOTE>; and when they alight on the ground they walk with an even pace, like common hens.</P>
<P>They leave our northern climate about the end of August, or the beginning of autumn, and never stay till the cold sets in. But though they are birds of passage in Europe, it may hap∣pen in certain cases that some remain through the winter; such, for instance, as are wounded, or sick, or too young, or in short too feeble to undertake the distant voyage. These Hoopoes, which are thus left behind, will continue to lodge in the same holes where they nestled; they will pass the winter in a half-torpid state, requiring little food, and being hardly able to repair the loss of feathers occasioned by moulting. Some hunters, discovering them in that condition, have asserted that all the Hoopoes winter in hol∣low trees, benumbed, and divested of plum∣age <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Albertus, and Schwenckfeld. It is for this reason, says Agri∣cola, that they are seen in the spring almost featherless.</NOTE>, as has been said of the cuckoo, with as little foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="424"/>
According to some, the Hoopoe was among the Egyptians esteemed an emblem of filial piety; they took care, it was said, of their aged parents, cherished them under their wings, and in case of a tedious moulting, lent them as∣sistance in plucking the old feathers; they blew into their sore eyes, and applied healing herbs, and in a word repaid all the endearments they had received in their tender infancy. Some∣thing of this kind has been alleged of the stork. Would to God that we could give the same amiable character of all other species of ani∣mals.</P>
<P>The Hoopoe lives only three years, accord∣ing to Olina; but this must be in the domestic state, where the term of life is abridged by im∣proper food. It would be difficult to determine the extreme age of the free wild Hoopoe, par∣ticularly as it is a bird of passage.</P>
<P>As it has a great abundance of feathers, it appears thicker than in reality. It is about as large as a thrush, and it weighs from two ounces and a half to three or four, more or less, ac∣cording to its plumpness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"With all its feathers," says Belon, "it looks like a very large plgeon, but when plucked it appears scarce bigger than a stare."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Its crest is longitudinal, consisting of two rows of equal and parallel feathers; those in the middle of each row are longer than the rest, so that when they are erect they form a kind of
<PB N="392" REF="425"/>
semi-circle of two inches and a half in height <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>Lib. X.</HI> 29.</NOTE>. All these feathers are rufous, terminated with black; the middle ones, and those next them, have a shade of white between these two co∣lours. There are also six or eight feathers be∣hind, which belong to the crest, and which are entirely rufous, and are shorter than the others.</P>
<P>The rest of the crest, and all the fore part of the bird, are gray, verging sometimes on wine colour, and sometimes on rufous; the fore part of the back is gray, and the hind part is striped transversely with dirty white on a dark ground; there is a white spot on the rump; the superior coverts of the tail are blackish; the belly and the rest of the under side of the body are tawny white; the wings and tail are black striped with white; the ground of the feathers is slate co∣loured.</P>
<P>All these different colours, thus spread over the plumage, form together a sort of regular picture, which has a good effect when the bird erects its crest, expands its wings, and raises and displays its tail; the part of the wings next the body then shews on each side a black and white cross stripe, perpendicular to the axis of the body; the highest of these stripes has a rusty cast, and joins a horse-shoe of the same colour traced on the back, the convex part of which approaches the white spot on the rump;
<PB N="393" REF="426"/>
the lowest, which hems one half of the circum∣ference of the wing, runs into another broader bar, which crosses the same wing two inches from its tip, and parallel to the axis of the body; this last white stripe corresponds also to a crescent<SUP>*</SUP> of the same colour that intersects the tail at an equal distance from the end, and forms the frame of the picture: lastly, if we conceive the whole crowned by a raised tuft of gold colour edged with black, we shall have a much better idea of the plumage than could be got by describing each feather separately.</P>
<P>All the white bars which appear on the up∣per face of the wing appear also on the lower face, so that the bird has the same aspect when seen flying over head, except that the white is less tarnished or mixed with rusty.</P>
<P>I have seen a female, discovered to be such by dissection, which had all the same colours, and those equally distinct; perhaps it was of an advanced age. It was rather larger than the male, though the authors of the Italian Orni∣thology assert the contrary.</P>
<P>Total length about eleven inches; the bill two inches and a quarter (more or less accord∣ing to the age of the bird) slightly arched; the tip of the upper mandible projects a little be∣yond that of the lower mandible, and they are both pretty soft; the nostrils are oblong, and <NOTE PLACE="foot">† When the tail is entirely spread, this crescent changes into a straight bar.</NOTE>
<PB N="394" REF="427"/>
hardly shaded; the tongue is very short, almost lost in the gizzard, and forming a sort of equi∣lateral triangle, whose sides are not three lines in length; the ears are placed five lines from the opening of the bill, and in the same conti∣nuation; the tarsus is ten lines; the middle toe is joined to the outer toe by the first phalanx; the hind toe is longer and straighter, especially in old subjects; the alar extent above seventeen inches, the tail near four inches, consisting of ten equal quills (and not twelve, as Belon as∣serts), and projecting twenty lines beyond the wings, which have nineteen quills, the first be∣ing the shortest, and the nineteenth the longest.</P>
<P>The intestinal tube, from the gizzard to the anus, is twelve or eighteen inches; the gizzard is muscular, lined with a loose membrane which projects like a scabbard into the <HI>duodenum;</HI> the great diameter of the gizzard is from nine to fourteen lines; the smaller diameter from seven to twelve lines, and these parts are larger in the young birds than in the old ones. They have all a gall bladder, though but slight vestiges of a <HI>caecum;</HI> at the angle of the bifurcation of the <HI>trachea arteria,</HI> there are two holes covered by a very fine membrane; the two branches of the <HI>trachea arteria</HI> are formed behind by a similar membrane, and before by cartilaginous semi∣circular rings; the elevator muscle of the crest is implanted between the crown of the head and the base of the bill; when it is drawn back,
<PB N="395" REF="428"/>
the tuft rises, and when drawn towards the bill it collapses.</P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the HOOPOE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancients said that this bird was liable to change its colour in different seasons, which might be occasioned by moulting. But people who have reared Hoopoes have not perceived this alteration.</P>
<P>Belon mentions his knowing two species, though he does not assign their discriminating qualities; unless, perhaps, <HI>the handsome collar, partly black and partly white,</HI> and <HI>the reverted neck,</HI> which do not belong to our species, were intended to mark the distinction.</P>
<P>Commerson and Sonnerat have brought a Hoo∣poe from the Cape of Good Hope very like ours, and which the traveller Kolben had sound long before in the neighbourhood of the Cape. It has, upon the whole, the same plumage, the same shape, the same cry, the same gait, and eats nearly the same food; but on a closer inspection it will be perceived that it is rather smaller, its legs
<PB N="396" REF="429"/>
longer, its bill shorter in proportion, its tuft lower, and that there is no trace of white on the feathers that form the tuft; and in general, there is less variety in its plumage.</P>
<P>In another subject brought from the same country, the top of the back was of a pretty deep brown, and the belly variegated with white and brown; it was certainly a young one, for it was smaller than the rest, and its bill five lines shorter.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Marquis Gerini saw at Florence, and again on the Alps, near the town of Ronta, a very beautiful variety, whose tuft was edged with sky-blue.</P>

<P>THIS bird is distinguished from our Hoopoe, and its varieties, by its size; by its short and pointed bill; by its crest, of which the fea∣thers are lower in proportion, and also loose, as in the tufted cuckoo of Madagascar; by the number of quills in its tail, of which there are twelve; by the shape of its tongue, which is pretty broad, and the extremity divided into many threads; and lastly, by the colours of its plumage. The crest, the throat, and all the under side of the body, are white, without any spots; the upper side of the body, from the crest exclusively to the end of the tail, is brown, whose shades vary, and are much less intense on the fore parts; there is a white spot on the
<PB N="398" REF="431"/>
wing; the iris is of a bluish brown; the bill, the legs, and even the nails, are yellowish.</P>
<P>This bird inhabits the great forests of Mada∣gascar, of the isle of Bourbon, and of the Cape of Good Hope. In its stomach are found the seeds and berries of the <HI>pseudo-buxus;</HI> its weight is four ounces, but varies much, and must be more considerable in the months of June and July, at which time the bird is very fat.</P>
<P>Total length sixteen inches; the bill twenty lines, very pointed, the upper mandible having its edges scolloped near the tip, and its ridge very obtuse; it is longer than the lower mandi∣ble, which is as broad; on the palate, which in other respects is very smooth, there are small tuberosities, varying in number; the nostrils are like those of the ordinary Hoope; and so are the feet, except that the hind nail, which is the largest of all, is very hooked; the alar extent is eighteen inches; the tail four inches six lines, consisting of nearly equal quills, but the two middle ones are rather shorter; it pro∣jects about two inches and a half beyond the wings, which have eighteen quills. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Upupa Capensis:</HI> "It is crested and dusky, below white; a white spot on its wings."</NOTE></P>

When insects fail, it contents itself with small seeds, and even wheat <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The only one I had occasion to open with Dr. Remond had five large drones in its throat: Belon found, in the stomach of those which he opened, rape, parsley, and colewort seeds, wheat, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and, in collecting
<PB N="412" REF="447"/>
that food on the ground, it seems also to gather small pebbles like all the granivorous birds, and with the same view. Ray suspects, from many analogies, both internal and external, that the Bee-eater, as well as the king-fisher, feeds sometimes on flesh.</P>
<P>The Bee-eaters are very common in the island of Candia, insomuch that Belon, who was an eye-witness, says that they are seen flying in every part of it. He adds that the Greeks on the main land are unacquainted with it, which he could accurately learn from his travelling in that country; but he asserts, on too slight foun∣dations, that they are never seen in Italy; for Aldrovandus, who was a citizen of Bologna, as∣sures that they were common in the neighbour∣hood of that city, where they were usually caught both with nets and lime-twigs. Wil∣lughby saw them frequently at Rome, exposed to sale in the public markets; nor is it probable that they are strangers to the rest of Italy, since they are found in the south of France, where they are not regarded even as birds of passage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon doubts whether they remain the whole winter in the isle of Candia, but he had no observation on that head.

of ten or twelve into the more northern pro∣vinces; and we saw one of these flocks that had arrived in the vale of Sainte-Reine in Burgundy, on the 8th of May 1776: they kept constantly together, and called incessantly on each other; their cry was very noisy but agreeable, and re∣resembled somewhat the whistling that one might make with a bored nut <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Belon compares it to "the sound that a man would make by contracting his mouth into a round aperture and whistling <HI>grulgru∣rurul</HI> as load as an oriole."

<P>But it is well known that almost always the naturalist must in some measure modify the expressions of the poet.</P></NOTE>; they emitted it both when perched and when on the wing; they preferred the fruit trees which were then in blossom, and consequently frequented by the bees and wasps; they often dived from the branch to catch the little winged prey; they appeared always very timorous, and scarce suf∣fered a person to get near them: however one was shot separate from the others, perched upon a fir; the rest of the flock, which were in a neighbouring vineyard, frighted at the report, flew away all screaming together, and took shelter among some chesnuts that were at a lit∣tle distance; they continued to harbour among the vineyards, but in a few days they took their final departure.</P>

Another flock was seen in June 1777, in the vicinity of Anspach <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Gazette d'Agriculture, No. 55, <HI>année</HI> 1777.</NOTE>. Lottinger informs me that these birds seldom appear in Lorraine, that there are never more than two together, that they sit on the longest branches of trees and shrubs, and seem to feel embarrassed, as if they had strayed. They appear still seldomer in Swe∣den, where they haunt the sea-coast <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>. But they hardly ever visit England, though not so far north as Sweden, and to which they could easily pass from Calais <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Charleton and Willughby.</NOTE>. In the east, they are spread through the temperate zone, from India <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">M. Hasselquist says that they occur in the woods and plains between Acre and Nazareth.</NOTE> to Bengal <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>, and undoubtedly farther, though their course has not been traced.</P>
<P>These birds nestle, like the shore swallow and the king-fisher, in the bottom of holes, which they form with their short and strong feet and their iron bill, as the Sicilians term it, in little hillocks where the soil is loose, and sometimes in the shelving sandy brinks of large rivers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, and Kramer.</NOTE>: these holes are made more than six inches deep, and as wide. The female deposits, on a bedding of moss, four or five, or even six or seven white eggs, rather smaller than those of the blackbird. But their economy in these dark caverns cannot be observed; we know only that the young fa∣mily
<PB N="415" REF="450"/>
does not disperse; indeed several families must unite to form those numerous flocks which Belon saw in the island of Candia, settled among the ridges of the mountains, where the abun∣dance of thyme affords rich pasture to the bees and wasps.</P>
<P>The flight of the Bee-eater has been com∣pared to that of the swallow, which we have seen to resemble it in many other respects; it is also analogous to the king fisher, particularly in the beautiful colours of its plumage, and in the singular conformation of its feet; and lastly Dr. Lottinger, who is a close and accurate observer, finds that, in some particulars, it is akin to the goat-sucker.</P>
<P>A property which, were it well ascertained, would distinguish this bird from every other, is the habit, ascribed to it, of flying backwards. Aelian mightily admires this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Nat. Anim.</HI> Lib. I. 49.</NOTE>; but he had bet∣ter called it in question, for it is an error arising from some oversight. Such too is the filial piety that has been so liberally bestowed on birds, but most remarkably on the Bee-eater; since, if we believe Aristotle, Pliny, Aelian, and those who have copied them, the young ones do not wait till the parents need their assistance; as soon as they are flown they give a cheerful attendance, and carry provisions to their holes. It is easy to see that these are fables, but the moral at least is good.</P>

<P>THE natives of Madagascar call this bird <HI>Pa∣tirich tirich,</HI> which is manifestly formed from its cry, and which I have shortened and retained. The principal colour of its plumage is dull green, changing into brilliant chesnut on the head, not so dark on the upper side of the body, growing more dilute on the hind parts, still lighter on the lower parts, and continually melting away towards the tail: the wings are terminated with blackish; the tail is dull green; the throat is yellowish white at its origin, and fine chesnut at its lower part. But what best characterizes this bird and gives it a singular aspect, is a broad blackish bar, edged round its whole circumference with greenish white; this border bends about the base of the bill and grasps the origin of the neck, assuming a yellowish tinge, as I have before said; the bill is black, and the legs are brown. This bird is found in Madagascar; it is rather larger than the chesnut and blue Bee-eater.</P>

<P>A LITTLE accident which happened to a bird of this species, long after it was dead, af∣fords an instance of the mistakes which are apt to embarrass the nomenclature. It belonged to Mr. Dandridge, and was described, delineated, engraved, and coloured by two English natu∣ralists, Edwards and Albin: a Frenchman, well skilled in ornithology, and though he had a specimen beside him, has supposed that these two figures have represented two distinct species, and has in consequence described them sepa∣rately and under different denominations.</P>
<P>The bird of Mr. Dandridge observed by Ed∣wards was one-third smaller than the European Bee-eater, and the two middle quills of its tail were much longer and narrower; the front was blue, there was a great spot of the same colour on the throat, included in a sort of black frame formed below by a half-collar like a reversed crescent, and above by a bar which passed over the eyes and descended on both sides of the neck, stretching towards the two extremities of the half collar; the upper surface of the head and neck was orange; the back, the small coverts, and the last
<PB N="425" REF="460"/>
quills of the wings, were green, like the plumage of the parrot; the superior coverts of the tail were beryl blue; the breast and belly were light green; the thighs reddish brown; the inferior coverts of the tail dull green; the wings va∣riegated with green and orange, and terminated with black; the tail of a fine green above and dark green below; the two middle quills ex∣ceeding the lateral ones by more than two inches, and the projecting part deep brown and very narrow; the shafts of the quills of the tail very brown, and so were the legs; the bill, black above, and whitish below, at its base.</P>
<P>In the subject described by Brisson, which is also delineated in the <HI>Planches Enluminées,</HI> there was no blue on the front, and the green of the under side of the body partook of the beryl cast; the upper side of the head and of the neck was of the same gold green as the back; in general, there was a tint of gold yel∣low thrown loosely on the whole of the plum∣age, except on the quills of the wings and the superior coverts of the tail; the black bar did not extend across the eyes, but be∣low them. Brisson has remarked besides, that the wings were lined with fulvous, and that the shafts of the tail, which were brown above, as in Edwards' bird, were whitish beneath. Lastly, there were several quills and coverts of the wings, and many quills of the tail, edged near the end and tipt with gold yellow. But it is
<PB N="426" REF="461"/>
obvious that all these minute differences are not more than might be expected in individuals of even the same species, but only diversified by age or sex; the slight variation of size may be imputed to the same causes.</P>
<P>The bird called by Brisson <HI>the little Philippine Bee-eater,</HI> is of the same size and plumage with the collared Bee-eater of Madagascar; the chief difference remarked between them is, that in the former the two middle quills of the tail, in∣stead of being longer than the lateral ones, are, on the contrary, rather shorter. But Brisson himself suspects that these middle quills were not yet fully grown, and that in those subjects where they were complete they projected far beyond the lateral ones: this is the more probable, as these two middle quills appear, in the present case, to be different from the lateral ones, and even nearly akin to the projecting part of the middle quills in the blue-throated green Bee∣eater. The other differences are these; that the bar was not black, but of a dull green, and that the legs were brown red: but still it ought to be referred to the same species. This bird is spread from the coast of Africa to the most eastern of the Asiatic islands; it is nearly as large as our sparrow.</P>

<P>M. de Montbeillard, author of this article, remarks with great justice, that the names <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tette-Chevre;</NOTE> <HI>Goat-sucker,</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Crapand Volant;</NOTE> <HI>Flying-toad,</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Grand Merle;</NOTE> <HI>Great Black∣bird,</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Corbeau de Nuit;</NOTE> <HI>Night Crow, and</HI> <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hi∣rondelle a Queue Carrée.</NOTE> <HI>Square-tailed Swallow,</HI> ought to be re∣jected as founded on prejudice and inaccurate observation. The first of these appellations, though ancient and generally admitted, is highly improbable, and contradicted by fact; for Schwenckfeld made particular enquiries in a country where numerous flocks of goats are kept in folds, but could never discover that they were sucked by any bird whatever. The other names ought equally to be rejected; it is surely not a toad, or a blackbird, or a crow, or an owl. Nor is it even a swallow, though much akin to it; for its external figure and its habits are different: its legs are short, its bill small, its throat wide; its food too, and its mode of prey∣ing, are not the same. M. de Montbeillard adopts the appella∣tion <HI>Engoulevent</HI> (guttler), given in some provinces of France, which, though vulgar, conveys a distinct idea of the bird in its state of activity; its wings spread, its look haggard, its throat extended to its utmost width, and wheeling with a hoarse buzzing noise in pursuit of insects, which it seems to <HI>guttle (engouler)</HI> by drawing in its breath.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

before sun-set <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence Aristotle calls it a lazy bird.</NOTE>, and it never takes wing in the middle of the day, except in dark cloudy wea∣ther, or when obliged to make its escape. Its eyes are so delicate as to be dazzled and over-powered by the meridian effulgence, and they perform their office only in a weak light. But we must not suppose that it can distinguish ob∣jects and fly in total darkness; the proper time for its excursions, and indeed for those of all the other nocturnal birds, is the dusk of the even∣ing.</P>
<P>The Goat-sucker needs not shut its bill to se∣cure the winged insects; for a sort of glue oozes from the palate, which entangles them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Hebert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Goat-suckers are widely scattered, yet in no place are they common. They are found in almost all the countries of our continent,

from Sweden, and even the more northern tracts, to Greece and Africa, on the one hand; and to India, and, no doubt, still farther, on the other. Sonnerat has sent a specimen for the Royal Cabinet, from the coast of Coromandel; which is certainly either a young one or a fe∣male, since it, in no respect, differs from the common kind, except that it wants those white spots on the head and wings which Linnaeus re∣gards as the peculiar character of the adult male. The commander de Godeheu informs us, that, in the month of April, the south west wind brings these birds to Malta <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Savans Etrangers, <HI>t. III.</HI> 91.</NOTE>; and the Chevalier Des∣mazis, an excellent observer, writes to me that they repass in as great plenty in autumn. They occur both in flat and in mountainous countries; in Brie, in Bugey, in Sicily <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A well informed traveller informs me, that on the mountains of Sicily these birds appear an hour before sun-set, and spread in search of food in company with the bee-eaters, and that sometimes five or six fly together.</NOTE>, and in Holland, and almost always under a bush, or in young copses, or about vineyards; they seem to pre∣fer the dry stony tracts, the heaths, &amp;c. In the cold countries they arrive later, and retire earlier <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In England they appear about the end of May, and retire about the middle of August, according to the British Zoology. In France M. Hebert saw them in the month of November; and a sportsman assured me that he has met with them in win∣ter.</NOTE>. They breed on their progress, as the
<PB N="439" REF="475"/>
situations invite <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fowlers whom I have consulted affirm that they never breed in the canton of Burgundy which I inhabit (l'Auxois), and that they appear there only in the time of vintage.</NOTE>; sometimes more southerly, at other times more northerly. They are at little trouble in forming their nest; they are content with any small hole which they hap∣pen to find in the earth, or among small stones, at the foot of a tree or the bottom of a rock. The female lays two or three eggs, larger than those of the blackbird, and of a darker colour <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They are oblong, whitish, and spotted with brown, says M. Salerne; marbled with brown and purple on a white ground, says the Count Ginanni, in the Italian Ornithology: the latter adds, that the shell is extremely thin.</NOTE>; and though the affection of parents is in general proportioned to the care bestowed in providing for their accommodation, the Goat-sucker is not wanting in tender attentions: on the con∣trary, I am assured that she hatches with the greatest solicitude, and, when she perceives the threats or keen observation of an enemy, she changes her site, pushing the eggs dexterously, it is said, with her wings, and rolling them into another hole, which, though not better fashioned, will, she imagines, afford a safer con∣cealment.</P>
<P>The season when these birds appear most fre∣quent, is autumn; they fly nearly like the woodcock, and they have the gestures of the owl. Sometimes they tease and disturb sports∣men who are on the watch. They have an odd
<PB N="440" REF="476"/>
sort of habit, which is peculiar to them; they wheel an hundred times in succession round some large naked tree, with a very irregular and rapid motion; at intervals they dive brisk∣ly, as if to catch their prey, and then rise as suddenly. In such cases they are undoubt∣edly engaged in pursuit of the insects that flut∣ter about the aged trunks; but it is then difficult to get within gun-shot of them, for they quick∣ly disappear, nor can their retreat be discovered.</P>
<P>As the Goat-sucker flies with its bill open, and with considerable rapidity, the air continu∣ally strikes against the sides of its throat, and occasions a sort of buzzing, like the noise of a spinning-wheel: this whirring infallibly takes place whenever the bird is on the wing, but it varies according to the celerity of the flight. Hence the name of <HI>wheel-bird,</HI> by which it is known in some counties of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author means Wales, where this bird is called <HI>Aderyny dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell,</HI> which in fact signifies <HI>wheel-bird.</HI> T.</NOTE>. But is this noise generally regarded unlucky, as Belon, Klein, and others who have copied them, as∣sert? Or is it not rather a mistake occasioned by confounding the Goat-sucker with the white owl? When it sits, it utters its true cry, which is a plaintive tone repeated three or four times in succession; but we are not quite certain whether this is ever heard while the bird is on the wing.</P>
<P>It seldom perches, and when it does, it is said
<PB N="441" REF="477"/>
not to cling across the branch, like most other birds, but to sit length wise, resembling the pos∣ture of the cock in <HI>treading (cochant</HI> or <HI>cho∣chant)</HI> the hen; and hence the name <HI>chauche∣branche.</HI> It is a solitary bird, and is, for the most part, single; seldom two are found toge∣ther, and, even then, they are ten or twelve paces from one another.</P>
<P>I have said that the Goat-sucker flies like the woodcock; their plumage also is similar, for all the upper side of the neck, of the head, and of the body, and even the under side, is gaily variegated with gray and blackish, with more or less of a rusty cast on the neck, the scapular feathers, the cheeks, the throat, the belly, the coverts, and the quills of the tail and wings; but the deepest shades appear on the upper sur∣face of the head, of the throat, of the breast, on the fore part of the wings, and on their tips: there is such variety that the ideas would be lost in the <HI>minutiae</HI> of description; I shall there∣fore only add the characteristic properties. The lower jaw is edged with a white stripe that ex∣tends behind the head; there is a spot of the same colour on the inside of the three first quills of the wing, and at the ends of the two or three outmost quills of the tail; but these spots are peculiar to the male, according to Linnaeus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby observed an individual in which these spots were of a pale yellow, tinged with purple, and obscurely marked: I perceived the same thing in two subjects; they are probably fe∣males, and the one, which is smaller than the other, I judge to be younger.</NOTE>: the head is large; the eyes very

protuberant; the hole of the ears pretty consi∣derable; the aperture of the throat ten times wider than that of the bill; the bill small, flat, and somewhat hooked; the tongue short, point∣ed, not divided at the tip; the nostrils round, and their edge projecting towards the bill; the skull transparent; the nail of the mid-toe in∣dented, as in the heron; and lastly, the three fore toes are connected by a membrane as far as the first phalanx.

<HEAD>FOREIGN BIRDS, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE GOAT-SUCKER.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is only one species of this genus settled in the three divisions of the old continent; but ten or twelve are found in the new. We might therefore regard America as their original and chief abode, from which the European Goat-sucker has been expelled by some fortuitous event: and as the colony ought ever to be subordinate to the mother-state, the order of nature would require that the Ameri∣can species should precede those of Europe. This arrangement we would have followed; but a more cogent reason recommends a different plan. The order of the understanding is to proceed from what is well ascertained to what is more ob∣scure: we therefore begin with the European birds, which are best known to us, and which will tend to illustrate those of other climates; leaving to the American philosophers to begin their natural history (and would to God that they would compose one!) with the produc∣tions of America.</P>
<P>The principal attributes of the Goat-suckers are these: the bill is flat at its base, the point being slightly hooked, apparently small, but having a gape wider than the head, according
<PB N="444" REF="480"/>
to some authors; large protuberant eyes, like those of nocturnal birds; and long black whisk∣ers about the bill: the effect of the whole gives it a dull, stupid aspect, and declares it a sloth∣ful, ignoble race, allied to the martins and the nocturnal birds, and yet so nicely characteristic, that it is easy at the first sight to distinguish the Goat-sucker from every other bird: their wings and tail are long, the latter seldom forked, and then in a very slight degree, and is composed of ten quills only: their legs are short, and, for the most part, rough; the three fore toes are connected together by a membrane as far as the first joint: the hind toe is moveable, and turns forward sometimes; the nail of the middle toe is commonly indented on the inner edge: the tongue is pointed, and not divided at the end: the nostrils are tubulated, that is, the project∣ing brims form on the bill the beginning of a small cylinder: the opening of the ear is wide, and probably its hearing is very acute; and we might even expect this to be the case in a bird which has a weak sight and hardly any smell, for, the ear being thus alone capable of intimat∣ing what passes at a distance, the bird will na∣turally be led to improve that organ. The pro∣perties now enumerated are not, however, found in all the species; some there are which have no whiskers; others that have more than ten quills in the tail; others in which the middle nail is not indented; in some it is indented, not
<PB N="445" REF="481"/>
on the inner edge, but on the outer; in others the nostrils are not tubulated; in others the hind nail seems incapable of being turned for∣wards. But, what is common to all the spe∣cies, their organs of sight are too delicate to support the light of day; and from this single property are derived the chief circumstances which discriminate the Goat-suckers from the swallows. Hence they appear not till sun-set in the evening, and retire in the morning a lit∣tle after sun-rise; hence they live solitary, dis∣quieted by gloomy apprehensions; hence the difference of their cry; hence, too, in my opi∣nion, is owing their not building a nest, for the weakness of their sight does not permit them to choose and arrange, and interweave, the mate∣rials. In fact, I know not of any bird that builds during the night, and the Goat-sucker can, in our latitudes, have only three hours of twilight, which is entirely consumed in pursu∣ing their humble fugacious prey. Of all the owls the eagle one is said alone to make a nest; and it the least deserves the appellation of noc∣turnal bird, since it can fly to considerable dis∣tances in broad daylight. The little owl, which hunts and catches small birds before the setting and after the rising of the sun, gathers only a few leaves, or stalks of herbs, and upon these drops the eggs in the holes of rocks or of old walls, Lastly, the long-eared, the white, the aluco, and the brown, owls, which of all the
<PB N="446" REF="482"/>
nocturnal birds are the least capable of support∣ing the light of the sun, lay also in similar cre∣vices, or in hollow trees, but without any lin∣ing, or sometimes in the nests of other birds which they find ready formed. And I might assert the same thing in general of all birds whose eye is excessively delicate.</P>
<P>Another consequence resulting from the too exquisite mechanism of the organ of sight, is that the Goat-suckers, like the other nocturnal birds, have no brilliant colour in their plumage, and are denied even the rich varying gloss which glistens on the sober attire of the swallow: black, and white, and gray, arising from the mixture of these, and rufous, form the whole garb of the Goat-suckers, and these are so in∣termingled that the general complexion is dusky and confused. They shun the light, and light is the source of all the fine colours. Linnets, kept in the cage, lose that charming red which glowed in all its beauty when in free air they imbibed the direct influence of the solar beams. It is not in the frozen tracts of Norway, or in Cimmerian shades of Lapland, that we find the birds of paradise, the cotingas, the flamingos, the humming birds, and the peacocks; those dreary neglected climates never produce the ruby, the sapphire, or the topaz. And lastly, those flow∣ers which are forced at great expence in the hot-house, acquire but a sickly hue that cannot compare with the brilliant colours which a ver∣nal
<PB N="447" REF="483"/>
sun sheds on the spontaneous growth of the painted meadow. The night-flies, it is true, are sometimes decked with charming tints; but this apparent exception seems even to corrobo∣rate my idea: for intelligent observers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Roesel. <HI>Insecten belustigung,</HI> t. I. <HI>Vorbericht zu der nachct-voe∣gel ers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en classe.</HI></NOTE> remark that those of them which flutter sometimes in the day are more gaudily attired than such as appear not until evening. I have myself perceived, that in those insect tribes which issue forth at sun-set, the colours resemble the dusky cast of the Goat-suckers; and, if among the vast num∣ber there be some with dazzling wings, we may suppose that the tints were already formed in their <HI>larvae,</HI> which enjoy the enlivening influ∣ence of the sun-beams in an equal degree as those of the diurnal flies. Lastly, the chrysa∣lids of these, which are constantly disclosed and exposed to the open air, shine for the most part with brilliant colours, and some of them appear decorated with scales of gold and of silver, which we should in vain expect to find in the chrysalids of the nocturnal flies, enveloped, as they are, with shells, or buried in the earth. I conceive, therefore, that I am warranted to infer, that if a series of observations were made upon the plumage of birds, the wings of insects, and per∣haps the hair of quadrupeds <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The plumage of the king-fisher is much more brilliant be∣tween the tropics than in the temperate zone, as we learn from Forster, in Captain Cook's second Voyage.</NOTE>, those species
<PB N="448" REF="484"/>
would be discovered to have the richest and most brilliant colours, which, other circumstances be∣ing alike, were most exposed to the action of the light.</P>
<P>If my conjectures have some foundation, the intelligent reader will not be surprised that dif∣ferent degrees of sensibility in the same organ may produce considerable differences in the na∣tural habits of an animal and in its properties both external and internal.</P>

<P>IF, as in all probability, Europe owes its Goat-suckers to America, this undoubtedly is the species which crossed the northern straits to found a colony in the ancient continent. It in∣habits North America, and its size and plum∣age are similar to those of the European kind: its lower jaw is edged with white, and there is a spot of the same colour on the margin of the wing. The chief difference consists in this, that the under part of the body is variegated, not with small cross lines, but with small lon∣gitudinal
<PB N="449" REF="485"/>
ones, and that the bill is longer. And would not the great change of climate be suf∣ficient to produce such change in the shape and plumage of the bird?</P>
<P>Of the habits of this bird we learn the fol∣lowing particulars from Catesby: it appears in the evening, but never so frequently as in dark cloudy weather, whence it derives the appella∣tion of <HI>Rain-bird;</HI> it pursues with open jaws the insects on which it feeds, and it flies with a whirring noise; lastly, it lays on the ground, and its eggs are like those of the lapwing.

<P>THESE birds arrive in Virginia about the mid∣dle of April, particularly in the back parts of the country. There they cry the whole night in a voice so shrill and so loud, and re∣peated and encreased to such a degree by the echoes of the mountains, that one can hardly sleep in their neighbourhood. They begin a few minutes after sun-set, and continue till dawn. They seldom appear near the coast, and still seldomer during the day. They lay two eggs of a dirty green, variegated with small spots, and small blackish streaks; the female drops them carelessly in the middle of a path, without forming any nest, without gathering moss or straw, and even without scraping the ground; and when she hatches, one may ap∣proach very near before she takes to flight.</P>
<P>Many believe the Whip-poor Will to be of ill omen. The savages are persuaded that the souls of such of their ancestors as were massacred by the English have passed into the bodies of these birds, and allege as a proof, their being never seen prior to the settlement of the colony. But
<PB N="451" REF="487"/>
this fact shews only that the strangers intro∣duced new species of cultivation, which invited new tribes of birds.</P>
<P>The upper side of the head and of all the body, as far as the superior coverts and quills of the tail inclusively, and even the middle quills of the wings, are of a deep brown, ra∣diated transversely with a lighter brown, and sprinkled with small spots of the same colour, with a very irregular mixture of cinereous; the superior coverts of the wings are the same, only sprinkled with a few spots of light brown; the great quills of the wings are black, the five first marked with a white spot near the middle of their length, and the two outer pairs of the tail are marked similarly near the end the cir∣cle of the eye is light brown, verging on cine∣reous; there is a series of orange spots, which begins at the base of the bill, passes above the eyes, and descends upon the sides of the neck; the throat is covered with a broad reversed cre∣scent, white at the top and tinged with orange at the bottom, and whose horns point on both sides to the ears; all the rest of the lower part is white, tinged with orange, and striped across with blackish; the bill is black, and the legs flesh coloured. This Goat-sucker is a third smaller than the European, and its wings are longer in proportion.</P>

<P>THOUGH Brisson makes no distinction be∣tween the <HI>guira</HI> described by Sloane and the one described by Marcgrave, I conceive that they ought to be discriminated and regarded as at least varieties of climate: I shall state my reasons when I treat of Marcgrave's Guira. In that of Sloane the head and neck are variegated with the colour of Spanish tobacco, and with
<PB N="453" REF="489"/>
black; the belly and the superior coverts of the tail and of the wings, variegated with whitish; the quills of the tail and of the wings variegated with deep brown and white; the lower jaw al∣most featherless; the head, on the contrary, is over-charged with them; the eye-balls protrude from the socket about three lines; the pupil is whitish, and the iris orange.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Brazil; it inhabits the woods, lives upon insects, and flies only in the night.</P>
<P>Total length sixteen inches; the bill two inches, and of a triangular shape; its base is three inches, somewhat hooked, and edged with long whiskers; the nostrils are placed in a pretty large groove; the throat is wide; the tarsus three lines; the alar extent thirty inches; the tail eight inches; the tongue small and tri∣angular; the stomach whitish, slightly mus∣cular, containing half-digested beetles; the li∣ver red, divided into two lobes, the one on the right, and the other on the left; the intestines are rolled into many circumvolutions.</P>
<P>The Guira of Marcgrave has two very ob∣vious characters which are not found in the de∣scription of Sloane, but which could not have escaped so accurate an observer. These are the gold collar and the two middle quills of the tail, which are much longer than the la∣teral ones: besides, it is smaller, for Marc∣grave
<PB N="454" REF="490"/>
reckons it not to exceed the lark; and it is difficult to suppose that such a bird would measure thirty inches across the wings, as Sloane states it. There are also some dif∣ferences in the plumage, which conspire to show that it is a variety from climate. Its head is broad, flat, and large; its eyes large; its bill is small, with a wide aperture; its body is round; its plumage is ash-brown, variegated with yellow and whitish; it has a gold col∣lar tinged with brown; the edges of the bill, near its base, are beset with long black whisk∣ers; the fore toes are connected by a short membrane; the nail of the mid-toe is indent∣ed; the wings have six quills; the tail eight, including the two middle ones, which project beyond the rest. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Caprimulgus Jamaicensis:</HI> "It is variegated with longitudinal ferruginous and black streaks; the space about its eyes clothed with a disk of plumules; its wings brown and spotted; its tail cinereous, variegated with black spots and dark brown stripes."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS Brasilian bird has all the characters of the Goat-suckers: its head is broad and flat, its eyes large, its bill small, its throad wide; its legs short, the mid-toe indented on its inner edge, &amp;c.; but what is peculiar to it, is the ha∣bit of expanding its tail from time to time. Its head and all the upper side of its body are blackish, sprinkled with small spots, mostly white, some of them tinged with yellow; the under side of its body white, variegated with black, as in the sparrow-hawk, and its legs are white.</P>
<P>It is nearly as large as the swallow; its tongue very small; its nostrils open; the tarsus six lines; the tail two inches, and exceeds not the wings.</P>

to the Ibijau in its size, in the length of its wings, and in the proportions of its other dimen∣sions, and in the blackish cast of its plumage spotted with a lighter colour; these spots are rufous or gray, except on the neck, whose fore part has a sort of white collar, not mentioned by Marcgrave in his description of the Ibijau, and which chiefly distinguishes this variety; the under side of the body is also darker.</P>
<P>Total length eight inches; the bill fifteen lines, black, beset with small bristles; the tail two inches and a half.</P>

<P>The <HI>Grand Goat-sucker,</HI> Lath.</P></Q></NOTE>. The difference of bulk is very considerable, it being as large as an owl, and its bill so wide as to admit the hand; in other respects the colours and propor∣tions are the same as in the little Ibijau. Marc∣graves does not inform us whether it also spreads its tail; nor does he mention that there is a horn on the fore part of the head and behind it a small tuft, as his figure seems to represent. But it is well known that Marcgrave's figures art inaccurate, and that more reliance ought to be had on the text.</P>
<P>With this species we should also range the great Goat-sucker of Cayenne, both on account of its bulk, and of its plumage, which is spotted with black, with fulvous and with white,
<PB N="457" REF="493"/>
principally on the back, the wings, and the tail; the upper side of the head and of the neck, and the under side of the body, are striped trans∣versely with different shades of the same co∣lours; but the general cast of the breast is browner, and forms a sort of cincture. M. de Sonini saw one whose plumage was darker, and which had been found in the hollow of an ex∣ceeding large tree; this is its ordinary abode, but it prefers those trees which grow near water. It is at once the largest of the Goat-suckers known in Cayenne, and the most solitary.</P>
<P>Total length twenty-one inches; the bill three inches long, and as broad, the upper man∣dible has a deep scalloping on both sides near the point, the lower mandible fits into these scallops, and its edges are reflected outwards; the nostrils are flat and shaded by the feathers of the base of the bill, which grow forwards; the tarsus is eleven lines, feathered almost to the toes; the nails are hooked, hollowed below by a furrow, which is parted into two by a longitudinal ridge; the mid-toe is not indented, but is very large, and appears even more so on account of a mem∣branous ledge on each side; the tail nine inches, a little tapered; the wings project some lines beyond it.</P>

<P>THE protuberant nostrils of this bird have some resemblance to a pair of spectacles, and hence its name of <HI>Spectacle Goat-sucker (En∣joulevent à Lunettes):</HI> that of <HI>Haleur</HI> evidently alludes to its cry.</P>
<P>This Goat-sucker lives upon insects, like all the others; and, in its internal conformation, it resembles the guira of Sloane, with which it consorts: it inhabits both Jamaica and Guiana; its plumage is variegated with gray, with black, and with the colour of withered leaves; its bill is black; its legs brown; and there is abund∣ance of feathers in the head and under the throat.</P>
<P>The length, according to Sloane, is seven inches; the bill is small but wide; the upper mandible somewhat hooked, three lines long (reckoning, no doubt, from the root of the feathers on the front) edged with black whisk∣ers;

<P>ALL the birds of this genus are variegated, but this is more so than the rest; it is the most common in Cayenne; it frequents the planta∣tions, the roads, and other cleared parts. When on the ground it utters a feeble cry, attended constantly with a shivering of the wings, and resembling the croaking of the toad: It has also another cry like the barking of a dog. It is not shy, and when scared, it never flies to any great distance.</P>
<P>The head is delicately striped with black on a gray ground, with some shades of rufous; the upper side of the neck is striped with the same colours, but not so nicely: on each side of the head are five parallel bars, striped with black on a rufous ground; the throat is white, and
<PB N="460" REF="496"/>
also the fore part of the neck; the back is striped across with blackish on a rufous ground; the breast and belly are striped also, but less regu∣larly, and sprinkled with a few white spots; the lower belly and the thighs are whitish, spot∣ted with black; the small and middle coverts of the wings are variegated with rufous and black, so that rufous predominates on the small ones, and black on the middle ones; the great ones are terminated with white, which forms a cross bar of that colour; the quills of the wings are black; the five first marked with white two thirds or three fourths of their length; the superior coverts and the two middle quills of the tail are striped across with blackish on a gray ground, clouded with black; the lateral quills edged with white; and this edging is broader as the quill is more exterior; the iris is yellow, the bill black, and the legs yellowish∣brown.</P>
<P>Total length about seven inches and a half; the bill ten lines, beset with bristles; the tarsus five lines; the tail three inches and a half, and projecting about an inch beyond the wings.</P>

<HEAD>VII. THE SHARP-TAILED GOAT-SUCKER. <HI>L'Engoulevent Acutipenne de la Guyana,</HI> Buff. <HI>Caprimulgus Acutus,</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THIS bird differs from the preceding not only in its dimensions, but in the shape of its tail feathers, which are pointed. It is distin∣guished also by the colours of its plumage. The upper surface of the head and neck is striped transversely, but not delicately, with tawny brown and black; the sides of the head are va∣riegated with the same colours, only rufous pre∣dominates; the back is striped with black on a gray ground, and the under surface of the body on a rufous ground; the wings are nearly as in the preceding species; the quills of the tail are striped across with brown on a pale cloudy rufous, terminated with black, but a little white precedes this black tip; the bill and legs are black.</P>
<P>It is said that these birds sometimes associate with the bats; which is not very extraordinary, since they leave their retreats at the same hours, and pursue the same prey. Probably these are the same with the small species mentioned by M. de la Borde, which nestle like the wood

The quills of the wings were not so black as in the preceding species, and were striped across with gray; those of the tail were striped with brown on a gray ground variegated with brown, without any white spots; the bill was brown above, and yellowish below.</P>

<P>MONTVOYAU is the cry of this bird, which pronounces distinctly the three syllables, and repeats them very often in the evening among the bushes. Like the European Goat∣sucker, it has a white spot on each of the five first quills of the wing, of which the ground is black, and another white spot or bar which rises from the corner of the bill, and stretches for∣wards, but extends also under the neck, in which circumstance it differs; and besides it has in general more of the fulvous and rusty co∣lours in its plumage, which is almost wholly variegated with these two colours; yet these assume different shades and modifications in dif∣ferent parts; cross stripes on the lower region of the body, and the middle quills of the wings; longitudinal stripes on the upper side of the head and neck; oblique stripes on the top of the back; and lastly, there are irregular spots on the rest of the upper side of the body, where the ful∣vous assumes a gray cast.</P>

<HEAD>X. The RUFOUS GOAT-SUCKER of CAYENNE. <HI>Caprimulgus Rufus,</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>RUFOUS clouded with blackish forms almost all the ground of the plumage; and black variously intense constitutes its whole orna∣ment: it is disposed in longitudinal, oblique, irregular bars, on the head and the upper side of the body; it makes a fine irregular trans∣verse striping on the throat, a little broader on the fore part of the neck, the under side of the body, and of the legs; then a little broader on the superior coverts and on the inner edge of the wing near its extremity; lastly, broadest of all on the quills of the tail. Some spots are scattered here and there on the body, both above and below. In general, blackish predominates on the top of the belly; rufous on the lower belly, and still more on the inferior coverts of the tail; the middle part of the great quills of the wings presents small squares alternately ru∣fous and black, checkered almost as regularly as spots on a chess board; the iris is yellow, the bill light brown, and the legs flesh coloured.</P>
<P>Total length ten inches and a half; the bill twenty-one lines; the tail four inches and two thirds, exceeding the wings six lines.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="501"/>
I have seen at M. Mauduits' a Goatsucker, from Louisiana, of the same size with this, and very similar, only the cross stripes had more inter∣vening spaces, and the rufous was lighter, which formed a kind of collar; the rest of the under side of the body was striped as in the preceding; the bill black at the point, and yellowish at the base.</P>
<P>Total length eleven inches; the bill two inches, edged with eight or ten stiff bristles, bending forward; the tail five inches, and pro∣jecting a very little beyond the wings.</P>

<P>WE have seen that the goat-suckers may be reckoned night Swallows, and that the only essential difference between them and the real Swallows consists in the excessive deli∣cacy of their eyes, and its influence on their structure and habits. In both tribes of birds the bill is small, and the throat wide; the legs short, and the wings long; the head flat, and the neck scarce visible; and both live upon in∣sects which they catch in the air. But, 1. The Swallows have no bristles about the bill; the nail of the mid-toe is not indented; their tail contains two more quills, and, in most of the species, it is forked; and they are in general smaller than the goat-suckers.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though the colours are nearly the same
<PB N="467" REF="503"/>
in both, consisting of black, of brown, of gray, of white, and of rufous, they are disposed in large spots on the Swallows, and better con∣trasted; and the plumage has a bright varying gloss.</P>
<P N="3">3. The goat-suckers entangle the night-flies with the viscous saliva that trickles within their mouth; but the Swallows, and also the martins, snap the winged insects, and the sud∣den closing of their bill occasions a sort of crack∣ing noise.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Swallows are more social than the goat-suckers; they often gather in numerous flocks; and in certain circumstances they lend mutual assistance, as in building their nests.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this construction they generally dis∣play much attention and art; and if a few spe∣cies lay in the holes of walls, or in such as they form in the ground, they choose excavations of a sufficient depth to afford protection for their young, and they provide whatever will contri∣bute to convenience, warmth, and ease.</P>
<P N="6">6. The manner in which the Swallows fly differs in two principal points from that of the goat-suckers. It is not attended with that whirring noise which I have before mentioned, because the bill is not kept open: and though their wings seem not better calculated for mo∣tion, they wheel with much greater boldness, celerity, and continuance; because the distinct∣ness of their vision permits them to exert all
<PB N="468" REF="504"/>
their force. They live habitually in the air, and perform their various functions in that ele∣ment. The flight of the swallow is perhaps less rapid than that of the falcon, but it is easier and more unrestrained; the one darts forward with vigour, the other glides smoothly through the air: she shoots in every direction to survey, as it were, her aerial domain; and her shrill slender notes express the cheerfulness of her condition: sometimes she pursues the fluttering insects, and nimbly follows their devious wind∣ing tracks, or leaves one to hunt another, and snaps a third as it passes: sometimes she escapes the impetuosity of the bird of prey by the quick flexures of her course. She can always com∣mand her swiftest motion, and in an instant change its direction; and she describes lines so mutable, so varied, so interwoven, and so con∣fused, that they can hardly be pictured by words.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Swallows seem not to be peculiar to either continent, and as many species nearly are diffused through the old as through the new. They are found in Norway and in Japan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer.</NOTE>, on the coasts of Egypt and those of Guinea, and at the Cape of Good Hope <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Villaut and Kolben.</NOTE>. What country is inaccessible to their easy swift course? But sel∣dom they remain the whole year in the same climate; those of Europe continue only during
<PB N="469" REF="505"/>
the summer months, appearing at the vernal equinox, and retiring at the autumnal. Aris∣totle, who wrote in Greece, and Pliny, who copied him in Italy, assert that the Swallows pass into the milder climates to winter, when these are not very distant; but that, in other cases, they seek a lodgment in the warm shel∣tered dales. Aristotle adds that many of them have been found thus concealed with not a single feather on their body <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. VIII. 12 and 16. Plin. <HI>Hist. Nat.</HI> Lib. X. 24.</NOTE>. This opi∣nion, countenanced by the authority of great names, and supported by facts, became popu∣lar, insomuch that even poets drew their com∣parisons from it <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Vel qualis gelidis, pluma labente, pruinis</P>
<P>Arboris immoritur trunco brumalis hirundo.</P></Q>
<P>CLAUD.</P></NOTE>. Several modern observa∣tions seemed to confirm it <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Albertus, Augustinus Nyphus, Gaspar Heldelin, and some others, aver that they frequently found during winter, in Germany, Swallows torpid in hollow trees, and even in their nests, which is not absolutely impossible.</NOTE>; and, with some modifications, it might have been brought to the truth. But a bishop of Upsal, <HI>Olaus Mag∣nus,</HI> and a Jesuit, named <HI>Kircher,</HI> amplifying the assertion of Aristotle, already too general, have asserted that, in the northern countries, the fishermen often find in their nets heaps of Swallows grouped together and close entan∣gled with each other, bill to bill, feet to feet,
<PB N="470" REF="506"/>
and wings to wings; that when these birds are carried to stoves they quickly recover from their torpor, but die soon after; and that none sur∣vive the renovation of their vital powers, ex∣cept such as gently feel the growing warmth of the season, and, rising slowly from the bot∣tom of the lakes, are, with all the successive gradations, restored by nature to their true ele∣ment. This assertion has been repeated, em∣bellished, and loaded with more extraordinary circumstances; and, as if it were not sufficient∣ly marvellous, some have added that, about the beginning of autumn, these birds plunge in crowds into the wells and cisterns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. Ant. Tolentinus.</NOTE>. I must confess, that many authors and other persons, respectable by their character or rank, have be∣lieved in this phaenomenon. Linnaeus himself has given a sort of sanction to it by his autho∣rity; only he restricts it to the chimney Swal∣low and the common martin, but does not impute it to the sand martin, which was more natural. On the other hand, the number of naturalists who reject the opinion is fully as great <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Marsigli, Ray, Willughby, Catesby, Collinson, Wager, Ed∣wards, Reaumur, Adanson, Frisch, Tesdorf, Lottinger, Vallisnieri, the authors of the Italian Ornithology, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and their proofs seem to be much more cogent. I know that it is sometimes imprudent to judge of a particular fact by what are called the ge∣neral laws of nature; because these, being found∣ed
<PB N="471" REF="507"/>
on observation, are true only so far as they comprehend all the facts; but the submersion of Swallows appears by no means ascertained; and I shall here state my reasons.</P>
<P>Most of those who attest this marvellous tale <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schoeffer, Hevelius, Aldrovandus, Neander and Bartius, Ge∣rard, Schwenckfeld, Rzaczynski, Derham, Klein, Regnard, Ellis, Linnaeus, &amp;c. We might enlarge the list, but the number of par∣tisans in reality weakens the opinion which they maintain; since among so many observers not one can produce a single circumstan∣tial and authentic fact.</NOTE>, particularly Hevelius and Schoeffer, who were appointed by the Royal Society of London to examine and weigh the proofs, adduce nothing but vague reports <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Philosophical Transactions, No. 10, and judge if the Royal Society ever verified the fact, as asserted by the journalists of Tre∣voux, the Abbe Pluche, and some others.</NOTE>, and a suspicious tradition, to which the work of Olaus Magnus might have given origin. Even those who assert their having seen the phaenomenon, as Etmuller, Wallerius, and some others <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Chambers cites Dr. Colas, who says that he saw sixteen swal∣lows taken out of the lake Sameroth, thirty taken out of the Royal Pool at Rosineilen, and two others at Schledeiten, the moment they came out of the water: he adds that they were very wet and feeble, and that he had observed that these birds are usually very weak on their first appearance. But this is contrary to daily ob∣servation; besides Dr. Colas mentions neither the species, nor the date, nor the circumstances, &amp;c.</NOTE>, only repeat the words of the bishop of Upsal, without joining any circumstantial remarks which give proba∣bility to a relation.</P>
<P>If it were true that all the Swallows which
<PB N="472" REF="508"/>
inhabit a country plunge into the water or mud annually in October, and rise from their sub∣aqueous bed in the following April, there must have been frequent opportunities of observing them, either in the instant of their immersion, or, what is much more curious, in the moment of their emersion, or during their long repose at the bottom of the pool. These would have been notorious facts, confirmed by the united testimony of persons of all conditions, by fisher∣men, hunters, farmers, travellers, shepherds, mariners, &amp;c. No one doubts that the mar∣mots, the dormice, and the hedge-hogs, sleep benumbed during the winter in their holes; no one doubts that the bats pass that cold season in the same torpid state, clinging to the roofs of subterraneous caves, and muffled in their wings. But it is hard to believe that Swallows can live six months without breathing, and all that time under water. Their emersion has never been observed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know that Heerkens, in his poem entitled <HI>Hirundo,</HI> has de∣scribed in Latin verses this emersion; but at present we have no∣thing to do with poetical descriptions.</NOTE>, though, if it were true, it must happen frequently in the season when the pools are fished. The account is suspected even on the shores of the Baltic: Dr. Halmann, a Rus∣sian, and M. Brown, a Norwegian, who were at Florence, assured the authors of the <HI>Italian Ornithology</HI> that, in their northern climates, the Swallows appeared and retired at the same times
<PB N="473" REF="509"/>
as in Italy, and that their pretended submersion under water was a fable current only among the vulgar.</P>
<P>M. Tesdorf of Lubec, a man who joins much philosophy to extensive and various information, has written to the Count de Buffon, that, not∣withstanding forty years attention to the sub∣ject, he could never see a single Swallow drawn out of the water.</P>
<P>M. Klein, who has been at such pains in sup∣porting the opinion of immersion and emersion of Swallows, confesses that he was never for∣tunate enough to catch them in the fact <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Nivernois, Morvand, Lorraine, and many other provinces where pools abound, the people have no idea of the immersion of the Swallows.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Hermann, a learned professor of natural history at Strasburgh, and who seems even to lean to Klein's idea, owns to me in his letters, that he was never gratified with a sight of the supposed phaenomenon.</P>
<P>Two other observers of the most undoubted authority, M. Hebert and the Viscount Quer∣hoent, assure me that they knew the submer∣sion of Swallows only from hearsay, and could never verify it by their own observations.</P>
<P>Dr. Lottinger, who has much studied the economy of birds, and who does not always coincide with me in opinion, regards this sub∣mersion as an incredible paradox.</P>
<P>In Germany, a reward of an equal weight of
<PB N="474" REF="510"/>
silver was offered publicly to whoever should produce Swallows found under water; yet no person ever claimed the prize <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Many persons of learning or rank <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A Grand Marshal of Poland and an Ambassador of Sardinia had promised them to M. de Reaumur; the Governor of R. and many others had promised them to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>, who be∣lieved in this strange phaenomenon, and wished to persuade others, offered to exhibit clusters of Swallows fished up in winter, but never ful∣filled their promise.</P>
<P>Klein produces certificates; but almost all of them are signed by a single person, and refer only to one occurrence, which happened long prior, and either founded upon mere report, or seen when the observer was a child. They seem to be servilely copied from the text of Ola∣us, and want those little minute incidents which mark an original relation; and this uncertainty alone is sufficient to overturn the assertion <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The periodical publications have also recorded observations fa∣vourable to the hypothesis of Klein; but the least examination of them will convince us that they are incomplete and indecisive.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But it is not enough that we invalidate the proofs on which this paradox rests, we must shew that they are inconsistent with the known laws of animal economy. When any quadru∣ped or bird has once breathed, and the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> which in the <HI>foetus</HI> formed the communi∣cation between the two ventricles of the heart, is shut, respiration becomes ever after necessary

to the continuance of life. Swallows kept un∣der water, with all the due precautions, die in a few minutes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> the Italian Ornithology, <HI>t. III. p.</HI> 6. The authors assert positively that all the Swallows which they plunged into water, even at the time of their disappearance, expired in a few minutes; and though these recent drowned Swallows might have been reco∣vered, yet if they had lain some days, and still more, several weeks or months, they would have been totally past recovery.</NOTE>, and even when shut up in an ice-house <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This experiment was made by the Count de Buffon.</NOTE>, do not survive many days; how then could they live six months at the bot∣tom of a lake? I know that in some animals this may be possible; but shall we, as Klein has done, compare the Swallows to insects <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Caterpillars die in water after a certain time, as M. de Reau∣mur proved; and the same is probably the case with other insects that have <HI>tracheae.</HI></NOTE>, to frogs, or to fishes, which have their internal structure so different? Shall we infer that, if marmots, dormice, hedge-hogs, and bats, con∣tinue, as we have just said, torpid in winter, the Swallows will also in a similar state outlive the rigours of the seasons? But not to mention, that these quadrupeds can be supported by re∣absorption of the superabundant fat with which they are provided in the autumn, and which is wanting to the Swallows; not to mention the low temperature of their bodies, as observed by the Count de Buffon, in which respect they differ from the Swallow <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dr. Martin found the heat of birds, and particularly that of Swallows, to exceed two or three degrees that of the warmest quadrupeds. <HI>See his Essay on Thermometers.</HI></NOTE>; not to mention, that
<PB N="476" REF="512"/>
they often perish in their holes when the rigours of the season are of uncommon duration, and that the hedge-hogs are also torpid in Senegal, where the winter is hotter than our finest sum∣mers, but where the Swallows are perpetually active <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Consult <HI>Adanson's Voyage to Senegal.</HI></NOTE>: I shall only observe, that these qua∣drupeds are in air, and not under water; that they can still breathe, though numbed; and that the circulation of the blood and of other flu∣ids, though more sluggish than usual, goes on in the same manner. Nay, according to the observations of Vallisnieri, these functions are performed in frogs, which sleep through the winter in the bottom of marshes. But circula∣tion is effected by a different mechanism in am∣phibious animals from that in quadrupeds or in birds <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The circulation of the blood in quadrupeds and in birds is no∣thing but the perpetual motion of that fluid, determined by the systole (or contraction) of the heart, to pass from its right ventri∣cle, through the pulmonary artery, into the left ventricle; to pass from this ventricle, which has also its systole, through the trunk of the <HI>aorta</HI> and its branches, into all the rest of the body; to return by the branches of their veins into their common trunk, which is the <HI>vena cava;</HI> and finally into the right auricle of the heart, where it again begins to repeat its round. From this mechanism it fol∣lows that, in quadrupeds and in birds, respiration is necessary to open for the blood the passage through the breast, and consequently is necessary to circulation; whereas in the amphibious animals, as the heart has only a single ventricle, or several ventricles which, communicating with each other, perform the function of one, the lungs afford not a passage to the whole mass of blood, but only re∣ceive a quantity sufficient for their nourishment; and by consequence their motion, which is that of respiration, is much less necessary to that of circulation. This inference is confirmed by experiment: a tortoise, which had the trunk of its pulmonary artery tied, lived, and its blood continued to circulate for the space of four days, though its lungs were open and cut in several places. <HI>See</HI> Animaux de Perrault, <HI>part II. p.</HI> 196.</NOTE>.

<P>Of ten frogs, which were found beneath the ice on the second of February, I put three of the liveliest into three glass vessels full of water, where they could move freely, but not rise to the surface, though a part of this even was
<PB N="478" REF="514"/>
immediately in contact with the external air. Three others were thrown, at the same time, each into an earthen pot half-filled with water, and permitted to breathe at the surface; and the four remaining ones were placed together at the bottom of a large open empty vessel.</P>
<P>I had previously noticed their respiration, both in air and in water, and found it to be very irregular <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Frogs, tortoises, and salamanders, sometimes swell them∣selves suddenly, and remain in that state...a full quarter of an hour: sometimes they suddenly make an entire expiration, and re∣main very long in that state." <HI>Animaux de Perrault, part II. p.</HI> 272.</NOTE>. When suffered to swim about at will, they often rose to the surface, and even protruded their nostrils: I could then perceive a vibratory motion in the throat corresponding nearly to the alternate dilatation and contraction of the nostrils. As soon as they plunged again into the water, both motions suddenly ceased. If hastily forced to descend, they shewed a ma∣nifest uneasiness, and allowed a number of air∣bubbles to escape. The vessel was filled with water to the brim, and covered by a weight of twelve ounces; yet the frog, to get air, pushed off the cover. The three frogs which were kept under water constantly struggled hard to gain the surface, and they all died, the one in twenty-four hours, and the others in the course of two days <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is proper to remark that frogs are very vivacious, that they can endure a month's abstinence, and that they show motion and life several hours after their heart and bowels are detached from their body. <HI>See</HI> Collection Academique. <HI>Hist.

The same fishes, kept in air, die in this order: the bleaks in thirty-five or forty-four minutes, the <HI>bouziere</HI> in forty-four, the dog-fish in fifty or fifty-two, the bar∣bels in fifty or sixty, one of the minows in two hours and forty-eight minutes, the other in three hours, one of the gudgeons in an hour and forty-nine minutes, the other in six hours and twen∣ty-two minutes. The biggest of these fish did not measure twenty lines from the eye to the tail.</NOTE>; but those which were kept in similar bottles, and permitted to rise to the surface, lived, and retained their usual vivacity.

<P>But it will appear more extraordinary, that of two carps <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cyprinus-Carpio,</HI> Linn.</NOTE> equal in size, the one, which was kept constantly under water, lived a third shorter time than the other, which was not put into water, though in its flouncing it had fallen from a chimney-piece four feet to the ground <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The first lived eighteen hours under water, the second twenty-seven hours in the air.</NOTE>.

some twice as long as those confined under wa∣ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the two barbels that were left to die out of the water in a room without a fire, the thermometer being seven degrees above nought (about 48° of Farenheit), the one was a foot long, weighed thirty-three ounces, and lived eight hours; the other measured a little more than nine inches and a half, weighed seventeen ounces, and lived four hours and seventeen minutes: whereas the two fishes of the same species lived under water, the one only three hours and forty-six minutes, and the other but three hours and a quarter. But such was not the case with the dog-fish, for the largest, which was five inches and nine lines long, lived only three hours in the air; and the other, which was four inches nine lines, lived three hours and three quarters under water. During the course of these observations, I thought that I could perceive the agony of the fish marked by the cessation of the regular motion of the gills and by a periodical convulsion in these organs, which returned twice or thrice in a quarter of an hour: the large barbel had thirteen of these in seventy-seven minutes, and the last seemed to denote the in∣stant of its death. In one of the small ones, the final moment was marked by a convulsion of the ventral fins; but, in most of them, that, of all the external and regular motions, which lasted longest, was the motion of the lower jaw.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that, as frogs are found beneath ice, they may subsist a considerable time without air. But it is well known that, when water freezes, the air usually contained in it is disengaged, and gathers below the super∣ficial crust; so that the frogs may still inhale the vital breath.</P>

<P>An animal which has been suffocated by drowning, may frequently indeed be recovered by stimulating the lungs, and applying gentle warmth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have thought it proper to insert this sentence, and omit the long detail which M. de Montbeillard gives of his recovering, by the simple application of heat, a Swallow that had fallen into a ba∣son of water and was taken out stiff and apparently dead. The methods used in this country for the recovery of drowned persons are well known: warmth, gentle motion, and friction; the ap∣plication of stimulants to the nostrils, the inflation of the lungs, &amp;c. T.</NOTE>; but the experiment never succeeds unless the immersion is recent. And such in∣stances are not at all analogous to the supposed resuscitation of Swallows from the bottoms of lakes. Their appearance or disappearance has no relation to the quality of the season; they leave us in autumn, when the weather is ge∣nerally warmer than in spring, the period of their return. In the memorable year 1740 <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Coll. Acad. <HI>part. etran. t. XI. Acad. of Stock. p.</HI> 51.</NOTE>, the Swallows made their appearance during the severe frosts, and many perished for want of
<PB N="483" REF="519"/>
food; and in the mild, and even warm, spring of 1774, they arrived no earlier than usual.</P>
<P>The opinion that Swallows pass the winter under water seems to have originated in this way: among the number which flock together at night among the rushes and aquatic plants, on their arrival and previous to their retreat, some may have been drowned by accident <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In summer they are sometimes found drowned in the meers.</NOTE>; and the fishermen, finding them in their nets, would carry them to a stove, and thus restore them to life. And a passage in Aristotle in∣duced the learned to ascribe this submersion to those of the northern countries only <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Anim. <HI>Lib. VIII.</HI> 12 <HI>&amp;</HI> 16.</NOTE>, as if the distance of four or five hundred leagues would prove any bar to birds which can fly through the space of two hundred leagues in a day, and which, by advancing farther south, may always find a milder temperature, and a more abundant provision of their insect food. That philoso∣pher indeed believed that the Swallows and some other birds lay hid during the winter; but his assertion was too general. There are in∣stances, however, of chimney-swallows, sand∣martins, &amp;c. being seen in mild winters: two sand-martins were observed to circle about the castle of Mayac, in Perigord, the whole of the 27th of December, 1775, when there was a southerly wind, attended with light rain: I
<PB N="484" REF="520"/>
have a certificate signed by many respectable names to attest this fact. These had, no doubt, been detained by late hatching, or were young birds unable to perform the migration, but for∣tunate enough to obtain a convenient retreat, a warm season <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this year, 1775, the autumn was fine and not cold in that part of Burgundy where I live, which is two degrees more northerly than Perigueux. Of ninety-five days till the 27th of December, there were only twenty-seven in which the sun did not shine: the thermometer never sunk more than five or six degrees below nought (20°¾ or 18°½ Farenheit), and was often five or six above that point (43°¼ or 45°½ F.), even at the end of December: on the 27th, at sun-rise, it was three degrees above. (38°¾ F.)</NOTE>, and the proper food. Some such occurrences, which are probably more fre∣quent in Greece than in the north of Europe, might dispose Aristotle to think that all the spe∣cies of Swallows remained concealed and dor∣mant, during the winter months. Klein as∣serts, in fact, that the sand-martins lie torpid in their holes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To these are added, the swifts, the rails, the nightingales, the warblers; and M. Klein would wish to join many others. Were his system realized, the earth could not furnish caverns enow, nor the rocks holes. And the more general this hiding be supposed, the more would it be notorious. <HI>See</HI> Ordo Avium, <HI>passim.</HI></NOTE>; and these are often seen in the winter at Malta, and even in France. M. de Buffon conjectured that the sand-martins are less affected by cold than the other Swallows, since they haunt the brooks and rivers; and that, as they are probably of a colder temperament, and construct their holes like those animals which sleep during the winter, they also undergo the
<PB N="485" REF="521"/>
same state of inaction. Besides, they may find insects in the ground at all seasons, and can therefore subsist when other Swallows must in∣evitably perish. Instances of this kind may happen; but we must not infer that in winter they generally lodge thus concealed. Collinson directed, in England, a bank which was quite bored by these birds to be carefully dug, in the month of October 1757, and yet not one could be found.</P>
<P>If, therefore, Swallows (I might say the same of all the birds of passage) can never obtain un∣der water an asylum congruous to their nature, we must return to the most ancient opinion, and the most consonant to observation and ex∣perience. When the proper insects begin to fail, these birds remove into milder climates, which still afford that prey, so necessary to their subsistence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swammerdam.</NOTE>. This is the general and direct∣ing cause of migrations: those which live upon winged insects are the first to retire, because their provisions are soonest deficient: those which feed upon the <HI>larvae</HI> of ants and other crawling insects, find a more lasting supply, and are later in disappearing. Those birds, again, which eat berries, small seeds, and fruits that ripen in autumn, and hang on the trees the whole winter, do not arrive until autumn, and settle among us the greatest part of the winter.
<PB N="486" REF="522"/>
Those which consume the same provisions with man, and live upon his superfluities, reside con∣stantly in our vicinity. Lastly, when a new species of culture is introduced into a country, it in the end occasions new migrations. Thus after barley, rice, and wheat, were begun to be cultivated in Carolina, the colonists were sur∣prised to see, regularly every year, numerous flocks of birds arrive, with which they were totally unacquainted, and hence denominated them <HI>rice-birds, wheat-birds</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philosophical Transactions, <HI>No.</HI> 483, <HI>art.</HI> 35.</NOTE>, &amp;c. It is not unusual in the American seas to behold immense troops of birds collected to prey on those prodi∣gious swarms of winged insects which some∣times darken the air <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Second Voyage of Columbus.</NOTE>. In all cases, it would appear, that neither the climate nor the season, but the necessity of procuring subsistence <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is probable that the migrations of fishes, and even those of quadrupeds, are subject to the same law, or rather to a law still more general, which tends to the preservation of each species and of each individual: for instance, I should suppose that the flying-fish would never have employed their gills to fly, if they had not been pursued by the bonitos, the dorados, and other voracious fish; and perhaps the passage of birds of prey, which takes place in September, has some influence on the departure of the Swallows.</NOTE>, di∣rects the birds to migrate from one country to another, to traverse the ocean, or to fix their permanent residence.</P>
<P>There is another cause also, which influences the migrations of birds, or at least prompts them to return to their natal abode. Like all other
<PB N="487" REF="523"/>
sentient beings, they cherish a partial tender∣ness to the place that gave them birth; there they felt their faculties first expand; there they tasted the fresh pleasures of the morning of life: necessity compelled them to leave with regret the delicious spot; but its image still dwells in their bosom, and incessantly awakens the ardent craving to return and to renew the felicity of their infant days <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In that part of Lybia where the Nile has its source, the Swal∣lows and the kites are stationary, and remain the whole year. <HI>He∣rodolus, Lib. II.</HI> The same thing is said of some districts of Ethio∣pia. There may be migratory and stationary Swallows in the same country, as at the Cape of Good Hope.</NOTE>. But, not to enter into a general discussion on the subject, it appears that our Swallows retire in the month of October to the southern countries; since they are observed about that time to leave Europe, and in a few days are found in Africa, and have even more than once been met with in their passage on the ocean. I know, says Peter Martyr, that the Swallows, the kites, &amp;c. migrate from Europe on the approach of winter, and spend that sea∣son on the coasts of Egypt. Father Kircher, that advocate for the submersion of Swallows, but who confined it to the northern climates, affirms, from the accounts of the inhabitants of the Morea, that great numbers of Swallows pass annually with the storks, from Egypt and Lybia, into Europe <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Mundus Subterraneus</HI> of this Jesuit. These two last facts confirm my notion, that, even in warm countries, there is a season for the generation of insects, of those at least which support the Swallows.</NOTE>. Adanson tells us
<PB N="488" REF="524"/>
that the Chimney-swallows arrive at Senegal about the ninth of October, and retire again in the spring; and that, on the 6th of October, when he was fifty leagues off the coast, between the island of Goree and Senegal, there alighted on his vessel four birds, which he found to be real European Swallows; and he adds that they were fatigued, and suffered themselves to be caught. In 1765, nearly in the same season, the Company's ship, <HI>Penthievre,</HI> was over∣spread, between the coast of Africa and the Cape de Verd islands, by a flight of white rumped Swallows (martins), which probably came from Europe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by the Viscount de Querhoent.</NOTE>. Leguat, who was on the same seas on the 12th of November, also observed four Swallows which followed his vessel seven days, as far as Cape Verd. We may remark that this is precisely the time when bees swarm profusely in Senegal, and when the gnats called <HI>marin∣gouins</HI> are most troublesome: in fact, this is the end of the rainy season, when humidity and warmth at once favour the multiplication of insects, especially such as the <HI>maringouins,</HI> which hover about wet places <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Consult <HI>Voyage au Senegal,</HI> par M.

Swallows are seen the whole year at the Cape of Good Hope, says Kolben, but they are more numerous in winter; which shews that some are there permanent settlers and others migra∣tory, for it cannot well be said that they sleep under water or lurk in holes during summer. The Swallows of Canada, Father Charlevoix tells us, are birds of passage as well as those of Europe. Those of Jamaica, according to Dr. Stubbs, leave the island in the winter months,
<PB N="490" REF="526"/>
though ever so warm <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philosophical Transactions, No. 36.</NOTE>. Every body knows the singular and happy experiment of Frisch, who fastened a dyed thread to the feet of some of these birds, and saw them the following year with this thread not in the least discoloured; a sufficient proof that these individuals, at least, did not winter under water, and a strong pre∣sumption that none of the species ever do. We may expect that when Asia and certain parts of Africa are better known, we shall discover the different stations not only of the Swallows, but of most of the birds which the inhabitants of the islands in the Mediterranean perceive every year advancing or retiring. They cannot under∣take their distant voyages unless they be assisted by a favourable breeze; and when they are sur∣prised, in the middle of their course, by contrary winds, they become exhausted with fatigue, and alight on the first vessel they meet with, as se∣veral navigators have witnessed in the season of migration <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Admiral Wager thus writes Mr. Collinson: "Returning home in the spring of the year, as I came into soundings in our channel, a great flock of Swallows came and settled on all my rig∣ging; every rope was covered; they hung on one another like a swarm of bees; the decks and carving were filled with them. They seemed almost famished and spent, and were only feathers and bones; but being recruited with a night's rest, took their slight in the morning." The same thing happened to Mr. Wright, master of a ship, on his return from Philadelphia.</NOTE>. They may sometimes chance to fall into the sea and perish in the waves; and then, if seasonably fished out and properly taken care
<PB N="491" REF="527"/>
of, they may be revived. But it is evident that such accidents cannot happen in lakes or narrow seas. In most countries the Swallows are held the friends of men, and very justly, since they destroy vast numbers of pernicious insects. The goat-suckers are entitled to the same regard; but themselves and their benefits are concealed and neglected in evening shades.</P>
<P>My first idea was to separate the martins from the Swallows, and to imitate nature, which has separated them by implanting reciprocal antipa∣thies. They are never seen associated together, though the three species of Swallows join some∣times in the same flock. The martins are distin∣guished too by their shape, their habits, and their dispositions. 1. By their shape: their legs are shorter, and entirely unfit for walking or for rising on the wing from smooth ground; be∣sides, their four toes are turned forward, and each of them has only two phalanges, includ∣ing the nail. 2. By their habits: they arrive later and retire earlier, though they seem to shun more the heat; they breed in the crevices of old walls, and as high as they can get; they build no nest, but line the hole well with coarse litter, in which respect they resemble the bank∣swallows (sand-martins); when they go a-fo∣raging, they fill their craw with winged insects of all kinds, so that they need to feed their young only twice or thrice in the day. 3. By
<PB N="492" REF="528"/>
their dispositions: they are more shy and timid than the Swallows; the inflections of their voice are less varied, and their instinct seems more confined.</P>
<P>Such obvious differences, therefore, subsist∣ing between these birds, I should not hesitate to discriminate them; but there are many fo∣reign species, which it would be difficult to refer each to its proper class. It will be more prudent, then, not to attempt the division, but to arrange them as their exterior conformation most readily suggests.</P>
<P>Nor shall we distinguish the Swallows of the old and of the new world, because they ex∣actly resemble each other, and because the ocean can prove no barrier to birds that fly so swiftly, and can equally endure every cli∣mate.</P>

resort, and they greedily devoured the dried flies that hung from the old spiders webs.</P>
<P>A bird, which announces the return of the smiling season, and which is innocent and even useful, might be treated with gratitude; and by the bulk of mankind, it is venerated with a degree of affection bordering upon superstition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Swallows have been said to be under the immediate pro∣tection of the <HI>Dii Penates:</HI> When ill used, they bit the cows' udders, it was alleged, and made them lose their milk. These were useful illusions.</NOTE>. Yet is the swallow often the subject of cruel sport; and the expert marksman is eager to dis∣play his skill in shooting it on the wing: and what is singular, the firing of the piece rather attracts than scares these harmless creatures; this war is worse than ridiculous, and the vari∣ous insect tribes which prey in our gardens, in our fields, and in our forests, are thus suffered to extend their ravages <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Journal de Paris, <HI>annec</HI> 1777. It is true that they some∣times also destroy useful insects, such as bees; but they can always be prevented from building their nests near the hives.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The experiment of Frisch <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In a castle near Epinal in Lorraine, a few years ago, a ring of brass wire was fastened to the foot of one of these Swallows, which it faithfully brought back on the following season. Heerkens in his poem, <HI>Hirundo,</HI> cites another fact of this kind.</NOTE> and other similar ones, prove that swallows return to the same haunts. They build annually a new nest, and fix it, if the spot admits, above that occupied the preceding year. I have found them in the shaft of a chimney thus ranged in tires; counted
<PB N="496" REF="532"/>
four one above another, and all of equal size, plastered with mud mixed with straw and hair. There were some of two different sizes and shapes: the largest resembled a hollow half cy∣linder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch says, that the bird gives to its nest this circular or ra∣ther semicircular form, by making its foot the centre.</NOTE>, open above, and a foot in height, and attached to the sides of the chimney; the smallest were stuck in the corners of the chim∣ney, and formed only the quarter of a cylinder, or even an inverted cone. The first nest, which was the lowest, had the same texture at the bottom as at the sides; but the two upper tires were separated from the lower by their lining only, which consisted of straw, dry herbs, and feathers. Of the small nests built in the cor∣ners, I could find only two in tires, and I sup∣pose they belonged to young pairs; they were not so well compacted as the large ones.</P>
<P>In this species, as in many others, it is the male that sings the amorous ditty <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Greeks express this note by these words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the Latins by these other names, <HI>Drinsare,</HI> or <HI>Trinsare, Zinzilulare, Fritinnire, Minurisare.</HI> M. Frisch tells us, that, of all the swallows, the domestic one has a cry nearest resembling a song, though it consists only of three tones, terminated by a <HI>finale,</HI> which rises to a fourth, and it is little varied.</NOTE>: but the fe∣male is not entirely mute; in the love-season she twitters more fluently, she warmly receives his caresses, and sometimes, by her sportive frisks, she rouses and stimulates his passion. They have two hatches in the year, the first
<PB N="497" REF="533"/>
containing five eggs, the second three: these are white according to Willughby, and spotted according to Klein and Aldrovandus: what I saw were white. While the female sits, the male spends the night on the brim of the nest; he sleeps little, for his twittering is heard at the earliest dawn, and he circles till almost the close of the evening. After the young are hatched, both parents perpetually carry food, and are at great pains to keep the nest clean, till the brood learn to save them that trouble. But it is pleas∣ing to see them teaching their family to fly, encouraging them with their voice, presenting food at a little distance, and retiring as the young ones stretch forward; pressing them gently from the nest, fluttering before them, and offering, in the most expressive tone, to re∣ceive and assist them. Boerhaave tells us that a Swallow returning with provision to its nest, and, finding the house on fire, rushed through the flames to feed and protect her tender brood. How strong the attachment to their progeny!</P>
<P>It has been said that when their young had their eyes sunken or even torn out, the mo∣thers cured them by the application of the herb <HI>chelidonia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a swallow.

<P>Besides the different inflections of voice which I have already noticed, the common swallows have their cry of invitation, their cry of pleasure, their cry of fear, their cry of anger, that by which the mother warns her young of the dan∣gers which threaten, and many other expressions compounded of these; a proof of their great sus∣ceptibility of the internal sentiments.</P>
<P>Since the winged insects fly higher or lower according to the greater or less degree of heat, the Swallows sometimes, in the pursuit of their prey, skim along the surface, and gather it on the stems of herbs, on the gráss, and even on the pavement of streets. When the scarcity is great, they ravish the flies from the spider's web, and even devour the spiders themselves <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Frisch.</NOTE>.

Their stomach is found to contain fragments of flies, grasshoppers, beetles, butterflies, and even bits of gravel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon and Willughby. Many absurdities have been told of these swallow-stones and their virtues, as of eagle-stones, cock∣stones, and other bezoars, which seem ever to have been the fa∣vourite jewels of empiricism and of credulity.</NOTE>, a proof that at times they catch their prey on the ground: and in fact, though the domestic Swallows spend most of their lives in the air, they often alight on the roofs of houses, on iron bars, and even on the surface of the earth, and on trees. In our climate, they often pass the night about the end of summer perched on alders that grow on the banks of ri∣vers; and in that season numbers are caught, which are eaten in some countries <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At Valencia in Spain, at Lignitz in Silesia, &amp;c. <HI>See</HI> Wil∣lughby and Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. They prefer the lowest branches under the brinks, and well sheltered from the wind <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Note of Hebert. Lottinger assures me that they also frequent sometimes the coppices.</NOTE>; and it is re∣marked that the branches where they commonly sit during the night wither away.</P>
<P>They also assemble on a large tree previous to their retreat; the flocks then amount only to three or four hundred, for the species is far from being so numerous as the window Swallows (martins). In this country they commence their expedition about the beginning of October, and usually steal off in the night to avoid the birds of prey, which seldom fail to harass them on their
<PB N="500" REF="536"/>
route. Frisch saw them frequently set out in broad day, and Hebert, more than once, ob∣served, about the time of their retreat, parties of forty or fifty gliding aloft in the air, and re∣marked that their flight was not only much higher than ordinary, but more uniform and steady. They stretch towards the south, tak∣ing advantage, as much as possible, of favour∣able winds; and when no obstacles interfere, they usually arrive in Africa in the first week of October. If they be checked by a south-east wind, they halt, like the other birds of passage, in the islands that lie in their track. Adanson saw them arrive on the sixth of October, at half past six in the evening, on the coast of Senegal, and found them to be real European swallows; he afterwards discovered that they are never seen in those countries but in autumn and win∣ter. He tells us that they lie every night single, or two by two, in the sand by the sea shore <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This habit of lying in the sand is entirely contrary to what we see in Swallows in our climate; it must depend on some particular circumstances that escaped the observer; for animals are more ca∣pable, than usually supposed, of varying their mode of life accord∣ing to their situation.</NOTE>; and sometimes numbers lodge on the huts, perching upon the rafters. Another important observation he adds, that they never breed in Senegal <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is also said that no species of Swallow nestles in Malta.</NOTE>; and accordingly Frisch remarks that young Swallows never arrive in the spring. Hence
<PB N="501" REF="537"/>
we may infer that these birds are natives of more northern climates.</P>
<P>Though the Swallows are in general migra∣tory, even in Greece and in Asia, some will re∣main during the winter, especially in the mild climates where insects abound; for example, in the isles of Hières and on the coast of Genoa, where they spend the night in the open coun∣try on the orange shrubs, which they injure greatly. On the other hand, they are said to appear seldom in the island of Malta.</P>
<P>These birds have sometimes been employed to convey important intelligence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Pliny, <HI>Nat. Hist. Lib. X.</HI> 24.</NOTE>: for this pur∣pose, the mother is taken from her eggs and carried to the place whence the news is to be sent, and a thread is tied to the feet, with the number of knots and the colour previously con∣certed. The affectionate mother flies back to her brood, and transports the billet with incre∣dible expedition.</P>
<P>The chimney Swallow has its throat and front of an orange tint, and there are two streaks above the eye, of the same colour; all the rest of the under side of the body is whitish, with an orange cast; all the rest of the upper part of the head and body is of a brilliant bluish black, the only colour which appears when the feathers are composed, though they are cinereous at the base, and white in the middle; the quills of the
<PB N="502" REF="538"/>
wings are, according to their different positions, sometimes of a bluish black, which is lighter than the upper surface of the body, and some∣times of a greenish brown; the quills of the tail are blackish, with green reflections; the five lateral pairs marked with a white spot near the end; the bill is black without, and yellow within; the palate and the corners of the mouth are also yellow, and the legs blackish. In the males the orange tint on the throat is more vivid, and the white of the under side of the body has a slight cast of reddish.</P>
<P>The average weight of all those which I have tried is about three gros. They are apparently larger than the window Swallows (martins), and yet they are lighter.</P>
<P>Total length six inches and a half; the bill forms a curvilineal isosceles triangle, whose sides are concave, and about seven or eight lines; the tarsus five lines, without any down; the nails thin, slightly curved, and much pointed, and the hind one is the strongest; the alar ex∣tent, a foot; the tail three inches and a quar∣ter, much forked, though less so in the young birds, consisting of twelve quills, of which the outer pair exceeds the next by an inch, and the middle pair by fifteen or twenty lines, and the wings by four or five lines; it is generally longer in the male.</P>
<P>I have received, as varieties, some in which
<PB N="503" REF="539"/>
the colours were all fainter, and the tail little forked; these were probably young ones.</P>
<P>Among the accidental varieties I place the following. <HI>First,</HI> The white Swallows: there is no country in Europe where these have not been seen, from the Archipelago to Prussia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Samos, according to the ancients; in Italy, in France, in Holland, in Germany, according to the moderns.</NOTE>. Aldro∣vandus tells how to obtain them of that colour; according to him, we need only rub their egg with olive-oil. Aristotle imputes this whiteness to weakness of constitution, want of food, and the action of cold. In a subject, which I had occasion to observe, there were some shades of rufous above the eyes and under the throat, and some traces of brown on the neck and the breast, and the tail was shorter; perhaps its faint colours were owing to moulting, for though white Swallows are frequently seen be∣fore their passage, it is unusual to find such on their return <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In a hatch of five young, at the Trinitarians of la Motte, in Dauphiny, were two white Swallows which passed the whole year in the country, but returned not the following year. <HI>Note of the Marquis de Piolenc.</HI></NOTE>. Some are observed to be only partly white, as was the one mentioned by Al∣drovandus, which had its rump of that colour.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, I consider as an acciden∣tal variety, the rufous Swallow, of which the orange tint of the throat and eye-lids spreads over
<PB N="504" REF="540"/>
almost the whole of the plumage, but grows more dilute, and verges upon pink <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Count de Riolet assured me that he saw two individuals of this colour in a flock of chimney Swallows.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The chimney Swallows are scattered through the whole of the ancient continent, from Nor∣way to the Cape of Good Hope, and in the Asiatic regions, as far as India and Japan <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edwards and Kaempfer.</NOTE>.

Seven other Swallows brought from the Cape of Good Hope, by the same gentleman, were exactly similar in appearance to ours; but on a narrow inspection, it was found that the under part of the body was of a finer white, and the scalloping, which, in the ten lateral quills of the tail, divides the broad from the narrow part, was larger.</P>

<P>THE epithet <HI>rural</HI> was by the ancients justly applied to this bird, which, though much more familiar than the sand martin, is shy∣er than the domestic swallow. It delights to build its nest against the crags of precipices that overhang lakes <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This observation is M. Hebert's. These swallows are well known to nestle on rocks. <HI>See</HI> Gesner, <HI>Aves,</HI> p. 565. M. Guys, of Marseilles, has assured me of this fact; but we must abate from the exaggerated accounts of the ancients, of a very solid bank, a stadium in length, formed entirely by these nests, in the port of Heracleum in Egypt; and of another similar bank constructed also by these birds in an island sacred to lsis. <HI>See</HI> Plin. <HI>Lib. X.</HI> 33.</NOTE>; and it never breeds near our
<PB N="513" REF="550"/>
houses, if it can elsewhere find a convenient situation.</P>
<P>The nest which I observed in the month of September, and which had been broken off from a window, was composed externally of earth, particularly of the soft mould thrown up in the morning by worms in new-delved borders; the middle was strengthened by an intermixture of straw chips, and the inside was bedded with a heap of feathers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I found four or five gros of these feathers in a nest that weigh∣ted in all but thirteen ounces.</NOTE>; the dust in the bottom swarmed with hairy worms, which writhed and crawled nimbly in all directions, and were most numerous where the feathers stuck into the sides; there were also some fleas, bigger and browner than ordinary, and seven or eight bugs, creeping at large, though none of these could come from the house. The three young ones, which were able to fly, and the parents, I am confident, slept together at night. The nest resembled the quarter of a hollow hemis∣pheroid of a deep shape, its radius four inches and a half, sticking by its two lateral surfaces to the jamb and the window frame, and by its upper surface to the lintel; the entrance was near the lintel, placed vertically, very narrow and semicircular.</P>
<P>The same nests serve for several years, and probably to the same pair; but this is the case with regard to such only as are built in our
<PB N="514" REF="551"/>
windows, for I am assured that those construct∣ed against rocks are renewed annually. Some∣times five or six days are sufficient for perform∣ing the work, and sometimes ten or twelve are required; the birds carry the mortar both with their little bill and with their toes, but plaster with their bill only. It often happens that se∣veral Martins are seen labouring at the same nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have counted five standing within the same nest or clinging round it, without reckoning the comers and goers: the more nu∣merous they are, the more expeditious is the work.</NOTE>; either from their complaisance in as∣sisting each other, or because this species copu∣lating only in the nest, all the males which court the same female are eager to hasten the fabric, and obtain the expected joy. Yet some have been observed as assiduous in pulling down the structure as others were forward to rear it. Perhaps it was a discarded lover, who gratified his malice by retarding the fruition of his more fortunate rivals.</P>
<P>The Martins arrive sooner or later, according to the latitude: at Upsal on the 9th of May, as Linnaeus tells us; in France and England in the beginning of April <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>This year, 1779, the winter has been without snow, and the spring very fine; yet these swallows arrived not in Burgundy till the 9th of April, and on the lake of Geneva till the 14th.

surprised by the spring colds, and have been seen shooting through a thick fall of snow <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This proves that what Hoegstroem, the pastor of Nordland, says of the fore-knowledge of temperatures, which he ascribes to the swallows, is not more applicable to that of the window than to that of the chimney, and must be regarded as very doubtful. "In Lapland," says he, "swallows have been seen to depart, and <HI>aban∣don their young</HI> in very warm weather, and when there was no ap∣pearance of a change in the air. But this change speedily came, and one might travel in a sledge by the 8th of September. In cer∣tain years, on the contrary, they have staid very late, though the weather was not mild; whence it might be inferred that the cold was distant." In all this the reverend pastor seems to be only the echo of popular rumour, and to have taken no pains to ascertain the fact, which is besides contradicted by accurate observations.</NOTE>. On their first arrival they haunt the wet places; I never saw them return to the nests which are in my windows before the 15th of April, and sometimes not till the beginning of May. They build in all aspects, but prefer such as look into the fields, especially when the scene is inter∣spersed with rivers, brooks, or pools. They
<PB N="516" REF="553"/>
breed, at times, within houses; but this is ex∣ceedingly rare, and even very difficult to ob∣tain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It rarely builds in houses," says Aristotle, which is con∣firmed by daily observation. The late M. Rousseau, of Geneva, after infinite pains, succeeded to make them nestle in his chamber. M. Hebert saw them build on the spring of a bell; the bottom of the nest rested on this spring, the upper brim, which was semicir∣cular, leaned against the wall by its two ends, three or four inches below the eave: the cock and hen, during the time they were em∣ployed in the construction, passed the nights on the iron spike to which the spring was fastened. The frequent concussion given by this spring could not fail to disturb the action of nature in the de∣velopement of the little embryons; the hatch accordingly did not succeed: yet the pair would not forsake their tottering mansion, but continued to inhabit it the rest of the season. The semicircu∣lar form which, on this occasion, they gave their nest, proves that they can sometimes change their order of architecture.</NOTE>. The young are sometimes hatched as early as the 15th of June; the cock and hen may be seen toying with each other on the brink of the half-formed fabric, and billing with a shrill expressive chirp <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Frisch pretends that the males of this species sing better than those of the domestic swallow; but in my opinion it is quite the re∣verse.</NOTE>; but they are never observed to copulate, which makes it probable that this is done in the nest, since this chirping is heard early in the morning, and sometimes during the whole night. Their first hatch consists of five white eggs, with a dusky ring near the large end; the second hatch consists of three or four, and the third, when it does take place, of two or three. The male seldom or never removes from his mate
<PB N="517" REF="554"/>
during incubation; he watches for her safety and that of the young brood, and darts impe∣tuously on the birds that chance to approach too near. After the eggs are hatched, both pa∣rents frequently carry food, and seem to be∣stow the most affectionate care <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the young are hatched, their excrements are said to be enveloped in a sort of pellicle; which enables the parents to roll them easily out of the nest. <HI>Frisch.</HI></NOTE>. In some cases, however, this paternal attachment ap∣pears to be forgotten: a young one which was already fledged, having fallen out of the nest upon the sole of the window, the parents took no heed of it; but, finding itself thus aban∣doned, it strove to escape, flapped its wings, and, after three or four hours exertions, it launched at last into the air. I broke off, from another window, a nest containing four young ones just hatched, and set it in the sole of the window; and yet the parents passed and re∣passed incessantly and fluttered about the spot, without regarding the imploring cries of their progeny <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A whole hatch having been put in the same cage with the pa∣rents, these passed the night sometimes on the bar of the cage, sometimes on the brim of the nest, almost always the one after the other, and at last one upon the other, without bestowing the small∣est attention to their young: but it may be said, that in this case the paternal love was swallowed up by the regret for the loss of liberty.</NOTE>: a hen sparrow would, in such cir∣cumstances, have fed and tended her offspring a fortnight. It would seem, therefore, that the affection of the Martins for their young depends
<PB N="518" REF="555"/>
on the local situation; however they continue to fetch them provisions for a long time, and even after they have begun to fly; these consist in winged insects, snapped in the air, which is so peculiarly their mode of catching <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the general opinion, and the most consonant to daily observation; yet M. Guys assures me that these birds seek pine∣wood, in which they find caterpillars.</NOTE>, that if they see one sitting on a wall, they will sweep past it to start the prey.</P>
<P>It has been said that the sparrows often oc∣cupy the Martins' nests, which is true. It has been added that the Martins thus thrust out return sometimes escorted by auxiliaries, and, in an in∣stant closing up the aperture with the usual mor∣tar, take vengeance on the usurpers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Albertus first broached this error; Rzaczynski repeated it; the Jesuit Batgowski asserts his being a witness of the fact; and Lin∣naeus gives it as a truth ascertained.</NOTE>: whether this ever happened I cannot decide; but the in∣stances which have come under my observation do not countenance the opinions. The Mar∣tins returned frequently in the course of the summer, quarrelled with the sparrows, and sometimes circled about for a day or two, but never attempted to enter the nest or to shut it up. Nor can we suppose any antipathy to sub∣sist between these birds <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Albertus <HI>apud Gesnerum.</HI></NOTE>; the sparrows will lay wherever they find it convenient.</P>
<P>Though the Martins are shyer than the chim∣ney swallows, and though philosophers have
<PB N="519" REF="556"/>
believed that they were incapable of being tam∣ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Rousseau, of Geneva.</NOTE>, yet is it very easy to succeed. They must be supplied with the proper food, which consists of flies and butterflies <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Some authors pretend that they cannot exist on vegetable sub∣stances; yet we cannot suppose that these prove a poison to them: bread was part of the food of the tame swallow which I shall pre∣sently mention. But what is more singular, children have been seen to feed young swallows with dung that has dropt from the nest of another swallow of the same species. The brood lived very well for ten days on this diet, and in all probability they would have subsisted longer, had not the experiment been interrupted by a mother, who was fonder of cleanliness than of gaining knowledge.</NOTE>, and must receive it often; above all, they must be soothed into the loss of liberty, a sentiment common to all animals, but in none so lively or so acute as in the wing∣ed tribes <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>"I have often," says M. Rousseau, "had the pleasure of see∣ing them kept in my chamber while the windows were shut, and so tranquil as to chirp, frolic, and toy at their ease, waiting till I should open for them, confident that I would not delay; in fact I rose, for that purpose, every morning at four o'clock."</P>
<P>The voyager Leguat speaks of a tame swallow that he had brought from the Canaries to the island of Sal; he let it out every morning, and it faithfully returned in the evening. <HI>Voyage aux In∣des Orientales, p.</HI> 13. Leguat does not say what species it was. Other persons have raised swallows. <HI>See</HI> Volfgang Franzius, <HI>Hist. Anim. p.</HI> 456; and the <HI>Journal de Paris for</HI> 1778.</P></NOTE>. A tame Martin <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In the noble Chapter of Leigneux in Fores.</NOTE> was known to grow extremely fond of its mistress; it sat whole days upon her knees, and, when she appeared after some hours absence, it uttered joyous ac∣cents, clapped its wings, and shewed every sign of lively feeling: it began to feed out of the hand, and its education would probably have com∣pletely
<PB N="520" REF="557"/>
succeeded, had it not escaped. It did not fly far; it alighted on a young child, and soon fell a prey to a cat. The Viscount Quer∣hoent assures me, that he also trained, for se∣veral months, some young Martins taken out of the nest; but he could never bring them to eat by themselves, and that they always died when he gave over feeding them. When the one I have just mentioned attempted to walk, it moved ungracefully, on account of its short legs; and, for this reason, the Martins seldom alight but upon their nests, and only in cases where necessity obliges them: for instance, when they gather mud for building with, or when they spend the night among the reeds to∣wards the end of summer, at which time they are become so numerous as not to be all con∣tained in their former lodgments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About the end of summer, they are observed in the evenings circling in great numbers on the surface of water, almost till dark: it is probably in order to repair to such situations that every day they assemble an hour or two before sun-set. Add, that they are much less frequent in towns about the evening than during the course of the day.</NOTE>; or, lastly, when they assemble upon the ridges and corners of houses previous to their migration. Hebert had a house in Brie, which was every year their general rendezvous; the number congregated was great, not only on account of their own multiplication, but because many others of their kindred species, the sand-martins and chim∣ney
<PB N="521" REF="558"/>
swallows, joined them: they had a peculiar cry, which seemed to call them together. It was remarked that shortly before: they began their voyage they exercised themselves in soar∣ing to the clouds, thus preparing to wing their course through the lofty regions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Lottinger.</NOTE>; a fact which agrees with other observations related in the preceding article, and which explains why the swallows are so seldom seen in the air dur∣ing their passage from one country to another.</P>
<P>The Martins are widely diffused through the ancient continent; yet Aldrovandus asserts that they are never seen in Italy, particularly in the neighborhood of Bologna. M. Hermann <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This professor assures me that the White-rumps or Martins grow fat in autumn, and are then very good to eat. Franzius says nearly as much: yet I publish it with regret, as it tends to the de∣struction of an useful species.</NOTE> tells me, that in Alsace they are caught with the stares, by spreading a net about the close of the evening over a marsh full of rushes, and by drowning next morning the birds that are en∣tangled under it. Some of these drowned Mar∣tins may be restored to life, and a simple fact of that kind might have given rise to the fable of their annual immersion and emersion.</P>
<P>This species appears to hold a middle rank between the chimney swallow and the black Martin. It has little of the chirping and fami∣liarity of the former; but it builds its nest si∣milarly,
<PB N="522" REF="559"/>
and its toes consist of the same num∣ber of <HI>phalanges.</HI> It has the rough feet of the black Martin, and its hind toe also turns for∣ward; like that bird, too, it flies through heavy rains, and then in larger flocks than usual; it clings also to the walls, and seldom alights on the ground, and, when it does so, it rather creeps than walks. Its bill is wider than that of the chimney-swallow, at least apparently so, because the mandibles open suddenly as high as the ears, and the edges form on each side a pro∣jection: lastly, though it is somewhat larger, it seems rather smaller, its feathers, and espe∣cially the inferior coverts of its tail, being not so fully webbed. The average weight of all that I have weighed was constantly from three to four gros.</P>
<P>The rump, the throat, and all the under sur∣face of the body, are of a fine white; the side of the coverts of the tail is brown; the upper surface of the head and neck, the back, those of the feathers and of the primary coverts of the tail, are of a glossy black, with blue reflections; the feathers of the head and back cinereous at the base, white in the middle; the quills of the wings brown, with greenish reflections on the borders; the three last of those next the body are terminated with white; the legs clothed as far as the nails with a white down; the bill black, and the legs brown gray; the black of the female is less distinct, and its white not so
<PB N="523" REF="560"/>
pure, even variegated with brown on the rump. In the young ones the head is brown, and there is a shade of the same colour under the neck: the reflections from the upper surface of the body are of a lighter blue, which has a greenish cast in certain positions, and, what is remark∣able, the quills of the wings are of a deeper tint. They frequently wag their tail upwards and downwards, and the origin of the neck is bare.</P>
<P>Total length five inches and a half; the bill six lines; the inside pale red at the bottom, blackish near the point; the nostrils round and open; the tongue forked, a little blackish near the end; the tarsus five lines and a half, covered with down rather on the sides than before or behind; the middle toe six lines and a half; the alar ex∣tent ten inches and a half; the tail two inches, forked as far as six, seven, or even nine lines; in some subjects this forking reaches only five lines, but in others it does not occur at all.</P>
<P>The intestinal tube six or seven inches; the <HI>caeca</HI> very small, and filled with a matter dif∣ferent from that contained in the true intestines; it has a gall bladder; the gizzard is muscular; the <HI>aesophagus</HI> twenty lines, it dilates into a lit∣tle glandular bag before its insertion; the testi∣cles are of an oval shape, and unequal; the greater diameter of the biggest ones four or five lines, the smaller diameter three; their surface was marked with many circumvolutions, like
<PB N="524" REF="561"/>
a small vessel twisted and rolled in all direc∣tions.</P>
<P>What is singular, the young Martins are heavier than the adults: five that were taken from the nest while they were scarcely covered with down, weighed together three ounces, which give three hundred and forty-five grains to each; whereas both the parents weighed ex∣actly an ounce, or each was two hundred and eighty-eight grains. The gizzards of the young birds were distended with food, and weighed in all one hundred and eighty grains, which was equal to thirty-six each; but both the gizzards of the parents, which contained hardly any thing, weighed only eighteen, or they were four times lighter than those of their brood. This fact clearly proves that the parents neglect their requisite subsistence in order to supply their young, and that, during infancy, the organs concerned in nourishment predominate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have observed the same disproportion both in the gizzards and in the intestines of young sparrows, nightingales, fauvettes, &amp;c.</NOTE>, as in the adult period those subservient to generation.</P>
<P>Some individuals of this species have their whole plumage white; and of this I can produce two respectable vouchers, Hebert and Hermann. The white Martin of the last had red eyes, as is the case with so many animals whose hair or feathers are white; its legs were not covered with down, like the rest of the same hatch.</P>
<P>We may regard the fulvous bellied swallow
<PB N="525" REF="562"/>
of Barrere as a variety of this species; and the whitish breasted brown sparrow of Brown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This author calls it a <HI>house-swallow,</HI> but it is more analogous to the white-rumped swallow.</NOTE>, as occasioned by the influence of climate. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Martin, <HI>Hirundo Urbica:</HI> "Its tail∣quills are not spotted, its back is bluish black, and the whole of its under side is white." The reader will find an excellent account of this bird by Mr. White in the Philosophical Transactions for 1774, or in his Natural History of Selborne, pp. 157, 162. We shall extract the following passage, as it further confirms the migration of the swallows.</P>
<P>"As the summer declines, the congregating flocks increase in numbers daily by the constant accessions of the second broods; till at last they swarm in myriads upon myriads round the villages on the Thames, darkening the face of the sky as they frequent the aits of that river, where they roost. They retire, the bulk of them I mean, in vast flocks together about the beginning of October; but have appeared of late years in a considerable flight in this neighbourhood, for one day or two, as late as November the 3d and 6th, after they were supposed to have been gone for more than a fortnight. They therefore withdraw with us the latest of any spe∣cies. Unless these birds are very short lived indeed, or unless they do not return to the district where they have been bred, they must undergo vast devastations somehow and somewhere; for the bird, that return yearly bear no manner of proportion to the birds that retire."</P></NOTE></P>

<P>WE have seen that the two preceding spe∣cies bestow much industry and labour in constructing their little mansion; the two following species, we shall find, breed in holes in the ground, in walls or in trees, and are at little pains to form these, strewing coarsely some litter.</P>
<P>The Sand-martins arrive in our climates, and retire, nearly at the same time with the common martins. Towards the end of August they gra∣dually come nearer those spots where they as∣semble, and about the end of September He∣bert tells us that he saw a great number of both species collected together on the house which
<PB N="527" REF="564"/>
he possessed in Brie <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This house was situated in the skirt of a small town, its princi∣pal aspect was towards a river, and it communicated with the coun∣try on several sides.</NOTE>, and particularly on the side of the roof that faced the south; and when the flock was formed, it entirely covered the building. But all the Sand-martins do not migrate. The commander Desmazys writes me that they are always to be found in Malta during the winter, and especially when the weather is inclement <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"In St. Domingo," says the Chevalier Lefebvre Deshayes, "the swallows are seen to arrive on the approach of a storm; if the clouds disperse, they also retire, and probably follow the shower." They are, in fact, very common in that island during the rainy sea∣son. Aristotle asserted, two thousand years ago, that the shore-swallow appeared not in Greece but when it rained. Lastly, on all seas birds of every kind repair in storms to the islands, and some-times seek shelter aboard vessels, and their appearance is almost always the portent of some furious gust.</NOTE>: and, as that small rocky island has no lake or pool, we cannot suppose that in the interval of storms they plunge under water. Hebert has seen them as often as fifteen or sixteen times in the mountains of Bugey <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">According to the same observer, it is much more unusual to see them during winter in the plains. These birds seem to be the spe∣cies to which Aristotle alludes when he says, "Many swallows are seen in the narrow passes of mountains." <HI>Lib.

verdure, its violets flowered in February, and, in that lovely recess, winter wore the smiles of spring. There these swallows might play, and circle, and catch their insect food; and if the cold becomes excessively severe, they could retire into their holes, where the frost can never penetrate, and where they may find earth-insects and cry∣salids to support them during their short con∣finement; or perhaps they pass into a torpid state, to which Gmelin and many others assert they are liable, though that they are not always so is proved by the experiments of Collinson <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein. <HI>Ordo Avium, p.</HI> 202, 204.

Salerne tells us that on the sides of the Loire they breed in the quarries, others say in grottos; and both accounts may in part be true. The nest is only a heap of straw and dry grass, lined with feathers, on which the eggs are dropt <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld says that this nest is of a spherical form; but this seems to be true rather of the holes than of the nest built in them. "They make no nests," says Pliny. Aldrovandus is of the same opinion: Edwards says, that those which Collinson caused to be dug out were complete, but he does not specify their form. Lastly, Belon doubts whether they excavate the holes themselves.</NOTE>. Sometimes they make their own holes, and at other times they take possession of those of the bee-eaters and king-fishers; the entrance of the cavity is eighteen inches in length. It has been alleged, that they can foresee inunda∣tions, and make a timely escape <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Plin. <HI>Lib. X.</HI> 33.</NOTE>: but the fact is, that they always dig their hole a little above the highest mark of the stream.</P>
<P>The Sand-martins only hatch once a year,
<PB N="530" REF="567"/>
according to Frisch; they lay five or six eggs, semi transparent and without spots, says Klein; the young ones grow very fat, and may be com∣pared for delicacy to the ortolans. The rea∣son is, because they are able to procure a rich supply of food, since, besides the numerous tribe of winged insects, they find reptiles and chry∣salids in the ground. In some countries, as in Valencia in Spain, there is a great consumption of Sand-martins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Willughby. The young birds are however subject to wood∣lice, which insinuate under the skin, but never to bugs.</NOTE>; which would induce me, notwithstanding the assertion of Frisch, to sup∣pose that in those parts they hatch oftener than once a year.</P>
<P>The adults hunt their prey on the surface of the water with such activity that we might imagine them to be fighting; they often run upon each other in the pursuit of the same flies, and struggle with shrill cries <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE> to obtain the plunder: but this conduct arises entirely from emulation.</P>
<P>Were we to judge from its manner of breed∣ing, we should conclude, that this bird is the wildest of the European swallows; yet is it tamer than the black martin, which lives indeed in towns, but never mingles with any kindred species, whereas the Sand-martin associates with the common martin, and even the chimney swallow: this happens particularly about the time of migration, when the utility of uniting is most sensibly felt. It differs from these two
<PB N="531" REF="568"/>
species in its plumage, in its voice, and, as we have already seen, in some of its natural habits. It never perches, and it arrives much earlier in the spring than the black martin. I know not on what ground Gesner pretends that it clings and hangs by the feet when it sleeps.</P>

<P>THESE Swallows constantly nestle in the rocks, and never descend into the plains, but in pursuit of their prey. It commonly rains in a day or two after their appearance; because, no doubt, the state of the air then drives the insects from the mountains. The Crag-swal∣lows associate with the common martins, but are not so numerous. Both species are often seen in the morning, wheeling about the castle of Epine in Savoy; the Crag-swallows appear the first, and are also the first to retire to the heights; after half past nine o'clock none is found in the vale.</P>
<P>The Crag-swallow arrives in Savoy about the middle of April, and departs by the fifteenth of August; but some loiter till the tenth of Oc∣tober. The same may be said of those which inhabit the mountains of Auvergne and of Dauphiny.</P>
<P>This species seems to be intermediate to the common martin, whose cry and gestures it has, and the sand-martin, which it resembles in its

colours: all the feathers on the upper surface of the head and body, the quills and coverts of the tail, the quills and superior coverts of the wings, are of a dun gray, edged with rufous; the mid∣dle pair of the tail is lighter; the four lateral pairs, included between this middle and the outermost one, are marked on the inside with a white spot, which is not visible unless the tail be spread; the under surface of the body is rufous; the flanks rufous, tinged with brown; the inferior coverts of the wings brown; the legs clothed with a gray down, variegated with brown; the bill and nails black.</P>

<P>THE Swifts are real swallows, and possess the characteristic qualities even in a higher degree: their neck, their bill, and their legs are shorter; their head and throat larger; their wings longer; their flight more lofty and rapid <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aristotle says, that the Swifts may be distinguished from the swallows by their rough feet: he was therefore unacquainted with the singular disposition of their feet and toes, and with their habits and economy, still more singular.</NOTE>. They are continually on the wing, and when they happen to fall by accident, they can hardly rise if the ground be flat; they must clamber up some clod or stone, that they may have room to wield their long pinions <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A fowler assured me that they sometimes alight on heaps of horse-dung, where they find insects, and can easily take wing.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="535" REF="572"/>
commence their motion. This is owing to their structure; for the tarsus is so short, that they sit almost on their belly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, and totter from side to side <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Two of these birds observed by M. Hebert, when set on a table or on the pavement, had only this motion: their feathers swelled if a person approached his hand; a young one found at the foot of a wall in which was the nest, had already this habit of bristling up its feathers, which were not yet half grown. I have lately seen two that took their flight, the one from the pavement, and the other from a gravel walk: they did not walk at all, and never changed their place but by flapping their wings.</NOTE>. The Swifts have only two modes of life, that of violent exertion, or that of per∣fect inaction; they must either shoot through the air, or remain squat in their holes. The only intermediate state which they know, is that of clambering up walls and trunks of trees quite near their lodgment, and, by means of their bill, dragging themselves into the cavity. Commonly they enter it full speed, after having passed it and repassed it above an hundred times; they dart in in an instant, and with such celerity that we totally lose sight of them.</P>
<P>These birds are very social with each other, but never mingle with the other kinds of swal∣lows; and we shall find, in the sequel, that their dispositions and instincts are different. It has been said that they have little sagacity; yet they can breed in our houses without depending on our indulgence, and without regarding our controul. Their lodgment is a hole in the wall,
<PB N="536" REF="573"/>
which widens into a larger cavity, and is pre∣ferred in proportion to its height from the ground, as affording the safest retreat. They nestle even in belfries and the tallest towers, sometimes under the arches of bridges, where, though the elevation is not so great, they are better concealed. Sometimes they settle in hol∣low trees, or in steep banks beside the king∣fishers, the bee-eaters, and sand-martins. After they have once occupied a hole, they return every year to it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know a church-porch and a belfry of which the Swifts have kept possession for time immemorial; M. Hebert, to whom I owe many good observations on this species, sees from his windows a hole of the wall above a high cope, to which they have regularly returned for thirteen years: the parents seem to transmit their man∣sion to their offspring.</NOTE>, and easily distinguish it, though hardly perceptible. It is suspected, with much probability, that they sometimes take pos∣session of the sparrows' nests, and when, on their return, they find the property reclaimed, they, with little ceremony, expel the owners.</P>
<P>The Swifts are, of all the birds of passage, those which arrive the latest in our climates and retire the earliest: in general they begin to ap∣pear about the end of April, or the beginning of May, and they leave us before the end of July <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am assured, that on the lake of Geneva they arrive not till May, and retire about the end of July or the beginning of Au∣gust; and when the weather is fine and warm, as early as the fif∣teenth of July.</NOTE>. Their progress is more regular than
<PB N="537" REF="574"/>
that of the other swallows, and appears to be more affected by the variations of temperature. They are sometimes seen in Burgundy as early as the twentieth of April, but these flocks push farther; the settlers seldom return to occupy their nest before the first days of May <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year, 1779, though the spring was uncommonly fine, they appeared not in the district where I live till the first of May, and returned before the ninth to the holes from which I had caused their nests to be taken. At Dijon, they were seen on the nineteenth of April, but those <HI>domiciliated</HI> did not take possession of their holes till between the first and fourth of May.</NOTE>. They are noisy on their appearance; rarely do two enter at once the same hole, and never without fluttering much about its mouth; still more uncommon it is for a third to follow them, nor does it ever settle.</P>
<P>I have in different times, and in different places, opened ten or twelve swifts' nests: in all of them I found the same materials, and these consisting of a great variety of substances; stalks of corn, dry grass, moss, hemp, bits of cord, threads of silk and linen, the tip of an ermine's tail, small shreds of gauze, of muslin, and other light stuffs, the feathers of domestic birds, those of the partridge, and of the parrot, charcoal, in short, whatever they can find in the sweepings of towns. But how can birds which never alight on the ground gather these materials? A celebrated observer supposes that they raise
<PB N="538" REF="575"/>
them by glancing along the surface of the ground, as they drink by skimming close on the water. Frisch imagines that they catch the substances in the air as they are carried up by the wind. But it is evident that little could be collected in the latter way, and, if the former were true, it would not fail to have been observed in towns. I am inclined to think the account more proba∣ble which several plain people have told me; that they have often seen the Swifts coming out of swallows or sparrows' nests, and carrying ma∣terials in their claws. This observation is cor∣roborated by several circumstances; first, the Swifts' nests consist of nearly the same substances with those of sparrows; secondly, we know that the Swifts enter sometimes into the nests of small birds to suck their eggs, which we may suppose they do for the sake of pillaging the materials. With regard to the moss which they employ, it is in very small quantity, and they may gather it with their little claws, which are very strong, from trees, on which they can clamber, and sometimes even they breed in their hollow trunks.</P>
<P>Of seven nests found under the head of a church porch fifteen feet from the ground, there were only three which had a regular cup-shape, and of which the materials were more or less interwoven, and with greater order than usual in sparrows' nests; they had also more moss,
<PB N="539" REF="576"/>
and fewer feathers, and were in general less bulky <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The best formed of all weighed two ounces and one gros and a half, the seven together thirteen ounces and a half, and the largest five or six times more than the smallest: some of them had a coat of dung, which could scarcely be otherwise, considering the situ∣ation of these nests, in holes of various depths.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after the Swifts have taken possession of the nests, some plaintive cries issue continually from it for several days, and sometimes during the night; at certain times, two voices may be distinguished. Is it the expression of pleasure common both to the male and female? or is it the love song by which the female invites the male to accomplish the views of nature? The latter seems to be the most probable conjecture, especially as the ardent cry of the male, when he pursues the female through the air, is softer and less drawling. We are uncertain whether the female admits one or several males: we often see three or four Swifts fluttering about the hole, and even stretching out their claws to clamber on the wall; but these may be such as were hatched the preceding year, which still remem∣ber the place of their nativity. It is the more difficult to answer these questions, since the fe∣males have nearly the same plumage with the males, and since we can seldom have an op∣portunity of viewing their manoeuvres.</P>
<P>These birds, during their short stay in our climates, have time only to make a single hatch;
<PB N="540" REF="577"/>
this consists of five white eggs, pointed, and of a spindle shape: I have seen some not yet hatch∣ed on the twenty-eighth of May. When the young ones have pierced through the shell, very different from those of the other swallows, they are almost silent, and crave no food: happily the parents obey the voice of nature, and supply them with what is proper. They carry provi∣sion only twice or thrice a-day; but each time that they return to the nest they bring ample store, their wide throat being filled with flies, butterflies, and beetles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only Swift that M. Hebert could kill, had a quantity of winged insects in its throat. This bird catches these, according to Frisch, by darting impetuously above them, with its bill wide stretched.</NOTE>. They also eat spiders which they find near their holes; yet their bill is so weak that it cannot even bruise or hold that feeble prey.</P>
<P>About the middle of June the young Swifts begin to fly, and shortly abandon their nests, after which the parents seem no more to regard them. At every period of their lives they are subject to vermin, but which appear little to in∣commode them.</P>
<P>This bird, like all the rest of the kind, is excellent for the table when fat; the young ones, especially those taken out of the nest, are reckoned, in Savoy and Piedmont, delicate morsels. The adults are difficult to shoot, be∣cause they fly both high and rapidly; but as,
<PB N="541" REF="578"/>
on account of this very rapidity, they cannot readily alter their course, they may, from this circumstance, be hit not only by a fowling∣piece, but also by the stroke of a switch. The only attention required, is to place one's self in their way by mounting to a belfry, a bastion, &amp;c. and to meet them with the blow as they dart directly on, or as they come out of their hole <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many are killed in this way in the little town which I inhabit, especially those which breed under the church-porch that I have mentioned.</NOTE>. In the island of Zant the boys catch them with a hook and line; they place them∣selves in the windows of some high tower, and use a feather for bait, which these birds try to snatch and carry to their nest <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Perhaps also they mistake the feather for an insect; they have an acute sight, but the rapidity of their motion must render objects less distinguishable.</NOTE>. A single per∣son can catch in this way five or six dozen in a day <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. Many of them appear at the sea-ports, and, as a person can there more easily choose his station, he is sure of killing some.</P>
<P>The Swifts avoid heat, and, for this reason, they pass the middle of the day in their nests in the crevices of walls or rocks and in the lowest row of tiles of tall buildings. In the morning and evening they go in quest of provision, or flutter without any particular object, but for exercise. They return at ten o'clock in the forenoon when the sun shines, and again at half
<PB N="542" REF="579"/>
an hour after it sets in the evening. They rove in numerous flocks, describing an endless series of circles upon circles, sometimes in close ranks pursuing the direction of a street, and sometimes whirling round a large edifice all screaming to∣gether, and with their whole might; often they glide along without stirring their wings, and, on a sudden, they flap with frequent and hasty strokes. We behold their motions, but we cannot judge of their intentions.</P>
<P>A commotion may be perceived among these birds as early as the first of July, which an∣nounces their departure; their numbers increase considerably, and, in the sultry evenings be∣tween the tenth and twentieth, their large as∣semblies are held. At Dijon, they constantly gather round the same belfries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those of St. Philibert and of St. Benigne.</NOTE>; and, though these meetings are numerous, the Swifts appear as frequent as usual about the other edifices: they are probably foreign birds, therefore on their passage to more southern climates. After sun-set they divide into small bodies, soar into the air with loud screams, and fly quite differ∣ently from ordinary. They may be heard long after they are gone out of sight, and they seem to bend their course to the country; they no doubt retire at night to the woods, for there it is known they breed and catch insects, and that those which haunt the plains during the day,
<PB N="543" REF="580"/>
and even some of those which live in towns, repair to the trees in the evening, where they continue till dark. The city Swifts assemble soon after, and all prepare to migrate into colder countries. M. Hebert scarce ever saw them later than the 27th of July; he supposes that they travel during the night, and proceed to no great distance, and cross not the sea. In∣deed their aversion to heat is such that they would shun the scorching air of Senegal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What Aristotle says of his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which lived in Greece the whole year, would imply that it does not so much dread heat. But may not the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> be our sand-martin?</NOTE>. Many naturalists <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Klein, Heerkens, Herman, &amp;c.</NOTE> pretend that they lie torpid in their holes during winter, and even before the end of the dog-days. But, in our climates, they are undoubtedly migratory, and in the nests which I searched, about the middle of April, twelve or fifteen days before their first appearance, I could not find a single bird.</P>
<P>Besides the regular periodical migrations, we sometimes see in autumn numerous flocks, which have by some accidents been separated from the main body. Such was the one that appeared to Hebert suddenly in Brie about the beginning of November: it circled long round a poplar, and then began to scatter, rose to a great height, and vanished with the close of the day. Hebert saw another flock about the end of September in the vicinity of Nantua, where
<PB N="544" REF="581"/>
they are not common. In both these stray∣flocks there were many birds that had a cry dif∣ferent from that usual to the Swifts; whether that their voice alters in winter, that they were young ones, or that they belong to a different branch of the same family.</P>
<P>In general, the Swift has no warble, but only a shrill whistle, which varies little in its inflections, and which is scarce ever heard ex∣cept when on the wing. In its hole it remains still and silent, afraid, it would seem, of disclos∣ing its retreat: love alone rouses it from le∣thargy. At other times it is very unlike those prattlers described by the poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Nigra velut magnas domini cum divitis aedes</L>
<L>"Pervolat, et pennis alta atria lustrat hirundo,</L>
<L>"Pabula parva legens, nidisque loquacibus escas.</L>

<P>Virg. <HI>Aeneid. XII.</HI> 473.</P>
<P>Virgil seems to refer, in this passage, to the house-swallow.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Birds which shoot through the air with such rapidity must have a quick eye, and, in the present case, the fact corroborates the general principle advanced in the "Discourse on the Nature of Birds." But every thing has its li∣mits, and I cannot believe that they will descry a fly at the distance of half a quarter of a league, as Belon asserts; that is, at twenty-eight thou∣sand times the fly's diameter, supposing that nine lines, or nine times farther than a man could see. The Swifts are not only spread through
<PB N="545" REF="582"/>
all Europe; the Viscount Querhoent saw them at the Cape of Good Hope, and I doubt not that they may be found also in Asia, and even in the new continent.</P>
<P>A moment's reflection will exhibit the sin∣gularity of this bird: its life is divided between the extremes of motion and rest; it never re∣ceives the impressions of touch, but during its short stay in its hole; its joys are either exqui∣site or totally suspended, nor can it have any idea of that languor which other beings feel from the dull continuance of even pleasurable sensations; and, lastly, its character is a com∣pound of temerity and suspicion. It creeps by stealth into its hole like a reptile, and observes profound silence; but when it circles in its pro∣per element, it feels its superiority, and, trust∣ing to its powers, it overlooks or despises danger.</P>
<P>The Swift is larger than our other swallows, and weighs ten or twelve gros; the eye is hol∣low, the throat ash-white, the rest of the plum∣age blackish, with green reflections; the back and the inferior coverts of the tail are of a deeper cast; these coverts reach to the end of the two middle quills; the bill is black; the legs of a brown flesh colour; the fore part and the inside of the <HI>tarsus</HI> are covered with small blackish feathers.</P>
<P>Total length seven inches and three quarters; the bill eight or nine lines; the tongue three
<PB N="546" REF="583"/>
lines and a half, forked; the nostrils like a long shaped human ear, the convexity being turned inwards, and their axis being inclined to the ridge of the upper; the two eye-lids naked, moveable, and shut near the middle of the ball of the eye; the tarsus is near five lines, the four toes turned forward <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How can the genus in which it is ranged be described to have three toes before and one behind?</NOTE>, and consisting each of two <HI>phalanges</HI> only (a singular conformation, peculiar to the Swifts); the alar extent about fourteen inches; the tail near three inches, composed of twelve unequal quills <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I know that Willughby reckons only ten; but perhaps he confounded this species with the following.</NOTE>, and fork∣ed more than an inch; it is exceeded eight or ten lines by the wings, which contain eighteen quills, that when closed resemble the blade of a scythe.</P>
<P><HI>Oesophagus</HI> two inches and a half, and forms near its bottom a small glandulous bag; the gizzard is muscular in its circumference, lined with a wrinkled loose membrane, and contains portions of insects, but no pebbles; it has a gall bladder, no <HI>caecum;</HI> the intestinal tube from the gizzard to the anus seven inches and a half; the <HI>ovarium</HI> clustered with eggs of unequal sizes (this was on the 20th of May).</P>
<P>Having lately compared several Swifts of both sexes, I found that the males weighed more than the females, that their feet were stronger,
<PB N="547" REF="584"/>
that the white spot on the throat is broader, and that almost all the white feathers which form it have black shafts.</P>
<P>The insect which infests these birds is a kind of louse, of an oblong shape, and orange colour, but of different tints; having two thread-like <HI>antennae,</HI> its head flat and almost triangular, and its body consisting of nine rings, beset with a few straggling hairs.</P>
<P>It is somewhat remarkable that during their stay with us their plumage loses its black gloss, and bleaches by continual exposure to the sun and the air. They arrive about the end of April, and retire before the end of August. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Swift, <HI>Hirundo-Apus:</HI> "It is blackish, its throat white, all its four toes placed before." Mr. White avers from many years' observation, that the Swifts even copulate on the wing. In England they fly each day, in mid sum∣mer, at least sixteen hours. Nor do they seem to be at all incom∣moded by the heat of our meridian fun; nay, they are never so lively as in sultry thundery weather: so different is our climate to that of the south of France, where they are confined to their holes for some hours at noon.</NOTE></P>

The <HI>Greatest Martin</HI> or <HI>Swift,</HI> Edw.</HEAD>
<P>I FIND, in this bird, both the general qua∣lities of the swallow, and the peculiar cha∣racters of the Swift. Its legs are extremely short; its four toes are turned forward, and consist only of two <HI>phalanges;</HI> it never alights on the ground, and never perches on trees:—in these properties it agrees with the Swift: but there are considerable disparities that sepa∣rate it; for, besides the differences in the plum∣age, it is twice as large, its wings are longer, and there are only ten quills in the tail.</P>
<P>These birds delight in mountains, and breed in the holes of crags. They appear annually among the cliffs which border the Rhone in Savoy, in those of the island of Malta, in the Swiss Alps, &amp;c. The one described by Ed∣wards was killed on the rocks of Gibraltar; but it is uncertain whether it resides there, or was only on its passage. And though it were a settler, this would not be a sufficient reason to call it <HI>Spanish Swallow,</HI> as Brisson has done: for, 1. it is found in many other countries, and probably
<PB N="549" REF="586"/>
in all those which abound with mountains and rocks. 2. It is rather a Swift than a swallow. One was killed, in 1775, in our districts on a pool, at the foot of a high mountain.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Piolenc (to whom I am in∣debted for my acquaintance with these birds, and who has sent me several) writes me that they arrive in Savoy about the beginning of April, and that they fly at first over the pools and marshes, and in a fortnight or three weeks they reach the high mountains; that they do not fly so lofty as the common Swifts, and that the time when they retire is not so precise or fixed as that of their appearance, and depends much on the state of the weather, and on the warmth or chillness of the air <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the country of Geneva they remain a shorter time than the Swift or black Martin.</NOTE>: lastly, he subjoins that they live on beetles, spiders, &amp;c. that they are difficult to shoot, that the flesh of the old ones is unpleasant <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sportsmen usually say that these birds are hard both to kill and to eat.</NOTE>, and that the species is not numerous.</P>
<P>It is probable that these White-bellied Swifts breed also among the steep rocks on the sea-side, and that we may apply to them, as well as to the common Swifts, what Pliny says of certain birds without feet that fly in the open sea at all dis∣tances from the shore, circling round the ves∣sels. Their cry is nearly the same with that of the common Swift.</P>
<P><PB N="550" REF="587"/>
The whole of the upper surface is brown∣gray, but deeper on the tail and wings, with reddish and greenish reflections; the throat, the breast, and the belly, white; on the neck there is a brown-gray collar, variegated with black∣ish; the sides are variegated also with blackish and with white; the lower belly and the infe∣rior coverts of the tail are of the same brown with the back; the bill black; the legs flesh coloured, covered with down before and on the inside; the ground of the feathers brown be∣neath the body, and light gray above; almost all the white feathers have a black shaft, and the brown ones are edged delicately with whitish at the tip. In one male which I observed, the feathers on the head were deeper coloured than in two others with which I compared it: it weighed two ounces five gros.</P>
<P>Total length eight inches; the bill an inch, slightly hooked; the tongue four lines, of a tri∣angular shape; the iris brown; the eye-lids naked; the tarsus five lines and a half; the nails strong, the inner one the shortest; the alar ex∣tent above twenty inches; the wings composed of eighteen quills; the tail three inches and a half, consisting of ten unequal quills, forked eight or nine lines, and exceeded by the lines two inches at least.</P>
<P>The gizzard slightly muscular, very thick, lined with a loose membrane, containing frag∣ments of insects, and some whole ones, and
<PB N="551" REF="588"/>
among others was one whose skinny wings reached more than two inches; the intestinal tube nine or ten inches; the <HI>aesophagus</HI> dilating below into a glandulous bag; no <HI>caecum,</HI> nor could I perceive any gall bladder; the testicles very long and small (this was on the 18th of June). It appeared to me that the mesentery was strong∣er, the skin thicker, the muscles more elastic, and the brain firmer, than in other birds: every thing denoted strength, and indeed the swiftness of its motion necessarily implies that.</P>
<P>We may remark that the subject described by Edwards was smaller than ours. He asserts that it resembles the sand-martin so exactly that the same description will serve both. It is true that their plumage is nearly alike, and that all the swallow tribe are similar; but that naturalist should have noticed that the toes are differently disposed. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the White-bellied Swift, <HI>Hirundo-Mel∣ba:</HI> "It is brown; its throat and belly white; all its toes placed before."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>FOREIGN BIRDS, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE SWALLOWS, THE MARTINS, AND THE SWIFTS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Swallows of the two con∣tinents form only one tribe, and are ana∣logous in their shape and principal properties <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps we should except the bill, which is stronger in some American Swallows.</NOTE>, they have not all the same instincts and natural habits. In Europe, and on the nearest borders of Africa and of Asia, they are almost wholly birds of passage. At the Cape of Good Hope a part only migrate, and the rest are stationary. In Guiana, where the temperature is pretty uni∣form, they remain the whole year, without shifting their abodes; nor is the manner of life the same in them all; some prefer the settled and cultivated spots; others indifferently frequent inhabited places, or the wildest solitude; some inhabit the uplands, others the fens; some ap∣pear to be attached to particular districts; but none of them build their nest with earth like ours, though some breed in hollow trees, like the Swifts, and others in banks, like the Sand∣martins.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that almost all the late ob∣servers agree, that in this part of America and
<PB N="553" REF="590"/>
in the adjacent islands, such as Cayenne, St. Domingo, &amp;c. the species of Swallows are more numerous and various than in Europe, and that they reside there the whole year; while, on the contrary, Father Dutertre, who travelled through the Caribbees when the colonies were just planted, assures us that Swallows are very rare in these islands, and that they are migra∣tory as in Europe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"During the seven or eight years that I lived there, I never saw more than a dozen: they appear not (he subjoins) except in the five or six months that they are seen in France."</NOTE>. If both these observations be regarded as well ascertained, they will shew the influence of civilized man on nature, since his presence is alone sufficient to invite whole species to settle and multiply. There is a cu∣rious remark made by Hagstroem in his <HI>Swedish Lapland,</HI> that corroborates this remark: he re∣lates that many birds and other animals, whe∣ther from a predilection to human society or from views of interest, gather near the new set∣tlements; he excepts, however, the geese and ducks, who observe a different conduct, and, both in the mountains and in the vallies, lead their migrations in a direction opposite to those of the Laplanders.</P>
<P>I shall conclude by remarking with Bajon and many other observers, that, in the islands and con∣tinent of America, there is often a great difference between the plumage of the male and female of the same species, and often a still greater in the
<PB N="554" REF="591"/>
same individual at different ages. And this fact will justify the liberty which I shall take in ranging them.</P>

<P>THIS bird, which inhabits St. Domingo, is somewhat differently shaped from the Swift: the bill is rather shorter; the legs ra∣ther longer; so is the tail, and also less forked; the wings much longer; lastly, the feet do not seem in the figure to have their four toes turned forward, nor does Brisson tell how many <HI>pha∣langes</HI> the toes have.</P>

<P>I CONCEIVE this bird to be a Swift from the account given by Father Feuillée, who saw it in St. Domingo. He calls it indeed a <HI>Swal∣low,</HI> but then he compares it to the Swifts, with regard to size, shape, and even colours. He saw it in the month of May sitting on a rock,
<PB N="556" REF="593"/>
and took its song for that of a lark, till the opening dawn enabled him to distinguish it. He assures us that numbers of these birds are seen in the American islands in the months of May, June, and July.</P>
<P>The predominant colour of the plumage is fine black, with the gloss of burnished steel; it spreads not only on the head, and all the upper side of the body, including the superior coverts of the tail, but also on the throat, the neck, the breast, the flanks, the thighs, the small coverts of the wings; the quills, the great superior and inferior coverts of the wings, and the quills of the tail, are blackish; the inferior coverts of the tail and of the belly are white; the bill and legs brown.</P>
<P>Total length seven inches; the bill eight lines; the tarsus six; the alar extent fourteen inches and two lines; the tail two inches and three quarters, forked nine lines, composed of twelve quills; it does not project beyond the wings.</P>
<P>Commerson brought from America three birds much like the one described by Brisson, and which seem to belong to the same species <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Hirundo Dominicensis:</HI> "It is black, with a steel gloss; its belly white."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE plumage of this bird consists of three principal colours: black is spread over the back, and as far as the superior coverts of the tail inclusively; snowy white on the under side of the body; light cinereous on the head, the throat, the neck, the superior coverts of the wings, their quills, and those of the tail: all these quills are edged with yellowish gray, and on the belly there is a light ash-coloured girdle.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Peru, where it was de∣scribed by Father Feuillée. Like all the Swifts, it has short legs; the bill short and broad at its base; the nails hooked and strong, black like the bill; and the tail forked.</P>

<HEAD>IV. The WHITE-COLLARED SWIFT. <HI>Le Martinet a Collier Blanc,</HI> Buff. <HI>Hirundo Cayanensis,</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a new species which we received from the island of Cayenne. We have ranged it with the Swifts, because it has the four toes turned forward.</P>
<P>The collar which distinguishes it is of a pure white, and very conspicuous on the bluish black, which is the prevailing colour of its plumage. The part of this collar which passes under the neck forms a narrow band, and terminates on each side in a large white spot, which occupies the throat and all the upper side of the neck; from the corners of the bill rise two small di∣verging white bands, the one stretching above the eye to form an eye-lid, the other passes un∣der the eye to some distance; lastly, on each side of the lower belly there is a white spot placed in such a manner, that it appears below and above; the rest of the upper and under sides, including the small and middle coverts of the wings, is of a velvet black with violet reflections; what appears of the great coverts of the wings next the body is brown edged with white; the great quills and those of the tail are black; the former bor∣dered interiorly with rusty brown; the bill and
<PB N="559" REF="596"/>
legs black; the feet feathered to the nails. Ba∣jon says that this Swift breeds in houses. I have seen its nest at Mauduit's; it was very large, well stuffed, and constructed with the cotton of dog's-bane <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Apocynum Cannabinum,</HI> Linn.</NOTE>; it had the shape of a truncated cone, of which one of the bases was five inches in diameter, and the other three inches; its length was nine inches; it appeared to have ad∣hered by its large base, composed of a sort of pasteboard made of the same substance: the ca∣vity of this nest was divided obliquely near its middle by a partition, which extended near the base where the eggs were lodged, and near that part there was a small heap of very soft dog's bane, which formed a kind of valve, and seemed intended to screen the young from the external air. Such precautions, in so warm a climate, shews that these Swifts feel acutely the sensa∣tion of cold. They are as large as the common Martins.</P>
<P>Total length, being the average of several spe∣cimens, five inches, and from three to eight lines; the bill six or seven; the tarsus three or five; the hind nail slender; the tail from two inches to two inches and two lines, forked eight lines, and exceeds the wings from seven to twelve lines.</P>

It is said to sit frequently among brush wood, and on half-burnt trunks that bear no leaves. It does not build a nest, but breeds in hollow trees. The upper surface of the head and of the body is blackish, glossed with violet; the wings and the tail the same, but edged with a lighter colour: all the under sur∣face of the body is rusty gray veined with brown, and growing more dilute on the lower belly and the inferior coverts of the tail.</P>

It nestles in holes made on purpose for it around the houses, and in gourds which are set on poles to invite it.

The high price which it bears tempts frequently to adulterate it, which, together with the fables that have been propa∣gated on the subject, occasions much obscurity and contradiction.</P>
<P>These nests have been compared to those of the <HI>Halcyons,</HI> and many have hastily concluded that they were the same. The ancients con∣ceived the latter to be real birds' nests, composed of slime, froth, and other impurities that float on the surface of the sea, and they distinguished them into several kinds. The one mentioned by Aristotle was of a spherical form, its mouth narrow, of a rusty colour, and of a spongy cel∣lular substance, consisting chiefly of fish-bones <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arist. <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. IX. 14. Plin. <HI>Lib XXXII.</HI> 8. There are always many of these bones and scales of fishes in the nest of our halcyon or king-fisher, but they are thinly scattered among the dust on which this bird lays its eggs, and do not enter into the composition of the nest; for our king-fisher never builds one.</NOTE>. But a slight comparison with the description which Doctor Vitaliano Donati gives of the <HI>Alcyonium</HI> of the Gulf of Venice <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Alcyonium</HI> is a marine body...approaches the round or convex figure above...its surface tuberous...completely in∣vested with very thick spines...of an earthy colour, but free from filth, of a wax-colour...the heart much softer...spongy and cavernous...with many spines much entangled and cloathed with flesh, &amp;c." <HI>Storia Naturale marina dell Adriatico,</HI> p. 58.</NOTE> will convince
<PB N="570" REF="607"/>
us that they are exactly the same, and only the <HI>nidi</HI> of sea insects. The only difference is that Donati says its entrance is large, and Aris∣totle that it is small; but these terms are evi∣dently vague: the Italian finds the mouth to be one sixth of the width of the whole.</P>
<P>But the <HI>patong</HI> of the East-Indies is the real nest of a species of Swallow. Writers are not agreed either with regard to its materials, its form, or the places where it is found: some assert that it is attached to rocks, close on the surface of the water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Curiosites de la Nature &amp; de l' Art, p.</HI> 170.</NOTE>; others, that it is lodged in the hollows of these rocks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John de Laet, Van Neck, Kircher, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and others, that it is concealed in holes made in the ground <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gemelli Carreri, <HI>Voyage round the World, t. V. p.</HI> 268.</NOTE>. And Gemelli Carreri adds, "that the sailors are always in search along the beach, and when they find earth thrown up, they open the spot with a stick, and take the eggs and the young, which are reckoned equally delicate <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The same thing has been said of our Sand-martin. <HI>Salerne, and Willughby.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P>With regard to the form of these nests, some affirm that they are hemispherical <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Musaeunt Worm.</NOTE>, while others say, "that they have many cells, which are like large conglutinated shells, and marked as such with <HI>striae</HI> and rugosities <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Father Philip Marin. <HI>Hist. de la Chine,</HI> p. 42.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="571" REF="608"/>
Of its substance, the accounts are still more various. Some assert that it is still unknown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kircher, Du Halde, &amp;c.</NOTE>; others, that it is the froth of the sea, or fish∣spawn; others, that it is strongly aromatic; others, that it is insipid; others, that it is a juice gathered by the <HI>Salanganes</HI> from the tree called <HI>calambouc;</HI> others, that it is composed of a viscous substance discharged from the bill in the love season; others, that it is formed of the fish-plants found on the sea: but the greater number agree, that the substance of these nests is transparent and like isinglass, which is the fact. The Chinese fishers assured Kaempfer that those usually sold were nothing but a preparation of the marine polypi, and he adds, that by his receipt the colour may be imitated. All these discordant relations prove that various substances, natural or artificial <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here is Kaempfer's recipe: First skin the polypes, and steep the flesh in a solution of alum for three days; then rub, wash, and clean it till it become transparent, and afterwards pickle it. <HI>Hist. du Japan, t.

<PB N="572" REF="609"/>
to that philosophical traveller, M. Poi∣vre, formerly <HI>Intendant</HI> of the Islands of France and Bourbon. That gentleman was so obliging as to send me the following account.</P>
<P><Q>“”In 1741 I embarked in the ship Mars, bound for China, and in the month of July, the same year, we reached the straits of Sunda, very near Java, and between two small islets, called the <HI>Great and Little Tocque.</HI></Q> We were there becalmed, and went ashore on Little Tocque to hunt green pigeons. While the rest of the party were clambering among the precipices, I walked along the beach to gather shells and jointed corals, which are found here in great abundance. After having made almost an en∣tire circuit of the islet, it was growing late, when a sailor who accompanied me, discovering a deep cavern in the rocks on the brink of the sea, went into it, and scarce advanced two or three steps when he called aloud to me. I hastened to the mouth of the cavern, and found it darkened by an immense cloud of small birds, which poured out like swarms. I entered it, and knocked down with my cane many of these poor little birds, with which I was then unac∣quainted; as I penetrated farther, I perceived the roof of the cavern to be covered entirely with small nests shaped like holy-water-pots <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Each of these nests contained two or three eggs or young ones, which lay softly on feathers, like those which the parents had on their breast. As these nests soften in water, they could not with∣stand rain, or bear an exposure near the surface of the sea.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="573" REF="610"/>
sailor had already broken off several, and had filled his frock with them and with birds. I also de∣tached some of the nests, and found them glued firmly to the rock. Night now came on, and we returned to the ship with the fruits of our excursion.</P>
<P><Q>“”The nests which we brought were known by many of our people on board, who had made several voyages to China, to be the same with those so highly valued in that country.</Q> The sailor kept several pounds, which he sold to good account at Canton. For my part, I de∣lineated and coloured these birds with their nests and their young; and I discovered them to be real Swallows: they were about the size of the larger kind of humming-birds <HI>(colibris).</HI></P>
<P><Q>“”Since that time I have observed, in several voyages,</Q> that, in the months of March and April, the seas which extend from Java to Cochin-China, and from the promontory of Sumatra to New Guinea, are covered with fish-spawn, which floats on the water like strong glue half-melted. I have learnt from the Malays, the Cochin-Chinese, and from the natives of the Philippines and Moluccas, that this is the substance of which the <HI>Sa∣langane</HI> constructs its nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It gathers the spawn either by razing the surface of the sea, or by alighting on the rocks on which it is cast and coagulated. Sometimes threads of this viscous substance are seen hanging at the bills of these birds, and which have been supposed, but without foundation, to be extracted from their stomach in the love-season.</NOTE>. They all agree in
<PB N="574" REF="611"/>
this account. On passing the Moluccas in April and the straits of Sunda in March, I fished up some of this spawn with a bucket, and after hav∣ing drained off the water and dried it, I found it resembled exactly the substance of those nests.</P>
<P><Q>“”About the end of July and the beginning of August,</Q> it is customary with the people of Cochin-China to rove the islets, which skirt their coast to the distance of twenty leagues, in search of the nests of these little Swallows...</P>
<P>"The Salanganes are seldom ever found, but in that immense Archipelago which encircles the eastern extremity of Asia....All that Archipelago, where the islets may be said al∣most to touch each other, is extremely favour∣able to the breeding of fish; their spawn is very abundant; the water is there warmer than in the ocean."</P>
<P>I have observed several of these nests; they resembled the half of an oblong hollow ellipsoid, made by cutting it at right angles through the middle of the larger axis; and the plane of this section had stuck to the rock: they consisted of a yellowish white substance, semi-transparent; composed externally of exceeding thin and nearly concentric layers; the inside was formed of ir∣regular net-work, the meshes very unequal,
<PB N="575" REF="612"/>
and placed one above another, the threads being drawn from the same substance with the outer layers, and much interwoven.</P>
<P>In the nests which were entire, no feather could be perceived; but on cutting carefully into their substance, we found some entangled, which diminished the transparency of the part. Sometimes, though much more rarely, we dis∣covered fragments of egg-shells; and almost all of them had vestiges of the birds' excre∣ments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Most of these observations were first made by Daubenton the younger, who communicated them to me with several nests of Sa∣langanes, where I observed the same things.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I held in my mouth, a whole hour, a scale de∣tached from one of these nests; it had at first a slight saline flavour, afterwards it was insipid as paste; it did not dissolve, but softened and swelled. M. Poivre also found it had only the taste of isinglass, and be assures us that the Chinese value it solely for its nutritious invigor∣ating quality; he adds, that he never ate any thing so rich and strengthening as the soup made with it and meat <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Might not this soup owe part of its qualities to the flesh used in making it?</NOTE>. If the <HI>Salanganes</HI> feed on the same substance with which they build their nest, and which is so plentiful in those seas, and if it has the prolific property, which the Chinese ascribe to it, no wonder that the spe∣cies is very numerous. It is said that a thou∣sand
<PB N="576" REF="613"/>
casks of these nests are annually exported from Batavia, having been procured from the islets of Cochin-China and the East. Each cask weighs one hundred and twenty-five pounds, and each nest half an ounce <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Etablissemens Europeens dans les Indes Orientales, t. I. liv.</HI> 2.</NOTE>; hence the whole must amount to one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, and contain four millions of nests.</P>
<P>I must confess, however, that the philosopher Redi <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> the observations of Redi in the <HI>Coll. Acad. part. etrax. t. IV. p.</HI> 567. If it be true, as alleged, that the Hollanders be∣gin to import these nests into Europe, the fact will be soon ascer∣tained.</NOTE>, judging from experiments made by others, and perhaps incomplete, entertains great doubts with regard to the restorative virtue of these nests, which is attested by many other writers, who on that point agree with Poivre <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Comedunt in primis ii qui in castris venereis strenue se exercere vo∣lunt.</HI> Musaeum Wormianum, <HI>Lib.

<P>Nothing better shews that the Salangane has remained long unknown, than the different names bestowed on it. It is called the <HI>Sea-Swallow</HI> and the <HI>Halcyon:</HI> its wings have been supposed to be blue, and it has been represented as sometimes equal in size to the ordinary Swal∣lows, sometimes as larger, sometimes as smaller. In short, nothing accurate was known before M. Poivre.</P>
<P><PB N="577" REF="614"/>
Kircher had asserted that these birds appear on the coast only in the breeding season, and that it is uncertain where they live during the rest of the year; but M. Poivre informs us, that they remain constantly in those islets and rocks where they were hatched, and that they live like the European Swallows, only they circle rather less; in fact, their wings are somewhat shorter.</P>
<P>They have only two colours, blackish on the upper surface, and whitish on all the under sur∣face, and also on the tips of the tail-quills; the iris is yellow, the bill black, and the legs brown.</P>
<P>It is rather smaller than the wren; its total length two inches three lines; the tarsus as many; the hind toe the shortest; the tail ten lines, forked three, composed of twelve quills, and projects three fourths of its length beyond the wings. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Hirundo Esculenta:</HI> "All its tail-quills are marked with a white spot."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>XI. The WHEAT SWALLOW. <HI>La Grande Hirondelle Brune a Venire Tacheté</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The Great Brown Swallow with a spotted tail.</NOTE>, <HI>ou Hirondelle des Bles,</HI> Buff. <HI>Hirunao Borbonica,</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THIS bird is usually called the Corn Swallow in the Isle of France; it haunts the wheat fields, the glades of the woods, and prefers the uplands; it frequently sits on trees and on stones; it follows the herds, or rather the in∣sects which infest them: it is also seen, from time to time, flying in large troops behind the vessels lying in the roads, and constantly in the pursuit of winged insects; its cry is much like that of the common Swallow.</P>
<P>The Viscount de Querhoent observed that the Wheat Swallows circled frequently in the evening near a cut which had been made in a mountain; and he thence conjectures that, like our Sand-martins and Swifts, they pass the night in holes under ground, or in crevices of the rocks. They, no doubt, breed in the same re∣treats; which may be the reason that their nests are unknown in the Isle of France. The Vis∣count de Querhoent could procure no account of their incubation but from an old person of the Isle of Bourbon, and born in the country, who told him that they sat in September and Octo∣ber,
<PB N="579" REF="616"/>
that he had caught many on their nests in caverns and the holes of rocks, &amp;c. that these are composed of straw and a few feathers, and that he never saw more than two eggs, which were gray and dotted with brown.</P>
<P>This Swallow is as large as our Swift; the upper surface of its body blackish brown; the under surface gray, sprinkled with long brown spots; the tail square; the bill and the legs black.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>VARIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Little Brown Swallow with a spotted tail, from the Isle of Bourbon, must be regarded as a variety of size from the preceding species. It has also some slight differences of colours; the upper surface of its head, of its wings, and tail, is blackish brown; the three last quills of the wings are terminated with dirty white, and edged with greenish brown; this last colour spreads over all the rest of the upper surface; the throat and all the under side of the body, including the inferior coverts of the tail, are marked with longitudinal brown spots, on a gray ground.</P>
<P>Total length four inches nine lines; the bill seven or eight lines; the tarsus six lines; all the nails short and slightly hooked; the tail near two inches, square, and falls about seven lines short of the wings.</P>

<HEAD>XII. The GRAY-RUMPED SWALLOW. <HI>La Petite Hirondelle Noire a Croupion Gris</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The Little Black Swallow with a gray rump.</NOTE>, Buff. <HI>Hirundo Francica,</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>COMMERSON brought this new species from the Isle of France; it is scarce, though there are abundance of insects in that island; it is even lean, and its flesh unpalatable; it lives indifferently in the town or the country, but al∣ways near springs; it is never observed to sit; it flies with great celerity; it is as large as a tit∣mouse, and weighs two gros and a half. The Viscount de Querhoent saw it frequently to∣wards the evening in the skirts of the woods, and he thence infers that it chooses the sylvan shades for its nocturnal retreats.</P>
<P>All the upper surface is of an uniform black∣ish, except the rump, which is whitish, and this is likewise the colour of the under surface.</P>
<P>Total length four inches two lines; the bill five lines; the tarsus four lines; the alar extent nine inches; the tail near two inches, and, in the subject described by Commerson, it had only ten quills, which were nearly equal; it is ten lines shorter than the wings, which consist of seventeen or eighteen quills.</P>
<P>A specimen brought from the East Indies by
<PB N="581" REF="618"/>
Sonnerat, appears to me to belong to this spe∣cies, or rather to form the shade between this species and the preceding variety; for the under side of the body was spotted like the latter, and it resembled the former in the colour of the upper side of the body, and in the dimensions; only the wings projected seventeen lines beyond the tail, and the nails were slender and hooked.</P>

<P>ALL the upper surface except the rump is blackish brown, with reflections fluctuat∣ing between brown green and deep blue; the rufous colour of the rump is a little mingled, each feather being edged with whitish; the quills of the tail brown; those of the wings also brown, with some greenish reflections; the pri∣maries edged interiorly with whitish, and the secondaries edged with the same colour, which rises a little on the outside; all the under surface of the body is dirty white; and the inferior co∣verts of the tail rusty.</P>
<P><PB N="582" REF="619"/>
Total length six inches and a half; the bill nine or ten lines; the tarsus five or six; the toes disposed three one way and one the other; the alar extent about ten inches; the tail two inches, almost square at the end, and a little shorter than the wings.</P>
<P>Commerson saw this Swallow on the banks of the De la Plata in May 1765. He brought from the same country another bird which may be regarded as a variety of this species; it dif∣fered in having its throat rusty, more white than rufous on the rump and the lower coverts of the tail; all the quills of the tail of the wings were deeper, with more distinct reflections; no white on the great quills of the wings, which pro∣jected ten lines beyond the tail, which was a little forked; the alar extent eleven inches.</P>

<HEAD>XIV. The SHARP-TAILED BROWN SWALLOW of LOUISIANA. <HI>Hirundo Pelasgia,</HI> Var. Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are some Swallows in America whose tail-quills are entirely destitute of webs at the ends, and terminate in a point.</P>
<P>The present was brought from Louisiana by Lebeau; its throat and the fore side of the neck
<PB N="583" REF="620"/>
were dirty white, spotted with greenish brown; all the rest of the plumage appeared of a pretty uniform brown, especially at first sight; for, on a nearer inspection, we perceive that the head and the upper surface of the body, includ∣ing the superior coverts of the wings, are of a deeper cast; the rump and the under surface of the body are lighter, the wings blackish, edged interiorly with black; the legs are brown.</P>
<P>Total length four inches and three lines; the bill seven lines; the tarsus six lines; the middle toe six lines; the hind toe the shortest; the tail seventeen or eighteen lines, including the pointed shafts, a little rounded at the end; these shafts black, and four or five lines long; those of the middle quills of the wings largest, and twenty∣two lines shorter than the wings.</P>
<P>The American Swallow of Catesby, and the Carolina Swallow of Brisson <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P><HI>Hirundo Pelasgia,</HI> Linn. and Gmel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aculeated Swallow,</HI> Penn. and Lath.</P></Q></NOTE>, is much shorter winged than that from Louisiana, but resembles it exactly in size, in its general proportions, in its plumage, and in the sharp shafts; and as the climate is nearly the same, if the great differ∣ence in the length of the wings were not con∣stant, we might regard it as a variety of the same species. The times of its arrival in Caro∣lina and Virginia, and of its departure from those countries, correspond, says Catesby, to the ap∣pearance
<PB N="584" REF="621"/>
and retreat of the Swallows in England. He suspects that they winter in Brazil, and he tells us that they breed in the chimneys in Carolina.</P>
<P>Total length four inches and three lines; the bill five lines, the tarsus the same, the mid toe six; the tail eighteen lines, and three lines shorter than the wings.</P>
<P>The Sharp-tailed Swallow of Cayenne, called <HI>camaria,</HI> resembles more that of Louisiana, in its size, than that of Carolina; its wings being longer than the latter and shorter than the for∣mer. On the other hand, it differs rather more in its colours, for the upper side of the body is deeper brown, and verging on blue; the rump gray; the throat and the fore part of the neck gray, with a rusty cast; the under side of the body grayish shaded with brown; in general, the colour of the higher parts is rather brighter and more distinct than that of the lower. Per∣haps it is a sexual variety, especially as the Cayenne Swallow has been reckoned a male.</P>
<P>It is said in Guiana never to approach the settlements; and certainly it does not breed in the chimneys, for there are no chimneys in that country.</P>
<P>Total length four inches and seven lines; the bill four lines, the tarsus five; the tail twenty lines including the points, which are two or three lines; the wings extend about an inch beyond it.</P>

<P>All the upper side of the head and body black without any exception, the throat gray brown, and the rest of the under side of the body dull brown; the bill black and the legs brown.</P>
<P>Total length three inches and eight lines; the bill four lines, the tarsus the same; the mid toe four lines and a half; the alar extent eight inches and eight lines, and eight lines shorter than the wings.</P>
