of LIFE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB x. I.</BIBL>
<Q>My soul is weary of my life.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JOB, in the first part of his days, was
<HI>the greatest of all the men of the East.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM I.</NOTE>
His possessions were large; his family
was numerous and flourishing; his own
character was fair and blameless. Yet
this man it pleased God to visit with
extraordinary reverses of fortune. He
was robbed of his whole substance. His
sons and daughters all perished; and he
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
himself, fallen from his high estate, child∣less
and reduced to poverty, was smitten
with sore disease. His friends came a∣bout
him, seemingly with the purpose of
administering comfort. But from a harsh
and ill-founded construction of the in∣tention
of Providence in his disasters,
they only added to his sorrows by un∣just
upbraiding. Hence those many pa∣thetic
lamentations with which this book
abounds, poured forth in the most beau∣tiful
and touching strain of Oriental poe∣try.
In one of those hours of lamenta∣tion,
the sentiment in the text was utter∣ed;
<HI>My soul is weary of my life;</HI> a sen∣timent,
which surely, if any situation
can justify it, was allowable in the case
of Job.</P>
<P>In situations very different from that
of Job, under calamities far less severe,
it is not uncommon to find such a sen∣timent
working in the heart, and some∣times
breaking forth from the lips of
men. Many, very many there are, who
on one occasion or other, have experien∣ced
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
this weariness of life, and been tempt∣ed
to wish that it would come to a close.
Let us now examine in what circumstan∣ces
this feeling may be deemed excuse∣able;
in what it is to be held sinful;
and under what restractions we may, on
any occasion, be permitted to say, <HI>My
soul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL consider the words of the text
in three lights; as expressing, <HI>First,</HI> The
sentiment of a discontented man; <HI>Second∣ly,</HI>
The sentiment of an afflicted man;
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> The sentiment of a devout man.</P>
<P>I. LET us consider the text as expressing
the sentiment of a discontented man;
with whom it is the effusion of spleen,
vexation, and dissatisfaction with life, a∣rising
from causes neither laudable nor
justifiable. There are chiefly three clas∣ses
of men who are liable to this disease
of the mind: the idle; the luxurious; the
criminal.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13"/>
<HI>First,</HI> THIS weariness of life is often
found among the idle; persons common∣ly
in easy circumstances of fortune, who
are not engaged in any of the laborious
occupations of the world, and who are,
at the same time, without energy of mind
to call them forth into any other line of
active exertion. In this languid, or ra∣ther
torpid state, they have so many va∣cant
hours, and are so much at a loss
how to fill up their time, that their spi∣rits
utterly sink; they become burden∣some
to themselves, and to every one a∣round
them; and drag with pain the
load of existence. What a convincing
proof is hereby afforded, that man was
designed by his Creator to be an active
being, whose happiness is to be found
not merely in rest, but in occupation
and pursuit? The idle are doomed to
suffer the natural punishment of their
inactivity and folly; and for their com∣plaints
of the tiresomenss of life there
is no remedy but to awake from the
dream of sloth, and to fill up with pro∣per
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
employment the miserable vacancies
of their days. Let them study to be∣come
useful to the world, and they shall
soon become less burdensome to them∣selves.
They shall begin to enjoy exist∣ence;
they shall reap the rewards which
Providence has annexed to virtuous ac∣tivity;
and have no more cause to say,
<HI>My soul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> THE luxurious and the dissipated
form another class of men, among whom
such complaints are still more frequent.
With them they are not the fruit of idle∣ness.
These are men who have been
busied enough; they have run the whole
race of pleasure; but they have run it
with such inconsiderate speed, that it ter∣minates
in weariness and vexation of spi∣rit.
By the perpetual course of dissipa∣tion
in which they are engaged; by the
excesses which they indulge; by the rio∣tous
revel, and the midnight or rather
morning hours to which they prolong
their festivity; they have debilitated their
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
bodies, and worn out their spirits. Sa∣tiated
with the repetition of their ac∣customed
pleasures, and yet unable to
find any new ones in their place; wan∣dering
round and round their former
haunts of joy, and ever retuning dis∣appointed;
weary of themselves, and of
all things about them, their spirits are
opressed with a deadly gloom, and the
complaint bursts forth of odious life and
a miserable world. Never are these com∣plaints
more frequent than at the close
of rounds of amusement, and after a long
repetition of festal pleasures; when the
spirits which had been forced up, as by
some intoxicating drug, to an unnatural
height, subside into profound dejection.
What increases the evil is, that it is not
among the infirm and the aged, but a∣mong
the young, the gay, and the pros∣perous,
who ought to be reputed the hap∣piest
men, that this distaste of life most
frequently prevails.</P>
<P>When persons of this description, in
their peevish and splenetic hours, exclaim,
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
<HI>My soul is weary of my life,</HI> let them
know, let them be assured, that this is
no other than the judgement of God, o∣vertaking
them for their vices and fol∣lies.
Their complaints of misery are en∣titled
to no compassion; nay, they are
sinful, because they arise from a sinful
cause; from a mind broken and debased
by luxury and corruption. They are the
authors of their own misery, by having
thrown away on the follies of the world
those powers which God had bestowed
on them for nobler ends.—Let them re∣turn
to the duties of men and Christians.
Let them retreat from frivolity, and ab∣stain
from ecess. Let them study tem∣perance,
moderation, and self-command.
By entering on a virtuous and manly
course of action, and applying to the ho∣nourable
discharge of the functions of
their station, they will acquire different
views. They will obtain more real enjoy∣ment
of life, and become more willing to
prolong it.—But, after the warnings
which God has given them of their mis∣behaviour
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
by the inward misery they
suffer, if they still continue to run the
same intemperate round, and to drain
pleasure to the last dregs, it shall come
to pass, that they who now contemn life,
and are impatient of its continuance,
shall be the persons most eager to pro∣long
it. When they behold it in reality
drawing towards a close, and are obliged
to look forward to what is to come after
it, they shall be rendered awfully sensi∣ble
of its value. They will then grasp
eagerly at the flying hours; anxious to
stop them if they could, and to employ
every moment that remains in repairing
their past errors, and in making their
peace, if possible, with God and heaven.
According as <HI>they have hown,</HI> they now
<HI>reap.</HI> They are reduced <HI>to eat the fruit
of their own ways, and to be filled with
their own devices.</HI></P>
<P>THERE remains still a third class of those
who from discontent are become weary
of life; such as have embittered it to
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
themselves by the consciousness of cri∣minal
deeds. They have been, perhaps,
unnatural to their parents, or treache∣rous
to their friends; they have viola∣ted
their fidelity; have ensnared and
ruined the innocent; or have occasioned
the death of others. There is no won∣der
that such persons should lose their
relish for life. To whatever arts they
may have recourse for procuring a de∣ceitful
peace, conscience will at times ex∣ert
its native power, and shake over them
its terrific scourge. The internal misery
they endure has sometimes arisen to such
a height, as has made them terminate,
with their own hands, an existence which
they felt to be insupportable.—To the
complaints of such persons no remedy
can be furnished, except what arises from
the bitterness of sincere and deep repen∣tance.
We can do no more than exhort
for the evils they have committed; and
to fly to the divine mercy through Jesus
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
Christ for pardon and forgiveness. Let
us now,</P>
<P>II. TURN to persons of another descrip∣tion,
and consider the sentiment in the
text as extorted by situations of distress.
These are so varioussly multiplied in the
world, and often so oppressive and heavy,
that assuredly it is not uncommon to hear
the afflicted complain that they are weary
of life. Their complaints, if not always
allowable, yet certainly are more excusable
than those which flow from the sources
of dissatisfaction already mentioned. They
are sufferers, not so much through their
own misconduct, as through the appoint∣ment
of Providence; and therefore to
persons in this situation it may seem more
needful to offer consolation, than to give
admonition. However, as the evils which
produce this impatience of life are of
different sorts, a distinction must be made
as to the situations which can most ex∣cuse
it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20"/>
SOMETIMES, the exclamation in the
text may be occasioned by deep and over∣whelming
grief. When they whom we
had most affectionately loved, and in
whom we had placed the felicity of our
days, are taken away, our connection
with life appears to be dissolved. “Why
should we survive those to whom our
souls were tied? Would to God we
had died before them! Now when they
are gone, all pleasure and hope is gone
as to us. To us the sun no longer shines
with his usual brightness. No longer
cheerfulnss invests the face of nature.
On every object a sad gloom appears
to rest; and every employment of life
is become an oppressive burden.” With
the feelings of those who are thus dis∣tressed
we naturally sympathise. They
are frequently the feelings of the most
virtuous and amiable minds: And yet
such persons must be told, that grief may
be indulged so far as to become immo∣derate
and improper. There are bounds
which are prescribbed to it both by reason
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
and by religion. A Christian ought not
to <HI>mourn like those who have no hope.</HI>
While he feels his sorrows as a man, he
should also study to bear them like a
man, with fortitude; and not abandon
himself to feeble and fruitless melancho∣ly.
Let him have recorse to a stre∣nuous
discharge of the duties of his sta∣tion,
and consider it as incumbent on
him to make the best improvement that
he can of those comforts which Provi∣dence
has still left in his possession.</P>
<P>AGAIN; if sometimes happens that, a∣part
from grief, great reverses of world∣ly
fortune give rise to the lamentation
in the text. This was the case with Job
himself. A sudden fall from opulence
into indigence and want; some underser∣ved
disgrace incurred, or some unexpect∣ed
cloud thrown over former reputation
and fame; the unkindness and desertion
of friends, or the insolent triumph of e∣nemies,
are apt to overwhelm the minds
of men with gloom, and to reduce them
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
to be weary of life. To persons under
such calamities, sympathy is due. That
sympathy, however, will be proportion∣ed
to the degree in which we consider
them as free from blame in the misfor∣tunes
which they suffer. As far as,
through their own misconduct and vice,
they have been the authors to themselves
of those misfortunes, we withdraw our
pity. The burthen which they have
brought on themselves we leave them
to bear us they can; and with little con∣cern
we hear them exclaim that their
<HI>souls are weary of life.</HI>—Not only so, but
even in cases where calamities have fallen
on the innocent, to the pity which we
feel for them will be joined a secret con∣tempt,
if we perceive that together with
their prosperity, their courage and for∣titude
have also forsaken them. To a∣bandon
themselves to dejection carries
no mark of a great or a worthy mind.
Instead of declaring that his <HI>soul is weary
of his life,</HI> it becomes a brave and a good
man, in the evil day, with firmness to
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
maintain his post; to bear up against the
storm; to have recourse to those advan∣tages
which, in the worst of times, are
always left to integrity and virtue; and
never to give up the hope that better
days may yet arise.</P>
<P>It is good for persons in such situations
to remark that, though Job was for a
long while severely tried by a variety of
distresses, yet his condition was not left
finally unhappy. On the contrary, the
gooness of that God whom he had serv∣ed
returned at last, to shine upon him
with greater brightenss than ever. His
riches were restored to him twofold. The
losses in his family were repaired by a
new offspring. His name became again
renowned in the East; and <HI>the latter
end of Job,</HI> we are told, <HI>was more bles∣sed
than the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>BUT still, it may be asked, will not
the continuance of long and severe dis∣ease
justify the exclamation in the text,
<HI>My soul is weary of my life?</HI> To persons
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
who are forsaken by all the blessings of
health, and who have no prospect left,
but that of lingering under sickness or
pain, Job's complaint may assuredly be
forgiven more than to any others. Though
it might be suggested to them, that even
in old age and sickness, except in very
extreme cases, some resources are always
left, of which they may avail themselves
for relief; yet it must be admitted, that
lawfully they may wish their sufferings
to be brought to an end. Still, however,
they must remember, that resignation to
the pleasure of heaven continues to be
their duty to the last. As long as any
part remains to be acted, as long as their
continuance in the world can serve any
valuable purpose, it is more honourable
to bear the load with magnanimity, than
to give way to a querulous and dejected
spirit. It remains,</P>
<P>III. To adderss myself to another or∣der
of men, among whom, though more
rarely than among those whom I have
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
describbed, the sentiment of the text is to
be found. They are persons who have
no particular complaint to make of the
injustice of the world, or the afflictions
of their state. But they are tired of the
vanity of the world, of its insipid enjoy∣ments,
and its perpetually revolving cir∣cle
of trisles and follies. They feel
themselves made for something greater
and nobler. They are disgusted and hurt
with the scenes of wickedness that are
often passing before their eyes. Their
hearts are warmed with the thoughts of
a purer and more perfect existence de∣signed
for man; and in the moments of
aspiration after it, the exclamation breaks
forth. <HI>My soul is weary of my life.—O that
I had wings like a dove! for then I would
fly away and be at re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Lo then I would
wander far off, and remain in the wilder∣ness.
I would hasten my escape from the
windy storm and tempest. For I have seen
violence and strife in the city. Wickedness
is in the nudst thereof; deceit and guile de∣part
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
part not from her streets</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6 11</NOTE>.—In this view
the sentiment in the text may sometimes
be that of a devout man. But such per∣sons
I must admonish, that their devo∣tion,
how sincere however, is not alto∣gether
of a rational and chastened kind.
It was form this temper that, in former
ages of the church, the numerous race
sprung of anchorets, hermits, and all the
various orders who voluntarily abandon∣ed
the world, to people the lonely disarts
and the monastic retreat. The ordinary
course of things seemed below them as
candidates for heaven. The concerns of
the world appeared unworthy of their
attention, and dangerous to their virtue.
Breathing after a higher state, they ima∣gined
that they could not abstract them∣selves
too much from every earthly a∣musement,
as long as they were forced
to remain in this place of exile.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27"/>
Let us beware of all such imaginary
refinements as produce a total disrelish
of our present condition. They are, for
the most part, grafted either on disap∣pointed
pursuits, or on a melancholy and
splenetic cast of mind. They are far
from contributing to happiness, and are
inconsistent with all the active virtues of
man. This life deserves not indeed to
be put in competition with that blessed
immortality to which God has raised our
hopes. But such as it is, it is the gift
of God. It is the sphere in which his
wisdom has placed us, and appointed us
to act our parts. As long as it lasts, we
must neither slight the duties which it
requires, nor undervalue the innocent
enjoyments which it offers. It belongs
to a man to live among men as his bre∣thren;
which he who declares himself
weary of life is not qualified to do with
propriety.</P>
<P>THUS I have placed before you, in
various views, the sentiment in the text;
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
and have shewn in what circumstances,
and from what causes, that disrelish of
life arises which is often found among
mankind. On a review of the whole,
we cannot but acknowledge, that it is
oftener to be ascribed to our own vices
and follies, than to any other cause. A∣mong
the multitudes in the world, to
whom at this day life is burdensome, the
far greater number is of those who have
rendered it so to themselves. Their idle∣ness,
their luxury and pleasures, their
criminal deeds, their immoderate passions,
their timidity and baseness of mind, have
dejected them in such a degree, as to
make them weary of their existence.
Preyed upon by discontent of their own
creating, they complain of life when they
ought to reprehend themselves.</P>
<P>Various asllictions there doubtless are
in the world; many persons with whom
we have cause to sympathise, and whom
we might reasonably forgive for wish∣ing
death to close their sorrows. But of
the evils which embitter life, it must be
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
admitted, that the greater part is such as
we have brought on ourselves; or at least
such as, if we were not wanting to our∣selves,
might be tolerably supported.
When we compute the numbers of those
who are disposed to say, <HI>My soul is weary
of my life,</HI> some there are to whom this
sentiment is excusable; but many more
among whom it is in no way justifiable.
I admit that, among the worthiest and
the best, there may be dark moments
in which some feeling of this nature may
be apt to intrude upon their minds. But
with them they are only moments of
occasional and passing gloom. They soon
recall the vigour of their minds; and re∣turn
with satisfaction to the discharge
of the duties, and to a participation of
the enjoyments, of life.</P>
<P>One great cause of men's becoming
weary of life is grounded on the mista∣ken
views of it which they have formed,
and the false hopes which they have en∣tertained
from it. They have expected a
scene of enjoyment; and when they meet
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
with disappointments and distresses, they
complain of life, as if it had cheated and
betrayed them. God ordained no such
possession for man on earth as continued
pleasure. For the wisest purposes he de∣signed
our state to be checquered with
pleasure and pain. As such let us receive
it, and make the best of what is doomed
to be our lot. Let us remain persuaded,
that simple and moderate pleasures are
always the best; that virtue and a good
conscience are the surest foundations of
enjoyment; that he who serves his God
and his Saviour with the purest inten∣tions,
and governs his passions with the
greatest care, is likely to lead the happiest
life. Following these principles, we shall
meet with fewer occasions of being wea∣ry
of life; we shall always find some sa∣tisfactions
mixed with its corsses; and
shall be enabled to wait with a humble
and contented mind till the Almighty,
in his appointed time, finish our state of
trial, and remove us to a more blessed
abode.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from this chapter, that one
design of the Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II.</NOTE> in writing to
Timothy, was to guard him against cer∣tain
corrupters of Christian doctrine, who
had already arisen in the church. To
their false representations of religion he
opposes that general view of it which is
given in the text. Such summaries of
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
religion frequently occur in the sacred
writings; and are extremely useful. By
the comprehensive energy with which they
express the great lines of our duty, they
both imprint them on our memory, and
bring them home to our conscience with
force. In the progress of this discourse,
I hope to make it appear, that the words
of the text afford a most enlarged and
instructive view of religion in all its
chief parts.</P>
<P>The Apostle pronounces charity to be
<HI>the nd</HI> or scope <HI>of the commandment,</HI> that
is, of the law of God. At the same time,
in order to prevent mistakes on this most
important subject, he subjoins to charity
certain adjuncts, as necessary to qualify
it, and to render the Christian character
complete. These are the <HI>pure heart,</HI> the
<HI>good conscience,</HI> and <HI>faith unfeigned.</HI> In
treating of these, I shall shew the nature
of their connexion with charity, and the
importance of their being always united
with it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="33"/>
<HI>The end of the commandment is charity.</HI>
Charity is the same with benevolence or
love; and is the term uniformly em∣ployed,
in the New Testament, to denote
all the good affections which we ought
to bear towards one another. It consists
not in speculative ideas of general bene∣volence
floating in the head, and leaving
the heart, as speculations too often do,
untouched and cold. Neither is it con∣fined
to that indolent good nature, which
makes us rest satisfied with being free
from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our
fellow-creatures, without prompting us
to be of service to any. True charity
is an active principle. It is not proper∣ly
a single virtue; but a disposition re∣siding
in the heart, as a fountain whence
all the virtues of benignity, candour, for∣bearance,
generosity, compassion, and li∣berality,
flow, as so many native streams.
From general good-will to all, it extends
its influence particularly to those with
whom we stand in nearest connection,
and who are directly within the sphere
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
of our good offices. From the country
or community to which we belong, it
descends to the smaller associations of
neighbourhood, relations, and friends;
and spreads itself over the whole circle
of social and domestic life. I mean not
that it imports a promiscuous undistin∣guishing
affection, which gives every
man an equal title to our love. Cha∣rity,
if we should endeavour to carry it
so far, would be rendered an impracti∣cable
virtue, and would resolve iself
into mere words, without affecting the
heart. True charity attempts not to shut
our eyes to the distinction between good
and bad men; nor to warm our hearts
equally to those who befriend and those
who injure us. It reserves our esteem
for good men, and our complacency for
our friends. Towards our enemies it
inspires forgiveness and humanity. It
breathes universal candour, and liberality
of sentiment. It forms gentleness of
temper, and dictates affability of man∣ners.
It prompts corresponding sypa∣thies
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
with them who rejoice and them
who weep. It teaches us to slight and
despise no man. Charity is the comfort∣er
of the afflicted, the protector of the
oppressed, the reconciler of differences,
the intercessor for offenders. It is faith∣fulness
in the friend, public spirit in the
magistrate, equity and patience in the
judge, moderation in the sovereign, and
loyalty in the subject. In parents it is
care and attention; in children it is re∣verence
and submission. In a word, it
is the soul of social life. It is the sun
that enlivens and cheers the abodes of
nien. It is <HI>like the dew of Hermon,</HI> says
the Psalmist, <HI>and the dew that descendet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on the mountains of Zion, where the Lord
commanded the blessing, even life for ever∣more</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH charity, says the text, is <HI>the end
of the commandment.</HI> This assertion of the
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
Apostle is undoubtedly consonant to all
that reason can suggest on the subject of
religion. For, on considering the nature
of the Supreme Being, reason gives us
much ground to believe, that the chief
design of all the commandments which
he has given to men, is to promote their
happiness. Independent and self-sufficient,
that Supreme Being has nothing to exact
from us for his own interest or felicity.
By our services he cannot be benefited,
nor by our offences injured. When he
created the world, it was benevolence that
moved him to confer existence. When
he made himself known to his creatures,
benevolence in like manner moved him
to give them laws for their conduct.
Benevolence is the spring of legislation
in the Deity, as much as it was the mo∣tive
of creation. He issued his com∣mands
on earth on purpose that by o∣bedience
to them, his creatures might be
rendered happy among themselves in this
life, and be prepared for greater happiness
in another. Charity, especially when
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
joined with purity, good conscience, and
faith, is obviously the great instrument
for this purpose; and therefore must needs
possess the chief and primary place in the
laws of God.</P>
<P>Accordingly, throughout the New Tes∣tament,
it is uniformly presented to us
in the same light in which it is placed by
the text. This is known to all who have
any acquaintance with the sacred books.
Charity is termed <HI>the fulfilling of the law,</HI>
and <HI>the bond of perfectness.</HI> It was assum∣ed
by our blessed Lord as the characte∣ristical
distinction of his disciples; and
in that magnificent eulogium which the
Apostle Paul pronounces upon it, in the
thirteenth chapter of the first epistle to the
Corinthians, it is expressly preferred by
him to <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope.</HI> This deserves to
be seriously considered by those who are
apt to undervalue charity, as an appen∣dage
of what they contemptuously call
Morality; while they confine true reli∣gion
to some favourite tenets and obser∣vances
of their own, which they consi∣der
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
as comprehending the sum of what
is acceptable to God. Such persons show
themselves profoundly ignorant of the
nature of religion, and may too often be
suspected of being strangers to its influ∣ence.
For, as the apostle John reasons,
He <HI>that loveth not his brother, whom he
hath seen, how can be love that God whom
he hath not seen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iv. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>AT the same time, while I ascribe to
charity that high place in the system of re∣ligion,
which justly belongs to it, I am not
to be understood as confining all religion
to this disposition alone. With much
wisdom and propriety, the text hath an∣nexed
to it certain adjuncts, without
which neither the character of a good
man can be completed, nor charity it∣self
exercised to advantage. To the con∣sideration
of these I now proceed; and
I enter the more readily on this branch
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
of the subject, as there is ground to be∣lieve,
that many pretend to possess cha∣rity,
without properly understanding its
nature and efficacy. There has been al∣ways
an unhappy tendency among men
to run to extremes, on one side or other,
in matters of religion. As one set of
men, who employ all their zeal on right
belief, are prone to undervalue good prac∣tice;
so another set, who wish to be e∣steemed
rational Christians, are inclined
to rest the whole of their duty on chari∣table
deeds, while they overlook cer∣tain
dispositions and habits which ought
always to accompany them. It is there∣fore
of importance, that the mistakes of
both these classes of men should be recti∣sied,
in order that religion may be held
forth to the world in its complete form,
and in its sull and undiminshed lustre.</P>
<P>THE first qualification of charity point∣ed
out in the text is purity; <HI>charity out
of a pure heart.</HI> Purity includes the vir∣tues
which belong to the individual,
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
considered in himself, and with respect
to the government of his desires and
pleasures. It hath its seat in the heart;
but extends its influence over so much
of the outward conduct, as to form a
great and material part of the character.
They are only the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> we are
told by our Saviour, <HI>who can see God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 8.</NOTE>.
It is also true, that they are only the <HI>pure
in heart</HI> who can properly discharge their
duties towards mankind. Inordinate love
of pleasure, intemperance, sensuality, and
a course of irregular life, are inconsistent,
not only with the general character of a
good man, but also with the peculiar
exercises of charity and benevolence. For
nothing is more certain, than that habits
of licentious indulgence contribute to
stiffle all the good affections; to harden
the heart; to nourish that selfish attach∣ment
to our own vitious pleasures which
renders us insensible to the circumstan∣ces
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
and wants of others. A profligate
man is seldom found to be a good hus∣band,
a good father, or a beneficent
neighbour. How many young persons
have at first set out in the world with
excellent dispositions of heart; generous,
charitable, and humane; kind to their
friends, and amiable among all with
whom they had intercourse? And yet
how often have we seen all those fair
appearances unhappily blasted in the pro∣gress
of life, merely through the influ∣ence
of loose and corrupting pleasures;
and those very persons who promised
once to be blessings to the world, sunk
down, in the end, to be the burthen and
nuisance of society? The profusion of
expence which their pleasures occasion,
accounts in a great measure for the fatal
reverse that takes place in their charac∣ter.
It not only drains the sources
whence the streams of beneficence should
flow, but often obliges them to become
oppressive and cruel to those whom it was
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
their duty to have patronised and sup∣ported.</P>
<P>Purity of heart and conduct must there∣fore
be held fundamental to charity and
love, as well as to general piety and vir∣tue.
The licentious, I know, are ready
to imagine, that their occasional deeds
of bounty and liberality will atone for
many of their private disorders. But,
besides that such plans of compensation
for vices, by some supposed virtues, are
always fallacious, the licentious may be
assured, that it is an appearance only of
charity, not the reality of it, to which
they can lay claim. For that great vir∣tue
consists not in occasional actions of
humanity, in fits of kindness or compas∣ion,
to which bad men may be prompted
by natural instinct; but in the steady and
regular exercise of those good affections,
and the discharge of those important du∣ties
towards others, for which the licen∣tious
are in a great measure disqualified.
Their criminal propensities direct their
inclinations to very different objects and
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
pursuits; and often determine them to
sacrifice the just rights of others, some∣times
to sacrifice the peace and the re∣putation
of the innocent, to the gratifi∣cation
of their passions. Such is the per∣nicious
influence which the love of plea∣sure
has on the good qualities of its de∣voted
votaries. The impure heart is like
the stagnant and putrifying lake, which
sends forth its poisonous exhalations to
corrupt and wither every plant that grows
on its banks.</P>
<P>THE second qualification annexed to
Charity, in the text, is, that it be <HI>of a
good conscience.</HI> By this I understand the
Apostle to mean, that charity be in full
consistency with justice and integrity;
that the <HI>conscience</HI> of the man who pur∣poses
to perform actions of benevolence,
be free from the reproach of having ne∣glected
the primary duties of equity.
For, undoubtedly, justice is a virtue pri∣mary
to charity; that is, it must go be∣fore
it in all its exertions. One must first
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
<HI>do justly</HI> before he can pretend that he
<HI>loves mercy.</HI>—Religion, my friends, in or∣der
to render it useful to mankind, must
be brought down by its teachers from the
sublimity of speculation to the functions
and occupations of ordinary life. It is
my duty to admonish you, that you must,
in the first place, be fair in all your deal∣ings
with others; you must discharge the
debts you owe; you must pay the wages
due to your servants and dependents;
you must provide for your own family,
and be just to the claims of relations;
then, and then only, you can, <HI>from a good
conscience,</HI> as the text enjoins, perform
acts of generosity and mercy.</P>
<P>This leads to a reflection which here
deserves our attention; that, in order to
fulfil that <HI>charity which is the end of the
commandment,</HI> oeconomy, and good order
in private life, ought to be carefully stu∣died
by all Christians. This is more
closely connected with <HI>a good conscience,</HI>
than many seem inclined to admit. Oe∣conomy,
when prudently and temperate∣ly
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
conducted, is the safeguard of many
virtues; and is in a particular manner
favourable to the exertions of benevo∣lence.
He who by inconsiderate con∣duct
is injuring his circumstances, will
probably in time lose the inclination, and
certainly is depriving himself of the means,
of being serviceable to his brethren. Some
important exertions, indeed, there are
of charity, which have no connection
with giving or bestowing. Candour, for∣giveness,
gentleness, and sympathy, are
due to our brethren at all times, and in
every situation of our own fortune. The
poor have opportunities for displaying
these virtues, as well as the rich. They
who have nothing to give, can often afford
relief to others, by imparting what they
feel. But, as far as beneficence is in∣cluded
in charity, we ought always to
remember, that justice must, in the first
place, be held inviolably sacred.</P>
<P>The wisdom of scripture remarkably
appears, in the connexion pointed out
by the text between <HI>charity</HI> and <HI>good cons∣cience</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
or integrity; a connexion which I
apprehend is often not attended to so much
as it deserves. Among the frugal and in∣dustrious,
great regard is commonly paid
to justice. They will not defraud. They
will not take any unlawful advantage
in their dealings: And satisfied with this
degree of <HI>good conscience,</HI> they are stran∣gers
to that charity, which is the <HI>end
of the commandment.</HI> They are hard and
unfeeling. They are rigid and severe in
their demands. They know nothing of
humanity, forgiveness, or compassion.—Among
another class of men, who have
been more liberally educated, and who
are generally of a higher rank in life, jus∣tice
is apt to be considered as a virtue less
noble than charity; and which may, on
some occasions be dispensed with. They
are humane perhaps, and tender in their
feelings. They are easy to their depend∣ents.
They can be liberal, even to profu∣sion.
While, at the same time, they are
accumulating debts, which they know
themselves unable to discharge. Their
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
affairs are allowed to run into confusion.
Oeconomy and good order are neglected.
The innocent, in great numbers, suffer
materially through their mismanagement:
And all the while they assume to them∣selves
the praise of being generous and
good-hearted men. This surely is not that
<HI>charity</HI> which the Gospel enjoins; and
which, in its very essence, involves; <HI>good
conscience</HI> and integrity. He who pre∣tends
to do good to his brethren, without
first doing them justice, cannot be acount∣ed
their real friend. True charity is not
a meteor, which occasionally glares; but a
luminary, which, in its orderly and re∣gular
course, dispenses a benignant influ∣ence.</P>
<P>THE third and last adjunct connected in
the text with charity is, that it be <HI>of faith
unfeigned.</HI> Faith, in the scripture sense of
it, includes the whole of religious princi∣ples
respecting God, and respecting Christ.
Good principles, without good practice, I
confess, are nothing; they are of no avail
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
in the sight of God, nor in the estimation
of wise men. But practice not founded
on principle is likely to be always unsta∣ble
and wavering; and, therefore, the
faith of religious principles enters, for a
very considerable share, into the proper
discharge of the duties of charity.</P>
<P>It will be admitted that, without faith,
our duties towards God cannot be pro∣perly
performed. You may be assured
that your duties towards men will al∣ways
greatly suffer from the want of it.
Faith, where pure and genuine, supplies
to every part of virtue, and in particular
of the virtue of charity, many motives
and assistances, of which the unbelie∣ver
is destitute. He who acts from
faith acts upon the high principle of re∣gard
to the God who hath made him,
and to the Saviour who redeems him;
which will often stimulate him to his
duty when other principles of benevo∣lence
become faint and languid, or are
crossed by opposite interests. When he
considers himself as pursuing the appro∣bation
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
of that divine Being from whom
love descends, a sacred enthusiasm both
prompts, and consecrates, his charitable
dispositions. Regardless of men, or of
human recompence, he is carried along
by a higher impulse. He acts with the
spirit of a follower of the Son of God,
who not only has enjoined love, but has
enforced it by the example of laying
down his life for mankind. Whatever
he does in behalf of his fellow-creatures,
he considers himself as doing, in some de∣gree,
to that diving Person, who hath
said, <HI>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one
of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 40.</NOTE>. Hence charity is with
him not only a moral virtue, but a Chris∣tian
grace. It acquires additional dignity
and energy from being connected with
the heavenly state and the heavenly in∣habitants.
He mingles with beings of a
higher order, while he is discharging his
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
duty to his fellow-creatures on earth; and
by joining faith and piety to good works,
he completes the character of a Chris∣tian.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to explain
the full sense of that comprehensive view
of religion, which is given in the text.
I have shown in what respects <HI>charity</HI>
joined with <HI>the pure heart, the good con∣science,</HI>
and <HI>faith unfeigned,</HI> forms <HI>the end
of the commandment.</HI> Let us ever keep
in view those essentail parts of a virtuous
character, and preserve them in their
proper union. Thus shall our religion
rise into a regular and well-proportioned
edifice, where each part gives firmness
and support to another. If any one of
those material parts be wanting in the
structure; if, out of our system of cha∣rity,
either purity, or justice, or faith,
be left, there will be cracks an flaws
in the building which prepare its ruin.</P>
<P>This is indeed one of the greatest and
most frequent errors of men, in their
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
moral conduct. They take hold of vir∣tue
by pieces and corners only. Few
are odepraved as to be without all sense
of duty, and all regard to it. To some
moral qualities, which appear to them
amiable or estimable, almost all men lay
claim; and on these they rest their worth,
in their own estimation. But these scat∣tered
pieces of virtue, not uniting into
one whole, nor forming a consistent cha∣racter,
have no powerful influence on
their general habits of live. From various
unguarded quarters they lie open to
temptation. Their lives are full of con∣tradiction,
and perpetually fluctuate be∣tween
good and evil. Virtue can nei∣ther
rise to its native dignity, nor attain
its proper rewards, until all its chief parts
be joined together in our character, and
exert an equal authority in regulating our
conduct.</P>

<P>THE sun that rolls over our heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE>
the food that we receive, the rest
that we enjoy, daily admonish us of a
superior power, on whom the inhabitants
of the earth depend for light, life, and
subsistence. But as long as all things
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
proceed in their ordinary course; when
day returns after day with perfect simi∣larity;
when our life seems stationary,
and nothing occurs to warn us of any ap∣proaching
change, the religious senti∣ments
of dependence are apt to be for∣gotten.
The great revolutions of time,
when they come round in their stated
order, have a tendency to force some im∣pressions
of piety even on the most un∣thinking
minds. They both mark our
existence on earth to be advancing to∣wards
its close, and exhibit our condition
as continually changing; while each re∣turning
year brings along with it new e∣vents,
and at the same time carries us
forwards to the conclusion of all. We
cannot, on such occasions avoid perceiv∣ing,
that there is a Supreme Being who
holds in his hands the line of our existence,
and measures out to each of us our allot∣ted
portion of that line. Beyond a certain
limit, we know that it cannot be extend∣ed;
and long before it reach that limit it
may be cut asunder by an invisible hand,
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
which is stretched forth over all the inha∣bitants
of the world. Then naturally a∣rises
the ejaculation of the text, <HI>My times,
O God, are in thy hand.</HI> “My fate de∣pends

Let us consider what is implied
in <HI>our times being in the hand of God;</HI> and
to what improvement this meditation
leads.</P>
<P>THE text evidently implies, first, that
<HI>our times</HI> are not in our own hand; that,
as our continuance in life depends not
on ourselves, so the events which are
to happen, while life remains, are un∣known
to us, and not under our own
direction. Of this we may behold ma∣ny
a proof, when we look back on the transactions
of the year which is just fi∣nished.
Recollection will readily present
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
to us a busy period, filled up with a
mixture of business and amusement, of
anxieties and cares, of joys and sorrows.
We have talked, perhaps, and acted much.
We have formed many a plan; in pub∣lic
or in private life, we have been en∣gaged
in a varitey of pursuits. Let me
now ask, how small a proportion of all
that has happened could have been fore∣seen,
or foretold by us? How many
things have occurred, of which we had
no expectiation; some, perhaps, that have
succeeded beyond our hopes; many,
also, that have befallen us contrary to
our wish? How often were each of us ad∣monished
that there are secret wheels,
which, unseen by us, bring about the
revolutions of human affairs; and that,
while man was devising his way, Provi∣dence
was directing the event?</P>
<P>That scene is now closed. The tale of
that year had been told. We look for∣ward
to the year which is beginning;
and what do we behold there?—All, my
brethren, is a blank to our view: A dark
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
unknown presents itself. We are enter∣ing
on an untried, undiscovered coun∣try,
where, as each succeeding month
comes forward, new scenes may open;
new objects may engage our attention;
changes at home or abroad, in public or
in private affairs, may alter the whole
state of our fortune. New connections
may be at hand to be formed, or old
ones just about to be dissolved; perhaps,
we may have little more to do with this
world, or with any of its connections;
we may be standing on the verge of time
and life, and on the point of passing
into a new region of existence. In short,
the prospect before us is full of awful
uncertainty. Life and death, prosperity
and adversity, health and sickness, joy
and trouble, lie in one undistinguishable
mass, where our eye can descry nothing
through the obscurity that wraps them
up.</P>
<P>While it is thus certain that <HI>our times</HI>
are not at our own disposal, we are

in two views. Our times are in the hand
of God, as a supreme Disposer of events.
They are in the had of God as a Guar∣dian
and a Father.</P>
<P><HI>Our times,</HI> I say, <HI>are in the hand of
God</HI> as a supreme irresistible Ruler. All
that is to happen to us in this and the
succeeding years of our life,—if any suc∣ceeding
years we shall be allowed to see,—
has been foreknown and arranged by
God. The first view, under which hu∣man
affairs present themselves to us, is
that of confused and irregular succession.
The events of the world seem thrown
together by chance, like the billows of
the sea, tumbling and tossing over each
other, without rule or order. All that
is apparent to us is the fluctuation of hu∣man
caprice, and the operation of hu∣man
passions. We see the strife of am∣bition,
and the efforts of stratagem, la∣bouring
to accomplish their several pur∣poses
among the societies of men. But
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
it is no more than the surface, the out∣side
of things, that we behold. Higher
counsels, than it is in our power to trace,
are concerned in the transactions of the
world. If we believe in God at all, as
the Governor of the universe, we must
believe that without his providence, no∣thing
happens on earth. He over-rules,
at his pleasure, the passions of men. He
bends all their designs into subserviency
to his decree. <HI>He makes the wrath of man
to praise him;</HI> and <HI>restrains,</HI> in what mea∣sure
he thinks fit, <HI>the reminder of wrath</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. lxxvi. 10.</NOTE>.
He brings forth in their course all the
generations of men. When the time is
come for their entering into light, they
appear on the stage; and when the time
fixed for their dismission arrives, he <HI>chan∣ges
their countenance,</HI> and sends them a∣way.
The time of our appearing is now
come, after our ancestors had left their
place, and gone down to the dust. We
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
are at present permitted to act our part
freely, and without constraint. No vio∣lence
is done to our inclination or choice.
But assuredly there is not a day of our life,
nor an event in that day, but was foreseen
by God. That succession of occurrences,
which to us is full of obscurity and dark∣ness,
is all light and order in his view. He
sees from the beginning to the end; and
brings forward every thing that happens,
in its due time and place.</P>
<P><HI>Our times are</HI> altogether <HI>in his hand.</HI>
Let us take notice, that they are not in
the hands either of our enemies, or of our friends. It is not in the power of
man to shorten or to prolong our life,
more or less than God has decreed.
Enemies may employ craft or violence
in their attacks; friends may employ
skill and vigilance for the preserva∣tion
of our health and safety; but
both the one and the other can have
effect only as far as God permits. They
work in subserviency to his purpose. By
him they are held in invisible bonds.
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
To the exertions of all human agents
he says, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no
farther.</HI></P>
<P>WE are to observe next, that <HI>our times
are in the hand of God.</HI> not only as an
almighty disposer, but as a merciful
Guardian and Father. We are by no
means to imagine, that from race to race,
and from year to year, God sports with
the lives of succeeding generations of
men, or, in the mere wantonness of ar∣bitrary
power, brings them forth, and
sends them away. No; if we have any
confidence in what either the light of na∣ture
suggests to all men, or what the
revelation of the gospel had confirmed to
Christians, we have full ground to be∣lieve,
that the administration of human
affairs is conducted with infinite wisdom
and goodness. The counsels of the Al∣mighty
are indeed too deep for out limit∣ed
understandings to trace. <HI>His path</HI>
may often, as to us, <HI>be in the sea, and his
footsteps in the mighty waters;</HI> while, ne∣vertheless,
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
<HI>all his paths are mercy and
truth.</HI> He who, from the benignity of
his nature, erected this world for the a∣bode
of men; He who furnished it so
richly for our accommodation, and sto∣red
it with so much beauty for our en∣tertainment;
He who, since first we en∣tered
into life, hath followed us with such
a variety of mercies, surely can have no
pleasure in our disappointment and distress.
<HI>He knows our frame; he remem∣bers
we are dust;</HI> and looks to frail man,
we are assured, with <HI>such pity as a father
beareth to his children</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. ciii. 13, 14.</NOTE>. To him we may
safely commit ourselves, and all our con∣cerns;
as to one who is best qualified,
both to direct the incidents proper to
happen to us in this world, and to judge
of the time when it is fit for us to be re∣moved
from it.</P>
<P>Even that ignorance of our future ds∣tiny
in life, of which we sometimes
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
complain, is a signal proof of his good∣ness.
he hides from us the view of se∣curity,
because the view would be dan∣gerous
and overpowering. It would ei∣ther
dispirit us with visions of terror, or
intoxicate us by the disclosure of success.
The veil which covers from our sight
the events of this and of succeeding years,
is a veil woven by the hand of mercy.
Our <HI>times are in his hand;</HI> and we have
reason to be glad that in his hand they
are kept, hut out from our view. Sub∣mit
to his pleasure as an almighty Ruler
we must, because we cannot resist him.
Equal reason there is for trusting in him
as a Guardian, under whose disposal we
are safe.</P>
<P>SUCH is the import of the text, that
<HI>our times are in the hand of God.</HI> Our
times are unknown to us, and not under
our own direction. They are in the
hands of God as a Governor and Ruler;
in the hands of God as a Guardian and
Father. These separate views of the text
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
require, on our part, separate improve∣ments.</P>
<P>SEEING our times are not in our own
hand, seeing futurity is unknown to us,
let us, first, check the vain curiosity of pe∣netrating
into what is to come. Conjec∣ture
about futurity we often must,; but
upon all conjectures of what this year is
to produce, let us lay a proper restraint.
Let us wait till God shall bring forward
events in their proper course, without
wishing to discover what he has conceal∣ed;
lest, if the discovery were granted,
we should see many things, which we
would wish not to have seen.</P>
<P>The most common propensity of man∣kind
is to store futurity with whate∣ver
is agreeable to them; especially in
those periods of life when imagination is
lively, and hope is ardent. Looking for∣ward
to the year now beginning, they
are ready to promise themselves much
from the foundations of prosperity which
they have laid; from the friendships and
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
connections which they have secured;
from the plans of conduct which they have
formed. Alas! how deceitful do all these
dreams of happiness often prove! While
many are saying in secret to their hearts,
<HI>To-morrow shall be as this day and more a∣bundantly,</HI>
we are obliged in return to say
to them, <HI>Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for
thou knowest not what a day may bring
forth.</HI> I do not mean, that in the un∣known
prospect which lies before us, we
should forebode to ourselves nothing but
misfortunes.—May it be the pleasure of
heaven that this year run on in a placid
and tranquil tenor to us all!—But this
I say, that in such foresight of futurity
as we are allowed to take, we may rec∣kon
upon it as certain, that this year
shall prove to us, as many past have pro∣ved,
a checquered scene of some com∣forts
and some troubles. In what pro∣portion
one or other of these shall prevail
in it; whether, when it ends, it shall
leave with us the memory of joys or of
sorrows, is to be determined by him in
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
whose hands <HI>our times are.</HI> Our wisdom
is, to be prepared for whatever the
year is to bring; prepared to receive
comforts with thankfulness, troubles with
fortitude; and to improve both for the
great purposes of virtue and eternal life.</P>
<P>ANOTHER important instruction which
naturally arises from our times not be∣ing
in our own hands is, that we ought
no longer to rifle with what it is not in
our power to prolong; but that we should
make haste to live as wise men; not de∣laying
till tomorrow what may be done
today' <HI>doing now with all our night
whatever our hand findeth to do;</HI> before
that <HI>might cometh wherein no man can work.</HI></P>
<P>Amidst the uncertainty of the events
which are before us, there is one thing
we have too much reason to believe
namely, that of us who are now assem∣bled
in this congregation, and who have
seen the year begin, there are some who
shall not survive to see it close. Whe∣ther
it shall be you, or you, or I, who
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
shall be gathered to our fathers before
the revolving year has finished its round,
God alone knows. <HI>Our times are in his
hand?</HI> But to our place, it is more than
probable that some of us shall have gone.
Could we foretel the month, or the day,
on which our change was to happen,
how diligent would we be in setting our
house in order, and preparing ourselves
to appear before our Maker? Surely,
that ought to be prepared for with most
care, concerning which we are ignorant
how soon it is to take place. Let us
therefore <HI>walk circumspectly, and redeem
the time.</HI> Let us dismiss those trivial and
superfluous cares which burden or cor∣rupt
our life, in order to attend to what
is of highest importance to us as men and
Christians. The beginning of each year
should carry to us all a solemn admoni∣tion
of our folly, in neglecting to im∣prove
suitably the years that are past.
it should call up mispent time into our
view; and be like the hand coming forth
upon the wall, in the days of Belshaz∣zar,
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
and writing in legible characters o∣ver
against us, “O man! thy days are num∣bered;
thou art weighed in the balance,
and found wanting; take care lest they
kingdom be on the point of departing
from thee.”</P>
<P>WHEN we consider, in the next place,
that our times, as I before illustrated,
are in the hand of God as a sovereign
Disposer, it is an obvious inference from
this truth, that we should prepare our∣selves
to submit patiently to his pleasure,
both as to the events which are to fill up
our days, and as to the time of our con∣tinuing
in this world. To contend with
him we know to be fruitless. The word
that is gone out of his mouth must stand.
In the path which he has marked out
for us, whether it be short or long, rug∣ged
or smooth, we must walk. Is it not
then the dictate of wisdom, that we should
previously reconcile ourselves to this so∣vereign
ordination, and bring our minds
to harmonize with what is appointed to
be our destiny? let us fortify this tem∣per,
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
by recalling that reflexion of the
wise man; <HI>who knoweth what is food for
man in this life; all the days of his vain
life which be spendeth as a shadow?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vi. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>To enjoy long life, and see many days,
is the universal wish; and, as the wish
is prompted by nature, it cannot be in
itself unlawful. At the same time, several
circumstances concur to temper
the eagerness of this wish; and to show
us that it should always be formed un∣der
due submission to the wiser judge∣ment
of Heave. Who among us can
tell, whether, in wishing for the conti∣nuance
of many years on earth, we may
not be only wishing for a prolongation
of distress and misery?—You might live,
my friends, till you had undergone lin∣gering
rounds of servere pain, from which
death would have proved a seasonable
deliverance. You might live till your
breasts were pierced with many a wound
from public calamities or private sorrows.
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
You might live till you beheld the death
of all whom you had loved; till you sur∣vived
all those who love you; till you
were left as desolate strangers on earth,
in the midst of a new race, who neither
knew you, nor cared for you, but who
wished you, off the stage.—Of a nature so
ambiguous are all the prospects which life
sets before us, that in every wish we form
relating to them,. much reason we have
to be satisfied that our times are in the
hands of God, rather than our own.</P>
<P>THIS consideration is greatly strength∣ened
when, in the last place, we think of
God acting, not as a Sovereign only, but
as a Guardian, in the disposal of our
times. This is our great consolation in
looking forward to futurity. To God
as a wise Ruler, calm submission is due;
but it is more than submission that be∣longs
to him as a merciful Father; it is
the spirit of cordial and affectionate consent
to his will. Unknown to us as the times
to come are, it should be sufficient to our
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
full repose that they are known to God.
The day and the hour which are fixed
in his counsels for our dismission from
life, we ought to be persuaded are fixed
for the best; and that any longer we
should not wish to remain.</P>
<P>When we see that last hour drawing
nigh, though our spirit may be com∣posed
on our own account, yet, on ac∣count
of our friends and families, no
little anxiety and sorrow may be some∣times
apt to take possession of the mind.
Long we have enjoyed the comfort of
their society, and been accustomed to con∣sider
them as parts of ourselves. To be
parted from them forever is, at any rate,
a bitter thought; but to the bitterness of
this, is over and above added the aprrehen∣sion
of their suffering much by our death.
We leave many a relation, perhaps may
leave young children, and a helpless family.
behind us, to be exposed to various dan∣gers,
and thrown forth on an unfriendly
world. Such virtuous anxieties often
oppress the tender and feeling heart at
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
the closing periods of life.—My brethren,
look up to that God, in whose hands <HI>the
times</HI> of your fathers were; in whose
hand <HI>the times</HI> of your posterity shall
be. Recollect, for your comfort, the ex∣perience
of ages. When were the righ∣teous
utterly forsaken by God in times
past? Why should they be forsaken by
him in times to come? Well did he govern
the world before you had a being in it:
Well shall be continue to govern it after
you are no more. No cause have you, there∣fore,
to oppress your minds with the load
of unknown futurity. commit your
cares to a Father in heaven. Surrender
your life, your friends, and your family.
to that God, who hath said, <HI>The children
of his servants shall continue, and their seed
shall be established before him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cii. 2S</NOTE>.—<HI>Leave
thy fatherless children, I will preserve them
alive; and let they widows trust in me</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xlix. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus shown what the import
is, and what the improvement should be,
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
of the doctrine of the text, that <HI>our times
are in the hand of God.</HI> It asserts a fact,
the truth of which can be called in ques∣tion
by none; a fact which, whether
persons have any sentiments of religion
or not, is calculated to make a serious im∣pression
on every mind; especially at sea∣sons
when the revolution of years gives
us warning that our duration on earth
is measured, and advances towards its
period. to persons who are religiously
disposed, who study to improve life to
its proper purposes, to do their duty to∣wards
God and man, and through the
merits of their Redeemer to obtain grace
and favour from Heaven, the doctrine
of the text is still more important. A∣mong
them it tends to awaken impres∣sions
which are not only serious, but, as
I have shown, salutary and comforting
to the heart.—Thankful that our times
are in the hand of a Sovereign, who is
both wise and gracious, let us prepare
ourselves to meet the approaching events
of life with becoming resignation, and
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
at the same time with manly constancy
and firm trust of God. As long as it
shall please him to continue our abode
in the world, let us remain faithful to
our duty; and when it shall plaese him
to give the command for our removal
hence, let us utter only this voice: “In
thy hand, O my God, <HI>my times are.</HI>
Thou art calling me away. Here I
am, ready to obey thy call, and at thy
signal to go forth. I thank thee that
I have been admitted to partake so
long of the comforts of life, and to
be a spectator of the wisdom and good∣ness
displayed in thy works. I thank
thee that thou hast borne so long with
my infirmities and provocations; hast
allowed me to look up to thy promises
in the gospel, and to hear the words
of eternal life uttered by my great Re∣deemer.
With gratitude, faith, and
hope, I commit my soul to thee. <HI>Lord,
now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace; for mine eyes have seen thy sal∣vation.”</HI>
—Such are the sentiments with
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
which every pious and good man should
conclude his life. Such indeed are the
sentiments which he ought to carry
through every part of life. With these
may we begin, and with these conclude,
every succeeding year which God shall
think <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to add to our earthly existence!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON the Mixture of BAD MEN with the
GOOD in HUMAN SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTH. xiii. 30</BIBL>
<Q>Let both grow together until the harvest.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE parable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE> of which these words
are a part, contains a prophetical
description of the state of the church.
Our Lord predicts that the societies of
Christians were to be infected with per∣sons
of loose principles and bad disposi∣tions,
whom he likens to <HI>tares</HI>springing
up among <HI>wheat.</HI> He intimates that
there should arise some whose officious
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
zeal would prompt the desire of extermi∣nating
immediately all such evil men;
but that this were contrary to the de∣signs
of providence, and to the spirit of
Christianity; that a complete separation
was indeed to be made at last between
the good and the bad; but that this se∣paration
was to be delayed till the end
of the world, when, in the stile of the
parable, the <HI>tares</HI>should be entirely <HI>ga∣thered
out from among the wheat. Let
both grow together until the harvest.</HI></P>
<P>When we look around us nothing is
more conspicuous in the state of the
world, than that broad mixture of the
religious and the impious, the virtuous
and the wicked, which we find taking
place in every society. Strong objec∣tions
seem hence to arise against either
the wisdom or goodness of divine pro∣vidence;
especially when we behold bad
men not only tolerated in the world, but
occasionally exalted in their circumstan∣ces,
to the depression of the just. Why,
it will be said, if a Supreme Being exist,
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
and if his justice rule the universe, does
he allow such infamous persons as the
records of history often present, to have
a place, and even to make a figure in
his world? why sleeps the thunder idle
in his hand, when it could so easily blast
them? What shall we think of one who,
having the power of exterminating them
always at his command, permits them
to proceed without disturbance; nay,
sometimes appears to look on them with
complacency?—It becomes highly wor∣thy
of out attention to consider what an∣swer
can be made to these objections
to inquire whether any reasons can be
given that serve to justify this dispensa∣tion
of Providence, in allowing a mix∣ture
of bad men to continue on the face
of the earth until the end of time. This
inquiry shall make the subject of the
present discourse, together with such re∣flections
as naturally arise from survey∣ing
the state of human affairs.</P>
<P>BUT, before entering directly on such
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
inquiry, it may be proper to take no∣tice,
that, in our estimation of who are
the good, who are the bad, we are often
in hazard of committing mistakes. The
real characters of men are known only
to God. They frequently depend on the
secret and unseen parts of life. As in
judging of themselves men are always
partial, so in judging of others they of∣ten
err, through the imperfect informa∣tion
which they have gathered, or the
rash prejudices which they have formed.
They are too apt to limit the character
of virtue to those who agree with them
in sentiment and belief; and to exagge∣rate
the failings of those against whom they
have conceived dislike, into great and
unpardonable crimes. Were it left to
the indiscreet zeal of some to extirpate
from the earth all those whom they con∣sider
as bad men, there is ground to ap∣prehend
that, instead of tares the wheat
would often be rooted out.—At the same
time, we readily admit the fact, as too
manifest to be denied, that a multitude
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
of gross and notorious sinners are now
mixed with the followers of God and
virtue. Let us proceed then to consider
how far this is consistent with the jus∣tice
and wisdom of the Governor of the
world.</P>
<P>IT is a principle in which all serious
and reflecting persons have agreed, and
which by many arguments is confirmed,
that our present state on earth is designed
to be a state of discipline and improvement,
in order to fit human nature for a higher
and better state which it is to attain here∣after.
Now, this principle being once
admitted, we say, that the mixture of vir∣tue
and vice which here prevails, is cal∣culated
to answer this purpose better
than a more unmixed and perfect state
of society would have done.</P>
<P>FOR, in the first plcae, the crimes of
the wicked give occasion to the exercise
of many excellent dispositions of heart
among the righteous. They bring forth
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
all the suffering virtues, which otherwise
would have had no field; and by the
exercise of which the human character is
tried, and acquires some of its chief
honours. Were there no bad men in the
world to vex and distress the good, the
good might appear in the light of harm∣less
innocence; but could have no op∣portunity
of displaying fidelity, magna∣nimity,
patience, and fortitude. One half
of virtue, and not the least important
half, would be lost to the world. In
our present imperfect state, any virtue
which is never exercised is in hazard of
becoming extinct in the human breast.
If goodness constantly proceeded in a
smooth and flowery path; if, meeting
with no adversary to oppose it, it were
surrounded on every hand with acclama∣tion
and praise, is there no ground to
dread that it might be corrupted by va∣nity,
or might sink into indolence? This
dangerous calm must therefore be inter∣rupted.
The waters must be troubled,
lest they should stagnate and putrify.
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
When you behold wicked men multiply∣ing
in number, and increasing in power,
imagine not that Providence particularly
favours them. No; they are suffered for
a time to prosper, that they may fulfil
the high designs of heaven. They are
employed as instruments in the hand of
God for the improvement of his servants.
They are the rods with which he chas∣tens
the virtuous, in order to rouse them
from a dangerouss lumber; to form them
for the day of adversity, and to teach
them how to suffer honourably.</P>
<P>IN the next place, the mixture of the
bad among the good serves not only to
give exercise to the passive graces, but al∣so
to improve the active powers and vir∣tues
of man. IT inures the righteous to
vigilance and exertion. It obliges them
to stand forth, and act their part with
firmness and constancy in evil times. It
gives occasion for their virtues to shine
with conspicuous lustre; and makes them
appear as <HI>the lights of the world</HI> amidst
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
surrounding darkness. Were it not for
the dangers that arise from abounding
iniquity, there would be no opportunity
for courage to act, for wisdom to admo∣nish,
for caution to watch, nor for faith
to exert itself in <HI>overcoming the world.</HI> it
is that mixture of dispositions which now
takes place, that renders the theatre on
which we act so busy and stirring, and
so much fitted for giving employment to
every part of man's intelligent and moral
nature. It affords a complete field for the
genuine display of characters; and gives e∣very
man the opportunity to come forth
and show what he is. Were the tenor of
human conduct altogether regular and uni∣form,
interrupted by no follies and vices,
no cross dispositions and irregular pas∣sions,
many of our active powers would
find no exercise. Perhaps even our life
would languish, and become too still and
insipid. Man is not yet ripe for a para∣dise
of innocence, and for the enjoyment
of a perfect and faultless society. As in
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
the natural world, he is not made for
perpetual spring and cloudless skies, but
by the wintry storm must be called to ex∣ert
his abilities for procuring shelter and
defence; so in the moral world, the inter∣mixture
of bad men renders many an ex∣ertion
necessary, which in a more perfect
state of the world would find no place,
but which in the present state of trial is
proper and useful.—The existence of
vice in the world assuredly testifies our pre∣sent
corruption; and according to the de∣gree
of its prevalence, is always, more or
less, the source of misery. It is a stand∣ing
proof of the fall and degeneracy of
man. But as long as that fallen state
continues, the wisdom of Providence e∣minently
appears in making the errors
and frailties of the wicked subservient
to the improvement of the just. <HI>Tares</HI>
are for that reason suffered at present to
grow up <HI>among the wheat.</HI></P>
<P>THESE observations on the wisdom of
Providence in this dispensation will be
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
farther illustrated, by considering the use∣ful
instructions which we receive, or
which at least every wise man may re∣ceive,
from the follies and vices of those
among whom we are obliged to live.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> They furnish instruction con∣cerning
the snares and dangers against
which we ought to be most on our guard.
They put it thereby in our power to pro∣fit
by the errors and misconduct of o∣thers.
By observing from what small
beginnings the greatest crimes have a∣risen;
observing how bad company has
seduced this man from his original prin∣ciples
and habits; how a careless indul∣gence
of pleasure has blinded and in∣toxicated
that man; how the neglect of
divine institutions has, in another, gra∣dually
paved the way for open profliga∣cy;
much salutary instruction is con∣veyed
to the virtuous. Tracing the dan∣gerous
and slippery paths by which so
many have been insensibly betrayed in∣to
ruin, their views of human nature are
enlarged; the sense of their own imbe∣cility
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
is strongly impressed upon them;
accompanied with the conviction of the
necessity of a constant dependence on the
grace and assistance of heaven. All the
crimes which they behold disturbing so∣ciety
around them, serve as signals hung
out to them, beacons planted in their
view, to prevent their making shipwreck
among those rocks on which others have
split. It has been justly said, that not
only from the advices of his friends, but
from the reproaches of his enemies, a wise
man may draw instruction. In the same
manner, it is not only by the examples
of good men, but likewise by those of
the wicked, that an attentive mind may
be confirmed in virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> THESE examples of bad men,
while they admonish the virtuous of the
dangers against which they are to guard,
are farther porfitable by the views which
they exhibit of the evil and the defor∣mity
of sin. Its odious nature never ap∣pears
in so strong a light as when dis∣played
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
in the crimes of the wicked. It is
true that, when vice is carried only to a
certain degree, and disguised by plausible
colours, it may pass unreproved, and e∣ven
for a while seem popular in the
world. But it is no less true that, when
it becomes open and flagrant, and is de∣prived
of the shadow of virtue, it never
fails to incur general reproach, and, and to
become the object either of contempt or
of hatred. How often, for instance, have
the greatest abilities, which once drew e∣steem
and admiration, sunk, in a short
time, into the most humiliating degrada∣tion,
merely through the ascendant which
corrupted inclinations and low habits had
acquired over their possessor? How of∣ten
have the rising honours of the young
been blasted, by their forsaking the path
of honour on which they had once enter∣ed,
for the blind and crooked tracts of
depravity and folly? Such spectacles of
the infamy of vice, such memorials of
the disgrace attending it, are permitted
by Providence for general instruction;
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
and assuredly are edifying to the world.
It was necessary, for moral improvement,
that the beauty and excellence of virtue,
and the deformity of vice, should be
strongly impressed on every intelligent
mind. This could never be done with
so great advantage as by the striking con∣trasts
of both which are produced by the
living examples of evil men intermixed
with the good. It is in this mirror that
we clearly contemplate how much the
<HI>righteous is more excellent than his neigh∣bour.</HI></P>
<P>THE same purpose of important in∣struction
is farther promoted by the in∣stances
of misery which the state of wic∣ked
men on earth affords. I admit that
the worldly success, which sometimes at∣tends
them, may blind and seduce the
unwary; but a little more reflection ena∣bles
men to distinguish between apparent
success and real happiness. The condi∣tion
of worthless men, whatever splen∣dor
riches may throw around them, is
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
easily discerned to be a restless and mi∣serable
one; and the misery which they
suffer, to be derived from their vices. In
that great corrupted crowd which sur∣rounds
us, what incessant bustle and stir,
what agitation and tumult take place?
What envy and jealousy of one another?
How much bitterness of resentment do
we behold among them; mutually de∣ceiving
and deceived; supplanting and
supplanted; ever pursuing, but never sa∣tisfied?
These are not matters of rare ob∣servations,
or which require nice scrutiny
to discover them. We need only open
our eyes to behold the wicked tormented
by their passions, and far removed from
that sanctuary of calmness and tranquil∣lity
which is the abode of real happiness.
Nay, when we appeal to bad men them∣selves,
after they have run the whole
round of vicious pleasure, we will often
find them obliged to confess, that the
wretched result of their pursuits had been
<HI>vanity and vexation of spirit;</HI> and that the
happiest days they have enjoyed were in
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
the time of innocence; before criminal
desires and guilty passions had taken
possession of their breasts. such practi∣cal
demonstrations as these of the infe∣licity
of sin are yielded by the exam∣ples
of evil doers whom we see around
us. By attending to their situation, the
misery, as well as infamy of guilt is reali∣sed,
an rendered sensible to our appre∣hension.</P>
<P>THUS, upon a fair inquiry, you be∣hold
how the ways of God may, in this
remarkable case, be justified to man. You
behold what important ends are advan∣ced,
by permitting the <HI>tares</HI> at present
to <HI>grow together with the wheat.</HI> The
intermixture of evil men in human so∣ciety
serves to exercise the suffering gra∣ces
and virtues of the good; by the di∣versity
of characters among those with
whom they have intercourse, it serves to
bring forth and improve their active
powers and virtues, and to enlarge the
circle of useful occupations; it serves to
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
instruct them in the temptations against
which they are to guard, to reveal to
them all the deformity of vice, and to
make its miseries pass conspicuously be∣fore
their eyes. When we consider them
as actors on the theatre of the world, they
are thereby improved in the part they
have to perform. When we consider
them as spectators of what is passing
on that theatre, their minds are thereby
instructed; their views rectified and en∣larged
by the objects that are set before
them.</P>
<P>FROM these important truths,several
reflections no less important arise.</P>
<P>We are naturally taught, in the first
place, never to be hasty in finding fault
with any of the arrangements of Provi∣dence.
The present permission of moral
evil on the earth seemed, on the first
view, to furnish a strong objection against
either the wisdom or the goodness of
the Author of nature. After beholding
the useful purposes which are answered
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
by that permission, how cautious should
we be in advancing any of our rash spe∣culations
against his government and con∣duct!
To our confined and humble sta∣tion
it belongs not to censure, but to sub∣mit,
trust, and adore; satisfied that the
farther we inquire, the rectitude of his
ways will appear the more; thankful for
the discoveries of them which have been
imparted to us; and persuaded that, where
our discoveries fail, it is not because there
is no more wisdom or goodness to be seen,
but because our present condition allows
us not to see more.</P>
<P>IN the second place, let us be taught
with what eye we are to look upon those
bad men whom we find around us in the
world. Not surely with an eye of envy.
Whatever prosperity they may seem to
enjoy, they are still no more than <HI>tares,</HI>
the weeds of the field; contemptible in
the sight of God; tolerated by his pro∣vidence
for a while on account of the righ∣teous,
to whose improvement they are
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
rendered subservient. The parable in∣forms
us that, in the end, they are to be
<HI>gathered together and burnt.</HI> In this life
only they have <HI>their good things.</HI> But
their prosperity is transitory. <HI>They are
brought into desolation in a moment, and ut∣terly
consumed with terrors. As a dream
when one awaketh, so, O God, when thou
awakest, thou shalt despise their image</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. lxxiii. 19, 20.</NOTE>.—
When we consider their unhappy state, it
becomes us to behold them with the eye
of pity. Let us remember that, in the
midst of their errors, they are by nature
still our brethren. Let us not behave to
them in the spirit of bitterness. Insult
not their follies. Pride not yourselves
on superior virtue. Remember that, as
bad men are mixed with the good, so, in
the best men, vices are at present mixed
with virtues. Your own character, good
as you may esteem it, is not free from e∣very
evil taint; and in the characters of
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>
those whom you reprobate as vitious,
there are always some good qualities mix∣ed
with the bad ones. Study, as far as
you can, to reclaim and amend them;
and if, in any degree, you have been pro∣fited
by their failings, endeavour, in re∣turn,
to profit them, by good counsel and
advice; by advice, not administered with
officious zeal, or self-conceited superiority,
but with the tenderness of compassion
and real friendship.</P>
<P>In the third place, in whatever pro∣portion
the admixture of vice may seem
to take place in the world, let us never
despair of the prevalence of virtue on the
whole. Let us not exaggerate, beyond
measure, the quantity of vice that is found
in the mixture. It is proper to observe,
that in the parable now before us, after
the owner of the field had <HI>sown his good
seed,</HI> no reason is given us to think, that
the good seed was entirely chocked up by
<HI>tares.</HI> On the contrary, we are told that
<HI>the blade sprung up, and brought forth fruit;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
and, though the <HI>tares</HI> also arose, yet, in
the end there was a <HI>harveset,</HI> when the
<HI>wheat was reaped and gathered into the
barn.</HI> In the most corrupted times, God
never leaves himself without many wit∣nesses
on earth. He is always attentive
to the cause of goodness; and frequent∣ly
supports and advances it by means
which we are unable to trace. He nou∣rishes
much piety and virtue in hearts
that are unknown to us; and beholds re∣pentance
ready to spring up among ma∣ny
whom we consider as reprobates.—I
know that it has always been common
for persons to represent the age in which
they live as the worst that ever appeared;
and religion and virtue as just on the
point of vanishing from among men.
This is the language sometimes of the se∣rious;
often of the hypocritical, or of
the narrow-minded. But true religion
gives nosanction to such severe censures,
or such gloomy views. Though the <HI>tares</HI>
must be at all times springing up, there is
no reason for believing that they shall
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
ever overspread the whole field. The
nature of the weeds that spring up may
vary, according to the nature of the soil.
Different modes of iniquity may distin∣guish
different ages of the world; while
the sum of corruption is nearly the same.
Let not our judgements of men, and of
the times in which we live, be hasty and
presumptuous. Let us trust in the grace
of God; and hope the best of mankind.</P>
<P>IN the fourth and last place, let us keep
our eyes ever fixed on that important pe∣riod,
which is alluded to in the text, as
the conclusion of all. <HI>Let both grow to∣gether
until the harvest.</HI> The great spiri∣tual
year is to be closed by <HI>a harvest,</HI>
when <HI>the householder is to gather the wheat
into his barn;</HI> when, at the end of the
world, the final distinction of men and
characters is to take place. The confused
mixture of good and evil, which now pre∣vails,
is only a temporary dispensation of
Providence, accommodated to man's fal∣len
and imperfect state. Let it not tempt
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
us for a moment to distrust the reality of
the divine government; or to entertain
the remotest suspicion that moral good
and evil are to be on the same terms for∣ever.
The frailties of our nature fitted
us for no more at present than the enjoy∣ment
of a very mixed and imperfect s∣coiety.
But when our nature, purified and
refined, shall become ripe for higher ad∣vancement,
then shall the spirits of the
just, desengaged from any polluted mix∣ture,
undisturbed by sin or by sinners,
be united in one divine assembly, and re∣joice
forever in the presence of him who
made them. Looking forward to this glo∣rious
issue with stedfast faith, let no cross
appearances ever discomfit our hopes, or
lead us to suspect that we have been
serving God in vain. If we continue
<HI>faithful to the death,</HI> we may rest assured,
that in due time we shall <HI>receive the crown
of life.</HI></P>

<P>THE life of man on earth is doomed
to be clouded with various evils.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE>
Throughout all ranks, the afflicted form
a considerable proportion of the human
race; and even they who have a title to
be called prosperous, are always, in some
periods of their life, obliged to drink
from the cup of bitterness. The Chris∣tian
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>
religion is particularly entitled to our
regard, by accommodating itself with
great tenderness to this distressed condi∣tion
of mankind. It is not to be consi∣dered
as merely an authoritative system of
precepts. Important precepts it indeed
delivers for the wise and proper re∣gulation
of life. But the same voice
which enjoins our duty, utters the words
of consolation. The gospel deserves to
be held a dispensation of relief to man∣kind
under both the temporal and spiri∣tual
distresses of their state.</P>
<P>This amiable and compassionate spirit
of our religion conspicuously appears in
the character of its great Author. It
shone in all his actions while he lived on
earth. It breathed in all his discourses;
and, in the words of the text, is expressed
with much energy. In the preceding
verse, he had given a high account of his
own person and dignity. <HI>All things are
delivered unto me of my Father; and no
man knoweth the Son but the Father; nei∣ther
knoweth any man the Father,save
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
reveal him.</HI> But least any of his hearers
should be discouraged by this mysterious
representation of his greatness, he instant∣ly
tempers it with the most gracious be∣nignity;
declaring, in the text, the mer∣ciful
intention of his mission to the
world, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour,
and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.</HI></P>
<P>THE first thing which claims our at∣tention
in these words is, what we are to
understand by <HI>coming unto Christ.</HI> This
is a phrase which has often given occa∣sion
to controversy. By theological wri∣ters
it has been involved in much need∣less
mystery, while the meaning is in it∣self
plain and easy. The very metaphor
that is her used serves to explain it. In
the ancient world, disciples flocked round
their different teachers, and attended them
wherever they went; in order both to
testify their attachment, and to imbibe
more fully the doctrine of their masters.
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
<HI>Coming unto Christ,</HI> therefore, is the same
with resorting to him as our declared
Master; acknowledging ourselves his dis∣ciples,
believers in his doctrine, and fol∣lowers
of his precepts. As Christ is made
known to us under the character both of
a Teacher and a Saviour, our <HI>coming to
him</HI> imports not only submission to his
instructions, but confidence also in his
power to save. It imports that, forsaking
the corruptions of sin and the world, we
follow that course of virtue and obe∣dience
which he points out to us; rely∣ing
on his mediation for pardon of our
offences, and acceptance with heaven.
This is what is implied in the scripture
term <HI>Faith;</HI> which includes both the assent
of the understanding to the truth of
the Christian religion, and the concurrence
of the will in receiving it.</P>
<P>WHAT next occurs in the text to at∣tract
our notice is the description of those
to whom the invitation is addressed. All
those who <HI>labour and are heavy laden,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
that is, who, in one way or other, feel
themselves grieved and distressed, are
here invited to come to Christ.—Now,
from two sources chiefly our distresses a∣rise;
from moral, or from natural causes.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THEY may arise from inward
moral causes; from certain feelings and
reflexions of the mind, which occasion
uneasiness and pain. A course of sin
and vice always proves ruinous and de∣structive
in the issue. But its tendency
to ruin is often not perceived, while that
tendency is advancing. For as sin is the
reign of passion and pleasure, it forms
men to a thoughtless inconsiderate state.
Circumstances, however, may occur, and
frequently, in the course of life, do occur,
which disclose to a vicious man the ruin
which he is bringing on himself, as an
offender against the God who made him.
When some occasional confinement to so∣litude,
or some turn of adverse fortune,
directs his attention immediately upon
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
his own character; or when, drawing to∣wards
the close of life, his passions sub∣side,
his pleasures withdraw, and a future
state comes forward to his view; in such
situations it often happens, that the past
follies and crimes of such a man appear to
him in a light most odious and shocking;
and not odious only, but terrifying to his
heart. He considers that he is undoubt∣edly
placed under the government of a just
God, who did not send him into this world
for nought; that he has neglected the part
assigned to him; has contemned the laws
of heaven; has degraded his own nature;
and instead of being useful, having been
hurtful and pernicious to those among
whom he lived, is about to leave a detes∣table
memory behind him.—What ac∣count
shall he give of himself to his Ma∣ker?
Self condemned, polluted by so many
crimes, how can he expect to find mercy
in his sight?—Hence, an overwhelmed
and dejected mind; hence, dismal forebo∣dings
of punishment; hence, that <HI>wound∣ed
spirit,</HI> which, when it is deeply pierced,
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
becomes the sorest of all human evils,
and has sometimes rendered existence a
burden which could not be endured.</P>
<P>Such distresses as these, arising from
moral internal causes, may be made light
of by the giddy and the vain; and re∣presented
as confined to a few persons on∣ly
of distempered imagination. But to
those whose professions give them occasion
to see men under various circumstances
of affliction, they are known to be far
from being unfrequent in the world; and,
on many more occasions than is commonly
imagined, to throw over the human mind
the blackest gloom of which it is suscepti∣ble.
Religious feelings, be assured, have a
deep root in the nature of man. They form
a part of the human constitution. They
are interwoven with many of those fears
and hopes which actuate us in the chang∣ing
situations of fortune. During the gay
and active periods of life, they may be
smothered; but with most men, they are
smothered rather than totally obliterated:
And if any crisis of our condition shall a∣waken
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
and bring them forth, in their
full force, upon a conscious guilty heart,
woe to the man, who, in some discon∣solate
season, is doomed to suffer their
extreme vengeance!</P>
<P>BUT, while under such distresses of
the mind not a few may be said to <HI>la∣bour
and to be heavy laden,</HI> greater still is
the multitude of those who, from natural
external causes, from the calamities and
evils of life, undergo much suffering and
misery. The life of man is not indeed
wholly composed of misery. It admits
of many pleasing scenes. On the whole,
there is reason to believe that it affords
more joy than grief. At the same time,
the unfortunate, as I before observed,
form always a numerous class of man∣kind;
and it may be said with truth, that
<HI>sore travel is ordained for the sons of men.</HI>
Though the burden is not equally laid on
all; some there always are, on whom it
falls with oppressive weight.—Unexpect∣ed
disappointments have crushed their
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
hopes, and blasted the plans which they
had formed for comfort in the world.
The world had, perhaps, smiled upon
them once, only to give them a sharper
feeling of its miseries at the last. Strug∣gling
with poverty, unable to support
their families whom they see languishing
around them, they, at the same time, are
obliged by their situation in society to
conceal their necessities; and under the
forced appearance of cheerfulness, to hide
from the world a broken heart. They
are stung, perhaps, by the unkindness of
friends: cast off by those in whom they
had trusted; or torn by untimely death
from real friends, in connexion with
whom they might have flourished and
been happy; at the same time borne
down, it may be, with the infirmities of
a sickly body, and left to drag a painful
life without assistance or relief.—How
many sad scenes of this nature, on which
it were painful to insist, does the world
afford?</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="106"/>
When we turn to those who are ac∣counted
prosperous men, we shall always
find many sorrows mingled with their
pleasures; many hours of care and vexa∣tion,
wherein they acknowledge them∣selves
classed with those who <HI>labour and
are heavy laden.</HI> In entering into some
gay festive assembly, we behold affected
chearfulness displayed on every counte∣nance;
and might fancy that we had ar∣rived
at the temple of unmixed pleasure
and gladness of heart. Yet, even there,
could we look into the bosoms of these
apparently happy persons, how often
would we find them inwardly prey∣ed
upon by some tormenting suspicions,
some anxious fears, some secret griefs,
which either they dare not disclose to
the world, or from which, if disclosed,
they can look for no relief?—In short,
amidst that great company of pilgrims,
who are journeying through life, many
there are whose journey lies through a
valley of tears; and many to whom that
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
valley is only cheared by transient glimp∣ses
of joy.</P>
<P>To these classes of mankind is addres∣sed
the invitation of the text. To them,
it is in a particular manner adderssed;
overlooking the giddy and dissipated mul∣titude.
<HI>Come unto me all ye that labour,
and are heavy laden.</HI> Not as if our Sa∣viour
were always ready to accept that
sort of piety which is merely the conse∣quence
of distress; or made all those
welcome, who are driven by nothing but
fear or danger to have recourse to him.
His words are to be understood as inti∣mating,
that the heart which is humbled
and softened by affliction, is the object of
his compassionate regard; that he will
not reject us merely because we have been
cast off by the world; but that, if with
proper dispositions and sentiments we apply
to him in the evil day, we shall be sure of
meeting with a gracious reception. It now
remains to show, what that reception is
which we may look for; what that <HI>rest</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>
in which Christ hath promised to confer
on those who <HI>come to him;</HI> whether their
distress arise from moral or from natu∣ral
causes. <HI>Come unto me, and I will give
you rest.</HI></P>
<P>I. CHRIST affords rest to the disturb∣ed
mind that labours under apprehen∣sions
and fears of guilt. Let those who
suffer distress of this nature <HI>come to Christ,</HI>
that is, with contrition and repentance,
have recourse to him as their Saviour,
and they shall regain quietness and peace.
Foolish and guilty they have been, and
justly lie under dread of punishment; but
the penitent sorrow which they now feel,
implies their disposition to be changed. It
implies, as far as it is genuine, that, sensible
of their folly, they now desire to become
good and wise; and are determined for
the future to hold a virtuous course, could
they only hope to obtain pardon for the
past. In this situation of mind, let them
not be cast down and despair. Christ has
brought with him from heaven the olive
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
branch. He carries in his hand the sig∣nal
of forgiveness. The declaration which
he publicshes is, <HI>Let the wicked forsake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
and let him return to the Lord, and he
will have mercy upon him; and to our
God, for he will abundantly pardon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lv. 7.</NOTE>. In∣sufficient
though our own repentance
be, to procure pardon from heaven, we
are informed, that an all-sufficient atonc∣ment
has been made by Christ. Neither
the number nor the atrocity of offences
excludes, from forgiveness, the penitent
who returns to his duty. To all who
come under this description, the offer of
mercy extends, without exception. <HI>He
that spared not his own Son, but delivered
him up for us all, how shall be not with
him also freely give us all things</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>This discovery of divine government,
afforded by the Gospel, is perfectly cal∣culated
to scatter the gloom which had
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
overcast the desponding heart. The at∣mosphere
clears up on every side; and is
illuminated by chearing rays of celestial
mercy. Not only is hope given to the
penitent, but it is rendered sinful not to
indulge that hope. We are not only al∣lowed
and encouraged, but we are com∣manded
to trust in the divine clemency.
We are commanded to believe that <HI>none
who come unto Christ he will in any wise
cast our</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi. 37.</NOTE>. <HI>As I live, saith the Lord God,
I have no pleasure in the death of the wic∣ked,
but that the wicked turn from his way
and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil
ways; for why will ye die, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> house of Is∣rael</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</NOTE>—Such is the relief which the
religion of Christ brings to them who
<HI>labour and are heavy laden</HI> under the im∣pressions
of guilt and diving displeasure;
a relief which nothing can render ineffec∣tual
to the heart, except the most gloomy
supperstition, founded on gross misconcep∣tions
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
of the nature and attributes of God.
Let us now,</P>
<P>II. Consider what <HI>rest</HI> the religion of
Christ gives to them whose distress arises
not from inward and moral, but from
natural and external causes; from ad∣verse
fortune, or any of those numerous
calamities to which we are at present ex∣posed.
To such persons, it may seem
more difficult to promise any effectual
relief. In the former case, the distress
lay entirely in the mind. As soon as its
views are rectified, and its apprehensions
quieted, the evil is removed, and the cure
effected. Here, the distress arises from
without; and the religion of Christ af∣fects
not the course of external events.
But though it removes not all the evils
of life, though it promises no continuance
of undesturbed prosperity, (which indeed
it were not salutary for man always to
enjoy) yet, if it mitigates the evils which
necessarily belong to our state, and sup∣ports
us under them, it may justly be
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
said to give <HI>rest to them who labour and
are heavy laden.</HI> When much that is
material and important is effected, we
have no cause to complain, though all
that we desire be not acomplished.—In
this part of the discourse, I am to be con∣sidered
as adderssing myself not merely to
such as are at present suffering any severe
calamity. I now speak to many, who,
in the midst of health and affluence, en∣joy
the various comforts of life. But I
must desire such persons to look forward
to what may one day be their state. Let
them reflect how important it is to pre∣pare
themselves for the future unknown
vicissitudes of the world. For, <HI>if a man
live many years, and rej<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice in them all, yet
let him remember the days of darkenss, for
they shall be many</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. xi. 8.</NOTE>.—Now, either in the
prospect of future distress, or under pre∣sent
suffering. I say, that the religion of
Christ gives <HI>rest</HI> to the heart, by the for∣titude
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
which it inspires, and by the con∣solations
which it affords.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT inspires fortitude. It disco∣vers
a supreme administration, so friend∣ly
to the interests of goodness, as never
to allow the followers of Christ to dread,
that, in any situation of fortune, they
shall be neglected by Heaven. From the
abstract consideration of the divine per∣fections,
men had always some ground to
believe, that the general order of the uni∣verse
was consulted by its great Ruler.
But how far the interest of individuals
might be obliged to yield, or, in many ca∣ses
might be sacrificed, to this general or∣der,
they were left altogether in the dark.
Here the gospel of Christ comes to our
aid, by the explicit assurance which it
gives, that, in the great system of Provi∣dence,
the welfare of every single good
man is particularly included. <HI>All things,</HI>
we are expressly told, are made to <HI>work
together,</HI> not merely for the order and per∣fection
of the whole, but also <HI>for good to
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
them who love God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 28.</NOTE>. The life of every
person, who comes under this description,
forms a system complete within iteself;
where every event that happens to him
possesses its destined place, and forms a
link in that great chain of causes, which
was appointed, from the beginning of
things, for carrying on his improvement
and felicity. Such an arrangement of
the affairs of the world, may appear asto∣nishing
to our narrow capacities; yet
surely implies no effort beyond the reach
of infinite power, joined with infinite wis∣dom
and gooness.</P>
<P>Hence arises a degree of fortitude and
constancy to good men, which can upon
no other grounds be attained. Faith, in
these principles of the gospel, erects for
them a fortress, impregnable to the as∣saults
of the world, into which they can
at all times retreat. Sitting under the
shelter of divine protection, they calmly
<PB N="106" REF="115"/>
hear the storm, when it blows with its
utmost violence around them. <HI>The stoods
have lifted up their voice; they have lifted
up all their waves. But the Lord on high
is mightier than the noise of many waters;
yea, than the mighty waves of the sea</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xciii. 34.</NOTE>.
Of the man who possesses such principles,
it is justly said, <HI>His heart is established; he
shall not be afraid of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil tidings; his heart
is fixed, trusting in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxii. 7, 8.</NOTE>. Tranquil∣lity,
order, and magnanimity, dwell with
him; while all is confusion and trepida∣tion
among those, who have nothing to
look to but the apparent disorders of the
world.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of Christ not only arms us,
in this manner, with fortitude against the
approach of evil; but, supposing evils to fall
upon us with their heaviest pressure, it
lightens the load by many consolations to
which others are strangers. While bad men
<PB N="107" REF="116"/>
trace, in the calamities with which they
are visited, the hand of an offended so∣vereign,
Christians are taught to view
them as the well-intended chastisements
of a merciful Father. They hear amidst
them, that still voice which a good con∣science
brings to their ear: <HI>Fear not, for
I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am
thy God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xli. 10.</NOTE>. They apply to themselves
the comfortable promises with which the
gospel abounds. They discover in these
the happy issue decreed to their troubles;
and wait with patience till Providence
shall have accomplished its great and good
designs. In the mean time, devotion o∣pens
to them its blessed and holy sanctua∣ry:
That sanctuary in which the wound∣ed
heart is healed, and the weary mind
is at rest; where the cares of the world
are forgotten, where its tumults are hush∣ed,
and its miseries disappear; where
greater objects open to our view than
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
what the world presents; where a more
serene sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y shines, and a swe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter and
calmer light beams on the afflicted heart.
In those moments of devotion, a pious
man, pouring out his wants and sorrows
to an almighty Supporter, feels that he is
not left solitary and forsaken in a vale
of woe. God is with him; Christ and
the Holy Ghost are with him; and though
he should be bereaved of every earthly
friend, he can look up in heaven to a Friend
who will never die.</P>
<P>To these present consolations, the re∣ligion
of Christ adds the joyful prospect
of that future state, where eternal <HI>rest re∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth
for the people of God.</HI> This life
they are taught to consider as only the
<HI>house of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pilgrimage;</HI> the temporary
mansion of painful though necessary dis∣cipline.
But let them endure for a little,
and the pilgrimage shall end, the disci∣pline
shall be finished; and all the vir∣tuous
be assembled in those blissful re∣gions
which are prepared for their re∣ward.
Such a prospect chears the dark∣est
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
hours of life; and affords a remedy
to every trouble. <HI>The sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 18.</NOTE>.
They appear in this comparative view,
as no more than a distressing dream of
the night, from which one awakes into
health, and light, and joy.—Peculiar is
this high consolation to the religion of
Christ. It is what all nations had eager∣ly
wished for; what all philosophy had
anxiously sought to discover; but what
no research, no philosophy were able to
ascertain to mankind, till Christ brought
the assurance of life and immortality from
heaven; and conferred on his disciples
this noble and inestimable gift.</P>
<P>THUS, on the whole, the Christian doc∣trine
is found to be the great Medicine of
life. It is the balm of human sorrows and
cares. In our present state, where so ma∣ny
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
are suffering actual distress, of one kind
or other, and where all have reason to
dread the approach of distress, it is religion
only that can alleviate the burdens of life,
and smooth our passage through this evil
world.—Let this view of religion per∣suade
us to improve the sacred ordinance
of our Lord's supper for <HI>coming unto Christ,</HI>
in the way before explained: that is, join∣ing
ourselves to him as his disciples; his
disciples, not in words and professions on∣ly,
but in heart, and in truth; <HI>taking upon
us his yoke,</HI> as is added in the words imme∣diately
following the text; <HI>and learning of
him who is meek and lowly in heart.</HI> Let
those who labour under the sense of re∣membered
follies and crimes, <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me unto
Christ</HI> with penitent disoisitions, and they
shall obtain pardon. Let those who la∣bour
under the suffering of present, or
the apprehension of future sorrows, <HI>come
unto Christ,</HI> and they shall receive conso∣lation.
All who are in any sense <HI>heavy laden,</HI>
coming unto him, shall find <HI>rest</HI> to
their souls.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="120"/>
BEFORE concluding this discourse, there
is another set of men, not yet mentioned,
to whom I must also adderss the exhor∣tation
in the text; those I mean, who la∣bouring
under none of the distr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sfuls bur∣dens
of life, are surf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited of its pleaures;
who labour under the burden only of lan∣guid
case, and the load of insipid prosperi∣ty.
You drag, my friends, but a miserable
existence. Opressed by no sorrow, you
feel vacuity and dissatisfaction within;
you are often weary of life; and in your
solitary hours, are disposed to confess that
all you have experienced is vanity. Where∣fore
shouls you any longer <HI>spend your mo∣ney
for that which is not bread, and your la∣bour
for that which satisfieth not? Come
to the waters which are now offered to
you, and drink. Hear, and your sould shall
live.</HI> Retreat from the corrupting vani∣ties
of the world, to Christ, to religion,
and to virtue. New sources of enjoy∣ment
shall then be opened to you. A
world yet untried shall display itself to
your view. You shall be formed to a re∣lish
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>
for the quiet and innocent pleasures
of piety and devotion; of friendship, and
good affections; of useful knowledge, and
virtuous activity; of calm society, and
seasonable retirement; pleasures of which
at present you have no conception; but
which, upon trial, you shall find superior
to the trifling, or turbulent amusements,
in which you have hitherto passed your
days.—The true satifaction of the hu∣man
mind is only to be found in religion
and goodness; in a purified heart, and a
virtuous life. All other plans of happiness
are fallacious, and pregnant with
disappointment. It is only by <HI>acquainting
ourselves with God</HI> that we can <HI>find peace:</HI>
And those who are <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI>
now, shall be <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> to
the end, unless they come to him who on∣ly
can <HI>give them rest.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ISAIAH V. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe
and wine are in their feasts; but they re∣gard
not the work of the Lord, neither
consider the operation of his hands.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from many passages in the
writings of this prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> that in his
days great corruption of manners had be∣gun
to take place among the people of
Israel. Originally a sober and a religious
nation, accustomed to a simple and pas∣toral
life, after they had enlarged their
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>
territories by conquest, and acquired
wealth by commerce, they gradually con∣tracted
habits of luxury; and luxury
soon introduced its usual train of attend∣ing
evils. In the history of all nations,
the same circulation of manners has been
found; and the age in which we live re∣sembles,
in this respect, the ages which
have gone before it. Forms of iniquity
may vary; but the corrupt propensities
of men remain at all times much the
same; and revolutions from primitive
simplicity to the resinements of criminal
luxury have been often exhibited on the
stage of the world. The reproof direct∣ed
in the text to the Jews of that an∣tient
age, will be found equally appli∣cable
to the manners of many, in mo∣dern
times. In discoursing from it, I
shall first consider the character of those
who are described in the text, and show
the guilt that is involved in it. I shall
next consider the duties which persons
of that character are supposed to have
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
neglected; to <HI>regard the work of the Lord,
and to consider the operation of his hands.</HI></P>
<P>I. WHEN we take into view the cha∣racter
pointed at in the text, it is evident
that what the prophet means to reprove
is, the spirit of inconsiderate dissipation,
of intemperate indulgence, and irreligious
luxury. It is not <HI>the feast and the wine, the
harp and the viol,</HI> which he means to
condemn. Masic and wine are, in them∣selves,
things of innocent nature: Nay,
when temperately enjoyed, they may be
employed for useful purposes; for af∣fording
relaxation from the oppressive
cares of life, and for promoting friendly
intercourse among men. The opulent
are not prohibited from enjoying the
good things of this world, which Pro∣vidence
has bestowed upon them. Re∣ligion
neither abolishes the distinction of
ranks, (as the vain philosophy of some
would teach us to do), nor interferes
with a modest and decent indulgence of
pleasure.—It is the criminal abuse of
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
pleasure which is here censured; that
thoughtless and intemperate enjoyment
of it which wholly absorbs the time and
attention of men; which obliterates eve∣ry
serious thought of the proper business
of life; an effaces the sense of religion
and of God.</P>
<P>It may be proper to remark, that it is
not open and direct impiety, which is
laid to the charge of the persons here
characterised. It is not said, that in their
feasts they scosfed at religion, or blasphe∣med
the name of God. To this summit
of wickedness these persons had not yet
arrived; perhaps, the age in which they
lived gave not its countenance to this
wantonness of impiety. It is merely a
negative crime of which they are accu∣sed;
that they, <HI>regarded not the work of
the Lord, neither considered the operation of
his hands.</HI> But this absence of all religious
impressions is here pointed out, as suffi∣cient
to stigmatise their characters with
guilt. As soon as the sense of a Supreme
Being is lost, the great check is taken
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
off which keeps under restraint the pas∣sions
of men. Mean desires, and low
pleasures, take place of the greater and
nobler sentiments which reason and re∣ligion
inspire. Amidst the tumult of <HI>the
wine and the feast,</HI> all proper views of hu∣man
life are forgotten. The duties which,
as men, they have to perform, the part
they have to act in the world, and the
distresses to which they are exposing them∣selves,
are banished from their thoughts.
<HI>To-morrow shall be as this day, and more
abundantly,</HI> is the only voice. Inflamed
by society, and circulated from one loose
companion to another, the spirit of riot
grows and swells, till it end in brutal
excess.</P>
<P>Were such disorders rare and occasion∣al
merely, they might perhaps be for∣gotten
and forgiven. But, nourished by
repetition and habit, they grow up among
too many, to become the business and oc∣cupation
of life. By these unfortunate
votaries of pleasure, they are accounted
essential to happiness. Life appears to
<PB N="118" REF="127"/>
stagnate without them. Having no re∣source
within themselves, their spirits
sink, and their very being seems annihi∣lated,
till the return of their favourite
pleasures awaken within them some tran∣sient
sparkles of joy.—Idleness, ease, and
prosperity, have too natural a tendency
to generate the follies and vices now de∣scribed.
<HI>Because they have no changes,</HI>
said the Psalmist, <HI>therefore they fear not
God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. lv. 19.</NOTE>. They are the dark and solitary
hours of life, which recal men to recol∣lection
and wisdom. They show to the
unthinking what this world really is, and
what may be expected from it. But the
day that is always bright and unclouded,
is not made for men. It flatters them
with the dangerous illusion, that it is in
their power to render life one scene of
pleasure; and that they have no other
business on earth, but to spread the <HI>feast,</HI>
and call <HI>sthe harp and the</HI> viol to sound.
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
But the examples are so frequent, of the
dangers and the crimes which arise from an
intemperate abuse of pleasure, that on this
part of the subject it seems needless to in∣sist
any longer. I proceed, therefore,</P>
<P>II. To consider the duties which men
are accused of having neglected; and
which, it is here supposed, if duly at∣tended
to, would have acted as the cor∣rectives
of dissolute and irreligious lux∣ury;
these are, to <HI>regard the work of the
Lord,</HI> and to <HI>consider the operation of his
hands.</HI>—By recommending such duties, I
do not mean to represent it as requisite
that the feast should be turned into an
act of worship; that the countenances of
men should be always grave; or that,
in the hours of amusement and of social
festivity, no subject may employ their
thoughts and their discourse, except God
and a future state. All extremes in re∣ligion
are dangerous; and, by carrying
austerity too far, we are in hazard of
only promoting hypocrisy. But though
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
some, in the last age, might be prone to
this extreme; yet, at the present day,
there is not much occasion for warn∣ing
men against it.—What I now in∣sist
upon is, that all our pleasures ought
to be tempered with a serious sense of
God; that scenes of gaiety and enjoy∣ment
should never make us forget that
we are subjects of his government, and
have a part allotted as to act in his world;
that on no occasion they should be pro∣longed
so much, repeated so often, or suf∣fered
to transport us so far, as to lead us
to break any of the divine laws, or to act
inconsistently with the character of men
and Christians. A prevailing sense of
God on the mind is to be ever held the
surest guard of innocence and virtue, a∣midst
the allurements of pleasure. It is
the salutary mixture which must be in∣fused
into the cup of joy, in order to ren∣der
it safe and innoxious.</P>
<P>This sense of God should lead us, in
the language of the prophet, to <HI>regard the
work of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>consider the ope∣ration
<PB N="121" REF="130"/>
of his hands;</HI> which expressions may
be understood as requiring us to have
God upon our thoughts under two views;
<HI>to regard his work,</HI> as the Author of na∣ture;
and <HI>to consider the operation of his
hands,</HI> as the Governor of the world.
Let us attend more particularly to each
of these views of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>IN the first place, we are to view God
as the Author of nature, <HI>or to regard the
work of the Lord.</HI> With his works we
are in every place surrounded. We can
cast our eyes no where, without discern∣ing
the hand of Him who formed them,
if the grossness of our minds will only
allow us to behold Him. Let giddy and
thoughtless men turn aside a little from
the haunts of riot. Let them stand still,
and contemplate the wondrous works of
God; and make trial of the effect which
such contemplation would produce.—It
were good for them that, even indepen∣dently
of the Author, they were more
acquainted with his works; good for
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>
them, that from the societies of loose and
dissolute men, they would retreat to the
scenes of nature; would oftener dwell
among them, and enjoy their beauties.
This would form them to the relish of
uncorrupted, innocent pleasures; and
make them feel the value of calm enjoy∣ments,
as superior to the noise and tur∣bulence
of licentious gaiety. From the
harmony of nature, and of nature's
works, they would learn to hear sweeter
sounds than what arise from <HI>the viol, the
tab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, and the pipe.</HI></P>
<P>But to higher and more serious thoughts
these works of nature give occasion, when
considered in conjunction with the Creator
who made them.—Let me call on you,
my friends, to catch some interval of
reflection, some serious moment, for look∣ing
with thoughtful eye on the world a∣round
you. Lift your view to that im∣mense
arch of heaven which encompas∣ses
you above. Behold the sun in all
his splendor rolling over your head by
day; and the moon, by night, in mild
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>
and screne majesty, surrounded with that
host of stars which present to your ima∣gination
an innumerable multitude of
worlds. Listen to the awful voice of
thunder. Listen to the roar of the tem∣pest
and the ocean. Survey the wonders
that fill the earth which you inhabit.
Contemplate a steady and powerful Hand,
bringing round spring and summer, au∣tumn
and winter, in regular course; de∣corating
this earth with innumerable
beauties, diversifying it with innumerable
inhabitants; pouring forth comforts on
all that live; and, at the same time, over∣awing
the nations with the violence of
the elements, when it pleases the Creator
to let them forth.—After you have view∣ed
yourselves as surrounded with such a
scene of wonders; after you have beheld
on every hand, such an astonishing dis∣play
of majesty united with wisdom and
goodness; are you not seized with so∣lemn
and serious awe? Is there not some∣thing
which whispers you within, that to
this great Creator reverence and homage
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>
are due by all the rational beings whom
he has made? Admitted to be spectators of
his works, placed in the midst of so ma∣ny
great and interesting objects, can you
believe that you were brought hither for
no purpose; but to immerse yourselves in
gross and brutal, or, at best, in trifling
pleasures; lost to all sense of the wonders
you behold; lost to all reverence of that
God who gave you being, and who has
erected this amazing fabric of nature, on
which you look only with stupid and un∣meaning
eyes?—No: Let the scenes which
you behold prompt correspondent feel∣ings.
Let them awaken you from the
degrading intoxication of licentioussness,
into nobler emotions. Every object which
you view in nature, whether great or
small, serves to instruct you. The star
and the infect, the fiery meteor and the
flower of spring, the verdant field and the
lofty mountain, all exhibit a supreme
Power, before which you ought to trem∣ble
and adore; all preach the doctrine,
all inspire the spirit, of devotion, and reve∣rence.
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>
<HI>Regarding,</HI> then, <HI>the work of the
Lord,</HI> let rising emotions of awe and gra∣titude
call forth from your souls such
sentiments as these:—“ Lord, wherever
I am, and whatever I enjoy, may I ne∣ver
forget thee, as the Author of na∣ture!
May I never forget that I am
thy creature and thy subject! In this
magnificent temple of the universe,
where thou hast placed me, may I ever
be thy faithful worshipper; and may
the reverence and the fear of God be
the first sentiments of my heart! ”—It
is to such consideration of God I would
now recal your thoughts, from the <HI>wine
and the feast,</HI> as proper to check the spirit
of levity and folly; and to inspire manly
and becoming sentiments, in the place of
criminal dissipation. But,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, there is a conside∣ration
of a nature still more serious, to be
employed for the same purpose; the con∣sideration
of God as not only the Author
of nature, but the Governor of his crea∣tures.
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
While we <HI>regard the work of the
Lord,</HI> we are also to <HI>consider the</HI> never ceas∣ing
<HI>operation of his hands.</HI> We are to look
up to an awful and iresistible Providence,
stretching its arm over our head; di∣recting
the fate of men, and dispensing at
its pleasure happiness or misery. In the
giddy moments of jollity, the wantorn and
thoughtless are apt to say; “ <HI>Let us eat and
dring, for to-morrow we die.</HI> Nothing
is better for man, than to rejoice as
much as he can all the days of his vain
life; and to keep himself undisturbed
by supperstitious terrors. He who sit∣teth
in the heavens bestows no minute
attention on the sons of earth. He per∣mits
<HI>all things to come alike to all; one
event to happen to be</HI> righteous and to the
wicket. ”—Be assured, my brethren, it
is not so. You greatly deceive your∣selves,
by imagining that your Creator
and Governor is indifferent to the part
you are now acting; or that the distri∣bution
of good and evil, which now takes
<PB N="127" REF="136"/>
place, has no relation to your moral con∣duct.
In some instances, that relation
may not be apparent, because the moral
government of God is not completed in
this world. But a multitude of proofs
show government to be already begun;
and point out to you the train in which
you may expect it to proceed.</P>
<P>In the history of all ages and nations,
you cannot but have observed a thousand
instances, in which <HI>the operation of the divine
hand</HI> has been displayed; overtaking evil
doers sooner or later with punishment, and
bringing on their own heads the ruin they
had devised for others. You are not to i∣magine
that this displeasure of Providence
is exerted only aginst the ambitious, the
treacherous, and the cruel, who are the au∣thors
of extensive misery to the world. Un∣der
this idea, perhaps, you may be desirous
to shelter yourselves, that your excesses are
of a harmless kind; that you seek nothing
more than the enjoyment of your own plea∣ures;
that your <HI>feast</HI> and your <HI>wine</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
interfere not with the order of the world;
and that therefore you have done nothing
which should awaken the sleeping thun∣der,
and bring it down from heaven on
you heads. Though not stained with
the blackest colours of guilt, your con∣duct
may nevertheless be highly offen∣sive
to the Ruler of the world. His go∣vernment
is not of that indolent inatten∣tive
kind, which allows impunity to eve∣ry
lesser criminal. He beholds with dis∣pleasure
the behaviour of those who de∣grade
their nature by vitious disorders;
and contaminate, by their example, every
society with which they are connected.
His measures are taken, that in one way
or other, they shall suffer.</P>
<P>Look around the circle of your ac∣quaintance,
and observe, whether they
are not the sober, the industrious, and the
virtuous, who visibly prosper in the world,
and rise into reputation and influence; ob∣serve
whether the licentious and intem∣perate
are not constantly humbled and
<PB N="129" REF="138"/>
checked by some dark reverse either in
their health or their fortune; whether
the irreligious and profligate are ever
suffered to escape long, without being
marked with infamy, and becoming ob∣jects
of contempt.—I ask, to what cause
this is to be ascribed, but to that <HI>opera∣tion
of the hand of God,</HI> which I am now
calling you to consider? Does it not obvi∣ously
carry the marks of a plan, a system
of things, contrived and fore-ordained by
Providence, for rewarding virtue, and pu∣nishing
vice in every form of its disor∣ders?—The
Governor of the world need
not for this purpose step from this throne,
or put forth his hand from the coluds.
With admirable wisdom he hath so or∣dered
the train of human affairs, that, in
their natural course, mens <HI>own wickedness
shall reprove them, and their backs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dings
correct them; that they shall be made to eat
the fruit of their doings, and to fall into the
pit which themselves bad digged.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="139"/>
These things have been always so ap∣parent
to observation, that though a man
may have been seduced into irregular
and evil courses during his life, yet, at
the close of it, it seldom happens but he
discerns their pernicious nature, and con∣demns
himself for them. Never, per∣haps,
was there a father, who, after he
had spend his days in idleness, dissipation,
and luxury, did not, when dying, admo∣nish
the children whom he loved, to hold
a more honourable course, to follow the
paths of virtue, to fear God, and to fulfil
properly the duties of their station.—To
yourselves, indeed, I can confidently ap∣peal,
whether what I am now saying, be
not confirmed by your own testimony.
After you have been guilty of some cri∣minal
acts, in the course of those riotous
pleasures which you indulge, have you
not, at certain times, felt the stings of
remorse? Were you not obliged to con∣fess
to yourselves that a sad prospect of
misery was opening before you, if such
excesses were to continue? Did you not
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>
hear an inward voice upbraiding you for
having sunk and degraded your charac∣ter
so far below that of many of your
equals around you?—My friends, what
was this but the voice of God, speaking,
as the Governor of his creatures, within
your heart; testifying loudly that your
course of life was displeasing to him;
and warning you of punishments that
were to follow? If his displeasure against
you is already begun to be testified, can
you tell where it is to stop, or how long it
may continue to pursue you throughtout
future stages of your existence? <HI>Who
knoweth the power of his wrath?</HI>—To
this awful, this warning voice, will you
not be persuaded reverently to listen? Im∣pressed
by the dread authority which it
carries, shall you not fall down on your
knees before your Maker, imploring his
mercy to pardon your past offences, and
his grace to rectify your future way?</P>
<P>SUCH ought to be the effects of the
consideration of God as the Governor of
<PB N="132" REF="141"/>
the world. It leads to thoughts of a ve∣ry
serious nature. When we <HI>regard the
work of the Lord,</HI> and contemplate him
as the Author of the universe, such con∣templation
prompts devotion. But when
we <HI>consider the operation of his hands</HI> in
providence, and contemplate him as the
Governor of mankind, such contempla∣tion
prompts humiliation before him for
offences committed. The former ad∣dresses
itself to the ingenuous sentiments
that are left in the heart; and awakens a
sense of our unworthiness, in neglecting
the Author of nature, amidst our riotous
pleasures. The latter addersses itself to
our regard for safety and happiness; and
awakens fear and dread, from conscious∣ness
of the guilt we have contracted.
Hence springs up in every thoughtful
mind, an anxious concern to avert the
displeasure, and regain the favour of that
Supreme Being to whom we are all
subject. This, among unenlightened na∣tions,
gave rise to sacrifices, expiations,
and all the rites of humble, though supper∣stitious
<PB N="133" REF="142"/>
worship. Among nations, who
have been instructed in true religion, sen∣timents
of the same nature pave the way
for prayer, repentance, faith, and all those
duties, by means of which we may hope,
through a divine Mediator and Interces∣sor,
to be reconciled to heaven. Natural
and revealed religion here appear in con∣cord.
We behold the original dictates of
the human heart laying a foundation for
the glad reception of the comfortable tid∣ings
of the gospel.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus endeavoured to show in
what manner, by <HI>regarding the work of the
Lord, and considering the operation of his
hands,</HI> we may prevent the dangers aris∣ing
from a thoughtless indulgence of
pleasure; we may be furnished with an
antidote to the poison which is too often
mixed in that intoxicating cup.—Human
life is full of troubles. We are all tempt∣ed
to alleviate them as much as we can,
by freely enjoying the pleasurable mo∣ments
which Providence thinks fit to al∣low
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>
low us. Enjoy them we may: But, if
we would enjoy them safely, and enjoy
them long, let us temper them with the
fear of God. As soon as this is forgotten
and obliterated, the sound of <HI>the harp
and the viol</HI> is changed into the signal of
death. The serpent comes forth from
the roses where it had lain in ambush,
and gives the fatal sting. Pleasure in
moderation is the cordial, in excess it is
the bane, of life.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apostle Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM VII.</NOTE> in a discourse
which he held to the Jews, ap∣plies
this passage, in a mystical and pro∣phetical
sense, to the Messiah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 25.—28.</NOTE>. But, in
its literal and primitive meaning, it ex∣presses
the exalted hopes by which the
<PB N="136" REF="145"/>
Psalmist David supported himself amidst
the changes and revolutions, of which
his life was full. By these hopes, when
flying before Saul, when driven from his
throne, and persecuted by an unnatural
son, he was enabled to preserve his vir∣tue,
and to maintain unshaken trust in
God.—In that early age of the world,
those explicit discoveries of a state of im∣mortality,
which we enjoy, had not yet
been given to mankind. But though
the <HI>Sun of righteoussness</HI> was not arisen, the
dawn had appeared to that glorious day
which he was to introduce. Even in
those antient times, holy men, as the a∣postle
writes to the Hebrews, <HI>saw the
promises afar off, and were persuaded of them
and embraced them; and consessing that they
were strangers and pilgrims on earth, de∣clared
that they sought after a better coun∣try,
that it is an heavenly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 13.—16.</NOTE>. Indeed, in eve∣ry
age, God permitted such hopes to af∣ford
support and consolation to those
<PB N="137" REF="146"/>
who served him. The full effect of them
we behold in those triumphant expres∣sions
of the text, which are to be the sub∣ject
of this discourse. They lead us to
consider; first, The hope of the Psalmist
in his present state; <HI>Thou wild shew me
the path of life.</HI> And, secondly, the ter∣mination
of his hope in that future state,
where <HI>in the presence of God is fulness of
joy, and at his right hand there are plea∣sures
for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of life.</HI>
This plainly imports that there are dif∣ferent
<HI>paths</HI> or courses of conduct, which
may be pursued by men in this world;
a path which leads to lise or happines<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and a path which issues in death or de∣struction.
These opposite lines of con∣duct
are determined by the choice which
men make of virtue or of vice; and hence
men are divided into two great classes,
according as their inclinations lead them
to good or to evil. <HI>The path of life</HI> is of∣ten
a rough and difficult path, followed
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>
only by a few. The opposite one is the
broad way, in which the multitude walk;
seemingly smooth, and strewed with flow∣ers;
but leading in the end to death and
misery. <HI>The path of life</HI> conducts us up a
steep ascent. The palace of virtue has, in
all ages, been represented as placed on the
summit of a hill; in the ascent of which
labour is requisite, and difficulties are to
be surmounted; and where a conductor
is needed, to direct our way, and to aid
our steps.</P>
<P>Now, the hope which good men en∣tertian
is, that this <HI>path of life</HI> shall be
shewn them by God; that, when their
intentions are upright, God will both in∣struct
them concerning the road which
leads to true happiness, and will assist
them to pursue it successfully. Among
nations where any suitable ideas of God
or of virtue began to be formed, hopes
of this nature also began to be entertain∣ed.
It was consonant to the nature of
man, to think that the Supreme Being
was favourable to virtue. Accordingly,
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
in the writings of some of the ancient phi∣losophers,
we find various obscure traces
of this belief, that there was a benign hea∣venly
spirit, who illuminated the minds
of the virtuous, and assisted their endea∣vours
to obtain wisdom and happiness.
They even asserted, that no man became
great or good without some inspiration of
heaven.</P>
<P>But what they indistinctly conceived,
and could not with confidence rely upon,
the doctrine of Christianity hath clearly
explained and fully confirmed; express∣ly
and frequently teaching that, not only
by the external discoveries of revelation,
but by the inward operations of his Spi∣rit,
he <HI>shows</HI> to the humble and virtu∣ous
the <HI>path of life.</HI> While, by his word,
he instructs them in their duty, by
the influence of his grace he assists them
in the performance of it. In all revela∣tion
there is certainly no doctrine more
comfortable than this. It is to good men
a noble and pleasing thought, that they
are pursuing a path which God has dis∣covered
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
covered and pointed out to them. For
they know that every path, in which he
is their conductor, must be honourable,
must be safe, must bring them in the end
to felicity. They follow that <HI>Shepherd
of Israel,</HI> who always leads his shock into
<HI>green pastures, and makes them lie down be∣side
the still waters.</HI> At the same time,
they know that, if there be truth in re∣ligion
at all, on this principle they may
securely rest, that the Divine Being will
never desert those who are endeavouring
to follow out, as they can, the path which
he has shewn them. He beholds them
here in a state of great imbecility; sur∣rounded
with much darkenss; exposed to
numberless dangers, from the temptations
that assault them without, and the seduc∣tion
of misguided and disorderly passions
within. In this situation, can they ever
suspect that the Father of mercies will
leave his servants, alone and unbefriended,
to struggle up the hill of virtue, without
stretching forth a compassionate arm to aid
their frailty, and to guide them through
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>
the bewildering paths of life? Where were
then the <HI>God of love?</HI> Where, those insi∣nite
compassions of his nature, in which
all his worshippers have been encouraged
to trust?—No: He will <HI>send forth his
light and his truth to bring them to his holy
hill.</HI> For <HI>the righteous Lord loveth right∣eousness,
and his countenance beholdeth the
upright.</HI> With him there is no oblique
purpose, to turn him aside, from favouring
the cause of goodness. No undertaking
to which he has given his countenance
shall prove abortive. No promise that he
has made shall be allowed to fail. Whom
he loveth, he loveth to the end. The secret
of the Lord is with them that fear him, and
he will shew them his covenant. The meek
will be guide in judgement, and them will
be teach his way. His grace shall be suf∣ficient
for them, and his strength be made
perfect in their weakenss. They go from
strength to strength; every one of them ap∣peareth
before God in Zion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxv. 14, 9. 2 Cor. xii. 9. Psal. lxxxiv. 7.</NOTE>—Such are
the
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>
the hopes with which good men in a pre∣sent
life set forth on a course of piety and
virtue. <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of
life.</HI> Le us now proceed,</P>
<P>II. To consider the termination of these
hopes in a future state. <HI>In thy presence is
fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
pleasures for evermore.</HI> All happiness af∣suredly
dwells with God. The <HI>fountain
of life</HI> is justly said to be <HI>with him.</HI> That
supreme and independent Being must ne∣cessarily
possess within himself every prin∣ciple
of beatitude; and no cause from
without can possibly affect his untroubled
felicity. Among created dependent be∣ings,
happiness flows in scattered and fee∣ble
streams; streams that are often tinged
with the blackenss of misery. But from
before the throne of God issues the river
of life, full, unmixed, and pure; and the
pleasures which now in scanty portions
we are permitted to taste, are all derived
from that source. Whatever gladdens
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
the hearts of men or angels, with any real
and satisfactory joy, comes from heaven.
It is a portion of the <HI>pure influence flow∣ing
from the glory of the Almighty;</HI> a ray
<HI>issuing from the brightness of the everlasting
life.</HI> It is manifest, therefore, that every
approach to God must be an approach to
felicity. The enjoyment of his imme∣diate
presence must be the consumma∣tion
of felicity; and it is to this presence
that the Psalmist here expresses his hope
that the <HI>path of life</HI> was to conduct him.</P>
<P>The whole of what is implied in ar∣riving
at the presence of the Divinity, we
cannot expect to comprehend. Such ex∣pressions
as these of scripture, <HI>beholding
the face of God; being made glad with the
light of his countenance, and satisfied with
his likeness; seeing light in his light; seeing
no longer darkly as through a glass, but face
to face; seeing him as he is;</HI> are expressions
altogether mysterious, conveying sublime
though obscure ideas of the most perfect
happiness and highest exaltation of human
nature. This we know, that the absence
<PB N="144" REF="153"/>
of God, the distance at which we are now
placed from any communication with our
Creator, is one great source of our infeli∣city.
Faith exerts its endeavours, but of∣ten
ineffectually, to raise our souls to him.
He is a <HI>God that hideth himself.</HI> His ways
seem intricate and
perplexed. We fre∣quently
cannot reconcile them to the con∣ceptions
which we had formed of his na∣ture;
and with many a suspicion and
doubt they perplex the inquiring mind.
His works we survey with astonishment.
We wonder and adore. But while we
clearly trace the footsteps of their great
Author, his presence we can never dis∣cern.
<HI>We go forward, but he is not there;
and backward, but we cannot perceive him:
on the left hand, where he worketh, but we
cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the
right hand, that we cannot see him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. Hence
amidst the various sorrows and discou∣ragements
of the present state, that excla∣mation
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>
of Job's is often drawn forth from
the pious heart, <HI>O that I knew where I
might find him, that I might come even to his
seat</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 3.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>Surrounded by such distressing obscu∣rity,
no hope more transporting can be
opened to a good man, than that a period
is to come, when he shall be allowed to
draw nearer to the Author of his exist∣ence,
and to enjoy the sense of his presence.
In order to convey some faint idea of that
future bliss, by such an image as we can
now employ, let the image be taken from
the most glorious representative of the Su∣preme
Being, with which we are acquaint∣ed
in this world, the Sun in the heavens. As
that resplendent luminary chears and re∣vives
the universe, when, after the dark∣ness
of a tempestuous night, it comes
forth in the morning with its brightest
lustre, and inspires every heart with glad∣ness;
as ascending gradually through the
heavens, it converts that whole vast ex∣tent,
<PB N="146" REF="155"/>
over which its beams are diffused,
into a region of light; and thus changes
entirely the state of objects, by arraying
all nature in beauty, and transforming it
into the image of its own brightness:—Some
such change as this, though in a de∣gree
infinitely superior, we may conceive
the revelation of the Divine I resence to
produce upon the human soul. <HI>I will
behold thy face in righteoussness; I shall be
satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness:</HI>—But
without endeavouring farther to un∣fold
mysteries which we cannot explore,
there are two sublime and expressive views
of the Divine Essence given us in scrip∣ture,
on which it may be edifying that
our thoughts should rest for a little, in or∣der
to aid our conceptions of the blessed∣ness
of good men hereafter, in the pre∣sence
of God. It is said, <HI>God is light</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>God is love</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8.</NOTE>. Let us consider what <HI>sul∣ness
of joy</HI> must arise from such mani∣festations
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
festations of the Divine Essence to the bles∣sed.</P>
<P><HI>God is light.</HI> The revelation of his pre∣sence,
infers of course, a complete diffu∣sion
of light and knowledge among all
who partake of that presence. This un∣questionably
forms a primary ingredient
of happiness. Ignorance, or the want of
light, is the source of all our present mis∣conduct,
and all our misfortunes. The heart
of man is dark; and in the dark∣ness
of his heart is the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of his corrup∣tion.
He is unable to discern what is
truly good. Perpetually employed in
search of happiness, he is perpetually mis∣led
by false appearances of it. The er∣rors
of his understanding impose upon
his passions; and, in consequence of the
wrong direction which his passions take,
he is betrayed into a thousand disorders.
Hence sensuality, covetousness, and all the
violent contests with others about trifles,
which occasion so much misery, and so
many crimes in the world. <HI>He feedeth of
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him
aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say,
Is there not a lie in my right hand</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xliv. 20.</NOTE>?—Once
open to him the perfect sources of
knowledge and truth; suppose him pla∣ced
in the presence of that God who is
<HI>Light;</HI> suppose him illuminated by light
derived immediately from the Supreme
Being; presently all his former errors
would fla away, as mists are dispelled by
the rising sun. His whole nature would
be changed and reformed. The prejudices
which obscured his understanding would
be removed. The seductions of his passions
would disappear. Rectitude and virtue,
having nothing now to obstruct their en∣trance,
would take entire possession of his
heart. Angels are happier than men, be∣cause
they enjoy more enlarged knowledge
and views; because they labour under none
of our unhappy deceptions; but see the
truth as it is in itself; see it, as it is in
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>
God. Sharing the same light, which il∣luminates
them, good men in a future
state will share in their felicity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the light that flows from the
presence of Him who is the original
source of light not only banishes miseries
which were the effects of former darkness,
but also confers the most exquisite enjoy∣ment.
The knowledge afforded us at
present serves to supply our most pressing
wants; but it does no more. It is al∣ways
imperfect and unsatisfactory; nay,
much painful anxiety it often leaves. Nar∣row
is the sphere within which the mind
can see at all; and even there it can see
only <HI>darkly as through a glass.</HI> But when
it shall be enlarged beyond this dusky
territory, let loose from his earthly pri∣son,
and in <HI>God's light</HI> permitted to <HI>see
light,</HI> the most magnificent and glorious
spectacles must open to the view of the
purified spirit. What must it be to be∣hold
the whole stupendous scene of na∣ture
unveiled, and its hidden mysteries
disclosed! To trace the wise and just go∣vernment
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
of the Almighty, through all
those intricacies which had so long per∣plexed
us! To behold his hand conduct∣ing
ten thousand worlds, which are now
unknown to us; and throughout all the
regions of boundless space, to view wis∣dom
and goodness perpetually acting, and
diversifying its operations in forms of
endless variety! Well may such discove∣ries
inspire that song of the blessed, which
the apostle John heard <HI>as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder∣ings,
saying, Alleluiah! For the Lord God
omnipotent reigneth. Great and marvellous
are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just
and true are thy ways, thou King of saints</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xix. 6. xv. 3.</NOTE>!
As <HI>God is Light,</HI> so also it is said in scrip∣ture,</P>
<P><HI>God is Love.</HI> His presence must of
course diffuse love, among all who are per∣mitted
to dwell in it. <HI>He that loveth
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
not, knoweth not God. He that dwelleth
in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8, 16.</NOTE>.
Were man a single, solitary being, the
full enjoyment of light might suffice for
his happiness; as the perfection of know∣ledge
would rectify and improve to the
highest all his faculties. But, both here
and hereafter, he is connected with other
beings. Heaven implies a society; and
the felicity of that society is constituted
by the perfection of love and goodness,
flowing from the presence of the God of
love.</P>
<P>Hence follows the entire purification of
human nature from all those malevolent
passions, which have so long rendered our
abode on earth the abode of misery. We
greatly deceive ourselves, when we charge
our chief distresses merely to the account
of our external condition in the world.
From the disadvantages attending it, I ad∣mit,
that we may often have been exposed
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
to suffer. We may have met with dis∣appointments
in our pursuits. By the
arrows of misfortune we may have
been wounded. Under infirmities of
body we may have languished. But on
this we may depend, that the worst evils
of our present condition arise from the
want of goodness and love; from the dis∣orders
of selfish passions; from the irrita∣tion
which these occasion when working
within ourselves, and the distress which
they produce when breaking out upon
us from others; in a word, from that
corrupted state of temper, and that reci∣procation
of jealousies, suspicions, and in∣juries,
which is ever taking place among
the societies of men. Could you banish
distrust, craft, and uncharitableness, from
the earth, and form all mankind into an
assembly of the just and the benevolent;
could you inspire every heart with kind
affections, and render every one friendly
and generous to his neighbour; you would
banish at once the most afflictive tribe of
human evils. Seldom would the voice of
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
complaint be heard. All nature would
assume a different aspect. Cheerfulness
would be seen on every countenance. Pa∣radise
would return. The wilderness
would smile; <HI>the desart rejoice and blossom
as the rose.</HI>—Now such are the effects
which the presence of the God of love
must produce on the inhabitants above.
<HI>Beholding his glory, they are changed into
the same image.</HI> In that temple of eternal
love, which his presence has hallowed and
consecrated, no sound but the voice of
harmony is ever heard; no appearances
ever present themselves but those of peace
and joy.</P>
<P>THUS, considering God under these two
illustrious characters which are given of
him in scripture, as <HI>Light,</HI> and as <HI>Love,</HI> it
follows that in his presence there must be
<HI>fulness of joy.</HI> But I am far from saying that
the few imperfect hints I have now given,
exhaust, or even approach to, the sum of
those <HI>pleasures for evermore which are at
God's right hand.</HI> Ten thousand plea∣sures
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
are there, which now we have nie∣ther
faculties to comprehend, nor powers
to enjoy. Behind that mysterious cloud,
which covers the habitation of eternity,
the view of mortals cannot penetrate.
Content with our humble and distant si∣tuation,
we must as yet remain. Faith
can only look to those glories from afar.
In patient silence, it must wait, trust, and
adore.</P>
<P>Supposing the ideas which I have set
before you, in this discourse, to be no
more than the speculations of contem∣plative
mind, such as were wont of old
to be indulged by the philosophers of the
Platonic school, still they would deserve
attention, on account of their tendency to
purify and elevate the mind. But when
they are considered in connection with a
revelation, which, upon grounds the most
unquestionable, we believe to be divine,
they are entitled to command, not atten∣tion
only, but reverence and faith.—They
present to us such high expectations as
are sufficient to determine every reason∣able
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>
man to the choice of virtue; to sup∣port
him under all its present discourage∣ments,
and to comfort him in the hour of
death. Justly may they excite in our
hearts that ardent aspiration of the Psal∣mist:
<HI>My soul thirsteth for God, for the
living God; O when s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all I come and ap∣pear
before him!</HI>—But, with this wish in
our hearts, never, I beseech you, let us
forget what was set forth in the first part of
this discourse; that, in order to arrive at
the presence of God, the <HI>path of life</HI> must
previously be shewn to us by him, and
that in this path we must persevere to the
end. These two things cannot be dis∣joined,
a virtuous life and a happy eter∣nity.
<HI>Who shall ascend unto the hill of the
Lord? and who shall stand in his holy
place? He only who hath clean hands and
a pure heart.</HI> Between a corrupted heart
and the God of light and love, there
never can be any connection. But of
this we may rest assured, that the path of
piety and virtue, pursued with a firm and
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
constant spirit, will, in the end, through
the merits of our blessed Redeemer, bring
us to that presence, where is <HI>fulness of

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN xxi. 21, 22.</BIBL>
<Q>Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and
what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto
him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words occurred in a confe∣rence<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE>
which our Lord held with
Simon Peter, after his resurrection from
the dead. Conscious of the disgrace which
he had incurred by his late denial of his
Master, Peter must at this time have ap∣peared
before him with shame. Our Lord,
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
after a tacit rebuke, implied in the question
which he repeatedly puts to him, <HI>Simon
son of Jonas, lovest thou me?</HI> restores him,
with great benignity, to his office as an a∣postle,
by giving the commandment to
<HI>feed his sheep;</HI> and intimates also that it
should be his lot to suffer death in the
cause of his Master. The apostle John,
distinguished here by the denomination
of <HI>the disciple whom Jesus loved,</HI> being pre∣sent
at this conversation, Peter, who was
always eager and forward, looking to John,
puts this question to our Saviour, <HI>Lord,
and what shall this man do?</HI> “ What shall
be his employment? what his rank and
station in thy kingdom? what his future
fate in life? ”—By what principle Peter
was moved to put this unseasonable and
improper question to his Master; whether
it arose from mere curiosity, or from some
emotion of rivalship and jealousy, does
not appear; but is plain that our Lord
was dissatisfied with the inquiry which
he made; and presently he checks Peter's
curiosity, by a severe reply; <HI>What is that
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
to thee?</HI> “ What is it to thee what <HI>this
man shall do;</HI> what shall be his rank; or
what the circumstances of his life or his
death? Attend thou to thine own duty.
Mind thy proper concerns. Fulfil the
part which I have allotted to thee. <HI>Fol∣low
thou me.</HI> ”—The instruction which
arises from this conversation of our Lord's
with Peter, is, That all prying inqui∣ries
into the state, circumstances, or cha∣racter
of others, are reprehensible and im∣proper;
that to every man a particular
charge is assigned by his Lord and Mas∣ter,
the fulfillment of which ought to be
the primary object of his attention, without
officiously thrusting himself into the con∣cerns
of others. The illustration of these
points shall make the subject of the present
discourse.</P>
<P>THAT idle curiosity that inquisitive
and meddling spirit, which leads men to
pry into the affairs of their neighbours,
is reprehensible on three accounts. It in∣terrupts
the good order, and breaks the
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
peace of society. It brings forward and
nourishes several bad passions. It draws
men aside from a proper attention to the
discharge of their own duty.</P>
<P>IT interrupts, I say, the order, and
breaks the peace of society. In this world
we are linked together by many ties. We
are bound by duty, and we are prompted
by interest, to give mutual assistance, and
to perform friendly offices to each other.
But those friendly offices are performed
the most advantage, when we avoid to in∣terfere
unnecessarily in the concerns of
our neighbour. Every man has his own
part to act, has his own interest to consult,
has affairs of his own to manage, which
his neighbour has no call to scrutinize.
Human life then proceeds in its most na∣tural
and orderly train, when every one
keeps within the bounds of his proper
province; when, as long as his pursuits
are fair and lawful, he is allowed, with∣out
disturbance, to conduct them in his
own way. <HI>That ye study to be quiet, and
<PB N="161" REF="170"/>
to do your own business</HI>*<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 11.</NOTE>, is the apostoli∣cal
rule, and indeed the great rule, for
preservation of harmony and order. But
so it is, that, in every age, a set of men
have existed, who, driven by an unhappy
activity of spirit, oftener perhaps than by
any settled design of doing ill, or any mo∣tives
of ambition or interest, love to in∣termeddle
where they have no concern,
to inquire into the private affairs of others,
and from the imperfect information which
they collect, to form conclusions concern∣ing
their circumstances and character.
These are they who, in scripture, are cha∣racterised
as <HI>tatlers, and busy bodies in other
mens matters,</HI> and from whom we are cal∣led
to <HI>turn away.</HI></P>
<P>Though persons of this description
should be prompted by nothing but vain
curiosity, they are, nevertheless, dangerous
troublers of the world. While they con∣ceive
themselves to be inoffensive, they are
<PB N="162" REF="171"/>
sowing dissension and feuds. Crossing the
lines in which others move, they create
confusion, and awaken resentment. For
every man conceives himself to be inju∣red,
when he finds another intruding in∣to
his affairs, and, without any title, taking
upon him to examine his conduct. Being
improperly and unnecessarily disturbed,
he claims the right of disturbing in his
turn those who wantonly have troubled
him. Hence, many a friendship has been
broken; the peace of many a family has
been overthrown; and much bitter and last∣ing
discord has been propagated through
society.</P>
<P>WHILE this spirit of meddling curio∣sity
injures so considerably the peace and
good order of the world, it also nourishes,
among individuals who are addicted to it,
a multitude of bad passions. Its most
frequent source is mere idlenss, which, in
itself a vice, never fails to engender many
vices more. The mind of man cannot be
long, without some food to nourish the ac∣tivity
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
of its thoughts. The idle, who have
no nourishment of this sort within them∣selves,
feed their thoughts with inquiries
into the conduct of their neighbours.
The inquisitive and curious are always
talkative. What they learn, or fancy
themselves to have learned, concerning o∣thers,
they are generally in haste to di∣vulge.
A tale which the malicious have
invented, and the credulous have pro∣pagated;
a rumour which, arising among
the multitude, and transmitted by one to
another, has, in every step of its progress,
gained fresh additions▪ becomes in the
end the foundation of confident assertion,
and of rash and severe judgement.</P>
<P>It is often by a spirit of jealousy and ri∣valry,
that the researches of such persons
are prompted. They wish to discover some∣thing
that will bring down their neigh∣bour's
character, circumstances, or reputa∣tion,
to the level of their own; or that will
flatter them with an opinion of their own
superiority A secret malignity lies at
the bottom of their inquiries. It may be
<PB N="164" REF="173"/>
concealed by an affected show of candour
and impartiality. It may even be veiled
with the appearance of a friendly concern
for the interests of others, and with af∣fected
apologies for their failings. But
the hidden rancour is easily discovered.—While,
therefore, persons of this descrip∣tion
trouble the peace of society, they at
the same time poison their own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inds
with malignant passions. Their disposi∣tion
is entirely the reverse of that amiable
spirit of charity, on which our religion
lays so great a stress. Charity <HI>covereth
the multitude of sins;</HI> but this prying and
meddling spirit seeks to discover and di∣vulge
them. Charity <HI>thinketh no evil;</HI> but
this temper inclines us always to suspect
the worst. Charity <HI>rejoiceth not in iniqui∣ty;</HI>
this temper triumphs in the discovery
of errors and failings. Charity, like the
fun, brightens every object on which it
shines; a censorious disposition casts e∣very
character into the darkest shade it
will bear.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="174"/>
IT is to be farther observed, that all im∣pertinent
curiosity about the affairs of o∣thers
tends greatly to obstruct personal
reformation; as it draws mens thoughts
aside from what ought to be the chief ob∣ject
of attention, the improvement of their
own heart and life. They who are so of∣ficiously
occupied about their neighbours,
have little leisure, and less inclination, to
observe their own defects, or to mind their
own duty. From their inquisitive re∣searches,
they find, or imagine they find,
in the behaviour of others, an apology
for their own failings: And the favourite
result of their inquiries generally is, to rest
satisfied with themselves. They are at
least as good, they think, as others around
them. The condemnation which they
pass on the vices of their neighbours, they
interpret to be a sentiment of virtue in
thenmselves. They become those hypo∣crites
described by our Lord, who see
clearly <HI>the mote that is in their neighbour's
eye, while they discern not the beam that is
in their own.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="175"/>
IN opposition to such a character as this,
the doctrine plainly inculcated by the text
is, that to every man a particular charge
is given by his Lord and Master, a part is
assigned him by Providence to act; that to
this he ought to bend his chief attention;
and, instead of scrutinising the character
or state of others, ought to think of him∣self,
and leave them to stand or fall by
their own master. <HI>What shall this man do?</HI>
said Peter. <HI>What,</HI> replies our Lord, <HI>is that
to thee? Follow thou me.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE persons possess any important
station, distinguished rank, in the world,
the application of this doctrine to them is
manifest. It they have any candour, they
cannot refuse to acknowledge that God
and the world have a title to expect from
them a diligent attention to their proper
part in life; and that to waste their time
in idle inquiries about others, with whom
they have nothing to do, is reprehensible
and sinful. But there are multitudes of
mankind, to whom this appears in a very
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
different light. They are humble and pri∣vate
men, who are willing to conceive
themselves as of little importance in the
world. Having no extensive influence,
and no call, as they think, to distinguish
themselves by active exertions in any
sphere, they imagine that they may inno∣cently
lead an idle life, and indulge their
curiosity, by canvassing at pleasure the
character and the behaviour of those a∣round
them. With persons of this de∣scription
every society too much abounds.
—My brethren, no one ought to consider
himself as insignificant in the sight of God.
In our several stations we are all sent forth
to be labourers in God's vineyard. Every
man has his work allotted, his talent com∣mitted
to him; by the due improvement
of which he might, in one way or other,
serve God, promote virtue, and be use∣ful
in the world. <HI>Occupy till I come,</HI> is
the charge given to all Christians without
exception. To be entirely unemployed
and idle is the prerogative of no one, in
any rank of life.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="177"/>
Even that sex, whose task is not to
mingle in the labours of public and ac∣tive
business, have their own part assigned
them to act. In the quiet of domestic
shade, there are a variety of virtues to be
exercised, and of important duties to be
discharged. Much depends on them for
the maintenance of private oeconomy and
order, for the education of the young, and
for the relief and comfort of those whose
functions engage them in the toils of the
world. Even where no such female du∣ties
occur to be performed, the care of
preparing for future usefulness, and of at∣taining
such accomplishments as procure
just esteem, is laudable. In such duties
and cares, how far better is time employ∣ed,
than in that search into private con∣cerns,
that circulation of rumours, those
discussions of the conduct, and descants
on the character of others, which engross
conversation so much, and which end,
for the most part, in severity of censure!</P>
<P>In whatever condition we are placed,
to act always in character should be our
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
constant rule. He who acts in charac∣ter
is above contempt, though his station
be low. He who acts out of character
is despicable, though his station be ever
so high. <HI>What is that to thee,</HI> what this
man or that man does? Think of what
thou oughtest to do thy sefl; of what is sui∣table
to thy character and place; of what
the world has a title to expect from thee.
Every excursion of vain curiosity about
others, is a subtraction from that time and
thought which was due to ourselves and
due to God. <HI>Having gifts,</HI> says the Apostle
Paul, <HI>differing according to the grace that is
given us, whether ministry, let us wait on our
ministring; or he that teacheth, on teaching;
or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He
that giveth, let him do it with simplicity;
he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 6,—9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the great circle of human affairs
there is room for every one to be busy
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
and well employed in his own province,
without encroaching upon that of others.
It is thy province of superiors to direct;
of inferiors, to obey; of the learned to be
instructive; of the ignorant, to be docile;
of the old to be communicative; of the
young to be adviseable and diligent. Art
thou poor? Show thyself active and in∣dustrious,
peaceable and contented. Art
thou wealthy? Show thyself beneficient
and charitable, condescending and hu∣mane.
If thou livest much in the world,
it is the duty to make the light of a good
example shine conspicuously before others.
If thou livest private and retired, it is thy
business to improve thine own mind, and
to add, if thou canst do no more, one
faithful subject to the Messiah's kingdom.
There is indeed no man so sequestered
from active life, but within his own nar∣row
sphere he may find some opportuni∣ties
of doing good; of cultivating friend∣ship,
promoting peace, and discharging
many of these lesser offices of humanity
and kindness, which are within the reach
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
of every one, and which we all owe to
one another. In all the various relations
which subsist among us in life, as hus∣band
and wife, master and servants, pa∣rents
and children, relations and friends,
rulers and subjects, innumerable duties
stand ready to be performed; innumera∣ble
calls to virtuous activity present them∣selves
on every hand, sufficient to fill up
with advantage and honour the whole
time of man.</P>
<P>THERE is, in particular, one great and
comprehensive object of attention, which,
in the text, is placed in direct opposition to
that idle curiosity reprehended by our
Lord; that is, to follow Christ. <HI>Follow
thou me.</HI> What this man or that man
does; how he employs his time; what
use he makes of his talents; how he suc∣ceeds
in the world; are matters, concern∣ing
which the information we receive can
never be of great importance to ud; of∣ten,
is of no importance at all. But how
our Saviour behaved while he was on
<PB N="172" REF="181"/>
earth, or how, in our situation, he would
have behaved, are matters of the highest
moment to every Christian.</P>
<P>The commandment given in the text,
to <HI>follow him,</HI> includes both observance
of his words, and imitation of his exam∣ple.
the words of Christ contain, as we
all know, the standing rule of our life.
His example exhibits the great model on
which our conduct ought to be formed;
and it is to this that the precept here deliver∣ed
directly refers.—Examples have great
influence on all. But by all human exam∣ples,
we are in danger of being occasion∣ally
misled. We are ever obliged to be on
our guard, lest the admiration of what is
estimable, betray us into a resemblance of
what is blemished and faulty. For the
most perfect human characters, in the
midst of their brightness and beauty▪ are
always marked with some of those dark
spots which stain the nature of man.
But our Lord possessed all the virtues of
the greatest and best men, without par∣taking
any of their defects. In him, all
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
was light without a shade, and beauty
without a stain.—At the same time, his
example is attended with this singular ad∣vantage,
of being more accommodated
than any other to general imitation. It
was distinguished by no unnatural auste∣rities,
no affected singularities; but exhi∣bits
the plain and simple tenor of all those
virtues for which we have most frequent
occasion in ordinary life. In order to
render it of more universal benefit, our
Lord fixed his residence in no particular
place; he tied himself down to no parti∣cular
calling or way of living; but gives
us the opportunity of viewing his beha∣viour,
in that variety of lights which e∣qually
and indifferently regard all man∣kind.
His life was divided between the
retired and the active state. Devotion and
business equally shared it. In the dis∣charge
of that high office with which
he was vested, we behold the perfect mo∣del
of a public character; and we behold
the most beautiful example of private life,
when we contemplate him among his dis∣ciples,
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
as a Father in the midst of his fa∣mily.
—By such means he has exhibited
before us specimens of every kind of
virtue; and to all ranks and classes of
men has afforded a pattern after which
they may copy. Hardly is there any e∣mergency
which can occur in life, but
from some incident in our Saviour's con∣duct,
from some feature displayed in his
character, we are enabled to say to our∣selves,
“ Thus Christ would have spoken,
thus he would have acted, thus he
would have suffered, if he had been cir∣cumstanced
as we are now.”</P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of thinking of thy
neighbours around thee, and of inquiring
how they behave, keep Christ in thine eye,
and in thy whole conduct follow him.
<HI>Follow him</HI> in his steady and conscientious
discharge of duty, amidst opposition from
evil men, and a corrupted world. Follow
him in his patient submission to his Fa∣ther's
will, and the calmenss of his spirit
under all trials. Follow him in his acts
of disinterested benevolence, in his com∣passion
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
to the unhappy, in his readiness
to oblige, to assis, and to relieve. Imitate
the mildness and gentlen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of his man∣ners.
Imitate the assability and conde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en∣sion
which appeared in his behaviour.
Imitate the uncorrupted simplicity and
purity which distinguished his whole life.</P>
<P>THESE are much worthier and nobler
objects of your attention, than any of those
trifling varieties which you can explore
and discover in the characters of those
among whom you live. By lifting your
view to so high a standard, you will be
preserved from descending to those futile
and corrupting employments of thought,
which occupy the idle, the vain, and the
malignant. It is incredible, how much
time and attention are thrown away by
men, in examining the affairs of others,
and discussing their conduct. Were their
time and attention thrown away only, the
evil would, in some degree, be less. But
they are worse than thrown away; they
are not merely fruitless, but productive of
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
much mischief. Such a habit of thought
is connected with a thousand vices. It is
the constant source of rash and severe cen∣sure.
It arises from envy and jealousy.
It foments ill nature and pride. It pro∣pagates
misunderstanding and discord. All
those evils would be prevented, if the re∣proof
which our Lord administers in the
text came oftener home, with proper au∣thority,
to the reflexion of men: <HI>What is
that to thee?</HI> Each of us have more mate∣rial
and important business of our own to
fulfil. Our task is assigned; our part al∣lotted.
Did we suitably examine how
that part was performed, we should be less
disposed to busy ourselves about the con∣cerns
of others. We would discover ma∣ny
a disorder to be corrected at home;
many a weed to be pulled out from our
own grounds; much remaining to be done,
in order to render ourselves useful in this
world, and fit for a world to come.—Wherefore,
instead of being critics on
others, let us employ our criticism on
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
ourselves. Leaving others to be judged
by Him who searcheth the heart▪ let us
implore his assistance for enabling us to
act well our own part, and to follow
Christ.</P>

<P>THESE words of our Lord were oc∣casioned<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IX.</NOTE>
by a circumstance in his behaviour which appeared
mysterious to his disciples. When about to celebrate
his last passover, he meant to give them
an instructive lesson of condescension and
humility. The mode which he chose for
<PB N="179" REF="188"/>
delivering this instruction, was the em∣blematical
action to washing their feet.
When Simon Peter saw his Master addres∣sing
himself to the performance of so me∣nial
an office, he exclaims with the great∣est
surprise, <HI>Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</HI>
Our Lord replies, in the words of the

<P>The expressions of a divine person, on

properly be applied to various instances,
where the conduct of Providence, in the
administration of human affairs, remains
dark and mysterious to us <HI>What I do,

when a commentary shall be afforded on
all that is now obscure; when the veil of
mystery shall be removed; and full sa∣tisfaction
be given to every rational mind.
<HI>Thou shalt know hereafter.</HI> This is the
doctrine which I purpose to illustrate in
the following discourse.</P>
<P>I. OUR Saviour's words lead us to ob∣serve,
that many things in the conduct
of Providence are at present mysterious
and unintelligible. The truth of this
observation will not be called in question.
It is indeed very readily admitted by all;
and ever since the beginning of the world
has been the foundation of many a com∣plaint,
and of much scepticism concern∣ing
the government of Heaven.—That
human affairs are not left to roll on ac∣cording
to mere chance, and that Provi∣dence
interposes in them to a certain de∣gree,
is made evident by various tokens
to every candid mind. But the perplexi∣ty
and trouble of the thoughtful inqui∣rer
arises from observing that Providence
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
appears not to pursue any regular or con∣sistent
plan. An unaccountable mixture
of light and darkness presents itself to us,
when we attempt to trace the affairs of
the world up to any wise and righteous
administration. We see justice and order
begun; but on many occasions they seem
to be deserted The ray of light which
we had traced for a while, suddenly for∣sakes
us; and, where we had looked for
the continuance of order, we meet with
confusion and disappointment.—For in∣stance;
when we examine the constitu∣tion
of the human mind, we discern evi∣dent
marks of its being framed with a
view to favour and reward virtue. Con∣science
is endowed with signal authori∣ty
to check vice. It brings home un∣easiness
and remorse to the bad; and it
sooths and supports the righteous with
self-approbation and peace. The ordi∣nary
course of human things is made to
coincide in some degree with this consti∣tution
of our nature. The worthy and
the good are, in general, honoured and
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
esteemed. <HI>He that walketh uprightly,</HI> is,
for the most part, found to <HI>walk surely.</HI>
The chief misfortunes that befal us in life
can be traced to some vices or follies
which we have committed; and it almost
never happens but the <HI>sinner's own wic∣kedness
is made,</HI> sooner or later, <HI>to reprove
him, and his backslidings to correct him.</HI></P>
<P>All this carries the impress of a just
Providence, of a wise and a benevolent
administration of the universe. We can∣not
avoid perceiving that the Almighty
hath <HI>set his throne for judgement.</HI> At
the same time, when we pursue our in∣quiries,
the Almighty appears to <HI>hold back
the face of his throne, and to spread his cloud
upon it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxvi. 9.</NOTE>. For in looking abroad into the
world, how many scenes do we behold,
which are far from corresponding with
any ideas we could form of the govern∣ment
of Heaven? Many nations of the
earth we see lying in a state of barbarity
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>
and misery; sunk in such gross igno∣rance
as degrades them below the rank of
rational beings; or abandoned to be the
prey of cruel oppression and tyranny.
When we look to the state of individuals
around us, we hear the lamentations of
the unhappy on every hand. We meet with
weeping parents, and mourning friends.
We behold the young cut off in the flower
of their days, and the aged left desolate
in the midst of sorrows. The useful and
virtuous are swept away, and the worth∣less
left to flourish. The lives of the best
men are often filled with discouragements
and disappointed hopes. Merit languish∣es
in neglected solitude; and vanity and
presumption gain the admiration of the
world. From the scourge of calumny,
and from the hand of violence, the inju∣red
look up to God as the Avenger of
their cause; but often they look up in
vain. He is <HI>a God that hideth himself.</HI>
He dwelleth, as to them, in the secret
place of darkness; or, if he dwelleth in
<PB N="184" REF="193"/>
light, it is in <HI>light to which no man can
approach.</HI> Resignation may seal up their
lips; but in silence they drop the tear,
and mourn while they adore.</P>
<P>SUCH, it must not be dissembled, are
the difficulties which encounter us when
we attempt to trace the present ways of
God. At the same time, upon reflection,
we may be satisfied that causes can be as∣signed
for things appearing in this un∣favourable
light; and that there is no
reason to be surprised at the divine con∣duct
being mysterious at present.</P>
<P>The monarchy of the universe is a great
and complicated system. It comprehends
numberless generations of men, who are
brought forth to act their parts for pur∣poses
unknown to us. It includes two
worlds at once; the world that now is,
and which is only a small portion of
existence; and a world that is to come,
which endures for eternity. To us, no
more than the beginnings of things are
visible. We see only some broken parts
<PB N="185" REF="194"/>
of a great whole. We trace but a few
links of that chain of being, which,
by secret connections, binds together
the present and the future Such know∣ledge
is afforded us as is sufficient for
supplying the exigencies and wants of
our present state; but it does no more.
Peeping abroad from a dark corner of the
universe, we attempt in vain to explore
the counsels that govern the world. It is
an attempt to sound an unfa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>homable deep
with a scanty line; and with a feeble
wing to ascend above the stars. In any
complicated work, even of human art, it
is found necessary to be acquainted with
the design of the whole, in order to judge
of the fitness of its parts. In a scheme
so complex as the administration of the
world, where all the parts refer to one
another, and where what is seen is often
subordinate to what is invisible, how is it
possible but our judgements must be of∣ten
erroneous, and our complaints ill-founded?
If a peasant or a cottager be
incapable of judging of the govern∣ment
<PB N="186" REF="195"/>
of a mighty empire, is it surprising
that we should be at a loss concerning the
conduct of the Almighty towards his crea∣tures?
<HI>What I do thou knowest not now.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, on this argument still more can
be said for our satisfaction. We are to
observe, that complete information re∣specting
the ways of God, not only was
not to be expected here; but, moreover,
that it would have been hurtful, if grant∣ed
to us in our present state. It would
have proved inconsistent with that state;
with the actions which we have to per∣form
in it, and the duties we have to ful∣fil.
It would indeed have overthrown
the whole design of our being placed
in this world. We are placed here un∣der
the trial of our virtue. Ignorance
of the events that are ordained to befal
us, ignorance of the plans and the decrees
of heaven, enter necessarily into a state
of trial. In order to exercise both our
intellectual and moral powers, and to car∣ry
them forward to improvement, we must
<PB N="187" REF="196"/>
be left to find our way in the midst of
difficulties and doubts, of hardships, and
sufferings. We must be taught to act our
part with constancy, though the reward
of our constancy be distant. We must
learn to bear with patience whatever our
Creator judges proper to lay upon us,
though we see not the reason of the hard∣ships
he inflicts. If we were let into the
secret of the whole plan of Providence;
if the justice of Heaven were, in every
step of its procedure, made manifest to
our view, man would no longer be the
creature he now is, nor would his present
state answer any purpose of discipline or
trial.</P>
<P>Mystery and darkenss, therefore, must
of necessity now take place in the course
of things. Our present state can be no
other than a state of twilight or dawn,
where dubious forms shall often present
themselves to us, and where we shall find
ourselves in a middle condition between
complete light and total darkness. Had
we enjoyed no evidence of a just Judge
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
ruling the earth, and of his providence
interposing in our affairs, virtue would
have been altogether deprived of its en∣couragement
and support. Had the evi∣dence,
on the other hand, been so strong
as to place the hand of the Almighty con∣stantly
before our eyes, the intention of our
present existence would have been defeated,
and no trial of virtue have remained. In∣stead,
therefore, of complaining of the ob∣scurity
which at present cover the con∣duct
of Providence, we see that, on the
whole, we have reason to submit and a∣dore.</P>
<P>II. THE text suggests that, though what
God is doing, or what he intends to do,
we <HI>know not now,</HI> yet there is ground to
believe, that at some future period we
shall receive information <HI>What I do thou
knowest not now, but thou shalt know here∣after.</HI>
The question here arises, what that
<HI>hereafter</HI> is to which we are to look for
the solution of our present doubts?</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198"/>
IN the first place, <HI>hereafter</HI> may, on
some occasions, refer to the subsequent
course of events in this world. It often
happens that the consequences of things
throw light on the designs of God. The
history of Providence, in proportion as it
advances, disembroils itself. Though our
present condition forbids extensive and
complete information, yet as much is
sometimes allowed to appear as gives us
favourable openings into the righteous and
benevolent counsels of heaven.—Thus, in
the public affairs of the world, it has been
frequently seen, that from the most un∣promising
causes important and benefi∣cent
effects have, in the sequel, arisen. In
our own country, at one period, the vio∣lent
passions of a prince gave beginning to
the Reformation. At another period, ar∣bitrary
attempts against religion and li∣berty
occasioned that happy Revolution
which has formed the aera of national
prosperity. In many instances, <HI>the wrath
of man</HI> has been made to <HI>praise God.</HI> Those
wars and commotions that shake the mo∣ral
<PB N="190" REF="199"/>
world have answered similar purposes
with tempests in the natural world, of
purging the air from noxious vapours, and
restoring it to a temperature more sound
and wholesome. From the midst of con∣fusion
order has been made to spring, and
from temporary mischiefs, lasting advan∣tages
to arise.—In all cases of this na∣ture,
with which sacred and civil history
abounds, secret designs of heaven wee
going on, which were unfolded in the
end. The wheel was always in motion.
The hand of the clock was advancing with
unperceived progress, till the moment came
of its striking the appointed hour.</P>
<P>In like manner, with respect to indivi∣duals,
there is often a <HI>hereafter</HI> in the
course of their lives, which discloses and
justifies the ways of God. Not to mention
the good effects which misfortunes are
found to produce on the minds of men,
by checking their vices, and correcting
their errors, innumerable exemplifications
can be given, of misfortunes paving their
way to future advancement in the world.
<PB N="191" REF="200"/>
We are always querulous and impatient
when designs succeed not according to
our wish. Ignorant of what futurity is to
bring forward, occupied with nothing but
the present, we exclaim, Where is God?
Where the sceptre of righteousness? <HI>Hath
he forgotten to be gracious?</HI> or doth he in∣deed
see, and is there knowledge in the
Most High?—<HI>God seeth not as man seeth:</HI>
He looketh not merely to what you suf∣fer,
but to what the effect of these suf∣ferings
is to be. Consider only in how
different a light the Patriarch Joseph would
view the events of his life after he had
seen in what they had terminated, from
the light in which he saw them, when led
away by the Ishmaelites as a slave, or when
thrown by Potiphar into the Egyptian
prison. We murmur against Providence,
just as the impetuous youth frets against
his instructors and tutors, who are keep∣ing
him under a strict, and as he thinks
a needless, discipline. He knows not
that, by their instruction and discipline,
they are laying the foundation of his fu∣ture
<PB N="192" REF="201"/>
fortunes; of the wealth which he is
to acquire, and of the advancement to
which he is to rise in the world. What
may justly be said to him by his tutors
and instructors, is equally applicable to
us all under our present state of educati∣on;
<HI>What I do, thou knowest not now, but
thou shalt know hereafter.</HI>—Regarding,
then, the unknow issue of all worldly
events in this life, let us never despair;
let us never think dishonourably of the
government of God; but have patience
till his providence accomplish its designs
in its won way, and at its own time. <HI>Al∣though
thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet
judgement is before him; therefore trust thou
in him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the second place, the expression of
<HI>hereafter</HI> in the text must be understood
to refer, in its full extent, not to future
events in this life, but to a subsequent
<PB N="193" REF="202"/>
state of being. For this life is no more
than the beginning of the mighty and
extensive plans of Providence. The seeds
are only now sown, of what is to ripen
and come forth, at the harvest of the
world; when the revolution of the great
moral year shall be finished, and the go∣vernment
of God shall obtain its full com∣pletion.
It is the chief scope of religion
to direct our view to this period; and it
hath often taught us that the knowledge
of the ways of God, then enjoyed by the
blessed, shall constitute a chief article of
their felicity. <HI>Now we see through a
glass darkly; but then face to face. Now
we know in part; but then we shall know
even as we are known. When that which
is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away. In God's light we shall
see light</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cor. xiii. 10, 12. Psalm xxxvi. 9.</NOTE>. The reasons that required ob∣scurity
to remain for a while on the ways
of God no longer subsist. The education
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
of good men is completed; and the inten∣tion
of those steps of education, which
once they could not comprehend, now be∣comes
apparent—Why this man was pre∣maturely
carried away from the world in
the beginning of a promising course; why
that deserving family were left overwhelm∣ed
with grief and despair, by the loss of
one who was their sole benefactor and
support; why friendships cemented by
tender ties were suddenly torn asunder
by death: These are inquiries to which
we can now make no reply; and which
throw a dark gloom over the condut of
the Almighty. But the spirits of the just
above, who are admitted to a larger view
of the ways of God, see the reasons of
such counsels. They see that one man
was seasonably taken away from dangers
and evils to come, which, unknow to
him, were hovering over his head. They
see that Providence was in secret prepa∣ring
unexpected blessings for the family
who appeared to be left disconsolate and
hopeless. They see that it was time for
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>
friendships to be dissolved, when their
longer continuance would to some of the
parties have proved a snare. Where we
behold nothing but the rod of power
stretched forth, they discern an interposi∣tion
of the hand of mercy.</P>
<P>Let us wait till this promised <HI>hereafter</HI>
arrive, and we shall in like manner be sa∣tisfied
concerning the events that now
disturb and perplex us. We shall then
know why so much darkenss and misery
have been so long permitted to reamain on
the earth, and so much opression and
tyranny to prevail among the nations.
We shall see rising, as from the ashes
of the old world, a new and beautiful
structure; <HI>new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness.</HI> As wide
as is the difference between the appearance
of the world, when it lay in its primitive
chaos, <HI>without form and void,</HI> and the ap∣pearance
it has now assumed, when re∣splendent
with the light of the sun, and
decked with the beauties of nature; such
is the difference between the divine plans
<PB N="196" REF="205"/>
in the beginnings, and in their full
completion. At the conclusion, and not
till then, the glory of the Lord shall be∣come
manifest to all; and, as it is de∣scribed
in the book of the Revelation, a
voice shall be heard <HI>from every creature
which is in heaven and on the earth, and un∣der
the earth, saying, Blessing, and honour,
and power, and glory, be to him that sitteth
on the throne. Great and marvellous are
thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and
true are thy ways, thou King of saints</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 13.—xv. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>APPLICATION of the doctrines that
have been illustrated may be made to
two classes of men.</P>
<P><HI>First,,</HI> To sceptics; who, from the pre∣sent
mysterious conduct of Providence,
hastily draw the conclusion, that no go∣vernment
is exercised over human affairs,
but that all things are suffered indiscri∣mintely
to come alike to all men.—I
<PB N="197" REF="206"/>
have shown that from the inadequate
views which we are at present able to
take of the general system, such myste∣rious
appearances of Providence must be
expected to take place. Not only so, but
I have also shown it to be fit and necessa∣ry
that this mixture of obscurity should
now remain; as a full display of regular
justice and order would be inconsistent
with the moral improvement of men in
this life.—Let me desire the sceptic to look
to the state of the natural worlds. When
he thinks of the order and magnificence
that prevail in it, he will, perhaps, be un∣willing
to pronounce it the mere produc∣tion
of chance. He cannot but recog∣nise
the hand of Intelligence, and acknow
ledge it to have proceeded from a design∣ing
Cause. I ask him, Whether in the
natural world he discerns not as many
mysterious and puzzling appearances as
are to be found in the moral world?
Are not destructive storms, burning
mountains, uninhabitable deserts, as dif∣ficult
<PB N="198" REF="207"/>
to be reconciled to his pre-con∣conceived
ideas of supreme wisdom and
goodness in the Creator, as the sufferings
and afflictions which in the course of Pro∣vidence
befal the just? The natural and
moral world are, in this respect, counter∣parts
to one another. Both are marked
with the same characters, and carry the
imprcss of the same powerful and gracious
hand. In both, it is evidently the intention
of the first Author not to render every
thing level to our capacity; but in the
midst of high design and order, to al∣low
certain objects to appear, which con∣tradict
the ideas we had formed, and
mock our vain researches. Now, if we
are obliged to admit that the order
and beauty of the natural world suffici∣ently
prove it to be the work of a wise
Creator, notwithstanding the seeming
deformities which it exhibits; are we
not led, by the same train of reasoning,
to conclude that the moral world is un∣der
the direction of a wise Governor,
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
though much of what he now does we
cannot satisfactorily explain?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE doctrine of the text is
to be applied not only for silencing scep∣tics
but for comforting the pious. Ne∣ver
let them be dejected by the darkness
which now covers the ways of the Al∣mighty.
If he withdraws himself from
their view, it is not because he neglects
them; but because they are incapable of
comprehending his designs; because it
were not for their good that all his de∣signs
were revealed to them—Instead of
perplexing themselves about what is ob∣scure,
let them rest on the clear and au∣thentic
discoveries that have been given of
the divine goodness. Let them rest on those
great and signal facts that prove it; par∣ticularly
on that illustrious fact, the re∣demption
of the world by Jesus Christ,
He that <HI>spared not his own Son, but gave
him up for us all,</HI> will assuredly not always
conceal himself from those who serve him.
Though what he does they <HI>know not now,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="209"/>
the time approaches when <HI>they shall know
hereafter.</HI> Till that time come, let them
believe and trust; let them hope and a∣dore.
From this conclusion let them ne∣ver
depart, that to <HI>fear God and keep his
commandments</HI> is in every situation the
truest wisdom; that, if there be govern∣ment
in the universe at ll, the virtuous
and the worthy are loved and protected
by Heaven; that in <HI>due season they shall
reap if they faint not; for the care of them
is with the Lord, and their reward with
the Most High.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 PETER ii. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>While they promise them liberty, they them∣selves
are the servants of corruption; for
of whom a man is overcome, of the same
is he brought in bondage.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BONDAGE and subjection are disa∣greeable
sounds to the ear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. X.</NOTE> disagree∣able
ideas to the mind. The advo∣cates
of vice, taking advantage of those
natural impressions, have in every age
employed them for discrediting religion.
They represent it as the bondage and con∣finement
<PB N="202" REF="211"/>
of the free-born soul of man;
as a state of perpetual constraint, formed
by a system of severe rules, which design∣ing
men have contrived to impose as fet∣ters
on the multitude. On the other hand,
they paint a licentious course to them∣selves,
and hold it out to the world, as
the gay and pleasurable enjoyment of
life; where, having surmounted the pre∣judices
of education, and the timorous
scruples of conscience, men can think and
act at pleasure, and give full scope to
every wish of the heart.—But what if
those pretended sons of freedom be them∣selves
held in miserable subjection, and
their boasts of liberty be no more than
the <HI>swelling words of vanity?</HI> The Apostle
asserts in the text, that while they <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c
liberty</HI> to others, they are <HI>the servants,</HI> or
slaves, of <HI>corruption, overcome, and brought
into bondage by it.</HI> This assertion of the
Apostle I purpose to illustrate. I shall en∣deavour
to make it appear, that no true
liberty can arise from vice; that bad men
<PB N="203" REF="212"/>
undergo the worst servitude; and that no
one is free, but he who is virtuous and good.</P>
<P>IT is necessary to begin with removing
false ideas of liberty, and showing in what
it truly consists. We are not to imagine
that to be free imports our being set loose
from restraint or rule of every kind. No
man, in any condition of life, is at liberty
to act always as he pleases, and to gratify
every wish he forms. The nature of the
human state necessarily imposes on all
men various restraints. The laws of so∣ciety
allow no one to indulge himself in
pursuits or pleasures that are injurious to
his neighbour. Even our own nature
limits our pleasures within certain bounds.
All our desires cannot be gratified toge∣ther.
They frequently interfere, and re∣quire
him who would indulge one favour∣ite
passion, to deny himself in another.
Distinctions, therefore, must be made,
preferences be given, and some general
regulation of conduct be observed, by
every one who consults his own welfare.
<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
If there be any regulation which ensures
us of safety and happiness, to be disen∣gaged
from the observance of that regu∣lation
is no article of liberty; at least of
such liberty as a wise man would wish to
enjoy. It is in effect to be turned loose
to our own ruin. It is such liberty as a
blind man enjoys, of wandering at ran∣dom,
and striking into every devious path,
without a guide to direct his steps, and
save him from destruction.</P>
<P>That unbounded licentioussness, there∣fore,
which sinners prefer to every regu∣lation
of conduct, is altogether different
from true freedom. It is in moral beha∣viour
the same as anarchy is in a state,
where law and order are cxtinct. An∣archy,
surely, is no less incompatible
with true liberty than absolute despotism;
and of the two it is hard to say which is
the least eligible, or the most miserable
state. Liberty by no means suppoes the
absence of all government. It only sup∣poses
that the government under which
we are placed is wise; and that the re∣straints
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
to which we voluntarily submit
ourselves have been contrived for the ge∣neral
interest.</P>
<P>To be free, therefore, imports, in gene∣ral,
our being placed in such circumstan∣ces,
that within the bounds of justice and
good order, we can act according to our
own deliberate choice, and take such mea∣sures
for our conduct as we have reason
to believe are conducive to our welfare;
without being obstructed either by ex∣ternal
force, or by violent internal impulse.
This is that happy and dignified state
which every wise man earnestly wishes to
enjoy. The advantages which result from
it are chiefly these three; freedom of choice;
independence of mind; boldness and se∣curity.
In opposition to these distin∣guishing
characters of liberty, I now pro∣ceed
to show that, in the first place, vice
deprives bad men of free choice in their
actions; that, in the second place, it
brings them under a slavish dependence
on external circumstances; and that, in
the third place, it reduces them to that
<PB N="206" REF="215"/>
abject, cowardly, and disquieted state
which is essentially characteristic of bon∣dage.</P>
<P>I. VICE is inconsisten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with liberty, as it
deprives sinners of the power of free choice,
by bringing them under the dominion
of passions and habits. Religion and virtue
adderss themselves to reason. They call
us to look round on every side; to think
well of the consequences of our actions;
and, before we taken any step of importance,
to compare the good with the evil that
may ensue from it. He therefore who fol∣lows
their dictates, acts the part of a man
who freely consults, and chuses, for his own
interest. But vice can make no preten∣sions
of this kind. It awaits not the test of
deliberate comparison and choice; but o∣verpowers
us at once by some striking im∣pression
of present advantage or enjoyment.
It hurries us with the violence of passion;
captivates us by the allurements of plea∣sure;
or dazzles us by the glare of riches.
The sinner yields to the impulse, merely
<PB N="207" REF="216"/>
because he cannot resist it. Reason re∣monstrates;
conscience endeavours to
check him; but all in vain. Having once
allowed some strong passion to gain the
ascendant, he has thrown himself into
the middle of a torrent, against which he
may sometimes faintly struggle, but the
impetuosity of the stream bears him along.
In this situation he is so far from being
free, that he is not master of himself.
He does not go, but is driven; tossed, a∣gitated,
and impelled; passive, like a ship
to the violence of the waves.</P>
<P>After passions has for a while exercised
its tyrannical sway, its vehemence may by
degrees subside. But when by long in∣dulgence,
it has established habits of gra∣tification,
the sinner's bondage becomes
then more confirmed, and more miserable.
For during the heat of pursuit he is little
capable of reflection. But, when his ar∣dour
is abated, and nevertheless, a vitious
habit rooted, he has full leisure to per∣ceive
the heavy yoke he has brought upon
himself. How many slaves do we see in
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
the world to intemperance, and all kinds
of criminal pleasure, merely through the
influence of customs which they had al∣lowed
to become so inveterate that it was
not in their power to alter them? Are
they not often reduced to a condition so
wretched, that when their licentious plea∣sures
have become utterly insipid, they
are still forced to continue them, solely be∣cause
they cannot refrain; not beacause
the indulgence gives them pleasure, but
because abstinence would give them pain;
and this too, even when they are obliged
at last to condemn their habits of life, as
injuring their fortune, impairing their
constitution, or disgracing their charac∣ter?
Vice is not of such a nature that we
can say to it, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come and
no further.</HI> Having once entered into its
territories, it is not in our power to make
a retreat when we please. <HI>He that com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>teth
sin is the servant of sin.</HI> No man
who has once yielded up the government
of his mind, and given loose rein to his
desires and passions, can tell how far these
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
may carry him. He may be brought into
such a desperate state, that nothing shall
remain for him but to look back with
regret upon the forsaken path of inno∣cence
and liberty; and, severely conscious
of the thraldom he suffers, to groan under
fetters which he despairs of throwing of.
<HI>Can the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thiopian change his skin, or the
leopard his spots? then may ye also do good
who are accustomed to do evil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xiii. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Vice confirms its dominion, and ex∣tends
it still farther over the soul, by com∣pelling
the sinner to support one crime by
means of another. Not only is he enslav∣ed
to those vices which take their rise
from his own inclination, but they render
others necessary, to which, against his in∣clination,
he must submit; and thereby
strengthen the commanding power of ini∣quity
within him. The immoderate love
of pleasure, for instance, leads him into
expence beyond his fortune. In order to
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
support that expence, he is obliged to
have recourse to low and dishonourable
methods of gain, which originally he de∣spised.
To cover these, he is forced upon
arts of dissimulation and fraud. One in∣stance
of fraud obliges him to support
it by another; till, in the end, there a∣rises
a character of complicated vice; of
luxury shooting forth into baseness, dis∣honesty,
injustice, and perhaps cruelty.
It is thus that one favourite passion brings
in a tribe of auxiliaries to complete the
dominion of sin. Among all our corrupt
passions there is a strong and intimate con∣nection.
When any one of them is a∣dopted
into our family, it never quits us
until it has fathered upon us all its kind∣red.
—By such means as these, by the
violence of passions, by the power of ha∣bits,
and by the connection of one vice
with another, sin establishes that servitude
over the will, which deprives bad men of
all power of free choice in their actions.</P>
<P>II. THE slavery produced by vice ap∣pears
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
in the dependence under which it
brings the sinner, to circumstances of exter∣nal
fortune. One of the favourite charac∣ters
of liberty, is the independence it be∣stows.
He who is truly a freeman is above all
servile compliances, and abject subjection.
He is able to rest upon himself; and while
he regards his superiors with proper de∣ference,
neither debases himself by cring∣ing
to them, nor is tempted to purchase
their favour by dishonourable means.
But the sinner has for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited every privi∣ledge
of this nature. His passions and
habits render him an absolute dependent
on the world, and the world's favour; on
the uncertain goods of fortune, and the
fickle humours of men. For it is by
these he subsists, and among these his
happiness is sought; according as his
passions determine him to pursue plea∣sures,
riches, or preferments. Having no
fund within himself whence to draw enjoy∣ment,
his only resource is in things with∣out.
His hopes and fears all hang upon
the world. He partakes in all its vicissi∣tudes;
and is moved and shaken by eve∣ry
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
wind of fortune. This is to be in the
strictest sense a slave to the world.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue, on the other
hand, confer on the mind principles of
noble independence. <HI>The upright man is
satisfied from himself.</HI> He despises not the
advantages of fortune; but he centers
not his happiness in them. With a mo∣derate
share of them he can be contented;
and contentment is felicity. Happy in
his own integrity, conscious of the esteem
of good men, reposing firm trust in the
providence, and the promises of God, he
is exempted from servile dependence on
other things. He can wrap himself up
in a good conscience, and look forward,
without terror, to the change of the world.
Let all things shift around him as they
please, he believes that, by the divine or∣dination,
they shall be made <HI>to work to∣gether</HI>
in the issue <HI>for his good:</HI> And
therefore, having much to hope from
God, and little to fear from the world,
he can be ease in every state. One who
possesses within himself such an establish∣ment
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
of mind, is truly free.—But shall
I call that man free, who has nothing that
is his own, no property assured; whose
very heart is not his own, but rendered
the appendage of external things, and the
sport of fortune? Is that man free, let
his outward condition be ever so splendid,
whom his imperious passions detain at
their call, whom they send forth at their
pleasure, to drudge and toil, and to beg
his only enjoyment from the casualties of
the world? Is he free, who must flatter
and lie to compass his ends; who must
bear with this man's caprice, and that
man's scorn; must profess friendship where
he hates, and respect where he contemns;
who is not at liberty to appear in his own
colours, nor to speak his own sentiments;
who dares not be honest, lest he should
be poor?—Believe it, no chains bind
so hard, no fetters are so heavy, as those
which fasten the corrupted heart to this
treacherous world; no dependence is
more contemptible than that under which
the voluptuous, the covetous, or the am∣bitious
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
man lies to the means of pleasure,
gain, or power. Yet this is the boasted li∣berty,
which vice promises, as the recom∣pence
of setting us free from the salutary
restraints of virtue.</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER character of the slave∣ry
of vice, is that mean, cowardly, and dis∣quieted
state, to which it reduces the sinner.
Boldness and magnanimity have ever been
accounted the native effects of liberty.
He who enjoys it, having nothing to ap∣prehend
from oppressive power, performs
the offices, and enjoys the comforts of
life, with a manly and undisturbed mind,
Hence his behaviour a dignified, and his
sentiments are honourable; while he who
is accustomed to bend under servile subjec∣tion,
has always been found mean-spirited,
timorous, and base.—Compare, in these
respects, the virtuous and the vicious man,
and you will easily see to which of them
the characteristics of freedom most justly
belong. The man of virtue, relying on
a good conscience and the protection of
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
Heaven, acts with firmneses and courage;
and in the discharge of his duty, fears
not the face of man. The man of vice,
conscious of his low and corrupt aims,
shrinks before the stedfast and piercing
eye of integrity; is ever looking around
him with anxious and fearful circums∣pec∣tion,
and thinking of subterfuges, by
which he may escape from danger. The
one is <HI>bold as a lion;</HI> the other <HI>flieth when
no man pursueth.</HI> To the one, nothing ap∣pears
contemptible, by which he can pro∣cure
any present advantage. The other
looks with disdain on whatever would de∣grade
his character. “ I will not, ” says
he, “ so demean myself, as to catch the
favour of the greatest man, by this or
that low art. It shall not be said or
thought of me, that I did what was base
in order to make my fortune. Let o∣thers
stoop so low, who cannot be with∣out
the favours of the world. But I
can want them, and therefore at such a
price I will not purchase them. ” This
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>
is the voice of true liberty; and speaks
that greatness of mind which it is formed
to inspire.</P>
<P>Corresponding to that abject disposition
which characterises a bad man, are the
fears that haunt him. The terrors of a
slave dwell on his mind, and often appear
in his behaviour. For guilt is never free
from suspicion and alarm. The sinner
is afraid, sometimes, of the partners of his
crimes, lest they betray him; sometimes,
of those who have suffered by his crimes,
lest they revenge themselves; frequently,
of the world around him, lest it detect
him; and what is worst of all, he is re∣duced
to be afraid of himself There is
a witneses within him that testifies against
his misdeeds; and threatens him in se∣cret,
when other alarms leave him. Con∣science
holds up to his view the image of
his past crimes, with this inscription en∣graved
upon it, “ <HI>God will bring every
work into judgement.</HI> ” How opposite is
such a state as this, to the peaceful secu∣rity
arising from the liberty enjoyed by
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
the virtuous?—Were there nothing
more in the circumstances of sinners to
affix upon them the marks of servitude,
this alone would be sufficient, that, as the
scripture expresses it, <HI>through fear of death
they are all their lifetime subject to bondage</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 15.</NOTE>.
Death sets all other captives free. The
slave who digs in the mine, or labours
at the oar, can rejoice in the prospect of
laying down his burden together with
his life; and tastes the hope of being at
last on equal terms with his cruel oppres∣sor.
But to the slave of guilt there arises
no hope from death. On the contrary,
he is obliged to look forward with con∣stant
terror to his most certain of all
events, as the conclusion of all his hopes
and the commencement of his greatest
miseries.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus set before you such clear
and unequivocal marks of the servitude
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>
undergone by sinners, as fully verify the
assertion in the text, that a state of vice
and corruption is a state of bondage. In
order to perceive how severe a bondage
it is, let us attend to some peculiar cir∣cumstances
of aggravation which belong to
it.</P>
<P>First, It is a bondage to which the mind
itself, the native seat of liberty, is subject∣ed.
In other cases, a brave man can
comfort himself with reflecting that, let
tyrants do their worst, let prisons or fet∣ters
be his lot, his mind remains uncon∣quered
and free. Of this liberty they
cannot rob him; here he moves in a high∣er
sphere, above the reach of oppression or
confinement. But what avails the show
of external liberty, to one who has lost
the government of himself? As our Sa∣viour
reasons, in another case, <HI>If the light
that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness?</HI> So we may reason here, if that
part of thy nature, thy mind, thy will,
by which only thou canst enjoy and re∣lish
liberty, be itself in bondage to evil
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
passions and habits, how miserable must
be that bondage?</P>
<P>Next, It is aggravated by this conside∣ration,
that it is a bondage which we have
brought upon ourselves. To have been
forced into slavery, is misfortune and mi∣sery.
But to have renounced our liberty
and chosen to be slaves, is the greatest re∣proach
added to the greatest misery. Mo∣ments
there frequently must be, when a
sinner is sensible of the degradation of his
state; when he feels with pain the slavish
dependence under which heis is brought to
fortune and the world, to violent passions
and settled habits, and to fears and ap∣prehensions
arising from conscious guilt.
In such moments, how cruel is the reflec∣tion,
that of all this disgrace and misery
he has been the author to himself; that
by voluntary compliance, he has given to
his passions that haughty ascendant which
they now exercise over him; has forged
the chains with which he bound; and
sold himself to do iniquity!</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="229"/>
Lastly, The servitude of vice is accom∣panied
with this farther aggravation, that
it is subjection to our own servants. Those
desires and passions, which the sinner has
raised to lawless rule, were given us as
instruments of self-preservation; but were
plainly designed to be under the direction
of a higher power. Of themselves, they
are headstrong and blind; they bear all
the marks of intended subordination; and
conscience is invested with every en∣sign
of authority and supremacy. But
sin inverts the whole frame of human na∣ture.
It compels reason to bow down
before those passions which it was formed
to command; and leads it, as it were in
triumph, to grace the shameful conquest
of its ministers and servants. It has been
always observed that none are so insolent
in power, as they who have usurped an
authority to which they had no right;
and so it is found to hold in this instance.
The desires and passions of a vitious man,
having once obtained an unlimited sway,
trample him under their feet. They
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
make him feel that he is subject to divers,
and contradictory as well as imperious
masters, who often pull him different
ways. His soul is rendered the recep∣tacle
of many repugnant and jarring dis∣postions;
and resembles some barbar∣ous
country, cantoned out into different
principalities, who are continually waging
war on one another.—Such is the state
into which sinners have brought them∣selves,
in order to be free from the suppos∣ed
confinement of virtue. Where they
had promised themselves nothing but ease
and pleasure, they are made to experience
restraints more severe, and mortifications
more painful, than any which they would
have undergone under the discipline of
religion.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be contended by some,
that although the representation which
has now been given of the slavery of sin
holds true in certain instances, yet that
it is applicable only to those who come
under the description of atrocious sinners.
They imagine that a certain moderate
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
course may be held in vice, by means of
which, men, without throwing altogether
aside the restraints of reason, may enjoy
as easy and pleasurable life.—By rea∣soning
thus, my friends, you flatter and
deceive yourselves to your own destruc∣tion.
Be assured, that, by every vitious
indulgence, you are making an approach
to a state of complete slavery; you are
forfeiting a certain share of your liber∣ty;
how soon the whole of it may be for∣feited,
you are not aware. It is true that
all which has now been said of the servi∣tude
of sin, applies only to a character cor∣rupted
in the extreme. But, remember
that to this extreme no man ever arrives
at once. He passes through many of
those intermediate stages, in one of which
you are now perhaps found. Vice al∣ways
creeps by degrees; and insensibly
twines around us those concealed fetters
by which we are at last completely bound.
—As you value therefore your liberty
and your happiness, avoid every approach
to evil. Consider all vitious pleasures as
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
enchanted ground, by entering on which,
you will be farther and farther ensnared
within the magic circle, till at length you
are precluded from all retreat. The most
pure and virtuous man is always the
freest. The religion of Christ is justly
entitled the <HI>perfect law of liberty</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 25.</NOTE>. It is
only when the <HI>Son makes us free, that we
are free indeed:</HI> and it was with reason
the Psalmist said, <HI>I will walk at liberty,
for i seek thy precepts</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxix. 45.</NOTE></P>

<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
All external services, which have not this
tendency, are entirely insignificant. They
degenerate into mere superstition, equally
unacceptable to God, and unprofitable to
man. Hence they are so often treated in
scripture with high contempt, when sub∣stituted
in the room of the important du∣ties
of a virtuous life.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, it is certain that
external services have their own place,
and a considerable one too, in the system
of religion. What their proper place is no
one can be at a loss to discern, who will
only make a just distinction between the
means, and the end, in religion. It is
evident there is danger of mens erring
here, either on one side or other; and it
is certain that they have erred on both.
After it was observed, that mankind were
prone to lay too much weight on the ex∣ternal
parts of religion, it began to be
thought, that no weight was to be allowed
to them at all. The time was, when all
religion centered in attending the duties
of the church, and paying veneration to
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
whatever was accounted sacred. This alon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sanctified the character, and compensated
every blemish in moral conduct. From
this extreme, the spirit of the age seems to
be running fast into the opposite extreme, of
holding every thing light that belongs to
public worship. But if superstition be an
evil, and a very great one it undoubtedly
is, irreligion is not a smaller evil: And
though the <HI>form of godliness</HI> may often
remain, when <HI>the power</HI> of it is wanting;
yet the <HI>power</HI> cannot well subsist where
the <HI>form</HI> is altogether gone.—The holy
Psalmist, whose words are now before us,
discovers much better principles. Ex∣pressing
always the highest regard for the
laws of God, and the precepts of virtue,
he breathes, at the same time, a spirit of
pure devotion. Though loaded with the
cares of royalty, and encircled with the
splendor of a court, he thought it well be∣came
him to show respect to the great
Lord of nature; and on many occasions
expresses, as he does in the text, his de∣light
in the public service of the temple.
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>
<HI>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy
house, and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.</HI> In discoursing from which words
I purpose to show the importance of the
public worship of God, and the benefits
resulting from it. I shall consider it in
three lights; as it respects God; as it re∣spects
the world; as it respects ourselves.</P>
<P>I. LET us consider it with respect to
God. If there exist a Supreme Being,
the Creator of the world, no consequence
appears more natural and direct than this,
that he ought to be worshipped by his crea∣tures,
with every outward expression of
submission and honour. We need only
appeal to every man's heart, whether this
be not a principle which carries along
with it its own obligation, that to Him
who is the Fountain of our life, and the
Father of our mercies; to Him who has
raised up that beautiful structure of the
universe in which we dwell, and where
we are surrounded with so many bles∣sings
and comforts; solemn acknowledge∣ments
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
of gratitude should be made, prai∣ses and
prayers should be offered, and all
suitable marks of dependence on him be ex∣pressed.
—This obligation extends beyond
the silent and secret sentiments of our
hearts. Besides private devotion, it na∣turally
leads to associations for public wor∣ship;
to open and declared professions of
respect for the Deity. Where blessings
are received in common, jointly to ac∣knowledge
them. Sincere gratitude is al∣ways
of open and diffusive nature. It
loves to pour itself forth; to give free vent
to its emotions; and, before the world,
to acknowledge and honour a Benefactor.</P>
<P>So consonant is this to the natural sen∣timents
of mankind, that all the nations
of the earth have, as with one consent,
agreed to institute some forms of worship;
to hold meetings, at certain times, in ho∣nour
of their deities. Survey the socie∣ties
of men in their rudest state; explore
the African desarts, the wilds of America,
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
of the distant islands of the ocean; and
you will find that over all the earth some
religious ceremonies have obtained. You
will every where trace, in one form or o∣ther,
the temple, the priest, and the offer∣ing.
The prevalence of the most absurd
superstitions furnishes this testimony to
the truth, that in the hearts of all men
the principle is engraved, of worship being
due to that invisible Power who rules the
world.—Herein consists the great excel∣lency
of Christian religion, that it hath
instructed us in the simple and spiritual
nature of that worship. Disencumbered
of idle and unmeaning ceremonies, its ri∣tual
is pure, and worthy of a divine Au∣thor.
Its positive institutions are few in
number, most significant of spiritual
things, and directly conducive to good
life and practice. How inexcusable then
are we, if, placed in such happy circum∣stances,
the sense of those obligations to
the public worship of God shall be oblite∣rated
among us, which the light of nature
<PB N="230" REF="239"/>
inculcated, in some measure, on the most
wild and barbarous nations?</P>
<P>The refinements of false philosophy
have indeed suggested this shadow of ob∣jection,
that God is too great to stand in
need of any external service from his crea∣tures;
that our expressions of praise and
honour are misplaced with respect to him,
who is above all honour and all praise;
that in his sight the homage we seek to
pay must appear contemptible; and is
therefore in itself superfluous and trif∣fling.
—But who hath taught those vain
reasoners, that all expressions of gratitude
and honour towards a superior become
unsuitable, merely because that superior
needs not any returns? Were they ever
indebted to one whose favours they had
it not in their power to repay; and, did
they, on that account, feel themselves set
loose from every obligation to acknow∣ledge,
and to praise their benefactor? On
the contrary, the more disinterested his
beneficence was, did not gratitude, in any
ingenuous mind, burn with the greater
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
ardour, and prompt them the more eager∣ly
to seize every opportunity of publicly
testifying the feelings of their hearts?—Almighty
God, it is true, is too great to
need our service or homage. But he is
also too good not to accept it, when it is
the native expression of a grateful and ge∣nerous
mind. If pride and self-sufficien∣cy
stiffle all sentiments of dependance on
our Creator; if levity, and attachment to
worldly pleasures, render us totally ne∣glectful
of expressing our thankfulness to
Him for his blessings; do we not hereby
discover such a want of proper feeling,
such a degree of hardness and corruption
in our affections, as shows us to be im∣moral
and unworthy; and must justly ex∣pose
us to the high displeasure of heaven?
On the contrary, according to every no∣tion
which we can form of the Father of
the universe, must it not be acceptable
to him to behold his creatures properly
affected in heart towards their great bene∣factor;
assembling together to express, in
acts of worship, that gratitude, love, and
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
reverence which they own him; and thus
nourishing and promoting in one another
an affectionate sense of his goodness? Are
not such dispositions, and such a behavi∣our
as this, intimately connected with all
virtue?</P>
<P><HI>O Come, let us worship and bow down;
let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For
he is our God; and we are the flock of his
pasture. Enter into his gates with thanks∣giving
and his courts with praise. The pray∣er
of the upright in his delight. It cometh be∣fore
him as incense, and the uplifting of their
hands as the evening sacrifice.</HI>—Having
thus shown the reasonableness of public
worship with respect to God, let us now,</P>
<P>II. CONSIDER its importance in another
view, as it respects the world. When we
survey the general state of mankind, we
find them continually immersed in world∣ly
affairs; busied about providing the ne∣cessaries
of life, occupied in the pursuits
of their pleasures, or eagerly prosecuting
the advancement of their interests. In
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
such a situation of things, a small mea∣sure
of reflexion might convince any one,
that without some returns of sacred days,
and some solemn calls to public worship,
it were impossible to preserve in the
world any sense of objects, so foreign to
the general current of thought as an in∣visible
Governor, and a future state. If it
be of importance to the peace and good
order of society, that there should prevail
among men the belief of One in the hea∣vens,
who is the protector of righteousness
and the avenger of crimes; if it be of im∣portance
that they be taught to look for∣ward
to a day of judgement, when they
are to be brought to account for their
most secret actions, and eternally reward∣ed
or punished, according as their con∣duct
has been good or evil; if such prin∣ciples
as these, I say, be of consequence
to the public welfare, they certainly en∣force
the authority of public worship,
and prove the necessity of religious in∣struction.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="243"/>
I speak now particularly with a view
to the multitude, the great mass and body
of the people. We all know, how seldom
from education, or private instruction,
they have the advantage of deriving sen∣timents
of religion or morality. Early
obliged to labour for their bread, they
would remain all their days in gross igno∣rance
of every moral or sacred principle,
were it not for those public assemblies in
which they hear of God, and Christ, and
judgement, and heaven and hell. Shut
up those temples to which they resort
with reverence; exclude them from the
opportunities they now possess of receiv∣ing
religious instruction, and imbibing
religious ideas; and what can you expect
them to become? no other than a feroci∣ous
rabble, who set free from checks of
conscience, and fears of divine vengeance,
would be prone to every outrage which
they could commit with impunity. It is
well known that, in the early ages of the
world, sages and legislators who endea∣voured
to tame and to associate the bar∣barous
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
hordes of men, found it necessary
for this purpose, to have recourse to reli∣gion.
By bringing the rude multitudes to
worship together, and at stated times and
places, to join in hymns and songs to their
deities, they gradually restrained them from
violence, and trained them to subordina∣tion
and civilized life.</P>
<P>During the progress of society in after
periods, religious assemblies at church con∣tinue,
I am persuaded, to have a very con∣siderable
influence on the civilization and
improvement of the people. Even inde∣pendent
of effect upon their moral princi∣ples,
by leading numbers of them to meet to∣gether
in an orderly way, and in their most
decent appearance, they tend to humanize
and polish their manners. They strength∣en
the social connections, and promote
friendly intercourse among those who are
in the same neighbourhood, and in the
same lines of life. It must at the same
time, be agreeable to every humane mind
to think, that one day in seven is allotted
for rest to the poor from their daily la∣bours,
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
and for such enjoyments of ease
and comfort as their station affords.
It is the only day which gives them oc∣casion
to feel themselves as belonging
to the same class of beings with their su∣periors;
when joining with them in the
same acts of worship, and recognizing
a common Lord. Amidst those dis∣tinctions
which the difference of ranks
necessarily introduces into human society,
it is surely fit that there be some occasions
when man can meet with man as a bro∣ther,
in order that the pride of the great
may be checked; and the low may be
taught that, if they discharge properly
their appointed part, they have reason to
expect, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord of the universe, the
same rewards with the rich and the
mighty.</P>
<P>It will, I believe, be generally admit∣ted
that forms of public worship, and
means of religious instruction, are impor∣tant,
on several accounts, for the body of
the people, and belong to the maintenance
of public safety and order. But many
<PB N="237" REF="246"/>
who admit this are apt to think, that to
the common people alone they may be
left. To persons of liberal education and
enlarged minds, what benefit can arise
from hearing what they already know;
and what, perhaps, is to be inculcated on
them by those who are of inferior capaci∣ty
to themselves?—Admitting this plea
of superiority which their vanity forms,
and setting aside for the present any per∣sonal
obligation they are under to wor∣ship
God, I must ask such persons, how
they can expect that religious assemblies
will be long respected by the lower ranks
of men, if by men of rank and education
they are discountenanced and forsaken?
Do not they know, that those lower ranks
are ready to copy the manners, and to
follow the example of their superiors in
all things; but assuredly in nothing more,
than in what appears to set them free
from restraint, and to gratify licentious∣ness?
While they acknowledge the impor∣tance,
and even the necessity, of public re∣ligion
to certain classes of men, do they,
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
nevertheless, contribute by their beha∣viour
to defeat the end of public religion,
and to annihilate that importance which
they ascribe to it?—They are employ∣ed
in framing laws and statutes for pre∣venting
crimes, and keeping the disorder∣ly
multitude within bounds; and at the
same time, by personally discountenan∣cing
public worship, they are weakening,
they are even abolishing, among the mul∣titutde,
that moral restraint, which is of
more general influence upon manners
than all the laws they frame. In vain
they complain of the dishonesty of
servants, of the insolence of mobs,
of the attacks of the highwayman.
To all these disorders they have them∣selves
been accessory. By their open dis∣regard
of sacred institutions, they have
disseminated profligacy among the peo∣ple.
They have broken down the flood∣gates
which served to restrain the torrent;
they have let it loose to overflow the land;
and by the growing deluge may them∣selves
be swept away.—But I must next ar∣gue
upon a different ground; and proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="248"/>
III. To set forth the importance of the
public worship of God to every individu∣al,
in every rank of life. Whatever his
station be, he is still a man; and has the
duties of a man to perform. Were his
attendance on divine worship of no other
effect, than to add countenance to a salu∣tary
institution, this alone would render
it his duty. But moreover, we assert it to
be his duty on his own account; if it be
the duty of every man to use the proper
means of preserving and fortifying his
virtue. All the Christian institutions have
a direct tendency to this end. They all
serve to give warmth to piety, and to add
solemnity to moral virtue. A very high
opinion, indeed, that man must have of
his own character, who imagines that, a∣midst
all the follies and corruptions of the
world, he stands in need of no assistance
for enabling him to act his part with pro∣priety
and dignity.</P>
<P>The question is not, whether persons of
rank and education are to learn any thing
that is new to them, by frequenting the
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
places of public worship. The great prin∣ciples
of piety and morality are obvious
and easily known; and we shall readily
admit, that there are many to whom no
new instruction is communicated in the
house of God. But, my friends, the pur∣pose
of your going there is to have known
truths recalled to your mind, and their
dormant influence awakened; is to have
serious meditations suggested; to have
good dispositions raised; to have the heart
adjusted to a composed and tranquil
frame. Is there any man of reason and
reflection, who will not acknowledge such
effects, as far as they follow from attend∣ance
on religious ordinances, to be of the
most beneficial nature? These occasional
cessations from the cares and anxieties of
life, these interruptions to the bustle and
the passions of the world, in order to think
and hear of eternity, are both a relief and
an improvement to the mind. By this re∣treat
from its ordinary circle of thoughts,
it is enabled to return, with more clearness
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
and more vigour, to the business of the
world, after a serious and proper pause.</P>
<P>But I think must ask the persons with whom
I now reason, whether there be no other
call to come to God's house, than to hear
instruction there? Is not the devout ado∣ration
of the God of heaven the principal
object of our religious assemblies; and is
this what any man of reflection, and of
sober mind, dare to make light of? In the
temple of the Lord, the rich and the poor,
the prince and the peasant, appear as sup∣pliants
alike for the protection and favour
of the Almighty.—Great and flourishing
as thou mayst think thyself, know that
thou standest as much in need of that
protection, as the meanest of the crowd
whom thou beholdest worshipping, with
lowly reverence, the God of their fathers.
The sun of prosperity shines at present on
thy head, and the favourable gale carries
thee softly along the stream of life. But
the Almighty needs only to give the word,
and instantly the tempest shall rise; and
they frail bark shall be driven into the o∣cean,
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
and whelmed in the deep. <HI>In my
prosperity I said I shall never be moved.
Thou, Lord, didst hide thy face, and I was
troubled.</HI>—Look up, with dread, to that aw∣ful
hand of providence which is stretched
over your heads. Remember the instabi∣lity
of all human things; Remember it,
and tremble, ye who despise the devout
acknowledgement of Him who disposes of
the human fate! <HI>Though ye live many years
and rejoice in them all, remember the days of
darkenss; for they shall be many</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>But after all that has been urged on this
subject, I am sensible it may be objected,
that many who make conscience of pay∣ing
strict regard to the institutions of re∣ligion,
do not appear to have derived much
benefit from them. They are not, it will
be said, more improved in moral conduct,
and in the proper discharge of the several
duties of life, than others who have been
apparently negligent of the services of the
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
church. On the contrary, a formal re∣gard
to these appears to be su∣stituted by
many, in the room of the weightier mat∣ters
of the law.—Though this should be
admitted, it goes no farther than to show
that human weakness, or corruption, may
defeat the purpose of the most promising
means of moral improvement. That a
superstitious attention to external worship,
has too often usurped the character, and
supplanted the place of real virtue, willl
not be denied. Admonitions against so
dangerous an error cannot be given too
often. But because the best things have
been often misapplied and abused, no ar∣gument
thence arises for their being un∣dervalued,
and thrown aside. So also rea∣son,
instruction, and discipline of every
kind, have been frequently perverted to
bad ends; and yet their intrinsic worth
and usefulness remain untouched and ac∣knowledged.
—Besides this, it cannot be
admitted that, because religious institu∣tions
produce not all the good that might
be wished, and hoped for, they therefore
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
do no good at all. This were a rash and
ill-founded conclusion. If the morals of
men are not always amended by them as
they ought to have been, there is reason,
however, to think that they would have
been worse without them. Some check
is always given by them to open profliga∣cy.
Some assistance is furnished to good
dispositions of heart; at least, to decency
of manners. Even momentary impres∣sions
of seriousness made on the thoughtless
by the solemnities of religion, are not
without their fruit. They leave general∣ly
some trace behind them; and when the
traces are often renewed, they may be
hoped, through the divine blessing, to
form at last a deep impression on the
mind.</P>
<P>At the same time, I do not say that re∣ligious
institutions work upon the mind
like a charm; and that mere bodily at∣tendance
on them will always ensure us
of some profitable effect. Let the means
that are employed, for the improvement
of rational beings, be ever so powerful in
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
themselves, much of their success will al∣ways
depend on the manner in which
they are received and applied. I shall
therefore conclude my reasonings on this
subject, with a few observations concerning
the dispositions requisite on our part, for
deriving benefit from the public ordinan∣ces
of religion.</P>
<P>THE ends for which we assemble in the
house of God are two; to worship God,
and to listen to religious instructions.</P>
<P>The public worship of God is the chief
and most sacred purpose of every religious
assembly of Christians. Let it here be re∣membered,
that it is not the uttering, or
the hearing of certain words, that consti∣tutes
the worship of the Almighty. It is
the heart that praises, or prays. If the
heart accompany not the words that are
spoken or heard, we <HI>offer the sacrifice of
fools.</HI> By the inattentive thought, and the
giddy and wandering eye, we profane the
temple of the Lord, and turn the appear∣ance
of devotion into insult and mockery.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="255"/>
With regard to religious instruction, at∣tention
and reverence are unquestionably
due. All religious and moral knowledge
comes from God. It is a light from hea∣ven,
first transmitted to man by the ori∣ginal
constitution of his nature, and after∣wards
made to shine with fairer and fuller
lustre by the revelation of the gospel in
Jesus Christ. Its brightness may some∣times
be stronger, and sometimes weaker,
according to the mediums by which it is
conveyed. But still, as far as the instruc∣tions
delivered from the pulpit are illu∣minated
by the ray from heaven, they
are the truths of God, and ought to be re∣ceived
as such. Refinements of vain phi∣losophy,
or intricate subtilities of theologu∣cal
controversy, are undoubtedly not en∣titled
to such regard. But when the great
principles of natural or revealed religion
are discussed; when the important doc∣trines
of the gospel concerning the life,
and sufferings, and death of our blessed Re∣deemer
are displayed; or useful instruc∣tions
regarding the regulation of life, and
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
the proper dispcharge of our several duties,
are the subjects brought into view; it is
not then the human speaker, but the di∣vine
authority that is to be regarded.</P>
<P>In the speaker, many imperfections and
infirmities may be discovered. The disco∣veries
of the gospel are represented in
the scripture, as a hidden treasure brought to
light; but, by the appointment of God,
<HI>we have this treasure in earthen vessels</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. Corinth. 4. 7.</NOTE>.
It is not the spirit of curiosity that ought
to bring us to church. Too often, it is to
be feared, we assemble there merely as
critics on the preacher; critics on his sen∣timents,
his language, and his delivery.
But, such are not the disositions which
become us on so serious an occasion. It
is with humility, with fairness, and can∣dour,
with an intention to improve our∣selves
in piety and virtue, with a view to
make personal application to our own cha∣racter,
that we ought to hear the word of
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
God.—When we enter the sacred tem∣ple,
let us ever consider ourselves as crea∣tures
surrounded with darkness, seeking
illumination from heaven; as guilty crea∣tures,
imploring forgiveness from our
judge; as frail and mortal creatures, pre∣paring
for that eternal habitation into
which we know not how soon we are to
pass.</P>
<P>IF, with such sentiments and impres∣sions
we join in the worship of God, and
the ordinances of religion, we may justly
hope that they shall be accompanied to us
with the divine blessing. It is the express
precept of God, <HI>not to forsake the assembling
of ourselves together</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10. 25.</NOTE>. <HI>Gather together the
people, men, women, and children, that they
may hear, and that they may learn, and fear
the Lord your God, and observe to do all
the words of this law</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxi. 12.</NOTE>. <HI>Enter his gates
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
with thanksgiving, and his courts with
praise. Give unto the Lord the glory due to
his name.</HI>—Thus hath God commanded,
and he never commanded his people to
seek his name in vain. For, <HI>where two or
three are gathered together in his name, our
Lord hath told us that he is in the midst of
them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 20.</NOTE>. <HI>God hath said that he loveth the
gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ps. lxxxvii. 2.</NOTE>. <HI>The prayer of the upright is his
delight.</HI> Both in their temporal and spi∣ritual
concerns, they may be most expected
to prosper, who can say with the Psalmist
in the text, <HI>Lord I have loved the habita∣tion
by thy house, and the palce where thine
honour dwelleth.</HI></P>

the same time one of the most difficult
lessons which religion teaches. By so man∣ny
desires and passions we are connected
with the objects around us, that our at∣tachment
to them is always in hazard of
becoming excessive and sinful. Hence re∣ligion
is often employed in moderating
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
this attachment, by rectifying our errone∣ous
opinions, and instructing us in the
proper value we ought to set on worldly
things. Such was particularly the scope
of the Apostle in this context. He is put∣ting
the Corinthians in mind that their
<HI>time is short;</HI> that every thing here is tran∣sitory;
and therefore, that in all the diffe∣rent
occupations of human life, in <HI>weep∣ing</HI>
and <HI>rejoicing,</HI> and <HI>buying</HI> and <HI>possessing,</HI>
they were ever to keep in view this con∣sideration,
that <HI>the fashion of this world pas∣seth
away.</HI> The original expression im∣ports,
the figure or form under which the
world presents itself to us. The meaning
is, All that belongs to this visible state is
continually changing. Nothing in hu∣man
affairs is fixed or stable. All is in
motion and fluctuation; altering its ap∣pearance
every moment, and passing into
some new form. Let us meditate for a
little on the serious view which is here
given us of the world, in order that we
may attend to the improvements which
is suggests.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="261"/>
I. <HI>The fashion of the world passeth away,</HI>
as the opinions, ideas, and manners of
men are always changing. We look in
vain for a standard to ascertain and fix
any of these; in vain expect that what
has been approved and established for a
while, is always to endure. Principles
which were of high authority among our
ancestors are now exploded. Systems of
philosophy which were once universally
received, and taught as infallible truths,
are now obliterated and forgotten. Modes
of living behaving, and employing time,
the pursuits of the busy, and the enter∣tainments
of the gay, have been entirely
changed. They were the offspring of
fashion, the children of a day. When
they had run their course, they expired;
and were succeeded by other modes of
living, and thinking, and acting, which
the gloss of novelty recommended for a
while to the public taste.</P>
<P>When we read an account of the man∣ners
and occupations, of the studies and
opinions, even of our own countrymen,
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
in some remote age, we seem to be read∣ing
the history of a different world from
what we now inhabit. Coming down∣wards
through some generations, a new
face of things appears. Men begin to
think, and act, in a different train; and
what we call refinement gradually opens.
Arriving at our own times, we consider
ourselves as having widely enlarged the
sphere of knowledge on every side, hav∣ing
formed just ideas on every sub∣ject;
having attained the proper standard
of manners and behaviour; and wonder
at the ignorance, the uncouthness, and
rusticity of our forefathers. But, alas!
what appears to us so perfect shall in its
turn pass away. The next race, while
they shove us off the stage, will introduce
their favourite discoveries and innova∣tions;
and what we now admire as the
height of improvement, may in a few ages
hence be considered as altogether rude and
imperfect. As one wave effaces the ridge
which the former had made on the sand
by the sea shore, so every succeeding age
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
obliterates the opinions and modes of the
age which had gone before it. <HI>The fashion
of the world</HI> is ever passing away.</P>
<P>Let us only think of the changes which
our own ideas and opinions undergo in
the progress of life. One man differs not
more from another, than the same man
varies from himself in different periods,
of his age, and in different situations of
fortune. In youth, and in opulence, eve∣ry
thing appears smiling and gay. We
fly as on the wings of fancy; and survey
beauties wherever we cast our eye. But
let some more years have passed over our
heads, or let disappointments in the world
have depressed our spirits; and what a
change takes place? The pleasing illusions
that once shone before us; the splendid
fabrics that imagination had reared; the
enchanting maze in which we once wan∣dered
with delight, all vanish and are for∣gotten.
The world itself remains the
same. But its for, its appearance, and
aspect, is changed to our view; its <HI>fashion,</HI>
as to us, hath <HI>passed away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="264"/>
II. WHILE our opinions and ideas are
thus changing within, the condition of
all external things is, at the same time,
ever changing without us, and around us.
Wherever we cast our eyes over the face
of nature, or the monuments of art, we
discern the marks of alteration and vicissi∣tude.
We cannot travel far upon the
earth, without being presented with many
a striking memorial of the changes made
by time. What was once a flourishing
city, is now a neglected village. Where
castles and palaces stood, fallen towers
and ruined walls appear. Where the mag∣nificence
of the great shone, and the mirth
of the gay resounded, there, as the prophet
Isaiah describes, <HI>the owl and the raven now
dwell, thorns come up, and the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle and the
bramble grow in the courts.</HI>—When we
read the history of nations, what do we
read but the history of incessant revolution
and change? We behold kingdoms alter∣nately
rising and falling; peace and war
taking place by turns; princes, heroes,
and statesmen, coming forth in succession
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
on the stage, attracting our attention for
a little by the splended figure they make,
and then disappearing and forgotten. We
see the <HI>fashion of the world</HI> assuming all its
different forms, and in all of them, <HI>passing
away.</HI></P>
<P>But to historical annals there is no oc∣casion
for our having recourse. Let any
one, who has made some progress in life,
recollect only what he has beheld passing
before him, in his own time. We have
seen our country rise triumphant among
the nations; and we have seen it also
humbled in its turn. We have seen in
one hemisphere of the globe new do∣nions
acquired, and in another hemi∣sphere,
our old dominions lost. At
home, we have seen factions and par∣ties
shift through all their different
forms; and administrations, in succession,
rise and fall.. What were once the great
themes of eager discussion, and political
contest, are now forgotten. Fathers re∣count
them to their children as the tal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of other times. New actors have come
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
forth on the stage of the world. New ob∣jects
have attracted the attention, and new
intrigues engaged the passions of men.
New members fill the seats of justice; new
ministers the temples of religion; and a
new world, in short, in the course of a
few years, has gradually and insensibly
risen around us.</P>
<P>When from the public scene we turn
our eye to our own private connections,
the changes which have taken place in the
<HI>fashion of the world,</HI> must touch every
reflecting mind with a more tender sensi∣bility.
For where are now, many of the
companions of our early years; many
of those with whom we first began the
race of life; and whose hopes and pro∣spects
were once the same with our
own? In recollecting our old acquaintance
and friends, what devastations have been
made by the hand of time? On the ru∣ins
of our former connections, new ones
have arisen; new relations have been
formed; and the circle of those among
whom we live is altogether changed from
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
what it once was. Comparing our pre∣sent
situation with our former condition
of life; looking back to our father's house,
and to the scenes of youth; remembering
the friends by whom we were trained,
and the family in which we grew up; who,
but with inward emotion, recollects those
days of former years, and is disposed to
drop the silent tear, when he views the
<HI>fashion of the world</HI> thus always <HI>passing a∣way!</HI></P>
<P>III. NOT only our connections with all
things around us change, but our own
life, through all its stages and conditions,
is ever passing away. How just, and how
affecting is that image, employed in the
sacred writings to describe the state of
man, <HI>we spend our years as a tale that is
told</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc. 9.</NOTE>! It is not to any thing great or
lasting that human life is compared; not
to a monument that is built, or t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an in∣scription
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
that is engraved; not even to a
book that is written, or to a history that is
recorded; but to a <HI>tale,</HI> which is listened
to for a little; where the words are fu∣gitive
and passing, and where one incident
suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eds and hangs on another, till, by in∣sensible
transitions, we are brought to the
close; <HI>a tale,</HI> which in some passages may
be amusing, in others, tedious; but whe∣ther
it amuses or fatigues, is soon told,
and soon forg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. Thus, year steals up∣on
us after year. Life is never standing
still for a moment; but continually, though
insensibly, sliding into a new form. Infancy
ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es up fast to childhood; childhood to
youth; youth pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s quickly into manhood;
and the grey hair and the faded look are not
long of admonishing us, that old age is at
hand. In this course all generations run.
The world is made up of unceasing rounds
of transitory existence. Some generations
are coming forward into being, and others
hastening to leave it. The stream which
carries us all along is ever flowing with a
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
quick current, though with a still and
noisel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss course. The dwelling place o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
man is continually emptying, and by a
fresh succession of inhabitants, continually
filling anew. <HI>The memory of man pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th
away, like the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>membrance of a gues<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hath tarried but one night.</HI></P>
<P>As the life of man, considered in its du∣ration,
thus fleets and passes away, so du∣ring
the time it lasts, its condition is p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣petually
changing. It affords us nothing
on which we can set up our rest; no en∣joyment
or possession which we can pro∣perly
call our own. When we have be∣gun
to be placed in such circumstances
as we desired, and wish our lives to pro∣ceed
in the same agreeable tenor, how o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ten
comes some unexpected event across,
to disconcert all our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chemes of happin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss?
Our health declines; our friends die; our
families are scattered; something or other
is not long of occurring, to show us that
the wheel must turn round; <HI>the fashion of
the world</HI> must <HI>pass away.</HI> Is there any
man who dare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to look to futurity with
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
an eye of confident hope; and to say, that
against a year hence, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie can promise be∣ing
in the same condition of health or for∣tune,
as he is at present? The seeds of
change are every where sown in our state;
and the very causes that seemed to pro∣mise
u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>curity, are often secretly under∣mining
it. Great fame provokes the at∣tacks
of envy and reproach. High health
gives occasion to intemperance anddisease.
The elevation of the mighty never fails
to render their condition tottering; and
that obscurity which sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lters the mean,
exposes them, at the same time, to become
the prey of oppression. So completely
is the <HI>fashion of this world</HI> made by Provi∣dence
for change, and prepared for <HI>passing
away.</HI> In the midst of this instability, it
were some comfort, did human prosperity
decay as slowly as it ris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. By <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low de∣grees,
and by many intervening st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps, it
rises. But one day is sufficient to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at∣ter,
and bring it to nought. I might
add,</P>

existence, and their place is no more to be
found.</P>
<P>I SHALL insist no longer on this repre∣sentation
of things. Enough has been
said, to show that the <HI>fashion of the world,</HI>
in every sense, <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses</HI> away. Opinions and
manners, public affairs and private con∣cerns,
the life of man, the conditions of
fortune, and the earth itself on which we
dwell, are all changing around us.—Is
every thing, then, with which we are
connected, passing and transitory? Is the
whole state of man no more than a dream
of fleeting vision? Is he brought forth, to
be only the child of a day? Are we thrown
into a river, where all flows, and nothing
stays; where we have no means of resist∣ing
the current; nor can reach any firm
ground, on which to rest our foot?—No,
my brethren; man was not doomed to be
so unhappy; nor made by his Creator so
much in vain. There are three fixed and
permanent objects, to which I must now
call your attention, as the great supports
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
of human constancy amidst this fugitive
state. Though this world changes and
passes away, virtue and goodness never
change; God never changes; heaven and
immortality pass not away.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> VIRTUE and goodness never
change. Let opinions and manners, con∣ditions
and situations, in public and in
private life, alter as they will, virtue is
ever the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame. It rests on the immove∣able
basis of Eternal Truth. Among all
the revolutions of human things it main∣tains
its ground; ever possessing the vene∣ration
and esteem of mankind, and con∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rring
on the heart, which enjoys it, sa∣tisfaction
and peace. Consult the most
remote antiquity. Look to the most sa∣vage
nations of the earth. How wild,
and how fluctuating soever the ideas of
men may have been, this opinion you will
find to have always prevailed, that probi∣ty,
truth, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neficence, form the honour
and the excellency of man. In this, the
philosopher and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avage, the warrior
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
and the hermit, join. At this altar all
have worshipped. Their o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferings may
have been unseemly. Their notions of
virtue may have been rude, and occasion∣ally
tainted by ignorance and supperstition;
but the fundamental ideas of moral worth
have ever remained the same.</P>
<P>Here then is one point of stability, af∣fected
by no vici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>situdes of time and life,
on which we may rest. Our fortunes
may change, and our friends may die;
but virtue may still be our own; and as
long as this remains, we are never misera∣ble.
<HI>Till I die I will not remove my inte∣grity
from me. My righteousness I hold fast,
and will not let it go. My hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall not re∣proach
me so long as I live</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 5, 6.</NOTE>. He who, with
the holy man of old, can hold this language,
may with undisturbed mind survey time
flying away, life decaying, and the whole
fashion of the world changing around him.
He hath within himself, a source of con∣solation
and hope, independent of all earth∣ly
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
objects. Every terrestrial glory spar∣kles
only for a little, with transient bright∣ness.
But virtue shines with eternal and
unalterable splendour. It derives its ori∣gin
from heaven; and partakes both of the
lustre, and the stability, of celestial objects.
<HI>It is the brightness of the everlasting light;
the unspotted mir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or of God, and the image
of his goodness.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, God never changes.
Amidst the unceasing vicissitude of ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th∣ly
things, there remains at the head of
the universe an eternal protector of vir∣tue,
whose <HI>throne is established for ever.</HI>
With him there is <HI>no variableness, neither
any shadow of turning;</HI> no inconstancy of
purpose, and no decay of wisdom or of
power. We know that he loved righte∣ousness
from the beginning of days, and
that he will continue to love it unaltera∣bly
to the last. Foreseen by him was eve∣ry
revolution which the course of ages
has produced. All the changes which
happen in the state of nature, or the life
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
of men, were comprehended in his decree.
How much soever worldly things may
change in themselves, they are all united
in his plan; they constitute one great sys∣tem
or whole, of which he is the Author;
and which, at its final completion, shall
appear to be perfect. His dominion
holds together, in a continued chain, the
successive variety of human events; gives
stability to things that in themselves are
fluctuating; gives constancy even to the
<HI>fashion of the world</HI> while it is <HI>passing away.</HI>
Wherefore, though all things change on
earth, and we ourselves be involved in the
general mutability, yet as long as, with
trust and hope, we look up to this Supreme
Being, we rest on the <HI>rock of ages,</HI> and are
safe amidst every change. We posssess a
fortress to which we can have recourse in
all dangers; a refuge under all storms;
<HI>a dwelling pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce in all generations.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> and last place, heaven and
immortality pass not away. The fleeting
scenes of this life are to be considered as
no more than an introduction to a nobler
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
and more permanent order of things,
when man shall have attained the matu∣rity
of his being. This is what reason
gave some ground to expect; what reve∣lation
has fully con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmed; and in con∣firming
it, has agreed with the sentiments
and anticipations of the good and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in
every age. We are taught to believe, that
what we now behold, is only the first stage
of the life of man. We are arrived no
farther than the threshold; we dwell as in
the outer courts of existence. Here, tents
only are pitched; tabernacles erected for
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ojourners of a day. But in the re∣gion
of eternity, all is great, stable, and un∣changing.
There, the <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> of the just

every thing is in stir and fluctuation;
because here good men continue not, but

There, all is serene, steady and orderly;

<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
by our folly and guilt; and of course
must be transient and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain. But there,
purchased by the death, and secured by the

which is never troubled. There shines that
sun which never sets. There flows that ri∣ver
of pleasures, which is always unru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>led
and pure. Looking forward to those di∣vine
habitations, the changes of the pre∣sent
world disappear to the eye of faith;
and a good man becomes ashamed of suf∣fering
himself to be dejected by what is
so soon to pass away.</P>
<P>SUCH are the objects you ought to op∣pose
to the transient <HI>fashion of the world;</HI>
Virtue, and God, and Heaven. Fixing
your regard on these, you will have no
reason to complain of the lot of man, or
the world's mutability.—The design of
the preceding representation which I gave
of the world, was not to indulge vain de∣clamation;
to raise fruitless melancholy;
or to throw an unnecessary cloud over hu∣man
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
man life. But to show the moderation
requisite in our attachment to the world;
and at the same time, to point out the
higher objects both of attention and con∣solation
which religion affords.—Pass∣ing
and changeable as all human things
are, among them, however, we must at
present act our part; to them we must
return from religious meditation. They
are not below the regard of any Christian;
for they form the scene which providence
has appointed at present for his activity,
and his duty. Trials and dangers they
may often present to him; but amidst
these he will safely hold his course, if,
when engaged in worldly affairs, he keep
in view those divine objects which I have
been setting before him. Let him ever
retain connection with Virtue, and God,
and Heaven. By them let his conduct be
regulated, and his constancy supported.
So shall he <HI>use this world</HI> without <HI>abusing
it.</HI> He shall neither droop under its mis∣fortunes,
nor be vainly elated by its ad∣vantages;
but through all its changes
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
shall carry an equal and steady mind;
and in the end shall receive the accom∣plishment
of the promise of scripture, that

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TRANQUILLITY of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> or, in the
words of the text, a mind <HI>not
moved</HI> or disquieted by the accidents of
life, is undoubtedly one of the greatest
blessings that we can possess on earth.
It is here mentioned as the reward of the
man, whose character had been described
in this psalm, as leading a virtuous life,
and discharging his duty towards God
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
and his neighbour. It is indeed the ulti∣mate
aim, to which the wishes of the wise
and reflecting have ever been directed,
that with a mind undisturbed by anxieties,
cares, and fears, they might pass their
days in a pleasing serenity. They justly
concluded that, by enjoying themselves
in peace, they would enjoy, to the greatest
advantage, all the comforts of life that
came within their reach.</P>
<P>This happy tranquillity, the multitude
conceive to be most readily attainable by
means of wealth, or, at least, of an easy
fortune; which they imagine would set
them above all the ordinary disturbances
of life. That it has some effect for this
purpose, cannot be denied. Poverty and
straitened circumstances are often incon∣sistent
with tranquillity. To be destitute
of those conveniencies that suit our rank
in the world; to be burdened with an∣xiety
about making provision for every
day which passes over our head; instead of
bringing comfort to a family who look
up to us for aid, to behold ourselves sur∣rounded
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
with their wants and com∣plaints,
are circumstances which cannot
fail to give much uneasiness to every feel∣ing
mind. To take measures, therefore,
for attaining a competent fortune, by lau∣dable
means, is wise and proper. Entire
negligence of our affairs, and indifference
about our worldly circumstances, is, for
the most part, the consequence of some
vice, or some folly.—At the same time, I
must observe, that the attainment of opu∣lence
is no certain method of attaining
tranquillity. Embarassments and vexa∣tions
often attend it; and long experience
has shown, that tranquillity is far from be∣ing
always found among the rich. Nay,
the higher that men rise in the world, the
greater degrees of power and distinction
which they acquire, they are often the far∣ther
removed from internal peace. The
world affords so many instances of miseries
abounding in the higher ranks of life,
that it were needless to enlarge on a topic
so generally known and admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284"/>
Assuming it, therefore, for an undoubt∣ed
truth, that the mere poss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of the
goods of fortune may be consistent with
the want of inward tranquillity, we must
look around for other more certain grounds
of it. We must inquire whether any line
of conduct can be pointed out, which, in∣dependent
of external situation in the
world, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tend to make us easy in mind;
shall either bestow, or aid, that tanquilli∣ty
which all men desire. The remaining
part of this discourse shall be employed in
suggesting, with great plainness of speech,
such directions as appear to me most mate∣rial
on this important subject.</P>
<P>THE <HI>first</HI> direction, which I have to sug∣gest,
is, that we imitate the character of the
man who is described in this psalm as
<HI>walking uprightly, working righteousness,
and speaking the truth, as he thinketh in his
heart;</HI> that we study to preserve a clear
conscience, and to lead a virtuous and ho∣nourable,
at least an innoffensive and in∣nocent,
life. Of such a man only it can
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
be said, that <HI>doing these things he shall ne∣ver
be moved.</HI> So great is the power of
conscience over every human being, that
the remembrance of crime<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never fails to
overthrow tranquillity of mind. Be as∣sured,
that he who defrauds his neighbour,
who has ensnared the innocent, has viola∣ted
this trust, or betrayed his friend, shall
never enjoy within himself undisturbed
quiet. His evil deeds will at times recur
to his thoughts, like ghosts rising up
in black array before him to haunt his
couch. Even the sense of a foolish and
trifling conduct, of a life past in idleness
and dissipation; by which, though a man
has not been guilty of great crimes, he
has however wasted his substance, mispent
his time, and brought upon himself just
reproach; even this, I say, is sufficient to
create much uneasiness and disquiet to the
heart. Let him, therefore, who wishes to
enjoy tranquillity, study, above all things,
to act an irreproachable part. With com∣fort
he will rest his head on his pillow at
night, when he is conscious that through∣out
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
the day he has been doing his duty
towards God and man; when none of the
transactions of that day come back, in
painful remembrance, to upbraid him.
To this testimony of a good conscience, let
him be able.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, to join humble trust
in the favour of God. As, after the best
endeavours we can use, no man's beha∣viour
will be entirely faultless, it is essen∣tial
to peace of mind, that we have some
ground for hope in the Divine mercy,
that, through the merits of Jesus Christ,
our defects shall be forgiven, and grace
be shewn us by Heaven. This includes
all the duties of faith and repentance that
are required by the Gospel; the faithful
discharge of which duties is absolutely ne∣cessary
for delivering us from those fears
of another world, which, if not allayed,
are sufficient to banish all tranquillity from
the heart. Our religious principles must
at the same time be sound and pure; and
carefully preserved from the taint of su∣perstition
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
whose gloomy horrors, taking
possession of weak and ill informed minds,
convert what they mistake for religion, in∣to
a source of misery.—Moreover, it is ne∣cessary,
that we be able to place trust in
God, not only as our future Judge, but as
the present Governor of human affairs.
So uncertain is the continuance of every
earthly comfort, that he, who reposes no
confidence in the Supreme Disposer of e∣vents,
must be often disquieted and de∣jected.
He alone possesses firm tranquil∣lity,
who, amidst all human vicissitudes,
looks up, with settled trust, to an almighty
Ruler, as to one under whose conduct he
is safe. To him alone belongs that hap∣py
privilege, described by the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>almist:
<HI>He shall not be a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raid of evil ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings; his
heart is fixed; trusting in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have pointed out the primary and es∣sential
foundations of tranquillity; virtuous
conduct, good principles, and pious dis∣positions.
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
At the same time, a man may
be both pious and virtuous, and yet,
through some defects in the management
of his mind and temper, may not possess
that happy serenity and self-enioyment,
which ought to be the portion of virtue
and piety. Instances of this will occur to
every one who is acquainted with the world.
We too often behold persons, whose prin∣ciples,
and whose moral conduct, are in the
main unexceptionable, leading an uncom∣fortable
life; through fretfulness of temper,
peevishness of manners, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullenness of
disposition. There is, therefore, some dis∣cipline
to be studied; there are some subsi∣diary
parts of character to be attended to,
in order to give piety and virtue their full
effect for conferring tranquillity. To the
consideration of these secondary means I
now proceed. Let me then advise you,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, to attend to the cul∣ture
and improvement of your minds.
A fund of useful knowledge, and a stock
of ideas, afford much advantage for the
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
enjoyment of tranquillity. I do not mean,
that every man must study to become
deeply learned. The situation of many
would not allow it. The taste, and the
habits of others, prevent it. But what I
mean is, that every man who wishes to
lead a comfortable life should provide for
himself, as much as he can, by means of
observation, reading, and reflecting, a
large field of useful thoughts. In a mind
absolutely vacant, tranquillity is seldom
found. The vacancy too often will be
filled up by bad desires and passions.
Whereas, the mind of a wise man is a
kingdom to itself. In his lonely, or me∣lancholy
hours, he finds always resources
within himself, to which he can turn for
relief. As there are many occasions when
external objects afford no pleasure, it is
only by being able to rest on the enter∣tainments
afforded to himself by his
mind, that any one can pass his days with
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf-enjoyment. Let me recomment for
the same purpose,</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="290"/>
In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that we be always
careful to provide proper employment for
our time. Regular industry and labour,
with intervals of ease, is perhaps the state
most conducive of any to tranquillity. If
our station give no call to industry, it will
be profitable that we study to have some
end or object in view, to which our atten∣tion
shall be directed. Relaxation from
intense, or incessant pursuit, is requisite for
comfort. But if relaxation degenerate
into total idleness, it becomes in a high
degreee adverse to tranquillity. Every
man by his nature, is formed, more
or less, for action. In a mind that is en∣tirely
quiescent, and that has no object to
put in into motion, instead of self-enjoy∣ment,
there will be constant languor, te∣diousness,
and misery. Life stagnates in
such a situation, like a pool of dead waters;
and the man becomes a burden to him∣self.
Violent and dangerous pursuits,
which distract and embroil those who are
engaged in them, I cannot be understood
to recommend. Every on sees how fo∣reign
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
these are to a state of tranquillity.
But in the ordinary tenor of calm and
easy life, I would advise every one to have
some end before him; some object which
shall bring the mind into action, and fill
up the vacuities of time. Provided the
object be innocent, and of no unsuitable
or degrading nature, it may answer this
purpose, though it should not be in itself
of high importance. It is better for the
mind to have some determinate direction
given it, than to be always left floating, as
it were, in empty space.—But about what∣ever
objects we are employed, it is still
more material to tranquillity that, in the</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> place, we learn to govern our pas∣sions.
These are the most frequent dis∣turbers
of our peace. Necessary as their
impulse is to give activity to the mind,
yet if they are not kept in subordination
to reason, they speedily throw all things
into confusion. Such of them as belong
to the malignant and unsocial class, evi∣dently
tend to produce vexation and dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uiet.
Against suffering these to gain
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
possession of the heart, admonition is
scarcely necessary. But I must admonish
you, that even those which are accounted
of innocent nature, and which therefore
may lay hold of virtuous minds, if they
obtain the entire mastery, are sufficient to
overthrow the tranquillity of life. Let
every one, therefore, who values that tran∣quillity,
study to retain moderation and
self-command, even in the midst of pas∣sions
which have a fair and bland appear∣ance.
He will find that the grati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication
of any one of them, compensates not that
perpetual slavery to which it will reduce
him, when it becomes inordinate.</P>
<P>I have farther to admonish you, that
this self-command is particularly necessa∣ry
in all that relates to habitual temper.
Even where strong passions are out of the
question, those slighter emotions which
ruffle or sour the temper, are sufficient, by
their frequent recurrence, to poison all
self-enjoyment. He who would possess a
tranquil state, must, above all things, cul∣tivate
calmness and gentleness of disposi∣tion.
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
He ought especially to cultivate it in
that society, whether domestic or social, with
which he has most frequent intercourse.
We all know, that there are thousands who
in public, and in formal companies, appear
to be all gentleness and sweetness, but
who, at home, and among their nearest
relations, give vent, with freedom, to the
most harsh and peevish dispositions. Such
persons are not likely to enjoy much real
comfort. For it is in the daily and fami∣liar
intercourse of life, that temper chief∣ly
exerts its power, either for promoting
or for disturbing, the tranquillity of our
days. On occasions when men come clos∣est
together<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if, instead of meeting in
smooth contact, they rub and grate on
one another, the feelings produced on
both sides are of the most offensive and
displeasing kind. Nothing can be assum∣ed
as a more certain axiom, than that he
who allows either inordinate passions, or
a cross temper, to govern him, must,
though he should possess all that flourish∣ing
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
fortune can bestow, be a stranger to
tranquillity.</P>
<P><HI>In the sixth</HI> place, let me advise you ne∣ver
to expect too much from the world.
High hopes, and florid views, are great e∣nemies
to tranquillity. When rashly in∣dulged,
they are constantly producing
disappointments. Their indulgence, in the
mean time, occasions discontent with our
present situation; and he who is discon∣tented
cannot be happy. One of the first
lessons, both of religion and of wisdom, is,
to moderate our expectations and hopes;
and not to set forth on the voyage of life
like men who expect to be always carried
forward with a favourable gale. Let your
views be suited to your rank and station
in the world; and never soar fantastical∣ly
beyond them. Content yourselves with
sober pleasures, and form your relish to
them. Be thankful when you are free
from pain, though you be not in the
midst of high enjoyment. Be satisfied if
the path you tread be easy and smooth,
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
though it be not strewed with flowers.
Human life admits not of continued plea∣sure;
nor is it always rendered happy by
great exaltation. Remember, that it is a
middle region which is the native station
of tranquillity. It neither aspires to those
heights of the atmosphere where the thun∣der
is formed; nor creeps always on the
ground. Affect not, on every occasion, to
put yourselves forward. Be content to
retire sometimes into the shade; and al∣low
others to take their proper place.—It
will be easily seen, that I speak not now
to the ambitious and aspiring; but to
those who value tranquillity more than
splendid appearance in the world.</P>
<P>Such persons I also advise, while they
expect not too much from the world,
neither, also, to form too high expecta∣tions
from the characters of those on
whose friendship they rest, and with
whom it is their lot to be connected, ei∣ther
in social or domestic relations. If
you have looked for perfection any where,
you will find yourself disappointed; and
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
the consequence of this disappointment
will be, that friendship will cool, and dis∣gust
succeed. If you wish to enjoy com∣fort
in any of your connections, take
your fellow-creatures as they are, and
look for their imperfections to appear.
You know you have your own; bear with
those of others, as you expect that they
are to bear with you. As no one is with∣out
his failings, few also are void of ami∣able
qualities. Select for your compa∣nions,
those who have the greatest share
of such qualities; and value them accord∣ingly.
—In a word, make the best of this
world as you find it. Reckon both on
the state of human life, and on the society
of men, as mixed, and checquered with
good and evil. Carrying always in your
eye such views of things, you will be best
formed to those equal spirits, and that
reasonable disposition of mind, which
make the basis of tranquillity. I shall
only add as my</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> and last advice on the subject,
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
to mix retreat with the active business
of the world, and to cultivate habits of
serious thought and recollection. I before
advised those who are not particularly en∣gaged
in active life, to form to themselves
some object of pursuit, in order to fur∣nish
proper employment to time and
thought. But the great multitude of men
are in a different situation. Industry is re∣quired
of them; business and cares press;
and active pursuits occupy their closest at∣tention.
He, who, in this situation, pours
himself forth incessantly on the world, can∣not
escape partaking much of its disturb∣ance
and trouble. Amidst bustle, in∣trigue
and disfension, he must pass many
an uneasy hour. Here an enemy en∣counters
him; there, a rival meets him.
A suspicious friend alarms him one hour;
an ungrateful one provokes him the next.
I do not recommend, that for these rea∣sons,
he who studies tranquillity should
retire from all public business, and for∣sake
the haunts of men. This were the
retreat of a monk, not of a good and a
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
wise man. Tranquillity were too dearly
purchased by the neglect of those duties
which belong to a man, and a Christian.
Nor indeed in absolute seclusion from the
world is tranquillity ever found. On the
contrary, when the human mind is cut off
from those employments for which it was
designed by nature and Providence, it
preys on itself, and engenders its own mi∣sery.
Tranquillity is always most likely
to be attained, when the business of the
world is tempered with thoughtful and
serious retreat. <HI>Commune with your hearts
on your bed, and be still.</HI> Leaving this world
to itself, let there be seasons which you
devote to yourselves, and to God. Reflec∣tion
and meditation allay the workings of
many unquiet passions; and place us at a
distance from the tumults of the world.
When the mind has either been ruffled or
cast down, in intercourse with God and
heaven we find a sanctuary to which we
can retreat. In the hours of contempla∣tion
and devotion, a good man enjoys
himself in peace. He beholds nobler ob∣jects
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
than what worldly men can b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hold.
He assumes a higher character. He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tens
to the voice of nature and of God;
and from this holy sanctuary comes forth
with a mind fortified against the little dis∣turbances
of the world. Such habit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
therefore, cannot be too much recommend∣ed
to the lovers of tranquillity, as power∣ful
subsidiary means for attaining that
happy state.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus pointed out what appears
to me the discipline of religion and wis∣dom
for tranquillity of mind. <HI>He that
doth these things shall never be moved.</HI>—During
the early periods of life, vivid s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣sations
of pleasure are the sole objects
thought wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thy of pursuit. Mere ease and
calmness are despised, as the portion of
the aged only and the feeble. Some long∣er
acquaintance with the world, with its
disappointed hopes and fallacious pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sures,
teaches almost all men, by degrees,
to wish for tranquillity and peace. But
you must not imagine, that these are bles∣sings
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
which will drop on men of their own
accord, as soon as they begin to desire
them. No: The thoughtless, and the
profligate, will ever remain strangers to
them. They will remain the sport of every
accident that occurs to derange their minds,
and to disturb their life.—The three
great enemies to tranquillity are, Vice,
Superstition, and Idleness: Vice, which
poisons and disturbs the mind with bad
passions; Superstition, which fills it with
imaginary t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrors; Idleness, which loads
it with tediousness and disgust. It is only
by following the path which Eternal Wis∣dom
has pointed out, that we can arrive
at the blessed temple of Tranquillity, and
obtain a station there: By doing, or at
least endeavouring to do, our duty to God
and man; by acquiring a humble trust
in the mercy and favour of God through
Jesus Christ; by cultivating our minds,
and properly employing our time and
thoughts; by governing our passions and
our temper; by correcting all unreason∣able
expectations from the world, and from
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
men; and, in the midst of worldly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
habituating ourselves to calm retreat
and serious recollection.—By such means
as these, it may be hoped, that, through
the divine blessing, our days, shall flow in
a stream as unruffled as the human state
admits. <HI>The wicked are like the troubled
sea, when it cannot rest. But the work of
righeousness is peace: and the effect of right∣teousness
is quietness and assurance for ever</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>saiah. Xxxii. 17.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>HOW many complaints do we hear
from every quarter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE> of the misery
and distress that fill the world! in these
the high and the low, the young and the
aged, join; and since the beginning of
time, no topic has been more fertile of
declamation, than the vanity and vexation
which man is appointed to suffer. But
<PB N="294" REF="303"/>
are we certain that this vexation, and this
vanity, is altogether to be ascribed to the ap∣pointment
of heaven? Is there no ground
to suspect that man himself is the chief and
immediate author of his own susserings?
what the text plainly suggests is, that it is
common for men to complain ground∣lesly
of Providence; that they are prone
to accuse God for the evils of life, when
in reason they ought to accuse them∣selves;
and that aster their <HI>foolishness</HI>
hath <HI>perverted their way,</HI> and made
them undergo the consequences of their
own misconduct, they impiously <HI>fret
in heart against the Lord.</HI> This is the doc∣trine
which I now purpose to illustrate, in
order to silence the sceptic, and to check
a repining and irreligious spirit. I shall
for this end make some observations, first,
on the external, and next, upon the inter∣nal,
condition of man; and then conclude
with such serious and useful improvement
as the subject will naturally suggest.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="304"/>
I. Let us consider the external condi∣tion
of man. We find him placed in a
world, where he has by no means the dis∣posal
of the events that happen. Calami∣ties
sometimes befal the worthiest and the
best, which it is not in their power to pre∣vent,
and where nothing is loft them, but
to acknowledge and to submit to the high
hand of Heaven. For such visitations of
trial, many good and wise reasons can be
assigned, which the present subject leads
me not to discuss. But though those una∣voidable
calamities make a part, yet they
make not the chief part, of the vexations
and sorrows that distress human life. A
multitude of evils beset us, for the source
of which we must look to another quar∣ter.
—No sooner has any thing in the
health, or in the circumstances of men,
gone cross to their wish, than they begin
to talk of the unequal distribution of the
good things of this life; they envy the
condition of others; they repine at their
own lot, and fret against the Ruler of the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="305"/>
Full of these sentiments, one man pines
under a broken constitution. But let us
ask him, whether he can, fairly and ho∣nestly,
assign no cause for this but the
unknown decree of heaven? Has he du∣ly
valued the blessing of health, and al∣ways
observed the rules of virtue and so∣briety?
Has he been moderate in his life,
and temperate in all his pleassures? If now
he be only paying the price of his former,
perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has
he any title to complain, as if he were
suffering unjustly? Were you to survey
the chambers of sickness and distress, you
would find them peopled with the victims
of intemperance and sensuality, and with
the children of vitious indolence and
sloth. Among the thousands who lan∣guish
there, you would find the propor∣tion
of innocent sufferers to be small.
You would see faded youth, premature
old age, and the prospect of an untimely
grave, to be the portion of multitudes
who, in one way or other, have brought
those evils on themselves; while yet these
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
martyrs of vice and folly have the assur∣ance
to arraign the hard fate of man, and
to <HI>sret against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But you, perhaps, complain of hard∣ships
of another kind; of the injustice of
the world; of the poverty which you suf∣fer,
and the discouragements under which
you labour; of the crosses and disap∣pointments
of which your life has been
doomed to be full.—Before you give
too much scope to your discontent, let
me desire you to reflect impartially upon
your past train of life. Have not sloth,
or pride, or ill temper, or sinful passions,
misled you often from the path of sound
and wise conduct? Have you not been
wanting to yourselves in improving those
opportunities which Providence offered
you, for bettering and advancing your
state? If you have chosen to indulge your
humour, or your taste, in the gratifica∣tions
of indolence or pleasure, can you
complain because others, in preference to
you, have obtained those advantages
which naturally belong to useful labours,
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
and honourable pursuits? have not the
consequences of some false steps, into
which your passions, or your pleasures,
have betrayed you, pursued you through
much of your life; tainted perhaps, your
character, involved you in embarassments,
or sunk you into neglect?—It is an old
saying, that every man is the artificer of
his own fortune in the world. It is cer∣tain,
that the world seldom turns wholly
against a man, unless through his own
fault. <HI>Godliness is,</HI> in general, <HI>profitable
unto all things.</HI> Virtue, diligence and in∣dustry,
joined with good temper and pru∣dence,
have ever been found the surest
road to prosperity; and where men fail
of attaining it, their want of success is
for oftener owing to their having deviat∣ed
from that road, than to their hav∣ing
encountered insuperable bars in it.
Some, by being too artful, forfeit the re∣putation
of probity. Some, by being too
open, are accounted to fail in prudence.
Others, by being fickle and changeable,
are distrusted by all.—The case com∣monly
<PB N="299" REF="308"/>
is, that men seek to ascribe their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sappointments to any cause, rather than
to their own misconduct; and when they
can devise no other cause, they lay them
to the charge of Providence. Their folly
leads them into vices; their vices into
misfortunes; and in their misfortunes
they <HI>sret against the Lord.</HI> They are
doubly unjust towards God. In their pro∣sperity,
they are apt to ascribe their suc∣cess
to their own diligence, rather than to
God's blessing; and in their adversity,
they impute their distresses to his provi∣dence,
not to their own misbehaviour.
whereas, the truth is the very reverse of
this. <HI>Every good and every perfect gift
cometh from above;</HI> and of evil and mise∣ry,
man is the author to himself.</P>
<P>When from the condition of indivi∣duals,
we look abroad to the public state
of the world, we meet with more proofs
of the truth of this assertion. We see
great societies of men torn in pieces by
intestine dissensions, tumults, and civil
commotions. We see mighty armies go∣ing
<PB N="300" REF="309"/>
forth, in formidable array, against
each other, to cover the earth with blood,
and to fill the air with the cries of widow,
and orphans. Sad evils these are, to
which this miserable world is exposed.
—But are these evils, I beseech you,
to be imputed to God? Was it he who
sent forth slaughtering armies into the
field, or who filled the peaceful city with
massacres and blood? Are these miseries
any other, than the bitter fruit of mens
violent and disorderly passions? Are they
not clearly to be traced to the ambition
and vices of princes, to the quarrels of
the great, and to the turbulence of the
people?—Let us lay them entirely out
of the account, in thinking of Providence;
and let us think only of the <HI>foolishness of
men.</HI> Did man controul his passions, and
form his conduct according to the dic∣tates
of wisdom, humanity and virtue,
the earth would no longer be desolated
by cruelty; and human societies would
live in order, harmony and peace. In
those scenes of mischief and violence
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
which fill the world, let man behold, with
shame, the picture of his vices, his ingno∣rance,
and folly. Let him be humbled
by the mortifying view of his own <HI>per∣verseness;</HI>
but let not <HI>his heart fret against
the Lord.</HI>—Form the external condition,
let us proceed.</P>
<P>II. To consider the internal state of
man. It is certain that much disquiet
and misery may be found there, although
his outward condition appear undisturb∣ed,
and easy. As far as this inward dis∣quietude
arises from the stings of con∣science,
and the horrors of guilt, there
can be no doubt of its being self-created
misery; which it is altogether impossible
to impute to Heaven. But even, when
great crimes, and deep remorse, are not
the occasions of torment, how often is
poison infused into the most flourishing
conditions of fortune, by the follies and
the passions of the prosperous? we see
them peevish and restles corrupted with
luxury, and enervated by case; impatient
<PB N="302" REF="311"/>
of the smallest disappointment; oppressed
with low spirits, and complaining of eve∣ry
thing around them. How many <HI>Ha∣mans,
Hazaels, and herods,</HI> are there in
the world, who, form what they suffer
within, pass their days in more vexation
and misery, than they who undergo the
hardships of poverty? Dare such men, in
their most discontented moments, charge
the providence of heaven with miseries
of their own procuring? Providence had
put into their hand the fairest opportu∣nity
of passing their life with comfort.
But they themselves blasted every com∣fort
that was offered; and verified the
prediction, that <HI>the prosperity of fools shall
destroy them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As it is man's own <HI>foolishness</HI> which
ruins his prosperity, we must not omit to
remark, that it is the same cause which
aggravates and embitters his adversity.
That you suffer from the external af∣flictions
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
of the world, may often be ow∣ing
to God's appointment; but when, in
the midst of these, you also suffer from
the disorders of your mind and passions,
this is owing to yourselves; and they are
those inward disorders which add the se∣verest
sting to external afflictions. Many
are the resources of a good and a wise man,
under all the disasters of life. In the midst
of them, it is always in his power to en∣joy
peace of mind, and hope in God. He
may suffer; but under suffering he will
not sink, as long as all is found within.
But when the spirit has been wounded by
guilt and folly, its wounds open, bleed
a fresh, upon every blow that is received
from the world. The mind becomes
sensible and sore to the flightest injuries of
fortune; and a small reverse is felt as an
insupportable calamity.</P>
<P>On the whole; the farther you search into
human life, and the more you observe the
manners and the conduct of men, you will
be the more convinced of this great truth,
that of the distresses which abound in the
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
world, we are the chief authors. Among
the multitudes who are, at this day, bewail∣ing
their condition and lot, it will be found
to hold of far the greater part, that they
are reaping the <HI>fruit of their own doings;
their inequities are reproving them, and their
blackslidings correcting them.</HI> Unattainable
objects foolishly pursued, intemperate pas∣sions
nourished, vicious pleasures and de∣sires
indulged, God and God's holy laws for∣gotten;
these, these are the great scourges
of the world; the great causes of the life
of man being so embroiled and unhappy.
God hath ordained our state on earth to
be a mixed and imperfect state. we have
ourselves to blame for its becoming an in∣supportable
one. If it bring forth nothing
to us but vexation and vanity, we have
sown the seeds of that vanity and vexa∣tion;
and as we have sown, we must reap.
—I now proceed to make improvement of
those truths which we have been consider∣ing.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> place, let us be taught, to
<PB N="305" REF="314"/>
look upon sin as the source of all our mi∣series.
It may sometimes assume the gent∣ler
names of folly, irregularity, or levity;
but under whatever form it appears, it
always imports a deviation from that sa∣cred
law which ought to regulate our
conduct. It is still the <HI>root that beareth
gall and wormwood</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxix. 18.</NOTE>; and in exact pro∣portion
to the quantity of this poisonous
weed, which we ourselves have infused in∣to
our cup, we must expect to drink the
waters of bitterness. If the <HI>foolishness of
man</HI> did not <HI>pervert his ways,</HI> his heart
would have no occasion to <HI>fret against the
Lord.</HI> He would enjoy competent satis∣faction
in every situation of life; and un∣der
its unavoidable evils, would derive
consolation from religion and virtue.—
Indeed, of every evil which we now en∣dure.,
of those evils which we look upon
to be the appointment of providence, as
well as of others, sin is ultimately the
cause; as it was man's revolt from God,
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
which gave rise originally to those evils,
and which rendered the chastisements we
undergo, in this state of discipline, necessa∣ry,
even for the <HI>sons of God.</HI>—But at
present, we confine our observation to
those miseries of which men are the im∣mediate
procurers to themselves; and
from them alone, we find sufficient
reason to consider sin as the capital foe
to man; as the great troubler and dis∣turber
of his life. To Providence, then,
let us look up with reverence. On sin let
our indignation be vented; and, what is
of more consequence, against sin and all
its approaches, let our utmost caution be
employed. As we proceed through the
different paths of life, let us accustom our∣selves
to beware of sin, as the hidden
snake lurking among the gras from
whose fatal touch we must fly in haste,
if we would not experience its sting.—
Too many have no just apprehensions of
this danger. <HI>Fools,</HI> said the wise man,
<HI>make a mock at sin.</HI> A fool indeed he must
be, who dares to think lightly of it. He
shows not only the depravity of his heart,
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
but, what perhaps he will be more asham∣ed
to be charged with, he shows his ig∣norance
of the world. He shows that he
knows not, he understands not, even his
worldly interest, nor the interest and hap∣piness
of human society.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, let us learn from
what has been set forth, one of the most
awful and important of all truths, the re∣ality
of a divine government exercised o∣ver
the world. Blind must that man, be
who discerns not the most striking marks
of it, in the doctrine which has been un∣der
our review. If there be a sceptic, who
contends, that unrestrained liberty in the
gratification of desire is given to man;
that in the sight of his Creator, all actions
are equal; and that no rule of moral con∣duct
hath been prescribed, or by any pe∣nalty
enforced; in order to confute such
a man, we have not recourse to reason∣ings,
but simply appeal to plain and ob∣vious
facts. we bid him look only to
the life of man; and take notice how e∣very
vice, is by the constitution of things,
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
connected with misery. We bid him
trace the history of any one, with whose
conduct he had particular occasion to be
acquainted; and observe, whether the chief
misfortunes which pursued him were not
brought upon him by his own misbeha∣viour.
We bid him remark in the histo∣ry
of nations, whether public virtue has
not always exalted them; and whether
licentiousness and crimes have not paved
the way for their ruin. These are testi∣monies
to the truth of religion, which can∣not
by any sophistry be evaded. This
is a voice, which speaks its warnings loud
and strong to every heart.</P>
<P>The system upon which the divine go∣vernment
at present proceeds, plainly is,
that mens <HI>own wickedness</HI> should be ap∣pointed
to <HI>correct them;</HI> that sinners
should <HI>be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the work of their hands,
and sunk in the pit which themselves had
digged; that the backslider in heart should
be filled with his own ways.</HI>—Of all the
plans which could have been devised for
the government of the world, this ap∣proves
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
itself to reason, as the wisest and
most worthy of God;so to frame the
constitution of things, that the divine laws
should in a manner execute themselves,
and carry their sanctions in their own bo∣som.
When the vices of men require pu∣nishment
to be inflicted, the Almighty is
at no loss for ministers of justice. A
thousand instruments of vengeance are at
his command; innumerable arrows are
always in his quiver. But such is the
profound wisdom of his plan, that no pe∣culiar
interposals of power are requisite.
He has no occasion to step from his throne,
and to interrupt the order of nature.
With that Majesty and solemnity which
befits omnipotence, He pronounces, <HI>Eph∣raim
is joined to his idols; let him alone</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hosea. Iv. 17.</NOTE>;
He leaves transgressors to their own guilt,
and punishment follows of course. Their
sins do the work of justice. They lift the
scourge; and with every stroke which
<PB N="310" REF="319"/>
they inflict on the criminal, they mix this
severe admonition, that as he is only reap∣ing
the fruit of his own actions, he de∣serves
all that he suffers.—From what
has been said, I might take occasion.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Third</HI> place, to show the injustice
of our charging Providence with a pro∣miscuous
and unequal distribution of its
favours, among the good and the bad.
That unequal distribution takes place in
appearance only, not in reality. The
whole conduct of Providence sufficiently
marks, which of those classes of men it
blesses and protects. The prosperity of
sinners is no more than a deceitful show.
The great materials of happiness are pro∣vided
for the virtuous; and <HI>evil</HI> never
fails to <HI>pursue the wicked.</HI> I shall close the
discourse with observing,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fourth</HI> and last place, the necessi∣ty
which plainly arises from our present
condition, of looking up to God for direc∣tion
and aid, in the conduct of life. The
<PB N="311" REF="320"/>
result of the whole doctrine I have now
delivered is, that man's happiness or mise∣ry
is, in a great measure, put into his own
hands. In vain he complains of Provi∣dence.
If his <HI>heart fret against the Lord,</HI> it
is only because <HI>his foolishness hath perverted
his way;</HI> for on himself, and his own be∣haviour,
it depends, to be free of those mi∣series
which harrass the wicked.—But a∣las!
when we say, that this depends upon
man, on what uncertain ground do we
place his security? Is man, when left to
himself, equal to this high trust that is re∣posed
in him, this important charge that
is committed to him, of attaining happi∣ness,
by wise and irreproachable conduct?
Inconstant as he is in virtue, variable in
his resolutions, soft and yielding in his
nature to a thousand temptations; how
shall he guide himself through such slip∣pery
and dangerous paths as those of hu∣man
life; where many hidden precipices
surround him; many false lights lead him
astray; and where the consequence of eve∣ry
step he takes may be destruction and
<PB N="312" REF="321"/>
ruin?—Thankful let us be to heaven,
that in this situation, a merciful guide
stretches out his hand to aid us; that a
celestial light shines upon us from above;
that a divine Spirit is promised to illumi∣nate
and strenythen us. let us humbly re∣quest
of Heaven, that this Spirit of the Al∣mighty
may ever be our guide; never pre∣sumptuously
trusting in our own wisdom;
but listening attentively to the voice of God;
and <HI>in all our ways acknowledging Him</HI> who
only can <HI>direct our steps</HI>—Upon the whole,
let us hold fast the persuasion of these
fundamental truths;—that in all his dis∣pensations,
God is just and good; that the
cause of all the troubles we suffer is in
ourselves, not in him; that virtue is the
surest guide to a happy life; that he who
forsakes this guide, enters upon the path
of death; but that he who <HI>walketh up∣rightly,
walketh surely;</HI> and that he who
<HI>keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own
soul.</HI></P>

<P>RIGHTEOUSNESS and sin are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XV.</NOTE> in this
book of Proverbs, frequently con∣trasted
with each other, and the advanta∣ges
of the former displayed. The righ∣teous
man is shown to be <HI>more excellent
than his neighbour, as the ways in which he
walks are ways of pleasantness,</HI> while <HI>the
way of transgressors is hard.</HI> Honour is re∣presented
as attending the one, while
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
shame is the portion of the other. The
path of the one leads to life; that of the
other to destruction. In the text, an ad∣vantage
of righteousness is specified,
which is not commonly attended to, and
which some will not readily allow that it
possesses. We are told by the wise man,
that it affords light and direction to con∣duct,
and will prove our best guide
through all the intricacies of life. <HI>The
integrity of the upright shall guide them;</HI> or,
as it is added, to the same purpose, in a fol∣lowing
verse, <HI>the righteousness of the perfect
shall direct his way.</HI> There are many who
will admit, that integrity is an amiable qua∣lity;
that it is entitled to much respect, and
in most cases ought to influence our beha∣viour;
who nevertheless are unwilling to
allow it the chief place in the direction of
their worldly conduct. They hold, that
a certain artful sagacity, founded upon
knowledge of the world, is the best con∣ductor
of every one, who would be as suc∣cessful
adventurer in life; and that a strict
attention to integrity, as his only guide,
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
would often lead him into danger and dis∣tress.
In opposition to tenets of this
kind, I now purpose to show, that amidst
all perplexities and dangers, there is no
guide we can chuse so safe, and so success∣ful
on the whole, as the integrity of an
upright mind; and that upon every try∣ing
occasion, principles of probity and ho∣nour
will conduct a good man through
life with more advantage, than if he were
to act upon the most refined system of
worldly wisdom.</P>
<P>IT will not take much time to delineate
the character of the man of integrity, as
by its nature it is a plain one, and easily
understood. He is one, who makes it his
constant rule to follow the road of duty,
according as the word of God, and the
voice of his conscience, point it out to him.
He is not guided merely by affections,
which may sometimes give the colour of
virtue to a loose and unstable character.
The upright man is guided by a fixed
principle of a mind, which determines him
<PB N="316" REF="325"/>
to esteem nothing but what is honour∣able;
and to abhor whatever is base and
unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence you
find him ever the same; at all times, the
trusty friend, the affectionate relation, the
conscientious man of business, the pious
worshipper, the public spirited citizen.
He assumes no borrowed appearance. He
seeks no mask to cover him; for he acts
no studied part; but he is in truth what
he appears to be, full of truth, candour,
and humanity. In all his pursuits, he
knows no path but the fair and direct
one; and would much rather fail of suc∣cess;
than attain it by reproachful means.
He never shows you a smiling counte∣nance,
while he meditates evil against
you in his heart. He never praises you
among your friends; and then joins in
traducing you among your enemies. You
will never find one part of his character
at variance with another. In his man∣ners,
he is simple and unaffected; in all his
proceedings, open and consistent.—Such is
the man of integrity spoken of in the
<PB N="317" REF="326"/>
text. Let us now proceed to show, in what
manner, and with what effect, integrity
serves for the guide of his life.</P>
<P>EVERY one, who has begun to make
any progress in the world, will be sensible,
that to conduct himself in human affairs
with wisdom and propriety, is often a mat∣ter
of no small difficulty, Amidst that
variety of characters, of jarring disposi∣tions,
and of interfering interests, which
take place among those with whom we
have intercourse, we are frequently at a
stand, as to the part most prudent for us
to chuse. Ignorant of what is passing
in the breasts of those around us, we can
form no more than doubtful conjectures
concerning the events that are likely to
happen. They may take some turn alto∣gether
different from the course in which
we had imagined they were to run, and
according to which we had formed our
plans. The slightest incident often shoots
out into important consequences of which
we were not aware. The labyrinth be∣comes
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
so intricate, that the most sagacious
can lay hold on no clue to guide him
through it; He finds himself embarrassed,
and at loss how to act.—In public and
in private life, in managing our own con∣cerns,
and in directing those of others,
the doubt started by the Wise man fre∣quently
occurs; <HI>Who knoweth what is
good for man in this life?</HI>—while thus fa∣tigued
with conjecture, we remain per∣plexed
and undetermined in our choice;
we are at the same time pulled to diffe∣rent
sides, by the various emotions which
belong to our nature./ On one hand, plea∣sure
allures us to what is agreeable; on
the other, interest weighs us down to∣wards
what seems gainful. Honour at∣tracts
us towards what is splendid; and
indolence inclines us to what is easy. In
the consultations which we hold with our
own mind concerning our conduct., how
often are we thus divided within ourselves;
puzzled by the uncertainty of future e∣vents,
and distracted by the contest of
different inclinations?</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="328"/>
It is in such situations as these, that the
principle of integrity interposes to give
light and direction. While worldly men
fluctuate in the midst of those perplexi∣ties
which I have described, the virtuous
man has one Oracle, to which he resorts in
every dubious case, and whose decisions
he holds to be infallible: He consults his
conscience. He listens to the voice of
God. Were it only on a few occasions
that this Oracle could be consulted, its
value would be less. But it is a mistake
to imagine, that its Responses are seldom
given. Hardly is there any material trans∣action
whatever in human life, any im∣portant
question, that holds us in suspence
as to practice, but the difference between
right and wrong will show itself; and the
principle of integrity will, fi we listen to
it impartially, give a clear decision.
whenever the mind is divided within it∣self,
conscience is seldom or never neutral.
There is always one side or other to which
it leans. There is always one scale of the
balance, into which it throws the weight
<PB N="320" REF="329"/>
of <HI>some virtue; or some praise;</HI> of some∣thing
that is <HI>just and true, lovely, honest, and
of good report.</HI> These are the forms, which
rise to the observation of the upright
man. By others they may be unseen, nor
overlooked; but in his eye, the lustre of
virtue outshines all other brightness.
Wherever this pole star directs him, he
steadily holds his course.—Let the is∣sue
of that course be ever so uncertain;
let his friends differ from him in opi∣nion;
let his enemies clamour; he is not
moved; his purpose is fixed. He asks
but one question of his heart, what is the
most worthy and honourable part; what
is the part most becoming the station
which he possesses, the character which
he wishes to bear, the expectations which
good men entertain of him? Being once
decided as to this, he hesitates no more.
He shuts his ears against every solicita∣tion.
He pursues the direct line of inte∣grity,
without <HI>turning either to the right
hand or to the left.</HI> “It is the Lord who
calleth. Him I follow. Let him or∣der
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
what seemeth good in his sight.”
—It is in this manner that the <HI>integrity
of the upright acts as their guide</HI></P>
<P>But as, upon a superficial view, it may
appear hazardous to place ourselves en∣tirely
under such a guide, let us now pro∣ceed
to consider what can be said in de∣fence
of this plan of conduct, and what
advantages serve to recommend it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, I affirm, that the guid∣ance
of integrity is the safest under which
we can be placed; that the road in which
it leads us is, upon the whole, the freest
from dangers. Perfect immunity form
danger is not to be expected in this life.
We can chuse no path, in which we may
not meet with disappointments and mis∣fortunes.
Our life, at the best, is a pil∣grimage,
and perils surround it. Against
these perils, the men of the world imagine
that craft and dexterity furnish the best
defence; and if, in any instance, they o∣ver-reach
the upright, they consider it as
a manifest decision in favour of their
<PB N="322" REF="331"/>
plan. But instead of resting on a few
instances, let us take an extensive survey
of the course of human affairs. Let us
enquire who the persons are that, in all
the different lines of life, have gone
through the world with most success;
and we shall find, that the men of probity
and honour form by far the most con∣siderable
part of the list; we shall find
that men of plain understanding, acting
upon fair <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd direct views, have much
oftener prospered, than men of the deep∣est
policy, who were devoid of principle.
How few are the instances of persons who
by fidelity, worth, and stedfast adherence
to their duty, have either lost their for∣tunes,
or incurred general displeasure, in
times when human affairs were proceed∣ing
in their ordinary train? But how nu∣merous
and frequent are the examples of
those whose prospects have been blasted,
whose circumstances have been ruined,
and their names sunk into contempt by
vice and dishonesty?</P>
<P>The man of the world aims at higher
<PB N="323" REF="332"/>
things, and more rapid success, than the
man of moderation and virtue. But, at
the same time, he incurs greater risques
and dangers. No calculation of proba∣bilities
can ensure safety to him who is
acting a deceitful part. Amidst the un∣foreseen
vicissitudes of the world, he has
to dread, not only disappointment to his
plans, but the miseries also which detect∣ed
fallacies may bring on his head. He
walks on the edge of precipices, where a
single false step may be fatal. He fol∣lows
a wandering light, which, if it fail
of guiding him by a short path to the Pa∣lace
of ambition, lands him in the pit, or
the lake. Whereas he who follows the
guidance of integrity, walks in the high
road on which the light of the sun shines.
He sees before him the Habitation of peace
to which his steps are directed; and if he
be longer of arriving at it, he is sure of
neither wandering far astray, nor of meet∣ing
on his road with any forms of unu∣sual
terror.—Let it be always remem∣bered
that the principle of integrity which
<PB N="324" REF="333"/>
directs a good man, is far from excluding
prudence in the conduct of life. It im∣plies
no improvident or thoughtless sim∣plicity.
On the contrary, it is closely
connected with true wisdom. A man of
enlarged capacity, and extensive views, is
always upright. Craft is merely the sup∣plement
of inferior abilities. It charac∣terizes
a narrow comprehension, and a
little mind.—As the path of integrity is
on the whole the safest path of con∣duct;
so,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, it is unquestionably
the most honourable. Integrity is the
foundation of all that is high in character
among mankind. Other qualities may add
to its splendor; but if this essential requisite
be wanting, all their lustre fades. Were I
drawing the character of one who claimed
the admiration of the world; and after I
had ascribed to him cloquence, valour,
and every endowment that is most shin∣ing
and captivating, did I add, that he was
a man of too much art to be trusted, I ap∣peal
<PB N="325" REF="334"/>
to every one, whether by this single
stroke, the whole character would not be
sunk and degraded? An interested and
crafty man may perhaps rise into in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lu∣ence
and high station; he may be a rich
and a powerful, but will never be a great,
man. He may be feared, and externally
honoured and courted; but in the secret
thoughts of men he finds no respect.
We all feel, that magnanimous sentiments
cannot dwell in the same breast with sel∣fishness
and deceit.</P>
<P>He who rests upon an internal principle
of virtue and honour, will act with a dig∣nity
and a boldness, of which they are in∣capable
who are wholly guided by interest.
He is above those timid suspicions, and
cautious restraints, which setter and em∣barrass
their conduct. That firmness
which the consciousness of rectitude in∣spires,
gives vigour and force to his exer∣tions
on every great occasion. It adds dou∣ble
weight to all the abilities of which he is
possest. It even supplies the place of those
abilities in which he is defective. They
<PB N="326" REF="335"/>
who oppose him are obliged to honour him.
They look up to him with a secret awe, as
to one who moves above them in a superior
sphere; regardless of their good or ill opi∣nion,
of their promises or their threaten∣ings;
like one of those celestial luminaries
which holds its course through its orbit,
without being affected by any commo∣tions
among the elements below. Such a
man is trusted and relied upon, as well as
esteemed, because all know where to find
him, and upon what system he acts. He
attaches <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and followers to himself,
without courting them; and though his
progress towards fame should be slow,
and interrupted at first by crooked arts,
it is nevertheless certain and sure. The
public may be misled for a while, in judg∣ing
of real merit; but it is seldom unjust
at the last. As persons continue to come
forward to view, and to act their part in
trying circumstances, their characters are
at length fully ascertained; and, almost
always, rated as they deserve. How cor∣rupt
soever the world may be, they can∣not
<PB N="327" REF="336"/>
with-hold approbation from him,
whose conduct is marked by uniform
integrity and honour. Enemies he will
have; but the public favours him; the
multitude of men wish him success; and
destine him, in their thoughts, to every step
of his preserment, before he arrives at it.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, the plan of conduct,
on which the man of integrity proceeds
is the most comfortable; that is, attended
with the greatest satisfaction in a man's
own mind. Amidst the various and per∣plexing
events of life, it is of singular ad∣vantage
to be kept free from doubt, as to
the part most proper to be chosen. He
who consults nothing but worldly inte∣rest
must, upon every turn of fortune, un∣dergo
much painful suspence. He is o∣bliged
to listen with anxious ear to every
whisper of report; and upon every new
aspect which the face of affairs assumes,
must study how to place himself in a new
posture of defence. But the man of prin∣ciple
is a stranger to these inward trou∣bles.
<PB N="328" REF="337"/>
His time is not lost; nor his tem∣per
sretted by long and anxious consulta∣tions.
One light always shines upon him
from above. One path, the path of inte∣grity,
always opens clear and distinct to
his view.—But this is not his only advan∣tage,
to be freed from embarassments, by
having placed himself under the charge of
one constant guide. He is also rewarded
with the sense of having chosen his guide
well and wisely. He is delivered from all
inward upbraidings, from all misgivings
of mind, from all alarms founded on the
dread of discovery and disgrace. A good
conscience enables him to look back on
the part which he has acted with satis∣faction;
and to look forward to the issue
which it may bring, without concern, It
is in the case of one issue only, that the
man who acts from worldly interest can
enjoy satisfaction; that is, when his de∣signs
have succeeded according to his wish.
But it is the selicity of the man, who acts
under the direction of integrity, that in
every issue, he has something to comfort
<PB N="329" REF="338"/>
him. Though success has <HI>failed</HI> him, the
consolation remains of having done his
duty, and studied to approve himself to
God.</P>
<P>This reference of all his actions to di∣vine
approbation furnishes another source
of satissaction and peace. He looks up,
with pleasing hope, to a Protector in the
heavens, who <HI>loveth righteousness, and whose
countenance beholdeth the upright.</HI> The man
of wordly wisdom is conscious of having
no title to the favour of that high admini∣stration
which rules the universe. By
quitting the path of righteousness, he has
left that straight road, in which God had
appointed him to walk. He has taken the
direction of his way to himself; and cho∣sen
to be his own guide and mster. To
his own abilities, therefore, such as they
are, he must trust; and is become wholly
responsible for the issue of his conduct.
But the man of virtue hath <HI>committed his
way to the Lord.</HI> He follows the divine
signal. He co-operates with the divine
prupose. The power which sways the u∣niverse
<PB N="330" REF="339"/>
is engaged on his side. By natural
consequence, he had ground to expect,
that any seeming disappointments which
he may now incur, shall be over-ruled at
the end to some salutary effect. Hence,
that <HI>peace of God keeping the heart,</HI> to which
worldly men are strangers. Hence a de∣gree
of firmness and resolution in conduct,
which it is impossible for them to possess.
Especially when we add.</P>
<P>In the <HI>sourth</HI> and last place, that he who
thus prusues a course of integrity, has al∣ways
in his view the prospect of immor∣tal
rewards. That surely is the wisest di∣rection
of conduct, which is most amply
recompensed at last. But what recom∣pence
can worldly wisdom bestow, com∣parable
to what is promised by the gos∣pel
to them who, <HI>by patient continuance in
well doing, look for glory, honour, and immor∣tality?</HI>
—The recompence indeed is distant;
but the hope of it is present; and hope is
one of the most powerful principles of hu∣man
action. Let a man be firm in the
<PB N="331" REF="340"/>
belief that he is acting under the im∣mediate
protection of Heaven, and that
through all eternity he shall be rewarded
for what he now performs; and, as far
as this belief is prevalent, his conduct will
be steady and determined. Wherever re∣ligion
directs him to hold his course, he
will advance with intrpidity. He will
submit to restraints without reluctance.
He will meet dangers without fear. To
every motive which reason suggests in fa∣vour
of virtue, the hope of life eternal
adds supernatural strength.—Accordingly,
in the behaviour of many holy men, un∣der
the most trying circumstances of dis∣tress,
we behold this effect eminently ex∣emplified.
It appears, with much lustre,
in the spirited and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> senti∣ments
of the Apostle Paul, when he had
the prospect of death before him. <HI>Behold
I go bound in the spirit to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not
knowing the things that shall besal me there,
save that the Holy Ghost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that
bonds and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abide me. But none of
these things move me; neither count <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my
<PB N="332" REF="341"/>
life dear unto myself, so that I may finish my
course with joy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts xv. 22.</NOTE>.—I am now ready to
be offered, and the time of my departure is
at hand. I have sought a good sight; I
have finished my course; I have kept the
faith. Hencesorth there is laid up for me a
crown of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which the Lord, the
righteous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, shall give me at that day<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Timothy. iv. 6.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to show in
what manner the <HI>integrity of the upright
guides them;</HI> and what the advantages
are of placing ourselves under its guid∣ance.
If it be the line of safety, or the
line of honour, which we chuse to pur∣sue;
if we consult our present comfort
or look forward to future rewards; in all
these respects, the course which integrity
points out is by far the most eligible.</P>
<P>It is a great recommendation of the guid∣ance
offered to us by integrity, that it is
easily understood by all men. Plans of
<PB N="333" REF="342"/>
worldly policy are deep and intricate;
and experience shows how often the a∣blest
persons are mistaken in the measures
which they adapt for carrying them on.
But when men's intentions are fair and
upright, it will be found, that a moderate
share of understanding and attention is
all that is requisite, for conducting them∣selves
with safety and propriety. Providence
never intended, that the art of liv∣ing
happily in this world should depend
on that deep penetration, that acute saga∣city,
and those refinements of thoughts,
which few possess. It has dealt more
graciously with us; and made happiness
to depend on uprightness of intention,
much more than on extent of capacity.
For the most part, the first sentiment
which strikes a good man, concerning
what he ought, or ought not to do, is the
soundest, and suggests the best and wisest
counsel. when he hesitates, and begins
to deliberate how far his duty, or his ho∣nour,
can be reconciled to what seems his
interest, he is on the point of deviating
<PB N="334" REF="343"/>
into a dangerous path.—At the same
time, it is of great consequence, that he
who seeks to surrender his conduct to the
direction of integrity, should be well ap∣prized
of what true integrity requires.
Let him guard against burdening consci∣ence
unnecessarily; left a superstitious re∣gard
to trifles lead him to relax in mat∣ters
of higher obligation. Let him avoid
minute scrupulosity, on the one hand.
Let him keep at a distance from loose ca∣suistry,
on the other. But when he is sa∣tisfied
that his conscience has been well
informed, let him, without wavering, ad∣here
to its dictates in the whole of his
conduct. This will prove the truest wis∣dom
both for this world and the next.
For <HI>he who walketh uprightly walketh sure∣ly.
The path of the just is as the shining
light:</HI> And it shall <HI>shine more and more unto
the perfect day.</HI></P>

under those distresses, religion performs
two offices: it teaches us how we ought

bearing them. Materials for both are
found in the words of the text, which
contain a sentiment so natural and just,
as to carry conviction to every reasonable
mind. They were the words of Job, at

is not necessary to bestow much illustra∣tion
It is evident to the slightest inspec∣tion,
that nothing here is unallayed and
pure. Every man's state is checquered
with alternate griefs and joys, disappoint∣ment
and success. No condition is alto∣gether
stable. No life preserves always
the same tenor. The vicissitudes of the
world sometimes bring forward the af∣flicted
into more comfortable circumstan∣ces;
and often trouble the joy of the pro∣sperous.
This is the train in which hu∣man
affairs have ever been found to pro∣ceed;
and in which we may expect them
always to go on.</P>
<P>But though this be universally admit∣ted
in speculation, and often confessed in
discourse, the misfortune is, that few think
of applying it to their own case. The
bulk of mankind discover as much confi∣dence
in prosperity, and as much impa∣tience
under the least reverse, as if Pro∣vidence
<PB N="338" REF="347"/>
had first given them assurance
that their prosperity was never to change,
and afterwards had cheated their hopes.
Whereas, what reason ought to teach us,
is, to adjust our mind to the mixed state
in which we find ourselves placed; never
to presume, never to despair; to be thank∣ful
for the goods which at present we en∣joy,
and to expect the evils that may suc∣ceed.
—Thou hast been admitted to partake
of the feast of life,. Its good things are
distributed, in various portions, among the
guests. thou hast had thine allotted
share. Complain not, when they portion
is removed. It is not permitted to any
one, to remain always at the banquet.</P>
<P>II. We are taught by the text, that both
the goods and the evils which compose
this mixed state, come from the hand of
God. A little reflection may convince
us, that, in God's world, neither good nor
evil can happen by chance. If there were
any one moment, in which God quitted
the reins of the universe, and suffered any
<PB N="339" REF="348"/>
power to interfere with his administra∣tion,
it is evident, that, from that moment,
the measures of his government must be∣come
disjointed and incomplete. He
who governs all things, must govern con∣tinually;
and govern the least things as
well as the greatest. <HI>He never slumbers
nor sleeps.</HI> There are no void spaces, no
broken plans, in his administration; no
blessings that drop upon us without his
intention; nor any crosses that visit us,
unsent by him. <HI>I am the Lord, and there
is none else. I form the light, and create
darkness. I make peace, and create evil. I
the Lord do all these things,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> xlv. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>How it has come to pass, that this life
should contain such a mixture of goods
and evils, and that the mixture too should
be of God's appointment, gives rise to a
difficult inquiry. for how can any thing
but what is good proceed from the God
of love? Can darkness issue form the
<PB N="340" REF="349"/>
source of light? or can it be any satis∣faction
to the <HI>Father of mercies,</HI> to behold
the sorrows of creatures whom he has
made?—Here there was room for much
perplexity, till revelation informed us, that
the mixture of evils in man's estate is ow∣ing
to man himself. Had he continued
as God originally made him, he would
have received nothing but good from his
Creator. His apostasy and corruption o∣pened
the gates of the tabernacle of dark∣ness.
Misery issued forth, and has ever
since pursued him. In the present condi∣tion
of his nature, that misery is partly
punishment,
partly trial. He is become
incapable to bearing uninterrupted pro∣sperity;
and by the mixture of evils in
his lot, merciful designs are carried on for
his improvement and restoration.</P>
<P>What the text leads us at present to con∣sider
is, the effect that will follow from
imitating the example of Job, and refer∣ring
to the hand of the Almighty, the evils
which we suffer, as well as the goods which
we enjoy. Such a reference of the di∣stressful
<PB N="341" REF="350"/>
events of our life to the appoint∣ment
of Heaven, not only is a duty which
piety requires, but tends also to mitigate
distress, and to suggest consolation. For
to dwell, as is too commonly done, upon
the instruments and subordinate means of
our trouble, is frequently the cause of
much grief, and much sin. When we
view our sufferings as proceeding merely
from our fellow-creatures, the part which
they have acted in bringing them upon
us, is often more grating than the suffer∣ing
itself. The unreasonableness, perhaps,
of an enemy, the treachery of a friend,
the ingratitude or insolence of one whom
we had much obliged, add weight to a
load laid upon us by means so provoking
The thoughts of their malignity, or of our
own neglect in guarding against it, serve
to poison the sore. Whereas, if instead of
looking to men, we beheld the cross as
coming from God, these aggravating cir∣cumstances
would affect us less; we would
feel no more than our proper burden;
<PB N="342" REF="351"/>
we would submit to it more patiently;
and many resources would open to us, as
shall in a little be shouwn, from thinking
of the hand that lays it on. Had job,
when despoiled of all his substance, thought
of nothing but the Chaldeans and Sabeans
who robbed him, with what violent pas∣sions
would he have been transported, and
with what eager disires of revenge tor∣mented?
Whereas, considering them as
rods and instruments only in the divine
hand, and receiving the correction as from
the Almighty himself, the tumult of his
mind subsided; and with respectful com∣posure
he could say, <HI>The Lord gave; and
the Lord hath taken away: Blessed be the
name of the Lord.</HI> This leads me.</P>
<P>III. To consider the last, and most im∣portent
instructions, arising from the text;
namely, that there are many reasons why
we, who receive good from the hand of
God, should receive with patience the
Evils which he is pleased to inflict. This
Is strongly conveyed by that interoga∣tory
<PB N="343" REF="352"/>
from of speech, in which the senti∣ment
of job is expressed: <HI>What we
receive good at the hand of God, and shall
we not receive evil?</HI> In order to unfold all
that is contained in this appeal made to eve∣ry
man's conscience, let us consider,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> place, that the good things
which God has bestowed, afford sufficient
evidence for our believing, that the evils
which he sends, are not can selessly or wan∣tonly
inflicted. Did we live in a world
which bore the marks of a malicious or
cruel governor, there might be reason for
distrusting every step of his conduct. But
in the world which we inhabit, we behold,
on the contrary, plain marks of predomi∣nant
goodness. we behold the structure of
the universe, the order of nature, the gene∣ral
course of Providence, obviously arranged
with a benevolent regard to the welfare of
men. All the art and contrivance of which
the divine works are full, point to this
end; and the more they are explored,
create the firmer belief, that the good∣ness
<PB N="344" REF="353"/>
of the Deity gave rise to the sys∣tem
of creation. What is the conclu∣sion
to be thence drawn, but that in such
parts of the divine administration as ap∣pear
to us harsh and severe, the same good∣ness
continues to preside, though exerci∣sed
in a hidden and mysterious manner?</P>
<P>Let me de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire you to consider, whether
if somepowerful friend had placed you
in an opulent and comfortable station,
and, in the general conduct of your a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>airs,
had discovered the most disinterested kind∣ness,
you would not ascribe any occasional
discouragements you received, to some un∣known
reason or cause rather than to his
unfaithfulness or cruelty? Ought not the
experience which we have had, and the
discovery which all nature affords, of the
divine goodness, lead us to put a like con∣struction
on the evils which we suffer
from a hand that hath so frequently load∣ed
us with good?—Have we forgotten,
in the midst of our complaints, who
brought us unto the light of day; who
watched over our helpless infancy; who
<PB N="345" REF="354"/>
reared our growing childhood; and
though ten thousand surrounding dan∣gers,
has been our protector and guardian
until this day? How often has he rescu∣ed
us from sickness and death, and made
our hearts glad with unexpected com∣forts?
Now, that some cloud is thrown o∣ver
our prosperity, or some blessing with∣drawn,
in which for a time we had rejoi∣ced,
can we imagine that there is no good
cause for this change of his proceeding?
Shall we suspect that his nature is entire∣ly
altered? <HI>Hath God forgotten to be gra∣cio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s?
Hath he in anger shut up his te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der
mercies?</HI> No, let us say with the psalmist,
<HI>This is my infirmity; but I will remember
the works of the Lord. I will remember the
years of the right hand of the most High</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. lxxvii ix. 10&gt;</NOTE>
—One signal works of the most High
at least, let us remember, and rejoice in
the remembrance of it; even that final
remedy which he has provided for all the
<PB N="346" REF="355"/>
evils occasioned by sin, in the redemption
of the world accomlished by Jesus Christ.
<HI>He who spared not his own Son, but deliver∣ed
him up for us all,</HI> will he, in any case,
wantonly assict the children of men with
supersluous and unnecessary, sorrows? Is
not this a proof so satisfactory, so express
and demonstratives, of the gracious pur∣poses
of God, as should dispose us to take
in good part, every thing which proceeds
from him? Consider,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, that the good things
we receive from God are undeserved, the
evils we suffer are justly merited. Every
reasonable person must feel the weight of
this consideration, for producing patience
and submission. For, thought to suffer at
any rate be grievus, yet to suffer unjust∣ly,
is double galling. Whereas, when
one receives a mixed portion, where of the
goods are above his deserts, and the evils
below his deserts, to complain, in such a
case, is unreasonable; there is more
ground for being thankful.—all its, is
<PB N="347" REF="356"/>
true, have not deserved evil equally. Yet
all of us deserve it more or less; and to
merit good at the hand of the Lord, is
what none of us can pretend. At the best
we are but <HI>unprofitable servants.</HI> Even this is
more than we are entitled to claim. For
if God were to <HI>enter into judgement</HI> with
us, who could stand before him? Who
could justify himself in his sight? When
the most inoffensive compare their con∣duct
with God's holy law; when they re∣flect
upon the duties they have omitted,
and the actual guilt they have contracted,
they will find more reason to accuse them∣selves,
than to complain of the divine
chastisment. Whatever innocence any
of us may plead, nay, whatever merit we
may claim, with respect to men and the
would, we suffer no more than what we
deserve from the Governor of the world,
and of his displeasure, we know that the
wrath of man is no other than the instru∣ment.</P>
<P>Not only all of us have done evil, but
what ought to be particularly attended
<PB N="348" REF="357"/>
to, God has just title to puni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h us for it
Although a man know that he deserves
punishment, yet he will not allow every
one to inflict it. A child will submit to his
parents, a servant to his master, a subject to
the magistrate, when he would not bear
correction from another hand. But no pa∣rent
can have so complete a right autho∣rity
over his children, no master over his
servants, no magistrate over his subjects, as
the Almighty hath over us. When we
were born, we brought nothing with us
into God's world. During our conti∣nuance
in it, we have lived on the good
things which God was pleased to lend
us; and of which, God and our own con∣science
know that we have made but a
sorry improvement. When he thinks
proper to take any of them away, no
wrong is done us; for they were not
ours. To have enjoyed them always, was
a favour. To enjoyed them so long, was
what we neither deserved, nor had any
title to expect.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="358"/>
In the <HI>third</HI> place, the good things
which at difference time we have received
and enjoyed, are much greater than the
evils which we suffer. Of this fact. I am
sensible is will be difficult to persuade the
afflicted. But would they weigh in a fair
balance, the whole of their circumstances,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey would find it true. Whateve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per∣sons
feel at the present, makes so strongs
an impression upon them, as very com∣monly
to obliterat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the memory of all the
past. when one is oppressed with some
painful desease in his body, or wru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g with
some sore distress of mind every former
comfort, at that moments, g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s for nothing
life is behold in all its gloom. A dark
cloud seems to hang over it; and it is re∣viled,
as no other than a scene of wretch∣edness
and sorrow. But this is to be un∣just
to human life, as well as ungratefu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to its author.—Let me only desire you
to think how many days, how many
months, how many years, you have passed
in health, and ease, and comfort; how
many pleasurable feelings you have had;
<PB N="350" REF="359"/>
how many friends you have enjoyed;
how many blessings, in short, of differ∣rent
kinds you have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asted; and you will
be forced to acknowledge, that more ma∣terials
of thanksiving present themselves
than of la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entation and complaint.—
These blessings, you will say, are past.
But though past, ought they to be gone
from your remembrance? Do they merit
no place, in the comparative estimate of
the goods and evils of your state? Did
you could you, expect, that in this muta∣ble
world, any temporal joy was to last
for ever? Has gratitude no influence to
form your minds to a calm acquiescence
in your Benefactor's appointments? What
can be more reasonable than to say, “Hav∣ing
in former times received so many
good things from the hand of God,
shall I not now, without murmuring,
receive the few evils which it pleases
him to send?”</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fourth</HI> place, not only the goods
of life are upon the whole greater than
<PB N="351" REF="360"/>
its evils; but the evils which we suffer
are seldom, or never, without some mix∣ture
of good. As there is no condition
on earth of pure unmixed selicity, so there
is none so miserable, as to be destitute of
every comfort. Entire and complete mi∣sery,
if ever it take place, is of our own
procuring, not of God's sending. None
but the most gross and atrocious sinners
can be in such a situation, as to discover
no ray of relief of hope. In the ordina∣ry
distresses of life, it if generally our
own folly and infirmity which, upon the
loss of some one blessing that we had
highly prized, deprives us of satisfaction
in all other things. Many of our cala∣mities
are purely imaginary, and self-cre∣ated;
arising <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom rivalship or competi∣tion
with others, and from false opinions
of the importance of objects, to which
custom and fashion have annexed an ideal
value. Were these mistaken opinions
once corrected by reason, the evil would
disappear, and contentment would resume
its place. With respect to those calami∣ties
<PB N="352" REF="361"/>
which are inflicted by God, his pro∣vidence
has made this wise and merciful
constitution, that, after the first shock, the
burden by degrees is lightened. Time
brings a gentle and powerful opiate to all
misfortunes. What is very violent can∣not
last long; and what lasts long we be∣come
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccustomed to bear. Every situation
that is permanent, at length is felt to be
tolerable. The mind accommodates it∣self
to it; and by degrees regains its u∣sual
tranquility. Hence the greatest part
of the evils of life are more terrible in the
previo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s apprehension, than in the actual
feeling; and it seldom happens but, in
one corner of other, something is found
on which the mind can lay hold for its
relief.</P>
<P>How many, for instance, do we behold
around us, straitened in their worldly
circumstances, and yet finding the means
to live cheerfully, with poverty and peace
in the same habitation? If we are deprive∣ed
of friends whom we tenderly loved,
are there not still some remaining, from
<PB N="353" REF="362"/>
whom we may expect much confort? If
our bodies are afflicted with sore disease,
have we not reason to be thankful that
our mind continues vigorous and entire;
that we are in situation to look around
us for whatever can afford us ease; and
that after the decay of this frail and moul∣dering
tabernacle, we can look forward to
a <HI>house not made with han<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s eternal in the
heavens?</HI>—In the midst of all distresses,
there remains to every sincere Christian,
that mixture of pure and genuine conso∣lation,
which springs from the promises
and hopes of the gospel. Consider, I be∣seech
you, what a singularly happy dis∣tinction
this makes in your situation, be∣yond
the state of those who, under the va∣rious
troubles of life, are left <HI>without hoe,
and without God in the world;</HI> without
any thing to look to, but a train of un∣known
cause and accidents, in which
they see no light nor comfort.—Thank
the Father of mercies, that into all the e∣vils
he sends, he infuses this joyful hope,
that the <HI>sufferings of the present time are
<PB N="354" REF="363"/>
not worthy to be compared with the glory
that shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealed</HI> in the end, to the
virtuous and good.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fifth</HI> and last place, as the evils
which we suffer are thus alleviated by a
mixture of good; so we have reason to be∣lieve,
that the evils themselves are, in ma∣ny
respects, good. When borne with pa∣tience
and dignity, they improve and e∣noble
our character. They bring into
exercise several of the manly and heroic
virtues; and by the constancy and fide∣lity
with which we support our trials on
earth, prepare us for the hightst rwards
in heaven.—It has always been found
that the present constitution of human na∣ture
cannot bear uninterrupted prosperi∣ty,
without being corrupted by it. The
poisonous weeds which spring up in that
too luxuriant soil, require the hand of ad∣versity
to extirpate them. It is the expe∣rience
of sorrow and distress that subdues
the arrogance of price, tames the violence
of passion, softenss the hardness of the sel∣fish
<PB N="355" REF="364"/>
heart, and humanizes the temper to
feel for the woes of others. Many have
had reason to say, that <HI>it was good for them
to be afflicted</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. cxix. 71.</NOTE>, <HI>When men take the tim∣brel
and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of
the organ,</HI> they are apt to <HI>say unto God,
Depart from us, for we desire not the know∣ledge
of thy ways. What is the Almighty
that we should serve him? But when they
are holden in cords of affliction, then he shew∣eth
them their works, and their transgressions
that they have exceeded. He openeth also
their ear to discipline and commandeth that
they return from iniquity</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xxi. 12—xxxvi. 8.</NOTE>. Is his case to
be deplored as highly calamitous, who by
forfeiting some transient enjoyments of the
world, purchases lasting improvement in
piety and virtue, and exchanges a few of
the good things of this life for the better
things of another?</P>
<P>INFLUENCED by such considerations as
these, let us look up with reverence to the
<PB N="356" REF="365"/>

distress with which he is pleased to visit
us, let us utter no other voice but this;
<HI>Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
and shall we not receive evil?</HI>—Men a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
too often ingenious in making themselves
miserable, by aggravating to their own
fancy, beyond bounds, all the evils which
they endure. They compare themselves
with none but those whom they imagine
to be more happy; and complain that up-on
them alone his fallen the whole load of
human sorrows. Would they look with
a more impartial eye on the world, they
would see themselves surrounded with
sufferers; and find that they are only
drinking out of that mixed cup, which
Providence has prepared for all.—“I will
“restore your daughter again to life,”
said the Eastern sage, to a prince who
grieved immoderately for the loss of a be∣loved
child, “provided, you are able to
engrave on her tomb the names of three
persons who have never mourned.” The
prince made inquiry after such persons;

is of great importance in religion.
The duties which spring from that charac∣ter,
form many branches of the great law
of charity, which is the favourite precept
of Christianity. They, therefore, who
would separate such duties from a religious
spirit, or who at most treat them as only
<PB N="359" REF="368"/>
the inferior parts of it do a real injury to
religion. They are mistaken friends of
piety, who, under the notion of exalting
it, place it in a sort of insulated cor∣ner,
disjoined from the ordinary affairs
of the world, and the connections of
men with one another. On the contra∣ry,
true piety influences them all. It
acts as a vivifying spirit, which animates
and enlivens, which rectifies and conducts
them. It is no less friendly to men than
zealous for the honour of God; and by
the generous affections which it nourish∣es,
and the beneficent influence which it
exerts on the whole of conduct, is fully
vindicated from every reproach which
the infidel would throw upon it.—In this
view, I am now to discourse on the na∣ture
and duties of virtuous friendship, as
closely connected with the true spirit of
religion. It is a subject which the inspi∣red
philosopher, who is the author of this
book of Proverbs, has thought worthy of
his repeated notice; and in many passages
has bestowed the highest elogiums on
<PB N="360" REF="369"/>
friendship among good men. <HI>As ointment
and perfume rejoice the heart, so doth the
suceetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth
the countenance of his friend. Make sure of
thy friend; for faithful are the wounds of a
friend. A friend loveth at all times; and
a brother is born for adversity. There is a
friend that sticketh closer than a brother.—
Thine o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n friend, and thy father's friend,</HI> it is said in the text, <HI>forsake not.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST begin the subject, by observing,
that there are among mankind friend∣ship
of different kinds, or, at least, con∣nexions
which assume that name. when
they are no more than confederacies of
bad men, they ought to be called conspi∣racies,
rather than friendships. Some bond
of common interest, some league against
the innocent and unsuspecting, may have
united them for a time. But they are
held together only by a rope of sand.
At bottom they are all rivals, and hostile
to one another. Their friendship can
<PB N="361" REF="370"/>
subsist no longer than interest cements
them. Every one looks with a jealous
eye on his supposed friend; and watches
the first favourable opportunity to desert,
or to betray.</P>
<P>Friendships too there are of a diffe∣rent
kind, and of a more respectable na∣ture,
formed by the connection of politi∣cal
parties. It is not, perhaps, on selfish
or crooked design that such friendships
are originally founded. Men have been
assiciated together by some public interest,
or general cause, or for defence aginst
some real or imagined danger; and con∣nexions
thus formed, often draw men into
close union, and insire for a season no
small degree of cordial attachment. When
upon just and honourable principles this
union is founded, it has proved, on va∣rious
occasions, favourable to the cause of
liberty and good order among mankind.
At the same time, nothing is more ready
to be abused than the name of public spi∣rit,
and a public cause. It is a name, un∣der
which private interest is often shelter∣ed
<PB N="362" REF="371"/>
and selfish design are carried on.
The unwary are allured by a specious ap∣pearance;
and the heat of faction usurps
the place of the generous warmth of
freindship.</P>
<P>IT is not of such friendship, whether
of the laudable or the suspicious kind,
that I am now to discourse; but of pri∣vate
friendship, which grow neither out
of interested design, nor party zeal; but
which slow from that similarity of dispo∣stions,
that corresponding harmony of
minds, which enders some person to our
heart, and makes us take as much part in
his circumstances, fortunes, and fate, as if
they were our own. <HI>The soul of Jonathan
was knit with the soul of David; and Jo∣nathan
loved him as his own soul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel xviii. 1.</NOTE>. Such
friendship certainly are not unreal; and
for the honour of human nature, it is to
be hoped are not altogether unfrequent
<PB N="363" REF="372"/>
among mankind.—Happy it is, when
they take root in our early years; and
are engrafted on the ingenuous sensibility
of youth. Friendship then contracted, re∣tain
to the last a tenderness and warmth,
seldom possessed by friendship that are
formed in the riper periods of life. The
remembrance of antient and youthful con∣nections
melts every human heart; and
the dissolution of them is, perhaps, the
most painful feeling to which we are ex∣posed
here below.—But at whatever pe∣riod
of life friendship are formed, as long
as they continue sincere and affectionate
they form undoubtedly, one of the great∣est
belssing we can enjoy. By the pleas∣ing
communication of all our sentiments
which they prompt, they are justly said
to double our pleasure, and to divide our
sorrows. They give brighter sunshine
to the gay incidents of life; and they en∣lighten
the gloom of its darker hours. <HI>A
faithful friend,</HI> it is justly and beautifully
said, by one of the Apocryphal writers,
<PB N="364" REF="373"/>
<HI>is the medicine of life</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecclesiasticus vi. 16.</NOTE>. A variety of oc∣casion
happen, when to pour forth the
heart to one whom we love and trust, is
the chief comfort, perhaps the only relief,
we can enjoy. Miserable is he who, shut
up within the narrow inclosure of selfish
interest, has no person to whom he can
at all times, with full confidence, expand
his soul.</P>
<P>SINCE cordial friendship is so great a
blessing to human life, let us proceed to
consider what duties it requires, and by
what methods it may be cultivated to
most advantage. The fundamental qua∣lities
of true friendship are, constancy and
sidelity. Without these material ingre∣dients,
it is of no value. An inconstant
man is not capable of friendship. He
may perhaps have affections which occa∣sionally
glow in his heart; which excite
fondness for amiable qualities; or connect
<PB N="365" REF="374"/>
him with seeming attachment to one
whom he esteems, or to whom he has
been obliged. But after these feelings
have lasted for a little, either fancied in∣terst
alienates him, or some new object
attracts him; and he is no longer the
same person to those whom he once loved.
A man of this inconstant mind cannot be
said to have any mind at all. For where
there is no fixedness of moral principle,
occasional feelings are of no value; mind
is of no effect; and with such person it
is never desirable to have any connexion.
Where constancy is wanting, there can be
no fidelity, which is the other basis of
friendship. For all friendship supposes
entire confidence and trust; supposes the
seal of secrecy to be inviolable; supposes
promises and engagements to be sacred;
and no advantage of our own to be pur∣sud,
at the expence of our friend's honour.
An inconstant man, is despicable. A faith∣less
man, is base.</P>
<P>But supposing neither constancy nor fi∣delity
to be altogether wanting, still how∣ever
<PB N="366" REF="375"/>
friendship is in hazard of suffering
from the follies, and unreasonable hu∣mours,
to which all of us are liable. It
it to be regarded as a tender plant in an
unfavourable soil, which, in order to its
flourishing, requires to be reared and
nursed with care. The following direc∣tions
may be of use for promoting its cul∣tivation,
and preserving it from whatever
might be apt to blast and wither it.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> place, let me advise you not
to expect perfection in any with whom
you contract friendship. It holds in ge∣neral,
with respect to all worldly pursuits,
that the more moderate our expectations
are, they are likely to be the more success∣ful.
If, in any situatin of life, we hope
to posses complete happiness, we may de∣pend
on receiving mortifications. If, in
any person, we trust to find nothing but
perfection we may be assured that, on
longer acquaintance, we shall meet with
disappointments. In the case of friend∣ship,
this admonition is the more necessa∣ry
<PB N="367" REF="376"/>
to be given, as a certain warmth and
enthusiasm belong to it, which are apt to
carry us beyond the bounds of nature.
In young minds, especially, a disposition
of this kind is often found to take place.
They form to themselves romantic ideas,
gathered perhaps from fictitious histories,
of the high and heroic qualities which be∣long
to human nature. All those qua∣lities,
they ascribe, without reserve or li∣mitation
to the person with whom they
wish to enter into intimate friendship;
and on the least failure appearing, aliena∣tion
instantly follows. Hence many a
friendship, hastily perhaps contracted, is
as hastily dissolved, and disgust succeeds
to violent attachment.—Remember, my
friends, they a faultless character on earth
is a mere chimera. Many failings you
experience in yourselves. Be not surpri∣sed,
when you discover the like in others,
of whom you had formed the highest o∣pinion.
The best and most estimable
persons are they, in whom the fewest ma∣terial
defects are found; and whose great
<PB N="368" REF="377"/>
and solid qualities counterbalance the
common infirmities of men. It is to
these qualities you are to look in forming
friendship; to good sense and prudence,
which constitute the basis of every respec∣table
character; to virtue, to good tem∣per
to steadiness of affection; and accord∣ing
to the union of those dispositions,
esteem yourselves happy in the friend
whom you chuse.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, I must admonish
you not to be hurt by differences of opi∣nion
afising in intercourse with your
friends. It is impossible for these not to
occur. Perhaps no two persons were e∣ver
cast so exactly in the same mould, as
to think always in the same manner, on
every subject. It was wisely contrived by
Providence, that diversity of sentiment
should take place among men, on purpose
to exercise our faculties, and to give varie∣ty
to human life. Perpetual uniformity
of thought would become monotonous
and insipid.—When it is with regard to
<PB N="369" REF="378"/>
trifles that diversity or contrariety of opi∣nions
shows itself, it is childish in the last
degree, it this become the ground of e∣stranged
affection. When from such a
cause there arises any breach of friend∣ship,
human weakness is then discovered
in a mortifying light. In matters of se∣rious
moment, the sentiments of the best
and worthiest may vary from those of
their friends, according as their lines of
life diverge, or as their temper, and habits
of thought, present objects under different
points of view. But among candid and
liberal minds, unity of affection will still
be preserved. No man has any title to
erect his own opinions into an universal
and infallible standard: And the more en∣larged
that any man's mind is, the more
readily he will overlook difference in sen∣timents,
as long as he is persuaded that
he follows the dictates of conscience and
integrity.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="379"/>
IN the <HI>third</HI> place, it is material to the
preservation of friendship, that openness
of temper and manners, on both hands
be cultivated. Nothing more certainly
dissolves friendship, than the jealousy
which arises from darkness and conceal∣ment.
If your situation oblige you to
take a different side from your friend, do
it openly. Avow your conduct; avow
your motives; as far as honour allows,
disclose yourselves frankly; seek no cover
from unnecessary and mysterious secrecy.
Mutual confidence is the soul of friend∣ship.
As soon as that is destroyed, or
Even impaired, it is only a show of friend∣ship
that remains. What was once cor∣dial
intimacy, degenerates first into formal
civility. Constraint on both sides next
succeeds; and disgust or hatred soon fol∣low.
—The maxim that has been laid
down by certain crooked politicians, to
behave to a friend with the same guarded
caution as we would do to an enemy, be∣cause
it is possible that he may one day
become such, discovers a mind which never
<PB N="371" REF="380"/>
was made for the enjoyments of friendship.
It is a maxim which, not unreasonlably I
admit, may find place in those political
and party friendships, of which I before
spoke, where personal advancement is al∣ways
in view. But it is altogether incon∣sistent
with the spirit of those friendship,
which are formed, and understood go be
nourished, by the heart.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fourth</HI> advice which I give is, To
cultivate, in all intercourse among friends,
gentle and obliging manners. It is a com∣mon
error to suppose, that familiar intima∣cy
supersedes attention to the lesser duties
of behaviour; and that, under the notion
of freedom, it may excuse a careless, or
even a rough, demeanour. On the con∣trary,
an intimate connection can only be
kept up, by a constant wish to be pleasing
and agreeable. The nearer and closer that
men are brought together, the more fre∣quent
that the points of contact between
them become, there is the greater necessity
for the surface being smooth, and every
<PB N="372" REF="381"/>
thing being removed that can grate or of∣fend.
—Let no harshness no appearance of
neglect, no supercilious affectation, of su∣priority,
occur in the intercourse of
friends. A part reply, a proneness to re∣buke,
a captious and contradictious spirit,
are often known to embitter domestic life,
and set friends at variance. In those
smaller articles of behaviour, where men are
too apt to be careless, and to indulge their
humour without restraint, the real cha∣racter
is often understood to break forth,
and shew itself. It is by no means e∣nough,
that, in all matters of serious in∣terest,
we think ourselves ready to prove
the sincerity of our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>hip. These
occur more rarely. The o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary tenor
of life is composed of small duties and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f∣fices,
which men have occasion daily to
perform; and it is only by rendering dai∣ly
behaviour agreeable, that we can long
preserve the comforts of friendship.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fifth</HI> place, let me caution you
not to listen rashly to evil reports against
<PB N="373" REF="382"/>
your friends. When upon proper grounds
you have formed a connection, be flow of
believing any thing against the friend whom
you have chosen. Remember, that there
is among mankind a spirit of malignity,
which too often takes pleasure in disturb∣ing
the society of those who appear to en∣joy
one another. The scripture hath warn∣ed
us, that there is a <HI>whisperer who sepa∣rateth
chief friends; there is a false witness
who so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth discord among brethren.</HI> Give
not therefore a ready ear to the officious
insinuations of those who, under the guise
of friendly concern, come to admonish
you, that you ought to stand on your guard
against those whom they see you disposed
to trust. consider, whether, under this fair
appearance, there may not lurk some se∣cret
envy and rivalry, or some, concea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
interest. chase not every flying report.
Suffer not the poison of jealousy easily to
taint your mind, and break your peace.
A wide difference there is between that
weak credulity which allows itself to be
imposed upon blindly, and that dark and
<PB N="374" REF="383"/>
suspicious spirit which is always inclined
to the evil side. It forms part of the cha∣rcter
of a wise and good man, that he is
not prone to <HI>to take up reproach against his
neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>sixth</HI> and last place, let me exhort
you not to desert your friend in danger
of distress. Too many there are in the
world, whose attachment to those they
call their friends is confined to the day of
their prosperity. As long as that conti∣nues,
they are, or appear to be, affection∣ate
and cordial. But as soon as their
friends is under a cloud, they begin to
withdraws, and to separate their interests
from his. In friendship of this sort, the
heart, assuredly, has never had much con∣cern.
For the great test of true friendship,
is constancy in the hour of danger, adhe∣rence
in the season of distress.—When
your friend is calumniated, then is the
time, openly and boldly to espouse his
cause. When his situation is changed, or
his fortunes are falling, then is the time of
<PB N="375" REF="384"/>
affording prompt and zealous aid. When
sickness of infirmity occasion him to be
neglected by others, that is the opportu∣nity
which every real friend will seize, of
redoubling all the affectionate attentions
which love suggests. These are the im∣portant
duties, the sacred claims of friend∣ship
which religion and virtue enforce on
every worthy mind.—To show yourselves
warm, after this manner, in the cause of
your friend, commands esteem, even from
those who have personal interest in oppos∣ing
him. This honourable zeal of friend∣ship,
has, in every age, attracted the vene∣ration
of mankind. It has consecrated
to the latest posterity the names of those
who have given up their fortunes, and
have even exposed their lives, in behalf
of the friends whom they loved; while
ignominy and disgrace have ever been the
portion of them, who deserted their friends
in the evil day. <HI>Thine own friend forsake not.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE concluding, it must not be
forgotten that the injunction of the Wise
<PB N="376" REF="385"/>
Man in the text, is accompanied with this
remarkable expression; not only <HI>thine
own friend,</HI> but also <HI>thy father's friend
forsake not.</HI> These words bring back to our
remembrance the days of former years;
and suggest f sentiment, which cannot but
touch every feeling heart. Thine own
friend may be dear; thy father's friend
ought to be sacred. As long as life re∣mains
in any human breast, the memory
of those antient ties should remain, which
connected us once with our father, and
our father's house.—Thy father has per∣haps,
long ago, gone down to the dust.
But when you recal the innocent days of
childhood and youth; when you think of
those family transactions which once glad∣dened
your hearts; your father's friend, in
the midst of these, will rise to your re∣membrance.
There was a time when you
accosted him with respect, or looked up to
him with fondness, and was made happy
by his kindly notice. Does such a one
now survive, and shall he not receive
<PB N="377" REF="386"/>
from you some portion of filial reverence
and honour? To disregard and neglect
him, is to spurm your father's memory;
is to insult the ashes of him who now
sleeps in the grave; is to transmit your∣selves
to those who shall succeed you, as
unfeeling and base. <HI>Thine own friend,
and they father's friend, forsake not.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE pointed out some of the chief
duties which belong to virtuous friend∣ship;
and some of the principal means
by which this sacred bond should be pre∣served
unbroken; this holy flame should
be kept alive in the human breast. the
spirit, and sentiments, which I have stu∣died
to inspire are such as virtue breathes,
and such as true piety should increase.
it is thus we fulfil that great law of love,
which our divine Master taught. It is
thus we prepare ourselves for those happy
regions, where <HI>charity never faileth;</HI> where
in the presence of the God of love, eternal
and invariable friendship unite together
<PB N="378" REF="387"/>
all the blessed; friendships, which, by no
human infirmity disturbed, by death ne∣ver
separated, shall constitue throughout
endless ages, a great and distinguished
portion of the celestial felicity.</P>

<P>FROM these words I purpose to dis∣course
of the proper conduct which
we ought to hold with regard to futuri∣ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVIII.</NOTE>
amidst the present uncertainties of life.
Time and life are always going on, and
to each of us are preparing changes in our
state. What these may be, whether for
the better or for the worse, we cannot tell;
<PB N="380" REF="389"/>
as it hath pleased the wisdom of provi∣dence,
to cover futurity with a veil which
no mortal can lift up. In the mean time
none of us can avoid forming designs,
and laying plans, for the time to come.
The present moment is never sufficient
to give full employment to the active
mind of man, without some excursions in∣to
futurity; and in these excursions, the
present is often wholly spent. It is there∣fore
of the hightest consequence, that a pro∣per
direction be given to the mind, in its
employments of thought relating to fu∣turity.
Otherwise, in the prospects which
we take of that unknown region, false
hopes, or ill-grounded fears, shall flatter
or torment us in vain. <HI>Il' kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w not</HI> as
the Wise Man tells us, <HI>what a day may
bring forth.</HI> It may, very probable, pro∣duce
something that we had not looked
for; and therefore, insted of <HI>boasting our∣selves
of to morrow,</HI> as the multitude are
apt to do, it becomes us to be disciplined
and prepared, for whatever it may bring.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="390"/>
It is needless to spend much time in
confirming the truth, which is the foun∣dation
of the admonition in the text; in
proving, either that change and mutability
belong to our present state, or that the
changes of it cannot be foreseen by us.
These are truths so obvious and confes∣sed,
that an attempt to confirm them is
like proving, that all men are to die. At
the same time, obvious as they are, it were
to be wished, that the thoughts of men
dwelt upon them more. For, by a strange
but prevailing deception, it would seem,
from the general conduct of mankind,
that almost every one thinks his own case
an exception from the general law; and
that he may build plans with as much
confidence on his present situation, as if
some assurance had been given him that
it were never to change. Hence it has
been often observed by serious persons,
that there is no more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eneral cause to
which the vices of men can be ascribed,
their forgetfulnes of God and their ne∣glect
of duty, than to their presuming
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
upon the continuance of life, of pleasure,
and prosperity.</P>
<P>Look but a little way, my friends, into
your own state; and you must unavoid∣ably
perceive that, from the beginning, it
has been so contrived by Providence, that
there shold be no permanent stability to
man's condition on earth. The seeds of
alteration are every where sown. In your
health, life, possessions, connections, plea∣sures,
there are cause of decay impercep∣tible
working; secretly undermining the
foundations of what appears to you the
most stable; continually tending, to abo∣lish
the present form of things, and to
bring forward new appearances, and new
objects in their order: So that nothing is
or can be, stationary on earth. All chan∣ges,
and passes. It is a stream which is ever turn∣ing
round. When you behold the tree
covered with blossoms in the spring, or
loaded with fruit in the autumn, as well
may you imagine, that those blossom, or
that fruit, are to remain in their place
<PB N="383" REF="392"/>
through the whole year, as believe that
human affairs are to continue, for to-day
and to-morrow, for this year and the next,
proceeding in the same tenor.—To render
this reflection still more serious, think, I
pray you, on what small and inconsidera∣ble
causes those changes depend, which
affect the fortunes of men, throughout
their whole lives. How soon is evil done!
There needs no great bustle or stir, no long
preparation of events, to overturn what
seems most secure, and to blast what ap∣pears
most slourishing. A gale of wind
rises on the ocean; and the vessel which
carried our friends, or our fortunes, is o∣verwhelmed
in the deep. A spark of a
candle falls by night in some neglected
corner; and the whole substance of fami∣lies
is consumed in flames before the
morning. A casual blow, or a sudden
fall, deranges some of our internal parts;
and the rest of life is distress and misery.
It is awful to think, at the mercy of how
many seeming contingencies we perpe∣tually
<PB N="384" REF="393"/>
lie, for what we call happiness in
this world.</P>
<P>In the midst, however, of all these ap∣parent
contingencies, plans and designs
for the future are every day formed; pur∣suits
are undertaken; and life proceeds in
its usu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l train. Fit and proper it is, that
life should thus proceed. For the uncer∣tainty
of to-morrow was never disigned
by Providence, to deter us from acting or
planning to day; but only to admonish
us, that we ought to plan, and to act, sober∣ly
and wisely.—What that wise and sober
conduct is which becomes us, what the
rules and precautions are, which, in such
a state as ours, respect futurity, I now pro∣ceed
to show. They may be compre∣hended
in the following directions. Boast
not thyself of to-morrow; Despair not of
to-morrow; Delay not till to-morrow what
is proper to be done to day; Prepare thy∣self
for whatever to-morrow may bring
forth; Build thy hopes of hapiness on
something more solid and lasting than
<PB N="385" REF="394"/>
what either today or to-morrow will pro∣duce.</P>
<P>I. IN the words of the text, <HI>Boast not
theyself of to-morrow;</HI> that is, never pre∣sume
arrogantly on futurity; in the most
fair and promising state of fortune beware
of pride and vanity; beware of resting
wholly upon yourselves, and forgetting
Him who direct the changes of this mu∣table
state. If there be any virtues, which
the uncertain condition of the world in∣culcate
on man, they are, assuredly, mo∣duration
and humility Man was, for
this end, placed in a world, where he
knows so little of what is before him, that
he might be impressed with a sense of his
dependence on the Ruler of the world;
that he might feel the importance of ac∣quiring
favour and protection from Hea∣ven.
by a lise of piety and virtue; and
that, not knowing how soon his own con∣dition
may be the same with that of the
most wretched, he might be prompted to
act towards all his brethren the humane
<PB N="386" REF="395"/>
and friendly part.—The favours which
Providence bestows upon him at present,
he ought to receive with thankfulness,
and may enjoy with chearfulness. Though
commanded not to <HI>boast himself of to-morrow,</HI>
the meaning of the precept is not, that he
must be sad to day. Rejoice he may in
the day of prosperity; but certainly, <HI>Re∣joice
with trembling,</HI> is the inscription that
should be written on all human pleasure.</P>
<P>As for them who, intoxicated with those
pleasures, become giddy and insolent;
who, flattered by the illusions of prospe∣rity,
make light of every serious admoni∣tion
which the changes of the world give
them, what can I say too strong to alarm
them of their danger?—They have said
to themselves, <HI>My mountain stands strong,
and shall never be moved. To-morrow shall
be as this day, and more abundantly. I shall
never see adversity.</HI>—Rash and wretched
men! are you sensible how impious such
words are? To the world, perhaps you
dare not utter them; but they speak the
secret language of your hearts. Know

you are usurping upon Providence; you
are setting Heaven at defiance; you are
not only preparing sharper stings for your∣selves,

you are fast bringing ruin upon your own
heads. For God will not suffer pride in
man; and the experience of all ages hath
shown, how careful he is to check it. In
a thousand memorable instances, the course
of his government has been visibly point∣ed
against it. <HI>He sheweth strenght with
his arm, and scattereth the proud in the ima∣ginations
of their hearts. The day of the

are we to despair, of to-morrow. The
former admonition was directed to those
who presperity had elated with vain
hopes. This is designed for those whom
a more adverse situation in life has filled
with fears and alarms of what is to come.
The reason of both admonitions is the

bring forth.</HI> It may bring forth some un∣expected
misfortune; and therefore thou
shouldst be humble in prosperity. It may
bring forth some unforeseen relief; and
therefore thou shouldst hope under dis∣tress.
—It is too common with mankind,
to be totally engrossed, and overcome, by
present events. Their present condition,
whatever it is, they are apt to imagine,
will never change; and hence by prospe∣rity
they are lifted up, and by adversity are
dejected and broken; prone, in the on
case, to forget God, in the other, to re∣pine
aganst him. Whereas, the doctrine,
which the changes of the world pepetually
<PB N="389" REF="398"/>
inculcate is, that no state of external things
should, appear so important, or should so
affect and agitate our spirits, as to deprive
us of a calm, an equal, and steady mind.
Man knoweth neither the good, nor the
evil which is before him. In your <HI>patience,
therefore, possess your souls:</HI> trusting, in the
day of sorrow, that God hath not <HI>forgot∣ten
to be gracious:</HI> and that <HI>though weep∣ing
may endure for night, joy cometh to</HI>
the upright <HI>in the morning</HI></P>
<P>Distress not yourselves, then, with an∣xious
fears about to-morrow. Let me
exhort you to dismiss all solicitude, which
goes beyond the bounds of prudent pre∣caution.
Anxiety, when it seizes the
heart is a dangerous disease, productive
both of much sin, and much misery. It
acts as a corrosive of the mind. It eats
out our present enjoyments, and substi∣tutes
in there place, many an acute pain.
—The Wife Man, in the text, has advised
us <HI>not to boast of to-morrow;</HI> and our Sa∣viour
has instructed us to <HI>take no thought
<PB N="390" REF="399"/>
for to-morrow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. Vi. 33.</NOTE>. Both these directions,
properly understood, are entirely consist∣ent;
and the great rule of conduct, re∣specting
futurity, is compounded of them
both; requiring us, neither arrogantly
to presume on to-morrow, nor to be an∣xiously,
and fearfully solicitous about it.
<HI>The morrow,</HI> says our Saviour, <HI>shall take
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the things of itself.</HI> We shall
be better able to judge of the course most
proper for us to hold, when events have be∣gun
to come for ward in their order. Their
presence often suggests wiser counsels, and
more successful expedients, than it is pos∣sible
for us to contrive at a distance. By
excess of solicitude before hand, we fre∣quently
introduce that confusion of mind,
and that hurry and disorder of spirits,
which bring us into the most unfavour∣able
state for judging soundly.—Where∣fore
never indulge either anxiety, or de∣spair,
about futurity. Affright not your∣selves
<PB N="391" REF="400"/>
with imaginary terrors. Antici∣pate
not evil, which perhaps may never
come. Make the best which you can on
this day, in the fear of God, and in the
practice of your duty; and, having done
so leave to-morrow to itself. <HI>Sufficient
for the day,</HI> when it comes, <HI>will be the evil
thereof</HI></P>
<P>III. DELAY not till to-morrow any thing
which is fit and proper to be done to-day.
Remember, that thou art not the lord of
to-morrow. Thou art so far from having
any title to dispose of it, that thou art ig∣norant
of the most material circumstances
relating to it; not only of what it shall
bring forth, but whether thou shalt live to
see it.—Notwithstanding the uncontrover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible
evidence of this truth, procrastination
has, throughout every age, been the ruin
of mankind. Dwelling amidst endless
projects of what they are hereafter to do,
they cannot so properly be said to live, as
to be always about to live; and the fu∣ture
has ever been the gulph in which the
<PB N="392" REF="401"/>
present is swallowed up and lost.—Hence
arise many of those misfortunes which be∣fal,
men in their worldly concerns What
might at present be arranged in their cir∣cumstances
with advantage, being delay∣ed
to another opportunity, cannot be ar∣ranged
at all. To-morrow being loaded
with the concerns of to-day, in addition to
its own, is clogged and embarrassed. Af∣fairs,
which had been postponed,: multi∣ply
and crowd upon one another; till, at
last, they prove so intricate and perplexed,
and the pressure of business becomes so
great, that nothing is lest, but to sink un∣der
the burdern. Of him, therefore, who
indulges this lingering and delaying spi∣rit
in worldly matters, it is easy to prog∣nosticate
that the ruin is not far off.</P>
<P>Evils of the same kind, arising from the
same cause, overtake men, in their moral
and spiritual interests. There are few,
but who are sensible of some things in
their character and behaviour, which
ought to be corrected, and which, at one
time or other, they intend to correct;
<PB N="393" REF="402"/>
some headstrong passion, which de∣sign
to subdue; some bad habit, which they
purpose to reform; some dangerous con∣nection,
which they are resolved to break
off. But the convenient season for these
reformations is not yet come. Certain
obst, cles are in the way, which they ex∣pect
by and by to surmount; and there∣fore
they go on in peace for the present,
in their usual courses, tursting, at a future
day to begin their designed improvement.
In the mean time the angel of death de∣scends;
and in the midst of their distant
plans, executes his commission, and carries
them away.—Guard against delusions of
this kind, which have been fatal to so ma∣ny.
—Thou art now in tranquillity, in
health, in possession of a calm mind. Im∣prove
these advantages, for performing all
that becomes thee, as a man, and as a
Christian; for who can tell how long thou
shalt be permitted to enjoy them? New
alterations of fortune may be just coming
forward; new troubles in public, or in
private life, about to arise new exigencies
<PB N="394" REF="403"/>
ready to throw thee into some condition
which shall leave thee neither leisure nor
opportunity, to execute any of the good
purposes thou hast at present in thy mind.
Wherefore, trifle no longer with what is
so serious, and what may be so critical;
but <HI>to day, while it is called to day,</HI> listen
to the voice of God, and do his works.
<HI>Do now,</HI> as the Wise Man advises, <HI>with
thy might whatsoever thy band findeth to
do; for there is no work, nor device, nor
wisdom, in the grave whether thou goest</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ix. 10.</NOTE>
—Instead of delaying till to-morrow
what ought to be done to-day, let me ex∣hort
you,</P>
<P>IV. To every day prepared for what∣ever
to-morrow may bring forth. There
is a certain preparation for the vicissitudes
of life, in which the multitude are suffi∣ciently
busied providing, as they think, a∣gainst
whatever may happen, by increasing
<PB N="395" REF="404"/>
their riches, and strengthening themselves
by friends, connections, and worldly ho∣nours.
But these bulwarks which they
erect, are totally insusficient against the
drcaded storm. it is to some other quar∣ter
we must look for our defence; for
when it is the world itself whose changes
we have reason to dread, the world, and
the things of it, cannot afford us protec∣tion.
The best preparation for all the
uncertainties of futurity consists, in a well
ordered mind, a good conscience, and a
chearful submission to the will of Heaven.
You know not what shall be on to-mor∣row.
But there is One who knows it well;
for his decree hath fixed it. To him
look up with reverence; and say, <HI>“Not
my will but thine be done;</HI> what thou ap∣pointest
is ever wise, and just and good.”
Seek to fulfil the part which he hath as∣signed
you; to do the things which he hath
commanded you to do; and leave all the
rest to him. Whatever to-morrow brings
forth, let it find you employed <HI>in doing
<PB N="396" REF="405"/>
justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly
with your God;</HI> and then you shall meet
to-morrow without fear, when you meet
it without the upbraidings of guilt.</P>
<P>If if shall bring forth to you any unex∣pected
good, prepare to receive it with
gratitude, temperance, and modesty. If
it shall bring forth evil, prepare to receive
it with manly fortitude. Let no events
of any kind, derange your equanimity, or
shake your constancy. Contract your de∣sires,
and moderate your hopes. Expect
not more from the world than it is able to
afford you. Take it for granted that what
is naturally mutable, will one day change;
that what was designed to be transient,
will pass away.—Look forward to futu∣rity
without impatience. Be not desirous
to know it. It belongs to God. Let him
bring forward the events of the world, in
his own way. Imagine that you conti∣nually
hear those words, which our Lord
once addressed to Peter, when he was in∣quiring
about what was to happen to a
fellow disciple, <HI>What is that to thee? Fol∣low
<PB N="397" REF="406"/>
thou me.</HI> Amidst all the uncertainty
of future events, this road of clear and
plain duty lies before you; follow christ,
and inquire no farther. Seek no crooked
path, in order to avoid impending dan∣gers.
<HI>Turn not to the right hand, nor to
the left; but commit thy way unto the Lord;
trust also in him, and he shall bring to pass
the desires of thy heart.</HI></P>
<P>V. BUILD your hopes of happiness on
somewhat more solid and lasting than
what either to-day or to-morrow are like∣ly
to produce. From what has been said,
you may clearly perceive, that he who
rests wholly upon this world, builds his
house upon the sand. This life, by means
of wisdom and virtue, may be rendered to
a good man, a tolerable, nay a comfort∣able,
state. But he who expects complete
happiness from it, will be greatly deceived.
Man, in his most flourishing condition,
were much to be pitied, if he was desti∣tute
of any higher hope. Rolling from
<PB N="398" REF="407"/>
change to change, throughout all the days
of his life, with a dark and unknown
prospect always before him in futurity,
what would avail a few short interrupted
glimpses of happiness which, from time to
time, he was permitted to enjoy? Can we
believe, that only for such a state as this,
man was designed by his great and good
Creator?—No: Let us <HI>bless the God and
Father of our Lord jesus Christ, who, accord∣ing
to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us
again into a lively hope, by the resurrection of
Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incor∣ruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI>
Here is the Rock on which the mind, howe∣ver
tost by the storms of life, can securely
rest. Here is the object to which a wise
man will bend his chief attention, that, af∣ter
having acted his part on earth with
fidelity and honour, he may be enabled,
through the merits of his Saviour, to look
for a place in the mansions of eternal
and untroubled peace. This prospect is
the great corrective of the present vanity
of human life. It gives significancy and
<PB N="399" REF="408"/>
importance to its most transitory scenes;
and, in the midst of its mutability, discovers
one fixed point of rest. He who is habi∣tually
influenced by the hope of immorta∣lity,
will be able to look without lismay
on the changes of the world. He will
neither boast of to-morrow, nor be afraid
of it; but will pass through the varieties
of life with a manly and unbroken mind;
with a noble superiority to those fears and
expectations, those cares and sorrows,
which agitate the multitude.—Such are
the native effects of Christian faith and
hope. To them alone it belongs, to sur∣mount
all the discouragements to which
we are now exposed; to render our life
comfortable, and our death blessed; nay,
to make <HI>the day of our death better than the
day of our birth.</HI></P>

EVIL.</HEAD>

<BIBL>EXODUS XXiii. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIX.</NOTE> we are placed as compa∣nions
and assistants to one another.
Depending, for most of the comforts of
life, on mutual intercourse and aid, it was
necessary, that we should be formed to de∣sire
the company, and to take pleasure in
the good will of our fellows. But this
sociability of man, though essential to his
<PB N="401" REF="410"/>
present condition, has, like many other
good principles, been unhappily warped
from its original purpose; and, in the pre∣sent
state of the world, has proved the
cause of much evil. For, as vice has a∣bounded
in every age, it hath propaga∣ted
itself much more easily by the assist∣ance
of this social disposition. We natu∣rally
mould ourselves on the pattern of
prevailing manners; and corruption is
communicated from one to another. By
mutually giving, and taking, the example
of sinful liberties licentiousness spreads
and grows; each justifies himself by his
neighbour; and the multitude of sinners
strengthen one another's hands to commit
iniquity. In all ages of the world, custom
has had more power than reason.
Few take the trouble of inquiring what
is the right path; the greater part con∣tent
themselves with following that in
which the multitude have gone before
them. No exhortation, therefore, is more
necessary to be frequently given, and to
be seriously enforced, than that which we
<PB N="402" REF="411"/>
receive from the text; <HI>Thou shalt not fol∣low
a multitude to do evil.</HI></P>
<P>To acquire a full view of any danger
to which we are exposed, is the first mea∣sure
to be taken, in order to our safety.
Let us then begin the subject, with consi∣dering
how much we are in hazard of be∣ing
misled into vice by the general man∣ners
which we behold around us.—No
virtue is more necessary to a Christian,
but scarcely is there any more difficult
to be put in practice, than that firmness
of mind which can enable a man to main∣tain
his principles, and to stand his ground
against the torrent of custom fashion and
example. Example has upon all minds a
secret and insinuating influence, even
when we ourselves are insensible of its ope∣ration
We imperceptibly slide into some
resemblance of the manners of those with
whom we have frequent intercourse. This
often shows ifself, in the most indifferent
things. But the resemblance is still more
readily contracted, when there is some∣thing
<PB N="403" REF="412"/>
within ourselves, that leans to the
same side which is countenanced by the
practice of others. We are always glad
to find any apology for indulging our
inclinations and passions; and the exam∣ple
of the multitude too readily suggests
that apology. Even before corruption
has made great progress in our hearts,
sometimes, mere complaisance and good
nature incline us to fall in with the ways
of others. Sometimes, timidity and false
shame prevent our differing from them:
Frequently, expectation and interest impel
us strongly to comply, How great is the
danger we incur, when, in times of pre∣vailing
vice, all these principles of imita∣tion
and compliance unite together a∣gainst
our virtue?</P>
<P>The world is too justly said by scirp∣ture,
to <HI>lie in wickedness.</HI> It is a school
wherein every vice is taught, and too ea∣sily
learned. Even from our earliest child∣hood,
false sentiments are instilled into
our minds. We are bred up in admira∣tion
of the external show of life. We are
accustomed, as soon as we can understand
<PB N="404" REF="413"/>
any thing, to hear riches and honours
spoken of as the chief goods of men, and
proposed to us as the objects to which our
future pursuits are to be directed. We
see the measures of outward respect and
deference taken from these alone. Reli∣gion
and virtue are recommended to us,
in a formal manner, by our teachers and
instructors; but all improvements of the
mind and heart, are visibly placed by
the world, in an inferior rank to the ad∣vantages
of fortune Vices, that chance
to be fashionable, are treated as slight fail∣ings;
and coloured over, in common dis∣course,
with those soft and gentle names
which express no condemnation. We en∣ter,
perhaps, on the world, with good
principles, and an aversion to downright
vice. But when, as we advance in life,
we become initiated in that mystery of ini∣quity,
which is called, the way of the
world; when we meet with deceit and
artifice in all ranks of men; when we be∣hold
iniquity authorised by great name,
and often rewarded with success and ad∣vancement,
<PB N="405" REF="414"/>
our original good impressions
too soon decay. The practice of the multi∣tude
renders vice familiar to our thoughts;
and gradually wears off the abhorrence
with which we once beheld it. We begin
to think. that what is so very general, can∣not
be highly criminal. The malignity
of sin appears diminished, by so many be∣ing
sharers in the reproach; and instead
of mens vices detracting, as they ought
to do from our good opinion of the men,
our attachment to the men oftener recon∣ciles
us to the vices of which they are
guilty.</P>
<P>The countenance which sin receives
from the practice of the multitude, not
only removes the restraints which are im∣posed
by modesty and shame; but, such
is the degeneracy of the world, that shame
is too often employed against the cause of
religion and virtue. The ridicule of the
giddy and unthinking bears down he
conviction of the sober and modest.
Against their own belief, they appear to
adopt the notions of the infidel; and a∣gainst
<PB N="406" REF="415"/>
their own choice, they join in the
vices of the libertine; that they may not
be reproached as persons of a narrow
mind, and still enslaved to the prejudices
of education. How much reason is there
to believe theat, merely from this timidity
of temper, many, whose principles are on
the side of religion and virtue, are never∣theless
found <HI>walking in the way of sinners,
and sitting in the chair of the scornful?—</HI>
Interest too, often coincides with this
weakness of disposition, in tempting such
persons to follow the multitude. To fall
in with the prevailing taste, to suit them∣selves
to the passions of the great, or to
the humours of the low, with whom they
chance to be connected, appears the rea∣diest
way to rise in the world. Hence
they are naturally led to relinquish the
firmness of an upright character, for that
supple and versable turn, which accommo∣dates
itself to the times, and assumes what∣ever
appearance seems most convenient
for interest.—Such are the dangers to
which we are exposed, in times of corrup∣tion
<PB N="407" REF="416"/>
of <HI>following the multitude to do evil;</HI>
dangers which require our most serious
attention and care, in order to guard our∣selves
against them.—I proceed to lay such
considerations before you as may be useful
for that purpose.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> place, Let us remember that
the multitude are very bad guides; are so
far from having a title to implicit regard,
that he who blindly follows them, may be
presumed to err. For prejudice, and pas∣sion,
are known to sway the crowd. They
are struck by the outside of things; they
inquire superficially, admire false appear∣ances,
and pursue false goods. Their o∣pinions
are for the most part hastily form∣ed,
and of course are variable, floating,
and inconsistent. In every age, how small
is the number of those who are guided
by reason, and calm inquiry? How few
do we find, who have the wisdom to think
and judge for themselves, and have stea∣diness
to follow out their own judgement?
<PB N="408" REF="417"/>
Ignorance, and low education, darken the
views of the vulgar. Fashion and pre∣judice,
vanity and pleasure, corrupt the
sentiments of the great. The example of
neither, affords any standard of what is
right and wise. If the philosopher, when
employed in the pursuit of truth. finds it
necessary to disregard established preju∣dices
and popular opinion, shall we, in the
more importand inquiry after the rule of
life, submit to such blind guidance as the
practice of the many; esteeming whatever
they admire, and following wherever they
lead? Be assured, that he who sets up the
general opinion as the standard of truth,
or the general practice as the measure of
right, is likely, upon such a foundation,
to build no other superstructure except
vice and folly.—If the practice of the mul∣titude
be a good pattern for our imitation,
their opinions surely should be as good a
rule for our belief Upon this principle,
we must exchange Christianity for Paga∣nisin
or Mahometanism, and the light of
the Reformation for the superstitions of Po∣pery;
<PB N="409" REF="418"/>
for these latter have ever had, and
still have, the numbers and the multitude
on their sde.—Our Saviour has sufficient∣ly
characterised the way of the world,
when he describes the <HI>broad, oad</HI> in which
the multitudes go, as the <HI>road which leads
to destruction;</HI> and the path which leads to
happiness, as a <HI>narrow path,</HI> which fewer
find. From which it is an easy interence,
that to have the multitude on our side, is
so far from affording any presumption
of our being safe, that is should lead us
to suspect that we are holding the course
of danger.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, as the practice of
the multitude is no argument of a good
practice, so it cannot afford us either jus∣tification,
or safety, in what is evil.—It af∣fords
us, I say, no justi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication. Truth
and error, virtue and vice, are things of
immutable nature. The difference be∣tween
them is grounded on that basis of
eternal reason, which no opinions or cus∣toms
of men can asfect or alter. Whether
<PB N="410" REF="419"/>
virtue be esteemed, or not, in the world,
this makes it neither more nor less estima∣ble
in itself. it carries always a divine
authority. which men cannot impair. It
shines with an essential lustre, which
praise cannot brighten, nor reproach tar∣nish.
It has a right to regulate the opi∣nions
of men; but by their opinions can∣not
be controlled. Its nature continues
invariably the same, though all the mul∣titude
of fools should concur in endea∣vouring
to turn it into ridicule. <HI>Wo un∣to
them,</HI> says the prophet Isaiah, <HI>that
call evil, good, and good, evil; that put
darkness for light, and light for darkness;
that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bit∣ter
—Their root shall be as rottenness, and
their blossom shall go up as dust; because they
have cast away the law of the Lord of bosts,
and despised the word of the holy one of Is∣rael</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah v. 20, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the practice of the multitude fur∣nishes
<PB N="411" REF="420"/>
no justification to the sinner, so
neither does it afford him any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afety. Re∣ligion
is altogether a matter of personal
concern. God hath delivered to every
man the rule of life; and every man mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
think and act for himself; because for
himself he is to answer. If others be wic∣ked,
it will be the worse for them; but
it will not, on that account, be the better
for us if we shall be evil also. Let vice
be ever so prevalent, it is still that <HI>evil
thing which the Lord abhorreth;</HI> and,
<HI>though hand join in hand,</HI> the wicked shall
not escape unpunished. So far is the num∣ber
of offenders from surnishing any
ground of safety, that it calls more loudly
for divine justice to interpose. It is as
easy for the Almighty arm to crush a
whole guilty society, as to punish a single
individual; and when the difobedient
subjects of God countenance and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trength∣en
one another in licentiousness, by trans∣gresfing
in troops and bands, it becomes
high time for his government to exert
itself, and let its vengeance forth.—One
<PB N="412" REF="421"/>
could scarcely think that any professor of
Charistian faith would fancy to himself
any apology from the way6 of the world,
when he knows that the declared design
of his religion was, to distinguish him
from the world, which is said to <HI>lie in sin;</HI>
and that christ came to call out for him∣self
a <HI>peculiar people, whose</HI> character it
should be, <HI>not to be conformed to the world,
but transformed by the renewing of their
minds.</HI>—So little, indeed, can the practice
of the world either justify or extenuate
vice, that it deserves our serious considera∣tion,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, whether there bc
not several circumstances, which peculiar∣ly
aggravate the guilt of those who follow
the multitude in evil. Do you not, there∣by,
strengthen the power of sin, and per∣petuate
the pernicious influence of bad
example? by striking off from the cor∣rupted
crowd, you might be eminently
useful. You might animate and recover
many, whom weakness and timidity keep
<PB N="413" REF="422"/>
under bondage to the customs of the
world; whereas, by tamely yielding to the
current of vice you render that current
stronger for carrying others along; you
add weight and stability to the bad cause;
you lend to the multitude all the force of
your example, for drawing others after
them, to the commission of evil.—While
you are thus accessory to the ruin of o∣thers,
you are, at the same time, stamping
your own character with the foulest and
deepest impressions of corruption. By sur∣rendering
your judgement, and your con∣science,
to the multitude, you betray the
rights, and degrade the honour, of the ra∣tional
nature. Nothing great or worthy
can be expected of him, who instead of
considering what is right in itself, and
what part it is fittest for one in his station
to act, is only considering what the world
will think, or say of him; what sort of
behaviour will pass with the fairest show,
and be most calculated to please the ma∣ny.
When a man has thus given up the
<PB N="414" REF="423"/>
liberty and independence of his mind, we
can no longer reckon upon him in any
thing. We cannot tell how far he may be
carried in vice. There is too much ground
to dread, that he will lie, dissemble, and be∣tray;
changing himself, without scruple,
into every shape that will find favaour a∣mong
those whom he seeks to gain.—
While this servility to the world infers
baseness towards men, it involves also the
highest impiety towards God. It shows
that we yield to the world that reverence
and submission, which is only due to the
divine law. We treat the government of
the Almighty with scorn; as if his pre∣cepts
deserved to be obeyed, only when they
suited the caprice and the follies of the
multitude; and were entitiled to no regard,
as soon as they contradicted the reigning
customs and fashions of the world.—
While such conduct carries in it so much
wickedness and folly, let us observe,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that most excel∣lent
and honourable character which can a∣dorn
<PB N="415" REF="424"/>
a man and a christian, is acquired,
by resisting the torrent of vice, and adhe∣ring
to the cause of God and virtue a∣gainst
a corrupted multitude. It will be
found to hold in general, that all those,
who, in any of the great lines of life, have
distinguished themselves for thinking pro∣foundly,
and acting nobly, have despised
popular prejudices, and departed, in several
things, from the common ways of the
world. On no occasion is this more re∣quisite
for true honour, than where reli∣gion
and morality are concerned. In times
of prevailing licentiousness, to maintain
unblemished virtue, and uncorrupted in∣tegrity;
in a public or a private cause, to
stand firm by what is fair and just, amidst
discouragements and opposition; despising
groundless censure and reproach; disdain∣ing
all compliance with public manners,
when they are vicious and unlawful; and
never ashamed of the punctual discharge of
every duty towards God and man;—this
is what shows true greatness of spirit, and
will force approbation even from the dege∣nerate
<PB N="416" REF="425"/>
multitude themselves. “This is
the man,” their conscience will oblige
them to acknowledge, “whom we are un∣able
to bend to mean condescensions.
“We see it in vain either to flatter or to
threaten him; he rests on a principle
within, which we cannot shake. To this
man you may, on any occasion, safely
commit your cause. He is incapable
of betraying his trust, or deserting his
friend, or denying his faith.” Thus
<HI>his ighteousuess comes forth as the light,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s judgement as the noon-day.</HI></P>
<P>It is, accordingly, this steady inflexible
virtue, this regard to principle, superior to
all custom and opinion, which peculiarly
marked the characters of those, in any
age, who have shone as saints or heroes;
and has consecrated their memory to all
posterity. It was this that obtained to
ancient <HI>Enoch</HI> the most singular testimo∣ny
of honour from heaven. He conti∣nued
<HI>to walk with God,</HI> when the world
apostatised from him. He pleased God,
and was beloved of him; so that, living
<PB N="417" REF="426"/>
living among sinners, he was translated to
heaven without seeing death; <HI>Yea, sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edily
was be taken away, lest wickedness should
have altered his understanding, or deceit be∣gui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
his soul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom of Solomon iv. 11.</NOTE>. When Sodom could not
furnish ten righreous men to save it, <HI>Lot</HI>
remained unspotted amidst the contagion.
He lived like an angel among spirits of
darkness; and the destroying flame was not
permitted to go forth. till the good man
was called away by a heavenly messenger
from his devoted city. <HI>When all flesh had
corrupted their way upon the earth,</HI> then li∣ved
Noab, a righteous man, and a preach∣er
of righteousness. He stood alone, and
was scoffed by the profane crew. But
they by the deluge were swept away;
while on him, Providence conferred the
immortal honour, of being the restorer of
a better race, and the father of a new
world. Such examples as these, and such
honours conferred by God on them who
withstood the multitude of evil doors,
<PB N="418" REF="427"/>
should often be present to our minds.
Let us oppose them to the numbers of
low and corrupt examples, which we be∣hold
around us; and when we are in ha∣zard
of being swayed by such, let us for∣tify
our virtue, by thinking of those who,
in former times, shone like stars in the
midst of surrounding darkness, and are
now shining in the kingdom of heaven, <HI>as
the brightness of the firmament, for ever and
ever.</HI>—As our honour is thus deeply con∣cerned
in our acting a stedfast and virtu∣ous
part, let us also consider,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fifth</HI> place, How little in point
of interest, can be gained by the favour of
the multitude, and how much will cer∣tainly
be lost, by following them to do e∣vil.
We may, thereby, render ourselves
more agreeable to some with whom we
are connected; and by artful complian∣ces,
may please ourselves with the prospect
of promoting our forsune. But these ad∣vantages
such as they are, remain doubt∣ful
and uncertain. The wind of popular
opinion is ever shifting. It will often
<PB N="419" REF="428"/>
leave us at a loss what course to steer;
and, after all our trouble and anxiety to
catch the favourable gale, it may on a sud∣den
forfake us. For the versatility of cha∣racter,
the meanness and inconsistency of
conduct, into which a dependent on the
multitude is betrayed, frequently ren∣der
him, in the end, an object of con∣tempt
to those whom he sought to please.
But supposing him successful in his views,
no worldly advantages, which are pur∣chased
by dishonourable means, can be
either solid or lasting. They bring no ge∣nuine
satisfaction to a man, who is con∣scious
to himself of having given up his
principles to serve the world. As long as
he could he satisfied with his own conduct,
he might bear up under undeserved dis∣couragement;
but when he becomes despicable
in his own eyes, worldly honours
lose their lustre.—What can the multitude
do for you, after you have followed them
in evil? They cannot restore to you the
peace of an innocent mind, nor heal the
forrows of a wounded spirit, nor shield
you from the displeasure of God. They
<PB N="420" REF="429"/>
can do little to support you in the hour of
affliction, and nothing to deliver your
souls in the day of death. Forsaken and
disconsolate, the world, for the most part,
casts off its votaries in the end; and when
you compute the final amount, it will
prove a very small consolation, that, as you
have had sharers in guilt, you shall have
companions also in punishment.</P>
<P>Look forward to the issue of things.
The multitude of men possess now, in a
great measure, the distribution of praise
and censure, of success and disappoint∣ment,
according to their caprice. But this
confused and promiscuous distribution is
not always to subsist. The day cometh,
when we all are to appear before a more
discerning Judge, and a more impartial
tribunal. The day cometh, when our
Lord Jesus christ, shall deseend from hea∣ven
in all the glory of his Father, to un∣veil
every character, and to <HI>render to every
man according to his works.</HI> At that day,
how shall he lift up his head, who hath
been all his life the slave of the world's
<PB N="421" REF="430"/>
opinion; who hath moulded his principles,
and his practice, solely to please the mul∣titude;
who hath been <HI>ashamed of his Sa∣viour
and his words;</HI> and to gain favour
with men, hath apostatised from the na∣tive
sentiments and dictates of his heart?
—To say all in one word; there is a con∣test
now between God and the world.
These form the opposite sides which di∣vide
mankind. Consider well, to which of
these you will chuse to adhere. On the one
side, lie your allegiance, your honour, and
your interest; on the other, lie your
guilt and your shame. For the one, con∣science
and reason, for the other passion,
and inclination, plead. On the one hand,
are the approbation of God, immortal ho∣nour,
and divine rewards; on the other,
—remember and beware,—are the stings
of conscience, endless punishment, and
endless infamy.</P>

<P>IT is of the highest importance to reli∣gious
conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XX.</NOTE> that our minds be fill∣ed
with suitable conceptions of the attri∣butes
<PB N="423" REF="432"/>
butes of God. They are the foundations
of our reverence for him; and reverence is
the foundation of religion. All the di∣vine
perfections are interesting to man.
Almighty power, in conjuction with E∣ternity
and Omnipresence, naturally in∣spires
solemn awe. Infinite Goodness re∣lieves
the mind from the appression which
Power alone would produce; and, our
our experience of present benefits; and, from
remembrance of the past, creates love, gra∣titude,
and trust. In the middle between
these, stands the contemplation of divine
Wisdom, which conjoins impressions of
awe with those of comfort; and while it
humbles us into profound submission, en∣courages,
at the same time our reliance on
that <HI>King eternal, immortal, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible,</HI>
who is justly stiled in the text, <HI>the only wise
God.</HI></P>
<P>Among men, wisdom is a quality en∣tirely
different from cunning or craft.
It always supposes good and fair inten∣tion
in the person who possesses it; and
<PB N="424" REF="433"/>
imports, that laudable ends are pursued
by proper and justifiable means. In like
manner, wisdom in the Supreme Being
cannot be separated from the rectitude of
his nature. It is, in him, an exertion of
benevolence; and imports, that the pur∣poses
of justice and goodness are carried
on and accomplished, by means the most
effectual. To meditate, on some of those
instances in which this divine wisdom is
displayed, cannot but be highly favour∣able
to the impressions both of piety, and
of virtue.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to say whether the natu∣ral,
or the moral, world, afford the most
conspicuous and striking displays of the
wisdom of God. Not one, nor many dis∣courses,
nor indeed the study and labour of
a whole life, were, in any degree, sufficient
to explore them. Of the proofs of wis∣dom
which the natural world affords, I
cannot attempt now to discourse. Any
illustration of these would lead to discus∣sions
of a scientific kind, which more
<PB N="425" REF="434"/>
properly belong to the philosopher; and
on which philosophy has often employed
itself, with much utility and honour. I
shall only take notice that. in proportion
as human knowledge hath enlarged its
sphere of research and discovery, in the
same proportion, hath the wisdom of the
Creator struck the minds of all inquirers
and observers, with the highest admiration.
All nature is in truth scene of wonders.
In the disposition of the heavenly bodies,
and the general arrangement of the system
of the universe; in the structure of the
earth; in the endless variety of living
creatures that fill it; and in the provision
made for them all, to enable them to fulfil
the ends of their being, it is not easy to
determine, whther power, wisdom, or
goodness be most conspicuous. It belongs
not only to <HI>the heavens to declare the glory
of God, and to the firmament to shew forth
his handy-work;</HI> in the smallest and most
inconsiderable, as well as in the most il∣lustrious
works of God, equal marks ap∣pear
or profound design and consummate
<PB N="426" REF="435"/>
art. It has been justly said, that there is
not a vegetable that grows, nor an infect
that moves, but what is sufficient to con∣found
the atheist, and to afford the candid
observer endless materials of devout ado∣ration
and praise.</P>
<P>WHEN we turn to the moral world,
the field of admiration which opens to us
is no less extensive and striking. I can
only mention a few instances of that ex∣quisite
wisdom which everywhere meet
us.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, let us attend to the
constitution of human nature. Though we
are taught by revelation, to consider it as
now impaired by the fall, yet, as it stands,
we behold the traces of a noble structure,
planned and executed with the highest skill.
All the powers and faculties bestowed on
man are such, as perfectly suit his condition,
and adapt him to the purposes for which
he was designed—Senses were given him,
that he might distinguish what is necessa∣ry
for the preservation and welfare of his
<PB N="427" REF="436"/>
body. Now, suppose that any one of
those senses, the fight, for instance, or the
hearing, or the touch, had been in a con∣siderable
degree either more blunt, or
more acute, than it is at present, what an
unhappy change would this have made
upon our state? On the one hand, greater
imperfection of the organs, would have
deprived us of all the comfort and advan∣tage
which we now enjoy from such
powers. On the other hand, a greater de∣gree
of exquisite sensibility in them, would
have rendered life a burden to us. Our
senses, instead of being inlets to know∣ledge
and pleasure, would then have be∣come
constant avenues to uneasiness and
pain. their powers, therefore, are skil∣fully
adjusted to that measure of strength,
which allows them to answer the purposes
of health, safety, and comfort; without
either falling short of this line of useful∣ness,
or improperly, and hurtfully, stretch∣ing
beyond it.</P>
<P>In the mind, appetites and passions
were placed, as the moving powers of the
<PB N="428" REF="437"/>
soul, to impel its activity. But as their
impulse required regulation and restraint,
reason was, at the same time, conferred as
the directing power.—Of all our passions,
self-love, and the desire of self-preservation,
were, with the utmost propriety, made the
strongest, for a reason which the meanest
capacity may comprehend. Every man
is most immediately committed by Provi∣dence
to his own care and charge. He
knows his own situation best; and has
more opportunites of promoting his own
happiness, than he can have of advan∣cing
the happiness of any other person.
It was therefore fit and wise, that, by
the strongest instinct, he should be prompt∣ed
to attend to himself.—At the same
time, as no man standing alone is suf∣ficient
for his own welfare, it was ne∣cessary
that, by mutual sympathy and
social instincts, we should be drawn to
give aid to one another. Here it deserves
our particular notice, that he force of
those social instincts is, with admirable
propriety, proportioned by Providence to
<PB N="429" REF="438"/>
the degree of their usefulness and impor∣tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. II. Vol. iii.</NOTE>.
Thus, that parental affection,
which the helpless state of infancey and
childhood renders so needful, is made the
strongest of them all. Next, come those ties
of blood, which prompt mutual kindness a∣mong
those who are intimately joined to∣gether
by brotherhood, and other family
connections. To these succeeds that va∣luable
instinct of pity, which impels us to
assist the distressed, wherever we behold
them. To take part with others in their
good fortune belongs to man's social na∣ture,
and increases the sum of happiness.
At the same time, to take part with the
prosperous is less necessary than to sym∣pathise
with the unhappy; and therefore
the principle which prompts us to <HI>rejoice
with them that rejofce,</HI> is made not to be
so strong, as that which impels us to <HI>weep
with them that weep.</HI></P>
<P>But they are not only the laudable and
important parts of our disposition, which
<PB N="430" REF="439"/>
discover the wisdom of the Author of our
frame; even our imperfections and fol∣lies,
are by him rendered subservient to
useful ends.—Amidst those inequalities
of condition, for instance, which the state
of human life required, where it was ne∣cessary
that some should be rich, and o∣thers
poor, that some should be eminent
and distinguished, and others obscure and
mean, how seasonable is that good opinion
which every one entertains of himself;
that self-complacency with which he com∣pares
himself to others; and that fond
hope, which is ever pleasing him with the
prospect of future pleasures and advanta∣ges
in life? Without those flattering sen∣sations,
vain as they often are, how totally
insupportable would this world become, to
many of its inhabitants? Whereas, by
means of them, Providence hath contrived
to balance, in a great measure, the inequa∣lities
of condition among mankind. It hath
contrived to diffuse pleasure through all
ranks; and to bring the high and the low
nearer to alevel with each other, than might
<PB N="431" REF="440"/>
at first be supposed. It hath smoothed the
most rugged tracts of human life; and
hath gilded with rays of borrowed light
its most dreary scenes.</P>
<P>One instance of Divine wisdom, in
framing our nature, is so remarkable as
to demand particular attention; that is,
the measure according to which, God hath
dispensed knowledge and ignorance to
man. There is nothing of which we are
more ready to complain, than of our nar∣row
and confined views of nature, and of
Providence, and of all things around us:
And yet, upon examination, it will be
found, that our views extend, on every side,
just as far as they ought; and that, to
see and know more than is allowed us, in∣stead
of bringing any advantage, would
produce certain misery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. i. And Serm. IX. Vol.. iv.</NOTE>.—We pry, for
instance, with impatient curiosity, into
future events. Happily for us, they are
veiled and covered up; and one peep be∣hind
<PB N="432" REF="441"/>
that veil, were it permitted, would
be sufficient to poison the whole comfort
of our days by the anticipation of sorrows
to come.—In like manner, we often wish
with eagerness to penetrate into the secrets
of nature, to look into the invisible world,
and to be made acquainted with the whole
destiny of man. Our wish is denied;
we are environed on all hands with my∣stery;
and that mystery is our happiness.
For were those great invisible objects fully
disclosed. the fight of them would con∣found
and overwhelm us. It would ei∣ther
totally derange our feeble faculties;
or would engross our attention to such
a degree, as to lay us aside from the busi∣ness,
and concerns of this world it would
have the same effect, as if we were carried
away form the earth, and mingled among
the inhabitants of some other planet.—
The knowledge that is allowed to us, was
designed to fit us for acting our part in
our present state. At the exact point
therefore, where usefulness ends, know∣ledge
stops, and ignorance commences.
<PB N="433" REF="442"/>
Light shines upon us, as long as it serves
to guide our path; but forsakes us, as soon
as it becomes noxious to the eye; and
salutary darkness is appointed to close the
scene.—Thoughtless and stupid must that
man be, who, in all this furniture of the
human mind, in this exact adjustment of
its several powers to the great purposes of
life, discerns not the hand of adorable
Wisdom, as well as of infinite Coodness.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, Let us contemplate
the same wisdom, as exhibiting itself to
us in the moral government of the world.
We are informed by revelation, that this
life is designed by providence to be an in∣troductory
part of existence to intelligent
beings; a state of education and disci∣pline,
where creatures fallen from their
original rank, may gradually recover their
rectitude and virtue. Under this view,
which is in itself perfectly consonant to
all that reason discovers, we shall find the
general course of human affairs, confused
as it may sometimes appear, to have been
<PB N="434" REF="443"/>
been ordered with exquisite wisdom.—It
was necessary to such a state, that all the
active powers of man should be brought
forth into exercise, and completely tried.
It became proper, therefore, that there
should be a mixture of characters in the
world; and that men should be shewn in
a variety of situations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Serm. IV. Vol. iv.</NOTE> Hence that di∣versity
of tempers and di∣spositions which
are found in society; those inequalities in
rank and station, which we see taking
place; and those different talents and in∣clinations,
which prompt men to different
pursuits By these means, every depart∣ment
in society is filled up; and every man
has some sphere prepared for him, in
which he can act. He is brought forth
as on a busy stage. Where opportunity
is given for his character to display itself
fu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly.—His life is, with great propriety,
varied by interchanges of prosperity and
adversity. Always prosperous, he would
<PB N="435" REF="444"/>
become dissipated, indolent, and giddy:
Always a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eicted, he would be fretful, de∣jected,
sullen. There are few persons
therefore, or none, whose lot shares not of
both these states; in order that every dis∣position
of the heart may be explored,
and every mean of improvement afforded.
—As man is ultimately designed for a
higher state of existence than the present,
it was not proper that this world should
prove a paradise to him, or should afford
him that complete satisfaction which he
incessantly pursues. Disappointments,
therefore, are often made to blast his
hopes; and, even while the comforts of
life last, they are always mixed with some
troubles; in order that an excessive at∣tachment
to this world may gradually be
loosened. The course of things is evi∣dently
so ordered by Providence, that oc∣curences
shall be always happening, to
bring down the most profperous to a le∣vel
with the rest of his brethren, and to
raise up, in their turn, the low and the
distressed</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="445"/>
In the midst of those vicissitudes, which
are so obviously conducive to improve∣ment,
both wisdom and goodness required,
that the supreme Governor of the world
should be seen to protect the interests, and
favour the side of virtue. But in the de∣gree
of evidence, with which this was to
be shown, it was no less requisite, that a
proper temperament should be observed.
Had virtue been always completely re∣warded,
and made happy on earth, men
would no longer have had a motive for
aspiring to a more blessed state. In the
case of every crime, had divine justice
interposed to bring complete punishment
on the head of the criminal; or had a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the felicity which is prepared for the just
in a future world, and all the misery which
there awaits the wicked, been already dis∣played
to the view, and rendered sensible
to the feeling of men, there would have
been an end of that state of trial, for which
our whole condition on earth was intend∣ed.
It was necessary, therefore, that, at
present, we should <HI>see through a glass
<PB N="437" REF="446"/>
darkly.</HI> A certain degree of mystery and
obscurity was, with perfect wisdom, left
on the conduct of the Almighty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Se Serm. IV. Vol. i.</NOTE>.—But,
amidst that obscurity, sufficient encou∣ragement
and support is in the mean time
given to virtue; sufficient ground is afford∣ed
for the full belief, that it is what the
Deity loves, and will finally reward. His
approbation of it is signified to every man
by the voice of conscience. Inward satis∣faction
and peace are made always to be∣long
to it; and general esteem and ho∣nour,
for the most part, to attend it. On
the other hand, the wicked, in no situa∣tion
of life, are allowed to be truly happy.
Their vices and their passions are made to
trouble their prosperity; and their pu∣nishment
to grow out of their crimes.
Let any one attentively recollect the ma∣terial
incidents of his life; and he will,
for the most part, be able to trace the
chief misfortunes which have befallen
<PB N="438" REF="447"/>
him, to some guilt he has contracted, or
some folly he has committed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. XIII. iv.</NOTE>. Such
is the profound wisdom with which Pro∣vidence
conducts its counsels, that, al∣though
it does not appear to interpose,
men are made to reap from their actions,
the fruits which they had deserved; their
iniquities <HI>to correct them, and their back∣slidings
to reprove them;</HI> and while they
suffer, they are forced to acknowledge the
justice of their punishment.—These are
not matters of rare or occasional observa∣tion;
but deeply interwoven with the
texture of human affairs. They discover
a regular plan, a formed system, according
to which the whole train of Providence
proceeds; and which manifests to every
serious observer the consummate wisdom
of its Author.—As thus, in the constitu∣tion
of human nature, and in the moral
government of the world, divine wisdom
so remarkably appears, I must observe,</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="448"/>
IN the <HI>third</HI> place, That in the redemp∣tion
of the world, and in the oeconomy
of grace, it shines no less conspicuously.
The subject which opens to us here is too
extensive to be fully illustrated at present;
but the great lines of it are obvious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. V. Vol. i.—Serm. V. Vol. ii.—Serm. XV. Vol. iii.—Serm. V. Vol. iv.</NOTE>.—In
carrying on a plan, by which forgive∣ness
was to be dispensed to an offending
race, wisdom required that the authority
of the legislator should be fully preserved,
and no such relaxation be introduced in∣to
government, as might give licence or
encouragement to offenders. According∣ly,
the most admirable provision was
made for these important purposes, by the
interposition of the Son of God suffering
and dying for sinners. The sovereign
awe of justice is maintained, while jus∣tice
is tempered with mercy. Men are
bound to righteousness, under the highest
sanctions; and ample security and con∣solation
<PB N="440" REF="449"/>
solation are, at the same time, assorded to
the penitent. By the instructions, and
example, of their Saviour, they are in∣structed
in their duty; and through a
Mediator and Intercessor, they are en∣couraged
to osser their worship and pray∣ers
to the Almighty. They are assured
that, in whatever is too arduous for hu∣man
nature to perform, they shall be as∣sisted
by a Divine Spirit; and under all
trials and dissiculties, they are supported
by the express promise of the eternal life,
which is brought to light by the gospel.
—It is not possible for the understanding
to conceive any menthod of salvation, plan∣ned
with more goodness, and executed
with more wisdom, than what is shown
in the gospel of Christ. the cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dera∣tion
of this constitution alone, gives us
full reason to join in that exclamation of
the Apostle; <HI>O the depth of the riches both
of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
How unsearchable are his judgements, and
his ways past <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inding out!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rome. ii. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="450"/>
FROM this short survey which we have
taken of Divine wisdom, as discovering
itself, in the whole complex frame of the
moral world; in the constitution of hu∣man
nature; in the government of hu∣man
affairs; and in the redemption of
the human race; we cannot but perceive
how much reason we have to prostrate
ourselves before God, and with all humi∣lity
to worship and adore.—When we
view that immense structure of the uni∣verse
in which we dwell; when we think
of Him, whose wisdom has planned the
whole system of being; whose mind com∣prehends,
whose counsels direct, the whole
course of events, from the beginning to the
end of time; by whom nothing is so in∣considerable
as to be overlooked, or so
transient as to be forgotten; who attends
to the concerns of the poor man in his
cottage, while he is steering the sun and
the moon in their course through the
heavens; into what astonishment and
self-annihilation do we fall! Before him
all our boasted knowledge is ignorance,
<PB N="442" REF="451"/>
and our wisdom is folly. Wherever we
cast our eyes on his works and ways, we
find all things adjusted in <HI>number, weight,
and measure;</HI> and after all that we can
survey, Lo! these are but a part of his
ways; <HI>and how small a portion is heard of
him!</HI></P>
<P>It is the power of God, which produces
among the multitude of men any impres∣sion
of religion. When thunder roars
in the heavens, or an earthquake shakes
the ground, they are struck with awe, and
disposed to worship an invisible power.
But such impressions of Deity are occa∣sional,
and transitory. The lasting reve∣rence
of a Supreme Being arises, in a well
informed mid, from the display of that
infinite wisdom which all the universe
presents. Its operations are constantly,
though silently, going on around us.
We may view it in the peaceful and se∣date
state of the universe, as well as in its
greatest commotions; we behold it in e∣very
insect that moves on the ground, at
the same time that we admire it in the
<PB N="443" REF="452"/>
revolutions of the celestial bodies. Hap∣py
for us, if the contemplation shall nou∣rish
that temper of habitual devotion,
which so well becomes dependent beings,
and is so intimately connected with all
virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. xix. vol. iii.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>But the chief effect that ought to be
produced by meditation on the divine
wisdom, is perfect resignation to the Go∣vernor
of the universe, and entire trust
in his administration. Our private mis∣fortunes
and disappointments are too often
the subject of querulous complaints. and
even of unjust suspicions of Providence.
But when in the whole natural and mo∣ral
world, we behold an arrangement of
things which plainly discovers the most
consummate wisdom, can we believe, that
in the arrangement of our petty concerns,
this wisdom is dormant and neglectful?
How much more reason is there to think,
that our ignorance of the divine plans
misleads our judgement, than that the
<PB N="444" REF="453"/>
wisdom of the Almighty has erred in di∣recting
our private affairs?—Divine
wisdom, as I observed in the beginning,
is an exertion of divine benevolence. It
has, it can have, not other scope than to
accomplish the best ends, by the most
proper means. Let the Wisdom, there∣fore
and the Goodness, of the deity, be
ever conjoined in our idea. Let every
new discovery of divine wisdom, be a
new ground of hope, of joy, and of cor∣dial
submission, to every virtuous man.
Let him be thankful that he lives in a
world, where nothing happens to him by
chance, or at random; but where a great
a wise, and beneficent Mind continually
superintends every event.</P>
<P>Under the faith of this great principle
of religion, let us proceed in the course
of our duty, with stedfast and undismay∣ed
mind. Let us retain faithful allegi∣ance
to our Creator and our Redeemer;
and then we may always hope the best;
and <HI>cast our care upon him who careth for
us. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage,
<PB N="445" REF="454"/>
and He shall strengthen your heart. Al∣though
thou sayest, thou canst not see him, yet
judgement is before him; therefore trust thou
in him.</HI>—Let us begin every undertak∣ing,
with humble dependence on his as∣sistance
for enabling us to prosecute it to
the end. When our undertakings are fi∣nished,
and the close of life approaches,
with praise to him let us conclude all our
labours.</P>
<P><HI>Unto the king Eternal, immortal, invisi∣ble,
the only Wise God, be honour and glory
for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
