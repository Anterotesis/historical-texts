<HEAD>A Trumpet blown in the NORTH, By a Ministring Friend <HI>of the People called QUAKERS.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>OBADIAH</HI> a Friend to Truth and Peace, to thee <HI>John Eriskine,</HI> called <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> a Master of Sedition, and a Leader of the Wicked among the People,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Leteth to Wot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT, howbeit, thou art of the Number of those who are ex∣alted to high Degree in the Earth, and that Honour is given to thee of Men; yet forasmuch as thou art greatly degenerated from that, which
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
even by vulgar Men is esteem'd honoura∣ble, and hast offended against him that is greater than thee; it behoveth that I re∣buke thee in the Ears of the People, al∣beit I am but a mean Man; for Truth lo∣seth nothing of its Efficacy and Force by the Meanness of the Person, or the Plain∣ness of the Language, by which it is held forth.</P>
<P>For I signify to thee, Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> that this Person who now writeth unto thee, hath been accustomed to speak even to the Princes and great Men of the Earth, Words of Reproof, as oft as they do Evil, and that without respect of the Favour, or Fear of the Wrath of Man; forasmuch as I have learned not to fear the Face of Man, or to bow before him.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> but it is an Evil Re∣port that I hear of thee, <HI>to wit</HI> that thou hast levyed War against thy Lord the King, and gathering the Elders of thy People together, hast lifted up thy Hand against thy Rulers, taking the Sword of Offence into thy unrighteous Hand, where∣with thou art bold to do Evil, to smite with the Fist of Wickedness, and to bring innocent Blood upon thy Land, and up∣on thine own Head.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
I would that thou shouldest see the Evil of thy Doings, before it be too late, and before Vengeance overtake thee, lest thou suffer as an Evil doer; for ve∣rily thou canst not prosper in this Thing, and he that doth righteously, will call thee to an account therefore.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I counsel thee, to look back upon thy Ways, and lay hold on the Clemency and Mercy of the King be∣fore it be too late; neither will I threat∣en thee with the Vengeance of Men, un∣less thou persist obstinately in thy Offen∣ces; for verily our Lord the King is willing to shew Mercy, and hath pro∣claimed Mercy to Rebels, and even to those who have lifted up their Hands a∣gainst him, if they shall shew their Re∣pentance, by such Tokens of Submission, as Justice and Truth shall require.</P>
<P>Verily, Friend <HI>John,</HI> I would that thou shouldest repent, and that thou shouldest return to thy due State of Obedience to the Rulers of thy People; for surely this Thing is not of the Lord, neither shalt thou prosper therein. Well I wot, that thou flatterest thy self with vain Thoughts,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
and sayest to the People that it is not Re∣bellion when thou liftest up thy Hand a∣gainst the King; forasmuch as thou pre∣tendest to have a Person on thy Side, who, as thou sayest, is of the house of the Kings, howbeit he is really a Stranger, and an Out-cast, rejected of God, and of the People of the Land, and of whom the General Voice of the Nation hath said, <HI>We will not have this Man to reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is it sufficient for thee to say, that he is the Offspring of the Royal Tribe, to whom the Lord hath said, that the Scepter should not depart therefrom; see∣ing our Lord the King is likewise the Son of the Kings, and moreover, chosen of God from among his Brethren; like as <HI>David</HI> the Son of <HI>Jesse</HI> was the Anointed of the Lord, notwithstanding his seven Brethren, the Sons of his Father, were elder than he. Flatter not then thy self, O weak Man, that the Right of this Stranger can be of more Weight than his whom the Lord hath chosen; seeing the God of Kings has often given us to understand, that the Right, which is called vulgarly Hereditary, is not understood in Heaven as thou wouldest perswade Men to under∣stand it, but that every Branch of the Roy∣al Tribe has an Equality of Claim, when
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
God, either by himself, or by the Voice of the People of the Land, shall single out from the rest, the Persons who he hath before determined to Reign, as has been e∣vident, even in the Throne of <HI>Israel,</HI> which was so immediately directed from God; wherein, not <HI>David</HI> only was cho∣sen before his elder Brethren, as aforesaid, but <HI>Solomon,</HI> who was the younger Son of many, was appointed his Successor, and Reign'd by Hereditary Right after him.</P>
<P>I forbear to speak with thee, concerning the supposed Fraud of the Person who calls her self the Mother of thy pretended Master, which hath prevailed with many to believe he was not the Son of her Womb; and this I do, because it matter∣eth not unto us whether he were so, or whether he were otherwise; seeing the Lord hath rejected his Father's house, and cast him out before the People; where∣fore the Land spued him out, and hath said, <HI>Let him be cast out for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless, thou hast gainsaid the Word of the Lord, and hast made Pro∣clamation, <HI>saying,</HI> That this Stranger shall be King in the Land, and that the Uncir∣cumcis'd shall Reign. Verily, <HI>John,</HI> thou
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
meritest to be punished by the Judge, and when the King cometh to execute Judg∣ment with the Sword, thou shalt not be able to stand before him, and not only thy Blood, but the Blood of the People that are with thee shall be upon thy head. Truly, thou hast deluded the People to their hurt in this Matter, and hast drawn them into a Snare, to Rebel▪ against God and the King, <HI>saying,</HI> That thou hadst ma∣ny Adherents in the Land, and that di∣vers other Persons, <HI>Vain Men among the People</HI> would stand up with thee, and then thou shouldest prevail over the King: But herein thou hast deceived thy self, and those that are with thee; forasmuch as many of thy Friends are already fallen in∣to the Hands of the King, others are dis∣persed, scattered, and made afraid, fly∣ing from the Hands of Justice, and wan∣dring in a strange Land for Safety.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Friend <HI>John,</HI> I shall not Expostulate with thee upon the Sin of thy Ways, and the Wickedness of thy Rebel∣lion; for <HI>I wot</HI> that thou wilt not be brought to acknowledge thy Offence. But I shall speak to thee, after the manner of Men, desiring thee to weigh and consider thy Ways, and, like the wise Man that
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
maketh War, consider whether thou, with thy ten Thousands art able to deal with him who Commandeth against thee with twenty Thousands; and whether while thou art fighting with Impossibilities and impracticable Things, thou art not cast∣ing thy self away, and leading all those that are with thee into Destruction.</P>
<P>For thinkest thou, <HI>vain Man,</HI> that thou, with the Rabbles of thy Mountaineers whom thou hast gathered together in the Naughtiness of thy Heart, and hast flat∣tered with the hopes of Spoil, shall be a∣ble to withstand the Powers which are ga∣thered against thee from all the Corners of the Land? Or dost thou perswade thy self, that thou art able to contend with the King, whose Armies are now gather∣ing round thee to devour thee?</P>
<P>Let me examine for thee, <HI>Friend John,</HI> the Strength whereon thou dost lean, and the Confidence wherewith thou art puffed up I for I give thee to understand, that I am well acquainted with thy Design, and I well understand the broken Staff <HI>of Lor∣rain,</HI> on which thou leanest thy Hand, and how thou art deceived thereby, and
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
deceivest those of the People who are gone forth with thee.</P>
<P>I think, <HI>Friend John,</HI> thy vain Ex∣pectations may be reduced to three Kinds, to wit, those which thou hast from thy Confederates abroad, those which thou hast flattered thy self with form some who are Traytors to the King in this Part of the Land, which is called <HI>England;</HI> and lastly, the Strength of thy own Interest among the People of the Hills, and of the Mountains whom thou hast deceived, and with whom thou hast deceived thy self; <HI>saying,</HI> That these shall deliver thee, and that these shall bring thee forth to Battle against the People of our Lord the King.</P>
<P>But I must deal plainly with thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> for thou art deceived herein, nei∣ther art thou able to stand in the Battle, or to shew thy self in the high Places of the Field; for that every part of this thy Confidence will fail, and thou shalt be forsaken of all thy Helpers, and shall be delivered up into the Hands of thy Ene∣mies, and there shall be none to save thee.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
And that I may shew thee this thing in time, it shall be told thee how it standeth with thy Helpers, and with those who have stricken Hands with thee in this Thing, whose Condition▪ perhaps thou knowest not; or if thou dost, I am in∣formed thou concealest the same from the People who are with thee; who therefore thou art justly said to have deceived, and to have drawn in, to their Hurt, they not knowing what they do.</P>
<P>True it is, that when thou first concei∣ved this Evil in thy Heart, thou wast en∣couraged to expect Help from the Mighty, and the Kings of the <HI>Gentiles (Roman Ca∣tholicks)</HI> had laid a Confederacy with thee, and with the Stranger, for whom thou fightest, and in whose Name thou hast done this Wickedness: But thou art not ignorant, how that one of these said Kings who was the most Mighty among the Heathen, and yet who gave himself a great Name, <HI>to wit,</HI> of MOST CHRISTIAN, has been snatch'd from his Throne by one more Mightier than he, and is slept with his Fathers, and they have buried him in the Sepulchre of his Fathers, and he is no more: Moreover, thou knowest that the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
King that is risen up after him is but a Child, and knowest not Good from E∣vil, and that the Governors of the said King are not Friends to thy Enterprize, or to the Master whom thou servest; but that the Fear of our Lord the King is upon them, and they are as Men that have no Life before him; wherefore they think Evil towards thee, neither will they send Help to thee, as in Times past: Like∣wise the other King of the Neighbouring Country, who is also call'd THE CA∣THOLICK, and who has laid a Confe∣deracy, as abovesaid, Behold, is he not a∣far off? Neither hath he any Ships, or any Strength wherewith to assist thee; but his Hands are cut off, and also he is unable to give any Assistance unto thee, albeit he may have promised thee fair.</P>
<P>The rest of thy Confidence is placed, as I am informed, in Assistances of Money, and these, <HI>Friend John,</HI> thou knowest are but poor, and few, and not at all propor∣tion'd, or able to support such a vast and unbounded Design as thou art engag'd in; neither are the Persons from whom they are said to come able long to supply thee. <HI>First,</HI> It hath been said, that thou hast received certain pieces of Silver from the Charita∣ble
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Collections made among the Societies of Idolatrous Priests. It seemeth to me, that these wicked Men's depending upon, is, that thy Master purposes to restore their Idolatry in these Kingdoms, and that he will execute their Bloody and Per∣secuting Principles on the Inhabitants thereof, planting the Religious Tyranny of their Priests in this Land) a Yoke which neither we, or our Fathers were a∣ble to bear) have opened their Purses to him, and contributed certain Sums of Con∣secrated Silver for that use.</P>
<P>Likewise, <HI>Secondly,</HI> It hath been told us, that the ARCH-PRIEST, whom thou knowest, <HI>Friend John</HI> to be the Son of Perdition, and who the People of the Lord believe to be that <HI>Scarlet Whore,</HI> who bewitcheth the Nations with her Whore∣doms, and whom the Lord shall destroy in the latter Day; I say, it hath been told us, that this ARCH-PRIEST hath distri∣buted of that Money which they call the Treasures of the Church unto thy Master, and has dedicated the same to the carrying on this Sedition, whereof thou callest thy self the Head; and that this is done, if it is at all so, with a Design to set on foot
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
the Wickedness and Superstition of Pope∣ry, thou can'st not be ignorant.</P>
<P>With what Confidence then can'st thou, <HI>Friend John,</HI> who professest thy self to be a Protestant, appear to take up the Sword of Rebellion and Sedition, and to Arm the People against the Lord? Inasmuch as thou knowest thou art fighting for Po∣pery, and endeavouring to bring back that Abomination of Desolation which our Fathers thrust out? With what Face can'st thou put thy Hand to set again those <HI>Plants which our Heavenly Father</HI> not only <HI>hath not planted,</HI> but which we know <HI>he had rooted up?</HI></P>
<P>And wherefore concealest thou these things from the Ears of the People which are with thee, <HI>saying,</HI> Ye are for the Pro∣testant Religion? Is it not known, and doth not thy own Conscience reproach thee herewith, that thou hast taken up the Sword for a <HI>Popish Pretender,</HI> and that thou hast proclaimed it in the Ears of the People, <HI>saying,</HI> That he is their King? And is it not known, that thou art supported with Money, and Promises of Assistance from the said Popish Pretender, and from the ARCH-PRIEST of ROME, with
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
whom is Idolatry, and divers kinds of Superstition; who is drunk with the Blood of the Lord's People, and yet thir∣steth for more Blood, even the Blood of all the Good People of this Land?</P>
<P>But, alas, <HI>Friend John,</HI> What are all these able to do for thee? I would that thou shouldest know that they are not a∣ble to support thee, or to send thee such Supplies of Money as thy new Enterprize will call for; but will leave thee in the Lurch, and expose thee to the Fury, and to the Justice of thy own People. For∣asmuch, <HI>Lord Marr,</HI> as thou knowest that it is not in them, neither have they Rich∣es or Power sufficient for thee, and thou wilt find, if thou wantest a second Relief, that they are Poor, and not able; as like∣wise Covetous and Narrow, and will not be willing to send thee farther Sums, lea∣ving thee to fall by the Power of thy E∣nemies, and exposing both thee and thy Master to Misery and Distress. For to tell thee the Truth, such is the Luxury and Vanity of this ARCH-PRIEST, and of his Dependents, that they cannot raise a∣ny Sums of Money out of their Ecclesia∣stick Revenues, equal to that Underta∣king.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Having thus examin'd the Capacity of thy foreign Friends, and how unlikely it is, that thou shouldest be carried thro' this despe∣rate Undertaking, by the feeble Assistance of such People, Let me remind thee of one thing, which perhaps thou thinkest not of, <HI>viz.</HI> Supposing it were otherwise, and that these Heads of Idolatry were a∣ble to carry thee on in thy wicked Designs, <HI>What is the End which thou art aiming at?</HI> Is is not the Work of Satan that thou art carrying on? Is it not the Subversion of Religion it self that is in thy Design? Are not all thy Men Fighting against God? Kicking against the Pricks, and Embarked in the worst Design that e∣ver Protestants were in Arms for be∣fore?</P>
<P>Publish it not in <HI>Gath,</HI> let not the Un∣circumcised Philistines <HI>(Papists)</HI> hear the Sound of it. Search into the History of thy Fathers, and look over the long Re∣gisters of the Time past, and tell us, <HI>Friend John,</HI> if ever Protestants took up the Sword of Popery before, especially against the Interest of Protestants? We have read, that the Protestants in <HI>Hungary</HI> have even made use of the Sword of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
against the Tyrants, and Idol Worship∣pers of <HI>Rome,</HI> but was it indeed to set up the Superstition of <HI>Mahomet?</HI> NAY, but was it not rather to preserve the Professi∣on and Practice of their own Principles in Religion against Popery? And shall British Protestants Erect Popery by the Sword of Ruine? What Inconsistency art thou practising, <HI>Lord Mar?</HI> And where will it end, but in thy Destruction?</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> I ad∣vise thee to call to mind, that thine is a Case, in which it is hard for thee, <HI>even thee thy self,</HI> on the maturest Considerati∣on, to please thy self in the Success of thy Undertaking, if it should come to pass, a∣ny more than in thy Miscarriage; for that if thou miscarry, thou art undone, and if thou succeed, thy Country, thy Fami∣ly, thy Posterity, and thy Religion are all undone; thy People made misera∣ble, thy Fathers, and thy Children gi∣ven up to the Enemy, and made a De∣solation for ever; <HI>so that,</HI> if thou art in thy Senses, thou can'st not wish even Success to thy own Designs, without mix∣ing the Horror of thy Countrey's Ruine with the Thoughts of thy pretended Pros∣perity.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
And is it not an Act of great Tenderness to thee then, in Friendlywise to admonish thee, that thou precipitate not thy self into this great Ruine and Desolation in thy present Attempt, and that thou make not thy self an Instrument, as far as lyeth in thy Power, to pull down the true Re∣ligion in thy Native Country, and to set up Popish Idolatry? And more especial∣ly am I thy Friend, in giving thee this Counsel; forasmuch as I see it is impossi∣ble for thee to prosper in thy Designs, and that thy Friends in whom thou trust∣est are too feeble to support thee.</P>
<P>But it hath also been said of thee, <HI>Friend John,</HI> that thou flatterest thy self with the Assistance of evil Men, like thy self, even among the People of this our Land; and that thou hast hardened thy Countenance against the Truth, that thou mayest de∣ceive the Men that are with thee; <HI>saying,</HI> That certain great Men in this part of our Land, which is called <HI>England,</HI> are like∣wise Assembled, and have drawn the Sword against the King. Now, albeit, <HI>Friend John,</HI> there are Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> a∣mong the People, who are disposed to do Evil, and who had Confederated toge∣ther
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
against the Lord, and against the King, <HI>saying,</HI> That they would draw the Sword of Violence, and move the People to Sedition: YET, <HI>be it known to thee,</HI> that God hath discovered the Workers of Iniquity to the King, and many of the Leaders among them are taken into Cap∣tivity, and the Residue are scattered in the Land; neither is there any Friend who can shew his Face against the King, for∣asmuch as they are asham'd, and even con∣founded, because of the Wrath of the King, and the Power of his Throne; so that all thy Expectations of Deliverance from the Seditious in this Land are vanish∣ed into Smoke, and thou can'st have no more Confidence in their Words, who gave thee Promises of Assistance; for the Lord hath scatter'd them in the Land, nei∣ther is there any found who stand up to∣gether for thy Assistance.</P>
<P>Send forth now thy Messengers, and let them see, and write to thy confederated Friends, and let them answer thee; where are now thy Helpers, who said unto thee, Verily, we will Smite the King, and those that are with him? Are not their migh∣ty Men put into Hold, and their Leaders, are they not scattered, insomuch that
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
two of them are not left together? Be∣hold, <HI>Friend John,</HI> the Princes of the People in whom thou trustest, are taken Prisoners, and the mighty Men of Valour are fied, neither is there any more Cou∣rage in them.</P>
<P>How is it that thou art not Advertised, That <HI>the Tower,</HI> being the Prison-house of the King, hath receiv'd Lord <HI>Powis,</HI> Lord <HI>Lansdown,</HI> Lord <HI>Scarsdale,</HI> Lord <HI>Dupplin, William Wyndham,</HI> and divers of thy Friends; and that others are in Bonds in sundry Places, who perhaps thou hast expected should ere now have led forth the Seditious to make War upon the King? Hast thou not heard how <HI>Edward Harvey,</HI> one of thy Master's wealthy Friends, ha∣ving been taken in his own Craftiness, has thro' Anger and Wrath fallen upon his own Knife, and sore wounded himself, even almost to the Death? That <HI>William Wyndham</HI> hath yielded to the King, <HI>say∣ing, O King, be merciful unto me!</HI> and that divers others are fallen into the King's Hands, not having the Power to deliver themselves.</P>
<P>Hast thou not heard, <HI>Friend John,</HI> that a Confederacy for a rising of the Peo∣ple
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
which had been appointed at <HI>Bri∣stol,</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and at other Cities of the Land, has been disclosed to the King? And that the Servants of the King have placed Garrisons of Soldiers in the said Cities; and that certain Bands of Men have fetch'd away thy said Confederates, even from the midst of the City of Priests, the Multitude of whom, tho' they swelled with Rage against the King, durst not lift up their Hands against him, but deli∣vered up their Friends who trusted in them, to be punished?</P>
<P>Hast thou not heard, O rash and vain Man, that divers of thy meaner Friends in the Land, have been scourged and im∣prisoned, and made a Gazing Stock to the People for speaking unadvisedly with their Lips, and for reproaching the King? Likewise, that others have been led out to Execution, and have been put to Death for moving Sedition, and for pulling down the Synagogues of the Worshippers of God, and that there hath been none to deliver these Men out of the King's Hands?</P>
<P>And wherefore then, flatterest thou thy self, or thy Followers? Or in whom dost thou now trust, saying, <HI>I shall be deliver∣ed?</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Seest thou not, that thy Friends are all made afraid, and that there is no more Heart in them? Seest thou not likewise, that the whole Nation is preserved in Peace; and that against the King, or a∣gainst his House, not a Dog waggeth his Tongue? I counsel thee then, to consider with thy self, to lay down the Sword of Strife and Sedition, and to submit thy self to the King, saying, <HI>Be merciful to me, O King!</HI> And howbeit thou hast not de∣served it, yet doubtless thou shalt find Mercy; for our Rulers are also merciful.</P>
<P>But I hear that thou hast likewise Con∣fidence in thy own Arm, and in the Strength of thy Hills and Mountains, where thou hast gathered much People together, saying, that <HI>thou wilt smite with the Sword, and that the King's Men shall not be able to subdue thee.</HI> But thinkest thou, that thy Men shall be able to look the Armies of our Lord the King in the Face, who shall exceed thee in the Mul∣titude of his Horsemen, and shall surround thee with strong Bands of armed Foot∣men, mighty Men of Valour who draw the Sword, who are expert in War, and whose Fingers are taught to fight; while thy Men are weak and few, and are not
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
enured to Battle? Wherefore then, boa∣stest thou thy self? And what art thou able to do? If thou thinkest thy Hills and Mountains shall defend thee, and the Rocks shall defeat the Horsemen of the King, to what Purpose then, art thou gathered together, seeing thou wilt be be∣sieged therein, and thy Mountains shall become a Desert to thee, and to those who are with thee? For, be it so, that thou shouldest be able to defend the Fast∣nesses of the Rocks, and to hide thy self in the Hollows of the Mountains, yet there remains a Question for thee to give Answer to, before the Season of Winter which approaches, come upon thee; <HI>viz.</HI> Can thy Men feed upon the Rocks and Mountains? Can they eat the Hills which they defend? And how wilt thou do to subsist the Numbers which thou hast ga∣thered together, who must of Necessity separate and fly to their several and for∣mer Abodes, in which Case it will be hard for thee to bring together again, af∣ter their Disappointment, or they must perish for Hunger in the Mountains, and those Hills which seem to be their De∣fence, will thereby become their Destru∣ction.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Wherefore then, art thou deceiving thy self, and those that are gathered together about thee? If thou art a Man of War, why comest not thou forth to the Bat∣tle, and why dost thou not show thy self? Verily, thou art deceived to thy Hurt; for thou art not able to stand: Thy Hopes are in vain, and thou wilt fall in this thy Wickedness, neither will any one pity thee, but thou wilt die as an evil Person, and as a Worker of Wick∣edness.</P>
<P>But Friend <HI>John,</HI> let me yet reason with thee of this Matter, even of the Hopes which thou hast entertained of Success in thy Folly. Were it reasona∣ble to suppose that thou shouldest fight with the Servants of the King who are now assembled against thee, and that thou shouldest prevail (for their Number is not yet great) what would such little Victory avail thee, but to puff up thy Heart with Pride, and cause thee to fall into greater Offences, that thou may'st be ripened for farther Vengeance? for verily the small Number of the Soldiers who are yet sent against thee, and which perhaps encourages thee in thy Ways,
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
ought rather to weaken thy hands, by shewing what Contempt of thy Power the Servants of the King have in their Hearts, knowing that thou must likewise encoun∣ter greater and more powerful Bands, even in every Step of thy Progress; for that thou canst not expect that the Measure of Power is to be taken from those that are now assembled against thee, in which it is to be said, that thou hast gathered thy whole Power together already; but the Armies of our King, who are now busied in ruining and crushing the Seeds of Re∣bellion which thy Pretending Master has sowed in this Nation, will encrease about thee, and shall be as the Stars of Heaven for Multitude, joyning Hands to destroy thee, whose Strength it is impossible thou shouldst resist.</P>
<P>But why shall I suppose thee to be vi∣ctorious, even over the few that are ga∣thered together to oppose thee, seeing thou hast now carry'd on thy Revolt for many Days, and hast gathered much Peo∣ple, and yet hast not been able to shew thyself against them: Surely if thou wer't powerful in thy present Appearance, as thy Friends would have us to believe, thou wouldst have exerted thy self now;
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
before the Armies of the King were ga∣thered together against thee.</P>
<P>Nor art thou prudent in this thy De∣lay; for that thou seest the Servants of our King are employ'd in dispersing and crushing thy Friends in the Infancy of their Designs and Plots, and are effectu∣ally reducing them to an Incapacity of ap∣pearing for thee; whereas hadst thou been in a Condition to have prevented it, thou wouldest certainly have endeavoured to rescue them from Destruction, or to have turned the hands of the King's Armies from them; wherefore the Weakness of thy hands is no less apparent, than the Wickedness of thy Designs.</P>
<P>What art thou doing, <HI>O Son of Vanity!</HI> and wherefore liftest thou up thy hand against thy Master the King? yea where∣fore drawest thou the Sword of Rebellion against the King, &amp;;eeing thou canst no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prosper?</P>
<P>I counsel thee likewise, <HI>Friend John,</HI> to consider the Circumstances wherein thou standest, with respect to the Justice and to the Lawfulness of what thou art now a doing, and whether when thou
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
art thus acting, thou art not fighting a∣gainst God; for know thou, and be assu∣red, that when he thundreth from Hea∣ven against his Enemies, thou shalt come into Remembrance before him, and if thou art doing wickedly, thou shalt not prosper.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> I counsel thee to remember that thou hast lifted up thy hand to the Most High, and hast sworn by him, that liveth for ever and ever, that thou wouldst not do this Thing; but that from thy heart thou wouldst renounce and forsake the very Person in whose Name thou hast now drawn forth thy Sword.</P>
<P>What then, art thou, O Man? What callest thou thy self? hast thou any Sense of Truth, or believest thou that there is a God of Truth, who avenges himself up∣on the Violence and Injustice of wicked Men? It is true, that <HI>Friends</HI> approve not of the manner of Men in that Thing which is called an <HI>Oath,</HI> believing it a prophane and evil Thing, and that we are <HI>to swear not all,</HI> as the <HI>Outward Letter</HI> saith; howbeit, as I am not now to que∣stion with thee concerning that Matter, it is yet just that I commune with thee after

thy own Way; <HI>viz.</HI> That forasmuch as thou art of the Number of those who ac∣knowledge the Custom of affirming or renouncing by an Oath, and that the same is the most solemn Appeal to the All-see∣ing and dreadful God, whose Judgments are thereby solemnly imprecated, and rea∣sonably to be expected, in case of a Breach of the said Swearing; I say, for thee to act contrary to those Oaths, is the most o∣pen Insult, which it is possible for thee to offer to the Omnipotence and Justice of Heavenly Majesty; the bright Beam of whose Spirit shines ineffable in thy Soul, giving thee Light to discern the Good from the Evil, and thereby taking from thee all Pleas of Ignorance, or other Ex∣cuses whatsoever.</P>
<P>Neither deride thou, like wicked Men, the Light of Divine Knowledge in thy Soul; but remember, if there is no Light within thee, verily there can be none without thee, and thou art given up to eternal Darkness and Blindness; but let thy own Tongue confess thy Guilt in this thing, whereof I now Advertise thee, <HI>to wit,</HI> that having first recognized the Law∣fulness and Solemnity of taking an Oath, this is doubtless to thee a full Answer, and
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
proves that thou art bound thereby in the most solemnest manner, both before God, and before Man.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Friend Mar,</HI> I meekly Ad∣vertise and Exhort thee to look back into the Oath of Abjuration which thou hast taken, revising the Terms of it; thou wilt there see, that in the most awful man∣ner, thou hast called thy Creator to wit∣ness, that thou <HI>hadst Willingly, Freely, and Truly</HI> Renounced and Abjured the Per∣son whom thou now callest thy King; hast declared, <HI>That thou dost believe in thy Conscience, that he has not any Right or Title whatsoever to the Crown of this Realm;</HI> hath Sworn by thy Creator, <HI>That thou wilt, to the utmost of thy Power, defend</HI> our Lord the King, who now sitteth on the Throne, <HI>against all Trayterous Conspiracies whatsoever which shall be made against his Person, Crown, or Dignity,</HI> &amp;c. And which is still more, thou hast there sworn (as thou callest it,) <HI>To Support, Maintain, and Defend the Succession of the Crown against</HI> the very same Person, by Name, JAMES; being the very same, whom thou hast now, in a wicked and rebellious manner, recei∣ved for thy King, and in Defence of whose
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
Pretensions to the Crown thou art now in Rebellion.</P>
<P><HI>Friend Mar,</HI> If thou can'st read over these Expressions, and wouldst consider, how thou hast lifted up thy Hand to the Lord in this manner, thou must needs be filled with Horror. With what Thoughts can'st thou look into thy inner Man? How must Blushes cover thy Face? How must thou start, and be affrighted at thy own Picture? Verily, Man, thou art gone beyond the ordinary Pitch of e∣vil Men; nay, some have said, that even Satan himself, (how great soever the Guilt of his evil Nature is) is out-sinn'd in this. Such a Crime hath not been named in <HI>Is∣rael; What? To fight for the Man whom thou hast Abjur'd?</HI> Surely, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> thou art hardned more than ever Man was before.</P>
<P>And do'st thou expect Success? Pri∣thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> who dost thou expect it from? From Man, I have told thee, thou canst not expect it, and I cannot per∣swade my self to believe thou hast the Face to look up towards Heaven for it. Can'st thou ask God to give thee Suc∣cess in breaking an Oath, to bless Perjury,
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
and stand by thee that hast invoked him solemnly to a Falsity? I Counsel thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> to read again the last Words of thy Oath, which are these, <HI>So help me God:</HI> And I would desire thee to tell me what meaneth that little Word, SO. Be∣lieve me, <HI>Friend John,</HI> that Particle soundeth very soft and short, but it hath a keen and dreadful Signification: SO <HI>help me,</HI> that is SO, may God help thee, and no otherwise, as thou keepest the Oath that thou hadst taken. Indeed, <HI>Friend John,</HI> this is the Interpretation that all the Doctors and Teachers, among those who approve of taking an Oath do put upon this Word. And I must tell thee, if this be the meaning, then hast thou already engaged the Lord of Heaven not to help thee; forasmuch as thou hast not kept thy Oath.</P>
<P>I would that thou shouldst maturely weigh within thy self the dreadful Con∣dition, into which thou hast brought thy self, and those that are with thee; for thou art not only fighting against our Lord the King, but thou art fighting a∣gainst the God of the whole Earth, and hast already lifted up thy Hand in Defi∣ance of the Lord, desiring him not to
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
bless thee, or help thee in the Cause in which thou art engaged.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Friend Mar,</HI> albeit thou may'st be Resolute enough, or Desperate enough, rather to engage in this War, both against God and the King, yet I would that all thy Helpers were made acquainted here∣with, and that thou wouldst lay these things fairly before their Eyes; <HI>saying,</HI> I have Renounced the Help of God; there∣fore, O Friends, do ye help me, and do ye joyn with me to fight without the Assistance of the God of Battle, against him whom I have sworn to Defend, and for him whom I have sworn to Oppose; Yea, O Friends, help me to fight against the Lord, and against the King.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> If thou should tell this part of thy Doings in the Ears of thy People, they would fly from thee, as from one who was forsaken of God▪ whose Destruction slumbreth not; and, albeit, the People that are with thee, have but little Sense of the Truth, or of the Fear of the Lord upon their Hearts; yet are there very few so hardned, as to be willing to fight against God, and joyn with one who hath cast off Truth, Con∣science,
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Honour, and the God of Hea∣ven. Flatter not thy self, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> with Success, while thou art at War with the Almighty, and hast renounced the Help of him who is alone the strong help∣er, whom none can resist.</P>
<P>But not to Preach to thee who art har∣den'd against the Spirit of Perswasion, I shall use the liberty, <HI>Friend Mar,</HI> to re∣late to thee a short History of a Case some∣thing like thine, tho' not so bad in its Circumstances, and for the Truth of the Story I shall refer thee to the just Docu∣ments of Antiquity for the Proof of, and as for the Application I shall leave it to thy self.</P>
<P>About the Year 1472, there was a so∣lemn Treaty of Peace made, after long and bloody Wars between <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> the King, Ruling in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Amurath</HI> the Ru∣ler of the <HI>Turks,</HI> or Worshippers of the Idol <HI>Mahomet;</HI> which Peace was at its Conclusion solemnly Ratify'd by the said King, the Writing being drawn up with the Hand and Seal of the King affixed thereunto, and the said King took a so∣lemn Oath to observe the same.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
It happened that at the Perswasion of the Pope, and divers of the Princes of the Earth Ruling at that time, that <HI>Ʋladis∣laus</HI> the King was prevailed with to make War again upon the said <HI>Amurath,</HI> with∣out any just Cause given, and in Con∣tempt of his said solemn Oath, wherein he had called upon the Lord (as thou hast now done) to help him SO, as he kept that Oath, and Sworn by his Name, that he would keep the same.</P>
<P>In the Process of this War, a great and bloody Battle was fought by great Num∣bers of mighty Men, gathered together on both sides, in the Plains of <HI>Varna.</HI> It hap∣pened that by the Valour of the Servants of the said King, the King of the <HI>Turks</HI> was sorely distressed, and the Battle pres∣sed hard upon him, insomuch as that he was nigh to being Vanquished; when seeing the Figure of Jesus Christ upon the Cross, which some of the Servants of King <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> had profanely display'd in their Banner, he drew out of his Bo∣som the Writing of the Peace, aforesaid, with the Hand and Seal of <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> the King affixed thereto, and the Oath of the King written thereon, and stretching
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
forth his Hand with the said Writing to∣wards the said profane Image, and casting his Eyes up to Heaven, he Pray'd, say∣ing, <HI>Behold, O thou CRƲCIFIED GOD, the Faith of these Christians, if they are thy Servants, and thou art a God, do thou a∣venge their abominable Perjury.</HI> Whereup∣on immediately, it is said, the Hearts of the Servants of King <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> began to faint, and their Hands became feeble, insomuch that the <HI>Turks,</HI> who was ready to fly, be∣came Conquerors. <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> the Perjur'd King was slain with the Sword, and there fell that Day on his side thirty thousand mighty Men of Valour, for the Army was utterly overthrown, and very few escaped.</P>
<P>I Counsel thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> to apply this History to thy self; for be it known to thee, that if the Servants of our Lord the King should lift up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven in the Day of Battle, and presenting thy Oath of Abjuration, should call upon God to Avenge himself on thy Perjury, and not to help thee who hast so notoriously renounced his Assistance. I doubt not but thy Heart shall sink with∣in thee, and thou shalt faint in the Battle; for who is the Man, and who art thou, <HI>O vain Creature,</HI> that thy Heart should
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
endure, when thou shalt see the Hand∣writing against thee, and that God whom thou hast call'd upon, <HI>not to help thee,</HI> set∣ting the King's Battle in Array against thee.</P>
<P>And know, <HI>O Man,</HI> that if it be not thus, but if the Lord does help thee, who hast thus abjur'd his Help, he must do a strange thing in the Earth, and act out of the ordinary Course of his heavenly Go∣vernment in thy behalf; which I suppose thou wilt see small reason to expect.</P>
<P>Where then dost thou look for Assi∣stance, and to whom wilt thou turn thy self for Help? Man has forsaken thee, and God thou hast forsaken; wilt thou fly to the Witchcraft of Satan, and stretch forth thy Hands to the evil Men of the Earth? Shall Thieves and Robbers be thy Refuge, and wilt thou turn Destroyer of thy Country? What will it avail thee to do thus? <HI>Had</HI> Zimri <HI>Peace that slew his Master?</HI> Will not these things end in the Destruction of thy self, and of thy Family; and wilt thou not become the Execration and Hissing of all that are the Servants of the Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
But why speak I to thee of the Judg∣ments of God? Or why move I thee to look to the Hand of Heaven? Thou who hast drawn the Sword of Blood, and rai∣sed War in the Bowels of the Land; Art not thou hardned above Advice, and past the Reproof of Reason and Sober∣ness? I shall therefore leave Expostu∣lating with thee in that manner, and tell thee in Plainness and Sincerity, what the Pride of thy Heart, and the ambitious Desires of thy Heart aim at, and how far thou deceivest the People.</P>
<P>Thou thinkest to bring in the Idol of thy Thoughts, whom thou Worshippest, and whom thou hast placed among the Kings; <HI>saying,</HI> That he <HI>shall Reign over us;</HI> and thou hast smitten with the Sword, divers who have opposed thee. Howbe∣it, this King, as thou callest him, is a Stranger, and the People know him not, neither will they obey him.</P>
<P>Likewise, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> I Advertise thee, that thy Folly and Arrogance appeareth most evident, in that thou flatterest thy self with Expectations of Success, upon thy breaking forth of thy lurking Holes
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
and Mountains, into the Lands of the <HI>South,</HI> than which nothing is more prepo∣sterous in thy Folly; forasmuch as the Minds of the People in those Parts are daily estranged from thee, and the Power of our Lord the King groweth exceeding Great: So that were it come to pass, ac∣cording as thy Heart desireth, that thou shouldest be descended to the Valleys, and to the Plains, thou wouldest be forthwith Overthrown and Discomfited, and all that are with thee will be put to the Edge of the Sword. Wherefore, O Man, pur∣sue not thy own Destruction, which hangeth already over thy Head; for assu∣redly, if thou enterest into Battle with the Servants of the King, thou wilt be destroyed, and the Memory of thee and thy pretended King will be wiped out from off the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>Finally, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> I signify unto thee, that having said these things to thee in time, that thou mayst repent, and re∣turn to thy Obedience to the King; if thou continue obstinate, I shall speak to thee again more particularly, as it shall be revealed to me of what shall befal thee, and the People that are with thee. FARE∣WEL.</P>
