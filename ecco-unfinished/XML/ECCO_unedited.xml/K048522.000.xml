<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my <HI>Essay</HI> on <HI>Regimen,</HI> I promised
the World my Thoughts concern∣ing,
<HI>The natural Method of cureing
the Diseases of the Body, and the Disorders
of the Mind resulting from such Diseases,</HI>
on the Principles of <HI>Philosophy</HI> laid
down in that <HI>Essay,</HI> which, by a Course
of fifty Years Study, I have discover'd
to be the most <HI>Rational,</HI> and in forty
Years <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Physic,</HI> have found
them to be the most <HI>Effectual.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Promise</HI> I have in the <HI>follow∣ing
Sheets</HI> endeavour'd to perform,
whether to the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI>
of the <HI>Public, Time</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
must shew. To a <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Senti∣ments</HI>
and <HI>Correctness</HI> of <HI>Style,</HI> I have
small Pretensions; to convey my own
<HI>Thoughts</HI> to others, with as much <HI>Plain∣ness</HI>
and <HI>Perspicuity</HI> as my Subject
would admit of, has been my <HI>principal
View;</HI> and if the serious attentive
<HI>Reader</HI> finds himself instructed, the
Intention of the Writer is answered,
and his Credit, as a <HI>Pen-man,</HI> is of small
Import.</P>
<P><HI>NATURE</HI> and her <HI>Laws,</HI> a com∣petent
Knowledge of the <HI>animal Oeco∣nomy,</HI>
and the best <HI>Observations</HI> which
I have been capable of makeing on
my own <HI>Success</HI> in Practice, or on
that of the ablest of my <HI>Profession,</HI> are
the Foundation of every thing by me
advanced. <HI>Theory</HI> I have given into
as far only as seemed necessary to
reconcile the <HI>Method</HI> and <HI>Medicins</HI> by
<PB REF="4"/>
me recommended, to the truest <HI>Idea</HI>
which I could frame of the Distemper
to be cured: For the rest, the <HI>Reader</HI>
is referred to the <HI>Essay</HI> above-menti∣oned,
and its <HI>Appendages.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Design extensive as this, it
will not be expected that I should
descend either into <HI>Forms</HI> of <HI>Medicins,</HI>
or the particular Circumstances of
every <HI>Distemper</HI> under Consideration;
this will be the necessary Duty of the
<HI>Physician</HI> in ordinary, who, if he ap∣proves
the general Directions by me
given, will readily adapt them to any
particular Case, its <HI>Degrees</HI> and <HI>Sym∣ptoms.</HI></P>
<P>IT cannot, I should hope, give any
reasonable <HI>Offence,</HI> if in a Work of this
Kind, many particular Things should
occur, which probably I may have
<PB REF="5"/>
already advanced in some former <HI>Trea∣tises;</HI>
my <HI>Apology</HI> for which is, that
in all I know of <HI>Physic,</HI> I have but one
general <HI>System; Nature</HI> being ever <HI>one</HI>
and the same, and proceeding in all
<HI>animal Functions</HI> and Operations by
the <HI>same,</HI> or at least by analogous
<HI>Laws.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT I learned from <HI>Books, Spe∣culation</HI>
and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> by Trial and
Experience I have found to be greatly
<HI>defective,</HI> as well in many Distempers,
whereof I myself have felt the Weight,
as in the Cases of my <HI>Patients;</HI> and
this <HI>Experience</HI> has led me to throw
off all <HI>unsuccessful</HI> Methods and <HI>Me∣dicins,</HI>
and to confine myself to <HI>such</HI>
only, by which I had Reason to think
the principal <HI>Point</HI> in View, <HI>viz.</HI> a
<HI>lasting Cure,</HI> might be obtained. This
Method of proceeding reduces the
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Physic</HI> into a narrow Com∣pass,
<HI>viz.</HI> 1°. To proper <HI>Evacuations</HI>
of the several proper Kinds. 2°. To
<HI>attenuating</HI> and <HI>deobstruent</HI> Medicins,
of which I find the <HI>mild ponderose</HI> to
be generally the best; and after a due
Use of these, 3°. The gentle <HI>Astrin∣gents</HI>
and <HI>Strengtheners</HI> of the Solids,
4°. A proper and <HI>specific Diet,</HI> with
<HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is my general <HI>System:</HI> This,
if just and solid, brings all that can
be pertinently said on the <HI>Cure</HI> of Dis∣tempers,
into an easy and intelligible
View, and makes many of the <HI>same</HI>
Methods and Medicins common to
different <HI>Cases</HI> and <HI>Patients.</HI> Whatever
exceeds this, is <HI>calculated</HI> either for the
easy Death, or to keep up the Courage
and Hopes, of the <HI>Patient.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
IT would not become me to say,
that the Method here laid down, how
judiciously soever applied, will in every
<HI>Case</HI> absolutely cure or save: This, how∣ever,
I venture to affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> that the
Continuance of this Method for a due
Time, has done, in very bad Cases,
and, by <HI>GOD's Blessing,</HI> will do more
than any other which has yet been
so strongly and clearly enforced and
explained, or is commonly used.</P>
<P>I MAY be deceiv'd myself, but, if
I know my own Heart, have not
a single <HI>Temptation</HI> to deceive others.
My <HI>Age</HI> is little short of seventy Years,
at which Time in Life, a <HI>Thought</HI> of
adding to my <HI>Reputation,</HI> or to my
<HI>Purse,</HI> would be extreme Folly: The
<HI>first</HI> is now at the Disposal of the
<PB REF="8"/>
<HI>Public,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> will soon be in the
Hands of my <HI>Executors.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Rules have I followed for
twenty Years, first and last; and, by
the <HI>Mercy of Heaven,</HI> am at this Time
happy, in the Enjoyment of my
Senses, and the <HI>Faculties</HI> of <HI>my Mind,</HI>
in their full <HI>Vigour.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all, though I should <HI>con∣vince</HI>
the World, I must not expect to
<HI>convert</HI> it: Lessons of <HI>Abstinence</HI> and
<HI>Self-denial</HI> loose their <HI>Weight,</HI> when
offered to strong <HI>Passions,</HI> and <HI>high
Spirits;</HI> and the greatest Part of my
<HI>Disciples</HI> will probably always be such,
as have labour'd through the tedious
<HI>Courses</HI> of <HI>Physic</HI> without Success, whose
Sufferings have soured the <HI>false Plea∣sures</HI>
resulting from <HI>sensual Appetites,</HI>
and who are at length willing to
<PB REF="9"/>
renounce <HI>Luxury,</HI> in order to lessen
<HI>Misery.</HI> To these I <HI>seriously</HI> affirm, that
this <HI>Method,</HI> strictly and for Time suf∣ficient
pursued, will afford all the <HI>Ease</HI>
which human <HI>Art</HI> can give, or human
<HI>Nature</HI> receive; and as the <HI>Time</HI> is
hourly stealing on, when <HI>Art</HI> can do
no more, an Observance of these <HI>Rules</HI>
will be the calmest and easiest way of
<HI>lying down in Death.</HI></P>
<P>LET this single Consideration then
recommend the <HI>System</HI> proposed, <HI>viz.</HI>
That it has a necessary Tendency to
<HI>alleviat</HI> the <HI>Pains</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and to soften
the <HI>Terrors</HI> of <HI>Death.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">REFLEXIONS on the Oeconomy of
Nature in Animal Life.</HEAD>
<P>1. WE know nothing of the Substance,
that is, the <HI>Basis,</HI> of either mate∣rial
or spiritual <HI>Qualities;</HI> we
know only their <HI>Being,</HI> and reason of their Na∣ture
from their <HI>Qualities,</HI> and their sensible Ef∣fects.
It is certain that the <HI>self-motive</HI> and <HI>self∣active</HI>
Principle, or <HI>spiritual Substance,</HI> that ac∣tuates
or animates <HI>organised</HI> Matter, must have
essentially and actually inherent in it, all those
natural <HI>Qualities, Faculties</HI> and <HI>Endowments,</HI>
in the highest <HI>Perfection,</HI> that it ever exerts or
<PB N="2" REF="19"/>
attains to in any time of its Duration. To aug∣ment
or increase in <HI>essential</HI> Qualities, is an Ab∣surdity;
and to augment or increase <HI>naturally,</HI>
is only the Property of <HI>Body</HI> and Matter: But
spiritual Substance being indivisible and immor∣tal,
if it could admit of <HI>More</HI> or <HI>Less</HI> in natu∣ral
or essential Qualities, it might cease <HI>to be,</HI>
I mean as to its <HI>natural</HI> Qualities of <HI>Living,
Perceiving</HI> and <HI>Willing,</HI> i. e. of <HI>Cogitation</HI> or
<HI>Thinking:</HI> for as to its <HI>moral</HI> Qualities of <HI>Ju∣stice,
Goodness</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> they may increase
or decrease to any Degree, since they intirely
depend on the <HI>Free-will:</HI> and therefore the na∣tural
Faculties of <HI>Living, Perceiving</HI> and <HI>Wil∣ling,</HI>
and their several Degrees and Modifica∣tions
of <HI>Activity, Sagacity</HI> and <HI>Desire,</HI> are <HI>es∣sentially</HI>
and uniformly permanent in it, in
their <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Degree</HI> respectively, whatever
kind of Body it animates; and when it does not
exert these <HI>innate</HI> and <HI>essential</HI> Qualities, it is be∣cause
it is limited and restrained by the Nature of
gross Matter, and the <HI>Laws</HI> of the Body which it
animates, which is a <HI>foreign Impediment</HI> insu∣perable
to its Degree of <HI>Self-activity</HI> and <HI>Self-mobility.</HI>
For an <HI>Angel</HI> is as truly an <HI>Angel,</HI>
as to its spiritual Nature and Faculties, <HI>inform∣ing</HI>
the Body of a <HI>Serpent,</HI> or any other orga∣nis'd
Body, as informing the Body of a <HI>Man:</HI>
And an <HI>Angel</HI> animating a human Body, wou'd
be only a more perfect <HI>Man;</HI> and by its natural
and essential Qualities cou'd then only more
perfectly exert <HI>human</HI> Functions and Operations:
<PB N="3" REF="20"/>
And on an <HI>unorganical</HI> Body it cou'd produce
no <HI>vital</HI> Functions, it cou'd only put it into
particular Motions.</P>
<P>2. THE Body of an Animal is as perfect and
complete in its <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and <HI>spermatic,</HI> as
in its <HI>adult</HI> State, from the first <HI>original Pair,</HI>
down to this present Time. In its <HI>lumbagi∣nous</HI>
State, with respect to its Body, it is, as it
were, a mere <HI>Plant;</HI> in its <HI>spermatic</HI> State, it is
but a Brute <HI>Animal;</HI> and it is only and pro∣perly
a <HI>Man</HI> in its <HI>adult</HI> State, when its spiritual
Faculties can act on its material Organs with
the least <HI>Resistance,</HI> and when its material Organs
are complete, develop'd, and cloathed with
proper Incrustation and Teguments, in which
it continues but a stated Time. The <HI>Skeleton,
Hulk</HI> and <HI>Rudiments</HI> of its Solids and Fluids,
with all its <HI>vital</HI> and <HI>animal Organs,</HI> are simi∣lar
and <HI>analogous</HI> in all these several Stages of
Being: It has the <HI>Miniature, infinitesimal</HI> Solids,
Fluids, and animal <HI>Organs</HI> and Functions, as
real and perfect in its <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and <HI>spermatic</HI>
State, as in its <HI>adult</HI> State, allowing for Cir∣cumstances;
for then its Solids are only <HI>infi∣nitely</HI>
smaller, more slender and delicate, <HI>roll'd</HI>
up and folded together; and its Fluids <HI>infinitely</HI>
more rare, thin and subtile; its Functions <HI>infi∣nitely</HI>
weaker and slower; and their Extension,
Progress, and Increase, is <HI>infinitely</HI> small in the
Beginning, and for Ages may be insensible,
like a slow <HI>diverging infinite Series,</HI> beginning
<PB N="4" REF="21"/>
from <HI>infinitely Little;</HI> but <HI>diverging</HI> it must
be, and always growing, living, and <HI>verging</HI>
to its State, in a certain <HI>Progression,</HI> and by
<HI>stated Laws.</HI> For the Soul, or <HI>spiritual Sub∣stance,</HI>
can only animate or actuate <HI>divinely
organis'd</HI> Matter; and if in any Instant of Time
the <HI>infinitesimal</HI> Functions should stop, the <HI>Cor∣puscle</HI>
wou'd soon putrify, or become an <HI>inorga∣nical</HI>
Particle of dead Matter, so as, without the
Power and Activity of the <HI>first Mover</HI> and
<HI>Creator,</HI> it could not be again made capable
of <HI>Animation;</HI> which may be one Reason of the
infinite <HI>Waste</HI> of organis'd Seeds, or Beginnings
of Life, conspicuous in the World, from the
<HI>unprecise</HI> Nature of gross Matter, and the <HI>in∣finite</HI>
possible Chances against the <HI>Precision</HI>
necessary to living in this present State of
Things.</P>
<P>3. THE <HI>first Man,</HI> or the original and me∣diate
Cause of the human Race, must either
<HI>virtually</HI> or <HI>actually,</HI> either <HI>explicitly</HI> or <HI>impli∣citly,</HI>
have had inherent in him, all those na∣tural
Qualifications, Properties or Virtues both
of Body and Soul, that ever were found in any
of his Posterity: Or before the Lapse (to sup∣pose
it only here for Illustration) <HI>Adam,</HI> or the
first of the <HI>human Species,</HI> before the Division
of the <HI>Sexes,</HI> (for it is plain from the Nature
of Things, that the placing two <HI>equal</HI> hu∣man
Souls, in only differently <HI>figur'd</HI> Bodies,
must have been <HI>posterior</HI> to the first original
<PB N="5" REF="22"/>
Design of their Creation, if <HI>final Causes</HI> have
any Evidence; for this Division of <HI>Sexes</HI> sup∣poses
a Want or Deficiency, and a <HI>begun Lapse,</HI>
and could be no other than a <HI>Prop</HI> or <HI>Buttress</HI>
to support a ruinous Fabric; for it is highly
probable, and conformable to the best <HI>Natural
Philosophy,</HI> that the Principle of Generation
is only in the Male) I say, <HI>Adam</HI> must have
had inherent in his original Frame, at least the
Meekness of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Patience of <HI>Job,</HI> the
Beauty of <HI>Absalom,</HI> the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon,</HI>
the <HI>Spirituality</HI> and <HI>Resignation</HI> of penitent
<HI>David,</HI> and all the <HI>Perfections</HI> and <HI>Excellen∣cies</HI>
of the <HI>Philosophers, Lawgivers,</HI> and <HI>He∣roes</HI>
of Antiquity, without their Blemishes; in
a word, the <HI>first Man</HI> must have had existent
in him, either <HI>actually</HI> or <HI>virtually,</HI> all the <HI>na∣tural</HI>
and <HI>moral</HI> Accomplishments and Endow∣ments,
that ever were existent or conspicuous
in any of his Posterity; with due Regard to
their intended different Uses and Ends in God's
universal Monarchy; for the <HI>Effect</HI> can never
rise higher than the <HI>Cause,</HI> or the <HI>Fruit</HI> than the
<HI>Seed,</HI> or the <HI>River</HI> than its <HI>Source.</HI> I think this
must be very plain to a true <HI>Philosopher,</HI> and is
at the same time a <HI>Demonstration</HI> of the <HI>Lapse</HI>
and <HI>Degeneracy</HI> of the present human Race.</P>
<P>4. FOR what wise Purpose the <HI>Creator</HI> of
both Body and Soul has confin'd the actuating
<HI>immaterial Substance,</HI> for so long a time, to
so <HI>dark</HI> and strait a <HI>Prison</HI> as is this <HI>seminal
<PB N="6" REF="23"/>
Corpuscle, viz.</HI> all the time of its Duration
from the Creation of the immaterial Spirit, and
Formation of the organis'd Body, till it arrive at
its utmost Extension and Maturity, is not readily
conjecturable. We feel that in <HI>Sleep,</HI> the Spirit
acts but imperfectly and partially in <HI>Proportion</HI>
to its <HI>wakeing</HI> Action; in <HI>Debauches,</HI> very <HI>in∣consistently</HI>
and <HI>unsteadily;</HI> and in <HI>Syncope's</HI>
and such-like <HI>nervous Paroxysms,</HI> scarce at all,
and yet the <HI>Essence</HI> and real <HI>Energy</HI> or Capa∣city
of the spiritual Substance is equally and
uniformly the same, only the <HI>organical</HI> Ma∣chine
is disorder'd, and will not play. We
can only therefore conclude, that possibly the
<HI>spiritual Substance</HI> may be so long imprison'd
in its <HI>Miniature, organical Corpuscle,</HI> for some
moral End in the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI>
either of <HI>Purification</HI> or <HI>Punishment;</HI> perhaps
to <HI>limit</HI> and <HI>concentre</HI> the <HI>natural Powers</HI> to
a <HI>Level</HI> with the laps'd and impair'd <HI>moral</HI> ones,
that they may both rise and grow up together
equally. I mention all this but as Philosophical
Conjecture only.</P>
<P>5. ALL that the most perfect <HI>Analysis</HI> Art
can reach, is able to discover in the intimate
Composition of Bodies, is, that they are com∣pos'd,
1. Of Sulphur, Oil or Spirit, or the <HI>Mat∣ter</HI>
of Fire. 2. Of <HI>Salt,</HI> or hard Particles, dissol∣vible
by Water only. 3. <HI>Air,</HI> or a thin elastic
dry Fluid. 4. <HI>Water,</HI> or a more dense, unela∣stic
moistening Fluid. 5. <HI>Earth,</HI> a gross unal∣terable
<PB N="7" REF="24"/>
permanent Substance, the <HI>Basis</HI> and Ce∣ment
of the other Four. From the Mixture
and Combination of these in different Quan∣tities
and Proportions, all the Varieties of Bo∣dies
and their Appearances may proceed.</P>
<P>6. THE great Principles of <HI>Action</HI> in Bodies,
small and great, <HI>may be,</HI> either, 1. <HI>Attraction</HI>
or <HI>Repulsion,</HI> and its several Laws. 2. <HI>Elasti∣city</HI>
or <HI>Reaction.</HI> 3. <HI>Fermentation.</HI> 4. <HI>Heat,
Fire,</HI> or its Matter and Cause. From what
primary Causes these proceed, I do not here
inquire; but that these are probably the <HI>secon∣dary</HI>
Causes of Action in all Bodies, there is
no room for doubting.</P>
<P>7. IT is then highly probable, that an ani∣mal
Body <HI>divinely organis'd,</HI> and fitted with <HI>In∣struments</HI>
to be actuated and animated by a <HI>spi∣ritual
Substance,</HI> the <HI>Moment</HI> after this spiri∣tual
Substance is breathed into it, or is united
to this Body, becomes a <HI>living</HI> Animal, and
not before; and then receives Nourishment,
and performs the <HI>Functions</HI> of <HI>Circulation,
Perspiration,</HI> and the <HI>Secretions analogically,</HI>
and by its proper Laws, in its <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and
<HI>spermatic</HI> Condition, as really as it does after∣wards
in its <HI>adult</HI> State; and as it can have no
Nourishment in the two first of <HI>these</HI> States,
but from a Tincture or <HI>Zest</HI> of the Juices of
the Parents, good, bad or indifferent, as they
may be, and must fare accordingly; so it will
<PB N="8" REF="25"/>
be <HI>nourish'd, perspire, respire,</HI> and <HI>secrete</HI> in
its adult State, according to the Nature and
Qualities of what it takes in from the <HI>Juices</HI>
and <HI>Fluids</HI> about it, and next to it, whatever
they be, and however convey'd into its Habit
and Substance.</P>
<P>8. IN order to be nourish'd for some time,
and perform the <HI>animal Functions,</HI> that is,
to <HI>live,</HI> there seems to be no other <HI>Condition</HI>
absolutely necessary, but that the <HI>Size</HI> of the
nourishing Particles be no greater than what
will easily enter and pass from the <HI>receiving</HI>
Orifices to the <HI>excretory</HI> Orifices; or that the
nourishing Particles be no bigger than the
Mouths of the <HI>vasa inhalantia &amp; exhalantia;</HI>
for were they bigger, it wou'd necessarily creat
Obstructions, Pain, and at last <HI>Death,</HI> or the
Destruction of the <HI>Machin;</HI> it may be <HI>less,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any given Proportion; but it must not be
<HI>greater;</HI> else it can neither readily enter, nor
prompt the animal Functions without Violence
and Pain.</P>
<P>9. TO prevent Inconveniencies that may
often happen from the <HI>finite</HI> and divisible Na∣ture
of gross Matter, from <HI>infinite</HI> Accidents,
from the <HI>Unsuitableness</HI> of the nearest Fluid,
to perform the necessary Functions of living in
<HI>Animalcules</HI> for any time, we see what an <HI>In∣finitude</HI>
of <HI>organis'd</HI> Particles of Matter, fitted
for living in proper Circumstances, the <HI>Author</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="26"/>
of Nature has provided in the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> of which scarce <HI>One</HI> in
many <HI>Millions</HI> can have all the favourable Cir∣cumstances
to bring it to <HI>Maturity.</HI> In <HI>Plants</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> these <HI>organis'd</HI> Particles are
thereby fitted to become proper Nourishment
for <HI>Animals,</HI> that there may be no real <HI>Waste</HI>
or Loss in Nature, but all may tend to some
infinitely <HI>wise End</HI> or <HI>Purpose.</HI> For <HI>God and
Nature do nothing in vain;</HI> and when from
the imperfect and limited Nature of <HI>gross</HI>
and <HI>porous</HI> Matter, and <HI>Deficiency</HI> of Cir∣cumstances,
they attain not the chief Design,
they <HI>chime</HI> into a <HI>Second</HI> or a <HI>Third,</HI> or some
one in the <HI>infinite Chain</HI> of Effects. And this
Consideration seems to me an evident Proof of
<HI>Pre-existence;</HI> because every created spiritual
Being, or individual Spirit, must at last find out
a proper and peculiar material gross Prison to
do Penitence in for a Time.</P>
<P>10. THE Coat or Crust super-induc'd on
the primary <HI>linear Stamina,</HI> is intended to
enable them to bear without Pain or Violence
their future States, to sheath, defend, and cover
their Delicacy, extreme <HI>Sensibility</HI> and <HI>Minute∣ness,</HI>
from the Coarseness, Roughness, and In∣juries
of the Bodies that now surround us, in
this <HI>ruinous,</HI> broken, course State of our present
Habitation. They are designed only for the
<HI>Time</HI> of our <HI>Duration</HI> on this <HI>ruinous Globe;</HI>
for finite Spirits have <HI>Vehicles</HI> of one Kind or
<PB N="10" REF="27"/>
other to <HI>limit</HI> their Powers, and by whose Re∣sistance
and solid Obstacle, they may <HI>exert</HI> their
<HI>self-active</HI> and <HI>self-motive,</HI> now imprisoned
corporeal Faculties; no Spirit but the <HI>supreme,</HI>
the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Creator</HI> of Spirit and Matter,
being capable, <HI>it seems,</HI> of acting at a <HI>Distance,</HI>
or without the Mediation of some <HI>organis'd</HI>
Matter.</P>
<P>11. THE <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Contrivance</HI> of the
Author of Nature, has by <HI>general Laws</HI> so or∣der'd
the present State of Things, that the ex∣ternal
Superficies of the <HI>Viscera</HI> are not only
cover'd with special and particular Coats and
<HI>Membranes,</HI> (which are the great Organs of
their <HI>Activity</HI>) which defend them from the
Injuries of the coarse Solids or Fluids, or
the <HI>Element</HI> we must live in, in this State;
but each particular <HI>Fibril,</HI> each <HI>infinitesimal</HI> Hair
of an aetherial, or, as it were, spiritual Solid,
has a particular Coat of its own, to defend the
<HI>linear Twig,</HI> and convey Action and Impression
backward and forward; and the Whole is
involved with a <HI>Coat</HI> or <HI>Tunicle</HI> of such a
Nature, that the coarser and more compressing
the surrounding Fluids are, the <HI>thicker,</HI> and
more close and compact this <HI>Cover</HI> or <HI>Cuticle</HI>
mechanically grows, as we find by the <HI>Palms</HI>
of the Hands and <HI>Soles</HI> of the Feet of Day-Labourers,
and the <HI>Cuticle</HI> of the Poor and
Naked; each <HI>perspiratory Gland,</HI> each <HI>secre∣tory
Duct,</HI> sending out a <HI>Drop</HI> of viscous Mat∣ter,
<PB N="11" REF="28"/>
which the <HI>Air</HI> compresses, flattens and har∣dens
into a <HI>Scale,</HI> to cover the Mouths of the
subjacent <HI>perspiratory Gland;</HI> which <HI>Scale,</HI> by
a wonderful <HI>Mechanism,</HI> leaves its Mouth open,
and yet defends it from the Injury of grosser
and sharper Air, (like the Tiles of a House) the
<HI>Element</HI> of Land-Animals; and of these Scales,
thick'ning according to Necessity, the human
<HI>Cuticula</HI> is intirely composed. A <HI>Mechanism
analogous</HI> to this is prepared for <HI>Aquatics,</HI>
by a kind of <HI>mineral</HI> harder <HI>Scales,</HI> to defend
the tender Fibres from the Injury of the <HI>denser</HI>
and heavier <HI>Fluid</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> their <HI>Element.</HI></P>
<P>12. THE same <HI>analogous</HI> Contrivance is
provided for the Covering of the internal Su∣perficies
of the <HI>Bowels</HI> of Animals, (and besides
that, every original <HI>linear Solid</HI> has a Case or
Sheath) where an <HI>infinite</HI> Number of <HI>Glands,</HI>
by the Force of the animal Functions, are con∣tinually
<HI>spewing</HI> out a more viscous or crasser
Fluid, which becomes a Slime or <HI>Mucus</HI> to
sheath and defend them from the internal <HI>Aura,</HI>
and their <HI>Frictions</HI> upon one another, and by
its <HI>Lubricity</HI> to keep them (the <HI>Membranes</HI>)
moist and <HI>elastic.</HI> And as this internal <HI>Aura</HI>
is more delicate and less deleterious, than the
external Element, this Cuticle or <HI>Mucus</HI> is soft∣er
and thinner; but there is an absolute Neces∣sity
for such a <HI>Mucus</HI> and Cuticle, to moisten
and sheath their Delicacy and Sensibility, and
therefore this <HI>Cutis</HI> is thinner: For one so
<PB N="12" REF="29"/>
coarse and gross as the external Cuticle, would
offend and hurt these tender Parts.</P>
<P>13. <HI>LEWENHOECK</HI> found Tubes in
an animal Body so <HI>small</HI> and <HI>delicate,</HI> that put∣ting
a common Hair, and one of these <HI>Tubes</HI>
together, before the Object Glass of a Micro∣scope,
he computed it would require 600 such
<HI>Tubes</HI> to be as big as the Hair. We know
that every Point of an <HI>Animalcul</HI> is sensible,
and that to Sensation there must concur an
<HI>Artery,</HI> a <HI>Vein,</HI> and a <HI>Nerve.</HI> Every Point
of our Cuticle throws off a Steam or an Air
in a sound State; the same <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> found
125000 such organis'd Orifices under a Space
that a Grain of Sand would cover. All the
<HI>Membranes</HI> consist of Meshes like Net-work,
of different Forms and Figures: The Substance
of the Fibres that compose the Solids we find
to be cellular, or vesicular, like the Substance
of a Sponge, or the Pith of a Rush, which Cells
or <HI>Vesicles</HI> therefore must communicate or be
patent one into another.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Medical Essays, Vol. iv. p. 252.</NOTE> The learned Dr.
<HI>Porterfeild</HI> very justly concludes from Dr.
<HI>Hooke</HI>'s determining the <HI>Minimum visibile</HI> un∣der
an <HI>Angle</HI> of one <HI>Minute,</HI> that the Magnitude
of a single nervous Fibre cannot exceed the
3600th Part of a common Hair. All the Tubes,
Glands, and Cells of the Solids are filled with a
thin glutinous Water, and these make the solid
<PB N="13" REF="30"/>
Substance of the whole Matter of an Animal.
Water and Mercury are the only sensible Fluids
that can circulate, and enter in such Tubes, tho'
the last will do so but transiently, and only as a
Cleanser or Rammer to the Tubes.</P>
<P>14. THE <HI>Organs,</HI> the <HI>Glands, Tubes</HI> and
<HI>Fibres,</HI> but especially the <HI>Membranes,</HI> and
other solid Parts of Animals, are the most
<HI>elastic</HI> and <HI>ductile</HI> of any known Substance.
They may be drawn and spun out to an incon∣ceivable
Length, even to a Length almost be∣yond
Gold itself; which yet we know may be
extended on the Surface of Silver-Wire, from a
single Grain to many Leagues in Length. Yet
the <HI>Ductility</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> of <HI>animal</HI> Substan∣ces
seems much superior, and more delicate and
fine than that of any Metal or Vegetable, as is
evident in both these Qualities, from the Threads
of a <HI>Silkworm</HI> and <HI>Spider,</HI> and from the Vi∣brations
of <HI>Cat-gut</HI> in <HI>Music. Impostumes,
Schirrous Glands, Aneurisms</HI> and <HI>Wens,</HI> shew
how much a small Globule of animal Substance,
especially the <HI>membranous</HI> and <HI>fibrous,</HI> may be
stretch'd before it burst or break. All this shews
at least, that they are extremely fine, <HI>ductile,</HI>
and <HI>elastic.</HI> But this Elasticity lies in the Coat
or Membrane, not in the <HI>solid Content.</HI></P>
<P>15. THERE seems to be a <HI>Medium,</HI> or
golden Mean, between the extreme <HI>Minute∣ness</HI>
of some <HI>Particles</HI> of Matter, and the too
<PB N="14" REF="31"/>
great Coarseness and Largeness of <HI>others,</HI> that
is most proper for the Nourishment of animal
Bodies, and best suited to our present Situation,
and the Nature of the <HI>Fluids</HI> and <HI>Solids</HI> that
surround us. For Instance, <HI>Alcalious Salts,</HI>
which are only <HI>porous</HI> Earths (whether form'd
and figured by chymical, solar, or central Heat,
is not material) like a dry Sponge, being the
Nests, as it were, of <HI>acid</HI> Water, driven out of
their <HI>Pores</HI> by great Heat, whence they are again
render'd capable of receiving more of this <HI>Acid</HI>
into their <HI>Pores,</HI> whither it is drawn and soli∣cited
by the remaining <HI>Acid;</HI> These <HI>Salts,</HI> I
say, wou'd be improper Food for any Animal:
And here it may be observed by the by, the <HI>Fer∣mentation</HI>
with these <HI>Acids</HI> arises from their
rushing with Velocity and Violence into these
empty <HI>Pores,</HI> to fill their Vacuities. And the
<HI>Volatility</HI> of those <HI>Salts</HI> arises solely from a light
<HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Sulphur</HI> being added to them: So that
<HI>Alcali's</HI> may be really nothing but dry'd <HI>porous
Earths,</HI> with some remaining <HI>acid Salt</HI> in their
Pores; which by its <HI>Attraction</HI> draws more
<HI>Acid,</HI> to fill these Pores, when it comes within
their <HI>Sphere;</HI> and <HI>Salts</HI> are made volatile by
the Addition of light Oil. Both <HI>acid</HI> and <HI>al∣cali</HI>
Salts are improper Nourishment, as well
as improper Medicine for Animals, but where
they are design'd to destroy one another. This
may be the true <HI>Theory</HI> of Salts, and is conform∣able
to the Experiments of the greatest and
best Chymists, <HI>Newton, Boyle,</HI> and <HI>Geoffry.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="32"/>
If then the Particles of our Food were resolv'd
into their primary indivisible <HI>Atoms,</HI> such as
these, they wou'd not fit the <HI>Ruptures</HI> and
<HI>Chasms</HI> made in our Bodies by Action, and
Living, and the constant <HI>Abrasion</HI> of the Fluids
that surround us: And besides, by their Soli∣dity,
and greater Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> when
divided into their least and last Particles, they
would run into <HI>Clusters, crystalize,</HI> or sepa∣rate
into their several <HI>elementary</HI> Orders, by
this then prevalent Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and
form Bodies of a Composition different from
Flesh and Blood. So that the very best nou∣rishing
Particles for animal Bodies, are those
of the <HI>Third Order,</HI> of a middling Compo∣sition
and <HI>Size,</HI> of a rare, porous, and spongy
Texture, or a <HI>Medium</HI> between Particles made
of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> and those that partake
more of the other Elements, of <HI>Air, Water,</HI>
and <HI>Earth;</HI> or the smallest <HI>integral</HI> Particles
of animal and vegetable Substances. And hence
arises one Reason, why <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, <HI>Spi∣rits,</HI>
and <HI>distill'd</HI> Fluids of all Kinds, are so
<HI>unfriendly</HI> and destructive to animal Bodies.</P>
<P>16. FOR Distinction's sake, we may consider
<HI>three</HI> Degrees of the <HI>Size</HI> of Particles in Bo∣dies.
<HI>First,</HI> Those which may be reckon'd
the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>least,</HI> which must necessarily be
solid, compact, and indivisible, at least by any
<HI>finite</HI> or natural Force or Art. And these seem
to be the Particles that make the primitive
<PB N="16" REF="33"/>
Elements (first intended by the Author of Na∣ture)
already nam'd; <HI>viz.</HI> original <HI>Salt, Sulphur,
Air, Water</HI> and <HI>Earth;</HI> and may be consider'd
as <HI>unalterable,</HI> and always the same. Perhaps
their Figure may be triangular Prisms, Spheres,
and Cubes, and their Combinations; those
being the most simple Solids, <HI>and God and
Nature never do any thing in vain,</HI> or in a per∣plex'd
manner. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Those of the sim∣plest
Composition and Combination of these
<HI>elementary Particles,</HI> such as may be all our
<HI>Elements</HI> produc'd by Art, wherein there is
always a Mixture of all the other <HI>Elements,</HI> and
which no <HI>Art</HI> can produce absolutely pure and
simple; of this Kind are our now <HI>chymical</HI> depu∣rated
and rectify'd <HI>Salts, Sulphurs, Water, Air,</HI>
and <HI>Earth. Thirdly,</HI> The common Mixture
or Product of the least <HI>integral</HI> Particles, as we
find them in Nature, and without Art, in <HI>ani∣mal</HI>
and <HI>vegetable</HI> Substances, where these Ele∣ments
are combin'd in different Proportions. It
is of such <HI>Particles</HI> that the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Na∣ture</HI>
seems to have made the Choice and <HI>Pecu∣lium</HI>
for the Nourishment and Increase of ani∣mal
Bodies, when divided into their smallest
<HI>integral</HI> Parts, that our Bodies may thereby
become <HI>homogeneous,</HI> and in some kind <HI>similar</HI>
to the Bodies and Fluids that surround us. For
tho' <HI>Chymistry</HI> be a <HI>noble</HI> Art, and logical In∣strument
for natural <HI>Philosophy,</HI> yet I can
never think its Productions, of what Kind so∣ever,
or any of its <HI>analysed Fluids</HI> or <HI>Solids</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="34"/>
impregnated with the Substance and <HI>Matter</HI>
of Fire, fit for animal Bodies, but likely to
tear and destroy them sooner; else, in all Pro∣bability,
the <HI>Author of Nature</HI> would have
provided them ready for us. We call these
respectively <HI>Particles</HI> of the <HI>First, Second</HI> and
<HI>Third</HI> Composition.</P>
<P>17. NATURE'S Laws are <HI>general, uniform</HI>
and <HI>simple;</HI> and if they produce various Ef∣fects,
and shew different Appearances, it is
from different Circumstances and Situations
only. The highest Degree (for Example) of
<HI>Heat</HI> our Bodies can bear without Pain or Hurt,
is the same used for <HI>Vegetation,</HI> and not higher:
greater Degrees of Heat, <HI>actual</HI> or <HI>potential,</HI>
would rend and destroy them. The same Heat
which ripens <HI>Grapes,</HI> and later Fruits, conti∣nuing
to act on them when compress'd and
confin'd, makes them <HI>ferment;</HI> whereby the
Particles being disengag'd and separated, go into
Action, and <HI>verge</HI> towards their several <HI>Classes</HI>
and <HI>Orders,</HI> by their proper <HI>Attraction</HI> and
<HI>Gravity;</HI> a great Part of the <HI>earthy, airy,</HI> and
<HI>watery</HI> Particles being flung off, the Juices
become <HI>vinous,</HI> and have a greater Proportion of
inflammable Spirit thereby collected and united
in them, and, in any great Quantities taken in∣to
animal Bodies, by their greater Proportion
of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and consequent greater
<HI>Attraction,</HI> (these Particles being now un∣sheath'd,
and in an active State) must necessa∣rily
rend and tear them. The same <HI>Law of
<PB N="18" REF="35"/>
Heat, Attraction</HI> and <HI>Gravity</HI> still continu∣ing
to act, if the <HI>vinous</HI> Juice be left open and
at freedom, the <HI>sulphureous</HI> Particles, which
are the most <HI>volatile</HI> and light, will fly off, and
leave the Water and essential Salt, which will
thus become <HI>acetous;</HI> and this <HI>acetous</HI> Liquor,
treated by the Tortures of <HI>chymical</HI> Fires, will
still throw off the few Remains of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and
a great part of the Water, and retain the ma∣terial
Particles of <HI>Fire</HI> and essential <HI>Salts,</HI> and
so become <HI>Spirit of Vinegar,</HI> which in a
great Quantity forced into animal Bodies, will
act as a strong <HI>Caustic</HI> or rank Poison, by burn∣ing
up the tender <HI>Fibres,</HI> and coagulating the
Fluids, as all proper <HI>Poisons</HI> do by the same
Laws and <HI>Energy.</HI></P>
<P>18. WHETHER <HI>Fire,</HI> or the productive
Cause of Heat, be a real specifically distinct and
unalterable Kind of subtile Fluid, in itself incon∣vertible
into any other Nature, but lodg'd in
the Pores of other Bodies; or if it be only, which
is most probable, the last and smallest <HI>elastic</HI> Par∣ticles
of all Kinds of Matter, indifferently thrown
off and excited into Action by violent Motion,
is as yet undetermin'd, and of no great Conse∣quence
to ascertain, since on both <HI>Hypotheses</HI> its
real Effects are the same. That it is the grand
<HI>Agent</HI> in Body and dead Matter, and acts
always in the <HI>subduplicate</HI> Proportion of its
Distance, is certain. For the same Vegetables
compress'd and closely confin'd, so that their
<PB N="19" REF="36"/>
<HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> cannot be carried off, when
this <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> by being bruis'd and con∣center'd,
or kept within a narrow Bound, is
brought into an active State, by the Action
of Heat alone, putrify, turn <HI>mucilaginous</HI>
and <HI>foetid,</HI> and have all the Appearances of
<HI>animal</HI> Substances; which happens not when
the Vegetables are expos'd to the <HI>Air,</HI> for then
the <HI>oleaginous</HI> Particles would be carried off
by it, and a Solution of the <HI>essential Salts</HI> re∣maining,
they would turn only <HI>acetous.</HI> The
<HI>cadaverous</HI> Smell, in the former Case, shews
the Confinement of the <HI>Sulphurs;</HI> for it is
well known, such Smells (and indeed all
Smells) are owing to <HI>Sulphur.</HI> And thus we
see Nature's Law in Heat, from <HI>Vegetation</HI> to
<HI>Maturation,</HI> from <HI>Maturation</HI> to <HI>Fermenta∣tion,
Acetation</HI> and <HI>Putrefaction</HI> down to <HI>In∣cineration,</HI>
is the same Action of Heat exerted
only in different Degrees and Circumstances;
and that local Motion and Division, is the only
Action on Matter.</P>
<P>19. <HI>ANIMAL</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Substances
differ chiefly in the Proportions of the <HI>ele∣mentary</HI>
Principles of <HI>Salt, Sulphur, Air,
Water</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> contain'd in them. In
<HI>animal</HI> Substances, the two first (<HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sul∣phur</HI>)
are predominant; in <HI>Vegetables,</HI> the
three last. Not but that there are vegetable
Substances, in which the two first are more
predominant than in some animal Substances,
<PB N="20" REF="37"/>
as in <HI>Aromatics, oily Seeds, latter Fruits,
Eastern Gums,</HI> and the like; in which <HI>Salt</HI>
and <HI>Sulphur</HI> predominate much more than in
<HI>Chicken, Veal, Lamb</HI> and <HI>young white ani∣mal</HI>
Substances; for in Animals, the <HI>Salts</HI> and
<HI>Sulphurs</HI> abound most, as they verge towards
<HI>Maturity,</HI> and enter upon the Age of <HI>Gene∣ration;</HI>
and to the Abundance of them in
length of Time, this State, or Passion, is in a
great measure owing. But, generally speak∣ing,
the Matter is as I have stated it, both in
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> only <HI>Vegetables,</HI> in
general, have more of the unactive, innocuous
Principles of Air, Water and Earth in them;
and <HI>animal</HI> Substances more of the active and
deleterious Principles of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur.</HI>
Add to these this other material Difference,
that the <HI>Strainers, Glands</HI> and <HI>capillary Tubes</HI>
in <HI>Animals,</HI> are <HI>infinitely</HI> more in Number,
and more fine and complicated than in <HI>Vege∣tables;</HI>
and that, besides the external <HI>Heat</HI>
common to both, <HI>Animals</HI> have an internal
Principle of <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Action,</HI> to divide, di∣gest
and attenuate the Particles of Aliment to a
greater Degree of Subtilty and Minuteness, and
consequently to unite and combine animal
Substances with greater Force; for <HI>Fire,</HI> like
all violent Motion, divides first, and then
their <HI>attractive</HI> Virtue <HI>classes</HI> and combines
the <HI>homogeneous</HI> Particles.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="38"/>
20. FROM this Account of the <HI>Laws</HI> and
<HI>Operations</HI> of Nature, and of the <HI>animal Oe∣conomy,</HI>
it will not be difficult for a thinking
Person, to chuse the Foods most proper for
<HI>Health, long Life,</HI> and the clearest Use of his
Senses and intellectual Faculties. It is most
certain, the <HI>human Race</HI> has been, with infi∣nite
Wisdom and Foresight, fitted both for
<HI>Animal</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Food, both of which
will answer the mention'd <HI>Conditions,</HI> if not
equally, yet sufficiently and fully, when pro∣perly
chosen. The <HI>Rule</HI> to go by in this Case,
is, to chuse in these two different kinds of
Food, those which are most easily <HI>dissolvible</HI>
into their <HI>integral Parts,</HI> that are least <HI>tena∣cious</HI>
and <HI>coherent,</HI> that are lightest in Weight,
and most porous and crumbling, and that have
the fewest <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs</HI> in their Com∣position,
and abound most in the other Prin∣ciples,
whose Parts are less <HI>attractive,</HI> and will
not so readily, when <HI>analys'd</HI> by the <HI>animal
Functions,</HI> run into greater <HI>Clusters</HI> so as to
<HI>crystallise:</HI> and this will do all towards Life,
Health and clear Faculties, that the Nature of
gross <HI>Matter,</HI> the Laws of <HI>Mortality,</HI> and the
Ends of <HI>Providence,</HI> in our present Situation
will admit.</P>
<P>21. THE <HI>Strainers, Analysers</HI> and <HI>diges∣tive</HI>
or <HI>secretive Organs</HI> in Animals, are not
the <HI>Glands</HI> only, properly so call'd, but the
<PB N="22" REF="39"/>
converging <HI>Arteries,</HI> with their muscular
Coats and Ramifications, the <HI>Lymphatics,</HI> the
<HI>Valves</HI> and <HI>Inosculations</HI> of the several Tubes,
with the infinite <HI>Curvatures</HI> and <HI>Convolu∣tions</HI>
of all these, which insensibly divide, se∣gregate
and class the several Juices and consti∣tuent
Particles: But the most sensible and per∣ceptible
Secretions and <HI>Analyses,</HI> are chiefly
perform'd by the <HI>Glands;</HI> and to conceive
their <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Structure,</HI> we need only
consider the <HI>primary</HI> great and visible one of
the first <HI>Digestion, viz.</HI> that contain'd under
the <HI>Stomach, Intestines</HI> and <HI>Lacteals;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Bellini Opera.</NOTE> for
<HI>analogous</HI> to this visible and intelligible <HI>Gland,</HI>
are all the other smaller and imperceptible
<HI>ones,</HI> with due regard to their <HI>Situation</HI> and
Use; all form'd by different <HI>Complications</HI>
and <HI>Convolutions</HI> of the <HI>evanescent Arteries,</HI>
with proper secretory Tubes from containing
<HI>Basons,</HI> attended with Veins and <HI>Nerves,</HI>
which being infinite in Number, and various
in <HI>Curvatures</HI> and <HI>Convolutions,</HI> have yet one
general <HI>analogous</HI> and similar Nature, which
nothing less than infinite Wisdom and Saga∣city
could have contrived and executed, as
must be evident to a thinking Person.</P>
<P>22. WHAT more may be necessary for the
perfect <HI>Concoction</HI> and <HI>Digestion</HI> of the Food,
to convert it into animal Substance by the
<PB N="23" REF="40"/>
great <HI>Gland</HI> of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> and the other
lesser Glands, together with the <HI>muscular</HI> Ac∣tion
of the Coats of the <HI>Arteries</HI> and Veins,
than gentle Heat and gentle Motion, I will
not take upon me to say. Some are of Opi∣nion,
that the <HI>lumbaginous</HI> and <HI>spermatic
Animalcul</HI> may have an original and created
Tincture or <HI>Zest,</HI> from some specific or subtile
Fluid, infus'd at its first Creation, which may
serve to maturate and perfect the <HI>specific</HI> Secre∣tions
and Concoctions in these <HI>Glands,</HI> in all
future times of its Duration here. And this
Opinion may appear somewhat probable, by
considering the Nature of <HI>Runnet</HI> made of a
Calf's Stomach, and its Use in turning of Milk;
by observing, that the younger the Calf is, the
sooner the Milk in its Stomach is turn'd into
<HI>Curds</HI> and <HI>Whey;</HI> and that the sweet <HI>Whey,</HI>
or aqueous part of the Milk only, enters the
<HI>Lacteals,</HI> the Curd mostly turning into Excre∣ment,
and being carried out of the Body by the
<HI>Intestines.</HI> For the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals</HI> in
an <HI>Animal,</HI> in a natural State, are at all times,
and much more in its first <HI>Stages</HI> of living, so
fine and strait, that no Milk, no not even Asses
Milk, can enter them in its <HI>integral</HI> and un∣broken
State; nothing but the very thinnest,
most aqueous and lightest Particles of Food, in a
Vapour, can, without Violence and Pain, enter
the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals</HI> at any time of Life,
which are invisible to the finest Eyes, and
scarce perceptible by the finest Glasses; so that
<PB N="24" REF="41"/>
some great <HI>Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Physicians</HI> have
concluded them intirely of the Nature of a
<HI>Filtre</HI> or very fine <HI>Search.</HI> A <HI>Down,</HI> Velvet,
or <HI>Tomentum,</HI> being discover'd in all the secre∣tory
Ducts of the <HI>Glands,</HI> and an original <HI>Zest,</HI>
being visible by its Colour in the <HI>Liver,</HI> even in
the <HI>Foetus.</HI> The specific Juice in the Stomach
of all the Young that feed on Milk, turn it
into a gentle Curd; the Bone in a <HI>Dy</HI> that a
Child had swallow'd, having been consum'd
and wasted, when the <HI>Wood</HI> that made its
black Spots and Points, was not touch'd.
These, and many more Observations, make it
more than probable, that in <HI>Digestion</HI> there is
something beside <HI>Trituration,</HI> and in the <HI>Glands</HI>
an original specifically attractive <HI>Zest.</HI> We
know, that the Steams of <HI>Mercury</HI> will salivate
and pervade all the Parts of an <HI>animal</HI> Sub∣stance,
whose <HI>parenchymatous</HI> Matter, when
drain'd of its Juices, becomes entirely <HI>spon∣geous</HI>
and <HI>cellular;</HI> so that any <HI>subtile</HI> Fluid
may pervade it, after sufficient Hunger has
drain'd it. But this original <HI>Zest</HI> in the
<HI>Glands,</HI> gentle Heat, and gentle <HI>Triture</HI>
from multiplied <HI>muscular Motion,</HI> are suffi∣cient
to explain all the Appearances of <HI>Con∣coction</HI>
and <HI>Nutrition.</HI> And I should, without
Hesitation, define <HI>Chyle,</HI> in a natural and
healthy State, an <HI>Emulsion</HI> made on Water of
the <HI>integral</HI> Particles of <HI>animal</HI> or <HI>vegetable</HI>
Substances by gentle Heat and Motion; which
Particles by further Heat, and the respective
<PB N="25" REF="42"/>
Action of the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Glands,</HI> are first
more minutely divided, and after associated by
the several <HI>Glands</HI> respectively.</P>
<P>23. <HI>SECRETION</HI> is perform'd by a
very simple, though very wonderful <HI>Appara∣tus,</HI>
both in the greater perceptible <HI>Gland of
Concoction,</HI> and the lesser imperceptible ones,
<HI>conglobate</HI> and <HI>conglomerate,</HI> to derive parti∣cular
Juices for appropriated Uses. For, 1.
The <HI>aqueous</HI> Part of the <HI>arterial</HI> mixt Fluid is
drawn off by the <HI>Lymphatics,</HI> each <HI>Artery</HI>
having one or more <HI>Lymphatics</HI> constantly
attending it for that Purpose. 2. The many
<HI>Convolutions</HI> in different <HI>Curvatures</HI> and In∣clinations
of the <HI>Artery</HI> in the <HI>Gland,</HI> by re∣tarding
the <HI>Circulation,</HI> afford Time for the
several specific Particles to approach and act
upon one another, by their own innate <HI>Laws
of Gravity, Attraction</HI> and <HI>Repulsion;</HI> for
which further Purpose each <HI>Gland</HI> is furnish'd
with a proper <HI>Reservoir</HI> or <HI>Bason,</HI> where the
Particles are left entirely to act by their own
innate Qualities; and with Veins, to carry off
that Part of the mixt Blood that is now drain'd
of its specific Particles. But, 3. The most
wonderful Part of this <HI>Apparatus</HI> has been late∣ly
discover'd and made manifest by <HI>Winslow,</HI>
where he tells, that after innumerable Trials
and Observations, he constantly found the <HI>se∣cretory</HI>
Duct of every <HI>Gland</HI> cover'd all over
in its Inside with a Velvet <HI>Tow</HI> or <HI>Plush-coat,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="43"/>
as a Filtre to it; and always, in Young and Old,
tinged with a Liquor <HI>analogous</HI> and <HI>homoge∣neous</HI>
to the Liquor secreted by the respective
<HI>Gland:</HI> Which is a wonderful Confirmation
of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Theory of Secretion,
which ascribes it to a specific <HI>Attraction</HI> from
the particular Nature and Matter in the secre∣tory
Gland. And, 4. From this Bason or En∣largement
of the Tubes, there goes a secretory
Duct, to carry the now secreted and class'd Par∣ticles
for the intended Uses and Purposes of
Nature. Just as in a Mixture of Grain or Shot of
various Sizes and Magnitudes, several Searches
may be contriv'd of different Degrees of Fine∣ness,
to separate each of them distinctly; so in
the <HI>animal Glands,</HI> the <HI>Lymphatics</HI> separate
first the thin Water or <HI>Lymph</HI> of the <HI>Chyle</HI>
and Blood; the <HI>Emunctories</HI> and <HI>parotid
Glands,</HI> the thicker and more glutinous Se∣rum,
to lubricate the <HI>Stomach, Guts</HI> and <HI>Mem∣branes;</HI>
the <HI>Liver,</HI> (a more operose and com∣plicated
<HI>Gland</HI>) the <HI>Gall,</HI> to promote the <HI>pe∣ristaltic</HI>
Motion, to stimulate and open the
Mouths of the Lacteals, and to unite and <HI>ho∣mogenize</HI>
the Particles of the <HI>Chyle;</HI> the Kid∣nies,
the <HI>Urine;</HI> the <HI>Testicles,</HI> the <HI>Sperm;</HI>
the cutaneous Glands, the <HI>Air:</HI> and each <HI>Gland</HI>
is more complicated, as the Substance it secretes
is more viscid; the finer Parts being first car∣ried
off, leave the grosser more at rest, and at
Liberty to act upon one another by their spe∣cific
Laws of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Gravity;</HI> for we
<PB N="27" REF="44"/>
must necessarily suppose the <HI>Materia Prima</HI>
to have been <HI>simular</HI> in its Nature, and that
Division alone makes all the Difference of Par∣ticles,
together with <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Gravity;</HI> and
for the Exertion of this last Quality on the Par∣ticles,
some Degree of Rest and Approximation
is absolutely necessary, that they may come near,
which the infinite <HI>Complication</HI> and <HI>Convolu∣tion</HI>
of the <HI>capillary Arteries,</HI> and the Subtrac∣tion
of the more fluid and thin Part of the Mix∣ture,
naturally procures in this Case.</P>
<P>24. WE may have some gross and general
Notion of the Conduct of Nature in its Ope∣ration
of <HI>Secretion,</HI> from what we observe of
making of <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Sea-water.</HI> It is boil'd so
long till a great part of the <HI>aqueous</HI> Particles
is evaporated, the <HI>saline</HI> Particles, by reason of
their greater Size and Gravity, not being able
to rise so fast, and in so great Quantities; and
by this <HI>Evaporation</HI> of the Water, the <HI>saline</HI>
Particles are brought nearer and more crowd∣ed,
and, being highly <HI>attractive,</HI> they unite
in greater <HI>Clusters;</HI> and when set to cool, be∣ing
lighter than Water when thus united, they
form a <HI>Film</HI> or <HI>Cuticle</HI> on its Top; and this
<HI>Film</HI> or <HI>Cuticle</HI> skim'd off, and expos'd to a
gentle Heat, to evaporate the remaining Wa∣ter,
hardens and <HI>crystalises,</HI> and assumes the
form of <HI>Salt.</HI> So it is in Nature's Operation
of the specific <HI>glandular Secretions</HI> of Chyle,
<HI>Fat, Sperm, Choler, Wind</HI> and <HI>Flegm.</HI> In
such <HI>Glands</HI> there is a <HI>Bason,</HI> or <HI>Receptacu∣lum
<PB N="28" REF="45"/>
commune,</HI> where the specific Particles be∣ing
at rest, after most of the <HI>Lymph,</HI> and the
less saturated arterial Blood, are carried off by
the Veins, they become more crowded, and
are brought within one another's <HI>Spheres</HI> of <HI>At∣traction,</HI>
whence they coalesce and unite into
<HI>Clusters,</HI> and in this Form are carried out for
the Uses of Nature, by a <HI>secretory Duct</HI> pro∣per
for that Purpose: Though even these <HI>Se∣cretions</HI>
are never absolutely <HI>homogeneous</HI> and
pure, but mixt with integral Particles. The
healthier the Animal is, the more <HI>homogeneous</HI>
and pure is the secreted Matter; but in a <HI>mor∣bid</HI>
State, they are <HI>heterogeneous</HI> and impure.</P>
<P>25. THE several Sets or Orders of <HI>Glands</HI>
or <HI>Searches,</HI> in the healthy State of an Ani∣mal,
separate respectively and in a regular Pro∣gression,
all the superfluous and redundant
<HI>Particles</HI> of the <HI>Chyle,</HI> and leave only the
pure, nourishing and <HI>springifying</HI> (if I may so
speak) Particles in the <HI>Serum.</HI> The <HI>emun∣ctory
Glands</HI> deprive it of the gross, earthy and
watery Parts for their Purpose: The <HI>Liver</HI> se∣parates
the grosser and essential (or rather <HI>Sea</HI>)
<HI>Salt,</HI> together with the thicker and less pure
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> both which chiefly constitute the
<HI>Bile:</HI> The <HI>Lymphatics</HI> take off the more
watery Parts: The <HI>adipose Glands</HI> and <HI>Blad∣ders,</HI>
the purer <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Sulphur:</HI> The <HI>sper∣matic</HI>
Glands, the more volatile and finer ani∣mal
Salts, <HI>Sulphurs</HI> and <HI>Earths;</HI> and the <HI>cu∣ticular
<PB N="29" REF="46"/>
Glands,</HI> the permanent or artificial <HI>Air,</HI>
as it is set free or generated. The <HI>intestinal</HI>
Tube, like a Common-shore, carries off all
the Nastiness, Superfluity and Refuse of the
Aliment. Thus wise Nature has provided
Means to keep the internal Parts of the <HI>ani∣mal
Machine</HI> clean and sweet, so long as may
be its Duration in this State, if we do not clog
or obstruct her Operations.</P>
<P>26. THE <HI>Milk</HI> of Animals fed on Vegeta∣bles
is nothing but an <HI>Emulsion</HI> made on Wa∣ter,
impregnated with the <HI>integral</HI> Particles of
<HI>Vegetables,</HI> dissolved by animal Heat, and the
<HI>muscular</HI> Action of the <HI>Stomachs</HI> of the Ani∣mals,
passing through the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and go∣ing
directly to the <HI>mammilary Glands,</HI> or at
least before it has often pass'd through the
Lungs; for then, by the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the Air, and
grinding in the Lungs, it must necessarily
change its Colour, as we see in the first Milk
of <HI>Animals</HI> that have just parted with the
<HI>Foetus.</HI> And therefore Milk is very little dif∣ferent
from weak <HI>Soups, Broths</HI> or <HI>Emul∣sions,</HI>
strongly bruis'd in a <HI>Mortar,</HI> and digest∣ed
with a moderate Heat, and often strain'd
through a fine <HI>Search.</HI> Such an <HI>Emulsion,</HI> ar∣tificially
prepar'd, will equally nourish tender
young <HI>Animals</HI> as Milk itself; as we see by
Children bred up by the Hand, and <HI>Animals</HI>
taken from their <HI>Dams:</HI> and a small Por∣tion
of an <HI>oleaginous Alcali</HI> will <HI>homogenise</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="47"/>
and unite such an <HI>Emulsion,</HI> and keep its Parts
from separating, as it is in Milk; such as <HI>Su∣gar,
Honey,</HI> and the like: and thus may be
made an <HI>artificial Milk,</HI> of the same Effect to
nourish a tender <HI>Animal</HI> with natural <HI>Milk</HI> itself.</P>
<P>27. <HI>ANIMAL</HI> Substances and fermented
Liquors, when taken for Food, by the Action
of the <HI>digestive</HI> Powers in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI>
are turn'd into an <HI>Emulsion</HI> (in the Manner
has been describ'd) consisting of their <HI>integral</HI>
Parts: By the <HI>muscular Action</HI> of these <HI>Or∣gans,</HI>
and of the <HI>abdominal Muscles</HI> in <HI>Respi∣ration,</HI>
but especially by the reciprocal Action
of the <HI>peristaltic</HI> Motion, the finer and more
subtile Parts only of this <HI>Chyle,</HI> or <HI>Emulsion,</HI>
are propell'd through the <HI>fine lacteal Searches,</HI>
and in repeated Circulations, being mix'd with
the Blood, and passing through the <HI>Lungs,</HI>
there acquire, by the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the Air and the
Compression of the pneumatic <HI>Mill,</HI> (by which
the integral Parts are further bruis'd) that pre∣cise
Magnitude of Parts which gives them a
<HI>scarlet</HI> Colour, (for this is known to depend
on a certain <HI>Magnitude</HI> of <HI>superficial Par∣ticles</HI>)
and are thus turned into pure <HI>arterial
Blood,</HI> to be further elabour'd in the particular
<HI>Glands</HI> for the future Uses of Nature.</P>
<P>28. THE <HI>Globules</HI> of Blood are form'd in
the larger Trunks of the Arteries and Veins,
and even in the <HI>Intestines</HI> and <HI>Receptaculum
<PB N="31" REF="48"/>
commune Chyli,</HI> by the innate <HI>Attraction</HI> of
their Parts; a central Particle, either perhaps
of <HI>finer Air, Salt</HI> or <HI>Sulphur,</HI> drawing to∣wards
it all those within the <HI>Sphere</HI> of its <HI>At∣traction,</HI>
there necessarily and <HI>mechanically</HI>
forms itself into a <HI>Globule;</HI> for this wise End
and Purpose, that being porous, <HI>globular</HI> and
<HI>elastic,</HI> it may accommodate itself, by turning
into a flat or oblong <HI>Spheroid,</HI> according to
the Necessity and Figure of the <HI>Tube</HI> through
which it is to pass, and so to keep the Sides of
the finer <HI>Tubes</HI> from <HI>coalescing</HI> or being ob∣structed.
Those <HI>red Globules</HI> make the <HI>gru∣mous</HI>
part of the Blood. And in the <HI>Serum</HI>
itself also there are many of these to be found
of a whiter Colour, which probably make the
true <HI>nutritive Globules,</HI> to stop Crannies, and
incrassate the primary <HI>Fibrils.</HI> But when the
<HI>Serum</HI> becomes gross or lixivial, the greatest
part of these fine <HI>scarlet Globules</HI> are com∣press'd,
and burst or flatten'd, and thereby the
<HI>Grume</HI> becomes duskish and black, and the
original Beauty, Colour and Magnitude, and
Shape of these <HI>Globules</HI> are chang'd. We have
an obvious Model of this Operation of Nature,
in the Globules of <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Vinegar,</HI> when
mix'd with a quick Motion.</P>
<P>29. As to <HI>muscular Motion,</HI> it is very
ingeniously, and with great Probability, ac∣counted
for by Dr. <HI>Bryan Robinson,</HI> from
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Principles of an infi∣nitely
<PB N="32" REF="49"/>
rare and elastic Fluid; (<HI>spiritus quidam</HI>)
which is the <HI>Theory</HI> of some other <HI>Mathema∣ticians.</HI>
Now nothing can be more elegant,
<HI>mechanical,</HI> natural and <HI>adequate</HI> to all this
Appearance, than this Account of <HI>muscular</HI>
Motion, if this elastic Fluid could be proved.
But surely the <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the Fibres, especi∣ally
of their <HI>membranous</HI> Coats of the infi∣nitesimal
<HI>nervous Fibrils,</HI> which they have
from the <HI>Meninges,</HI> which every one allows
to be extremely <HI>elastic,</HI> must have the far
greater Share in all the animal Functions, and
in <HI>muscular Motion.</HI> But of this more here∣after.</P>
<P>30. WHAT are the true <HI>primitive</HI> mate∣rial
<HI>Organs</HI> employ'd in Thinking and <HI>Cogi∣tation,</HI>
what their Nature and Figure, is abso∣lutely
unknown, and, I fear, unknowable by
us. That this <HI>immaterial Principle,</HI> in its
present State of Union, necessarily requires
some <HI>organis'd</HI> Instruments in its <HI>intellectual</HI>
Operations, as well as the Senses do, I think,
is past all doubt. <HI>Debauches, Diseases</HI> and
<HI>Accidents,</HI> hurt and spoil many of our <HI>intel∣lectual</HI>
and <HI>spiritual</HI> Functions, and <HI>Medicine</HI>
and <HI>Art</HI> will restore and recover them; and
to be perfectly perform'd, they require an en∣tire
Sanity in the great primary <HI>Organs.</HI> That
the <HI>Nerves</HI> (which are certainly slender, cel∣lular
and, perhaps, unelastic <HI>Filaments,</HI> at least
in their Pith) are absolutely necessary to <HI>mus∣cular
Motion,</HI> is most certain; and whether
<PB N="33" REF="50"/>
they require to be inflated by a <HI>Materia Subtilis,</HI>
or <HI>Liquidum Nervosum;</HI> yet none doubts, that
the first <HI>Impulse</HI> proceeds from the <HI>immaterial
Substance;</HI> and the same Impulse and Energy
may be communicated directly to fitly <HI>fram'd</HI>
and duly <HI>organiz'd</HI> Filaments, at least to their
<HI>membranous</HI> Coats, without the Intermediation
of any subtile Fluid: and whether that <HI>Fluid</HI> be
<HI>real</HI> and necessary or not, can never be ascer∣tain'd;
in this Point all can be but probable
Conjecture only here. Some subtile Fluid may
be requir'd towards <HI>Hearing</HI> and <HI>Seeing,</HI> be∣cause
nothing but the <HI>First Cause</HI> can act at a
Distance without a <HI>Medium;</HI> but the <HI>sentient
Principle</HI> has the <HI>Nerves</HI> between it and Ob∣jects,
to act and be acted reciprocally on: For that
all Bodies whose Particles are continuous, must
be <HI>repellent</HI> and reactive, is necessary from the
Nature of Matter; and though this <HI>subtile Fluid</HI>
may be, perhaps, convenient to account for the
Appearances of inanimated Matter, yet it seems
here <HI>multiplying</HI> Causes and Qualities without
Necessity.</P>
<P>31. WE find that the <HI>Brain</HI> of all <HI>Animals</HI>
is guarded more strongly, and with greater Care
and Industry, than any other <HI>Organ</HI> of the
Body. No living <HI>Animal</HI> has ever been found
without a <HI>Brain,</HI> or something analogous
to it: they have all pretty much the same
general Structure and Texture. <HI>Wounds</HI> and
<HI>Bruises</HI> in it, if they are deep, constantly
put an <HI>End</HI> to living, at least to <HI>rational Life</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="51"/>
and <HI>Thinking. Concussions,</HI> Strokes, <HI>Fissures</HI>
and <HI>Contusions,</HI> generally disorder <HI>Life,</HI> and
always some kinds of <HI>Thinking;</HI> small Strokes
on some particular Parts, affect Thinking and
Living more than greater on others. We can∣not
but imagin, that it is somewhere in, with and
by our <HI>Brain,</HI> that we think and consider: <HI>Cho∣ler,
Wind,</HI> and <HI>Crudity,</HI> render <HI>Thinking</HI> pain∣ful
and irregular. To have an uniform clear
Head, the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> must be clean, and all the
<HI>Functions</HI> regular and easy. Want of due na∣tural
Rest, <HI>i. e.</HI> necessary Repair, will, at last, great∣ly
disorder Thinking in the most Healthy; and
the <HI>Passions,</HI> rais'd to any Height, (especially
the dark and painful ones) wonderfully dis∣compose
ease and pleasant <HI>Thinking.</HI> From
all which it is highly probable, that the <HI>Organs</HI>
and material Instruments of <HI>Thinking</HI> are the
<HI>nervous Glands,</HI> and <HI>Fibres,</HI> and the <HI>infinite
Convolutions</HI> and <HI>Combinations</HI> of these <HI>Nerves</HI>
in the <HI>Brain;</HI> and that the <HI>Conduits</HI> of <HI>mus∣cular
Motion</HI> are the same <HI>Nerves,</HI> spread
over and branch'd out in every the minutest
Part of the Body. I say, the <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Cogi∣tation</HI>
are, at least, in their Origin, in the <HI>Brain</HI>
and its <HI>Appendages,</HI> whose Texture, Nature,
Uses and Manner of Operation, are hitherto
very imperfectly described or understood, and,
I fear, are above finite <HI>Comprehension;</HI> Generals
being all we shall ever know in the Works of
the <HI>God of Nature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="52"/>
32. I IMAGIN, the <HI>spiritual</HI> Substance uses
material Organs, of one kind of Matter or
another, in its <HI>Operations;</HI> and it is high∣ly
probable, they are the <HI>nervous Glands,</HI>
the <HI>Filaments,</HI> the <HI>Nerves,</HI> but especially the
membranous Coats of the infinitesimal <HI>Nervuli,</HI>
and their wonderful Texture and Mechanism,
so little known or understood. We find
<HI>Ideots</HI> have its <HI>Texture</HI> and common <HI>Figure</HI>
unnatural: Thus their <HI>Forehead</HI> is some∣times
too narrow, the <HI>Hindhead</HI> too long, or
the <HI>Crown</HI> too high, by some unnatural Com∣pression
or Accident in the Womb, whereby
the intellectual Functions of the <HI>Brain</HI> are
disorder'd and render'd incapable of Action.
An <HI>Hydrocephalus,</HI> an <HI>Impostume,</HI> an <HI>Excres∣cence,</HI>
a harden'd or schirrous <HI>Gland,</HI> an <HI>In∣sect</HI>
in the Brain, has been known to give in∣tense
Pain and <HI>Headach,</HI> and to have deaden'd
or quite extinguish'd the <HI>spiritual Functions:</HI>
Whether the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Brain</HI>
be only <HI>Elongations</HI> of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> or a distinct
Substance of themselves, (the Brain having arte∣rial
<HI>Glands</HI> and Branches only to keep them in
due Heat, Humidity, Tension and Nuttiture)
is not material; but on their <HI>Integrity, Sound∣ness</HI>
and <HI>Pliancy,</HI> (which must be preserv'd
and maintain'd by that of the whole Body) does
regular, easy and deep Thinking depend. <HI>Astruc</HI>
has, I think, offer'd strong and probable Con∣jectures
about the <HI>Mechanism</HI> of the <HI>Brain,</HI> and
the Manner of its communicating and receiving
Impressions, and beginning <HI>Vibrations,</HI> from
<PB N="36" REF="53"/>
the, and to the <HI>self-moving</HI> and <HI>sentient</HI> Principle
the Soul, from the Principles of <HI>Music</HI> and
<HI>Harmony.</HI> Because the <HI>Brain</HI> is pulpy, and the
<HI>Nerves</HI> lax, some have thought <HI>both</HI> unfit for
receiving or communicating <HI>Vibrations</HI> or <HI>Un∣dulations,</HI>
not considering that the great Activity
of both lies in their <HI>Membranes,</HI> that involve
every the least <HI>Fibril</HI> or <HI>infinitesimal Nerve:</HI> they
are all included and tied, as it were, in a <HI>mem∣branous</HI>
Bag, and fasten'd together by Threads
of the same: And every one knows, <HI>Mem∣branes</HI>
are the most elastic, and fittest to transmit
<HI>Vibrations</HI> of all Bodies whatsoever; their inter∣nal
Substance is probably <HI>cellular,</HI> like the Pith
of a Rush, design'd only to separate a milky Sub∣stance,
(which the Ignorant call the <HI>Liquidum
Nervosum</HI>) intended to preserve their <HI>Elas∣ticity,
Glibness,</HI> and the <HI>vibrating</HI> Powers of
these <HI>Membranes,</HI> in which their <HI>mechanical</HI>
Virtue alone consists. The Pleasure, Facility
and Elegance of Cogitation, consists in the Sup∣pleness,
Culture and habitual Exercise of those
<HI>nervous Organs;</HI> just as much, as a graceful
and easy Carriage and Manner of the Body is
acquir'd by proper Exercise, and repeated Acts.
We must use this sort of intellectual Exercise,
and apply these <HI>nervous Glands</HI> in Thinking,
in the same manner as we use the several Mus∣cles,
or widen, and direct the Pupil to a pro∣per
Distance in <HI>seeing:</HI> For Attention and Con∣sideration,
we must fix these material Organs
of the <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculty, as we fix our Eyes
to see or discern distinctly, and by repeated
<PB N="37" REF="54"/>
Acts acquire Facility and Perfection equally in
both: They may be spoil'd, inflam'd, Jaun∣dic'd,
made <HI>epileptic</HI> or <HI>paralytic, callous</HI> or
<HI>clumsy,</HI> in the same Manner, and almost by
the same Means, we bring our Eyes or other
Senses to that State. We must think frequently
and intensely, to be able to think justly and
deeply.</P>
<P>33. THE Bodies of the <HI>brute</HI> Creation,
with regard to Circumstances, are of the same
<HI>analogous</HI> Nature with those of the <HI>human</HI>
Race. The <HI>animal Functions</HI> of <HI>Digestion,
Circulation, Perspiration, Respiration</HI> and
<HI>Secretion,</HI> are perform'd in them, in the same
<HI>analogous</HI> Manner as in us, with proper Re∣gard
to Circumstances; and they are actuated
and animated by a <HI>spiritual Substance</HI> of some
one <HI>Rank</HI> or <HI>Order,</HI> for some infinitely wise
Purpose; for <HI>organiz'd</HI> Matter alone cannot
account for their <HI>Functions.</HI> We see, by ob∣serving
the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least,</HI> that is, by
living according to the general <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Or∣der</HI>
of Nature, excepting <HI>Accidents</HI> and <HI>epide∣mical
Distempers,</HI> they live and die with few
or no <HI>Distempers,</HI> and pass this Period of their
Duration with tolerable Ease and Tranquillity;
except the few that our <HI>Example,</HI> Manage∣ment,
or social Influence <HI>debauch:</HI> and it is
observable, that only those who are carni∣vorous,
or are in Danger of <HI>over-cramming,</HI> by
the Flavour of their <HI>Food,</HI> have <HI>Organs</HI> for vo∣miting,
or, at least, do vomit, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but
<PB N="38" REF="55"/>
those under our <HI>Direction</HI> and Government, or
taught, or are fed and cultivated by <HI>us,</HI> have the
Diseases <HI>analogous</HI> to, or the same with ours,
which are constantly produc'd by over-much or
improper feeding them, as is well known in <HI>na∣tural
History;</HI> and all their Distempers are con∣stantly
cur'd, if <HI>carnivorous,</HI> by being confin'd
to a total <HI>vegetable</HI> or <HI>Milk</HI> Diet; if granivo∣rous,
by lessening or diluting their Food, as I
have seen by Experience.</P>
<P>34. <HI>SLEEP</HI> I conceive to be caus'd by
the <HI>Disability</HI> and Incapacity of the bodily <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
to continue and perpetuate the active
<HI>rational</HI> and <HI>voluntary Functions.</HI> With∣out
Repair, Nutrition and winding up, they
grow <HI>languid</HI> and <HI>unelastic.</HI> When by La∣bour,
or the <HI>common Expence of living,</HI> the
<HI>Organs</HI> are relax'd and debilitated, there must
be an alternate <HI>Cessation</HI> to repair and refit
them, which is call'd <HI>Sleep;</HI> and accordingly
we find the <HI>animal</HI> Body shorten'd and com∣press'd
by its own <HI>Weight,</HI> by Action, and by
the Loss of its <HI>Spring</HI> against Night, and length∣en'd
and extended again in a Morning. What
hinders <HI>Sleep,</HI> is the continual <HI>Action</HI> of an
internal Fluid, <HI>Wind</HI> or <HI>Flatulence,</HI> acting on
the <HI>internal Membranes,</HI> (of which the Bowels
principally consist) pricking and stimulating
them, and forcing them into <HI>Action;</HI> and by
the <HI>Recoil</HI> or <HI>elastic</HI> Sharpness of this internal
<HI>Aura</HI> or <HI>Flatus,</HI> producing wild <HI>Cogitation,</HI> or
irregular <HI>intellectual Operations.</HI> Hence it is,
<PB N="39" REF="56"/>
that the Body is restless; and often there is an
Endeavour to <HI>gulp, expel</HI> and <HI>throw</HI> up this
<HI>Wind;</HI> that Medicines that force the <HI>Perspi∣ration,</HI>
as <HI>Opiates, Eastern Gums, animal
Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits, Aromatics, Cordials</HI> and
<HI>Diaphoretics,</HI> procure <HI>Sleep;</HI> and a <HI>Dose</HI> of
the <HI>Pilul. Gummos.</HI> with an <HI>Aloetic,</HI> will give
a good Night, as it drives out the <HI>perspirable</HI>
Matter every way; and <HI>Cyder,</HI> and any flatu∣lent
Food, (as green Pease) will hinder it.
<HI>Dreaming</HI> is but <HI>partial Sleeping,</HI> for <HI>Sleep</HI>
admits of all the <HI>Degrees</HI> of Quantity; there
are between sound <HI>undreaming Sleep</HI> and per∣fect
healthy <HI>Wakeing,</HI> all the Degrees and
Terms that are between a given Quantity and
Nothing; and accordingly, <HI>Labour, Fatigue,
light</HI> Food, gentle <HI>Evacuations</HI> of all kinds, will
procure, in some Degree, <HI>undreaming Sleep;</HI>
and the more rank, high and poignant the
<HI>Aliment,</HI> the more painful and terrifying will
be our <HI>Dreams;</HI> as on the other hand, the
more mild, soft and light our <HI>Food</HI> is, the
more pleasant and gentle will be our <HI>Dreams,</HI>
if otherwise healthy. And <HI>old</HI> Persons, <HI>weak</HI>
and <HI>sickly Constitutions,</HI> and People under
<HI>acute</HI> or <HI>chronical Distempers,</HI> especially
those that are call'd <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Cephalic,</HI>
have the wildest, most inconsistent and painful
<HI>Dreams,</HI> and the most imperfect <HI>Sleep,</HI> and
sometimes no <HI>Sleep</HI> at all, which is one of
their greatest Miseries. And I should <HI>philoso∣phically</HI>
define <HI>Sleep,</HI> a <HI>Disability</HI> or <HI>Incapa∣city</HI>
of the material <HI>Organs,</HI> from Exinani∣tion,
<PB N="40" REF="57"/>
Use and Expence, to continue easily
much longer the <HI>intellectual Functions</HI> and
<HI>voluntary Motions,</HI> without a new Repair and
winding up, in the same Manner as <HI>Hunger</HI> is
caus'd; and <HI>Dreaming</HI> to be only partial and
imperfect Wakeing, by a perpetual <HI>Irrita∣tion</HI>
from <HI>Flatulence</HI> and obstructed <HI>Perspi∣ration,</HI>
on the internal <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Mem∣branes,</HI>
or from Pain; and <HI>Wakeing</HI> to be the
perfect and pleasant <HI>Pliancy</HI> of the <HI>intellectual</HI>
and <HI>animal Organs,</HI> to obey the <HI>Impulse</HI> of
the <HI>self-motive, self-active Spirit;</HI> and that
in this <HI>immaterial Agent</HI> there is a lower, and
more ordinary and weaker <HI>Effect</HI> and <HI>Energy,</HI>
(or a contractile and expansive <HI>Energy</HI>) by
which the <HI>animal Functions</HI> are perpetuated
without Interruption; and a <HI>higher</HI> and more
intense and voluntary Degree of <HI>Agency,</HI> by
which <HI>Wakeing</HI> and the intellectual Operations
are perform'd; and it is <HI>this</HI> that in <HI>sound
Sleep,</HI> and in a <HI>Deliquium,</HI> is suspended, and
in <HI>Death</HI> both, without a new Vehicle.</P>
<P>35. As to <HI>Longings, Likeings, unnatural
Appetites,</HI> Specialities, <HI>Sympathies</HI> and <HI>Anti∣pathies</HI>
in Foods, Persons or Things, in <HI>breed∣ing
Women,</HI> in <HI>Children, weakly Constitu∣tions,</HI>
or <HI>old Persons,</HI> and their uncommon
seeming <HI>supernatural</HI> and <HI>equivocal</HI> Appear∣ances
and Effects, I take them to proceed from
<HI>Accidents, morbid Humours,</HI> particular Dis∣eases,
an ill or weak State of the <HI>Fluids</HI> and
<HI>Solids,</HI> a particular Distemperature of some
<PB N="41" REF="58"/>
<HI>glandular Secretions,</HI> particular Usages in com∣mon
Life, an improper Culture and Education
in Youth, or a <HI>Mal-formation</HI> of the <HI>mate∣rial
Organs</HI> of the <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties; and
so to be no Exception against <HI>general Laws</HI>
and Rules, or that of the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI>
in particular; no more than a <HI>double Apple</HI> or
<HI>Nut</HI> from the same Stalk, or any <HI>monstrous</HI> vege∣table
or <HI>animal</HI> Production or Birth, is a solid
Objection against the general Laws of <HI>Vegetation</HI>
and <HI>Generation;</HI> or no more than the <HI>Dreams</HI>
of a sick or <HI>nervose</HI> Person, are against the
Rules of common Sense; the natural and ne∣cessary
Imperfection and <HI>Unpreciseness</HI> of gross
Matter, of the <HI>Element</HI> we live in, and the
Fluids and Solids that surround us, makeing this
Interruption and Deviation from <HI>Precision</HI> and
the <HI>general Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> necessary and una∣voidable;
perhaps they may be some of the <HI>Means</HI>
and <HI>Instruments</HI> of <HI>God's moral Government</HI>
of his World, wisely appointed by Him, and
under his <HI>immediate</HI> Direction, to hurt the
natural <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Soul the least possible.
And I know not, if the Opinion of some may
not be very solid and just, that in this <HI>laps'd</HI>
and <HI>probatory</HI> State of our <HI>System,</HI> the infi∣nitely
wise <HI>Author</HI> of Nature may have on
purpose left a <HI>Darkness, Imperfection</HI> and
<HI>Deteriority</HI> on the Face of his Works, to
keep his <HI>rational Creatures</HI> in this their <HI>expia∣tory</HI>
State, <HI>humble, dependent,</HI> and confideing
on Him only, and so to prevent a second
<PB N="42" REF="59"/>
<HI>Lapse;</HI> as wise Princes make <HI>Gaols</HI> and <HI>Cor∣rection-houses</HI>
neither delightful nor commo∣dious,
on purpose to reclaim <HI>Felons. God</HI>
gave the <HI>Jews</HI> Laws (<HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>ceremonial</HI>
Law) that were not good and perfect. And
<HI>Cornaro</HI>'s (for Example) particular Appetite
for new Wines, and Aversion or Suffering
from old Wine, (which is certainly preferable,
and more salutary, by its having lost some of
its fiery, inflameing and <HI>deleterious</HI> Particles, and
from the more perfect Mixture and Maturity
of its Composition) was of this Nature; and
no Argument can be drawn from it against the
general Rule of the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least.</HI></P>
<P>36. <HI>MEDICINES</HI> act principally by
their most <HI>eminent</HI> and <HI>sensible Qualities;</HI> be∣ing
<HI>mix'd</HI> Bodies, that Property that is most
eminent in them, and those of the component
Particles of such a Nature that are most nu∣merous,
have the principal Effect, and are
most to be regarded in <HI>Medicine.</HI> I have al∣ready
observ'd, that it is the <HI>integral Par∣ticles</HI>
that are chiefly proper and useful both
in the Nourishment of <HI>animal</HI> Bodies, and in
the other <HI>animal Functions;</HI> they are indeed
broken and divided, and <HI>class</HI> themselves in
some degree afterwards in the capillary <HI>Arte∣ries,</HI>
in the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and in the <HI>Glands,</HI> for
the several Uses of Nature: But still, even in
these <HI>Secretions,</HI> they retain their chief and
<HI>eminent</HI> Qualities, as we often find by the
<PB N="43" REF="60"/>
<HI>Taste, Colour</HI> and <HI>Smell</HI> of the <HI>Secretions.</HI>
For we are so constituted, that the minutest
and least Particles of the Composition of Bo∣dies
would be absolutely unfit to carry on the
<HI>animal Functions</HI> and were our Food to be
divided into such <HI>Particles,</HI> they would, from
their Smallness and consequent greater degree
of <HI>Attraction,</HI> run into <HI>Combinations</HI> and
<HI>Clusters,</HI> and form <HI>Obstructions;</HI> or at least
would not <HI>assimilate</HI> with the Fluids that cir∣culate
in <HI>animal</HI> Bodies: And therefore <HI>Nu∣trition</HI>
is better perform'd by the <HI>integral</HI> Par∣ticles
of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> that are
<HI>soft, porous,</HI> and <HI>abound</HI> most with <HI>Water, Air</HI>
and <HI>Earth.</HI> And <HI>Physic</HI> and the <HI>Materia
Medica</HI> being but an unnatural and temporary
kind of Food, ought to be chosen of the same
<HI>analogous</HI> Form and Nature; for <HI>Medicines</HI>
will always <HI>act</HI> by their <HI>integral</HI> Particles, and
their most <HI>eminent</HI> Qualities only, the rest be∣ing
mostly lost, or of little <HI>Efficacy</HI> in their
Operations. For <HI>Minuteness</HI> and <HI>Precision</HI> in
our <HI>material</HI> or <HI>spiritual</HI> Operations, has little
Use in our present Circumstances, <HI>medio∣criter
&amp; quam proximè;</HI> and a <HI>Nisus</HI> being all
that is attainable by a finite Creature: The
<HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum</HI> are never to be as∣certain'd
in <HI>bodily</HI> or <HI>spiritual</HI> Operations in
our present State, but only in abstracted Specula∣tions;
for this will be sufficient for <HI>Health</HI>
and <HI>Serenity,</HI> and all Intentions in our present
Condition. All <HI>chymical</HI> Medicines, all <HI>Spi∣rits,
<PB N="44" REF="61"/>
Salts, Oils,</HI> every thing that has pass'd
through the <HI>Tortures</HI> of the <HI>Fire,</HI> is so ignited,
and the <HI>Matter</HI> and active <HI>Particles</HI> of <HI>Light</HI>
or <HI>Fire</HI> are so <HI>transubstantiated</HI> into it, that it
is ever afterwards unfit to be admitted in∣to
an <HI>animal</HI> Body, except as a <HI>Caustic</HI> is, to
bring on present Pain; and its Fire is more
hurtful, when taken as an <HI>Alterative,</HI> than its
<HI>Substance</HI> can do Good, be that what it will.
We see wise Nature furnishes no Matter of
<HI>Food</HI> or <HI>Physic,</HI> that has pass'd any higher De∣gree
of Heat, than <HI>Incubation, Vegetation, In∣fusion,
Maceration, Digestion,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>37. SINCE then all <HI>medical</HI> Effects on <HI>ani∣mal</HI>
Bodies are perform'd chiefly by <HI>integral</HI>
Particles, and their most <HI>eminent</HI> Qualities, it
will follow, that <HI>Mercury</HI> (for Example) will
ever act chiefly by the greater <HI>Gravity, Ro∣tundity,</HI>
and <HI>attractive</HI> Virtue of its <HI>Particles;
Salts,</HI> by their pointed <HI>Stimulus,</HI> strong <HI>at∣tractive</HI>
Power and Solidity; <HI>Water,</HI> by its
<HI>Moisture, Dilution,</HI> its want of <HI>Elasticity,</HI>
and its <HI>Thinness,</HI> which makes it fit to convey
solid <HI>integral</HI> Particles of equal <HI>Gravity</HI> with
itself, through <HI>animal Tubes; Sulphurs,</HI> by
their <HI>fiery</HI> Particles and Heat, and, if <HI>oily,</HI> by
cementing and uniting <HI>earthy</HI> Particles; <HI>Earth,</HI>
by giving a <HI>Solidity</HI> and <HI>Firmness,</HI> by imbibe∣ing
<HI>Moisture,</HI> and filling <HI>Chasms</HI> and <HI>Vacui∣ties;
Bark,</HI> by its vegetable <HI>Stypticity;</HI> and
<HI>Steel,</HI> by its greater <HI>mineral Astringency;
<PB N="45" REF="62"/>
Oils,</HI> by their <HI>Lubricity</HI> and <HI>Relaxation; Spi∣rits,</HI>
by their <HI>Inflammation</HI> and over-heating,
carrying in them the material Substance of
actual <HI>Fire.</HI> And the same Effect that Medi∣cines
have on the <HI>Mouth</HI> and <HI>Palate,</HI> they
will also have in a greater Degree on the whole
<HI>alimentary Tube,</HI> whose Nature is much the
same from its <HI>Orifice</HI> through its whole <HI>Con∣tinuity,</HI>
only in some Places more <HI>sensible</HI> and
<HI>delicate.</HI> And one of the best and most effec∣tual
<HI>Trials</HI> of the <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of Me∣dicines,
in some general Degree, is <HI>deliberate∣ly</HI>
and often to examine them in small Trials
by <HI>Taste, Smell,</HI> and their Effects on the <HI>Senses;</HI>
which kind of Experiment would seem the
most useful and necessary for the <HI>gross</HI> of Man∣kind,
in things relating both to <HI>Food</HI> and
<HI>Physic.</HI></P>
<P>38. <HI>EXPERIMENT</HI> and <HI>Observa∣tion</HI>
are of great Use in the <HI>Practice of Phy∣sic,</HI>
and absolutely necessary to the Cure of the
actual, <HI>now</HI> common Distempers, not to be
prevented, but <HI>remedy'd.</HI> But surely there must
be a more general and more compendious Me∣thod
intended by the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> for
the generality of Mankind; else the <HI>Means</HI> of
Health could only be perfected with the <HI>End
of the World;</HI> and each <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Climat</HI>
which has little Communication with the rest
of the World, must work it out by their own
Means: and yet <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Serenity</HI> seem so
<PB N="46" REF="63"/>
necessary to every End and Purpose that an
<HI>infinitely wise Being</HI> could have, in sending
us here, that we may conclude they have some
more <HI>simple</HI> and obvious Guard. Scarce one
<HI>Individual</HI> is made entirely the same with an∣other;
there is in every one a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>In∣dividuation;</HI>
the <HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>Climat,</HI> the
<HI>Age,</HI> the <HI>Food,</HI> the <HI>Usages</HI> of Life, vary the
Constitutions and <HI>Diseases</HI> of Men <HI>in infini∣tum;</HI>
the several Stages, Degrees and different
<HI>Symptoms</HI> of Diseases distinguish them. Few
Persons are qualify'd for making <HI>useful Obser∣vations</HI>
in <HI>Physic;</HI> to this end a Man must be
well acquainted with <HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> the
<HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI>
have a <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>penetrating Sagacity,</HI> to
be able to distinguish <HI>Occasions, Coincidents</HI>
and <HI>Circumstances</HI> from <HI>Causes,</HI> and <HI>Acci∣dents</HI>
from <HI>Effects:</HI> All these, and a great
many more <HI>Qualifications,</HI> are requir'd in those
who would make <HI>useful</HI> and <HI>decisive</HI> Observa∣tions;
and how few such there are, I leave the
World to judge: Few but such as a <HI>Bacon,
Boyle</HI> and <HI>Newton.</HI> And yet we must not think
the beneficent <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> has left Men
to <HI>Chance, Casualty</HI> or <HI>blind Fate,</HI> in the
Conduct of their <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Health.</HI> There
are in <HI>Physic,</HI> as in the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral
World, general Laws, universal Propositions,</HI>
and a perpetual <HI>Analogy,</HI> that runs through the
whole of the <HI>Science</HI> for that End. Keep the
Blood <HI>cool, fluid</HI> and <HI>balmy,</HI> use due <HI>Exercise,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="64"/>
proper <HI>Air,</HI> and a <HI>Regimen</HI> of the <HI>lightest</HI> and
the <HI>least,</HI> and keep all the <HI>Non-naturals</HI> re∣gular
and guarded to preserve <HI>Life, Health</HI>
and <HI>Serenity;</HI> use proper <HI>Evacuations</HI> of all
the fit kinds in Distempers, and <HI>specific</HI> Alte∣ratives,
to dispose the morbid Matter for Eli∣mination,
under a <HI>Regimen</HI> of <HI>Diet</HI> directed
by the Nature of the Distemper; and nicely
observe how wise Nature cures a particular
Distemper, when a Cure happens; and endea∣vour
as near as possible to imitate her Means
and Medicines, if she happen to use any.
These, or such-like <HI>general Laws,</HI> indicated
by <HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> and the Knowledge of
the <HI>animal Oeconomy</HI> and <HI>Materia Medica,</HI>
under well-guarded and exactly made <HI>Obser∣vations</HI>
for one's own Use, will best serve the
End of Health, especially when every one,

<P>39. DR. <HI>Bryan Robinson,</HI> in the last Section
of his <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> has contriv'd a Me∣thod
to determin, by <HI>Experiment,</HI> the Force
of the several Liquors used either for <HI>Food</HI> or
<HI>Physic</HI> on the <HI>animal</HI> Solids, which might
give <HI>Light</HI> to the Practice of <HI>Physic;</HI> his Con∣clusions
being just and luciferous, as far as the
imperfect Nature of <HI>gross Matter</HI> and <HI>Me∣chanism,</HI>
and the <HI>unprecise</HI> State of the <HI>ani∣mal
Oeconomy</HI> thereon depending, admit; to
which one might add, for Caution, these fol∣lowing
<PB N="48" REF="65"/>
Considerations; 1. The Foods, <HI>i. e.</HI>
Meats and Drinks, that brace and increase the
<HI>Spring</HI> of the <HI>Fibres,</HI> may possibly <HI>equally</HI>
thicken and incrassat the <HI>circulating Fluids;</HI>
so that the Benefit deriv'd on the Solids may
be sometimes lost on the denser Fluids, the
<HI>Resistance</HI> in the Fluids being increas'd in <HI>Pro∣portion,</HI>
as the Force and Spring of the Fibres
is strengthen'd; as we see in the Effects of
<HI>Wine,</HI> strong fermented <HI>Liquors</HI> and <HI>Spirits;</HI>
which, though they at first undeniably strength∣en
and increase the <HI>Spring</HI> of the <HI>Solids,</HI> yet
by incrassating the <HI>Fluids,</HI> and increasing their
Resistance, and likewise by alternately <HI>bracing</HI>
and <HI>relaxing</HI> the <HI>Fibres</HI> themselves, must at
last weaken and destroy their <HI>Tone,</HI> and so
render them unfit to carry on the <HI>animal
Functions.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Dr.</HI> Hales's Vegetable Staticks, Vol. II.</NOTE>. 2. May there not be an <HI>original
innate</HI> Degree of <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> com∣municated
to the <HI>linear Solids</HI> at their first
<HI>Creation;</HI> which, when they are <HI>develop'd</HI>
and drawn out to their utmost <HI>Extension,</HI> and
settled therein, can scarce ever be much aug∣mented
or increas'd, by all that Nutrition or
Art can do, though they may be readily clogg'd
and so weaken'd—If <HI>Elasticity</HI> consists in
the Degree of <HI>Attraction</HI> of the primary
or of the <HI>minutest</HI> Particles, which may be
very great when they are at an <HI>infinitely</HI>
small Distance from one another; and so make
<PB N="49" REF="66"/>
them unite again with <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Velocity;</HI>
but is none at all at a <HI>finite</HI> Distance, or when
they are the least without the <HI>Sphere</HI> of one
another's <HI>Attraction;</HI> then the <HI>native, simple</HI>
and true <HI>Elasticity</HI> of Fibres will consist prin∣cipally
in a <HI>String, Chain</HI> or <HI>Line</HI> of such <HI>Par∣ticles</HI>
only; and the more these <HI>Particles</HI> are
clogg'd, patch'd or interrupted by <HI>foreign Mat∣ter,</HI>
the more <HI>clumsy</HI> and <HI>unspringy</HI> will this
Line become; and the cleaner and more simple
they are, the greater will be its Elasticity: so
that the great End and Purpose of <HI>Physic,</HI> is
only to remove <HI>Impediments</HI> and <HI>Incum∣brances</HI>
from original <HI>Elasticity</HI> and Health.
The <HI>Patch</HI> and <HI>gross Case</HI> superinduc'd upon the
<HI>linear Solids</HI> afterwards, seems only intended to
defend their <HI>Delicacy,</HI> and enable them to bear
the <HI>crass Element</HI> they are intended for: And
accordingly, young tender <HI>Twigs</HI> are most
elastic; young <HI>Animals,</HI> after a certain Age, are
most <HI>agile;</HI> after too long Sleep Men are more
<HI>lazy,</HI> after a <HI>Debauch</HI> quite heavy; and the
<HI>smallest Fibres</HI> have the quickest and most de∣licate
<HI>Spring;</HI> and the <HI>elastic</HI> Force of Springs
is in Proportion to the <HI>Power</HI> by which they
are <HI>compress'd. Musical Springs,</HI> the finer
they are, the quicker and sharper are their <HI>Vi∣brations</HI>
and Notes, and the <HI>Base</HI> is the grossest
and most obtuse of all. It would seem there∣fore,
that the <HI>quickest</HI> and most <HI>active Spring</HI>
is in the <HI>linear</HI> Union or smallest <HI>Fibrils</HI>
made of these Particles; and that when
<PB N="50" REF="67"/>
many such <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Fibres</HI> are united, the
<HI>Energy</HI> or <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the Spring is lessen'd,
(though their Strength is increas'd) from the
unprecise and gross Nature of Matter and Me∣chanism,
and a Multitude of different <HI>At∣tractions;</HI>
for the <HI>Particles,</HI> of which Bo∣dies
are compos'd, cannot be so put toge∣ther
or united, as perfectly to agree in an <HI>Uni∣son</HI>
or any <HI>harmonious Proportion.</HI></P>
<P>40. I CONJECTURE the Matter to stand
thus: The <HI>Author of Nature</HI> originally intend∣ed
that the Mechanism and Condition, and
particularly the <HI>original Spring</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI>
of the <HI>Fibres</HI> of all human Bodies, should be
much the same as they were in the first <HI>original
Pair</HI> from whence they were deriv'd. Before
the <HI>Lapse</HI> was compleated, and had its full Ef∣fect,
the <HI>final End</HI> of such a radical Deriva∣tion,
was that the <HI>Posterity</HI> might have all the
Benefit and Advantage of the <HI>Experience, Cul∣ture</HI>
and <HI>partial Restoration</HI> of the <HI>Parents:</HI>
But in all <HI>free</HI> Beings, the <HI>Regress</HI> must of
Necessity be as <HI>damnifying</HI> as the <HI>Progress</HI>
would have been <HI>beneficial.</HI> When the <HI>Po∣sterity</HI>
of the first <HI>Pair</HI> came to multiply, <HI>some</HI>
of the very first, by the <HI>Abuse</HI> of their <HI>Li∣berty,</HI>
deprav'd and vitiated both their <HI>spiri∣tual</HI>
Nature, and their <HI>bodily</HI> Machins, to a
much greater Degree than <HI>others; some</HI> the
<HI>first</HI> most, others the <HI>latter;</HI> and <HI>infinite Wis∣dom</HI>
acting ever by <HI>general Laws,</HI> both in the
<PB N="51" REF="68"/>
<HI>material, moral</HI> and <HI>spiritual Worlds,</HI> and in∣tending
to recover and restore his <HI>lapsed</HI> Crea∣tures
to <HI>Order,</HI> by all the <HI>Energy</HI> of his infi∣nite
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> consistent with their
<HI>original Powers</HI> and these <HI>general Laws,</HI> the
Differences of these <HI>Tribes, Orders, Nations</HI>
and <HI>Peoples</HI> (from their <HI>special</HI> Corruptions,
and from <HI>Sun, Soil</HI> and <HI>Culture</HI>) that now
exist, became what we now see them, and no
doubt are, with <HI>infinite</HI> Wisdom, fitted for
this general End of <HI>universal Restoration,</HI> and
the Recovery of each <HI>Individual,</HI> who con∣tinuing
averse to <HI>Order,</HI> may retard their <HI>Re∣storation</HI>
beyond any <HI>given</HI> Time.</P>
<P>41. THE <HI>Conduct</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> is surprizingly
beautiful, in preparing that <HI>viscous Water,</HI> which
is the <HI>Instrument, Mother</HI> and <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Vege∣tation</HI>
and Growth in <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> to
fit them to be Food for <HI>Animals.</HI> The proper
Seat and Treasure-house of this Element is the
<HI>Ocean,</HI> spread over at least one half, if not
more, of this our <HI>Terraqueous Globe;</HI> which
<HI>Water</HI> washing away, and continually dissolv∣ing
the smallest and finest Particles of the
<HI>Mountains</HI> and <HI>Rocks</HI> of <HI>Salt</HI> in its Bosom,
becomes impregnated and saturated therewith,
and so turns to a <HI>Brine.</HI> And this Salt thus dis∣solv'd,
by its <HI>pointed Figure,</HI> and by the con∣stant
<HI>Flux</HI> and <HI>Reflux</HI> of this heavy <HI>Volum</HI> of
<HI>Water</HI> produc'd by the <HI>Attraction</HI> of the
Moon, is not only kept from <HI>coalescing</HI> and
<PB N="52" REF="69"/>
<HI>crystallising,</HI> and so from falling again to the
<HI>Bottom,</HI> but likewise preserves the <HI>Sea</HI> from
<HI>Stagnation</HI> and <HI>Putrefaction.</HI> This large <HI>Sur∣face</HI>
of <HI>Water,</HI> constantly expos'd to the <HI>Heat</HI>
and <HI>Action</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> by its <HI>rarefying</HI> and
<HI>attractive</HI> Virtue, (as it were by a gentle na∣tural
<HI>Alembic</HI>) is drawn up constantly in a <HI>fine
Vapour</HI> into the <HI>Atmosphere;</HI> and having a
weaker more diluted <HI>Oil</HI> in its Texture, from
the <HI>sulphurous</HI> Beds, and <HI>dead Fishes</HI> in it, re∣tains
by this <HI>sulphurous</HI> Mixture, some Par∣ticles
of the <HI>Sun's Heat</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> in its Com∣position,
which preserves it from <HI>freezing</HI> and
<HI>vitrifying</HI> into <HI>Ice.</HI> This <HI>briny Water,</HI> I say,
thus impregnated with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Oil,</HI> and some
of the <HI>Solar</HI> Rays and <HI>Particles</HI> of <HI>Fire,</HI> is
toss'd up and down the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> by <HI>Winds,</HI>
and is thereby also impregnated near the Sur∣face
of the Earth with more <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI>
and the permanent Particles of <HI>Air,</HI> and with
the <HI>Steams</HI> and <HI>Exhalations</HI> of <HI>Sulphurs, Me∣tals</HI>
and <HI>Minerals,</HI> that by the greater <HI>Heat</HI>
of the <HI>Sun</HI> (being heavy and gross) cannot be
so readily drawn up into the <HI>superior Re∣gions;</HI>
and thus impregnated with <HI>four</HI> of
the <HI>Elements,</HI> and become, as it were, a
<HI>Menstruum</HI> by these <HI>Mixtures,</HI> it is precipi∣tated
by the <HI>Cold</HI> of the Night Seasons towards
the Surface of the <HI>Earth,</HI> where attracting
those finer terrestrial Particles it meets with in
its Way, it passes on to the gapeing Mouths of
the Roots of <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and thus
<PB N="53" REF="70"/>
gradually impregnated with more and more of
the finer Particles of all the <HI>five Elements,</HI> in
a greater or less Proportion to its intended
<HI>final</HI> Uses, by the innate <HI>attractive</HI> Principle
in the <HI>Tubes</HI> of the <HI>Roots,</HI> and the Action of
the <HI>Sun</HI> in the several <HI>Climats, Seasons</HI> and
<HI>Soils,</HI> and the alternate Succussions from dif∣ferent
Seasons, and the various Changes of
the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> it is both fitted for the <HI>Ali∣ment,</HI>
and also forc'd up the <HI>Tubes</HI> of the
<HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and thus it develops,
extends and incrassates the <HI>linear Fibres</HI> of
Seeds, (that is, the <HI>miniature Plants</HI>) till they
thus become naturally prepar'd, <HI>vivifying</HI> and
<HI>fertilising</HI> Food for <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Beast.</HI> These
gapeing Orifices of the Roots of <HI>miniature
Plants,</HI> will <HI>attract,</HI> receive and be nourish'd
by any Matter for a time, that is nearest them;
but this is the general Conduct of <HI>Nature,</HI> for
the common and best Nourishment and Accre∣tion
of <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> to become the
best and fittest Food or Medicine for Man and
Beast.</P>
<P>42. IF the <HI>Elasticity</HI> of <HI>animal Fibres</HI> con∣sists
in the Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and the <HI>Plain∣ness</HI>
of the <HI>Surfaces</HI> of their <HI>constituent Par∣ticles,</HI>
as seems highly probable; which <HI>Par∣ticles</HI>
being separated by Force to a Distance
within the <HI>Sphere</HI> of their <HI>Attraction</HI> only,
are, by their <HI>attractive</HI> Virtue, united toge∣ther
again with a <HI>Momentum</HI> compounded of
<PB N="54" REF="71"/>
their Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and the Quantity
of their <HI>touching plain Surfaces;</HI> then may
all the Solid of an <HI>animal</HI> Body be consider'd
collectively as a <HI>Bundle</HI> of <HI>Twists,</HI> originally
fram'd, weaven and shap'd into the Forms and
Figures, which <HI>Anatomists</HI> find in a Human or
other Animal Body; far above the Power of
the present known Laws of <HI>Motion</HI> and <HI>Me∣chanism</HI>
to execute, or the Limits of finite Un∣derstandings
to plan or conceive.</P>
<P>43. IN the Memoirs of the <HI>Royal Academy</HI>
for the Year 1730, Mr. <HI>Geoffroy</HI> has given a
Method for determining the <HI>Proportion of
Nourishment,</HI> or true Matter of the Flesh and
Blood, contain'd in any sort of Food. He
took a <HI>Pound</HI> of Meat, that had been freed
from the <HI>Fat, Bones</HI> and <HI>Cartilages,</HI> and boil'd
it for a determin'd Time in a close Vessel with
three Pints of Water; then pouring off the
Liquor, he added the same Quantity of Water,
boiling it again for the same Time; and this
Operation he repeated six several times, so
that the last Liquor appear'd both in Smell,
Trial and Taste, to be little different from com∣mon
Water. Then putting all the Liquor to∣gether,
and filtrating, to separate the too gross
Particles, he evaporated it over a slow Fire, till
it was brought to an <HI>Extract</HI> of a pretty mo∣derat
Consistence.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="72"/>
THIS Experiment was made upon several

<P>FROM the foregoing decideing <HI>Experiments,</HI>
it is evident, that <HI>white, young, tender animal</HI>
Food, <HI>Bread, Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> are the
best and most effectual Substances for <HI>Nutri∣tion,
Accretion</HI> and <HI>sweetening</HI> bad Juices.
They may not give so strong and dureable <HI>me∣chanical
Force,</HI> because being easily and readily
digestible, and quickly passing all the <HI>animal</HI>
Functions, so as to turn into good Blood and
muscular Flesh, they are more <HI>transitory, fu∣gitive</HI>
and of <HI>prompt Secretion:</HI> yet they will
perform all the animal Functions more readily
and pleasantly, with fewer <HI>Resistances</HI> and <HI>less

among us good <HI>freethinking Pro∣testants</HI>
of <HI>England, Abstinence, Temperance</HI>

Respiration, Perspiration</HI> and the <HI>Secretions.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>FOOD</HI> (that is <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink</HI>) was
design'd only to supply the Expences of <HI>Action</HI>
and <HI>Living,</HI> or the Expences of those natural
<HI>Functions</HI> now mention'd; that is, to repair
the necessary Loss caus'd by the Action of the
<HI>Fluids</HI> that surround us, or the internal <HI>Action</HI>
of those within us, while they are performing
these <HI>Functions.</HI> Before our Bodies arrive at
perfect <HI>Maturity,</HI> and while our <HI>Solids</HI> and
<PB N="59" REF="76"/>
<HI>Organs</HI> are tending to their utmost <HI>Exten∣sion,</HI>
this Supply may be more than the men∣tion'd
Expence, <HI>viz.</HI> what is necessary to
<HI>stretch, extend</HI> and <HI>plump</HI> up these <HI>Solids</HI> and
<HI>Organs:</HI> But after that, when come to <HI>Ma∣turity,</HI>
it needs only to be <HI>equal,</HI> if we desire to
continue under the <HI>Order</HI> and Design of <HI>Na∣ture.</HI></P>
<P>4. FOR the pleasant and regular Perfor∣mance
of these <HI>Functions,</HI> it is necessary in
the Order of <HI>Nature,</HI> not only that the whole
<HI>System</HI> of <HI>Tubes</HI> be full of a warm, soft, bal∣samic
Fluid, to maintain them in their due
<HI>Extension</HI> and <HI>Elasticity;</HI> but that the inter∣nal
and external <HI>Surfaces</HI> of the <HI>Solids</HI> be
moisten'd and lubricated, to keep them pliant
and <HI>flexible,</HI> (which seems to be one great
Design of <HI>Food</HI>) and likewise to preserve them
from the Friction of the internal and external
surrounding Fluids, and their Friction on one
another; and this must be secreted from the
same <HI>Mass</HI> of Fluids in the <HI>Tubes.</HI></P>
<P>5. <HI>HUNGER</HI> is a Sense of Pain, arising
from the partial <HI>Exinanition,</HI> or emptying of
these <HI>Tubes,</HI> by the Expences of <HI>Action</HI> or
<HI>Living,</HI> or by the continued Performance of
these necessary <HI>Functions;</HI> whereby the <HI>Tubes</HI>
are in some measure emptied, and a sufficient
Quantity not flowing into the <HI>Capillaries,</HI> and
the <HI>perspiratory</HI> and <HI>emunctory Glands,</HI> of
<PB N="60" REF="77"/>
which they are form'd, that <HI>balmy Film</HI> or
<HI>Cuticule</HI> which defends the most sensible <HI>Fi∣bres,
viz.</HI> the <HI>Sides</HI> and <HI>Orifices</HI> of the <HI>secre∣tory</HI>
Vessels, and the Sides and Coats of the
<HI>Nerves,</HI> that of the <HI>Stomach</HI> especially, (which
is nothing but a Bag compos'd of such <HI>Nerves</HI>
and <HI>secretory Glands</HI>) is gradually worn off;
and a sharp, uneasy <HI>Sensation, Languor</HI> and
<HI>Debility,</HI> is thereby produc'd and felt over the
whole Solids of the Body, (but especially in
the <HI>Stomach</HI>) till a sufficient Quantity of this
<HI>balmy Fluid</HI> be supplied again, to sheath and
defend these sensible <HI>Fibres</HI> from being scrap'd
and worn. But if this <HI>milky</HI> Substance be
long and obstinately denied, the <HI>Pain</HI> becomes
so intolerable, that no kind of Torture can
equal it.</P>
<P>6. FROM hence it seems to me pretty
evident, that <HI>Temperance,</HI> or, if you please,
<HI>Abstinence,</HI> (contrary to the Nature of some
other of the Virtues) seldom admits but of one
<HI>Extreme, viz.</HI> the <HI>too-much,</HI> or <HI>too-high</HI> in
Food: For upon any Attempt being made up∣on
the <HI>too-little,</HI> habitually and for a Conti∣nuance,
the <HI>Pain</HI> becomes so intolerable, that
no Person at <HI>Liberty,</HI> and in his <HI>Senses,</HI> and
having proper Materials for Food in his Power,
can possibly bear it: As is well known to those
who have seen, or read of, the Effects of <HI>Fa∣mine,</HI>
or starving in <HI>Prisons,</HI> long <HI>Sea-Voy∣ages,</HI>
or <HI>Desarts;</HI> which is described by all
<PB N="61" REF="78"/>
to be a Torture equal to that of being burnt
alive by a <HI>slow Fire,</HI> or greater, if possible.</P>
<P>7. IF this Representation be just, it will be
evident, that for <HI>Health, long Life</HI> and <HI>Sere∣nity,</HI>
the surest and most effectual Mean is a
constant Endeavour and steady Practice of take∣ing
down the least we can be easy under, or
are equally agile, and capable of intellectual
Exercises after, or a Trial to reach the <HI>too-little,</HI>
if possible. This I take to be the
shortest, safest, and most effectual <HI>Rule,</HI> a wise
Man can go by. In bodily <HI>Wisdom,</HI> it is the
<HI>one Thing necessary;</HI> all other Means are but
Trifles in respect of this; and this alone is
sufficient to keep a Man free from great or ha∣bitual
<HI>Distempers, Lowness,</HI> and the Infirmi∣ties
of <HI>Age;</HI> and to procure him a <HI>Dissolu∣tion</HI>
without violent Pain, as far as the Laws of
Mortality, and the Designs of his Maker over
him, will permit; for all Men are not made
for one and the same End and Purpose, in the
Designs of Providence, or <HI>God's</HI> moral Govern∣ment
of his Creatures.</P>
<P>8. HENCE it will be evident, with how
little Reason the guarded, the complaisant and
the cautious Dealers in <HI>Physic, perplex, puzzle</HI>
and <HI>terrify</HI> those, who by a low abstemious
<HI>Regimen,</HI> are endeavouring to conquer their
<HI>bodily Distempers</HI> or <HI>spiritual Vices, viz.</HI> by
<HI>thundering</HI> over them, or <HI>sneering</HI> at them,
<PB N="62" REF="79"/>
that they are <HI>ruining</HI> their Constitutions, <HI>spoil∣ing</HI>
their Blood and Juices, <HI>creating</HI> Distem∣pers,
and <HI>shortening</HI> their Days, by this their
<HI>whimsical, wrong-headed</HI> and unnatural <HI>Abs∣tinence.</HI>
But surely such have little studied
Nature, and the <HI>animal Oeconomy;</HI> for it is as
impossible that a <HI>free,</HI> sensible Person, under
<HI>Plenty,</HI> should be long able obstinately to con∣tinue
under the <HI>too-little,</HI> as it would be for
him to stop the <HI>Sun</HI> in his Course. If there
be Instances or Records of any such, they have
been <HI>wrong-headed</HI> indeed, or <HI>lunatic,</HI> or un∣der
the Influence of some unnatural <HI>Passion,</HI>
which is the same Thing: And <HI>Self-murder</HI>
may with, as much Propriety, be instanced
against the innate Principle of <HI>Self-preserva∣tion,</HI>
as this is insinuated against <HI>Abstinence</HI>
and Moderation in Diet; for such as I have
now mention'd is the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and
the <HI>Exceptions</HI> must be unnatural and <HI>mon∣strous.</HI>
I have often tried, for a few Days, to
approach the <HI>too-little,</HI> for the Cure of <HI>Low∣ness,
Oppression</HI> and <HI>Watchfulness;</HI> but never
could carry it above <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Days, (when
otherwise free from a form'd <HI>Distemper</HI>) after
which my <HI>Symptoms</HI> were lessen'd, and <HI>Hun∣ger</HI>
became then my greatest <HI>Disease.</HI></P>
<P>9. ONE constant <HI>Symptom</HI> of a beginning
Distemper, of what Denomination soever, is
at least some Degree of <HI>Inappetence, Nausea,
Loathing</HI> or Heaviness after a full Meal, or an
<PB N="63" REF="80"/>
Aversion to strong animal Food; the Cause of
which, as far as I can conceive, is a <HI>Labour,</HI>
Struggle, or Difficulty, in the Performance of
the mention'd <HI>animal Functions;</HI> for the <HI>Cure</HI>
and Relief of which (whatever else is advis'd)
all honest and experienc'd <HI>Physicians, Ancient</HI>
or <HI>Modern,</HI> advise an appropriated low Diet or
<HI>Regimen.</HI> The <HI>Solution</HI> and <HI>Cure</HI> of all Dis∣tempers
by Nature, when solely left to her
wise Conduct, is by this <HI>Inappetence, Loath∣ing,</HI>
or <HI>Abstinence,</HI> at first; and then by some
one Evacuation or other, as <HI>Sweat, Stool,
Spitting, Coughing, Haemorrhage,</HI> or throw∣ing
the <HI>morbid</HI> Matter on some distant Limb
or Joint; which always happen after an inter∣mediate
<HI>Struggle</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> of the whole
<HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> to concoct the <HI>peccant Hu∣mours,</HI>
and fit them for <HI>Extermination.</HI> From
whence it will be plain, to those who will ob∣serve
and imitate <HI>Nature,</HI> that such Medicines
as help Nature to concoct and fit the <HI>peccant
Humours</HI> to be readily thrown off, with a
<HI>Regimen</HI> and proper <HI>Evacuations,</HI> are the
most material <HI>Indications</HI> in the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Dis∣tempers.</HI></P>
<P>10. <HI>MEDICINE</HI> has two Branches,
the <HI>Sanative</HI> and the <HI>Preservative:</HI> In the
<HI>Sanative,</HI> by the <HI>Viscidity, Acrimony</HI> or <HI>in∣flammatory</HI>
State of the Juices, the <HI>Inappe∣tency,</HI>
and the distemper'd <HI>Film</HI> or <HI>Cuticle,</HI>
that covers the internal and external Surfaces
<PB N="64" REF="81"/>
of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Organs</HI> describ'd, may be
such, that <HI>Nature's</HI> Laws, of Craveing and
Hunger, may be suspended for a while, till she
has thus prepar'd the <HI>morbid Juices</HI> for <HI>Eli∣mination,</HI>
by a <HI>Distemper</HI> and its <HI>Cure;</HI> and
then <HI>Medicine</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> must direct for
her, with what Food she is to be best main∣tain'd
and supported, till she be brought to her
natural State again: and the <HI>Regimen,</HI> in such
a Case, is allow'd by all <HI>Physicians,</HI> to be the
<HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least, viz.</HI> of the appropri∣ated
Food, for obviating and <HI>antidoting</HI> such
a particular Distemper. Here then there is no
Controversy, <HI>Diseases</HI> being an unnatural
State of an <HI>animal</HI> Body: 'Tis therefore of the
<HI>preservative</HI> Branch of Physic, that what is
here maintain'd is to be understood; about
which I affirm, the most infallible and univer∣sal
<HI>Mean</HI> of preserving <HI>Health, lengthening
Life,</HI> and preventing Diseases, is, constantly
to endeavour to take the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI>
Food (that is, Meat and Drink) a Man can be
tolerably easy under, equally agile, and fit for
intellectual Exercises after.</P>
<P>11. THE <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Physic</HI> may be consi∣der'd
in three very different Lights. There is the
<HI>Medicina Philosophica seu Rationalis,</HI> where∣of
true natural <HI>Philosophy</HI> is the Stem or Root,
and practical Medicine but a Branch. From
<HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> the <HI>Physicians</HI> must learn
the Structure and Uses of the several <HI>Organs</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="82"/>
of the <HI>animal</HI> Body, and the Laws of the <HI>ani∣mal
Oeconomy;</HI> and from the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and
Appearances on that Foundation, draw out his
<HI>Intentions</HI> in any given Case or Disease. From
the same <HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> he must make
himself acquainted with the <HI>Nature, Uses</HI> and
<HI>Virtues</HI> of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> or the Mate∣rials
commonly used in <HI>Medicine,</HI> and to the
<HI>first</HI> adjust this <HI>last,</HI> in order to <HI>antidote</HI> the
Causes of a given Distemper; and he who is
the best <HI>natural Philosopher</HI> will, <HI>caeteris pa∣ribus,</HI>
ever be the best <HI>Physician. Pharmacy</HI>
is of a lower Order, and like <HI>Cookery</HI> in Diet.
Then there is the <HI>Medicina Expectativa,</HI>
which consists in keeping up the <HI>Patient's</HI>
Hopes, Expectations and Spirits, till Nature
points out clearly the principal Causes and
great <HI>Symptoms</HI> in <HI>acute</HI> Diseases; and in <HI>chro∣nical</HI>
Cases, till <HI>Air, Exercise</HI> and <HI>Regimen</HI>
have taken Place. And this Branch of <HI>Physic,</HI>
in <HI>low</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Cases, and weak and <HI>wrong-headed</HI>
Patients, is absolutely necessary, to keep
them from Unconstancy and changing Hands;
and so, at least, is a necessary <HI>Art</HI> for a Phy∣sician,
towards those Patients who cannot di∣stinguish
between <HI>Surfaces</HI> and <HI>Solids.</HI> Many
a gross Glutton has been cured by a Ring of
Changes of <HI>Coral, Crabs-Eyes</HI> and <HI>Pearl,</HI> with
<HI>Asses Milk,</HI> to damp his <HI>voracious</HI> Appetite,
who could not have borne the word <HI>Absti∣nence.</HI>
And, lastly, there is the <HI>Medicina ad
Euthanasiam,</HI> which, when the Case is plainly
<PB N="66" REF="83"/>
and absolutely <HI>Mortal,</HI> lays the Patient down
in Death with the least Pain. But as this is
seldom a certain Case, in <HI>chronical</HI> Illnesses at
least, except in very tedious Diseases, and Pa∣tients
worn out by <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Distemper,</HI> it
ought to be practised only like <HI>Extreme Un∣ction.</HI>
These two last kinds of Knowledge in
Physic, though soon learn'd, as being readily
to be met with in every good Book of <HI>Phar∣macy</HI>
or <HI>Medicine,</HI> yet could never strike my
<HI>Fancy;</HI> I always sought after a solid and dura∣ble
<HI>Cure</HI> of Distempers; and was for striking
at the <HI>Root</HI> of the Weed, leaving the picking
of the <HI>Suckers</HI> and <HI>Leaves</HI> to others; though
in <HI>acute</HI> Cases, that often turn on small Things,
all Oars are to be plied, and every Art studied,
and even the most trifling Mean, conducive
to the End, attended with Diligence.</P>
<P>12. I HAVE a due Esteem for the <HI>Philo∣sophers</HI>
and <HI>wise Men</HI> both of <HI>Antiquity</HI> and
<HI>later</HI> Ages; those who have labour'd to cure
the Diseases of the <HI>Mind,</HI> and those who have
suggested effectual <HI>Means</HI> for the <HI>Cure</HI> or <HI>Re∣lief</HI>
of the Distempers of the Body; as well as for
those who have discover'd the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and
<HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Author of Na∣ture.</HI>
The <HI>Christian Philosophy,</HI> represented
in its true Light, is infinitely beyond any thing
that ever was thought of, or could possibly
enter into the Heart of Creatures to imagine,
for extirpating the <HI>Diseases</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> as
<PB N="67" REF="84"/>
is allow'd even by its <HI>Adversaries</HI> themselves:
For remedying the Distempers of the <HI>Body,</HI> to
make a Man live as long as his original <HI>Frame</HI>
was design'd to last, with the least <HI>Pain,</HI> few∣est
<HI>Diseases,</HI> or Loss of his Senses, I think
<HI>Pythagoras</HI> and <HI>Cornaro</HI> (for suggesting a ge∣neral
and effectual <HI>Mean</HI>) by far the two
greatest Men that ever were; the <HI>first,</HI> by <HI>ve∣getable</HI>
Food, and <HI>unfermented</HI> Liquors; the
<HI>latter,</HI> by the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> of <HI>animal
Food,</HI> and naturally fermented Liquors. Both
lived to a great <HI>Age:</HI> But what is chiefly to be
regarded in their Conduct and Example, both pre∣serv'd
their <HI>Senses, Chearfulness</HI> and <HI>Serenity,</HI> to
the last; and, which is still more to be regarded,
both, at least the last, <HI>dissolv'd</HI> without Pain
or Struggle; the first having lost his Life in a
Tumult, as is said by some, after a great Age
of perfect Health.</P>
<P>13. THE <HI>lowest Diet,</HI> or one of a <HI>Milk,
Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> seems only necessary
and appropriated to those, who by their <HI>own,</HI>
or by the <HI>Fault</HI> of their <HI>Parents,</HI> have ex∣tremely
vicious Juices, either <HI>too hot, too salt</HI>
or <HI>too viscous,</HI> and are consequently subject to
the necessary Effects and Diseases of so <HI>distem∣per'd</HI>
Fluids, which <HI>Milk,</HI> (being white Blood)
<HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> are more specifically
qualified to <HI>antidote</HI> (for it is the Juices only
such a Diet alters or mends). There is another
<HI>Order</HI> of human Bodies, for which this <HI>Regi∣men</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="85"/>
seems also particularly proper, <HI>viz.</HI> those
who have <HI>sharp</HI> and <HI>large</HI> Appetite, or great
and over-stretch'd <HI>Stomachs</HI> by their <HI>Frame,</HI>
or by former <HI>Luxury, Intemperance</HI> and <HI>Lazi∣ness;</HI>
and consequently <HI>lax</HI> and weak <HI>Solids</HI>
and <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Digestion</HI> are utterly incapable
to concoct, grind and perfectly digest any Quan∣tity
of animal Food, or bear <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors;
this <HI>Diet</HI> to such is not unlike the Method
commonly used by <HI>Jockies</HI> to cure their
<HI>Horses,</HI> when their <HI>Corn</HI> passes through them
undigested and entire, which is to mix it with
<HI>Straw.</HI> For other Persons tolerably well and
sound, the lightest and the least of common
Diet, is the more <HI>universal</HI> and safest Regimen,
as Experience shews by its being common; for
<HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> do nothing in vain.</P>
<P>14. ONE great Advantage a <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet
has over an <HI>animal</HI> one, is, that in the weakest
<HI>Digestions,</HI> and the most dangerous and ob∣stinate
Distempers, the <HI>Patient</HI> may always
fill his Belly, and satisfy his <HI>Hunger,</HI> without
Fear, Remorse or Suffering; at <HI>least,</HI> he may
do it to a great Degree, till he comes to be far
advanced in Years: and if he should happen at
any time to exceed, he feels none of those
<HI>pungent</HI> and <HI>acute Symptoms,</HI> nor those dura∣ble
Effects and profound <HI>Sinkings,</HI> he would
feel from a full Meal of <HI>high</HI> Meats and <HI>strong</HI>
Drinks. And this is no small Comfort to those
who are under a dangerous Distemper, or have
<PB N="69" REF="86"/>
a great Degree of <HI>Sensibility.</HI> The common
and necessary <HI>Calls</HI> for Food returning so often,
it would be a painful and intolerable Con∣straint
to be confin'd to an everlasting Guard
and <HI>Attention,</HI> and to eat and drink by Weight
and Measure; to live thus <HI>medicè</HI> is to live
<HI>miserè</HI> indeed. But a <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet, in a
great measure, frees the Patient from all those
continually recurring <HI>Snares,</HI> Dreads, and con∣sequent
Sufferings; for not only the <HI>Tempta∣tion</HI>
to <HI>Excess</HI> is much less, but the Effects of
<HI>Excess</HI> are little or none in Comparison of
those of high <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>rich Wine.</HI>
Add to this, that the <HI>Secretions,</HI> and other <HI>ani∣mal
Functions,</HI> are more regular and freely per∣formed,
under a full Diet of <HI>vegetable</HI> Food,
than they can possibly be under that very spare
and small Quantity of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and fer∣mented
Liquors, that is absolutely necessary to
be observed in a great many <HI>Cases,</HI> as most
<HI>Patients</HI> and all <HI>Physicians</HI> know; and thus
being able to take down a much greater (for
Instance, a quadruple) Quantity of <HI>vegetable</HI>
Food, than would be fit for them to take of
<HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, the now
over-stretch'd and relax'd Bowels and Vessels
may be kept fuller, the <HI>Secretions</HI> will be more
plentiful, and all the <HI>Capillaries</HI> pervious and
fill'd; which under the necessary <HI>spare Diet</HI>
of very little <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>fermented</HI> Li∣quors,
might, for want of proper Liquor, dry
up and <HI>coalesce;</HI> and so the Animal be de∣priv'd
<PB N="70" REF="87"/>
of many <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Arteriolae,</HI> in which
all the Delicacy of Life consists; besides that
it puts a Drag on the Wheels of Life, to hinder
it from running down too fast.</P>
<P>15. A PLAIN, natural, and <HI>philosophical</HI>
Reason, why <HI>vegetable</HI> Food is preferable to
all other Food, is, that abounding with few or
no <HI>Salts,</HI> being <HI>soft</HI> and <HI>cool,</HI> and consisting
of Parts that are easily divided and form'd into
<HI>Chyle,</HI> without giving any <HI>Labour</HI> to the <HI>di∣gestive</HI>
Powers, it has not that Force to open
the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> (if they really have
any opening into the Intestines, which <HI>Leuwen∣hoeck</HI>
and all accurate <HI>Anatomists</HI> deny) to dis∣tend
their <HI>Orifices,</HI> and excite them to an unna∣tural
Activity, to let pass too great a Quantity of
<HI>hot</HI> and <HI>rank Chyle</HI> into the Blood, and so over∣charge
and inflame the <HI>Lymphatics</HI> and <HI>Capilla∣ries,</HI>
which is the natural and ordinary Effect of
<HI>animal</HI> Food, and therefore cannot so readily
produce Diseases. There is not a sufficient
<HI>Stimulus</HI> in the <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>vegetable</HI>
Food, to create an unnatural <HI>Appetite,</HI> or vio∣lent
<HI>Cramming,</HI> at least not sufficient to force
open and extend the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI>
more than naturally they are or ought to be.
Such Food requires little or no Force of <HI>Di∣gestion,</HI>
a little gentle <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Motion</HI> being
sufficient to dissolve it into its integral Particles,
and into a thin watery <HI>Emulsion,</HI> such as is
<HI>Chicken Water, Asses Milk,</HI> or <HI>thin Broth,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="88"/>
which is all that is required for the Purpose of
<HI>Nutrition,</HI> and all of the Food that can enter
the <HI>Lacteals:</HI> So that in a vegetable Diet, tho'
the sharp Humours in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> an ex∣tended
<HI>relax'd Stomach,</HI> and sometimes a de∣lightful
<HI>Piquancy</HI> in the Food, may tempt one
to exceed in <HI>Quantity;</HI> yet rarely, if <HI>Spices</HI>
and <HI>Sauces</HI> (as too much <HI>Butter, Oil, Salt</HI> and
<HI>Sugar</HI>) are not join'd to <HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
can the Mischief go further than the <HI>Primae
Viae,</HI> or <HI>Stomach</HI> and Bowels, to create a pre∣sent
Load, Sickness, Vomiting or Purging, by
its acquiring an <HI>Acrimony,</HI> from its not being
receiv'd into the <HI>Lacteals;</HI> so that no more
being admitted into the Blood, than the Ex∣pences
of <HI>living</HI> require, <HI>Life</HI> and Health can
never be endanger'd on a <HI>vegetable Diet.</HI>
But all the contrary happens under an <HI>high
animal Diet.</HI></P>
<P>16. As for <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> they seem
to me by no means an Institution of Nature
and its <HI>Author,</HI> nor fitted for Health and long
Life: But, on the contrary, if we may credit
the <HI>Jewish Records</HI> and their <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> it is
certain, that fermented Liquors (<HI>Wine</HI> especi∣ally)
were unknown till the <HI>Deluge;</HI> and the
first Experiments produced both <HI>Drunkenness</HI>
and <HI>Incest,</HI> even on the <HI>venerable</HI> Heads of
that Family, which was the only one thought
worthy to be sav'd in the universal <HI>Deluge.</HI>
It is well known, that fermented Liquors de∣stroy
<PB N="72" REF="89"/>
the Digestibility, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Putrefaction</HI>
and <HI>Dissolution</HI> (for <HI>Digestion</HI> is nothing else)
and easy Concoction of all <HI>animal Food;</HI> and
<HI>common Sense</HI> will tell us, that the purest and
thinnest <HI>Water</HI> is fittest to <HI>circulate</HI> through
<HI>Tubes</HI> so infinitely small, as some of animal
Bodies are; and even that it alone will nourish
<HI>Plants,</HI> and bring them to <HI>Maturity</HI> and <HI>Per∣fection.</HI>
And as to the common <HI>drunken
Sneer,</HI> that fermented Liquors <HI>tann</HI> the <HI>Solids,</HI>
and strengthen the <HI>digestive</HI> Organs, it is a
mere <HI>unphilosophical</HI> and insipid <HI>Joke,</HI> con∣trary
to the known <HI>Axiom</HI> in all just Reason∣ing,
that if <HI>Equals</HI> be added to, or subtracted
from <HI>Equals,</HI> the <HI>Sum</HI> or <HI>Remainder</HI> will be
<HI>equal;</HI> and so, if it thickens the Juices, and
hardens the Food, (as it necessarily must) as
much as it <HI>tanns</HI> and strengthens the Solids, it
can still produce nothing but the Diseases of
<HI>sizy</HI> Blood and <HI>unelastic</HI> Solids at last. Fer∣mented
Liquors may be good Medicines and
present Reliefs on Fatigues, Lowness, <HI>epide∣mical</HI>
Distempers, and inclement Seasons, or in
<HI>Extremities</HI> for a <HI>Filip</HI> or present <HI>Spur;</HI> but
they can never be so proper to circulate through
<HI>Tubes</HI> so small as the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix hundredth Part of an
Hair,</HI> or to preserve them from Rupture and
Corrosion for any considerable Time, as fair
sweet Water. As to <HI>Spirits</HI> and Liquors that
have pass'd through the Tortures of the Fire,

some Palace, <HI>viz.</HI> Life itself, when in Danger:
Neither were they ever design'd by <HI>Nature</HI> and
its <HI>Author</HI> for an animal Body, as Nourish∣ment,
or common Drink, and scarce deserve
a Place in the <HI>Apothecary</HI>'s Shop; <HI>Spirits</HI>
having made more Havock among Mankind,

<P>17. IF we attentively consider the last
<HI>Scenes</HI> of most People, and how it is they
die, and with what <HI>Symptoms</HI> they expire;
we shall constantly find it to be of the <HI>too-much,</HI>
the too-high, or too-hot; and not of
the too-little, or too-cool. They either go off
in a <HI>Diarrhea</HI> or <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> an acute or
slow <HI>Fever, Fits</HI> or <HI>Convulsions,</HI> an <HI>Asthma</HI>
or Difficulty of Breathing, a <HI>Syncope</HI> or faint∣ing
Fit, (from some great and incurable pre∣cedent
Evacuation). I mean such as die before
the Term of the natural Duration of Life is ex∣pir'd,
and not of <HI>old Age,</HI> or natural Weak∣ness:
All these die violent and unnatural
Deaths, as really as those who suffer by the
Hand of Justice, as is evident from their <HI>Sym∣ptoms,</HI>
the Nature and Cause of their mortal
Distempers, and the Violence and Acuteness of
their Pains and Sufferings, while they are
wearing out and <HI>agonizing.</HI> Whereas those
who study and constantly practise the <HI>lightest</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="91"/>
and the <HI>least,</HI> ('bating Accidents and <HI>epidemical</HI>
Distempers) generally die and dissolve gradu∣ally,
their <HI>Senses, Faculties, Spirits</HI> and <HI>Sere∣nity</HI>
holding out to the last: They have seldom
violent or acute Sufferings; they descend out
of <HI>Life</HI> as they ascended into it; <HI>the latter
End of such is Peace,</HI> at least as to their bodily
Machine, and in Comparison of the <HI>Agonies,
Tortures</HI> and <HI>Wheel-breakings</HI> of the <HI>first:</HI> at
the very least, this is the natural Consequence
of such a <HI>Regimen;</HI> as is constantly seen in
those who rigidly and strictly follow <HI>Nature</HI>
and its <HI>Laws,</HI> which in <HI>Regimen</HI> is to descend
into Water-gruel, Milk-porridge and Water-pap,
as they ascended from it in common Life;
or in practising to the last the <HI>lightest</HI> and the
<HI>least. Cornaro,</HI> in the last Part of his Life,
liv'd 24 Hours on the <HI>Yolk</HI> of an <HI>Egg;</HI> many
have done so on a Dish of Milk, Chocolate, or
Milk-Tea; and most of those who have run
out to the natural Duration of Life, have thus
departed, as is well attested and confirm'd by
<HI>History</HI> and Observation.</P>
<P>18. IN a word, <HI>Nature,</HI> or, which is the
same Thing, <HI>God, the Author of Nature,</HI>
cures every Distemper, <HI>acute</HI> or <HI>chronical,</HI> (for
<HI>chronical</HI> Distempers are only diluted, weak∣en'd
and lengthen'd <HI>acute</HI> ones, differing only
in Degrees and Duration, and a quick and slow,
a labouring and a free, an intermitting and
continued, a simultaneous and a drawling
<PB N="75" REF="92"/>
Pulse, are the <HI>Criteria</HI> by which we denomi∣nate
Distempers under this Division) which
<HI>He,</HI> or ever it, cures, by a <HI>Nausea,</HI> Loathing,
or Inappetency to Food of any Sort, but parti∣cularly
to all <HI>animal</HI> or strong Meats or
Drinks; then by the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of the <HI>specific</HI>
Distemper, as <HI>Headach, Reaching, Heat,
Thirst, Inflammation,</HI> Pains in all, or parti∣cular
Parts, Difficulty in Breathing, <HI>Throws</HI>
and <HI>Convulsions</HI> in the Bowels, Anxiety,
Dread, <HI>panic</HI> Terror, Chillness, Loss of Senses,
and the consistent Use of the <HI>Faculties;</HI> all
(or some) of these, according to their Nature,
and Violence of the Distemper, respectively:
And these either in a continued <HI>Series,</HI> or
by Fits and Intervals of Ease, which is the
<HI>Oeconomy</HI> of the <HI>Author of Nature,</HI> to la∣bour,
grind and concoct the morbid Matter
and the <HI>material</HI> Cause of the Distemper,
most universally produc'd by a <HI>Mal-regimen</HI>
and improper Food; and when this Matter is
sufficiently concocted by the Distemper, then
comes the <HI>Crise,</HI> to throw it out of the Habit
by some Evacuation or other, as <HI>Sweating,
Vomiting, Purging, Haemorrhage, Urine,</HI> or
<HI>Coughing</HI> and Spitting. This is the constant
<HI>Oeconomy</HI> and Course of Nature in the Cure
of Distempers, and ought to be a <HI>Pattern</HI> and
<HI>Model</HI> for <HI>Physicians</HI> to go by in their <HI>artifi∣cial</HI>
Cure of Diseases. And since <HI>God</HI> and
<HI>Nature</HI> do nothing in vain, it would seem as
if infinite Wisdom had laid down these <HI>simi∣lar
<PB N="76" REF="93"/>
Hieroglyphics, Pictures</HI> and <HI>Insinuations,</HI>
to teach us how to manage in <HI>similar</HI> Cases;
for the silent Language of the <HI>Deity</HI> to us in
this our lapsed State, without Violence on our
Liberties, can be no otherwise than by such
natural <HI>Causes, general</HI> Laws, <HI>Hieroglyphics</HI>
and <HI>Analogy,</HI> by which we may learn of and
imitate Him, as near as we can, in all we do
or think.</P>
<P>19. I AM of Opinion, if it could be possi∣ble
to persuade those who are tolerably well,
and are oblig'd to follow a sedentary Occupa∣tion,
and to use their Heads and intellectual
<HI>Organs</HI> in their Professions, to give over all
fermented Liquors, but on extraordinary Occa∣sions;
to abstain from <HI>animal</HI> Food in <HI>Spring</HI>
and <HI>Autumn,</HI> but especially in the hot Months,
when Fruits and Garden-stuff are in their Per∣fection,
and to follow Nature in the Products of
the <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>vegetable</HI> Kingdom, according
to the Seasons of the Year; the <HI>Spring Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> being more aqueous, tender,
and freer from <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils;</HI> the <HI>Autumn</HI>
Foods being somewhat richer; but the <HI>Winter</HI>
ones having attain'd their greatest Perfection of
Concoction and Maturity; such Persons would
go a great way to preserve their <HI>Health</HI> and
<HI>Serenity,</HI> with few Diseases, <HI>epidemical</HI> or ac∣quir'd:
For in the Spring, all Nature is under
an universal <HI>Fermentation,</HI> to throw off Cru∣dities
and Morbosity: And it is a wise Provi∣dence
<PB N="77" REF="94"/>
that <HI>Lent-time</HI> falls out at that Season,
which, if kept according to its original Inten∣tion,
in <HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> well dress'd,
and not in rich high-dress'd <HI>Fish,</HI> infinitely
more destructive of Health than plain-dress'd
<HI>Flesh,</HI> would go a great way to preserve the
Health of the People in general, as well as dis∣pose
them to Seriousness and Reflection: So
true it is, that <HI>Godliness has the Promise of
this Life, and that which is to come.</HI> And it
is very observable, that in all <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>esta∣blished</HI>
religious Worships, hitherto known
among <HI>policy'd</HI> Nations, <HI>Lents,</HI> Days of <HI>Abs∣tinence,</HI>
Seasons of fasting and bringing down
the <HI>brutal</HI> Part of the rational Creature, have
had a large Share, a strict Observance, and
been reckon'd an indispensable Part of their
Worship and Duty, except among a wrong∣headed
Part of our <HI>Reformation,</HI> where it has
been despis'd and ridicul'd into a total Neg∣lect;
and yet it seems not only natural, and
convenient for <HI>Health,</HI> but strongly com∣manded
in the Old and New <HI>Testament,</HI> and
might allow Time and proper Disposition for
more serious and weighty Purposes: And this
<HI>Lent,</HI> or Times of Abstinence, is one Rea∣son
of the <HI>Chearfulness</HI> or <HI>Serenity</HI> of some
<HI>Roman Catholic</HI> and <HI>southern</HI> Countries,
which would be still more healthy and long∣liv'd,
were it not for their excessive Use of
<HI>Aromatics</HI> and Opiates, (which are the worst
kind of dry Drams) and is the Cause of their
<PB N="78" REF="95"/>
unnatural and unbridled Leachery, and Short∣ness
of Life.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Nature and Cause of the Dis∣orders
of the MIND, so far as they
depend upon the Body.</HEAD>
<P>1. UPON the strictest <HI>Enquiry,</HI> and most
anxious Examination, I could never
find a <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>philosophical</HI> Cause for, or
Account of, <HI>Ideotism, Stupidity,</HI> Loss of <HI>Senses,
Memory,</HI> or <HI>Judgment,</HI> for <HI>Lunacy</HI> or <HI>Mad∣ness,</HI>
or of any of those Distempers that are
called <HI>Cephalic</HI> or <HI>Nervous,</HI> or which is at∣tended
with a <HI>Deviation</HI> from what is called
<HI>common Sense,</HI> or <HI>just Thinking,</HI> but an <HI>Ob∣struction,
Extinction, Relaxation,</HI> or <HI>Mal∣formation</HI>
of the proper Organs (which are
commonly reckon'd the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or their
<HI>Membranes;</HI> for they are membranous <HI>Tubuli,</HI>
fill'd with a milky Liquor, like the Pith of a
Rush, to keep them moist and <HI>elastic,</HI> and
Membranes are the only true <HI>elastic Organs</HI> of
an animal Body); by which the Mind acts uni∣formly
or regularly: And therefore, in all Na∣ture,
I could never find so <HI>luciferous</HI> and ex∣pressive
an <HI>Emblem,</HI> or <HI>analogous</HI> Similitude of
the Operations of the <HI>Mind</HI> on the <HI>Body,</HI> in its
<PB N="79" REF="96"/>
intire and perfect Health, as that of a skilful
<HI>Musician</HI> playing on an harmonious and well∣tun'd
<HI>musical</HI> Instrument.</P>
<P>2. ICANNOT see any <HI>essential</HI> or <HI>philoso∣phical</HI>
Difference between a <HI>Man</HI> and an <HI>An∣gel</HI>
appearing to our Senses under an <HI>human</HI>
Form (as it is <HI>alledg'd</HI> that <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI>
of an Order superior to ours, have actually
done); I say, I can, in true <HI>Philosophy,</HI> con∣ceive
no Difference between an <HI>Angel</HI> appear∣ing
and acting in an human Form, and a real
<HI>Man,</HI> either in Nature or Kind, but only in
Degree: So that, to me, a <HI>Man</HI> is a diminutive
<HI>Angel,</HI> shut up in a Flesh Prison or Vehicle;
and an <HI>Angel</HI> appearing in an <HI>human</HI> Form,
is a superior human Spirit, for that Time
cloathed with some sensible <HI>Vehicle,</HI> and acting
by and upon material <HI>Organs,</HI> divinely fram'd;
and both are, in reality, no other than a <HI>Mu∣sician</HI>
shut up in a fine <HI>Organ</HI> Case. In the
same Manner, and from the same Causes, I see
through a <HI>Microscope,</HI> a <HI>Telescope,</HI> or <HI>Spec∣tacles,</HI>
as through my own fleshly Eyes; by
the same Laws likewise I hear and speak
through a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> as with my <HI>Ears</HI> and
<HI>Mouth,</HI> and feel through a fine <HI>Lawn</HI> or
<HI>Membrane,</HI> as by my outward <HI>Skin,</HI> only
more or less distinctly; and, if the artificial <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
be well contrived, and duly form'd, it is
much in the same Manner, as to the <HI>sentient</HI>
Principle; it is <HI>that</HI> alone, which is the Seat
and Principle of all <HI>Sensation</HI> and <HI>Intelli∣gence.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="97"/>
Material <HI>Organs,</HI> form'd by Art, are
much the same as natural ones, only the last
are more nicely and elegantly fram'd.</P>
<P>3. UNLESS a Man give up all <HI>Reason,
Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Proportion,</HI> as well as <HI>Ana∣logy,</HI>
and run into downright <HI>Scepticism, blind
Fate, Witchcraft</HI> and <HI>Inchantment,</HI> he must
suppose that an infinitely wise and beneficent
Being could not have created free and intel∣ligent
Creatures, but for some wise End and
Purpose; and, to obtain this End, must have
made them, at first, sound in <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mind.</HI>
How <HI>Error, Diseases, Misery</HI> and <HI>Death</HI>
commenc'd, may readily be accounted for,
from the Abuse of <HI>Freedom</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI> spu∣rious
<HI>Self-love,</HI> and an inordinate Love of the
Creatures: But this is at present foreign to my
Design. But as to the Disorders of the <HI>Body,</HI>
of the <HI>Senses, Imagination, Memory,</HI> and such
as belong to the <HI>Faculties,</HI> and their <HI>Organs,</HI>
they are naturally and <HI>philosophically</HI> to be ac∣counted
for, from <HI>Accidents</HI> only, <HI>Debauches,
Excesses,</HI> and a <HI>Mal-regimen,</HI> gradually spoil∣ing
and destroying this <HI>musical</HI> Instrument, and
its several <HI>Stops</HI> and <HI>Keys,</HI>
either in the <HI>Pa∣rents</HI>
or in the <HI>Posterity.</HI> I can readily con∣ceive
how such a <HI>Debauch</HI> spoil'd, obstructed,
or relax'd such a <HI>Set of Glands, Nerves,</HI>
or <HI>Capillaries:</HI> That an Excess in <HI>Punch,
Spirits, Ham-pye</HI> or <HI>Venison-pasty,</HI> plaister'd
up, or obstructed, one Set of <HI>fine Tubes;</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="98"/>
how excessive <HI>Leachery</HI> dissolv'd, broke or un∣bended
so many <HI>Nerves, Fibres</HI> and <HI>Lym∣phatics;</HI>
and how the <HI>crazy</HI> Parents, from
vitiated Juices, and rotten or unform'd Solids,
brought into the World deform'd <HI>ideotical</HI>
Children; how want of <HI>Culture</HI> and Exercise
of the material <HI>Organs,</HI> necessary to <HI>spiritual
Action</HI> or <HI>Thinking,</HI> render them <HI>callous, ana∣leptic</HI>
or <HI>tetanous,</HI> (just as want of bodily Ex∣ercise,
and a <HI>Mal-regimen,</HI> produce a similar
Effect on the Limbs and grosser <HI>Organs</HI>) and
so communicated the same Infirmities, and
distemper'd Organs, in <HI>Miniature,</HI> to their
wretched Posterity, and, in such an unnatural
<HI>Climax,</HI> transmitted <HI>Monsters, unnatural</HI>
Forms of Body, <HI>Disorder of Senses, Wrong∣headedness,
Ideotism, spurious Freethinking</HI>
and <HI>Infidelity,</HI> down to us the last Link of the
Chain. Thus the Appearances are natural, <HI>Phi∣losophical</HI>
and rational; on any other Scheme,
all is Darkness, Confusion and <HI>Anarchy.</HI></P>
<P>4. I HAVE been credibly inform'd, that Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> when he applied himself to
what is esteem'd the greatest Stretch of human
<HI>Invention</HI> and <HI>Penetration, (viz.</HI> the Study,
<HI>Investigation</HI> and <HI>Analysis</HI> of the <HI>Theory</HI> of
<HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Colours</HI>) to quicken his Faculties,
and fix his Attention, confin'd himself to a
small Quantity of Bread, dureing all the Time▪
with a little <HI>Sack</HI> and Water, of which, with∣out
any Regulation, he took as he found a
<PB N="82" REF="99"/>
Craving, or <HI>Failure</HI> of Spirits. And the
famous Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> Projector of the <HI>Missi∣sippi,</HI>
to keep his Head clear, and Faculties
acute, in order to obtain a Superiority of
Skill in <HI>Game,</HI> liv'd many Years on <HI>half</HI> a
Chicken a Day, with about a <HI>Pound</HI> of Bread,
and drank nothing but Water or <HI>aqueous</HI> Li∣quors,
and by that Means won great Sums on
the Square. Many more Instances I could give
of great Men in all Ages, and of all <HI>Profes∣sions,</HI>
who maintain'd their Superiority of
Parts, their Attention, Penetration, just and
close Thinking, by extreme <HI>Temperance</HI> and
<HI>Abstinence.</HI> But I chose these <HI>two,</HI> because
they have been, and still are, much distin∣guish'd
and known in their vastly different
Ways; and that any one who thinks it worth
his while, may be satisfied about the Truth of
the Facts.</P>
<P>5. THERE are two Sorts of human Race,
as different as <HI>the Sons of God,</HI> and <HI>the Chil∣dren
of Men, viz.</HI> those whose Eminence and
Dignity consists chiefly in their <HI>Heads, Facul∣ties</HI>
and <HI>spiritual Nature,</HI> and <HI>those</HI> whose
great <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> is to excel in the Exer∣cise
and Use of their <HI>Bodies, Limbs</HI> and <HI>mate∣rial
Organs;</HI> or, in one word, there are those
<HI>who govern,</HI> and those <HI>who are govern'd,</HI> origi∣nally
form'd and mark'd out by Nature, and
their original <HI>Frame</HI> and <HI>indelible Signatures:</HI>
The <HI>last</HI> may safely, at least for <HI>some Time,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="100"/>
wallow in sensual Pleasures, high and strong
Meats and Drinks; but are all the Time in the
State of the <HI>Mock-Tyrant of Sicily,</HI> who had
a <HI>naked Sword</HI> hanging over his Head by a
Hair at his Feasts; and all such pay an <HI>equiva∣lent</HI>
for their <HI>Luxury,</HI> in the <HI>comparative</HI>
Shortness of their <HI>Lives;</HI> but they do not fear,
because they do not think <HI>justly,</HI> having gene∣rally
very blunt and obtuse <HI>intellectual Or∣gans.</HI>
The <HI>first</HI> have more delicate and <HI>elastic
Organs</HI> of <HI>Thinking</HI> and <HI>Sensibility,</HI> and the
Pleasures of that kind in them are beyond
those of <HI>Sensuality</HI> in others: they are like
fine <HI>Lancets</HI> or <HI>Razors,</HI> that coarse Usage
will soon ruffle and spoil; and therefore must
forego gross and rank sensual Pleasures, to
preserve their <HI>Organs</HI> of Thinking sound and
intire; otherwise their Sufferings will be into∣lerable,
which is the Case of all <HI>nervous Hypo∣chondriacal</HI>
and <HI>Hysterical</HI> Persons; most of
which were created <HI>Genii, Philosophers</HI> and
<HI>Lawgivers.</HI> The <HI>Middle</HI> between both these
Extremes, are indeed <HI>Mediocria Ingenia,</HI> and
their Number great; and when such are strong
in thinking and penetrating, their Success is ow∣ing
to <HI>Chance,</HI> or rather <HI>Providence,</HI> to <HI>Coinci∣dents</HI>
and particular Circumstances, or some par∣ticular
<HI>Set</HI> of <HI>nervous Glands</HI> and <HI>Fibres</HI> in the
<HI>Brain,</HI> not quite spoil'd or relax'd by the In∣temperance
of their Parents. This <HI>last</HI> Sort
may sometimes produce a <HI>false Hero, Con∣queror,</HI>
or admirable <HI>Mechanic</HI> or Tradesman;
<PB N="84" REF="101"/>
but seldom an <HI>honest and able Minister,</HI> a wise
<HI>Lawgiver,</HI> or deep <HI>Philosopher;</HI> and seldomer
a <HI>Genius,</HI> or a deep contemplative <HI>Christian.</HI>
But this admits of infinite Degrees, as all Things
measur'd by Quantity do, and is more imme∣diately
under <HI>God's moral Government</HI> of his
World, and nothing but the Event can ascer∣tain
who will be <HI>such.</HI></P>
<P>6. How much <HI>Diseases, Debauches</HI> and
<HI>Accidents,</HI> that disorder or destroy the <HI>Organs
of Thinking,</HI> influence our Manner of <HI>Think∣ing,</HI>
is so obvious, that not only <HI>Philosophers,</HI>
and all the Tribes of <HI>Physicians,</HI> but even the
<HI>Vulgar</HI> have observ'd it, and its Truth is almost
an <HI>Axiom</HI> of <HI>Common Sense.</HI> When I see a
<HI>gloomy, melancholy, heavy, stupid, thoughtless,
joyless</HI> Creature, much more a <HI>whimsical, ano∣malous</HI>
or <HI>libertine,</HI> free-liveing or <HI>free∣thinking
Mortal,</HI> I conclude him in a bad
State of Health, under a dangerous <HI>bodily
Disease,</HI> or under a perpetual <HI>Mal-regimen,</HI>
which will soon terminate in one, whatever
Appearances be to the contrary; and sooner
or later, I have been always confirm'd in the
Justness of <HI>this Opinion,</HI> having always found
a real, <HI>chronical</HI> or <HI>acute,</HI> specify'd Disease, to
manifest itself at last, and become the <HI>Crisis</HI> of
what these <HI>Oddities</HI> and Enormities were the
remote and elementary <HI>Symptoms.</HI> For I am
convinc'd, that <HI>Calmness, Serenity, Chearful∣ness</HI>
and <HI>Common Sense,</HI> (at least in Things
<PB N="85" REF="102"/>
level to our natural Capacities and Education)
and an Esteem and Love of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and what
promotes it, are the constant Attendants, and
only infallible Symptoms of <HI>perfect bodily,</HI> and
<HI>intellectual,</HI> (or of <HI>sana Mens in Corpore sano</HI>)
<HI>Health;</HI> and pretending to be wise out of
<HI>Common Sense,</HI> or happy out of <HI>Common Life,</HI>
is, with me, one of the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a <HI>ce∣phalic</HI>
or <HI>nervous Distemper.</HI> In <HI>England</HI>
alone, from <HI>Gluttony</HI> and <HI>Intemperance</HI> in fer∣mented
Liquors, and from unguarded <HI>Lea∣chery,</HI>
I have been told, that a <HI>late worthy and
learned Physician,</HI> that had examin'd into the
Numbers confin'd for <HI>Lunacy</HI> and <HI>Madness,</HI>
upon the strictest Examination, found they
reach'd to a Number I dare not name. And
another <HI>Physician</HI> ascribed Wrong-headedness,
<HI>gloomy Thinking, Melancholy, Despondency</HI>
and <HI>Darkness</HI> on the <HI>Imagination,</HI> to the
abounding of Choler in the <HI>Stomach,</HI> which
every one knows to arise from Intemperance
and Excess. Whatever be in these <HI>Gentle∣mens</HI>
Observations and Opinions, it cannot
be doubted, that the clear, ready and pleasant
Exercise of the <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties, and their
easy and undisturb'd <HI>Application</HI> and <HI>Atten∣tion</HI>
to any Subject, is never to be obtained,
but by a free and regular Performance of the
natural <HI>Functions,</HI> which, as has been shewn,
the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> Food can only pro∣cure.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="103"/>

at present are fitted and contriv'd by their
<HI>Maker,</HI> for <HI>animal</HI> Food, at least for some time;
and in the present ruinous State of the <HI>Globe</HI> we

a <HI>Proportion</HI> of <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, seem ex∣tremely
convenient and fit, that is, for <HI>mecha∣nical</HI>
Force, strong Labour, and bodily <HI>Prow∣ess;</HI>
and, for some <HI>Ranks</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of Men,
indispensable and unavoidable: But, at the
same time, their Labour and Exercise, in some
Measure, <HI>antidote</HI> the Evils and Diseases that
naturally must follow from such a <HI>Regimen;</HI>
tho', generally, they even must give up for <HI>it</HI>
some Part of the <HI>Duration</HI> of their Lives. And
even this Necessity of animal Food, differs ac∣cording
to the Nature of the <HI>Climat;</HI> the
<HI>northern</HI> requiring more than the <HI>southern</HI>
Parts. But for those who are under no Obli∣gation
of bodily Labour, whose <HI>Callings</HI> and
<HI>Professions</HI> make a sedentary Life necessary,
or whose Occupations require only <HI>clear
Heads,</HI> great <HI>Attention,</HI> and a free and easy
Exercise of their <HI>intellectual Faculties,</HI> which
intirely depend on the easy and regular Per∣formance
of the animal Functions, either <HI>Py∣thagoras</HI>'s
or <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <HI>Regimen</HI> must be abso∣lutely
<PB N="87" REF="104"/>
necessary, and that of the Laborious, de∣structive
and ruinous.</P>
<P>8. OUR <HI>Bodies,</HI> in this present State of
Things, by their own Nature, and from the
Nature of Things within and about us, can∣not
be brought into absolute Subjection and
Obedience; but we may readily bring them to
the present <HI>Docility</HI> and Subjection we have
of the domestic <HI>Animals;</HI> by timously <HI>bridling,
trammeling</HI> and <HI>disciplining</HI> them, <HI>i. e.</HI> by feed∣ing
them coolly and sparingly, giving them
due <HI>Air, Exercise</HI> and <HI>Cleanness,</HI> and <HI>phy∣sicking</HI>
them properly when they grow <HI>rampant,</HI>
rebellious, or obstreperous: And for this very
wise End is the long <HI>Nonage</HI> of the human
Race design'd, <HI>viz.</HI> for the due <HI>Culture</HI> of the
<HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI> And thus we might bring
our Bodies to the same Subjection, at least,
that we do our <HI>Dogs</HI> and <HI>Horses,</HI> and have
the same Service, Pleasure and Obedience from
them, till we drop into <HI>purer</HI> ones. And it
is very observable, that all kinds of Food that
are <HI>insipid, mild, cool</HI> and <HI>watery,</HI> whether of
Meats or Drinks, are <HI>salutary</HI> and <HI>curative,
prolific</HI> and <HI>lengthen</HI> Life: and on the con∣trary,
every thing in Food that is much <HI>tasty,
poignant, hot, salt, sharp</HI> or <HI>stimulating;</HI> is
<HI>pernicious, deleterious</HI> and <HI>morbific,</HI> and de∣structive
of Life and Spirits, and that in Pro∣portion
to the Degree of their <HI>Sapidity</HI> and
<HI>Deliciousness;</HI> and all this, without Excep∣tion
<PB N="88" REF="105"/>
or Limitation, I think: So wisely are
Things contriv'd, that <HI>sensual Pleasure</HI> natu∣rally
and necessarily produces <HI>Pain;</HI> and <HI>Vir∣tue</HI>
and <HI>Temperance</HI> beget <HI>Happiness</HI> and
<HI>Health;</HI> and that in every Instance. <HI>Virtue</HI>
and <HI>Happiness, Order</HI> and <HI>Peace, Self-denial</HI>
and <HI>Serenity, Vice</HI> and <HI>Misery, Luxury</HI> and
<HI>Pain, Rebellion</HI> and <HI>Punishment,</HI> are natural,
physical and necessary <HI>Causes</HI> and <HI>Effects.</HI></P>
<P>9. OUR <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Prejudices</HI> are the
great Obstacles to all our just and solid <HI>Think∣ing,</HI>
as well as our Acquisition of <HI>Virtue. Pride,
Self-sufficiency, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Malice,</HI> make
us desire and wish that our Opinions were true:
<HI>Opinions, Systems</HI> and <HI>Maxims,</HI> lightly re∣ceiv'd,
shut up our Minds from receiving or
attending to more Light, from <HI>Tradition</HI> or
<HI>Experience: Luxury, Riot</HI> or <HI>Leachery,</HI> de∣stroy
the <HI>Organs</HI> of our Faculties; all together
make <HI>Virtue,</HI> deep and just Thinking, not only
not <HI>amiable,</HI> but exceeding <HI>painful</HI> and diffi∣cult;
and we determine to be against <HI>them,</HI>
because they are and must be eternally against
<HI>us.</HI> Now the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least,</HI> by make∣ing
us healthy, chearful and easy, moderats
and restrains all these; it cools our Blood and
Juices, <HI>weakens</HI> our <HI>Passions,</HI> fixes our <HI>Atten∣tion,</HI>
and makes <HI>intellectual</HI> Enjoyments and
Pursuits easy and delightful, and the Acquisi∣tion
and Practice of the <HI>Virtues</HI> natural and
ready.</P>

10. TAKE a <HI>Child</HI> of healthy Parents,
coming into the World in such Perfection of
Body as is common to the <HI>middling</HI> Rank; let
him be suppos'd to be always manag'd, as to
<HI>Diet,</HI> nearly by the above-mention'd <HI>general
Rule, viz.</HI> the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least;</HI> and that
<HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise</HI> be join'd to form his <HI>Or∣gans;</HI>
let his Mind be at the same time culti∣vated
by all the proper Means of Knowledge,
Wisdom and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> during his Youth∣hood;
and let him in <HI>Manhood</HI> act that Part
his <HI>Genius</HI> and Vocation fit him for; at, or
towards <HI>Fifty,</HI> let him begin gradually to abate
of his Food, both in <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Quality;</HI>
and at last <HI>descend</HI> out of Life, as he <HI>ascended</HI>
into it, by being fed, exercis'd and air'd, as he
was in his <HI>Youth;</HI> he will then go down to
the <HI>Grave</HI> with his <HI>Spirits, Senses</HI> and <HI>Facul∣ties,</HI>
and the whole Compound perfect and
intire, without great Distempers, violent Pains,
or Lowness and Oppression (at least, such is
the natural Effect of those Means and Causes);
because the Blood and Juices will always be
sweet, cool and fluid, and consequently can
meet with little or no <HI>Resistance</HI> in their <HI>Cir∣culation</HI>
or <HI>Secretions</HI> (which alone is the
Cause of Pain). It is of such a <HI>Man,</HI> and of
such a <HI>Life</HI> alone, that we are to judge of the
Happiness or Misery of our present State of
Being (all the rest being the Works of our
Hands, and the Effects of our own Choice);
<PB N="90" REF="107"/>
and not from the gross <HI>Mismanagements</HI> and
<HI>Irregularities, Accidents,</HI> or unnatural Ap∣pearances
of a few <HI>monstrous</HI> or <HI>preternatural
Individuals:</HI> As in <HI>Plants,</HI> we judge of their
Nature, <HI>Species</HI> or <HI>Tribe,</HI> by the fairest, fullest
grown, and best cultivated; and not by any
irregular or <HI>monstrous</HI> Production.</P>
<P>11. I HAVE already said, that true <HI>Mania's,</HI>
real <HI>Lunacy, Madness,</HI> and a disorder'd Brain,
(a Disease by which so shamefully many suffer
in <HI>England,</HI> and those of the best Kind, and
many of them of distinguish'd Parts) can pos∣sibly
be accounted for, from no other natural
Cause, but a <HI>Mal-regimen</HI> of Diet; and the best
<HI>Physicians</HI> have no other Method of curing such
<HI>Diseases,</HI> but great, proper, and frequent <HI>Eva∣cuations</HI>
of all kinds, Vomits especially, with a
<HI>low Diet,</HI> and then bracing by <HI>Vegetables,
Astringents</HI> or <HI>cold Baths;</HI> all the rest are but
trifling. But People think they cannot possibly
subsist on a little <HI>Meat, Milk</HI> and Vegetables, or
any low Diet; and that they must infallibly pe∣rish,
if they should be confin'd to <HI>Water</HI> only; not
considering that <HI>nine</HI> Parts in <HI>Ten</HI> of the whole
Mass of Mankind are necessarily confin'd to
this <HI>Diet,</HI> or pretty nearly to it; and yet live
with the Use of their <HI>Senses, Limbs</HI> and <HI>Fa∣culties,</HI>
without Diseases, or but <HI>few,</HI> and
those from <HI>Accidents</HI> or <HI>epidemical</HI> Causes;
and that there have been <HI>Nations,</HI> and now
are Numbers of <HI>Tribes,</HI> who voluntarily con∣fine
<PB N="91" REF="108"/>
themselves to <HI>Vegetables</HI> only; as the
<HI>Essenes</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> some <HI>Hermits</HI> and
<HI>Solitaries</HI> among the Christians of the first
Ages, a great Number of the <HI>Monks</HI> in the
<HI>Chartreux</HI> now in <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Banians</HI>
among the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Chinese,</HI> the <HI>Guebres</HI>
among the <HI>Persians,</HI> and of old the <HI>Druids</HI>
among ourselves: And there are whole Vil∣lages
in this Kingdom, (even of those who live
on the Plains) who scarce eat <HI>animal</HI> Food, or
drink fermented Liquors a dozen times a
Year. 'Tis true, most of these cannot be said
to live at Ease and <HI>commodiously,</HI> and many
may be said to live in <HI>Barbarity</HI> and <HI>Igno∣rance:</HI>
All I would infer from this, is, that
they do <HI>live,</HI> enjoy <HI>Life, Health</HI> and outward
<HI>Serenity,</HI> with few or no bodily Diseases, but
from Accidents and <HI>epidemical</HI> Causes; and
that being reduc'd by voluntary or necessary
<HI>Poverty,</HI> they are not able to manage with
Care and Caution the rest of the <HI>Non natu∣rals,</HI>
which, for perfect Health and Chearful∣ness,
must all be equally attended to, and pru∣dently
conducted; and their <HI>Ignorance</HI> and
<HI>Brutality</HI> is owing to the want of the Con∣venience
of due and sufficient <HI>Culture</HI> and
<HI>Education</HI> in their Youth. But the only Con∣clusion
I would draw from these <HI>historical
Facts,</HI> is, that a <HI>low Diet,</HI> or living on Vege∣tables,
will not destroy <HI>Life</HI> or <HI>Health,</HI> or
cause nervous and <HI>cephalic Distempers;</HI> but,
on the contrary, cure them, as far as they are
<PB N="92" REF="109"/>
cureable. I never once dreamt, nor do I think
it natural, reasonable or practicable, as human
Affairs are now constituted, that the whole
<HI>Mass</HI> of Mankind should or could live on <HI>Ve∣getables</HI>
only; the Blood and Juices they
would beget, might not, perhaps, be rich and
<HI>durable</HI> enough for <HI>Labour, Force</HI> and <HI>Prow∣ess;</HI>
though I will not absolutely determin
the contrary, considering that all these are in∣nate
and <HI>original</HI> Powers in the Body: But this
I pretend to <HI>demonstrate</HI> from these <HI>Facts,</HI>
that <HI>Abstinence</HI> and a <HI>low Diet</HI> is the great
<HI>Antidote</HI> and universal Remedy of Distempers
acquir'd by <HI>Excess,</HI> Intemperance, and a mis∣taken
<HI>Regimen</HI> of <HI>high</HI> Meats and Drinks; and
that it will greatly alleviate and render tolera∣ble,
the original Distempers deriv'd from dis∣eas'd
Parents; and that it is absolutely neces∣sary
for the <HI>deep-thinking</HI> Part of Mankind,
who would preserve their <HI>Faculties</HI> sound and
intire, ripe and pregnant, to a <HI>green old Age,</HI>
and to the last Dregs of Life; and that it is the
true and real <HI>Antidote</HI> and Preservative from
Wrong-headedness, irregular and disorderly <HI>in∣tellectual</HI>
Functions, from Loss of the <HI>rational</HI>
Faculties, <HI>Memory</HI> and <HI>Senses,</HI> and from all
<HI>nervous Distempers,</HI> as far as the Ends of Pro∣vidence
and the Condition of Mortality will
allow.</P>
<P>12. IT is evident to our <HI>Senses,</HI> that an
Over-dose of <HI>Port, Punch, Gin,</HI> or <HI>Brandy,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="110"/>
will make a Man as <HI>mad</HI> and distracted for a
time, as any Person confin'd in <HI>Bedlam</HI> can be:
It is equally evident, that a <HI>Surfeit</HI> of strong high
Foods will <HI>sink, depress</HI> and <HI>disable</HI> a Man as
much from all rational Thinking and Action,
as habitual <HI>Melancholy</HI> and <HI>Hypochondriasm.</HI>
Here are two sensible Causes of the two diffe∣rent
kinds of <HI>Madness</HI> and <HI>Lunacy,</HI> or Depri∣vation
of the rational Faculties, at least of their
Use for a time. Either of these, continu'd in,
will fix and habituat these two Distempers into
their habitual Natures. All Distempers are
cured by their Contraries; low living and Wa∣ter-drinking,
will not only prevent, but cure
these two kinds of Distempers. Excesses in
this low, cool living, as to the Quantity taken
down, can only produce a little transient Sick∣ness,
and Evacuation upwards or downwards;
and he who would preserve his Head clear,
his Faculties quick, and his Attention fix'd,
need only live as <HI>low</HI> and <HI>cool</HI> as he finds
his Nature can bear with tolerable Ease, and
only recruit when she gives him a <HI>Call;</HI> for
he will have many <HI>Calls</HI> before she suffers
greatly for Want, unless violent <HI>Passions</HI> be
the Cause, which are a third <HI>Species</HI> of
<HI>Wrong-headedness,</HI> or <HI>Madness;</HI> but which is
seldom carried to an <HI>Extreme,</HI> but where the
Habit and the Body is already greatly distem∣per'd,
spoil'd and putrified.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="111"/>
13. I CAN conceive the Matter no other∣wise
than thus: The <HI>Mind</HI> or <HI>Soul</HI> is the <HI>self-moveing,
self-active, sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent
Principle,</HI> with limited, but invariable natural
Powers of <HI>Liveing,</HI> and of <HI>Thinking, Free-willing,</HI>
and beginning Motion in those Bo∣dies,
whose <HI>Passivity</HI> or <HI>Inertia</HI> is not supe∣rior
to its <HI>active</HI> Powers. How it exerts these
Powers on <HI>divinely organiz'd</HI> Matter, I do not
here pretend to say; but I conceive it acts on the
Organs by means of the <HI>Mechanism</HI> of the
Brain and its <HI>Nerves,</HI> which are an Infinity of
differently situated, complicated and stretch'd
little <HI>Filaments</HI> or <HI>Fibrils,</HI> fill'd with a soft
<HI>milky</HI> cellular Substance, (like a <HI>Rush</HI> with its
<HI>Pith</HI>) contain'd in small <HI>membranous</HI> extreme∣ly
<HI>elastic</HI> Sacks or <HI>Tubuli,</HI> all whose <HI>elastic</HI> and
<HI>energic</HI> Virtue consists in the proper <HI>Tension</HI> or
<HI>Vibrations</HI> of these Sacks or <HI>membranous</HI> Coats,
spread over all the <HI>Solids</HI> of the Body, which be∣ing
extremely <HI>elastic</HI> and springy, convey <HI>har∣monious</HI>
and divinely proportion'd <HI>Vibrations,
Undulations</HI> and <HI>Tremors,</HI> excited outwardly
by Objects to this <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Prin∣ciple;
and reciprocally the <HI>Soul,</HI> or self-move∣ing
Principle, impresses proper <HI>Vibrations</HI> and
<HI>Tremors</HI> on these infinitesimal <HI>membranous
Sacculi</HI> to the respective <HI>Organs</HI> of Sense and
<HI>Muscles;</HI> and thus <HI>Sensation, Perception,
Images, Ideas</HI> and <HI>muscular Motion</HI> may be
perform'd. When the Juices of the Body are
<PB N="95" REF="112"/>
corrupted, their Particles too big, too sharp, too
corrosive, or any way improper, they may ex∣cite
<HI>Tremors, Vibrations</HI> and <HI>Oscillations un∣harmonious,
heterogeneous</HI> and <HI>dissonant,</HI> in
the Course of the <HI>animal Functions:</HI> in Sleep,
in Dreams, in Diseases, or in any State of the
Body: On these unnatural, wild and incon∣sistent
<HI>Ideas, Sensations</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> the
<HI>self-active</HI> Principle may act very consistently
to its Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> reason justly, choose judi∣ciously,
and operate <HI>consistently;</HI> and yet the
<HI>Groupe</HI> and whole <HI>Aggregate</HI> and Connexion
of such <HI>Cogitation</HI> and <HI>Ratiocination</HI> may be
wild, extravagant and unnatural, and quite
wrong-judged, and <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Common Sense,</HI> and
<HI>just</HI> and <HI>healthful Thinking</HI> and <HI>Consistency.</HI>
This is the best <HI>Idea</HI> I can conceive in these
abstruse and obscure Distempers, which I only
propose as a <HI>Philosophical Conjecture:</HI> others
may explain the Matter better, if they can.</P>
<P>14. ON the whole, I think the <HI>lightest</HI> and
the <HI>least</HI> Food may be justly term'd the shortest
and most effectual <HI>Antidote,</HI> and the most <HI>uni∣versal
Remedy,</HI> for all Distempers of the Body,
and Errors and Mistakes of the <HI>Mind,</HI> that de∣pend
upon, or have any Relation to, the Body,
that the Wit of Man can suggest or invent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reflections on the Nature, Cause and Theory
of acute, epidemical and contagious Dis∣tempers,
in the Animal and Human Crea∣tion.</HEAD>
<P>1. UPON all the <HI>Experience</HI> I have ever
had, or the <HI>Observations</HI> I could
ever read or make, I have concluded a <HI>Fever,</HI>
or an acute Distemper, (genuine or symptoma∣tical)
is to be denominated <HI>so,</HI> or to be called
<HI>such,</HI> chiefly from an uncommon, dureable
<HI>Quickness, Fullness, Hardness,</HI> or <HI>Labour,</HI> in
the Pulse, and a Foulness of the Mouth or
Tongue; and that the <HI>first</HI> proceeded from too
great a Quantity, <HI>Density</HI> or <HI>Tenacity</HI> of the
<HI>Blood Globules;</HI> and the <HI>second</HI> from too hot,
acrid and <HI>briny</HI> a State of the <HI>Serum;</HI> and that
both together made that State of the <HI>Blood</HI>
which produc'd <HI>malignant,</HI> putrid and <HI>caco∣chymic</HI>
Fevers, of which there are endless, use∣less
and frivolous Distinctions among <HI>Authors,</HI>
which can neither be ascertain'd, when they
happen, nor afford just and distinct <HI>Indications</HI>
to prosecute a proper <HI>Cure:</HI> These two menti∣oned
<HI>Distinctions</HI> admit all the Degrees of finite
Quantities, hold thro' all their various Kinds,
(whose <HI>Symptoms</HI> seem to me rather <HI>Effects</HI>
than <HI>Causes</HI>) and will account for all the Ap∣pearances
of <HI>acute</HI> Distempers. As to <HI>slow,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="114"/>
or, as they are called, <HI>nervous</HI> Fevers, I reckon
them only <HI>Symptomatic,</HI> and the Product of
an hot scorbutic <HI>Cachexy,</HI> some <HI>Capillaries,
Glands,</HI> or some noble <HI>Organ,</HI> beginning to
be obstructed, <HI>schirrous,</HI> or to spoil: And, I
think, an <HI>Hectic</HI> is caused by tumified or
ulcerated <HI>Tubercules</HI> in the Lungs, or from
<HI>purulent</HI> Matter concocting somewhere, or
from some of the <HI>Viscera</HI> corrupting; and all
the Kinds of them, from bad Juices <HI>first,</HI> and
obstructed <HI>Glands</HI> or <HI>Viscera after.</HI></P>
<P>2. IF this Account be <HI>just,</HI> as it is <HI>simple,</HI>
the <HI>Indications</HI> for the Cure of the several
kinds of <HI>Fevers</HI> will rise very naturally and
readily; <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> kinds of <HI>Fevers;</HI>
1<HI>st,</HI> Evacuations of all proper kinds, especi∣ally
<HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> till at least the Strength
and Velocity of the <HI>Pulse</HI> subside, and, 2<HI>dly,</HI>
cooling, acid and thin <HI>Dilution</HI> plentifully
and uniformly thrown in, to separate the
<HI>Blood-Globules,</HI> and keep all the <HI>Capillaries</HI>
pervious, and prevent their Obstruction and
<HI>Coalescence.</HI> In the <HI>second</HI> kind of Fevers,
less, though sufficient, <HI>Evacuation,</HI> but more
plentiful <HI>Dilution,</HI> of the <HI>mucilaginous</HI> kind,
to sheath the acrid <HI>Salts</HI> of the <HI>Serum,</HI> and
then the <HI>Testacea,</HI> with the mild <HI>ponderose</HI>
(<HI>Cinnabar,</HI> native or artificial, and <HI>Antimony
Diaphoretic, Bezoarticum Minerale, &amp;c.</HI>) to
break their Points, are here indicated; and in
the <HI>compounded</HI> kinds, a <HI>Composition</HI> of both
<PB N="98" REF="115"/>
<HI>Intentions,</HI> and both kinds of Medicines; in
the <HI>Symptomatic</HI> Kind, besides the general
<HI>Intention,</HI> a particular Application and <HI>topical</HI>
Remedies to the les'd <HI>Viscera</HI> or <HI>Organ.</HI> Per∣haps
simple and clear <HI>Orange-Tea</HI> or Whey
thrown in perpetually, and the cooling <HI>Salts,</HI>
with the simple <HI>Testacea,</HI> even in the blood∣globular
Fevers, may do best; and Barley∣water,
or thin Water-gruel, with Juice of
Lemons, and the mild <HI>ponderose</HI> with the
<HI>Testacea,</HI> may do well in the <HI>serous</HI> Kind, if
constantly, regularly and plentifully thrown
in. But Fevers, in general, will be best un∣derstood,
in my way of Thinking, from the
Nature of their worst and most deleterious
Kind, under which I would class all the
<HI>eruptive</HI> Kinds, as lesser Degrees of the same
<HI>Species.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>CONTAGION,</HI> its Nature and
Cause, have much puzzled and perplex'd some
<HI>Philosophers;</HI> and yet, if we take the Mat∣ter
right, there will no such Difficulty be found
in it, as is commonly imagin'd. For sup∣posing,
1<HI>st,</HI> That all Matter is <HI>attractive,</HI>
both in its small and great Parts: 2<HI>dly,</HI> That
this <HI>Attraction</HI> is according to some constant
and invariable <HI>Law,</HI> as the <HI>subduplicate, sub∣triplicate,</HI>
or some other <HI>reciprocal</HI> Propor∣tion
of the Distance from the Centre of the
Particles: 3<HI>dly,</HI> That the less a Body is, the
greater will be its Degree of <HI>Attraction</HI> in
<PB N="99" REF="116"/>
respect of its Solidity, or the Quantity of
Matter it contains: 4<HI>thly,</HI> That <HI>Fire, Heat,
Fermentation,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>intestine</HI> Mo∣tion,
have a natural Tendency and <HI>Energy</HI>
only to divide and resolve Bodies into their
smallest Parts; and consequently that <HI>chy∣mical</HI>
Fires, and all artificial Operations, by
which the Particles of Bodies are violently
agitated, can have no other Effect than to
divide them into lesser, and still lesser Parts;
which Parts, when once separated and set free,
either recede and fly off from one another, if
without the <HI>Sphere</HI> of each other's <HI>Attraction;</HI>
or <HI>coalesce,</HI> and run into one another's Em∣braces,
and so form Bodies of a different <HI>Tex∣ture</HI>
and <HI>Bulk.</HI> Thus, for Example, the
Juice of the <HI>Grape,</HI> when duly fermented,
turns <HI>vinous,</HI> that is, by the intestine Motion
and Heat, arising from the Laws of <HI>Gravity</HI>
and <HI>Attraction,</HI> the <HI>Tartar</HI> and essential <HI>Salt</HI>
runs together, and sticks to the Sides of the
Vessel, the Husks swim on the Top, and the
Stones and earthy Parts drop to the Bottom,
and form the <HI>Lees,</HI> and the <HI>vinous</HI> Part swims
in the Middle, according to its Purity, or rela∣tive
Levity. A <HI>second Fermentation</HI> on the
same Body by the same Laws and <HI>Mechanism,</HI>
renders that <HI>acetous</HI> which was before <HI>vinous;</HI>
the <HI>sulphurous</HI> or inflammable <HI>Spirit</HI> evapo∣rating,
and the <HI>essential Salts</HI> remaining dis∣solving
and mixing with the Lymph, makes
it <HI>acetous:</HI> These divided by a still greater and
<PB N="100" REF="117"/>
more violent Heat, as in an <HI>Alembic,</HI> separats
the Parts more minutely, and minutely throw∣ing
off the lightest first, and the others in Pro∣portion
to their <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Volatility;</HI> and
when artificially treated, afford the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the
<HI>Oil,</HI> and the <HI>Salt,</HI> apart. 5<HI>thly,</HI> There are
properly but three kinds of <HI>Salts,</HI> though
never any of them is to be obtained pure, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Acid,</HI> the <HI>Alkali,</HI> and the Urinous or Vola∣til
<HI>Salt.</HI> The <HI>Acid</HI> seems to be angular, with
<HI>plain</HI> Surfaces; hence its Sharpness, and greater
<HI>Attraction.</HI> The <HI>Alkali</HI> seems to be porous
and obtuse, or <HI>calcarious,</HI> as hard <HI>Sponges;</HI>
and hence its <HI>Fermentation</HI> with Acids. The
<HI>third</HI> seems to be porous and obtuse, but inti∣mately
united with a light volatil <HI>Oil</HI> or <HI>Sul∣phur;</HI>
and hence its <HI>Volatility</HI> and <HI>Detona∣tion.</HI>
And these are the <HI>Salts</HI> that all <HI>animal</HI>
Substances, and most <HI>Vegetables</HI> yield, when
<HI>chymically</HI> prepar'd, or much divided and sub∣lim'd
by <HI>Putrefaction, Fermentation,</HI> or <HI>Di∣stillation.</HI>
6<HI>thly,</HI> These <HI>Salts</HI> are divisible or
<HI>subtilisible in infinitum,</HI> and are mix'd with
one another in all Proportions, and with more
or less <HI>Sulphur, Oil,</HI> or inflammable <HI>Spirit,</HI>
which renders them capable of infinit <HI>Vola∣tility</HI>
and <HI>Sublimity,</HI> and so of <HI>infinit</HI> Force
or Activity; and it is to these that Contagion
and <HI>pestilential</HI> Distempers seem to owe their
<HI>Malignity, Universality,</HI> and <HI>deleterious</HI> Na∣ture.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="118"/>
4. <HI>A PESTILENCE,</HI> or Plague, arises
mostly from one of these Causes: 1<HI>st,</HI> Dead
Carcases of Men, Horses, or Cattle slain, and
<HI>putrifying</HI> above Ground by Heat and Moisture,
and throwing their noxious Particles, and infi∣nitely
small <HI>volatile urinous Sales,</HI> through
the <HI>Atmosphere.</HI> 2<HI>dly,</HI> Dead Fishes thrown
out of the <HI>Sea,</HI> and putrifying on the Shore;
or Clouds and Swarms of dead <HI>Insects</HI> bred
in Fens, and hot marshy Countries, as <HI>Cater∣pillers,
&amp;c.</HI> drowned in the Ocean, and
thrown ashore by the <HI>Tide</HI> in scorching <HI>Cli∣mats,</HI>
to putrify and ferment by Heat and
Moisture, and send forth an <HI>Atmosphere</HI> of
active <HI>urinous Salts.</HI> 3<HI>dly, Cloaths, Rags,
animal</HI> or <HI>vegetable</HI> Substances, taken from
Persons dying of a <HI>Plague,</HI> and saturated
with such infectious or deleterious Par∣ticles
which stream from them. 4<HI>thly,</HI> Bad
Food, <HI>i. e.</HI> putrified, rotten, and too minutely
divided Flesh, abounding with detach'd <HI>uri∣nous</HI>
and <HI>volatile Salts;</HI> as the <HI>Hydrophobia</HI>
in <HI>Dogs</HI> and other <HI>Animals,</HI> is probably from
Surfeits of putrified <HI>Carrion,</HI> or by the <HI>Infection</HI>
being communicated by the <HI>Bites</HI> of such.
Or, 5<HI>thly,</HI> From <HI>mineral, arsenic</HI> and poi∣sonous
Damps, Vapours, Exhalations arising
from <HI>Volcanoes, Grottoes, Ruptures,</HI> or <HI>Mines,</HI>
excited by subterraneous Heat and <HI>Fermenta∣tion.</HI>
Upon exact Search and Inquiry, one of
these <HI>five</HI> Causes will constantly be found to
<PB N="102" REF="119"/>
have been the natural Source of all the
<HI>Plagues,</HI> or <HI>pestilential</HI> Distempers, that have
ever been in the World. They can only
arise from an high <HI>Exaltation, Volatilisation</HI>
and <HI>Sublimation</HI> of these urinous <HI>animal Salts,</HI>
and <HI>mineral Steams,</HI> which being hard, porous
and <HI>alkaline,</HI> but fitted with a light, <HI>caustic</HI>
and <HI>aethereal Oil,</HI> or <HI>Sulphur,</HI> whereby their
<HI>Velocity</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> is increas'd, they be∣come
<HI>small, volatil,</HI> and highly <HI>attractive,</HI>
by their <HI>acid Sulphur,</HI> when taken into animal
Bodies in great Quantities, by the <HI>Lungs,</HI> or
<HI>Vasa Inhalantia:</HI> They soon by their Effer∣vescence
(like <HI>Barm</HI> in <HI>Wort</HI>) rend, tear and
putrify the <HI>Solids,</HI> and break the Cohesion of
the Fluids, and so destroy <HI>animal Life;</HI> and
they sooner enter into, and make quicker
<HI>Havock</HI> on, such as live high, as those of
this Island do, than those of any other Nation
whatsoever, (as <HI>Davila</HI> observes in his History of
the Civil Wars of <HI>France</HI>) like the <HI>Hogs,</HI> which
of all other <HI>Animals</HI> catch such Distempers the
soonest, and propagate it the quickest. This
has been particularly observ'd in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>
by Dr. <HI>Ottoni</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Philosophical Transactions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>5. BOTH kinds of <HI>Salts,</HI> or deleterious
Particles, when collected into great Volumes,
and united into large Clusters, suddenly and
violently destroy the <HI>animal Machin, viz.</HI> the
<PB N="103" REF="120"/>
<HI>volatil</HI> refin'd <HI>Acid,</HI> and the volatil <HI>Alkali;</HI>
the first constitutes <HI>Poisons,</HI> and the latter
<HI>Plagues. Acids</HI> must always consist of sharp,
angular, and hard Particles, as is evident from
their Effects on <HI>Metals,</HI> and animal <HI>Organs;</HI>
and since they must have a Figure, that of a
<HI>triangular equilateral Prism</HI> seems most suit∣able
to their Nature; and such <HI>Poisons</HI> mani∣festly
appear to be, from Experiment, as in the
Action of <HI>Aqua Fortis, Aqua Regia,</HI> or <HI>Spirit</HI>
of Vinegar on <HI>Metals;</HI> and when admitted
into the <HI>animal</HI> Habit, immediately fix and
coagulate the Juices, and violently rend and
tear the Solids.</P>
<P>6. <HI>MADNESS</HI> and <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> in
Dogs, and Rage and Lust in other <HI>Animals,</HI>
arise from the Abounding and Fermentation
of <HI>animal</HI> Salts only; particularly the Mad∣ness
of <HI>Dogs</HI> is observ'd to proceed from <HI>Sur∣feits</HI>
of Carrion and putrified Flesh, they fill∣ing
their Blood and Juices with such <HI>volatil</HI>
and animal <HI>Salts,</HI> that are detach'd, and in a
State of Activity; which <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> is now
so successfully, and, I think, rationally cured
by ponderous Medicines, those especially that
are the quickest of all in their Operations, as
large Doses of <HI>Turbith,</HI> as might have been
justly expected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Philosophical Transactions for 1737. Dr. <HI>De∣fault</HI>'s
Book.</NOTE>; but the Cure cannot be
<PB N="104" REF="121"/>
certain, unless it be brought to rise to a quick
<HI>Salivation;</HI> for as the Effect of this <HI>Poison</HI> is
quick, so must that be of its <HI>Antidotes. Mer∣curial</HI>
Inunction, with a Quicksilver Oint∣ment,
and the active <HI>Ponderose,</HI> may hasten and
ascertain the <HI>Cure</HI> in such a desperate and
frightful Distemper.</P>
<P>7. ALL <HI>epideimcal,</HI> infectious and erup∣tive
Distempers, are but lesser Degrees of <HI>pesti∣lential</HI>
ones, caused by these <HI>animal Salts</HI>
weaken'd and diluted. The <HI>Itch</HI> arises from
the same <HI>animal</HI> Salts, of a more course, dull
and less deleterious Nature, encourag'd by
Nastiness, as <HI>Vermin</HI> are bred in close damp
Rooms. The <HI>Small-pox</HI> is the first Elements,
or the lowest Degree of the <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Pe∣stilence;</HI>
and the <HI>Great-pox</HI> is the same, more
condens'd and concentred: And thus, by an
easy and natural Piece of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> all <HI>epi∣demical</HI>
Infections, and <HI>pestilential</HI> Distempers,
may be accounted for.</P>
<P>8. <HI>ACUTE</HI> Diseases are generally pro∣duc'd
more immediately by Excesses in strong,
fermented, or <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors. <HI>Spirits</HI> and
<HI>volatil</HI> Oils have the most sudden, the most
active and deleterious Quality. <HI>Gluttony</HI> may
create Obstructions in the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Capil∣laries,</HI>
and so produce <HI>chronical</HI> Diseases;
but it is by <HI>Drunkenness</HI> alone, and dealing
too freely with Fire and <HI>Spirits,</HI> that quick
<PB N="105" REF="122"/>
and violent Devastations are made. I am
never under any Apprehension for those who
drink nothing but Water, (the only Beverage
fitted and perfected by the <HI>Author of Nature</HI>
for <HI>animal</HI> Bodies) let their Complaints and
Diseases be called by whatsoever Name they
will; there is no possible Case in an <HI>animal</HI>
Machin, but that one, <HI>viz.</HI> where Nature is
endeavouring to throw the peccant Humours
on the farthest Distance from the <HI>Centre</HI> and
<HI>Bowels,</HI> and on the Extremities, that Water-drinking
is not safe and proper; and in Per∣sons
habituated only to Water, very gentle
and mild <HI>Cordials</HI> will serve, to wind up the
internal Springs of the Circulation, and help
them to propel the morbid Matter to the
greatest Distance; and then, and only then,
when there is an <HI>Anxietas Praecordiorum,</HI> an
internal Disorder on the <HI>Springs</HI> and motive
Powers, a Sickness, <HI>Nausea</HI> and <HI>Retching,</HI>
and even then only, when the Disease is too
strong for Nature's weak Powers, is she to be
fortified with <HI>Cordials;</HI> and they ought to be
the most simple and temperat, (especially to
Persons generally sober) even in the retir'd
<HI>Gout, Small pox, Erysipelas,</HI> or any flitting or
changeable Distemper; and it is only in the
<HI>Intervals</HI> of such Distempers, that Water∣drinking
is adviseable. <HI>Spirituous</HI> and <HI>fer∣mented</HI>
Liquors are only proper, on internal
Sickness, <HI>Anxieties, Inappetency,</HI> and Low∣ness;
or in Extremities, as a <HI>Spur</HI> or <HI>Filip,</HI> to
<PB N="106" REF="123"/>
give Nature a little Respite when oppress'd,
and enable her to go on with the <HI>extirpative</HI>
and <HI>preventive</HI> Remedies mentioned. And
even in <HI>acute</HI> Cases, if we believe the well∣attested
Reports of the <HI>Ice-water Doctors</HI> of
<HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> it is surprising, in such
Cases, what Cures they have perform'd, by
pouring down plentiful Draughts of <HI>Ice-water,</HI>
or <HI>distill'd Rain-water</HI> cool'd with Ice. Bar∣ley-water,
with Syrup of Currants or Lemons,
or <HI>Orange-whey</HI> or Tea, might perhaps do the
like here. I think, after proper Evacuations,
proper Dilution is the universal Remedy in
<HI>acute</HI> Cases.</P>
<P>9. I SAY, I think timeous, well-judg'd and
plentiful Evacuations of all kinds, with full,
free and grateful Dilution, the great Affair in
<HI>Acute</HI> Cases; <HI>animal Salts</HI> highly exalted, re∣fin'd
and sublim'd, (that is, divided) are the
<HI>Leaven</HI> and <HI>Yest</HI> towards <HI>Putrefaction,</HI> as
any one the least acquainted with <HI>Philosophy</HI>
must know, which is the true natural Cause
of the <HI>Plague,</HI> and all putrid and malignant
<HI>Fevers:</HI> And as <HI>Acids</HI> only stop <HI>Fermenta∣tion,
Aethiops,</HI> as made of the best Acid,
and the most effectual <HI>Deobstruent,</HI> bids fairest
for Prevention, as acid Dilution, after proper
Evacuation, seems the best Method of <HI>Cure;</HI>
just as in great Conflagrations, the Business is
to withdraw and disperse the Fewel as fast as
we can, and pour on Water till the Flames
<PB N="107" REF="124"/>
have not Force to consume the Dwelling;
when the Danger is over, there will be Time
and Leisure given to set in Order, and make
it convenient and habitable again. It is not
my Affair here to detail and limit the <HI>specific</HI>
Means; they may be met with in <HI>Lominus</HI>'s
<HI>Eloganty,</HI> and in <HI>Sydenham</HI> solidly laid
down; and with a good deal of specious Pro∣bability
in <HI>Langrish</HI>'s <HI>Theory of Physic,</HI> and
precisely pointed and adjusted by the most in∣genious
Dr. <HI>Bryan Robinson,</HI> in his excellent
<HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> towards the Close. All
Acute Distempers are lower Degrees of, and
have some <HI>analogous</HI> Resemblance to, <HI>conta∣gious</HI>
and <HI>epidemical</HI> Distempers. Latest Ac∣counts
from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and all over <HI>Asia,</HI>
inform us, that the most effectual Security
<HI>Europeans</HI> and <HI>Francs</HI> have in a <HI>Pestilence,</HI> is
to withdraw into a sound pure Air, and live
very temperatly, and, on the Necessity of a
nearer Approach, to live on <HI>Vegetables</HI> only.</P>
<P>10. SINCE all kinds of <HI>Fevers</HI> are but
<HI>Miniatures</HI> and Steps towards a <HI>Plague,</HI>
which is the highest Degree, and quickest <HI>Dis∣solvent</HI>
of the <HI>animal</HI> Frame, <HI>quod potest ma∣jus,
potest minus;</HI> plentiful and proper Eva∣cuations
at first, acid and cooling <HI>Dilutions,</HI>
with interspers'd <HI>Diaphoretics,</HI> as the Consti∣tution
of the Patient, and the Malignity of
the Disease, require and call for, seem to be
the most solid Indications in the <HI>Pestilence,</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="125"/>
and in all <HI>putrid</HI> and <HI>malignant Fevers;</HI> espe∣cially
that of the confluent <HI>Small-pox,</HI> in its
first Stage; such as a roasted <HI>Orange</HI> with
<HI>Bawm, Sage,</HI> or <HI>Green-Tea,</HI> and sweetened
with <HI>Currant-gelly, Barley-water</HI> with Spirit
of Nitre, small Sack-whey made with Juice
of Lemons, or the like. On the second Fe∣ver
of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> and after Maturation in
all <HI>eruptive</HI> Diseases, gentle <HI>Diaphoretics,</HI> and
mild <HI>Cordials,</HI> are indicated, to keep out the
morbid Matter on the Surface. And the best
<HI>Antidote</HI> in Nature against the Small-pox, and
the Plague itself, is certainly <HI>Aethiops Mi∣neral</HI>
and <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of <HI>Antimony</HI> in <HI>Pills</HI> or
<HI>Bolus,</HI> taken twice or three times a Day, and
wash'd down with Orange-whey, as those who
understand the Nature and Efficacy of these
Medicines must see, and of which I have had
some successful Experience; for the confluent
<HI>Small-pox</HI> is but a Miniature of the <HI>Plague,</HI>
and both are cureable in good Habits. And
I am satisfy'd the <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> itself can only
be solidly cured by <HI>Mercury</HI> judiciously ma∣naged.</P>
<P>11. I HAVE often wonder'd how the an∣tient
<HI>Greek Physicians,</HI> especially those about
the Time of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> so successfully, and
with such wonderful <HI>Eulogies,</HI> from all <HI>An∣tiquity,</HI>
cured their <HI>Patients,</HI> when it is cer∣tain
the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> was then very nar∣row
and simple, and those Medicines men∣tioned
<PB N="109" REF="126"/>
and described by them were of the
roughest and most active Kind, such as <HI>Helle∣bor,
Coloquintida, Elaterium,</HI> and the like, and
their Number very small. All I can imagine
to account for this, is, that <HI>Diet,</HI> or rather
absolute <HI>Fasting,</HI> (as was certainly the Prac∣tice
of <HI>Asclepiades</HI>) much <HI>Dilution,</HI> and espe∣cially
plentiful Water-drinking in acute Cases,
was their great Affair: but their <HI>Climat</HI> and
Diseases were quite different from ours. This
Method tho' has lately been renewed with unac∣countable
and almost miraculous Success in
<HI>Snow</HI> or <HI>Ice-water</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> as may be seen
by the Account of it in the <HI>Philosophical
Transactions.</HI> I have well-attested Relations,
and by the most sober and intelligent Persons,
(<HI>Physicians</HI> and others) of the wonderful Ef∣fects
of it in almost all Cases with a quick
Pulse; in some particularly, by pouring down
every Hour, or every half Hour, a Pint or half
a Pint of this Water, cold or hot, according
to the Season, and sometimes acuated, when
sluggish, with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Nitre</HI> or Currant∣jelly;
and continued even to 35 Days, with∣out
any earthly Food; and even in a <HI>nervous
Fever,</HI> and a beginning <HI>Phthisis:</HI> by which
the Patients were perfectly recovered from all
<HI>feverish</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Complaints, and by
living at first on <HI>Asses</HI> Milk and light Soups,
and so returning gradually to a common <HI>Diet,</HI>
have continued well and healthy ever since.
Many more and very different Cases of the
<PB N="110" REF="127"/>
same Nature, (with a quick Pulse) and some
<HI>Chronical</HI> ones, have been sent me well at∣tested;
but this first one I pick'd out as a ge∣neral
<HI>Model</HI> and <HI>Specimen:</HI> I cannot think,
indeed, this Method imitable in our colder
<HI>Climat;</HI> but this I am very certain of, that if
the <HI>animal</HI> Body be nothing but a <HI>Compages</HI>
or Fabric of <HI>Pipes,</HI> as it most certainly is, then
plentiful <HI>Dilution,</HI> by injecting the thinnest,
most fluid, and moistening of all <HI>Liquids,</HI> is
the readiest way to cleanse and make them
<HI>pervious;</HI> and the only thing that can pre∣serve
them open, if they are not clogg'd and
obstructed with too gross and improper Food
in the Time; for in <HI>Acute Cases,</HI> there is little
or no Digestion, and there most certainly is
a most universal <HI>Obstruction</HI> of all the <HI>Glands</HI>
or <HI>Capillaries:</HI> For let <HI>Physicians</HI> dispute to
the End of the World, about the Cause of
<HI>Fevers,</HI> I think there can be but these <HI>two,</HI>
an acrid, hot and <HI>viscid</HI> Blood and Juices, and
an universal <HI>Obstruction</HI> of the <HI>Lymphatics,
Capillaries</HI> or <HI>Glands,</HI> as these putrified Juices
happen to fall on particular <HI>Organs</HI> or Bowels;
and consequently there can be no other pro∣per
and adequat <HI>Cure</HI> of them, but <HI>proper
Evacuation</HI> in all the probable and possible
Ways, and plentiful <HI>Dilution</HI> by the lightest,
coolest, and most penetrating <HI>Fluids,</HI> together
with <HI>grinding</HI> Medicines; all other Methods
seem to me absurd and frivolous. But it
must depend on the <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="128"/>
of the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> to apply these general Me∣thods
to particular Cases, and particular Pa∣tients;
for <HI>Climats, Seasons,</HI> and different
Airs, have the greatest Influence on <HI>Acute</HI> Cases,
and no one Method of Cure can be universal
to all Countries and Constitutions, and Acute
Cases require Attention to the minutest Cir∣cumstances.</P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. THE <HI>Blood</HI> is the Source and oc∣casional
Cause of <HI>Animal Life:</HI>
In the <HI>Blood is the Life thereof,</HI> say <HI>Moses;</HI>
and, I think, so says the best <HI>natural Philo∣sophy;</HI>
and according as it is good, bad, or
indifferent, so is the Health of the <HI>Animal.</HI>
When I find the <HI>Blood</HI> like <HI>Lambs Blood,</HI>
that is, when the <HI>Serum</HI> is about One-half,
or One-fourth, of the Whole, near limpid, or
of a pale <HI>yellow</HI> Colour, not over <HI>saltish,</HI> nor
too sweet, the <HI>Curd</HI> florid, without <HI>Size</HI> or
<HI>Buff</HI> on the Top, and readily yielding to the
Knife, or dividing <HI>Instrument;</HI> I conclude my
Patient in no immediate Danger, let his
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> or his Distemper, be called how it
will; not but that such a Person may have
sometimes grievous Ails, to wit, from topical
Injuries, a loaded or relaxed Stomach, or
<PB N="112" REF="129"/>
Solids, obstructed <HI>meseraic Glands,</HI> or from
the Blood and Juices not being as yet per∣fectly
sweeten'd and thinn'd in the <HI>capillary</HI>
Vessels (but there forming Obstructions); from
preternatural Formations, or <HI>epidemical</HI> and
accidental Injuries: But while the Case is as I
have just now described it, I am confident the
Patient is under no present mortal Distemper,
and in Time, by proper Means, may get over
these <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and well again, if he is not
too far gone in Life.</P>
<P>§. 2. THE Blood appears by the <HI>Microscope,</HI>
like Water with mix'd soft Flesh <HI>Globules,</HI> which
by Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Philosophical Transactions.</NOTE> accurate Experiments, are
about Three-fourths of the Weight of the whole
Mass, and in <HI>Diameter</HI> about 1/124 of the <HI>Dia∣meter</HI>
of an ordinary Hair of the Head. By
a <HI>Chymical Analysis,</HI> he found a great Propor∣tion
of <HI>Phlegm</HI> or pure Water in the <HI>Serum,</HI>
and but little <HI>Salt, Oil</HI> and <HI>Earth;</HI> but that the
<HI>Curd</HI> had much less <HI>Phlegm,</HI> and a great deal
more of these others: But I have little Faith
in the Principles of any natural Bodies forced
out by the <HI>Tortures</HI> of Fire in <HI>Chymistry,</HI> at
least for the Purpose of Medicine, that <HI>Ana∣lysis</HI>
quite altering the Texture, Figure and
Properties of the integral Particles of natural
Bodies; nor have I ever, in my Practice and
Observation, found a <HI>Chymical</HI> Medicine of
<PB N="113" REF="130"/>
any Value or Efficacy in the Cure of <HI>Chro∣nical</HI>
Distempers, which I could not supply
better by <HI>unanalys'd</HI> natural Bodies, and their
integral Particles, in Water, prepared only by
common <HI>Cookery;</HI> besides the Damage these
Chymical Medicines, when introduced into
the Habit, do, in the small Vessels, if con∣tinued
long, or given in any great Quantity.</P>
<P>§. 3. THE <HI>Foulness, Acrimony</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> of
the Blood, I take chiefly to arise from strong
fermented Liquors, in which the Oil, Spirit, and
Salt, is set free by Digestion, and then super∣abounds.
Nature has created for us animal
and vegetable Foods, but no fermented Li∣quors:
they are the Product of <HI>infernal</HI> Art.
I have by frequent little <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> aqueous
Beverage, a low Diet, and the mild <HI>Pon∣derose,</HI>
observed the <HI>Buff</HI> on the Blood grow
thinner, its Colour livelier and whiter, the
<HI>Serum</HI> more transparent and sweeter, and the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> of the Distemper milder and less
frequent, by sensible Degrees; and no doubt
they all come on in the same Order and De∣grees,
by the quite contrary Methods to which
they go off. Strong <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors con∣tract
and bind together the <HI>Blood-Glo∣bules,</HI>
and stuff them with their <HI>Oils</HI> and
<HI>Spirits,</HI> so that they become lighter, and
swim on the Top of the separating Mass, fill
the <HI>Serum</HI> with their Salts, and weaken and
break the Cohesion and Elasticity of the <HI>So∣lids,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="131"/>
by their too strong <HI>Stimulus,</HI> so that they
are not sufficient to circulate and mix in due
Proportion the several Principles, and continue
the Mass of Blood, so as it ought to be, in a
sound State of Health; and hence Obstructions,
Distempers, and Death.</P>
<P>§ 4. THE whole Business of a <HI>Physician,</HI>
in Chronical Distempers at least, is to render
the Blood (and consequently all the other
<HI>Secretions</HI> separated from it) sufficiently fluid,
sweet and balsamic; this alone can restore to
the Patient perfect and dureable Health, and
nothing less ever can. Many a Person is born
with this bad Blood from diseased Parents,
and in some I have seen it sensibly, (without
catching Cold, as is the common Cant,) even
when very young, to my great Surprize; but
always found the Parents had been unhealthy,
when they were born, or had died early of
some <HI>Chronical</HI> Distemper, or the Children
were begot when the Parents were old, and
consequently the Blood running into <HI>Visci∣dity</HI>
and <HI>Size.</HI> It is true, a deep Cold will
bring on a transient and acute Viscidity, which
may be soon remov'd by soft and <HI>Diaphoretic</HI>
Medicines; but the true <HI>chronical</HI> and dureable
<HI>Size,</HI> can only come from the <HI>Salts, Spirits</HI>
and <HI>Oils</HI> of fermented Liquors, compressing
and breaking the <HI>Blood-Globules:</HI> If this has
not come to such a Degree, as actually to kill
the <HI>Seminal Animalcula</HI> in the Parents, it
may tho' thus make the Blood so <HI>viscous,</HI> as to
<PB N="115" REF="132"/>
produce <HI>Fits,</HI> or other mortal Distempers in the
Infant, or some Acute or Chronical Distempers
in its more advanced Age, especially when the
Party has come to its full Growth, the Solids
are developed and fix'd for some time in their
Extension; which may happen at any Time,
but chiefly about Thirty-five, or towards the
<HI>Meridian</HI> of the now common Length of Life.
For though a Person is born with such a cor∣rupt
and sizy Blood from his Parents, yet while
the Solids and Vessels are developing, un∣stretched
and extending, this <HI>Size</HI> and <HI>Cras∣sity</HI>
may not appear to the Senses, even on
Blood-letting, till about or towards the Time
mentioned, because from the Fibres and Coats
of the Vessels stretching and yielding, the
Globules are not so compressed, as to be
broken and disfigured, which is necessary to∣wards
the Production of this <HI>Size.</HI> The Glo∣bules
may be approaching, but not come into
actual Contact and Compression. I never
saw a deep obstinate <HI>Chronical</HI> Distemper,
without <HI>sizy</HI> Blood, at least in its last Stage,
nor do I think it possible.</P>
<P>§. 5. THE Instances mentioned by Dr.
<HI>Lower,</HI> of the Broath flowing from the
Nose, after a long <HI>Hemorrhage,</HI> and of pure
white Blood, by Dr. <HI>Beal,</HI> and such-like
Cases, are only from the extreme Viscidity of
the <HI>Crassamentum</HI> or <HI>Grume,</HI> which hinder
the <HI>Assimilation</HI> or intimate Mixture of the
<PB N="116" REF="133"/>
new <HI>Chyle</HI> with the old Mass, and make
them separat like Oil and Water; which is
likewise the Case in confirm'd <HI>Dropsies, Dia∣betes's</HI>
and <HI>Jaundices;</HI> in which last Dis∣temper,
upon opening a Vein on some threat∣ening
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> I have seen the <HI>Curd</HI> coated
on the Top with a yellow <HI>Buff,</HI> and the <HI>Se∣rum</HI>
like a foul Tincture of <HI>Saffron;</HI> and no
<HI>Cure</HI> is to be hoped for in such <HI>Cachexies</HI>
from Evacuations only of any kind. <HI>Ca∣thartics,
Diuretics, Diaphoretics,</HI> or <HI>Eme∣tics,</HI>
are nothing but mere temporary Reliefs,
(of all which <HI>Emetics</HI> procure the longest
and greatest) nothing but a thin deobstruent
Regimen of the softest and coolest Nature,
which will readiest unite with the old <HI>viscid</HI>
Mass, with the mild grinding <HI>Ponderose,</HI> such
as <HI>Cinnabar natural</HI> and <HI>artificial, Antimony,
Diaphoretic, Millipedae,</HI> prepared <HI>Egg-shell,</HI> or
<HI>Crab's-eyes,</HI> and the like, long continued, with
a proper <HI>Regimen,</HI> can extirpate so strong a
<HI>Cachexy.</HI></P>
<P>§. 6. THE <HI>scarlet</HI> Colour of the Blood is
undoubtedly owing to the <HI>Air</HI> and its <HI>Nitre</HI>
in the <HI>Lungs;</HI> there are Properties in the Air
which all our modern <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or most
accurate Experiments, have not as yet dis∣covered
or accounted for. <HI>Those</HI> of the pro∣moting
and actuating <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> and
giving the <HI>scarlet Colour</HI> to the Blood in the
<HI>Lungs,</HI> are some of the most uncontestable
and considerable. I have constantly observed,
<PB N="117" REF="134"/>
that those who had weak, bad or tender Lungs,
those who were much subject to <HI>Coughs,
Cold-catching,</HI> to be <HI>Asthmatic</HI> or <HI>Catarrhous,</HI>
have always had bad Blood: Nor is it possible
it should be otherwise; the <HI>venal</HI> Blood is
of a sensibly paler and fainter <HI>Red,</HI> than the
<HI>arterial;</HI> and strong <HI>Lungs</HI> and a good <HI>Air,</HI>
contribute much to the grinding, mending
and giving the <HI>scarlet</HI> Colour to the Blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Leuvenhoeck.</NOTE>
The <HI>Air</HI> in the <HI>Bronchial</HI> Vesicles (which,
when blown up fully, rise almost perpendi∣cularly
on the Branches of this <HI>pneumatical
Machin</HI>) both suffers the Blood to pass freely
through the Lungs, and, by their <HI>elastic</HI> Ve∣sicles
blown up with elastic Air, separat the
compress'd venal <HI>Blood-Globules,</HI> and by its
introduced <HI>Nitre,</HI> divides them from their
too close Union, breaks them into their ele∣mentary
lesser Globules, and so brings them
to that <HI>Minuteness,</HI> which is necessary to
reflect only the <HI>scarlet</HI> Colour or red Rays.</P>
<P>§. 7. THE <HI>Heat</HI> of the Blood certainly
arises from the <HI>Velocity</HI> of its Circulation, and
the mutual Friction of the Globules on one
another, and on the Sides of the containing
Vessels, which will be increased as it is more
or less stored with sharp Salts, hot Oils, or
any such active stimulating <HI>Particles.</HI> The
<HI>Author</HI> of Nature has adjusted a due <HI>Medium,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="135"/>
between the too flat and low <HI>Crase</HI> of the
Blood, and that of the too pungent and active
Nature, which is in Proportion to the Strength
of the Solids, and their elastic Power; in which
the most perfect Health consists: All <HI>over</HI> or
<HI>under</HI> this <HI>Mediocrity</HI> is worse, though that
<HI>under</HI> is much safer for long Life, and that
<HI>above</HI> for greater Strength. The Study of a
<HI>Philosopher</HI> or <HI>Physician,</HI> in regard to the
Body, is to preserve this just <HI>Balance</HI> between
the Blood, and Juices, and the Solids; for it is
from the Juices solely that all the <HI>Solids</HI> are
repair'd and increas'd; and <HI>Medicines</HI> can do
little or nothing but on these Juices: The <HI>So∣lids,</HI>
by their malignant Nature, may be
broken, putrify'd or relax'd; but can scarce
ever be much carried into a higher Perfection,
more benign Temper, or stronger Elasticity,
even when the Juices are mended by Diet,
than they are constituted by Nature; so that
removing Impediments from them, and bring∣ing
them to their own original <HI>Tone,</HI> is all
that can be done; and even that is only by
the Intermediation of sound Juices: So that
if any <HI>Experiments</HI> could be contriv'd to
determin the original <HI>Firmness, Force</HI> and
<HI>Elasticity</HI> of the <HI>Solids,</HI> a <HI>Regimen</HI> might be
readily found, that should thin and dilute the
<HI>Crase</HI> of the Juices to be in a true Balance to
them, or a little under it, which would be
the same with the <HI>Panacea.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of MERCURY, its Nature, sensible Qua∣lities,
and Effects.</HEAD>
<P>§. 8. <HI>MERCURY</HI> judiciously manag'd,
seems to me, to be the only true
<HI>Panacea,</HI> and universal <HI>Antidote,</HI> sought by
<HI>wise,</HI> and boasted of by <HI>Pyrotechnical En∣thusiasts.
Mercury</HI> seems pointed out and
impress'd by the <HI>Signature</HI> of the <HI>God</HI> of Na∣ture,
for the <HI>Cure,</HI> at least for the <HI>Relief,</HI> of
intelligent Creatures, made miserable by <HI>he∣reditary</HI>
Diseases, by natural Appetites irre∣gularly
indulg'd, by Ignorance, bad Example
and Frailty, in the human Kind especially
made so by <HI>high</HI> Food, and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors
mostly. I will not run into the subtle and
too resin'd Qualities of this only <HI>secondary</HI>
and true sensible Fluid in all Nature, (which,
though entertaining to <HI>Philosophers,</HI> would
be of little Use in the <HI>Practice</HI> of Physic;
our Senses and Sensations being so obtuse, as
to be little hurt by <HI>Indivisibles</HI> or <HI>Minute∣nesses</HI>)
but take those that are manifest and
incontestable, which are, 1°. Its <HI>Gravity,</HI>
which is at least <HI>fourteen</HI> Times more than that
of the other sensible Fluid in Nature, <HI>viz.
Water:</HI> from whence flows its <HI>Momentum</HI> and
Force, in opening a Way to itself in all <HI>Ani∣mal
Tubes,</HI> where the Resistance is less than
<PB N="120" REF="137"/>
its Force, or where the Aperture is naturally
to be effected. 2°. The <HI>Rotundity</HI> of its
component <HI>Particles,</HI> which in all Probabi∣lity
holds to its very <HI>last</HI> and <HI>least Particles;</HI>
for to the <HI>last</HI> invisible Particle (when com∣press'd
on a smooth polish'd Glass) it continues
still <HI>globular;</HI> and the less the Particle is, the
more perfect the <HI>Spheres,</HI> so that its very <HI>least
Particles</HI> must on that Account be perfect
<HI>Spherules,</HI> as is evident by fine <HI>Microscopes.</HI>
3°. The Smoothness and consequent Softness
of these Particles on sensible <HI>Animal</HI> Sub∣stances,
they having no <HI>Points</HI> to tear <HI>Ani∣mal
Fibres</HI> and <HI>Tubes,</HI> and by their <HI>Globosity</HI>
touching them in a Point only; and this is
evident from its great <HI>reflective</HI> Virtue, every
the least <HI>Globule</HI> being a perfect <HI>Speculum.</HI> 4°.
Its readily answering, by this extreme Small∣ness
of its Parts, the least Impulse; for on the
least Compressure between smooth polish'd
Glasses, it readily flies into perfect <HI>Spherules,
innumerable</HI> and <HI>invisible,</HI> even to the finest
Glasses; so that the least Heat or Action puts
it into Motion, as is evident from its Ascent
in Glass <HI>Tubes,</HI> or in an <HI>Alembic,</HI> not so
readily indeed as Water or Air, (for that were
supposing it to act contrary to the universal
Law of <HI>Gravity</HI>) but by reason of this Small∣ness
of its Particles, and its greater Degree
of <HI>Attraction,</HI> more readily in Proportion to
its Density and Gravity than any other Fluid.
5°. Its greater Degree of <HI>attractive</HI> Force and
<PB N="121" REF="138"/>
Adhesion to some Bodies or Particles of Mat∣ter
more than to others, as to <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Salts</HI>
of all kinds; which probably may arise from
the Smallness of their <HI>Pores,</HI> which can only
receive and retain so small <HI>Particles</HI> as those
of <HI>Mercury</HI> probably are. These are sensible,
known and acknowledged Properties peculiar
to <HI>Mercury,</HI> from whence all its great and
salutary Effects on Animal Bodies may be
readily explain'd and render'd intelligible,
without running into Finenesses and Sub∣tilties,
and these salutary Effects are indeed
great and many.</P>
<P>§. 9. THE great <HI>Art</HI> required to make
<HI>Mercury</HI> the most useful, salutary and bene∣ficial
possible, in the several Cases propos'd,
is, 1°. To divide it into the smallest Particles
possible, and then to unite it with some other
<HI>Medium,</HI> which may keep these Particles
separated, and at a Distance from one an∣other,
so as not to be readily united again
into larger <HI>Globules</HI> or Clusters, by which
means it may be more easily introduc'd into
the smallest <HI>Fibres,</HI> and capillary <HI>Tubes,</HI> by
the Force and Course of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> to
render them pervious, dissolve their obstruct∣ing
Slime, and carry it out of the Habit by
the Common Shore (the <HI>Guts</HI>) or the
Emunctory, Urinary or Perspirative Drains,
which Qualities make the proper and peculiar
Excellency of <HI>Mercury</HI> above all other Me∣dicines.
<PB N="122" REF="139"/>
When it is given <HI>crude</HI> and in Sub∣stance,
or in its grosser Preparations, <HI>i. e.</HI>
without Chymical Fire; beyond all Doubt
(as we see daily by its sensible Effects, and
sometimes by its visible Appearance in Sub∣stance
on the Surface of the Skin) some of its
smallest Parts, by their Mobility, <HI>attractive</HI>
Force to one another, and ready Ascent, pass
through the whole <HI>Habit,</HI> not only in the
Course of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> but even through
the Sides of the Tubes themselves, through
the <HI>Membranes</HI> and <HI>parenchymatous</HI> Sub∣stances:
But then this Effect is not so soon,
so readily and effectually produc'd in the
crude Substance, as in some of its Prepara∣tions,
where it is minutely divided, and its
Particles kept separated and at a Distance from
one another, to enter singly the small Tubes.
2°. To endeavour to make the <HI>Medium</HI> of
the Division, this Cover and Shell of the Par∣ticles,
and the Matter they are united with, as
<HI>salutary</HI> and conducive to the <HI>Intention</HI> of the
<HI>Cure</HI> as possible; or to mix the Particles of
the <HI>Mercury</HI> with some <HI>vegetable</HI> or <HI>mineral</HI>
Substance, that has been found by Experience
<HI>specific</HI> in the Distemper given. This will be
more plain, in running through some of the
most common Preparations of <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P>§. 10. THERE is scarce a Body or kind of
Matter with which <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> with Labour
and Art, may not be incorporated or inti∣mately
<PB N="123" REF="140"/>
mixt. It may be united either with
<HI>Salts</HI> by <HI>Chymical</HI> Fires, as in <HI>Sublimat, Pre∣cipitat,
Calomel,</HI> and the like; but as the
<HI>Salts,</HI> when thus divided, have a strong <HI>Sti∣mulus,</HI>
are extremely active, and so necessa∣rily
produce very violent Pains and Evacua∣tions
of all kinds, <HI>qua data Porta,</HI> I think
they are extremely dangerous in delicate Con∣stitutions,
and tender Bowels; especially if they
must be long continued, to alter the whole
Mass, and perform the Cure of a great and
stubborn Distemper: All of this kind I call
Mercurials <HI>cum Stimulo.</HI> 2°. Or with <HI>Sul∣phur,
Antimony,</HI> Sugar-candy, Turpentine,
Crabs-eyes, and the like; especially such Bodies
as are harmless, and not violently active Medi∣cines,
and are not so ready to run the Patient
into great <HI>Evacuations,</HI> and consequently
more proper for tender Bowels, and weak
Constitutions, when design'd as <HI>Alteratives.
Sulphur</HI> in <HI>Aethiops</HI> indeed will gripe and
purge there, but this is readily prevented, by
joining equal Quantities of <HI>Crabs-eyes, Crocus
Martis, Astringens</HI> or proper <HI>testaceous</HI> Pow∣ders,
which by their absorbent Quality will
make this an admirable, easy and safe Medicine,
I think, above all others, if long continued, as
I have often found with great Pleasure. <HI>Cin∣nabar</HI>
native, but especially recent, and much
levigated, and <HI>factitious</HI> also, is as safe and
easy as Sugar, but must be long continued to
produce any sensible Benefit, being weak,
<PB N="124" REF="141"/>
though of all the Preparations it is the most
proper, and will at last have the safest and best
Effect on very slender Habits, because tender
Constitutions are more easily alter'd. The
<HI>Alcalisatus,</HI> by the strong <HI>Friction</HI> required
to unite the <HI>Mercury</HI> with the <HI>Crabs-eyes,</HI>
divides it the most minutely; and by the
natural Porosity of the <HI>Crabs-eyes,</HI> there are
prepar'd <HI>Celluls</HI> to separate and retain them
asunder, whereby it would be the most safe
active Preparation hitherto, I think, found
out; but that, like <HI>Calomel,</HI> from its infinite
Division, and the Smallness of the Particles,
it is apt to <HI>salivate,</HI> if given in any Quantity
without interspers'd <HI>Cathartics:</HI> But every
Preparation of <HI>Mercury</HI> hitherto in Use will
do the same, except <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> and therefore
must be watch'd. But, I think, the most
effectual way of administring <HI>Mercury</HI> to a
given Distemper, is to unite and combine it
(by Pounding, Rubbing, or with Fire) with
that specific Medicine, that has been found
most effectual in that <HI>Disease:</HI> Thus, for Ex∣ample,
in the <HI>Scurvy, Gout, Erysipelas</HI> and
cutaneous <HI>Defedations,</HI> plain <HI>Quicksilver,
Aethiops,</HI> or <HI>Alcalisatus</HI> well rubb'd into
<HI>Gum Guaiac,</HI> and join'd to an <HI>Aloetic,</HI> will be
found the most effectual Remedy: In <HI>Hy∣sterics,</HI>
these join'd to <HI>Gum</HI> Pills, with an
Aloetic, or Extract of the <HI>Bark,</HI> or of wild
<HI>Valerian</HI> with <HI>Millepedae,</HI> these, I say, in such
a Case will do great Matters: In <HI>Obstructions</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="142"/>
of the <HI>Menses, Aethiops</HI> with <HI>Steel,</HI> does
excellently: In Intermittents, <HI>Mercury</HI> with
<HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Steel,</HI> either in Substance, in an
Electuary: Or in Pills, as with the Extract of
the Bark and Salt of Steel: In an Inflamma∣tion
of the Eyes, <HI>Aethiops</HI> with <HI>Millepedae</HI>
and the <HI>lenitive</HI> Electuary, or the <HI>Electu∣arium
Diacassiae cum Manna,</HI> join'd with <HI>Milk</HI>
of <HI>Sulphur;</HI> and the same in the Piles, or Hae∣morrhoidal
Inflammations and Tumours: In
the <HI>Erysipelas,</HI> and every other Inflammation,
and in Disorders of the Stomach and Bowels,
<HI>Aethiops,</HI> or <HI>Alcalisatus,</HI> with Rhubarb
in Pills, or in an Electuary: In a <HI>Rheu∣matism,
Aethiops</HI> or <HI>Alcalisatus</HI> with <HI>Gum
Guaiac</HI> in large Doses: In the <HI>Sciatica,
Aethiops</HI> or <HI>Alcalisatus</HI> with boil'd <HI>Tur∣pentin:</HI>
In the <HI>Jaundice, Aethiops</HI> or <HI>Alca∣lisatus,</HI>
with <HI>Venice Soap,</HI> or the <HI>Sapo Philo∣sophorum,</HI>
and with Lime or calcin'd Egg-shells:
In an <HI>Anasarca</HI> or even beginning <HI>Ascites,
Aethiops</HI> or <HI>Alcalisatus,</HI> with <HI>Resina Ja∣lapii;</HI>
and so in other <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers.
All I intend here, is, that supposing the Pre∣parations
of <HI>Mercury</HI> do attenuat the Juices,
and open Obstructions the most readily and ef∣fectually
of any thing known, that then another
Medicine or Medicines may be joined to it,
that is known or acknowledged to be most
effectual in the Disease given. I neither set
down Forms, nor determine Concomitants;
that must always be under the Direction of
<PB N="126" REF="143"/>
the <HI>Physician</HI> in Ordinary, without whom
no one in their Senses ought to venture on
<HI>Mercury,</HI> either Simple or any-how prepar'd;
for it is either a <HI>divine Antidote,</HI> or may
become dangerous by a wrong Manner of
using it, without due Regard to the <HI>Case,</HI> and
the <HI>Patient,</HI> as well as the Form. But judi∣ciously
and properly manag'd, <HI>ponderous</HI> Me∣dicines,
and <HI>mercurial</HI> Preparations, are not
only the sole universal <HI>Attenuants</HI> and <HI>De∣obstruents,</HI>
but also the most simple, natural
and efficacious Destroyers of Viscidity and
Acidity, or whatever salin <HI>Cachexy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of MILK, its Nature and several Kinds.</HEAD>
<P>§. 11. I HAVE given the Preference in a
low Diet, both from Observation
and Experience, to <HI>Milks,</HI> viz. <HI>Asses, Mares,
Cows, Goats,</HI> and <HI>Womens,</HI> all of them ex∣cellent
in their Kind, and preferable in this
Order: <HI>Milk</HI> is a <HI>Medium</HI> between young
<HI>Animal</HI> Food and mere <HI>Vegetables. Milk</HI> is
white Blood already made, adjusted to all the
<HI>Meanders</HI> of <HI>Circulation,</HI> and prepar'd by the
Hand of Nature, and intended and <HI>signatur'd</HI>
by its <HI>Author,</HI> for the cureing, nourishing and
fortifying of weak, tender and diseased <HI>Ani∣mals.
<PB N="127" REF="144"/>
Asses</HI> Milk needs no Concomitant,
but in extremely <HI>bilious Stomachs;</HI> and I
question whether <HI>testaceous</HI> Powders join'd
with it, does not hurt, instead of benefiting
the Patient; if it purges, or even curdles,
that is of no great Disadvantage to the Pa∣tient,
if he is not quite gone; for that <HI>Curd∣ling</HI>
shews great Redundancy of <HI>Gall,</HI> and an
inflammatory State in the <HI>chyliferous Tube,</HI>
which requires Vomiting, Purging, and Cool∣ing,
which the <HI>Asses Milk</HI> will do most gently
and safely in some; and in a short time these
Effects will cease, or may be easily removed
by a little <HI>Decoctum Fracastorii</HI> at Night, or
<HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, or <HI>Bristol,</HI> or any
chalky Water, for common Drink, when these
Symptoms exceed. But to be useful in very
tender Cases, <HI>Asses Milk</HI> ought to be esteem'd
<HI>Food</HI> rather than <HI>Physic,</HI> and taken accord∣ingly;
and tender Persons, especially in inflam∣matory
Cases or Diseases, with acute Pains,
ought to live on it, and take it in such Quan∣tities
as they can bear. All <HI>cacochymic</HI> con∣sumptive
thin <HI>atrophous</HI> Persons ought to
enter upon it directly, and continue it twice
or three times a Day, till they are quite reco∣vered;
for I know nothing in Nature that
will so soon recover and plump up the <HI>mus∣cular</HI>
Flesh and Habit, as <HI>Asses Milk</HI> long con∣tinued;
for all Chyle that nourishes must first
be reduced to the Nature and Consistence of
<HI>Asses Milk,</HI> else it will never kindly pass into
<PB N="128" REF="145"/>
the <HI>Lacteals.</HI> I say nothing of <HI>Mares</HI> Milk,
because it is not much in Use in <HI>England,</HI>
though much admired in <HI>Eastern</HI> Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>§. 12. SOME Persons have a natural Aver∣sion
to <HI>Cows Milk;</HI> with others it curdles,
and either binds too much, or purges, or so
inflates and comes off in <HI>Phlegm,</HI> that they
cannot take it without abundance of Pain and
Suffering, which is an infinite Loss to them,
it being the safest, gentlest and most certain
and universal <HI>Antidote</HI> in all <HI>chronical</HI> Dis∣tempers,
without Exception of one. The only
certain way to make it agree, is first to cleanse
the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> by <HI>Vomits,</HI> or an Aloetic
Pill now and then, mixing the <HI>Milk</HI> at first
with <HI>Bristol,</HI> or any other soft, but <HI>chalky</HI>
Water, making it into a Gruel or Pudding
with Seeds, as <HI>Barley, Oats, Wheat, Sago,
Rice,</HI> and the like, putting sometimes a
Spoonful of White Wine to it; making
Bread into Biskets with sweet Cow Milk,
without <HI>Yeast</HI> or <HI>Salt,</HI> with a quick Fireing,
taking little at a time, but often; or, lastly,
putting a Spoonful of Compound Peony-water
into a Quart, or a Tea Spoonful of
Spirit of Hartshorn to a Pint; and thus gra∣dually
carrying off the Load, Heaviness,
and Flatulence or Tumult it seems to raise,
which entirely proceeds from the ill State of
the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels,</HI> that by a Distemper
<PB N="129" REF="146"/>
are loaded with <HI>Wind, Choler</HI> and <HI>Phlegm,</HI>
where the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers are inflamed
greatly, the <HI>Glands</HI> tumid, the <HI>Lacteals</HI> ob∣structed,
the <HI>Perspiration</HI> stopp'd, the Blood
<HI>viscid,</HI> and all the <HI>Functions</HI> in a ruinous
State; and not from the Nature of <HI>Milk,</HI>
which is the mildest, softest, most nourishing,
and salutary of all Foods; and the vulgar
Error of its being <HI>Phlegmatic,</HI> is from its be∣ing
the best and most effectual of all Balsa∣mics
and all Lambatives: As we see it is
form'd by the Hand of Nature, for the Young,
that is, the Weak and Tender; and there is no
real Difference between a weak tender <HI>Ani∣mal</HI>
by <HI>Nature,</HI> and one made so by a <HI>Dis∣ease,</HI>
but that the Case is much worse in the
<HI>last</HI> than the <HI>first,</HI> and therefore this natural
<HI>Antidote</HI> is more necessary in it: And I never
knew one who labour'd and endeavour'd
heartily at it, but at last overcame these Dif∣ficulties
to his great Pleasure and Satisfac∣tion,
unless the Case was totally gone:
Drinking a little Green Tea, or tepid <HI>Barley</HI> or
<HI>Bristol</HI> Water, when it oppresses, will help it
off and relieve. What makes <HI>Milk</HI> at first so
disagreeable, painful and oppressive, is the
inflammatory <HI>bilious</HI> and <HI>acrimonious</HI> State of
the Stomach and Bowels, which presently
turns the <HI>Milk</HI> into a hard cheesy Curd, and
sends off the Whey into the <HI>Lacteals</HI> too
thin and too fast: Nothing in <HI>Milk</HI> but the
sweet white <HI>Whey,</HI> that is, the <HI>Serum,</HI> with the
<PB N="130" REF="147"/>
lightest and smallest Particles of the Curd,
nourishes, or can enter the streight and invi∣sible
Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals;</HI> and hence only
is the nutritive Virtue of <HI>Asses, Womens</HI> and
<HI>Mares Milk,</HI> and <HI>Goats-whey.</HI> Strong <HI>Runnet,</HI>
or any strong Acid, will turn <HI>Milk</HI> into a hard
cheesy <HI>Curd,</HI> which will neither come up
nor go down without much Labour,
Struggle, and Oppression, especially in weak
or <HI>bilious</HI> Stomachs; weak <HI>Runnet</HI> will make
a tender <HI>Curd,</HI> which will easily slide off: So
that the whole <HI>Art</HI> of making Milk agree
with any Stomach, is to prevent its turning
into too hard a <HI>Curd,</HI> which any <HI>Alcali</HI> will
do, Sugar, Crabs-eyes, <HI>Chalk,</HI> the <HI>volatil</HI>
Spirits, and the like. As the <HI>Viscera</HI> cool,
and the <HI>Choler</HI> lessens, the Disorders from
<HI>Milk</HI> evanish. However, I should advise
those whose Stomach abounds with <HI>Bile,</HI> and
so is in an inflammatory State, to live on
Seeds, mealy and soft Roots, and well-dress'd
Vegetables, for some time, especially those who
have bad <HI>Livers,</HI> and an Overflowing of the
<HI>Gall;</HI> for as to <HI>consumptive, scrophulous, scorbu∣tical,
diabetical</HI> and <HI>cancerous</HI> Cases, Milk and
Seeds are the best <HI>Antidot,</HI> and seldom dis∣agrees.
I have been told of two <HI>Pigs,</HI> fed one
with the same Quantity of <HI>Milk,</HI> the other with
sweet <HI>Cow whey;</HI> the last became the fattest,
whitest and sweetest. But the most infallible Re∣medy
is for a long Time to chew a little good
<HI>Bark</HI> at Noon, and some <HI>Rhubarb</HI> at Night con∣stantly,
<PB N="131" REF="148"/>
at least till this Difficulty is overcome:
The <HI>first</HI> gives a Tension and Spring to the
Coats of the <HI>chyliferous</HI> Tube, the <HI>second</HI>
does not only the same, but also carries off
the Load and Superfluity from it, before it ac∣cumulats
and acidulats too high. <HI>Sweet Cow-whey,</HI>
or <HI>Orange-whey,</HI> is an admirable <HI>An∣tidot</HI>
in <HI>scorbutic</HI> and <HI>cacochymic</HI> Habits, in
<HI>bilious</HI> Vomitings, and <HI>hectic</HI> or low feverish
Cases: It is preferable to most, if not all
sorts of Diet-drinks, <HI>antiscorbutic</HI> Juices or
<HI>Ptisans;</HI> and they who would, at least all the
Summer Months, drink a Quart of this, more
or less, half in the Morning, and half at
Night, would go a great way to prevent <HI>au∣tumnal</HI>
Fevers, violent gouty <HI>Paroxysms</HI> in
Winter, <HI>scorbutic</HI> and <HI>scrophulous</HI> Humours
and Defedations, and <HI>cachectic</HI> Juices; espe∣cially
if some particular Plant, as <HI>Scurvy-grass,
Ground-ivy, Colts-foot, Baum, Sage,</HI>
or the like, were infus'd in it, or a little Milk
of Sulphur (in case it is not of itself too
<HI>purgative</HI>) were first taken in a Spoonful of
it.</P>
<P>§. 13. <HI>GOATS-MILK,</HI> or rather its
<HI>Whey,</HI> is a wonderful Strengthener and Clean∣ser.
It is surprising to me, that our Country∣men,
after they have heard of the many great
<HI>Cures</HI> in deplorable Cases, perform'd by the
drinking of <HI>Goats-whey</HI> in <HI>Scotland, Ireland</HI>
and <HI>Wales,</HI> with a proper <HI>Regimen</HI> of Diet,
<PB N="132" REF="149"/>
Air and Exercise, do not more generally apply to
it at first in low consumptive, wasteing, <HI>scorbutic</HI>
and <HI>cachectic</HI> Cases, or in all viscid or <HI>inflam∣matory</HI>
Juices. It was in great Esteem among
ancient <HI>Physicians;</HI> and the <HI>Goats,</HI> feeding in
a pure Air, and high Places, on the most
tender, light and <HI>aromatic</HI> Plants, must com∣municat
a <HI>Spirit, Balsam</HI> and Sweetness to
the <HI>Whey,</HI> and consequently to those that use
it freely and plentifully, and accordingly we
find its <HI>Efficacy;</HI> it gently purges, opens,
cleanses, cools and <HI>balmifies;</HI> and must surely
be a more natural and gentle Diluent than
any <HI>artificial</HI> Diet-drink whatsoever; and in
<HI>scorbutic, bilious</HI> and <HI>inflammatory</HI> Cases, is a
most sovereign <HI>Antidot.</HI> But it is common
to see the most obvious, natural and simple,
but most beneficial and sanative Things
slighted and overlooked, while new, foreign,
costly and complicated ones, are admired:
But Time and Suffering will give Wisdom
and Experience, if any thing will.</P>
<P>§. 14. I SHOULD here say something of
<HI>Womens Milk,</HI> which is indeed most natural
and <HI>homogeneous</HI> to human Bodies in very
low <HI>consumptive</HI> Cases, and is found extreme∣ly
beneficial in them; not only to the Young
and Tender, but to the Ancient Tender,
and the Middle-aged, worn out by Diseases.
This <HI>Milk</HI> would be infinitly more beneficial
and salutary, were it not for the <HI>rank,</HI> high,
<PB N="133" REF="150"/>
foul Feeding and common Uncleanliness of
<HI>Nurses,</HI> and such low-condition'd Persons.
If Nurses liv'd on Cows-Milk, Seeds, Roots
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> well dress'd, and drank no∣thing
but Toast and Water, or <HI>Barley-water,</HI>
or unfermented Liquors, and were kept clean
and sweet, their Milk passing through infi∣nitly
more fine and delicat <HI>Strainers</HI> than
those of any <HI>brute</HI> Animal, would be a real
<HI>Nectar</HI> in <HI>Atrophies, paralytic</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI>
Cases: But on the contrary, as Things are
now constituted, <HI>Nurses</HI> are the most hu∣morous,
voluptuous and domincering Persons
in a great Family; and if Food and Nutri∣ture
can have any Influence on the Body, Hu∣mours
and Passions of the <HI>Child,</HI> I think it as
necessary to have a healthy, clean, sober,
<HI>Nurse,</HI> as such a <HI>Mother,</HI> for the <HI>Heir</HI> of a
Noble Family; since it is certain the Child
is fed and increas'd as much, and is longer
under the Influence of the <HI>Nurse's</HI> Juices
and Humours, than it is confin'd in the
<HI>Mother's</HI> Bowels; and without all Doubt, the
Body, <HI>Humours</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI> partake of the
<HI>Materials</HI> with which Children, and even
grown Persons, are fed and nourish'd, as con∣stant
Experience and Observation testify; and
I should rather confine my Child to the inno∣cent
and undiseas'd Nourishment of Water-gruel,
Cow-milk, and Seeds, than to the Milk
of a foul, rank, luxurious and vitious <HI>Nurse.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">REFLECIONS on the Nature and General
Method of Cure of Chronical Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. I HAVE said in the former Parts
of this <HI>Treatise,</HI> that none can be
long, or grievously ill, who has
good-condition'd Blood and Juices, except
from accidental or <HI>epidemical</HI> Distempers,
from an habitual <HI>Mal-Regimen</HI> of Diet, or
one which is improper for the Party, or from
<HI>meseraic</HI> Obstructions, or <HI>scirrhous</HI> abdominal
Glands. The most universal, efficacious and
<PB N="136" REF="152"/>
adequat Cause of Distempers, is a constant
and habitual Neglect of the sole universal
Antidot, or Preservative against Diseases,
<HI>viz.</HI> the LIGHTEST and the LEAST of
Meat and Drink a Man can be tolerably easy
under. If the Person has brought into the
World a <HI>Taint</HI> of his Parents corrupt Juices,
or a natural Tendency of the Animal <HI>Salts,</HI>
Spirits, and Blood <HI>Globules,</HI> to run into
Clusters, to unite, and be compress'd, that is,
to beget foul and sizy Blood; and if he does
not duly and properly prosecute a thinning,
low, cool, <HI>balsamic</HI> Regimen, gentle Evacu∣ations,
and sweetening <HI>alterative</HI> Medicins,
but goes on in the common <HI>high Diet</HI> of the
<HI>Voluptuous,</HI> and the Excesses of those who are
born healthy and strong, and with sweet
Juices, he may be ailing, sickly, and tender
all his <HI>Life-time;</HI> and if the Corruption and
Malignity of his Juices have proceeded so far
as quite to spoil some of the great and noble
<HI>Viscera,</HI> or putrify the <HI>Canals</HI> themselves, he
must soon and infallibly die. But if one has
come into the World duly form'd with sweet
Blood and Juices, (like that of a Lamb) but
by a constant Neglect of the <HI>Lightest</HI> and
the <HI>Least,</HI> spoils and corrupts his Blood and
Juices <HI>himself,</HI> the Effect will be gradual, and
by many slow Steps and Degrees, and with
different Circumstances, according to the na∣tural
Formation and Habitudes, and the Na∣ture
of the Materials of which the Excesses
<PB N="137" REF="153"/>
committed consist. If the <HI>Structure</HI> of the
<HI>Lungs</HI> be too streight originally, the Breast nar∣row
in its accidental Formation, the <HI>Sternum</HI>
too sharp, or if there be <HI>Tubercules,</HI> or Warts
in them originally, or an Adhesion to the
<HI>Pleura,</HI> or if the <HI>bronchial</HI> Arteries be too
narrow, or its <HI>Vesicles</HI> too small, or the Ribs
be compress'd; then by a viscid <HI>Serum</HI> or sizy
Blood begot from such a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> the Cir∣culation
labours or is interrupted <HI>there,</HI> and
an <HI>Asthma, Phthisis, Pleurisy</HI> or <HI>Peripneu∣monia</HI>
ensues, which terminat in an <HI>Em∣pyema,
Consumption</HI> or <HI>Dropsy.</HI> The same
<HI>sizy</HI> Blood, and viscid <HI>Serum,</HI> if the <HI>Lungs</HI> be
tolerably strong and well-form'd, (which cor∣rupted
Juices always first try to break, and
hence the vulgar Notion, that <HI>Colds</HI> are the
universal Cause of Diseases) will stop in the
<HI>capillary</HI> Arteries, and Veins, which causes a
<HI>Rheumatism,</HI> universal or particular: If thro
their natural Strength and Spring, all the
small Vessels are not obstructed, then the most
sizy and inflammatory Part is thrown on these
<HI>Organs</HI> and Limbs, where the <HI>Capillaries</HI> are
most compress'd, and least roomy, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Joints,</HI> and so produces the <HI>Gout.</HI> If the
<HI>Serum,</HI> besides its Size, be full of <HI>Salts</HI> and
<HI>Sulphurs,</HI> then come <HI>cutaneous</HI> Foulnesses
and Inflammations, as <HI>Erisipelas, scorbutie
Eruptions, Leprosy, bilious</HI> Ulcers, and the
like. If a particular <HI>Organ,</HI> as the <HI>Liver,</HI> be
obstructed, or naturally ill form'd, (as too
<PB N="138" REF="154"/>
large, hard and unyeilding) the <HI>Bile</HI> stagnats
and is corrupted in it, and <HI>biliary</HI> Concre∣tions
or Stones are formed in the <HI>Gall-blad∣der,</HI>
and so a <HI>Jaundice</HI> ensues. If the whole
Mass of Blood and Juices be corrupted, and
no one particular Part is weaker than another,
but the whole <HI>System</HI> of both <HI>Solids</HI> and
<HI>Fluids</HI> is disorder'd, the Juices sizy, and the
Solids putrified, broken, or relaxed, all the
<HI>animal</HI> Functions labour; and thence the
whole Train of <HI>nervous, hysterical, scorbu∣tical</HI>
and <HI>hypochondriacal Symptoms</HI> arise.
But universally all these Diseases come from
spoil'd, viscid, <HI>salin</HI> or <HI>inflammatory</HI> Juices, as
their primary and productive Cause, or what
is commonly meant by a scorbutic Habit;
at least all the Good the best <HI>Physicians</HI> can
do, is on these Juices; the Solids we can but
little alter after Maturity.</P>
<P>§. 2. IN all Cases where there is a quick
strong <HI>Pulse,</HI> or where there is a weak quick
<HI>Pulse,</HI> though small, but oppress'd, or <HI>la∣bouring,</HI>
if it continue, and the Head aches,
or is confused; in all <HI>inflammatory</HI> Cases,
such as <HI>Erysipelas,</HI> the <HI>Rose,</HI> a painful <HI>Rheu∣matism,</HI>
a <HI>Pleurisy,</HI> or the like; in all Cases
attended with violent or acute Pain, be
where it will; in almost every Case of a Dis∣temper,
(if nothing absolutely forbid it) in the
<HI>first Instance,</HI> Bleeding is absolutely fit and
indispensable; and in painful Cases with a
<PB N="139" REF="155"/>
quick Pulse, it ought to be plentiful at first, and
repeated once or twice, or oftener, till the
Pain abates, and the Pulse subsides; for in all
such Cases, the Blood is either <HI>too much, too
hot,</HI> or <HI>too sizy,</HI> and generally all together:
As to the particular Vein or Artery (if neces∣sary)
whence the Blood is to be taken, it is
of no great Consequence; but for a present
Relief, the nearer the Part principally affected,
the better. But I should always prefer, in Chro∣nical
Cases, small and <HI>partial</HI> Bleedings, often
repeated, to too large and plentiful ones; in
every Case, and even in <HI>eruptive</HI> and <HI>gouty</HI> Cases,
the Eruption will be sooner and fuller, and
the <HI>Gout</HI> become more regular on Bleeding,
if it is not too large; the Veins and Arteries
thereby become more roomy, the Resistance
in the Circulation is less, the Force of the
Heart, and of the <HI>muscular</HI> Coats of the
Blood-vessels, becomes greater, in Proportion
to the Resistance of the less Quantity of <HI>Blood</HI>
remaining, thereby to accelerat the <HI>Circula∣tion,</HI>
and forcibly to throw the peccant Hu∣mours
on the Parts Nature designs them, the
most remote from the noble <HI>Organs:</HI> And
when any of the mentioned <HI>Symptoms</HI> subsist,
I think a Repetition of Bleeding ought not
to be hesitated upon, which, timeously and free∣ly
perform'd, has saved many a Life. <HI>Half</HI> a
Pound, or a <HI>whole,</HI> or even <HI>Two</HI> Pounds at differ∣ent
Times, out of Thirty, or perhaps Forty or
Fifty in the Whole, will never bring any one into
<PB N="140" REF="156"/>
a Disease, or real Danger; for Diseases are in the
bad Blood, and Life will be carried on, and even
very tolerably, (at least for a time) if the great
<HI>Organs</HI> of Sanguification be sound and strong,
even with <HI>Asses Milk, Chicken-water,</HI> or
even <HI>Water-gruel,</HI> running only into the
Blood, which will at last, by the Laws of <HI>San∣guification,</HI>
turn into good Blood, as we
know from great Wounds, the Experiments
of <HI>Transfusion,</HI> and violent <HI>Haemorrhages.</HI>
Lowness, Faintness, and a Disability of Mo∣tion,
may ensue on too great Bleeding, which
ought not to be practised, but only small
frequent <HI>Phlebotomies;</HI> and these Lownesses
are not Distempers that will endanger Life or
Health; and by a proper <HI>Regimen,</HI> the Case
will be constantly much mended from the
better Mass of Blood remaining: And it is
not an unpleasant <HI>Speculation</HI> to observe, that
by the <HI>Mechanism</HI> of the Body, when a <HI>Vein</HI>
is open'd with a large Orifice, every <HI>Phlebo∣tomy</HI>
draws out a larger Quantity of the vis∣cous
or bad Blood than of the good or fluid
Blood, in Proportion to the whole remain∣ing
Mass; because in the running Mass the
bad, <HI>i. e.</HI> the lightest Blood, by the circular
Pression of all Fluids, is thrown outwards to
the Sides of its containing <HI>Tubes;</HI> and the good,
<HI>i. e.</HI> the heaviest Blood, runs in the Middle,
as is demonstrable from the Laws of <HI>Hydro∣statics;</HI>
and by Experience we find frequent
Bleeding will exhaust all the sizy Blood at last.
<PB N="141" REF="157"/>
If on a partial Bleeding (which, if in my
Power, I always premise to the ordering of
Medicins, if for no other Reason, yet to in∣quire
into the State of the Juices and <HI>Viscera,</HI>
which, when perform'd with a large Orifice,
I prefer to the <HI>Pulse,</HI> the <HI>Tongue,</HI> the <HI>Urine,</HI>
and the <HI>Dejections</HI> all together, to form my
Indications) the Blood be tolerably good, the
Proportion of the <HI>Grume</HI> to the <HI>Serum</HI> pretty
near equal, the <HI>Grume</HI> not very viscid, and
the <HI>Serum</HI> not much discolour'd, nor saltish,
then I conclude, after the <HI>Universalia,</HI> a <HI>Re∣gimen,</HI>
and Medicins for strengthening and
winding up the Solids, with Air, Exercise and
domestic gentle <HI>Purgations,</HI> will do the Bu∣siness,
and I have seldom seen <HI>Prognostics</HI>
from such Appearances fail. But on the con∣trary,
if the Blood, when let out of a large Ori∣fice,
and quite separated, has a <HI>Buff</HI> or blueish
Skin on the Top, is liverish, the <HI>Serum</HI> dispro∣portion'd,
discolour'd and <HI>saltish,</HI> to a great
Degree, then I am satisfy'd the Patient will
never be quite well, nor continue long in an
uniform and durable State of Health, without
sweetening, thinning and mending his Blood;
and then I order (with a Diet) some Prepara∣tion
of the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines, with the
Juice of some antiscorbutic or alterative
Plants, proper and specific for the Complaints
and <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and a daily or familiar and gentle
<HI>Evacuation,</HI> to rectify these, and at proper
Distances during the <HI>Cure,</HI> partial and small
<PB N="142" REF="158"/>
<HI>Phlebotomies</HI> repeated, to draw out the <HI>old
Mass</HI> of corrupted Blood, as they can bear it;
and to give Room for a new <HI>Chyle</HI> from pro∣per
and <HI>specific Food,</HI> to supply its Place, such
as may readily assimilat and mix with the
morbid Juices, and rectify the whole Mass;
and it is not to be imagin'd how much these
frequent and small <HI>Bleedings</HI> contribute to
quicken and accelerat this thorough Change
and <HI>Assimilation,</HI> if discreetly managed. Sup∣pose
but an Ounce of proper well-digested
and comminuted <HI>Chyle</HI> or Milk, (which we
know is already <HI>good Blood</HI>) can assimilat
with and be retain'd in the whole Habit, nay,
suppose but a Dram a Day, (which I fear is
more than will be allow'd in very bad Cases)
the Loss of a few Pounds of Blood by such
partial and small <HI>Phlebotomies</HI> will be repair'd
in much less than Six, at least Twelve Months
time, with an equal Quantity of sweet pure
Blood, which will go a great way to rectify
the whole Mass, and lessen all the <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
except possibly that of Lowness, which how∣ever
will also be much reliev'd; and if the
<HI>Phlebotomies</HI> be prudently and properly
tim'd, may be very little or none at all, espe∣cially
when the Blood is very bad: So that,
on the Whole, gentle, partial and regulated
<HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> as the Patient can bear, or the
Case indicats, is one of the most general,
effectual and expeditious Operations in the
<HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers. For I never
<PB N="143" REF="159"/>
once saw any real Hurt ensu'd on Bleeding,
that I could rationally ascribe solely to <HI>Bleed∣ing,</HI>
and not to the Nature of the <HI>Distemper;</HI>
and I was never much frighted for any kind
of <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> in any Part, unless it was
with extreme Violence, if the Patient would
submit to a proper cool Regimen of Diet; for
under a <HI>Diet</HI> not forcing or feeding the <HI>Hae∣morrhage,</HI>
the Blood will stop of itself, when
the Vessels are duely emptied, or the Super∣fluity
of their <HI>morbid Blood</HI> has run off,
Sweet Blood being the most sovereign of all
animal <HI>Styptics: Hectics</HI> and <HI>Consumptions,</HI>
in their first Stages, may be effectually pre∣vented
or cured by such partial <HI>Phlebotomies</HI>
timeously administred; but in the subsequent
<HI>Stages</HI> they will only precipitat their Fate.
Some <HI>Physicians</HI> have alledg'd, that there is
no certain <HI>Prognostic</HI> to be made of the
State of the Patient, or Nature of the Dis∣temper,
from the Appearances of the Blood
on letting, because they have observ'd from
the commonly esteem'd <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad</HI> Blood,
the same or various and unaccountable <HI>Sym∣ptoms</HI>
have ensu'd, and so seem'd not to de∣pend
on it. But these <HI>Gentlemen</HI> may with
as much Reason dispute the Evidence of our
Senses in other Cases: We know good or bad
Blood by the same <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Criterions,</HI> that
we judge of our Meat and Drink: Good
Blood, such as I have defin'd it, may have
happen'd in a bad Case; but then the <HI>Glands</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
of Secretion or <HI>Perspiration</HI> have been ob∣structed,
or the Solids have been relax'd,
tainted or spoil'd, or the Blood still bad in the
<HI>Capillaries, Lymphatics</HI> and <HI>Glands,</HI> or the
<HI>Regimen</HI> has been too rich, or too much.
With what I call bad Blood, a Man may go
on, when of strong Solids or <HI>Nerves,</HI> for
some time, but <HI>precariously,</HI> and never in any
Degree of perfect Health, which he can never
have, till the <HI>Blood</HI> is render'd sweet, thin
and <HI>balsamic,</HI> and all the <HI>Glands</HI> open and
pervious, and the <HI>Secretions</HI> regular and uni∣form;
and in this alone perfect good Health
consists, which the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least</HI>
only can beget and maintain.</P>
<P>§ 3. I AM bold to say, no Operation, Re∣medy
or <HI>Antidote</HI> in <HI>Physic,</HI> is so universal,
speedy and effectual as <HI>Vomits,</HI> when they
can be given with any Safety, at least in these
our <HI>Northern Climats.</HI> I know not the
Name or Kind of a Distemper afflicting the
<HI>animal Machin,</HI> where <HI>Vomits</HI> are not bene∣ficial,
salutary, and of Efficacy; because almost
all our Diseases proceed from too <HI>much</HI> and
too <HI>strong</HI> Meats and Drinks. It is a known
<HI>Fact,</HI> that <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the Father of <HI>Physic,</HI>
advis'd for <HI>Prevention,</HI> the <HI>fat</HI> Patients to
vomit twice a Month, and the <HI>lean,</HI> once.
<HI>Vomits</HI> not only throw off concocted Impu∣rities
directly from the <HI>Stomach,</HI> the <HI>Pylorus,</HI>
and the <HI>Glands</HI> about the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and <HI>Heart,</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="161"/>
(the Source and Spring of Life and Motion)
but by their Concussion and Convulsion, act
upon the most distant <HI>Veins, Arteries,</HI> and
<HI>Glands,</HI> and break open and squeeze every
Part of the <HI>Machin. Vomits</HI> are in Diseases
what <HI>Bombs</HI> are in besieging <HI>Forts;</HI> they are
in <HI>Physic,</HI> and the <HI>internal</HI> diseas'd Parts,
(which cannot be otherwise reach'd) what
Dressing, Cleansing, <HI>Cauterizing,</HI> or even <HI>Am∣putation,</HI>
respectively are in external <HI>Surgery,</HI>
without which the internal <HI>Sores</HI> would grow
foul, <HI>gangrene</HI> and <HI>mortify.</HI> To be afraid or
hesitate in giving proper and proportion'd
<HI>Vomits</HI> in internal Distempers, is as absurd as to
neglect or fear proper Dressings and Cleansings
in outward <HI>Wounds</HI> and <HI>Sores;</HI> for in bilious
and phlegmatic <HI>Stomachs</HI> all the <HI>Glands</HI> are
little <HI>Ulcuscula,</HI> and there is as little Hazard
of weakening these Organs employ'd in Vo∣miting,
as there is of weakening the Arm or
Leg in dressing an <HI>Ulcer</HI> in them, all the <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
and Limbs being animated Parts; and
when the noxious Humour is remov'd, they
heal and strengthen of themselves, by the
Laws of <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Nutrition.</HI> Indeed
the <HI>Stomach</HI> itself has none, or but a very
small Share in the Act of <HI>Vomiting;</HI> it is the
<HI>Muscles</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> or <HI>Breast</HI> alone, that
compress the <HI>Stomach</HI> to throw out its Con∣tents;
and the <HI>Stomach</HI> is no more hurt or
weaken'd by the Action of <HI>Vomiting,</HI> than a
<HI>Clyster-bag</HI> is, by the <HI>Apothecary's</HI> squeezing
<PB N="146" REF="162"/>
it artfully to inject its <HI>Contents.</HI> It is a seem∣ing
frightful Operation, and attended with
some Pain and Sickness to the <HI>Patient;</HI> but
it is the most beneficial and salutary, and
of the most immediate Relief of any <HI>Ope∣ration</HI>
in <HI>Physic;</HI> as is evident from what has
been observed; for the <HI>Too-high</HI> or <HI>Too-much</HI>
being the universal Cause of most <HI>British</HI>
Distempers, and these incrassating the Blood
and Juices, and so interrupting the <HI>animal
Functions,</HI> whatever will so compress,
squeeze, and force open the internal <HI>Organs</HI>
and <HI>Glands,</HI> as to make them the soonest
throw off their <HI>Crudities</HI> and <HI>Mucus,</HI> and
<HI>grind</HI> and dissolve the viscid Juices, will soonest
and most effectually relieve; for all the morbid
<HI>Mucus</HI> must be discharg'd from the Insides of
the <HI>Canals,</HI> before a dureable Relief or Cure
can be expected; and this <HI>Vomits</HI> alone can
do. I can think of no Case wherein they
cannot, and ought not to be attempted, and
persisted in, as the <HI>Symptoms</HI> return, but
an <HI>Haemorrhage, Haemoptoe</HI> or <HI>Rupture</HI> of
some Vessel, and even these I have known
perfectly cured by <HI>Vomits;</HI> and if a gentle,
unsickening, easy Manner or <HI>Medicin</HI> for a
<HI>Vomit</HI> were found, I think it would be of the
greatest and most universal Service in <HI>British
Physic:</HI> But I fear it is contradictory; for the
more active and forcible they are, the more
beneficial they will be: And I know none
preferable to the <HI>Indian</HI> Root, and its Prepa∣rations,
<PB N="147" REF="163"/>
join'd to a few Grains of <HI>Tartar,</HI> or
Drams of Wine <HI>Emetic,</HI> as the Case and Pa∣tient
require; or a Decoction of the bitter
Plants, and even urging with the Finger, or a
Feather, in relax'd <HI>Stomachs</HI> or <HI>Glands,</HI> if
often at a time and daily repeated, give infinit
Relief.</P>
<P>§. 4. NOTHING I know, or have tried,
can supply the Place of a <HI>Vomit,</HI> when fit or
necessary, but <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> or some of its
Preparations, such as <HI>Calomel, Alcalisatus,
Aethiops,</HI> and the like, join'd with a Purga∣tive,
as <HI>Pilulae Ruffi, Cochiae Minores, de
Aloe lot.</HI> Jalap, Rhubarb, or the like. Quick∣silver
well kill'd, with any proper Mucilage,
and a Purgative join'd, is the same with <HI>Belloste</HI>'s
Pills, found so effectual in many Cases, which
thus may be much more properly fitted to the
Patient and the Case, than these general Quack
Medicins can be. These, some time continued,
will by Degrees open the <HI>Glands,</HI> to make
them spue out their gross and superfluous Con∣tents,
and carry off by their Weight, and deob∣struent
Powers, the Crudities and Superfluities
of the Stomach and Bowels. But they will nei∣ther
do it so soon, so effectually, nor so dureably
as <HI>Vomits</HI> repeated, according to the Indications
of Nature from the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a <HI>Nausea, Op∣pression,
Flatulence, Watchfulness, Sickness,
Inquietude</HI> and <HI>Inappetency;</HI> and both toge∣ther,
I think, no cureable chronical Distemper
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
could withstand. However, in Persons fear∣ful
of <HI>Vomits,</HI> or where from a Rupture, or
other forbidding Indication, they cannot be
safely given, these are the only efficacious
Medicins that can supply their Place; at least,
I think, they must be of this Tribe or Nature,
fitted nicely to the Delicacy of the Patient, and
the Nature of the Distemper; and I will venture
to affirm, that all the <HI>Quack</HI> Medicins of any
Virtue or Efficacy, however diversify'd, have
had <HI>Mercury</HI> in some Preparation, <HI>Antimony,</HI>
and its Preparations, or some of the more dan∣gerous
mineral Medicins, (as <HI>Arsenic</HI> or <HI>Cobalt</HI>)
with or without one kind of <HI>Carthartic</HI> or an∣other,
for their <HI>Base.</HI> For <HI>mineral</HI> Medicins
seem design'd by Nature for high Feeders, and
strong Constitutions; and Vegetable ones, or
mineral Waters, (as well as a vegetable Diet)
for weak and delicat Constitutions, especially
when already under a low or <HI>vegetable Diet;</HI>
and I am of Opinion, the more simple the
<HI>Mercurials</HI> and <HI>Cathartics</HI> are, both are the
better and safer. I think the Practice of Me∣dicin
has receiv'd great Benefit from the now
experienc'd and familiar Use of <HI>Quicksilver,</HI>
and its various Preparations; especially since
the universal Prejudice and Terror of it, and
of its being appropriated to one Distemper
only, is so worn off; and it is now under the
Management of those who understand its Na∣ture
and Operations, and that of the <HI>animal Oeco∣nomy.</HI>
Plain Quicksilver is certainly as inno∣cent
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
and safe as <HI>Asses Milk,</HI> if judiciously and in
proper Cases prescribed. I have often known
it do no manner of Good, but never knew
it do much Hurt, unless over-dos'd, or with∣out
interspers'd Purgatives, or given in an im∣proper
Case. In <HI>asthmatic</HI> Cases, <HI>scrophulous
Ulcers,</HI> in <HI>Tumours,</HI> Foulnesses, and <HI>Obstruc∣tions</HI>
of the <HI>alimentary</HI> Tube, of the <HI>Mesen∣tery,
Lacteals</HI> and other internal <HI>Viscera,</HI>
swell'd and scirrhous <HI>Glands</HI> in any Part of
the Body, a <HI>Leprosy</HI> or <HI>Scurvy,</HI> and viscid
Blood and Juices, I think, <HI>Hydrargyrum
distillatum,</HI> properly combin'd, is Sovereign,
and the true <HI>Panacea</HI> appointed and mark'd
out from its own <HI>Signature</HI> by Heaven; for it
is the only known simple Fluid except Water
and Air: Nothing but a <HI>low Diet</HI> can equal
its Efficacy, and both, judiciously join'd, will
<HI>cure</HI> every Distemper <HI>cureable.</HI> I do not know
if it would not be beneficial even in <HI>cancerous</HI>
and <HI>scirrhous</HI> Cases, at least at first, especially if
the scirrhous and cancerous <HI>Glands</HI> were cut out,
and the <HI>corrupted</HI> Part could possibly be quite
taken away; for there can be no Danger but
from its <HI>Gravity,</HI> and that might be prevented
by small <HI>Doses,</HI> its deleterious Qualities being
none; for it is never changed into any other
Nature by Mixture or Division, but always
resolves itself into <HI>similar</HI> lesser Parts of the
same <HI>specific</HI> Nature. It would at least mend
the whole Mass of the Juices, and open all the
Obstructions, except in that particular <HI>Gland</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
or <HI>cancerous</HI> Part; all the Ill it could do even
there, would be from an <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> or
<HI>Haemoptoe,</HI> or its Bursting; and if the Blood
is mended, that would be none at all: But I
should not advise it, till the corrupt Part was
cut out, if possible. But in no <HI>cancerous</HI>
Case whatever can <HI>Quicksilver-water</HI> hurt;
but on the contrary, long and obstinately
persisted in, and drunk plentifully, will do all
that any other <HI>Preparation of Mercury,</HI> or
the crude itself can do, without any Possi∣bility
of Danger, especially join'd with a <HI>total
Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> which timeously begun,
I think, would antidote any cancerous Hu∣mour
whatever. I am assured of a perfect
Cure of a Cancer in the Tongue, which had
resisted an Infinity of all Sorts of Medicins,
cured by liveing eighteen Months on Asses
Milk solely and only.</P>
<P>§. 5. THE safest and most effectual way
of takeing <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> is after it has been
distilled, well wash'd with Salt and Water,
and pass'd throgh Chamois Leather, to purge
it of all its <HI>heterogenous Mixtures,</HI> (with
which the Dealers in it <HI>sophisticat</HI> it, and
render it not only often ineffectual, but ex∣tremely
pernicious) to take it in a Quill or
clean <HI>Tobacco-pipe,</HI> about half an Ounce
Morning and Night, and once a Week a
gentle <HI>Stomach</HI> Purge of a Scruple or half a
Drachm of Jalap with Nutmeg, (in <HI>asthmatic</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="167"/>
or <HI>anasarcous</HI> Cases) or of the Pill <HI>Ruffi,</HI> or
<HI>Cochiae Minores,</HI> with a third Part <HI>Quick∣silver</HI>
well incorporated, or <HI>de Aloe lot.</HI> or
<HI>Rhubarb,</HI> in <HI>nervous, stomachic,</HI> or <HI>scrophu∣lous</HI>
Cases, to prevent its lodging in the
Glands or Plicatures of the <HI>Guts,</HI> and to
carry off all the Foulness, that it may disen∣gage
or force off from the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and to
prevent its salivating, which this Management
will do (for we have now certain Evidence,
that it will pass through every Pore, and even
through the solid <HI>parenchymatous</HI> Substance of
every Bowel and <HI>Membrane,</HI> when got to the
Capillaries, and smaller Arteries, more readily
almost, than it will through <HI>Chamois</HI> Leather);
and with it, in very bad <HI>cachectic</HI> and <HI>cacochymic</HI>
Habits, and <HI>cancerous</HI> or <HI>scrophulous</HI> Cases, to
direct a total Milk and Seed Diet, and Absti∣nence
from fermented Liquors; and even in
middling Cases, and Disorders of the <HI>ali∣mentary
Tube</HI> only, to direct a very cool, low
Broth or white Meat Diet, or rather that
which I call the <HI>trimming</HI> or middling Diet,
of one Day white <HI>animal Food,</HI> and another
<HI>Milk and Seed Meats,</HI> without fermented
Liquors. Thus manag'd, <HI>Quicksilver</HI> would
perform great Cures, as I have seen; and in
bad Cases, where it has done nothing, I greatly
suspect, it has been because it has not been thus
manag'd, <HI>viz.</HI> with a low, or Milk and Seed
Diet, and interspers'd Stomach Purges.</P>

§. 6. IF there be a <HI>Panacea</HI> or <HI>Universal
Remedy</HI> in Nature, especially in Cases not
quite gone, where the <HI>Viscera</HI> are not intirely
spoil'd, and the Blood not turn'd into a <HI>Fish-glew,</HI>
with a <HI>Serum vitriolic</HI> or <HI>arsenic,</HI> I
think these three Medicins judiciously com∣bin'd,
duely dos'd, and sufficiently persisted
in, come nearest to it, <HI>viz. Alcalisatus,
Aethiops,</HI> or <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> or some one or other

much, or over-heat) made into Pills, or into
an Electuary, with Conserve of Garden Scurvy∣grass,
or Rob of Elder, and a Decoction of the
Woods, or the <HI>Gout Diet-drink</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> § 21. Chap. II.</NOTE> sweeten'd,
with Milk drunk after it, join'd to a low
Diet. These mild <HI>Mercurials</HI> will most
effectually attenuat and dissolve the Viscidity
of the <HI>Grume</HI> of the Blood: at least, I think,
I may defy the Wit of Man to suggest a Mean
or Medicin more likely to effect it, either
from its own Nature and Qualities, or more
confirm'd and approv'd by Experiment. The
<HI>Guaiac</HI> will by its <HI>Gum</HI> and <HI>Balsam</HI> sheath the
<HI>Salts</HI> of the <HI>Serum,</HI> or soften and dissolve
them, and throw them off by the Pores of
the Skin in a gentle <HI>Diaphoresis,</HI> or <HI>Perspi∣ration,</HI>
and intestinal Evacuation; and the <HI>Salt
of Steel</HI> will keep up the Tension of the
<PB N="153" REF="169"/>
<HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>Solids.</HI> These long continu'd,
with a Decoction of the Woods, or the Gout
Diet-drink before-mentioned, or small <HI>Spruce∣beer</HI>
of the same Intention, as used in <HI>New-England,</HI>
will do all that <HI>Physic</HI> can do, in
Cases not extremely bad, and come to the
last Stage; particularly in <HI>cacochymic</HI> Cases in
general; for it is well known what <HI>Guaiac,</HI>
its <HI>Gum,</HI> its <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Wood</HI> have done in
<HI>venereal, scrophulous</HI> and <HI>scorbutic</HI> Cases,
where the Juices are vitiated to the most ex∣treme
Degree; and the attenuating, discutient
and deobstruent Nature of <HI>Camphire</HI> in small
Doses is now well known. The same Pur∣pose
may be obtain'd by the <HI>Pilul. Aethiop,</HI>
wash'd down with a few Spoonfuls of the <HI>Tin∣ctura
ad Stomachicos</HI> in Water, in the <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>
Dispensary, in gentler Cases. But nothing
will do without a cool, low and sweet <HI>Re∣gimen;</HI>
and when Air and Exercise is join'd,
and these long persisted in, it is almost all, I
think, <HI>Mortality</HI> will admit.</P>

<P>§. 8. FOR a present Relief on extreme

<PB N="155" REF="171"/>
of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Sal Volatile,</HI> and a few Drops
of <HI>Oleum Succini</HI> added to it. A Tea Spoon∣ful,
two or three of this, in a small Draught
of the above Apozem, will sooner, more
effectually and longer give Relief to these
Symptoms, than any thing I know: Even your
Cordials of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and the like, I
think, are only dry Drams, and they are scarce
Reliefs, and not Cures. With this Intention
only these perspiratory, hot and forceing Me∣dicines
ought to be given, and no Hope or
Expectation is to be put in them further, but
as one who stands to draw his Breath only for
a Moment, when he has a steep Hill to
ascend: But the whole Stress of the Cure is
to be put in <HI>Alteratives</HI> and Diet; for such
stimulating <HI>Medicines</HI> then become of won∣derful
present Benefit; but they ought to be
laid aside, when any Relief is got by them,
till the next <HI>Attack,</HI> and the general Method
and Medicines pursu'd, otherwise their Effi∣cacy
by frequent <HI>Use</HI> will be worn out. As
to the Effect of these Medicins on any sud∣den
Attack of Lowness, Oppression, Anxiety,
or <HI>nervous Dyspnea,</HI> (if a Sickness at Stomach
is not, as it mostly is, the <HI>Case,</HI> and then they
ought to be taken in some Cordial, and after∣wards
some <HI>Stomach Purge</HI> ought to succeed,
or a <HI>Vomit</HI> premitted, if Time allows) they,
as all the <HI>Eastern Gums, Foetids</HI> and <HI>Volatils,</HI>
force the Perspiration for a short Time, and
drive the viscid Juices to the Circumference,
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
and by their <HI>actual</HI> Heat melt perhaps the
<HI>gelatin Serum</HI> in the Capillaries (as Fire
melts <HI>Jelly</HI> of <HI>Hartshorn</HI>); for there can be
no Virtue in Soot, but from the actual Fire
lodg'd in it, or from its <HI>acid Oil;</HI> the one of
which melts the <HI>gelatin Serum,</HI> while the
other vellicates the Solids to force on the lan∣guishing
<HI>Circulation,</HI> which makes it of more
present Efficacy than even <HI>Assa-foetida</HI> itself,
and the Eastern Gums alone, which have shut
up in them <HI>solar</HI> Heat, or Fire, or the Matter
(perhaps) that makes the Rays or Fluid of the
<HI>Sun's</HI> Heat. Of this Class also are the <HI>vola∣til
Salts,</HI> which, I think, on this Considera∣tion,
are preferable to the <HI>Eastern Gums:</HI>
The <HI>Gums</HI> are solar Rays included in a viscous
<HI>Balsam; Soot</HI> and <HI>volatil Salts</HI> are culinary
Heat join'd to an Acid; and hence alone the
<HI>Philosophy</HI> of their Operation and Effects is
to be deduc'd. For there is no material Differ∣ence,

Diet, either Vegetable, or of white Meats,
with little or no fermented Liquors, will do
great Matters, as I have often experienc'd. For
on Bleeding, (and frequent small <HI>Phlebotomies</HI>
ought to be interspers'd) though the Blood be
sizy, with a thick <HI>Buff,</HI> and the <HI>Serum</HI> yellow

time continu'd, will infallibly alter it, or
sheath its <HI>Salts,</HI> make its Curd more thin and
<HI>florid,</HI> and its <HI>Serum</HI> of a less dark Colour,
rebate the Violence of the Pains, and bring
natural Sleep, Ease and Chearfulness, as I have
visibly and sensibly seen, and is a constant
and undeniable <HI>Fact,</HI> especially if the Cor∣ruption
be not too deep, and the Constitution
has ever been tolerably good and firm, and
Life not too far spent. But the Effect will
be more readily obtain'd, if <HI>Vomits</HI> and <HI>mer∣curial</HI>
Purges, as of <HI>Calomel</HI> with <HI>Resin</HI> of
<HI>Jalap,</HI> be interspers'd, as the Strength of the

<PB N="158" REF="174"/>
Antiscorbutic</HI> Juices, will do great Service,
especially if the Distemper be recent, and the
Person strong. The <HI>aluminous</HI> and chalky
Waters will help this Case much, (especially
if the <HI>Sores</HI> be fluid and running) particularly
those not combin'd with much <HI>Iron,</HI> but with
<HI>Talk</HI> and <HI>Nitre,</HI> or <HI>Alum,</HI> as those of <HI>Holt</HI>

interspers'd, but especially if a <HI>white Meat</HI>
Diet, and Abstinence from all fermented Li∣quors,
be join'd, I think the Method cannot
fail. But in very tender Cases, and in the
<HI>Fair Sex,</HI> (to whom cutaneous <HI>Defedations</HI>
are more grievous and mortifying, and who
are not able to bear these active and strong
Medicines) nothing will do so effectually as
unwash'd <HI>Diaphoretic Antimony</HI> with <HI>Milk of

even the <HI>Lepra Graecorum</HI> and <HI>Arabum</HI> could

not long resist this Method, especially with a
total Milk or Vegetable Diet. In such Con∣stitutions
the <HI>Meshes</HI> of the <HI>Cutis</HI> and <HI>Cuti∣cula,</HI>
and the Orifices of the <HI>perspiratory

corrode the Scarf Skin, and there produce
corrosive <HI>Foulnesses.</HI> Some learned Professors
promis'd a Cure to weak Persons by Woods,

begun by an <HI>Intermittent</HI> Fever not after∣wards
duely treated by the altering ponderous
Remedies, and a <HI>Regimen,</HI> which alone can
obviate their ill Effects, not of the Intermit∣tents,
(for all <HI>acute</HI> Distempers, and indeed all
Distempers whatever, are a Labour of Nature
to purify the Juices, according to the common
Saying, <HI>Dolor est Medicina doloris</HI>) but the
bad State of the Fluids, which causes them;
and therefore they may come into my De∣sign
<PB N="160" REF="176"/>
of treating here of <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers
only; especially since they have been so vari∣ous
and complicated of late Years. Indeed
almost all <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers admit of these
<HI>Periods</HI> in some Degree or another: The <HI>Gout,</HI>
the <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> but especially those called
<HI>nervous</HI> Distempers, have generally one Day
or more worse, and another better sensibly.
As to a true, simple, genuine <HI>Intermittent,</HI> it
is most infallibly the <HI>Struggle</HI> and Labour of a
<HI>sizy</HI> Blood, when a great Part of the <HI>Size</HI>
has been gradually accumulated, and collected
towards the Middle of the small Passage from
the <HI>Arteries</HI> into the <HI>Veins,</HI> or the lateral
Branches of both; for the <HI>Arteries</HI> converg∣ing
gently, many of them terminat in the
<HI>Veins</HI> in one continued <HI>Tube,</HI> (except the la∣teral
ones, which form the <HI>Glands</HI>) which
again gently diverging (at least the <HI>Trunk∣pipes</HI>)
form, as it were, a double <HI>Cone:</HI> The
Blood, when sizy, passing with Difficulty this
middle narrow Space, (like the Waters of a
River, when the Chanel is narrow, and con∣tracted
in one particular Place) rages, and runs
with <HI>Impetuosity;</HI> and the thinnest getting
through first, the <HI>Size</HI> is by Degrees left in
the wider Part of the <HI>Tube,</HI> till the Whole
of it comes to be collected at this narrow Pas∣sage.
Then, by Force of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and <HI>mus∣cular</HI>
Coats of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> the Whole of the
new-gather'd Mass of this <HI>Size</HI> being forc'd
to pass there also, by the Laws of the <HI>Circu∣lation,
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
Nature</HI> and the whole <HI>animal Oeco∣nomy</HI>
labours to effect it: hence first the <HI>Chill,</HI>
and <HI>Rigours</HI> in this Labour of Nature, because
little warm Blood can reach the <HI>Capillary</HI>
Veins and Extremities. This Stage must
always be attended with a <HI>quick Pulse,</HI> tho'
the Patient may be in the <HI>Chill</HI> of Death, which
shews the <HI>Heart</HI> and muscular Coats of the
<HI>Arteries</HI> are in violent Action and Labour,
while the <HI>Size</HI> is thus discharging thro' this
narrow <HI>Pass.</HI> By this means the <HI>Size</HI> is in a
great Degree dissolv'd and broken; and then
entering into the wider Veins, the <HI>Serum</HI>
being render'd thinner, is made capable to be
thrown off with Violence by the lateral
Branches, and the Orifices of the <HI>perspiratory
Ducts.</HI> The finest of its broken and watry
<HI>Particles</HI> get through, and the serous Parts of
the Blood are thus discharged by a profuse
<HI>Sweat.</HI> This is not an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> but the
real and true <HI>Theory</HI> of simple and uncom∣pounded
<HI>Intermittents,</HI> founded on Experi∣ment,
which tho' are infinitely varied and com∣plicated
according to the Degree of the <HI>Size,</HI>
the Constitution and Age of the Patient, and
many other Cirumstances, which I have not
room to detail. <HI>Vide Hales,</HI> Part II.</P>
<P>§. 12. When an <HI>Intermittent</HI> happens, the
Patient is not in the worst State of Blood
and Juices; that may subsist in a great many
other Cases and Distempers, particularly in the
<PB N="162" REF="178"/>
<HI>Gout, Rheumatism, Jaundice, Scurvy, Ana∣sarca,
Asthma,</HI> and the like, especially in
their last Stages. I have known an <HI>Intermit∣tent</HI>
happen, when the Blood has been in
a much better State, than it was before; <HI>viz.</HI>
after useing the proper Means of alterative
<HI>Ponderous</HI> Medicins, and a low Diet to mend
it. I always take it for a certain Sign of Con∣valescence,
and a dureable Mending, when it
happens in a very bad Case; and to be pro∣duced
mostly and immediatly by the greater
Relaxation of the Solids, especially when
under a cool low Diet, which the <HI>Bark</HI> and
other <HI>Astringents</HI> quickly mend and wind
up. In simple <HI>Intermittents,</HI> and young sound
Constitutions, any thing that will constringe
the <HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> to give them a little
more Spring and Force, so as to make the <HI>Size</HI>
pass through the <HI>Streights</HI> easily, or discharge
it by the perspiratory Ducts, will do: as Juice
of <HI>Lemons,</HI> a Decoction of <HI>Chamomil Flow∣ers,</HI>
or of <HI>Acorns:</HI> or the Powder of these;
any <HI>astringent</HI> Vegetable, or <HI>Mineral</HI> will
do it; as <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> of <HI>Nitre,</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI>
of Sea Salt, Tinctures of <HI>Steel, Spa, Pyrmont</HI>
or <HI>Tunbridge</HI> Waters, and the like; so that it is
not the <HI>Bark</HI> alone, or the <HI>Bark</HI> as a <HI>Specific,</HI>
but the <HI>Bark</HI> as one of the best, coolest, and
most easily digested <HI>Vegetable Astringents,</HI>
that cures <HI>Intermittents,</HI> as it gives a Firm∣ness
and <HI>Elasticity</HI> to the Fibres, and unites
and gives a due Cohesion and Consistence to
<PB N="163" REF="179"/>
the <HI>Blood Globules</HI> thus broken and divided by
the Distemper, and by the Labour of Nature,
in forceing the Fluids through the <HI>evanescent
Arteries</HI> into the <HI>Veins,</HI> and through the
Strainers and <HI>perspiratory Glands;</HI> but this
the Bark, or even any of these others men∣tion'd,
will do with Certainty, in simple and
benign <HI>Intermittents,</HI> and healthy Constitu∣tions
only.</P>
<P>§. 13. IN many Cases of <HI>Intermittents,</HI>
where the Constitution is bad, and the Solids
corrupted, the <HI>Bark</HI> (of which a <HI>Drachm</HI> or
two constantly secur'd against Relapses, when
it first came into <HI>Europe</HI>) will now do nothing.
The true Reason of which is not only the
<HI>Sophistication</HI> of the <HI>Quinquina,</HI> which now
out of Avarice (as all other foreign Medicins
are) is mixt with twenty other insignificant or
perhaps pernicious <HI>Barks,</HI> which are not easily
discover'd or separated; but also from the
universal <HI>Depravation</HI> of the Blood and Hu∣mours
of Patients now-a-days, to what they
might have been formerly: Upon which Ac∣count
it is an excellent Preparative, not only
to cool and thin the Blood by previous <HI>Vomits,
Stomach Purges,</HI> and <HI>salin</HI> Juice of Lemon
<HI>Draughts,</HI> and to unite <HI>Rhubarb</HI> with <HI>Bark</HI>
and <HI>Aromatics,</HI> but also to let the Patient have
as many <HI>Fits</HI> of the <HI>Fever</HI> as he can possibly
bear, in order to attenuat and divide the
Blood in passing through these streight and
<PB N="164" REF="180"/>
narrow Passages; and by the quicker <HI>Circula∣tion</HI>
that necessarily attends it, before any <HI>spe∣cific</HI>
or strong <HI>Astringent</HI> be tried, to tighten
the Fibres, and stop the <HI>Paroxysms;</HI> and per∣haps
the very best were to leave it intirely to
such general Medicins, that it might extin∣guish
of itself; and then the Blood would be
eminently fined and thinned, and high Health
would ensue. But since the Patient will sel∣dom
submit to this so tedious a Cure, I think
there is no such certain and salutary a Method,
as in the Intervals of the Fits to administer
<HI>Vomits,</HI> and the <HI>mild Mercurials</HI> and <HI>Atte∣nuants,</HI>
together with the <HI>Bark,</HI> to mend
the Blood and Juices; and therefore I never
fail, after I have for a due time stopt the first
<HI>Paroxysms,</HI> to order <HI>Aethiops Alcalisat. An∣timony
Diaphoretic, Gum Guaiac,</HI> and Salt
of <HI>Steel,</HI> with Extract of the <HI>Bark,</HI> in some
Form or other, wash'd down with <HI>Spa</HI> or
<HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water; or a Decoction of the <HI>Bark,</HI>
to be continued for a long time after the Fits
are stopt by Astringents, together with a
Regimen and Rideing. There are some, who
in strong and robust military Constitutions
join <HI>Arsenic</HI> five or six times sublimed (which
only divides its Parts) with <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> and
make it up in Pills with Mucilages, and give
eight or ten or a Dozen such a Day. But I
am never for Snuffing a <HI>Candle</HI> with a <HI>Can∣non</HI>
Ball, when a Pair of Snuffers are at hand,
which will do it more safely and cleanly, tho'
<PB N="165" REF="181"/>
perhaps not so soon. These are dangerous and
del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terious Medicins: tho' strong Persons may
bear them for a time, yet they insensibly de∣stroy
them. The Observation on <HI>Crises,</HI> and
<HI>critical Symptoms,</HI> so regular and certain, in
<HI>Southern</HI> Climats, from the Regularity of their
<HI>Seasons</HI> and <HI>Diet,</HI> will seldom take place in
our <HI>Northern Countries;</HI> tho' I think the great
Affair of <HI>Evacuations</HI> and <HI>Alteratives</HI> in
<HI>Fevers</HI> of all kinds, ought to be before they
come to their <HI>State;</HI> afterwards Nature is to
be left to its own Work, with warm <HI>Dilution</HI>

<HEAD>A SCROPHULA.</HEAD>
<P>§. 14. A <HI>SCROPHULA</HI> is a mere <HI>glan∣dular</HI>
Case; <HI>viz.</HI> where-ever an <HI>Emunctory
Gland</HI> or <HI>Glands</HI> are dureably swell'd, obstruct∣ed,
or <HI>scirrhous,</HI> whether <HI>imposthumated</HI> or not,
there is some Degree of a true <HI>Scrophula.</HI> The
<HI>Glands</HI> are the last and the least Organs of <HI>se∣rous
Secretion;</HI> the <HI>Diameters</HI> of their com∣ponent
<HI>Tubes</HI> are so insinitly small, and their
<HI>Circumvolutions</HI> and <HI>Plicatures</HI> often so nu∣merous,
that, in delicat Nerves, and tender Con∣stitutions,
the smallest inattended Injury or
Bruise, the least Degree of <HI>Size</HI> in the Blood,
will tum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy and obstruct them, or if they be ori∣ginally
or naturally lax. They have special
and particular <HI>Membranes,</HI> that coat and in∣volve
them; so that when they are tumefied
and obstructed, their <HI>excretory Duct</HI> is thereby
<PB N="166" REF="182"/>
shut up, (as a full stuff'd Purse shuts its Mouth
strongest) that it can scarce be reach'd by
Medicin, or empty'd by the Laws of the
<HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> and this Coat, thus <HI>Her∣metically</HI>
seal'd, as it were, becomes a <HI>Cystis</HI>
which can never be open'd, and nothing but
<HI>Excision</HI> can extract it; and this Cause is so
universal in all Countries where <HI>Animal</HI> Food,
and strong fermented Liquors, are too freely
used, that there is scarce an Individual that
has not these <HI>Scrophulous Glands,</HI> internally
or externally, in some one Degree or other,
sooner or later. In <HI>Britain</HI> scarce a single
Individual is without some Degree or other of
the <HI>Scrophula,</HI> or <HI>Scurvy,</HI> as the general Causes
of all their Miseries, at least after Thirty-five.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The KING'S EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>§. 15. IN early <HI>Scrophulous</HI> Distempers, (I
call the <HI>Scrophula</HI> the first <HI>Stage,</HI> and the <HI>Kings
Evil</HI> the second <HI>Stage</HI> of the same Distemper) I
know nothing of any Efficacy to extirpat
them, but the <HI>mild Mercurials,</HI> or rather
<HI>Quicksilver</HI> itself, at least <HI>Aqua Mercurialis,</HI>
with a <HI>Vegetable,</HI> or even a <HI>total Milk</HI>
Diet, both long continu'd. In such Cases,
especially in young Persons, the <HI>scrophulous
Glands</HI> are all <HI>incystated,</HI> and there is no Pos∣sibility
of opening or dissolving them. If they
are external, they may be cut out; but if in∣ternal,
(as is most commonly the Case) there
is nothing to be done, but by sweetening and
<PB N="167" REF="183"/>
thinning the Juices, and thereby hindering
their Compression from Fulness or <HI>unroomy</HI>
Vessels or Bowels, to keep them soft and
yielding, that they may not interrupt the
<HI>Circulation,</HI> or the Play of the <HI>nervous
Fibres.</HI> All the Use of dry'd <HI>Sponge, Vo∣latil
Salts, Flag root,</HI> and the like, I think,
trifling and delusive; even the <HI>Wood-drinks,</HI>
tho' most <HI>specious,</HI> are here of no great
Value. The most effectual Method I know,
have try'd, or can conceive, is a total <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Seed</HI> Diet, <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> or some of its
Preparations with <HI>Millepedes</HI> in Substance
and unprepared, together with interspersed
<HI>Purges</HI> and <HI>Vomits,</HI> which in time, if it
does not totally dissolve or extinguish these
<HI>Glands,</HI> or open the <HI>incysted Tumours,</HI> will
dry them away, and the <HI>Circulation</HI> will find
Means, and inlarge <HI>Canals,</HI> to do without
them; as the <HI>Navel-string</HI> of new-born
Infants falls away, when it is no longer of
Use; or as the Blood, when an <HI>Artery</HI> is cut
in two, in the larger Trunk, inlarges the
lateral ones, and thereby brings the same
Quantity of Blood and Spirits to nourish
and cherish the circumambient Parts. At
least the inlarged and <HI>incysted Gland,</HI> by the
consequent Fluidity, Sweetness and Thinness
of the rest of the Juices, will lie as easy,
and give no more Pain or Trouble, than
the <HI>Nail</HI> on one's Finger, unless it be <HI>tume∣fied</HI>
and blown up by a high Diet. And I
<PB N="168" REF="184"/>
think <HI>hereditary Scrophulous</HI> Persons, espe∣cially
those advanced towards the <HI>Meridian</HI>
of Life, that suffer under these <HI>Heart∣breaking</HI>
Lownesses and Anxieties, consequent
upon internal, <HI>meseraick, scrophulous,</HI> ob∣structed
<HI>Glands,</HI> are as directly call'd on by
Heaven to enter upon a <HI>low</HI> Diet, and <HI>ponde∣rous</HI>
Medicins, as if an Angel came from it to
command them; and to continue it to the last
of Life, if they would have free Spirits, and
Freedom from Pain continu'd with them.
The <HI>Aqua Argentea,</HI> or Silver Water, (which
is two Quarts of Fountain Water boil'd with
four Ounces of <HI>Quicksilver</HI> to one Quart)
with <HI>Milk, Jelly</HI> of <HI>Currans,</HI> of <HI>Oranges,</HI>
or even with a little White Wine, would
help them much: But a <HI>vegetable</HI> and

<HEAD>An ASTHMA.</HEAD>
<P>§. 16. IN <HI>Asthma's</HI> and <HI>Chronical</HI> Affe∣ctions
of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> I know no better Me∣dicin,
than purify'd Quicksilver made into
Pills with <HI>Gum Ammoniac,</HI> boil'd <HI>Venice Tur∣pentine,</HI>
or with <HI>Lucatellu's Balsam,</HI> and occa∣sionally
with <HI>Mass. Pilular. Ruffi, Cochiae mi∣nores,</HI>
or <HI>de Aloe lota,</HI> of any of these, two Parts,
and one Part <HI>Quicksilver</HI> purified, as a Purge
now-and-then, or the <HI>Pilulae Scilliticae,</HI> of
the <HI>Edinburg</HI> Dispensatory: These, long
continu'd with a soft, cool Diet, without
<PB N="169" REF="185"/>
any Liquor but <HI>Barley Water,</HI> weak <HI>Mead,</HI>
or <HI>Metheglm</HI> for common Drink, will help
much in the Cure of an Asthma in its first
Stage. <HI>Mercury</HI> here, if in any Case at all,
is a <HI>Specific;</HI> here its small Parts break the
<HI>Viscidity</HI> and Tenacity of the <HI>Serum</HI> in the
<HI>Pulmonary</HI> Vessels, and inlarge, like so many
<HI>Wedges</HI> or <HI>Stretchers,</HI> the smallest <HI>Arteries,</HI>
and widen their <HI>Diameters,</HI> to let the Blood
circulat through them, that it may there be
impregnated with the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the inspir'd
Air. This Method, long continu'd, cannot
fail to make the Fits easy, and at last totally to
cure them, as I have often seen: For the
absolute Cure of an <HI>Asthma</HI> depends on
thinning the Blood, and stretching the <HI>Pul∣monic</HI>
Arteries: <HI>Regimen</HI> can only do the
<HI>first,</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> in some Shape is likeliest
to do the <HI>last.</HI> If the Cure has been im∣perfect,
it is because this <HI>Regimen</HI> has not
been constantly and exactly persisted in; or
that the <HI>Lungs,</HI> or some of the great <HI>Viscera,</HI>
have been quite spoil'd, or that <HI>Life</HI> has
been too far advanced for a total Cure.
And by this Method, early and long persisted
in, two of the most common, yet most
fatal, Consequences of an <HI>Asthma</HI> are pre∣vented
in Persons somewhat advanced to
Maturity; <HI>viz. Insecundity</HI> and an <HI>Ascites,</HI>
the first preceding generally the last; for if
the Blood cannot freely and readily pass
through the <HI>infinitesimal Pulmonary</HI> Arteries,
<PB N="170" REF="186"/>
and between the <HI>Bronchial Vesicles,</HI> it can
never be sufficiently broken and thinn'd,
(the great End of the Compressure and
<HI>Mechanism</HI> of the Lungs, and of the Cure
of an <HI>Asthma</HI>) nor form'd into small enough
<HI>Globules,</HI> nor (which is most material) can
it be sufficiently impregnated with the <HI>Nitre</HI>
of the Air, the great Principle of its Vita∣lity;
and so being gross, grumous and vapid,
furnishes not sufficient Spirit and Vigour for
<HI>Fecundity;</HI> and not being sufficiently com∣minuted,
is not sent back with sufficient
<HI>Velocity,</HI> or, which is the same, makes too
strong a <HI>Resistance</HI> on the Extremities; so
that, by its increas'd <HI>Gravity,</HI> it cannot re∣turn
again with due Velocity and Vigour
by the <HI>Veins</HI> to the <HI>Lungs;</HI> but first stag∣nates
in the Feet and Ancles, and after bursts
the <HI>Lymphatics</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> putrifies
the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> and ouzes through the
Sides of the thin, now rotten <HI>lymphatic</HI>
Tubes and Canals. In Paroxysms nothing
relieves like Squill Vomits, or daily Thumb
Vomits, and <HI>Lac Ammoniacum</HI> in large Doses,
made on simple Penyroyal Water frequently

<HEAD>A DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>§. 17. A TRUE form'd <HI>Ascites</HI> is no more
to be cur'd, than a confirm'd <HI>Phthisis</HI> from
putrify'd <HI>Lungs</HI> or <HI>Tubercules.</HI> The <HI>Lym∣phatics</HI>
are here burst, the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> pu∣trify'd
and consum'd, the <HI>Grume</HI> of the
<PB N="171" REF="187"/>
Blood become a <HI>Clot</HI> of viscous <HI>Glew,</HI> and
the <HI>Serum</HI> a mere <HI>Lixivium.</HI> These can never
be restored, and all that can be expected in
such a State is a mere <HI>palliative</HI> Cure, to
pass off this <HI>lixivious Serum,</HI> as fast as it
drops into the Cavities, to keep the Passages
of all the <HI>Secretions</HI> as pervious as can be,
to take in things of as little Volume, and
as soft and unactive in their Nature, as pos∣sible,
and to endeavour to mend, thin and
sweeten the Blood, as much as the Nature
of the Distemper will admit; and I think
these are all the rational <HI>Intentions,</HI> that in
such a <HI>Case</HI> can be form'd. All violent
Remedies, as strong <HI>Vomits, Purges,</HI> and
<HI>Diuretics,</HI> are precipitating <HI>Fate</HI> only at the
Expence of a little present Relief; they only
empty, to fill the faster, by inlarging the
beginning <HI>Ruptures</HI> of the <HI>Lymphatics.</HI>
The acrid pungent Plants, with the cooling
<HI>acid</HI> juices, and the stimulating aperient
<HI>Salts,</HI> seem to answer this palliative Intention
best; such as are <HI>Mustard</HI> Seed, <HI>Juniper</HI>
Berries, <HI>Horse-radish, Aron</HI> Roots com∣pounded
with <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Tartar, Nitre, Worm∣wood,
Sea Salt,</HI> or the Lixivial <HI>Salts</HI> of
Plants; on which Account <HI>Mercurius dulcis</HI>
and <HI>Alcalisatus,</HI> and Salt of some diuretic
Plant, with <HI>Rob</HI> of <HI>Elder,</HI> have such sensible
Effects in this Distemper, as I have often
experienced in its first Stages, and in young
Persons; but nothing will do without a Diet
<PB N="172" REF="188"/>
of the <HI>Lightest</HI> and <HI>Least,</HI> to prevent the
forceing the <HI>Serum</HI> through the <HI>Ruptures</HI> of
the <HI>Lymphatics,</HI> or the widen'd <HI>Meshes</HI> of
the Sides of the Tubes. It is a vulgar Error,
that <HI>Water-drinking</HI> is of dangerous Conse∣quence
in this Case; nothing is more <HI>false.</HI>
Too great a Quantity of any Liquor is wrong,
because, by its Weight, it may increase the
<HI>Rupture</HI> of the <HI>Lymphatics;</HI> but this does
not happen from the <HI>Quality</HI> of common
Water, but the Quantity of it; for no Li∣quor
is of a more innocent and beneficial
Nature, so soft, light and cool, as pure Wa∣ter.
'Tis true, in such a Case, the less of
any Liquor, the better; but if any, nothing
can exceed Sherbet, of Water and Juice of
Oranges, sweeten'd with a little <HI>Honey;</HI> and
I have known many a <HI>Dropsy,</HI> in free

it being only an universal <HI>Size</HI> of the Blood

the <HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> whereby the Resistance

is thin enough, and the tumefied Parts sub∣side,
braceing with <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Bitters,</HI> or the

a Diet (at least for such a Constitution)
has been long inadvertently persisted in; or
when, in a robust firm Constitution, <HI>spirituous</HI>
and burning Liquors, and salt and <HI>high-sea∣son'd</HI>
Meats, have been obstinatly indulged;
whereby the Blood (being of the Nature of
<PB N="174" REF="190"/>
Milk) is broken and <HI>fus'd</HI> by the great
Quantity of <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>lixivious Salts</HI> in
it, which turns it, and separats the <HI>Curd</HI>
from the <HI>Whey,</HI> as <HI>Runnet</HI> turns Milk; and
so all the <HI>Serum</HI> runs off through the most
patent Passages, or the new <HI>Chyle</HI> cannot
incorporat with the old glutinous Grume of
the Blood; and accordingly, in a deep and
inveterat <HI>Diabetes,</HI> I have seen it run off
the Patient in a few Days: A constant
<HI>Thirst,</HI> a small, <HI>low, hectical</HI> Pulse, with
great Oppression and Anxiety, are the <HI>Sym∣ptoms</HI>
which distinguish it from the Floods
of pale Water in <HI>Hysteric</HI> Cases, (which
yet is of the same Nature, and differs only
from a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> as an Infant from an old
Man) which is very seldom attended with a
<HI>Thirst,</HI> at least an intense and constant one:
For as to the <HI>Taste</HI> of the Water, it will be
pretty near the same in both; only in deep
<HI>Diabetes's,</HI> the urinary Juices have a sensible
Sweetishness, being deprived of all its Salts,
which remain behind in the Mass. The
Cure of a <HI>Diabetes</HI> is by all means to pro∣cure
an Union between the <HI>Grume</HI> and the
<HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood with the new <HI>Chyle,</HI>
and to use only such Food as is already
form'd into the Nature and Consistence of
sweet Blood; and therefore, in a deep <HI>Dia∣betes,</HI>
a total Milk Diet is even more neces∣sary
than in the <HI>Gout</HI> or <HI>Phthisis. Chalky</HI>
Waters, (which may be readily known by
<PB N="175" REF="191"/>
their turning milky, upon forty or sixty
Drops of <HI>Oil of Tartar per Deliquium</HI>
pour'd into a Pint of them) as those of
<HI>Bristol,</HI> and the Lime Stone Water by <HI>Bath,</HI>
and such as no doubt may be found in many
Places where there is Plenty of Lime-stone;
<HI>Hartshorn</HI> Drink with <HI>Gum Arabic; Barley
Water</HI> with Syrup of Comfry, and all such
soft, cooling, <HI>mucilaginous</HI> Drinks, which
give a Balsam and Union to the Parts of the
Blood; a <HI>Diet</HI> of the same kind, <HI>Milks</HI> of
all Sorts, soft Seeds, white young Meats,
no <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors of any kind, and an
Electuary of <HI>Cinnabar, Bark, Rhubarb,</HI> with
the <HI>Rob</HI> of Elder, these, obstinatly and rigo∣rously
persisted in, will at last sweeten, balm∣ify
and unite the Parts of the <HI>Blood,</HI> in those
not far advanced in Life. But Errors in the
<HI>Nonnaturals</HI> are here as fatal as in a <HI>nervous
Atrophy,</HI> which constantly attends this Case;
and I know no Disease but a <HI>Phthisis</HI> that
requires greater Strictness; and I have al∣ways
observ'd, that here (as in all <HI>Ner∣vous,
Scorbutic,</HI> and <HI>Arthritic</HI> Cases, when
the Blood grows thinner, and the Distem∣per
yields) there is a Scorbutic Rash, a
<HI>Miliary Eruption,</HI> or Cutaneous Foulness,
appears all over the Habit; just as in a Fit of
the Gout, or an Intermittent, Scorbutic
Ulcers and Blotches rise and appear in a
State of Melioration of the Blood and Juices,
when the Force and <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the Solids
<PB N="176" REF="192"/>
have got in some Degree the better of the
Resistance of the <HI>viscid Fluids;</HI> and very
often a Rash, critical Ulcer, or Inflamma∣tory
or <HI>Cutaneous Eruption,</HI> unskilfully cur'd,
stopp'd, or dispell'd, has been the Cause of
a subsequent <HI>Diabetes;</HI> when Nature de∣sign'd
to throw out of the Habit the <HI>Salts</HI>
and <HI>Sulphurs</HI> of the Blood, and, by untimely
and ill-judg'd external Applications, the <HI>pec∣cant</HI>
Matter is thrown back on the Habit.
So necessary it is to understand the <HI>Animal Oe∣conomy,</HI>
to be an accomplish'd <HI>Surgeon,</HI> much

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION in the Eyes, and the HAE∣MORRHOIDS.</HEAD>
<P>§. 20. <HI>Inflammations</HI> in the <HI>Eyes,</HI> espe∣cially
after the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> or in the <HI>Hae∣morrhoid</HI>
Veins, call'd the <HI>Piles,</HI> and univer∣sally
all Kinds of Inflammations in whatever
Part, (which I take to be one and the same
Distemper on different Parts external or in∣ternal)
are to be treated with frequent gen∣tle
<HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> till the Violence and
Acuteness of the Pain ceases, with a total Abs∣tinence
from all <HI>Animal</HI> Food, and fermented
Liquors, cool Purges of the Salts with
Manna, or the Lenitive or Diacassia Electuary,
drinking plentifully sweet Cow Whey, or
the Decoction of Quicksilver in Water; and
for an extirpative Cure, and to cut off Re∣turns,
a long Course of <HI>Aethiops</HI> with
<PB N="177" REF="193"/>
<HI>Crabs-eyes,</HI> (which is the best way to hin∣der
the <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the <HI>Aethiops</HI> from

<HEAD>The GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>§. 21. THE <HI>Gout,</HI> being also a violent
<HI>Inflammation,</HI> first on the <HI>Joints,</HI> and then
over the whole Habit, (shifting from Part to
Part, till at last it fixes on the <HI>Bowels,</HI> and
internal Parts) as much as an <HI>Erysipelas,</HI> or
the <HI>Rose;</HI> is never to be greatly lessened,
much less <HI>eradicated,</HI> or extirpated, but by
<HI>Mercurials sine Stimulo,</HI> or their mild Prepa∣rations
with <HI>Gum Guaiac</HI> and <HI>Nitre</HI> long
continued, and a total Milk-diet, or Water-drinking,
with the common animal Diet;
perhaps this last alone may be sufficient, early
enter'd upon in good Constitutions, which will
certainly lessen and weaken all the after
Fits, but will not extirpat the Distemper.
All other Methods or Medicins to effect a
total dureable <HI>Cure;</HI> all <HI>Nostrums, Speci∣fics,</HI>
or Alteratives besides, are mere <HI>Trick,</HI>
or worse, to cheat <HI>Patients,</HI> and deceive
weak and credulous Persons; for nothing
but what will cure the most obstinat
and intimat of all <HI>Inflammations,</HI> or lixi∣vious,
<HI>scorbutic</HI> Habits, can relieve or cure
the <HI>Gout. Mercury</HI> is mark'd out, and sin∣gled
by the Appointment of the <HI>God of
<PB N="178" REF="194"/>
Nature</HI> to attenuat, open, deterge, and dis∣solve;
and Milk and Water, and Seeds, to
cool, nourish, and <HI>balmify;</HI> and both toge∣ther
are the only natural and necessary <HI>Anti∣dot</HI>
to obviat the <HI>Cause</HI> of the <HI>Gout.</HI> If an
<HI>Angel</HI> should propose any other Method, or
Medicin, as Nature is now constituted, he
ought not to be minded. <HI>Vegetables</HI> of the
soft, juicy, mild Kind, such as <HI>Turneps, Po∣tatoes,
young Seeds</HI> and <HI>Plants,</HI> and all
much dress'd Garden-things, are much the
same with <HI>Milk.</HI> But Milk and Bread alone
is the only certain Remedy; about three Pints
of Milk, and six Ounces of Bread in a Day.
Those who have not the Courage to pursue
this Method, or find not any great Incon∣venience
from slight and regular <HI>Fits,</HI> may
keep it ever so (or at least till towards the
<HI>Decline</HI> of Life) by a total Abstinence from
all fermented Liquors, except, perhaps, clear
unhopt Small-beer, or this Diet-drink, which
I prefer, from <HI>Experience</HI> in this Case, to all
other Kinds of Beverage: Take of <HI>Raspings</HI>
of <HI>Guaiac</HI> Wood two Pounds, (or rather its
<HI>Bark</HI> one Pound) a Pound <HI>Loaf</HI> of Bread
much bak'd, hot from the <HI>Oven,</HI> a Pound of
unbruis'd <HI>Juniper-berries,</HI> six <HI>Seville Oranges,</HI>
roasted and slic'd, and a Pound of despu∣ted
Honey; put all these in a six-gallon
Pipkin, and pour on them six Gallons of
boiling Water, let them stand six Weeks in
a warm Corner of a Room with a Fire;
strain them off through a fine Lawn on the
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
Cock into well-cork'd Bottles for constant
Drink. This, as constant Drink, and white
Meats for Dinner, with Milk Meats for
Breakfast and Supper, and gentle Stomach-openers,
as <HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> the <HI>Pil. Ruffi,</HI> or
de <HI>Aloe lota,</HI> or, which I prefer before these,
the <HI>Rheum Quinquinatum,</HI> made with <HI>Bark</HI>
one Ounce, <HI>Rhubarb</HI> two Ounces, two
roasted <HI>Oranges, Juniper-berries</HI> half an
Ounce, <HI>Snakeweed</HI> and <HI>Cochineal,</HI> each a
Drachm, in a full Quart, or thirty Ounces of
White-wine, infus'd forty-eight Hours by a
Kitchen Fire, strain'd and filtred: Of which four
Spoonfuls should be taken at Night for a Dose,
two, three, or four times a Week in the In∣tervals
of the <HI>Fit;</HI> this gently evacuats and
yet keeps the Solids tight and firm, but ought
to be taken and continued during the whole
Intervals. All hot Things, high <HI>Cordials,</HI> and
strong either Meats or Drinks, (except when
the <HI>Gout</HI> falls on the Stomach or Bowels) are
adding Fuel to the Fire; and he that uses
them will as surely suffer in Proportion, as he
that handles burning Coals, or hot Iron, will
be burnt. As to Sulphur, or rather its
<HI>Flours,</HI> I still think it an excellent Remedy
in the <HI>Gout,</HI> the most simple, safe and effe∣ctual
of any, except the Method I have now
described; as by its <HI>Stypticity,</HI> it constricts
the Vessels, and by its purging <HI>Salt and Oil</HI>
lubricats and evacuats (for Sulphur is but
<HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI>); and if a proper Regimen and
due Exercise were added to it, I am per∣suaded
<PB N="180" REF="196"/>
it would do more in Time, than any
one so simple a <HI>Medicin</HI> hitherto known,
except <HI>Quicksilver</HI> and its milder Prepara∣tions,
which, judiciously manag'd, I truly
account the <HI>Elixir Vitae,</HI> in this, and most
<HI>Chronical</HI> Distempers; but here a cool, soft,
spare Diet is <HI>nine</HI> Parts of <HI>ten;</HI> Medicin is
only the other <HI>tenth</HI> Part. Gouty Persons
have always strong Solids and Nerves, the In∣flammation,
Fever and Pain, and consequent
Abstinence in the Fits, thins the Blood, and
breaks the Cohesion of its Particles in every
regular Fit; and hence the high Spirits of the
Gouty in the Intervals, and their long Lives.</P>

<HEAD>The SCIATIC.</HEAD>
<P>§. 22. THE <HI>Sciatic</HI> is but the <HI>Hip-Gout,</HI>
and, towards a lasting and dureable Cure,
is to be treated in the same Manner, and by
the same Medicins, mentioned for the <HI>Gout.</HI>
But being in its first Stages often but To∣pical,
and that in gross <HI>Cachectic</HI> Habits, and
scorbutic Constitutions, the sharp <HI>Serum</HI> and
viscid Part of the Juices settles and gelati∣nises
in the <HI>Hip-Joints</HI> or lower <HI>Vertebrae;</HI>
and there being surrounded with bulky and
thick Muscles, and deep and large <HI>Articula∣tions,</HI>
becomes so fix'd and painful, as quite
to disable and confine the Patient, it may
require a particular Attention. And in this
Case I have never found any thing so effectual
and speedy as Pills made with <HI>Alcalisatus,
boild Turpentine, Aethiops</HI> and <HI>Nitre;</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="197"/>
these taken in a due Dose twice a Day with
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, <HI>Batheing,</HI> and interspers'd
Purges of <HI>Calomel,</HI> have seldom failed in
Time to effect a Cure, either by regular Fits
of the <HI>Gout</HI> afterwards on the Extremities,
or by a dureable Recovery from the Distemper.
But to prevent Returns, the same Method
and Medicins are to be used as in the regular
and form'd <HI>Gout.</HI> Large Doses of aethereal
Oil of Turpentine with Honey, very often
dislodges it in a few Days; but this is extremely
sickening, and strongly vomits, unless much
diluted with weak Sack-whey.</P>

<HEAD>MENSTRUAL OBSTRUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>§. 23. IN <HI>Obstructions</HI> of the <HI>Menses,</HI> and
all their slow Irregularities, I have never
found any thing so effectual, (if there was not
a deep <HI>Cachexy;</HI> tho' some Degree of one
is always necessarily attendant on such Irre∣gularities,
else they could not happen) as
some of the mild <HI>Mercurials</HI> mixt with <HI>Steel,</HI>
and the specific <HI>Emmenagogues,</HI> together
with <HI>Aloetics;</HI> as <HI>Aethiops mineral,</HI> the
<HI>Trochisci</HI> de <HI>Myrrha,</HI> and <HI>Sal Martis</HI> and <HI>Ex∣tractum
Quinquinae</HI> made into Pills; the <HI>Alca∣lisatus,</HI>
with the <HI>Pilulae Gummosae,</HI> and the
<HI>Limatura Martis,</HI> and the like; the first
by attenuating the Juices, and opening the
Obstructions; the second by balmifying
and rendering them consistent and uniform;
and the last by giving a due <HI>Tension</HI> and <HI>Ela∣sticity</HI>
to the <HI>Fibres</HI> and Coats of the Vessels.
<PB N="182" REF="198"/>
This Method, duly persisted in, fitted to the
Patient, wash'd down with <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>Spa</HI>
Waters, a Regimen, and due Exercise, will
seldom fail, if interspersed <HI>mercurial</HI> and
<HI>aloetic</HI> Purges be join'd. <HI>Rubigo Martis,
Aethiops,</HI> and <HI>Aloe</HI> made into Pills with
the <HI>Acidulae,</HI> do the same.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>FLOODINGS.</HEAD>
<P>§ 24. IN <HI>Floodings</HI> I know nothing like
the <HI>Bark, Eaton's Styptic,</HI> (which in this
Case I prefer much to <HI>Helvetius's,</HI> as being
safer, cooler, and less rough and grateing)
and the grumous Part of Sheep's Blood dry'd
and powder'd, and apply'd plentifully both
outwardly and inwardly. Every one knows
the agglutinating Quality of <HI>sweet Blood,</HI>
and I apprehend it is to this, that <HI>Eaton's
Styptic</HI> owes its soft, mild, soldering Efficacy.
<HI>Steel Preparations,</HI> even the mildest and
most liquid, are more rough, harsh, and
<HI>caustic</HI> here than is natural or fit for such
tender and delicat Parts; the other is more
mild, substantial and soft, to patch a Hole,
or glew up a <HI>Rupture,</HI> or to give a Balsam to
the acrid and inflam'd flowing Blood of the Pa∣tient;
and I am confirmed in this by a Physi∣cian
of great Worth and Candour who has great
Opportunities of dealing in such Cases by his
<HI>Practice of Midwifry.</HI> The same <HI>Method</HI>
and <HI>Medicins</HI> must be used in all <HI>Haemor∣rhages</HI>
external and internal from whatever
<PB N="183" REF="199"/>
Part; for they are all of the same Nature,
and from the same Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> an inflamma∣tory
<HI>Crase, Sharpness,</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> of the Blood;
and are seldom attended with any dangerous
Consequence in otherwise sound Habits. But
the best Medicins in the World will do no∣thing
here without a cool, soft, <HI>balsamic</HI>
Diet, of which I know <HI>Milk</HI> in this Case
to be the very best and most <HI>specific,</HI> as being
Blood itself, only without the Colour, and so
being endowed with the Quality of that very Me∣dicin
(Sheeps Blood) which I have mentioned
as most <HI>specific</HI> in such Cases; and I could ven∣ture
my Life, that he who would live on
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Seeds</HI> only for some Time, should
not be much hurt, or long suffer, by any <HI>Hoe∣morrhage,</HI>
unless some of the necessary Bowels
were hurt deeply, especially after premitting
two or three, or more <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> as the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> indicat.</P>

<HEAD>The WHITES.</HEAD>
<P>§ 25. THE <HI>Fluor albus</HI> is only a Disease
of <HI>viscid</HI> Juices, and <HI>relax'd</HI> Solids, or of the
<HI>Sphincters</HI> of these Passages, through which
the <HI>Menses</HI> pass. By the wise Contrivance
of Nature, the Cavity that receives the <HI>Or∣gans</HI>
peculiar to the <HI>Sex,</HI> is larger in the
<HI>Female</HI> than the <HI>Male;</HI> the <HI>Muscles</HI> are bigger,
and the <HI>Arteries</HI> of a larger <HI>Diameter,</HI> and
a greater Quantity of Blood is conveyed thither
for the <HI>Nutrition</HI> of the <HI>Foetus</HI> at the Time
of Breeding, which at other Times ebbs and
<PB N="184" REF="200"/>
flows monthly in healthy Females, to prevent
a <HI>Plethora,</HI> and consequent <HI>Inflammation</HI> or
<HI>Fever.</HI> In Parturiency the <HI>Foetus</HI> drains off
this Superfluity; and hence the greater
Health of delicate parturient Females, which
never lasts longer, if not critically managed.
For all the Operations of Nature, all
the animal <HI>Functions,</HI> are transacted with <HI>Re∣gularity,
Order,</HI> and <HI>Mechanism.</HI> There
are at last found visible secretory <HI>Organs</HI> in
<HI>Fundo Uteri,</HI> endow'd with proper <HI>Sphincters</HI>
for this regular and <HI>periodical</HI> Secretion in
the <HI>Sex;</HI> when the <HI>Blood</HI> is sweet, and of a
due <HI>Fluidity,</HI> the <HI>Secretions</HI> are made clean
and free, and these <HI>Sphincters</HI> shut up close,
like those of the <HI>intestinal Secretion;</HI> when
the Blood becomes <HI>viscid,</HI> or inflam'd, it
weakens or relaxes these tender <HI>Sphincters,</HI>
so that after the <HI>grumous</HI> Part, or the Blood
<HI>Globules,</HI> is secreted, the morbid <HI>Serum</HI> con∣tinues
to flow; and hence it is, that this
Distemper is rarely, or scarce ever to be cur'd,
but by a total Change of the whole Mass;
and this is the principal Cause of <HI>Infertility</HI>
and <HI>Abortion</HI> in Persons of Condition; for
the <HI>Fluor Albus</HI> arises from small Wounds
or <HI>Ulcuscula</HI> in <HI>Fundo Uteri,</HI> and must be
treated accordingly: <HI>Astringents</HI> therefore
may palliat it for a Time, but it will ever
return I know, from Reason and Experi∣ence,
there is nothing sufficient for a dureable
<HI>extirpative</HI> Cure, but what will mend, atte∣nuat,
<PB N="185" REF="201"/>
and sweeten the whole Mass of the
Juices, and brace and strengthen the Solids;
a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable,</HI> or <HI>white Meat</HI>
Diet, Air, Exercise, with the mild <HI>Mercu∣rials</HI>
and Sweeteners, and then gentle Tight∣eners
(Steel and Extract of the Bark) with cold
Batheing, are alone sufficient to perfect such a
Cure in delicat Constitutions in Time; and this
Distemper generally afflicts the most lively, the
most polite, and amiable of the <HI>Sex,</HI> and almost
always makes them <HI>infertile. Cinnabar</HI> natural
and factitious, <HI>testaceous</HI> Powders, <HI>Extract</HI>
of the <HI>Quinquina, Terra Japanica,</HI> and the
like, made into Powders or Pills, with Asses
Milk, a cool Diet of the white Meats, and
the weaker <HI>Acidulae</HI> for Drink only, are what
I have found most successful. But few will
have Patience and Perseverance to go through
with this tedious Cure, and very often by
Neglect, or a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> they turn <HI>con∣sumptive;</HI>
for this Distemper being really
internal, and from <HI>Membranous Ulcuscula,</HI> will
at last reach and affect the <HI>Lungs</HI> themselves,
and cause a <HI>Phthisis Pulmonum,</HI> as generally,
where these <HI>Ulcuscula</HI> are very malignant,
there are <HI>Tubercles</HI> also in the <HI>Lungs</HI> begin∣ning,
or <HI>meseraic scirrhous Glands.</HI></P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>A CONSUMPTION.</HEAD>
<P>§. 26. NEXT to <HI>Hysterics,</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI>
Diseases, a <HI>Consumption</HI> is the most fatal and
destructive Distemper that afflicts the Young
<PB N="186" REF="202"/>
and Delicat in this Island; and indeed there
is such a Connexion between high <HI>Hysterics</HI>
with Fits, and a <HI>Phthisis Pulmonum</HI> with <HI>Tu∣bercles,</HI>
that they generally and naturally
slide into one another; and both are the
fatal Distempers, that afflict or destroy the
noblest <HI>Spirits,</HI> and finest <HI>Genius's,</HI> of this
Island, as every one who has been attentive
must have observ'd: And I never once had
Occasion to attend to the whole Course
of a <HI>Consumption</HI> from Beginning to End,
but I constantly observ'd, that high <HI>Hy∣sterics,</HI>
and great <HI>nervous Symptoms,</HI> were
the first Stage, or <HI>Elements</HI> of a <HI>Phthisis.</HI>
And I always foretold, that these Symptoms
(especially in tender, delicat, lively young
Persons) would terminat in a real sensible
<HI>Phthisis Pulmonum,</HI> if not prevented or re∣medied;
and when the first nervous <HI>Stage</HI> of
a <HI>Consumption</HI> was not attended to, or not
remedy'd, it was never to be cured afterwards
in the following <HI>Stages</HI> or Degrees; and
hence, to a thinking, reasoning <HI>Physician,</HI>
the Necessity of a low cool Regimen in <HI>ner∣vous</HI>
Cases of any Degree, will be manifest.
And a <HI>Phthisis Pulmonum</HI> is no otherwise to
be cured, or treated, than high <HI>Hysterics,
viz.</HI> in the first Stage by the mild <HI>Mercuri∣als,</HI>
with the volatil and foetid <HI>Gums,</HI> or
<HI>Lucatellus's Balsam</HI> made into Pills, or <HI>Gum
Ammoniac</HI> malax'd with <HI>Alcalisatus, Aethi∣ops,
Cinnabar</HI> native or factitious, or <HI>Quick∣silver</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="203"/>
itself duly purg'd, <HI>Asses Milk,</HI> with the
<HI>Testacea,</HI> a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Seed Diet,</HI> Air,
Exercise, daily <HI>Friction,</HI> and cleansing after
with a coarse Cloth dipp'd in cold or warm
Water, according to the Season. If this
Method were timeously, rigidly, and obsti∣natly
persisted in, some of the noblest and
brightest Spirits this Age or Country produces,
might be preserved. But it is seldom enter'd
upon with any Exactness till it is too late, and
the Distemper has got too deep a Root in <HI>Tu∣bercles,
Ulcers</HI> or <HI>Ruptures</HI> on the <HI>Lungs;</HI>
and then a total Cure is not to be expected;
a palliative one is all that can be pretended.
In a Word, if <HI>Hysterics,</HI> as well as a <HI>Con∣sumption,</HI>
are not cured by the mentioned
Method and Medicins, there is no Possibility
of an extirpative Cure, or, indeed, any tole∣rable
Degree of Ease, but by a total <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Seed Diet,</HI> with frequent interspers'd
gentle Emetics, which will infallibly cure
totally, if any human Means possibly
can.</P>

great Abundance of too gross, and too many
<HI>Salts,</HI> and <HI>Oils,</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> mixt in the
Blood, thro' Intemperance and Excesses in
too rich and too high Meats and Drinks.
The Author of Nature wisely foresaw, that
human Creatures would not always follow,
and continue in the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least,</HI>
nor would be contented with <HI>vegetable</HI> Food,
and plain Water, but would lust after the
Blood and the Flesh of their Fellow-creatures,
and wallow in fermented, strong, and spiri∣tuous
Liquors; and therefore, to antidot
the ill Effects of such a <HI>Diet</HI> for some Time,
for a Trial of their Virtue, and to allow them
the free Use of their Faculties for a Season,
intended the wonderful <HI>Organ</HI> the <HI>Liver,</HI> the
largest, most complicated, and the most arti∣ficial
in the whole <HI>Machin,</HI> to draw and
elicit, as by an <HI>Alembic</HI> from the Blood and
Juices, the most deleterious, and poisonous
Part of these high Meats and Drinks; and
even to make the extracted <HI>Bile</HI> useful and
necessary to concoct and purify the <HI>Chyle</HI>
from such strong <HI>Aliment,</HI> and so of a real
<HI>Poison</HI> to make an useful <HI>Antidot,</HI> at least for
a Time, and in Youth-hood. The higher the
Food is, the larger the <HI>Liver</HI> necessarily
grows; and at last even so big as to fill almost
the whole Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen.</HI> The <HI>Bile</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="205"/>
not only gives a <HI>Balsam, Union, Homogeneity,</HI>
and Consistency to the various <HI>Chyle,</HI> but is the
primary and most active <HI>Stimulus</HI> to the <HI>peri∣staltic</HI>
Motion, by which the Superfluities
of the Food, and its grosser indigestible Parts,
are thrown out of the Body. In <HI>Animals</HI>
that live on <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> only, the
<HI>Bile</HI> is only like strong Elder <HI>Vinegar,</HI> or
<HI>Verjuice,</HI> with a little <HI>Animal</HI> Oil; but in
voluptuous Men it is like <HI>Oil of Vitriol,</HI> green,
yellow and black successively, and is the
<HI>secondary</HI> Cause of all the <HI>atrocious,</HI> excru∣ciating
and fatal Distempers that afflict <HI>Mor∣tality.</HI>
A temporary <HI>Jaundice</HI> seldom fails
to succeed on a violent Fit of the <HI>Colic,</HI>
which <HI>Colic</HI> is owing to the distemper'd
<HI>Bile</HI> thrown too plentifully on the small,
sensible, and tender <HI>Guts;</HI> where stagnating,
it stops the <HI>Biliary</HI> Passages, and so must re∣coil
on the Habit. I know not so speedy and
certain a Relief or Cure in a <HI>Jaundice,</HI> as
frequent repeated active <HI>Vomits,</HI> which not
only pump up the <HI>Bile</HI> collected in the <HI>Primae
Viae,</HI> as it flows, and force off small <HI>Stones</HI>
stopping the <HI>Porus Biliarius,</HI> or lodg'd in the
<HI>Gall Bladder,</HI> as I have seen frequent Vomits
do, but likewise attenuat the Juices, and
open the <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Liver</HI> itself. Plenty
of soft diluting <HI>sulphurous</HI> Water (the <HI>Bath</HI>
especially) a thin, cool, liquid Diet of <HI>Broths,
Milks,</HI> or <HI>watery Seeds, Fomentations,</HI> and
<HI>mercurial</HI> soft <HI>Plaisters</HI> on the afflicted Parts,
<PB N="190" REF="206"/>
the Liver especially, will most readily cool,
relax and open; and since the Nature of the
corrupted <HI>Bile</HI> comes nearest to a <HI>saponaceous</HI>
Solution, to supply its Place with Pills of
<HI>Alicant</HI> Soap, <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> or <HI>Aethiops,
Salt</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> and <HI>Resin of Jalap;</HI>
both to open, deterge, and sweeten the Juices,
and to scour and clear off the <HI>Mucus</HI> of the
foul internal Coats of the Vessels; great and
strong Doses of Soap taken at once I have
seen sometimes succeed; but I think it has
not been so much from its <HI>specific</HI> Virtue,
as the violent and repeated Vomitings
it excites in some Constitutions. But as
<HI>Soa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (though the best artificial <HI>Succedaneum</HI>
to vitiated <HI>Bile</HI>) is, to some, so nauseous
and sickening in the Stomach, that they can∣not
bear it long enough to have its due
Efficacy, I think the best and most effectual
general Method in <HI>Jaundices,</HI> is <HI>Vomits</HI>
often repeated, perhaps every three or four
Days at first, <HI>Rhubarb</HI> and <HI>Quicksilver</HI> made
into Pills with <HI>balsamic Syrup,</HI> wash'd down
with Barley Water acidulated with the Juice
of Oranges, and sweetened with Curran-Jelly,
or with sweet Cow or Orange-Whey, no fer∣mented
Liquor, but as a <HI>Cordial</HI> on Extre∣mities,
a Diet of Milk, Broth, or white
Meats, Air, and Exercise as they can bear,
a long Use of <HI>sulphurous</HI> Waters, with
Batheing in them, and the general Methods
for sweetening, attenuating, and opening Ob∣structions.
<PB N="191" REF="207"/>
I have seldom fail'd, if call'd in Time,
by frequent <HI>Vomits,</HI> Pills with <HI>Aethiops,
Soap,</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Wormwood</HI> wash'd down
with Orange. Whey, and a very cool, low
Diet, to bring about an extirpative Cure in
Persons of a tolerable Habit, not too far gone
in Life.</P>

<HEAD>The SCURVY.</HEAD>
<P>§. 28. I CALL that a <HI>Scurvy,</HI> or a <HI>scorbu∣tic</HI>
Habit, when the Blood and Juices are
much and throughly saturated with <HI>saline</HI> and
<HI>sulphurous,</HI> or <HI>firy</HI> Particles, with a thick
<HI>Buff,</HI> or the Curd of a liverish Consistence,
a <HI>yellow Serum;</HI> whose <HI>Symptoms</HI> are gene∣rally
an habitual white, or <HI>foul crusted</HI> Tongue,
a large red <HI>Brickdust Sediment</HI> in the Night-water,
but with great Varieties; inso∣much
that when the <HI>Perspiration</HI> is stopp'd, or
the <HI>Animal Functions</HI> labour, the Water is
<HI>pale, clear,</HI> and <HI>copious,</HI> so as to seem to
threaten a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> (and then the <HI>Hysteric</HI>
and <HI>nervous Symptoms</HI> follow quick) a Burn∣ing
in the Hands and Feet, and a preceding
Coldness or Chilness in them, <HI>Blotches,
Scales, Pimples,</HI> or Heats over the Body, in
the <HI>Breast, Back, Thighs,</HI> and <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI>
with frequent <HI>bilious</HI> Vomitings; the <HI>Serum</HI>
of the Blood is sometimes <HI>saltish,</HI> even to
the Taste, and its <HI>Grume liverish,</HI> viscid, and
cohesive, tho' perhaps without a visible <HI>Buff</HI>
on the Top; for then the Case is very bad
<PB N="192" REF="208"/>
and far gone; the <HI>Dejections</HI> are various and
uncertain, according to the Nature and
Quantity of the Food, but rarely figur'd; in∣terrupted
and broken Sleep, and scarce any
comfortable Refreshment from it; often a
<HI>Thirst</HI> in the Morning, and on some strong
<HI>Hawkings,</HI> throwing up Bits of blackish or
bluish <HI>Phlegm,</HI> after which they are easier
for the Day, tho' scarce ever in perfect, placid,
and serene Health, but always <HI>restless, anxious,
unconstant, precipitat</HI> and <HI>passionat;</HI> the
<HI>Liver</HI> is then beginning to be faulty, ob∣structed,
or <HI>scirrhous;</HI> and this is the funda∣mental
Distemper, the productive Cause, and,
as it were, the <HI>Base</HI> of all the high <HI>Hysteri∣cal</HI>
and <HI>Hypochondraical</HI> Symptoms, of all the
<HI>Vapours, Lowness of Spirits, Flatulence,
Spleen, Fits, Convulsions, Epilepsies and
Apoplexies,</HI> to which the People of Condi∣tion,
of this various, watry, and turbulent
<HI>Climat,</HI> are subject; and differ only accord∣ing
to the Frame, Age, and Manner of Living
of the Person. All these <HI>Symptoms</HI> proceed
from, and are caused by, viscid Juices, satu∣rated
and over-stock'd with too many <HI>saline,
sulphurous,</HI> or <HI>inflammatory</HI> Particles, which
first produce a Labour and Struggle of the
<HI>Circulation,</HI> and obstruct the <HI>Perspiration,</HI>
and then affect the <HI>Viscera,</HI> by making Ob∣structions
in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> whence <HI>Asthma,
Phthisis</HI> and <HI>Pleurisy,</HI> or <HI>Peripneumonia;</HI> or
in the <HI>Liver, Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een,</HI> or <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> and
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
thence <HI>Jaundice, Dropsy,</HI> or the <HI>incystated
Glands</HI> of the <HI>Breast, Abdomen,</HI> or <HI>Mesentery,</HI>
become scirrhous; and lastly the universal <HI>ner∣vous
System</HI> is thereby affected, perhaps all at
once, or sometimes one Part sooner than an∣other,
according to the original <HI>Make,</HI> and the
Degree of the <HI>Taint</HI> communicated by the Pa∣rents,
or the Materials of the Excesses. And
therefore I never knew a more proper Designa∣tion
of various oppress'd and anxious Distempers
than <HI>Scorbutico-nervose, viz.</HI> those where no
particular distinguishing <HI>Symptom,</HI> or sensibly
corrupted and spoil'd <HI>Bowel</HI> above another, was
yet discernible, so as to give them a Designa∣tion
from such a State of corrupted, viscid,
<HI>saline</HI> and <HI>inflammatory</HI> Juices, and pickled,
broken and relax'd <HI>Solids.</HI> For a <HI>palliative</HI>
Cure in its first Stages, and to keep the Dis∣temper
at a Bay, I know nothing so effectual
as drinking sweet Cow-whey, especially in the
Summer Months, chewing <HI>Bark</HI> freely in the
Forenoon, to keep up a due <HI>Tension</HI> in the
Solids, and <HI>Rhubarb</HI> at Night for the same
Purpose; and at the same time to carry off the
<HI>Secretions</HI> of the <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Alimentary
Tube,</HI> which always are discharged upon the
Common-Sewer of the Body, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>In∣testines,</HI>
and to carry off likewise new-gene∣rated
<HI>Superfluity</HI> and Fuel to the Distemper;
a light white-meat <HI>trimming</HI> Diet, little or no
fermented Liquor, but small <HI>Spruce New-England
Beer,</HI> or the <HI>Gout Diet-drink</HI> for∣merly
<PB N="194" REF="210"/>
mention'd, Air and Exercise, the Flesh∣brush
used Morning and Night, to rub off the
Salts and Scales, as they are secreted by the <HI>per∣spiratory
Ducts,</HI> and to allicit the Circulation
towards the Surface; and constantly after wash∣ing
the Body all over, and that strongly and
much, with a coarse Towel dipp'd in Water,
and drying with one well air'd; which is a
true, but a more constant and uniform cold
Batheing, without the Shock and Violence on
Nature, from Plunging. But if this <HI>Distemper</HI>
is come to great Heights, or advanced towards
its last Stages, with high, acute and anxious <HI>Sym∣ptoms,</HI>
so as to threaten an Alienation of the Fa∣culties,
insupportable <HI>Terrors</HI> and <HI>Panics,</HI> total
want of natural Rest, <HI>Fits, Convulsions,</HI> or <HI>Syn∣copes;</HI>
nothing will then do, but Milk and Ve∣getables,
for Food; frequent <HI>Vomits, Mercury,</HI>
only in its milder Preparations, applied and fitted
to the <HI>Case</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> of the Patient;
but in their most simple and natural Prepara∣tions;
with repeated small <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> which
gradually lessen the <HI>old briny Mass,</HI> and give
Room for this sweet and soft Supply, from the
Diet, to enter the Habit; and with other pro∣per
Cleansings of the Stomach and Bowels, by
<HI>Vomits, Rhubarb,</HI> or <HI>Aloe,</HI> as the <HI>Symptoms</HI> in∣dicat.
I think this the shortest, safest and
most effectual Method the Nature of Things, or
the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> will admit, in this uni∣versal
and <HI>epidemical</HI> Distemper of <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> pointed out by Reason, and justified
<PB N="195" REF="211"/>
by Experience; few or none ever failing of a
perfect Cure, or a notable Relief, in this Me∣thod
at last, who have not the <HI>Viscera</HI> intirely
destroyed, or have Time in the common Dura∣tion
of Life for a total Cure; and even in that
Case, the Pains and <HI>Symptoms</HI> will be less,
than under any other Method and Medicins,
the Time of their Dissolution will be pro∣long'd,
and their Departure render'd less vio∣lent
and torturing. Living on Milk and Ve∣getables,
drinking sweet Cow-whey all the
Summer Months yearly, will keep this Distem∣per
long under, and at a Bay; all cooling, di∣luteing
and thinning Foods will help it, parti∣cularly
living much on <HI>Lettuce</HI> in the hot
Weather, boiled or raw.</P>

<HEAD>The COLIC.</HEAD>
<P>§. 29. THE <HI>Colic,</HI> either in the <HI>Stomach</HI> or
<HI>Bowels,</HI> is generally the Beginning of some
other translateable or flitting severe <HI>chronical</HI>
Distemper, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> the <HI>Gout,</HI>
of <HI>Hysteric Fits</HI> and <HI>Convulsions,</HI> the <HI>Jaun∣dice,
Palsy, Epilepsy,</HI> or <HI>Apoplexy.</HI> A con∣stant
Heart burning, four or putrid Belching,
(as of rotten Eggs) throwing up <HI>green, yellow</HI>
or <HI>black Choler,</HI> are often its <HI>Harbingers;</HI>
which, if not remedied, seldom fail to bring
on violent Fits of the <HI>Colic;</HI> and all of them
are produc'd by Excesses in the <HI>Too-hot, Too-high,</HI>
or <HI>Too-much,</HI> in respect to the Constitu∣tion
of the Party. The Blood and Blood-ves∣sels,
<PB N="196" REF="212"/>
the <HI>Glands conglobat</HI> and <HI>conglomerat,</HI>
being then full of ill-condition'd Juices
and Chyle, will no longer receive the daily
new Recruits thereof, which stagnat and re∣coil
on the <HI>Chyliferous</HI> Duct, where they
first <HI>acidulat,</HI> and then <HI>putrify;</HI> and occasion
first these Heart-burnings, sour and rotten
Belching, and afterwards <HI>bilious</HI> Vomiting,
Fits and Convulsions, by the Overflowing
and ill Condition of the <HI>Bile.</HI> The com∣mon
Distinction of <HI>nervous</HI> and <HI>humorous,</HI> or
<HI>bilious</HI> Colics, I take to be founded only
on the Difference of the Constitutions of
the Subject; and they are not different in
Nature, or ought to be differently treated,
but in the <HI>Doses</HI> of the same Medicines; for
there is no Difference but in the Degrees of
the same Substance, between the Vapour or
Smoak arising from hot Water, and the Wa∣ter
itself. The <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Colic</HI> lies in cleans∣ing
the <HI>Stomach,</HI> as often as the <HI>Symptoms</HI>
indicat, by repeated <HI>Vomits,</HI> and the In∣testins
by warm <HI>Stomach</HI> Purges; among
which I prefer what I call the <HI>Rheum
Quinquinatum,</HI> in this Case, <HI>viz.</HI> Bark,
Rhubarb, Bitters, Aromatics, and roasted
Oranges infus'd in Wine; four Spoonfuls of
this, or equal Parts of it with <HI>Tinctura Sa∣cra,</HI>
taken going to-bed every Night, or
every other Night, or <HI>pro re nata;</HI> the Rea∣sons
of this <HI>Composition</HI> will be evident from
what has been already hinted. But, besides, the
<PB N="197" REF="213"/>
Patient must use a very moderat Diet of the
common Food, and a total Abstinence from
<HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, and drink nothing but
Toast and Water, <HI>Bath, Spa,</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI>
Water to his Meals. Many I have totally
cured of habitual <HI>Colics</HI> by drinking no∣thing
but Toast and Water tepid, especi∣ally
after first having cleansed the Stomach
and Bowels by a few Vomits, or some
Doses of the mentioned Mixture. What
is here advanced, will equally serve in
most or all of the Disorders of the Stomach
and Guts, or the <HI>chyliferous Tube,</HI> that do
not depend on some <HI>specific</HI> Disorder in the
Habit translated upon them, such as the <HI>Rheu∣matism,
cutaneous Defedations, Gout,</HI> or
<HI>Scrophula,</HI> whose Treatment has been already
directed.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>VENEREAL DISTEMPERS.</HEAD>
<P>§. 30. I SHOULD here put down my
Thoughts on <HI>Venereal</HI> Distempers, but that
the late Treatise of <HI>Chirac de Re Venerea</HI> has
made every thing that can possibly be said on
that Subject useless; he having treated it, and
many other <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers united with,
or akin to it, with a Justness, Fullness, yet
with a Simplicity and Perspicuity, that ren∣ders
that Treatise one of the most useful Books
in the Practice of <HI>Physic,</HI> that has appear'd
since <HI>Sydenham's</HI> Time. I shall here only take
Notice of two things concerning this Distem∣per:
<PB N="198" REF="214"/>
1°. That I cannot be of Opinion, that
either the <HI>small</HI> or the <HI>great Pox,</HI> was origi∣nally
a Distemper peculiar and appropriated to
any certain Time or Climat, or <HI>endemial</HI>
any-where, no more than the <HI>Itch, Leprosy,</HI>
or <HI>Plague.</HI> A particular <HI>Air, Climat,</HI> ori∣ginal
<HI>Frame, Manner</HI> of Living, <HI>epidemical</HI>
Vices, and the like, may vary the <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
exasperat and increase the Malignity and De∣grees
of one Distemper, called by such a Name,
more than another; as particular <HI>Species</HI> of
Plants differ by <HI>Culture, Sun,</HI> and <HI>Soil;</HI> but
that they should alter the particular Nature and
<HI>Species</HI> of a Distemper, by which it is distin∣guish'd
from all others, I think, is unnatural,
<HI>unphilosophical,</HI> and absurd. Diseases have a
general Nature and <HI>Symptoms</HI> from the Habi∣tudes
of the Patients, from the <HI>Climat</HI> and
<HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Food;</HI> and they have a
particular Nature from their <HI>Seminium;</HI> and
they have Degrees or <HI>Symptoms</HI> from the Vices
and original <HI>Formation</HI> of <HI>Individuals.</HI> I
take the <HI>Essence</HI> of a <HI>Venereal</HI> Distemper to
arise from the Nature of that particular <HI>ani∣mal
Salt</HI> which abounds in the <HI>Spermatic
Organs,</HI> and in the Substance therein gene∣rated;
and, to speak more explicitly, I take it
to be a subtle, active and caustic <HI>Alcali,</HI> less
sublim'd and volatil than that which is the
Cause of the <HI>Pestilence,</HI> and infinitly more
<HI>fine</HI> and volatil than our most perfect com∣mon
<HI>volatil animal Salts.</HI> When <HI>Lechery,
<PB N="199" REF="215"/>
Climat, Nastiness,</HI> and various <HI>Commixtures,</HI>
a hot Diet, and Laziness, have co-operated and
fermented to their Height, these <HI>Salts</HI> turn
acrid and <HI>caustic,</HI> and so produce what is
called the <HI>Great Pox:</HI> In lesser Degrees it has
weaker <HI>Symptoms,</HI> but has one general, ade∣quat,
and <HI>specific</HI> Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> an Abundance
and Exaltation of <HI>caustic,</HI> active <HI>animal
Salts,</HI> actuating <HI>spermatic</HI> Substances of all
kinds; but is envelop'd and sheath'd with
a soft mild Jelly, when innocuous; and to
the Activity, <HI>Stimulus,</HI> and Titillation, of this
<HI>volatil Alcali, Lechery</HI> and its Sensuality is
owing. <HI>Salts,</HI> especially <HI>volatil Alcali's,</HI> are
the great Promoters of <HI>Salacity,</HI> as is evident
in <HI>Goats, Pigeons, Sparrows, &amp;c.</HI> And that
which was the <HI>Burning</HI> in <HI>England</HI> some Ages
ago, with all its Symptoms, was really the
same in Kind, though not in Degree, with
the <HI>Haws</HI> in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> only exasperated and
sublim'd higher by the inoculated Ferment, from
that particular <HI>Island</HI> and <HI>Climat;</HI> just as the
<HI>Leprosy</HI> of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> is specifi∣cally
the same <HI>Distemper</HI> with the <HI>Scurvy</HI> and
<HI>Itch</HI> of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and other <HI>Northern</HI> Na∣tions;
for the Difference of <HI>Climat, Regimen,</HI>
and <HI>Habitudes,</HI> alter in some Degree the
specific Nature and Kind of Things. 2°. That
a low, cool, very abstemious, nay a total <HI>Milk
and vegetable Diet,</HI> is as necessary and useful
sometimes, if not more, in <HI>Venereal</HI> Distem∣pers,
than in any other <HI>Chronical</HI> Diseases
<PB N="200" REF="216"/>
whatsoever; and if <HI>Mercury,</HI> and its Prepara∣tions,
make not always a total, perfect, and
lasting <HI>Cure,</HI> it is because a <HI>Regimen,</HI> strict and
parsimonious, has not been added to it for a
due Time, or that some of the noble <HI>Organs,</HI>
or the intire System of the Solids, are putri∣fied
by it. 'Tis notorious, that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Mountebank <HI>Ibra,</HI> by no other Art but his
Raisins, and dry Bisket Diet, with a very slight
and simple <HI>Mercurial</HI> Pill, <HI>Guaiac Diet∣drink,</HI>
and <HI>Sweating,</HI> cured <HI>Venereal</HI> Distem∣pers,
<HI>nocturnal</HI> Pains, and <HI>carious</HI> Bones, that
had defeated the most effectual Medicins of
the <HI>College:</HI> And a great <HI>Admiral,</HI> when he
went into warm <HI>Climats,</HI> cured all his in∣fected
Sailors with tying them down to live
on nothing but <HI>Water-gruel</HI> and <HI>Cream</HI> of
<HI>Tartar,</HI> for <HI>three</HI> Weeks in the slighter Cases,
and for <HI>six</HI> Weeks in the deeper; and I am
satisfy'd, a strict, spare Milk and vegetable Diet,
with no Drink but pure Element, a Decoction
of the <HI>Woods,</HI> or <HI>Spruce-Beer,</HI> would cure,
and carry it off as effectually, as it does other
<HI>Chronical Distempers:</HI> But I readily own, that
<HI>Mercury</HI> and its Preparations, and <HI>Guaiac</HI>
and its Preparations, will quicken and facili∣tat
the Cure one half: As to other Evacua∣tions,
I have no Opinion of them, but to
drive the peccant Matter out of one Part of
the <HI>animal</HI> Body to another more improper:
And as <HI>Mercury,</HI> and its Preparations, with a
low Diet, is the sole Cure of the <HI>Pox,</HI> so it is
of all other <HI>Chronical</HI> Diseases whatsoever;
<PB N="201" REF="217"/>
and if <HI>Venereal</HI> Distempers are now a weaken∣ing
in their Malignity, as it is said; it is be∣cause
the more frequent Use of <HI>Mercury</HI> has
destroy'd the Force of that caustic Salt in its
Sources, and thereby the <HI>Acrimony</HI> and <HI>caustic</HI>
Nature of its <HI>Seminium,</HI> in those who are ge∣nerally
the Propagators of it; <HI>Mercury</HI> and its
Preparations being now used in most <HI>chronical
Distempers.</HI></P>
<P>§. 31. I SHOULD say something here of the
<HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel,</HI> but that since the success∣ful
Experiments on Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicin,
and since it has been examin'd and approv'd
of by the Members of the <HI>College,</HI> and its
Efficacy explain'd and accounted for, from the
Principles of the best natural <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and
its Form garbled and polish'd by two of the
<HI>worthiest Men,</HI> and most accurat Observers of
this Age; all I can possibly suggest, can be of
little Value or Use. Only since it has been
surmis'd by some, and contradicted by none,
that <HI>vinous Beverage</HI> quickens and promotes
the Efficacy of the Medicins; I think myself
obliged to say something to this seeming <HI>Ob∣jection</HI>
to one great Principle I have laid down
(without Exception) in this Treatise, <HI>viz.</HI>
That sole Water drinking, in all Cases, is one
of the surest Means to preserve or restore
Health, and that strong fermented Liquor,
much less <HI>vinous Beverage,</HI> (except as a Me∣dicin
or a <HI>Cordial</HI> on <HI>Extremities</HI>) is not
an Institution of Nature, nor conducive to
<PB N="202" REF="218"/>
Health. That Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> did not advise
<HI>sole</HI> Water-drinking under her Medicin, but
rather directed the contrary, is no great
Wonder; it might have too much discouraged
the Use of a Medicin, nauseous in itself, and
requir'd in large and frequent <HI>Doses;</HI> and
that the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that have been at most
Pains to discover its Nature and Efficacy, have
said nothing for or against sole Water <HI>Beve∣rage</HI>
under it, might be for want of <HI>Cases,</HI>
where the Patients drank Water only under
it, to make the proper Experiments by. The
only Reason I have learn'd that is given for
drinking Wine under it, is that thereby the
<HI>Urine</HI> is render'd more <HI>Alcalin,</HI> and conse∣quently
more efficacious to work on the <HI>Stone:</HI>
But surely this would be too frivolous for such
ingenious and penetrating Gentlemen to offer
as solid, and so could not come from them,
they well knowing, that <HI>fermented Men∣struums</HI>
rather destroy than promote the <HI>Al∣calin</HI>
Virtues of Medicins; for the same
Quantity of <HI>alcalious</HI> Matter, impregnating an
equal Quantity of an <HI>aqueous</HI> and a <HI>vinous
Menstruum,</HI> will render the first much more
<HI>alcalin</HI> than the second. Fermented Liquors
harden and consolidat the <HI>alcalin</HI> Particles, as
we may observe from unslak'd Lime, which
will be much sooner and more fully broken
and dissolv'd by a <HI>watery</HI> than by any fer∣mented
<HI>Menstruum;</HI> and it is well known, that
Water is the specific Dissolvent of all Salts. But
<PB N="203" REF="219"/>
that, in my Opinion, which should totally dis∣courage
fermented Liquor Beverage under all
<HI>Lithontriptics,</HI> is, that it is universally agreed,
that <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel</HI> owe their Origin and
Cause solely to the <HI>Tartar</HI> or <HI>Salts</HI> of fermented
Liquors, perhaps also to the <HI>animal Salts</HI>
of high Food, either in Parents or Posterity;
and surely the Medicin would work the quick∣er
on the <HI>Stone,</HI> at least have less to do, while
that which is the Cause of its Accretion were
intirely remov'd: And the Physician <HI>Dolaeus,</HI>
tormented both with Gout and Stone, found
a Milk Diet the best Cure for both, and ad∣vis'd
it equally in both<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Dolaeus</HI> on the Cure of the Gout by a Milk Diet.</NOTE>. <HI>Cyprianus,</HI> who
had cut fourteen hundred Patients for the
<HI>Stone,</HI> affirm'd, that among all those there
was not <HI>one</HI> who drank any thing but small
smooth Ale, or aqueous Liquors only. They
are scarce ever subject to it in the Eastern Coun∣tries,
at least the Natives, who drink little but
Water<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Kolben's</HI> History of the <HI>Cape.</HI></NOTE>. I have had Patients under this
Medicin for the <HI>Stone,</HI> much tormented with
bloody Water, which Water-drinking only
has intirely stopp'd, except on violent Mo∣tion;
and which, on the drinking the <HI>least
Wine,</HI> has return'd, even without Motion. I
have known <HI>one,</HI> who, before Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s
Medicin was discover'd, was so violently tor∣mented
with the <HI>Stone,</HI> that he had sent for
<PB N="204" REF="220"/>
Mr. <HI>Cheselden</HI> to cut him, who finding him
under so bad a Habit, durst not attempt the
Operation, but advis'd him to a low, cool,
soft Regimen, and Barley-water-drinking, to
mend his Constitution; whereby he soon be∣came
so easy in some time, that he thought
no more of that painful and dangerous Ope∣ration.
In a Word, it is my Opinion, in
this, as I certainly know in all other pain∣ful
and dangerous <HI>Chronical</HI> Distempers, that
sole Water or unfermented Liquor <HI>Beve∣rage,</HI>
under their proper medicinal <HI>Antidots,</HI>
would much quicken and facilitat the Cure:
In slighter and less atrocious Distempers, I can
allow a little <HI>compounding</HI> the Matter, be∣tween
<HI>sensible</HI> Pain and <HI>sensual</HI> Pleasure, I
say, in other milder Cases; but in the <HI>Stone</HI>
and <HI>Gout,</HI> I should think, would not admit
even this, because here the Cause of the Dis∣temper
is increas'd and enrag'd by this fatal
Indulgence.</P>
<P>§. 32. THE <HI>Seminium, Elements</HI> and <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI>
of <HI>specifically</HI> different Distempers, are
the several different Sorts of <HI>Secretions</HI> (their
<HI>specific</HI> Nature and Qualities, and the Figure
and Laws of <HI>Attraction</HI> of their constituent
<HI>Particles</HI>) made by the different <HI>Glands</HI> and
Strainers of the <HI>animal</HI> Body. Thus the <HI>Mu∣cus,</HI>
Phlegm and viscid <HI>Serum</HI> separated by the
<HI>emunctory Glands</HI> of the <HI>Nose, Throat, Wind
pipe, Lungs,</HI> and <HI>alimentary Tube,</HI> design'd by
<PB N="205" REF="221"/>
Nature to sheath, lubricat and preserve the
<HI>Elasticity</HI> of these <HI>Organs,</HI> when viscous,
saltish, or morbid, I call the <HI>Seminium,</HI> or
Principle of <HI>Coughs, Asthma's, Pleurisies,
Scirrhus's, Consumptions,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Bile,</HI>
when viscid, vitiated and corrosive, I call the
<HI>Seed</HI> and Principle of the <HI>Scurvy, Jaundice,
Colic, Dropsy,</HI> hot and inflammatory <HI>Ulcers,</HI>
and the <HI>Cancer.</HI> The <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood,
when thick, sharp, urinous, and <HI>caustic,</HI> is the
<HI>Seminium</HI> and Cause of the Rupture of the
<HI>Lymphatics,</HI> of <HI>cutaneous Defedations,</HI> the
<HI>Leprosy, Small-pox,</HI> an <HI>Ascites,</HI> or Dropsy.
The <HI>perspiratory</HI> Matter, which, when a Per∣son
is healthy, steams freely from the whole
<HI>Surface,</HI> (like the Smoak of Water from a
boiling Pot) when the Blood becomes thick,
sizy, and viscid, and its <HI>Particles</HI> not suffici∣ently
small, nor duly broken and <HI>fin'd,</HI> by
the <HI>digestive</HI> and concoctive <HI>Organs,</HI> and can
pass no more through the <HI>Skin,</HI> but is con∣fin'd
to, and recoils upon the <HI>Habit</HI> on the
Bowels and Cavities, produces <HI>Flatus, An∣xieties,
Depressions,</HI> and Lowness of Spi∣rit;
and when it taints and spoils the <HI>Viscera,</HI>
it causes <HI>Fits</HI> and <HI>Convulsions,</HI> and all the
Train of <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers. So the <HI>Sperm</HI>
and <HI>seminal</HI> Substance, when the <HI>specific ani∣mal
Salt,</HI> which is the Cause of <HI>Lust</HI> and
<HI>Lechery,</HI> is high, hot and corrosive, through
<HI>Climat, Luxury, high Food, Laziness, Nasti∣ness,</HI>
and <HI>various Commixtures,</HI> begets <HI>Pains,
<PB N="206" REF="222"/>
Corrosions,</HI> Inflammations, Ulcers, and <HI>phage∣daenous</HI>
Tumours on the tender and delicat
Parts of <HI>Generation</HI> first; and at last spreads all
over the Habit like a <HI>Cancer</HI> or <HI>Plague,</HI> and
consumes both Flesh, Skin and Bones. Its
Time of Appearance in any Country depends
on the Degree of its Malignity, and it is called
by new Names from its new <HI>Symptoms;</HI> and
yet it is all that time but one and the same
<HI>specific</HI> Distemper, in various and different
Symptoms and Degrees of Malignity. I think
this the Cause of the <HI>Great Pox.</HI> For Di∣stinction's
sake, I observe three Kinds or De∣grees
of <HI>animal Salts</HI> or <HI>Spirits,</HI> (though their
Degree be infinit, as that of all Qualities)
that which we call our common <HI>animal Salt</HI>
or <HI>Spirit,</HI> as that of <HI>Hartshorn, Silk, Sal Ar∣moniac,</HI>
and other <HI>animal</HI> Substances, which
too are real <HI>Caustics;</HI> that which produces the
<HI>Plague,</HI> which is the highest Exaltation, <HI>Subli∣mation,</HI>
and as it were the last Division and
<HI>Subtilisation</HI> of these <HI>volatil animal Salts;</HI>
and that which produces the <HI>Pox</HI> and the
<HI>Cancer,</HI> which is more coarse and fix'd, and,
as it were, a <HI>Medium</HI> between the other two,
and may be therefore broken, melted and
dissolv'd by the fine <HI>Globules</HI> of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and
constant Water <HI>Beverage.</HI> From all which it is
evident, as well as from Reason and Experience,
that a proper, simple, thin and cool Diet is <HI>nine</HI>
Parts of <HI>ten</HI> of all that is real or successful in
<HI>Physic,</HI> and that Medicin is but the other
<PB N="207" REF="223"/>
<HI>Tenth,</HI> and that the <HI>Author of Nature</HI> has
with infinit Wisdom and Goodness, in a
great measure, put our Health in our own
Power, so that almost <HI>Quisque suae Fortunae

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An ANSWER to most of the Objections
against the Efficacy of a low, and of a
vegetable Diet, directed for the Preserva∣tion
of Health, and Cure of Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. SOME have objected, that by thus
strongly pressing the <HI>Lightest</HI> and
the <HI>Least,</HI> and confidently affirming, that <HI>Tem∣perance</HI>
and <HI>Abstinence</HI> have but one <HI>Extreme,</HI>
the <HI>Too-high</HI> or <HI>Too-much</HI> in Food, I may
seem to insinuat, that a <HI>total Abstinence</HI> may
be the very best of all; or to think, that none
ever hurt his <HI>Health</HI> by any Degree of Absti∣nence
whatsoever. And yet it is a well∣known
<HI>Fact,</HI> that many have actually died by
an obstinat Resolution to take no Nourish∣ment;
and that from some violent Passion, as
<HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Grief, Revenge</HI> or <HI>Discontent,</HI> some
have pin'd away, and put an End to their Days;
<PB N="208" REF="224"/>
that by an obstinat Neglect of due and proper
Nourishment, the digestive <HI>Organs</HI> have in
time acquir'd an <HI>analeptic</HI> or <HI>paralytic</HI> State,
that they actually could digest nothing; or that
by long Fasting and Abstinence, the concoct∣ing
<HI>Ferment</HI> or Juice in the <HI>Stomach</HI> and
<HI>Glands</HI> has turn'd acrid or morbid, and mix∣ing
with the Blood, has corrupted and spoil'd
the Juices, and caus'd <HI>Diseases,</HI> and at last
<HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. THE Whole of this <HI>Objection,</HI> and
such-like, is mere vulgar Error, frivolous, and
<HI>unphilosophical.</HI> I am here inquireing what is
the <HI>Law</HI> of Nature in Diet, not by what
Cunning or Craft this <HI>Law</HI> may be eluded.
The <HI>Author</HI> of Nature declares his <HI>Will,</HI> his
<HI>Laws,</HI> his Orders in material or natural
Things, in the animal <HI>Oeconomy</HI> particularly,
by general Effects differing in certain Propor∣tions,
according to different Circumstances;
by placing us as it were between two <HI>parallel
Walls,</HI> and <HI>barring</HI> us up either before or be∣hind;
and so it is then evidently his <HI>Law</HI> and
Order, that we should only go backward or
forward, as the <HI>Bar</HI> happens to be put. He
has put <HI>Valves</HI> or Stops in the <HI>Arteries</HI> that
<HI>open</HI> towards the Surface of the Body, and
<HI>shut</HI> towards the Heart; and therefore I say it
is his Law and Order, intimated by <HI>them,</HI>
that the Blood should move forward towards
the Surface of the Body, and not backward
<PB N="209" REF="225"/>
to the Heart even in all <HI>Animals,</HI> (yet I know
not, but by great <HI>Intemperance</HI> in strong Li∣quors,
even these <HI>Valves</HI> are sometimes forc'd,
and the Blood, by regorging on the Ven∣tricles
of the <HI>Heart,</HI> may there clott and
harden, and thereby becomes the natural Cause
of <HI>Polypus</HI>'s) but it is not so in the <HI>Veins.</HI></P>
<P>§. 3. WHEN I say, that contrary to the
Nature of some other <HI>moral</HI> Virtues, (whose
Perfection lies in the <HI>Middle</HI> between both
<HI>Extremes</HI>) <HI>Abstinence</HI> has but one <HI>Extreme,</HI>
the <HI>Too-much</HI> or <HI>Too-high</HI> in Food, I mean
only, by a <HI>strong Figure,</HI> to take off the crafty
<HI>Puzzle</HI> thrown in by some, that Persons may
hurt their Healths, and endanger their Lives, by,
say they, an ill-judg'd <HI>Abstinence.</HI> The wise
<HI>Author</HI> of Nature has barr'd up the <HI>Too-little</HI> or
<HI>Too-light,</HI> with Pains and Sufferings so intense
and excruciating, as strongly declare, that it
is not his <HI>Law</HI> and Order, that we should per∣sist
obstinatly in them, but descend into that
middling Quantity we are tolerably easy un∣der.
It is true, he has also barr'd up the <HI>Too-high</HI>
and <HI>Too-much</HI> with Pains and Penalties,
but they are neither so intense, nor so quick∣ly
fatal. The <HI>Too-much</HI> and <HI>Too-high</HI> will
produce Diseases in Proportion to their <HI>De∣grees</HI>
directly, but they neither kill so soon,
nor torture so much, as obstinat <HI>Fascing</HI> will,
if it be possible to persist in it naturally. It
is certain, that <HI>Self-preservation</HI> is an essential
<PB N="210" REF="226"/>
LAW of Nature; and yet from <HI>Frensy</HI> and
strong Passions, we hear of its being defeated
daily. We judge of the Nature, <HI>Tribe</HI> and
Species of a <HI>Plant</HI> or <HI>Animal,</HI> by the fairest
and best, and not by <HI>monstrous</HI> or accidental
Productions in either <HI>Extreme;</HI> as this Death
by Fasting implies a direct <HI>Monstruosity.</HI></P>
<P>§. 4. WHEN I advise therefore the <HI>Light∣est</HI>
and the <HI>Least,</HI> I mean, To take regularly
Something and Somewhat; for Nothing nei∣ther
admits of Degrees nor Qualities. Sup∣pose
(to shew the Absurdity) a Man took
<HI>half a Pound</HI> of Bread and a <HI>Pint</HI> of Water
three times a Day, what would be the Con∣sequence?
The <HI>Objector</HI> thinks the Patient
would certainly <HI>die;</HI> his concocting Juices
would turn <HI>acrid,</HI> and so spoil his Blood, and
thereby he would <HI>pine,</HI> and at last extinguish;
and yet <HI>Cassian</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Cassian's <HI>Conferences.</HI></NOTE> tells us, that the antient <HI>Her∣mits</HI>
allow'd themselves but a Pound (or even
less) of Bread with Water in <HI>Twenty-four</HI>
Hours; and most of them liv'd to an <HI>Hun∣dred,</HI>
some to an Hundred and Fifty, others to
Two hundred Years, without Diseases, and
with great Serenity and Chearfulness. And
Dr. <HI>Barwick</HI> tells us, in the Life of his Bro∣ther,
who, in the late Civil Wars, had for
many Years been confin'd in a low Room in
the <HI>Tower,</HI> dureing the Usurpation; that at
the Time of his going in, he was under a
<PB N="211" REF="227"/>
<HI>Phthisis, Atrophy,</HI> and <HI>Dyscrasy,</HI> and liv'd
on Bread and Water only several Years there;
and yet came out at the <HI>Restoration,</HI> sleek,
plump, and gay. Many such Instances I
could produce, but it would be lost Labour.</P>
<P>§. 5. As to those who have starv'd them∣selves
to Death, to alleviat violent Pains, high
and unnatural Passions, Discontent, or a <HI>Tae∣dium
Vitae,</HI> they do not properly belong to
the general State of <HI>human Nature,</HI> and so
have no Place in a Disquisition about the
general Laws of Nature in the Human <HI>Spe∣cies</HI>
concerning Diet. Their Faculties, with
the material <HI>Organs</HI> belonging to them, must
be spoil'd and distemper'd; they are <HI>Lunatic</HI>
and out of their natural Senses, (as all vio∣lent
Passions are a temporary <HI>Lunacy</HI> and
Madness) and are no more to be instanc'd
against the Law and Order of Nature as to
Diet, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least</HI> Food
a Man can be tolerably easy under, than <HI>Self-murder</HI>
is an Instance against the great Law
of <HI>Self-preservation.</HI> If I might tell my
own private Opinion, it is, that where-ever
these violent <HI>supernatural</HI> Passions of <HI>Love,
Grief, Revenge,</HI> or Discontent, happen to
such a Height, there is a deep <HI>Cacochymy</HI>
there already; that the Juices are already in∣flamed
or putrified, <HI>acrimonious</HI> or <HI>arsenic,</HI>
and that the Solids and intellectual <HI>Organs</HI>
are spoiled, relaxed or putrified, and disobe∣dient
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
to the <HI>Will,</HI> and rational Spirit; and
either dissonantly play, and make a confus'd
Discord, or possibly may be play'd upon
by some foreign Spirit, like the <HI>Obsess'd;</HI>
which in this <HI>Dyscrasy</HI> finds a proper <HI>Organ</HI>
for its malicious Inspiration, as <HI>Insects</HI> or
<HI>Vermin</HI> plant their Eggs on the Leaves of
<HI>morbid</HI> Trees; but at least the Spirit, as well
as the Body, must first be greatly distemper'd.
But these last Solutions may be mere Conjec∣tures,
and as such I only mention them.</P>
<P>§. 6. BUT the most whimsical and unphi∣losophical
Part of this Objection, is, that the
<HI>Archaeus,</HI> as some term it, or (which is the
same thing) the inexplicable <HI>Ferment,</HI> in the
<HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Glands,</HI> turning <HI>acrid</HI> and <HI>ar∣senic</HI>
by Fasting, corrupts the Blood, and so
causes Diseases and Death; which is merely
to substitute <HI>something</HI> or <HI>any thing</HI> to supply
the Void Ignorance has made, and thus <HI>every
thing</HI> may be concluded from <HI>any thing.</HI>
The true <HI>Fact,</HI> I think, is this: The wise
<HI>Author</HI> of Nature has, by his own omni∣potent
Hand, originally and primarily form'd
the <HI>infinitesimal Solids</HI> of all <HI>Plants</HI> and
<HI>Animals;</HI> neither lifeless Nature, nor Mat∣ter
and Mechanism, with all its Laws, be∣ing
capable to frame the least original <HI>Or∣gan</HI>
or <HI>Fibre</HI> of either, as may be strictly de∣monstrated.
It is certain from the Expences
<PB N="213" REF="229"/>
of Living, Action, and the Secretions, the
Blood, but especially the new Bile, if not re∣cruited,
diluted and cool'd, with fresh <HI>Chyle,</HI>
and aqueous Fluids, in some Degree, would
turn hot, viscous and thick, and so produce
Diseases of all kinds; but then Water-gruel,
Milk, and Garden-stuff, would be the very
best and most effectual to prevent all these
Inconveniencies, and keep it always cool,
sweet, and fluid; and of these there is no Mea∣sure
needs be put, but by Calls of the Appe∣tite,
unless the Party be ill and diseas'd: For,
by a necessary <HI>Mechanism,</HI> the animal <HI>Fibres</HI>
and <HI>Tubes</HI> are set a playing, to take in Nou∣rishment,
and Materials for <HI>Accretion, Evo∣lution,</HI>
and <HI>Extension,</HI> from any Fluid or
Juice next to them, whether good, bad, or
indifferent; and thus grow and extend, as far
as their original <HI>Stamina</HI> admit; after which
they harden, fix and stop, the Juices thicken,
and the <HI>Vegetable</HI> or <HI>Animal</HI> naturally and
necessarily dies, and turns into Dust: And this
is all that <HI>digestive</HI> or concoctive Powers can
do; they can only suck in by their <HI>attractive</HI>
Powers, and by their <HI>mechanic</HI> Powers grind
and comminute the Materials nearest the Ori∣fices
of their <HI>Lacteals</HI> and <HI>Vasa inhalantia,</HI>
to fit them to plump up and extend these
original <HI>linear Solids,</HI> till they arrive at their
utmost Extension and Growth; and this they
will do from their own <HI>inherent</HI> original
<HI>Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Attraction,</HI> directed by the
<PB N="214" REF="230"/>
Action and Influence of the <HI>immaterial self-motive
Spirit,</HI> that governs and moves all
the <HI>Organs</HI> and <HI>Functions</HI> of this <HI>elastic</HI> Ma∣chin;
so that, like the <HI>Root</HI> of a <HI>Plant,</HI> the
<HI>Animal</HI> is fed or nourish'd by a watery
Mucilage, or the nearest fluid Mixture, what∣ever
that be; as is evident from hence,
that our Bodies may be fed and sustain'd
by <HI>Clysters, Fomentations, Injections, Trans∣fusions,</HI>
and even <HI>Steams</HI> and Vapours, as
really, though not so fully and dureably, as
by the Mouth and digestive <HI>Organs,</HI> without
any <HI>Archaeus</HI> or <HI>Ferment.</HI> All depends on
the original <HI>Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Attraction</HI> of the
Solids, and the Direction and Superintendence
of the <HI>immaterial</HI> indwelling <HI>Spirit;</HI> and any
fluid Mixture will do, that lies nearest; but
what will most easily grind and divide, is
fittest and best. It is true, as has been said,
to keep the Blood cool and thin, and to have
the Health the best it may be, regular Supplies
of fresh <HI>Chyle</HI> are necessary; but <HI>Water, Milk,
Seeds, Fruit</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> will do that
best of any.</P>
<P>§. 7. ONE favourite and specious <HI>Objection,</HI>
made by some <HI>unphilosophical</HI> Persons, against
a low, cool <HI>Diet,</HI> is the Danger thereby from
the over-abounding either of the too <HI>alcalious,</HI>
too sweet and soft Juices, or the too <HI>sharp</HI>
and sour ones; <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of which, they
say, Seeds and Vegetables may produce, and
<PB N="215" REF="231"/>
into one of which, in their Opinion, they are
naturally apt to run; at first into the <HI>Too-sweet,</HI>
and at last <HI>Too-sharp,</HI> and both in their Turns.
But the Experiments assign'd for Proof of
this Objection are far from being decisive of
the true Cause in the Cases objected, <HI>viz.</HI> that
such and such Diseases are relieved or cured
by <HI>Acids,</HI> or <HI>alcalious</HI> Medicins <HI>respectively,</HI>
because, forsooth, Acids in the Air, and in
the Mixture of <HI>chymical</HI> Liquors, destroy <HI>Al∣kali's,</HI>
and on the contrary. Now I would
desire those Gentlemen to consider, 1°. That
there is no manner of Certainty, that <HI>Acids,</HI>
or <HI>alcaline Salts,</HI> can operate in the <HI>capillary</HI>
Vessels of living animal Bodies, after the same
manner as they do in the open Air, and at
perfect Liberty; because their Operation is and
must be obstructed, or much altered, by the
<HI>attracting</HI> Sides of the slender <HI>Tubes,</HI> (as
we see in <HI>Mercury</HI> and Water in small glass
<HI>Tubes</HI>) and by the constant Motion of the
Particles of <HI>animal</HI> Fluids in the <HI>Circulation;</HI>
whereas <HI>Rest</HI> is an indispensable <HI>Condition</HI>
towards the free and full <HI>Action</HI> of the innate
Laws, and the Properties of <HI>minute</HI> Bo∣dies.
2°. It is a great Doubt with me,
whether there be in Nature, antecedent to
the <HI>Tortures</HI> of the <HI>Fire,</HI> (natural or ar∣tificial)
any true, at least perfect <HI>Alcali's.</HI>
I am sure the Appearances (<HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>Fer∣mentation</HI>
with <HI>Acids</HI>) may be more <HI>philo∣sophically</HI>
accounted for otherwise, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="232"/>
from their <HI>specific</HI> Gravity and <HI>Attraction,</HI>
which are certainly their most <HI>active</HI> Prin∣ciples,
and likeliest to produce the <HI>Appear∣ances</HI>
under Consideration: And the <HI>Figures</HI>
of the two different Kinds of Particles must
greatly partake in the Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> from the
<HI>Particles</HI> of the <HI>Acids</HI> being probably <HI>train∣gular,</HI>
and highly <HI>attractive,</HI> and those of
<HI>Alkali's</HI> being porous <HI>Calx's,</HI> whereby the
sharp Points of the Acids will be sheathed
or blunted in the Pores of the <HI>Alkali's;</HI> for
though Nature, by the simplest Causes, pro∣duces
various and surprising Effects, yet the
infinitly wise <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> being here
confined by the <HI>Essence</HI> of that Matter, which
he has made, to some <HI>Figure</HI> inseparable even
from the least Particles of Matter, no doubt
would chuse the fittest, of which these two
mentioned seem the best contrived. 3°. I
could never conceive, that Health and the
Cure of Diseases (being so necessary a Quali∣fication
for all the wise Ends and Purposes; for
which an <HI>infinitly wise Being</HI> could send his
<HI>Creatures</HI> hither) could ever make them depend
upon the Subtleties and Dreams of <HI>Pyrotech∣nical
Enthusiasts,</HI> or the Tortures of <HI>Chy∣mical</HI>
Fires. I allow <HI>Chymistry</HI> one of the
fittest and noblest <HI>Instruments</HI> to discover
<HI>analytically</HI> the Nature, internal Composition,
the <HI>Laws, Size,</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> of the com∣ponent
Particles of Bodies, as far as it can
go; and so to be of noble Use in <HI>Natural
<PB N="217" REF="233"/>
Philosophy:</HI> But for <HI>Medicin,</HI> and the <HI>Cure</HI>
of bodily Distempers, there is scarce a valu∣able
Composition discovered by <HI>Chymists,</HI>
that by long Experience and Observation, I
could <HI>prefer</HI> or equal to the simple Products
of Nature, when judiciously and experiment∣ally
chosen and treated. But, 4°. The true
Cause of the Distempers here said to be pro∣duced
by the <HI>alcalious</HI> State of the Juices,
and cured by <HI>Acids,</HI> and on the contrary; was
the tender <HI>Crase</HI> of the too viscid Blood and
Juices, produced by the <HI>Too-much</HI> of Food,
<HI>viz.</HI> by more than the Wastes of Living, or
the Expences of the natural Functions, re∣quired;
<HI>Acids</HI> then, by constringing and vel∣licating
the Solids, (which is their natural
and necessary Effect) increasing their <HI>Spring</HI>
and Action, (as we wind up the <HI>Spring</HI>
of a <HI>Watch</HI> to make it go faster) and so
accelerating the natural <HI>Functions,</HI> whereby
greater Discharges were made, and all the
<HI>Digestions</HI> (first and second) became more
perfect; rendered the Juices more fluid, and
the Functions more easy and natural. But
I even doubt of the <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Cures</HI> al∣leged
in this Objection; for Nature often
<HI>saves</HI> and cures in time, when Art can∣not
kill. But I think the whole Doctrine of
<HI>Acids</HI> and <HI>Alcali's</HI> in the <HI>medical Aetiology,</HI>
a mere <HI>Pyrotechnical</HI> Romance, especially in
the Cause and Cure of Diseases without the
<PB N="218" REF="234"/>
Bounds of the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> as the ingenious
Dr. <HI>Pitcairne</HI> has demonstrated in his Tracts.</P>
<P>§. 8. ANOTHER great Complaint against
a <HI>low Diet, vegetable</HI> Food, Milk and Milk-meats,
and all Legums, Herbs and Fruits, is,
that in these our <HI>Northern</HI> Climats they are
windy, flatulent and tumifying, creating in∣supportable
<HI>Hurricanes</HI> and Convulsions in
the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels</HI> of some Persons. I
grant that where the Stomach is hot and in∣flamed
by <HI>high</HI> Meats and Drinks, and the
Bowels loaded with <HI>Choler, Phlegm,</HI> and
<HI>Wind,</HI> these <HI>Symptoms</HI> indeed at first may
happen; but that is only from the former
<HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Mal-Regimen.</HI> No Food can be
had on the Globe without Wind, that is,
without <HI>elastic</HI> or <HI>unelastic, i. e.</HI> fixed <HI>Air,</HI>
shut up and inclos'd in its Substance; <HI>Air</HI> be∣ing
a Part of its original Composition. In
sound Bodies, and clean Constitutions, this
<HI>Air</HI> is evaporated and thrown off by the Per∣spiration;
for which End that Infinity of <HI>per∣spiratory
Ducts</HI> all over the internal and ex∣ternal
Surface of the Body is design'd; so
when the Body is in a good State, and those
<HI>Ducts</HI> are <HI>pervious,</HI> when the Digestions are
good, and the Food sufficiently <HI>ground</HI> and
comminuted, and the <HI>Wind</HI> set free, it passes
without the least sensible Observation, Trouble
or Inconveniency, by <HI>Perspiration,</HI> like
<PB N="219" REF="235"/>
Smoak out of a <HI>Chimney;</HI> but when the Food
is but <HI>grosly</HI> digested, and the <HI>perspiratory
Ducts</HI> stopp'd by the Grossness of its <HI>Par∣ticles,</HI>
then the included <HI>Air</HI> is long retained
and accumulated in the Body, as by a foul
<HI>Chimney</HI> the Room is choaked with <HI>Smoak;</HI>
and this is the true Case in most <HI>chronical</HI> and
all <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers. But then there is a
great Difference between the Pain arising from
the <HI>Windiness</HI> of <HI>high animal</HI> Food, and <HI>strong</HI>
Liquors, the <HI>Torture, Panic</HI> and <HI>Convulsions</HI>
they produce at last, and the <HI>Wind</HI> of <HI>vege∣table</HI>
Food, as is between a freezing <HI>North-east
Wind,</HI> and a warm <HI>Western Breeze;</HI> the
first being composed of pointed <HI>animal Salts,</HI>
and burning <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the last
only of cool simple Air, Earth and Wa∣ter.
But in these last, the <HI>Windiness</HI> and
<HI>Flatulency</HI> may be greatly lessened by <HI>much</HI>
and <HI>well</HI> boiling or bakeing; culinary Heat,
in all Instances, when judiciously applied,
having the same Effect as the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
as is evident from <HI>infinit Experiments;</HI> and
the Parts of <HI>Vegetables</HI> being more easily dis∣solved
and divided into their <HI>integral Par∣ticles,</HI>
the <HI>prespiratory</HI> and flatulent Sub∣stance
will more easily pass through them,
Boiled <HI>Milk,</HI> and ground <HI>Seeds,</HI> are not sub∣jected
to this Incommodity, and roasted Fruits
very little. But indeed the <HI>Objection</HI> will
only take place at <HI>first,</HI> when the <HI>Luxurio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
are but just changing their <HI>Regimen,</HI> or are
<PB N="220" REF="236"/>
grown old. A little Patience and Perseverance
in the Endeavour after the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the
<HI>Least</HI> will fully answer this <HI>Objection:</HI> But a
<HI>vegetable</HI> Diet is what I never recommend,
but in very bad Cases, and when Water-drink∣ing
under an <HI>animal</HI> Diet has not been able
to make a Cure, nor greatly to relieve, and
that even under this Restriction the Patient
continues extremely miserable: Tho', I think,
Milk and Seeds, in all Cases, will do all that
Art can.</P>
<P>§. 9. WEAK and fearful <HI>Patients,</HI> and un∣experienced
<HI>Physicians,</HI> have been much
frightened and terrified upon an <HI>Intermittent
Fever's</HI> sometimes supervening on a low
<HI>Vegetable or Milk Diet,</HI> entered upon for
the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Hysterics, Convulsions, epileptic
Fits, nervous Lownesses,</HI> the <HI>Gout,</HI> or the
first Stage of a <HI>Phthisis.</HI> The <HI>Physician</HI> ad∣vising
has been blamed, and the <HI>Patient</HI> dis∣couraged
and frighted, so as to drop the <HI>Re∣gimen</HI>
and Method, and has therefore ever
after lived a <HI>dying, melancholy</HI> and miserable
Life; and some have been forced to throw
themselves into the Hands of <HI>Quacks,</HI> and on
destructive, deleterious <HI>Nostrums,</HI> for a small
transitory present Relief; and of this I have
seen some Instances, of which a few have
happen'd in my own Practice, and in Cases at
first under my own Direction. This is a me∣lancholy
Degree of <HI>Infatuation</HI> and Ignorance
both in the <HI>Patients</HI> and <HI>Physicians;</HI> and not
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
to be accounted for, but in the unsearchable Wis∣dom
and <HI>Secrets</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> as happening
(I have known) to some of the best and most
amiable Persons. But in the Name of Wonder
and Astonishment, can a low, cool, balsamic
<HI>Diet</HI> kill or create Distempers? while it is plain
to a <HI>Demonstration,</HI> that it is only the <HI>too-high</HI>
Diet, and Food not fitted to the Constitution
and Diseases, that produce all the <HI>bodily</HI> Mi∣series
and Sufferings of Mankind. The Mat∣ter
of Fact and Truth is, when the <HI>Glands</HI>
and <HI>Capillaries</HI> are obstructed, and the Juices
are greatly corrupted and spoiled by a <HI>Vis∣cidity</HI>
in the <HI>grumous,</HI> and a <HI>lixivial Acri∣mony</HI>
in the <HI>serous</HI> Part of the Blood, its Re∣sistance
is so great in the Vessels, that the na∣tural
Force and <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the <HI>Heart</HI> and
Solids is not able to surmount it; and so all
the Circulation is terminated in the larger
Arteries and <HI>Trunk</HI> Vessels, or the greater
Branches of such of them as just enter and
terminat in the <HI>Viscera,</HI> or internal <HI>Mem∣branes</HI>
and Surfaces. And hence grievous op∣pressive
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> great <HI>Anxiety,</HI> and Labour
in the <HI>animal Functions:</HI> And from these, ob∣structed
<HI>Viscera,</HI> a deep <HI>Melancholy</HI> and Sinking,
or a beginning Inflammation or <HI>Gangrene</HI> on the
Bowels and noble Parts; and thence again <HI>Con∣vulsions,
epileptic Fits,</HI> constant <HI>Hysterics,</HI> a
<HI>Jaundice</HI> or <HI>Dropsy,</HI> and the last Stages of mortal
Distempers daily happen. A <HI>low Diet</HI> and <HI>deob∣struent
Medicins</HI> are advised; and in some time
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
the Juices by them are much dissolv'd, thinn'd;
and broken, some of the <HI>Viscera</HI> and Obstrue∣tions
are loosen'd, and the <HI>Disproportion</HI> be∣tween
the <HI>Resistance</HI> of the Fluids and the
<HI>motive</HI> Force of the Solids is lessen'd in them;
the <HI>Circulation</HI> is render'd more extensive,
and passes now from the <HI>Arteries</HI> into the
<HI>Veins;</HI> in many Arteries and Veins through
their whole Length, if not most of their
meeting <HI>Capillaries,</HI> which before could not
be perform'd, or but partially and with much
Labour. And now the <HI>Symptoms</HI> change their
Appearance, and instead of the mention'd
ones, either an <HI>Intermittent,</HI> a regular <HI>Fit</HI>
of the <HI>Gout,</HI> (as happen'd to myself, the first
time I ever had it, after I had been two Years
under a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet) a <HI>scor∣butic</HI>
Itch, <HI>miliary</HI> Eruptions, <HI>Blotches,</HI> or
small Ulcers despumat over the Body; and
colical Gripes, bilious Vomiting, or the like,
may be brought on. The ignorant and unexpe∣rienc'd
<HI>Physician</HI> is puzzled; and the poor Pa∣tient
terrified, and returns to a <HI>high Diet</HI> of
<HI>animal Food,</HI> and strong fermented Liquors,
which fixes and perpetuats these Disorders;
and so the former <HI>Regimen</HI> and Medicins are
condemn'd and <HI>laid aside;</HI> whereas these
<HI>Symptoms</HI> were the infallible Evidences of its
Fitness and Efficacy; the Juices and Solids by
them despumating, and throwing off on the
Extremities their <HI>Recrements</HI> and Impurities.
For every one that is acquainted with the
<PB N="223" REF="239"/>
<HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> knows, that an <HI>Intermit∣tent,</HI>
or any <HI>periodical</HI> Distemper, is nothing
but the Struggle and Labour of Nature, to
pass the too viscid Juices through the <HI>capillary
Arteries</HI> into the <HI>capillary Veins;</HI> which
shews a much greater Degree of Fluidity and
Sweetness in the Blood, than when it cannot
get further than the <HI>Trunks,</HI> and greater lateral
Branches, and so rests in the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and in∣ternal
<HI>Membranes,</HI> as it always does in the
last Stages of these mention'd Distempers.
The same Reasoning is applicable to the
<HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>scorbutic Blotches,</HI> both which are
Signs of mending and purifying Juices; and
consequently Perseverance in the same <HI>Re∣gimen</HI>
and Medicins must at last perform an
<HI>extirpative</HI> dureable <HI>Cure,</HI> and perfect Health
and Spirits, if any thing can possibly do it;
whereas by returning to a <HI>high Diet,</HI> the
Solids by the Diet being now more weaken'd
and relax'd, and brought into a Balance with
the <HI>Diet,</HI> and all the bad <HI>Symptoms</HI> exaspe∣rated,
must infallibly end in <HI>Death,</HI> or at
least in a wretched <HI>dying Life.</HI></P>
<P>§ 10. LET <HI>two</HI> People be taken as nearly
alike as the Diversity and <HI>Individuation</HI> of
Nature will admit, of the same <HI>Age, Stature,
Complexion,</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of Body, and under
the same <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper, and I am will∣ing
to take the seeming worse of the two;
let all the most promising <HI>Nostrums, Drops,
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
Drugs,</HI> and <HI>Medicins,</HI> known among the
learned and experienced <HI>Physicians,</HI> antient
or modern, regular <HI>Physicians</HI> or <HI>Quacks,</HI> be
administered to the best of the two, by any
<HI>Professor</HI> at home or abroad; and I will ma∣nage
my Patient with only a few naturally in∣dicated
and proper <HI>Evacuations,</HI> and <HI>sweeten∣ing</HI>
innocent Alteratives, which shall neither
be loathsome, various, nor complicated, and
require no Confinement, under an <HI>appropri∣ated
Diet,</HI> or, in a Word, under the <HI>Lightest</HI>
and the <HI>Least,</HI> or at worst under a Milk and
Seed Diet; and I will venture <HI>Reputation</HI>
and <HI>Life,</HI> that my Method cures sooner,
more perfectly and dureably, is much more
easily and pleasantly pass'd through, in a
shorter Time, and with less Danger of a Re∣lapse,
than the other, with all the Assistance
of <HI>Art, Skill,</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> under a full
and free, though even a commonly reputed
moderat Diet, but of rich Foods, and generous
Liquors, much more under a voluptuous
Diet.</P>
<P>§. 11. COUNTRY Apothecaries, ignorant
Practitioners, much more commonly, <HI>Quacks,</HI>
who never dare order a <HI>Regimen,</HI> and who
are continually cramming their Patients with
nauseous and loathsome <HI>Potions, Pills</HI> and
<HI>Bolus's, Electuaries, Powders</HI> and <HI>Juleps,</HI>
and plaistering every <HI>Pore</HI> of their Bodies,
and at the same time incourage or allow them
<PB N="225" REF="241"/>
to satiat themselves with all kinds of toothsome
and palatable Meats and Drinks, what do they
but roast such Patients alive? I have known and
heard of many sensible Patients, who in some
acute Distempers, and where they could not
think and chuse for themselves, after they
had recover'd by the Strength of their Con∣stitution,
have declar'd, that they have suf∣fer'd
more from the <HI>nauseous Medicins,</HI> than
from their <HI>Distemper.</HI> And some of the
<HI>Learned</HI> I have heard give as a Reason for en∣courageing
their Patients in swallowing what∣ever
they can get down of <HI>poignant</HI> Food, that
Nature had provided many <HI>Out-lets</HI> and Pas∣sages
for <HI>Superfluity</HI> and <HI>Cramming.</HI> Sup∣posing
this <HI>Fact</HI> of the Indulgence of the
<HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> were true, yet is it not Mad∣ness
and Arrogance thus to abuse it? Would it
not be more prudent not to abuse the Bounty
of <HI>Nature</HI> in Contradiction to <HI>Nature?</HI>
Not to <HI>thrust</HI> down, than to be forced to
<HI>throw</HI> off again? Not to <HI>poison,</HI> than to
have recourse to an <HI>Antidot?</HI> But the
Truth of the Matter is just the <HI>Reverse: Na∣ture</HI>
has indeed provided many <HI>Out-lets,</HI> as
by <HI>Perspiration, Vomiting,</HI> a <HI>Looseness,
Sweating, Coughing,</HI> and many other Secre∣tions:
But these, if necessary, are all perform'd
in the best, easiest, and pleasantest manner,
under the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least:</HI> Whereas
on <HI>Cramming, Luxury,</HI> high Living, most
if not all of these <HI>Out-lets</HI> are shut and ob∣structed,
<PB N="226" REF="242"/>
or the Discharge by them made with
Violence and Pain, and hence only Sickness
and Diseases proceed; so that the <HI>Argument</HI>
brought in favour of <HI>Luxury,</HI> is a very strong
and solid one against it.</P>
<P>§. 12. SOME also have affirm'd, that no∣thing
but <HI>solid</HI> Food can nourish, and that
<HI>Broths, Soups, Milk,</HI> and such aqueous Food,
weaken, waste and liquify the Constitution
and Habit. But these are poor <HI>Philosophers;</HI>
for in Truth and Reality, no Food can nourish,
<HI>i. e.</HI> increase the Quantity of the Flesh and
Blood, supply the Waste of Action and Living,
and the necessary <HI>Secretions,</HI> but what is
liquid and extremely thin; and <HI>Whey</HI> will
nourish more quickly than <HI>Beef</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> P. 1. Chap. I. <HI>towards the End.</HI></NOTE>, though not
so dureably, as is well known to every one
who understands the <HI>Animal Oeconomy.</HI> Let
one swallow down what he will, that Part of
it which nourishes, must be thinner and more
fluid than the <HI>Whey</HI> of Ass's Milk; nay pos∣sibly
as thin as a <HI>Vapour,</HI> else it can never
enter the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> (the only Passages by
which Nourishment or new <HI>Chyle</HI> can get
into the Blood) or at least pass through some
of the extremely minute <HI>Canals</HI> much less
than a <HI>Hair:</HI> The rest only scratches the Pa∣late,
and the <HI>Organs</HI> of Sense, and <HI>poisons</HI> the
World afterwards. This is so certain, that it
<PB N="227" REF="243"/>
is with the utmost Difficulty the <HI>Lacteals</HI> can
be injected with the thinnest tinged Liquors,
so as to be made visible; and some of the
very best <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Philosophers</HI> have
thought, that they have no patent Orifices
into the Guts, but that the <HI>Chyle</HI> is strain'd
through the Substance and Coats of the Guts,
into these invisible <HI>Tubes,</HI> like <HI>Quicksilver</HI>
through Chamois, or Oil through Paper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Berger. de Natur. Human.</NOTE>.
But let it be observed once for all, that I
speak not here of what is necessary to pro∣cure
<HI>brutal</HI> or <HI>mechanical</HI> Force or Strength;
but for the Diseased, the Weak and Ten∣der,
and those who only want clear Heads,
free Spirits, and Freedom from Pain or Oppres∣sion;
for <HI>high</HI> Meats and Drinks I own
necessary for the <HI>Laborious,</HI> the <HI>Strong,</HI> and the
<HI>healthy Young,</HI> if taken with Moderation.</P>
<P>§. 13. THAT there are Instances of some
Men who have lived to a great Age, under
a great Fullness, and what in others is com∣monly
reckon'd <HI>Intemperance</HI> and Excess,
both in strong, rank <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fer∣mented</HI>
Liquors; nay, of some who have
gone on to <HI>Fourscore,</HI> and suffer'd very little,
though almost daily intoxicated with <HI>Spirits,</HI>
and Liquors that have pass'd through the <HI>Tor∣tures</HI>
of the <HI>Fire;</HI> that there have been such
<HI>thoughtless Mortals,</HI> I will not deny: But
<PB N="228" REF="244"/>
such Instances are of no more Weight against
what I advance, <HI>viz.</HI> that the shortest and
most infallible Means to prolong Life, to pre∣serve
Health, <HI>Freedom</HI> from Diseases, and <HI>Free∣dom</HI>
of Spirits, is to take down constantly the
<HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least</HI> Food a Man can be
easy under, or a constant Endeavour after the
<HI>Too-little;</HI> than the <HI>Life</HI> of an <HI>Elephant</HI> or
<HI>Roebuck</HI> (some of which have been said to
live Four, Five, or Six hundred Years) is longer
than that of a <HI>Lap-dog;</HI> or that the Lives of
the <HI>Antediluvians</HI> were longer than <HI>ours.</HI> The
<HI>Wisdom,</HI> the <HI>Art,</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Physic,</HI>
is to make a Man live chearful and easy,
without Pain or Disease, with the Use of his
<HI>Senses</HI> and <HI>Faculties,</HI> and at last dissolve with∣out
lingering Pain, when he has lived as long
as <HI>Nature</HI> fram'd him to last. <HI>London Houses</HI>
are made to last Fifty Years, <HI>Country Houses</HI>
for Five hundred. With some the common
way of dealing with their <HI>Patients,</HI> is constant∣ly
to blow the Fire, as with a Pair of <HI>Smith's
Bellows,</HI> till they blow it <HI>out,</HI> or in a few
Blasts consume it to <HI>Ashes.</HI> The <HI>Method</HI> I
would insinuat, is to take out the <HI>Ashes,</HI> and
<HI>dead Coals,</HI> keep it open, and give it Air;
and then it will <HI>burn</HI> chearfully as long as the
Nature of the <HI>Materials</HI> will allow. One
long-liv'd <HI>Glutton</HI> or <HI>Drunkard</HI> kills more
by his Example, and the flattering Hopes, those
who know not their own Strength, and what
<PB N="229" REF="245"/>
they were made to bear, entertain, than <HI>Hip∣pocrates</HI>
ever saved.</P>
<P>§. 14. ANOTHER great and formidable
<HI>Puzzle</HI> against a <HI>low</HI> Diet, in the <HI>Gout</HI> espe∣cially,
is, that some have grown worse under
it, and have been ever after declining; and
some have actually died, after they had enter'd
into this <HI>Regimen;</HI> and therefore some weak
Dealers in <HI>Physic</HI> rail against it, pretending
Experience and Observation for their Justifi∣cation.
I would ask these <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Is it
from the Nature and <HI>Essence</HI> of the <HI>Diet</HI> that
this Misfortune happen'd? This they will not
care to say, since <HI>nine</HI> Parts in <HI>ten</HI> of the
Mass of Mankind, who follow this Diet, do
well, and are free from the <HI>Gout.</HI> Is it then
from the Nature of the Distemper? This
they dare not say neither; for a low <HI>Diet</HI> is
the proper <HI>Antidot</HI> to Inflammation, in which
the <HI>Essence</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI> consists. Nay, but,
say they, the <HI>Inflammation</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI> is on
the Limbs and Extremities, and a cool Diet
will draw it upon the <HI>Viscera</HI> and <HI>noble Parts.</HI>
Allowing this its whole <HI>Force,</HI> it is only an
Argument for warmer and more generous
Medicins while the <HI>Fit</HI> lasts; and it is in the
Intervals that a <HI>low Diet</HI> is chiefly recom∣mended
to lessen the future <HI>Inflammation;</HI>
and after all, I much doubt, even when it is
on the Extremities, if the <HI>Diet</HI> ought not to
be low and cool; only the Solids and diges∣tive
<PB N="230" REF="246"/>
Organs are to be gently and temperatly
braced and corroborated, to keep the <HI>Inflam∣mation</HI>
on the Extremity, which vegetable
Bracers and Astringents will do. But the
lower the Diet is, the safer: Give <HI>Rest</HI> to a
broken Leg after it is set, it will cure itself;
give the <HI>Stomach</HI> little or nothing to do in the
Affair of Digestion, (which is its proper Ac∣tion)
and it will mend itself. In gross foul
Habits, and putrified Juices, great Disorders
have ensued on a <HI>low Diet;</HI> but that was
from a <HI>Despumation</HI> of the Habit: And I
am convinced, whatever these suffer from a
<HI>low Diet,</HI> would be doubled without it; and
he who dies under it, would have died in
half the Time, and suffer'd double the Mi∣sery,
without it: Nothing but putrefied <HI>Or∣gans,</HI>
and greatly corrupted Juices, can de∣stroy
such a Person. When Life is far ad∣vanced,
no wise Man ought to change any
thing in his <HI>Regimen,</HI> but the Quantity.</P>
<P>§. 15. SOME ingenious Gentlemen have
said or sneer'd, For him, (the Author) who
is as robust as an <HI>Horse</HI> or an <HI>Elephant,</HI> a
vegetable Diet may be proper; but for
poor <HI>tender, vapourish,</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Crea∣tures,
it is Poison, Death and Destruc∣tion.
Such Objections I should be asham'd
to answer, if I did not know they came
even from Persons of <HI>Character,</HI> and reputed
<HI>Eminence</HI> in the Profession; and yet it is
<PB N="231" REF="247"/>
wrong, and even frivolous, in every Part.
As for <HI>myself,</HI> I have been all my Life of a
<HI>spongy, flabby, relax'd</HI> Habit, of weak <HI>Nerves</HI>
originally, easily ruffled, surprised and hur∣ried,
and thereupon readily running into Eva∣cuations
of all kinds, which infallibly indicat
weak <HI>Nerves;</HI> and these Symptoms have
been increas'd by a lazy Disposition, and
heighten'd by a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> and <HI>sedentary</HI>
abstracted Studies. And as to the Founda∣tion
of the Objection itself, it is <HI>frivolous.</HI>
For if a strong robust Body, originally or by
a mistaken <HI>Regimen,</HI> comes to have putrify∣ing
Juices, and broken or relax'd Solids, and
yet by a low Diet, and <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicins,
can recover a sound Constitution, and good
Spirits; such a Diet will be infinitly more
necessary for a poor weak <HI>nervous</HI> Creature:
The first may struggle and hold it out a great
while by his natural Force; but the latter
must be extremely miserable, or perish soon,
without it. In Reason and Philosophy, the
Food ought to bear a Proportion both in
<HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> to the natural Strength,
Bulk and Capaciousness of the Subject; and
on that Score, if a large, strong and capacious
Subject cannot be cured without a low, cool
and spare Diet; much less, sure, can a poor,
thin, small and weakly Creature be cured
without it in a proportional Degree. The
Objection is, just as if one should aver, that
though a <HI>Kite</HI> or <HI>Carrion-Crow</HI> might live
<PB N="232" REF="248"/>
active and gay on a low Diet, yet it would
destroy a <HI>Nightingale</HI> or <HI>Wren.</HI></P>
<P>§. 16. THERE are Instances alleg'd, of
those who after having been long under a <HI>low
Diet,</HI> even of Milk and Vegetables, with∣out
being quite recover'd, nay, even still con∣tinuing
bad under it, upon returning to a
<HI>full high Diet,</HI> (at least a common Diet
of <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented Liquors</HI>)
have got perfectly well; and some (such as
I have formerly taken Notice of) that having
chang'd their low Diet upon some <HI>acci∣dental</HI>
or <HI>epidemical</HI> Distemper happening
to them, or by the Advice of some <HI>com∣plaisant
Foreigner,</HI> have afterwards grown
tolerably well. All I can say to these is, that
very possibly a <HI>low Diet</HI> might be pre∣scrib'd
where it was not absolutely necessary,
nor in all Circumstances the fittest (as to
<HI>those</HI> well otherwise, but sunk, <HI>emaciated,</HI>
and their Juices render'd poor and <HI>effete,</HI>
by violent <HI>Passions,</HI> ill-judg'd <HI>Fasteing</HI> and
Abstinence, or violent <HI>Exercise</HI>). And yet
I know, or can possibly imagine, but one <HI>Cir∣cumstance</HI>
where this can be the Case; <HI>viz.</HI>
when upon opening a Vein with a large
Orifice, the <HI>Curd</HI> of the Blood has appear'd
florid, sufficiently fluid, with a right-colour'd
and duely proportion'd <HI>Serum;</HI> but this
<HI>Grume</HI> or <HI>Curd</HI> has been weak, poor and thin,
without a sufficient Body and Balsam, and
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
the <HI>Serum</HI> too watery and <HI>pellucid.</HI> Some
such Cases have occurr'd to me, where I al∣ways
advis'd a <HI>trimming</HI> or even a common
Diet of <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors,
in Moderation, to be gradually enter'd upon
to thicken and balmify the Juices; and it has
succeeded accordingly. But as this Case
seldom or never happens, but from a prece∣dent
too long Continuance of a <HI>low</HI> Diet, or
the Circumstances above recited, or from a too
anxious and ill-judg'd Prosecution of the <HI>Light∣est</HI>
and the <HI>Least;</HI> so it is certain, if such Per∣sons
had gone on in the same Method of a low
Diet with <HI>Discretion,</HI> they would have been
perfectly and dureably well at last, and the
<HI>Grume</HI> of the Blood would in Time have
thicken'd and strengthen'd even by the <HI>same</HI>
Diet; for Nature will at last ever have its
Due: But by Reason of their Fears and Ap∣prehensions,
and their Desire of being soon
better, being allow'd and incourag'd to a
higher and fuller Diet, they have thereby
sooner inrich'd and strengthen'd their Blood
and Juices, and acquir'd <HI>high Health</HI> for some
time; but have ever paid for this <HI>lucid In∣terval,</HI>
by <HI>shortening</HI> their Days, and dying in
more <HI>Misery.</HI> And therefore, with due Caution,
I have sometimes indulg'd such Persons for
the <HI>Hardness</HI> of their <HI>Hearts;</HI> and they have
gone on in common Life very well, which
has been only owing to the balmifying, cool∣ing
and attenuating <HI>Regimen</HI> they had been
<PB N="234" REF="250"/>
so long in formerly. But this has happen'd
only to the <HI>Young,</HI> and to those who were
under or only about the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life,
who having naturally a long time as yet to
live, could not be expected to have so much
Steadiness and Resolution as to persevere in
so particular and uncommon a <HI>Regimen;</HI> and
therefore I thought it not Prudence to put
their Virtue and Courage to such a <HI>Trial,</HI> but
brought them out of this <HI>low Diet</HI> by De∣grees
with Caution, and with Advice to re∣turn
to it upon the slightest persevering Ails.
Those long past the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, I have
never suffer'd to change. From this Account
of the Case, it is plain the future Health
injoy'd was not owing to the Change of a
<HI>lower</HI> for a <HI>higher</HI> Diet, as the Objectors
would insinuat, but to the Benefit already
receiv'd by the low Diet, and its having
thinn'd the Juices, cleans'd the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and
empty'd the Vessels, and thereby render'd
them capable to receive a fuller and stronger
Diet, and hold well for a time; though it is
certain they had lived longer and healthier
at last, and died with less Pain, had they con∣tinued
their Diet. But I much doubt the <HI>Fact,</HI>
on which the Objection is founded; for <HI>Na∣ture</HI>
is never so irregular and dissonant to her∣self,
as this Objection supposes.</P>
<P>§. 17. THERE is not a more puzzling and
terrifying Objection made against a low Diet,
<PB N="235" REF="251"/>
and the Study and Pursuit of the <HI>Lightest</HI> and
the <HI>Least,</HI> which I have so strongly recom∣mended,
than that some who follow it look
<HI>ghastly, pale, ill-colour'd,</HI> and <HI>wasted</HI> to a
prodigious Degree; which seems to threaten
the Approach, and be the <HI>Harbinger,</HI> of
<HI>Death</HI> and the <HI>Grave;</HI> so that most Persons,
terrify'd with the most distant Prospect of it,
eat and drink to the <HI>full,</HI> to secure against it;
and so keep themselves eternally ailing and
miserable, to prevent, as they think, this <HI>fatal
Effect.</HI> And yet there is not a more gross and
more pernicious Mistake, than the Whole of
this <HI>Objection:</HI> For the sole <HI>Intention</HI> of a
low cool Diet is, by the most effectual Means,
to prevent this very thing they so much
dread. The Disease itself may be so rooted
and incorporated with the whole Habit, and
transubstantiated into the Solids; the <HI>Viscera</HI>
may be so obstructed and spoil'd, the Blood
and Juices so <HI>viscid</HI> and <HI>morbid,</HI> that even
the new, sweet, balsamic <HI>Chyle</HI> may not mix,
assimilat, and incorporat with the old Mass,
so as to make an <HI>homogenous</HI> Fluid, (at least
not in any small Time) to <HI>nourish, plump</HI> up,
and carry on the <HI>Circulation</HI> to the Extre∣mities,
and <HI>capillary Arteries</HI> and <HI>Veins,</HI>
whence lively Colour, Complexion, and
<HI>Plumping</HI> arise; and this may cause an
universal Wasteing, till the Blood and
Juices be sufficiently thinn'd and balmify'd,
and acquire its <HI>scarlet</HI> Colour, and the <HI>Ob∣structions</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="252"/>
of the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Glands</HI>
be made <HI>pervious.</HI> But this is not the
Fault of the <HI>Diet,</HI> but of the <HI>Distemper;</HI>
for all the World knows and acknowleges,
that such a <HI>Diet</HI> makes <HI>Children, Farmers</HI>
and <HI>Country Persons,</HI> who can afford no
other <HI>Diet,</HI> look the freshest, most healthy
and lively; and this <HI>Diet</HI> never fails in one
single Instance, when the <HI>Cure</HI> is once thus
completed, the Juices sweeten'd, and the
Functions made regular and free, it never
fails, I say, to produce this Plumpness,
Liveliness and Freshness. While the Cure
is performing, the greater the <HI>Waste</HI> of the
old morbid <HI>Habit</HI> is, the more perfect and
full will be the Recovery, and future <HI>Plump∣ness,</HI>
provided the Wasteing come from
the Thinness, Coolness and Softness of the
Diet only; without <HI>Hectic,</HI> violent Evacua∣tion,
or evident <HI>Symptom</HI> of some <HI>noble
Bowel</HI> spoil'd; for then it is the surest <HI>Mark</HI>
of their future perfect Recovery. A Person
who is two or three Years in <HI>wasteing,</HI> and all
that time pursues the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least,</HI>
will infallibly in as many more, or sooner
perhaps, come to perfect Health and Plump∣ness
again; and it is this <HI>Diet</HI> alone that can
prevent their running down too fast and pre∣cipitatly,
and the only thing in Nature that
can put a Stop to their wasteing, and, as it were,
put a <HI>Drag</HI> on the Wheels, to hinder them from
running too fast down Hill; for when the
<PB N="237" REF="253"/>
Juices are perfectly sweet, the <HI>Wasteing</HI> will
cease, and the <HI>Plumping</HI> begin. When I
see a Person thin, meagre, and ill-colour'd,
I conclude, without asking Questions, that he
is under a <HI>Mal Regimen</HI> of <HI>Diet</HI> as to him,
whatever other Appearances of Health he may
have; and if he continue so dureing a <HI>whole
Life,</HI> I conclude he continu'd under that im∣proper
<HI>Regimen;</HI> for a proper, low, soft
<HI>Diet</HI> will as infallibly at last (if no great <HI>Or∣gan</HI>
be spoil'd) make him look fresh, plump
and healthy, as <HI>Summer</HI> will succeed <HI>Winter.</HI>
A Person under a <HI>cachectic</HI> Habit, and <HI>chro∣nical</HI>
Distempers, must waste and throw off
every <HI>Fibre</HI> and Atom of that old <HI>Habit,</HI>
fluid and solid, before he is renew'd, and
becomes plump and healthy again; and
those who are under the Necessity of such a
<HI>Diet,</HI> or under the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the <HI>Least,</HI>
ought to expect <HI>this</HI> Degree of Recovery,
some sooner, some later, according to the
Degree of the <HI>Malignity</HI> and Obstinacy of
the Distemper, and to ground the Hopes of
the Degree of their future Recovery on this
<HI>Fact,</HI> and not to be puzzled and terrified by
Gainsayers; for if they persevere obstinatly
and strictly, they will recover, and get plump,
gay, and healthy again, if none of the great
<HI>Organs</HI> be spoil'd; and even then they will
last longer, live easier, and lie down more
gently: And this is the best can be expected
in such a bad Case, where some necessary
<PB N="238" REF="254"/>
<HI>Appendage</HI> or <HI>Organ</HI> to Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is quite and
irrecoverably spoil'd or lost; for no Diet, Me∣dicin,
or Means, can create such an <HI>Organ</HI>
anew; and yet Nature has wonderful Re∣sources
even in such a Case, under a low
sweetening Diet, either by makeing the re∣maining
Part of the <HI>Organ</HI> sufficient by its
<HI>Dilatation,</HI> and by opening new Passages, or
forming <HI>succedaneous Joints</HI> and <HI>Organs,</HI> to
make the Person last and become easy under
such a Misfortune; and we have Instances of
Persons who have lived long and easy with
one <HI>Lobe</HI> of the <HI>Lungs</HI> or <HI>Liver,</HI> when the
other has adher'd or turn'd scirrhous, and been
quite useless; and where the <HI>Hip-Joint</HI> dislo∣cated
has form'd a <HI>succedaneous</HI> one; and
where an <HI>Artery</HI> cut by inlarging the collateral
Branches, has nourish'd the Part, even there
where that cut <HI>Artery</HI> was originally directed:
But these Advantages can never happen, but
under a soft, cool <HI>Diet.</HI> It is indeed a fatal
<HI>Symptom</HI> to waste and fall away under a full,
free, and <HI>high Diet:</HI> It is a certain <HI>Symptom</HI>
of a <HI>Non-assimilation,</HI> a Decay, or a scorbutic
and <HI>nervous Atrophy;</HI> it shews want of Di∣gestion,
or Assimilation of the new <HI>Chyle</HI>
with the old Blood; but under a <HI>Milk</HI> and
<HI>Seed Diet,</HI> all these Faults and Inconveni∣encies
are avoided, as much as the Nature of
the Case will admit. Milk and Seeds will thin,
dilute, unite and incorporat with <HI>Glew</HI> sooner
than Birdlime, Size, or Camp-Jelly diluted
<PB N="239" REF="255"/>
would; Water and aqueous Liquors warm'd,
will dissolve and incorporat with the strongest
<HI>Viscosities,</HI> and are the only Substances that can
possibly do it: So that on the Whole, in bad
Cases, sizy Juices, <HI>lixivial</HI> and inflammatory
Blood, watery Fluids, with cool, soft and light
solid Powders or Mixtures of Seeds, as Milk-meats,
Seed-meats, and <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, must
be allow'd to be the only possible Mean in all
Nature, that can prevent this so much dreaded
Wasteing and Consumeing; and they that
waste and fall away under it, must consume
twice as fast in half the Time without it.
And it is observable in all those who waste
in a mortal Distemper, that their <HI>Atrophy</HI> is
always attended with and from some sensible
<HI>Evacuation,</HI> such as a <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> constant
Night-Sweats, an <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> profuse <HI>Ptya∣lism,</HI>
or a violent <HI>Cough;</HI> and those who
waste insensibly under a <HI>Regimen,</HI> are seldom
in Danger of Death, but generally recover,
and grow fat at last, if the Wasteing be not
attended with some profuse Evacuation men∣tion'd,
which implies the Corruption of some
necessary <HI>Organ</HI> of Life. But this Case be∣ing
the most formidable of any, will be fully
consider'd in the following Chapter.</P>
<P>§. 18. IT is a common <HI>Objection</HI> against
a low and <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet, that it cuts off the
Means of a Cure, if either by <HI>Accident</HI> or
<HI>epidemical</HI> Causes, a Distemper seizes such a
<PB N="240" REF="256"/>
Person. But these Objectors do not con∣sider,
that by this their own <HI>Confession,</HI> the
proper and most effectual Cure of any Distem∣per
is by a low Diet, since it supposes this
Diet would cure the Distemper when the
Party seized were under any other <HI>Regimen,
viz.</HI> one of Meat and Wine. But to answer
the Objection <HI>directly;</HI> as to <HI>Accidents</HI> and
<HI>epidemical</HI> Distempers, I know no Fence
against them. If the Misfortune happens by
an <HI>Accident,</HI> none can doubt, that he who
has good Blood and Juices (and which this
<HI>Diet</HI> is suppos'd always to produce) will
sooner and more probably be cured by the
common Methods, than he who has the con∣trary
<HI>Habit:</HI> And the same is to be said of
<HI>epidemical</HI> Distempers; he who has a good
sweet-blooded Habit, will have a better
Chance to get over them, than he who has
a morbid Constitution. But, 1. Under a <HI>low
Diet</HI> it is a Contradiction, that a Man should
naturally, and from the common Laws of
the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> fall into any dangerous,
painful, or mortal Distemper; for the <HI>An∣tidot,
i. e.</HI> the <HI>low Diet,</HI> is a continual Pre∣servative,
as even this Objection supposes,
and as Heat is a constant Preservative against
Cold. But, 2. Suppose the impossible Case
should happen, it is but lessening the Quantity
of the Materials of the <HI>same Diet</HI> for some
time, with the common Medicins, which
will more effectually and sooner cure the
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
Distemper, than it would be cured even in
descending from a full <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>vinous
Diet</HI> into a <HI>low</HI> one. But, in Fact, the Ob∣jection
is both unnatural and unphiloso∣phical,
and implies its own Answer.</P>
<P>§. 19. IT may be the Opinion of some
Physicians, as well as of some Patients, that
Life, without <HI>sensual Pleasures</HI> and Enjoy∣ments,
is not worth haveing; and there∣fore,
when their <HI>Patients</HI> are by <HI>Luxury,</HI>
or <HI>hereditary Distempers,</HI> reduced to a very
<HI>low</HI> and <HI>wretched</HI> Condition, they think
the <HI>Preservation</HI> of their Lives by so long
and painful a <HI>Self-denial</HI> as is here pre∣scribed,
would be too dear a Purchase; or
that the <HI>Game</HI> is not worth the <HI>Candle:</HI>
and so may prescribe very <HI>active</HI> and dan∣gerous
Medicins at a <HI>Venture,</HI> either to re∣lieve
or to end them; at the same time
indulgeing their deprav'd <HI>Appetites</HI> in what∣ever
kinds of Meats and Drinks they <HI>crave,</HI>
or can get down. But such <HI>Physicians</HI> do
not consider, that they are accountable to
the Community, to their Patient, to their
Consciences, and to their <HI>Maker,</HI> for every
Hour and Moment they shorten and cut off,
of the natural Duration of their Patients
Lives, by their immoral and murderous <HI>In∣dulgence.</HI>
And the <HI>Patients</HI> do not duely
ponder, that <HI>Suicide</HI> (which this is in Effect)
is the most mortal and irremissible of all
<PB N="242" REF="258"/>
Sins: And Neither has sufficiently weighed
the <HI>Possibility,</HI> that the Party, if not quickly
cut off by both these preposterous Means,
may linger out miserably, and be twenty or
thirty Years a dying, under these <HI>Heart</HI> and
<HI>Wheel-breaking</HI> Miseries, thus exasperated:
Whereas by the Methods I propose, if they
obtain not in time a perfect <HI>Cure,</HI> yet they
certainly thereby lessen their <HI>Pain,</HI> length∣en
their <HI>Days,</HI> and are continued, un∣der
the <HI>Order</HI> of Providence over them,
and the benign <HI>Influence</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> of
<HI>Righteousness, who has Healing under his
Wings;</HI> and, at worst, soften and lighten the
<HI>Anguish</HI> of their Dissolution, as far as the Na∣ture
of Things will admit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">REFLECTIONS on the general Method of
Cure of hereditary or acquired Tenderness,
Thinness, Wasteing, or Valetudinariness of
Constitution, from whatever Causes.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. IT is certain every <HI>Animal</HI> (rational
or irrational) in perfect Health, where
all the <HI>Functions</HI> are regularly perform'd, and
who has at hand Sufficiency of proper Food,
must become at last <HI>plump, fresh,</HI> and <HI>roundish:</HI>
If it is otherwise, though there should be no
real Complaints of Disorders <HI>felt</HI> or <HI>sensible,</HI>
yet there must be a Defect somewhere, either
of an improper <HI>Diet,</HI> an imperfect <HI>Di∣gestion</HI>
or <HI>Assimilation,</HI> or les'd internal <HI>Or∣gans.</HI>
It is very possible this Defect may not
be sensible or felt, while the <HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>So∣lids</HI>
are not yet come to their greatest <HI>Exten∣sion,</HI>
that is in <HI>Youthhood;</HI> being hid and con∣ceal'd
by the greater <HI>Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Volubility</HI>
of these Solids at that Time of <HI>Life.</HI> But if
there be an habitual <HI>Thinness, Leanness, Ten∣derness,</HI>
and <HI>Valetudinariness,</HI> there must be
some <HI>Dyscrasy</HI> in the Juices, or Imbecillity in
the Solids, <HI>natural, hereditary,</HI> or acquir'd. The
<HI>intellectual Organs</HI> may be, and often are, in
<HI>such</HI> Constitutions more acute, penetrating
and comprehensive, than in those of the Fat
<PB N="244" REF="260"/>
and Plump, especially if these last are over∣loaded
with Clay; but the bodily Health of
the <HI>Lean</HI> and <HI>Wither'd</HI> is always so tottering,
precarious, and subject to the smallest <HI>Acci∣dents,</HI>
that it hinders even the Improvement
and Culture of such delicat intellectual <HI>Or∣gans,</HI>
to that Height they might otherwise be
carried. If these <HI>Infirmities</HI> be only mid∣dling
and tolerable, and not come to their
last Stage, a general <HI>Temperance, good Air,
Exercise,</HI> and a proper Care of all the <HI>Non-naturals,</HI>
may suffice to carry on Life tole∣rably,
to the Length of its natural Duration.
But when the wasteing <HI>Case</HI> is extremely bad,
obstinat, and dangerous, not yielding to the
best Advice and Means commonly used, I
intend here to suggest the most probable <HI>Me∣thod</HI>
known to me, or I think knowable in
the Nature of Things, to give such the best
Chance for an <HI>extirpative</HI> Cure, at least for
as long a <HI>Life,</HI> as much <HI>Ease,</HI> and Freedom
of <HI>Spirits,</HI> as such a <HI>Case</HI> will bear.</P>
<P>§. 2. IN such a <HI>Case,</HI> and such a Stage of
it, as I have describ'd, there is nothing can
do any real Service but a strict Milk and Seed
Diet; and if it has not been enter'd on be∣fore,
it ought, without any Hesitation or Pre∣paration,
to be enter'd upon directly; especially
if upon letting out a few Ounces of Blood
for Trial, it is found <HI>sizy,</HI> (as I could venture
my Life it will in such a Case be, as I always
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
found) no such <HI>Atrophy,</HI> or Thinness, being
ever possible, or of any Duration, but where
the Blood is almost like <HI>Camp-jelly,</HI> so as
that no <HI>Assimilation</HI> can be made; and Milk
and Seeds can only furnish out a <HI>Chyle,</HI> that
will gradually mix with, dilute, and thin this
old <HI>glewy Fluid,</HI> and prevent a mortal <HI>Waste∣ing;</HI>
and in this <HI>Case, Ass's Milk</HI> is far pre∣ferable
to any other Kind, it being already
true, sweet, kindly <HI>Chyle,</HI> which only can
get through the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> probably almost
in its own unbroken State; and to which
all <HI>Chyle,</HI> that naturally nourishes, ought to
be similar in <HI>Fluidity</HI> and Sweetness, come it
from animal or vegetable Food; the Qua∣lities
of <HI>Ass's Milk</HI> being, due Thinness or
Fluidity, Sweetness and <HI>Balsam,</HI> which no
other <HI>Chyle</HI> or nutritive Milk, from either
animal or vegetable Food, has in such an Emi∣nence;
and consequently no other <HI>Milk</HI> or
<HI>Chyle</HI> is so nutritive, or so readily converti∣ble
to <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood.</HI> The greatest <HI>Cures</HI> I
have ever seen perform'd in Distempers abso∣lutely
despair'd of, in this Kind, have been
perform'd by <HI>Ass's Milk</HI> for Breakfast and
Supper, and only Cow Milk and Bread for
Dinner, hot in Winter, and cold in Summer-heats.
<HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>scorbutic Atrophies,</HI> and
Thinness in lesser Degrees, may admit of
greater Variety of Foods. All the Garden
Things much boil'd, and dress'd with Cow
Milk, are much the same as a <HI>total Milk
<PB N="246" REF="262"/>
Diet,</HI> with the Difference only between <HI>ani∣mal</HI>
and <HI>culinary</HI> Cookery; but a Milk and
Seed Diet, or even <HI>Milk</HI> only for <HI>Diet,</HI> (as
in Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of <HI>Croyden's</HI> Case) is the most
infallible, and indeed the only proper Means
known or knowable, to give a <HI>Chance</HI> for a
<HI>Cure,</HI> in such a deplorable Case as I have
represented, or indeed in any desperat Case
whatever; and I am positive, if this <HI>Regimen</HI>
will not do, no other possibly can; and if it
should not <HI>cure,</HI> it will absolutely prolong
<HI>Life</HI> more, and make the <HI>Symptoms</HI> milder:
But most Patients will not be brought into it,
till it be too late. And here the <HI>artificial
Ass's Milk,</HI> of three Parts Barley-water, (made
with two Ounces of Barley, one of candied
<HI>Eringo</HI> Roots to three Pints of Water boil'd
to a Quart and strain'd, and a fourth Part of
boil'd and skimm'd Cow Milk added to it)
may be a good <HI>Succedaneum</HI> to natural <HI>Ass's
Milk,</HI> if it cannot be readily had.</P>
<P>§. 3. So much for the <HI>Diet</HI> of such thin,
<HI>wasteing,</HI> and <HI>valetudinary</HI> Patients, in its
last Stage: And as such have neither <HI>Digestion,</HI>
nor Strength to bear active strong <HI>Evacua∣tions,</HI>
or <HI>Alteratives,</HI> their Medicins must
bear a <HI>Proportion</HI> to their <HI>Diet</HI> and Imbecil∣lity;
there is no Evacuation proper and ac∣commodated
to their Strength and Spirits,
but weak wash Vomits, often repeated, ten
or twelve Grains of Powder, or an Ounce of
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
the Tincture of <HI>Ipecacuana</HI> work'd with Cha∣momil-Flower-Tea,
and provok'd with a Fea∣ther,
once a Week, or at least every Full and
New Moon; but especially upon <HI>Watchful∣ness,
Flatus,</HI> swell'd <HI>Stomachs,</HI> or casual <HI>Ex∣acerbations</HI>
of <HI>Symptoms,</HI> to which all such
are generally subject: But what I much pre∣fer
to all artificial <HI>Emetics,</HI> is tickling the
Throat and <HI>Glands</HI> with their Finger till
they <HI>keck,</HI> and then spitting, or suffering
the Phlegm to run out into a Bason; and
repeating this for thirty or forty differ∣ent
times every Morning, or every second
or third Morning, or as often as they find a
Necessity or Inclination to a painful or labo∣rious
Belching or Explosion of Wind; for
by this Method long and duely pursu'd, they
will empty the <HI>Glands</HI> of their <HI>Phlegm</HI> or
<HI>Choler,</HI> and pump up the <HI>penn'd</HI> Wind with
much more Ease and Safety, than by any
artificial <HI>Emetic</HI> whatsoever; without those
Deluges of nauseous Draughts commonly
used by unskilful <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> to save their
Time; when it is certain from Experience,
that a <HI>dry Vomit,</HI> with little or no Liquor,
though more painful, is infinitly more ef∣fectual,
than two or three <HI>wet Vomits</HI> with
much drinking; for the great Efficacy of
<HI>Vomits</HI> lies in the <HI>Throws</HI> and <HI>Spasms</HI> on
the <HI>Muscles</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> by which the
Obstructions in all the <HI>Glands</HI> are forced
open, the <HI>Size</HI> in the Juices is broken and
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
divided, and the <HI>Perspiration</HI> render'd per∣vious;
and by these <HI>Thumb Vomits,</HI> (as I call
them) without Drink, or Powders, together
with constant drinking Ass's Milk, I have done
<HI>myself</HI> more Service, in mending my Blood,
and plumping up the <HI>Muscles,</HI> as well as
many others, to whom I have communicated
and taught the <HI>Trick,</HI> than by all the other
Operations of <HI>Physic</HI> or <HI>Medicins</HI> I have
ever used in such low and desperat Cases.
This Method is only an Imitation of the <HI>Ope∣rations</HI>
of Nature, which naturally and me∣chanically
prompt all Persons loaded with
<HI>Phlegm, Choler,</HI> or Wind, by tickling their
Throat till they keck, to throw them off; which
generally relieves in such a Circumstance, like
<HI>Sneezing;</HI> and <HI>Medicus debet solummodo Na∣turae
administrare.</HI> And any one who has an
Aversion to <HI>artificial Vomits,</HI> may by Prac∣tice,
and bringing the <HI>Muscles</HI> of the <HI>Abdo∣men</HI>
to an easy <HI>Play,</HI> get a Facility in this
<HI>Trick,</HI> for his certain Relief on all necessary
Occasions, as I have found to my great Com∣fort,
and the Relief of many others, especi∣ally
the Delicat▪ <HI>Hysterical,</HI> Wasted, and Low-spirited:
But it must be pursued with Obsti∣nacy
and Perseverance, till a Facility be ac∣quir'd.</P>
<P>§. 4. THE only Inconveniency of such fre∣quent
<HI>Thumb</HI> or other <HI>Vomits</HI> is, that the neces∣sary
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> caused by them sometimes makes
<PB N="249" REF="265"/>
them extremely and painfully <HI>costive.</HI> But so
far is this from being a real Evil, that it is
one of the best Effects these <HI>Vomits</HI> can pro∣duce;
for any Degree of Looseness or Purge∣ing
is almost certain Death to such Persons,
and they generally go off in a <HI>Colliquative
Diarrhoea,</HI> which these <HI>Thumb-Vomits</HI> gene∣rally
remedy or prevent; for these <HI>Diarrhoea's</HI>
in such tender and <HI>thin</HI> Persons, not only
carry off all their Food, but indicat that the
whole <HI>System</HI> of the Solids and <HI>Nerves</HI> are
irrecoverably relax'd. But should such a
<HI>Costiveness</HI> be obstinat and troublesome, a
little <HI>lenitive</HI> Electuary over Night, a
Drachm of <HI>Lac</HI> or <HI>Flores Sulphuris,</HI> an <HI>An∣derson</HI>'s
or a <HI>Rufi</HI> Pill or two, will safely and
gently relieve; a Milk or a Broth Clyster,
with a little Oil of Sweet <HI>Almonds,</HI> will
bring forth the harden'd Balls, that obstruct
the <HI>peristaltic</HI> Motion; supping on Apples
and Milk, stew'd <HI>Prunes</HI> with <HI>Senna,</HI> or any
such-like gentle <HI>Aperient,</HI> will constantly
relieve this <HI>Symptom:</HI> But in Reality, unless
it becomes extremely painful and obstinat, it
is much better to bear than relieve it; for
thereby the Food has a longer Time to pass
the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> to mend the Blood, and plump
up the <HI>Muscles,</HI> and to allow the Solids and
<HI>Nerves</HI> to constringe, to crisp up, and regain
their <HI>Buckle</HI> and Spring; for I know nothing
that depresses the Spirits, wastes the Flesh,
and relaxes the whole <HI>System</HI> of the Nerves
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
and Solids, so much as frequent and copious
Purgeing and Stooling, as is well known in
the common and unnatural <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Go∣norrhoea
Virulenta;</HI> and therefore I seldom
or never use any <HI>Purgatives</HI> myself, nor pre∣scribe
them to my <HI>nervous</HI> and <HI>valetudinary</HI>
Patients: More Abstinence even under a low
Diet, more Exercise, and <HI>Thumb-Vomits,</HI> always
supply to me the Place of <HI>Cathartics,</HI> in such
delicat Cases: It is only the Strong, Robust, and
those of too hard and firm <HI>Nerves,</HI> that success∣fully
bear much Purgeing; and I think two
pretty severe Vomits hurt not the Constitution
so much as one <HI>drastic</HI> Purge; for it is notori∣ously
known in all such Cases and Constitutions
as are now under Consideration, that it is the
<HI>Relaxation</HI> and Imbecillity of the Stomach
that is the great Cause of all their Sufferings,
together with the Viscidity of the Juices;
and if these be sufficiently attended to, all
the rest will come about in Time; the <HI>Sto∣mach</HI>
itself, like a broken Leg, by giving it
little to do, or using it very spareingly, will
knit, thicken, and consolidat of itself mecha∣nically;
the infinit Glands of the Stomach
and Guts, constantly spewing out their viscid
Contents, want frequent Cleanseings by
<HI>Thumb-Vomits;</HI> below they are fewer to∣wards
the <HI>Rectum</HI> and <HI>Anus,</HI> and so these
want fewer Cleanseings by Purgeing.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="267"/>
§. 5. WHEN the <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Juices</HI> are
<HI>thick, viscid,</HI> and <HI>glewy,</HI> (as they always are
in such Cases) and thereby all the <HI>Capillaries</HI>
and smaller <HI>Lymphatic</HI> Vessels are stuffed, ob∣structed,
and compressed, nothing will give
them Relief, Freedom, and <HI>Roomyness,</HI> like
little frequent <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> three, four, five,
or six Ounces at most every <HI>Week, Month,</HI> or
<HI>Quarter,</HI> as they can bear it, or as the Blood
appears when let out of a large Orifice; but
it is never to be continued after the Blood
hath lost its <HI>Buff,</HI> or its <HI>liverish Crassity,</HI> nor
after the Patient goes into Fainting, or long
Lowness upon <HI>Letting;</HI> for if either of these
ensue to any Degree, it is a certain Sign
<HI>Phlebotomy</HI> will no longer do (no not
in any Case where <HI>Phlebotomy</HI> is perform'd;
for where it is proper, it will always raise
the Spirits in a little time after); nor is the
Evil in the great <HI>Trunk</HI> Vessels, but in the
smallest Branches and <HI>Capillaries,</HI> for which
another Method is to be tried, afterwards to
be suggested. But as long as the <HI>Blood</HI> is still
cover'd with a <HI>Buff</HI> or Parchment, its <HI>Curd</HI>
still <HI>liverish,</HI> and its <HI>Serum</HI> yellow, tawny, or
saltish, and the <HI>Patient</HI> has rather better than
worse <HI>Spirits</HI> after it, little frequent <HI>Phlebo∣tomies</HI>
will be of great Service to give the
Juiees room to circulat, to take off the Re∣sistance
from them, to the <HI>motive</HI> and <HI>elastic</HI>
Powers of the <HI>Organs</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> and to
supply its Room with soft, mild, sweet and
<PB N="252" REF="268"/>
sound Juices, which by Degrees will <HI>assi∣milat</HI>
and mix with the old <HI>viscid Mass,</HI> and
mend it. I have known beginning <HI>Phthises
Pulmonum, Hectics, Pleurisies</HI> and <HI>Rheuma∣tisms,</HI>
often prevented or cured by these, when
a soft, sweet whey <HI>Diet</HI> has been join'd to them.</P>
<P>§. 6. WHEN the <HI>Blood</HI> is brought to a
pretty tolerable State in the <HI>Trunks</HI> of the
great Vessels, and the Fault seems now con∣fin'd
to the <HI>Glands, Capillaries,</HI> or <HI>Lym∣phatics,</HI>
the <HI>alterative</HI> Medicins, that are most
likely, that I ever could find to reach them,
were <HI>Cinnabar native</HI> or <HI>factitious,</HI> the <HI>Aqua
Argentea, Millepedae, Nitre,</HI> and <HI>Lac Sul∣phuris,</HI>
with the <HI>Testacea,</HI> combin'd in such
Forms as were most agreeable to the Patient,
or sat lightest on the Stomach. I can honestly
aver it, I never saw such salutary Effects
in any obstinat <HI>Cases,</HI> especially such as
those now under Consideration, as from long
Perseverance under large Doses of <HI>native</HI> or
<HI>factitious Cinnabar,</HI> wash'd down with Ass's
Milk, or sweet Whey. It seldom gives any
Trouble, unless it be in the Stomach at first;
and has no sensible Operation, but sweeten∣ing
and attenuating the Blood in the smallest
Vessels gradually: It only keeps from trou∣blesome
<HI>Costiveness</HI> such weak <HI>Constitutions,</HI>
by the <HI>Sulphur</HI> in its Composition. I have
given it for a long Time to <HI>three Drachms</HI> a
Day in any Vehicle; and twice a Year, Spring
and Fall, for six Weeks; and had it continued
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
for twenty Years, by which the Patient has
grown strong and fat at last. And I take it
to be a much nobler Medicin for mending
the Blood, and opening the Capillary <HI>Glands,</HI>
and preventing acute Distempers, provided
due Temperance and Exercise be join'd to it,
than even my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s so fam'd <HI>Catho∣licon
Nitre,</HI> which yet is most certainly a
noble Simple, and the greatest <HI>Antidot</HI> against
<HI>Inflammations</HI> and <HI>feverish</HI> Disorders known
to Men. Experience shews that it attenuats
and malaxes the <HI>Curd</HI> of the Blood, and
thins its viscid <HI>Serum,</HI> even in the Air, or
in Blood let out; and its Effects on <HI>Fire,</HI> and
in <HI>Respiration,</HI> prove it the greatest Friend
to <HI>animal</HI> Bodies. The <HI>Millepedae,</HI> as is
known, are nothing but a simple kind of <HI>Sal
Armoniac,</HI> or <HI>Nitre, mill'd</HI> by <HI>animal Or∣gans,</HI>
and intimatly mix'd with <HI>animal</HI> Juices;
and is noted for its Efficacy in Inflammations
on the Eyes, and Obstructions in the <HI>optic</HI>
Nerves and <HI>Glands,</HI> and sure they are among
the most delicat of <HI>animal Organs.</HI> The Fault
is, these are not given long enough, nor in
sufficient Quantity, to produce any great or
sensible Effects: But I firmly believe them to
be far beyond all your now fam'd <HI>chymical</HI>
and quack <HI>Secrets,</HI> Drops or Pills, if a pro∣per
Regimen be join'd with them, and are
without all possible Danger to the weakest
<HI>Infant.</HI> As to the <HI>Testacea,</HI> their Nature
and Operation are sufficiently known, and
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
their Texture visible by a common <HI>Micro∣scope,
viz.</HI> that they are only solid <HI>Spunges,</HI>
which suck, <HI>attract</HI> and receive into their
<HI>Pores</HI> all <HI>Acids</HI> where-ever they meet them,
especially in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> where <HI>Acids</HI>
are chiefly to be found; and I am certain,
<HI>Cinnabar, Crabs-eyes, Nitre,</HI> and <HI>Cochineal,</HI>
finely powder'd, and wash'd down with any
agreeable acidulated Draught, such as the
<HI>solin</HI> one of <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> and Juice
of Lemon duely mix'd in common Water,
Milk, or Barley-water acidulated with <HI>Cur∣rant-Jelly,</HI>
and the like, is one of the best
<HI>Febrifuges</HI> known to Men, particularly where
no <HI>cutaneous</HI> Eruption, or <HI>critical</HI> Push, is
expected; for then these Medicins must be
assisted with some warmer constringent and
propelling Mixtures, to forward this Effect.</P>
<P>§. 7. FRICTION with a <HI>coarse Towel,</HI>
warm Flanel, but especially the <HI>Flesh-brush,</HI>
over the whole Body, and particularly the
<HI>Spine</HI> and <HI>Limbs,</HI> is an admirable Operation
to allicit the Blood and Juices to the Surface
of the Body, and consequently to plump the
<HI>Muscles.</HI> It rubs out and discharges the
<HI>Plugs</HI> and <HI>Obstructions</HI> in the Orifices of the
perspiratory <HI>Glands;</HI> and if the whole Skin
be wash'd after with a <HI>wet Towel</HI> in warm
Water in cold Weather, and in cold Water
in hot Weather, it will contribute to free it
from the <HI>Scurf,</HI> and chopp'd <HI>Cuticle,</HI> that clogs
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
the <HI>Perspiration,</HI> which will greatly serve to
promote the <HI>Circulation;</HI> and this <HI>Method</HI>
ought to be continued for half or a quarter
of an Hour, Morning and Night; and a close
streight-button'd Cotton <HI>Waistcoat,</HI> for con∣stant
Friction, ought to be worn next the
Skin, and a <HI>broad Belt</HI> about the <HI>Loins,</HI> to
keep all the Bowels and the <HI>Lacteals</HI> in their
proper and natural Situation.</P>
<P>§. 8. WHEN the <HI>Blood</HI> is in a good mea∣sure
thinn'd and sweeten'd, (which a little
<HI>Phlebotomy</HI> will always discover, by com∣paring
the Blood with that of a Sheep or
Calf) the best Medicins for braceing, tanning
and hardening the Solids, the alimentary
Tubes in particular, are the <HI>Bark,</HI> and its Pre∣parations,
the <HI>Extract</HI> of the <HI>Bark</HI> with a
third part of the Extract of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> made
into Pills with <HI>Balsamum Polychrest.</HI> or an
<HI>Electuary</HI> of these, with any agreeable Syrup;
about half a Drachm or forty Grains of these
twice a Day on an empty Stomach, wash'd
down with <HI>Bristol</HI> Water, or the following
<HI>Apozem, viz.</HI> six Drachms of powder'd
<HI>Quinquina,</HI> half an Ounce of <HI>Misleto,</HI> three
Drachms of the <HI>Extract</HI> of <HI>wild Valerian,</HI>
two of <HI>Orange</HI> Peel, half a Drachm of <HI>Car∣damoms,</HI>
and one Drachm of <HI>Cochineal,</HI> in∣fus'd
in three half Pints of <HI>Bristol</HI> Water to
a Quart, strain'd and filtred, about four or
five Spoonfuls of this for a Dose, for six
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
Weeks, Spring and Fall; chewing and swallow∣ing
a Scruple or half a Drachm of fine <HI>Jesuits
Bark</HI> three times a Day, on an empty Stomach,
and every third Night chewing a <HI>Scruple</HI> of <HI>Rhu∣barb,</HI>
is an excellent Bracer in such a low <HI>Case;</HI>
and ten or fifteen Drops of <HI>Elixir</HI> of <HI>Vitriol</HI>
in a Glass of fresh <HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water,
(if it does not tighten too quickly, or pain
such tender Entrails) taken twice a Day,
would much serve the same End, and give
Appetite, Strength and Spirits.</P>
<P>§. 9. COLD Batheing in the <HI>Sea,</HI> or a <HI>Ri∣ver,</HI>
a cold <HI>Bath,</HI> or Batheing-Tub, at least
all the hot Part of the Summer, would greatly
advance the same Purpose; but even this so
effectual a <HI>Strengthener</HI> will be of little or
no Value, unless the <HI>Blood</HI> be already thinn'd
and sweeten'd. I myself have tried it many
Hundreds of Times, with no manner of Be∣nefit;
nay, in some it has been attended with
many Incommodities, and much Danger of vio∣lent
<HI>Head-achs, Chills, Contractions</HI> and <HI>Inter∣mittent
Fevers,</HI> if too long or too hastily pur∣sued,
before the Blood was mended, which
when effected, both I and many others have
found great Benefit from it; so that I have
never advis'd Cold Batheing since, without
previously, by <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> seeing into the
State of their Juices and Bowels; and always
forbad it, when I found them bad. It is
always necessary, at least at first, to have the
Head well spung'd, and cool'd with cold Wa∣ter,
<PB N="257" REF="273"/>
before plungeing; and they should either
be thrown in Head-foremost, or, which I
think safest, walk down the Steps as fast as
they can, and bending their Knees, and short∣ening
their Bodies, get their Heads under
Water; this for three or four times in the cold
Bath, and out again, which ought not to
exceed two or three Minutes. In a River or
the Sea they may continue ten or fifteen
Minutes: For, like all other <HI>medical</HI> Ope∣rations,
it is much better to be perform'd
often, and but little at once, than to be
long about it at one time: <HI>Gutta cavat la∣pidem
non vi, sed saepe cadendo.</HI> It is cer∣tainly,
in valetudinary and wasted Constitu∣tions,
of great Efficacy in warm Seasons,
when the Blood is sufficiently thinn'd.</P>
<P>§. 10. BUT no Rule or Institution for
braceing the Solids and Nerves is equal to
<HI>Exercise</HI> of all kinds. <HI>Rideing, Coaching,
Walking, Bowling,</HI> playing at <HI>Shuttlecock;</HI> in
short, all Exercise of whatever kind it be, is
good and beneficial. In Winter and bad
Weather, within Doors the <HI>Tremoussoir,</HI> a
<HI>Hamock,</HI> the <HI>Dumb-Bell,</HI> plying a <HI>Pump,</HI>
walking in a Gallery, or a <HI>Suite</HI> of Rooms;
in good Weather these other mentioned Ex∣ercises,
and many more mentioned by <HI>Gy∣mnastic</HI>
Writers, of which the ingenious Vale∣tudinarian
may contrive some properly suited
to the Weakness of his particular <HI>Organs,</HI> or
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
Limbs: But none of them will be of any great
Efficacy, without joining a proper sweetening
and diluteing <HI>Regimen. Exercise</HI> ought to be
constant, uniform and regular as <HI>Diet,</HI> and
to be pursued on an empty Stomach, at as
great a Distance from Meals as is possible; not
violent, nor long at a time, but orderly at
proper Hours; and no more interrupted any
long time than Food; not to Sweating, but
to Warmth. I am greatly persuaded Rideing
is best for Digestion, for dispersing and open∣ing
<HI>abdominal</HI> and <HI>meseraic glandular</HI> Ob∣structions;
but Walking is best for <HI>Nutrition,</HI>
distributing the <HI>Chyle,</HI> and plumping up the
<HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Muscles.</HI> Violence and Obstinacy
in Exercise of any kind, is destructive to
Health, and has the same ill Consequences as
all other <HI>Excesses.</HI></P>
<P>§. 11. IT is surprising, that Mankind, <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI>
especially, have been so late in exa∣mining
and discovering the great Benefit of
<HI>mineral</HI> Waters of the several kinds. First
Plants, Fruits, Seeds, and Roots, were tried
for the <HI>Cure</HI> of Distempers; and in examining
them, little else was necessary to observe but
the Use the several kinds of <HI>Animals</HI> made
of them for their Food or Physic, when ail∣ing
or aggriev'd: After that, Men observ'd
what Effect the Juices and Flesh of several
<HI>Animals</HI> had on some Constitutions and Dis∣orders,
for Food or Physic; then they pra∣ctis'd
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
on the Minerals of all kinds, which was
a most unnatural and <HI>unphilosophical</HI> Course of
Medicins, at least when not infinitly levigated
and refin'd; and even then scarce ever proper
to enter an <HI>animal</HI> Body, or its delicat <HI>Mean∣ders,</HI>
at least humanly prepar'd; as we see
by the <HI>brute</HI> Creation, which by no Art will
ever be brought to swallow them spontane∣ously,
even in Water for Drink. But to fit
the <HI>Minerals,</HI> (even against the Intentions and
in spite of Nature) the <HI>Tortures</HI> of the Fire
in <HI>chymical</HI> Preparations have been found out
and applied, which I am convinc'd have been
more pernicious and destructive to human
Creatures, either in its <HI>vegetable</HI> or <HI>animal,</HI>
much more in its <HI>mineral Products,</HI> than
<HI>Gunpowder</HI> itself; and all this Time the salu∣tary
Effects of the natural, or, I may say, the
divine Preparations of the <HI>mineral</HI> Tribe, com∣bined,
proportioned and divided infinitly in
the several kinds of <HI>mineral Waters,</HI> have been
overlook'd; and yet, I may say, there is scarce
a <HI>Mile square</HI> on the Surface of the <HI>Globe,</HI> at
least not a Mountain or even Hillock, where
there springs not up some <HI>mineral</HI> Water,
fitted for the Cure of human Distempers in
all the kinds of Medicin, <HI>Evacuant, Altera∣tive,</HI>
or <HI>Strengthening,</HI> if duely examined,
and judiciously directed, especially if a proper
<HI>Regimen</HI> of Diet were joined to them. And
I think it Demonstration, that where there is
a <HI>Hill</HI> or considerable Eminence, there must
be a <HI>mineral</HI> Water, since a Hill is nothing
<PB N="260" REF="276"/>
but the Nest of some <HI>Mineral;</HI> but there will
be requir'd Skill and Experience to fit them
to the Disease and the Patient. I should
hope, since the infinit Variety of <HI>mineral</HI> Wa∣ters
in his Majesty's Dominions, have been
begun to be carefully examin'd, and their
several Compositions, Natures, and Virtues,
have been, with some Exactness, inquir'd into
and found, if Temperance and <HI>Propriety</HI> in
<HI>Diet</HI> were universally studied and recom∣mended,
the better sort of People might pass
their Lives in less <HI>Misery</HI> than they common∣ly
do; for I cannot but think the <HI>Author</HI> of
Nature, who has so liberally provided for the
Wants and Necessities of all his Creatures,
(among which Want of Health is the most
material and weighty for all the Ends of Live∣ing,
in order to present or future Felicity)
has appointed and marked out, by his own
<HI>Signature,</HI> some general <HI>one</HI> for this Purpose;
and in fifty Years Study and Observation, I
could never yet meet with any one that has this
<HI>Mark</HI> of divine Appointment so glareingly as
a <HI>low Diet</HI> in general, and in particular Cases
a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet, or a Diet of very
little animal Food, and common or <HI>mineral</HI>
Water Beverage of one <HI>specific</HI> Kind or
other, fitted to the Complaints and <HI>Sym∣ptoms.</HI>
The Determination of the <HI>specific
Mineral</HI> Water must be left to the Sagacity
of the <HI>Physician</HI> in ordinary, and to the
Kinds, Degrees, and several Stages of the
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
Distempers. But I think one or other may
be easily found, that would greatly alleviat
the Complaints of most <HI>Valetudinarians;</HI> and
few or none of them are much hurtful
in any Case, but what the <HI>Patient</HI> will
readily find himself, or an ordinary <HI>Physician</HI>
may distinguish. The chalybeat mineral Wa∣ters
are all Astringent and Invigorating, the
salin all Evacuant, and the cretaceous all Alte∣rative
and Sweetening, and a Mixture of Prin∣ciples
has a compounded Effect.</P>
<P>§. 12. IT is of the utmost Consequence,
that such <HI>valetudinarian,</HI> wasted, thin Con∣stitutions,
breathe a good, kindly and benign
<HI>Air.</HI> I have often had Occasion to mention
of what Use and Necessity the <HI>Air</HI> is to atte∣nuat,
enliven and brighten <HI>animal Blood</HI> and
Juices, as is manifest from the Difference
between the <HI>arterial</HI> Blood <HI>mill'd</HI> and clari∣fy'd
by the <HI>Air</HI> and its <HI>Nitre</HI> in the <HI>Lungs,</HI>
and the <HI>venal</HI> Blood, which has not as yet
gone through that Operation, or is stumm'd in
its slow and remoter <HI>Circulation.</HI> A pure,
clean, tepid, dry <HI>Air,</HI> saturated with a due
Degree of <HI>volatil Nitre,</HI> and the Steams of
<HI>odoriferous</HI> and <HI>sanative Plants,</HI> induces a
<HI>Balsam</HI> and Liveliness on <HI>animal</HI> Juices, as
is evident from the Difference between <HI>Sum∣mer</HI>
and <HI>Winter,</HI> fair and cloudy Weather,
on <HI>Animals</HI> of all Kinds; and therefore a
<HI>Valetudinarian</HI> should chuse to live in an
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
open <HI>Champaign</HI> Country, guarded from
Northerly and Easterly Winds, of a moderat
Elevation, or in a <HI>Medium</HI> between the <HI>Tops</HI>
of the highest neighbouring Hills and the Sur∣face
of the <HI>Sea</HI> or <HI>Rivers;</HI> and have his
Windows exposed to <HI>South</HI> or <HI>West,</HI> and his
Bed-chamber <HI>ventilated</HI> by open Windows
in the Day-time. The true Reason, <HI>Philo∣sophy,</HI>
and Benefit of all which is, with great
Judgment and Elegance, explain'd and en∣forc'd
by the ingenious and learned Dr. <HI>Ar∣buthnot</HI>
in his <HI>Essay on Air.</HI></P>
<P>§. 13. I HAVE been longer and more par∣ticular
on this Distemper than any other, be∣cause
it is a general one, includeing <HI>Scurvy,
Scrophula, Atrophy, Phthisis, Gout, Stone,
Asthma,</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Disorders of all kinds,
in their last Stages, which are generally, one
or other, the radical and fundamental Disease
or Source of all <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers whatso∣ever,
attended with an <HI>Atrophy.</HI> I have taken
this Case in its last <HI>Stage,</HI> and worst State,
and carried it on from thence to its Term,
either in <HI>Death,</HI> or such a Degree of <HI>Recovery</HI>
and <HI>Health,</HI> as an hereditary Valetudinarian can
expect, or rise to; which can never indeed be to
the Force and Vigour of a <HI>Kite</HI> or <HI>Carrion-Crow,</HI>
but to the Spirits of a chearful, joyful
<HI>Nightingale</HI> or <HI>Lark:</HI> And I have labour'd
it more, as to <HI>Perspicuity</HI> and <HI>Detail,</HI> than
that of any other <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper, be∣cause
<PB N="263" REF="279"/>
it is the <HI>Lot</HI> of the brightest, most
acute, and penetrating <HI>Genii,</HI> and because I
intend it as a <HI>Model</HI> for all the more and less
piteous Stages of this, or any other <HI>chronical</HI>
Distemper; for slighter <HI>Symptoms</HI> and better
<HI>Circumstances</HI> of this or these Disorders, will
require less Time, Attention or Exactness in
their Cure; for it is undeniable,
<Q>Quod potest majus, potest minus,</Q></P>
<P>BUT here I beg the Reader to attend, that I
by no means intend these <HI>Directions</HI> and
<HI>Methods</HI> for the <HI>Strong</HI> and the <HI>Robust:</HI> Their
<HI>Medicins</HI> and <HI>medical Operations,</HI> to do them
any Service, must bear a Proportion to their
own natural Strength, and the Obstinacy or
Painfulness of the Distemper. This Method
would be to such, like battering a <HI>Fort</HI> with
<HI>Popguns.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the different Powers of Diet, and of the
Diseases each Kind is capable to cure or
eradicat.</HEAD>
<P>1. A Total Ass-milk Diet (about two
Quarts a Day, without any other
Meat or Drink) will, in time, cure a <HI>Cancer</HI>
in any part of the Body, with mere common
Dressings, provided the Patient is not quite
worn out before it is begun; or too far gone
<PB N="264" REF="280"/>
in the common <HI>Duration</HI> of Life: And even
in that Case, it will lessen the Pain, lengthen
Life, and make Death easier; especially if
join'd with small interspers'd <HI>Phlebotomies,
Millepedae, Crabs-eyes</HI> prepared, <HI>Nitre,</HI> and
<HI>Rhubarb,</HI> properly managed: But the <HI>Diet,</HI>
even after the Cure, must be continued; and
never after greatly altered, unless it be into
Cow-milk with Seeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Astruc <HI>de Re Venerea.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. ANY <HI>Cancer</HI> that can be cut out, con∣tracted
and healed up, with common, <HI>i. e.</HI>
soft, cool, gently astringent Dressings, and at
last left as an <HI>Issue</HI> on the Part, by a Cow-milk
and Seed Diet, ever after continued in,
may be made as easy to the Patient, and his
Life and Health as long preserved, as if al∣most
he had never been afflicted with it, espe∣cially
if under <HI>Fifty.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>A TOTAL Milk and Seed Diet,</HI>
gentle and frequent <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI> as <HI>Sym∣ptoms</HI>
exasperat, a little <HI>Ipecacuhana</HI> or <HI>Thumb-Vomit,</HI>
repeated once or twice a Week,
chewing <HI>Quill-Bark</HI> in a Morning, and a few
Grains of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> at Night, will totally cure
<HI>Consumptions;</HI> even when attended with <HI>Tu∣bercles,</HI>
an <HI>Haemoptoe,</HI> and <HI>Hectic,</HI> in the
<HI>first Stage;</HI> will greatly relieve, if not cure,
in the <HI>second Stage,</HI> especially if Rideing, and
<PB N="265" REF="281"/>
a warm clear Air, be joined; and make
<HI>Death</HI> easier in the <HI>third</HI> and last <HI>Stage.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>A TOTAL Cow-milk Diet,</HI> about
two Quarts a Day, without any other Food,
will, at last, totally <HI>cure</HI> all kinds of <HI>Fits,
Epileptic, Hysterical</HI> or <HI>Apoplectic,</HI> (which
are all but Degrees or <HI>Symptoms</HI> of one
general Disease, which I call <HI>Scorbutico-ner∣vose,</HI>
or the plain <HI>Scurvy,</HI> in its last Stage)
if enter'd upon before Fifty: But the Patient,
if near Fifty, must ever after continue in the
same Diet, with the Addition only of Seeds;
otherwise his <HI>Fits</HI> will return oftener, and
more severely, and at last cut him off.</P>
<P>5. <HI>A TOTAL Cow-milk Diet,</HI> without
any other Food, will bid fairest to cure a
<HI>Haemiplegia,</HI> or even a dead <HI>Palsy,</HI> and conse∣quently
all the lesser Degrees of a partial <HI>one,</HI>
if enter'd upon before Fifty: And this Dis∣temper
I take to be the most obstinat, intract∣able
and disheartening one, that can afflict
the human <HI>Machin;</HI> and is chiefly pro∣duced
by intemperat <HI>Lechery,</HI> with its neces∣sary
Attendant habitual <HI>Luxury.</HI> It may be
retarded in its Progress by strong <HI>Vomits,
Mercurial</HI> and <HI>foetid Gum</HI> Medicins, <HI>Air,
Gestation,</HI> the <HI>Pilulae Aethiopicae</HI> of the
<HI>Edinburgh Dispensatory</HI> of the last Edition,
with Water Beverage, and Mineral Water, and
cold or hot Batheing in the respective Seasons;
<PB N="266" REF="282"/>
but is never to be eradicated, if the Stroke is
deep, or Life far spent, but by <HI>Cow-milk</HI> only.</P>
<P>6. <HI>A TOTAL Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> with
gentle <HI>Vomits</HI> before and after the <HI>Fits,</HI>
chewing <HI>Bark</HI> in a Morning and <HI>Rhubarb</HI> at
Night, with <HI>Phlebotomy</HI> about the <HI>Equi∣noxes,</HI>
will perfectly <HI>cure</HI> the <HI>Gout,</HI> in Per∣sons
under Fifty, and greatly relieve those
further advanced in Life; even those who have
<HI>chalky Nodes,</HI> and <HI>fix'd Joints,</HI> especially join'd
with Air and Exercise, and strong and constant
<HI>Friction;</HI> but must be continu'd ever after, if
such desire to continue well.</P>
<P>7. <HI>SOAP-LEES,</HI> soften'd with a little Oil
of <HI>sweet Almonds,</HI> drunk about a quarter of an
Ounce twice a Day on a fasting Stomach,
or <HI>Soap</HI> and <HI>Egg-shell</HI> Pills, with a <HI>total Milk
and Seed Diet,</HI> and <HI>Bristol</HI> Water Beverage,
will either totally dissolve the <HI>Stone</HI> in <HI>Kidnies</HI>
or <HI>Bladder,</HI> or render it almost as easy as the
<HI>Nail</HI> on one's <HI>Finger,</HI> if the Patient is under
Fifty; and much relieve him, even after that
Age.</P>
<P>OF all these mentioned Cases and Cures,
I have known or treated Instances, so that
they may with high Probability, and <HI>medical</HI>
Certainty, be depended on. The following
are reasonable and probable, but not so cer∣tain,
for want of sufficient Experiments.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="283"/>
8. <HI>A TOTAL Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> with
cool Purges now-and-then, as of <HI>Manna</HI> and
<HI>Cream</HI> of Tartar, or <HI>Glauber</HI>'s Salt, with a
Pill of the <HI>Praecipitat. per Se,</HI> or Pills of the
<HI>Mercurius Alcalisatus,</HI> with <HI>Terebinthina
Cocta,</HI> will, in six Weeks or a Month,
totally cure and eradicat any <HI>Venereal</HI> Dis∣temper
in its <HI>first Stage,</HI> or while it is only
term'd a <HI>Gonorrhoea Virulenta,</HI> without other
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> if <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Rhubarb</HI> are chew'd
for some time after, to consolidat and con∣stringe.</P>
<P>9. <HI>A TOTAL Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> con∣tinued
for six or eight Months, will totally
cure and extirpat <HI>Venereal</HI> Distempers in their
<HI>second Stage,</HI> (when they may be called the
Great Pox, with <HI>Bubo's, Cancers,</HI> and <HI>Cuta∣neous
Defedations</HI>) if Pills of <HI>Praecipitat. per
Se,</HI> or of <HI>Mercurius Alcalisatus</HI> and <HI>Gum
Guaiac,</HI> with Dressings of the <HI>Unguentum
Neopolitanum</HI> constantly applied, be join'd
and constantly persisted in dureing that Time,
which may be done without keeping House, or
Interruption of Business.</P>
<P>10. IN those who for the last Stages of
<HI>Venereal</HI> Diseases have unsuccessfully gone
through a full <HI>Salivation,</HI> a total <HI>Milk and
Seed</HI> Diet, long and strictly continued in,
would certainly cure and eradicat the Distem∣per,
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
if no other <HI>hereditary</HI> Disease be com∣plicated
with it: Whereas, in the common
Management, a total <HI>Cure</HI> is seldom to be
obtain'd, and thereby many are miserable all
their Days.</P>
<P>11. AN habitual <HI>Asthma,</HI> if managed with
a <HI>Milk and Seed Diet, Quicksilver</HI> well puri∣fied
half an Ounce twice a Day, <HI>Squill Vo∣mits</HI>
about <HI>new</HI> and <HI>full</HI> Moon, and after
with the <HI>Squill Pills</HI> of the <HI>Edinburgh Dis∣pensatory,</HI>
might be totally eradicated; espe∣cially
if a Southern <HI>Climate,</HI> and warm clear
Air, were join'd.</P>
<P>12. IN a painful and dangerous <HI>Pleurisy,</HI>
after a good part of the <HI>Size</HI> of the Blood
has been drawn off by large <HI>Phlebotomies,</HI>
and the Distemper, by <HI>saponaceous</HI> and oily
<HI>Emulsions,</HI> with <HI>volatil Alcalies,</HI> is lessen'd;
if a <HI>total Milk and Seed Diet</HI> were instituted
and duely persisted in, the <HI>Blood</HI> and Juices
would in time thereby be sweeten'd, and a
Return, a <HI>Phthisis,</HI> and an <HI>Empyema,</HI> be
effectually prevented.</P>
<P>13. <HI>A MILK and Seed Diet,</HI> with Vo∣mits
of <HI>Ipecacohana,</HI> and a few Grains of
<HI>Tartar Emetic,</HI> repeated every <HI>new</HI> and <HI>full
Moon;</HI> in the Intervals, <HI>Alcalisatus,</HI> and
<HI>Guaiac</HI> Pills continued; and when the Blood
is sufficiently attenuated, and the Obstructions
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
opened, if <HI>cold Batheing,</HI> with <HI>vegetable</HI>
Astringents, (Bark especially) were imploy'd
to finish the Cure, and the same Regimen
ever after continued; this Method, I think,
would sooner, more pleasantly, and more
dureably, cure and extirpat all kinds of <HI>Ma∣nia's,
Phrensies,</HI> and <HI>Madnesses,</HI> (which are so
shamefully frequent in <HI>Britain</HI>) than the
common one of treating them with tearing
<HI>Emetics,</HI> and scrapeing <HI>Cathartics,</HI> under the
usual full strong <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>animal Food,</HI> which
does but add Fewel to the Distemper; and
generally the Distemper returns in a greater
or lesser Degree, to the Party or his Posterity.</P>
<P>14. IN any <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> either from the
<HI>Lungs, Nose, Anus</HI> or <HI>Uterus,</HI> how violent
soever, if after some repeated <HI>Phlebotomies</HI>
to moderat the <HI>Flow,</HI> the Use of <HI>Eaton</HI>'s
<HI>Styptic</HI> in <HI>Bristol</HI> Water, or the <HI>Tinctura
Rosarum,</HI> with <HI>Bark</HI> in <HI>Substance, Extract,</HI>
or <HI>Decoctions,</HI> were freely administred, a
<HI>total Milk or Seed Diet</HI> was ordered and
duely prosecuted, it would totally cure these
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> would at last sweeten and <HI>balmefy</HI>
the Blood and Juices, and prevent Returns.
For all <HI>Haemorrhages</HI> are of the same inflam∣matory
and acrid Nature, differing only
according to the <HI>Part</HI> where the <HI>Rupture</HI> of
the capillary Vein happens, and suppose a
thick <HI>Curd,</HI> and a sharp <HI>Serum</HI> in the <HI>Blood.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="286"/>
15. <HI>A JAUNDICE</HI> (<HI>black</HI> or <HI>yellow</HI>)
proceeding from a spoiled or obstructed <HI>Liver,</HI>
a viscous or morbid <HI>Bile,</HI> or <HI>biliary Stones,</HI>
which prevent the Separation of the <HI>Choler,</HI>
and its Passage into the <HI>Intestins,</HI> by which
means it is forced back into the <HI>Veins,</HI> is
rarely and perhaps never to be totally cured
and eradicated, but by a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Seed Diet,</HI>
frequent and active <HI>Vomits, saponaceous Emul∣sions,</HI>
with <HI>volatil Alcalies, mercurial</HI> Plaisters
on the Region of the <HI>Liver, Bath-waters,</HI>
and constant Rideing. This Method, I know
from Experience, will perform a total dure∣able
Cure, and otherwise I never saw it
effected.</P>
<P>16. <HI>A TOTAL Milk and Seed Diet,</HI>
with sole Water <HI>Beverage,</HI> would at last
cure and extirpat any Degree of the <HI>Scurvy,</HI>
scorbutic <HI>Ulcers,</HI> and impostumated <HI>Glands,</HI>
even the <HI>Lepra Graecorum</HI> and <HI>Arabum,</HI> or at
least make them infinitly easier and better, if
duely continued, and <HI>Aethiops Mineral,
Cinnabar</HI> of <HI>Antimony,</HI> or the <HI>Aqua Ar∣gentea,</HI>
were join'd to it in a long Con∣tinuance.</P>
<P>17. IN every <HI>Chronical</HI> Distemper whatso∣ever,
which always comes on gradually, with
evident Symptoms, when it first seizes a Per∣son,
after <HI>Bleeding,</HI> a <HI>Vomit</HI> and a <HI>Purge,</HI> if
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
the Patient abstain'd ever after from all <HI>fer∣mented</HI>
Liquor, and drank nothing but pure
Water, <HI>cold</HI> or <HI>tepid,</HI> according to the Sea∣sons,
it would very probably cure him effect∣ually,
and secure against <HI>Returns,</HI> at least if
this Beverage was continued, whatever his
solid Food should be.</P>
<P>18. <HI>TOTAL Water Beverage,</HI> with some
occasional <HI>Vomits,</HI> on <HI>Fits,</HI> and once a Week
<HI>Hiera Picra, Tincture</HI> of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> or an
<HI>Anderson</HI>'s or <HI>Ruffi Pill,</HI> Two or Three, will
totally cure, and at last preserve from Re∣turns,
in any <HI>bilious Colic,</HI> let the solid Food
be almost what it will. This I have always
found certain, in Persons of a tolerable good
Constitution, not too far gone in Life.</P>
<P>19. <HI>TOTAL Water Beverage</HI> will rebate
and lessen the Violence of the <HI>Fits</HI> of the
<HI>Gout,</HI> keep them long moderat and <HI>regular,</HI>
and preserve <HI>Life, Limbs,</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> per∣haps
as long as the Constitution was made to
last, whatever his solid Food should be: And
the same is true of the <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> after the
<HI>Fits</HI> are lessen'd by the Means afore directed;
for the <HI>Gout</HI> is but a topical <HI>Rheumatism.</HI></P>
<P>20. <HI>FISH,</HI> in general, is not near so high
and inflammatory as <HI>Flesh,</HI> unless they are
exalted with high and rich <HI>flesh Meat,</HI> and
<HI>spicy</HI> Sauces; though some kinds of Fish, as
<PB N="272" REF="288"/>
<HI>Salmon, Carp, Sturgeon, Lamprey,</HI> &amp;c. are
higher than <HI>Mutton, Veal, Lamb,</HI> and
<HI>Chicken.</HI></P>
<P>21. OF all others, a total <HI>Ass-milk Diet</HI>
is the coolest, most sweetening, and restorative
possible: Next to <HI>it,</HI> is Cow or Goat-milk
<HI>Whey,</HI> if not too flatulent or purgative.
Cow-milk, boil'd or raw, for the whole
Food, is next in Degree to those. <HI>Farina∣ceous</HI>
Seeds (as being young Vegetables with∣out
much Wind or Salts) are in the fourth
Degree of Diet. To these succeed in the
next Degree, the <HI>farinaceous</HI> Roots, as <HI>Tur∣neps,
Potatoes, Parsnips,</HI> &amp;c. but are more
flatulent and windy than Seeds. Higher than
these are the <HI>Pot-herbs</HI> and <HI>Salladin,</HI> but still
more flatulent, even when much boil'd, espe∣cially
with the least Butter. The highest of
all <HI>vegetable</HI> Foods, are the Fruits, especially
the late Fruits, even <HI>Apples</HI> or <HI>Pears;</HI> for all
these are <HI>vinous,</HI> almost as much as the <HI>Grapes,</HI>
which <HI>Grapes</HI> will fuddle and madden <HI>Apes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> The History of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></NOTE>,
as much as Wine or Spirits will human
Creatures: For it is a Mistake to think, that
nothing but fermented Liquors will fuddle and
inflame animal Juice. The Juice of any <HI>vinous</HI>
Vegetable, even unfermented, too plentifully
swallow'd, will quicken the Pulse, and so
intoxicat Animals of very <HI>elastic Solids:</HI> For
<PB N="273" REF="289"/>
neither <HI>Fermentation</HI> nor <HI>Distillation</HI> makes
Wine or Spirits; they only congregat them,
as a Burning-glass does the Rays of the Sun;
they are still Lancets with a slight and thin
Sheath.</P>
<P>22. HALF, or even a whole Pint of old
defecated Wine, with half or even a whole
Pound of any kind of Fish or Flesh, to the
Young, Strong, and Laborious, with the com∣mon
Appurtenances of Bread, light Pudding,
or Tarts, in Twenty-four Hours, (perhaps
best divided into two Meals) with vegetable
Foods for Breakfast and Supper, will preserve
the Young and Healthy till Forty.</P>
<P>23. LEAVING off Flesh-meat Suppers
with Wine, and eating only one moderat
Flesh Meal a Day, will probably preserve any
Person, not labouring under any chronical
Distemper, in good Health, for the first seven
Years after, before Fifty.</P>
<P>24. IF a Man after Forty, though in per∣fect
good Health, begins not to study Regi∣men,
and manage his Diet, at least in Quan∣tity,
I conclude him neither <HI>Physician</HI> nor
<HI>Philosopher,</HI> let his other <HI>Talents</HI> be what
they will; for he thereby trusts the Duration
of his future <HI>Life, Health,</HI> and worldly <HI>Hap∣piness,</HI>
to mere <HI>Casualty,</HI> and blind <HI>Chance,</HI> as
they are called.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="290"/>
25. MILD, soft, middling Malt Liquor is
infinitly fitter for all <HI>British</HI> Constitutions,
whose Appetit and Digestion is as yet tole∣rable,
than any kinds of Wine, either Foreign
or Home-brew'd; it will prevent the <HI>Stone</HI>
and <HI>Gout,</HI> and almost all kind of <HI>Inflamma∣tions,</HI>
and is far best for carrying on Old
Age.</P>
<P>26. PROPER and well-tim'd <HI>Evacuation</HI>
only, lessens <HI>Distempers,</HI> and gives a tolerable
Degree of <HI>Relief</HI> under them; as it removes
<HI>Impediments,</HI> and gives room for <HI>specific</HI>
sweet Juices from the <HI>Chyle</HI> of proper Food
to be receiv'd into the Habit, to dilute and
cool the vitiated Blood and Juices.</P>
<P>27. <HI>ALTERATIVES,</HI> even the <HI>mild
Ponderose,</HI> and the <HI>mineral Astringents,</HI> much
less the <HI>cordial, volatil,</HI> and <HI>aromatic</HI> Tribe
of <HI>internal</HI> Medicins, do but very little to∣wards
the perfect Cure or <HI>Extirpation</HI> of any
natural or internal <HI>Distemper.</HI> They may re∣lieve,
give a short <HI>Reprieve,</HI> throw a little Weight
into the Balance on the Side of the <HI>Cure;</HI>
and so are not to be totally slighted, especi∣ally
in acute Cases; but the <HI>substantial</HI> and
<HI>momentous</HI> Part of the <HI>Cure</HI> lies here: Na∣ture
has so contriv'd the <HI>Animal Machin,</HI> that
the Outlets of <HI>Export</HI> ariseing from <HI>Action,
Exercise,</HI> and the <HI>Performance</HI> of the <HI>Ani∣mal
<PB N="275" REF="291"/>
Functions,</HI> are perpetually changeing and
altering the whole <HI>Machin, Fluids</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI>
either into Better or Worse, and in a few
Years perform it: But the <HI>Orifice</HI> of this
Animal Machin being larger than the <HI>Sum</HI>
of all the <HI>Outlets,</HI> if Care were taken, that in
that time nothing should be receiv'd by the
<HI>Orifice</HI> but what were in its own Nature
<HI>soft, cool, kindly</HI> and <HI>sound, Time</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI>
would preserve the <HI>Animal</HI> in Health, as long
as the Materials of it were made to last; so
that almost the Cure of Diseases is brought to
such a <HI>Problem</HI> as this:</P>
<P>28. A <HI>Vessel</HI> full of a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> or gross
Fluid, being given, which discharges itself by
several <HI>Outlets</HI> at the Bottom, whilst an equal
(or perhaps somewhat a larger) Quantity of fresh
<HI>Water</HI> flows into it from above, to find the
<HI>Time</HI> when the <HI>lixivious Mixture</HI> remaining
shall be less than any <HI>given Quantity.</HI></P>
<P>29. SOME perhaps may <HI>controvert,</HI> nay
<HI>ridicule,</HI> the Doctrin laid down in these <HI>Pro∣positions.</HI>
I shall neither reply to, nor be
moved with, any thing that shall be said against
them. If they are of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI>
they will <HI>stand;</HI> if not, I consent they should
come to <HI>nought.</HI> I have satisfied my own
<HI>Conscience;</HI> the rest belongs to <HI>Providence.</HI>
Possibly Time and bodily Sufferings may
<HI>justify</HI> them; if not to this Generation, per∣haps
<PB N="276" REF="292"/>
to some <HI>succeeding one.</HI> I myself am
convinced, by long and many repeated Expe∣riences,
of their <HI>Justness</HI> and <HI>Solidity.</HI> If
what has been advanced through this whole
<HI>Treatise</HI> does not convince others, nothing I
can add will be sufficient. I will leave only
this <HI>Reflection</HI> with my Reader, <HI>viz.</HI> That all
<HI>Physicians, antient</HI> and <HI>modern,</HI> allow that
a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Seed Diet</HI> will totally cure before
Fifty, and infinitly alleviat after it, the <HI>Con∣sumption,</HI>
the <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> and
the <HI>Gout;</HI> these highest, most mortal, most
painful, and most obstinat Distempers: And
nothing is more certain in Mathematicks, than
<HI>Quod potest Majus, potest Minus;</HI> or, what
will cure the greater, will certainly cure the
lesser Distempers; since it is self-evident, that
all bodily Diseases arise from corrupted Juices,
and spoil'd Solids.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Rules for preventing Infertility in both Sexes,
and Miscarriages in the Female Sex.</HEAD>
<P>1. THERE is no Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI>
perhaps, where great and opulent
Families sooner become extinct, or change
Lineage so quickly, as they do in <HI>England;</HI>
or where such Devastation of the Female
Sex, especially among those of Rank and
Condition, is made by Abortion and dan∣gerous
<PB N="277" REF="293"/>
Child-bearing; and no-where is <HI>Man-Midwifery</HI>
so necessary and profitable a Pro∣fession.
This Misfortune appears not to the
Poor, the Necessitous, or those of the <HI>middling</HI>
Rank; for no-where is there a finer or more
numerous Posterity, than among the <HI>High∣landers</HI>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the <HI>native Irish;</HI> but
to those who have all the Conveniencies and
Delicacies of Life in the greatest Plenty and
Perfection; and if <HI>these</HI> have <HI>Posterity,</HI> they
are often deformed, diseased, stunted and
short-lived. This therefore can happen only
from the Difference in their manner of
<HI>Living</HI> and <HI>Feeding;</HI> unless we should say,
that impartial Providence compensates the
want of some Conveniencies to the <HI>poorer,</HI>
by more considerable Advantages in another
way.</P>
<P>2. IT is certain nothing can produce <HI>Fer∣tility</HI>
in either Sex, but what promotes per∣fect
<HI>Health:</HI> Nothing but <HI>good Blood, Spirits,</HI>
and perfect <HI>animal Functions,</HI> that is, <HI>high
Health,</HI> can beget perfect <HI>Fecundity;</HI> and
therefore all Means and Medicins, all <HI>No∣strums</HI>
and <HI>Specifics,</HI> to procure <HI>Fertility,</HI>
different from these, which produce <HI>good
Blood</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> are arrant <HI>Quackery</HI> and
<HI>Cheating.</HI> This is evident from the <HI>brute
Animals,</HI> who never can procreat, till they
are <HI>healthy, gay,</HI> and <HI>active;</HI> and therefore
the Rules I have adduced in the <HI>former</HI> Part
<PB N="278" REF="294"/>
of this Treatise, for promoting or recovering
<HI>Health,</HI> may, to Persons of a <HI>proper</HI> Age
and Circumstances, be looked upon as so
many Rules for promoteing <HI>Fertility.</HI></P>
<P>3. I THINK it is now pretty evident, to
every unprejudiced Person, who is ever so
little acquainted with the best natural <HI>Phi∣losophy,</HI>
and the latest Discoveries in natural
<HI>History,</HI> with the Uses of the respective <HI>Or∣gans,</HI>
in the different Configuration of the
<HI>Males</HI> and <HI>Females,</HI> together with the plainest
and most certain Laws of <HI>Analogy,</HI> that the
<HI>Principle</HI> of Generation, or the <HI>infinitesi∣mal
Corpuscle</HI> of the <HI>Animal,</HI> is in the
<HI>Male;</HI> and that the <HI>Female</HI> is only, as it
were, the primary <HI>Nurse</HI> to it, furnish'd with
a proper <HI>Nidus</HI> and the <HI>specific</HI> Nutriture for
it, for a certain Time, till it has acquired
Strength enough to bear its own proper
<HI>Element;</HI> which State it no sooner attains
to, than it breaks its Prison, and escapes. This
is the Use of the different <HI>Configuration</HI> of
the <HI>Sexes</HI> when divided; and an <HI>analogous</HI>
Provision for the same Purpose is provided
for those <HI>hermaphroditical</HI> Animals, whose
Situation and Nourishment makes it necessary
they should be so. No <HI>Sperm</HI> hitherto exa∣min'd
by the <HI>Microscope,</HI> after <HI>Liquefaction,</HI>
but discovers these <HI>infinitesiminal Animalculi</HI>
many <HI>Millions</HI> of times less than the smallest
Hair, <HI>liveing, moveing</HI> and <HI>playing</HI> in the
<PB N="279" REF="295"/>
<HI>pellucid</HI> Fluid; and if it is not so, no <HI>Genera∣tion</HI>
ever follows. These <HI>Animalculi</HI> we may
justly suppose to have been originally form'd
by the <HI>immediat</HI> and <HI>omnipotent Word</HI> of
the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI> no <HI>second</HI> Causes
whatever haveing either Skill or Power
enough to produce them in this their <HI>infi∣nitesimal
Parvitude,</HI> and to be contain'd
within one another in a <HI>similarly decrease∣ing
Proportion,</HI> back to the <HI>first Pair:</HI> and
originally lodged in some convenient <HI>Cells,</HI>
near the <HI>prostate Glands,</HI> or in some of the
<HI>Appendages</HI> of the <HI>Testes, analogous</HI> to the
Place of the <HI>Ovarium</HI> in the <HI>Female,</HI> till the
<HI>Male</HI> has acquir'd sufficient Vigour and Balm in
his Blood and Juices, to secern a proper soft
Fluid with a fine volatil Salt, to transmit them
into the <HI>Vesiculae Seminales,</HI> and thence to their
<HI>second Stage</HI> of Existence, the <HI>Female.</HI> Their
Multitude is only to secure against the possible
Chances of some one or more not getting
through the <HI>Uterus</HI> by the <HI>Tubi Fallopiani</HI> into
the duly prepared <HI>Ovum,</HI> there endow'd with a
convenient <HI>Nidus</HI> and <HI>specific</HI> Nutriture, to
increase them gradually to their due Magni∣tude
and Strength, so as to be able to bear
their proper <HI>Element. Equivocal Genera∣tion,</HI>
by many repeated Experiments, has been
proved <HI>false</HI> beyond a <HI>Reply;</HI> and the im∣pregnated
<HI>Ovum,</HI> with a <HI>seminal Animalculum</HI>
in it, has been traced through the <HI>Tubi Fal∣lopiani</HI>
from the <HI>Ovarium</HI> to the <HI>Uterus.
<PB N="280" REF="296"/>
Leuvenhoeck,</HI> in numberless <HI>Sperms</HI> of dif∣ferent
<HI>Animals,</HI> (if healthy) has constantly
observ'd by his <HI>Microscopes,</HI> these <HI>Animal∣culi,</HI>
with all the Evidence and Certainty of
the <HI>Senses;</HI> and <HI>Malpighi</HI> has discovered in
<HI>Hen-Eggs,</HI> the daily gradual Progress of the
<HI>Cock-tread,</HI> from its <HI>Punctum Saliens</HI> in the
<HI>big End,</HI> till it broke the <HI>Shell</HI> in a perfect
<HI>Chicken,</HI> and accurately described all its Ap∣pearances;
none of which was to be found
in those which were set a Hatching without
the Concurrence of the <HI>Male.</HI> After so
many and accurat <HI>Experiments</HI> made by
<HI>Naturalists,</HI> there can remain no Difficulties
in this <HI>System,</HI> with those who fully under∣stand
the <HI>infinit Divisibility</HI> of Matter, or
whose <HI>Imagination</HI> is not very gross, vitious,
or limited.</P>
<P>4. IF this <HI>System</HI> be the true one, as I cer∣tainly
think it so in the main, it will be very
evident, that <HI>Luxury, intemperat Lechery,
inflammatory</HI> and <HI>bilious</HI> Blood and Juices,
may destroy and kill these <HI>Animalculi</HI> in their
primitive Cells, or the Heat and Acrimony
of the Fluid, in which they are transmitted,
may burn them up, before they reach their
proper <HI>secondary Station.</HI> With the luxurious
and hot-headed <HI>Males,</HI> this is almost con∣stantly
the Cause of <HI>Infertility,</HI> though the
Blame is commonly laid on the more tem∣perat,
cool and healthy <HI>Females.</HI> It is cer∣tain
<PB N="281" REF="297"/>
from <HI>Philosophy</HI> as well as <HI>Observation,</HI>
that sole Water-drinking Males are very rarely
<HI>infertil.</HI> I remember Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> the <HI>Milk-Doctor</HI>
of <HI>Croyden,</HI> (whose Case I have
narrated in the <HI>English Malady</HI>) pointed out
to me two or three opulent Families in his
Neighbourhood, who after Marriage had con∣tinued
several Years without <HI>Posterity,</HI> and
were extremely solicitous about it; and whom
in two or three Years time, he had brought
to have several <HI>fine Children,</HI> by keeping both
Parents, all that time, to a total <HI>Milk</HI> and
<HI>Seed Diet.</HI> This he most solemnly averr'd to
me, and we know, that even old <HI>Homer</HI> had
observ'd, that the Feeders on Milk were the
<HI>honestest</HI> of Men.</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
<P>5. I OWN in this Case, I am much more
concern'd for the <HI>Female</HI> than the <HI>Male Sex.</HI>
The <HI>Males</HI> having stronger, but coarser, both
Bodies and Faculties, by their Licentiousness
and Luxury, often bring on their own Suffer∣ings,
and bodily Misfortunes; whereas the
<HI>Females</HI> in general, having weaker, but more
delicat and pliable Bodies and Spirits, and
tied down by Custom, and the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of
Men, to many Restraints, (which Men inso∣lently
despise) are more <HI>temperat, abstemious,</HI>
and <HI>modest;</HI> and suffer at least in this Life,
infinitly more in the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Childing</HI>
than Men; not only from the Pains and
<PB N="282" REF="298"/>
Anxieties of <HI>Breeding</HI> and <HI>Child-bearing,</HI> but
from the innumerable Accidents of <HI>Miscar∣riages,</HI>
and being subject to the <HI>Wildnesses</HI>
and <HI>Caprices</HI> of debauched Husbands; by all
which they often ruin their <HI>Constitutions,</HI> and
shorten the <HI>Duration</HI> of their Lives; and, at
best, pass through a much more severe State
of <HI>Purification,</HI> than Men, for the general,
do; and yet, if I were called upon, I could
take my <HI>Oath,</HI> if there be any thing real or
valuable in Virtue, that in the <HI>Compass</HI> of my
Acquaintance, (of the same Degree of Virtue,
or Freedom from Vice) I have known <HI>ten</HI>
good Women, for <HI>one</HI> equally good Man;
though I own an <HI>abandon'd</HI> Woman is ex∣tremely
bad; for <HI>Corruptio optimi est pes∣sima.</HI>
The Design of this <HI>Chapter</HI> is solely to
suggest to that more innocent and delicat
Part of our <HI>Species,</HI> all that comes within the
Compass of my Experience, Observation or
Knowledge, to cure or relieve the several
Disorders or Inconveniencies that attend them
in this <HI>State</HI> of their Lives.</P>
<P>6. IT is a common profane <HI>Joke,</HI> of igno∣rant
and low Wits, upon the <HI>Hysterical,</HI> and
<HI>green biliary Complaints</HI> of the <HI>Sex,</HI> that <HI>Con∣cubinage</HI>
or <HI>Matrimony</HI> would be the best
Remedy for these Disorders: But these kinds
of <HI>Sneerers</HI> understand as little of <HI>Nature,</HI> as
they do of <HI>Religion.</HI> Tender young <HI>Females,</HI>
with <HI>hysterical</HI> and <HI>green biliary</HI> Complaints,
<PB N="283" REF="299"/>
upon <HI>Conception,</HI> during the time of their
<HI>Pregnancy,</HI> may sometimes, at least as they
grow <HI>big,</HI> get better <HI>Appetits</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI>
from the long precedeing Inappetency, fre∣quent
<HI>Reaching,</HI> and from the <HI>Foetus</HI> draw∣ing
off the <HI>Superfluity:</HI> But, alas! this will be
but a short and precarious Reprieve; for after
<HI>Child-bearing,</HI> or, what more generally hap∣pens,
after an <HI>Abortion,</HI> the same <HI>Symptoms</HI>
return with doubled Violence; and when
they begin to <HI>miscarry,</HI> they generally go off
in a <HI>Decay,</HI> a <HI>slow Fever, Fits</HI> and <HI>Convul∣sions;</HI>
whereas, had they forborn <HI>Matrimony</HI>
till they had mended their Constitutions, by
the Rules laid down in the fourth Chapter of
this Part of the Treatise, (being supposed
young) they would have ever been free from
the mentioned Inconveniencies.</P>
<P>7. I HAVE hinted at the chief Source of
<HI>Infertility</HI> in the <HI>Male</HI> Sex, which, besides
Accidents and a <HI>Mal formation,</HI> is chiefly
owing to the <HI>Luxury</HI> of the Individual him∣self,
if he has been born sound, or has not de∣riv'd
corrupted Juices from his <HI>Parents:</HI> In all
which Cases, nothing will restore <HI>Fertility,</HI>
but what mends the Constitution, the <HI>Rules</HI>
for which I have laid down, with great Plain∣ness,
in this <HI>Treatise.</HI> The <HI>Infertility</HI> of the
<HI>Female Sex</HI> is owing to one of these three
<HI>Causes.</HI> 1. A too great <HI>Flux</HI> of the <HI>Men∣strual
Purification,</HI> for which the proper
<PB N="284" REF="300"/>
<HI>Cure</HI> is directed above, under that <HI>Symptom.</HI>
2. From too small a <HI>Flow</HI> of the same, (which,
I think, in a <HI>Medium,</HI> ought to be about two
Ounces) for which also the <HI>Remedy</HI> is sug∣gested
under the Head of <HI>Obstructions:</HI> Or,
3. From a Weakness that happens in the In∣tervals
of the <HI>Menstruations,</HI> called the <HI>Fluor
Albus,</HI> described and prescribed for above
likewise. Frequent <HI>Miscarriages</HI> attend all
these <HI>three</HI> Causes, often at all times, but
most commonly between the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI>
Month, when the Weight of the <HI>Foetus</HI> is too
great for the <HI>contractive</HI> Powers of the
<HI>Uterus,</HI> whereby it is forced away before its
due Time; which is a plain and manifest
Symptom of tender and relaxed <HI>Nerves</HI> and
Solids in the Mother, and which ought to
be a Warning to <HI>both Parents,</HI> to set about
all possible Means to strengthen and brace
the Solids, at least of the Mother, in order
to prevent the future Progress of this <HI>Imbe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ility;</HI>
which Means, the best known to me,
and the most rational and successful I have
observed or read of, I intend now to suggest.</P>
<P>8. WHEN a married young Woman be∣gins
to miscarry naturally, and without any
Accident, she rarely goes on after to the full
Time, but miscarries regularly every three or
four Months, till either she gives over Breed∣ing,
or is cut off by the Frequency of the <HI>Mis∣carriage,</HI>
and its Consequences. In which
<PB N="285" REF="301"/>
Case, were there no other Reason, as soon as
it can be safely done, she ought to be blooded
six or seven Ounces, out of a large Orifice at
the Arm, to examin into the State of the
<HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Viscera,</HI> and if the <HI>Curd</HI> of the
Blood be found sizy or liverish, (as I could
venture my Life it will in such a Case gene∣rally
be) she will never bring a <HI>Child</HI> to its
full Time, whatever the Appearances of
Health in the Mother be otherwise, till the
Blood be thinned and <HI>balmified,</HI> which can
only be done the soonest, by little <HI>Phleboto∣mies,</HI>
(of about two Ounces) every Month
immediately after the <HI>Menstruation;</HI> the mild
<HI>Ponderose, Cinnabar</HI> especially, twice a Day,
about 40 Grains or more for the <HI>Dose,</HI> wash'd
down with Asses Milk or <HI>Orange-whey;</HI> good
Hours, gentle Exercise, a white Meat Diet,
with a little <HI>French</HI> Claret in <HI>Bristol</HI> Water,
Milk-porridge only for Supper, cold Water
<HI>Friction,</HI> and the other Rules formerly given
for <HI>braceing</HI> tender <HI>Nerves,</HI> and mending bad
Juices; which will be sooner effected in the
Young, as these must be. By this Method I
have often cured <HI>Infertility</HI> in the <HI>Sex,</HI> and
prevented <HI>Abortion,</HI> and improved their Con∣stitution,
when the Blood and Constitution
has not been very bad. But upon this Exa∣mination
of the Blood by <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> if the
<HI>Curd</HI> is found to be thin, waterish, and too
soft and spungy; then real <HI>Cold batheing</HI> long
continued, <HI>vegetable</HI> Astringents, the <HI>Bark</HI> espe∣cially,
<PB N="286" REF="302"/>
drinking <HI>Tunbridge</HI> or <HI>Spa</HI> Water in
the proper Season on the <HI>Spot,</HI> will be found
to succeed best.</P>
<P>9. BUT if the Constitution be so weak,
<HI>lax</HI> and <HI>delicat,</HI> that even this Method will
not carry them on to their full Time; then
nothing is so likely to do as <HI>sole</HI> Water-drink∣ing:
Common Water, with a little Milk, and
tepid <HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Bristol,</HI> and animal Food, the
youngest and lightest, and at Noon only, and
Milk Meats (<HI>Ass's</HI> or <HI>Cow's</HI>) for Breakfast and
Supper, during the whole Time of their
<HI>Pregnancy. Wine</HI> and all fermented Liquors,
give too great a Velocity to the Blood, push
it onwards with too strong a <HI>Momentum,</HI>
force open the <HI>uterin</HI> Vessels, and drive off
the <HI>Placenta</HI> from the <HI>Fund</HI> of the <HI>Uterus,</HI>
by opening the <HI>Sphincters</HI> of the <HI>menstrual</HI>
Flux; so that the <HI>Foetus</HI> must necessarily come
off, which is never to be retain'd by <HI>Art</HI> or
<HI>astringent</HI> Medicin, after the parturient Wo∣man
finds a Tendency in her Bowels to part
with it. All that can be done then, is by gentle
<HI>Forcers</HI> or <HI>Volatils,</HI> together with soft <HI>Oils</HI> and
<HI>Balsamics</HI> united to mild <HI>Opiats,</HI> to quiet Na∣ture;
and leaving her to her own <HI>Play,</HI> pati∣ently
wait her Time and Manner; for, to use
<HI>Astringents</HI> in such a Case, is like setting the
Room on fire, and locking the Door.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="303"/>
10. IF this Method should also prove un∣successful
to procure <HI>Fertility,</HI> and prevent
<HI>Abortion</HI> in tender young married Women,
as it often does in those who are tolerably
healthy; a <HI>total Milk</HI> and <HI>Seed Diet,</HI> rigidly
continued for a Year or two, cannot fail;
especially if due Care of the other Non-na∣turals
be added, half a Drachm of the <HI>Bark</HI>
be chew'd and swallow'd in the Morning and
before Supper, or Pills be made of the <HI>Ex∣tract</HI>
to the same Value, and once or twice a
Week ten or fifteen Grains of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> be
taken over Night, during all the time of the
<HI>Pregnancy.</HI> I have seen the finest Children
come, under this <HI>Regimen,</HI> I ever beheld; and
I am fully persuaded, if any thing in Nature
can prevent <HI>Infertility,</HI> and bring fine Chil∣dren,
it is a <HI>Milk and Seed Diet,</HI> continued
both by <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI> till the Effect be
produced. This <HI>Regimen</HI> secures the Health
of the Children, if they come, it being the
same, Nature puts them under as soon as they
see the <HI>Light;</HI> and cures all the Disorders
they may happen to receive from diseas'd Pa∣rents
in their <HI>Formation;</HI> and if it does not
cure the <HI>Infertility</HI> of the Parents, it cer∣tainly
mends their Health and Constitution.</P>
<P>11. BUT if the Desire of <HI>Posterity,</HI> so na∣tural
to young-married Women, should not
prevail with them to enter upon this cool,
soft, wholsome <HI>Regimen,</HI> I mean a <HI>total
<PB N="288" REF="304"/>
Milk and Seed Diet;</HI> yet there is one Argu∣ment
which I think could not fail in that
<HI>Sex,</HI> which is, that I can assure them upon
my <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Veracity,</HI> that it is the only
Method known or knowable to Mankind, to
preserve and improve the <HI>Beauty, Cleanness</HI>
and <HI>Sweetness,</HI> of the <HI>Tender</HI> and <HI>Delicat,</HI> far
beyond <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> which the Mothers of the
<HI>Georgian</HI> Daughters give them, to improve their
<HI>Beauty,</HI> for a long time, before they enter in
the <HI>Seraglio's</HI> of the great Men of <HI>Asia.</HI>
These young Ladies, who are so anxious to
preserve their <HI>Faces, Complexions</HI> and <HI>Shape,</HI>
that they often endanger their <HI>Healths</HI> and
<HI>Lives</HI> on that <HI>Score,</HI> will find this <HI>Regimen</HI>
far beyond the <HI>Paint</HI> and <HI>Spanish Roùge</HI> and
Colouring, (which always at last destroys the De∣licacy
of the Skin, and the natural Beauty) and
yet is so universally practis'd now for that End.
<HI>Scorbutical, Icteric,</HI> and <HI>Biliary</HI> Constitutions,
may for a while look <HI>pale, languid,</HI> and <HI>sallow,</HI>
under such a <HI>Regimen;</HI> but in time all these
mortifying <HI>Symptoms</HI> will evanish, and an ini∣mitable
<HI>Bloom, Blush,</HI> and <HI>Brightness,</HI> will suc∣ceed,
infinitly beyond all the Colouring of
<HI>Art</HI> or <HI>Paint.</HI> There is no Beauty like the
<HI>Bloom</HI> of Nature in perfect Health: Such a
<HI>Regimen</HI> duely continued, heightens the <HI>Scar∣let</HI>
of the Blood, sweetens and thins it, so that it
is able to <HI>circulat</HI> freely through the <HI>transparent
Scarf-Skin</HI> in its least and last <HI>Capillaries</HI> and
<HI>Meanders;</HI> and at the same time <HI>thins,
<PB N="289" REF="305"/>
smooths,</HI> and renders the <HI>Cuticule</HI> so <HI>trans∣parent,</HI>
that the <HI>Vermilion Blush,</HI> and its own
natural and healthy <HI>Whiteness,</HI> becomes per∣spicuous.
This I most certainly know, not
only from Reason and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> but from
repeated <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Experiments,</HI> haveing
recovered, preserved and improved by this
<HI>Regimen</HI> duely continued, the Beauty of some
of the finest Women in <HI>England.</HI> But they
must not be discouraged, if upon short <HI>Trials</HI>
the Effect is not produced, for at first it may
happen quite otherwise: But let them have
but Patience and Perseverance, I will venture
my <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> on the Success at last.
Had <HI>Agrippina,</HI> who every Day bathed herself
in a Tub of <HI>Ass's</HI> Milk, to preserve and in∣crease
the <HI>Smoothness, Softness,</HI> and <HI>Delicacy</HI>
of her Skin, made <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>Cow's Milk</HI> with
<HI>farinaceous</HI> Seeds, her only Food, and with
this had fomented the <HI>Insides</HI> instead of the
<HI>Outsides</HI> of her Vessels, she had accomplished
her Purpose with infinitly greater Efficacy
and Success. But what need of <HI>Arguments</HI>
to prove this Fact, since every one's <HI>Senses</HI>
can witness to the Beauty and Comeliness of
healthy young Children, and <HI>Dairy-Maids,</HI>
who are fed mostly after this manner?</P>
<P>12. IF a married young Lady under a com∣mon
temperat Diet, should find herself apt to
miscarry, besides avoiding as far as she can, all
<HI>Surprizes, Frights,</HI> and shocking <HI>Sights,</HI> all
<PB N="290" REF="306"/>
violent Exercise, and every Excess of any
Kind, it would help her much, if she lost
about two, at most three Ounces of Blood
at the Arm, near about the time she used to be
out of Order, at least for the first three, or
four, or five Months, after she has reason to be∣lieve
she is breeding, which the first missing her
<HI>Ordinary,</HI> ought to certify married young Wo∣men;
by which so safe and small a Loss of
Blood, its Force and <HI>Momentum</HI> downwards
will be abated, and a Miscarriage prevented:
But Care should be had, that this small <HI>Phle∣botomy</HI>
be not carried on after the fifth
Month; for then the Danger of <HI>Miscarriage</HI>
lessens, unless it be by Accidents.</P>
<P>13. YOUNG married Women, on breed∣ing,
generally after missing the first <HI>Return,</HI>
are very apt to turn sickish in a Morning,
<HI>reach,</HI> and throw up waterish <HI>Phlegm</HI> and
<HI>Choler,</HI> especially if they have been plenti∣ful
and free Feeders, which often forces an
<HI>Abortion.</HI> I know no Remedy so effectual
for this, as the <HI>Thumb-Vomit</HI> above described,
which, without Violence, discharges the Sto∣mach
of this superabundant <HI>Phlegm</HI> and
<HI>Choler,</HI> and ought to be daily, and every
Morning, <HI>repeated,</HI> till this <HI>Symptom</HI> ceases:
Half an Hour after, drinking a small Glass of
tepid fresh <HI>Spa-water,</HI> with ten Drops of
<HI>Elixir</HI> of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> and at Night, at least two
or three Days in a Week, taking ten or
<PB N="291" REF="307"/>
twelve Grains of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> wash'd down with
a Glass of the same Water, with a Spoonful of
Claret: These ought to be continued dureing
all the Time of this breeding Sickness.</P>
<P>14. A <HI>TEA</HI> made of <HI>Jesuits-Bark, Misleto,
Orange-peel</HI> and <HI>Cinamon,</HI> on <HI>Bristol-water,</HI>
three, four, or five Spoonfuls of this, taken two
or three times a Day, on an empty Stomach,
is an excellent <HI>Cordial</HI> against the Lowness of
Spirits common to <HI>breeding</HI> Women, and
also an excellent <HI>Antidot</HI> against <HI>Miscarriage;</HI>
or an Ounce of <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> with a
<HI>Drachm</HI> of <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> infus'd in
eighteen Ounces of <HI>French</HI> White-wine,
strain'd and filtred, four Spoonfuls, more or
less, as it operats downwards, is an excellent
Remedy, taken every other Night, both against
the Sickness incident to <HI>breeding</HI> Women, and
also against Abortion, and prevents too ob∣stinat
Costiveness, which is often the Cause
of it.</P>
<P>15. GENTLE <HI>Friction</HI> with a warm <HI>Fla∣nel,</HI>
and after washing the whole Body over
with <HI>tepid</HI> Water, before a good Fire,
the <HI>Rupture-plaister</HI> kept constantly to the
Back, a broad <HI>Girdle</HI> of Cotton applied about
the Middle, good Hours, chearful Company,
and, in a Word, every thing that is proper to
promote Health and good Spirits, ought to
be attended to, by tender and delicat Breeders;
<PB N="292" REF="308"/>
for one <HI>Miscarriage</HI> hurts the Constitution,
and weakens the <HI>Nerves,</HI> more than two full
Births.</P>
<P>16. IT is a <HI>vulgar Error</HI> to confine tender
breeding Women to their <HI>Chambers, Couches,</HI>
or <HI>Beds,</HI> dureing all the Time of their <HI>Preg∣nancy.</HI>
This is one of the readiest ways to
make them <HI>miscarry;</HI> it is like the common
Advice of some unskilful Persons, to such as
have <HI>anasarcous</HI> or <HI>dropsical</HI> Legs, <HI>viz.</HI> to
keep them up in Chairs on a Level with their
Seats, which is the ready way to throw up
the Humours into their Bowels, and fix them
there. The only solid and certain way to
prevent <HI>Miscarriage,</HI> is to pursue all those
<HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Methods</HI> that are the likeliest to
procure or promote good Health, of which
<HI>Air,</HI> and <HI>gentle Exercise,</HI> is one of the prin∣cipal.
All Violence or Excesses of every
kind are to be carefully avoided by the <HI>Par∣turient;</HI>
but fresh <HI>Air,</HI> gentle <HI>Exercise,</HI>
walking, being carried in a <HI>Sedan</HI> or <HI>Chaise,</HI>
on even Ground, is as necessary as <HI>Food</HI> or
<HI>Rest;</HI> and therefore is never to be omitted,
when the Season will permit, by tender
Breeders. If these Rules, judiciously applied,
and strictly followed, will not prevent <HI>Infer∣tility</HI>
and <HI>Abortion,</HI> I fear nothing will.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Rules for obtaining and preserving Health
in the Decline of Life; or for securing a
Green Old Age.</HEAD>
<P>1. AS there are few <HI>Individuals,</HI> who
have not sufficient Reason to con∣clude,
that at about the Age of Forty-five, or
Fifty, they have passed the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life,
and are stepping <HI>down Hill;</HI> the whole Space
of Time (be it more or less) which is allotted
to them between <HI>this</HI> Season of Life and the
Hour of Death, will, by a reasonable think∣ing
Man, be called <HI>Old Age.</HI> It is, as it
were, the <HI>Twilight</HI> of Life, or a <HI>second Child∣hood,</HI>
with this essential Difference however,
from the <HI>first Infancy,</HI> that in <HI>This</HI> the <HI>Fa∣culties</HI>
and their <HI>material Organs</HI> are uncul∣tivated,
unextended, and want their <HI>Per∣fection;</HI>
whereas in this <HI>Second,</HI> the <HI>Facul∣ties</HI>
and the <HI>Senses</HI> likewise may, by a wise
and prudent <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> be supported to the
very last Stage of Life, in <HI>Vigour</HI> propor∣tionat
to their earlier <HI>Cultivation</HI> and Im∣provement;
and hence it is, that I call <HI>Old
Age</HI> the <HI>Twilight</HI> or <HI>Evening</HI> of <HI>Life;</HI> and,
to carry on the <HI>Metaphor,</HI> I further observe,
that if the earlier Years have been spent in
<HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Innocence,</HI> this <HI>Evening,</HI> like
that of a <HI>Summer's</HI> Day, will be calm and
<PB N="294" REF="310"/>
serene, nay sweeter and more delightful than
the precedeing <HI>Day.</HI></P>
<P>2. WERE our Views to be carried no
further than the narrow <HI>Circle</HI> of seventy or
eighty Years, this Calmness, this <HI>Serenity,</HI> so
much to be wished for, would surely invite
every thinking Man, who had his own <HI>Hap∣piness</HI>
in View, to step forward in that <HI>Path</HI>
of Life which Nature itself has evidently
pointed out to him; and if we carry our
<HI>Ideas</HI> beyond this narrow <HI>Circle,</HI> and con∣templat
a <HI>future Existence,</HI> is it not <HI>Mad∣ness</HI>
to deviat from a <HI>Path</HI> which leads to
an happy <HI>Eternity?</HI></P>
<P>3. THE irksome Experience which I have
had of Multitudes of thoughtless unhappy <HI>In∣dividuals,</HI>
who by their Folly and Luxury have
weakened the <HI>primary Powers</HI> of Nature in
their own Constitutions, who without any se∣vere
<HI>Chronical</HI> Distempers or Accidents have, as
it were, wilfully made themselves wretched,
is a sufficient <HI>Call</HI> to me, to point out to my
Fellow-Creatures the best <HI>Rules,</HI> which I am
capable of laying down, for obtaining and
preserving Health in the <HI>Decline</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> a
lively rational <HI>Head</HI> under <HI>Silver Hairs,</HI> and
a vigorous active <HI>Heart</HI> to animat even a
feeble decaying <HI>Trunk.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="311"/>
4. NOW one of the most effectual Me∣thods
which a wise Man can pursue, in order
to obtain the <HI>Blessing</HI> of what I call a <HI>Green
Old Age,</HI> is to begin at least at the Age of
Fifty, to lessen his daily Sustenance of <HI>Meat</HI>
and <HI>Drink,</HI> both in <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Quality,</HI>
but especially in the <HI>first.</HI> I have, in my
<HI>Essay</HI> on <HI>Regimen,</HI> demonstrated that about
this Time the great <HI>Crise</HI> or <HI>Climacteric</HI> of
Life generally happens in both <HI>Sexes.</HI> Then
it is, that the Blood and the Juices of the
most Healthy and Strong begin to <HI>cool,</HI> to
<HI>thicken,</HI> to become <HI>vapid,</HI> and to be <HI>ob∣structed</HI>
in the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Lymphatics;</HI>
many of which Vessels, by such <HI>Obstructions,</HI>
coalesce and become <HI>cartilaginous,</HI> the
<HI>Perspiration</HI> is lessened, all the several <HI>Se∣cretions</HI>
are rendered less <HI>perfect,</HI> all the
<HI>Solids</HI> grow stiff and hard, and lose their
<HI>Elasticity,</HI> and the <HI>Circulation</HI> is gradually
reduced into a narrower Compass, approach∣ing
still nearer and nearer to the <HI>Trunks</HI> of
the Blood-vessels, or their first Branches.</P>
<P>5. AT this Time it is, that an observant
<HI>wise Man</HI> will discover, that his <HI>Vigour</HI> is
past the <HI>Meridian,</HI> and begins to <HI>decline;</HI> and
this Discovery will <HI>dictate</HI> to him a Necessity
of takeing such Measures, as may render the
<HI>Progress</HI> of <HI>Old Age</HI> as <HI>slow</HI> as his Nature
will admit of; and such as may contribute
<PB N="296" REF="312"/>
to the Continuance of his Ease and Happi∣ness,
and the Preservation of his <HI>Senses,</HI> and
his <HI>Faculties,</HI> in all the Perfection that can rea∣sonably
be hoped for.</P>
<P>6. NOW I am persuaded, this desireable
<HI>End</HI> cannot, by human Means, be attained,
without a gradual Diminution of his <HI>Meat</HI>
and <HI>Drink,</HI> and this both in <HI>Quantity</HI> and
<HI>Quality,</HI> especially in the <HI>First;</HI> and this is a
Rule which must be practised by the Man
who is turned of Fifty, and is desirous of
living to Seventy or Eighty. It must be
strictly and uniformly pursued, and he must
resolve to be deaf to the <HI>Calls</HI> of craving Ap∣petites,
which, at this Time in Life, are usu∣ally
so depraved by <HI>Prejudice, Example,</HI> and
<HI>Excess,</HI> that their Judgment is <HI>false,</HI> and
their Dictates <HI>destructive,</HI> when they point
out the <HI>Quality,</HI> or direct the <HI>Quantity,</HI> of
his Food.</P>
<P>7. <HI>CORNARO,</HI> who was possibly a
single Instance, amongst Men of Rank and
<HI>Affluence,</HI> of a long Life, high Health and
Spirits to the <HI>last,</HI> secured these valuable Bles∣sings
by the mere Force of <HI>Regimen,</HI> even
after a luxurious, and consequently an un∣healthy
and dispirited <HI>Youth.</HI> At Forty, he
began to curb his Appetites, and to manage
his <HI>Diet,</HI> which, after several <HI>Essays,</HI> he fixed
at twelve Ounces of solid <HI>Food,</HI> and fourteen
<PB N="297" REF="313"/>
of <HI>Wine,</HI> in twenty-four Hours; from this
Time, (<HI>viz.</HI> the Age of Forty) gradually
lessening his <HI>Diet,</HI> till he reduced it to the
Yolk of an Egg (<HI>i. e.</HI> about an Ounce of
solid Food in twenty-four Hours, and proba∣bly
did the same by his <HI>Wine</HI>). He enjoyed a
perfect State of Health, and was at the same
time happy in <HI>high Spirits</HI> to the Age of
an Hundred, or, as some Authors say, an
Hundred and Twenty: A very extraordinary
Instance this, in a Man of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <HI>Rank</HI> in
<HI>Life,</HI> who had in his Youth indulged in <HI>high</HI>
Food, and <HI>rich</HI> Wine. Now it is highly pro∣bable,
that from the Time of the first Re∣duction
of his Food so, at the Age of Forty,
he must gradually have lessened the daily
<HI>Quantity,</HI> about two Ounces every ten Years,
till he had at Length reduced it to an Ounce
a Day. The happy Result of this gradual
<HI>Reduction</HI> shews, that he must naturally have
had very strong Solids: For I am quite per∣suaded,
that if instead of this <HI>stinted</HI> Quan∣tity
of <HI>animal</HI> Food, he had, at the Age of
Forty, confined himself to Cow's Milk and
Bread, to Vegetables and Water only, he
might probably have lived to a much greater
Age, with a clearer <HI>Head,</HI> and higher <HI>Spirits;</HI>
for the sovereign Method of prolonging Life
is to preserve the Blood in a <HI>thin, sweet</HI> and
<HI>balmy</HI> State, by which only the <HI>Circulation</HI>
can be kept sufficiently extensive and full,
through the various <HI>Meanders</HI> of the <HI>Capil∣laries,</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="314"/>
and all their delicat <HI>Circumvolutions</HI> in
the <HI>Glands:</HI> For natural <HI>Death</HI> by reason of
Age only, is the necessary Result of thicken∣ing
the Blood, which gradually lessens the Ex∣tent
of, and finally stops, the <HI>Circulation,</HI> even
in the Trunks of the Vessels.</P>
<P>8. IT is now about sixteen Years since, for
the last time, I entered upon a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>ve∣getable
Diet.</HI> At the Beginning of this Pe∣riod,
this light Food I took as my Appetite
directed, without any Measure, and found my∣self
easy under it: After some time, I found it
became necessary to lessen the <HI>Quantity,</HI> and
I have laterly reduced it to One half at most,
of what I at first seemed to bear; and if
it shall please GOD to spare me a few Years
longer, in order to preserve in that Case, that
<HI>Freedom</HI> and <HI>Clearness</HI> which by his <HI>Blessing</HI>
I now enjoy, I shall probably find myself
obliged to deny myself <HI>One half</HI> of my pre∣sent
daily Sustenance, which precisely is <HI>three
Winchester Pints</HI> of new Cow's Milk, and <HI>six
Ounces of Biscuit</HI> made of fine Flour without
<HI>Salt</HI> or <HI>Yest,</HI> and baked in a quick <HI>Oven.</HI></P>
<P>9. MODERAT <HI>Phlebotomies</HI> to such as
can bear them without Fainting or great
Lowness, especially such as have ever by a
common temperat Diet preserved a robust
<HI>Constitution,</HI> will greatly assist in procuring a
<HI>Green Old Age;</HI> for Death (as I have already
<PB N="299" REF="315"/>
observed) overtakes the temperat Man <HI>lento
pede,</HI> by slow and gradual Advances, by
thickening from time to time the Juices, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Curd</HI> and <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood, and there∣by
obstructing first the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Lym∣phatics,</HI>
and then the first Branches, and
lastly the <HI>Trunk</HI> Vessels themselves. Now
moderat and frequent Loss of Blood keeps
the Vessels always <HI>roomy,</HI> and draws off more
of the thick and viscid Juices, and in a greater
Proportion than of the fluid and good Blood,
as I have before shewn.</P>
<P>10. IF <HI>proper,</HI> light, and wholsome Food,
such as is easily digested, be taken in the smallest
Quantities that can prevent the <HI>Anxiety</HI> of
Hunger, the kindly Chyle from thence drawn
will keep the whole Mass of Blood cool,
thin, and sweet, longer and better than any
other Method of <HI>Diet,</HI> which, in my Judg∣ment,
Art can suggest. Now in order to
render this <HI>Regimen</HI> easy and familiar to the
Patient, he should enter upon it at the Age
of Fifty, at least before he is Sixty, that the
Change from higher Feeding may not be
attended with Fainting, or too great Low∣ness.
I have at this time a Patient upwards
of Eighty, in perfect Health and Serenity,
who yet has ever been of a delicat and tender
Constitution, whose present easy and happy
State seems to be the Consequence of draw∣ing
seven or eight Ounces of Blood about
<PB N="300" REF="316"/>
once in two or three Months; and. in Fact,
I have found, that frequent moderat <HI>Phlebo∣tomies,</HI>
(for Instance, once every Quarter of
a Year, or at least in the Spring and at Au∣tumn)
when they can be borne without Faint∣ings
or subsequent Lowness of Spirits, will
greatly contribute to the Preservation of Life,
and afford a reasonable Prospect of a <HI>green</HI>
and <HI>serene Old Age.</HI></P>
<P>11. ANOTHER Method of procureing
these <HI>Blessings</HI> is to promote and encourage
<HI>Perspiration.</HI> Now in old Men, from the
Weakness and Slowness of Digestion, by a
Contraction of the <HI>Chanels</HI> for Circulation,
(many of the smaller Vessels becoming solid)
and by a consequential <HI>Laxity</HI> of all the <HI>mo∣tive</HI>
Powers, the <HI>Perspiration</HI> gradually de∣creases,
the Skin grows dry and stiff, the <HI>per∣spiratory</HI>
Ducts are closed; and hence come
<HI>Wrinkles</HI> in the <HI>Skin,</HI> and <HI>Paleness</HI> in the
Face. Now the Encouragement of <HI>Perspira∣tion</HI>
in every safe and proper Way, is the
most likely Method of preventing (or at least
of retarding) these Effects of <HI>Age;</HI> and this
may be done by frequent and powerful <HI>Fric∣tion</HI>
over the Body, the Limbs, and <HI>Spine,</HI>
(especially in the Morning and at Night)
with a <HI>Flesh-brush,</HI> a <HI>rough dry Towel,</HI> or a
Piece of warm <HI>Flanel,</HI> afterwards washing,
in the warm Seasons, with a Towel wet in
cold Water, and in the colder Seasons, in
<PB N="301" REF="317"/>
<HI>warm</HI> Water. Let this be done before a clear
Fire, and let the Patient after such Opera∣tion
put on a <HI>Cotton</HI> Waistcoat next to his
Skin. But nothing will so effectually prevent
this, as a total Milk and Seed Diet.</P>
<P>12. As to Medicins, the best known to
me, as conducive towards a <HI>green Old Age,</HI>
are these, <HI>viz.</HI> In cold Nights, half a Pint of
warm small Sack-whey, with forty or fifty
Drops of <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Hartshorn,</HI> taken at going
to Bed—a <HI>Pill,</HI> two or three, of true <HI>Assa
foetida</HI> taken early in a Morning, the Effect
of which is to be felt the ensuing Night—
in want of due Rest, <HI>these,</HI> or a Drachm of <HI>Mi∣thridate,</HI>
or half a Drachm, or forty Grains of
old <HI>Venice Treacle,</HI> or Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI>'s Cor∣dial,
wash'd down with warm Sack-whey.</P>
<P>13. IT will be highly beneficial to use all
such bodily Exercise as a Man in Years can
with Safety bear; an Horse, whilst his Strength
is equal to it; afterwards a <HI>Chaise</HI> or <HI>Chariot,</HI>
in good Weather, or in bad let him walk an
Hour in the Morning, the same in the Even∣ing
before Sun-set, and let his Walk be taken
in a <HI>sheltered</HI> Place. Those who are unequal
to these Exercises, may, however, use the
<HI>Tremoussoir,</HI> (or Chamber-Horse) a <HI>dumb
Bell,</HI> or an <HI>Hammock:</HI> For Exercise, in some
Shape or other, must be had; and this may
be adapted to the Time of Life, and the dif∣ferent
Stages of a natural and necessary <HI>Decay.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="318"/>
14. To promote the great Point in View,
a <HI>chearful healthy Old Age,</HI> nothing, in my
Judgment, can more effectually conduce,
than a serious Attention to the gradual Ad∣vancement
of these <HI>Stages</HI> in Life, and a pro∣portionat
Regulation of Diet; and hence will
it be highly adviseable to drop, by Degrees,
<HI>solid</HI> Food, and to slide into <HI>Liquids</HI> only.
The stronger animal Food may, at first, be suc∣ceeded
by weaker, such as <HI>Chicken</HI> and <HI>Veal.</HI>
These, in Process of Time, must give way to
thin <HI>Broths</HI> made of <HI>Vipers,</HI> with <HI>Veal</HI> or
<HI>Chicken;</HI> which must at length be laid aside
for <HI>vegetable Soups,</HI> (made with little Butter)
and finally, half a Pint of <HI>Ass's Milk</HI> for
<HI>Breakfast,</HI> the same for <HI>Supper,</HI> and a Quart
of sweet <HI>Cow's Milk</HI> for Dinner, will, upon
Experience, be found to be a Diet calculated to
prolong Life, keep the <HI>Head</HI> clear, the <HI>Spirits</HI>
free, the Perspiration tolerably <HI>full,</HI> and Cir∣culation
pretty extensive: And if this very
abstemious <HI>Regimen</HI> is not strictly pursued,
and craving Appetites must have some Indul∣gence;
in such Case, the <HI>lightest</HI> and the
<HI>least</HI> Food, which can prevent the Uneasiness
of <HI>Hunger,</HI> will be found to be a <HI>rational</HI>
and almost certain Method of procureing un∣interrupted
Health, and a <HI>green Old Age.</HI></P>
<P>15. ANOTHER easy and efficacious Mean
of obtaining these Blessings, is to go to Bed,
<PB N="303" REF="319"/>
and to rise from it, early; the first by Eight
or Nine o'Clock in the Evening, the latter
by Six in the Morning, during the Summer
Season, and at Seven in the Winter; and the
Prudence of such Practice will appear, when
it is considered, that at Night the Air is gene∣rally
damp, heavy, full of <HI>nitrous, arsenic</HI> and
noxious mineral Particles, which being <HI>speci∣fically</HI>
heavier than its other constituent Parts,
gravitat and descend the soonest towards the
Surface of the <HI>Earth,</HI> that is, in the first Hours
of the Night; and from <HI>these,</HI> an early warm Bed
is the best Defence: Now before the <HI>Dawn</HI> of
Day, all this hurtful Matter is discharged and
drops, and in the Place thereof the Air is im∣pregnated
with <HI>balsamic</HI> and fragrant Particles
drawn from the lightest and sweetest Vege∣tables;
and <HI>these,</HI> early-rising Persons, of a
tender and delicat Frame, should strive to
enjoy, whilst they are hovering, as it were,
in the lower <HI>Regions,</HI> and before the Force
of the <HI>Sun</HI> has carried them out of their
Reach. Another beneficial Result of early
Rising is, that it affords Time sufficient for the
bodily Exercises above suggested.</P>
<P>16. IT will be found necessary for a Man
in Years, to endeavour to keep his Belly
<HI>firm,</HI> and its Dejections <HI>solid</HI> and <HI>formed,</HI> as
a proper Means of preserving a due Tight∣ness
in the whole <HI>System</HI> of the <HI>Solids</HI> and
the <HI>Nerves;</HI> and this can only be uniformly
<PB N="304" REF="320"/>
effected by very moderat Meals on the
lightest Food. Slipping Bowels in <HI>Old Age</HI>
will destroy the Firmness of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and
Freedom of the Spirits, and soon bring on
Lowness and Sinking, peculiarly hurtful to
<HI>Old Age.</HI> This the wise <HI>Hippocrates</HI> well
knew, when he warmly recommended to
Men in Years a Firmness in the Bowels,
which I would advise as a very essential Step
towards an healthy <HI>Old Age.</HI> Now when an
old Man, by endeavouring to preserve this
Firmness, finds that he becomes too <HI>costive,</HI>
and that his Head is thereby <HI>clouded,</HI> or his
Belly <HI>tumefied,</HI> (the usual Consequence of Over∣feeding
only) a small Quantity of <HI>Hiera
Picra,</HI> or <HI>Tincture of Rhubarb,</HI> one or two
<HI>Ruffi</HI> Pills, or <HI>Anderson</HI>'s Pills, taken over
Night, will easily remove such Uneasiness:
And be it remembered, that all the <HI>Openers</HI>
taken by <HI>old Men</HI> should be of the warmer
and more <HI>carminative</HI> Sort, because the <HI>cooler,</HI>
more <HI>drastic,</HI> and quicker Purgers, are <HI>flatu∣lent</HI>
and <HI>dispiriting,</HI> and after the Use of such,
the Bowels are apt to continue for a consi∣derable
time in a loose, <HI>flabby</HI> State, a Con∣sequence
to be especially avoided by Men in
Years; whereas the warmer and more <HI>carmi∣native</HI>
Openers leave the Belly tight and firm,
the moderat Use of such neither hurts the
Appetite, nor sinks the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the Fre∣quency
of such Assistance will be found highly
beneficial in the <HI>Decline</HI> of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="321"/>
17. ONE of the most irksome Conse∣quences
of old Age, is <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Flatulence,</HI>
so pent up in the Bowels, that by reason of
a weak <HI>Digestion,</HI> and obstructed <HI>Perspiration,</HI>
the Patient has not Force to throw it off.
The most solid Cure of this Symptom is the
<HI>lightest</HI> Food, and the <HI>least</HI> in Quantity, which
can secure him from the <HI>Anxiety</HI> of Hunger.
Milk and Seeds have less of this Kind of
<HI>Wind,</HI> than any other <HI>Eatables,</HI> and that
which they have is of a gentler and sweeter
Sort. I cannot say, that in these Oppressions
by <HI>Wind,</HI> I ever observed, any great Relief was
to be had by the use of <HI>Aromatics</HI> and <HI>Spices,</HI>
unless an <HI>Aloetic</HI> Opener was joined with
them: They only attenuat, and do not expel
Wind.</P>
<P>18. IN great <HI>Flatulence,</HI> and frequent
<HI>Eructations,</HI> nothing affords so quick and
effectual a Relief as <HI>Ipecacuana,</HI> or <HI>Thumb-Vomits,</HI>
as the Patient can bear them, and as
the <HI>Exacerbations</HI> indicat, to pump up the
<HI>Wind,</HI> and force it upwards or downwards, or
through the <HI>perspiratory</HI> Pores. After such
Operations, a Glass of generous <HI>spiced Wine,</HI>
and at going to Rest, or a small Quantity of
<HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> will have a good Effect; and after∣wards
chewing half a Drachm of <HI>Bark</HI> on an
empty Stomach twice a Day, which will give

19. ANOTHER Mean conducive to an
healthy <HI>Old Age,</HI> is to keep the <HI>Feet</HI> and
<HI>Hands</HI> especially, as warm as possible, by
<HI>woollen Socks,</HI> and <HI>furred Gloves.</HI> These Parts
being furthest from the <HI>Heart,</HI> the Source and
motive Power of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> for this
Cause an <HI>old Man</HI> should never go to Bed
with <HI>cold Feet;</HI> and if they are <HI>chilly,</HI> let him
first warm them well before a clear Fire, or
<HI>bathe</HI> them in warm Water, otherwise will
his Sleep be short and interrupted; and in
cold and frosty Nights, let his Bed be well
warmed with a Pan of clear Coals, sprinkled
with some <HI>aromatic Seeds</HI> or <HI>Gums;</HI> at such
times a Bag of <HI>warm Sand,</HI> or an <HI>hot Iron,</HI>
in a thick woden Case, placed at the Feet
of his Bed, and a Fire burning all Night in
his Bed-chamber, will, each of them, con∣tribute
to his Health and Comfort.</P>
<P>20. HIS Bed-Chamber should be of a
<HI>Southern</HI> Exposure; if possible, let it be well
<HI>ventilated</HI> in the warmer Part of the Day,
by opening the Windows; and let it be kept
perfectly <HI>sweet</HI> and clean, and this rather by
constantly <HI>rubbing,</HI> than by <HI>washing.</HI></P>
<P>21. A MAN in Years should not choose
his <HI>Habitation</HI> in a large and <HI>populous</HI> City,
but rather in a <HI>clear, dry,</HI> and <HI>sandy</HI> Country,
<PB N="307" REF="323"/>
and his House should be of a moderat <HI>Ele∣vation.</HI></P>
<P>22. LET his <HI>Cloathing</HI> be such as may
keep his whole Body in a State of due Warmth,
and yet such as is consistent with Ease and
Activity; and therefore the properest Cloaths
are those which are <HI>light</HI> as well as <HI>warm.</HI>
Let his <HI>Winter</HI> Habit be put on <HI>early</HI> in the
<HI>Autumn,</HI> and not laid aside till late in the
<HI>Spring:</HI> Let him guard against <HI>North-east∣erly</HI>
Winds, and <HI>foggy Frosts:</HI> Let his <HI>Fuel</HI> be
Wood, if possible; if not, <HI>Coals</HI> which are
the least <HI>sulphurous,</HI> most <HI>pitchy</HI> and <HI>resinous:</HI>
Lastly, let him avoid <HI>smoaky</HI> Rooms, and <HI>foul</HI>
Chimneys.</P>
<P>23. <HI>AETHIOPS Mineral,</HI> and <HI>Jesuits
Bark,</HI> seem to be, and are Medicins excellently
calculated for the Preservation of Life and
Health; the <HI>first</HI> for those who are originally
robust, and who persevere in the common Use
of Meat and Wine, in Quantities fitted, though,
to their Time of Life; these may, be proper
Doses of <HI>Aethiops Mineral,</HI> be kept mode∣ratly
open, and their Blood preserved in a
State of <HI>Sweetness</HI> and <HI>Fluidity.</HI> The <HI>latter</HI>
of these Medicins, the <HI>Quinquina,</HI> chewed
(about half a Drachm in Quantity) on an
empty Stomach, and swallowed, its <HI>Extract</HI>
in Pills, or the gross Substance in <HI>Wine</HI> or
<HI>Tea,</HI> will brace and strengthen the <HI>Solids</HI> and
<PB N="308" REF="324"/>
<HI>Nerves;</HI> a <HI>Regimen</HI> which should commence
at the first Approach of Old Age, and be con∣tinued
constantly, at least <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall,</HI>
to the very last <HI>Stage</HI> of Life. To the Tender,
Delicat, and such as are unhappy in weak and
<HI>lax Nerves,</HI> the <HI>Bark</HI> is the best and safest
of all the vegetable <HI>Restringents</HI> and <HI>Bracers;</HI>
all its Qualities are probably not yet disco∣vered.
When it is properly chosen, thin and
quite fresh, rightly prepared, and duely dosed,
I take it to be not only the best <HI>Febrifuge</HI> in
all <HI>Intermittents</HI> and <HI>Remittents,</HI> but likewise
the best <HI>Antihectic,</HI> the best <HI>Styptic,</HI> a Stop∣per
of <HI>Mortifications,</HI> with a Regimen, <HI>Ana∣sarca's</HI>
and even <HI>Ascites's,</HI> especially if mixed
with <HI>Salt of Steel.</HI> I take it likewise to be
an excellent Medicin in <HI>Lowness of Spirits,</HI>
and most <HI>nervous</HI> Disorders; and hence it is,
I cannot too earnesty recommend its Use to
the tender, delicat, and <HI>nervous</HI> old Man, in
order to procure him the Blessing of a <HI>Green
Old Age,</HI> as far as <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Medicin</HI> can con∣tribute
to it. <HI>Misleto</HI> of the <HI>Oak,</HI> dried
<HI>Orange-peel, Cinamon, Japan</HI> Earth, (and
some other vegetable <HI>Astringents</HI>) are found
to have something in them of the Nature of
the <HI>Bark,</HI> but in Virtue and Efficacy are
greatly inferior to it.</P>
<P>24. LASTLY, The <HI>Reader</HI> must excuse
me, whilst I speak my Persuasion, that nothing
will more effectually contribute towards the
<PB N="309" REF="325"/>
Felicity of a <HI>Green Old Age,</HI> than innocent
and entertaining <HI>Amusements,</HI> engageing and
light Studies, and rational <HI>Diversions</HI> in a
chearful and affectionat Society; above all, a
<HI>clear Conscience, beneficent Temper, peaceful
Resignation,</HI> and well-grounded <HI>Hope,</HI> which
<Q>Summum nec metuat diem, nec optet.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH many of the Directions given
in this <HI>Chapter</HI> are adapted to Men of <HI>Fortune</HI>
only, yet those who are not such, may possi∣bly
herein discover some <HI>Rules</HI> of Liveing
advantageous in themselves, and at the same
time practicable without Expence. Let the
Man who is really poor, take care to avoid
the Inconveniencies of the Non-naturals; and
his very <HI>Poverty,</HI> by confining him to a low,
thin <HI>Diet,</HI> may probably procure for him the
Blessing of long Life, and a <HI>Green Old Age.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude; I cannot but hope, that
Persons of <HI>all Ranks</HI> and Conditions may,
by a serious Attention to these <HI>Rules,</HI> make
some Discoveries, which may assist in con∣veying
them, without violent <HI>Shocks,</HI> through
a State of <HI>Misery</HI> and <HI>Probation.</HI></P>
<P>25. I HAVE above observed, that to pro∣long
a <HI>Green Old Age,</HI> nothing was more
conducive than the Firmness of the Bowels,
and a due natural Costiveness, at least of
<HI>figur'd Stools;</HI> but since a <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> may hap∣pen
<PB N="310" REF="326"/>
from casual <HI>Excesses, Colds,</HI> or <HI>Epidemical</HI>
Distempers, to such, which not only carries
off the <HI>Nourishment</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> but, if con∣tinued,
will endanger the Life of an <HI>old Man,</HI>
I have therefore reserved the Cure of it to
this Place.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>A DIARRHOEA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A DIARRHOEA,</HI> Flux, or <HI>Chronical</HI>
Looseness, if it is simple, and not <HI>Sympto∣matic,</HI>
arises from an imperfect <HI>Digestion,</HI> or
a bad <HI>Chylification;</HI> the <HI>last</HI> from <HI>viscid</HI>
Juices, so stuffing the <HI>Blood-vessels,</HI> that they
will admit little or no new <HI>Chyle;</HI> the <HI>first</HI>
from a <HI>Relaxation</HI> of the Solids, whereby
the <HI>Chyle</HI> not being sufficiently <HI>thinn'd</HI> or
<HI>mill'd,</HI> cannot pass the <HI>Lacteals;</HI> and so stag∣nating
in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> there acidulats, and
turns into the Nature of an <HI>active Purge.</HI>
This is the Case with a simple and primary
<HI>Diarrhoea;</HI> the <HI>Symptomatic</HI> may arise from
many Causes, a slow <HI>Fever,</HI> a <HI>scorbutic</HI> Habit,
any <HI>topical</HI> Distemper translated, as the <HI>Gout,
Rheumatism,</HI> or <HI>Erisypelas.</HI> This last kind
of <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> can never be totally cured, till
the primary and original Distemper be first
remedied, and so it becomes a simple uncom∣plicated
<HI>one;</HI> just as an <HI>Ulcer</HI> can never be
cured, till by proper <HI>Alteratives</HI> it be made
a simple <HI>Wound.</HI> For the <HI>Cure</HI> of a simple
<HI>Diarrhoea</HI> then, nothing is so effectual as fre∣quent
<HI>Vomits,</HI> both to cleanse the <HI>Primae
Viae,</HI> that the digestive <HI>Organs</HI> may have their
<PB N="311" REF="327"/>
proper Play, as also to withdraw and <HI>revulse</HI>
the <HI>peccant</HI> Humours from the <HI>relax'd Bowels,</HI>
and to cleanse them, Powders of toasted <HI>Rhu∣barb,</HI>
prepared <HI>Coral,</HI> with a few Grains of
toasted <HI>Nutmeg,</HI> in small <HI>Doses,</HI> wash'd down
with tepid <HI>Bristol-water,</HI> or the white Drink,
Teas of <HI>Bark, Cinamon, Misleto,</HI> and <HI>Orange-peel,</HI>
four Spoonfuls twice a Day, on an empty
Stomach; but above all takeing special Care
of the <HI>Diet,</HI> which ought to be the <HI>lightest,</HI>
and most easily digestible, <HI>Rice, Sago, Biskets,</HI>
and the several sorts of <HI>Seed-meats,</HI> made
with Milk or Water, little at a time, but
oftener: All kinds of Exercises the Patient
can bear, and first <HI>Bristol,</HI> then <HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyr∣mont</HI>
Water for Beverage, with a little <HI>spiced
Claret.</HI> This Method will do, if any thing
can, if the Constitution be tolerably <HI>good,</HI>
even though <HI>tender.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be very justly and reasonably supposed,
that all, especially duely cultivated or sen∣sible
<HI>Patients,</HI> already know and are convinced
(at least in the main) of the <HI>general Truths</HI>
here laid down, about the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Distempers.</HI>
Scarce an <HI>Apothecary's Apprentice,</HI> but can
tell, that proper <HI>Evacuations, mild Altera∣tives,</HI>
and <HI>gentle Bracers,</HI> orderly pursued,
and duely continued, are the most effectual
Means and Medicins to cure the <HI>Diseases</HI> of
the Body, and the <HI>Anxieties</HI> of the Mind,
that are the Consequences of such bodily
Diseases; and no considering Patient, but is
convinced, that if he could but moderat his
<HI>Appetites,</HI> and stick to the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the
<HI>Least</HI> he is tolerably easy under, he would in
time get rid of his <HI>Diseases</HI> and <HI>Complaints;</HI>
that is, at least, he could thereby starve them
away in time; so that what I have so strenu∣ously
and perpetually inculcated about <HI>Abs∣tinence,</HI>
Fasting, or the <HI>Lightest</HI> and the
<HI>Least,</HI> is all <HI>Labour in Vain,</HI> and mere <HI>jejune
Repetition.</HI> The <HI>sole Question</HI> in <HI>Physic,</HI> it
seems, and which alone ought to be the Sub∣ject
of a sensible <HI>Physician's</HI> Study and <HI>In∣quiry,</HI>
is, How, takeing Mankind and the
World as they actually are, with their present
<HI>Ignorance, Appetites, Passions, Luxury</HI> and
<HI>Intemperance,</HI> which they will not forego,
<PB N="313" REF="329"/>
even under the Terrors of eternal Punish∣ments,
it is possible to cure or relieve them
of their <HI>Diseases</HI> and <HI>Complaints,</HI> the soonest
and most effectually. Some from their <HI>Situ∣ation</HI>
in Life, their <HI>Employments</HI> and other
Circumstances, may find the <HI>Rules</HI> I have laid
down for the so tedious Recovery of Health,
extremely inconvenient and difficult to pra∣ctise.
Others from the <HI>Violence</HI> and the pain∣ful
<HI>Craveings</HI> of their Appetites, Passions, Ha∣bits,
and the Customs of the Country, will
be extremely averse to cure their Complaints
in the <HI>Manner</HI> I propose. To both such I
might just as well have said nothing at all, as
to have recommended so impracticable and
disagreeable a Manner of <HI>Cure.</HI> To these,
all I have to answer, is, 1<HI>st,</HI> I have suggested
the most effectual and quickest <HI>Remedies</HI> and
<HI>Medicins</HI> to me known, and chosen after the
<HI>experimental Refusal</HI> of a Thousand others,
said to be of the same Intention, under the
present common <HI>Regimen,</HI> and fashionable
Manner of practiseing Physic; and so have
answered the <HI>first</HI> Condition; but without
promiseing a <HI>solid</HI> and dureable <HI>Cure</HI> in such
Circumstances. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That taking in all the
<HI>Conditions</HI> proposed, they make it an impos∣sible
<HI>Problem;</HI> and with as much Reason
they might require the <HI>Quadrature</HI> of the
<HI>Circle</HI> in <HI>integral Numbers,</HI> or a <HI>perpetual
Motion. Health</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> are incompa∣tible:
Strong Fibres and Nerves, and <HI>immo∣derat
<PB N="314" REF="330"/>
Lechery,</HI> are <HI>contradictory.</HI> Long Life
and continued <HI>Intemperance,</HI> in the Nature
of Things, are impossible. <HI>Physicians</HI> under
such Conditions, by strong and repeated <HI>Eva∣cuations,</HI>
and violent <HI>Astringents</HI> and <HI>Bracers</HI>
alternatly prescribed, may keep up the <HI>Pa∣tient</HI>
for a while, but that even poorly and
precariously; and at the same time, and by
these very Means, they precipitat the <HI>Pa∣tient's
Fate.</HI> The Proposition I laid down
to myself to prove, was, That Men, in a
great measure, had the <HI>total Cure,</HI> at least a
great Degree of the <HI>Alleviation</HI> of their Mi∣series,
in their own Power; all, but that one
of <HI>Hunger</HI> perhaps, or <HI>Simplicity</HI> of Diet,
which cannot come to any very painful <HI>Ex∣treme</HI>
in this Island. To <HI>bear</HI> and <HI>forbear,</HI> is
all that is absolutely necessary in this <HI>Life,</HI> to
make a Man tolerably easy; and his Pain and
Suffering cannot have risen to any <HI>great
Height,</HI> who will not submit to this. I have
labour'd to shew in this <HI>Treatise,</HI> by going
through most of the common Distempers,
<HI>Acute</HI> and <HI>Chronical, Epidemical</HI> and <HI>Ce∣phalic,</HI>
the <HI>Evacuations, Alteratives,</HI> and
<HI>Bracers,</HI> proper to alleviat them, without any
Consideration of a particular <HI>Regimen;</HI> and
to extirpat them, have added the <HI>specific Re∣gimen.</HI>
If this will not give Content, we
must conclude from this Appearance, as it
necessarily follows from many others, that
<HI>Pains, Suffering,</HI> and <HI>Diseases,</HI> are necessary
<PB N="315" REF="331"/>
in the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> to make Men
virtuous, in order to become afterwards
happy; and that <HI>Omnipotence</HI> and <HI>Omnisci∣ence</HI>
has chosen this <HI>Mean,</HI> as the most effe∣ctual
to bring them to this State at last. So
that all Endeavours, however <HI>reasonable,</HI> to
steer any other Course, will be vain, till the
<HI>Sufferings</HI> are more <HI>exasperated,</HI> as in the
<HI>torturing Engines</HI> there are requir'd a <HI>Turn</HI>
or two more of the <HI>Screws</HI> to make the Cri∣minal
speak <HI>out</HI> the Whole. For my own
Part, neither my <HI>Constitution,</HI> the natural
<HI>Tenderness</HI> of my <HI>Nerves,</HI> my <HI>Habitudes,</HI> nor
even my <HI>Conscience,</HI> would permit me to see
my Fellow-Creatures in <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Misery,</HI>
without contributeing all in my Power to
their <HI>Relief.</HI> Absolute <HI>Resignation,</HI> nay in∣ward
Contentment and Joy, in the infinitly
wise and perfect Will of GOD in all things,
<HI>prosperous</HI> or <HI>adverse,</HI> I know is my <HI>Duty,</HI>
is a State I admire, and ought to <HI>aspire</HI> after.
But I am sensible I am very far from it at
present, and I fear I could not be perfectly
happy in any <HI>Place,</HI> as I now feel myself, if
I certainly knew, that any of my Fellow-Crea∣tures
were to be <HI>eternally</HI> miserable <HI>any∣where.</HI>
I have therefore done my <HI>best,</HI> and I
believe my <HI>last,</HI> in <HI>Physic:</HI> I think I have
<HI>demonstrated</HI> from the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, from
the <HI>Writeings</HI> of some of the <HI>best Physicians,</HI>
my own <HI>long Experience,</HI> by running through
all the commonly described <HI>Distempers,</HI> that
<PB N="316" REF="332"/>
the Means and Methods I <HI>propose,</HI> will either
<HI>eradicat,</HI> or greatly <HI>relieve</HI> them; and though
the Method be <HI>slow,</HI> and somewhat <HI>self-deny∣ing,</HI>
yet <HI>Custom</HI> will make it still easier, and
the <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> arising from it will
in time make it <HI>pleasant;</HI> and in very bad
and painful Cases, it will be some <HI>Consola∣tion,</HI>
and give the desponding Patient a great
deal of <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> to <HI>know</HI> there is
still a <HI>Method</HI> remaining, that has the greatest
Probability to <HI>cure, relieve,</HI> or lay the suffer∣ing
Person easily <HI>down,</HI> that has not yet been
commonly prescribed, nor sufficiently en∣forced:
For I am <HI>morally</HI> certain, and am
<HI>myself</HI> intirely convinced, that a <HI>Milk and
Seed,</HI> or <HI>Milk and Turnep</HI> Diet, duely persisted
<HI>in,</HI> with the occasional Helps mentioned on
<HI>Exacerbations,</HI> will either <HI>totally cure,</HI> or
greatly <HI>relieve,</HI> every <HI>Chronical</HI> Distemper I
ever saw or read of; and plentiful <HI>Dilution,</HI>
(with proper Evacuation of the several kinds
premised) with <HI>Teas</HI> made of the <HI>saponaceous,</HI>
or <HI>aromatic Seeds,</HI> in their Order, will bid
fairest to cure all cureable <HI>Acute</HI> ones I know.</P>
