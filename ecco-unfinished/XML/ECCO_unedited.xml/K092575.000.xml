<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EFORE I come to treat of this Noble Subject, <HI>The Astronomi∣cal System of the Universe,</HI> with its wonderful Consequences as it is now discovered to us by the good Providence of God, and the labo∣rious Searches of this and the last Age; and chiefly, by the surprizing Sagacity and Penetration of the Illustrious Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton;</HI> I think it proper to premise <HI>two En∣quiries,</HI> as of great Consequence in way of Preparation to the receiving real Advantage by this Treatise; and without Satisfaction wherein, all such Discourses will be of little Effect with many of its Perusers: I mean the Enquiry about that <HI>Temper of Mind,</HI> which is necessary for the Discovery of Divine
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
Truth; and the Enquiry into that <HI>Degree of Evidence,</HI> that ought to be expected in Divine Matters. For, if all our Knowledge be de∣rived from God, and if it has pleased God to require a certain Degree of Probity, Se∣riousness, Impartiality, and Humility of Mind; together with hearty Prayers to him for his Direction, Blessing, and Assistance; and a proper Submission to him, before he will communicate his Truths to Men; I mean, at least, communicate the same so as shall make a due Impression upon their Minds, and turn to their real Profit and Edification, to their true Improvement in Virtue and Happiness: And if Men at any time come to the Examination either of the <HI>Works</HI> or <HI>Word</HI> of God, without that Temper of Mind, and without those Addresses for his Aid, and Submission to his Will, which He has deter∣mined shall be the Conditions of his Commu∣nications to them; especially if they come with the contrary Dispositions, with a Wick∣ed, Partial, Proud, and Ludicrous Temper, and with an utter Disregard to God, his Pro∣vidence, Worship, and Revelation; all their Researches will come to nothing. If, I say, this be the Case, as to the Divine Knowledge, as I believe it is, it cannot but be highly neces∣sary for us all to consider of this Matter be∣forehand, and to endeavour after the proper
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
Qualifications, before we set our selves about the main Enquiries themselves. If it has also pleased God to expect from us some more Deference and Regard for him, than for our poor fallible Fellow-Creatures here below; and to claim our Belief and Obedience, upon plain external Evidence, That certain Do∣ctrines or Duties are derived from him, with∣out our being always let into the Secrets of his Government, or acquainted with the Reasons of his Conduct; and also to expect that this plain external Evidence be treated, as it is in all the other Cases of Human Determina∣tions and Judgments; I mean, that it be sub∣mitted to, and acquiesced in, when it appears to be such, as in all other Cases would be allowed to be <HI>satisfactory,</HI> and <HI>plainly supe∣rior</HI> to what it alledged to the contrary: If, I say, this also be the Case as to Divine Knowledge, as I believe it is; It will be very proper for us all to consider of this Matter before-hand also; that so we may not be af∣terward disappointed, when in our future Progress we do not always find that <HI>irresistible</HI> and <HI>over-bearing</HI> Degree of Evidence for certain Divine Truths, which in such Cases is not to be had; which in truth is almost pecu∣liar to the Mathematicks; and the Expecta∣tion of which is so common, tho' unjust, a Pretence for Infidelity among us.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6"/>As to the former of these Enquiries, or that <HI>Temper of Mind</HI> which is necessary for the Discovery of Divine Truth; it can certainly be no other than what the Light of Nature, and the Consciences of Men influ∣enc'd thereby, dictate to us; those, I mean, already intimated; such as Seriousness, In∣tegrity, Impartiality, and Prayer to God; with the faithful Belief, and ready Practice of such Truths and Duites, as we do all along discover to be the Word and Will of God; together with such a Modesty, or Resignation of Mind, as will rest satisfy'd in certain sublime Points, clearly above our Determina∣tion, with full Evidence that they are re∣vealed by God, without always insisting, upon knowing the Reasons of the Divine Conduct therein immediately, before we will believe that Evidence. These are such things as all honest and sober Men, who have naturally a Sense of Virtue and of God in their Minds, must own their Obligation to. We all know, by the common Light of Nature, till we eclipse or corrupt it by our own Wickedness, That we are to deal with the utmost Fairness, Honesty, and Integrity in all, especially in Religious Matters; that we are to hearken to every Argument, and to consider every Testimony without Prejudice, or Byass, and ever to pronounce agreeably to our Convicti∣ons; that we are but Weak, Frail, Depen∣dent
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
Creatures, all whose Faculties, and the Exercise of them, are derived from God; that we ought therefore to exercise a due Modesty, and practise a due Submission, of Mind in Divine Matters, particularly in the Search after the Nature, and Laws, and Pro∣vidence of our great Creator: A Submission, I mean, not to Human, but to Divine Autho∣rity, when once it shall be authentickly made known to us: That the Humble Addressing of our selves to God for his Aid, Direction, and Blessing on our Studies and Enquiries, is one plain Instance of such our Submission to Him; and that a ready Compliance with Divine Revelation, and a ready Obedience to the Divine Will, so far as we have clearly discover'd it, is another necessary Instance of the same humble Regard to the Divine Majesty. Nor indeed can any one who comes to these Sacred Enquiries with the opposite Dispositi∣ons, of Dishonesty, Partiality, Pride, Buf∣foonry, Neglect of all Divine Worship, and Contempt of all Divine Revelation, and of all Divine Laws, expect, even by the Light of Nature, that God should be oblig'd to dis∣cover further Divine Truths to him. Nor will a sober Person, duly sensible of the dif∣ferent States of Creator and Creature, imi∣tate <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> and his Followers, in the first Ages of the Gospel; and set up some Metaphysical Subtilties, or Captious Questions
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
about the Conduct of Providence, as suffici∣ent to set aside the Evidence of confessed Mi∣racles themselves; but will rather agree to that wise Aphorism laid down in the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and supposed all over the Bible; That <HI>Secret Things belong unto the Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deu. xxix. 29.</NOTE> <HI>but Things that are revealed, to Us and to our Children, that we may do them</HI>. Now in order to the making some Impressions upon Men in this Matter, and the convincing them, that All our Discoveries are to be de∣rived from God; and that we are not to ex∣pect his Blessing upon our Enquiries, without the foregoing Qualifications, Devotions, and Obedience; Give me leave here, instead of my own farther Reasoning, to set down from the Ancient <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Wri∣ters, several Passages which seem to me very remarkable and very pertinent to our present Purpose: Not now indeed, as supposing any of those Observations of Sacred Authority, but as very right in themselves; very agreeable to the Light of Nature; and very good Te∣stimonies of the Sense of wise Men in the several ancient Ages of the World to this Purpose. And I chuse to do this the more largely here, because I think this Matter to be of very great Importance: because it seems to be now very little known or consider'd, at least very little practis'd, by several pretended Enquirers into Reveal'd Religion; and be∣cause
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
the Neglect hereof seems to me a main Occasion of the Scepticism and Infidelity of this Age.</P>
<P><HI>The Lord spake unto</HI> Moses <HI>saying; See,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. xxxi.1, 2, 3, 6.</NOTE> <HI>I have called by Name</HI> Bezaleel, <HI>the Son of</HI> Uri, <HI>the Son of</HI> Hur, <HI>of the Tribe of</HI> Judah: <HI>And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in Wisdom, and in Under∣standing, and in Knowledge,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And in the Hearts of all that are wise-hearted, I have put Wisdom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>It shall come to pass,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dent. xxviii.15.</NOTE> <HI>if thou wilt not hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his Commandments, and his Statutes, which I command thee this Day, that all these Curses shall come upon thee, and over∣take thee:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.28, 29.</NOTE> <HI>—The Lord shall smite thee with Madness, and Blindness, and Asto∣nishment of Heart; and thou shalt grope at Noon-day, as the Blind gropeth in Darkness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lord hath not given you an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to see,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xxix.4.</NOTE> <HI>and Ears to hear, unto this Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Give thy Servant an Understanding Heart, to judge thy People;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. iii 9, 10, 11.12.</NOTE> <HI>that I may discern between Good and Bad: For who is able to judge this thy so great a Peo∣ple? And the Speech pleased the Lord,
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
that</HI> Solomon <HI>had asked this Thing. And God said unto him, because thou hast asked this Thing; —Hast asked for thy self Understanding to discern Judg∣ment; behold I have done according to thy Words: Lo, I have given thee a Wise and an Understanding Heart; so that there was none like thee before thee; neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. —And all</HI> Israel <HI>heard of the Judg∣ment which the King had judged;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.28.</NOTE> <HI>and they feared the King; for they saw that the Wisdom of God was in him, to do Judgment,</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job xxxii.7, 8.</NOTE><HI>I said, Days should speak; and Mul∣titude of Years should teach Wisdom: But there is a Spirit in Man; and the Inspi∣ration of the Almighty giveth them Un∣derstanding.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">xxxiii.12, 13.</NOTE><HI>Behold in this thou art not just; I will answer thee, that God is greater than Man. Why dost thou strive against him? For he giveth not Account of any of his Matters,</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">xxxiv.31, 32.</NOTE><HI>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have born Chastisement; I will not of∣fend any more: That which I see not, teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">xxxvii.5.</NOTE><HI>God thundreth marvellously with his Voice: Great Things doth he which we cannot comprehend.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="11"/><HI>With God is terrible Majesty:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.22, 23, 24.</NOTE> <HI>Touch∣ing the Almighty we cannot find him out: He is excellent in Power, and in Judg∣ment, and in Plenty of Justice: He will not afflict. Men do therefore fear him: He respecteth not any that are wise of Heart,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who hath put Wisdom in the inward Parts?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xxxviii.36.</NOTE> <HI>Or who hath given Understanding unto the Heart?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Job <HI>answered the Lord and said;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xliii.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>I know that thou canst do every Thing, and that no Thought can be with-holden from thee. Who is is he that hideth Coun∣sel without Knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that I understood not; Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. — I have heard of thee by the Hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye seeth thee:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.6, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Meek will he guide in Judgment;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. xxv.9.</NOTE> <HI>The Meek will he teach his Way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.14.</NOTE> <HI>and he will shew them his Covenant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thou through thy Commandments hast made me wiser tha mine Enemies;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">cxix.98, 99, 100.</NOTE> <HI>for they are ever with me. I have more Understanding than all my Teachers, for thy Testimonies are my Meditation. I
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
understand more than the Ancients, be∣cause I keep thy Precepts.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.104.</NOTE> <HI>—Through thy Precepts I get Understanding; there∣fore I hate every false way.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">cxxxi.1.</NOTE><HI>Lord, my Heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty; neither do I exercise my self in great Matters, or in Things too high for me.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. ii.6.</NOTE><HI>The Lord giveth Wisdom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Under∣standing.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">iii.5, 6.</NOTE><HI>Trust in the Lord with all thine Heart; and lean not to thine own Understanding: In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy Paths.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.32.</NOTE><HI>The Froward is Abomination to the Lord: But his Secret is with the Righ∣teous.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. ii.26.</NOTE><HI>God giveth to a Man that is good in his Sight, Wisdom, and Knowledge, and Joy.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">iii.11.</NOTE><HI>God hath made every Thing Beautiful in his Time: Also he hath set the World in their Heart; so that no Man can find out the Work that God maketh, from the Beginning to the End.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.17.</NOTE><HI>Then I beheld all the Work of God, that a Man cannot find out the Work that is done under the Sun; because though a Man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it: Yea further, though a wise
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
Man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for these Four Children,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. i.17.</NOTE> <HI>God gave them Knowledge and Skill in all Learning and Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>None of the Wicked shall understand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xii.10.</NOTE> <HI>but the Wise shall understand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who is wise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. xiv.9.</NOTE> <HI>and he shall understand these Things; prudent, and he shall know them? For the ways of the Lord are right, and the Just shall walk in them; but the Transgressors shall fall there∣in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And the Angel that was sent unto me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Esd. iv.1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>whose Name was</HI> Uriel, <HI>gave me an An∣swer, and said, Thy Heart hath gone too far in this World: And thinkest thou to comprehend the Way of the most High?</HI></P>
<P><HI>He said moreover unto me;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.10, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Thine own Things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know; how should thy Vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest?</HI></P>
<P><HI>They that dwell upon the Earth may understand nothing:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.21.</NOTE> <HI>but that which is upon the Earth: And he that dwelleth above the Heavens, may only understand the Things that are above the height of the Heavens,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.22.</NOTE><HI>As for the Mysteries of God, they know them not.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">vii.7.</NOTE><HI>Wherefore I prayed, and Understand∣ing was given me: I called upon God, and the Spirit of Wisdom came to me.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">v, 15, 16.</NOTE><HI>It is God that leadeth unto Wisdom, and directeth the Wise. For in his Hand are both we and our Words; all Wisdom also, and Knowledge of Workmanship.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.21.</NOTE><HI>When I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain Wisdom, except God gave her me; (and that was a point of Wisdom also, to know whose Gift she was,) I prayed unto the Lord, and be∣sought him, and with my whole Heart I said:</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ix.4, 5, 6.</NOTE><HI>Give me Wisdom that sitteth by thy Throne, and reject me not from among thy Children. For I thy Servant, and Son of thine Handmaid, am a feeble Per∣son, and of a short Time, and too young for the Understanding of Judgment and Laws. For though a Man be never so perfect among the Children of Men,
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
yet if thy Wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hardly do we guess aright at Things that are upon Earth;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.16.</NOTE> <HI>and with Labour do we find the Things that are before us: But the Things that are in Heaven who hath searched out?</HI></P>
<P><HI>All Wisdom cometh from the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. i.1.v.10</NOTE> <HI>and is with him for ever. — She is with all Flesh according to his Gift; and he hath given her to them that love him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If thou desire Wisdom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>keep the Com∣mandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee. For the Fear of the Lord is Wisdom and Instruction; and Faith and Meekness are his Delight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mysteries are revealed unto the Meek —Seek not out the Things that are too hard for thee;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">iii.19, 21, 22.</NOTE> <HI>neither search the Things that are above thy Strength. But what is commanded thee think thereupon with Reverence: For it is not needful for thee to see the Things that are in Secret.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let thy Mind be upon the Ordinances of the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vi.37.</NOTE> <HI>and meditate continually in his Commandments. He shall establish thine Heart, and give thee Wisdom at thine own Desire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wisdom, Knowledge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">xi.15, 16.</NOTE> <HI>and Understand∣ing of the Law, are of the Lord. Love,
<PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>
and the way of good Works, are from him. Error and Darkness had their Beginning together with Sinners.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">xv.7, 8.</NOTE><HI>Foolish Men shall not attain unto Wisdom; and Sinners shall not see her. For she is far from Pride; and Men that are Lyars cannot remember her.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. i.5.</NOTE><HI>If any of you lack Wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all Men libe∣rally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.17.</NOTE> <HI>—Every good Gift, and every perfect Gift, is from Above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="17"/><HI>If I once know that he is a Man of Probity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Recog.</HI> ii.4.</NOTE> <HI>and unblamable in those Points of Duty wherein there can be no doubt but they are good; that is, if he be sober, if he be merciful, if he be just, if he be meek and human; which no one can doubt to be virtuous and good Things; then it will, in all Probability, be reason∣able to expect that to him that hath these excellent Virtues, that which is wanting to his Faith and Knowledge will be conferr'd; and that wherein his Life, which is so commendable in the rest, shall still appear blamable, it may be amended. But if he be involved and polluted in Sins, those I mean which are notoriously such; I must not then declare plainly to him the least Part of the con∣ceal'd recondite Branches of Divine Know∣ledge: But rather, with great Boldness, deal with him that he must leave off his Sins, and amend his vicious Actions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whence 'tis very plain, that some do oppose the Truth of the Religion of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 16.</NOTE> <HI>not because the Foundation of Faith does not seem to them certain; but because they are either involv'd in a Superabun∣dance of Sins, or prepossess'd by their wicked Habits, or puff'd up by the Pride of their Heart; so that they do not be∣lieve
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
even those Things which they think they see with their own Eyes.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 17.</NOTE><HI>But now, because an innate Affection towards God our Creator, might seem sufficient for the Salvation of those that lov'd him, the Enemy studies to pervert the Affection of Men, and to render them Enemies and Ungrateful to their Creator,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 18.</NOTE><HI>We not only do enjoy God's Benefits, but by his Aid and Power it was that we came into Being, when we were not: whom also, if we please, we shall obtain from him, as our Reward, to be for ever in Happiness. To the End therefore that Unbelievers may be distinguish'd from Believers, and the Pious from the Impious; the Evil one has Permission to make Use of these Arts, whereby every one's Affections towards their proper Pa∣rent may be tried,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 19.</NOTE><HI>Here therefore, that is, while we con∣tinue in this present Life, where is the Place of Action, you ought to acknow∣ledge the Will of God. For if any one has a mind to enquire after Things that cannot be found out, before he amends his Life, such Enquiry is foolish, and will be to no Purpose. For Time is short; and the Judgment of God will be appointed on Account of Mens Actions, and not their
<PB N="xvii" REF="19"/>
Questions. And therefore let us first of all make Enquiry what we are to Do, and after what manner it is to be done; that we may be thought worthy of Eternal Life.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 20.</NOTE> <HI>For if we spend this short Time of Life in idle and unprofitable Questions, we shall certainly go to God empty, and destitute of good Works; at that Time I mean, when the Judgment shall be ap∣pointed for our Works; for every Thing has its proper Time and Place. This is the Placc, this is the Time for Works: The World to come for Retribution. Lest therefore we should change the Order of Time and Place, and thereby be our own Hindrance; let our first Enquiry be what is</HI> God's Righteousness; <HI>that like those that are going a Journey, we may have a plen∣tiful Provision for our Journey, that is, good Works; that so we may be able to arrive at the Kingdom of God, as at a very great City. For to those who are well dispos'd, God is manifested by those Works of Nature which he has made, and is attested to by his own Creatures. Since therefore there ought to be no doubt concerning the Existence of God, we are only to enquire about his Righteousness, and his Kingdom. But if our Minds have an Inclination to put us on the Enquiry about secret and hidden Things, before we
<PB N="xviii" REF="20"/>
enquire after the Works of Righteousness, we ought to give an Account to our selves of this Procedure: For if we live well, and are thought worthy to obtain Salvation, we shall go to God Chast and Pure, and be filled with the Holy Ghost; and shall know all such secret and hidden Things, without any Cavilling or Question; which at present, though any one should spend the entire Time of his Life in the Enquiry, he will be so far from finding them out, that he will bring himself into greater Er∣rors; because he aims to arrive at the Haven of Life, without walking in the way of Life.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">iii.19.</NOTE><HI>Do but consider that Silence and Quiet∣ness with which all the People stand; and how, as you see, they are very Patient, and pay a great Honour to the Truths of God, even before they are instructed in them. For as to any greater Honour they have not yet learned that 'tis their Duty to pay it. For which Reason I have Hope, in the Mercy of God, that he will re∣ceive kindly this Religious Disposition of their Minds towards him; will afford the Reward of Victory to him that preaches the Truth; and will make manifest to them which of us is the Preacher of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="21"/><HI>Therefore is it necessary for Men to enquire whether they have it in their Power, by seeking to find what is good;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 37.</NOTE> <HI>and when they have found it, to do it. For this is that for which he must be judg'd. As for what is beyond this, no one but a Prophet needs to know it: And with good Reason. For to what Purpose is it for Men to know after what Manner the World was made? Which yet would be necessary for us to know, if we were to undertake so artful a Piece of Work our selves. But now it is sufficient for us, and for our Worshipping God, to know that He made the World: But after what Man∣ner he made it, we are not to enquire; because, as I said, 'tis not our Business to learn the Knowledge of that Art, as if we were to make somewhat like it. Nor are we to be called to Account for this, Why we did not learn after what Manner the World was made? But only for this, That we are ignorant of its Creator.

<P>Now from all this Evidence, and much more that might be alledg'd, it is apparent that the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religions al∣ways suppose that there must be a due Temper of Mind in the Enquirers, or else the Argu∣ments for those Religions will not have their due Effect. That the Course of God's Provi∣dence designs hereby to distinguish between the well-dispos'd, the Meek, the Humble, and the Pious; which are those whom the common Light of Nature declares may expect the Divine Blessing on their Studies of this sort; and the Ill-dispos'd, the Obsti∣nate, the Proud and the Impious; which are those whom the same common Light of Nature assures us may expect the Divine Ma∣lediction on the same: And that 'tis not for want of convincing and satisfactory Evidence in the Business of Revelation, but because many Men come with Perverse, Sceptical,
<PB N="xxii" REF="24"/>
and wicked Dispositions, that they fail of Satisfaction therein. Accordingly, I think it is true in common Observation, That the Virtuous and the Religious, I mean those that are such according to Natural Conscience do rarely, if ever, fail on their Enquiries to Embrace and Acquiesce in both the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations; and that the Debauch'd and Prophane do as seldom fail on their Enquiries to Reject and Ridicule them. Which different Success of the same Exami∣nation, agrees exactly with the whole Tenor of the Scriptures; and is the very same which must be true, in case those Scriptures be true also; and is, by Consequence, a consi∣derable Confirmation of their real Verity and Inspiration. And certainly, he that considers his own Weakness and Dependance on God, and that all Truth and Evidence must come originally from him, will by Natural Judg∣ment and Equity pronounce, that he who expects the Divine Blessing and Illumination, in Points of such vast Consequence, as those of Revelation most certainly are, ought above all things to purify his Will, and rectify his Conduct in such Points as all the World knows to be the Will of God; and to Address him∣self to the Divine Majesty with due Fervency and Seriousness, for his Aid and Assistance, before he can justly promise himself Success in so great and momentous an Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="25"/>But then as to the <HI>Second Enquiry,</HI> or the <HI>Degree of Evidence</HI> that ought to be expected in Religious Matters, it seems to me very necessary to say somewhat upon this Subject also, before we come to our main De∣sign. For as on the one Side it is a great Error in all Cases to expect such Evidence as the Nature of the Subject renders impos∣sible; so is it as weak on the other Side, to lay the Stress of important Truths on such Evidence, as is in its own Nature Unsatis∣factory and Precarious; or to assert with great Assurance what can no way be Proved, even by that sort of Evidence which is proper for the Subject in Debate. And Instance of the first Sort we have in <HI>Autolycus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theoph. ad Anto∣lye, L. I. in initio.</NOTE> an Hea∣then, in his Debates with <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch;</HI> who appears weakly to have insisted upon <HI>Seeing</HI> the God of the Christians, e'er he would believe his Existence: While one of the known Attributes of that God is, that he is <HI>Invisible</HI>. And almost equally preposterous would any Philosophick Sceptick now be, who should require the <HI>Sight</HI> of the Air in which we Breath, before he would believe that there was such an Element at all. Whereas it is clear, that the Air may be demonstrated to be sufficiently sensible and real, by a Thousand Experiments; while yet none of those Expe∣riments can render it <HI>Visible</HI> to us: Just as the Existence of a Supreme Being may be
<PB N="xxiv" REF="26"/>
demonstrated by innumerable Arguments, al∣though none of those Arguments imply even the Possibility of his being properly <HI>Seen</HI> by any of his Creatures. But then, that we may keep a Mean here, and may neither on one Side, expect in our Religious Enquiries, <HI>overbearing,</HI> or strictly <HI>Mathematick Evi∣dence,</HI> such as is impossible to be deny'd or doubted of by any; which would render the constant Design of Providence, already stated entirely ineffectual, and <HI>force</HI> both Good and Bad to be Believers, without all Regard to their Qualifications and Temper of Mind: Nor on the other Side, may depend on such weak and precarious Arguments, as are not really sufficient nor satisfactory to even Fair, Honest, and Impartial Men; I intend here to Consider, what that Degree of Evidence is, which ought to be here insisted on; without which we are not, and with which we are obliged to acquiesce in Divine Matters. Now this Degree of Evidence I take to be that, and no other, which upright Judges are de∣termin'd by in all the important Affairs of Estate and Life that come before them: And according to which, they ever aim to give Sentence in their Courts of Judicature. I chuse to Instance in this Judicial Evidence, and these Judicial Determinations especially, because the Persons concern'd in such Matters are, by long Use, and the Nature of their
<PB N="xxv" REF="27"/>
Employment, generally speaking, the best and most sagacious Discoverers of Truth, and those that judge the most unbiass'dly and fairly, concerning sufficient or insufficient Evi∣dence of all others. Such upright Judges then, never expect strictly Undeniable, or Mathematick Evidence; which they know is, in Human Affairs, absolutely impossible to be had: They don't require that the Witnesses they Examine, should be Infallible, or Im∣peccable, which they are sensible would be alike Wild and Ridiculous: Yet do they ex∣pect full, sufficient, or convincing Evidence; and such a is plainly Superior to what is al∣ledged on the other Side: And they require that the Witnesses they believe, be, so far as they are able to discover, of a good Cha∣racter, Upright and Faithful. Nor do they think it too much Trouble to use their utmost Skill and Sagacity in discovering where the Truth lies; how far the Witnesses agree with or contradict each other; and which way the several Circumstances may be best compar'd, so as to find out any Forgery, or detect any Kna∣very which may be suspected in any Branches of the Evidence before them. They do not themselves pretend to judge of the Reality or Obligation of any Ancient Laws, or Acts of Parliament, from their own meer Guesses or Inclinations, but from the Authentickness of the Records which contain them; and though
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28"/>
they are not able always to see the Reason, or Occasion, or Wisdom of such Laws, or Acts of Parliament; yet do they, upon full External Evidence that they are Genuine, allow and execute the same: As considering themselves to be not Legislators, but Judges: And own∣ing that Ancient Laws, and Ancient Facts, are to be known not by Guesses or Supposals, but by the Production of Ancient Records, and Original Evidence for their Reality. Nor in such their Procedure do they think themselves guilty in their Sentences, if at any Time afterwards they discover that they have been impos'd upon by false Witnesses, or forged Records; supposing, I mean, that they are conscious that they did their utmost to dis∣cover the Truth, and went exactly by the best Evidence that lay before them; as know∣ing they have done their Duty, and must in such a Case be Blameless before God and Man, notwithstanding the Mistake in the Sentences themselves. Now this is that Procedure which I would earnestly recommend to those that have a Mind to enquire to good Purpose into Re∣veal'd Religion. That after they have taken Care to purge themselves from all those Vices, which will make it their great Interest that Religion should be false; after they have re∣solv'd upon Honesty, Impartiality, and Mo∣desty, which are Virtues by the Law of Na∣ture; after they have devoutly implor'd the
<PB N="xxvii" REF="29"/>
Divine Assistance and Blessing on this their important. Undertaking; which is a Duty likewise they are obliged to by the same Law of Nature; that after all this Preparation, I say, they will set about the Enquiry it self, in the very same Manner that has been al∣ready describ'd, and that all our upright Judges proceed by in the Discovery of Truth. Let them spare for no Pains, but consult all the Originals, whenever they can come at them: And let them use all that Diligence, Sagacity and Judgment, which they are Ma∣sters of, in order to see what real External Evidence there is for the Truth of the Facts on which the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religions do depend. I here speak of the <HI>Truth of Facts,</HI> as the surest way to determine us in this Enquiry; because all the World, I think, owns that if those Facts be true, these Insti∣tutions of Religion must also be true, or be deriv'd from God; and that no particular Difficulties, as to the Reasons of several Laws, or the Conduct of Providence in seve∣ral Cases, which those Institutions no where pretend to give us a full Account of, can be sufficient to set aside the convincing Evidence which the Truth of such Facts brings along with it. For Example: Those who are well satisfy'd of the Truth of the <HI>Mosaick</HI> History of the Ten miraculous Plagues with which the God of <HI>Israel</HI> smote the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> of
<PB N="xxviii" REF="30"/>
the drowning of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> while the <HI>Israelites</HI> were miraculously conducted through the same; and of the ama∣zing manner wherein the Decalogue was given by God to that People at Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> will for certain, believe that the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion was in the main derived from God, though he should find several occasional Passages in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Sacred Books, which he could not Account for, and several ritual Laws given that Nation, which he could not guess at the Reasons why they were given them. And the Case is the very same as to the Miraculous Resurrection, and Glorious Ascension of our Blessed Saviour, <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> with Regard to the <HI>New Testament</HI>. On which Account I reckon that the Truth of such Facts is to be principally enquired into, when we have a mind to satisfy our selves in the Verity of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian Religions</HI>. And if it be alledg'd that some of these Facts are too remote to afford us any certain Means of Discovery at this Distance of Time; I An∣swer, That then we are to select such of those Facts as we can examine, and to search into the Acknowledgment or Denial of those that are Ancienter, in the oldest Testimonies now Extant; into the Effects and Consequences, and standing Memorials of such Facts in After Ages, and how far they were real, and al∣low'd to be so; and in short, we are to
<PB N="xxix" REF="31"/>
determine concerning them, by the best Evi∣dence we can now have; and not let a bare Suspicion, or a Wish that Things had been otherwise, overbalance our real Evidence of Facts in any Case whatsoever. I do not mean that our Enquirer is to have no Regard to <HI>Internal Characters,</HI> or the <HI>Contents</HI> of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations; or that he is not to examine into that also in the General, before he admits even the Proof from Miracles themselves; because what pretended Miracles soever are wrought for the Support of Idolatry, or Wickedness; for the Establisment of Notions contrary to the Divine Artributes, or of an Immortal, or Prophane, or Cruel Religion, though they may prove such a Religiou to be Supernatural, yet will they only prove that it comes from wicked Daemons, or Evil Spirits, and not from a God of Purity and Holiness, and so will by no means prove it Divine, or worthy of our Reception. But then it is, for the main, so well known, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Institutions do agree to the Divine Attributes, and do tend to Purity, Holiness, Justice, and Charity; and are opposite to all Immorality, Prophaneness, and Idolatry, that I think there will not need much Examination in so clear a Case; and that, by Conse∣quence, our main Enquiry is to be as to the Truth of the Facts thereto relating. And in
<PB N="xxx" REF="32"/>
this Case, I fear not to Invite all our Scep∣ticks and Unbelievers, to use their greatest Nicety, their entire Skill, their shrewdest Abilities, and their utmost Sagacity in this Enquiry; being well assur'd from my own Ob∣servations in this Matter, That the proper Result of such an exact Historical Enquiry will be as plainly and evidently on the Side of <HI>Reveal'd,</HI> as I have demonstrated in this Treatise, that Philosophy and Mathematicks are on the Side of both <HI>Natural and Reveal'd Religion</HI>. And now having Premis'd this, I come to my main Design; to shew what is properly the <HI>Religion</HI> of a genuine and con∣sidering <HI>Astronomer;</HI> or what are properly the <HI>Astronomical Principles</HI> of Natural and Reveal'd Religion.</P>

<P N="1">1.<SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>VERY Body perseveres in its own present State, whether it be that of Rest, or uniform direct Motion; unless it be compelled by some Force impress'd, to change that State.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="36"/>(2.) All Motion is of it self Rectilinear.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) All revolving Bodies endeavour to re∣cede from the Center of their Motion; and by how much the Motion is the swifter, this En∣deavour is the greater.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The Mutation of Motion is proportional to the moving Force impress'd; and is accord∣ing to the Direction of that Line along which that Force is impress'd.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Re-action is always contrary and equal to Action. That is, the Actions of two Bo∣dies acting upon each other, whether they be Impulses or Attractions, are always in opposite Directions, and are also equal.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) If of two equal Bodies, void of Elasti∣city, one of them which is in Motion meets the other at rest, upon the meeting they will both proceed forwards together, to the same Part, with half the Velocity of the Body which was moved.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) If two equal Bodies, void of Elasticity, do directly meet each other with the same Ve∣locity, they upon the Collision will both of them rest.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) If two unequal Bodies, destitute of Ela∣sticity, meet one another with such Velocities, that by how much the greater exceeds the other in Magnitude, by so much it is exceeded by the lesser in Swiftness, so that the Velocities are re∣ciprocal to the Bodies; they will both rest after that meeting.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) If a moving Body strike another at rest, (but both void of Elasticity) how unequal so∣ever they be in Bulk and Quantity of Matter, they will both move after the Shock with the same Velocity towards the same Parts, as in the
<PB N="3" REF="37"/>
sixth Law: And the common Velocity will be so much less than the first, as both the Bodies together are greater than the Body first mo∣ved.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) If two unequal Bodies, void of Elasti∣city, which are moved with equal Velocity to opposite Parts, hit against one another, the Quan∣tity of Motion in both, taken together after the Collision, will be the <HI>Difference</HI> only of the former Motions.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) If two equal Bodies, void of Elastici∣ty, be mov'd with unequal Velocity towards the same Part, upon their Collision there will remain the same Quantity or <HI>Sum</HI> of their Mo∣tions; but the common Velocity will be only the Half of both the former Velocities put to∣gether.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) If two unequal Bodies, void of Ela∣sticity, the greater overtakes the lesser, the common Velocity, after the Shock, will be greater than half the Sum of the former Velo∣cities. And on the contrary, it will be less when the lesser Body overtakes the greater.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) If a Body perfectly Elastic dasheth up∣on another Body of the same sort which is qui∣escent and equal; after the Collision the Motion will be wholly transferr'd into that which was quiescent before, and with the same Celerity; but the Body which was mov'd before, will now rest.</P>
<P N="14">(14.) If two Bodies perfectly Elastic, which are equal, but mov'd with an unequal Celerity, dash one upon another, they, whether they were before carried to the same Part, or to the con∣trary, will, after the Contact, be mov'd each with that Celerity which the other had before.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="4" REF="38"/>(15.) Any Body, how great soever, will be moved by any Body, how small soever, coming with any Velocity whatsoever.</P>
<P N="16">(16.) When two Bodies, perfectly Elastical, are dash'd one upon the other, they depart from one another with the same Celerity where∣with they approach'd one to the other; that is, not with the same <HI>absolute</HI>, but <HI>relative</HI> Celerity.</P>
<P N="17">(17.) If two Bodies perfectly Elastical, do each return to the Impulse with the same Cele∣rity wherewith they rebounded from it; they will each of them, after the second Impulse, acquire the same Celerity as they had before the first Meeting.</P>
<P N="18">(18.) If two Bodies meet one another, whe∣ther they be Elastic or not Elastic, there doth not always remain the same Quantity of Moti∣on as was before, but it may be greater or less.</P>
<P N="19">(19.) If a Body perfectly Elastical, which is greater, hits upon a lesser one which is quies∣cent, it will give a Velocity to it less than the double of its own.</P>
<P N="20">(20.) If two Bodies perfectly Elastic, the Ce∣lerities whereof are in reciprocal Proportion to their Magnitudes, meet one another directly and oppositely, they will both rebound with the same Celerity with which they came to each other.</P>
<P N="21">(21.) The Celerity which a great Body per∣fectly Elastic, gives to a lesser perfectly quies∣cent, which is also perfectly Elastic, hath that Proportion to that Velocity, which the lesser moved with the like Celerity gives to the great∣er when quiescent, which the Magnitude of the greater hath to the Magnitude of the less.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="5" REF="39"/>(22.) Every Body will in the same time de∣scribe the Diagonal of a Parallelogram with Forces conjunct, that it would do the Sides with those Forces separate.</P>
<P N="23">(23.) All compound Forces and Motion what∣ever may be reduc'd into innumerable other di∣rect Forces and Motions; and on the contrary, all direct Forces, and rectilinear Motions, may be suppos'd to be compounded of innumerable oblique Motions and Forces.</P>
<P N="24">(24.) The Quantity of Motion which is col∣lected, by taking the Sum of the Motions to the same Part, and the Difference of those to the contrary Parts, is not chang'd by the Acti∣ons of Bodies one upon another.</P>
<P N="25">(25.) The common Center of Gravity of a System of Bodies doth not change its State ei∣ther of Motion or Rest, from the Actions of the Bodies amongst themselves, (whether they be Attractions or Impulses;) and therefore the common Center of Gravity of all Bodies act∣ing upon one another (Actions and Impedi∣ments, whether external or otherwise arising, being excluded) doth either rest, or is mov'd uniformly straight forwards.</P>
<P N="26">(26.) The Motions of two Bodies included in a given Space, and partaking of the Motion thereof, are the same amongst themselves, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther that Space resteth, or the same is mov'd uniformly straight forward, without a Circular Motion.</P>
<P N="27">(27.) If Bodies be mov'd in any wise amongst themselves, and be pressed with equal accelera∣tive Forces according to parallel Lines, they will all continue to be mov'd in the same manner amongst themselves, as if they were not pressed with those Forces.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="6" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. The Velocities of a Body accelerated by any uniform urging Force whatever, are betwixt themselves, as the Times are wherein that uni∣form Force is impress'd; that is, in double the Time double, in triple the Time triple, and in four times the Time quadruple.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Lines which Bodies by any urging uniform Force do describe, are in the duplicate Proportion of the Times, <HI>i. e.</HI> if the Times be Seconds, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the whole Lines describ'd will be amongst themselves, as One, Four, Nine, Sixteen, Twenty-five, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are the Squares of the former.</P>
<P N="7">VII. In a Cycloid inverted, whose Axis is crected perpendicular, the Times of the De∣scent wherein a Body let down from any Point whatever in it, comes to the lowest Point, are always equal betwixt themselves.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. All Projectiles, not perpendicular to the Horizon, describe Parabola's, so far as they are not hindred by the Resistance of the Air.</P>
<P N="9">IX. If two Bodies do in equal Times run over two whole unequal Circumferences, with an equable Motion, the centripetal Force in the greater Circumference will be to that which is in the less, as the Circumferences are one to another directly; or, which is the same, as their Diameters, or Radii.</P>
<P N="10">X. If two Bodies revolve in the same, or equal Circles with unequal Celerities, but both with
<PB N="7" REF="41"/>
an equable Motion, the centripetal Force of the swifter will be to that of the slower, in the Proportion of the Celerities duplicated; or as the Squares of the Arches described together.</P>
<P N="11">XI. If two Bodies revolve in unequal Circles with equal Velocity, their centripetal Forces will be in the reciprocal Proportion of their Circum∣ference or Diameters; so that in the lesser Cir∣cumference there will be the greater centripetal Force, and in the greater the lesser.</P>
<P N="12">XII. If two Bodies be mov'd in unequal Circles, with an unequal Velocity, in the sub∣duplicate Proportion of the Circumferences, Diameters, or Radii, the centripetal Forces will be equal every where, and neither increas'd in the Access nor Recess.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. If two Bodies be mov'd in unequal Circles, with an unequal Velocity, in the sub∣duplicate Proportion of the Circumferences, Dia∣meters, or Radii, reciprocally; so that in the greater Circle the Velocity be the lesser, and in the lesser Circle the greater, and this in the said sub-duplicate reciprocal Proportion, the centripetal Force will be reciprocally as the Squares of the Radii or Distances.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. If two Bodies revolve in unequal Cir∣cles with an unequal Celerity; so that by how much greater the Radius, Diameter or Circum∣ference is, so much the less the Velocity is; and by how much the less the Radius is, so much the greater is the Velocity, and this in the reci∣procal Proportion of the Radii, the centripetal Forces will be as the Cubes of the Radii reci∣procally.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The Area's, which revolving Bodies do describe by Radii drawn unto the unmovable
<PB N="8" REF="42"/>
Center of Force acting upon them, do both lie in immovable Planes, and are proportional to the Times; and so in any given Time are eve∣ry where equal; the Velocity of Motion in the lesser Distance, and the Slowness thereof in the greater so tempering the Description of the Area's, that from those various Distances no Difference of the Spaces run over in the given Time doth ever arise.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Every Body which is mov'd in a Curve Line, and doth by a Radius drawn to some Point, either immovable, or going forwards uniformly with a Rectilineal Motion, describe Area's about that Point proportional to the Times; is urged or impress'd by a centripetal Force tending to the same Point.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. If a Body be mov'd in an Ellipsis about the Center of the same, the centripetal Force will be directly as the Distance of the Body from the same Center.</P>
<P N="20">XX. If a Body be mov'd in a Spiral Line, which cuts all the Radii in the same Angle, the centripetal Force will be reciprocally as the Cube of the Distance from the Center of the Spiral.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. If a Body be mov'd in an Ellipsis or Pa∣rabola, or Hyperbola, about its Focus, the cen∣tripetal Force will be every where in the dupli∣cate Proportion of the Distance from the same Focus reciprocally.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. The Velocity of a Body moving in a Parabola about a Body placed in the Focus, the Force whereof is in the reciprocal duplicate Pro∣portion of the Distances, is every where to the Velocity of a Body revolving in a Circle in the same time, in the subduplicate Proportion of
<PB N="9" REF="43"/>
the Number, Two to Unity; or as the Diago∣nal of a Square to its Side; that is, as 10 to 7 nearly.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Two Bodies attracting one another, describe like Figures both about the Common Center of Gravity, and about one another; that is, whilst they really describe like Figures about the Common Center of Gravity, the Eye being placed in either of the two, and not perceiving its own Motion, or that of the Center of Gra∣vity, a Figure like to the same will thereby seem to it to be describ'd.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. If a primary Planet revolving about the Sun carry a Moon along with it, this will be so mov'd about the Primary, that it will per∣petually be accelerated from the Quadrature with the Sun, unto the Conjunction or Opposition next following; but from the Conjunction to the Quadrature, it will be retarded; and conse∣quently will be carried more swiftly about the Conjunction and Opposition, but more slowly about the Quadratures.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. The absolute Force of the Sun in the disturbing the Secondary Planets, and the Effects thereof, in divers Distances from the Sun, is in the triplicate Proportion of those Distances inversly.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. If a Fluid be contain'd in a Channel form'd in the Surface of any Planet, Primary or Secondary, and be uniformly revolv'd together with the Planet with a diurnal periodic Motion; each Part of this Fluid will be accelerated and retarded by turns; in its Conjunction and Op∣position, or at Noon-day and Midnight, it will be swifter; in the Quadratures, or at the 6th Hour Evening and Morning, it will be slower
<PB N="10" REF="44"/>
than the contiguous Surface of the Globe; and thus there will be a flux and reflux in the Chan∣nel, by turns perpetually.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. If a Solid Ring be put about a Globe perfectly spherical, at the Equator of the same, and stick to it; there will indeed be no Motion of Flux and Reflux, but the vibrating Motion of Inclination, and the Precession of the Nodes, will remain. Let the Globe have the same Axis with the Ring, and compleat its Revolution in the same time; and with its Surface touch the Ring inwardly, and cleave to it; by its par∣ticipating of the Motion thereof, the whole Frame will vibrate to and fro, and the Nodes will go back.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. If towards each equal Points of a Sphe∣rical Physical Surface of equal Thickness every where, but which Thickness is so small that it is not to be regarded, there be a Tendency of equal Centripetal Forces decreasing in the du∣plicate Proportion of the Distances from the same Points; any Corpuscle placed any where within this Surface, will not be attracted unto any Part by the said Force; but will either rest, or continue that Motion which is begun with∣out any Disturbance, and in the same manner as if it were acted upon with no Force at all from that Surface: And the case is the same in any Spherical concave Space within a solid Sphere, about its Center.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. If unto each Point of some given Sphere, which is Homogeneous, or of equal Den∣sity every where, there be a Tendency of equal Centripetal Force decreasing in the duplicate Proportion of the Distances from the points; a Corpuscle placed within the Sphere, is attracted
<PB N="11" REF="45"/>
with a Force proportional to its Distance from the Center thereof.</P>
<P N="59">LIX. If the Density of a Fluid compos'd of Particles which do flee from each other, be as the Compression; so that if the pressing Force be two, or four, or eightfold, the Density thence arising is so likewise; the Centrifugal Force of the Particles is reciprocally proportional to the Distances from the Center: And, <HI>vice versâ</HI>, where the said Force is reciprocally proportional to the Distances from their Centers, the Parti∣cles which flee from each other compose an ela∣stic Fluid, the Density whereof is proportional to the Compression.</P>
<P N="60">LX. The Quantity of Matter in all Bodies, is exactly proportional to their Weight.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. Bodies mov'd with an unequal Velo∣city in a very Subtle Fluid, are resisted by the Fluid in the Duplicate Proportion of their Ve∣locity.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. As the Resistance of Fluids in divers Velocities is in the duplicate Proportion of the Velocity; so in divers Densities the Velocity be∣ing given, it is in the direct Proportion of the Density it self; but the Density and Velocity being given, in the duplicate Proportion of the Diameters; and consequently the Resistance in general is in a Proportion compounded of the duplicate Proportion of the Velocity, and the duplicate Proportion of Diameters, and the simple Proportion of the Density of the Medi∣um directly.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. If a solid Cylinder, infinitely long, be revolv'd in an uniform and infinite Fluid about its own Axis, the Position whereof is gi∣ven, and the Fluid be mov'd round by the Im∣pulse
<PB N="12" REF="46"/>
of this Cylinder only; and every Part of the Fluid perseveres uniformly in its Motion; the periodic Times of the Fluid will be as their Distances from the Axis of the Cylinder di∣rectly; and the Velocities will be every where equal.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. If a solid Sphere, in an uniform and infinite Fluid, be revolv'd uniformly about its own Axis, the Position whereof is given; and by the Impulse of this alone the Fluid be turned round, and every part of the Fluid per∣severes uniformly in its Motion; the periodic Times of the Parts of the Fluid will be as the Squares of the Distances from the Center of the Sphere.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. The Velocities of all the Planets, whether Primary or Secondary, about their Central Bodies, by being in the reciprocal sub∣duplicate Proportion of the Distances from their Centers, do wholly overthrow the <HI>Cartesian</HI> Hy∣pothesis of Vortices.</P>

<HEAD>PART. II. A particular Account of the System of the Ʋniverse.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Sun</HI>, that immense and amazing Globe of Fire, the Fountain of all the Light and Heat of the whole Planetary and Cometary World, is in Diameter 763,000 Miles, in Sur∣face it contains 1,813.200,000.000 Square Miles, and in Solidity 23.000,000.000,000.000 Cubical Ones, in Magnitude 900.000, and in Quantity of Matter 230.000 Times as great as the Earth, tho' only a Quarter so Dense; and all Bodies weigh 24 Times as much on its Surface, as on the Surface of the Earth. It is situate near the Center of Gravity of the whole System, and revolves in about 25 Days and a half round its own Axis. It has frequently Spots, and some∣times brighter Parts seen upon its Surface, of vast Dimensions; as if they were great burning Vulcanos, sometimes clouded with Smoke, and sometimes clear. Its Heat, on its own Surface
<PB N="15" REF="49"/>
is about 45000 Times as Intense as that on the Earth. All the Planets and Comets gravitate to the <HI>Sun</HI> in a duplicate reciprocal Proportion of their Distances from it, and are thereby retain∣ed in their several Orbits. Their Periodical Times are in a sesquiplicate or sesquialteral pro∣portion to their Distance; that is, the Tripli∣cate or Cubes of the Distances, are as the Du∣plicate or Squares of the periodical Times; and that to the greatest Exactness possible; which equally obtains in the secondary Planets, with regard to their primary Ones also; and is the fundamental Law of the entire System.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> is the nearest to the <HI>Sun</HI> of all the known Planets. Its utmost Elongation from it, to an Eye on the Earth is but 28 Degrees, so that it is but rarely seen by us. This Planet is in Diameter 4,248 Miles, in Surface it contains 55,000.000 of square Miles; and in Solidity 39.000,000.000 of Cubical Ones, &amp; is 32,000.000 Miles distant from the <HI>Sun</HI>, and describes a ve∣ry Eccentrical Ellipsis about it in less than 3 Months, or in 88 Days. The Eccentricity of its Orbit is 210/1000 of its mean Distance from the <HI>Sun</HI>; and by its Position must appear thro' a Telescope with Phases like those of the Moon. No secon∣dary Planets have yet been observed about it, nor any Diurnal Rotation. It enjoys above 6 Times as much Light and Heat from the Sun, as doth the Earth; and it appears very rarely like a Spot in the Disk of the Sun, in its Retrograde Conjunctions, when it passes between the Sun and Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Venus</HI> is somewhat higher in the System, and so has its utmost Elongation 45 Degrees. It is a larger Planet than <HI>Mercury</HI>, and comes some∣times
<PB N="16" REF="50" MS="y"/>
much nearer to us. It is our Morning and Evening Star by turns, and is the Brightest of the Heavenly Bodies to us, next the Moon, as casting a visible Shadow in the Dark, and sometimes appearing in the very Day-time also. It is in a Diameter 7.900 Miles; in Surface it contains 200,000.000 of Square Miles; and in Solidity it is 264.000,000.000 of Cubical Ones; and is distant 59,000.000 from the Sun, and de∣scribes its Ellipsis about it in 7 Months and a half, or 225 Days. The Eccentricity of its Or∣bit is but 7/1000 of its mean Distance from the Sun. It most plainly thro' the Tellescope ap∣pears with Phases, and Horned like the Moon. No secondary Planets have yet been discovered about it▪ yet has it a Diurnal Revolution on its own Axis in 23 Hours. It receives almost dou∣ble the Light and Heat from the Sun which the Earth does; and appears very rarely as a Spot in the Sun also.</P>
<P>The <HI>Earth</HI> is the next Planet to <HI>Venus</HI>, and has the Moon for its secondary Planet; the common Center of whose Gravity describes an Ellipsis about the Sun in one Year, or 365 Days and a Quarter, nearly; the Eccentricity of its Orbit is 17/1000 of its mean Distance from the Sun, in Surface it contains 200,000.000 of Square Miles, and in Solidity 266.000.000.000 of Cu∣bical Ones, and is in Diameter 7.970 Miles, and is distant from the Sun 81,000.000 Miles. This Annual Motion is perform'd in the Eclip∣tick, and is directed, as is that of all the Pla∣nets, primary and secondary, from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East</HI>, or according to the Order of the Signs, and therefore causes the Sun to have an appa∣rent Annual Motion the same way, and in the
<PB N="17" REF="51"/>
same Plane; but as still in the opposite Point of the Ecliptick. It has also a Diurnal Rotation upon its own Axis from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East</HI> in 24 Hours, and so occasions an apparent Motion of all the Heavenly Bodies from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI> in the same time. The Axis of the Diurnal Mo∣tion is 23 Degrees and one half, oblique to that of the Ecliptick, which occasions the Varieties of <HI>Spring, Summer, Autumn</HI>, and <HI>Winter</HI>. It is in Figure an Oblate Spheroid, as having the Diameter of its Equator about 62 Miles longer than its Axis, on account of the Eleva∣tion of the Equatorial and Depression of the Polar Regions, occasion'd by the centrifugal Force of the Diurnal Motion.</P>
<P><HI>Mars</HI> is still higher in the System, and looks more red and fiery than the rest of the Planets. It takes a larger Circuit than the Earth, and so comes to its Conjunction, Quadratures and Op∣position; and in some degree imitates the Pha∣ses of the Moon, being sometimes only Gib∣bous, tho' it cannot be at all horned like the other. This Planet describes its Ellipsis about the Sun in less than 2 Years, or in 687 Days. The Eccentricity of its Orbit is 93/1000 of its mean Distance from the Sun; it is in Diameter 4444 Miles; in Surface it contains 60,000.000 of square Miles; and in Solidity 44.000,000.000 of Cubical ones; and is distant from the Sun 123,000.000 Miles; it has no secondary Pla∣net that can be seen, but revolves about its own Axis in 24 Hours and 40 Minutes. The Quan∣tity of Light and Heat it enjoys from the Sun is between one half and one third of what the Earth receives from it. It also appears to us upon the Earth to be sometimes Direct, some∣times
<PB N="18" REF="52"/>
Stationary, and sometimes Retrograde in its Course, as all the superior Planets most remarkably do; which Appearances, their high∣er Situation, and slower Angular Motion, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> longer Periods, must necessarily produce, with∣out the least Alteration of their real progressive Motion about the Sun all the while.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI>, the largest of all the Planets, is much higher in the System, and has four Satel∣lites or Moons revolving about it; and all by their common Center of Gravity describe a very great Ellipsis about the Sun. The Eccentricity of its Orbit is 48/1000 of its mean Distance from the Sun. It comes to its Conjunction, Quadratures, and Opposition, as well as <HI>Mars</HI>; but at so great a Distance can never appear other than full, or nearly so. It is in Diameter 81.000 Miles; in Surface it contains 20.000,000.000 of Square Miles, and in Solidity 280,000.000, 000.000 Cubical ones; and revolves about the Sun in eleven Years and ten Months, or 4332 Days and a half, at the Middle Distance of 424,000.000 Miles. It revolves about its own Axis in 9 Hours and 56 Minutes, which make its Figure that of an Oblate Spheroid, ha∣ving the Diameters of its Equator considerably longer than its Axis. The Quantity of Ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Heat it receives from the Sun is but one twenty-seventh Part so great as ours on the Earth. Its Quantity of Matter is about 22<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> times so great as that of the Earth. Its Den∣sity is about one fifth Part of the Earth's, and so the Weight of all Bodies on its Surface is about double to that with us. It is also Direct, Stationary and Retrograde as <HI>Mars</HI>, but not in so great a Degree. It has Belts, like Clouds▪
<PB N="19" REF="53"/>
lying somewhat regularly along the Equatorial Parts, but subject to many Changes and Vari∣ations.</P>
<P><HI>Saturn</HI>, the highest and most remote of all the known Planets, has five Satellites or Moons, and a vast but thin Ring encompassing his Bo∣dy, as an Horizon does a Globe; all which, or rather the common Center of their Gravity, de∣scribes an Ellipsis about the Sun. The Eccen∣tricity of its Orbit is 55/1000 of its mean Distance from the Sun. It comes to its Conjunction, Quadratures and Opposition, as well as the two former, but with no visible Decrease of its Light at its Quadratures, which is scarce to be expected at so great a Distance. It revolves about the Sun in about 29 Years and a half, or about 10.760 Days. It is in Diameter 68.000 Miles; in Surface it contains 14.000,000.000 of Square Miles, and in Solidity 160,000.000,000.000 of Cubical ones, at the mean Distance of 777,000.000 Miles from the Sun. Its Quan∣tity of Matter is about 94 times as great as that of the Earth, tho' its Density be only between a sixth and a seventh Part so great as that of the Earth's; and the Weight of Bodies on its Surface is to that on the Surface of the Earth as about five to four. It is not yet certain∣ly known to revolve about its own Axis, tho' its Ring is said to do so. The Light and Heat communicated to it by the Sun are not quite the ninetieth Part so great, as those bestow'd on the Earth. It is also in some measure Direct, Stationary and Retrograde, as well as the two former Planets, tho' still in a less Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="54"/>Of the <HI>Satellites</HI>, or <HI>secondary Planets</HI>; the most eminent as to us is the <HI>Moon</HI>. It describes an Ellipsis about our Earth (or rather both Earth and Moon describe their own similar Ellipses about the common Center of their Gravity, as is the Case in all such Systems) in a periodi∣cal Month of 27 Days 7 Hours 43 Minutes. The mean Eccentricity of its Orbit is 55/1000 of its mean Distance from the Earth. It makes a Lunation or Synodical Month in 29 Days 12 Hours 44 Minutes. At a Mean it is distant from the Earth about 240,000 Miles, tho' with considerable Difference on account of its great Eccentricity. The Moon's Diameter is 2175 Miles; in Surface it contains 14,000.000 of Square Miles; and in Solidity 5.000,000.000 of Cubical ones. It has between the 39<SUP>th</SUP> and 40<SUP>th</SUP> Part of the Quantity of Matter of the Earth; its Density is to that of the Earth as about 5 to 4, whilst the Weight of all Bodies is but about a third Part so great on its Surface, as on that of the Earth. It revolves from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East</HI> upon its own Axis, exactly in a perio∣dical Month, and thereby turns in general the same Face towards the Earth continually; yet does the Inequality of its Motion, and the Ob∣liquity of its Axis, occasion some unequal <HI>Li∣brations</HI> here also. It has very high Mountains, and very deep regular Valleys, and has lately had an Atmosphere discover'd about it; nor does it seem unlike the Earth as to Sea and Land. It has all Variety of Phases, according to its various Position with respect to the Sun, or according as we on the Earth can see the whole, the half, or only some Part of its en∣lighten'd Hemisphere. Its own Day and Night
<PB N="21" REF="55"/>
are each half a synodical Month, or near 15 of our Days long. Its Orbit is inclin'd to that of the Ecliptick, at the least in an Angle of 5 Degrees; so it but sometimes passes just between the Sun and Earth at the new Moon, and but sometimes falls into the Earth's Conical Shadow at the Full. Yet when it is in, or near the Nodes, or Intersecti∣on of those Planes, it cannot avoid those Accidents; from the former of which the <HI>Solar</HI>, and from the latter of which the <HI>Lunar Eclipses</HI> are deriv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI>'s <HI>four Satellites</HI>, or secondary Planets, are visible with an ordinary Telescope, and sometimes pass like Spots on the Face of <HI>Jupi∣ter</HI>, and sometimes enter into his Shadow; which to an Eye in <HI>Jupiter</HI> would cause Ap∣pearances just like our <HI>Solar</HI> and <HI>Lunar Eclipses</HI>. They revolve about him in Circles, or Ellipses very little Eccentrical; the innermost at 130.000 Miles distance, in 1 Day 18 Hours and a half; the next at 364,000 Miles distance, in 3 Days 13 Hours and a quarter; the third at 580,000 Miles distance in 7 Days 3 ⅔ Hours; the fourth at 1,000.000 Miles distance, in 16 Days 16 ½ Hours. The Cubes of their Distances are also as the Squares of their periodical Times: and so they are kept in their Curvilinear Orbits by their Gravity towards <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Center, in a duplicate reciprocal Proportion of their Di∣stances from it; as is the Case of all the Planets, both Primary and Secondary about the Sun.</P>
<P><HI>Saturn</HI> has <HI>five Satellites</HI>, or secondary Pla∣nets. The fourth in order from <HI>Saturn</HI> is the largest, and was discover'd by the ce∣lebrated <HI>Hugenius</HI>; the third and fifth are visible in the next degree; but the Know∣ledge of the two innermost were first owing
<PB N="22" REF="56"/>
to <HI>Cassini</HI>'s extraordinary Glasses and Diligence. They all revolve in Orbits almost Circular, and are all in or very near the Plane of his Ring, which is inclined in an Angle of 31 degrees to that of the Ecliptick. The innermost revolves about <HI>Saturn</HI> at 146,000 Miles distance, in 1 Day 21 Hours one third; the next at 187.000 Miles in 2 Days 17 Hours, and two thirds; the third at 263,000 Miles, in 4 Days 13 Hours three quarters; the fourth or large one at 600,000 Miles in 15 Days 22 Hours two thirds; the last at 1,800.000 Miles, in 79 Days 22 Hours. Nor is it improbable, that the large Interval between the fourth and fifth may have a sixth, which is yet to us invisible, as <HI>Hugenius</HI> conje∣ctures. As to that strange and unparallel'd Phae∣nomenon of <HI>Saturn</HI>'s <HI>Ring</HI>, which is commonly visible through an ordinary Telescope; its Thickness may well be 500, or perhaps 1000 Miles, tho' it be at that Distance almost invisi∣ble; its Breadth is certainly about 21,000 Miles, and its Distance from the Body of <HI>Saturn</HI> on every Side as much. It causes many different Appearances, not only to us on Earth, but much more to the Inhabitants of <HI>Saturn</HI>, if any such there are; all which <HI>Hugenius</HI> has de∣scrib'd in his System of that Planet, and others from him.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>System</HI> of the <HI>Comets</HI>, it appears now to be very considerable, and indeed they are the most numerous Bodies of the entire <HI>Solar System</HI>. They appear both by their Bigness and Motions to be a sort of Planets revolving about the Sun in Ellipses, so very oblong, that their visible Parts seem in a manner Parabolical; but have such vast Atmospheres about them,
<PB N="23" REF="57"/>
and Tails deriv'd from the same, especially after their <HI>Perihelia</HI>, and those subject to such Mu∣tations, pass thro' so much Cold and Darkness near their <HI>Aphelia</HI>, and so much Light and Heat near their <HI>Perihelia</HI>, as imply them de∣sign'd for very different Purposes from the Pla∣nets; and indeed, as to their outward Parts, in their present State they are plainly uninhabita∣ble. Yet by passing through the Planetary Re∣gions in all Planes and Directions, they fully prove those Spaces to be destitute of Resistance or solid Matter, and seem fit to cause vast Mu∣tations in the Planets, particularly in bringing on them Deluges and Conflagrations, according as the Planets pass through their Atmospheres, in their Descent to, or Ascent from the Sun; and so seem capable of being the Instruments of Di∣vine Vengeance upon the wicked Inhabitants of any of those Worlds; and of burning up, or perhaps, of purging the outward Regions of them in order to a Renovation. This, I mean, seems likely to be their Use in the present State; tho' indeed they do withal seem at present <HI>Chaos</HI>'s or Worlds in Confusion, but capable of a Change to Orbits nearer Circular, and then of settling into a State of Order, and of becoming fit for Habitation like the Planets; but these Conje∣ctures are to be left to farther Enquiry, when it pleases the Divine Providence to afford us more Light about them. However, in my <HI>Solar System</HI> I have describ'd the Orbits of all the Comets that Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> has put into his Catalogue, and that in the Order of their Nearness to the Sun, at their <HI>Perihelia</HI>, and as they are in their proper Planes, without any Reduction to the Ecliptick. They are in Number 21; for tho' he has 24 there set
<PB N="24" REF="58"/>
down, (all which are accordingly number'd there) yet because he scarcely doubts that three of them are the same Comet, and guesses that two more are also the same, in both which Cases I fully agree with him; the real Number will then be but 21. The former of these two (which also seems to have appeared before his Catalogue be∣gins, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1456.) was seen in 1531, 1607, and 1682, whose Period therefore is 75 or 76 Years, and whose Return is to be expect∣ed in 1758. The latter of them appeared <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1532; and probably the same again in 1661, whose Period therefore being about 129 Years, it is to be expected again in 1789. The most eminent of them all appear'd in the 44th Year before the Christian Aera; as also <HI>A. D.</HI> 531, or 532; and <HI>A. D.</HI> 1106; and last∣ly, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680, 1681, when I saw it; and so has made within the Limits of our present Hi∣stories, three periodical Revolutions, in about 575 Years apiece. The middle Distance of the for∣mer from the Sun's Center must be 1458, 000.000 of Miles, and its longer Axis twice so long, and so its <HI>Aphelion</HI> Distance near four times as great as the Distance of <HI>Saturn</HI>; and its greatest Distance to its least as about 60 to 1; and therefore its greatest Light and Heat to its least as about 3600 to 1. The middle Distance of the second must be about 2025,000.000 of Miles, and its longer Axis twice so long, and so its <HI>Aphelion</HI> Distance between 5 and 6 times as great as the Distance of <HI>Saturn</HI>; and its greatest Distance to its least, as more than 100 to 1, and therefore its greatest Light and Heat to its least, as more than ten thousand to one. The middle Distance of the last must be about
<PB N="25" REF="59" MS="y"/>
5.600,000.000. Miles; and its longer Axis twice so long; and so its Aphelion Distance about 14 times as great as the distance of <HI>Sa∣turn</HI>; and its greatest distance to its least as above 20.000 to 1. and so its greatest Light and Heat to its least as above 400,000.000 to 1.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Fixed Stars</HI>, they are vastly remote from this our Planetary and Cometary System, but may perhaps every one be the Center of ano∣ther such like System. Dr. <HI>Hook</HI> and Mr. <HI>Flam∣steed</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discover'd their annual Pa∣rallax, and that it is about 47, which will im∣ply them to be about 700.000.000.000 of Miles distant from the Sun; or, according to an exact Calculation in the like Case, farther than a Bul∣let shot out of a Musket would go in 5000 Years. But of such vast and numberless Systems, if such they are, we know very little: Only so much we know of the Planetary and Cometary Worlds, and of the Probability of vastly more among the Fixed Stars (to say nothing of the noblest or invisible Parts of the Creation, nor of the par∣ticular Phaenomena here below) as is sufficient to make us cry out with the <HI>Psalmist, O Lord, how manifold are thy Works! In Wisdom hast thou made them all!</HI> Psal. civ. 24.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. The Truth of the foregoing <HI>SYSTEM</HI> briefly <HI>Demonstrated</HI>.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N order to let the Reader see the Certainty of our present System of Astronomy, and to prepare the way for his entire Satisfaction, as to the noble Inferences that shall hereafter be drawn from the same, I shall now attempt, not only to prove the foregoing Sy∣stem, in all its Parts, to be very <HI>probable</HI>, and so preferable to any other Hypothesis; but to <HI>Demonstrate</HI> it to be <HI>really true and certain</HI>; and this after so familiar a manner, that ordi∣nary Mathematicians may easily apprehend the Force of each Argument, and see the Evidence for the several Conclusions all along. Now the Propositions I shall here Demonstrate are these:</P>
<P N="1">I. That the <HI>Diurnal Motion</HI>, or that which occasions the Succession of Day and Night, and the apparent rising and setting of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, in the space of 24 Hours, which we
<PB N="27" REF="61"/>
call a <HI>Day</HI>, belongs to the Earth, and not to the Heavens.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the <HI>Annual Motion</HI>, or that which occasions the Succession of Summer and Winter, and the apparent Motion of the Sun through the Ecliptick in the Space of 365 ¼ Days, which we call a <HI>Year</HI>, belongs to the Earth, and not to the Sun.</P>
<P N="3">III. That there is an Universal <HI>Power of Gra∣vity</HI> acting in the whole System; whereby every Body, and part of a Body, Attracts, and is Attracted by every other Body and part of a Body through the whole System; that this Power of Gravity is greater in greater Bodies, and lesser in lesser; and this in the exact pro∣portion of such their Magnitude: That it is also greater when the Bodies are nearer, and lesser when they are farther off; and this in the ex∣act duplicate proportion of such their nearness: That this Power is the same in all Places, and at all Times, and to all Bodies: And that, lastly, this Power is entirely Immechanical, or beyond the Power of all material Agents whatsoever.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the <HI>Orbits, Revolutions, Distances, Quantities of Matter, Densities, Gravity on the Surfaces, Revolutions about their Axes, Quanti∣ties of Light and Heat</HI>, &amp;c. above set down, concerning the Sun and Planets, both Primary and Secondary, with those of the Comets also, are true and certain; with an Account of the Ways whereby we discover every one of those Particulars.</P>

<P>The <HI>Diurnal Motion</HI>, or that which occasions the Revolution of Day and Night, and the ap∣parent rising and setting of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, in the Space of 24 Hours, which we call a <HI>Day</HI>, belongs to the Earth, and not to the Heavens.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>DEMONSTRATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) All the Phaenomena or Appearances rela∣ting to this Matter, are now certainly known to be equally natural and necessary Consequences of a diurnal Revolution of the Earth from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East</HI>, as of the like Revolution of the whole System of the Heavens from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI>; as those who have apply'd themselves to this part of Astronomy do well know: Just as it is equal to a Person that desires to see quite round a Terrestrial Globe, set in a proper Position; whether he walks himself round that Globe, while it stands still; or whether the several parts of that Globe be turned round to him, while he stands still: Which if it be granted; and the Vastness of the System about us be consider'd, with respect to the Smallness of our Earth; the immense swiftness necessary in one case, com∣par'd with the greater slowness in the other; the prodigious diversity of perplex'd Motions in the Sun, the Planets, the Comets, and the fix'd Stars to be provided for in the former Hypo∣thesis, with the easy simple Motion of one Globe about its own Axis to be allow'd in the latter; the disproportion, as to the probability of the
<PB N="29" REF="63"/>
one and the other Notion, will appear vastly great and prodigious. Whether it is more fit and reasonable for 100 Auditors, in a Course of Geography, to have a terrestrial Globe turned once round on its own Axis, in order to their distinct and gradual view of the particular Countries thereon describ'd; or to have Car∣penters set to work to remove the Room, and the House it self, and to carry it on Wheels in order to avoid that single Circumvolution? When once we are satisfyed of the Justness of such a procedure in one Case, we may begin to think of allowing the like Justness in the other; but not sooner.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There are no mechanical Laws of Moti∣on known in the World, which can account for such a Diurnal Revolution of the Heavens; nay, it is directly contrary to all such known Laws whatsoever. 'Tis true, a Clock or Machine may have several distinct Motions within, and yet a Spectator may turn the whole round on its Axis at the same time; because all the Parts and Wheels are connected together, and take hold of each other, by material contact and inser∣tion: So that he who removes one part, does of necessity remove all the rest. But this is far from the real Case in the World about us; where the several Bodies are vastly remote from, and unconnected with each other; and where there∣fore no such (imaginary) Revolution of any (fictitious) <HI>Primum Mobile</HI>, or material external Sphere can affect or move the several Bodies therein contain'd. When once we see the Revo∣lution of a large Wheel make other inward Wheels, which it does not touch, dance atten∣dance thereto, and commence circular Revolu∣tions
<PB N="30" REF="64"/>
round its Axis, we may begin to think o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such a parallel Notion as to the present System, but not sooner.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) There is no Example of such Periodica<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Revolutions, which carry different and seperate Bodies round the same Axis, in the same time, in the whole World about us. No Vortices o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Whirlpools excited in Fluids do so: None o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Primary Planets are carried so about t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Sun, nor Secondary ones about their Primaries Nor indeed is the thing possible in any mecha∣nical Method whatsover, agreeing to the pre∣sent System of things, that we know of. So that 'tis meerly an Hypothesis or Romance, un∣supported by all good Evidence, and deriv'd entirely from the Prejudices and Notions of the Vulgar, before they are acquainted with the Principles necessary to make them competent Judges in such Matters.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The frequent, if not constant, Diurnal Revolutions of the rest of the Heavenly Bodies, renders it most highly rational, if not necessary, to allow the like Revolution to our Earth. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we cast our Eyes abroad, and use Telescopes to assist them, we shall find that <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> among the higher Planets; that <HI>Venus</HI> among the lower; that the Moon in our Neighbour∣hood; and that the Sun it self in the Center of these Planetary Motions, have, for certain, such a diurnal Revolution about their own Axes. Nor is it any way certain, that either <HI>Saturn</HI>, or <HI>Mercury</HI>, the secondary Planets, the Comets, or fixed Stars, <HI>i. e.</HI> that any of the Heavenly Bodies are destitute of such a Motion. So that hence it is exceeding probable that our Earth may have the like Motion also.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="31" REF="65"/>(5.) The contrary Hypothesis introduces the utmost Confusion into the apparent Heavenly Motions, while 'tis certain there is no manner of reason for doing so. For what strange Con∣fusion is it to imagine, that while in <HI>Venus</HI>, in the <HI>Moon</HI>, in <HI>Mars</HI>, and in <HI>Jupiter</HI>, if not in all the other Planets and heavenly Bodies be∣sides, there is such a diurnal Rotation, as seve∣rally produces a regular succession of Day and Night in them, according to the several natural Periods of those Revolutions; and while we cannot deny that the like diurnal Revolution of the Earth, would regularly produce a corre∣spondent regular Succession of Day and Night in 24 Hours with us, without the introduction of any farther Motions of the Heavens for this purpose; what Confusion, I say, is it after all this, for us to introduce a strange, a violent, an unexampled, an unphilosophical Circumgu∣ration of the whole vast Universe about our poor Earth, every Day, to the disorder and perplexity of those other diurnal Appearances, and of the whole System? and all this with∣out any just occasion in the World? If we were but for a while translated to <HI>Jupiter</HI>, which we know to have the quickest diurnal Revolution of all the rest, and observ'd how regular the rising and setting of the Sun, Moon, and Stars ap∣pear'd therein from that diurnal Motion alone, I dare say we should never after that so much as dream of any other than a diurnal Motion of our Earth, to account for the like rising and setting of the same Sun, Moon, and Stars with us here upon Earth.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) In Fact, our Earth certainly has such a diurnal Revolution about its own Axis, as we
<PB N="32" REF="66"/>
are now speaking of: For though we do not stand conveniently enough to <HI>see</HI> the diurnal Revolution as to our own Earth, which we do as to the other Heavenly Bodies; yet are we capable of certainly knowing by one grand Ef∣fect of such a Motion, whether our Earth has that Motion or not? All Globes which have no diurnal Revolutions about their own Axes, must, by the Equality of the weight of Bodies in all their Regions, be perfect <HI>Spheres</HI>; and all the Parts of their Surface must, generally speaking, be at the same distance from the Center. But all Globes that have such a diurnal Rotation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Sir</HI> I∣saac New∣ton<HI>'s Prin∣cip.</HI> 2<HI>d. Edit.</HI> p. 337, 338. <HI>and</HI> p. 437, 438.</NOTE> (which will necessarily be swiftest at the Equa∣tor; and by consequence will cause the Parts to recede from the Axis of Motion, chiefly near the Equator) will be <HI>Oblate Sphaeroids</HI>, or higher in the Equatoreal, and lower in the Polar Regi∣ons, as has been already observ'd. Now to this certain <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> do we appeal for the determi∣nation of this matter. For since it appears from the lesser length of the Pendulum which vibrates Seconds near the Equator, than near the Pole, that the Surface of the Earth is about 31 Miles higher at the Equator, than at the Poles; and since the regress of the Earth's Nodes, which we call the precession of the Equinox, with the Equilibration of the Waters near the Equator, and near the Poles, do both fully con∣firm the same thing; all which are the necessa∣ry Effects of the Earth's diurnal Rotation, and are accountable on no other Principles whatso∣ever; I conclude, that our Earth has such a diurnal Rotation; or, which is the same thing, that the diurnal Revolution belongs to the Earth, and not to the Heavens.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="67"/><HI>N. B.</HI> I propose the Five first as Arguments exceeding probable; but this last as a really certain Demonstration.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROP.</HI> II.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Annual Motion</HI>, or that which occasions the Succession of Summer and Winter, and the apparent Motion of the Sun through the Eclip∣tick, in the Space of 365 ¼ Days, which we call a <HI>Year</HI>, belongs to the Earth, and not to the Sun.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>DEMONSTRATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) All the Phaenomena or Appearances re∣lating to this Matter, are now certainly known to be equally natural and necessary Consequen∣ces of an Annual Revolution of the Earth, as of the Sun; as all Astronomers confess. And he who considers the prodigious Greatness of the Sun's Body, and the comparative Smallness of the Earth, will be under no Temptation to suppose that the vast Sun revolves round this little Earth, especially when he reflects, that all things will be the very same, if this little Earth be suppos'd to revolve about that vast Sun in the same time.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There are no known Laws of Motion according to which so great a Body as the Sun can revolve about so small a Body as the Earth; nay, this is directly contrary to all such known Laws whatsoever. For let the Occasion or In∣fluence derived from these two Bodies be of what sort you please, either Gravitation, or Magnetism, or Impulse, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> still the greater
<PB N="34" REF="68"/>
Body, as in all like Cases, must have the great∣est Force and Efficacy to move the other. And we may full as well expect that a Sling, con∣taining a Milstone in it, may be fasten'd to a Pebble, and continue its Motion about that Peb∣ble, without removing it, as that the Sun can revolve about our Earth, while the Earth con∣tinues immoveable in the Center of that Mo∣tion.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) There is no Instance of such a thing in the visible World, as a great Body thus revolving about a small one, that continues it self im∣moveable all the while; but all the Instances are on the other side. The smaller Moon re∣volves about the larger Earth; the smaller Cir∣cumjovials and Circumsaturnals revolve about the larger <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn; Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus</HI>, and <HI>Mercury</HI>, revolve all, not about the smaller Earth, but about the larger Sun; as is now confess'd by the whole Astro∣nomical World; and as is certainly demonstra∣ted by the Phases of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> seen through a Telescope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> And tho' in a strict Sense all these larger Bodies may be so far said to re∣volve about those smaller, as they may still, on both sides, revolve about the common Center of Gravity; yet because the common Center of Gravity of the Sun and Earth must be so very near the Center of the Sun, and so very far from the Center of the Earth; and by con∣sequence, the Motion of the Sun, if compar'd with that of the Earth about it, must be so ve∣ry insensible; it follows, that the most sensible Annual Motion, of which we are now speak∣ing, must still, by all parallel Instances, belong to the Earth, and not to the Sun.</P>

<P><HI>These are the three Famous Systems of Astronomy.

<P><HI>I Senex sculpt</HI></P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="35" REF="70" MS="y"/>(4.) The Hypothesis that this Annual Motion belongs to the Sun, and not to the Earth, in∣troduces the utmost Confusion among the Ce∣lestial Motions, and that without any proper occasion in the World. For what strange con∣fusion is it for us to imagine that the single Earth, which is now confess'd by all to be situate between <HI>Mars</HI> above, and <HI>Venus</HI> below it; while all the rest of the Planets, <HI>Saturn</HI> with his <HI>Satellites, Jupiter</HI> with his, and <HI>Mars, Ve∣nus</HI>, and <HI>Mercury</HI>, without any, do all revolve not about the Earth, but about the Sun; nay that the Superior revolve about it in longer, and the Inferior in shorter Periods or Years, while the Annual Period, is in a mean between them; that I say the single Earth be exempted from the common Law of the whole System? What a heap of Absurdities are here? That while all the rest of the Planetary World re∣volve about the Sun, in their several regular Periods or Years, that yet our Earth, contrary to all Probability, should be suppos'd to carry not the Sun only, but all the Solar System also round it self in a Year's time, as it certainly must, if the Annual Motion belong to the Sun?<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>II.</HI></NOTE> This Hypothesis of the famous <HI>Tycho</HI>, which is the only one that is not absolutely impossible to be true, is yet so wild, groundless, and ex∣travagant in it self, and so prodigiously impro∣bable, that I should exceedingly wonder at its first Introduction, and much more at its Ad∣mission still in <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Countries, did I not know that Injudicious Persons have inter∣preted Scripture against the true System; and that an <HI>Infallible Church</HI> has Establish'd that In∣terpretation; nay, has condemn'd the true one
<PB N="36" REF="71"/>
as Heresy; and that, by Consequence, the Po∣pish Astronomers have been driven into this terrible Dilemma, of either submitting to the Absurdities of the <HI>Tychonian</HI>, or else of resign∣ing themselves up to Imprisonment, if not to Death it self for the true or <HI>Copernican Hypothesis</HI>; So dangerous is it, in that Church at least, if not in some others, to admit of Truth not only in Divine, but even in Natural and Astronomi∣cal Matters also!</P>
<P N="5">(5.) There is one known fixed Proportion be∣tween the Periods and Distances of all the Hea∣venly Bodies from the Sun; I mean that the Squares of the Periods, are ever as the Cubes of the Distances; and this Proportion is so uni∣versal, that it obtains not only in this general System of the Primary Planets about the Sun, but in the particular Systems of the Secondary Planets about their Primaries, without the least Exception that we know of in the universe; Which Proportion demonstrates, that the Annual Revolution belongs to the Earth, and not to the Sun. For as the Cube of the Moon's distance, which is 240,000 Miles, to the Cube of the Sun's di∣stance, which is 81,000.000 Miles, <HI>i. e.</HI> as 1 to 38,272.753, so is the Square of the Moon's Pe∣riod, or of less than 28 Days, which is about 784, to the Squre of the Period of any Body moving about the Earth at the Sun's distance in Days, or to 30,005.838,352, whose Square Root, or 173,510 are therefore the Number of Days of the Solar Year, in case the Sun revolves about the Earth; which yet in reality are known to be but 365 ¼. Now this last Number is con∣tain'd no less than 475 Times in the former. So that if the Sun revolv'd about the Earth, from

that Analogy and Harmony which is every where else observed in the Heavens, the Year must be 475 Times as long as it now is. This Calcula∣tion seems to me to determine this Dispute in favour of the <HI>Copernican</HI> System; according to which, the Proportion above-mentioned of the Cubes of the Distances, as the Squares of the Periodick Times, is known to agree to all the Planets, to the utmost exactness of Astrono∣mical Observations.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) In Fact, the Earth has such an Annual Re∣volution about the Sun; as appears by all the Indications of such a Motion possible: even by that of Parallax; which is the known Geome∣trical Foundation of the Science of Astronomy. Thus if the Earth have an Annual Revolution about the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>III.</HI></NOTE> it must affect the apparent Mo∣tions of all the other Planets and Comets, and, notwithstanding the Regularity of their several Motions in their own Orbits, must render the regular Motions, as to us, living upon the mo∣ving Earth, sometimes Direct, and that swiftly or slowly; sometimes Stationary, and sometimes Retrograde, and that swiftly or slowly also; and all this at such certain Periods, in such cer∣tain Places, for such certain Durations, and ac∣cording to such certain Circumstances, as Geo∣metry and Arithmetick will exactly determine, and not otherwise. Now that this is the real Case in Fact; and that every one of these Par∣ticulars are true in the Astronomical World, all that are skilful in that Science do freely confess; even those who, for Reasons already hinted at, do not think fit to declare openly for this An∣nual Revolution of the Earth, which is the na∣tural, the certain Consequent of that Concession.
<PB N="38" REF="74"/>
'Tis true, such Persons may pretend, that tho' these Phaenomena be undoubted; and would be the undoubted Effects of such a Motion; yet that this Annual Revolution is not the undenia∣ble, the strictly Geometrical Consequence of them; that they <HI>may possibly</HI> be accounted for on other Hypotheses, and that on the Supposition of certain complex Motions, deriv'd from (ima∣ginary) Epicycles, and Eccentricks, and solid Orbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they may be solved without the in∣troduction of this Annual Motion of the Earth. Now this I do not absolutely deny, that if such precarious, aukward, immechanical, false, and absurd Figments, were the true and real Laws of Nature, these Phaenomena <HI>might</HI> possibly be otherwise accounted for: But then I affirm, that such Hypotheses are indeed not at all the real Laws of Nature, but no better than meer precarious, aukward, immechanical, false, and absurd Figments only; such indeed, as if they were allow'd in other Cases, would take away all Certainty in all mix'd Mathematicks at least, if not in Arithmetick and Geometry themselves; and would enable Men to evade the grand Foun∣dation of Astronomy, I mean that of the com∣mon Parallax it self; These Phaenomena being as truly Instances of an Annual, as other known ones are of the Diurnal Parallax. I believe the skilful Astronomers will know my meaning by this general intimation; but if not, I will easily undertake to demonstrate, that those who, not∣withstanding these Indications, or Demonstrati∣ons, do deny or doubt of the Earth's Annual Motion, may, in Consequence thereof, become Astronomical Scepticks, and deny, or doubt of almost all the other Principles of Astronomy,
<PB N="39" REF="75" MS="y"/>
and of Human Knowledge, which are never past the Evasions of resolved Scepticks. But I need not here enlarge, because I am well assur'd that all Astronomers, who are compleat Masters of that Science, as soon as other Prejudices and Fears are over, will agree with me, that the Arguments under this Head, when allow'd their free and full Weight, do certainly prove that this Annual Revolution belongs to the Earth, and not to the Sun. I do not here mention that Annual Parallax of the <HI>Fixed Stars</HI>, which Dr. <HI>Hook</HI> and Mr. <HI>Flamsteed</HI> think they have discovered, which would certainly <HI>demonstrate</HI> the Earth's Annual Motion, and which I have elsewhere vindicated from the Objections of Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI>, and of the <HI>French</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Astron.

<P N="1">(1.) There is an universal <HI>Power of Gravity</HI> acting in the whole System; whereby every Bo∣dy, and part of a Body, Attracts and is Attract∣ed by every other Body and part of a Body, through the whole System.

It is also greater when the Bodies are nearer, and lesser when they are farther off, and that in the exact duplicate pro∣portion of such their nearness. (4.)

<HEAD><HI>Demonstration</HI> of the <HI>first Part;</HI> That there is such a Power of <HI>Gravity</HI> in the Universe.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) Because all the Planets, Primary and Se∣condary, with the Comets, are perpetually drawn from their natural Rectilinear Courses along strait Lines, the Tangents of their present Orbits, and made to revolve in Curves; there is therefore a continual Power or Force acting upon them; and because the Power or Force acts so upon them, as to cause the Bodies to move just so much quicker, as they are nearer their Central Bodies; and just so much slower, as they are farther off them; and thereby to oblige them by a Line drawn from the Cen∣tral
<PB N="41" REF="77"/>
Bodies ever to describe equal Area's in equal Times; it therefore follows, by Geome∣trick Demonstration,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math.

<P N="2">(2.) This Power or Force is properly the Power or Force of <HI>Gravity</HI>, or the very same which causes Stones and all heavy Bodies with us to <HI>gravitate</HI>, and thereby to descend down∣ward towards the Earth's Center; because upon exact Geometrick Deduction, and Arithmetick Calculation it appears, that the Force which retains the Moon in its Orbit, tends to the same Center, and is exactly of the same Quan∣tity with that, which accelerates heavy Bodies with us on the Earth's Surface; due Allowance being made for the Difference of their Distan∣ces from the Earth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math.

each Part of the same; which indeed is the only rational Conception of this Matter; be∣cause otherwise this Force must respect not a Body, which is somewhat real, but a Mathema∣tical Point, which, physically speaking, is no∣thing at all.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) In Fact, the greatest Bodies have the greatest Gravity towards them through the whole Universe. Thus by Calculation from the Heavenly Motions it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math.

Nor do I omit the other Planets and the Comets here, as if the Case were not the same in them also; but because they have no Planets, that we know of, mo∣ving about them; and because they occasion no sensible Tides in our Ocean; which are the only Phaenomena, whence we can draw any certain Indications of the Quantity of that Power of Gravity which tends to them.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="79"/>
of the several Secondary Ones about their Pri∣maries, are still found to bear accurately the same Proportion to each other, which the Squares of their respective Periodical Times of Revolving also bear; it follows,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 13.</NOTE> by strict Geo∣metrick Reasoning, that the Centripetal Force, which keeps them in their several Curves, is accurately in the duplicate Proportion of their Nearness to their Central Bodies.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Because all the primary Planets and Co∣mets revolve about the <HI>Sun</HI>, and all the secon∣dary Ones, that are Eccentrical, about their Pri∣maries in Ellipses, or Conick Sections, and that about the <HI>Sun</HI>, or their Primaries, situate in their <HI>Foci</HI>; it follows, by strict Geometrick Rea∣soning, that the Centripetal Force,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 21.</NOTE> which re∣tains them in such Conick Sections, is exactly in the duplicate Proportion of their nearness to their Central Bodies.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Because the <HI>Aphelia</HI>, or longer Axes of these Ellipses do rest, as to the fixed Stars, in the primary Planets and Comets; and in the secondary Ones, do move only in proportion to the disturbance they necessarily meet with from the Inequality of their Distances from the <HI>Sun</HI>, it follows from Mathematick Reasoning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 33.</NOTE> that the Centripetal Force, which acts upon those Planets and Comets, is most accurately in the duplicate Proportion of their Nearness to their Central Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> That there appears no manner of Ne∣cessity for this Proportion of Increase and Di∣minution of the Power of Gravity, as the Squares of the Nearness of Bodies, more than for any other Proportion; as suppose that of
<PB N="44" REF="80"/>
the Nearness it self, or that of the Cubes, or Bi∣quadrates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that Nearness or Distance. Yet would any other Proportion have been exceed∣ing inconvenient for this System. For if it had been as the Nearness it self, we have no regular Curve Line, in which the Eccentrical Planets or Comets could then revolve: If in a Triplicate such Bodies must ever have descended, or as∣cended in Spiral Lines, till they fell into the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 20.</NOTE> or some Fixed Star, and perished therein. And if the Proportion had been still greater, the Effect would have been quicker also.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>Demonstration</HI> of the <HI>Fourth Part;</HI> that this Gravity is the same in all Places, and at all Times, and with regard to all Bodies whatso∣ever.</HEAD>
<P>This is plain from Fact and Observation; for (1.) Heavy Bodies fall as fast in one Country as in another; and Gravity affects the Planets and Comets in its proper Proportion, equally in all the Parts of the Universe where Planets or Co∣mets go, <HI>i. e.</HI> in all the immense Regions of it every Way.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Planets and Comets, guided by this Law, have invariably preserv'd their Motions, Orbits, Periods, and Influences, since the first Ages of Astronomy and Chronology: And,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) This Gravity does still, upon Tryal, equally affect Fluids and Solids; Bodies in Mo∣tion and at Rest; Great and Small; and this through the whole Universe also, so far as we can examine it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="45" REF="81"/>
<HEAD><HI>Demonstration</HI> of the <HI>Fifth Part;</HI> that this Gravity is an entirely immechanical Power, and beyond the Abilities of all material Agents whatsoever.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) This Power acts upon the very inward substantial Parts of Bodies, as well as the out∣ward and visible;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 82.</NOTE> and is proportionable not to the Surface but to the solid Content, or Quan∣tity of Matter contained in them: Whereas, all Mechanical Causes are meerly superficial, and act by External Contact on the External Surface only.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) This Power acts upon Bodies equally, when they are in the most violent Motion, and when they are at Rest; as the Celerity of De∣scending Bodies with us;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 3.</NOTE> and the Celerity of the Comets in the Heavens, Geometrically com∣puted, do particularly shew. Now this is ab∣solutely impossible; that any Mechanical Pres∣sure, or Impulse from a Body, let its Motion be never so swift, or its Pressure never so strong, should equally accelerate another Body, when at Rest, and when in Motion;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. Law of Motion 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> it being a known Law of Mechanism, that a Body in Motion impels another at Rest with its whole Force; but one in Motion, with only the Excess of its own Velocity above the others; as is most ob∣vious also on the least Reflexion.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) By this Power Bodies act upon other Bodies <HI>at a Distance</HI>, nay at all Distances what∣soever; that is, they <HI>act where they are not:</HI> Which is not only impossible for Bodies Mecha∣nically
<PB N="46" REF="82"/>
to do, but indeed is impossible for all Beings whatsoever to do, either Mechanically or Immechanically, it being just as good Sense to say, an Agent can act <HI>when</HI> he is not in Be∣ing, as <HI>where</HI> he is not present. Whence, by the way, as we shall see hereafter, it will ap∣pear, that this Power of Gravity is not only Immechanical, or does not arise from Corpore∣al Contract or Impulse, but is not, strictly speak∣ing, any Power belonging to Body or Matter at all; tho' for ease of Conception and Calcula∣tion we usually so speak; but is a Power of a superior Agent, ever moving all Bodies after such a manner, as if every Body did Attract, and were Attracted by every other Body in the Universe, and no otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Altho' I here do only insist in particu∣lar on the wonderful Power of Gravity, which is the general or universal Power of the entire System; and which is the best known, the most easily proved, and is indeed the most evi∣dently Immechanical; yet do not I exclude those other Noble and Immechanical Powers of Refraction in pellucid Bodies; of mutual Re∣pulse in the Particles of the Air, which render it Elastical; of the Cohesion of Parts in con∣sistent Bodies, and of another Kind of Attra∣ction in homogenial, and of Repulse in hete∣rogeneous Fluids, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on which the particular Phaenomena of Nature do now appear to de∣pend; but shall upon Occasion make use of them sometimes in what follows.</P>

<P>The Orbits, Revolutions, Distances, Diame∣ters, Quantities of Matter, Densities, Gravity on the Surfaces, Revolutions about their Axes, Quantities of Light and Heat, above set down, concerning the Sun and Planets, both primary and secondary, with those of the Comets also, are True and Certain. With an Account of the Ways whereby we discover all those Parti∣culars.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Demonstration of the several Particulars.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) That the <HI>Orbits</HI> of all the primary Pla∣nets are, as above stated, <HI>Elliptical</HI>, was first dis∣covered, and prov'd with the utmost Labour and Industry, from <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Observations, by the famous <HI>Kepler</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Moti∣bus Stellae Martis.</NOTE> particularly as to the Planet <HI>Mars</HI>; and is now discover'd by the great Ex∣actness of all the Planets Places, and apparent Diameters, when calculated in such Orbits, and compared with the best Observations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>IV.</HI></NOTE> Nor was the old Hypothesis of the <HI>Eccentrick Cireu∣lar Orbits</HI>, other than an Approximation to the true <HI>System</HI>; especially when the Astronomers came to observe, that their Circular Eccentrici∣ty would not agree to Observation, without its <HI>Bisection</HI>, as it was call'd; <HI>i. e.</HI> without suppo∣sing the Point of even equable Motion to be as far <HI>beyond</HI>, as the Eccentrical Point was on <HI>this side</HI> the Center of the Circle, which was al∣most the same Thing with owning such Orbits to be Elliptical, and having the Sun in the Infe∣rior,
<PB N="48" REF="84" MS="y"/>
and the Point of even Motion in or very near the superior Focus; which is the State of those Orbits in our present Astronomy. And the Case will be the same as to the Orbits of the Secondary Ones about their Primaries, where∣ever their Eccentricity can be discover'd. Nor is the State of the Comets to be excepted from this Rule: For tho' We now generally use Pa∣rabolick instead of Elliptick Orbits in the Com∣putation of the Comets Motions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. of Comets, <HI>Pag.</HI> 381, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> yet is this only for that small part of their Course which we can see, and for the ease of Calculation; while we are satisfy'd from their Appearances, that they really move in very Oblong Ellipses, (or such as approach to Parabola's,) about the Sun in their lower <HI>Foci</HI>, as do the Planets; that accordingly they have their proper Periods, in which they revolve quite round, and return to the Sun again; four of which Periods are now discover'd; and that if we compute them in Ellip∣ses, instead of Parabola's, where-ever the Spe∣cies of those Ellipses are known, we should find our Calculations still more exactly to agree with our Observations, as is already the Case as to the Comet 1680/1.</P>

Thus, for Instance, we first know, by gross Observa∣tion, that the Moon is above 27 Days in re∣volving round us, from any fixed Star to the same again; we then compare several Months at once, and find that in 12 Months one with another, the Moon is almost eight Hours above 27 Days in such a Revolution.

<P>These Distances, as to their Proportion, are well known from plain Trigonometry; I mean, by the utmost Elongation of the Inferiors; where in a Rectanglar Triangle, joining the Eye, the Center of the Sun, and the Center of the Planet, two of the Sides bear this Proportion to each other: And by the Angle of Retrogradation thereto equivalent, in the Superiors; for 'tis but imagining your Eye, transferr'd to the Su∣perior Planet, and the Earth is an Inferior one with respect to the Eye, and the Proportion as before is given; as also by the Position of <HI>Ju∣piter</HI>'s Shadow in the Eclipses of its <HI>Satellits</HI>, where the Middle of the Eclipse gives the Po∣sition of the Central Shadow of <HI>Jupiter</HI> from the Sun; and our Instruments give the Position hence: So that we have all the Angles in a plain Triangle made by the Center of the Sun, the Center of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Shadow, and the Eye, which gives the Proportion of the Sides, or of the Distances; and by the Proportion of the Periodick Times, compar'd with the mean Di∣stances in the Comets, all which Methods agree together in the present Case. And as to the Di∣stances in Miles themselves, they are derived from the best Observations of the Parallax of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI>, by Mr. <HI>Flamsteed, Cassini</HI>, and others, which give us that of the Sun about 10", and which is followed by Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI> in the second Edition of his <HI>Principia</HI>. On∣ly we may Note, that this Parallax cannot be
<PB N="53" REF="90" MS="y"/>
much larger, because that would easily be dis∣cover'd by our Instruments, but may be a little less, because that is more difficult to be found out. So that it is more probable that these Di∣stances are somewhat too little, than that they are at all too great. But as to such farther Ex∣actness, it must be left to the nicest Observati∣ons of Posterity.

The Reason is plain, that the real Bigness of the Earth, and of our Neigh∣bour the Moon, are easily discover'd, and mea∣sur'd by the Rules of Astronomers; but that the rest are so vastly remote from us, that our nicest Instruments cannot yet perfectly define the <HI>Distances</HI> of any of them; and so by Con∣sequence cannot perfectly determine their real <HI>Diameters</HI>, which depend thereon. Only so far I may, as before, venture to conjecture, that the real Distances and Diameters are rather larger than smaller than those here set down; because if the Distances, and so the Diameters, were much less, they would be certainly discover'd by our Instruments; whereas if they be suppos'd considerably greater, it must be still harder to discover those Distances and Diameters by the same Instruments.</P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Huygens</HI>'s Numbers of the appa∣rent Diameters, are considerably different from those of Mr. <HI>Flamsteed</HI>. And I do suppose still, what I once propos'd to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Der∣ham</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 11, 12.</NOTE> and which he approves of in his Astro∣theology, that the middle Number between Mr. <HI>Flamsteed</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Huygens</HI> may be the truest: Yet do I, in all my Calculations here, follow those of Mr. <HI>Flamsteed</HI>; because Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has done so, even in the last

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> If we sum up the last Quantity of Mat∣ter for the Sun and Planets in the Solar System together; and add to it, for the Comets, another Quantity equal to that of all the Planets; and, allowing nothing for the interspers'd Vacuities, which yet are much the greater Part, compare the whole with the Cubical Content of this System upon the Foot of Mr. <HI>Flamsteed</HI>'s Parallax of the fixed Stars, we shall find that the Quantity of the Matter is about 231,000 000,000.000, 000 Cubical Miles; and that a Cube of the Diameter of the System, which I esteem equivalent there∣to, is near 3,000.000,000.000,000.000,000,000 000.000.000.000 of the same Miles, <HI>i. e.</HI> it will appear that this Quantity of Matter is little more than the 12,000.000,000.000,000.000th Part of the empty Space; or in other Words, that a small Pin-head bears a much greater Proportion to a Cubical Mile, than all the Matter in this System bears to the empty Space therein con∣tain'd.</P>

<P><PB N="58" REF="95" MS="y"/>These Numbers are agreeable to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s last Calculations, and belong only to such of the Heavenly Bodies as have Planets about them, or which influence our Tides; from the Quantity of which Effects alone we can col∣lect the Quantity of the Causes, or of the Mat∣ter in each Body. The way of discovering this Quantity is easy, from what has been already proved, that the universal Power of Gravitation is in proportion always to the Quantity of Mat∣ter in each attracting Body. For if from the constant Equality of Proportion there is be∣tween the Cubes of the Distances and the Squares of the Periods, we, by the Rule of Three, re∣duce the several Systems of the Planets to any one Distance from their Central Bodies, and there Geometrically compute the Proportion of the Centripetal Power to each Central Body, which in that Case is directly proportional to the Square of the Velocity of the Planet, we shall have the Quantity of the Force of Gravity towards every one of them; and, by Conse∣quence, the Quantity of that Matter which oc∣casions the same, and is proportionable thereto. Fot Example; Let us reduce the Distance of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s innermost Planet from <HI>Jupiter</HI>, to the same Distance as the Earth has from the Sun; and observe the Difference of their Preiods or Velocities in those equal Circles, by this Rule; As the Cube of the <HI>Satellits</HI> real Distance 230.000 = 12.167,000.000,000.000, to the Cube of its imaginary Distance 81,000.000=531.441, 000.000,000.000,000.000; so is the Square of its real Period in Minutes 2548, at its present Di∣stance from <HI>Jupiter</HI> 6492304, to 28357660311 2024 the Square of its imaginary Period at the
<PB N="59" REF="96"/>
same Distance from it, as the Earth has from the Sun; whose Square Root therefore 16,839.733 is the Period of that <HI>Satellit</HI> there in Minutes. Now as the Squares of these Periods recipro∣cally, which is as the Squares of their Velocities directly, <HI>i. e.</HI> as 276643388961 to 283586607 511289, or as 220 to 227500 nearly, so are their Attractions towards their respective Central Bo∣dies, and so are the Quantities of Matter in those Central Bodies; which was to be demonstrated: and so for the rest. By this Method we know the <HI>Sun</HI>'s, <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s, <HI>Saturn</HI>'s, and the <HI>Earth</HI>'s, Quantity of Matter. As for the <HI>Moon</HI>, this Me∣thod cannot reach it; because there are no Planets revolving about it. But then the Tides in our Ocean, arising from the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI>'s Influences, or the Water's Gravitation towards them; and the Spring Tides being the Effect of the <HI>Sum</HI> of their Forces, when they are united; while the Nepe Tides are owing to the <HI>Diffe∣rence</HI> between them when they are opposite; we gather from the Observation, made of those Spring and Nepe Tides, what the Proportion of their Powers is at their different Distances; whence we compute what it would be at equal Distances; <HI>i. e.</HI> what Proportion there is be∣tween the Quantity of their Matter respectively. Thus for Example; the highest Elevation of the Tide by the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI>, at the Conjun∣ction and Opposition, is to its Elevation by the prevalence of the Moon over the Sun after the Quadratures, by the best Observations, as 5 ½ to 3 ½. Whence it follows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Sir <HI>I∣saac New∣ton</HI>'s Prin∣cip. <HI>2</HI>d Edit. pag. <HI>426,-430.</HI></NOTE> that the Moon's Force is to the Sun's as 4 ½ to 1. For half the Sum of any two Quantities, added to half their difference giving the larger, and substracted from it gi∣ving
<PB N="60" REF="97"/>
the smaller, as any one may easily try, it follows from the proportion of the <HI>Sum</HI>, to the <HI>Difference</HI> above stated, 5 ½ to 3 ½; that their se∣parate Forces must be in the proportion just now mentioned of 4 ½ to 1. Whence that Quan∣tity of Matter in the Moon, which at its pro∣per distance will bear this proportion of 4 ½ to 1 in the Elevation of our Tides and no other, must be its true Quantity. By a Computation from which Principles, it appears that the Moon has little more than the 9,100.000th part of the Quantity of Matter in the Sun; or, which is all one, little more than the 40th part of the Quantity in the Earth, as this Table informs us. For if you suppose the Sun as near as the Moon, its Force on the Tides will be so much greater than that of the Moon, as its Magnitude is greater;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 38. <HI>and pag.</HI> 9. prius.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> as about 9,100.000 is to 1, but then that Force being diminished as the Cube of the Sun's greater Distance is increas'd, or nearly as the Cube of 337 = 38,272.753 to 1; is upon the whole so much more diminish'd than in∣creas'd, that it amounts to only the 4 ½th part of it; that being nearly the quotient of 38,272,753 divided by 9,100.000. By this means we are able to add the Moon's Quantity of Matter to that of the rest of the foregoing Bodies. But since neither <HI>Mars, Venus, Mercury</HI>, nor any of the Comets, have any visible Planets about them; nor do they sensibly affect our Tides; we have no means of knowing the Quantity of Gravitation towards them, and so no means of knowing the Quantity of Matter contained in them.</P>

<P>These Numbers are thus discover'd. By what has been already set down, we know the real quantity of Matter in these several Heavenly Bodies; as also their true Diameters, and thence their entire Bulk or Magnitude; whence we ha∣ving given quantities of Matter in given Spaces, we must have withal the Densities of the same quantities also.</P>
<P>Or thus; Spheres of the same Diameters with these Bodies, will not have their just quantities of Matter above stated, unless their Densities be as those Numbers here set down; whence it follows, that these and no other ex∣press their real Densities respectively.</P>
<P>Thus for Example: The Solid Space in the Earth is to that in the Moon, as the Cubes of their Diameters, or as 48 ½ to 1; but, as we have seen, the quantity of Matter in the Earth is to that in the Moon only, as 39 ½ to 1; whence it follows, that the Density of the Moon compensates its smallness, and is to that of the Earth as 48 ½ to 39 ½, or as 123 ½ to 100, accord∣ing to the Table before us; and the Case is the very same in the rest.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) The <HI>Weights of equal Bodies</HI> on the <HI>Surfaces</HI> of the Sun and Planets last mentioned, have been by me thus determined.</P>

<P>That is, one Pound with us weighs on the Sun's Surface 24 4/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pounds, and so of the rest.</P>
<P>These Numbers are easily deriv'd from some of those that go before. For since we have al∣ready obtain'd those that express the Gravita∣tion towards these Heavenly Bodies, at equal di∣stances from their respective Centers; and since we have also already obtain'd their true Diame∣ters; and thence know their true Semi-dia∣meters; and since we know withal, that the Power at different distances is ever at the Squares of those distances reciprocally: It cannot be difficult thence to compute the quantity of this Power at the particular distances of every ones Semi-diameter; which is the same with the Weight of equal Bodies on their respective Sur∣faces.</P>
<P>Thus for Example: The quantity of Matter in the Earth is to that in the Moon as 39 ½ to 1, and in the same proportion do all Bodies gravi∣tate to them at equal Distances from their re∣spective Centers. But since the Force of Gra∣vitation diminishes, as the Square of the distance increases, and the distance of the Earth's Surface from its Center is to that of the Moon's from its Center, as 365 to 100, whose Squares are as 13 ⅓ to 1, this greater distance diminishes the former Excess of Proportion, and reduces it to that of 39 ½ to 13 ⅓, or, as in the Table, to that

of 100 to 34. And the Case is the same in the rest.</P>

The Earth's Period is known from the apparent Motion of the Fixed Stars from any Meridian to the same again; which is a Periodi∣cal Revolution, or Day. The Moon's diurnal Period is known from the Periodical Month, which is exactly equal thereto; otherwise the same side of the Moon would not be always turned to our Earth, as it certainly is; and that to such a degree of Nicety, that the Menstrual and Diurnal Motions of the Moon have not in the least gain'd nor lost upon each other from the earliest Times of Observation: which is a thing exceeding remarkable, and what will be taken particular Notice of hereafter.</P>

or nearly in the proportion of 1000 to 2828, is the Time of its falling to the Center: From which Demonstration it is easy to derive the foregoing Numbers.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) The Moon has <HI>Day</HI>, and <HI>Night, Sum∣mer</HI> and <HI>Winter, Mountains</HI> and <HI>Valleys, Land</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI>; as also an <HI>Air</HI> or <HI>Atmosphere</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Map of the Moon, Fig. <HI>VI.</HI></NOTE> with <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI>, and a <HI>Moon</HI>, and all after the same manner, in general, that our Earth has them.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Moon</HI> has <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night</HI>, is evident from the constant falling of the Sun's Light up∣on one Hemisphere of the Moon, and the re∣moval of that Light, from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI>, quite round it, in a Synodical Month, and is visible to our Eyes; which Space is therefore equal to an entire <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is 29d. 12h. 44′. long by our Computations.</P>
<P>That the Moon has <HI>Summer</HI> and <HI>Winter</HI>, is evident from the Librations of its Body, <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI>, which imply that its Axis is about 6½ Degrees distant from that of the Ecliptick, as our <HI>Summer</HI> and <HI>Winter</HI> is made by the De∣clination of the Earth's Axis 23½ Degrees from the same Axis. Only it hence follows, that in the Moon, tho' the Day be near 30 times as long as ours, and the Year only equal to ours in duration; yet that Year is with much less Inequality of Seasons, of Heat in Summer, and Cold in Winter, than ours; on account of the much smaller Declination of the Moon's Axis, than of that of our Earth, as compar'd with the Axis of the Ecliptick.</P>
<P>That the Moon has <HI>Mountains</HI> and <HI>Valleys</HI>, every Body that has seen its Face through a Te∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>escope cannot but know; these Inequalities of

its Surface, especially near the Limits of Light and Darkness, excepting the Full Moon, being to all most obvious and sensible; as are also a great Number of circular Cavities in other Places, into which the Sun may be perceiv'd to shine, and cast a Shadow, (excepting near the Full Moon) as evidently as the Moon does so here with us. Only it must be noted, that those who have measur'd the Height of the Lunar Mountains, which we stand here very conveni∣ently to do, find them much higher, at least in proportion to its Semi-diameter, if not also in reality, than those of our Earth.</P>
<P>That the Moon has <HI>Land</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI>, or some Parts full of Inequalities, like our Land, which strongly reflect Light; and others smooth and plain, like our Seas, which reflect it more weakly, is, I think, now very clear, not only from the obvious distinction which even the naked Eye makes between the rougher brighter Parts, and the smoother Spots, and which the Telescope does more fully confirm;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Astro-Theol. Pref. <HI>p.</HI> 51</NOTE> but more particularly from Mr. <HI>Derham's</HI> Noble Observa∣tion, which I am inform'd was first made by <HI>He∣velius</HI>; that when the Limit of Light and Dark∣ness passes over the brighter Parts, 'tis plainly jagged and uneven; but strait and even when it passes over the darker; which seems to me entirely to determine this Matter.</P>
<P>That the Moon has an <HI>Air</HI> or <HI>Atmosphere</HI> encompassing it round, is now, I think, very plain also, from its Appearance in Total Eclipses of the Sun, the fittest Times of all for its Ob∣servation, and especially from the two last To∣tal Eclipses, in 1706, and 1715, of which last I have given a full <HI>Account</HI> to the World; and

which <HI>Atmosphere</HI> has also been in some degree taken notice of in the last total Eclipse, <HI>May</HI> 11. 1724. and of which I have taken notice in my Account of that Eclipse. Only we must ob∣serve, that it appears by the Phaenomena, that the Moon's Atmosphere is, in proportion at least, much <HI>higher</HI> than ours, and at the same time much <HI>rarer</HI> also.</P>
<P>That the Moon has <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI>, is evident from the foregoing Assertions, as to its Seas and Atmosphere; and is distinctly proved by the Phaenomena of the Eclipse, 1715. in the Scheme or Account before-mentioned. On∣ly it must thence be noted, that the rareness of its Atmosphere is so great, that it will not sup∣port such gross opake Masses as our Clouds are here; but that the Vapours there rise and fall in a more easy and insensible manner, than is the Case in our Earth, at least since the Deluge of <HI>Noah</HI>: For I am still of the same mind as to the Antedilvuian State, which I proposed in my <HI>New Theory</HI>, that the Earth's Atmosphere was at that time comparatively regular and clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 246, 247</NOTE> and did then resemble what we find to be the agreeable condition of the Lunar Atmosphere at this Day; I mean by the Rising of the Vapours in the Day, and their Falling down in the Night, in the Form of a gentle Mist; without any of those Opake Masses which we call Clouds; and without any of those violent Storms of Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we, to our Sorrow, experience in our Atmosphere since that time.</P>
<P>That our Earth is a <HI>Moon</HI> to the Moon it self, and that a glorious and most useful One also, is not only evident from the Considerati∣on
<PB N="70" REF="109"/>
of the Astronomical System of the Earth and Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>VII.</HI></NOTE> but is directly visible to our selves also; it being clear that that Secondary Light which we commonly see in the dark part of its Body, for several Days before and after the New Moon, is no other than Light reflected to the Moon from our Earth, and thence reflected back to us again. Nor is this very surprizing neither; since the Square of the Earth's Diameter is more than Thirteen times as great as that of the Moon; and by Consequence the Light of the Earth is at the Moon in the same proportion grea∣ter, than that of the Moon at the Earth. Only it must be here noted, that how considerable soever the Light of a full Moon be to us, and the Light of a full Earth to the Moon, yet that both of them are very inconsiderable, if com∣par'd with that of the Sun to either of them; as being <HI>caeteris paribus</HI> in the Proportion only of the Square of the Earth's Semi-diameter, to the Square of the distance between the Earth and Moon, or, which is the same thing, as the en∣lightned Hemispherical Surface of the Moon or Earth, whence the Sun's Light is reflected, to that Hemispherical Surface whose Radius is the distance of the Moon from the Earth, over which that reflected Light is spread: <HI>i. e.</HI> that the Sun's whole Light is about 48000 times as great as that of a Full Moon to us; and about 3600 times as great as that of a Full Earth to the Moon.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Possibly therefore the Reason why we have never been able to procure any sensible Heat by burning Glasses, when expos'd to the Moon, is not from any real want of Heat in
<PB N="71" REF="110"/>
them, but only because those Glasses have never been large enough to gather Lunar Rays suffi∣cient for that Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The other Secondary Planets, I mean those about <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn</HI>, are too small and too remote from us, to afford us such In∣dications of their State, as we have of the State of our Secondary Planet the Moon. Nor indeed do the primary ones themselves afford us enow of them to determine in particular their own State, as to many such Matters. On∣ly <HI>Jupiter</HI> affords us the Appearance of Belts, or movable Girdles, and besides them, his Satellites afford us that famous Phaenomenon of the Velocity of the Rays of Light: And <HI>Saturn</HI>, besides his Five Planets, affords us such a Ring encompassing his Body, as seems to be the most singular and curious Spectacle in the whole System. Of these Three Phaenomena there∣fore I shall give some farther Account, before I proceed to the Comets and fixed Stars.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) As to the Belts, or movable Girdles of <HI>Jupiter</HI>, they seem to be formed by its Clouds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>VIII.</HI></NOTE> which appear to lie and to move regularly, parallel to its Equator, much after that man∣ner that our Clouds do between the Tropicks; where the constant Trade-Winds blowing still from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI>, must in a less Degree, cause our Earth's Surface to appear at a great Distance with such Belts also. Nor is it very strange, that <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Clouds lie more copiously and regularly in such a parallel Situ∣ation, than ours do, if we remember the vastly greater Magnitude of <HI>Jupiter</HI>, than of our Earth; and its much quicker diurnal Revolu∣tion
<PB N="72" REF="111"/>
at the same Time. But as to <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s, and other bright fixed Spots, compar'd with the rest of the duller Parts, I take them, as in the Moon to be Indications of the Diversity of Land and Sea in those Planets; although their much greater Distance from us, makes it hi∣therto a great deal harder to discover the same more distinctly.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) That the Rays of Light are not a meer and absolute Instantaneous Pressure through a Fluid, but a real Succession of the small Parti∣cles of Light gradually, and in a Time flowing from the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Body, is proved by the Eclipses of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Planets.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. IX.</NOTE> These Eclipses ever <HI>anti∣cipate</HI> the even Calculation, when our Eye, by the annual Motion, <HI>meets</HI> the Rays of Light reflected from them, whether at their last Egress from the Sun's Light into <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Shadow, or at their first Ingress into the same Light af∣terward; and the Eclipses ever come <HI>too slow</HI> for the same even Calculation, when we are going from those Rays; and this still in that Proportion, which implies that the Rays go no less than 81,000.000 Miles, or from the Sun to the Earth, in half a Quarter of an Hour.</P>
<P N="14">(14.) That <HI>Saturn</HI> has a broad Ring about it self, like a broad Tin Horizon about a Globe, is now well known, since the Days of the fa∣mous Monsieur <HI>Huygens</HI>, who first discovered what it was:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. X.</NOTE> And every body that views <HI>Sa∣turn</HI> through a good <HI>Telescope</HI> of Ten or more Feet, may see it very plainly at this Day. This Ring is vastly large; and when measur'd by the Micrometer, and compar'd with <HI>Saturn</HI>'s

<P><HI>Jupiter has its Belts; and in one of them that Spot by whose Revolution several times his Diurnal Period was discovered. Saturn has also here Its Ring, in its true Proportion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Besides these we have here represented an Eclipse of one of Jupiters Planets, both at its Immersion abc; and its Emersi∣on at f.: The former of which is alone visible to us from Jupiters Conjuction with the Sun to its Opposition; or while the Earth passes from c, by a, and p, to o: As is the latter visible alone from that Planets Opposition to its Conjuction; or while the Earth passes from o, by d, and b to c.

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> This Ring casts a mighty Shadow upon large Regions of <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Body, which removes from one Part to another, and causes great Di∣versity as to Light and Darkness thereon: And, what is probably to them more strange, they hardly know what it is that causes those Vari∣eties: For though we stand conveniently to see what it is, and know it to be a mighty Ring encompassing <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Body; yet is it not so easy for any in <HI>Saturn</HI> to discover it. They must naturally imagine it to be in the Heavens above them; and have, as it seems, no way but by Astronomical Observations and Parallax, to find out what it is: Just as we find out the Distance and Motions of the Moon, or of any other Heavenly Body. Whether this Ring, or indeed <HI>Saturn</HI> it self, revolve about its Axis, we are not yet assur'd: Nor are we certain whe∣ther this Ring be Solid or Fluid. When once our Glasses can shew us any permanent Spots in the Body and Ring of <HI>Saturn</HI>, we shall be able to determine whether there be such a di∣urnal Motion or not; but till that Time we must be content with Conjectures: For which, if there be room, I should certainly suppose the
<PB N="74" REF="114"/>
Ring to be Solid, and both to have such a Mo∣tion; nor only from its Conveniency for any Creatures that may be thereon, but from parity of Reason, and the general Case of the rest of the Heavenly Bodies: Not one of which are yet known to be destitute of such a Motion; al∣though some of them have not yet afforded us an Opportunity of certainly determining the same.</P>
<P N="15"><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Ac∣count of Co∣mets to∣wards the end of my <HI>Mathe∣matick Philoso∣phy,</HI> at large. Ibid. <HI>p 415.</HI></NOTE>(15.) The Number of the Comets is very considerable; to be sure much greater than of the visible Planets. Our famous Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>, by searching into the Histories of them, and com∣paring the Observations made about them, has given us a Catalogue or Table of so many as he could find well enough describ'd to af∣ford Foundation for determining their Orbits; which Table I have elsewhere given the Reader.</P>
<P>This Number is 24, all which have appear'd within the last 400 Years, in these Parts of the World. He has also observ'd, that out of these 24, Three had their Orbits and Circumstances so very like, and the Intervals of appearing so nearly equal; and that twice Two others had their Orbits and Circumstances so very like also, that he justly concluded it exceeding probable that the former Three were one and the same; and in some Measure so, that the latter Two were se∣verally also one and the same Comet; returning the 1st after 75, the 2d after 81, and the last after 129 Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 494.465.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> also discover'd, and in the new Edition of his <HI>Principia</HI>, Published his Discovery, that the last most eminent Comet of 1680, 1681, towards the end of its Appear∣ance, bent its Course so much inward from a
<PB N="75" REF="115" MS="y"/>
Parabolick Line, as to shew its real Trajectory to be <HI>Elliptical</HI>; and this in such Proportion, that its Period of returning must be more than 500 Years. After which Discovery I my self, for several Reasons, supposing this to be the same Comet that caused the Deluge, did ac∣cordingly guess the Period to be either 575, or 504 Years; according as it had made either Seven or Eight Revolutions since that Time; and drew up Tables upon both those Hypothe∣ses, when the same Comet must have appear'd afterwards, in order to search whether they did so or not; but not having either <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s or <HI>Luvienetz</HI>'s Histories of Comets then by me, I could not immediately confirm my Hypothesis any further. But in a little time I found, that Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>, and Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>, had com∣pleated what I wanted; and had discovered that just such a Comet had appear'd the 44th Year before the Christian <HI>Aera</HI>, which was the Year that <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was slain; as also, <HI>Anno Dom</HI> 531, or 532; and again <HI>A. D.</HI> 1106; and last∣ly, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680, 1681, and this still, after the forementioned Interval of about 575 Years; and that they accordingly did justly conclude it to be the very same Comet that appeared in those several Years. So that we have the Or∣bits of only 21 Comets, and the Periods at the most of only four of them yet known.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The first of these Three appear'd pro∣bably 1304, and 1456, but more certainly 1531, 1607, and 1682; and will by Consequence ap∣pear again 1758, and 1832, and so every 75 Years afterwards. The Second of them appear'd probably 1475, 1556, and 1718, and may not improbably be expected 1799. The third ap∣peared <HI>A. D.</HI> 1582, and not improbably 1661,
<PB N="76" REF="116" MS="y"/>
and so may be expected 1789, and 1918, and so every 129 Years afterwards. The Fourth having last appear'd 1680, 1681, and having its Period no less than 575 Years, cannot return till <HI>A. D.</HI> 2255. But then, as to the rest of the Comets, we cannot yet foretel the Periods of their Revolution, for want of Ancient exact Histories and Observations, but must leave their Determination to future Ages; which will, no doubt, if Astronomical Learning continues in the World, be in Time fully discovered, and known by our Posterity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>XI.</HI></NOTE><HI>N.

the same Nature with the Sun, as shining with their own Native Light; and continuing fixed in the Centers of their several Planetary and Cometary Systems, as the Sun does.</P>

As to the first Assertion, it seems very agreeable to the rest of the visible Bodies in the World, whether Planets or Comets, which are of very different Magnitudes also; and seems confirm'd from the second Assertion; for if the Fixed Stars visible to the naked Eye be at no very different Distances from our Sy∣stem, that vast apparent Inequality of Light which they send hither, and according to which they are ranked under six or seven different Mag∣nitudes on our Globes and Planispheres, will be next to a Demonstration, that they are them∣selves really of very different Magnitudes also. Nor in that Case will it be proper to place the Telescopick Stars at any vastly farther Distances, since they do not at all seem different from the other, only still gradually smaller. Now that the Fixed Stars, visible to the naked Eye, are not at any very different Distances from our System, is most probable, because the best Me∣thod we yet have of knowing those Distances, I mean their Parallax, determine that the Di∣stance of those Three which have been try'd, tho' all of different apparent Magnitudes, is very nearly the same. I do not deny that some Fixed Stars may be vastly farther off than others; and that there may be Systems of Worlds scattered every where in the Uni∣versal Immense Void: But I say, that if far∣ther
<PB N="79" REF="120"/>
Observations confirm this Parallax, and any sort of Equality thereof, we must accommodate our Opinions to our Evidence, and in that Case must suppose, that the grand System them∣selves of Sun, Planets. Comets, and Fixed Stars are, like the Parts of such a System, vastly re∣mote from each other; nay, perhaps, out of the reach of each others Discovery also. But as to this noble Theory, we cannot be at all po∣sitive till the Parallax and Distance of the Fixed Stars be more nicely observ'd, and the Astro∣nomical World better satisfy'd about it; the doing of which I would therefore earnestly re∣commend to the publick Consideration.</P>
<P N="18">(18.) Several of these Fixed Stars, especially of the smaller sort, do sometimes disappear, and new ones appear; and some of them do appear or disappear, look Brighter or Duller by Turns; and this sometimes after certain Intervals of Time also. This is a known Fact; and has in some measure been noted from almost the earliest Ages of Astronomy. But then, what should be the Cause of such mutable Appearances among these Fixed Stars, is by no means yet discovered; nor have I hitherto ventur'd to propose any Conje∣cture about them. However, since others have alteady begun their Hypotheses, which seem to me commonly either entirely precarious or abso∣lutely impossible, I shall make bold here to offer my own, which shall not only be free from such strong Objections, but agreeable to the nearest parallel Case in the World. We know that the Sun it self, the only Fixed Star, as I may call it, that is sufficiently within the reach of our Telescopes, has several Times not a few <HI>Maculae</HI> or <HI>Spots</HI> upon his Body; which fre∣quently
<PB N="80" REF="121"/>
become <HI>Faculae</HI>, or Parts brighter than the rest; and which come and go by turns. How many there may possibly be of these Spots at certain times we cannot say; but this is plain, that we do not know but so many of them may sometimes arise, as may, in good part, cover over the Sun's Surface, and render its Light and Heat very Weak and Dull. These Spots may be again dissipated, and become <HI>Faculae</HI>, or Brighter than ordinary. These <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> may sometimes, by Turns, gain ground on one another, after certain Intervals of Time, and cause the Sun to grow Darker and Brighter periodically. Nay, we do not know, but these <HI>Maculae</HI> may sometimes, especially in Case the Sun were smaller, cover over the greatest Part of its Surface, so as to extinguish, or at least to obscure its Light; which yet in Length of Time may be overcome, and the Sun may recover its former Splendor, if not one greater than that before. Since therefore such Phaeno∣mena of the Fixed Stars are like what our Sun ap∣pears by known Observations to be in some sort liable to, I think it the best Guide, as to what we see to happen to others of them; and that the <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> of those Stars may cause these surprizing Appearances. Nor can I easily think in any other manner, about those six Spaces of Light, or Starry Mists, which have been lately discovered in the Heavens, than by Analogy to what we know of Things of a like Nature; <HI>viz.</HI> that they are a Company of very small Fixed Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Transact. Philos. <HI>N.</HI> 347. <HI>for</HI> A.D. 1706.</NOTE> as invisible to us with our ordinary Telescopes, as the known Telesco∣pick Stars in the Milky Way are to our natural Eyes, which give such an irregular Appearance of indistinct Light also.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. <HI>Certain Observations</HI> drawn from the foregoing <HI>System</HI>.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) <SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE Matter is entirely a Passive Substance; no sponta∣neous Motion or Action, even in Brutes, can be derived from it; much less can that Active and Free Being, the Soul of Man, be justly sup∣posed to be material.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Since Bodies once existing will continue to exist, and that for ever, in the same State of Rest, or uniform Motion, along strait Lines, wherein they once are; at least with the alone Concurrence of the First Cause; the Projectile Motions of the Heavenly Bodies require no new, or particular constant Acts of Power for their continuation in that State. But,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Since none of the Heavenly Bodies move uniformly in strait Lines, but all of them rather unequally, and all in Curves, they are every one impell'd, and that perpetually, by some Exter∣nal Power, Efficacy, Force, or Influence; and
<PB N="82" REF="123"/>
thereby are obliged to revolve in such Curves; which Power we have already proved to be that of Gravity,</P>
<P N="4">(4.) If that Power of Gravity were suspend∣ed, all the whole System would immediately dissolve; and each of the Heavenly Bodies would be crumbled into Dust; the single Atoms com∣mencing their several Motions in such several strait Lines, according to which the projectile Motion chanc'd to be at the Instant when that Influence was suspended or withdrawn.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Since pendulous Bodies receive no sensi∣ble Resistance in their Internal Parts; and since both the Planets and Comets move prodigiously swift, with the utmost Freedom, and without any sensible Resistance through the Aethereal Re∣gions, 'tis certain there is no <HI>Subtile Matter</HI> pervading the Universe, as some have sup∣posed.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) All the Solutions, therefore, of the Phae∣nomena of Nature, which depend on the Sup∣position of that <HI>Subtile Matter</HI>, are entirely false, and contrary to the plain State of our <HI>Sy∣stem</HI>.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) To suppose a <HI>Plenum</HI>, or that the Uni∣verse is entirely full of such Subtile Matter, is utterly vain and ungrounded; nay, contrary to the most certain Observations.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) Since the particular Proportion ever ob∣taining as to the Power of Gravity, I mean that of the Duplicate of the Nearness of Bodies, is not any necessary Result from the Nature of Matter, or any Laws of Motion in the World; it is plain that this Proportion is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause or Necessity whatso∣ever, but entirely to free Choice, Prudence and Judgment.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="83" REF="124"/>(9.) Since all Bodies are equally capable of Rest, and of all Degrees of Velocity whatso∣ever; but are in their own Nature no way de∣termin'd to any of them; that nice Adjustment there is of the projectile Velocity to the At∣tractive Power through the whole Universe; whereby the Planets both primary and seconda∣ry revolve nearly in Circles, and the Comets nearly in Parabola's, is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause, or Necessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judg∣ment.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) Since all Bodies are equally capable of being originally impell'd every way, and of having their projectile Motions in any Directi∣on whatsoever; and since all the Planets, both Primary and Secondary, have their projectile Motions almost perpendicular to the Lines from their Central Bodies, which was absolutely ne∣cessary to their Motion, at nearly the same Di∣stance from the Sun; this nice Adjustment of the Direction of their projectile Velocity, where∣by they became fit for the Habitation of Ani∣mals, and without which they would have been almost useless in the World, is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause, or Necessity whatso∣ever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) Since all Bodies are equally capable of Rest as of Motion, and that in any Time, and with any Velocity; and since there is no origi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Connection between the projectile Directi∣ons and Velocities, of any two or more Bodies which now revolve about the common Centers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their own Gravities; without which Revoluti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns about those Centers, the present System of the
<PB N="84" REF="125"/>
Universe could not be supported; and yet with∣out the most exact Adjustment of those Dire∣ctions and Velocities to one another, the Di∣rections parallel, but contrary to each other, and the Velocities in a Proportion reciprocal to those Bodies themselves, such a Revolution could not be performed: Such an Amazing and Mathematical, and Universal, Adjustment of these Circumstances, cannot be owing to any Mechanical Cause or Necessity whatsoever, but must arise entirely from free Choice, Prudence and Judgment.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) Since all Bodies are equally capable of possessing any part of Space whatsoever; and since the Planets, both Primary and Secondary, and the Comets, with their several Degrees of Velo∣city, might be placed at any Distance from their Central Bodies; that nice Adjustment there is of their several Distances from those Central Bodies, to their several Velocities; whereby the Planets all revolve nearly in Circles, and the Comets nearly in Parabola's, can be no way ow∣ing to any Mechanical Cause or Necessity what∣soever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) Since all Bodies are equally capable of any Direction whatsoever, and yet all the Pla∣nets, both Primary and Secondary, do revolve about their Central Bodies, almost according to one Direction from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East</HI>; this par∣ticular Direction of the Annual Motions of all the Planets is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause or Necessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="85" REF="126"/>(14.) Since all Spherical Bodies are equally capable of turning round upon any Axis, or according to any Direction whatsoever; and yet the Sun and all the Planets, whose Diurnal Moti∣ons are already discovered, do revolve about their own Axes nearly from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East</HI>; this parti∣cular Direction is no way owing to any Mecha∣nical Cause, or Necessity whatsoever; but en∣tirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="15">(15.) Since all Spheres revolving about their own Axes are equally capable of turning round with any Velocity, and in any Period; and yet all the Heavenly Bodies that do so revolve, keep within proper Limits, agreeably to the State of every such Sphere; as particularly we find to be the Cases of our Earth, and of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Ve∣nus</HI> our Neighbouring Planets: This due Pro∣portion of the Diurnal Motion is no way ow∣ing to any Mechanical Cause, or Necessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Pru∣dence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="16">(16.) Since all Bodies revolving about ano∣ther, are equally capable of moving in any Planes whatsoever; and yet the several Primary Pla∣nets move almost in the same Plane about the Sun, and the Secondaries all in their same seve∣ral respective Planes about their Primaries, this exact Direction of the Planets into the same Planes-is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause, or Necessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="17">(17.) Since the greatest, as well as least Pla∣nets are equally capable of being plac'd near, as well as far off the Sun, the placing the largest Primary Planets the most remote, and the least nearest the Sun, whereby the several Motions
<PB N="86" REF="127"/>
continue most undisturb'd, and many fatal Con∣sequences, which would otherwise happen, are prevented; is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause or Necessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="18">(18.) Since the Secondary Planets are equally capable of revolving about their Primaries at the smallest, as at any other Distance whatso∣ever; and yet they all of them are situate so far off, as to cause no dangerous Tides in the Prima∣ries Ocean, which a much greater Nearness would certainly have done; this due Place of the Secondaries from their Primaries, is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause or Necessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Pru∣dence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="19">(19.) Since all the Planets are equally capable of revolving round the Sun at the smallest as great∣test Distances, and yet they are situate in a Mean, so as neither to be scorch'd with its Heat, nor frozen up with Cold, for want of it; as we particularly find to be the Case of our Earth: This proper Situation of the Planets, is no way owing to any Mechanical Cause or Ne∣cessity whatsoever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judgment.</P>
<P N="20">(20.) Since the Comets do revolve in very oblong Ellipses, quite through the Planetary Regions; and this in vastly long Periods, ac∣cording to all manner of Directions, and in all Situations of their Planes, contrary to the Laws every where observ'd among the Planets; 'tis very evident that the Intentions and Designs for which they are fitted, are very different, at least in their present State, from those for which the other are accommodated.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="87" REF="128"/>(21.) Since that Immechanical Power of Gravity, which is constantly exercis'd in the World, is proportionable to the Quantity of each Body to which it belongs; which Quan∣tity is vastly unequal in the several Celestial Bodies; it is thence certain, that the Author of that Power must be a Being that exactly knows, and takes perpetual Notice of all those Bodies whatsoever, in all the Variety of their Parts and Magnitudes.</P>
<P N="22">(22.) Since that Immechanical Power of Gra∣vity which is constantly exercis'd in the World, is not of one even and constant Quantity, but vastly unequal, according to the Squares of the different Distances of the Bodies affected with it; it is thence also certain, that the Author of that Power must be a Being that exactly knows and takes perpetual Notice of the Distances of all those Bodies whatsoever, in all the Variety of their Parts and Magnitudes.</P>
<P N="23">(23.) Since all the Effects of this Immechanical Power of Gravity do constantly obtain, and all the Consequences of that Power are ever found true in Fact, throughout the Universe; (abating only the Case of Miracles, not here to be con∣sider'd) it is certain, that the Author of that Power can and does move all Bodies, how great soever, and with what Degree soever of Velocity, according to that due and sixed Pro∣portion; without the least Opposition or Con∣tradiction, either from the Matter to be moved, or from any other Agent whomsoever.</P>
<P N="24">(24.) Since the Spherical Figures, with the Original Native Light of the Fixed Stars, and all other Circumstances, do shew that they be∣long
<PB N="88" REF="129"/>
long to our Universe, or grand System, and are subject to the same Law of Gravity which our particular System is governed by; it follows, that the foregoing consequences concerning the Author of that Law already drawn, as to one System, are also true, relating to all those other Systems.</P>
<P N="25">(25.) Since all the Motions in our Solar Sy∣stem must be so far at least retarded, as their Passage through a Medium every-where pene∣trated with the Rays of Light must imply; which Retardation, how small soever it be in it self, must in sufficient Length of Time become sensible, (as it is thought by some to be already in the Case of the Lunar Period,) it follows, that the several Parts of this System do by Gravita∣tion naturally and constantly, unless a miraculous Power interpose to hinder it, approach nearer and nearer to the Center of Gravity of this System; and in a sufficient Number of Years will actually meet in the same Center, to its utter Destruction.</P>
<P N="26">(26.) Since this entire grand System of Things is subject to this Power of Gravity; and since that Power of Gravity has its Effects as well among the Fixed Stars, with their several Systems, as in our Planetary and Cometary World, about the Sun; and since withal, the Sun and Fixed Stars do not revolve about one another, or about any common Center of Gra∣vity, as the Planets and Comets do; which Motion alone, according to Mechanical Laws, can hinder the Effect of that Power of Gravity; it follows, that the several Systems, with their several Fixed Stars or Suns, do naturally and constantly, unless a Miraculous Power interpo∣ses
<PB N="89" REF="130"/>
to hinder it, approach nearer and nearer to the common Center of all their Gravity; and that in a sufficient Number of Years, they will actually meet in the same common Center, to the utter Destruction of the whole Uni∣verse.</P>
<P N="27">(27.) Since Power can be exerted no where but where the Being which exerts that Power is actually present; and since it is certain, as has been shewn, that this Power is constantly exerted all over the Universe, 'tis certain that the Author of the Power of Gravity is present at all Times in all Places of the Universe also.</P>
<P N="28">(28.) Since this Power has been demonstra∣ted to be Immechanical, and beyond the Abi∣lities of all Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erial Agents; 'tis certain that the Author of this Power is an Immaterial or Spiritual Being, present in, and penetrating the whole Universe.</P>
<P N="29">(29.) Since the Sun and Fixed Stars send out perpetually, and with the utmost Velocity, Rays or Corpuscles of Light and Heat from themselves; and since we see with our Eyes that there is not any such Equality of those Stars on every Side, as might induce us to believe there can be an equal Circulation of those Rays from one System to another; and since we find by Mutations in our Sun, and by the Parallel Mutations in several of the Fixed Stars, that these very Suns themselves, the Fountains and grand Supports of the several Systems, are equally liable to Decay with the rest of the Universe; 'tis hence also plain, that all these Suns and Systems are not of Permanent and Eternal Constitutions; but that, unless a mira∣culous
<PB N="90" REF="131"/>
Power interposes, they must all, in length of Time, decay and perish, and be rendred ut∣terly incapable of those noble Uses for which at present they are so wonderfully adapted.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Although the External Parts of the Heavenly Bodies, with their Nature and Uses, may be most <HI>easily</HI> and certainly determin'd from Fact and Observation, yet do there not want Arguments whereby we may come at the Internal Parts or Regions of the same, their Nature and Uses, at least from very probable Considerations. Thus we know from Observa∣tion in Comets, that there are large Central Solids inclosed in their Atmospheres, indisso∣luble by the utmost Heat in their greatest Near∣ness to the Sun:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See at the End of my <HI>Mathe∣matical Philoso∣phy</HI>.</NOTE> We also know from the like Observations, that Comets are about the Bigness of Planets, and that the Atmospheres of Comets do best answer the Chaotick or Primary State of Planets, of all other Bodies in the Universe. We know farther by Demonstration, that if there be any Central Cavities within such So∣lids, the Effects of the Power of Gravity will be there so equipois'd on every Side, that there will appear to be little or nothing of such a Power at all:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 44.</NOTE> And, lastly, we may know, in some Measure, by Observations and Demonstrations compar'd together, whether there be such Ca∣vities in them or not; and in which of the Heavenly Bodies they are the most considerable, as we shall see presently. This general Obser∣vation thus Premis'd, I come to the Fifth Part of this Treatise, to give my Conjectures as to the several Natures and Uses of all the Parts of this System.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<PB N="91" REF="132"/>
<HEAD>PART V. <HI>Probable Conjectures</HI> as to the Nature and Ʋses of all the Parts of the <HI>SYSTEM</HI> of the visible World.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.)<SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Sun and Fixed Stars are, to be sure, on their external Regions or superficial Parts, most intense Fire or Light; and the grand Fountains of that Fire and Light which is in the whole visible Universe, and without which there could be no such thing as a <HI>Visible Universe</HI>, or Useful Sy∣stem at all. So that there can be no doubt of the general Nature and Use of those external Regions. Nor perhaps sall we be far out of the way, if we suppose those Parts of the Sun to be more than 10000 Planets or Comets all on Fire.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Planets, both Primary and Secon∣dary, appear, as to their visible external Regi∣ons, or superficial Parts or Atmospheres, to be like to that Planet we live upon, the Earth; or most convenient and well contrived Habitations for all sorts of Sea and Land, visible and gross
<PB N="92" REF="133"/>
Animals; with such Plants as are useful for any of their Preservation and Sustenance, du∣ring their continuance thereon.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Air expanded about the several Pla∣nets, which, as to their Elastical Parts, are cor∣poreal, but invisible, appear to be the proper Places for the Habitation of not wholly Incorpo∣real, but Invisible Beings; or of such as have Bodies made of too subtle and aerial a Texture and Constitution to be ordinarily seen by our Eyes, or felt by our Hands. And if it be con∣sidered, that while all the ancient Prophane Traditions, and Historical Accounts, as well as the Sacred Writings, which assure us of the Existence of such invsible Beings about our Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Prop. after my <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lectures <HI>p 287— <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>97.</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnt. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>p. 170, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>78.</HI> Meteor, <HI>p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8—72.</HI></NOTE> do at the same time assure us of their inhabiting in our Air, which is the only appa∣rent Place, according to the best Philosophy, where such invisible Beings, not destitute of all Bodies, can possibly inhabit; it will justly de∣serve our Consideration, whether this be not the noblest Design and Use of our Air; tho' at the same time its lowest Regions be an <HI>Atmosphere</HI> also; or be useful in Respiration, in Refracti∣on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so fitted as to elevate and let fall the Vapours belonging to our Earth, for the Support of the Creatures, in grosser Bodies, in∣habiting thereon.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The external Regions of Comets, which by passing through such immense Heat when nearest, and such prodigious Cold when farthest off the Sun; and by the confused and Chaotick State of their Atmospheres, do evidently appear incapable of affording convenient Habitations for any Beings that have Bodies, or Corporeal Ve∣hicles, whether visible or invisible to us; seem
<PB N="93" REF="134"/>
rather fitted to cause the grand Mutations of Nature in the Planetary World;<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Theory, p. 437, 438. <HI>and</HI> p. 440, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> by bringing on <HI>Deluges</HI> in their Descent, and <HI>Conflagrations</HI> in their Ascent from the Sun; as I have elsewhere more fully Discoursed.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) These Comets, with their Atmospheres and Tails, seem also fitted, as to their external Regions, to be a very uneasy, hot, and fiery Habitation when near, and a very uneasy, cold, and chill one, when far off the Sun, and this both on their Surfaces, and in their Airs.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) As to the Internal Parts or Regions of the Sun, Planets, and Comets, they seem to be Con∣cave, and to include vast open Spaces within. This Conjecture which is no way contrary to any other Phaenomena of Nature, I ground par∣ticularly upon the small Inequality there is in Fact between the Polar and Equatorcal Semi-diameters of those Heavenly Bodies which have diurnal Revolutions about their own Axes, com∣pared with the much greater Inequality there would naturally be between them, if they had not such Central Cavities. For Example, If the internal Parts of the Earth were of the same Density with the External, it is Demonstrated by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Princip. 2<HI>d Edit.</HI> p. 382— 387.</NOTE> that the Polar Semi-dia∣meter or Axis would be about 17 Miles shorter than the Semi-diameter of the Equator. If the Central Parts were much Denser than the rest, (as on all mechanical Accounts they ought cer∣tainly to be) these 17 Miles would be mighti∣ly increas'd, and probably amount to some Hun∣dreds. Yet is that Semi-diameter in Fact but about 31 Miles shorter than the other. Whence it is probable, that the greater Density in the deeper Regions, is compensated by the lesser
<PB N="94" REF="135"/>
Density, or rather partial Cavity of the Central Regions themselves. And this Reasoning is still vastly stronger in <HI>Jupiter</HI>; where the difference of Semi-diameters ought to be much more re∣markable, and to amount to some thousands of Miles, while yet it is therein but just sensible; and that only by the Use of the best Instru∣ments and Observations we have in Astro∣nomy.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is not improbable therefore, that those Central Cavities may be so fitted by Providence, as to afford Habitations to some Creatures, as well as the external Surfaces, the Land, the Water, and the Air, have appear'd to do; tho' this in different Circumstances, as to the diffe∣rent Bodies, the Sun, the Planets, and the Co∣mets. See Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Conjecture to somewhat the like Purpose, <HI>Transact. Philos.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 347. <HI>for A. D.</HI> 1716.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) If the Sun has such a Cavity for Habita∣tion, it must be fenced from the Heat of his more external Parts by a vastly thick Wall or Partition;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See pag.</HI> 54. prius.</NOTE> which that there may be even of many thousand Miles, the prodigious largeness of its Diameter, and the little comparative depth of the penetration of Heat through solid Earth, do Demonstrate. Nor would such a central Cavi∣ty in the Sun be in danger of any pernicious Heat, tho' it were large enough to hold, on its inward Surface, as many Creatures as the exter∣nal Surfaces of all the Planets and Comets put together could contain; as he that considers the Tables, <HI>pag.</HI> 54. and 56. before, will easily believe. Perhaps such a Degree of Heat may be deriv'd from the outward to the inward Regions, as will suit some of the Purposes of the Great
<PB N="95" REF="136"/>
Author of Nature therein: But then all its Light must be deriv'd from some other Cause, than from the outward Parts of the Sun.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) If the Planets, or any of them, have such Cavities for Habitation; because they keep nearly at the same Distance from the Sun, in the several Parts of their Course, their Heat as well as Light, must come most probably from within also, as not being ever Recruited in their Revolutions.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) If the Comets, while they continue such, have the like Cavities for Habitation; Part of their Heat, because of their Access to the Sun every Period, may be derived from it, and recruited every Revolution: But then all their Light, as well as that of the rest, must be deriv'd from within also.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) That the Earth in particular has such a Cavity, seems clear from Scripture, as well as it may be conjectured from Astronomy. For when many, at least, of the Souls departed out of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Gen. xxxvii.35. Num. xvi.3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. xxvi.20.xxxi.16. Rom. x.7. Eph. iv. 9, 10.</NOTE> are there represented as <HI>gone down</HI> into the invisible World; as <HI>descended</HI> into the Place beneath, or as <HI>gone down quick into the Pit</HI>; and when our Blessed Saviour is there still represented as upon his Death, <HI>going down into the Invisible World, and descending into the lower Parts of the Earth</HI>; nothing seems so agreea∣ble both to Nature and Revelation, as this Hy∣pothesis; which supposes such a Receptacle for Invisible Beings beneath, as exactly an∣swers to the foregoing Descriptions.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) If there be any such Cavities and Recep∣ticles for living Creatures, and the Things ne∣cessary for their Sustenance, in the Central
<PB N="96" REF="137"/>
Regions of the Sun, or of the Planets, or Co∣mets, 'tis certain their State and Circumstances must be very different from those on the Sur∣faces of the Planets. They must all live in Concave Spheres, which must hinder all Inter∣course between them and this visible World; Nor can they have any Philosophical Evidence that there is such an External World at all; which is the Case of the rest of this Universe, as to us, if we, with all the visible Stars, Co∣mets and Planets, be our selves included in such a Cavity; which is not absolutely impossible to be suppos'd. But then, as to the particular Circumstances of such Creatures, their way of Living, and the Course of Nature and Provi∣dence, and Divine Revelation relating to them, I shall not venture here to propose any particular Conjectures about them; only hinting this, that the Power of Gravity from the External Parts being in this Case none at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philos. <HI>Prop.</HI> 44.</NOTE> as we have else∣where observ'd, there may be therein such a World as is that we here see, with the like Sun, Planets, and Comets; only that they must be so much less in Quantity and Largeness, as the greater Narrowness of their Cavities requires: Yet still such as the Imagination will not be a∣ble to distinguish from our larger visible Uni∣verse it self.</P>
<P><HI>N.

<HEAD>PART VI. Important <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Natural Re∣ligion,</HI> Demonstrated from the fore∣going <HI>Observations</HI>.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y the <HI>Observations</HI> already made from the true System of the World, it appears,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the Souls of even all Brute Creatures are <HI>Immaterial, i. e.</HI> not com∣pos'd of that dull, unactive, insensible, solid, passive Substance, which we call <HI>Matter</HI>, or <HI>Body</HI>, and of which all the Visible and Sen∣sible World about us is compos'd, For it cer∣tainly appears, that all this Substance, which we properly call <HI>Material Substance</HI>, or <HI>Body</HI>, is so far from a Capacity of Sensation, Thought, Activity, and Moving it self and the Body, which are the known Properties of the Souls of even Brute Creatures themselves, that it is not capable of any active Property at all; being ever mov'd, impell'd, attracted, and directed entirely as other Bodies or Powers act upon it▪ and not otherwise. This I say is the natural
<PB N="99" REF="140"/>
Consequence of all that Physical Knowledge of Matter or Body, which Observation and De∣monstration leads us to. We can Philosophi∣cally trace material Impulse, and the material Images of External Objects, in some Measure, even in Brutes, through the Organs of Sense, up to the Brain, or the Fountain of Sensation and Action. But there Mechanical Causes end, and Material Effects cease; there that Agent or Sub∣stantial Being, which Sees, and Hears, and Feels, and Tastes, and Smells, and Joys, and Grieves, and Directs, and Moves, and Remem∣bers, and Hopes, and Fears, is present, and di∣rectly comes to be considered by us. But then it comes to be consider'd entirely as an Invisible or Immaterial Agent, or Substance, different from the Eyes, and Ears, and Hands, or Feet, and Palate, and Nostrils, and Nerves, and Brain, and Blood, and Animal Spirits of the Brute Creature; just as we consider the Organist that guides and directs the Pipes, and Sounds, and Stops of his Organ, as entirely different from those Pipes, and Sounds, and Stops them∣selves. Not that I pretend to tell of what par∣ticular Kind or Sort of Substance, that Sensitive and Active Being is compos'd, either in Brutes, or in Men, or in any Superior, Invisible, and Intellectual Beings. That Substance may be different in every different Kind. But that we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o still observe from their Phaenomena, that these Souls are different in their Properties and Actions, in almost all their Properties and Actions, not only from their own Gross Bodies, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut in general from what we call Matter or Bo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, from all that we call Matter or Body in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Universe. Immaterial they are indeed, and
<PB N="100" REF="141"/>
different from the Material Body, according to all the Notions and Experiments we ever have of these Brutes, and of Matter. But that does not directly inform us <HI>what</HI> they are, because we know not what <HI>Substance</HI> is in general, nor what the par∣ticular Substances of any particular Material or Immaterial Being are. But by comparing the Properties of Matter, with those of the Souls of even Brutes themselves, we plainly and evi∣dently perceive that those Souls are not Matter. 'Tis true, we cannot determine how far the De∣struction of the gross Body of a Brute affects the Soul, or sensitive Agent thereto united: We do not know whether those Souls are Immortal or not: We do not know whether they utterly pe∣rish with their Bodies; or whether they only continue in a kind of inactive insensible State, till they actuate other Bodies again or no, and so perpetually. And the Reason is plain, we have no way of knowing such Secrets of Nature and Providence, about Invisible Substances, by Observation, or Experiment: And the Author o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature has not been pleas'd to discover such Things to us, by Revelation. If I were to <HI>Guess</HI> where I cannot <HI>Know</HI>, I should imagine that all such Immaterial Souls do ever, by their peculiar Nature, perceive and feel whatever i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present to them, and no more; and that they endeavour to act in a way suitable to the Im∣pressions and Passions thereupon arising in them and no farther: That therefore, when they a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of a Body, their Sensations are so few and narrow, and there Powers so small, that the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are in a sort of Sleep, Silence and Inactivity that when they are in Bodies, (which a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most wonderful Structures and Machines, con∣triv'd
<PB N="101" REF="142"/>
at once to convey the Impressions of most numerous, and even most distant Objects to them, and to follow their Directions and Actions thereupon,) while those Bodies keep in Order, those Souls are alive, vigorous, and active; but when the Bodies are dissolv'd, or their Contexture destroy'd, their Souls return to their former State of Sleep, Silence, and In∣activity: though without a real Annihilation; and so without any Incapacity of Revival and Reactivity: I mean upon Supposition, that the Author of Nature, or any of those Ministers by whom he Governs the World, affords it another Opportunity for such a Revival and Reactivity again. This is, I say, what I should <HI>Guess</HI>, as to the State of the Immaterial Souls of Brutes, if I would indulge my self in such Uncertainties. And whether the <HI>Psalmist</HI> does not favour such a <HI>Conjecture</HI>, where he speaks thus, <HI>When God hideth his Face</HI> from such Creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. civ 29, 30.</NOTE> <HI>they are troubled: When he taketh away their Breath they die, and return to their Dust: When he sendeth forth his Spirit they are Created, and He re∣neweth the Face of the Earth:</HI> I shall leave to the Readers Consideration. But as to the Pro∣position it self; I mean, that what perceives and acts even in Brutes, is a Being or Agent properly and entirely distinct from that Body in which it acts, and is truly a Being or Agent Immaterial; This I take to be the natural Re∣sult of Philosophick Reasoning, from Fact and Experience: and by no means to be set aside, because we are not able to solve all Difficulties thereto relating: Which we are rarely, or in∣deed never capable of doing, in the last Resort in any part of Knowledge whatsoever. But as
<PB N="102" REF="143"/>
to those who, to avoid all such Difficulties, pre∣tend that Brutes have no Souls, no Sensation, no Action of their own, and are meerly Corporeal Clock-work, and Machines; they yield me this Point, that if they have Souls, and do really Per∣ceive and Act themselves, those Souls, those Princi∣ples of Sensation and Action, must be Immecha∣nical, and Immaterial: But then, they pretend to disbelieve that, which seems to me almost as plainly matter of Fact and Observation, as any of Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Experiments whatsoever. And I care not to answer such an extravagant Ob∣jection, which it is next to impossible to sup∣pose, that any sober Proposer can, in earnest, believe himself in his own Proposal of it. And when the Scripture assures us, that a <HI>Righteous</HI> or <HI>Merciful Man regardeth the Life of his Beast</HI>; and this in Opposition to the <HI>Cruelty</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. xii.10.</NOTE> which the <HI>tender Mercies of the Wicked</HI> or <HI>Savage Men</HI> are affirm'd to have; it most naturally implies, that those <HI>Beasts</HI> are themselves really sensible Crea∣tures, and not incapable of feeling the Effects of the Care, or of the Cruelty of their Masters towards them.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) We hence learn more certainly, that the Souls of Men are <HI>Immaterial</HI>. For if we have found that the lower Faculties and Operations of the Souls of Brutes, require us to allow them to be Immaterial, how much more must we do so as to Human Souls? For if we proceed higher to the Rational, the Intelligent, the Penetrating, the Free, the Active, the Sagacious Soul which is in Man; if we consider its vast Capacities and Faculties; and that it can and sometimes does, act contrary to all the material Impressions or Temptations which the sensitive Soul lays
<PB N="103" REF="144"/>
before it; contrary to all worldly Views and Motives, all corporeal and terrestrial Interests, and that it can and sometimes does freely chuse Poverty, Misery, and Persecution in this World, out of regard to God and Religion, and the Happiness of a Future State; This Rational Soul, I say, must needs be of so vastly higher a Nature, of such vastly nobler Faculties, of such a vastly superior Rank in the Creation, that He who can once suppose, that there is nothing in this Case but such Matter as we have Knowledge of in the World, with its Accidents, is in a fair way to believe any Properties may belong to any Beings, and that there is really no Distinction between a Square and a Circle; no Difference be∣tween Strength of Reason, and the Sound of an Organ; no Preference between the Arguments used in a Theological Dispute, and the Collisi∣on of Elastical Bodies in Motion; between a piece of Clock-work manag'd by Wheels and Springs, and an Human Soul govern'd by Rea∣son and Religion; which Confusion of Things, entirely different in their own Nature, seems to me so absurd and preposterous, so wild and auk∣ward, that I have not Patience to set about a more operose Confutation of it. Those who are under any Temptation to believe such Notions, which seem to me no less foolish than the wildest Dreams of Ignorance and Superstition themselves, may consult <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his Letter to My <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣well</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d its four Le∣sences.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s excellent Confutation of a late Writer upon this Head. Tho', after all, I can hardly think that Writer weak enough to have been in earnest; and if he were, I should have thought that too much Ho∣nour was done him and his crude Notions, when they were vouchsafed the favour of so master∣ly
<PB N="104" REF="145"/>
a Confutation. But this is too like a Digressi∣on to be farther insisted on in this Place. How∣ever, we may observe here, how agreeable this Immateriality of Human Souls is to the Sacred History of their first Original; where after the <HI>Lord God had formed Man out of the dust of the Ground</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii.7.</NOTE> the material Body, perhaps with its sensitive Soul also; He distinctly, from above, infus'd the Rational: <HI>He breathed into his No∣strils the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul</HI>.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) We hence learn not only the <HI>Immateria∣lity</HI>, but the <HI>Immortality</HI> also of Human Souls; or that the Destruction and Dissolution of the Body, with its Sensations, will not destroy or dissolve the Rational Soul united thereto; but will leave it still capable, not only of existing, but of acting in another State; if it please God so to dispose of it, that it may have prope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Opportunities for doing so. So far, as I take it, true Philosophy carries us here; I mean, it obliges us to put such a difference between the rational Soul, and the brute Body, that the Ruin of the one will no way infer the Ruin of the other; and that therefore, since Divine Revelation assures us of the living and acting of the Soul in the intermediate State, and also of its Return to the Body, and acting therein again after the Re∣surrection, this is all agreeable to sound Reason and Philosophy, to good Sense and the Laws of Nature: Tho' still all this, without asserting such a necessary Immortality, or Eternal Durati∣on in Happiness or Misery, as is independent on the Power, and Will, and Laws of the Au∣thor of Nature; to which all the Enjoyments, and Faculties, and Perceptions of a Human Soul
<PB N="105" REF="146"/>
may still be owing hereafter, altho' the Sub∣stance it self of that Soul should, of it self, when once created, continue to exist, as all real Beings seem to do, without any particular In∣terposition of Providence for such their Conti∣nuance. Philosophy, Mathematical and Expe∣rimental Philosophy, obliges us to suppose, that the Soul will continue to exist after Death, and will therefore be still <HI>capable</HI> of Action and En∣joyment, of Happiness and Misery. Divine Re∣velation assures us this separate Soul <HI>shall</HI> Act and Enjoy, shall partake of Happiness and Misery in a lower State and inferior Degree before, and in an higher State and superior Degree after the Resurrection: So that Reason and Religion sup∣ply, and support, and confirm each other, and, upon the whole, assure us of the Truth of this grand Principle of all Religion, especially of the Christian, That this Life is not the only, or the principal Stage on which we are to Act; that this World is not the only or the principal Time for our Happiness, or Misery; but that, after this frail and mortal Life is ended, which is only a short State of Tryal and Probation, we must live a longer one of Enjoyment hereafter. Which Truth is of that Importance for us to be satisfy'd in, that nothing of either Natural or Supernatural Knowledge, which tends thereto, ought to be neglected by us. Nor may we here omit the exact Agreement of this Natural Truth of the <HI>Immortality</HI> of Human Souls with Divine Revelation, particularly with our Sa∣viour's own important Words upon this Head: <HI>Fear not them which kill the Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. x.28.</NOTE> <HI>but are not able to kill the Soul: but rather fear him, who is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell</HI>.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="106" REF="147"/>(4.) We hence learn the <HI>Being of God</HI>, the first Intelligent Cause and Author, the just Owner and Possessor, the Supreme Lord and Governor, the constant Preserver and Disposer of all Things. This Foundation of all Religi∣on, the Belief of a Supreme Deity, is the first, the most natural and obvious Deduction of Hu∣man Reason, even from the Contemplation of the most common and ordinary Appearances of Nature; from the Growth of every Plant, and the Succession of every Season, and the gene∣ral View of every Heavenly Body, and every Creature about us. And there have certainly been no Nations or People, of the usual Capa∣cities of Mankind, but have ever drawn this Consequence in all Ages of the World. So that if this Inference be not the <HI>Voice of Nature</HI> it self, we shall be at a great loss to find other Truths, requiring any Reasoning at all that can deserve to be so stiled. And no wonder, since the Argument is the very same by which, from the Contemplation of a Building, we in∣fer a Builder; and from the Elegancy and Use∣fulness of each Part, we gather he was a skil∣ful Architect; or by which from the View of a Piece of Clockwork, we conclude the Being of the Clockmaker; and from the many regular Motions therein, we believe that he was a curi∣ous Artificer. Which Deductions he who is not <HI>Able</HI> to make, has not the <HI>Reason</HI>; and he that will not allow them to be <HI>Just</HI>, has not the <HI>Honesty</HI> of the meanest Countryman. 'Tis true, that if this sort of arguing were confin'd to Childhood or Folly; to the Age of Igno∣rance, or the Temper of Ideots; if the more nicely we viewed the World, the less Reason we
<PB N="107" REF="148"/>
found to admire its Contrivance; and when we were come to the top of Enquiry and Examina∣tion, we lost all the Occasions of our Wonder and Adoration: If, I say, this were the Case, a sober Person might think fit to suspend his As∣sent, and to cast about for some other Solution of the Phaenomena of Nature. But in case the wise and examining Man still finds vastly stronger and more numerous Reasons for the Acknowledgment of the Divine Existence, than the Fool, or the careless Enquirer does; so that if he spends his whole Life in the pursuit of this sort of Knowledge, he perceives new Argu∣ments every where crowd upon him to the same purpose; which is the known Case, as to Expe∣rimental Philosophy, at this Day; He who is still resolv'd to suspend his Assent, and either to wrap himself up in wilful Scepticism, as if he knew nothing; or to try how far he can be ab∣surd enough to believe, that the World is it self the only God, the only Eternal, Omnipotent, All-wise Being; or, which is yet more absurd, that all the Wonders in its Contrivance came meerly by Chance and Accident; and will continue by Chance and Accident, till by the like Chance and Accident they all come to nothing again: He, I say, who acts thus, does certainly, if ever Man did, <HI>dare operam ut cum ratione insaniat; takes great pains to shew himself, with great Learning, the most egregious Fool in the World</HI>. While true Wisdom or Philosophy would teach him to assent to the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>, when he justly affirms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. i.20.</NOTE> That <HI>the Invisible Things of God are clearly seen from the Creation of the World; being understood by the things that are made; even his Eternal Power and Godhead. So that
<PB N="108" REF="149"/>
Men are without Excuse</HI> for Atheism. But this general Reasoning is so obvious, and so com∣mon, that I shall not here enlarge upon it; but rather apply my self to demonstrate the parti∣cular Attributes and Operations of God from the particular Phaenomena of the World already set down; as being a thing less common, and of greater Advantage. Accordingly from what has been before advanc'd, we learn,</P>
<P N="5">(5.) That the World has not been from all Eternity, but that God was the <HI>Creator</HI> of it, and that He, and He alone, at first Disposed and Ordered the several Parts of the Uni∣verse, into that wise and wonderful Structure in which we now see them. I do not here mean to intermeddle with that more intricate Problem of the proper <HI>Creation</HI> of the <HI>Matter of the Uni∣verse out of Nothing</HI>; because the Phaenomena of Nature give us no Indications either way: nor, as I understand it, does Divine Revelati∣on ever directly concern it self with it. Only, that I may not be mistaken, I declare my own Opinion to be still, as it has ever been, against the Eternity of Matter, and for its Original Creation out of nothing by the Almighty Pow∣er of God. But then, I am not only of <HI>Opi∣nion</HI>, but am fully <HI>Satisfy'd</HI> from the plain Phaenomena of Nature, that the World was, in the more ordinary Sense, originally Created, and at first put into that State in which, for the main, we still find it, by the Divine Power, Wis∣dom and Goodness. I have already shewed, that the present System of things, acting accord∣ing to those Laws of Motion and Nature which are now fixed in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 88, 89, 90, prius.</NOTE> cannot possibly have been <HI>a parte ante</HI>, and cannot possibly be <HI>a parte post</HI> Eternal: Much less is it possible, that
<PB N="109" REF="150"/>
one little Corner of it, such as our Earth, should have been, or should be hereafter Eternal by it self. This pretended Eternity of the World, is indeed so far from the Result of any just Rea∣soning, or Philosophical Evidence, (and to any Divine Revelation it never yet, that I know of, made the least Claim;) that I dare appeal to the entire System of Nature, whether there ap∣pear one single Argument for, or Indication of such an Eternity, either <HI>a parte ante</HI>, or <HI>a parte post</HI>, in the whole Universe. I profess, I know none. And unless Men be so weak as to leave Fact, Nature, Experiments, and Mathematicks, for the Subtilties of Metaphysicks, and the Cob∣webs of Abstract Notions, they must believe the World not to have been, or to be Eter∣nal. But for those that are subtil enough to deny the Reality of Motion, or the Freedom of Human Actions, because they are not able to account Metaphysically for Motions Migration from one Subject to another, as they speak, or for the Mode and Seat of Human Freedom in the Soul; while their own Senses and Observa∣tions do every Day of their Lives assure them of the Reality of them both; they are Persons fit for the Atheists Purpose in this Matter, and will be proper Patrons for the Eternity of the World. He that, with <HI>Ocellus Lucanus</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Univer∣so</HI>, Cap. 1.</NOTE> can prove the World to have <HI>no End</HI> in Point of Du∣ration, because it is of a round Figure, which certainly in another Sense has <HI>no End</HI>; or He that can demonstrate from abstract Reasoning about the Nature of Matter, and that Equality of Mo∣tion he may suppose to be in every Part of the Universe; that a certain Clock or Watch will of it self go for ever, tho' at the same time he sees
<PB N="110" REF="151"/>
such wearing of the Wheels and Pivots, such decay of the Spring, and such Rust and Foul∣ness over the whole, (besides the Necessity of its being wound up every Revolution) as must, by Calculation, put a Stop to its Motion in 20 Years time; Such as these, I say, are also Persons right∣ly disposed for the same Doctrine of the World's Eternity. But for the rest, I mean for all the sober Part of Mankind, who are govern'd by common Reason and Experience, they will, I believe, yield to the Facts and Arguments al∣ready used; and because 'tis thence certain, that the present World is not, cannot be natu∣rally Eternal, will readily ascribe its Origin to the great Author of Nature, to God himself: They will easily allow, that the <HI>Belief in God the Father Almighty, as the Maker of Heaven and Earth</HI>, is no less a certain Doctrine of Na∣tural Religion, than it is a primary undoubted Article of the Christian Faith: Nor will they wonder, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> Legislator begins his <HI>Archaeology</HI> with this Assertion, <HI>In the Beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.1.</NOTE> as a very proper, a very necessary, and certain Prelimi∣nary to that Divine Legislation he was to lay down, in vertue of the Authority of the same great Creator.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) We learn from the foregoing System of the World, that God, the Creator of it, is an <HI>Eternal</HI> Being, and has existed before all Time, and all Worlds, even absolutely from everlasting. This Attribute of God of a proper <HI>Eternity</HI>, or <HI>Necessity of Existence</HI>, without any Cause or Be∣ginning whatsoever; (for these Properties seem to me to infer each other, if not to be one and the same;) appears to be one of the hardest No∣tions
<PB N="111" REF="152"/>
that a human Mind can take in. Yet is it the most certain of all others. For 'tis most appa∣rently plain, that if the First Cause and Origi∣nal Being does now, or ever did exist, as we have shew'd he now does, and ever did since the World began; He must have existed from all Eternity, otherwise He must have at first <HI>produced</HI> himself <HI>into Being</HI> when He <HI>was not</HI>; or must <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Create</HI> before He <HI>was</HI>; which all the World owns to be absolutely impossible. This Attribute, we see, is not deriv'd from any particular Phaenomenon of the Universe; but from them all, and every one together. Nor do any who believe the foregoing Corollary, concerning the Existence of God, so much as pretend to doubt of the <HI>Eternity</HI> of that Exi∣stence; so that I shall not need to enlarge any farther upon this Attribute in this Place. Only we may observe, how agreeable this <HI>Eternity</HI> of God, here gathered from the Light of Nature, is to Divine Revelation, which assures us, that <HI>Before the Mountains were brought forth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. xc.2.</NOTE> or ever <HI>he had formed the Earth or the World, even from Everlasting to Everlasting He is God</HI>.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) From the foregoing <HI>System</HI> we learn, that God, the Creator of the World, does also ex∣ercise a continual <HI>Providence</HI> over it, and does interpose his general, immechanical, immediate <HI>Power</HI>, which we call the <HI>Power of Gravity</HI>, as also his particular immechanical <HI>Powers of Re∣fraction, of Attraction</HI>, and <HI>Repulse, &amp;c.</HI> in the several particular Cases of the Phaenomena of the World; and without which all this beauti∣ful <HI>System</HI> would fall to Pieces, and dissolve into Atoms. On which Occasion, the <HI>Apostolical
<PB N="112" REF="153"/>
Constitutions</HI> speak as agreeably to Philosophy as to Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. V.7. <HI>init.</HI></NOTE> when they say, <HI>The whole World is held together by the Hand of God</HI>. For, as we have already observ'd, though we should not think it necessary to suppose a particular In∣terposition of the Supreme Being, in the Con∣servation of the Natures or Existence of Things, and of their Original Projectile Motions, which once begun may continue of themselves, with∣out any new or particular Support; (in which Case however not a few think it necessary to introduce the same, and that the <HI>Conservation</HI> of Things is no other than a kind of <HI>continual Creation</HI> of them;) tho', I say, we should not think it necessary to suppose, that continual in∣terposing Providence in the material World, in order to its Preservation, yet can we not avoid allowing it in that grand immechanical Power of the Universe, I mean that of Gravity, and in the other immechanical Powers of the same Nature above-mentioned. These do continually act in the World, and alter the Places and Mo∣tions of Bodies perpetually; which makes me commonly chuse to call them here <HI>Powers</HI> ra∣ther than <HI>Laws</HI>, as the <HI>Power</HI> of Gravity, or Refraction, rather than the <HI>Law</HI> of Gravi∣ty or Refraction; and so for the rest. For this I take to be the Difference between a <HI>Power</HI> and a <HI>Law</HI>, speaking strictly; that a <HI>Law</HI> be∣longs to such Rules as necessarily flow from some Property of Bodies, without any new Action exercis'd thereupon; as that <HI>Bodies once in Motion continue for ever to move with that Degree of Velocity which they once have, without Intermission, along those strait Lines, according to which those Motions are already directed:</HI> But a
<PB N="113" REF="154"/>
<HI>Power</HI> is here <HI>Such a Rule, by which the Bodies are constantly moved out of those Lines, and from those Velocities they naturally had, into other Lines and Velocities distinct from them</HI>; which plainly implies a real Action, a true Force, Impression or Influence actually exerted upon them; whether we call it Impulse, or Attraction, it matters not; and this perpetually also: Which is therefore quite different from the foregoing Case, as to the ordinary Mechanical Laws of Motion; and supposes a real Agent, and He sufficiently Active, and Powerful also to remove all such Bodies through the Universe perpetually. For I desire those who think otherwise, to tell me, how unactive Mat∣ter, without such a continual Exercise of Force upon it, can be continually oblig'd to leave its natural, even, rectilinear Motion, and to move faster, or slower, in a curve Line? Can it, of it self, admit of a <HI>Law of Gravity</HI>, and of it self ever exert this <HI>Clinamen</HI>, this <HI>Departure</HI> from its proper Course? But this is to suppose it not <HI>unactive Matter</HI>, but an <HI>intelligent Self-moving Being</HI>, which alone is capable of under∣standing of Laws, and acting according to them. In short, it seems to me most evident from the Phaenomena of the World, that all such Laws or Powers as we are now speaking of, which are many and wonderful, and yet abso∣lutely necessary to the Preservation of the pre∣sent System, are the real Effects of the conti∣nual <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> of God himself, for the Conservation of the <HI>Universe</HI>; and that whenever he pleases to suspend such Exercise of that Power and Providence, the World it self will dissolve into Atoms, and its present Form
<PB N="114" REF="155"/>
suffer an utter Destruction. I conclude this Head in the elegant Words of the <HI>Psalmist</HI>, when he celebrates the great Creator, for some remarkable Instances of his <HI>Providential Care</HI> over his Creatures: <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works!</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. civ.24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>in Wisdom hast thou made them all: The Earth is full of thy Riches. So is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great Beasts. There go the Ships: There is that Leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. These wait all upon thee; that thou may'st give them their Meat in due Season: That thou givest them they gather: Thou openest thine Hand, they are filled with Good. — The Glory of the Lord shall en∣dure for ever; the Lord shall rejoice in his Works. — I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing Praise unto my God while I have my Being.</HI> But to proceed. We farther learn from this System of the World,</P>
<P N="8">(8.) That this Supreme God, the Creator and Preserver of the World, and the Author of the Power of Gravity, and of all other the Im∣mechanical Powers of the Universe, is a <HI>Free Agent</HI>, no way limited by any <HI>Necessity</HI> or <HI>Fate</HI>, but acting still by <HI>Choice</HI>, and according to his own <HI>good Pleasure</HI>. This Attribute of the Di∣vinity, without which the Supreme Being him∣self would be below Mankind, a meer Fatality, and no way worthy of any Veneration, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Love, or Gratitude from his Creatures, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fully demonstrated under so many of the fore∣going <HI>Observations</HI> from the System of the World, that I scarce need quote any one o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them in Particular. And I appeal to all that we now know of this entire Universe about us
<PB N="115" REF="156"/>
whether there be one single Indication of such a rigid Fatality, and Necessity therein. 'Tis true, such strange Reasoners as <HI>Hobbs</HI> and <HI>Spinoza</HI>, &amp;c. pretend by Metaphysick Argu∣ments to demonstrate this Fatality and Neces∣sity, even as to the Actions of the Supreme Be∣ing, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> it self. But then, they do by the like Metaphysick Reasoning, as strongly pretend to demonstrate the same Fatality and Necessity of Human Actions also; which last we are sure, from our own certain, constant Experi∣ence, all our Lives long, is utterly false and ri∣diculous; and therefore we have no Reason to depend on the like Subtilties in the other Case: Especially while instead of Metaphysick Subtil∣ties on one Side, we produce the plainest Expe∣riments, Observations, and Demonstrations from Nature, and the System of the Universe, on the other: And while Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI> has, with great Sagacity, shew'd the Inconsistency of that Metaphysick Reasoning, and the Freedom of the Divine Being, and of Human Actions, even in their own Way, both in his Sermons at Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lectures, and Answers to an Anonymous Author already quoted, to which I shall refer those Rea∣ders, who have a mind to deal in that way of Reasoning. As for my self, while I clearly see that the constant Experience of all Men, and the en∣tire Phaenomena of the whole Universe, directly prove the Freedom of Human and Divine Acti∣ons, I am not much concern'd what may be al∣ledg'd to the contrary from Metaphysick Uncer∣tainties; especially when I find it every-where confirm'd by Divine Revelation also; which al∣ways teaches us to render such Praise and Thanksgiving to Almighty God, for the Mercies
<PB N="116" REF="157"/>
of Creation and Providence, as would be per∣fectly ridiculous, if all such his Operations were entirely fatal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. ciii. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and involuntary. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bless his Holy Name. Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Benefits: Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, who healeth all thy Diseases: Who redeemeth thy Life from Destruction, who crowneth thee with loving-Kindness, and tender Mercies. Bless the Lord, all his Works, in all Places of his Dominion: Bless the Lord, O my Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. We learn from the true System of the World, that this Supreme God is an <HI>Intelligent</HI> and <HI>Omniscient</HI> Being, and that he knows the entire State and Condition of every Body con∣tain'd in this entire Universe, at what Di∣stances, and in what Circumstances soever; and that in every Moment of Time from the Begin∣ning of this System, till its Conclusion. This is derived from Observations 21st and 22d foregoing; and is a most unquestionable De∣duction from the Phaenomena of the Universe. I use the Word <HI>Omniscience</HI> here, as such Words are commonly used in Scripture, and Ancient Authors, for such a Degree of Know∣ledge, whether in it self absolutely infinite or no, which extends every-where to the whole visible Universe, and takes in all the particular Parts of the same, to the utmost Limits of our Examination and Computations, without Excep∣tion. For in this Sense only, can the Phaeno∣mena of Created Beings, which must be every way finite, become Demonstrations of the At∣tributes of their Uncreated Original Creator; which alone can be, strictly speaking, esteemed
<PB N="117" REF="158"/>
absolutely Infinite. Nor are we here, or in other Cases, concerned any farther. For if the Supreme Author of our Universe, does certainly and exactly know whatsoever is, or is done in this Universe, what does it concern us, whether he equally knows whatsoever is, or is done in any other Invisible or Imaginary Systems beyond it? Although he who believes that this Omni∣science, or other such infinite Attributes, belong truly to the Supreme God, its Author, to the utmost Extent of this grand System, must be a very strange Person, if he can deny, or doubt whether the Omniscience of the same Supreme Being, extends to the rest of the other invisible Systems also; supposing there be such other Systems, and that they are the Workmanship of his Hands also, as well as ours. All which con∣firms the Words of <HI>Elihu</HI>, when he thus exhorts the great Example of Patience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job xxxvii.14, 15, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Hearken unto this, O Job, stand still and consider the wondrous Works of God. Dost thou know when God dis∣posed them, and caused the Light of his Cloud to shine? Dost thou know the Balancings of the Clouds, the wondrous Works of him that is perfect in Knowledge?</HI></P>
<P N="10">(10.) We learn further from the true System of the World, that this Supreme God does not barely know and understand all the Bodies, and all that is done by all the Bodies, in this entire grand System, but he most <HI>Wisely</HI> and <HI>Pru∣dently</HI>, and <HI>Sagaciously Orders and Disposes of all the said Bodies</HI>, and particular Systems there∣to belonging. This is such a known and fre∣quent Consequence of the foregoing <HI>Observa∣tions</HI> from the true System of the World, that almost one half of them demonstrate the un∣doubted
<PB N="118" REF="159"/>
Truth and Certainty of it. Nor could there be any Occasion for enlarging on this Head, were it not that the Moral or Living World, does not here always seem to agree with the Natural or Astronomical one. In the latter there is plainly and every where Marks of such Exactness, Harmony, Prudence, Sagacity, Wisdom, and Conduct, that not only perfectly Convinces, but Amazes and Astonishes us, even all of us, who throughly consider the particu∣lar Instances, the innumerable, clear, irrefraga∣ble Instances of the same, in every Part of the Universe: And he must be stupid to the utmost Degree, who can go a Course of Mechanicks, of Anatomy, of Botanicks, and especially of Astronomy, without the most satisfactory Con∣viction in this Case. Those natural Sciences, particularly Astronomy, will fully demonstrate what the Sacred Writings have already inform'd us of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm cxlvii.4, 5.</NOTE> not only that <HI>God telleth the Number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names</HI>; that <HI>great is our Lord, and of great Power</HI>, and that <HI>of his Understanding there is no Number</HI>; but also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">civ.24.</NOTE> that <HI>His Works are manifold, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wisdom has he made them all</HI>. But then, how it comes about that we do by no means per∣ceive the same Exactness and Harmony, in the Moral and Living World; which we every∣where see in the Material and Physical, is a great and noble Problem; though not belonging to this Place. I have my self occasionally touch'd upon it in my other Writings; but ac∣knowledge it to deserve a much larger and fuller Disquisition. In the mean time, I must confess, that I have met with no Account thereto relating, so Authentick, so Rational an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="119" REF="160"/>
so Valuable, as those we have in an Ancient, but too much despised Book of Primitive Christia∣nity; I mean the <HI>Recognitious of Clement</HI>; which I some time since Translated into <HI>English</HI>, for the Advantage of the Unlearned, but In∣quisitive Reader; to which therefore I must re∣fer him for his Satisfaction in this Case. Only so far the present Proposition may justly tend to his Satisfaction, as it certainly Demonstrates the Proportion, Harmony, and Decorum every where provided for by the Supreme Being in the Natural World, and by consequence affords us the greatest Reason to believe, what by the Light of Nature we cannot but expect from Him, that in the last resort and upshot of Things, we shall find the same Proportion, Harmony, and Decorum provided for, with regard to all his Living and Rational, that is, to his Principal, which are already so remarkable and surprizing, as to the rest of his Inanimate and Irrational, which are but his Inferior Creatures.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) We learn farther from the true System of the World, that the Supreme God, who Made and Governs it, is a most <HI>Powerful</HI> and <HI>Almighty Being</HI>; whom nothing can resist, and against whom nothing can oppose it self in the whole Creation. This is not only the natu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Result of this World's derivation from God, and its receiving all its Powers and Abilities from him; which must needs imply, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Author of them all is still of greater Power; and that no created Might can oppose it self against that Might by which it was it self crea∣ted; but is a direct Consequence from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3d Observation before-going. And that we may have some particular Notion of the Greatness of
<PB N="120" REF="161"/>
the Divine Power, and Almighty Efficacy in this our own System, let us consider the Great∣ness of the Bodies it every where moves; and the Velocity with which it moves them. The former you may find in the Table, <HI>pag.</HI> 56. and the latter in that <HI>pag.</HI> 53. whereby it appears, that the Planets alone, which are continually moved, are together above Four Hundred Mil∣lions of Millions of Cubical Miles in Magni∣tude; that the Velocity wherewith they are mov'd, in their Annual Motion, is, at a mean, about 52000 Miles in an Hour; and that the Velocity of the Corpuscles of Light is still vast∣ly greater, and no less than Six Hundred and Fifty Millions of Miles in the same time; and all this has been so continually from the begin∣ning of the whole System to this very Day; and that without the least proper Resistance or Opposition from either any of these Bodies them∣selves, or from any other Power or Agent what∣soever. On which account we may every one of us well say with Holy <HI>Job</HI>, after God had made an Eminent Representation to him of his own Omnipotence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job xliii.2, 6.</NOTE> and of <HI>Job</HI>'s Weakness; <HI>I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no Thought of thine can be hindred:— Wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in dust and ashes.</HI></P>
<P N="12">(12.) We learn farther from this true System, That the Supreme God, who made and governs the World, is every where substantially and real∣ly <HI>present</HI> through the whole; or is at all Times, and in all Places, <HI>Omnipresent</HI>. This is a most direct Consequence of the Divine Knowledge, and Wisdom, and Power, the At∣tributes and Actions of the Supreme Being, con∣tinually exerted throughout the whole Universe.
<PB N="121" REF="162" MS="y"/>
Nor can we any more conceive them actually exercis'd <HI>where</HI>, than <HI>when</HI> that Being, whose Attributes and Powers they are, does not it self exist; which last is by all Men allow'd to be grosly absurd and impossible. Nor does either the Sun, or any other Being, afford us any thing, like a Virtual, as distinct from a Sub∣stantial Presence and Efficacy. The Sun indeed sends out Rays of Light, which Rays operate where the Sun is not: But then both of them operate only where themselves are. Nor is any other Notion consistent with common Sense, or the possibilities of Things. For to say that a Being Acts <HI>where</HI> it is not, is to say in effect, that <HI>Nothing</HI> Acts in that place; or that the <HI>Effect</HI> produc'd, has in that Place <HI>no Cause</HI> to produce it; which are the grossest Absurdities and Contradictions possibles. But then, as to the Vastness of the Extent of this Presence of God, through this grand System, including all the Systems of the Fixed Stars also, it is to us hi∣therto unlimited and undetermin'd; tho', in all probability, in it self not really Infinite. How∣ever, so far we are certainly upon Fact to sup∣pose the Divine Omnipresence to reach, and to be present, as we discover the Effects of the same; I mean so far as the visible Universe ex∣tends; which we know, on the lowest Compu∣tation, must be nearly that of a Cube of 1,400. 000,000.000 Miles Diameter, which contains near 3,000.000,000.000,000.000,000.000,000.000, 000.000, <HI>i. e.</HI> three Sextilions, or three Millions of Millions of Millions of Millions of Millions of Millions of Cubical Miles. An amazing Space
<PB N="122" REF="163"/>
this, and as to any Power of Imagination, scarcely to be distinguish'd from Infinite Space it self! And so far, to be sure, the Omnipresence of God extends it self. Nor can even these Li∣mits inclose, or limit the Presence of the Su∣preme Being; who as He is by Demonstration present every where within, and between all the Parts of the several immense Systems, so, no question, is his Presence extended as well be∣yond the Grand System it self, as we know it is beyond this particular System wherein we live. But since the vast Visible System of the Universe is that with which we are alone concern'd, and such as even wearies and amazes our Faculties, when we attempt so much as to imagine its Immensity, I shall wade no farther into that unfa∣thomable Abyss of infinite Extramundane Space; the nicer Consideration of which, like that of Infinite Duration or Eternity, is evidently too large for our finite Thoughts; and does ever more Astonish and Confound, than Profit and Edify Mankind. And no wonder, since 'tis highly probable that both of them, as to their inmost Nature, and largest Extent, are alone knowable by that High and Lofty One, who, in the Prophet's Expression, <HI>Inhabits Eternity</HI>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. lvii.15.</NOTE>I conclude this Head in the apposite Words of the <HI>Psalmist</HI>, of <HI>Jeremiah</HI>, and of the <HI>Apostolical Constitutions</HI>, which shew that Reason and Revela∣tion agree in this important Attribute of the Di∣vine Omnipresence. <HI>If</HI>, says the <HI>Psalmist, I ascend up into Heaven thou art there:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. cxxxix.8, 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>If I make my Bed in Hades, behold thou art there.

<P N="13">(13.) We learn farther from this System, that the Supreme God, the Maker and Gover∣nor of the Universe, is, in his own Nature and Substance, <HI>Immaterial</HI>. This is also a most di∣rect Consequence from the true System of the World, whereby it has appear'd that God, the only Author of the Power of Gravity, does act, and is present to the inmost Parts of all solid Bodies; nay that he is equally present, and equally acts in those inmost Parts of all solid Bodies, as in any empty Spaces themselves, and withal that this Action upon all Bodies is not like to material and mechanical Impulse, which is ever on the Surface only; but penetrates those Bodies themselves, and every where causes a Gravitation, not according to the Surface, but according to the entire solid Content, or Quan∣tity of the real Matter it self, contain'd in every one of those Bodies. This Property is highly remarkable, and of great Consequence against those who are unwilling to allow any real Being but Matter in the Universe. Whereas it has for∣merly
<PB N="124" REF="165"/>
appear'd, that both the Sensitive Souls of Brutes, and the Rational Souls of Men, are <HI>Immaterial</HI>; and it does now most evidently appear, that the Supreme Being himself is also <HI>Immaterial</HI>; that is, it appears that the entire noblest Parts of the Universe, all the Living, Active, Thinking, Enjoying Parts of it, for whose Sake alone the rest of it could be made, together with the Almighty Maker himself, are really <HI>Immaterial</HI>. So little do the Wishes, and Desires, and Fancies, and Hypotheses of the Old and New Atheists, agree with the true Sy∣stem of the Universe! And so exactly do the wisest Notions, and Inclinations, and Doctrines, and Assertions of the Patrons of God and Reli∣gion, in all Ages, appear to correspond to the same! I heartily wish, that such Persons would well consider of this Observation; and no long∣er make use of those small Arguments, to take away the Being and Attributes of God; which still appear, when we come to real Fact, Expe∣riment, and Demonstration, to be as little agree∣able to Philosophy and Mathematicks, as they are in themselves Impious, and Blasphemous against their great Creator and Benefactor. Nature as well as Scripture teaching us, that <HI>God is a Spirit</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">John iv.23, 24.</NOTE> and that by Consequence, <HI>they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in Truth</HI>.</P>
<P N="14">(14.) We learn moreover from this true Sy∣stem of the World, that the Supreme God, the Maker and Governor of the Universe, is a <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Beneficent</HI> Being, and one that takes Care of the Welfare and Happiness of his Crea∣tures. This is a direct Consequence from no small Number of the Observations foregoing,
<PB N="125" REF="166"/>
which shew the great Care he has taken of the Situation and Motion, and Circumstances of the several Planets, at due Distances from the Sun, and from one another, that so they might be the most commodious and comfortable Habita∣tions for the Creatures that were to live upon them. And the same might be more distinctly and particularly observ'd as to our Earth, and its Inhabitants, if this were a proper Place for it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr.</HI> Moore <HI>a∣gainst</HI> A∣theism <HI>in Mr.</HI> Ray<HI>'s Wisdom of</HI> God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Part II. <HI>C.</HI> 1. 2. <HI>Dr.</HI> Chey∣ne<HI>'s Philo∣sophical Principles of</HI> Natural Religion. Part I. <HI>C.</HI> 5. §. 24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> But this has been so frequently and fully done already, that I shall rather chuse to insert what has already been excellently said by others in the Eighth Part; or to refer my Reader to them here, than to repeat those Observations in this Place. Upon the whole, the Provision that is made by the Divine Providence for Men, and all Creatures living, which alone are capable of the Goodness and Beneficence of the Creator, both in their Entry into, and during their entire Con∣tinuance in this World, is so ample, so abun∣dant, so surprizing, that he who carefully con∣siders the Particulars in all Sorts and Species of Animals with us, and especially in Man, the Lord of them all, will be soon obliged not only to grant, that God is a Beneficent Being, but also, with the <HI>Psalmist</HI>, to Admire, and Adore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 107.</NOTE> and <HI>Praise the Lord for his Goodness, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men</HI>. And this Inference is the more just, because the Infinite Perfection, and Self-sufficiency of the Divine Nature, does so entirely privilege him from all Want, and from all expectation of In∣crease of Happiness from any of his Creatures, that every one of the Instances of his Benefi∣cence, both in the Creation and Conservation, and Provision for those Creatures, must needs
<PB N="126" REF="167"/>
be the alone free and generous Effects of his Bounty, and the gratuitous Communication of his Goodness to them; in order not to <HI>his</HI>, but to <HI>their own</HI> Happiness and Felicity; which Circumstance renders this Goodness and Benefi∣cence the most highly Meritorious and Divine of all others whatsoever. I do not here take no∣tice of the Objections against this Goodness and Beneficence of the Divine Nature, from the seeming Irregularities now appearing in the Mo∣tal and Rational Part of the Creation; because Divine Revelation always owns such seeming Irregularities at present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ii.5.</NOTE> and refers the full So∣lution of them to the <HI>Day of the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God</HI> hereafter; be∣cause we are hitherto not sufficiently acquainted with the last Result and Upshot of Things to determine those Matters; and because the most ancient <HI>Recognitions</HI> of <HI>Clement</HI> have prevented me in good Part, and afforded more Authentick and valuable Hints, than any others which we at this Day can propose, towards their Solution. To which therefore I shall here, as I did before, re∣fer the Inquisitive Reader for better Satisfaction. Only so far the present Proposition, as well as a foregoing One, may be of use to us in that Matter; as it assures us of the Goodness and Beneficence of God, in the wonderful Contri∣vance of the World about us, for the Ease and Comfort of the several Creatures which are therein: Which cannot but dispose us to be∣lieve, that the same Attributes will at last ap∣pear equally glorious as to the <HI>Moral</HI>, as they do already as to the <HI>Natural</HI> World.</P>
<P N="15">(15.) We learn farther from the true System of the World, that the Supreme God is invariably
<PB N="127" REF="168"/>
the same in all Ages; or that he is an <HI>Immutable</HI> Being. I do not mean that he is so rigidly <HI>Immutable</HI> as to be <HI>Inexorable</HI> to the Prayers of his Suppliants, who ask in a due manner what is fit for them; or that he has <HI>immutably decreed</HI> the <HI>Fates</HI> of Men, let them do whatever they will. These Properties would not be those of a Wise or Good Being, but of a Foolish and Evil one. Nor do the Phaenomena, whence I draw this Attribute of Immutability, in the least im∣ply any such Things. But I mean, that God ap∣pears to act by certain and constant Laws of Mo∣tion, of Gravity, of Refraction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this at all Times, and in all Places of the Universe, from the beginning of this System or World till this very Day; and from the utmost Limits of the same System one way, to those that are op∣posite, so far as we are ever able to examine; without any Variation from the same, from one Generation to another. Those only Cases are to be excepted, wherein God is pleased to in∣terpose in a more immediate manner, and by leaving or contradicting the settled Course of Nature and ordinary Providence, does more effectually demonstrate his Divine Power and particular Providence in some extraordinary and miraculous Cases, for the greater Benefit of any of his Creatures. Tho' by the way it will de∣serve to be considered, whether even in those Cases, such miraculous Operations may not be, usually at least, brought about, rather by the means of Angels, or of some other Spiritual and Invisible Beings, which Revelation and Hi∣story assures us are as his Ministers in the World, without the direct Alteration of those Fixed and Constant Laws of Nature, which we other∣wise
<PB N="128" REF="169"/>
find to be immutably observ'd by him. Thus that <HI>Iron</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King vi.5, 6.</NOTE> which was made to <HI>swim</HI> in Water by the Prophet, contrary to the known Law of Specifick Gravity, might as well be sup∣ported by an invisible Agent, notwithstanding its superior Gravity, as that superior Gravity, by the direct Substraction of the Divine Influ∣ence by taken away from it; and so in many other Cases; and this without the Impeachment of the Miracles themselves, or their Intentions among Mankind. However, since we have already proved that the Supreme Being is a Powerful, a Wise, a Good, and a Free Agent, as well as we are now shewing him to be an Immutable One, it cannot be just so to interpret one of these Di∣vine Perfections, as at all to clash with, or con∣tradict the other: and by Consequence, we are not so to establish <HI>Immutability</HI>, as in any Case to hinder the <HI>free Exercise</HI> of his Power, Wis∣dom, and Goodness, where sufficient Reasons de∣termine Him to act as he pleases in the Govern∣ment of the World. For that would be a strange Notion of a Powerful, Wise, Good, and Free Being, that He could exercise that Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, in only one invariable manner, let the Occasions for a different Exer∣cise of the same be never so great or necessary. But, this Case excepted, Nature and Scripture agree, that <HI>in God is no variableness, neither shadow of turning</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. i.17.</NOTE></P>
<P N="16">(16.) We learn also from this true System of the World, that the Supreme God, the Maker and Governor of all Things, is not a blind Fate, or Series of necessary Causes and Effects, but is a <HI>Spiritual</HI>, a <HI>Living</HI>, and an <HI>Active</HI> Being; per∣petually exerting his Divine Perfections in the
<PB N="129" REF="170"/>
whole Universe. I do not here take the Word <HI>Spiritual</HI> meerly for Incorporeal or Immaterial; which Property I have already discoursed upon; but as importing also that Vigor, and those Acti∣ons which brute Matter is uncapable of, and which are the proper Effects of Life, and on which Account the Sacred Writings so often call GOD the <HI>Living God</HI>, in opposition to those Dead or Inanimate Heathen Idols, which were not able to do any Thing either for Mercy or Judgment. Now that the Supreme God, the Author of all Things, must be thus a <HI>Spiritual Living</HI> and <HI>Active</HI> Being, continually Observing, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Knowing, and Ordering, and Providing, and Acting in the World, is not only highly proba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le because he is the Creatot of all; and there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore will not certainly forget, or overlook, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eglect the <HI>Works of his own Hands</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. cxxxviii.8.</NOTE> but is di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly proved from many of the foregoing Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ositions, which have given us abundant Instan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of such his Life and Activity. And no won∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er that the Supreme Spiritual Being is thus Living and Active, since, as Material Substance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Body is in its own Nature, according to all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Experience we ever have of it, Dead, Inert, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd wholly Unactive; so does it seem that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piritual Substance, or Soul, is in its own Na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in general, Living, Active, and Vigorous; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that the different Degrees of such Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctivity, and Vigor, do constitute or proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the several Kinds of Spiritual Beings, from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e meanest sensitive Soul of a Brute, up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upreme Spirit of the Universe himself. I do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t mean with <HI>De Cartes</HI>, that a Soul or Spiri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Being does for ever actually think, or is al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays by necessity of Nature, in Action; no
<PB N="130" REF="171"/>
more than I believe that a Body is ever really, and by necessity of Nature in Motion; but that it is always Quick and Active and Ready, up∣on all Occasions and Objects that present them∣selves, to think, and consider, and resolve, and exert it self; and that this Faculty is one of its main Distinctions from Body or Matter, which is entirely destitute of all such Faculties whatsoever. And certainly, He that produc'd all the Living, and Active Powers and Abilities which are in the Creatures, must himself possess them in the highest and most exalted manner possible; which Life and Activity, if He, the Supreme Being, were wholly bereaved of, he would be so far from the Object of our Wor∣ship, Fear, Love, and Adoration, as all Men naturally look upon him to be, that he would be certainly the Subject only of Neglect and Contempt. Wherefore Philosophy, as well as Religion, assure us of the Truth of what <HI>Darius</HI> an Heathen King was once obliged to acknow∣ledge, that <HI>Men ought to tremble and fear before God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. vi.26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>for He is the Living God, and stedfast for ever; and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. And He worketh Signs and Wonders in Heaven and in Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="17">(17.) We farther learn from the true System of the Universe, That the Supreme God, the Maker and Governor of all Things, is but <HI>One</HI>. This <HI>Unity</HI> of God, or that there is but <HI>One</HI>. Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent Being or Agent, who created and governs all Things, is among the first Dictates of Nature and right Reason, when it reflects upon the obvious Phaenomena of the World, and is most clearly confirm'd by all the foregoing Observations. The <HI>Universe</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="172"/>
appears thereby to be evidently <HI>One Universe</HI>; govern'd by <HI>One Law of Gravity</HI> through the whole; and observing the <HI>same Laws</HI> of Mo∣tion every where. The <HI>Conduct</HI> of the whole is every where <HI>One and the same</HI>; and not the least Signs or Traces do appear of any Op∣posite, or Coordinate Power interposing it self in any of its regular Phaenomena. So that this <HI>Unity of God</HI>, is now for ever esta∣blished by that more certain Knowledge we have of the Universe; as it was naturally also, tho' in a lesser Degree, discoverable by all Man∣kind before. So true and just are the Words of the Apostles in their <HI>Constitutions</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI>VI.C.20.</NOTE> concerning the Occasion of God's imposing on the <HI>Jews</HI> the rigid Ceremonies of the Law of <HI>Moses</HI>, after their Idolatry about the Golden Calf:
<Q>“I impose these Things on thee, — that be∣ing press'd and gall'd by thy Collar thou mayest depart from the Error of Polytheism, and laying aside that, <HI>These are thy Gods O Israel</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xxxii.4. Deut. vi.4.</NOTE> mayest be mindful of that, <HI>Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is One Lord</HI>; and mayest run back again to that Law, which is inserted by me in the Nature of all Men, <HI>That there ”is only One God in Heaven, and on Earth</HI>.</Q></P>
<P N="18">(18.) Lastly, we learn from this true System of the World, that we and all Creatures are en∣tirely under the <HI>Dominion</HI>, and subject to the supreme <HI>Authority</HI> of this One God, as to <HI>our Lord and Governor</HI>. This is the most natural and obvious Consequence, from what has been hi∣therto proved, concerning the Existence, the At∣tributes, and the Providence of the One Su∣preme God; that this World, wherein we all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive, is <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>World</HI>; that this System of the
<PB N="132" REF="173" MS="y"/>
Universe, is God's great House, or Family, or Kingdom; and that the Rational Beings are God's Creatures, the Members of that his Fa∣mily, and Subjects of that his Kingdom; ow∣ing all possible Obedience, Duty, and Homage to him, as to their great Master and King. This absolute <HI>Supremacy</HI> of the One God, and Obli∣gation of all Derived and Created Beings to en∣tire <HI>Submission</HI> to him, is so plain from these Consi∣derations, that as He must be the most <HI>egregious Fool</HI>, in point of Prudence, that will dare to op∣pose himself to the Omnipotence of his Al∣mighty Lord and King; so is he the most <HI>pro∣fligate Wretch</HI> in point of Duty, that will ven∣ture to refuse his Submission to the Infinite Wis∣dom and Goodness of his most beneficent Cre∣ator, Father and Benefactor, <HI>In whom he lives, moves, and has his Being; and whose Offspring he is</HI>. Nor will Philosophy it self in the least scruple the justness of that Exhortation made use of by the <HI>Psalmist</HI> upon this Occasion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. xcv.3—7.</NOTE> <HI>Because the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods; because in his Hand are the deep Pla∣ces of the Earth, and the Strength of the Hills is his also; because the Sea is His, and He made it, and his Hands formed the Dry Land; O come therefore, let us Worship and Bow down, let us Kneel before the Lord our Maker: For he is our God, and we are the People of his Pasture, and the Sheep of his Hand.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PART VII. Important <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Divine Re∣velation,</HI> confirm'd from the fore∣going <HI>Principles,</HI> and <HI>Conjectures</HI>.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE it has now pleased God, as we have seen, to discover many no∣ble and important Truths to us, by the Light of Nature, and the Sy∣stem of the World; as also, he has long discovered many more noble and impor∣tant Truths by Revelation, in the Sacred Books; It cannot be now improper, to compare these two <HI>Divine Volumes</HI>, as I may well call them, together; in such Cases, I mean, of Revelation, as relate to the Natural World, and wherein we may be assisted the better to judge, by the Knowledge of the System of the Universe about us. For if those Things contained in Scripture be true, and really deriv'd from the Author of Nature, we shall find them, in proper Cases, confirm'd by the System of the World; and the Frame of Nature will, in some Degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear Witness to the Revelation. But if those
<PB N="134" REF="175"/>
Points contain'd in Scripture be false, and did not really come from God, we shall find the Frame of Nature, which is now much better understood than in the Days of those Antient Writers, frequently to contradict them, and so to detect their Forgery, and prevent their fur∣ther Imposition upon Mankind. Nor indeed have we any way so sure and satisfactory to examine the pretended very ancient Accounts of Things by, as this in general; I mean, the trying their Verity in such Points, whether Natural or Hi∣storical, as we have sure Methods of knowing, whether the Things asserted in them were, or might be really true or not. For as a plain Dis∣agreement of Nature, or certain History, from Scripture, in such Points, will afford a terrible Suspicion, that the latter is either false, or at least interpolated; so will as plain an Agree∣ment be a mighty Evidence for the Truth, and Uncorruptness of those Scriptures; and this even in general, as to such other Contents of the same, as can no way come under the like Methods of Examination. If I am once fully satisfy'd, that a Witness is Upright and Honest, ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in several Points where there was the greatest Suspicion as to his Sincerity, he will de∣serve the better Credit in other Cases, even where no corroborating Evidence can be alledg'd for his Justification. To this kind of Evidence then do I Appeal on behalf of those Sacred Writings; and do plead for their Reception, as Genuine and Authentick Records, in the several particular Cases following.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Scriptures agree to declare the very same, <HI>all the same Truths</HI>, and ascribe the very same, <HI>all the same Attributes</HI> to God, which
<PB N="135" REF="176"/>
we have shewed to be real, and to belong to him from the Consideration of the System of the World.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Their Accounts of the <HI>Creation</HI> of the World out of a <HI>Chaos</HI>, when rightly understood, are not only agreeable to many Remains of An∣cient Prophane Tradition, but to the Frame and Laws of Nature, and the true System of the Universe.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Their Chronology, or Accounts of the <HI>Antiquity of the World</HI> are right, and agreeable to the best Methods which Nature and Philoso∣phy afford us for the discovery of the same.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Their Accounts of the <HI>Paradisiacal State</HI>, and its Mutation from that State, before the <HI>An∣tediluvian One</HI>, after the Fall of Man, are agreea∣ble to Nature, and the true Frame of the World.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) So are their Accounts of the <HI>Universal Deluge</HI> in the Days of <HI>Noah</HI>.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) So are their Accounts of the <HI>Invisible World</HI>, or of <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Daemons</HI>, their Places and Ministrations.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) So are their Accounts of the future <HI>Con∣flagration</HI> of the World.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) So are their Accounts of the <HI>Resurrecti∣on of the Body</HI>, and <HI>Renovation</HI> of Things.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) So are their Accounts of the future <HI>Con∣summation of all Things</HI>.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) So are their Accounts of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or of the Place of Departed Souls, in the intermediate State, before the Resurrection.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) So are their Accounts of <HI>Heaven</HI>, or of the Place and State of Happiness for Good Men after the Resurrection.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="136" REF="177"/>(12.) So are also their Accounts of <HI>Hell</HI>, or of the Place and State of Punishment for wick∣ed Men, after the Resurrection.</P>
<P>These are the Heads I propose to Discourse of. Only before I begin, I must as I have already done under the Head of Conjectures, to which this Part will commonly bear a very near Relation, intreat the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der to distinguish exactly between the foregoing <HI>Propositions</HI>, with their <HI>Inferences</HI>, as to Natural Religion, Chapters IV. and VI. which I propose as <HI>certain</HI>; and the foregoing <HI>Conjectures</HI>, with their <HI>Inferences</HI>, as to Reveal'd Religion, Chapters V. and VII. which I propose as <HI>Probable</HI> only. I do not mean, that the Doctrines themselves, contain'd in Scripture, are only Probable; for I believe they have the Cer∣tainty of Divine Revelation it self; But that the Accounts, or Natural Solutions of those Points here offered, which are commonly the Result of my own peculiar Thoughts and Notions, upon the Comparison of Scripture and Philosophy together, are not yet to be look'd on as more than private or <HI>probable Conjectures</HI>, humbly proposed to the Consideration of the Publick. I speak this in the general, and with regard to the greatest number of them: For as for some few of them, especially that relating to the De∣luge of <HI>Noah</HI>, I cannot but look on them as so exceeding probable, that I can scarcely avoid placing them under the foregoing Affirmations, or Assertions. But to come to Particulars,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) I observe that the Sacred Accounts de∣clare the very same, <HI>all the same Truths</HI>, ascribe the very same, <HI>all the same Attributes</HI> to God, which we have shewed to be real, and to be∣long
<PB N="137" REF="178"/>
to God, from the Consideration of the true System of the World. This I have taken care to prove or illustrate all the way as I went over those particular Truths and Attributes; and took notice that both Nature and Scripture all along correspond to the several Conclusions: That they jointly agree that the Souls of Brute Creatures are distinct from their gross Bodies, and are sensitive, and most probably <HI>incorporeal</HI>; That the Rational Souls of Men are more cer∣tainly and entirely <HI>Immaterial</HI>; that they are also <HI>Immortal</HI>, or will naturally exist after the gross Bodies are dissolved; that there is a God or <HI>Supreme Being</HI>; that this World has not been <HI>Eternal</HI>, but was <HI>Created</HI> by that Supreme Being; that this Supreme Being, the Creator of all Things, is an <HI>Eternal</HI> Being; that He Exercises a continual <HI>Providence</HI> over the Creatures he has made; that he is not a <HI>Necessary</HI>, but a <HI>Free Agent</HI>; that He is <HI>Intelligent</HI> and <HI>Omniscient</HI>; that He is an <HI>All-wise</HI>, and that He is an <HI>All-powerful</HI> Being; that He is <HI>Omnipresent, Imma∣terial</HI>, and <HI>Immutable</HI>; that He is <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Bene∣ficent</HI>; that He is a <HI>Spiritual</HI>, and <HI>Living</HI>, and <HI>Active</HI> Being; that He is but <HI>One</HI>; and that He is therefore the alone Supreme <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Governor</HI> of the whole Universe. Now this cannot but be a great Confirmation of the Sacred Records, that such Deductions from Astronomy and Na∣tural Philosophy, as their Authors could either not at all, or very imperfectly make when they lived, do yet, upon that vast Improvement of Natural Knowledge, which has been of late made, all appear right and agreeable to the true System of Things. And this is more par∣ticularly to be observed, as to such of the be∣fore-mentioned
<PB N="138" REF="179"/>
Divine Attributes, as the Hea∣thens differ'd from the <HI>Jews</HI> and Christians in; wherein the System of the Universe does, as we have seen, every where bear Witness against the Heathen, and for the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Notions in those important Matters. I instance di∣stinctly in that grand Doctrine of the <HI>Unity</HI> of God, wherein these Sacred Records did all along differ from the current Notions, and consequent Practices of the rest of the World, in all those Ages whereto they belong; and indeed insisted on it to that degree, as to lay their entire Foun∣dations on that <HI>Unity of God</HI>, in the directest opposition to the <HI>Polytheism</HI> of the rest of the World; and this without the Pretence of grea∣ter Natural Knowledge than was in other Nati∣ons, to derive that Notion from; and yet with such Boldness and Assurance, as to Ordain the hazard of Life it self, and of all the Comforts thereof upon its Truth, and the Hopes derived from it. This Agreement of the System of the World to the <HI>Unity of God</HI>, now so certainly discovered by the System of the <HI>Universe</HI>, in exact Concord with the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Re∣cords; and in direct Contradicton to the Opi∣nions of the generality of the Heathen World, even in the Politest and most Learned Ages of it, is like a <HI>Solemn Determination</HI> upon an <HI>Open Appeal</HI> made on the sides of the <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri∣stians, against all the rest of the World, in this most Important and Fundamental Point of true Religion. Which Determination ought therefore to be own'd as the highest Attestation to that true Religion, and those Original Records where∣in it is contain'd, that could easily be desir'd or
<PB N="139" REF="180"/>
expected: And which accordingly ought to be allowed to be of the greatest Weight and Moment possible in the present Case. I observe,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That the Sacred Accounts of the <HI>Creation</HI> of the World out of a <HI>Chaos</HI>, when rightly un∣derstood, is exactly agreeable to the Frame of Nature, and the true System of the Universe. That Account of the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Creation which I mean, is this, That, taking the only Example which is in Nature of a real <HI>Chaos</HI>, I mean the <HI>Atmosphere of a Comet</HI>, for the <HI>Mosaick Chaos</HI>; and taking that Chaos or <HI>Atmosphere</HI>, not to be revolv'd about its own <HI>Axis</HI>, till after its Formation into a Planet, which Nature fully agrees to, and which would imply a <HI>Day</HI>, and a <HI>Year</HI>, to be all one, that
<Q>“This <HI>Mosaick</HI> Cre∣ation, I say, is not a Nice and Philosophical Account of the Origin of all Things; but an Historical and True Representation of the Formation of our single Earth out of that confused Chaos, and of the successive and visible Changes thereof each Day, or Year, till it became fit for the Habitation of Man∣”kind.</Q>
Now as to this Matter, I have entirely prevented my self in my Preface to the <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>; wherein I have at large Discoursed thereof; and I hope, in good Mea∣sure, to the Satisfaction of the Learned and In∣quisitive; whither therefore I must in this Place refer my Readers. Only I shall desire them to reflect here upon a few Things in Na∣tural Knowledge thereto relating, which are peculiarly suitable to my present Purpose; as highly confirming the Truth of the Sacred, or <HI>Mosaick</HI> History of the Creation. The Things
<PB N="140" REF="181"/>
I mean are these Four; First Nature does now exhibit to us such a <HI>Chaos</HI> as that History sup∣poses, for the Fund and Promptuary of our Earth; which till lately the World could not know, but by Revelation: Secondly, Nature does now shew the Possibility of the greater Length of the Periods, or Days of Creation, than those of our ordinary Days, without which no Natural and Rational Account could be gi∣ven of that Creation; and this consistently with the Letter of <HI>Moses</HI>, that those Periods were still, strictly speaking, <HI>Days</HI> at the same Time: Thirdly, Nature does now so clearly shew the Impossibility of the <HI>Eternity</HI> of this System, and much more of this particular Earth, in its present State, as prepares the way for the Belief of that Sacred Account of its Original Creation: And Fourthly, Nature does so plainly shew the necessary Interest the Supreme Being has in all the ordinary Appearances of Nature, and in the Preservation of the several Worlds now in being, as much more implies his Interest in the first Original, and Primary Settlements of the same; and such as prepares us most easily to believe what <HI>Moses</HI> asserts of the Interposition of <HI>Divine Power</HI>, and <HI>Wisdom</HI>, and <HI>Goodness</HI>, in that whole Affair. These Observations deserve a peculiar Regard; and Astronomy does now, in these Respects, fully support and attest to the Sacred Accounts, thus reasonably understood, against all the opposite Notions of those igno∣rant or prejudic'd Philosophers, who pretended to give different Accounts of such Matters; and especially against those Two Famous Antiscrip∣tural Hypotheses of the <HI>Eternity</HI> of Things; and of their Original from meer <HI>Chance</HI> and
<PB N="141" REF="182"/>
<HI>Accident</HI>; both which, as we have already shewn, are entirely confuted, and rendred not only incredible, but ridiculous, from the pre∣sent Knowledge we have of the true System of the Universe. I observe,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) That the Sacred <HI>Chronology</HI>, or Scripture Account of the Antiquity of the World, and its Duration since the Deluge, is right, and agree∣able, not only to the most certain Remains of Ancient Prophane History, but to the best Methods which Nature and Philosophy afford us for the Discovery of the same. I mean not only, that it appears from the true System of the World, that neither the Whole, nor any Parts of the same, can have been strictly <HI>ab aeterno</HI>, in their present Condition, of which before; but that the Antiquity of our present Earth, and its Inhabitants, whether taken from Ancient Pro∣phane Tradition, and History, or from the Phae∣nomena of Nature, does best agree to the Sacred Accounts, which make it nearly 6000, or 7000 Years Old, and not more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philos. Transact. No. 346.</NOTE> Now as to this Matter, I must own that a Person of very great Sagacity, has lately advanc'd a contrary Notion, from the Degree of Saltness of our present Ocean, compar'd with the Length of Time which he supposes necessary, according to his own Hypothesis, to bring it to that Degree. Whence he seems to think it to be much longer, not only than the Scripture Account of the Time since the Deluge; beyond which, I should think it in vain to extend any such Calculations; but much longer than the Time since the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Creation it self, as delivered in the same Scrip∣ture; unless we extend the Duration of the Days of Creation to an immense Length, with∣out
<PB N="142" REF="183"/>
any Authority for so doing. But then, this Person allows all this to be built on an Hypo∣thesis, an uncertain Hypothesis, of the Origin of the Saltness of the Ocean; and he allows that such Trials have not been made, nor in∣deed are now possible to be made, as are neces∣sary even on this Hypothesis, to determine that Duration, in this or several future Ages. So that at the bottom the whole is, by his own Concessions, very uncertain, and only built on some <HI>Suspicions</HI>, which it cannot be now known whether they have any Foundation in Nature or not. In which Case, by the way, it had been but reasonable to avoid the giving any Intimations to weaken the Sacred Chrology, unless there had been some real or sure Evidence against it; which yet is not here pretended to. However, leaving this Notion, as not yet wor∣thy of a direct Confutation, I venture to assert, that the best ways of Determination we now have of the Age of the World, whether from Prophane History, or the Phaenomena of Na∣ture, do very well agree to the Sacred Chro∣nology, and confirm us in the Belief that the Earth has not been in its present State above 6000 or 7000 Years; and that since the general Flood, there have scarce yet passed 5000 Years; according to the Sacred Chronology thereto relating. Now the best ways of know∣ing this Duration of the World, abstractedly from Scripture, seem to be these Five fol∣lowing: (1.) By Ancient Prophane Histories, directly relating to such Matters. (2.) By the Histories of the Beginning and Progress of Arts and Sciences. (3.) By the Accounts of the Origin and spreading of the several Colonies of
<PB N="143" REF="184"/>
Nations all over the World. (4.) By the pre∣sent Number of Mankind upon the Face of the Earth, compar'd with the best Computations we have of the Time necessary for such their Increase and Doubling. (5.) By the present State of the Celestial Motions, and Terrestrial Appearances, and the Length of Time necessary for any such Irregularities arising therein, as would be sensible to us. As to the former Four Methods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bochart Phaleg.</HI> L. C. J. <HI>Hale's</HI> Ori∣gination of Mankind. See <HI>Chro∣nol. Old Test.</HI> p. <HI>60. —68.</HI> Essay to re∣store the true Text of the <HI>O. T. p. 195— 219.</HI></NOTE> which justly pretend to the greatest Nicety, they are not proper for this Place; and they have been so fully examin'd already by others, or by my self elsewhere, and found so well to agree to the forementioned Inter∣vals, that I believe judicious Men must pro∣nounce upon the whole, they are considerable Attestations to this Sacred Chronology. But as to the last Method, the Consideration of the Celestial Motions, and Terrestrial Appearances, I do not know that they can determine to any Degree of Exactness, how long they have con∣tinued in their present State. Only thus far, that none of those Motions or Phaenomena do contradict the Sacred Accounts, and that they all shew that the World cannot have been very much older than those Accounts affirm. Thus the Moon's Menstrual Motion must be gradually stopped by the Aether, or fine Medium in which it revolves about the Earth: But then this is hitherto so perfectly Insensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Princip. <HI>2</HI>d Edit. p. <HI>481</HI></NOTE> that Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> seems to have been the first that dis∣covered any Occasion in Astronomy, for making the least Allowance for any Inequality in that Mo∣tion. Thus the Earth's and Moon's Annual Motion must be gradually retarded by the same Resistance; yet so small has this hitherto been,
<PB N="144" REF="185" MS="y"/>
that the Astronomers have not yet observed it. Thus the Consequence of the Retardation of the Earth's Diurnal Motion; which must also in length of Time arise from the same Resistance, would be the receding of the Sea from the Dry Land in the Torrid, and its overflowing it in the Frigid Zones:] Unless the Earth be fluid within, and so accommodates it self to such Alterations] which is not yet in the least observable. Thus the Fluids of our Earth are found gradually to diminish; yet is this so very inconsiderable hi∣therto, as no way to be distinctly found by any inconveniences arising from it. Thus the Moun∣tains do, for certain, wash away, and are dimi∣nish'd; and the Valleys receive what the others lose, and are augmented: Yet do not we hither∣to observe any notable Inequalities arising therefrom. In short, all such defects, decays, or irregularities, which must in length of Time, according to the settled Laws of Nature, arise in our present Constitution, appear to have been hitherto so very small and inconsiderable, since the beginning of this Settlement, that we have thereby certain Evidence that its Age cannot be very much greater; and no Evidence that it is at all greater than what is contain'd in the Satred Chronology. Which Thing, how con∣siderable a Confirmation it is of that Chrono∣logy, I leave to the Impartial to determine. I observe,</P>
<P N="4">(4.) That the Sacred Accounts of the Muta∣tion from the <HI>Paradisiacal State</HI> before, to the <HI>Antediluvium one</HI>, after the Fall of Man, is agreeable to the State of Nature, and the true Frame of the World. That God, when he first made Man upon this Earth, placed him in
<PB N="145" REF="186"/>
Paradise; that He there gave him a Law for the Tryal of his Obedience; that Man did trans∣gress that Law; that this Transgression was oc∣casion'd by the Temptation of the Old Serpent the Devil and Satan; and by the first Compli∣ance of the Wife, and by her Persuasion of her Husband; that they were thereupon cast out of Paradise, and the happy State of Nature was much altered for the worse; that the Serpent was accursed, and subjected at last to the Pow∣er of the Seed of the Woman; that the Ground was also cursed, and made to bring forth Thorns and Bryars, and not to bring forth its Fruit without the extraordinary Toil and Sweat of Mankind; that the Female should be in greater Subjection to the Male than otherwise she should have been, and than many other Females now are; that she should have greater Sorrow in the Con∣ception and Bearing of her Offspring than other∣wise she should have had, and than any other Females now have; and that ever afterwards the Race of Men should have also such a Sense of Shame, or <HI>pudor circa res venereas</HI>, as they had not before, and as is not in other Animals; and withal more constant Inclinations that way than those Animals have; all which has come to pass accordingly, as standing Memori∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of the Truth of this Ancient History of the Original State and Circumstances of Mankind: For all this we have not only these natural Tokens, but the certain Affirmation of the <HI>Mosaick</HI> History, as all along supposed and confirmed in the Heathen Traditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Gen. i, ii, iii.</P>
<P><HI>See t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Commenta∣tors there.</HI></P></NOTE> and in the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Revelations, as has been shewn by others. But then, what the <HI>Altera∣tion</HI> in the State of the Earth and of Nature
<PB N="146" REF="187"/>
could be, the Philosophy and Astronomy of former Ages was utterly at a Loss to determine, till upon the Consideration of that Matter, and the Comparison of Scripture and Nature, now better understood, together, I discovered that the commencing of the Earth's Diurnal Rotati∣on, not at the beginning of the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Crea∣tion, but after the Earth's compleat Formation, and after the Fall of Man, would give the Best, the most Rational, and Philosophical Account of this Alteration of all other; and I discovered, that this later Time of its Commencement would best agree, not only with the Sacred Ac∣counts, but with the Ancient Profane Traditi∣ons, and with the present Phaenomena of Na∣ture also. All which I have long ago discoursed of in my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>; to which I must therefore refer my Reader for satisfacti∣on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. iii. <HI>p.</HI> 85.118.</NOTE> Only I shall desire him in particular to take notice of what is there especially insisted on under this Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 109, 110.</NOTE> and which is peculiarly pro∣per to my present Purpose, and that is, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Inferences from the Variation of the Needle's Declination from the <HI>North</HI>, and of Mine from the <HI>Mosaick</HI> History of the Crea∣tion and Fall of Man, relating to the Time and Circumstances of this Commencement of the Earth's Diurnal Revolution; and thence to ob∣serve how exactly they both agree together. Nor shall I enlarge farther here upon that whole Matter, but leave it entirely to the Determina∣tion of the Judicious. I observe,</P>
<P N="5">(5.) That the Sacred Accounts of the <HI>Uni∣versal Deluge</HI>, in the Days of <HI>Noah</HI>, is exactly agreeable to the State of Nature, and to the true Frame of the Universe also. Indeed the Solution
<PB N="147" REF="188" MS="y"/>
of this most remarkable Phaenomenon of an <HI>Universal Deluge</HI>, with its most numerous and eminent Circumstances, as described in the <HI>Mo∣saick</HI> History, which till this Age could no way be solved in a Natural way, nay seem'd utterly uncapable of any Philosophical Solution at all; is now, I think, become so plain, evident, and certain, from the Phaenomena of Comets, with their Atmospheres and Tails, now fully disco∣vered, especially from the particular Circum∣stances and Periods of the last most famous Comet of 168<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/1, which appears to have been the Physical Cause of the same Deluge: I say, the Solution of these wonderful Phaenomena,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See that Sheet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere at the End.</NOTE> as gi∣ven in the later Editions of my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>, with its additional Sheet, is become now so plain, evident, and certain, that I own I cannot but be my self very much surprized and satisfy'd with it, and equally surprized and satisfy'd with that strong Confirmation it affords to the Sacred Records, in one of the least pro∣bable, or most exceptionable Branches thereof. This is too large a Subject to be duly treated of in this Place. But I beg of the Inquisitive Reader, that he will carefully weigh the very probable Solution I long since gave of that De∣luge of <HI>Noah</HI>, from the Approach of a Comet, before I so much as hoped for the Knowledge of that very Comet which did so approach to it, and did cause the same; and that he will con∣sider the strong additional Evidence since arisen from the knowledge of that very Comet which did certainly approach to us on or about that very Year, and on or about that very Day of the Year, when the Sacred and Profane Accounts agree that Deluge began. If this be not satis∣factory
<PB N="148" REF="189"/>
Evidence in such a Case, I do not well know what Evidence will be so esteem'd. For my self, I must profess, that while I look on the Solution of the other Phaenomena under this Chapter as remarkahle enough, and com∣monly not a little probable also; I cannot but look on the Solution of the Deluge by that very Comet, which I my self saw <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680, 1681, to be in a manner certain; and by Consequence I cannot but esteem the Evidence thence ari∣sing, for the Truth of the Sacred History in this important Case, exceeding strong and satisfactory. Nor do I think, that so unexpected and emi∣nent an Attestation, as that of the Circumstances and Period of this Comet, for solving the De∣luge, lately discovered, most certainly is, has ever happened to any so strange an Hypothesis before, since the World began; which Thing cannot but be highly pleasing to my self; and I think is highly worthy of the Observation of others also. I observe,</P>
<P N="6">(6.) That the Sacred Accounts of the <HI>Invi∣sible World</HI>, or of good Angels, and wicked Dae∣mons, their Places and Ministrations, is ex∣actly agreeable to the true System and Phaeno∣mena of Nature. Now that the Sacred and Prophane Accounts, and the Histories of all Nations and Ages, do suppose and inform us, that besides the Supreme Invisible Deity, be∣sides the Visible Material World of Bodies, and besides the Invisible and Incorporeal World of Souls or Spirits, inhabiting in Visible and Gross Bodies, there are also another Spe∣cies of Beings belonging to our System: I mean, those Souls, or Spiritual Beings, who are either wholly free from Bodies,
<PB N="149" REF="190"/>
or rather free from such Gross and Visible Bodies as we have, but inhabit ordinarily in purer and more etherial Regions, in more sub∣tle and aerial Bodies or Vehicles; who are In∣visible generally, and Intangible to our gross Senses, but not wholly Incorporeal, or uncon∣cerned with us and our Affairs here below; that, I say, the Ancient, Sacred and Prophane Ac∣counts, and Histories, do assure us of the Exi∣stence of these Species of Beings, every body that has ever read either Ancient or Modern Books, cannot deny or doubt. But that pre∣sent Nature does at all favour these Accounts, and that we can give the least Evidence from the Phaenomena of the World, of their Being, or Place of Abode, or Influence here below, is what is not generally pretended to by even the Christian Philosophers. Now in this Case I shall venture a Step farther, and shall here set down such Observations from Nature and Astronomy, as seem to me to favour this Ac∣count of the Invisible World. Accordingly I observe, (1.) That Nature does as fully allow of the Existence of Spiritual and Invisible Be∣ings <HI>out</HI> of gross Bodies, as <HI>in</HI> them. Nor can those who are convinc'd by the Phaenomena of Animals, both Irrational and Rational, that they are compounded of Immaterial and Invi∣sible Souls, as well as of Material and Visible Bodies, as we have already discours'd, at all scruple the Existence of such Spiritual and In∣visible Souls, either by themselves, or united to much finer Bodies than those of our gross Ani∣mals here below. I observe, (2.) That Nature does favour the Existence of such Creatures, by shewing us such large and noble Regions of the
<PB N="150" REF="191"/>
World, as best of all suit the Habitation of such Beings; and which, if there be not such Beings, seem, contrary to the usual Case of the other Parts of the System, to be wholly desti∣tute of Inhabitants: I mean all the wide Spaces of the Atmospheres of the Planets, especially those still, calm, clear, and aethereal Regions of the same which are above the Clouds, and Storms, and Disorders of their lowest Parts. Nature, as we still find, abounds in all proper Places with Living Creatures, not only on the Earth, or dry Land, but within the Earth, and Waters, and lowest Air, every where; all made to enjoy their Creator's Bounty, and to be ser∣viceable to other Beings Superior to them∣selves. What Reason can there then be to sup∣pose that this Air, the noblest Fluid in the Universe, even in its purest and most Celestial Parts, should be destitute of Living Inhabitants; which yet it must be, in case we exclude those <HI>Invisible Powers</HI> above-mentioned. Now, in order to shew how little Prejudice to the Exi∣stence of such Beings, that Circumstance of their being <HI>Invisible</HI>, ought here to be; I ob∣serve, (3.) That whatever proper Inhabitants the Air has, their very Bodies ought to be <HI>Invisible</HI>, because the Air it self, whereof we may suppose them made, is ever so. This is the wonderful Property of Air, strictly speaking, and that Property, which among all Corporeal Beings, otherwise sensible, seems al∣most peculiar to it, that it is ever, upon the ut∣most Condensation possible, absolutely to us <HI>In∣visible</HI>. Whence 'tis no wonder that all such Be∣ings as live in it, and perhaps take their Bodies from it, how real or powerful so ever, are
<PB N="151" REF="192"/>
likewise ordinarily <HI>Invisible</HI> to us. I observe, (4.) That the known Phaenomena of our Air seem in a peculiar Manner, to require and suppose the Existence and Agency of such In∣visible Beings therein, as we are here speaking of; and cannot be fairly and mechanically solv'd without them. This I have particularly taken Notice of, in my Account of the un∣usual Meteors lately seen in our Air, to which I refer the Reader. Nor do I find that any other Philosophers are able to give us a better Account of those Aerial Phaenomena,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr.</HI> Halley<HI>'s Account of this</HI> Phae∣nomenon, Transact. Philosoph. <HI>No.</HI> 34.7.</NOTE> without that Hypothesis. So I cannot but conclude, that the Appearances of Nature do in this, as well as in other Cases, attest to what Disco∣veries Divine Revelation has made relating thereto: And that there are Good and Bad Spirits in the Air, in our Neighbourhood, ready to perform what the Sacred Writings ascribe to them. As to the other Place allotted for certain to some, now to us, Invisible Beings, in Scripture, I mean <HI>in the Heart of the Earth</HI>; I have already made it probable from Natural Philosophy, that the Heavenly Bodies have such mighty Cavities within, as are the proper Receptacles for some such Beings; and shall not need here to enlarge on that Subject; especially since it will come again to be consi∣dered under the Tenth Particular hereafter. I observe,</P>
<P N="7">(7.) That the Sacred Accounts of the Future <HI>Conflagration</HI> of the World, is exactly agreeable to the true System of the Universe. Now this Conflagration of the upper Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. i.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2 Pet. iii.2, 10.</NOTE> and all that is upon it, according to the Discoveries made by Divine Revelation, is so natural, or rather
<PB N="152" REF="193"/>
necessary a Consequence of the Approach of a Comet to a Planet, when it has just been broil∣ed in the Sun's Rays, which Astronomy now knows to be not only possible, but, in the course of Time, sometimes certain; and I have so fully prevented my self upon this Head in my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 440,-449.</NOTE> that I shall not need to enlarge upon it here: I only beg of the Inquisi∣tive Reader to observe, That the Two grand Ca∣tastrophes which the Scriptures certainly make our Earth alone subject to, I mean a <HI>Deluge</HI>, and a <HI>Conflagration</HI>, are those Two Catastrophes, and those Two only which the true System of the world shews such Planets to be naturally liable to: Which Observation, how great a Con∣firmation it is of the Truth and Divine Original of those Scriptures, I leave to every Reader's own serious Consideration. I observe,</P>
<P N="8">(8.) That the Sacred Accounts of the <HI>Renova∣tion of things</HI>, and of the <HI>Resurrection of the Body</HI>, are very agreeable to some known Phae∣nomena of Nature. That the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Renovation</HI>, not utter <HI>Destruction</HI> of the World, may be the Natural and Regular Consequence of that <HI>Conflagration</HI> we have been lately speak∣ing of, I have particularly shew'd towards the End of my <HI>New Theory</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi suprà.</NOTE> and shall not need to repeat it in this Place. But that the very <HI>Re∣surrection of the Body</HI> should have any thing properly to countenance it, or resemble it in Nature, will not be easily believ'd. Yet do I look upon those Changes which are made in the Bodies of not a few Insects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr.</HI> Derham's Physico-Theology.</NOTE> as particularly in the Silkworm; while still upon the most sur∣prizing Mutations in the Body, the same Life or Soul is the Inhabitant within; as no ill Re∣semblances
<PB N="153" REF="194" MS="y"/>
of, or Preludes to, the nobler Won∣der of the Resurrection of Human Bodies. I mean this, as we thence learn, how very different Forms and States the same Creature can natu∣rally put on, without being really another Crea∣ture: Just as the Christian Religion informs us the Souls of Men must undergo in the seve∣ral Conditions or Periods (1.) Of this gross Earthly Body now. (2.) Of the Aereal Ve∣hicle in the intermediate State. And (3.) Of the Spiritual Body after the Resurrection. Nor should we our selves have been able to believe such Mutations in the same Insects to be true, unless continual Experience did assure us there∣of: as neither does the Christian Religion ex∣pect the Belief of the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Consti∣tut. Apost. <HI>v.7.</HI></NOTE> but upon the At∣testation of Him who made all those mutable Creatures, with Man also, who is to undergo those other more important Mutations.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) I observe, that the Sacred Account of the future <HI>Consummation of all Things</HI>, is agreeable to the true System of the Universe. What I here mean is that particular and final Catastrophe of our Earth, spoken of by St. <HI>John</HI> in his <HI>Re∣velation</HI>, where he informs us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. xx.11.</NOTE> that <HI>He saw a great white Throne, and Him that sat on it; from whose Face the Earth and the Heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them:</HI> Or when a final Period is to be put to the pre∣sent Place and Use of this Earth, with its Atmo∣sphere. Now that this Catastrophe may natu∣rally and regularly befal our Earth, or any of the Planets, according to the true System of the World, and without a Miracle, I have already observ'd in the last Proposition of my <HI>New Theory</HI>. Nor can any one that knows how a
<PB N="154" REF="195"/>
Comet may regularly strike against a Planet in its Course, and thereby remove it from its pre∣sent Station, into an Orbit of a quite different Situation, Nature, and Use, from what it now has, make any difficulty at all in believing this, <HI>viz.</HI> that there will be at last, a <HI>Consummation of all Things</HI> belonging to this Sublunary World, according as the Inspired Writer has delivered it to us. I observe,</P>
<P N="10">(10.) That the Sacred Accounts of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or of the <HI>Place of departed Souls</HI>, in the intermediate State before the Resurrection, is very agreeable to the true Frame of the Universe. That <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the Place of departed Souls, till the Resur∣rection, is either in the Air, or in the Heart of the Earth, seems to me the Importance of all the Ancient and Sacred Records we have of that Matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Ap∣pendix to M. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lect. or my Serm and Essays. P. <HI>170-178.</HI></NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> they seem to me to imply, that some of them are at liberty in the Air, and others imprison'd in the Earth; which two Places we have shewn to be, Philosophically speaking, the only fit Places for their Habitation also. So that hitherto Nature and Scripture seem to me entirely to agree, and to bear Witness mutually to each other in these Matters.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) I observe, that the Sacred Accounts of <HI>Heaven</HI>, or of the Place and State of Happiness for Good Men before the Consummation of all Things, is not only agreeable to the Remains of Ancient Profane Tradition, but to the true Sy∣stem of the World also.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. xxxvi. 9. Colos. i. 12. Luc. vi. 23. 1 Thess. iv.17.</NOTE> This happy State is describ'd in Scripture to be a <HI>State of Light</HI>, a <HI>Reward in Heaven</HI>, and introduc'd by Good Men's <HI>meeting the Lord in the Air</HI>; and so <HI>be∣ing ever with the Lord</HI>. Which if it be after the Conflagration, as seems not improbable,
<PB N="155" REF="196"/>
will belong to a more pure and purged State of our Air or Heaven than what we now enjoy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xv. 42, 43.</NOTE> which will well agree to such <HI>Glorious</HI> and <HI>Spiri∣tual</HI>, and <HI>Uncorrupt</HI> Bodies as Good Men are to have at that Time. Wherefore, as we have al∣ready seen, that the Air in its present State, both according to Nature and Scripture, is one proper Place for Invisible Beings, those I mean that inhabit Aerial Bodies, so may it by the <HI>purifying Fire</HI> of the Conflagration be so meli∣orated as to be a proper Place for the Habita∣tion of the Pious, with their Spiritual Bodies also, till the Consummation of all Things. For as to the State and Place of Happiness after that Consummation, I do not know that the Sacred Writings afford us any particular Light about it; and so I shall not presume to indulge my self in any groundless Conjectures thereto relating; as content with this exact Agree∣ment of Nature and Scripture till this grand Period of our World, which seems to me to be the Grand Period of those Sacred Books also.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) I observe, that the Sacred Accounts of <HI>Hell</HI>, or of the Place and State of Punishment for wicked Men after the general Resurrection, is agreeable not only to the Remains of ancient profane Tradition, but to the true System of the World also. This sad State is in Scripture describ'd as a State of <HI>Darkness</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. viii. 12. Jude 5.13. Mat. xxv. Luc. xvi. 24. Mat. viii. 12. Apoc. xiv.10, 11.</NOTE> of <HI>outward Darkness</HI>, of <HI>blackness of Darkness</HI>, of <HI>Tor∣ment</HI> and <HI>Punishment for Ages, or for Ages of Ages, by Flame</HI>, or <HI>by Fire</HI>, or <HI>by Fire and Brim∣stone, with Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth</HI>; where <HI>the Smoak of the</HI> Ungodly's <HI>Torment ascends up for ever and ever</HI>; where they are Tormented <HI>in the Presence of the Holy Angels,
<PB N="156" REF="197"/>
and in the Presence of the Lamb;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xiii.49, 50.</NOTE> <HI>when the Holy Angels shall have separated the Wicked from among the Just, and have cast them into a Furnace of Fire</HI>. Now this Description does in every Circumstance, so exactly agree with the Nature of a Comet, ascending from the Hot Regions near the Sun, and going into the Cold Regions beyond <HI>Saturn</HI>, with its long smoaking Tail arising up from it, through its several Ages or Periods of revolving, and this in the Sight of all the Inhabitants of our Air, and of the rest of the System; that I cannot but think the Surface or Atmosphere of such a Comet to be that <HI>Place of Torment</HI> so terribly described in Scripture, into which the Devil and his An∣gels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. ii.4. Jud. v.6. Apoc. xx.14.</NOTE> with wicked Men their Companions, when delivered out of their <HI>Prison</HI> in the Heart of the Earth, shall be cast for their utter <HI>Perdi∣tion</HI> or <HI>second Death</HI>; which will be indeed a terrible but a most useful Spectacle to the rest of God's rational Creatures; and will admonish them above all Things to preserve their Inno∣cence and Obedience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. x.28.

God thundreth marvellously with his Voice; great Things doth he, which we cannot com∣prehend. For he saith to the Snow, Be thou on the Earth; likewise to the small Rain, and to the great Rain of his Strength. He sealeth up the Hand of every Man, that all Men may know his Work. Then the Beasts go into Dens, and remain in their Places. Out of the <HI>South</HI> cometh the Whirlwind: and Cold out of the <HI>North</HI>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.20.</NOTE><HI>Author of the Recognitions.</HI>] But somebody may say, that these things are done by <HI>Nature</HI>. Now in this case the Contention is only about a Word. For while 'tis certain that the World is the Work of a Mind, and of Reason, what you call <HI>Nature</HI> I call <HI>God the Creator</HI>. And clear it is, that neither formerly nor now could it be, that either the Species of Bo∣dies, adorn'd with such necessary Distinctions or the Faculties of the Mind, should be made by any Labour, without Reason, and without Sense. And now, if you look on the Philosophers as proper Witnesses in this case, <HI>Plato</HI> gives us his Testimony in his <HI>Timaeus;</HI> where in his dis∣cussion of this Question, about the Frame of the World, Whether it always was, or had a Be∣ginning, he pronounces that it was made. For, says he, 'tis visible, palpable, and corporeal; and all things of that Nature were certainly made. Now what was made, has without question some Author by whom it was made. But then, as he adds, To discover this Maker and Parent of all Things, is no easy thing; and when you have discover'd him, to impart your discovery to the vulgar, is plainly impossible. These are certainly <HI>Plato</HI>'s words. But suppo∣sing that he and the other Philosophers among the <HI>Greeks</HI> had been dispos'd to say nothing about the making of the World, would it not still be a plain case to all that had common Un∣derstanding? For what Man is there, I mean one of at least some small Capacity, who upon the sight of an House with all its Furniture fit∣ted for Mens various Necessities, whose Top is
<PB N="181" REF="222"/>
adorn'd with a spherical Cupolo, beautify'd with variety of splendid Draughts and several sorts of Pictures, and adorn'd with the fairest and largest Lights; who is there, I say, that upon the view of such a Fabrick will not im∣mediately pronounce that it was fram'd by a most wise and most powerful Architect? And can any one be found so foolish, as upon the sight of the Work of Heaven, and the view of the splendor of the Sun and Moon, the regular Course of the Stars, with their various Kinds and Motions, and that sees all determin'd by proper Laws, and to suitable Periods; to for∣bear to cry out, that these things were made by a wise and rational Artificer, or rather by Wis∣dom and Reason it self?</P>
<P>But now if you desire to be a Follower of others of the <HI>Greek</HI> Philosophers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.21.</NOTE> and are vers'd in Mechanicks, what they deliver about these Celestial things must have certainly come to your knowledge: For they suppose that the Heavens are like a Sphere, on every side evenly situate, and having the same respect to every part, and equally distant from the Center of the Earth; and that therefore they stand so firm by the equality of their Libration, that the evenness of their Situation does not allow them to bend any one way more than another; and that by this means the Sphere is sustain'd with∣out any prop to support it. Now if this Ma∣chine of the World bears really this Simili∣tude, there is a clear demonstration of Divine Workmanship therein. But if, as others sup∣pose, this spherical Arch is supported by the Waters; either as it floats on their Surface, or as it turns round within them, even on those
<PB N="182" REF="223"/>
Hypotheses the Workmanship of the great Ar∣tificer is manifested therein.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.22.</NOTE>But lest the Arguments of this kind, which all are not capable to understand, should seem of an uncertain nature, let us proceed to such as every one can comprehend. Who is it that has order'd the Courses of the Stars with so great Judgment, and appointed their times of Rising and Setting, and ordain'd every one of them to hold its course in the Heavens in cer∣tain and fix'd Periods? Who is it that has per∣mitted some of them to go always Westward, and others to return sometimes Eastward? Who is it that has fix'd Limits to the Courses of the Sun, that he might determine Hours, and Days, and Months, and the Vicissitudes of Seasons by its different Motions; and by the sure adjust∣ment of its Course distinguish those Seasons in∣to Winter first, then the Spring, after that the Summer, and Autumn; so as still to determine the annual Period by the same Revolutions? Who is there, I say, but must pronounce the Divine Wisdom it self to be the Manager of so regular a System? And so much for that Hy∣pothesis which the <HI>Greeks</HI> have form'd about the System of the Heavens.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.23.</NOTE>What also can be said to those Appearances which belong to the Land and to the Sea? Are not we plainly taught by them, that God did not only make these Parts of the World, but that he exercises a Providence over them also? For therefore are there high Mountains in some certain Places in every part of the World, that the Air which is, as it were, compress'd and straiten'd by them, may, according to the ap∣pointment of God, be crowded and forc'd out
<PB N="183" REF="224"/>
for Winds; whereby the Fruits grow, and the Heat of Summer is temper'd, at the time when the warm <HI>Plciades</HI> are heated by the fierceness of the Sun. But you will say, why was there such an intense Heat in the Sun at all, which should require to be temper'd? Pray how could the Fruits of the Earth, which are so necessary for the Uses of Mankind, be ripen'd without it? Besides, take notice of another Thing, that near the <HI>Equator</HI>, where the greatest Heat is, there is no great compression of the Clouds; nor does any mighty quantity of Rain fall there, leet it should breed Diseases among the Inhabitants. For moist Clouds, if they be as it were bak'd with an intense Heat, do render the Air corrupt and Pestilential. As also the Earth, when it re∣ceives over-warm Rain, does not afford Nourish∣ment to the Corn, burt destroys it. Which Ma∣nagement who can doubt but 'tis the Effect of the Divine Providence? To conclude with the Case of <HI>Egypt</HI>, which because 'tis near the burn∣ing Heat of <HI>Ethiopia</HI>, and so if it stood in abso∣lute Necessiry of Rain, would have its Air into∣lerably corrupted; its Fields are therefore sup∣ply'd, not by Rain, which is deriv'd from the Clouds; but they enjoy a kind of terrestrial Rain, by the Inundations of the <HI>Nile</HI>.</P>
<P>What is also to be said about the Fountains and Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.24.</NOTE> which run with a constant Current into the Sea? and yet all is so fitted by the Di∣vine Providence, that those Rivers do not want a plentiful Current of Water; and yet that the Sea, which receives such vast Quantities of Wa∣ter, seems not to be augmented; but those Ele∣ments continue in the same Proportion, both those which carry, and those which receive that
<PB N="184" REF="225"/>
Supply of Water: the salt Water still naturally consuming the sweet Streams mixed with it. Herein therefore the Effects of Providence are manifest, that it should make that Element Salt whereto the Course of all those Waters which it had afforded for the Uses of Men, was to carry them; that so the full Cavity of the Sea might never, in all the Series of Ages, bring upon the Earth and upon Men, any fatal Inun∣dation of Waters. And there is no Man so foolish to suppose so great an Instance of Reason and of Providence could be taken care of by any irrational Nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.25.</NOTE>What shall I say about Plants and about Ani∣mals? Is it not the Effect of Providence, that when they are to be dissolv'd by Old Age, the Plants should be repair'd again, either by young Plants, or by Seeds, which proceed from them∣selves; and the Animals by the Propagation of Posterity? And indeed, 'tis by the surprizing Conduct of Providence, that Milk is provided in the Breasts against the time when the Young one is born, and that the same young one, as soon as 'tis born, without any Instructor, knows where to look for the Places wherein its Nou∣rishment is laid up for it. And then Males as well as Females are brought forth; that by the means of both, Posterity may be provided for. But now lest, as Men are ready to imagine, these Events might seem to happen according to some fix'd Course of Nature, and not by the Dispensation of the Creator, he ordain'd that some few Creatures should propagate their Kind upon Earth after a different manner, for an In∣dication and Sign of his Providence: That for Example, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">A few of these Ex∣amples, which were generally be∣liev'd in the Days of our Author, are now sou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have been Mistakes; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t so that a vast <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of others, of equal or greater Force, have been since <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> the Raven should bring forth her
<PB N="185" REF="226"/>
Young at the Mouth, and the Weezle propagate at the Ear; that some sort of Fowls, as Hens, should bring forth Eggs, addle either by the Wind or the Dust; that some other Creatures should change the Male by Turns, into the Fe∣male, and every Year alter their Sex; as Hares and the Hyaenae, which they call Monsters; that some should arise out of the Earth, and take thence their Flesh, as Moles; others out of Ashes, as Vipers; others out of putrify'd Flesh, as Wasps out of the Flesh of Horses, and Bees out of that of Kine; others out of Cows Dung, as Beetles; others out of Herbs, as the Scorpion out of <HI>Basil</HI>; and on the contrary, thar Herbs should spring out of Animals, as Smallage and Asparagus out of the Horn of a Stag or of a Roe-Buck.</P>
<P>And indeed to what Purpose should I recken up more Examples wherein the Divine Provi∣dence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.26.</NOTE> by changing that Course which is sup∣pos'd to be appointed by Nature, has in many Respects varied the Circumstances of the Birth of Animals? Whereby might be shew'd not any irrational Course of Things, but God the Di∣sposer of all Things might rationally be demon∣strated. Is there not also in another Instance, a compleat Demonstration of the Workmanship of Divine Providence? In that I mean, when Seeds that are sown are repair'd for the Uses of Human Life? Which Seeds when they are committed to the Ground, the Soil, by the Will of God, affords them that Moisture it has receiv'd, as if it were Milk for their Nou∣rishment. For there is in the Waters a certain Power of the Spirit of God, which was afforded them at the beginning, by whos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Efficiency the
<PB N="186" REF="227"/>
entire future Body begins to be form'd in the very Seed, and to be restor'd again by its Stem and its Ear: For when a grain of the Seeds is swell'd by the Moisture, that Power of the Spi∣rit which was bestow'd on the Waters, and being incorporeal easily runs through certain narrow Channels of the Veins, invigorates the Seeds till they grow larger, and frames the Species of them as they grow. It comes to pass therefore that by the Means of the moist Element, where∣in this vital Spirit is ever inserted and implant∣ed, that not only the Corn is repair'd in gene∣ral, but that it returns again, as to its Species and Form, entirely like those Seeds which were sow'd. Which Regularity of Operation, who that has the least Sense can believe to be thus perform'd by an irrational Nature, and not by the Divine Wisdom? To conclude, Even these Things are form'd after the similitude of a Human Birth; for the Earth appears to retain the Place of the Womb, where the Seed when it is cast into it, is form'd and nourish'd by the Power of Water and of the Spirit, as we have said already.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.27.</NOTE>Moreover, the Divine Providence is herein also to be admir'd, that it has order'd all, so that we can indeed see and know what is made; but how, and after what manner it is made, is hidden and conceal'd from us; that they may not be discoverable by those that are unworthy, but may be disclos'd to such as are worthy and faithful, and have merited such a Favour. Now that we may prove by Experiments and Instan∣ces, that the Seeds do not receive any Part of the Terrene Matter, but are made up entirely of the Element of Water, and of the Virtue of
<PB N="187" REF="228"/>
that Spirit which is included therein; Do you suppose, for Example's Sake, that the Weight of an Hundred Talents of Earth were put into a large Vessel; and the several Kinds of Seeds were sow'd therein, either of Herbs, or of larger Plants; and that they had a sufficient Quantity of Water to moisten them; and let this Process be continued several Years. And then let the Grain which has sprung from them, suppose of Wheat or Barley, or of any other sort, be ga∣ther'd together, every Year's Product by it self, till the Heap of every Kind of Grain is arisen to the Weight of an Hundred Talents. Then let the Trees themselves be pluck'd up, and weigh'd; and when they are all taken out of the Vessel, yet will the Earth it self, when it is weigh'd, afford you its entire original Hundred Talents again notwithstanding. Whence then shall we say that all that Weight, and all that Quantity of different Sorts of Grain, and of the Trees has arisen? Is it not plain that 'tis from the Water? For the Earth retains its own en∣tirely, while the Water which was poured on every one of them, wholly disappears; and all this by the powerful Efficacy of the Divine Disposal of the Creator, which by the very Element of Water both repairs the Substances, and frames the Species of such Seeds and Plants, and preserves their Species with great In∣crease.</P>
<P>From all which Instances I think it is abun∣dantly evident to all Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.28.</NOTE> that all Things are made, and every Thing does subsist by the Skill of a wise Being, and not by the Opera∣tion of Brutal Nature. But now let us proceed if you please, to our own Constitution, or that
<PB N="188" REF="229"/>
of a Man, who is a little World included in the other: And let us consider with what Art he is compounded, and thereby you will see in an especial Manner the Wisdom of the Crea∣tor. Now though he be made up of different Substances, of that which is Mortal, and that which is Immortal, yet by the Skill and Provi∣dence of his Creator is it brought to pass that these different Substances, which are so widely remote one from the other, admit of an Union; For one Part is taken from the Earth, and fram'd by the Creator; while the other is deriv'd from the Immortal Sub∣stances. And yet is the Advantage of Im∣mortality not at all infring'd by such a Con∣junction. Nor is he made up of rational, and concupiscible, and irascible Parts; but such sorts of Faculties as those, are rather to be suppos'd Affections belonging to him; whereby he may be carried to those several sorts of Objects. For the Body, which con∣sists of Bones and Flesh, owes its Original to the Seed of the Male, which Heat fetches out of the Marrow, and consigns over to the Womb, as to a proper Soil, whereto it ad∣heres: And when it has by little and lit∣tle been moisten'd, by the flowing of the Blood to it, it becomes Flesh and Bones; and is made up after the Species of him who cast in the Seed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.29.</NOTE>Behold now the Contrivance of the Arti∣ficer herein! how he has inserted the Bones as certain Pillars, whereby the Flesh might be sustain'd and supported. Besides this, consider how a just Measure is preserv'd on both Sides; I mean on the right Side, and
<PB N="189" REF="230"/>
on the Left; so that one Foot agrees with the other, and one Hand with the other, one Set of Fingers with the other; that so every one of them might agree with his Fel∣low, without the least Inequality: Which is the Case also as to the one Eye with the other, and the one Ear with the other; which Members do not only resemble and agree with one another, but are also so fram'd, as to serve for the necessary Occasions of Life. The Hand, for Instance, is so dispos'd as to be fit for Work, the Feet for walking, the Eyes for seeing, as guarded by the Eye∣brows; the Ears are so fram'd for Hearing, that like a Drum they send the rebounding Sound of Words deep into the Head, and even as far as the Sensation of the Soul; as does the Tongue, when 'tis mov'd upon the Teeth, supply the Place of a Quill. Those Teeth also are so form'd, that some chew and divide the Food, and send it to others, who are more inward; and those Teeth that are more inward are so fram'd, that, like Milstones, they chew and break it small; that so it may be deliver'd to the Stomach in a state fit for Digestion. Whence it is that these Teeth have the Name of <HI>Grinders</HI> bestowed on them.</P>
<P>Besides these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.30.</NOTE> the Nostrils were made for the Passage of the Breath to and fro, in Ex∣piration and Inspiration; that the natural Heat which is in the Heart, may by the Ac∣cess of fresh Air, be heated or cooled by the Operation of the Lungs; which are there∣fore plac'd in the Breast, that by its Softness it may cherish and enliven the Heart, in whose
<PB N="190" REF="231"/>
vigorous State Life seems to consist. I say the Life, not the Soul. For what shall I say of the Substance of the Blood? Which is like a River, proceeding from a Fountain, which at first is carry'd along one Channel, but then is deriv'd farther by innumerable Veins, as by so many Pipes; and so waters the entire Soil of a human Body with vital Streams; whereto the Liver is also assisting, which is situate on the Right Side, for the more effectual Digestion of the Food, and its Conversion into Blood: While the Place of the Spleen is on the Left Side, that it may attract to it self, and after a sort cleanse the Blood of its Impurities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.31.</NOTE>As to the Contrivance of the Intestines, how wonderful is it! For therefore are they join'd together in long Foldings, like Cir∣cles, that they may leisurely throw off the Remains of the Food after Digestion; that so the Receptacles of the Nourishment may not be suddenly empty'd; and yet there may no Hindrance arise from the Food that is ta∣ken afterwards. But therefore are they con∣triv'd to be Membranaceous, that the Parts without them may by degrees receive from them their moist Nutriment; that so it may not go away at once, and leave the Bowels themselves empty; nor be hindred by the Thickness of the Skin, and leave the other Parts dry, and disorder thereby the whole Human Fabrick with inevitable Thirst.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.32.</NOTE>Moreover, who is there whom the Po∣sition of the Feminine Parts, and the Recep∣tacle of the Womb, most exactly fitted for
<PB N="191" REF="232"/>
receiving the <HI>Embryo</HI>, and for cherishing and quickning it, will not persuade that what was made was made by Reason and Prudence? That the Woman should only differ from the Man in those Parts whereby Posterity was to be provided for and secur'd? As also, that the Frame of the Man should be different from that of the Woman, in those Parts only wherein the Power of Semination and Gene∣ration does reside? And herein certainly there is an illustrious Testimony of Provi∣dence afforded us; I mean in this necessary Diversity of the Parts. But yet this Testi∣mony is stronger where we find an External Resemblance, and yet a Difference as to Use, and a Variety as to Operation. For so it is in the Paps, which are both in Men and Wo∣men; yet so that those of Women alone are capable to receive Milk, in order to the In∣fants finding a proper Nutriment as soon as it is Born. Now therefore, if we see the Mem∣bers dispos'd in Men with so great Skill, that while the Shape of all the other Parts is the same, those alone do admit of a Difference, wherein the several Uses require that Diver∣sity; and while there is nothing in a Man that is superfluous or wanting, nor any Thing in a Woman that is too little or too much; who is there that does not evidently con∣clude from all these Observations, that all is the Effect of Reason, and of the Wisdom of the Creator?</P>
<P>The same Thing is confirm'd by the agree∣able Diversity there is among other Ani∣mals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.33.</NOTE>
<PB N="192" REF="233"/>
every one of which are suited to their proper Use and Service. This is also con∣firm'd from the Variety there is in Trees; the Diversity there is in Herbs; with the Difference of their Species and Juices: As it is also from the Changes of the Seasons of the Year, as distinguish'd into Four Parts, one succeeding another; from the regular Succession of Hours, Days, and Months in the annual Period; which Period never exceeds its appointed Limits one single Hour. Hence, Lastly, is it that the Age of the World it self is to be estimated at a certain Number of Years, without any Va∣riation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.44.</NOTE>But you will say, When was the World made? And why so lately? This you might as well have pretended, though it had been made sooner; for you might still have said, Why not sooner yet? For when you had gone backwards never so many Ages, you might always ask, Why not sooner still? But we are not now discoursing of this Matter, Why it was not made sooner than it was made; but whether it were made at all or not. For if it fully appears to have been made, 'twas certainly the Work of a Power∣ful and Supreme Artificer: Which when it is once settled, we must leave it to the Dis∣posal and Judgment of the wise Artificer, when he thought fit to make it. Unless you will suppose, that all the Wisdom which fram'd this vast Structure of the World, and form'd all the distinct Sorts and Species of Beings, so as to dispose their Constitutions
<PB N="193" REF="234"/>
not only to be agreeable in Point of Beauty, but withal most suitable and necessary for the Uses they were to be put to afterward, was only uncapable of this one Thing; I mean of chusing a proper Time for the rearing so mag∣nificent a Building. Certainly he is not at a loss for sufficient Reasons, and evident Cau∣ses, why, and when, and how he would make the World; which were not surely to be reveal'd to Men, while they are scarce able to enquire after, and understand those Things that are before their Eyes, and are Testimonials of his Providence. For what is conceal'd in private, and is reposited within the wisest Understanding, as within a Royal Treasury, is disclos'd to none but to those who have learn'd from him with whom they are in∣trusted and reposited. 'Tis God therefore who made all Things, and was himself made by none. But for those that put the Name of <HI>Nature</HI>, for that of <HI>God</HI>; and so affirm, that all Things were made by <HI>Nature</HI>, they do not perceive the Mistake about that Appellation. For if they suppose this Nature to be Irra∣tional, 'tis egregious Folly to imagine that a Creation where Reason is so visible, should proceed from a Maker who is destitute of it. But if this Nature be Reason, or the Word, whereby 'tis evident all Things were made, they chuse another Name to no Purpose; while they profess that he that created them is endued with Reason.</P>

Now if there be supposed more such Beings, whereof some are better, some are worse; these could not be all Gods, because it is essential to GOD not to be transcended by any. But if they be conceiv'd to be so many equal Gods, then would it not be the Nature of GOD to be the Best: One Equal be∣ing neither better nor worse than another.

Nor do I deny, what <HI>Caecilius</HI> has taken so much pains <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prove, that Man must learn to know himself, and diligently examine his Nature, his Original, and the End of his Being; whether he was only a mere Concretion of the Elements, and thus admirably adjusted by blind Atoms; or made, and fashioned, and ani∣mated by God. But this we cannot apprehend without studying the World, and its Maker; for these Things are so closely connected and chain'd together, that you must diligently examine the Nature of God, before you can understand that of Man; nor can you ever be a good Citizen of the World, before this common City of us All, the World and You, are well acquainted; and certainly, since in this chiefly it is that we differ from Beasts, that whereas they are prone to Earth, and bent downward by Nature, and fram'd to look no farther than the good of their Bellies; yet Man is made erect and upright, and by that Make form'd for the Contemplation of Heaven, and has Language and Reason to conduct him to the Knowledge and Imitation of God; for a Creature so constituted to be igno∣rant of his Maker, to wink as hard as he can, that he may not see that Glorious Being that is thrusting in at his Eyes, and knocking for Ad∣mission at all his Senses, is the most inexcusable Ignorance imaginable. For 'tis most abominable Sacrilege to be Poring upon Earth, for that which you are only to find in Heaven. For which reason I can hardly think that such Men have the use of their Soul or Senses, no not of their very Eyes, who cannot see this glorious Machine of the Universe to be the Work of Di∣vine
<PB N="223" REF="264"/>
Wisdom, but dream that 'twas jumbled to∣gether by a fortuitous Concourse of Atoms. For what is so clear and undeniable, when you lift up your Eyes to Heaven, and when you look down upon all about you, than that there is a Deity of most excellent Understanding, that inspires, moves, supports, and governs all Na∣ture? Consider the vast Expanse of Heaven, and the Rapidity of its Motion, either when it is studded with Stars by Night, or enlighten'd with the Sun by Day; then shall you see that Almighty Hand which poises them in their Orbs, and balances them in their Movement. Behold how the Sun girds up and regulates the Year by its Annual Circuit, and how the Moon measures round a Month by its Increase, Decay, and total Disappearance. What need I mention the constant Vicissitudes of Light and Darkness, for the alternate Reparation of Rest and Labour; I must leave it to Astrologers to tell you more at large the Uses of the Stars, either how they direct the Pilot in Navigation, or the Husband∣man in his Seasons of Plowing and Reaping; every one of which Celestial Bodies, as they requir'd Almighty Power and Wisdom at first to create and range them in their Stations, so do they require the most consummate Wisdom and Sagacity to comprehend them now they are created. Moreover, does not the standing Va∣riety of Seasons marching in goodly Order te∣stify the Divine Author? The Spring with her Flowers, the Summer with her Harvests, and the Ripening Autumn with grateful Fruits, and the moist and unctuous Winter, are all equally necessary; which Order had certainly been di∣sturbed before now, had it not been fix'd by the

wisest Power. What an Argument of a Provi∣dence is it, thus to interpose and moderate the Extremes of Winter and Summer, with the Allays of Spring and Autumn, that we pass the Year about with Security and Comfort, between the excesses of Parching Heat and Cold? Ob∣serve the Sea, and you'll find it bounded with a Shore, a Law it cannot transgress; look into the vegetable World, and see how all the Trees draw their Life from the Bowels of the Earth; view the Ocean in constant Ebb and Flow, and the Fountains running in full Veins, and the Rivers perpetually gliding in their wonted Channels. What need I spend more Words to shew, how providentially this Spot of Earth is canton'd out into Hills, and Dales, and Plains? What need I speak of the various Artillery for the Defence of every Animal? Some arm'd with Horns, or hedg'd about with Teeth, or fortify'd with Hoofs and Claws, or spear'd with Stings; and others either swift of Foot, or Wing? But above all, the beautiful Structure of Man most plainly speaks a God; Man of Stature straight, and Visage erect, with Eyes at top like Centries, watching over the other Senses within the Tower.</P>

What think you of the manner of our Birth, and the Instinct of Generation? Who but God

Shou'd you chance to go into a House, and see all the Rooms exquisitely furnish'd, and kept in great order, you wou'd make no dispute but such a House was under the Care and Inspection of a Master, and that he himself was preferable to all the Furniture. Thus in this Palace of the World, when you cast your Eyes upon Heaven and Earth, and behold the admirable Order and Oeconomy of Things, you have as little reason to question whether there is a Lord of the Uni∣verse, and that he himself is more glorious than the Stars, and more to be admir'd than the Works of his own Hands. But perhaps you may have no Scruples concerning a Providence, but only whether the Heavenly Government is lodg'd in One, or a Plurality of Deities. And this is easily decided, if you'll give your self but the Trouble to look abroad into the King∣doms of the World, from which you may col∣lect the Regimen or Form above. For when did you ever know any Copartnership in a King∣dom commence with Integrity, or conclude without Blood?

The Wars of <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son-in-Law, Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI>, shook the Earth; and all the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was not big enough to hold Two Men. See Examples of another kind; the Bees have but one King, and the Flocks and Herds but one Leader; and can you imagine Two Su∣premes in Heaven, and that Almighty Power is divisible? Since 'tis manifest, that God, the Universal Parent, has neither Beginning nor End; but gave Beginning to All, and Eternity to himself; who before the World was, was a World to himself; who commands all Things by his <HI>Word</HI>, and dispenses them by his Wis∣dom, and consummates them by his Power. This God is Invisible, because of his Bright∣ness inaccessible; and not tangible, because Incorporeal; and Incomprehensible, because too great for our Capacity; Infinite, Immense, and this Immensity intelligible by himself only. Our Intellect is too narrow to contain him, and therefore we never conceive so worthily of him, as when we conceive him Unconceivable. Shall I speak my Sense of this Matter? Who∣ever imagines that he knows the Divine Majesty, lessens it; and whoever does not lessen it, can never pretend to know it. Enquire not his Name, for God is his Name, and there only we use Names, where many Individuals are to be distinguish'd by their proper Appellations; but to God, who is but One, the Name of God is all in all; for if I call him Father, you forth∣with conceive of him, as an Earthly Parent; if

King or Lord, your Fancy cloaths him with such Ideas as those Words stand for with Men. Take but away this human Covering of Words, and you'll see the Divine Nature the better. More∣over, have I not all the World on my Side in the Acknowledgment of this One God? I hear the People when they lift up their Hands to Heaven, say nothing else, but <HI>The God, The great God, The true God, and if it shall please God</HI>. This Expression in the Vulgar, is the Voice of Nature; and is it not also the Con∣fession of Christians? And they who make <HI>Jove</HI> the Supreme Deity, mistake indeed in the Name, but agree in the Thing, in the Notion of One Almighty.</P>

And what other God do we Christians preach up, than Mind, and Reason, and Spirit? Let us run over the Doctrine of the Philosophers, if you please, and you'll find them, though dif∣ferently expressing themselves in Words, yet as to the Thing, all conspiring in one and the same Opinion. I omit the ancient Wise Men of <HI>Greece</HI>, deservedly so call'd upon the account of their Sayings. Let <HI>Thales</HI> the <HI>Milesian</HI>, the Prin∣cipal of them, serve for the rest, who was the first that discours'd accurately concerning Hea∣venly Matters. This same <HI>Milesian Thales</HI> af∣firm'd Water to be the Principle of Things; but withal, that God was that Mind which form'd every Being out of this Fluid into a World. But let me tell you, this Account of Water and the Spirit was a Notion far above the reach of any Mortal, had not God, who was that Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.2.</NOTE> reveal'd it to <HI>Moses</HI>. Thus you see how the principal Philosopher exactly concurs with us Christians. After him <HI>Anaximenes</HI>, and then <HI>Diogenes</HI> sirnamed <HI>Apolloniates</HI>, make God of a Nature Aerial, Infinite, and Immense. These then agree with us in the Doctrine of One God. The God of <HI>Anaxagoras</HI>, is an Infinite Mind that disposes and puts every Thing in Motion; and the God of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>, is a Mind that permeates and takes care of the Universe, and is the Original of all Life. <HI>Xenophanes</HI> is well known to have defined God to be an Ani∣mated Infinite. <HI>Antisthenes</HI> holds a Plurality of Gods over several Nations, but one only Deity Supreme by Nature. <HI>Speusippus</HI> is for that na∣tural, animal Virtue, by which All things are conducted, to be God. Does not <HI>Democritus</HI>,
<PB N="229" REF="270"/>
although the first Inventor of the Atomick Phi∣losophy, does not he often speak of that Nature, which is the Author of those Images and Inten∣tional Species, by which we understand, and feel, and see, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as God? <HI>Strato</HI> likewise sets up Nature for God. Even your famous <HI>Epicurus</HI>, who makes either Unactive, or No Gods, Dei∣sies Nature. <HI>Aristotle</HI> is at Variance with him∣self: however he assigns one Sovereign Power; for one while he calls Mind God, another while the World he will have God, and then again he makes God above the World. <HI>Hera∣clides</HI> of <HI>Pontus</HI> reels about in the same manner; however, he ascribes a Divine Mind to God, or else to the World, or else makes a pure Divine Mind it self to be God. <HI>Theophrastus</HI>, and <HI>Zeno</HI>, and <HI>Chrysippus</HI>, and <HI>Cleanthes</HI>, though all at Difference, yet at the long run they all meet in the Notion of one Providence that superin∣tends the World. For <HI>Cleanthes</HI> sometimes makes God to be a Mind, sometimes a Soul, sometimes <HI>Aether</HI>, and sometimes Reason. His Master <HI>Zeno</HI> makes the Natural and Divine Law in Things to be God; and sometimes <HI>Aether</HI>, and sometimes Reason, to be the Fountain of all. This same Philosopher, methinks, by calling <HI>Juno</HI>, Air, <HI>Jupiter</HI> Heaven, <HI>Neptune</HI> Sea, <HI>Vul∣can</HI> Fire, and all the rest likewise of the Popular Gods, Elements, by such Names severely con∣futes, and lashes the Publick Vanity of wor∣shipping such Deities. <HI>Chrysippus</HI> says much the same Things; for he believes God sometimes to be a Divine Energy, a Rational Nature; and then again the World, and then fatal Necessity; and copies after <HI>Zeno</HI> by interpreting the Fables
<PB N="230" REF="271"/>
of the Gods in the Verses of <HI>Hesiod, Homer</HI> and <HI>Orpheus</HI>, into Natural Principles. And <HI>Diogenes</HI> the <HI>Babylonian</HI>, expounds the lying-in of <HI>Jove</HI>, and the Birth of <HI>Minerva</HI>, and such like Ficti∣ons, not of the Gods, but of Nature. <HI>Xeno∣phon</HI>, the Disciple of <HI>Socrates</HI>, affirms the Form of the true God to be Invisible, and therefore not to be search'd after. <HI>Aristo</HI> of <HI>Chios</HI> affirms him likewise to be Incomprehensible; and both the one and the other understood the Divine Majesty best, by despairing to understand it. But of all the Philosophers, <HI>Plato</HI> deliver'd himself the plainest and truest of God, of Things, and Names; and his Discourses had been purely Divine, had he not sometimes comply'd too far with the Vanities of the Age, and allay'd them with the Errors in Fashion. This same <HI>Plato</HI> therefore in his <HI>Timaeus</HI> says, That by the Name <HI>God</HI>, we are to understand the Parent of the World, the Architect of the Soul, and the Ma∣ker of Heaven and Earth; whom it is hard to understand, by reason of his incredible Immen∣sity of Power, which is too much for Human Intellect; and when we do come to the Know∣ledge of Him, 'tis impossible to make our No∣tions intelligible to All. And we Christians al∣most say the same Things; for we are come to the Knowledge of this true God, and we also call him the Parent of all Things; nor do we preach these Divine Mysteries in Publick, but when the Publick calls us in Question about our Religion.</P>

That part of the Universe which has been already discovered by Human Eyes, assisted with Dioptrical Glasses, is almost
<PB N="232" REF="273"/>
unconceivably vast, as will be easily granted, if we assent to what the best Astronomers, as well Modern as Ancient, scruple not to deliver. [See Pag. 56, 57. above.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 11.</NOTE>] And it plainly appears by the Parallaxes, and other Proofs, that this Globe of Earth and Water that we Inhabit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 12.</NOTE> and often call the <HI>World</HI>, though it be divided into so many great Empires and Kingdoms, is so far from be∣ing for its Bulk a considerable part of the Uni∣verse; that, without much Hyperbole, we may say, that 'tis in Comparison thereof, but a <HI>Physical Point</HI>. Nay, those far greater Globes of the Sun, and other fixed Stars, and all the solid Masses of the World to boot, if they were reduc'd into One, would perhaps bear a less Pro∣portion to the Fluid [empty] part of the Uni∣verse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 13.</NOTE> than a <HI>Nut</HI> to the <HI>Ocean</HI>. Which brings into my Mind the Sentence of an excellent mo∣dern Astronomer. That the Stars of the Sky, if they were crouded into One Body, and placed where the Earth is, would, if that Globe were placed at a fit Distance, appear no bigger than a Star of the first Magnitude now does. And after all this, I must remind you, that I have been hitherto speaking but of that part of the Corporeal Universe that has been already seen by us.

<P>And from hence may we justly fall into the deepest Admiration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 273, 274.</NOTE> that <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>save Law</HI> of Motion should be observed in Bodies so vastly distant from each other, and which seem to have no Dependance or Correspondence with each other.

And, with Submission to the Reverend and Learned <HI>Divines</HI>, I am apt to think that one Argument drawn from the <HI>Order, Beauty</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of Things, is more forcible against <HI>Atheism</HI>, than Multitudes of Notional Proofs drawn from <HI>Ideas</HI>, Apparitions of <HI>Spectres, Witches</HI>, &amp;c.

That we do not only explain the Mechanism of the World; but that besides this, and as the Fruit of our Enquiries about it, we answer these fol∣lowing <HI>Queries</HI>, with others of a like Nature; What there is in the Celestial Spaces void of Matter? And whence it is that the Sun and Planets gravitate mutually towards one another, while the Spaces between are void of Matter? How it comes to pass that Nature acts nothing in vain? And whence proceeds the admirable Beauty of the Universe? To what End the Co∣mets were made? And whence it is that they move in Orbits so very Eccentrical, from and to all Parts of the Heavens? whereas the Course of the Planets hath the same Direction, towards the same Parts, in Orbits Concentrical. And what hinders the Sun and fixed Stars from rushing mutually upon one another? How it comes about that the Bodies of Animals are fram'd with such exquisite Art and Wisdom? and for what Purposes their different Parts were fitted? Whether it were possible that the Eye could be framed without the Knowledge of Op∣ticks; Or the Ear without the Knowledge of Sounds?

whence is what we call <HI>Instinct</HI> in Animals? Whether the Sensory of Animals be not the Place where the Substance which has Sensation is pre∣sent, and into which the sensible Species of Ob∣jects are carried by the Nerves and the Brain, that they may there be perceived where they are actually present by that Substance there present? And whether from a right Solution of these Queries, it does not appear that there is a Being, Incorporeal, Living, Intelligent, Omnipresent, who in infinite Space, as it were in his Sensory, sees accurately and intimately, and discerns throughly the Things themselves; and by being present to them comprehends them all within himself: Of which Things, that which in us Per∣ceives and Thinks, Perceives and Beholds in its little Sensory, only the Images, brought to it by the Organs of Sense?</P>

<P>This Being governs all Things, not as a Soul of the World, but as Lord of the Uni∣verse; and upon Account of his Dominion, he is stiled Lord God, Supreme over all. For the word <HI>God</HI> is a relative Term, and has refe∣rence to Servants; and <HI>Deity</HI> is the Dominion

The Supreme God is an Eter∣nal, Infinite, Absolutely Perfect Being: But a Being, how perfect soever, without Domi∣nion is not Lord God.

We do not say, <HI>my Perfect, your Perfect</HI>, the <HI>Perfect of Israel</HI>; for these Terms have no Relation to Servants. The Term, <HI>God</HI>, every where signifies Lord; but every <HI>Lord</HI> is not <HI>God</HI>.

As a blind Man has no Idea of Colours, so we have no Notion of the Ways by which the most Wise God perceives and understands all Things. He is entirely without Body, or bodily Figure, and therefore can neither be seen, nor heard, nor touch'd, neither ought he to be worshipp'd under the Representation of any corporeal Thing. We have Ideas of his <HI>Attributes</HI>, but we do not at all know what the <HI>Substance</HI> of any thing is. All that we see of Bodies, is their Figures and Colours; we hear only their Sounds, we touch only their outward Surfaces, we smell their Scents, and taste their Savours.

<P>We know him only by his Properties and Attributes, and by his most wise and exqui∣site Structure of Things, and by final Causes: And we reverence and worship him upon ac∣count of his <HI>Dominion</HI>.

<PB N="242" REF="283"/>
are the Things under Examination. For ac∣cordingly as we shall determine our selves in this grand Enquiry, concerning the Being and Providence of God, the Immortality of our Souls, and the Truth of Divine Revelation, as to the lasting Rewards and Punishments of another World; so shall we be oblig'd to be∣have our selves in our Conduct; upon which our Eternal State is to be awarded us at the great Day. For we cannot but be sensible that no Mistake of our own can alter the Nature of Things; and that they are not the most zealous Wishes, and Inclinations; the most pungent Jests and Banter; the most Prophane and Impious Blasphemy against God, his At∣tributes, or Providence, that can in the least alter the System of the Universe, or banish the Supreme Creator and Governor, with his Pro∣vidence and Laws, out of it. Let us consider, then, that all the other Hypotheses relating to the Constitution of the World, invented by either <HI>Democritus, Epicurus, Aristotle, Pto∣lemy, Tycho, Cartes</HI>, Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI>, or <HI>Spinoza</HI>, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now plainly appear, from certain Evidence, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be not only false, but absurd; contrary bot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to common Sense, and to the known Laws an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Observations of sound Philosophy; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he who will now be an <HI>Atheist</HI>, must be an ab¦solute <HI>Ignoramus</HI> in Natural Knowledge; mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neither understand the Principles either of Phy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sicks or Astronomy.

<PB N="243" REF="284"/>
all Revealed Religion is false; but that it is chiefly fallen into of late by some Irreligious Persons, in the Distress of their Affairs, and upon that surprizing and overbearing Light, which Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s wonderful Discoveries have afforded; whereby they have perceiv'd that Natural Religion, with its Foundations, were now become too certain to bear any far∣ther Opposition. That this is true, I appeal to a certain Club of Persons, not over religi∣ously dispos'd, who being soberly asked, after Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s remarkable Sermons at Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lectures, built upon Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Discoveries, and levell'd against the prevailing Atheism of the Age, <HI>What they had to say in their own Vindication against the Evidence pro∣duc'd by Dr.</HI> Bentley? The Answer was, <HI>That truly they did not well know what to say against it, upon the Head of Atheism: But what</HI>, say they, <HI>is this, to the Fable of Jesus Christ?</HI> And in Confirmation of this Account, it may, I be∣lieve, be justly observ'd, that the present gross <HI>Deism</HI>, or the Opposition that has of late so evidently and barefacedly appear'd against Di∣vine Revelation, and the Holy Scriptures, has taken its Date in some Measure from that Time. And as to the main Observation which I am now upon, I mean that this modern Infidelity is not properly owing to any new Discovery of the want of real Evidence for Reveal'd Religion, or of the Falsity of any of the known Foundations of it; but to the like Necessity of Affairs, and the Impossibility of supporting the former, and worser Notions, I think is plain from these Two farther Considerations: First, That the most truly Learned, the deepest Enquirers, and
<PB N="244" REF="285"/>
most Sagacious Examiners into Reveal'd Reli∣gion, have in this Age, as well as in all the foregoing, declar'd themselves in Favour of it, both by their Conduct, and by their Writings; while the Generality of the <HI>Deists</HI> are known to be so Overly and Superficial in their Learning, about such Matters, as renders them indeed sometimes the Scare-crows of the Ignorant, but gnerally the Contempt of the really Judicious and Learned Christians. Secondly, That they have, for some Time, almost discarded the principal way of Examination into the main Evi∣dence for the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Revelations, I mean Ancient Facts and Testimonies; which they would never have done, had they not been well assur'd that such Sort of Arguments would not be for their Service. However, I shall wave this, as somewhat Foreign to my present Undertaking, and proceed to that <HI>Recapitulation</HI> of what I have alledg'd in this Treatise, on the Behalf of the Being, and the Attributes, and the Providence of God, of the Immortality of Human Souls, and of the several important Points of Natural and Reveal'd Religion already treated of, which I proposed to make in this Place.</P>
<P>We have then here, Good Reader, seen a wonderful, a surprizing, an amazing System. or rather an innumerable Number of such Systems of Worlds; <HI>i. e.</HI> of Suns, of Pla∣nets, Primary and Secondary, and of Comets, with their several Atmospheres, all placed at immense Distances from one another; in vari∣ous Positions, Velocities, and Periods; in divers Circumstances and Magnitudes, ordain'd for se∣veral great Uses, and admitting dfferent particu∣lar Laws; but so as every where to be subject to
<PB N="245" REF="286"/>
one Universal <HI>Power of Gravity</HI>, or mutual Tendency of all the Parts to one another, and that of a certain Quantity, and in certain Proportions. A Power this, amazing to think of! yet Undeniable, Regular, Universal as to Time, Place, and Bodies; and still Exact and Geometrical; yet at the same Time entirely and absolutely Immechanical, or beyond all Material Solutions, and Pretence of Material Solutions whatsoever; and indeed the proper Effect of the Supreme Being. We have seen, that accordingly this Immense World, or Innu∣merable Number of Immense Worlds, are for certain all <HI>God's Worlds</HI>; or Created, Governed, and Provided for by One God, by One Supreme, Omnipotent and Omniscient Being; ever Pre∣sent to all its Parts; and ever exerting his In∣finite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness every where therein. We have seen that the noblest Principles of Natural Religion are Fully and Demonstratively deriv'd from the Phaenomena of these Systems; and that not a few of the most Concerning, and otherwise most Excep∣tionable Parts of Divine Revelation, are also strongly confirm'd thereby. Nor is there now the least room for either of those Ancient Refuges of Atheism and Irreligion; I mean the wild Hypotheses of the <HI>Eternity of the World</HI>; and of its Temporary Derivation from the <HI>Ac∣cidental Concourse of Atoms</HI>. All this we have now <HI>seen</HI> with our Eyes, and as it were, <HI>felt</HI> with our Hands, in the foregoing Treatise. We have also there observ'd and prov'd, that this wonderful System of Things is not any bare Hypothesis, or meerly <HI>probable Account</HI> of the Heavenly Bodies, and their Motions,
<PB N="246" REF="287"/>
but the <HI>certain Theory</HI> of them, attested to be such by unquestionable Evidence, from As<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nomical Observations, and from sure Geome∣trical Reasonings thereupon. So that the Con∣clusions regularly drawn from such Premises, ought themselves to be look'd on as <HI>Certain</HI>. We have there also distinctly followed the Steps of Nature, and drawn out her grand Secrets into plain Tables, for the Use of every body; even of those who are not Mathematicians good enough to Calculate themselves. And have farther given the Manner and Reason of each Operation, for every ones entire Satis∣faction. Nor need my Readers take even the <HI>Lemmata</HI> themselves for granted, if they un∣derstand but some Elements of Geometry. For they are demonstrated every one in my <HI>Ma∣thematical Philosophy</HI>, and that generally after so plain a Manner, that I dare say very or∣dinary Mathematicians will be able to under∣stand those Demonstrations. By these Calcu∣lations it is that we arrive at the compleatest and most exact Knowledge of this <HI>Noble</HI>, this <HI>Amazing</HI>, this <HI>Divine System</HI>. Nor can I ima∣gine that the Inquisitive Reader, when he has well consider'd the Particulars, will think that any of those Epithets, <HI>Noble, Amazing</HI>, and <HI>Divine</HI>, are by me wrong apply'd in this Mat∣ter. For here we discover that all the Hea∣venly Bodies <HI>Revolve</HI> in those most agreeable Geometrical Curves, the <HI>Ellipses</HI>; the Planets in those that are very little Eccentrical; and the Comets in those that are prodigiously so; even in such as are almost Parabolical. By which known and Regular Orbits, we readily reduce their Motions to Calculation, and easily
<PB N="247" REF="288" MS="y"/>
discover the Law of Gravity belonging to them. Here we contemplate the <HI>Periods</HI> of all the Pla∣nets Primary and Secondary, and of the Comets, about their Central Bodies, from the smallest Pe∣riod of the Innermost Circumjovial of 42 Hours and a half; to the largest of the outmost Comet of 575 Years. Here we take a View of the vast middle <HI>Distances</HI> of all the Planets, Primary, and Secondary, and of the Comets, from their Cen∣tral Bodies, deriv'd from the best Observations, from the least of the innermost Circumjovials of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.000, to the greatest of the utmost Comet of 5.600,000,000 Miles; the least of which distances does prodigiously surpass the Power of Human Imagination, which can no way enlarge it self to any such measures. Here also we may discover the surprizing <HI>Magnitudes</HI> of the several Bodies belonging to our System, both in Diameter, Superficies, and Solidity, from the smaller Quantities in our Moon, of 2170 Miles Diameter; 14,000.000 square Miles of Surface; and 5.000,000.000 cubical Miles, of Solidity; to the vastly greater Quantities in the Sun of 763.000 Miles Diameter; 1,813.200,000.000, square Miles of Surface; and 230.000,000.000,000.000 cubical Miles of Solidity. Numbers that are still more immensely beyond all Human Imagination; and such as, if <HI>Epicurus</HI> or <HI>Lucretius</HI> were alive, who could raise their stupid Conceptions no farther than the large∣ness of a Cart-wheel for the Sun it self, would have quite affrighted them out of their foolish Philosophy. We here learn the <HI>Annual Velo∣cities</HI> of the several Planets, Primary and Se∣condary; and of the Comets, from the slowest Motion in the Moon, of 2200 Miles, to the
<PB N="248" REF="289"/>
swiftest in <HI>Mercury</HI>, of 100.000 Miles, in the space of one Hour. As also we here learn the <HI>Diurnal Velocities</HI> at the Equator, the slowest of the Moon of 10 Miles, the swiftest of <HI>Jupiter</HI> of 25.000 Miles in the same space of one hour: And that even we upon the Surface of this Earth, when we cross the Line, with all our Buildings, move along 1030 Miles in an Hour; and that by Consequence, in this Latitude, I my self, while I seem to be at rest, writing this Treatise in my Study, do yet, together with my Study, and my Books, revolve at the rate of above 600 Miles in the same time. Nay, we here get a step farther, and, without going down into the Central Regions of any one of the Celestial Bodies, do certainly pronounce, not only concerning the Mathematical <HI>Quantity</HI> of Bulk or <HI>Magnitude</HI>, but in many Cases con∣cerning the real Physical <HI>Quantity of Matter</HI> con∣tain'd in those Bodies, as compar'd, I mean, with one another; which is as far as Philoso∣phy can possibly carry us. Whereby we find that the Moon, which is the least of all those Bodies whose Quantities of Matter we know, is not quite the 9,000.000th part so great in this respect as the Sun; and that the Quantity of Matter of all the Planets and Comets taken to∣gether, does not in probability amount to the 500th part of that in the Sun alone; the <HI>Sun</HI>, I say, that most amazing and most prodigious Creature of God that is in this System, and perhaps in all the visible Systems about us! of which Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> bravely sings;
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paradise Lost.</HI> Lib. v.</NOTE>Thou Sun, of this great World, both Eye and Soul,</L>
<L>Acknowledge God thy Greater: Sound his Praise</L>
<L>In thy Eternal Course!</L></Q>
<PB N="249" REF="290"/>
Moreover, we here certainly discover by Conse∣quence, the very inward Texture of the same Celestial Bodies, whose Quantities of Matter were above determin'd; and, without digging into the Bowels of any of the Planets, do, with equal Certainty, pronounce what comparative degree of <HI>Density</HI> they have: Whereby we learn that the Sun is vastly too dense for a Flame, as <HI>Cartes</HI> determined; and that the Moon is the Densest, and <HI>Saturn</HI> the Rarest of all these Bo∣dies; and that the former is above eight times as dense as the latter. Which Conclusions shew the admirable Nature, and profound Reach of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Philosophy, which, with equal ease and certainty, penetrates to such deep Truths, as no other Hypotheses do so much as in the least hope or pretend to attain to, even by Conjecture. Nor do we stop here; but placing our selves on the several <HI>Surfaces</HI> of the fore-mentioned Planets, we by certain Rea∣soning determine the comparative <HI>Weight</HI> of any given Body on those several Surfaces; and ob∣serve, with great Satisfaction, that the same Strength that can here lift One Hundred Pound would not be able on the Sun's Surface to lift Four Pounds; and that what on the Moon's Surface, where this Weight is the least, would weigh one pound; would, if transferr'd to the Sun's Surface, where it is the greatest, weigh above 71 of the same Pounds. We do also here Contemplate those <HI>Diurnal Motions</HI> with respect to the other Heavenly Bodies, which we are forced to gather by Geometrical Reasoning, with respect to our own Earth; and which the several Inhabitants of those Bodies, (if such there are, and if they be provided with
<PB N="250" REF="291"/>
such Means of seeing our Earth, as our Te∣lescopes have of late afforded us for seeing them) may also Contemplate with their Eyes. Whereby we find that they do revolve in Peri∣ods sufficiently unequal; from the slowest, that of the Moon, in 27 Days, to the swiftest, that of <HI>Jupiter</HI>, in a little less than 10 Hours: which Sight seems to me to be a kind of sensible Confirmation of the like Diurnal Motion of our Earth.</P>
<P>We are here also taught to estimate the dif∣ferent <HI>Degrees of Heat and Light</HI>, which our Fellow Creatures derive from the great Foun∣tain of both, the Sun, when nearer, and when farther off than we are: Which difference is so vastly great, even at the mean Distances of the several Bodies from the Sun, that <HI>Mercury</HI>, the nearest, has in a Mean no less than 120000 times the Quantity of Light and Heat which the utmost Comet has; and that the Heat at the Sun's Surface is no less than 45000 times as great as any part of this Earth receives from it, at any time; and that withal the outmost of our known Comets abides at one time an Heat more than 400,000.000 of times, as great as it does another. An <HI>amazing difference</HI> this! and such as is no where else to be parallel'd, that we know of, in the whole System of Na∣ture. We here also see, how soon our Earth, and any of the Planets would <HI>fall to the Sun</HI>, or to their central Bodies, if their Projectile Velocities should cease; from the innermost of the Circumjovials, which would fall to <HI>Jupiter</HI> in 7 Hours; to the outmost Comet which would not fall from its middle distance to the Sun under 66 Years. We have also taken a
<PB N="251" REF="292"/>
view of our neighbouring Body the Moon, and found it in almost all respects such a Planet, or Place of Habitation, as our own Planet the Earth is. And we should be greatly wanting to our Selves, and to the <HI>Decorum</HI> of Things, as well as highly injurious to our great Creator, if we should so much as scruple the Supposition of so noble an Habitation's being Inhabited; of so noble a Colony's being Peopled. Those who can attentively view the Wonderful, and Beautiful, and Admirably contriv'd Structure of this our adjoining Planet with its Sea and Land, Moun∣tains and Valleys, Day and Night, Summer and Winter; together with its Clouds and Atmo∣sphere, and Moon; all in correspondence to our Earth, which is every where full of intelli∣gent Beings its Inhabitants; and yet shall pee∣vishly deny that it either now is, or ever was, or is to be in like manner inhabited by such In∣telligent Beings; and are resolv'd it shall have no other Use than to enlighten our Earth, and be peep'd at through our Telescopes; seem to me too Unphilosophical to be argued with; and only worthy to be left to their own narrow Genius, which can neither think a brave uncommon Thought, nor admit any thing but what their Education or System have already forc'd upon them. Nor indeed, do we need to debate here with such Men; because it can hardly be imagined they will ever have Skill or Curiosity enough to peruse, what either has al∣ready been written, or may hereafter be written upon such great and noble Subjects. Besides this single Attendant of ours, we have taken a Prospect of Four such Attendants on <HI>Jupiter</HI>, and Five on <HI>Saturn</HI>, with the remarkable <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lts</HI>,
<PB N="252" REF="293"/>
and Diurnal Revolution of the former; and the much more astonishing <HI>Ring</HI> of the latter: The One bearing a near resemblance to our Clouds under the Torrid Zone, upon our Earth's daily Motion, and so hinting to us the Likeness there is between that and our Planet: And the Other affording an Instance of a more surprizing Variety in the Works of God and Nature than is any where else to be so evidently discover'd in the World. Nor must I here pass over in Silence that wonderful, that prodigious, that amazing Instance of <HI>Swiftness of Motion</HI>, which the Rays of Light afford us, and which is ga∣thered from the Eclipses of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Planets; no less I mean than that of 180.000. Miles in one Second of Time; whence it appears, that a Being, might visit all the Men in the World, if he proceeded with the Swiftness of these Rays, and those Men were placed in any tolerable Order along or near a great Cir∣cle of the Earth, in a very few Seconds of time. Nor do any of the other swiftest Motions that we know of in the Universe deserve to be called <HI>swift</HI> in comparison of this before us; which is no other than a constant Instance of the Power of God in moving the Bodies which he has made, with what Velocity he pleases; and thereby of communicating his Influences, even in a Mechanical Way, to immense Distances, almost in a Moment. But then, besides this Planetary World, which was in some measure known to the Ancient Astronomers, we have also taken a View of another World, or Species of Bodies, known indeed by Name, but hardly at all by Nature to the Ancients; I mean the Sy∣stem of Comets, which till lately were gene∣rally
<PB N="253" REF="294" MS="y"/>
look'd on as inconsiderable and fortuitous Meteors of our Air only; but do now appear to be more numerous, and not less considerable than the Planets themselves. These Comets pass so entirely through the Planetary Regions, and may so certainly approach to the Planets them∣selves both in their Descent and Ascent; that they may serve hitherto unknown Ends of Pro∣vidence, both in their own Constitution, and by the Changes they may occasion in the Planets; and do therefore well deserve our most attentive Consideration. Nor certainly were the Planets, their Number, Magnitude, Motions, and Uses so well known in some Thousands of Years after their first Observation, as the Comets now are in a few Hundreds, or rather Decads of Years since they were to any good Purpose observed by Astronomers. And then, lastly, after all, we have taken a short imperfect View of the vastly nu∣merous, the vastly great, and vastly distant Sy∣stems of the Fixed Stars, or to us new Systems of Worlds quite remote from this our Planetary and Cometary World: In Comparison of all which Systems of Worlds, our own entire System, with its Sun, and all its Planets and Comets, must be but inconsiderable; probably not the 10.000<SUP>th</SUP>, perhaps not the 100.000<SUP>th</SUP>, or 1,000.000<SUP>th</SUP> Part of the Whole: And whose Distance appears to be so great from us, that a Musket Bullet that should go 240 Feet in one Second of Time, if it had been shot up at the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Creation to the nearest fixed Star, and continued its Course even∣ly all the Way, would hardly have arrived there by this time, after the long Interval of 6200 Years. So immensly numerous, and immensly great and glorious is the entire System; and so inconside∣rable
<PB N="254" REF="295"/>
are we poor Worms, creeping upon this little little Earth, if compared thereto; even <HI>as Nothing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. xl.17.</NOTE> <HI>yea less than Nothing, and Vanity!</HI> And here we have plainly lost our selves in the amazing <HI>Length</HI> and <HI>Breadth</HI>, and <HI>Height</HI> of the Grand System, and of that Power, Wisdom and Goodness, which shines forth in every Branch thereof; those chiefly excepted which depend on the Actions of Free-Creatures, and the man∣ner of their Treatment by that Providence which discovers it self in the whole Universe; the Rules of whose Conduct are not yet laid fully open to our present Curiosity, but are ra∣ther reserved for the last and noblest Scene of our Duration hereafter. Nor is this to be so much wondred at, if we consider that the most beautiful, and orderly, and wisely contrived Sy∣stem of this visible World it self, which we have been just reviewing, tho' it has all along, since the beginning of the World, afforded ma∣ny and noble Indications of that Divine Power Wisdom, and Goodness to all Mankind, yet have the entire Secrets of that Contrivance, with that universal Power of Gravitation, by which the whole Machine has all along been upheld, lain in a manner hid through all past Ages, and is but just now discovered to us. Nay, the very best System of the Heavens, which the Astrono∣mers long had, is reported to have appeared to One of them so aukward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alphonsus.</NOTE> absurd and disagree∣able, that he was not able to restrain his Tongue from a kind of Blasphemy against its Author; meerly because the Grand Mysteries of the whole Machine, by the Knowledge of which all those seeming Disorders are now entirely va∣nished,
<PB N="255" REF="296"/>
was not at that time discovered to Man∣kind, but was reserved for these later, and on that Account happier Ages of the World.</P>
<P>And now, Good Readers, having made this Review of the entire Universe, let us, in Agree∣ment with the rest of my Design, turn our Eyes from the Works to the Workman; from the Effects to the Cause; from the Creatures to the Creator; from these Glorious, these Divine Works of Nature, to the more Glorious and more Divine Author of Nature, the great <HI>God, lessed for ever</HI>. For as it is excellently ob∣serv'd in the Book of Wisdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">xiii.1.</NOTE> <HI>Surely vain are all Men by Nature who are ignorant of God; and could not, out of the good Things that are seen, know him that is; neither by considering the Works did they arknowledge the Workmaster. — For by the Greatness and Beauty of the Crea∣tures proportionably the Maker of them is seen.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v.5.</NOTE> And if there be any Deductions of Human Reason which are easier and more obvious than the rest, it is this Way of Arguing, which we have already used, from the <HI>House</HI> to the <HI>Architect</HI>; from the <HI>Clock</HI> to the <HI>Clock-maker</HI>; from the <HI>Ship</HI> to the <HI>Shipbuilder</HI>; and from a <HI>noble, large well-contriv'd</HI>, and <HI>well-proportion'd</HI>, and <HI>most beautiful</HI> House, or Clock, or Ship, to the <HI>ex∣cellent</HI> Architect, the <HI>skilful</HI> Clockmaker, the <HI>sagacious</HI> Shipbuilder; this is such clear, na∣tural, obvious, sure Reasoning, that we even at first make use of it in Childhood, and find it as clear, natural, obvious, and sure in our elder Age; without occasion for a Tutor to instruct us in it at first, or for a Logician to im∣prove us in it afterward. And shall we reject
<PB N="256" REF="297"/>
that way of Reasoning, in the most eminent of all Instances, which we are not able to avoid making in the smallest? Shall the comparative∣ly few, trifling, imperfect Contrivances of every small Machine here (which yet only applies the Powers of Nature to particular Purposes,) be universally, without Hesitation, allowed to prove a subtile, a shrewd, and a wise Contriver there∣of? And yet, shall the numberless, the impor∣tant, and the most compleat Contrivances which surround us every where in this Universe, from the immensly great Body of a Sun, to the as prodigiously small Bodies of some <HI>Animalcula</HI>, be ascrib'd to <HI>Fate</HI>, to <HI>Chance</HI>, to any Thing imaginable, besides the great <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Contri∣ver</HI> of all Things himself; to whom yet from the earliest to the latest Records of Mankind, as we have seen, the Wisest and Best have ever freely and unanimously ascribed them? But why do I speak of the <HI>Wisest</HI> and <HI>Best</HI> only in this Case? As if the rest of Mankind have generally had other Notions. No, the whole Race of Man∣kind, abating a very few, little better either for Ignorance, or Vice, or both, than Monsters, have still from one Generation to another drawn the very same Conclusions and Truths in their Minds; tho they have not all made equal Ap∣plication of those Conclusions and Truths to their Practice. In witness whereof, I might alledge the Concessions of not a few such bad Men; but shall chuse only to instance in the late famous Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI>, who long wanted, not so much Abili∣ties to discover, as Goodness to make use of such Arguments. This Person therefore, as I have been informed, having been one Night deeply en∣gag'd in Atheistical and Blasphemous Discourse
<PB N="257" REF="298" MS="y"/>
among his Companions, as he too frequently was, after a while happen'd to have occasion to step abroad: where the Sky, being very clear, presented him with a glorious Prospect of no small Part of that beautiful World which we have been more distinctly describing. Upon the View of which he was overheard to say, <HI>What a Dog am I, thus to blaspheme Him that made me and all this beautiful World</HI>! I do not at present recollect from whom I had this Account; tho' the Thing it self was too remarkable to be for∣gotten. But whether any Mistake might be made in the Circumstances of this Story or not, 'tis unquestionable that such must frequently be the natural Reflections of a considering Mind, in these Circumstances; whose Impressions no∣thing can entirely supersede. As for my self, I must freely own, that as I had from my Child∣hood ever learned from the Works of God to acknowledge and worship Him that made them; and as I improv'd in Anatomy, in Astronomy, in Natural Philosophy, I saw that this first Im∣pression or Voice of Nature was still more and more confirm'd and established by farther En∣quiries; so that when, in my younger Days, I had with great Difficulty and Pains, attained to the Knowledge of the true System of the World, and of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s wonderful Discoveries thereto relating, I was not only fully <HI>convinc'd</HI>, but <HI>deeply and surprizingly affected</HI> with the Consequences of this Nature; I was satisfy'd that they were evident <HI>Demonstrations of Natu∣ral</HI>, and noble <HI>Attestations to Revealed Religion</HI>. In which Principles the farther Improvements I have still made, or succeeding Discoveries of others have still presented to me, the more sure
<PB N="258" REF="299"/>
and certain have those Principles appeared; and the more sure and certain have those Consequen∣ces seem'd; tho' it must be confess'd that the Deepness of the Surprize and Impression, as in all the like Cases, can never be so sensible and affecting, as it was upon the first Knowledge of such amazing Truths, and momentous Corolla∣ries from them. And I cannot but heartily wish, for the common Good of all the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and Unbelievers of this Age, that I could imprint in their Minds all that real Evidence for Natu∣ral and for Reveal'd Religion that now is, or during my past Enquiries has been upon my own Mind thereto relating: And that their Temper of Mind were such as that this Evi∣dence might afford them as great Satisfaction as it has my self. For then I am sure they would not wonder at my warm and zealous Endea∣vours, even at the Hazard of all I have in this World, for the Restoration of true Religion, for the rescuing the Wicked out of their dangerous State, and for the bringing as many as possible to that future Happiness; which is the grand Design of Religion, and the ultimate Felicity of Mankind. But tho' this entire Communication of the Evidence that is, or has been in my own Mind, for the Certainty of Natural Religion, and of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Institutions, be in its own Nature impossible; yet I hope I may have leave here to address my self to all, especially to the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and Unbelievers of our Age; to do what I am able for them in this momentous Concern; and to lay before them, as briefly and seriously as I can, a considerable Number of those Arguments which have the greatest Weight with me, as to the hardest Part
<PB N="259" REF="300"/>
of what is here desired and expected from them; I mean the Belief of Reveal'd Religion, or of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Institutions, as con∣tain'd in the Books of the Old and New Testa∣ment; or in all the Genuine Records now ex∣tant of both Religions. I have already observ'd that the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and Unbelievers of the best Sense do now confess, that the Arguments for a God, his Attributes, and Providence, are very strong; but they will by no Means allow, that those for Divine Revelation, and for the Bible are so: Tho' indeed very few of them, I speak it upon certain Experience, have studyed those Sacred Books with any Degree of that Imparti∣ality, Seriousness, Application, Sagacity or Piety, which is but requisite for forming any tolerable Judgment about them. But to wave farther Preliminaries, some of the principal Reasons which make me believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations to be true, are these following.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Reveal'd Religion of the <HI>Jews</HI> and Christians lays the Law of Nature for its Foun∣dation; and all along supports and assists Natu∣ral Religion; as every true Revelation ought to do.</P>
<P N="2">II. Astronomy, and the rest of our certain Mathematick Sciences, do confirm the Accounts of Scripture; so far as they are concern'd.</P>
<P N="3">III. The ancientest and best Historical Ac∣counts now known, do, generally speaking, con∣firm the Accounts of Scripture; so far as they are concern'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The more Learning has increas'd, the more certain in general do the Scripture Ac∣counts appear, and its difficult Places are more clear'd thereby.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="260" REF="301"/>V. There are, or have been generally stand∣ing Memorials preserv'd of the certain Truths of the principal Historical Facts, which were constant Evidences for the Certainty of them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Neither the Mosaical Law, nor the Christian Religion, could possibly have been receiv'd and established without such Miracles as the Sacred History contains.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Altho' the <HI>Jews</HI> all along Hated and Persecuted the Prophets of God; yet were they forced to believe they were true Prophets, and their Writings of Divine Inspiration.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Ancient and Present State of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation are strong Arguments for the Truth of their Law, and of the Scripture Pro∣phecies relating to them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The Ancient and Present State of the Christian Church are also strong Arguments for the Truth of the Gospel, and of the Scripture Prophecies relating thereto.</P>
<P N="10">X. The Miracles whereon the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religion are founded, were of old owned to be true by their very Enemies.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Sacred Writers, who liv'd in Times and Places so remote from one another, do yet all carry on One and the same grand Design, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Salvation of Mankind, by the Worship of, and Obedience to the One true God, in and through the King <HI>Messiah</HI>: which without a Divine Conduct could never have been done.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The principal Doctrines of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religion are agreeable to the an∣cientest Traditions of all other Nations.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Difficulties relating to this Reli∣gion are not such as affect the Truth of the Facts,
<PB N="261" REF="302"/>
but the Conduct of Providence; the Reasons of which the Sacred Writers never pretended fully to know, or to reveal to Mankind.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Natural Religion, which is yet so cer∣tain in it self, is not without such Difficulties as to the Conduct of Providence, as are obje∣cted to Revelation.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The Sacred History has the greatest Marks of Truth, Honesty, and Impartiality of all other Histories whatsoever; and withal has none of the known Marks of Knavery and Im∣posture.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The Predictions of Scripture have been still fulfilled in the several Ages of the World whereto they belong.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. No opposite Systems of the Universe, or Schemes of Divine Revelation, have any tolerable Pretences to be true, but those of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI>.</P>
<P>These are the plain and obvious Arguments which persuade me of the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations: which I shall briefly insist on here, and earnestly recommend them to the farther Consideration of the inquisitive Reader: Hoping that He will first endeavour to attain that Serious, Upright, Impartial, Ho∣nest, and Obedient Temper of Mind, that a Creature ought to have when he is enquiring into the Laws and Will of his Creator; and will join with me in putting up to that great Creator, some such humble Address as this fol∣lowing, for the good Success of his Enquiries.</P>
<P><Q>“O God of my Fathers, and Lord of Mercy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. ix.1.4.5.10.</NOTE> who hast made all things with thy Word: Give me Wisdom that sitteth by thy Throne; and reject me not from among thy Children. For
<PB N="262" REF="303"/>
I thy Servant, and Son of thine Handmaid, am a feeble Person, and of a short time: O send her out of thy Holy Heavens, and from the Throne of thy Glory! That being present she may labour with me; that I may ”know what is pleasing unto thee: <HI>Amen!</HI></Q></P>
<P N="1">(I.) The first Reason, why I believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations to be true, is this; That they lay the Law of Nature for their Foundati∣on; and all along support and assist Natural Re∣ligion, as every true Revelation ought to do.</P>
<P>That all Divine Revelation supposes the Be∣ing and Attributes of God, which are discove∣rable by the Light of Nature; and particularly the Perfections of Unity, Justice, Veracity, Ho∣liness, and Goodness, all considering Men will readily grant: And that no pretended Revela∣tion, which clearly and evidently contradicts the Laws of Nature, founded on those Divine Perfections, can be more than pretended, they will as readily grant also. So that I shall not need to prove that Part of my Proposition. But then, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations do, for the main at least, most plainly and clearly agree with, and support those Natural Notions we have of God and of Religion, and is founded upon them, is every where supposed and affirm'd in all the Original Records of those Religions. And if the Ceremonial Burdensome Laws once given the <HI>Jews</HI>, be objected against, as unworthy of God, and opposite to his Wis∣dom and Goodness, I shall take leave to say, that this is objected without any just Foundation, and contrary to the best and most authentick Accounts we have of the Reason of those Laws;
<PB N="263" REF="304"/>
I mean, that they were given on purpose for the Support of Natural Religion; and that this ap∣pears not only by occasional Passages in the Sa∣cred and Acknowledged Books of the Old and New Testament, but by an entire particular and noble Discourse, which we have upon this whole Subject in the <HI>Apostolical Constitutions</HI>, and which without all dispute is of much greater Authority than the uncertain Guesses of the Moderns.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> and <HI>Iren.</HI> Vind. of the Con∣stitut. P. <HI>8 — 11.</HI></NOTE> I have set down no small Parts of this Passage else∣where, in Vindication of those Constitutions: yet are they of such Importance, that I shall take leave to repeat them in this Place.</P>
<P><Q>“We recommend to you, say the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Constitut.</HI> l.vi.c.18.</NOTE> <HI>Ti∣tus</HI>, and <HI>Luke</HI>, and <HI>Jason</HI>, and <HI>Lucius</HI>, and <HI>Sosi∣pater</HI>. By whom also we exhort you in the Lord, to abstain from your old Conversation, vain Bonds, Separations, Observances, Distinction of Meats, and daily Washings:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. v.17.</NOTE> for <HI>Old things are ”passed away, behold all things are become New</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“For since we have known God through Jesus Christ, and all his Dispensation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">c.19.</NOTE> as it has been from the Beginning, that he gave a plain Law to assist the Law of Nature; such an one as is pure, saving, and holy; in which his own Name was inscrib'd; perfect, which is never to fail; being compleat in Ten Commands, unspot∣ted, converting Souls; which when the <HI>Hebrews</HI> forgot, he put them in mind of it by the Pro∣phet <HI>Malachi</HI>, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">iv.4.</NOTE> <HI>Remember ye the Law of</HI> Moses, <HI>the Man of God, who gave you in charge ”Commandments and Ordinances;</HI> —</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Now the Law is the Decalogue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">c.20.</NOTE> which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible Voice, before the People made that Calf which represented the <HI>Egyptian Apis</HI>. And the Law is
<PB N="264" REF="305"/>
righteous; and therefore it is called the Law, because Judgments are thence made according to the Law of Nature. —This Law is Good, Holy, and such as lays no Compulsion in things Positive; for He says, <HI>If thou wilt make me an Altar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xx.24.</NOTE> <HI>thou shalt make it of Earth</HI>. It does not say, <HI>Make one</HI>, but <HI>If thou wilt make</HI>: It does not impose a <HI>Necessity</HI>, but gives leave for their own free Liberty; For God does not stand in need of Sacrifices, being by Nature above all Want. But knowing that as of old, <HI>Abel</HI>, beloved of God, and <HI>Noah</HI>, and <HI>Abraham</HI>, and those that succeeded, without being requir'd, but only mov'd of themselves, by the Law of Nature, did offer Sacrifices to God, out of a grateful Mind, so he did now permit the <HI>Hebrews</HI>; not commanding, but if they had a mind, permit∣ting them; and, if they offer'd from a right Intention, shewing himself pleas'd with their Sacrifices.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. l.</NOTE> Therefore he says, <HI>If thou desirest to offer, do not offer to me as one that stands in need of it; for I stand in need of nothing: for the World is mine and the Fulness thereof</HI>. But, after the Sin of the Golden Calf, then was God angry, as being ungratefully treated by them; and bound them with Bonds which could not be loosed; with a mortifying Burden, and a hard Collar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — that being press'd and gall'd by thy Collar, thou may'st depart from the Error of Polytheism;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. xxxii.4.</NOTE> and laying aside that, <HI>These are thy Gods, O</HI> Israel; may'st be mindful of that <HI>Hear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. vi.4.</NOTE> <HI>O</HI> Israel, <HI>the Lord our God is one Lord</HI>: and may'st run back again to that Law which is inserted by me in the Nature of all Men; That there is only One God, in Heaven, and on Earth;
<PB N="265" REF="306"/>
and to love him with all thy Heart, and all thy Might, and all thy Mind, and to fear none but ”him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<P N="2">(II.) The next Reason why I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and Christian Revelations, is this; That Astronomy, and the rest of our certain Mathematick Sciences, do confirm the Accounts of Scripture; so far as they are con∣cern'd.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that in many Points we can examine the Assertions of Ancient Authors, whether they say true or not, by some Parts of the Mathematicks; and particularly in such Cases as the Enquiries of our Age enable us to examine Things more nicely than the Authors of Old Accounts could imagine: And against which Methods of Examination they could therefore by no means provide; any other ways, I mean, than by giving us the Ancient Facts as they really happen'd. In which Cases the Discovery of the Justness of the Proportions of Things, and the Agreement of the Old Narrations with Mathematical Computations, will be a very great Argument for the Vera∣city of the Writers; as will the Absurdity of such Proportions, and the Disagreement of Things, be a like great Argument for their Carelesness or Falsity. Now this Reasoning being obvions; let us try some of the Sacred Narrations by it; and see on which Side this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will incline us, and that in some of its most remarkable Instances. Thus we have al∣ready seen that the Age of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part vii. §. 3. prius.</NOTE> as taken from the Sacred Records, perfectly agrees with the best Methods which Chronology and
<PB N="268" REF="309" MS="y"/>
Natural History can afford us for its Deterrni∣nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Theo∣ry, <HI>p. 144,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>Thus it hes been elsewhere demonstrated, that the most Ancient Year of the World, even before, as well as after the Deluge, had just Twelve Months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.11. <HI>with v.</HI>24. <HI>and</HI> viii.4.</NOTE> of Thirty Days apiece, or Three Hundred and Sixty Days in the whole; as <HI>Moses</HI>'s Account of the Deluge does most na∣turally imply.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Theo∣ry, <HI>passim</HI>.</NOTE>Thus I have elsewhere largely shewn, That that Deluge must by all Astronomical Compu∣tations, have begun that very Month; nay, that very Week, and that very Day, which <HI>Moses</HI> assures us it really did begin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chronol. Old Test.</HI> p. 12, 13, 14. <HI>and</HI> p. 55: — 60.</NOTE>Thus also I have elsewhere shew'd how ex∣actly the Canon of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>, the surest Monu∣ment of Ancient Prophane Chronology now in the World, does agree to, and support the Sa∣cred Chronology; and indeed illustrate the Sacred Prophecies of <HI>Daniel</HI> thereon depend∣ing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 198, 199, 200.</NOTE> and that in such difficult Branches of it, as had been otherwise too hard for all our <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Commentators. Many other Instances of this Nature may be also collected by the Inquisitive from my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>; from my <HI>Chronology of the Old Testament, and Harmony of the Four Evangelists</HI>; and from my <HI>Essay on the Re∣velation of St.</HI> John; to say nothing of my other Writings. But because those Examples have been there already produc'd by me, I shall say no more of them here; and rather alledge a remarkable one, which has not been there mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="310" MS="y"/>It is well known, that <HI>Moses</HI> assures us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vi.vii.viii.</NOTE> how at the general Deluge, all Land Animals that escap'd the same, were saved by an Ark; that this Ark held Sevens of Clean, and Pairs of Unclean Beasts; with their Food for the full Space of a Year; and that from thence therefore all such Creatures are now derived throughout the Earth. He also gives us the Dimensions of this Ark, 300 Cubits long; 50 Cubits broad; and 30 Cubits high. Yet does it no way appear that <HI>Moses</HI>, or any of his Contemporaries, could then examine the Num∣ber of all such Animals, or the quantity of Food necessary for them, during so long an Inter∣val, as the Modern Mathematicians and Natu∣ralists have done. Here therefore we have one of the fairest and most exact Methods of trying the Verity of this Part of the Sacred History that could well be desired: And this Method has accordingly been put in Practice in this very Case, by Two Eminent Mathema∣ticians and Naturalists, <HI>Buteo</HI>, and Bishop <HI>Wilkins</HI>; and it has thence appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Pool</HI>'s Synopsis, and Bishop <HI>Wilkins</HI>.</NOTE> that if we Measure all by a common Cubit of 18 Inches, the Ark will fully contain all those Creatures, with their Food for a Year; and that in separate and convenient Cells and Apartments; though in a somewhat strait and difficult Manner. It has also since appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scripture Weights and Mea∣sures.</NOTE> by Bishop <HI>Cumberland</HI>'s more exact stating of the Old Cubit, that it was not so short as 18, but in Reality near 22 Inches long; and by Consequence, as that Learned Prelate judi∣ciously observes, that an Ark built by that Cubit, being almost double to one built by this other, will not only in a strait Manner,
<PB N="270" REF="311"/>
but with great Ease and Freedom, contain all that we have above-mentioned; though this it will do still, without abundance of waste Room, which would have served to no use∣ful Purposes. So that the Result of this Com∣putation is plainly this; That the Dimensions of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark, as set down in the Sacred History, are fully attested to by Geometry and Natural History; and that those Dimen∣siods are as well proportion'd to the End for which they were design'd, as any Mathema∣tician or Architect could now chuse for the like Purposes: Which Exactness, since none in the Days of <HI>Moses</HI> could naturally attain to, 'tis most reasonabse to suppose it true Fact, and to ascribe the Direction of the whole, as <HI>Moses</HI> does, to the most perfect <HI>Geometrician</HI>, who acts always <HI>in Number, Weight, and Measure</HI>, the Great Creator and Provider for Mankind, and all Creatures whatso∣ever.</P>
<P N="3">(III.) Another Reason why I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations, is this; That the other Ancientest and best Historical Accounts now known, do, generally speaking, confirm the Accounts of Scripture, so far as they are concern'd. That this is a most na∣tural and sure way of discovering the Vera∣city of any pretended Ancient Histories in one Country, to compare them with the other Ancient and Approved Records of the Neigh∣bouring Nations, which had Concerns with them; or with any other Ancient Records that are of good Esteem relating to the same Times, and the same Affairs, is without Controversy among all Men. Accordingly, when we are
<PB N="271" REF="312"/>
examining the Veracity of the Sacred Writers of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, by whom almost all the Books of Scripture were written, it can∣not but be highly necessary to proceed by the same Method. Nor are our Unbelievers un∣appriz'd of the Fitness of this Procedure, when they appear so ready to alledge even the most poorly attested Antiquities of some other Nations, to oppose them to these well at∣tested Antiquities of the <HI>Jews</HI>: Which Pro∣cedure shews at once their Acknowledgment of the Reasonableness of this way of Enquiry; and yet the Weakness of their Cause upon such an Examination. For, give me leave to say, that if all the smaller Fragments, of even any tolerable Credit or Antiquity, which can be found in all the old Books, of which we have any Accounts, and may seem considerably to contradict the Sacred Records, were gathered together, and were compar'd with those most Ancient, Authentick, and Numerous Books and Fragments, which evidently support them, those I mean, collected by <HI>Josephus</HI> against <HI>Apion</HI>; by <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his Evangelical Prepara∣tion and Demonstration; by <HI>Huetius</HI> in his Evangelical Demonstration; by <HI>Grotius</HI> in his Truth of the Christian Religion; by <HI>Bochart</HI> in his <HI>Phaleg.</HI> and <HI>Hierozoican;</HI> by Bishop <HI>Stil∣lingfleet</HI> in his <HI>Origines Sacrae;</HI> and by many others who have written on that Noble Sub∣ject, the Difference of the Evidence would appear vastly great and surprizing. Insomuch that one of the greatest Masters of all that Ancient Learning, <HI>Grotius</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deveritar Relig. Christ. iii.14.</NOTE> does directly pro∣fess, that if we do not reckon some open Enemies to the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religions,
<PB N="272" REF="313"/>
who lived too late to know Things themselves, and were too partial to be believ'd without other Authority, there are not any Genuine Records, or Testimonies of Antiquity extant, that contradict the Scriptures. Which Thing being so, it is most highly reasonable for us to have a great Veneration for those Sacred Re∣cords, which, however different from Modern Histories, as they ought to be, are yet so very agreeable to, and so fully confirm'd by the other oldest and most faithful Remains of the Ancient Ages of the World.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Another Reason why I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations is this; that the more Learning has increased, the more certain in general do the Scripture Accounts appear, and its difficult Places have been more clear'd thereby. If Hypotheses, or Accounts of Things in any Kind, especially when they are strange and surprizing, be advanc'd or believ'd by any, and then put into the Method of Ex∣amination before the World, when it is im∣proving in Knowledge, and New certain Dis∣coveries are frequently made in all Parts of Learning; it is justly to be expected, that what is really true and well-grounded will stand the Test, and what is not so, will sink under it: The one will thereupon be approv'd and esta∣blished; and the other rejected and discarded. Thus it happens frequently in Human Opini∣ons; and by this means the Improvement of the Learning of these Two last Centu∣ries has done vast Service to Truth, by di∣stinguishing what is Solid and Genuine; from what is Trifling and Spurious. Thus
<PB N="273" REF="314"/>
we now generally know which Writings pre∣tending to Antiquity, or to belong to Ancient Authors of Reputation, are Genuine, and which are Supposititious; which till the late Revival of Critical Learning, were strangely confounded together. Thus the late Improvements in Astro∣nomy, particularly by Telescopes, and the won∣derful Discoveries of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>, have determin'd the Dispute between the <HI>Ptole∣maick</HI>, the <HI>Tychonick</HI>, and the <HI>Copernican</HI> Systems of the Heavens, in Favour of the last; which till lately was Matter of great Dis∣pute, even among the Astronomers themselves. And a great Number of other Examples might easily be alleg'd to the same Purpose. Let us then apply this Method of Trial, and see whether the Ancient Polite Learning of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> of Old; or the much greater and solider Learning of the Two last Centuries; the former of which grew up somewhat after the Times of the Old Testa∣ment, and the latter long after the Time of the New, has confirm'd or contradicted those Sacred Books of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI>; that we may the better judge of their Solidity and Authority. Now in this Enquiry, what <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI> has produc'd for the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion, in his Books against <HI>Apion</HI>, already quoted, may serve as a Specimen of the vast Advantage the <HI>Jewish</HI> Inspired Writings received from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Learning; of which he was a great Master. And what <HI>Grotius</HI> has produc'd for both the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and the clearing their Difficulties in his <HI>Truth of the Christian Religion</HI>, and Comments on
<PB N="274" REF="315" MS="y"/>
the Scripture, may be a Sample of the great Confirmation they all receive from the Revival of Ancient Learning in the last Ages; of which he was no less a Master. Nor, as I hope, will what has been above produc'd from the Modern Astronomy, Mathematicks, and Phi∣losophy, for the Support of the same Inspired Writings, be unfit to be esteemed a farther Spe∣cimen in general to the same Purpose. But that I may not seem wholly to content my self with what has been already observed by my self or others, under this Head, I shall produce a new Specimen or Two for the same Purpose. 'Tis well known what a Noise the Scepticks and Unbelievers make with the Un∣certainty of very Old Accounts, and very Old Books; the great Omissions, Additions or In∣terpolations that may easily have happen'd in them, during a Course of many Ages; and the consequent Uncertainty of the Books of the New, but especially of those of the Old Testa∣ment; and so, most of all, of the oldest Parts of it, such as the Five Books of <HI>Moses</HI>. Now in this Case the Revival of Learning, and of Languages, and the Inquisitiveness of this last Age, has procur'd us a most Noble Treasure, as an Attestation in this Matter, where it was least expected: And from the small Remainders of the Old <HI>Samaritans</HI>, still left about <HI>Sichem</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI>, we have lately recover'd the <HI>Penta∣teuch</HI> it self: Not as in later Ages, known and owned by the Body of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, or Two Tribes, spread over the World; but as peculiarly receiv'd and allowed by all the Twelve Tribes, before the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity;
<PB N="275" REF="316" MS="y"/>
as written in the Original Character used be∣fore that Captivity, by that whole Nation; and as continued down to, and received by the Remains of those Ten Tribes in <HI>Samaria</HI>, all the Times of their bitter Hatred to the other <HI>Jews</HI>, even to this very Day. So that this must needs be a Copy entirely distinct from the common <HI>Massorete</HI> one now current, and in all Probability much older than those from whence even the <HI>Septuagint</HI> made their Translation, long before the Times of our Saviour. Yet upon the Comparison of this <HI>Samaritan Penta∣teuch</HI>, with the common <HI>Hebrew</HI>, and with the <HI>Septuagint</HI>; abating the Diversity of some Chronological Numbers in them all, as to the Lives of the Patriarchs, before and after the Flood, of small Importance here, there appears but very little Difference between them; and none at all that I know of in any Points of Con∣sequence, either in History, Doctrine or Practice▪ So that for the main, it exceedingly strengthens the Authority of our present Copies of the <HI>Pentaleuch</HI>; and by Parity of Reason, of the present Copies in good measure of all the Books of the Old Testament, which do with us other∣wise stand upon the same Foot, and are usually of a much lower Antiquity than these Five Books of <HI>Moses</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. v. <HI>and</HI> xi.</NOTE> Tis also well known that the Scriptures affirm, what seems to us very sur∣prizing, and next to impossible, <HI>viz.</HI> that in the early Times of the World, Men commonly liv'd to many Hundred Years of Age; and that in particular before the Deluge, they liv'd frequently to near a Thousand; that after the Deluge, their Lives declin'd gradually from
<PB N="276" REF="317" MS="y"/>
Five or Six Hundred, to about Seventy or Eighty Years only; although from the Days of <HI>David</HI>, till this Time, that Age of Man has been at a Stand, and about that smallest Duration. This Account must be own'd to be bold and strange to us, after near 3000 Years Experience of the last and shortest Period of Human Life. But then, when we reflect that the Learning of <HI>Jose∣phus</HI> produc'd many strong Ancient Attestations to this Account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. I.4.</NOTE> which were then Extant; that the present <HI>Chinese Annals</HI>, lately disco∣ver'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chronol.</HI> p. 60 — 65</NOTE> exactly agree, so far as they are con∣cern'd; as I have elsewhere shewn; and that the present Numbers of Mankind upon the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 65 — 68.</NOTE> taken together with the usual Period of Years for their Increase and Doubling; and with the Number of Years that by the best Evi∣dence the Earth has been in its present State; do plainly require such longer Duration of Mens Lives, in those Ancient Ages: Which last ways of Trial are entirely owing to the new Improvements in Learning: We shall see Reason at once to believe the Truth of the Fact, how strange soever it may now appear; and to pay a due Deference to those Original Sacred Records, whence we were first and best inform'd of it. It cannot also but appear very strange at first Sight in the Old Testament, that <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> especially, should in so peculiar a Manner possess and make Use of a much greater Quantity of Silver and Gold than we have any like Examples of even in this Age; when yet by our Modern Navigation, the <HI>Indian</HI> Mines have yielded us such new Treasures of that Kind; and that yet after∣ward
<PB N="277" REF="318" MS="y"/>
the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation should lose those mighty Riches. Yet will all this appear very agreeable to Truth, if we consult Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>'s late Admirable Book, <HI>Of the Conjouning the History of the Old and New Testament</HI>, where in the very Beginning of it, he has trac'd the <HI>Jewish</HI> Navigation, and such its Effects, with the greatest Sagacity, and to the greatest Satis∣faction.</P>
<P>I might also instance in the Improvements in Sacred Chronology, by the Discovery of the Canon of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>; in the full Solutions of the Deluge long since past, and of the Conflagration yet to come; with many other Things of a like Nature, which the Modern Improvements and Discoveries have assisted us in; all still in exact Agreement with the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament: But because I have already hinted at these Matters under former Heads, and have elsewhere more fully insisted on them to the same Purpose, I shall no farther enlarge on them in this Place.</P>
<P N="5">(V.) I believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Reve∣lations to be true, because there have been ge∣nerally such standing Memorials preserv'd of the Truth of the Principal Facts, as give us great Assurances they were real. That this is a proper and usual way of preserving the Memory of past Actions, the Customs, and Medals, and Pillars, and Inscriptions, and So∣lemnities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Primitive Christ. Re∣viv'd</HI>, Vol. iii.C.2. §. 4. p. 174 — 179.</NOTE> and Sepulchral Monuments of all Nations, do Testify. And that both the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Legislators have remarkably taken the like Care and Method, I have elsewhere
<PB N="278" REF="319"/>
observ'd; to which I refer my Reader. Only give me leave to Instance here, in a few of these standing Memorials or Monuments which are not there taken Notice of, and which seem to me remarkable Confirmations of the Truth of the Sacred History, even in some of its least probable Branches. Thus the Accounts we have in <HI>Genesis</HI> iii. of the Fall of <HI>Adam</HI>, upon the Temptation of the Devil under the Appearance of a Serpent, and the Suggestion of his Wife; and the consequent Change of the State of our first Parents thereupon, is, in all its Branches, one of the most improbable and amazing Hi∣stories in the whole Bible. I mean even as taken barely and literally, and as expounded in the Old Christian Records themselves; with∣out those absurd Additions and Improvements which <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI>, with their Followers, have joined to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part vii. §. 4. p. 145. prius.</NOTE> Yet when I consider that the Remains and Memorials of this great Ca∣tastrophe already mentioned, are evidently true in Fact, and yet can no way be accounted for on any other Hypothesis; I submit my Faith to the Evidence of the Sacred History, so well attested to by the present State of Nature; and rather wait with Patience till Providence shall please to unravel the Mystery of this sur∣prizing Scene, than venture, by denying the Truth of the Facts, to oppose my self to that strong Evidence, which the <HI>Mosaick</HI> History, as attested to by those sensible Demonstrations, affords us.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Bishop</HI> Patrick <HI>on</HI> Gen, xix.24, 25.</NOTE> Thus the <HI>Dead Sea</HI>, or Lake of <HI>Sodom</HI>, with its known, but unexampled and surprizing Phaenomena, look as if they were the direct Remains of a terrible Earthquake, join'd
<PB N="279" REF="320"/>
with a more terrible Shower of Fire and Brim∣stone from Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. cvii 34.</NOTE> by which <HI>a fruitful Land was turned into a Salt</HI> and Sulphureous <HI>Sea, for the</HI> unnatural <HI>Wickedness of them that dwelt there∣in:</HI> Exactly according to the Sacred History of that terrible Destruction of those People, who at once Inhabited and Polluted that Noble Soil; and is become a seasonable and standing <HI>Exam∣ple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jude v.7.</NOTE> <HI>having suffered the Vengeance of an eternal</HI> or unquenchable <HI>Fire</HI>: Or, in the Words of the Author of the Book of Wisdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">x.7.</NOTE> <HI>Of whose Wickedness even to this Day, the wast Land that smoaketh is a Testimony; and Plants bearing Fruit, which never come to Ripeness; and a standing Pillar of Salt, a Monument of an un∣believing Soul</HI>.</P>
<P>Thus the Annual Feasts of the Passover, of Weeks, and of Tabernacles, among the Anci∣ent <HI>Jews</HI>, together with the Annual Baptism and Weekly Communion among the Ancient Christians; with their Solemnities of <HI>Easter, Ascension</HI>, and <HI>Pentecost</HI>; beside their imme∣diate Application to the Uses of Piety and Religion, did also admirably and constantly at∣test to the Truth of those wonderful Facts, whose Memorials they were; I mean the miraculous Deliverance of the <HI>Jews</HI> from the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, with their Legislation, and living in Tabernacles for forty Years in the Wilderness afterwards; and the Death and Resurrection, and Ascension of our Saviour; on which Facts the Two Institutions are principally founded. I might be very large and full under this Particular: But that would make this Argument too Disproportionate to the rest,
<PB N="280" REF="321"/>
and would lead me too far out of my Way: So I forbear; and proceed to De∣ciare,</P>
<P N="6">(VI.) That I therefore believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations to be true, because I am persuaded that neither of those Religions could possibly have been receiv'd, establish'd and preserv'd in the World, without such Won∣ders and Miracles as the Sacred History con∣tains, and which are undeniable Proofs of their coming from God. For, to say nothing here of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>, if we Consider but the Obstinacy and Perverseness of the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> in all Ages, and that still they did, to the utmost Times we can trace them in general, and as a Nation, most firmly believe, and openly submit, and most tenaciously adhere to the Doctrines, Discipline, Laws and Government delivered by <HI>Mosos</HI>; how strange, uneasy, or burdensome soever, several of the Particulars were; and did yet in great Numbers, on the Preaching of the Gospel, renounce many of those their for∣mer Opinions and Constitutions, of which otherwise they were so exceeding tenacious; and entirely receiv'd, believ'd and obey'd the Christian Revelation, on its first Appearance in the World; and this in Opposition to their former Prejudices, their certain Interests, their Reputation, and Desire of Self-preservation; nay at a Time when they knew they must frequently lose, and suffer, and die for this new Religion; and all this without any other Hopes than what belong'd to another World; and must be en∣tirely frustrated, if that Religion proved false: Considering all this, I say, it is, morally speak∣ing,
<PB N="281" REF="322"/>
impossible that such Numbers, of <HI>Jews</HI> especially, should submit successively to both these Religions, as they certainly did, without convincing and undoubted Miracles for their Confirmation.</P>
<P N="7">(VII.) I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Reve∣lation, because I perceive that that Nation, which all along Hated and Persecuted the Messengers and Prophets of God when they were alive, were yet forced to believe all along that they were true Messengers and Prophets of God, and their Writings of Divine Inspiration. This is to me a very remarkable Observation, a very Certain one, and of the greatest Consequence in this Enquiry. That the <HI>Jews</HI> were anciently a Stubborn, Disobedient, and Stiff-necked People, and not without the most forcible Methods to be reduc'd to the Observance of the Divine Laws, is evident in their whole History; that they all along, in particular, opposed <HI>Moses</HI>, and Re∣jected, and even Persecuted and Slew, the suc∣ceeding Prophets, when they were sent unto them to call them to Repentance and Amend∣ment, is alike evident therein: That yet they were forced to own, that these Men were the true Prophets of God, is equally plain therein; and is demonstrable from their constant Recep∣tion afterwards of those Writings wherein these Things appear, as Divinely Inspir'd, to this very Day. It is also clear in those very Writings still extant, that their Contents are so cutting and severe, without the least Tincture of Flat∣tery, or sparing them in their Vices, that no∣thing but a full Conviction of the Certainty of their Divine Mission and Authority, could ever
<PB N="282" REF="323"/>
induce them to a Reception of them. The Case in general of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Legislator and Prophets, was all along much the same with that of good <HI>Micaiah</HI>, in the Days of <HI>Ahab</HI>; concerning whom when <HI>Jehosophat</HI> enquired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings xxii.7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Is there not a Prophet of the Lord that we may enquire of him?</HI> Wicked <HI>Ahab</HI> reply'd, <HI>There is One Man</HI>, Mi∣caiah, <HI>the Son of</HI> Imlah, <HI>but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy Good concerning me, but Evil</HI>. Yet all this Hatred notwithstanding, <HI>Micaiah</HI>'s Denunciation of God's Judgments upon <HI>Ahab</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 19-38.</NOTE> followed with its immediate and dreadful Com∣pletion, soon convinc'd them all, that he was a true Prophet of God: And He is accordingly ever since allow'd to have been such by that whole Nation. And this has been equally true of the rest of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Prophets all along. which seems to me a strong Argument for their Veraci∣ty and Authority, as still absolutely undeniable among that Nation.</P>
<P N="8">(VIII.) I believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion to be True, because the Ancient and Present State of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation shews the Truth of their Law, and of the Scripture Prophecies relating to them. The Law of <HI>Moses</HI> did, in the plainest and most affecting manner, deliver such obliging Promi∣ses to that Nation, upon their keeping close to the Worship of the True God, and to the Obe∣dience of the Laws then delivered to them; with such terrible Threatnings upon their Reje∣ction of them, upon their Idolatry and Disobe∣dience; and the succeeding History and State of that Nation all along, does so clearly and parti∣cularly inform us of the Completion of those Promises and Threatnings to this very Day, as
<PB N="283" REF="324"/>
afford us the strongest Evidence for the Divine Authority of those Denunciations. [See Bishop <HI>Patrick</HI> on <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii.] Nor is the Case dif∣ferent in the particular Prophecies occurring in all the Old Testament, relating to their Descent into, and sojourning in <HI>Egypt</HI>; their <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity under <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>, and their Re∣storation under <HI>Cyrus</HI>; with their present long, and tedious Banishment from their own Coun∣try, without a Prophet, or King, or any Divine Revelation; with many other Circumstances of their Affairs, which have been evidently fulfilled in their proper Seasons. This Argument seems also to me of very great Weight. But because I have elsewhere insisted on it, in my <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Lectures</HI>, and in my <HI>Chronology of the Old Te∣stament</HI>, I shall not here enlarge, but refer the in∣quisitive Reader thither for his farther Satisfa∣ction. Only I may be allow'd here to put the Unbelievers in mind, how peculiar and unpa∣rallel'd the State of this People has ever been. That at first they were separated from the rest of the World; that they lived in it afterward like a separate Species of Creatures; that after all their Miseries and Captivities, they have still preserved themselves a separate People, and still recovered their ancient Land and Settlement again in a wonderful manner, till this their last grand Captivity and Dispersion; and that the Body of the two Tribes, and some Remains of the Ten at least, are even now, to the Surprize of all considering Men, after some Thousands of Years a separate Body, unmixt with other Nations, among which they sojourn; as at once a stand∣ing Monument of the Truth of their original
<PB N="284" REF="325"/>
Sacred Books, and waiting in readiness for their final Restoration, according to the same Prophe∣cies.</P>
<P N="9">(IX.) I believe the Christian Religion in parti∣cular to be true, because the Ancient and Present State of the Christian Church shews the Truth of the Original Records of Christianity, and of the Scripture Prophecies relating to them. The Author of our Religion, and his Apostles, re∣ferr'd the <HI>Jews</HI> to the many Predictions concern∣ing their <HI>Messias</HI> occurring in the Old Testa∣ment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiv.15. Mar. xiii.14.10. Dan. ix.24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mat. xxiv &amp; passim alibi.</NOTE> particularly that famous one now known by the Name of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s 70 <HI>Weeks</HI>, which they could not then deny to be fulfilled in him: They foretold that Opposition, and Persecution, which the Christian Religion should meet with in its Propagation; that yet it should gradually pre∣vail over the World, notwithstanding such Op∣position and Persecution: That the Body of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, with their Temple and Worship should, for a Punishment of their heinous Sins in Crucifying their <HI>Messias</HI>, and Persecuting his Followers, in that very Generation of Men, be utterly subverted and destroyed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. xxi.24.</NOTE> that the <HI>Jews should fall by the Edge of the Sword; that they should be led away Captive into all Nations; and that</HI> Jerusalem <HI>should be trodden down of the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>till the Times of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>should be fullfilled</HI>: That the Church of Christ should at first be Pure and Holy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiv. 2 Thess. ii. 1 Joh. iv.3. Apoc. pas∣sim.</NOTE> But that after some time false Teachers and Hereticks should corrupt it: That at <HI>Rome</HI> or Mystical <HI>Babylon</HI> especially, a Grand Apostacy or Antichristian State should arise, and over-bear and corrupt true Christiani∣ty, and under Ten Antichristian Kingdoms, in∣troduce Tyranny and Idolatry into it for 1260
<PB N="285" REF="326"/>
Years together; till after which time the Church should not be able to recover her Primitive Pu∣rity; with many other such great, and strange, and, when the Christian Books were written, most highly improbable Events; all which have eminently and notoriously come to pass in the Face of all the World, as the most convin∣cing Demonstrations of the Verity and Divini∣ty of the Christian Religion. I have else∣where largely treated of the greatest Part of these Predictions, in my Essay on the Reve∣lation of St. <HI>John</HI>, and shewn the Exactness of their Completion, I shall not therefore enlarge any farther upon them in this Place.</P>
<P N="11">(XI) I believe the Christian Religion to be true, because the Ancient Adversaries of Chri∣stianity acknowledged the Miracles whereon the Christian Religion is founded. to be True. I here insist only on the Confession of Adversaries as to the Truth of the Facts on which the <HI>Chri∣stian Religion</HI> depends: Not that I doubt of the like Confession as to the Miracles wrought by <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, for the Confirma∣tion of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion, where-ever their Ad∣versaries had means of knowing the same. But because we have but a few Records, or rather Fragments of Records, now extant from the Heathen Writers, contemporary with those of the Old Testament; and of them still fewer that relate distinctly to the ancientest and principal <HI>Jewish</HI> Miracles, I chuse to confine this Observa∣tion to the Christian Miracles. And that these Facts themselves were originally allow'd to be true by the Enemies of Christianity, appears, not only from the Conversion of vast Multitudes
<PB N="286" REF="327"/>
of those Enemies by the convictive Evidence of such Miracles to the Faith of Christ, which I have shewed could not have happen'd if they had not been satisfy'd of their Reality; but by the History of the New Testament, and the Mention there of the Objections made against that Religion, which all supposed the same Re∣ality; and by the Remains of the ancientest Writers against Christianity, whether among the <HI>Jews</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Just. Dialog. <HI>with</HI> Try∣pho. Ori∣gen <HI>against</HI> Celsus. <HI>Recognit. passim.</HI></NOTE> such as <HI>Trypho</HI>; among the Heathens, such as <HI>Celsus</HI>; or among the old Hereticks, such as <HI>Simon Magus</HI>; which do almost unani∣mously confess, and take for granted, that Christ and his Apostles did work such Miracles for the Confirmation of the Christian Religion, as the Christian Records do plainly testify at this Day. And I dare appeal to all our present Scepticks and Unbelievers, whether they can possibly per∣suade themselves, as the Old Infidels did, that the Christian Religion is false, notwithstanding there were very many real Miracles certainly wrought for its Confirmation: I believe they are not so weak; and I hope not so wicked neither as this comes to.</P>
<P N="12">(XII) I do therefore believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations to be true, because the Sa∣cred Writers, who liv'd in Times and Places so remote from one another, do yet all carry on One and the Same Grand Design, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Salvation of Mankind, by the Worship of, and Obedience to, the One true God, in and through the King <HI>Messiah</HI>; which without a Divine Conduct and Inspiration, reaching through those Ages and Places, could never have been done. This Observation is very remarkable as to the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Writings, if they be compar'd
<PB N="287" REF="328"/>
with the several Books of the <HI>Greek</HI> Philoso∣phers; the former of which never dispute or debate what their main Scope was to be, or what they were to have ever in View, as ever naturally tending to one known Design be∣forementioned; while the latter were so far from any common Principles of that Nature, that the very Design they were to aim at, or the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> it self, the supreme Happiness of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. Au∣gust. De Civitat. Dei. L.xix 1.</NOTE> was a Matter of wonderful Debate among them. Nay, <HI>Varro</HI>, one of their most famous Authors, is said to have reckon'd up no fewer than 288 possible Opinions about it. And 'tis very plain, that the due Worship and bliss∣ful Enjoyment of the One True God, and that by the Means of the King <HI>Messiah</HI>; or indeed any other such Noble and Divine Means of at∣taining them, are almost wholly Strangers to the Heathen Philosophers. And no wonder, when they were so far from knowing the Nature and Will of the One True God, with the true Wor∣ship and Obedience due to him, which yet were knowable to Inquisitive Honest Minds by the Light of Nature; or from owning the Necessity of a Mediator, or of Divine Revelation; that they did not generally acknowledge the One True God himself; much less did they make the Worship of, and Obedience to him, the Foundation of their Doctrine; as all sound Philosophy, as well as Divinity, ought certainly to have done. Accordingly, tho' they all agreed in the Excellency of Virtue in general, which God has too deeply stamp'd upon Human Souls, and made too evidently necessary in general to Human Happiness, even in this World, to per∣mit
<PB N="288" REF="329"/>
it to be overlook'd by any thinking Men; yet did they agree in almost nothing else. And in∣deed, their several Philosophical <HI>Dogmata</HI>, seem like our Modern School-Divinity, to have been rather creditable Kinds of Amusements, and Sub∣jects for the Exercise of Wit and Parts in Di∣sputation, than directed to the real Instruction and Improvement of Mankind in true Religion, or in the Attainment of Happiness, either in this or in another World; which is the main View of the Holy Scriptures. And accordingly the Variety of Opinions, and the Frequency of Disputes among those Philosophers, did but nou∣rish this disputacious Humour of the several Parties; and this without any Prospect of the real Discovery of Truth, or of reducing Men to a regular and religious Way of Life, in order to their future Happiness; which for cer∣tain ought to be the grand Intention of all our Philosophical and Religious Enquiries. Let but any one compare the unanimous Agreement of all the Sacred Writers, from <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Polycarp</HI>, in the main Scheme of Divine Revelation, and Conduct of Human Life; with the almost entire Disagreement and Uncertainty there is as to such important Matters among the Heathen Philoso∣phers; so far I mean as those Matters are known to be deriv'd from Revelation; and he will soon see a vast Difference between them; and will not be able to account for it, without allowing the former to be of Supernatural and <HI>Divine</HI>, and the latter of bare <HI>Human Original</HI>.</P>
<P N="13">(XIII) I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations, because the principal Do∣ctrines therein delivered are agreeable to the
<PB N="289" REF="330"/>
ancientest Traditions of all other Nations. For tho', as I have just been observing, the Heathen Philosophers among the <HI>Greeks</HI>, who were com∣paratively later, and more modern, and who fol∣lowed their own Reasonings in all such Matters, were mighty uncertain, and various in their Philosophical and Religious Notions; as all Men are when they have no better guidance than Hu∣man Supposal and Conjecture; Yet was it quite otherwise with the more ancient Ages, and those Natural and Divine Doctrines which they re∣ceived by Tradition from their first Founders, and which most probably were originally deriv'd from the first Parents of Mankind, or at least from the earliest of their Progenitors after the Deluge. Those I mean whose Traces and Frag∣ments are still extant in the earliest Sacred Books of the <HI>Egyptians, Druids, Tyrians</HI>, and <HI>Brachmans</HI>, in the Remains of <HI>Trismegistus</HI>, of <HI>Orpheus</HI>, and <HI>Zoroastres</HI>, &amp;c. and in the <HI>Sibylline</HI> Oracles; those Parts I mean, of them which are well attested to by <HI>Heathen, Jewish</HI>, and <HI>Christian</HI> Antiquity. These most ancient Traditions, as has been large∣ly and fully shewn by <HI>Grotius</HI>, Bishop <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> and many others, do, for the main, admirably agree with the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations; not only as to the particular Histories and Facts contained in the <HI>Old Testament</HI>, of which already▪ but as to the principal Points on which those Religions are grounded; I mean, the Unity and Attributes of God; the Creation of the World by him; its Deluge already past, and Confla∣gration still future; the Immortality of Human Souls; and the Judgment to come; with the Rewards and Punishments of the next World▪ This Agreement of the most Ancient Heathen
<PB N="290" REF="331"/>
Traditions, and that in several Parts of the World, with the like Contents of the Sacred Writings of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI>, cannot but be a mighty Attestation to them, both as to those particular momentous Points themselves, and also, in a good Degree, to the rest of their Con∣tents, so far as they are any way connected with, or belong to them. Insomuch that He who is an Infidel, in those fundamental Articles espe∣cially, must not only oppose himself to the In∣spired Records of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI>, but also to the best and oldest Remains we have in all others Nations, relating to the same Do∣ctrines.</P>
<P N="14">(XIIII) I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Records, notwithstanding the Difficul∣ties thereto relating, because I observe that those Difficulties do not affect the Truth of the Facts, or Assertions, on which those Religions are grounded, but the Conduct of Providence only; the Reasons of which Conduct are no Parts of those Religions; and accordingly the Sacred Writers do never pretend fully to know, or to reveal them to Mankind. This I take to be an Observation of great Weight, and yet not suffi∣ciently taken notice of by any; <HI>viz.</HI> That those Inspired Writers, who deliver us the most im∣portant Messages and Commands in the Name of God▪ with the utmost Assurance; who re∣late the most surprizing Miracles, and that as done, or seen by themselves, and many others openly, with the greatest Boldness; who de∣nounce Threatnings, or promise Blessings, quite beyond their own Ability to make good, with the most assured Confidence; who reprove Prin∣ces and People as to Crimes of the highest Na∣ture,
<PB N="291" REF="332"/>
even while they were entirely under their Power, and in their Hands, with the utmost Freedom and Courage; and who in their whole Conduct ever show a perfect satisfaction in the Truth of their Mission, and Certainty of their Inspiration from God; do yet rarely or not at all meddle with the Reasons of Providence, the Ju∣stification of the Divine Orders, or the Vindica∣tion of the Justice and Goodness of God in such his Dispensations by them. Nay, the rest of the Prophets or Apostles, excepting our Blessed Saviour himself, do generally seem equally puz∣zled and surprized at several of those Dispensa∣tions; and are found as ready to expostulate, tho' generally in a decent and most humble manner, with God, concerning such his strange and sur∣prizing Procedure, as other Men, no way con∣cern'd in any such Divine Dispensations at all. Thus, for Example, we find in the ancientest Book now extant in the whole Bible, and pro∣bably in the whole World, I mean the Book of <HI>Job</HI>, the same Difficulties and Disputes about the Conduct of Providence, the Prosperity of the Wicked, and Afflictions of the Righteous, that we every where else meet with in other Au∣thors. And, what is most of all remarkable, we here find, that when God himself is intro∣duc'd, as finally determining those Debates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">xxxviii.xxxix.xl.</NOTE> it is done without Assignation of the particular Reasons for their Procedure; any farther, than the noble Representation of the Power and Wis∣dom of the Almighty in general, and the Mean∣ness and Inability of his Creature Man, and the consequent Submission due from the one to the other, may be thought sufficient for that Pur∣pose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. lxxiii▪</NOTE> Thus we find the <HI>Psalmist</HI> equally sur∣priz'd
<PB N="292" REF="333"/>
at the same strange Conduct of Provi∣dence, and hardly able to extricate himself from the Difficulties therein; even with all the Ad∣vantages of the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Religion, and the more constant Happiness of the Good, and Afflictions of the Bad under it, than in any other Nations of the World. Thus also we find the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xii.i. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> one whom God frequently made use of in his Revelations to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, and who endured the severest Imprisonment for his Faithfulness to his Duty as a Prophet; was equally shock'd and surpriz'd at the same seem∣ingly unequal and partial Conduct of Provi∣dence; and complains to God of it; yet with∣out any full or satisfactory Answer: And the like Observations may be made as to <HI>Solomon</HI>, and others of the Inspired Writers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. passim. <HI>See</HI> 4 <HI>Esd.</HI> pas∣sim.</NOTE> While yet, these their Difficulties and Complaints, never in the least made them doubt or dispute about the Cer∣tainty of their Mission and Inspiration; about the Truth of the Promises and Threatnings they denounced from God; or about the Reality of the Miracles that were performed in his Name. Accordingly I observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recogn. passim.</NOTE> that <HI>Simon Magus</HI>, with his old Followers among the Hereticks, who al∣lowed the Truth of the Facts and Miracles of the Gospel, did only make use of such Reasons as were taken from the seeming Injustice, and Unaccountableness of several Parts of Provi∣dence, in order to subvert Christianity. Nor is the Case much different among our present Un∣believers; who being not able to find any good Grounds to overthrow the Truth and Certainty of the Prophetick and Miraculous Attestations, which the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> allege for the
<PB N="293" REF="334"/>
Divinity of their Religion, do commonly pro∣ceed after the same manner, and muster up all the Arguments they are able from the like In∣stances of Providence, or Passages in Scripture which seem to them absurd and unreasonable. Now what is the natural Result of all this? But that, as the Scriptures every where allow and suppose, God's proper Time for unravelling the Mysteries of his Providence, <HI>the Day for the Revelation of his righteous Judgment</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ii.5.</NOTE> is not yet come; that he has yet, during all this Inter∣val, afforded sufficient Demonstrations of the Certainty of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revela∣tion's Derivation from him notwithstanding; which is the proper State of this Matter, and ought to be the proper Measures of our own Faith and Practice accordingly. For as the Difficulties are there and only there, where Di∣vine Revelation does not pretend they are yet cleared; so is there no certain Difficulties, so far as the same Revelation pretends to Evidence and Demonstration, for what it recommends to us; which Case methinks highly deserves the Con∣sideration of our Modern Scepticks and Un∣believers.</P>
<P N="14">(X<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>V.) Natural Religion, which is yet so cer∣tain in its self, is not without such Difficulties, as to the Conduct of Providence, as are object∣ed to Revelation; and therefore none that be∣lieve the former, ought to be deterr'd by such Difficulties from believing the latter. This is also a somewhat uncommon, but certainly not an improper Observation, as to the Credibility of Divine Revelation, to all those I mean who are not entirely Atheists, or against all Divine Providence. Thus we find in the Conduct of
<PB N="294" REF="335"/>
Natural Providence some such strange <HI>Phenome∣na</HI> as are not easily accountable, or reconcileable to the most becoming Notions we all have of the One, Wise, Just, and Beneficent Creator and Governor of the Universe. We find such Anti∣pathies of even one brute Creature against ano∣ther; such a vast Number of those Creatures destroy'd immediately upon their Birth; such sudden and untimely Deaths that frequently happen to many others of them in the Course of Things; such a vast Number of them de∣voured by other brute Creatures, by Men, nay, sometimes by those of their own Species: We find in the State of Mankind, even abstracted from Re∣velation, so many Miseries and Calamities every where in the World, involving the several Indi∣viduals from their Birth to their Grave, and those often no way to be avoided or cured by any Me∣thods of Prudence, or Virtue, or Religion it self, as affords great Difficulties to thinking Per∣sons, and have occasion'd abundance of Hypo∣theses, in order to their Reconciliation with a general Providence: And after all, are in great Measure equally difficult to us, as they have been to the past Ages of the World. If there∣fore, these great Objections notwithstanding, the Arguments for Natural Providence do still appear cogent and undeniable, as indeed they now do more than ever; and all wise Men ra∣ther chuse to believe what they have full Exter∣nal Evidence for in Natural Religion, although they cannot yet solve all the Difficulties therein why do not we proceed after the same Fair and Impartial Manner in the Business of Revelation? And equally believe those Scriptures, for which we have such strong and cogent Arguments,
<PB N="295" REF="336"/>
although we cannot yet solve all the Difficulties contained in them? Especially when I may venture to say, the Case of Divine Revelation, compar'd with Natural Religion, is, as to this Point, not at all to the Disadvantage of the former; and that the Objections against Na∣tural, are not at all Inferior to those against Re∣veal'd Religion: As any Impartial Man will easily confess upon the Comparison.</P>
<P N="16">(XVI) I therefore believe the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Revelations to be true, because the Re∣cords of the same, or the Books of the Old and New Testament, have the greatest Marks of Honesty and Impartiality of all others; and withal, have none of those known Marks of Knavery and Imposture, which all false and spurious Writings must certainly have. These Observations seem to me highly useful, and very certain and obvious, upon a careful Perusal, and exact Comparison: But because they are common, and frequently insisted on by others, and if enlarg'd upon, would take up too great a Room here, I shall chuse to refer the Reader to those who have already treated of those Subjects; particularly to our excellent Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>, in his Appendix to the Life of the Impostor <HI>Mahomet</HI>.</P>
<P>Only I beg of the Inquisitive Reader him∣self to reflect on this Head, as he reads the Sa∣cred Histories, and to consider with himself how very improbable it is that those Sacred Accounts, which of all other Ancient Writings now Extant, have evidently the greatest internal Marks of Sincerity, and the least imaginable Signs of Falshood of all others, should yet be the grossest Forgeries, and most notorious Im∣postures in the whole World: As upon the Sup∣position
<PB N="296" REF="337" MS="y"/>
of their being untrue, they must most certainly appear to be to all Mankind.</P>
<P N="16">(XVI.) I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations, because the Scripture Pre∣dictions have been still fulfilled in the several Ages of the World whereto they belong. This is an eminent and open Method of trying the Truth, or Falshood, of any pretended Revela∣tion, which is so explicit as to foretel future Events; especially those that are very remote, and depend mainly on the free Actions of Men, or on the Counsels of God, and the State of the Invisible World; such as the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations most certainly are. And to this Completion do I venture openly to ap∣peal, for the Justification of those Institutions. Accordingly, I dare venture to affirm, with St. <HI>Peter</HI>, that this Character of a <HI>more sure Word of Prophecy</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. i.16.</NOTE> is one of the strongest Ar∣guments for the Truth of the Scriptures, of all other whatsoever. I have already shew'd else∣where, how exactly the Sacred Predictions that belong to Times already past, and were extant in the Days of <HI>David</HI>; as also not a few of those belonging to Christianity afterward, have been exactly fulfilled in their appointed Times, in my <HI>Sermons at Mr.</HI> Boyle's <HI>Lectures</HI>, in my <HI>Chro∣nology and Harmony</HI>, in my <HI>Essay on the Revelation of St.</HI> John, and lately in my <HI>Literal Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecies</HI>. And I declare I am so far from seeing any Reason from the present Posture of Affairs in the World, to doubt of the Completion of those which remain, even for the main, as I have expounded them, that I rather find great Cause to believe, that the Prophetick Scheme begins to clear up apace, and that the
<PB N="297" REF="338" MS="y"/>
<HI>Kingdoms of this World</HI>, as is there Predicted, will in no long Time (and this probably, as moved in Part by the Plainness of the Com∣pletion of some of the Sacred Predictions just now past, or soon coming on) <HI>become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. xi.15.</NOTE> <HI>and that he shall Reign for ever and ever</HI>. But this important Matter has been so particularly treated of by me elsewhere, in the Treatises already referr'd to, that it is by no means proper to enlarge upon it here any farther; Only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiv.15.xi.15.</NOTE> <HI>Whoso Readeth, let him understand. He that hath Ears to Hear, let him Hear.</HI></P>
<P N="17">(XVII.) I am therefore obliged to admit the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations to be true, and Divine; because no opposite System of the Uni∣verse, or Scheme of Divine Revelation, has any tolerable Pretences to be true, or can be compar'd, as to Evidence, with those of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stians</HI>. Whither would our Atheists or Deists have us go for Information or Satisfaction, in our most concerning Enquiries about the State of the Universe, and of Religion, and of our Souls hereafter, if we must discard the Holy Scriptures? Must we go to any other Records, as better attested to? This I believe they will not say. Must we have Recourse to the ex∣ploded and absurd Schemes of the Eternity of the World, and the Fatality of all Things; or to that greater Absurdity of the Formation and Dissolution of the Universe by the For∣tuitous Concourse of Atoms? This also, I be∣lieve they will now not much insist upon. Must we then rely on Natural Religion, and the Voice of common Reason for our Guidance to Happiness? This Rule, so far as it can go,
<PB N="298" REF="339"/>
is entirely allow'd and improv'd by the Scri∣ptures, and does it self naturally lead us farther to Divine Revelation, as the only Security of not erring in many Cases, especially those of Divine Worship, and Propitiation; and the principal Means of discovering the Certainty of such future Rewards and Punishments, as are in many Cases absolutely necessary to support the Observance of the Laws of Nature. Must we, I say, take our Leaves of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations, which have such Mighty Attestations as coming from God, and trust our selves wholly to our own Human, Frail, and Uncertain Imaginations, Inclinations, and Con∣jectures in Divine Matters? This seems very hard, and very unreasonable. Let us suppose that the Philosophy and Religion we now are in Possession of, have several difficult Places, and some hitherto unaccountable Phaenomena in them: Yet for certain may we justly expect to have a better Philosophy and Religion to be∣take our selves to, before we leave these; I mean better attested, and freer from Perplexities and Incumbrances, both in Faith and Practice; otherwise we shall act absurdly; and imitate the Folly of him who pulls down his present House, on Account of some apparent Inconveniencies therein, without either the Skill or the Ability to build a better in its Stead. And for my self, I venture to promise all the Scepticks and Unbelievers of our Age, that as soon as ever they will shew me a Scheme of Philosophy and Religion more Rational, and better Attested to than that of the <HI>Christian</HI>, which is the Per∣fection of the <HI>Jewish</HI> also, I will be their Proselyte: But till then they must excuse me.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="340"/>These, Reader, are some of the Arguments and Motives which induce me really to believe, and conscienciously to endeavour to live up to the <HI>Christian</HI> Institution, and to ad∣mit the Holy Scriptures for Divinely Inspired: And I heartily wish they may have the same Influence upon every Reader; that so they may <HI>with the Heart believe unto Righteousness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. x.10.</NOTE> <HI>and with the Mouth make Confession unto Salvation</HI>. One Thing I will add here; that since we cannot act upon Motives and Arguments any farther than we can know them; nor can we go upon Evidence any farther than it is extant in the World for our Examination; and since the Justice of God can only require us to act upon the Motives and Evidence his Providence affords us, and can only call us to an Account for our Behaviour in Agreement with such Motives and Evidence; I venture to say, with great Assurance, that whatever be the Truth of the Things themselves, which we can no otherwise determine about, the Argu∣ments and Evidence now Extant in the World do for the main, so greatly and undoubtedly <HI>preponderate</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Revelations, that we are bound by all the Rules of Justice, and Reason, and good Sense, to prefer it, to be determin'd by it, and act upon it; and that therefore those who do otherwise may justly be call'd to Account, and punish'd for the contrary Procedure, for their Infidelity and Disobedience; seeing these are chosen in Defiance of plainly greater, and plainly <HI>superior. Evidence</HI> for the Divine Authority of the Sacred Writings.</P>
<P>I conclude the whole with Two remarkable Passages, taken from the Two great Apostles St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI>, and with the Recommen∣dation
<PB N="300" REF="341"/>
of Three Genuine Memorials of the most Primitive Martyrs: and I pray God they may equally affect others, as they always do my self, while I consider them as the Solemn Attestations of such Persons, who most of them certainly knew whether the Religion they Preach'd was Divine or not; and as generally made a little be∣fore their Deaths also; when, if ever, Men use to be serious, sincere, and in earnest in such their Declarations.</P>

Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in Re∣membrance of these Things, though ye know them, and be established in the present Truth. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance: Knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. Moreover, I will endea∣vour that you may be able after my Decease to have these Things always in Remembrance. For we have not followed cunningly devised Fables, when we made known unto you the Power and Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were Eye-Witnesses of his Majesty. For he received from God the Father, Honour and Glory, when there came such a Voice to him from the Excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this Voice which came from Hea∣ven we heard, when we were with him in the Holy Mount. [See</HI> Matt. xvii. 1—13.]</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="342"/>Paul.] <HI>I charge thee therefore</HI> [Timothy] <HI>before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. iv. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>who shall judge the Quick and the Dead, at his appearing, and his King∣dom: Preach the Word, by instant in Season, out of Season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-suffering and Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But watch thou in all things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 5—8.</NOTE> <HI>endure Afflicti∣ons, do the Work of an Evangelist, make full Proof of thy Ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day: And not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</HI></P>
<P>The Genuine Memorials of the Martyrs which I would here recommend, (and they are almost all the Memorials of that Kind, which appear to be very Ancient and certainly Genuine) are, the Epistle of St. <HI>Ignatius</HI>, Bishop of <HI>Antioch</HI>, to the <HI>Romans</HI>, as he was going to Martyrdom: The Epistle of the Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI>, concerning the Martyr∣dom of St. <HI>Polycarp</HI> their Bishop: And the Epi∣stle of the Churches of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Lyons</HI>, con∣cerning the Martyrs under the Persecution of <HI>Ve∣rus</HI> in <HI>Eusebius</HI>: All which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Eccl. V. 1.</NOTE> if they do not in some measure Affect Men, and make them sensi∣ble, that the first Christians, even those who certainly knew whether Christianity was true or not, were in earnest, and believed themselves, their Hearts are <HI>as hard as the nether Milstone</HI>, and past all ordinary Ways of Influence and Conviction.</P>
