<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS History was original∣ly intended to have been published last Summer, but on my saying I designed in my Preface to give a short account of my Life; several Gentlemen and Ladies insisted on my swelling my Narrative to a Volume, which in Compliance to their Request I did; which was the Consequence of retard∣ing
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
the Publication of this. I have endeavoured to do Justice to every Character according to their different Merits. And I dare say, there is not a young Lady in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that would not wish to be the wor∣thy Imi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ator of Miss <HI>Evelyn</HI> in each Action of her Life. Nor is her Father less worthy, be∣ing a general Example for the Male Part of the Creation; whatever Faults may be criti∣cally observed in the Diction, I hope will be in Part attoned for, by endeavouring to keep up the noble Sentiments of Virtue so entirely consistent with the true Character of an honest Soul, whether dignified with Title, or
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
only aggrandized with innate Principles of Honour, Justice, and Humanity.</P>
<P>I shall trouble my Reader no further, than to wish my Endeavour to entertain them may succeed, and by the Sale of my Book shall be able to judge, whether I shall ever dare to make any farther Attempt of this Nature.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Some Account of Mr. <HI>Dumont's</HI> Family.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Henry Dumont, the sub∣ject of the following sheets, was a native of France, and only son of Mr. Archi∣bald Dumont, (a gentleman of immense fortune and good extraction) by his mo∣ther's side descended from a noble family, she being the daughter and sole heiress of the Count Destrades, who became a
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
widower when this young lady was but four years of age: The extreme regard he had for the memory of her much la∣mented mother, considerably added to his care of this tender pledge of their af∣fections. Who in her infancy gave lively hopes of becoming what she pro∣ved, the wonder of the age, and a glo∣rious example to posterity.</P>
<P>She was early instructed in the several branches of polite literature, which with the necessary accomplishments of music, singing, dancing, &amp;c. she was justly accounted the paragon of art and nature's workmanship.</P>
<P>At the age of eighteen, her papa carried her to court, being the first time of her appearance there; the reader may easily conceive the magnificence of her dress on this occasion, but her sparkling jewels were totally eclipsed by the bril∣liancy of her angelic form, which natu∣rally attracted the eyes of the whole circle.</P>
<P>When she was presented to the King, on offering to kneel to kiss his hand, he scarce permitted her to bend her knee; assuring her he thought so noble and a∣miable
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
a form, rather seemed born to fill a throne than kneel to it: in short, his majesty was so captivated with the tran∣scendency of her beauty, that he fell in∣to a deep and sudden melancholly, which considerably increased each time this fair one visited the court.</P>
<P>This surprizing change in the monarch universally astonished every one who had the honour of paying their personal re∣spects, as he was naturally of a gay and cheerful disposition; no one could con∣ceive what could be the motive of so melancholly an alteration; but the true cause was known to a particular favourite, who was privy to all his majesty's secrets in love affairs; and having liberty to say on those occasions what he thought pro∣per, advised him to cure his malady, by loading the Count with such prefer∣ments, that he should think himself o∣bliged to yield him up his daughter in return.</P>
<P>Alass! said the King, his fortune is so great, he never thought it worth his while to accept of any places, tho' con∣siderable ones have been offered him in my father's reign; therefore I have
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
very little reason to hope for success from a scheme of that nature.</P>
<P>Why then, replied the evil councellor, you must have recourse to other strata∣gems; and not let a nation suffer in the loss of a glorious monarch for a puny girl. And with your majesty's per∣mission, I will use my best endeavours to procure this beauty for you.</P>
<P>The King overcome by love and im∣patient desire, gave in to all his confi∣dant proposed; who was dispatched to the Count with a message to attend him in private.</P>
<P>His lordship directly obeyed the sum∣mons, and after some discourse upon in∣different matters had passed between them; my lord, said the King, I must thank you for the favour you did the court, in bringing to it one of the most shining ornaments it e'er was graced with. And to convince you how much I esteem the lady, I beg you will permit me to make her an offer, of one of the highest posts of honour, that she may be more frequent in her visits here; and that your lordship would make choice of any place on your part, that I might be com∣pleatly
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
happy, in having constantly near me two of the most valuable persons in my kingdom.</P>
<P>The Count bowed, and thanking his majesty for the honour he did him, hoped he would not think he wanted a proper sense of his goodness, in excusing him∣self from accepting his offer; adding, that he should ever find him a loyal subject, and a firm adherent to his interest; but he resolved never to be a motive of envy by entering into any employment at court; and that his sword should be ready in his defence or his country's good, if occasion should require it; and that without any other reward, than the mere desire of manifesting his duty and fidelity.</P>
<P>The King finding him positively bent against this proposal, no longer detained him. The Count took leave, and hastened home, immediately ordering his travelling equipage to be got rea∣dy to escort him and Lady Charlotte to his country seat.</P>
<P>The family were under great conster∣nation at this sudden and hasty removal, but the Count's quick apprehension of
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
the King's design upon his daughter, would not permit him to stay long enough to give any other reason for it than his will to have it so.</P>
<P>Lady Charlotte, who was no less sur∣prized than the rest, would not offer to enquire into the matter; judging her papa's commands a sufficient motive for her obedience.</P>
<P>Orders were left to report to his ma∣jesty, that the Count was taken dange∣rously ill; to prevent any jealousy that might arise from his non-appearance at the drawing-room; and to conceal his absence for a few days, till he had ef∣fected a design, which would prevent a∣ny future attacks upon the lady's virtue. And if any letters were sent, they should be carefully conveyed to his lordship.</P>
<P>This charge was left with one Mr. Evelyn, an English gentleman, who had formerly been possessed of a very good estate, but repeated misfortunes had reduced him to so low an ebb, he was obliged to take refuge in a foreign country, for the security of his person; and with a small remainder of his wreck'd fortune, he and his lady em∣barked
<PB N="7" REF="17" MS="y"/>
for France, where his great sense and learning soon recommended him to the acquaintance of people of the highest distinction; who were conti∣nually solliciting him for his company. Among the rest the noble Count Destrades was particularly charmed with his under∣standing, and his wife's, who was e∣qually coveted by the ladies.</P>
<P>The Count's approbation grew into a friendship for this unfortunate couple; insomuch, that he took them entirely under his protection. And as Mr. Evelyn was remarkable for his scholar∣ship, made him tutor, and his spouse governess to lady Charlotte, by which means, she soon became mistress of the English tongue; and translated several Latin, French, and Italian authors. She was about five years of Age when Mr. Evelyn first saw her, from which time, the Count left her entirely to his, and Mrs. Evelyn's care; which charge they acquitted with great honour to them∣selves, and universal admiration of all who had the pleasure of seeing an in∣stance of their power, in making lady Charlotte one of the most accomplish'd
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
of her sex. Her governess who sung, and play'd the harpsichord finely, in∣structed her in those two excellent qua∣lifications, in which she was not inferior to the most skilfull masters.</P>
<P>The Count and his lovely daughter's sweetness of disposition, rendered Mr. Evelyn's life (tho' in a state of de∣pendance) a continued scene of ease and chearfulness; and he often declared him∣self happier in this retreat, than when in the highest affluence of his fortune.</P>
<P>But to return to the Count and Lady Charlotte, whom we have left on the road; the kind father thinking his daugh∣ter might be uneasy, from being igno∣rant of the cause of this unexpected jour∣ney, thought it proper to unfold the mystery, and thus addressed her.</P>
<P>I fear, my dearest child, you are ap∣prehensive of some mistake at court, that may have caused this extraordinary expedition; but to ease your mind in that respect, I must inform you, it pro∣ceeds from my tender regard for your person and honour; both which the King has formed a cruel design against; 'tis needless to tell you what passed be∣tween
<PB N="9" REF="19" MS="y"/>
us; let it suffice I have protected you from his utmost efforts to undo you. And should his resentment and disap∣pointment urge him to level at my head, I had rather lose that, than bear the more deadly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>troke of seeing thee become a sa∣crifice to lawless love.</P>
<P>The sensible young lady was so tender∣ly affected with her fond parent's regard, that she demonstrated her gratitude, by a sudden shower of tears; and grasping his hand, kissed it o'er and o'er, till she found words to thank him; assuring him, at the same time, that she was so far from being vain of her conquest, that it on∣ly excited her contempt; as she conceiv∣ed, that a virtuous mind was preferable to all the glittering grandeur of a throne.</P>
<P>The Count who was not a little pleas'd at this virtuous acknowledgement from his daughter, proceeded to an enquiry into her heart. You are now, my Child, said he, secured from a probability of any danger from the King, and to make that happiness more perfect, I desire you will candidly tell me if among the number of admirers, who have address'd themselves to you, there is any one in particular that
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
has made an impression on your mind? a rising blush diffus'd it self on her lovely face attended with a visible confusion, and artless innocence.</P>
<P>The Count who was ever cautious of giving her a moment's disquiet, beg'd her not to be uneasy at the question, for he started it to make her happy, not to give her the least disquiet; therefore my dear let me propose to you at once a valuable partner, one who I am certain loves you with a boundless passion, and who has long importun'd me as well as your self to make him happy; but as I believe both you and I have acted from one principle, I mean the fear of giving each other pain, we have protracted a joy which might possibly have been diffusive thro' the family. Mr. Archibald Dumont is the person I'm going to offer to you, but if your choice prefers any other, I shall wave the authority of the parent, and yield to your own inclination and discretion, as I am confident your good sense would not blindly suffer you to fix on any one whose merit did not sufficiently recommend him.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="21"/>On the mentioning Mr. Dumont, a se∣cond blush succeeded the former; which the count perceiving, to prevent any further check to her modesty, told her he appre∣hended he had touch'd the string that made most harmony in her soul; that she should have not only his consent, but ap∣probation; and that she could not oblige him in a more eminent degree than to espouse him with the utmost expedition, by which means she would not only be made infinitely happy in a worthy hus∣band, but put an end to all future pre∣tensions to her. Upon this declaration the lady was reliev'd from that restraint, which an intire resignation to her father's will had laid upon her; and after some lit∣tle pause, she acknowledg'd Mr. Dumont had the greatest interest with her of all the gentlemen who had paid their ad∣dresses; but that she struggled very hard to suppress a growing inclination, till she could be fully assur'd 'twas agreable to his lordship for her to entertain any thoughts of him that exceeded the bounds of friendship; but since the Count had gene∣rously given a sanction to her regard, she confess'd she was ready to receive Mr.
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
Dumont for a husband whenever he thought proper to command it.</P>
<P>This affair being agreeably concluded, they past on their journey very pleasingly, discoursing chiefly on the happiness they propos'd in the intended alliance.</P>
<P>After near two days travelling, they arriv'd at his lordship's seat, on which (as is customary on such occasions) the bells were set a ringing. Mr. Dumont, who lived within half a mile, enquired the cause; when being inform'd the Count and lady Charlotte were come down, he flew with impatient fondness to the idol of his wishes, and was soon made ac∣quainted with the reason of their un∣expected arrival. When he heard the design that was form'd against the virtue of his adored mistress, he felt the most ex∣quisite pain that indignation and revenge could possibly excite. And what aggra∣vated the torture he suffer'd on this ac∣count, was being divested of the power of sacrificing to his rage, the author of the intended villainy; he thought he could ne∣ver sufficiently applaud the prudent con∣duct of the peer in withdrawing his daugh∣ter from the sight of him who would have
<PB N="13" REF="23"/>
done her so irreparable an injury: and when Lady Charlotte had quitted the room, he took that opportunity to urge his suit, and what encouraged him to press it more strongly than before, he observed that Lady Charlotte received him with more freedom than usual, still preserving the ne∣cessary dignity of her sex. The Count who had a sincere respect for this young gen∣tleman, would not keep him in suspence, but soon declared all that was needful to convince him of his success; the transport∣ed lover was then as much distracted with joy, as he had been just before with immoderate rage.</P>
<P>After supper the Count related to his daughter, Mr. Dumont's request; and as there had been a twelve months courtship before, he thought, as all par∣ties were agreed, there needed no farther ceremony than to fix the day for their nuptials, which was celebrated with great pomp in about ten days after.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was possess'd of a fortune almost equal to the Count's; but the trifling deficiency was more than made up in his excellent character, that we may say of
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>
him;
<Q>“praise could not speak his ”worth.</Q></P>
<P>During their absence several enquiries were made after the Count's illness; and letters sent to the young lady, with pro∣mises of half the kingdom upon her grant∣ing his majesty's request.</P>
<P>Mr Evelyn pretended the Count's violent indisposition obliged the young lady to give close attendance; that she would see no company t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll her papa's recovery; but if the gentleman would please to intrust him with the letters, he would faithfully deliver them at a proper opportunity; which indeed he did to the Count, accord∣ing to order; whether by bribery of one of the servants or by what means is unknown, but the count's fictitious ill∣ness was discover'd, and his sudden journey reach'd the King's ear, who grew outragious, and sent an order for his immediate return. A courier was ac∣cordingly dispatch'd to his lordship, who signified his majesty's displeasure for ha∣ving giving out a false report of his being ill, only to estrange himself from court; and expected his appearance there with utmost expedition; the Count sent his
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>
duty, with a promise to set out next day, leaving behind him the happy pair, who waited with impatient concern for his return.</P>
<P>The news of Lady Charlotte's marriage drove the love sick monarch almost distracted, and many more of her ad∣mirers into astonishment and despair. The second day's journey the Count was met upon the road by Mr. Evelyn, to inform him of the revenge the king had meditated against him, and would fain have perswaded him to go back again; to which the intrepid Count replied, to what end? When the king can convince me, that he has a better title to do me an injury, than I have to prevent it, I will begin to fear him; but as I know him to be the offender, I have no reason to dread or to avoid him. I own, said Mr. Evelyn, your lordship's cause is just; and hope you will excuse in me a zealous regard, which gratitude and duty equally compel. The Count assur'd him, he received his caution as he meant it, but declar'd no earthly power should restrain him from seeing the King, which he did the very night he got to Versailles.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="26"/>When he entered the royal apartment, his majesty looking sternly at him de∣manded the cause of his ill treatment of him; to which the Count begged he would explain himself, for he declared that he was most truly firm in his allegiance, which nothing ever could shake or violate; and that he could not conceive in what point he had offended. Not offended! replied the king! when in contempt of all the offered honours which I courted you to receive, you basely and meanly urged a falsehood to avoid me; did that wear a face of loyalty? The greatest, replied the count, I possibly could show, in preventing your majesty from running into the most apparent evils, which the utmost joys they could have afforded, would never compensate for the inexpressible compunction you must have felt upon cool reflection: Consider, royal Sir, your office here is so nice a representation of heavenly power, that one bad action would fully a thousand virtues; and that you are not here as regulator only, but design'd an exem∣plary good to all mankind. I need not be more explicit on the theme which has
<PB N="17" REF="27" MS="y"/>
thrown me under your majesty's displea∣sure, but shall refer myself to your cooler judgment, whether I have not acted like a prudent father, and a true subject; which characters, I shall ever think it my duty to support to a religious strictness.</P>
<P>The King being sensible his friendly of∣fers to the Count were only the effects of an ill grounded passion, could urge no∣thing to enforce the justice of his cause; and that what the Count had said to him, was a necessary and tender reproach for the stain he would have thrown upon his own honour and dignity, by a cruel abuse of a lady of the most exalted vir∣tue. This reflection softned the fury of his temper, and reduced it to its native sweetness; then smiling on the Count, my Lord, said he, I must ac∣knowledge your nobleness of soul in regard to this affair gives you such a superiority over me, that I cannot think it lessens, but will rather be an addition to great∣ness to confess my error, and implore your pardon, and also that of the beau∣teous Lady Charlotte, whom I can never sufficiently make amends, for the wrong my unruly passion would have done her;
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>
but as an earnest of my contrition, and sincere desire of a lasting innocent friend∣ship, beg your lordship to prevail on her to wear this trifle for my sake; taking a ring from his finger of immense value, which he gave to the Count, assuring him at the same time he had he feared an invincible foe to combat with; adding, that he never knew the despotick power of love before. However, in respect to the lady as well as from a regard to his own quiet, he would use his utmost efforts to subdue, what at that time had absolutely conquered him.</P>
<P>The Count took leave of his Majesty, whom he never saw after; the reason of which the reader will soon be informed; the next day he set out for his country seat, where he had left the new married happy pair, who waited with impatience for his return to compleat their joy, and to be satisfied of the result of his expedi∣tion to court.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="29"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Count returns to his Country Seat. A Proof of the Uncertainty of earthly <HI>Happiness</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY next morning, the count set out to his seat; his impatience to return, occasioned his going post, where being arrived, he was received by the happy Dumont and his lady with ineffable transport, to whom he impart∣ed all that happened at court; present∣ing Lady Charlotte with his majesty's to∣ken of repentant friendship; which she had no sooner received, than she desired her spouse to wear it in her stead, it be∣ing so large a brilliant, she thought it a more proper ornament for a gentleman's, than a lady's finger. At the same time, requesting both the Count and Mr. Du∣mont never to insist upon her appearance at court, and signified her fondness for retirement; alledging, that the measure of her joys were full, in the possession of
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
the best of fathers, and worthest hus∣band; and 'twas impossible for her to receive any addition to her happiness.</P>
<P>This boon was directly granted, and orders sent to Versailles, for Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn to join this happy family; and to leave one of the Count's stewards with three or four trusty servants, to look after the estate.</P>
<P>Upon this summons they instantly removed, greatly pleas'd at Lady Char∣lotte's choice of a retired life.</P>
<P>In about two months time, she proved with child, which considerably aug∣mented the joy of her father, and the fond Dumont; whose conjugal love and tenderness was unprecedented, as were the valuable qualifications of the adored object of his wishes; 'tis nothing to say, they studied to make each other happy, nature having formed them with that unanimity, their thoughts and actions flowed from one constant spring of ever during love.</P>
<P>When they had been about a twelve-month married, they were blessed with the birth of a lovely boy, who is the subject of the following sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="31" MS="y"/>After the description of their happiness in each other, a detail of this additional transport, would be but an impertinent intrusion on the reader's time and pa∣tience. But alas! how uncertain are the joys of the most happy, while in a state of mortality?</P>
<P>This lady had not lain in above a fort∣night, before she was seized with the small-pox; which in a very few days, put a period to her life.</P>
<P>The new born babe receiv'd the infec∣tion; tho', in so favourable a manner, it soon recovered; but the unhappy fa∣ther, subdued by excessive grief, with a broken heart expired; and that so sud∣denly, they were in one day with great funeral pomp entombed together.</P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, I leave your own imagination to paint the perpetual gloom of sorrow, the surviving father must endure from such a loss; and which, but that of the tender offspring of this lamented pair, was spared to alleviate his woe, might have been the fatal cause of his decease. But providence had otherwise ordained it, for the sake
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>
of the little orphan, whom more than life he loved; and amply testified his affection in his paternal care.</P>
<P>As soon as the mournful obsequies were ended, the count resolved to quit the kingdom; not being able to bear the place where he had passed so many happy years of soft paternal dalliance, with his dear and only child; the loss of whom, and his worthy son in law, render'd him inconsoleable.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was dispatched to Ver∣sailles, with an address to his majesty, in order to obtain leave for the Count's departure from France; having design'd, with his royal permission, to pass the remaining part of his life in England.</P>
<P>The king bore no small share in his distress, and complimented the memory of the deceas'd lady, with an order for a court mourning; which continued for one month, she being by her mother's side, a distant relation to the blood-royal.</P>
<P>His majesty expressed a tender concern for his lordship's misfortune, and was sorry he had so melancholy an occasion to testifie his readiness to oblige him;
<PB N="23" REF="33" MS="y"/>
and since his grief was unsurmountable, rather than run the hazard of shortening his days, by staying in France, he freely gave him leave to embark for England, in hopes that time and absence might dis∣sipate his anguish, and prolong his life.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was dismissed with leave from the King, under his own hand; which with the utmost expedition he brought to the Count.</P>
<P>It happened Mrs. Evelyn was deliver∣ed of a daughter, about a week after Lady Charlotte Dumont was brought to bed of her son; which retarded their voyage to England, till she was capable of being moved; in which time the Count settled his affairs, and being ap∣prehensive he should not long survive his darling child; was careful in provi∣ding for Miss Evelyn, whose father's merit claimed the strongest regard; for which reason, he presented the in∣fant with five thousand pounds on their arrival; which when she came to age, was doubled by a growing interest.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Count arrives in <HI>England;</HI> settles near <HI>London</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>MRS Evelyn's month being up, and the count's affairs finished, he embarked for England; taking with him only Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn, the new born infants, and their nurses; with Latour his gentleman, who attend∣ed him when he was at school, in the quality of a footman; but from his good behaviour, was preferred, when his lordship came to age, to the foremen∣tioned post.</P>
<P>By a favourable gale, they were safely and suddenly conducted to Dover; from thence they were escorted to London. Mr. Evelyn directly hired a ready furnished house for the family in Pall-Mall, till by the count's order he had found out an agreeable retreat in the country, which he soon effected; and pur∣chas'd an estate at a place called Iver,
<PB N="25" REF="35" MS="y"/>
within three miles of Uxbridge, about twenty one from London.</P>
<P>In a short time the Count settled there with a determination to become an ab∣solute recluse; and as his grandson grew up, who was his only care and comfort, made his wellfare the business of his life; which that he might effectually ac∣complish, he delivered him up to Mr. Evelyn as soon as he became of an age sufficient to receive instructions.</P>
<P>Miss Evelyn was no less regarded by this noble lord, who allowed a salary to her parents to educate her, as his adopted daughter, by which means she was qualified for a court, with the ne∣cessary accomplishments that afterwards enabled her to govern a family; the plea∣sure the Count received from the daily and visible improvement made in these tender blossoms, considerably alleviated his grief, and gave him early hopes of their soon becoming the full blown flowers of perfection.</P>
<P>The young gentleman often solicited his Grand papa, to consent to his taking a tour thro' France and Italy, but the Count would by no means listen to that
<PB N="26" REF="36"/>
proposal; declaring that he would have him thoroughly acquainted with the coun∣try he was bred in, before he went abroad; that when he had compleated his studies Mr. Evelyn should accompany him to all the remarkable places in England, that he might be able to give an account of them; for though, said the Count, you are not a native here, you'll have as much expected from you in regard to the knowledge of this kingdom as if you were; having, six weeks excepted, passed your life in it.</P>
<P>I have experienced the disadvantages young gentlemen have labour'd under, by being sent abroad before they had re∣ceived the necessary qualifications for their travels; which not only rendred themselves ridiculous, but throws an odium upon a glorious country, which is capable of producing as great genius's as any in Europe, were they suffer'd to take a proper time for cultivation, before they launch into the world; the want of which regard, is the reason why so many of the English youth set out pert blockheads, and return accomplish'd asses; which unhappy management has
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
laid the foundation of ruin for many a fine woman, and fair estate, by falling into the hands of these unfinish'd, mo∣dern fine gentlemen; and that you, my dear Harry, may not swell the number of their account, I tenderly admonish you to lay aside all thoughts of visiting any foreign country, till your friends shall judge it proper; and you are able to convince the people abroad, that your expedition was rather occasion'd by cu∣riosity, than a want of improvement.</P>
<P>The good youth, whose highest hap∣piness consisted in obeying his worthy grandsire, from that time, without re∣luctance, gave up all thoughts of travel∣ling; and that his complacency of temper might meet both with reward and en∣couragement, the Count gave him free liberty to enjoy all the innocent and po∣lite pleasures of life; and though his lordship seldom went abroad himself, he permitted both the children to go to court, assemblies, balls, operas, and plays, as they lived so near London, but con∣stantly attended by Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn; young Dumont and Miss were great Lo∣vers of dramatick performances, and pre∣vail'd
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
upon his Lordship to let them have a compleat theatre built at the end of a green walk; where several young La∣dies and Gentlemen formed a company of comedians, and exhibited many of Shakespear's and Moliere's plays; nor was Terence excluded; whose Comedies were generally acted by the male part of their society, except sometimes Miss Eve∣lyn, who was perfect mistress of the Latin tongue, took an occasional part to fill up their number: between the acts she fre∣quently entertain'd the nobility and gen∣try (who form'd their audience) with a song or a lesson on the harpsichord, in which she equal'd the most skillful pro∣ficients of the age; their choice of this kind of amusement pleas'd the Count extremely, as it was both innocent and instructive, allowing the stage to be a kind of seminary in itself, and capable of refining the understandings, both of the performer and spectators, and in some degree cultivate a natural genius, which might unfortunately want the blessing and assistance of a regular education.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Dumont</HI> gives early Proof of Huma∣nity by an unexpected Adventure. <HI>Irish</HI> Hospitality justly observed and esteem'd.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dumont having attain'd to the age of fifteen, gave daily and di∣stinguishing proofs of his growing vir∣tues; the precepts and examples of his tender parent, and careful governor, having formed his mind, and raised it to such a glorious height of perfection, he was deservedly accounted and esteem'd the mirror of the age; among the num∣ber of his excellent qualities, that of hu∣manity was not the least, which this chapter will discover: he had the bravery of the English, the politeness of the French, but in the foremention'd virtue he was considerably indebted to the Irish, who are remarkably beneficent to all whose misfortunes have any claim to their pity or redress; the friendless stranger on the first application is discharged from the burden of his affliction, by the gene∣rous
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>
natives of that kingdom, the freedom and chearful ease with which they admi∣nister comfort to the wretched, redoubles the merit of their bounty. I beg pardon for this digression, which I hope will be excused, since it is occasion'd by an ear∣nest desire of doing justice to a set of worthy persons, whose generous souls are ever strongly affected with the miseries of their fellow creatures, and think them∣selves bless'd while they exert their power to asswage, or totally dissipate their sor∣rows. I could wish this laudable exam∣ple, so truly great, was more general in this kingdom, I mean an extension of it among the middling sort of people, tho' in Ireland, even POVERTY lays no re∣straint upon the mind of the most in∣digent, who, far as their small pittance will allow, the distressed are welcome to a friendly part. I hope the people of England won't conceive while I am gi∣ving due praise to the Irish, that I would throw a general odium upon my own country; No! far be it from me to be guilty of such a calumny, I only speak from the experience I have from many strangers who have acknowledged the
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>
boundless favours they received from the Hibernians of high and low degree; nor have I been exempt from their bounty, as I have fully demonstrated in the sub∣ject of my narrative. I think a national gratitude incumbent on all who have the least regard to humanity; and were the lower people here, more kind to strangers, or their near acquaintance in distress, I am apt to believe two very great evils would be by that means avoided, the first of which is an inhuman deprivation of that power to do good, which the great Ruler of the world has for our own ad∣vantage bestow'd upon us; the next is thro' pinching want and dire necessity, reducing by our cruel parsimony a hap∣less wretch to barter his honesty to sup∣port a miserable life, which too often brings it to a shameful period. As this reflection is not pointed at particulars, I hope I shan't incur any displeasure, and that whoever may stand in need of this hint, will make a proper use of it for their own sakes, as well as for the benefit of the NECESSITOUS part of the creation.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to give a strong instance of this noble virtue in young Du∣mont.
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>
The young gentleman and his governor on their return from hunting one morning, being caught in a sudden and violent shower of rain, rode up to a little hovel, built for the reception of cattle, upon Windsor-forest; they dis∣mounted and enter'd this friendly shelter, where to their mutual amazement, they found a beautiful boy about fourteen years of age, plainly, but genteely dress'd, wringing his little hands, and in all ap∣pearance ready to expire thro' excess of grief; they immediately enquired into the cause of his lamentation, but the un∣happy youth was entirely dispossess'd of the power to answer their demands, a flood of tears and bitterest sobs broke in upon his speech, which for some time he vainly attempted to recover; the gentle∣men being anxious to know the meaning of this immoderate sorrow, patiently wai∣ted till the child was capable of informing them of the cause; which he began by telling them, that he was, without excep∣tion, the most wretched of the whole creation. I last week, said he, buried a tender and indulgent mother, she was a widow, left by my father but in indifferent
<PB N="33" REF="43"/>
circumstances, he was a gentleman of a moderate fortune, who from an excess of good nature impair'd his income, by being frequently bound for others debts, which reduced him to the necessity of mortgaging the little estate we lived in to a younger brother of his, who had a legacy left him by a distant relation at the very time my father was drove to this misfortune: in short my uncle who is the very reverse of the description I have given you of my father, lent him three hundred pounds upon the house and ground, with a sordid view of becoming absolutely master of it, from the hopes of my father's never being able to redeem it, tho' the estate is valued at a thousand pounds; in short my father died soon after this affair happen'd, leaving my mo∣ther in a distracted condition to contrive a means to support herself and me, who was then but two years of age; however providence put it in her power to get not only a livelihood by keeping a little shop and a day school for young ladies to learn particular fine works, but she was also enabled to give me an education beyond what might have been expected from
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>
the melancholy situation she was left in. Mr. Evelyn interrupted him with en∣quiring what sort of education his mother had bestowed on him; to which the youth replied, what I believe, Sir, you will allow to be a good one, and as much as is ne∣cessary for one in my station of life, ha∣ving been in the Greek form for near a twelve-month before my mother died; here the hapless child, again o'ercome by fresh streams of grief, and deep fetch'd sighs paus'd a while. When his tears gave way proceeded in his story, with many tender expressions of gratitude, for the great care his deceased mother had taken in the bringing of him up, and that he thought himself under treble obligations to her, as he was very sensible she denied herself many necessaries of life to bestow the larger share of her small pittance upon him. Now, gentlemen, I must inform you that this uncle of mine is a man of neither principle nor humanity, as you will find by the sequel of my story, which constrain'd my dear mother to part from many things of value, to pay the interest of this mortgage; which she did, till sickness, in which she lingered for near
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>
fifteen months, disempowered her to con∣tinue the payment; as soon as it pleased heaven to deprive me of her, this cruel uncle came and took possession of all I was worth in the world, and before my face, borrowed a sum of money on the estate, of a person he brought with him for that purpose; when I ask'd the reason of this barbarous proceeding, and beg'd him to forgoe the wrong he was doing me, he was regardless of my sup∣plication, and with brutal rage, cruelly insulted my distress; then with his horse∣whip severely drove me out of doors to beg or starve, threatning me with death if ever I presumed to come near the house again. How, said Dumont, had you no friend to take your part in this extre∣mity? None, Sir, replied the Lad, but my school-master, who endeavouring to defend me from the dreadful lashes of his whip, received a fatal blow, which instantly struck out his eye, and I fear the other is much endanger'd. I have secreted myself in this melancholly retreat these six and thirty hours, nor have I seen the face of a living soul till now, and whither to go, or what course to take,
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>
I know not. Then the dread of meeting my uncle, sometimes makes me resolve not to quit it, but patiently resign myself to grief and want, till the friendly hand of death shall end my wretched life.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was so affected with the youth's distress, and sensible deportment, that he determin'd to be his friend, bidding him take comfort, and would have per∣swaded him to have gone back with them to this inhuman wretch; which offer the boy would on no terms accept, but with a thankful modesty declined it; adding, that if they were doubtful of the truth of what he had asserted, if they pleased to have farther conviction of it, he would direct them where to go, and hear the melancholly tale retold by Mr. Williams, the unfortunate man who lost his eye in his defence. This was readily agreed to by Mr. Dumont and his governor, and taking directions from him they set out, leaving one of his servants behind to get something at the next village to recruit the spirits of the oppress'd infant, and accom∣pany him till their return; they rode with full speed, with an absolute deter∣mination to bring the uncle to justice for
<PB N="37" REF="47" MS="y"/>
his inhuman treatment of an innocent boy; but when they came they found the house shut up, and upon enquiry were told, the villain had sold off all the goods the day before, and went off the moment the sale was over; they proceeded then to the school-master, whom they found in great agony from the loss of his eye, which was considerably augmented by the grief he sustain'd for the hard usage and loss of the poor boy, whose character was related to Dumont in a most affectionate and tender manner, and bespoke that care and fond regard he afterwards met with in the Count's family; which was no small joy to the good tutor to hear his little pupil had fallen into such honoura∣ble hands. Mr. Dumont took leave of the good man, and left him ten guineas that he might not want proper assistance in this unhappy exigence; the eager de∣sire this noble youth had to relieve the afflicted, redoubled his haste; when he return'd to the child, whom he smiling bid to be of comfort, ordering one of the servants to take him before him on horse-back, and conduct him safely to the Count's. When they got home young
<PB N="38" REF="48" MS="y"/>
Dumont left the child with Mr. Evelyn below stairs, while he went to his grand papa's apartment and gave him the history of the poor abandon'd orphan; not for∣getting the fair character the master gave him, with which the good Count was no less delighted than his grandson, and was pleased to find this early proof of his hu∣manity to a worthy object of compassion. Young Dumont soon found that intrea∣ties on the lad's behalf were needless, from the profound attention he gave to the re∣cital of his story, and the tender effect it had upon his generous mind, which dis∣covered itself by his involuntary sighs; the child was sent for up, whose melan∣cholly and sensible aspect, mixed with a sweetness of behaviour, directly influenced the Count in his favour, who from that instant protected and bred him as his adopted son; his education in which he had made a great progress when under Mr. Williams's tuition, was compleated by the superior judgment of Mr Evelyn, who was allow'd to be without exception one of the most learned gentlemen the age produced.</P>
<P>Young Jennings (that was the boy's
<PB N="39" REF="49" MS="y"/>
name) from a natural propensity to vir∣tue, took care from every action of his life, to bid defiance to the most envious and malicious tongue of slander, and it would be difficult to determine whether his patron's benefactions, or the grateful sense of them in the much obliged youth exceeded most. Five years past on, in which time an uninterrupted course of friendship was worthily and solemnly con∣tracted between these young gentlemen; one day as they were walking in the garden, Jennings appear'd somewhat un∣easy, which Dumont discovering insisted upon being acquainted with the cause; which the other for some time declined to satisfy him of, till Dumont urged him by the strict bonds of friendship, what∣ever was his uneasiness, to impart it to his friend. Jennings could no longer resist his solicitation, when enforced by so strong an argument, and fetching a deep sigh, beg'd him not to be offended at a resolution he had taken to go abroad; this unexpected turn of mind was at first received by Dumont as a mark of disre∣gard and ingratitude, till the other convin∣ced him to the contrary in the manner fol∣lowing.
<PB N="40" REF="50"/>
My honour'd and much valued friend, said he, when I think of seperating from you, it is equally terrible as what I must have conceived of an unexpected and untimely stroke of death; but I have one reason in particular, which strength∣ens my resolution of undergoing the dreadful pangs of parting with you; and in my turn must beg you by the same ties of friendship, not to enquire into it, or wish to know it till you have it under my own hand in my first letter after my departure; which he faithfully promising should be the case, his generous friend would not persist in endeavouring to find it out, though his curiosity was raised to the highest pitch; one motive he own'd for going, was a violent desire to con∣vince his worthy friends that their kind indulgence had not buried in him the thoughts of industry, but rather prompt∣ed him to exert himself in that respect, that they might see their tender care was not lost or thrown away upon him; and that he thought it his duty, and the only grateful instance he could give of his sense of all their favours to become no longer burthensome, since they had so
<PB N="41" REF="51" MS="y"/>
largely contributed to qualify him for any employment in life.</P>
<P>Dumont would fain have persuaded him to stay, affirming to him that fortune should never be wanting to continue him with them: that, Sir, I am well assured on, replied young Jennings, and I am not to learn that your affluence is suffici∣ent to make many more such objects of compassion truly happy; but notwithstand∣ing that, I cannot reconcile it to myself to remain an unnecessary burden to such valu∣able friends, when I may employ my time in some industrious calling that may do honour to my noble benefactors, who em∣powered me to make the laudable pursuit; and to convince you farther, Sir, that I must think my proposition just, the Count consented to it, and gave Mr. Eve∣lyn orders to agree with Mr. Bryan the West-India merchant that visits here, to take me as his clerk, and to furnish me with every thing proper for my voyage, if I could prevail on you to approve of my design. Mr. Dumont told him that was the last thing in the world he should have wish'd or expected; but as he found him so intent upon the affair, he would
<PB N="42" REF="52"/>
not be the means of preventing him, though he assured him it was with the strongest reluctance he gave into it; and reminded him of his promise to disclose in his first letter the principal reason for going, which he till then kept secret. The affair being concluded, the young gentleman was equip'd with every thing not only necessary, but perfectly genteel, and the generous Count gave into the hands of Mr. Bryan, who was a man of undoubted worth, the sum of five hun∣dred pounds, to be disposed of in mer∣chandizing, as a little fortune for him when he had served his clerkship.</P>
<P>The time appointed for his departure being come, he and the whole family wore one contracted brow of real sorrow; the Count was too much concern'd at part∣ing from him to bear the shock of seeing him take shipping, but young Dumont resolved to do a violence to his tender disposition, and accompanied with Mr. Evelyn, waited on him to Gravesend, where a melancholly scene of separation ensued, which is needless to describe to a sensible mind and humane heart.</P>

<P>MR. Bryan and his young clerk, arrived safely in the Indies, after as expeditious a voyage as they could possibly expect; but poor Jennings, from the time of his leaving England, under∣went a settled melancholly, which, not∣withstanding his kind master's endeavours to divert, it was impossible to remove or even to asswage; nor will the reader be surprized at the cause, though he must applaud his generous motive of conceal∣ment, which the following letter to his dear friend soon revealed.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Henry Dumont, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it possible for me more than in words to express the satis∣faction and ineffable joy I possess in the honour of your unbounded friendship,
<PB N="44" REF="54"/>
I should be proud to do it, even at Life's expence, and esteem it but as a trifling return, for the innumerable instances of your unprecedented ten∣derness; the repeated obligations con∣ferred on me by your noble grand∣fire, and worthy self, are the pleasing contemplations of my mind. Nor can I ever sufficiently acknowledge the friendly care of my ever Honoured Master Mr. Evelyn, whose constant assiduity in my education, shall meet with a lasting gratitude from his affectionate pupil.</P>
<P>I shall now, dear sir, keep my word in giving you the reason of my first re∣solution to travel, but must conjure you sir, to forgive my encouraging a fond delusive passion, which was aimed at a lovely object, far above my hopes — in a word, the beautiful and incom∣parable Miss Evelyn, — now the se∣cret is divulg'd — I tremble, left my noble friend might have design'd him∣self to be the happy partner of her heart; the dread of which obliged me to smother up a flame, that had like to have given a period to my life. Then
<PB N="45" REF="55"/>
as I was conscious, none could be so worthy of her as yourself; and that my hapless fate, had cast me far beneath her, I thought myself doubly bound in respect to the Lady, and gratitude to a much valued friend, to try to suppress my growing love, which I find even absence can't effect; but re∣solved on that as the most likely remedy to mitigate the sufferings of a despairing, and I fear a broken heart.</P>
<P>Dear sir, let this unhappy stroke of fate, be buried in your bosom; and be assured, nothing but the fears of being thought guilty of black ingratitude, and dis-regard of the best of friends, should have drawn the secret from</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Honoured SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your most obliged and devoted Servant</HI>, ALEXANDER JENNINGS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The grateful motive for his stifling his passion, and the noble resolution of ma∣king
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>
himself a sacrifice, rather than wrong his friend, wrought such an effect upon Dumont, that notwithstanding the in∣junction laid on him not to disclose the secret, he directly shew'd the letter to the Count and Mr. Evelyn; in hopes the faithful youth might by that means ob∣tain the dear reward for all his pain and generous concealment.</P>
<P>On the perusal of Jennings's epistle to Dumont, the Count and Mr. Evelyn expressed the tenderest concern, but were unable to decide in his favour, as his happiness or misery was entirely de∣pendant on Miss Evelyn's determination; in short, the whole family interested themselves so far in his behalf, that they urged daily the merit of her lover; nor could she make the least objection to his person, which was entirely agreeable; and considerably heightened by a noble∣ness of mind, rarely to be found.</P>
<P>And that want of fortune, might be no obstruction to the crowning his wishes, the Count offered Miss Evelyn to double the fortune he gave her, when an infant, to make him worthy her ac∣ceptance. But alass! poor Jennings,
<PB N="47" REF="57" MS="y"/>
notwithstanding so many powerful ad∣vocates, was cast in his suit. For Miss Evelyn positively declined all thoughts of marriage; and as her own heart was not equally engag'd, she entreated both the Count and her papa not to insist with her compliance to their request; ac∣knowledging herself extreamly honoured, and obliged for the trouble they had given themselves on the account; al∣lowing at the same time, that Mr. Jennings was a youth of many promising virtues; that she should ever retain a grateful friendship for him, and was truly concerned at her being the un∣happy, tho' innocent cause of his dis∣tress.</P>
<P>Upon this declaration, the subject was dropped, for both the Count and Mr. Evelyn, thought it would be but a ridiculous cruelty to insist upon obe∣dience in an affair, where her own hap∣piness was so principally concerned. And as she was in every other point perfectly resigned to their wills, gratitude and af∣fection equally compelled them, not to lay any violent restraint on hers.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="58" MS="y"/>Young Jenning's passion for Miss Evelyn, had so noble an effect on his mind, that it enlarged and brightened those qualifications art and nature had endowed him with; in every action of his life, he demonstrated how much he studied to deserve her; in short, he was the universal admiration of the island in which he lived, and be∣haved so much beyond his master's ex∣pectation, that he conversed with him as a friend, even in his voyage, and when his time was out, paying him the five hundred pounds given by the Count, he added as much more, with an offer to make him partner with him in mer∣chandize; which Jennings declined, as as he was not possessed of a fortune sufficient to undertake an affair of so much consequence.</P>
<P>But providence soon made him a∣mends for his generous refusal, by the death of his master, who was seized with a malignant fever in about six months after he had made Jennings this offer; and having no relations, left him his sole heir, and master of five and twenty thousand pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="59" MS="y"/>This augmentation of fortune encou∣raged the amorous youth immediately to send a letter to young Dumont, with a proposal of marriage to Miss Evelyn; and to disclose, as he thought, his long stifled fondness; as business would not permit him to go over directly, he en∣treated Dumont if he had no intention of an alliance there, that he would urge his passion to the utmost of his power; that the fears of being thought only an interested lover, and the danger of of∣fending his dearest friends, had almost wrought his dissolution. But as he had it now in his power to convince Miss Evelyn of the contrary of the former, and had been ascertained by Dumont's letters, that he run no hazard of the lat∣ter; he entertained from his friend's intercession some hopes of success. But he was soon assur'd of the uncertain∣ty of human happiness, let the prospect be e'er so fair and probable, for Miss Evelyn, so far from inclining to his wishes, continued quite inexorable; nor could his Fortune prevail; which made the family suspect there was a secret reason for so absolute a refusal; and as
<PB N="50" REF="60"/>
they could not discover it by her behavi∣our, they were resolved not to make the least inquiry, till time should give it birth.</P>
<P>Young Jennings did not fail to reward his old tutor, and worthy friend Mr. Williams, to whom he sent a bill for a hundred pounds, drawn upon a mer∣chant in the city of London, with an offer to come over to the Indies, or accept of a yearly remittance for life; but the fond old man was so transported at the thoughts of seeing him, he rather chose to go over to him (not knowing that Miss Evelyn might, in all probability, have brought him soon to England; and the Letter young Dumont sent prevented his co∣ming as he intended) the good man ar∣rived in the Indies, to the real joy of his worthy friend, who by his grateful re∣membrance of him relieved him from a laborious pursuit of support, for at best but an uneasy life, and by his tender care render'd him happy during the re∣maining part. That the old gentleman thought himself more than amply re∣warded for all his sufferings past, and after a few years of uninterrupted tran∣quility,
<PB N="51" REF="61"/>
ended his life, with a grateful sense of his Creator's goodness, who not only bless'd his latter days, but gave him the inexpressible delight to see his child (as he always called him) raised to such a wondrous height of happiness, and pos∣sess'd of such virtues as might enable him to retain and to deserve it.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Jennings remained for some time very melancholly for the loss of his dear master, which he called him to the hour of his death; and his distress was, in a great measure, aggravated in the want of a friend, to whom he could un∣bosom his mind. His love to Miss Evelyn having made so deep an impres∣sion on his heart, that life became a burden to him, nor could even riches make the least amends for the smallest of his sufferings.</P>
<P>One day a gentleman, in the course of conversation, ask'd him why he would not marry, and told him he was very sensible that he had met with the greatest offers of any person in the whole island; upon which Mr. Jennings proceeded to give the reason why he had declined the acceptation of every proposal of marriage
<PB N="52" REF="62" MS="y"/>
that had been made to him. When after a profound attention given by the gen∣tleman to what Jennings had recited, my dear friend, said he, I know a beau∣tiful virgin in this island who suffers as much for you as you endure from the lady's refusal in England. She is a person of no great fortune, but her worth, as a girl of sense, and exemplary virtue, puts her upon an equality with the best estate in Europe; and since you are certain you cannot be happy with her you love, e'en make Her happy whom you may be as∣sured wishes to make you so.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings could not so suddenly acquiesce with his friend's request, but desired a little consideration on the affair, and to be acquinted with the young lady which his friend entreated might be soon, otherwise it was possible a few days might end her life and misery to∣gether.</P>
<P>Young Jennings knew too well the power of love not to bear a part in the lady's affliction, and appointed a day for an interview with the enamour'd fair one; resolving, if she were but tolerably agree∣able, to marry her, as being the most
<PB N="53" REF="63" MS="y"/>
likely means to overcome his violent passion for the other. According to ap∣pointment, he went to pay his respects to his friend, where he saw the lady, whose beauty was rather heightned than impair'd in his opinion, by a melancholly sweetness in her countenance; and the surprize and joy of seeing Him she se∣cretly loved, revived the faded roses in her cheeks. The gentleman of the house (who was a distant relation, and guardian to this lady and a younger sister) had drop'd a distant hint of Jennings's in∣tended visit, but not a syllable of the de∣sign of it, least it should fail, and render the poor creature more wretched than before. However, her transport at the sight of him was too strong to permit her to stay in the room, from which she was scarce retired to another, but she fainted in her cousin's arms; who per∣ceiving her uneasiness, had follow'd her out, when, after bringing her to herself, he return'd alone to Mr. Jennings, and told him by what means they became acquainted with her passion for him; you must know, said he, she has a pretty turn to poetry, and being inspired by
<PB N="54" REF="64"/>
love, wrote a copy of verses upon your worship, which she accidentally drop∣ping, her little sister found and gave to me. I confess I could not blame her, as she had so luckily bestowed her heart on one, whom no woman need blush at ad∣miring; but the uncertainty of being successful in her love, made me endea∣vour, by gentle means, to disswade her from the pursuit of a hopeless passion. But alass, in vain were my admonitions! I soon found her fondness had taken such root, that it prey'd upon her mind, and I fear will end in her dissolution. Not if I can prevent it, replied Mr. Jennings; perhaps fate has steel'd Miss Evelyn's heart against me, as a means to make another happy who has a better claim to my regard than that cruel beauty; and since your kinswoman has honour'd me with so tender an affection, gratitude compels me to endeavour to transfer my unbounded stock of love for Miss Evelyn to her, who will meet it with a propor∣tionable share on her side.</P>
<P>This resolution gave the gentleman great satisfaction, as he knew they were worthy of each other, and that it would
<PB N="55" REF="65" MS="y"/>
happily put an end to a very troublesome and dangerous fit of love that might have cost both their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings was so cautious of giving her the least suspicion of his knowing what interest he had in her heart, that he address'd her with all the seeming dread of a denial; nor was his mind tainted with that vanity and presuming power the young fellows of this age are too naturally prone to on such occasions; so far from it, tho' he was sure of his con∣quest, he never by word or look disco∣ver'd, till the marriage was fix'd on, that he was conscious of the secret joy she received by the alliance.</P>
<P>In about six weeks time they were publickly married; and Mr. Jennings, on his wedding day, settled her fortune, which was a thousand pounds, on her younger sister, and a jointure of eight hundred a year on his bride: time, and Mrs. Jennings's prudent behaviour, re∣moved all thoughts of Miss Evelyn from her husband's mind, and they lived the most perfect examples of conjugal af∣fection that ever enter'd into the holy bands of wedlock.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="66"/>The news of this match was sent to young Dumont as soon as possible, and was received with a general joy in the family, hoping that the design of it might have the desired effect, in preventing the loss of their much valued friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Miss <HI>Evelyn</HI> goes to <HI>Tunbridge</HI>. An odd Adventure happens there.</HEAD>
<P>YOung Dumont had by this time finished his studies, which, with all other necessary accomplishments, com∣pleated him a perfect fine gentleman; but not that sort of fine gentlemen which Mr. Woodward so inimitably represents in Mr. Garrick's celebrated dramatick per∣formance call'd Lethe, or Aesop in the shades; for which the town are much obliged to the author, and the player, for having largely contributed to their entertainment so many successive years, and which has rather encreas'd, than
<PB N="57" REF="67"/>
pall'd the appetite, notwithstanding they have been so often fed with it.</P>
<P>But to return to Dumont, his grand∣papa began to consider him now in a different light; as he, tho' not past his minority, discovered the Man in every thought and action: and that he might be better able to judge of his dispo∣sition, entirely took off that restraint which lay upon him, during the time of his education. The first step he took towards making him master of him∣self, was allowing him a thousand pounds a year; and by the management of that, he could the easier discern what might be expected from him, when possess'd of many thousands more.</P>
<P>Nor were his hopes and expectations un∣answer'd; for tho' he suddenly launched into all the pleasures of life without controulment, he used them but as inno∣cent amusements, without becoming their SLAVE; and in every circumstance kept up that noble character, which the example of his grandfire had set before him.</P>
<P>The first grand publick appearance he made was at Tunbridge, accompanied
<PB N="58" REF="68" MS="y"/>
by Mrs. Evelyn and her daughter; Mr. Evelyn was obliged to stay with the Count, who, confined partly by the gout, and an invincible sorrow for his daugh∣ter's loss, never stirred above four or five miles for the Air sometimes.</P>
<P>The magnificent appearance they made, attracted every eye, and excited the curiosity of all the company there; they being strangers to all but Lord Worthland, and Sir John Generous, who joined their party. The fortune-hunters of both sexes, were at their wits-ends to engage with young Du∣mont and Miss Evelyn, tho' it proved to very little purpose. But among the rest that made pretensions, was a strange mortal, who seeing Dumont dance at the ball one night with Miss Evelyn, sent the following fond epistle, directed.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The extraordinary stile and spelling diverted him exceedingly; but being in∣tirely innocent of such unnatural pro∣ceedings, concluded there must be a
<PB N="60" REF="70"/>
mistake in the direction, and that the letter must be designed for Miss Evelyn, to whom he directly carried it; apologi∣zing for his having opened it; which er∣ror, he told her, she must attribute to the person, who had certainly made a mistake in the superscription, was the reason of its being delivered to him.</P>
<P>Miss Evelyn read the amorous epis∣tle, laughing inwardly to a violent de∣gree during the perusal; then returning the paper, Mr. Dumont, said she, I don't suppose the person who wrote it, would cast his eyes upon an odious Female; and I am positive the letter was meant as directed.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, replied Dumont, 'tis impossible; 'tis true I have heard there are a set of unnatural wretches, who are shamefully addicted to a vice, not proper to be mentioned to so deli∣cate an ear as yours; but my behaviour could not in any degree give the smal∣lest hope to the unnatural passion of such a detestable brute. I therefore think it highly incumbent on me, to make an example of the villain.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71"/>Miss Evelyn would fain have dis∣suaded him from his purpose, but in vain; for young Dumont was apprehen∣sive, that the bare mention of his name from the mouth of such a wretch, might throw an imputation on his character, which he had rather suffer death than deserve.</P>
<P>Mrs Evelyn was of the young gentle∣man's mind, and urged him to put his revenge in immediate execution; advi∣sing him. to consult with Lord Worth∣land and Sir John Generous, and entreat them to be witnesses; as an affair of that nature must be necessary to pre∣vent any calumny the monster might possibly raise on account of the deserved treatment and disappointment he should meet from Mr. Dumont. And in order to perpetrate the design, advised him to send only a verbal answer, to let the crea∣ture know he would attend his sum∣mons; and in the mean time, send or go to Sir John Generous, and com∣municate the affair to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont's valet brought his ma∣ster word, that the servant who came with the letter, desired an immediate
<PB N="62" REF="72"/>
answer. The valet having a kind of restrained laugh on his face, his master asked him the occasion? I beg your ho∣nour's pardon, says he, but the sight of the person who waits the answer, put me into such a fit of laughing, I had scarce power to compose myself suffici∣ently, to bring the message to you Sir. I really take it to be a young wench in boy's cloaths, by the softness of the voice, and the effeminacy of his behaviour. For heaven's sake, says Miss Evelyn, let the creature come up, 'twill divert us.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont's servant went down, and brought up the moppit; whose hair was curl'd in the form of a fine lady's, and scented the room with per∣fumes, it set their heads aching from the violent strength of it; his dress was a fine milk-white sustian-frock, with green sattin cape and facings, a white cambrick handkerchief carelessly tied round his neck, and a pair of white gloves; one of which he pulled off, and discovered a beautiful white hand, with a handsome diamond ring on the little finger.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="73"/>Upon Mr. Dumont's enquiry into what post he held under Mr. Loveman, he answered, Dear sir, I'm a young decay'd geman, but think myself happy now since the loss of my for∣tin, to be vale de chamber to my deer master squire Loveman; and a deer in∣dulgint soul he is, for if my fingur do but ake, he's like a crazy cretor; t'other day one of the footmen trod up∣pon my toe, and bru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s'd me in a most bar∣brus manner, I believe indeed the willing owed me a spight, and my master turn'd him of at a minits varning, and sent for two of the most aminent surgins in townd, to insult about the cure. And indeed a great cure it vas, for every body thought I should have lost my toe-nail, it looked so black under it— then lifting up his eyes, thanked pro∣vidence, and the care of the surgins the nail was preserved, and he was per∣fectly recovered of the unhippy icci∣dent.</P>
<P>That's a happiness indeed, said Miss Evelyn, who knows the consequence of your losing your toe-nail! you might not for ought I know, have been able
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>
to have run of an errand these six months. Very true, dear lady, answered Mr. Turtle, (for that was the soft creature's name) but if that had been the case, 'twould have been in all the news∣papers. But vorthy Sir, I believe by this time, my master expects me to dress him, please to give me your ho∣nour's orders. My compliments, says Mr. Dumont, and I shall wait on on him at the time and place ap∣pointed.</P>
<P>The pretty creature had not been gone above a quarter of an hour, be∣fore Lord Worthland and Sir John Generous came to pay a visit; who were immediately informed of the af∣fair, and resolved to join with Mr. Dumont in his revenge on the un∣natural scoundrel, for daring to make such an attempt upon a very honourable and worthy young gen∣tleman.</P>
<P>About the hour of five after dinner, they went to the fish-ponds, which was the place proposed. Lord Worth∣land and Sir John went in a little be∣fore, and called for a bottle of cham∣paign
<PB N="65" REF="75"/>
by themselves in a different room.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont came in a few minutes after, and was conducted by Mr. Love∣man's footman, up one pair of stairs, to the enamoured swain, who had been waiting impatiently for his arrival above an hour.</P>
<P>When he came in he saw an ele∣gant cold collation set forth, the win∣dow curtains close drawn and pinn'd; but found no body in the room; when asking for the gentleman, the servant sneered, and told him, his Lady would wait upon him directly; when immediately there appeared from the inner-chamber, this odious creature in a female rich dishabille; who running to Mr. Dumont, cried out,
<Q>“I come, I fly, to my adored Castalio's arms! my ”wishes lord!</Q>
— stopping here, with a languishing air, said, Do my angel, call me your Monimia! then with a beastly transport, kissed him with that ardour, which might be expected from a drunk∣en fellow to a common prostitute. Mr. Dumont being now fully convinced of his horrid design, without farther
<PB N="66" REF="76"/>
ceremony knocked him down, and dis∣ciplined him with his cane; till the monster was almost immoveable.</P>
<P>The noise of his falling brought up Lord Worthland, Sir John, and the landlord, who were surprized to see Mr. Loveman's odd transformation; but he recollected his footman carried up a large bundle, little conceiving what it contained, or to what end it was brought.</P>
<P>Lord Worthland and Sir John would have bestowed their favours on him; but Mr. Dumont desired they would not rob him of the least part of his revenge, nor indeed was there any need; for Du∣mont who never suffered passion, with∣out just grounds to influence his mind, thought he had so justifiable an excuse for it on this occasion, he gave it full scope, and left the wretch just life e∣nough to confess his crime, and publick∣ly beg pardon.</P>
<P>The history of this affair in a few mi∣nutes got wind, sufficient to blow a whole mob together. And when the male-madam was permitted to decamp as he was, leading between two to
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>
his chariot, they snatched him from his supporters, and very handsomely ducked him in the fish-pond; nor had he a friend on his side, for even his own coachman and footman, tho' they were not assistant in his punishment, were heartily glad to see him under∣go it. Mr. Dumont having had suffi∣cient revenge, his anger began to subside, and as the wretch wore a human form, (tho' in principle below a beast) his pity and good nature resumed their throne, and by dint of a handful of silver thrown to the populace, they suffered the shame∣ful object of their contempt to be hur∣ried as fast as possible to his lodgings, where the news had got before him; and as a farther addition to his misfotune, poor Mr. Turtle, who was sent with the letter, (not knowing the contents of it,) as injured wives are apt to shew vio∣lent resentment, when they find their hus∣bands are engaged in intrigues, flew a∣bout the house, raving like a distracted thing, menacing bitterest revenge on him and his filty creter; adding, corse me, if I forgive this willingy; this is the second time you have wronged me;
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>
if I bear it a third, the fault shall be mine; I desire we may saprate, ungrate∣ful man; I have ever been true to you, and this is my reward.</P>
<P>Mr. Loveman, who was in too misera∣ble a condition to expostulate with his offended fair; begged madam for that time to set aside its anger, and give what assistance he cou'd towards his relief. Surgeons were sent for, un∣der whose hands he remained for a∣bove a month, before he could be mo∣ved. At the expiration of which time, he was forced to go privately away from Tunbridge, for fear of a second en∣counter; and the fracea between him and his lady was made up, (as one of the fervants informed us, who over∣heard their discourse) with a faithful pro∣mise to retire from the world, and live <HI>shepherdesses together in some remote country</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont satisfied the poor land∣lord, for the preparations made for him by the love-sick squire, and some da∣mages done in the fray. Then the three friends returned home, and gave the history of their adventure to Miss
<PB N="69" REF="79" MS="y"/>
Evelyn and her mama. Mrs. Evelyn tho' she allowed the justice of the thing, could not help pittying the unhappy creature; but Miss said, she could not entertain the least grain of compassion, for that in her opinion, no punishment was sufficiently severe for such unna∣tural monsters.</P>
<P>When they had finished their narra∣tion, the ladies proposed taking a turn in the Queen's Grove, which was readily accepted by all, particularly Sir John Generous; who was passionately, but at that time secretly in love with Miss Evelyn; nor was Lord Worthland totally free from the power of her beauty, but his being a married man, and conscious that Miss Evelyn's virtue was invincible, prudently declined any opportunity of encouraging a passion he knew would only be a motive of grief, without the least hope of redress; so took his leave and went to the hazard table.</P>
<P>On their return they pass'd the rest of the evening till supper time at cards; Mr. Dumont took notice Sir John did not mind one tittle of his game, but kept his eyes fix'd on his lovely partner,
<PB N="70" REF="80" MS="y"/>
who, from his remissness in play, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drawn in to lose several guineas; at last growing impatient at his carelessness and her ill success, she changed him for Mr. Dumont, and Sir John was turned over to Mrs. Evelyn, who partook of her daughter's ill fortune equally; at last said Dumont, I believe the only way to make Sir John mind his cards, will be to st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke Miss Evelyn. Upon which Sir John blush'd and trembled, and beg'd to give off playing; accordingly they did, and for about an hour Mr. Dumont and Miss Evelyn entertain'd the Baronet and her Mama with musick and singing; Mr. Dumont accompained Miss's hea∣venly voice on the harpsichord; the reader may be sure the melody of her pipe, with her skill conjoin'd, were not a little fatal to the lover's ear. Every charm this lady was possess'd of, threw in their darts by thousands, yet notwith∣standing the violence of his passion, there was such a commanding awe in her countenance, he durst not give the least hint of the conquest she had made, but resolved within himself, to impart his distress to his friend Dumont, which he
<PB N="71" REF="81"/>
did, by sending him a card next morning to meet him at the Glo'ster tavern, then took his leave; how he rested I leave to the imagination of all contemplative lo∣vers, and as night is far spent, shall, in compassion to my readers, leave them to their repose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> meets Sir <HI>John</HI>. Their Discourse. Three strange Figures make an unexpected Appearance at the Ball at Night. A Description of them.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Mr. Dumont hastened to Sir John upon re∣ceiving the card, and found him repeating verses to himself, which were encomiums adapted to the fair idol of his soul; he was so lost in his rhapsodies that Mr. Dumont, who stood smiling at him, had been in the room near five minutes be∣fore he perceived him; at last spying him out, beg'd ten thousand pardons; but,
<PB N="72" REF="82"/>
said he, you must forgive the fond rap∣tures of a distracted lover, for, upon my soul, dear Dumont, that's my case. You might have spared that information, reply'd the other; your behaviour at cards last night was a sufficient testi∣monial of your having lost your senses. I hope you don't mean that as a rough compliment to the lady, said the baronet, for no man can be in his wits, or indeed have any sense at all, that is incapable of feeling the efficacy of such a fund of beauty, understanding, and sweetness of disposition. But perhaps, continued he, I am talking to a rival all this while. I assure you no, said Dumont, my regard to Miss Evelyn is founded entirely upon a fraternal friendship, and that with the utmost tenderness for her person, and due regard to her honour. I would not hear of an injury offered to either, nay, but barely intended, without revenging it with my sword, tho' my life were to prove the forfeit for my integrity. I look on her as on a very beautiful picture, which all must be allow'd to admire; and in conversing with her, I think of her understanding as of a well-wrote volume,
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
where, the more I read, I continually find out new beauties, and consequently never tire in the perusal. Is it possible, answered Sir John, you can have such elevated thoughts, and yet keep your heart secure? but perhaps you are engaged elsewhere. Indeed, Sir, replied Dumont, I don't know that ever I was seriously in love in my life, though I promise you, I have a heart susceptible of it, from some tender attacks in a few trifling gallantries with the fair sex; but I have not yet met with the woman that is to make me her entire slave; when I do, I don't doubt but I shall appear as ri∣diculous a figure as you do now; did you but see how harmless you look, you would laugh at your own shadow; but come to the purpose.</P>
<P>I suppose the design of this interview is to engage me in your interest with Miss Evelyn, and from your want of assurance, I must break the matter to her, is it not so? Truly guess'd, said Sir John, if four thousand a year clear estate can make her amends for the incum∣brance of such an odd fellow as I am; I'm ready to throw both at her feet to
<PB N="74" REF="84" MS="y"/>
morrow morning; and, between you and I, all raillery apart, my dear friend, she or death must be my portion. I have loved her to distraction near a twelve-month, and find myself unable any longer to bear the torment of un∣certainty; therefore depend on your friendship to urge my suit with the most persuasive eloquence, which no one is more happily possess'd of than yourself.</P>
<P>Dumont faithfully promis'd him all the assistance in his power, advising him to wait patiently till their return from Tunbridge, in respect to the Count, who had adopted her as his own child; and however Miss might be inclined to his proposal, he was certain without his Lord∣ship's approbation, it would be in vain to hope for success; and farther urged, that he thought it a compliment due to his Grand-papa, to be first acquainted with it, nor upon any other conditions would he undertake his cause. The impatient lover thought it hard, but rather than run the hazard of not obtaining his wish∣es, acceded to the treaty, well knowing that all punctillio's of honour and respect to the Count, were strictly kept up by
<PB N="75" REF="85" MS="y"/>
the whole family; and as he had the satisfaction of constantly visiting there, it greatly lessen'd the pain he must have otherwise endured from the protraction of his happiness.</P>
<P>It growing near the usual time of dressing, the gentlemen parted, but Sir John soon ran through that ceremony, and in about an hour's time was at Mr. Dumont's lodgings; by way of asking the Ladies if they went to the ball that night, which was given by a young Nobleman who was just come of age, and to the possession of a very great estate.</P>
<P>Miss Evelyn told him they should all be there, for that his Lordship had just sent tickets before he come in; he then beg'd the favour of her hand as a part∣ner in dancing, which she readily con∣sented to, to the no small transport of the desiring lover.</P>
<P>In the evening they all went together, where there was a most splendid appear∣ance of people of the first quality and di∣stinction; but to the great surprize of this polite assembly, there suddenly appear'd three of the most droll and really gro∣tesque figures that was ever represented
<PB N="76" REF="86"/>
by way of burlesque upon either of the English Theatres, Sir Boistrous Blunder, with his son and daughter. Sir Boi∣strous was one of those true hearted En∣glish gentlemen, who gave the strongest proof of the regard he paid to those glori∣ous staples of his country, <HI>viz.</HI> a good fat ox, and the best brew'd malt, not for∣getting that necessary ingredient towards the composition of a well-fed country squire, call'd a pudding; the son's waist was within a few inches arrived to the glori∣ous circumference of the Sire, and seem'd, by his bulk, to have been no less indus∣trious in that happy acquisition; nor did Miss fall short of either for size and stature; her full blown rosy cheeks, and sturdy structure, fully demonstrated, that like
<Q>“Cato's daughter, she inherited all ”her Father's virtues.</Q></P>
<P>They were no sooner enter'd, than the eyes of the whole assembly were employ'd in an exact survey of them; nor could the antidiluvian figures they made, fail of fixing every beholder into an absolute astonishment; their cloaths were of the fashion of the last century, the young Lady had a garden sattin gown and coat, which, undoubtedly, had been trans∣mitted
<PB N="77" REF="87" MS="y"/>
to posterity for at least six gene∣rations, with a hoop about the size of a milk pail, and a four-lappet head with a broad point lace, so loaded with starch that a thump from one of the lappets might fairly have knocked down a por∣ter; and such an inundation of broad rose-colour'd ribbands, a milliner might have subsisted a quarter of a year from the profits of them; which, with the addition of a red neck and face, she appear'd like a moving fire.</P>
<P>The son was as elegant in his dress, which consisted of a yellowish looking camblet, with a narrow boot sleeve that was turn'd up very near his shoulder, adorn'd with a mighty narrow binding of half lace that looked like tape of a farthing a yard; his coat short waisted, and the skirts reaching at least three parts downwards on his legs; his long lank sorrel hair, to show a distinguishing taste, was tied back with a black ferret, about the length of an untam'd colt's tail; and the lovely bundle over his forehead, and each side his face, was a frequent impedi∣ment to his eyes and mouth; and the sudorifick quality of his head render'd
<PB N="78" REF="88" MS="y"/>
the use of pomatum entirely needless. In short, whosoever has had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Costollo's inimitable and droll performance of the character of 'Squire Timothy Gazette, in Mr. Foote's comedy of two acts, entitled the Knights, may have a true picture of him in that actor's lively representation; whom, to do him a real piece of justice, I don't know any of his cotemporaries can equal in that part; and what considerably adds to the satisfaction he gives the Audience, he has sense enough to play the fool <HI>without laughing at his own jokes</HI>, but wisely leaves that for the spectators to do; an error which, tho' he prudently avoids, most of our comedy actors are apt to run into, by which means they very justly acquire the character of buffoons.</P>
<P>I hope the unexperienced part of the stage, will (as Mr. Vellum says) pardon me for being jocular, but it is really true; and hope, for their own sakes, they will have wit enough to take my hint, and follow Mr. Costollo's Example.</P>
<P>I must a second time beg pardon for digressing from my subject, but as it bore some sort of connexion, hope to be for∣given,
<PB N="79" REF="89" MS="y"/>
and shall now return to my story.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was as great a cu∣riosity as his worthy offsprings; his appearance bespoke him a very old fashion'd country grazier; his extream broad face and fat jowls, gave the com∣pany a perfect and lively idea of a Sara∣cen's head; his bulk and stature very little inferior to the giants in Guild-hall; his behaviour was concomitant with the description given of his person. As for example, through the excessive heat of the weather, and the multitude in the assembly, the knight very politely threw off his wig, turning the caul inside out to dry, and slap'd it down by a well-dress'd young lady, who was obliged, from the sickly scent, to have recourse to the other end of the room; then, after rubbing himself down like a cart horse, cover'd his reeking bald pate with a large silk handkerchief, stripping his cloaths open with both hands, shook his sudo∣rifick shirt, which had not a dry thread in it, till he had poison'd all the company, not only with the odious smell, but the beastly sight of his dirty colour'd hairy bosom, that bore a strong resemblance
<PB N="80" REF="90" MS="y"/>
of a leafless hedge in winter. Miss to mend the matter, undergoing the same inconveniencies of heat, began to rub Herself down as her well-bred papa had done just before; and turning to a man of Quality, bawls out lauk, lauk, measter, do but feel how I swot. Upon this a general laugh succeeded, which Miss conceiving arose from her having said a comical thing, join'd very heartily in, as did the father, who was proud of his daughter's vivacity, thunders out his risible applause, assuring the nobleman, that Ursula was a stout wench, and if he would but talk to her he'd find her a match for him. I don't know but she might, answer'd the young Lord, but I believe I shan't in a hurry be a match for her.</P>
<P>The young squire began to express his uneasiness to his father, at being so long absent from Ringwood and Jowler, desiring 'em to go home; no, no, says the knight, let's see a little more jigging first; pox on't, says the son, I'm tired on't; drawing out a short empty bench, stretch'd himself out like a corpse, and in less than two minutes, fell into a most pro∣found
<PB N="81" REF="91" MS="y"/>
fit of snoring; in which he con∣tinued some time. The company re∣questing a minuet and louvre from Mr. Dumont and Miss Evelyn; the old man was charmed with their uncommon and attractive air, as his brother beasts were by the sweetness of Orpheus' pipe, and jumbling his heir apparent forced him to wake to observe them. With much difficulty the youth awoke; when he had sufficiently yawn'd, and stretch'd forth his arms and legs, to the infi∣nite hazard of those who stood near him; he told his father, it might be very fine for ought he knew; but he had rather see his favourites Ringwood and Jowler in full career after a stags. Hold your tongue, you fool, says the father, I understand they are rich folks, and if I can, I'll make up a match with 'em for you and Ursula; when Madam has done dancing, do you go and have a little jaw with her; you dog you can be comical enough when you have a mind to't; dang me, if I do, said the squire, (scratching his head) I don't under∣stand half their lingo; they have got such a pack of cramp words, the devil
<PB N="82" REF="92"/>
himself don't know what to make of them. Pho! you blockhead, replied the knight, I'll talk to 'em myself, I warrant you I can find out their meaning, tho' your numpscull can't.</P>
<P>When the dance was over, Sir Boi∣strous tying his handkerchief under his chin, with his hat in one hand, and his greasy wig dangling in the other, marches boldly up to Mr. Dumont and his company; accosting him in the man∣ner following:</P>
<P>Well done young folks, e'god you two be the feetest of the set, I minded that; then turning to Sir John Gene∣rous, gave Him some degree of approba∣tion; but assured Him, he was nothing to compare to the young man in the broi∣dered coat; but I like you all, an if so be you come and foul a plate with me to-morrow, if you have got nothing bet∣ter to do, you shall be wellcome; for I have got something to say to you.</P>
<P>For heaven's sake, said Sir John, in a whisper to Dumont, accept the invita∣tion; I would not for fifty guineas lose this sport. Mr. Dumont in compliance
<PB N="83" REF="93"/>
to his friend's request, promised to wait on him.</P>
<P>The knight perceiving there were four of them, desired 'em all to come. I see you are all of one knot, and one shall be wellcome as t'other; cried the hearty old man. Then calling to his daughter, with a hip ya ho, our Ursula! Miss came stumping cross the room, with the air and gentility of a plowman, and curtysing upon one leg to the com∣pany; turned to her father, to know what he kept such a hooping for? Why lookee, d'ye see, said he, I have asked these gentlefolks to dinner to∣morrow; now do take care, d'ye see and get something clever; now take notice, d'ye see, here's four of Them, and three of us, that makes seven; let there be plenty, that every one may have enough; full bellies, and empty platters, say I, Heh, young lady! ap∣plying to Miss Evelyn, as to good liquor, that shall be my care, and a hearty wellcome you may depend on; so pray don't baulk me now, but be sure to come; they faithfully promised, and kept their words.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="94"/>The knight recollecting, that tea was a general use with the ladies in an after∣noon, strictly charged his daughter, to get an ounce of each sort of the best; and a pound of the finest sugar; that's an article, you must know ladies, we're seldom provided with; for my part, I don't know the taste on't. And for Ursula and her brother, they ge∣nerally make a hearty meal with me, of what's left of the cold meat the day before, and a tankard of stingo; but I have a good three thousand a year, for all that; and lookee, d'ye see, adod I love to keep up the custom of good Queen Besses days, when the maids of honour could make a hearty meal out of a rump of beef for breakfast; and I warrant they looked as fat and as fair as your fine ladies of the present age. A woman now that is bigger than a sixpenny doll, is looked upon as a mon∣ster; but lookee, had that ancient cus∣tom been kept up, so many good es∣tates would not have wanted heirs to 'em. A boy of ten years of age in those days, was stouter than a man of five and twenty now; why there's my daughter,
<PB N="85" REF="95" MS="y"/>
shall wrestle or box with e'er a two men within fifty miles of her, for a wager of as many pounds.</P>
<P>Sir John Generous, who was expiring with laughing inwardly, could not help allowing, that Miss gave very promising hopes of a happy capacity for so lively and necessary a qualification in a young lady: acknowledging, that he should, tho' a well set and full grown young gentleman, be fearful to encounter her in a boxing match. I own Miss is finely turn'd for that exercise; nor do I believe she can possibly be matched by any of her sister-females thro' the three kingdoms.</P>
<P>Sir Boistrous, whose stupidity took this speech of Sir John's for a mark of approbation; answered, no truly I be∣lieve not; you see what a stout fellow her brother is, icod she trip'd up his heels the other day, he could have no share with her, a rare girl, a rare girl, I faith.</P>
<P>The old gentleman having sufficiently descanted on the young lady's strength and agility, thought it time to take leave for that night; repeating, from the far∣ther end of the room, till he had reached
<PB N="86" REF="96"/>
the door, his injunctions on the compa∣ny not to fail of their appointment; then stuffed himself and unsizeable daughter into their jingling cha∣riot, which sounded like a set of pri∣soners in chains, from the rattling it made when going along.</P>
<P>The young squire to give proof of his exalted notions of life, mounted the box; ordering the coachman to get up behind with the footman; but the poor squire, having more alacrity than judgment in driving, suddenly whipping up the ambling and trotting beasts, took too short a turn, and unfortu∣nately overset the vehicle; upon which Miss roar'd out, odd roty what a plague business had you to pretend to drive, what does father keep Jonas for? Pox on your fine airs, you have broke every bone in my skin.</P>
<P>The corpulent knight, who suffered a few bruises, was equally enrag'd; and having crawled out of the leathern conveniency, sat down at an ale-house door, to save charges; while Miss, who had received no other hurt than the surprize, was greatly instrumental in help∣ing
<PB N="87" REF="97"/>
up the chariot; which when she had accomplished, Sir Boisterous and she got in, and Jonas was reinstated; who with a creeping care, conducted them home in about an hour's time to their lodgings, which was not much a∣bove half a mile from the ball room.</P>
<P>The squire walked by the side of them, deeply engaged in a scolding match with his sister; which lasted till they parted to go to bed.</P>
<P>The Knight with the help of some spruce-beer and Irish slate, was pretty well recovered next day; being ra∣ther in the main more frightened than hurt.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A Description of their Entertainment. Sir <HI>Boistrous</HI> not a little absurd at the Arrival of his Guests. The Squire meets with a Disaster. A drawn Battle between him and Miss. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> receives a Letter from Mr. <HI>Evelyn,</HI> by which a Discovery is made.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT morning Miss and her maid Cicely rose before their usual hour, to prepare for the expected guests; Jo∣nas, and Jonathan, were equally employ∣ed in their spheres; after they had been busied about a couple of hours, down comes the young squire; on the sight of whom, Miss reassumed her discourse, beginning where she left off the night before. After they had talked them∣selves into an absolute fighting-match, the squire with his darling companions, the hounds, set out; leaving Miss in the height of her passion, which
<PB N="89" REF="99" MS="y"/>
frequently vented upon poor Cicely, ha∣ving lost the real object of it for that morning.</P>
<P>About half an hour after one, the company came. Upon hearing the coach stop, Sir Boistrous hobbled up to the gate, in order to conduct them in; but his fancy was so taken with the grand appearance of Mr. Dumont's equipage, he entirely forgot to do the civilities of his house, and left them to introduce themselves.</P>
<P>Whilst he staid to admire the beau∣tiful painting of Mr. Dumont's coach, and the extraordinary make of the six white Flanders mares that drew it: he told the coachman, he was afraid his master was an extravagant young gentleman, in bestowing so much rich lace upon their liveries; which, in his opinion was sufficient to dress out the superior officers of a whole regiment. But upon hearing that Mr. Dumont's fortune was answerable to all that splendor, he was not a little pleas'd. And beginning to recollect that he had been guilty of an error, went puffing
<PB N="90" REF="100"/>
and blowing after the company; where he ran into a second absurdity, by keep∣ing 'em all standing near ten minutes, whilst he was awkwardly apologizing for the commission of the former. At last Sir John and Mr. Dumont made bold each to reach a chair for Miss Evelyn and her mama, which put the Knight in mind of his inadvertency in omitting that piece of good-manners; which he excused by bidding 'em not mind him, but make themselves as free as if they were at home: that for his part he never stood upon ceremonies, and hoped they would forgive him, for not being as <HI>pur∣lite</HI> as they were; for in troth, said he, I never was bred to't, nor my father before me: I know I'm a homespun old fellow, but, lookee d'ye see, you are all welcome, and that's as much as I can say.</P>
<P>His good-nature, notwithstand∣ing his rusticity, engaged 'em not to laugh at him: the old gentleman fix'd his eyes upon Mrs. Evelyn, who was really a very fine woman, and but a little more than forty; he imagined her to be a widow, and presently at∣tacked
<PB N="91" REF="101" MS="y"/>
her with an offer of marriage, and not waiting her answer, propos'd an alliance for his son and daughter with Miss Evelyn and Mr. Dumont, assuring them, that was the motive of his en∣gaging 'em that day to dinner. How, how, Sir Boistrous, said Sir John, wou'd you marry your son to his sister-in-law? Why not, said the Knight? our fore∣fathers married their Own flesh and blood, this is not so near, or if it were, why may we not follow their examples? Be∣cause, said Sir John, those laws have been for ages abolished, and they had a reason for it at the beginning of the world, in order to propagate their spe∣cies, and do honour to their Creator; but to cut off all fruitless expectation of an alliance with this lady, I must inform you she has a husband living, a gentle∣man of great worth in regard to his per∣sonal merits, and of so refined an under∣standing, that were she to lose him, I am apt to think she would never per∣mit any other to supply his place. You don't know, young gentleman, answered the Knight, I'cod if Madam were single again I'd strike up briskly to her, and
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
who knows what we might do toge∣ther?</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn desir'd the old gentle∣man to drop the discourse, as 'twas quite unpleasing; assuring him, that a supposition of Mr. Evelyn's death, even in raillery, was a theme she never suf∣fer'd in her hearing, much less to join in it. Well, well, Madam, said Sir Boisterous, no harm done, I hope; and since we can't make a match, I hope you won't take it amiss if I propose joining the young ones together. After dinner, Sir Boistrous, answered Sir John. Besides, said he, you country gentlemen, I know, seldom love to make bargains upon empty stomachs, so we'll e'en de∣fer the proposition till the afternoon: Aye, aye, with all my heart, Sir, says the Knight; and see our mouths are stopp'd, for dinner is now coming cross the hall.</P>
<P>Jonathan led the van, with a buttock of beef of a most enormous size, that the dish appeared to walk in of itself, discovering no part of the man but his legs, till he had set it on the table. Jonas, whose effluvia's of the stable were
<PB N="93" REF="103"/>
insupportable, followed next, with a large dish in each hand, laden with car∣rots in the one, and cabbage in the other. Mrs. Cicely next made her appearance, with a roasted leg of veal; and Miss brought up the rear with a great ham of her own curing, which served her for a topick during their meal; which seem'd rather calculated for the coming stomachs of so many plowmen at a harvest-home, than for the entertainment of people of distinction and fashion.</P>
<P>Miss, with her accustomed elegance, desir'd every one to help themselves, for in troth she was so whot she cou'd not cut up the meyt, not she; so e'en help your selves good folks, says she, then all your friends will love you. Mr. Du∣mont wou'd have helped Miss, but she chose to stay till they had all done, and signified to the company she'd pick a bit by and by with Ciss i'the kitchen. Then every now and then wiped her face with a greasy napkin, bitterly complain∣ing of her heat and fatigue; but then, says she, it must be so if one would have things a little better than ordinary, for I fack there's no trusting to servants.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="104" MS="y"/>After the removal of the first course, a preposterous hot butter'd apple-pye, and a thundering bak'd plumb pudding, attended by a huge Cheshire cheese con∣cluded the eatable part of the entertain∣ment; and Jonathan soon after intro∣duced a boiling bowl which contained six quarts of rum punch, to close this noble treat; the scent of which, 'tis supposed, drew the young Squire home, who, with his two dogs, meet∣ing the servant at the parlour door with the buttock of beef, had it again re∣plac'd on the table, which disorder'd the whole oeconomy of it, and without sit∣ting down, decently reach'd across the ladies to cut a slice of about four pounds weight, which he laid upon a monstrous slice of bread of the thickness of a large brick-bat; after having wash'd it down with near two quarts of strong beer, he be∣gan clapping his sides, which set Ring-wood and Jowler upon full cry; then bless'd his stars that he should be able to hold out till supper. And now, said he, puffing and blowing, I have time to ask you how you all do? Then, by way of being extreme comical, told 'em he
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
knew he should come in with 'em for all they set out before him; 'twas not his custom to stay till the course was over. I'cod I have a nose as keen as a grey-hound, I knew I should come in by hedge or by ditch.</P>
<P>The Knight and Squire thundered out a barbarous loud laugh at the conclusion of this witticism, telling the company, that Joceline was the cutest dog in all Devonshire: Lord, to hear the witty things that rogue comes out with at club! There's Sir Arthur Addlepate, Mr. Francis Fulsome, Sir Frederick Fatty, and Sir Simon Stupid, are never at rest without him; they'll sit and smoak, and drink, and sing for a week together, without ever seeing their beds; and drive such a randy they make the whole parish ring again; I'cod, 'tis a chip of the old block; time was when I could have done as much, but 'tis over with me now.</P>
<P>The company were entertained 'till tea-time, with the noble exploits and merry conceits of Master Joceline; when they were happily reliev'd by Jonathan's bringing in the tea equipage, whose
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
careful countenance in the execution of that office, considerably added to the drollery of his figure: Mr. Jonathan wore his own black shining hair, cut quite round his head and face, in the form and exactitude of a bowl-dish; a full black eye, with a meagre face, which bespoke him to have been from his youth the son of hard labour and in∣dustry; when he had discharged himself from this troublesome burden of care and china, which he had never been loaded with before, he quitted the room with the utmost expedition; and at the door met the landlady, who stood trembling there with terrible apprehen∣sions of receiving back some slaughter'd cups; but Jonathan, who had counted his steps from the time he took it in hand, eased her of those fears: But, <HI>alas! who can controul their fate!</HI> Miss Blunder was so unhappy in the dispo∣sition of the cups and saucers, that in planting, or rather plumping them one into the other, she soon demolished four or five of 'em.</P>
<P>When Jonathan carried in the massa∣cred ware to the good woman of the
<PB N="97" REF="107"/>
house, she wrung her hands and wept bitterly for the misfortune, protesting that the sett cost her eight guineas, and were no where to be match'd.</P>
<P>The poor soul brought in a fresh par∣cel, and without any regard to Miss Blunder, apply'd herself to Miss Evelyn, humbly intreating her to do the honours of the tea-table, as she was well assured from her appearance she perfectly un∣derstood it. Miss Evelyn complied with her request, in pity to the young lady, as well as in compassion to the landlady, whom she apprehended might possibly meet with a second vexation, had Miss Blunder proceeded in the office; but Miss gladly resigned it, and only undertook the attendance on the tea-kettle; but even in that she was unfor∣tunate, for as she was hastily going to reach it her foot slipp'd, and overset that and the lamp, which unluckily fell on her brother's legs, and both burned and scalded him to a violent degree. This put the whole company in terrible con∣fusion, and the Squire bellow'd so loud the neighbours began to assemble about the door, being apprehensive murder
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
had been committed; but when they were told of the Occident, and by what means it happen'd, they dispersed them∣selves, laughing at the aukward young lady, whose oddity they had been ac∣quainted with before.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn and her daughter kindly employed themselves in administring remedies to the poor Squire, whose suf∣ferings were very great, as was his rage on the account. Mrs. Evelyn asking for a bottle of oil, Miss brought it, and tho' the young gentleman had lost at that time the use of his legs, he had not that of his hands, but whipping up his coursing staff that stood at his elbow, he knock'd his sister down flat on the floor, who rising up was going to re∣turn the blow, had not Sir John and Mr. Dumont interposed; however, it was impossible for 'em to stop their tongues, the obliging epithets of dog and bitch were tossed from one to t'other like a shuttlecock, and menaces of severest revenge on poor Miss, as soon as ever the Squire was able to crawl: don't tell me, says Miss, I am but even with you for trundling feyther
<PB N="99" REF="109" MS="y"/>
and I out of the chariot: the Squire for∣getting the respect and tenderness due to a parent, bawls out, Ah, damn you, I wish it had broke both your necks: the incensed Knight upon this came in for his share of the reckoning, and reward∣ed the Squire with a barbarous blow with his oaken plant over his head, vowing he'd cut off the intail of the estate, and make Ursy sole heir; to which the youth replied, rot him, but he'd poison her if he did.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn advis'd Sir Boistrous to excuse his son's passion, as she was sen∣sible he underwent an infinite deal of pain; and that to prevent a fever, which might very possibly ensue, he shou'd be put to bed: this was accordingly done; and the company took leave, with an earnest request to Sir Boistrous as soon as Mr. Jocesline was able to come a∣broad to have their visit returned, which he faithfully promised, and very soon after performed.</P>
<P>The ladies and gentlemen pass'd their evening together, sometimes laughing at, but oftener pitying the unfortunate dispositions of these three melancholy
<PB N="100" REF="110"/>
objects, for such they deem'd 'em; and most especially so, as their affluent for∣tune was the unhappy means of power to make 'em expose their follies, and render themselves more conspicuously ridiculous to the world: truly, said Miss Evelyn, very innocently, I think 'twas very unlucky for Sir Boistrous to be born to such an estate, upon which the rest smiled, which she perceiving, persisted in her argument, alledging, that there was two good plowmen lost in the father and son, and a sturdy dairy maid in the daughter. They could not but allow her argument to be just, as what now appears grossly absurd in their behaviour, behind a plow, or in a cheese-room, would have been received as the pure result of natural simplicity: well poor souls, said she, I pity 'em, and wish they were wiser, or had no estate.</P>
<P>Here they were interrupted by the post stopping at the gate, with a letter from Mr. Evelyn to Mr. Dumont, the contents of which he directly communi∣cated to the company:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="101" REF="111" MS="y"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY my lord's order I inform you, that the night before last, between the hours of twelve and one, the house was beset and broke open by a numerous gang of thieves, one of which was directly taken, and has since confessed their de∣sign was to have murder'd the whole fa∣mily, and plunder the house. This scheme was happily prevented by the vil∣lains mistaking my room for my Lord's, who had they broke in upon him, as he is in his hands disabled by the gout, must have inevitably fallen a sacrifice to their cruelty; but Heaven be praised for its peculiar care of so valuable and inestima∣ble a blessing to us all. Nor can we ever sufficiently adore the glorious hand of Providence for its kind preservation of him.</P>
<P>Upon hearing a bustle under my win∣dow, which you know Sir, looks into the garden; I listned, and presently heard a ladder placed under it; being then fully convinced there must be some villainous design on foot, I crept softly out of bed,
<PB N="102" REF="112"/>
and being favour'd by the moon, reach'd down a pair of pistols, which were loaded with a brace of balls in each; while the rascal was ascending the ladder, I had time to conceal myself on the opposite side of the bed, behind the curtain; and as the villain approach'd, with what they call a sniggner-sey, in order to cut my throat, I took the opportunity, e're he could be aware, to shoot him, but it proved not to be mortal, the balls only breaking the main bone of his right arm, which was to have perpetrated the horrid murder.</P>
<P>The report of the pistol alarm'd the servants, who were in an instant assembled together, which put the rest of the gang to the rout, and away they flew, leaving a bundle of cords, in their hurry, at the foot of the ladder.</P>
<P>When the servants had got possession of the fellow, I ran to my lord to acquaint him with what had happen'd, who hear∣tily thank'd heaven for our deliverance, and order'd a surgeon to be sent for, that the villain might be preserved for the hands of justice; for fear of disor∣dering
<PB N="103" REF="113" MS="y"/>
the bone which was set but ye∣sterday, he was secured in one of the rooms over the stable, and a guard of about fifty of the poor people in the pa∣rish who set up every night with fire∣arms, to prevent an insurrection from his companions, of which he owns there are near twenty in the gang. The sur∣geon who set his arm knew him, and discover'd to us his being the inhumane uncle of our dear friend Jennings; that having spent the estate he feloniously de∣prived him of; he has since taken to robbery for support. He conceives young Jennings to be dead, in which I did not undeceive him, that he might not shock the generous youth by an application to him in case of danger, which, notwith∣standing the injuries he has done him, I doubt not his assurance would prompt him to.</P>
<P>His lordship rejoices greatly at your not being present at this adventure, and that my wife and Charlotte were also absent. Our blessings and best affections wait on all, with his lordship's compli∣ments
<PB N="104" REF="114"/>
to Lord Worthland and Sir John, which concludes me,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE><HI>Dear Sir,</HI></SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your most Obedient Servant, and Affectionate Friend</HI>, CHARLES EVELYN.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> As the fellow's bone is not splin∣ter'd, the surgeon makes no doubt of restoring him to the perfect use of his arm again, which, but that the motive of our care is to bring him to condign punishment, would scarce be worth while, for he seems too harden'd a villain ever to repent.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As soon as Mr. Dumont had read the letter, he order'd post horses directly, for himself and one servant only, beside the post-boy; as soon as he had equip'd himself for his journey, he set out, re∣solving
<PB N="105" REF="115" MS="y"/>
not to sleep till he saw his grand∣papa, leaving the ladies under the care and protection of Sir John Generous till his return, which office his honour was not a little pleased with and proud of, to be the guardian of all he held most dear.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn and her daughter would fain have order'd the coach, and have gone with Mr. Dumont, but he would not by any means permit them, till they could be at home in safety. The spur of his duty and affection soon brought him to Iver, where he arrived about four in the morning, very much fatigued, as may be reasonably supposed, the journey con∣sisting of full seventy miles, nor would he give himself time to take any proper refreshment, unless two or three times a glass of wine during the whole pro∣gress of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> arrives at <HI>Iver</HI>. By Accident another of the Gang is taken, by which Means the rest are found. Young <HI>Boistrous</HI> and his Sister make a Discovery at <HI>Du∣mont</HI>'s to the Father.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Dumont got to his grand-papa's he saw several men patroling round the house, well arm'd, among which were some of the Count's own servants, who gently let him into the house for fear of disturbing his lordship, who had been very much indisposed, from the surprize, as well as from the afflicting pains of the gout. Mr. Dumont went directly to Mr. Eve∣lyn's bedchamber, who was overjoy'd to see him, and highly applauded him for his filial tenderness and respect in haste∣ning to the Count; he rose, and with much difficulty, perswaded Mr. Du∣mont to go to bed till his lordship was
<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
stirring, then went to the servants, and order'd some wine to be mull'd, which threw him into a gentle repose till about ten o'clock; by that time he was pretty tolerably refresh'd, then got up and went to pay his duty to his grand-papa who was highly pleased at the sight of him; but asked him why he would run the ha∣zard of the night to travel. The worst misfortune I could possibly have met with on the road, my Lord, could not be half so terrible as the agonizing pains my heart sustain'd, when I heard your life was in such imminent danger; nor would I, to have gain'd the empire of the world, have been absent; from the moment I heard the news, my impatient duty and tenderest affection, left no room for thought of any misfortune, but those you were liable to from the hands of these profligate villains: and, now I am here, I am resolved to have them pur∣sued throughout the globe, but I'll bring them to justice. You may spare yourself that trouble child, said the Count, for there is a hue and cry after them already, there are such numbers in pusuit of them it is impossible but they must be taken. I
<PB N="108" REF="118"/>
understand, said Dumont, your lordship has Jennings's uncle in custody; why do you encumber yourself with him here, let him be moved to jail? The Count told him the surgeon had strictly forbid it till the bone was knit; for that moving him would, very likely, throw him into a fever, which might carry him off; and he was disempower'd from doing them any hurt, not only from a broken arm, but a strong guard that was set over him of six sturdy fellows, who attended him night and day.</P>
<P>This satisfied Mr. Dumont, who waited with much impatience for his amend∣ment, in order to get rid of him; Mr. Evelyn proposed sending for the ladies from Tunbridge, which neither the Count or his grandson would give into, judging it highly improper to alarm them by fears and dangers they might so easily avoid.</P>
<P>As villainy is ever watchful for its own undoing, so it proved with this gang, who had secreted themselves in a lone empty house, upon Iver Heath, ta∣king it by turns to go out and steal fowls, or whatever else they could find for support, not daring to endeavour to
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
make off till the search begun to be a little cool. One of them going out in quest of prey, rambled out about a mile and a half from their covert, and spied a waggon which he knew by the people who were with it to be loaded with smug∣gled goods; he immediately ran and made information of it, and in a short time, the waggon was overtaken by se∣veral men on horseback, who seized it, and the persons concerned with it.</P>
<P>It happened there was an old man, who being tired with travelling, got a cast in the waggon, to ease his aged legs for a few miles, who, when the waggon was seized, was obliged to get out, and, to his great surprize, saw his own son, which was this very villain whom he was in pursuit of for the murder of his poor old mother, and intended to have done the same execution on the father, had he been in the way; but after having cut the good woman's throat from ear to ear, he had but just time enough to make off with seventy guineas, which was all the poor souls were worth in the world. The old man resolving if possible to find him out, sold off his goods, and had been two
<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
years in fruitless search of him, till that accident occasion'd their meeting; the pa∣ricide was immediately seized, and his villainous character was a means of escape for the poor smugglers that time, who taking that advantage urged their inno∣cence; and one of them who kept a shop in London acknowledged the goods to be his, and all fairly purchased; the officers who had made the seizure, not being over wise, and a good deal surpriz'd at the barbarism of the informer, were easily talked out of their senses, and believed all the shopkeeper said in his defence. The old man was determined to make an example of his son, who as he had di∣vested himself of the filial ties of nature and affection to the mother; the father thought the world could not reflect on him if he also laid aside the father in so deplorable a circumstance, to become the justifiable prosecutor. Accordingly they went before a magistrate, which very gentleman was sent for to the Count's to receive the confession of old Jennings, he not being able to be carried to his house at that time. When the villain found that the fact appear'd plain against
<PB N="111" REF="121" MS="y"/>
him, and that the father had other evi∣dences ready, on a proper summons, to corroborate what he had deposed; the monster was determined not to die alone; and directly impeach'd the rest of his accomplices, part of whom he said were his seducers to the perpetration of the horrid act. By his direction a strong party was detached to storm their castle and take them all prisoners; which news soon reach'd the Count's ear who was greatly overjoy'd to hear it. But when Jennings was informed of it, he notwith∣standing his misfortune, raved and stor∣med like a madman, supposing his date of life being almost at a period; but the generous Count in respect to his nephew, made great interest to have him trans∣ported for life; he would have gain'd him a pardon, but his crimes were so heinous, that transportation was the ut∣most mercy he could obtain. The gang being all sent to Newgate, many witnesses appear'd against them, and they were tried and condemned the sessions following. The wicked wretch who murdered his mother, was after his execution here, sent down to be hung in chains where the
<PB N="112" REF="122" MS="y"/>
fact was committed. The humane Count, whose liberal heart and hand were ever ready to succour and com∣fort the distressed, sent the poor old fa∣ther a hundred pounds to be put out to use for his support, during the few re∣maining melancholy years he had to live. And that it might be laid out to the best advantage, Mr. Evelvn pur∣chas'd for him an annuity for life, which brought him in a better revenue than he would have had from the common inte∣rest of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont went soon after this af∣fair, back again to Tunbridge; not for∣getting before he went, to mention Sir John's passion to his Grandpappa and Mr. Evelyn; both whom, were greatly pleas'd with the overture: and deter∣mined, when Miss came to town, to use their utmost endeavours to bring the matter to bear.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont at his return having told Sir John his success with the Count and her Papa; encouraged him to make a de∣claration of his affection to the young lady. But she appeared very cold, and upon being acquainted with his passion,
<PB N="113" REF="123" MS="y"/>
grew shy of conversing with him, which gave her lover infinite pain.</P>
<P>However, he hoped that time might bring her to a more favourable thought of him, and greatly depended on the assist∣ance of his friend Dumont in the affa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, who was perfectly assiduous in his cause.</P>
<P>Sir Boistrous Blunder having heard that Mr. Dumont was returned, sent him word of his intention to wait on him next day; (which proved a very wet one) Miss arrived in the chariot, with her papa, in an old fashioned long riding-hood, with the head drawn over her face, as if she had been chief mourner at a parish funeral; and that (accord∣ing to her phrase) she might not whot her red morocco shoes, which were gar∣nished with a yellow silk lace, to represent a gold one; she stepped into her pattens, with which she most cruelly demolished a very fine walk that led into the house where Mr. Dumont lodged; by most barbarously indenting it with the rings, and throwing up the gravel before and behind so vehemently, 'twas no small danger to the eyes of the company,
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
who waited on her in, to walk near her.</P>
<P>When she had got to the parlour-door, she whipped off her pattens; in which, she had thro' the moisture of the ground made a large collection; which she civilly discharged, by thumping 'em against the wainscoat in the entry; and to compleat her elegance, set 'em down by the parlour-door. The reason that she gave for so doing was, her having lost a pair but the week before at a visit; but, she supposed one of the maids of the house had stole 'em, an now the steed's stole, ecod! I'll lock the stable door, safe bind, safe find. After she had taken this care, she disrob'd her∣self of her wet cloak; which she was going to hang upon a chair before the fire to dry; but Mr. Dumont, who promised to be bound for its appearance, ordered one of the footmen to take it in∣to the hall, till the lady call'd for it.</P>
<P>The Knight who was willing to guard against the chilly quality of the rain, had provided himself with a pipe; which he had pretty near smoaked out in the cha∣riot; and being seated in the parlour,
<PB N="115" REF="125" MS="y"/>
decently dashed it to pieces against the back of a chair, that stood near him; they had not been there long, before the young squire came hollowing along with Ringwood and Jowler; who seemed to endeavour who should out do the other in noise; which being observed by Sir John, he gave it in favour of the squire, as being the loudest proficient in this dogmatical concert.</P>
<P>Lord Worthland, who was one of the Knights of the Bath, unexpectedly dropt in, as he came from coursing; and was detained by Mr. Dumont to dinner, that he might partake of the felicity they promised themselves, from the com∣pany of the other three visitants. As my Lord was but plainly dressed for the morning, Miss conceived a very strange notion of him; and after having gazed at him very attentively for about ten minutes, she at last fixed her hands on each side, and burst into such a fit of laughing, the company began to think she must necessarily expire. Her father who was pleased to see his daughter so highly delighted; joined as heartily in the laugh, without knowing at what.
<PB N="116" REF="126"/>
At last growing impatient to be inform∣ed where the joke lay; prithee! Ursy, said he, let's know what 'tis we have been laughing at all this while? why, says she, feyther at that mon, (pointing to Lord Worthland) to see how like a fewl he wears the collar; not like Tom Cutwell, and the rest of the zow gelders in our country; they put 'em round their necks, and so hang bobbing upon their breasts; not crass and athwart, as measter wears his. Oh! Madam, says Sir John, this young man is one of his majesty's sow-gelders, and wears his col∣lar in that form, to distinguish him from the common ones; well, but then, says Miss, what is that glaring thing by his side there, fastned on's coat? (meaning the star) oh! that, said Sir John, is the badge of the parish he belongs to. Odd rot it! said she, the poor of our parish wear their badges on their arms; and what do you let sish as he sit in the room, and be a company keeper for you? Why poor fellow, says Sir John, he's good natur'd, and serves to make us laugh sometimes. Aye, aye, says Sir Boistrous, do'nt let us disturb the young
<PB N="117" REF="127" MS="y"/>
fellow, I love people that are merry, if they are but civil; besides, Ursy, said the Knight, (putting on a significant countenance, that carried with it an air of rebuke) you must not despise people for being poor; come here, (said he, to my Lord) sit down by me young fellow, and don't mind that pert jade, she has no more manners, than if she had been bred in a pig-stie; which indeed was very near the case, for that and the diary, were the only academies Miss was ever trained up in; of which, the young lady's deportment was a sufficient testimonial.</P>
<P>My Lord, to carry on the Joke, as∣sumed an awkward bashfulness, bowing and scraping in a thankful manner, for the notice Sir Boistrous took of him; who promised him the business of the whole parish, if ever he came his way.</P>
<P>His Lordship's success with Sir Boi∣strous occasioned a violent laugh, which was suddenly sunk into a profound si∣lence and respect, on the approach of Miss Evelyn; whose lovely form natu∣rally and unavoidably excited it.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="128"/>She was dressed in a white paduasoy robe de chambre, richly flowered with silver, with every other part of her dress suitable; but notwithstanding that, the nobleness of her presence, and the native sweetness of looks, needed no ornaments to set them off; as she was allowed without any exception, to be one of the most compleat and exqui∣site beauties that ever warmed the heart of a despairing, or desiring lo∣ver.</P>
<P>She went to Miss Blunder to pay her compliments, who with a single leg'd cur∣tisy, staggering like a drunken fellow, made her an awkward return. At last perceiving Miss Evelyn's robe to hang loose, and flowing behind; bawls out in a surprize, laud! laud! mistress, all the plites of your gawnd be undone; an you'll come here, I'll <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack 'em dawn for you; 'tis pity you should go so, it looks quite trapish.</P>
<P>Miss Evelyn thanked her for her offer; but told her there was no necessity, for that was the fashion and form those sorts of gowns were made in. Odd rabbit the fashion! if these be the
<PB N="119" REF="129" MS="y"/>
fashion, the devil should wear it for Ursula! now praye, what may you call that flouncy garment? for I sup∣pose it has some fine fangled neam belong∣ing to it. 'Tis a robe, or rather a long sack, said Miss Evelyn, and is ge∣nerally worn now by people of fashion and distinction. Aye, so let them, an∣swered the mawkin, give me a good tight gawnd, say I.</P>
<P>Here their discourse ended, by Mr. Joceline's enquiry about dinner, who being informed it would be a full hour before it was ready, assured them his great guts were ready to eat up his little ones, that they had cried cupboard some time, I'cod the hounds and I shall be famish'd; but howsomdever, says he, we'll be before-hand with you; and calling his two dear friends after him, he took a march into the kitchen, where he star'd at the variety of dishes that were preparing, and except the fish, venison, and fowl, he could not con∣ceive what the cooks were conjuring about, as he was pleased to term it; de∣claring, he had never seen such messes in all his born days before; but that he
<PB N="120" REF="130"/>
might be sure to eat something he had been used to, he cut himself a thick piece of bread round a large loaf, and slapp'd it into the dripping-pan, which when it had soak'd up about a pound and half of fat, he returned to the com∣pany with the sop dripping all the way, greas'd up to his eyes: Miss, who was as sharp set as her brother, bounc'd from her chair and seiz'd one half of it, scalding her mouth for fear he should snatch it back again. After they had maundered at each other and musled up the sop, the Squire whips up one of the nice pinch'd napkins that lay upon a plate, when, after having sufficiently greas'd and towzell'd it about according to their politeness, threw it on the mid∣dle of the table. Mr. Dumont rung the bell for a servant to take it away, and place another in its stead: but Miss Boistrous insisted upon having that, urging that washing was very dear in that place, and that there was no need to be so dainty, or so wasteful, that she knew of. However, Mr. Dumont, in respect to the rest of the company, had it taken away, for Miss and her bro∣ther
<PB N="121" REF="131"/>
had made it in such a filthy con∣dition it turn'd their stomachs; and the more so, as they had both unfortunately made use of it in the capacity of a pocket handkerchief.</P>
<P>Dinner being at last brought in, the old gentleman thought there wou'd be no end of the procession of servants, there being seven, who brought in each a seperate dish, and cover'd the table very elegantly in two minutes time: among those in the first course, there was a fine ragou, some of which being offered to Miss Ursy, she could not be perswaded to touch it, for that she did not like the sight of the rags and jags, it might poison her for what she knew; but luckily for Miss, there was a young turkey pout; many of which she had rear'd in her time; so without ceremony, she slit it down the middle, and clapped it on her plate; turning the other half to her father, whom she knew to be very fond of it. In short, not one of the three could be prevailed on to taste of any thing, but what they were perfectly ac∣quainted with. When a very large haunch of venison was set on the table,
<PB N="122" REF="132"/>
the knight and his two babes fairly picked the bone without any other per∣son partaking of it.</P>
<P>After a very elegant dinner consisting of one and twenty dishes, seven at a course, the knight protested had it not been for the fat haunch he should have rose hungry; and that for his part a gammon of bacon, or a round of beef was to him preferable to all the fine kickshaws that France or England could produce. Instead of the variety of wines, of which there was abundance, he chose old English beer, of which he and the squire and Miss drank so plentifully, they were all three tolerably gay by that time dinner was ended.</P>
<P>When all was over and the servants withdrawn, Sir Boistrous began to pro∣pose the matches he intended for his son and daughter with Mr. Dumont and Miss Evelyn, addressing himself to her mama, who in as civil a manner as she possibly could, at once gave him a positive denial, assuring him in a tender manner that notwithstanding his having a good estare, there was such a disproportion in their understandings, it would be impossible
<PB N="123" REF="133" MS="y"/>
for them ever to be happy together; that she thought some wealthy farmer's son and daughter would be more suitable matches for the squire and Miss, therefore beg'd him never more to make any over∣tures of that kind, as she was well assured it would be a fruitless attempt. The knight grew a little testy at this refusal, and urged the family's being a very Ancient one, that for many generations had been baronets, and that he had ten thousand pounds over and above his estate in ready cash in a sly corner, that he would toss into the bargain at his death, in case Miss Evelyn behaved well to him. But alass all arguments were vain, and Mrs. Eve∣lyn was forced to put an end to his so∣licitations by an absolute and peremptory denial.</P>
<P>The young squire ended their dispute, by telling him that all he had been talk∣ing about to Madam was of no conse∣quence at all, and that it would be impossible to keep it much longer a secret, so it might as well come out then as at another time; that in plain terms he had been privately married to Cicely the maid, for upwards of six months, four
<PB N="124" REF="134" MS="y"/>
of which he believed she was gone with child. The enraged knight flew from his seat, and snatching Mr. Dumont's sword that stood in the window, would have run him thro' the body had not the gentlemen held him, while the squire ran out of the room, who returning in about five minutes, holding the door and popping his head in, hearing his father swear, hollows out
<Q>“Why what a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls the old fool to keep such a rendy; mahap I han't told you all neither, for at the same time I married Ciss, our Ursy married Jonas the coachman, and I believe she and Ciss will pig toge∣”gether.</Q>
When the old gentleman heard this news, Miss was forced to fly, and the poor old man fairly fell into a convulsion fit, occasion'd by the vio∣lence of anger, and the prevention of his revenge on the objects of his fury.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont follow'd the squire and his sister into the summer house, where they had taken shelter from the terrible storm they had perceived was rising in the offended father; he knew to pre∣tend to expatiate on the rashness and folly of their new alliances was but loss of
<PB N="125" REF="135" MS="y"/>
time on two such impenetrable mortals; the utmost he could do towards making up this unlucky breach in the family, was to perswade the two young ones home, with a promise to keep out of the old gentleman's sight lest he should re∣lapse into a second rage, which he fear'd would be difficult to quell; that he would use his utmost power to mollify his anger, and endeavour at a reconcili∣ation. They promised to be guided by him, took leave and went home, where they were no sooner arrived but they related the whole matter to their spouses.</P>
<P>Jonas and Ciss were own brother and sister; Cicely was a pretty neat girl, and bless'd with the seeds of a little more common sense than for the generality those country wenches are endow'd with; from the result of which, since her mar∣riage was no longer a secret, she resolved to improve by art those few advantages which nature had bestowed on her; and with the first opportunity after matters were made up, she put herself under the care of the best masters of the place, among which was a Frenchman, who in about three years time made a very great proficiency
<PB N="126" REF="136"/>
in Mrs. Cicely; nor was the dancing-master wanting in his art to new model her, by which means she in the end turn'd out a genteel sensible young crea∣ture; she had such an ascendant over her spouse (who was extremely fond of her) that by her example and advice, she made considerable alterations in him in a few years; and though she could not, from his want of a better understanding, make him a Fine gentleman, yet he was so far influenced by the strength of his affection for her, that it empower'd her to civilize the brute, and render him by many degrees, a more tolerable creature than he might possibly have been, had he fallen into any other hand. Cicely's bro∣ther who was a handsome fresh colour'd youth, was no less fond of his improve∣ment than his sister, closely applied himself to study in order to cultivate his mind, and make himself a companion for the best gentlemen in the county, which indeed he never attempted, till by edu∣cation he had so far qualified himself, as not to run the hazard of being laugh∣ed at.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="137" MS="y"/>Mrs. Evelyn and Mr. Dumont kept Sir Boistrous all that night, and passed the most part of it by his bedside, en∣treating him to reconcile this matter to himself, and to consider that as they had wedded where they loved, they stood a better chance of being happy, then if they married with people of more exalted sense and greater knowledge of the world; who in all probability might, though they admired their fortunes, despise their per∣sons for want of better intellects; to be short, they gain'd their point, and by dint of plain and forcible argument, con∣vinced the knight that it was better for his own sake as well as theirs freely to forgive them, which he did, and suffer'd Mr. Dumont to send for them to his lodgings.</P>
<P>Miss Evelyn conceiving that the sight of his son in law's appearance in a livery, must shock the good natured old gentle∣man, prevailed on Mr. Dumont to send a suit of his plain cloaths for Jonas to appear in, and one of her morning dresses for the squire's lady; when they were thus equip'd they came and paid their duty to the father, whose streaming eyes
<PB N="128" REF="138"/>
confessed a natural tenderness for them, that needs no other eloquence to describe. It is true Jonas married for interest, and Miss for love, both which were motives sufficient to induce her husband's good nature and humanity to use her tenderly.</P>
<P>The good old knight settled them in an estate of his, consisting of five hun∣dred a year; which his son in law who understood husbandry extreamly well, took care to improve it till he made it worth three hundred more per annum before the old gentleman died. Mr. Joceline and his spouse lived with his rather, who at his decease divided his estate equally between his son and daugh∣ter, and the ten thousand pound before∣mention'd. Miss Ursy's spouse in process of time, through his excessive good beha∣viour, was chosen knight of the shire; and that his wife should not be shock'd at his sister's taking place of her at pub∣lick assemblies, in respect to her birth, purchased a patent for a baronetship. Soon after Sir Joceline came to this title, Mr. Dumont was so pleased to see such laudable ambition in Sir Jonas and his sister, and the tranquility the whole family
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
enjoy'd in each other; he desired and continued an acquaintance with them till time and circumstances which we shall mention hereafter broke it off.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> returns to <HI>Iver</HI>. Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> goes to <HI>London,</HI> sets the World a fair Example. Some re∣markable Occurrences arising from the Journey. A true Description of a Usurer.</HEAD>
<P>IN a few days after the reconciliation, Sir Boistrous went to his seat in De∣vonshire, and Mr. Dumont with the ladies, accompanied by Sir John Generous, set out for Iver. Sir John did not fail to put his friend in mind of becoming his advo∣cate in his love suit; nor did he want the kind assistance of the Count and Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn; but Miss, though she
<PB N="130" REF="140"/>
would not presume absolutely to refuse, avoided all opportunities of being alone with her lover; and by a coldness and reserve to him convinced the whole fa∣mily of her aversion to the match. However the Count was resolved to give his friend fair play for his life, which seemed greatly to depend upon his suc∣cess with this inexorable fair; he gave him an invitation to pass the remaining part of the summer with them, that he might lose no ground in the pursuit of his amour. Sir John's excessive fond∣ness was everlastingly contriving some obliging means to recommend him to Miss's favour, but in vain! The utmost he could ever gain, was one day the confession of a friendly regard, assuring him he would not even preserve that long, should he persist in endeavouring at any thing beyond it. Sir John thought himself bless'd in making that small progress towards her heart, and with infinite joy communicated it to the Count and her father; who smiling told him he must have recourse to patience; as he was obliged to go to London upon
<PB N="131" REF="141" MS="y"/>
urgent business; but that at his return he would himself undertake his cause; at the same time giving him assured hopes of success. The fearful lover, though pleased with what Mr. Evelyn said, had not courage sufficient to believe there was the least probability of succeeding; however he promised to remain as easy as possible, and continued hourly to find new ways to make life agreeable to the young lady.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn's design in going to London was to discharge the debts which occasion'd his going abroad; as Providence had been bounteous in its dispensations towards him, he thought the only instance he could give of a grateful sense of the Divine goodness, was to do justice to his fellow creatures, whom he doubted not had suffer'd many inconveniencies in being with-held from their rights, which his former indigence had for many years deprived them of. The Count though loth to lose so much of his company, could not but applaud the piety of so laudable a resolution, and not only consented to his going, but
<PB N="132" REF="142"/>
generously offer'd to give him any assistance he should require in the compleating his affairs. Mr. Evelyn in a most respectful manner thank'd his lordship, but told him the honour and blessing of his friend∣ship had empower'd him to make a perfect acquittance with interest to his creditors, and a thousand pounds over and above what would serve to that end; that he thought himself equally obliged to his lordship for the offer as if he had accepted it, but that he should esteem it such an avaricious intrusion on his friend∣ly tenderness, which he never could forgive himself should he be guilty of it.</P>
<P>I must inform the reader the worthy Count made Mr. Evelyn an offer of pay∣ing his debts on his first arrival into England, but as their acquaintance was then but of an early date, and Mr Eve∣lyn's demands very considerable, on that account he chose rather to deserve in some degree so high an act of friendship, and give his noble patron leave to judge whether he might prove an object worthy of such infinite regard; therefore declined it till fortune had put it in his power to effect the business himself without being
<PB N="133" REF="143" MS="y"/>
so troublesome, as he deemed it, to a noble generous friend, and for no service done to entitle him to a much less share of his tender concern.</P>
<P>The Count's retirement was a suffici∣ent security for Mr. Evelyn's person, whom his creditors concluded to be dead, till he advertized himself in order to con∣vene them to receive their several dues. In about two days after he got to Lon∣don they all assembled at the King's Arms the corner of St. Paul's Church-Yard; upon looking over his list of their names, he missed his chief creditor, which was one Mr. Powel a great linen-draper, whom they informed him had been dead some years; that his son was living, but breaking in a short time after his father's death, was then in confinement in the Marshalsea, where he had been upwards of two years very miserable, having no more than the groats allow'd him for his support; and as a farther addition to the weight of his misfortunes he had a wife and four chil∣dren (the Eldest of which was incapable of getting its living) and were frequently in want of bread. This shocking relation
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
gave so violent an emotion to poor Mr. Evelyn's heart, he could not suppress the tears from falling down his manly cheeks; then striking his breast with vehemence, accused himself as being, in part, an un∣happy instrument of the family's de∣struction! A chuck-headed hosier that had just received his dividend, and had more money than humanity, per∣ceiving the tender impression this me∣lancholy tale had made on Mr. Evelyn, told him he wonder'd he should express so much concern for a stranger; that any per∣son who was unacquainted with him, would imagine it to be his father by the agony he was in. No, Sir, replied the afflicted gen∣tleman, I am not his father, but I have been undesignedly his enemy in keeping him from a just demand, which had he been possessed of might have been the happy means to have prevented the dreadful scenes of wretchedness and sorrow he at present is immersed in; but sleep shall never close my eyes till I have made him the utmost reparation in my power. O lord, said the hosier! a trifle may do that, he's so abominably poor you may get off that debt with a wet finger; two or three
<PB N="135" REF="145"/>
pieces will make the poor devils as happy as princes; fill their bellies and put a whole coat upon the poor fellow's back, for he is horrible ragged at present I can tell you.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn had not patience at the inhuman disposition of this unchristian-like man, who could be so insensible of the misfortunes of his fellow-crea∣ture; but with infinite indignation and contempt of his cruelty and grove∣ling mind, he started from his chair, wondring how it was possible such wick∣edness should infest the heart of man! Had my sentiments, Sir, said he, been concomitant with yours, you would never have received the trifling sum of ten pounds I just now paid you with interest; and you must naturally and reasonably have branded me with the just title of villain had I de∣frauded you, when I had it so amply in my power to do you justice; then how much more should I deserve that name should I withold the sum of near two hundred pounds from this unhappy man, who with his distressed family are encompassed with sorrows, and exposed to the pinching hand of bitterest want. Nay, said the hosier
<PB N="136" REF="146"/>
with some confusion, I only spoke for your good, and to save your money. I shan't, said Mr. Evelyn, pay you the com∣pliment of thanking you for that regard, nor do I ever desire to enrich myself at the expence of my humanity; and most especially so when it is enforced by justice. As a proof of my detestation of any action that is meanly, mercenary, or sordidly base, I shall beg the favour of you all to leave me now, and desire your companies here to dinner to-morrow, that I may make the best advantage of time to fly to the immediate relief of this unhappy man.</P>
<P>The creditors (who were every one paid off) promised to meet him next day ac∣cording to appointment, expressing many acknowledgments on Mr. Evelyn's good∣ness in restoring them their rights, when he had it so greatly in his power (as they all conjectured him to have been dead) to have deprived them of them.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman's impatience to ease Mr. Powel's tortured mind hur∣ried him to Southwark, where he stop'd at a cloaths shop and fitted himself with a compleat suit of fine broad cloth, en∣tirely
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
new; having enquired of the other tradesman what height and size he was of, found by their description he was much such another made man as himself, Mr. Powel being an infant when Mr. Evelyn went abroad; having provided every thing from head to foot, to pre∣vent Mr. Powel being shocked from the miserable appearance he made, sent a porter with the bundle and the following letter to the Marshalsea.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>John Powel</HI> in the <HI>Marshalsea</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the ever careful hand of Provi∣dence is incessantly employ'd in the preservation of mankind who trusts to its determination, and patiently en∣dures the severity of its inflicting power; I hope you will look upon this earnest of its reward for all your sufferings as an instance of its wondrous mercy. I arrogate no praise to myself in communicating this comfort to you, but think we are equally indebted to that Supremacy who has been graciously pleased to make me the
<PB N="138" REF="148"/>
happy instrument of good to one, pining at once with distresses and despair. As soon as you are equip'd, please to dispatch the bearer to let me know when it will be agreeable to you to permit me per∣sonally to give you more substantial proofs of my sincere desire to serve you. If you'll examine the right fob you will find a trifle which waits your acceptance,</P>

<SIGNED><HI>Your Friend and Humble Servant</HI>, CHARLES EVELYN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was so politely and ten∣derly concern'd for this unfortunate per∣son, he would not suffer his own servant to carry this present and letter; because he would not expose his miseries to a stranger's eye, whom he knew must hereafter be better accquainted with him, and might possibly be idle enough to make his distress a publick topick, which his generous soul resolved should be con∣cealed.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="149" MS="y"/>It is easy to conceive Mr. Powel's superabundant joy and surprize at so kind and unexpected a relief; he re∣ceived Mr. Evelyn's bounty with tears of joy, and soon equip'd himself to the no small astonishment of the porter, from the extraordinary change in his person; which from the woeful, dejected, and even abject figure he made at his coming in, he took him for a dirty old fellow; but when he was shaved and dressed, found him an extream genteel agreeable young man; his dejected air was rather an advantage than otherwise, which in∣termixed with good natural parts bespoke the pity of the beholder. When he was dress'd he sat down and wrote to Mr. Evelyn, as the reader may see.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Worthy Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is utterly impossible for me to ex∣press the grateful sentiments of my o'ercharged heart, which your unbounded goodness has unexpectedly lifted up once more to a sense of joy, and till this happy hour it has been long a stranger
<PB N="140" REF="150"/>
to; your tender charity and promised friendship has dispelled the dreadful gloom of sorrow, which has for more than two years past been my constant and sad companion. Pardon me, Sir, for tel∣ling you I am impatient till I am bless'd with the sight of my generous benefactor, and be assured the confinement of my person will never lay any restraint on the happy liberty my soul enjoys in the pleasing power of offering up her daily thanks to Heaven for its unbounded mercy, and prayers for endless joys here and hereafter to be shower'd on you, for your wondrous worth and soft compassion on a wretch beset with ills, and over∣whelm'd with misery. The five guineas you had placed in the fob I have sent to the dear afflicted partner of my woes, in order to relieve her and her almost fa∣mish'd little ones; Their sorrows have ever given me more real anguish than my own, and in particular my pa∣tient wife's distress, whose tenderness has ever bore her share of the wretch∣ed and cruel stings of my adverse fortune. That I may not protract the transport I
<PB N="141" REF="151"/>
must infallibly receive from the honour you intend me; I subscribe with the utmost gratitude,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Powel dispatch'd the porter with his letter to Mr. Evelyn; and the master of the jail sent a trusty friend to Mrs. Powel with the money and glad tidings of her husband's better fortune; who poor woman was scarce able to support the tide of joy that flow'd round her heart at the recital.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn came on the receipt of Mr. Powel's Epistle, who waited in the yard to receive him. At the sight of this worthy gentleman, Mr. Powel endea∣vour'd to give utterance to his grateful joy; which rais'd so strong a conflict in his breast he was entirely divested of the power of expression, but by his looks,
<PB N="142" REF="152" MS="y"/>
which were certain indications of the tu∣multuous transports of his soul. As soon as he had collected himself, and was able to testify in words how much he thought himself obliged by Mr. Evelyn's huma∣nity, he did it in such a manner, that convinced his benefactor his present and future regard to him were not, nor ever would be misemployed.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel found relief from the grateful tribute of his tears, which affect∣ed Mr. Evelyn so tenderly, he made an equal retribution; and finding the other under confusion, gave him time to over∣come it, by opening to him the cause of his care and concern for him. I believe, Sir, said he, the infancy of your days when I was acquainted with your father, and twenty years absence have render'd it impossible for you to remember your having ever seen me, you being but five years of age when I left England. I have, said Mr. Powel, Sir, but an imperfect know∣ledge of you, and can just remember that there was a gentleman of the name of Evelyn, who frequently did my father the honour of visiting him, which I sup∣pose, Sir, to be your worthy self. The
<PB N="143" REF="153" MS="y"/>
same, answered Mr. Evelyn, in the juvenile part of my life, I dealt very largely with your good father, till misfortunes fell thick upon me, from a considerable loss I had in venturing the best part of what I was worth at sea, which was confounded in one fatal hour, by a dreadful shipwreck.</P>
<P>Upon examination into my circum∣stances, I had soon reason to believe I was not worth a shilling I could call my own; for as soon as I had embark'd my fortune, which I did in hopes of an improvement of it, I was reduced to live upon credit, till the return of the ship; but it pleased Heaven to order it otherwise, and all the tidings I ever gained, was a confirmation of my ruin; by this time I was considerably involved.</P>
<P>Among the number of those who gave me credit, was your generous fa∣ther; to whom I was indebted a hun∣dred and seventy pounds, which now in right is yours. In short, when the rest of my creditors pressed me hard, insomuch that I was not able to appear abroad, meeting your father one Sun∣day unawares, I strove to shun him; but his good nature pursued me with
<PB N="144" REF="154"/>
a smile, begging me to stop; which I was then in good manners com∣pelled to; and instead of the harsh threats I had received from others, he went into a tavern; and upon hear∣ing the melancholy situation of my affairs, bid me never apprehend any danger from him; adding, that he could not easily forget the obliga∣tions he was pleased to think himself under to me, when I was in the pos∣session of an affluent fortune; having dealt with him for near two thousand pounds at different times with ready money. Nor would he permit me to leave him, till he gave me a draught upon a merchant in the city for twenty guineas to supply my present necessities. I offered him a note or bond to be drawn up the next day, which he resolutely refused; assuring me, he desired no o∣ther security, than my word of ho∣nour, to repay it whenever it should be in my power; or if otherwise, to accept on it as a gratuity, for the favours he had formerly received of me.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="155"/>In short, my circumstances grew worse and worse every day, without any prospect of amendment; and I was forced contrary to my inclination with a trifling remainder of my wife's fortune, to set out for France, or to run the hazard of a jail in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>In this retreat I met with a nobleman, with whom I have lived these twenty years; and in whose service I still remain. And have happily amassed a compe∣tence to satisfy all whom I was the least indebted to; and have this very day to the last penny discharged.</P>
<P>Upon enquiry after your father, I was informed of his decease, and your misfortunes; and think this the happiest part of my life in having it in my power not only to give you relief, but pay the respect I owe to the memory of my wor∣thy friend, in laying a foundation for the future happiness of his son. Then taking out Bank notes to the amount of five hundred pounds, desired Mr. Powel not to consider the overplus as a gift, but as a debt due to him in respect of the tender friendship he met with from
<PB N="146" REF="156" MS="y"/>
his father, to prevent the calamities he must but for his bounty been exposed to.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel was so charmed with Mr. Evelyn's nobleness of soul, that he for a little time sat mute, and fixed in a plea∣sing astonishment at his uncommon virtue. He begged he would excuse him, saying all his mind suggested, as 'twas impossible to do justice to his me∣rit: that tho' it required an abler tongue than his, to speak his praise, he assured him, he was not wanting of a true and perfect sense of his inestimable worth.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn sent by Mr. Powel's di∣rection, for the person who had put him in confinement, with an order to bring his lawyer directly; that Mr. Powel might be released without delay.</P>
<P>The messenger made as quick dispatch as possible, and brought the lawyer and plaintiff; the latter was an exact and proper figure, to represent Mr. Trap∣land in the comedy of Love for Love. His diminutive figure and care-worn aspect, gave a perfect idea of his pro∣fession; usury sat triumphant on his surrowed front, and his contracted brow strongly described the stern impatience
<PB N="147" REF="157"/>
and malicious revenge on many a hapless person; whose necessity, oftener than inclination, exposes them to the insatiate cruelty, arising from the power those wretches have over the unfortunate.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this avaricious mor∣tal was going to receive all that was due to him, he discover'd such a rancourous disposition, and unwillingness to see his fellow creature disburthen'd of his af∣fliction, that he endeavoured to puzzle the cause, and detain the poor gentle∣man longer in that dismal abode of misery and grief; which Mr. Evelyn ob∣serving, reprimanded him severely, and upon examining the account between them, found he had lent the principal upon such exorbitant interest, it amount∣ed to double the sum of the debt; at last, after many disputes, Mr. Evelyn obliged him to take no more than what was allowed by act of parliament; or stand the process of a law suit, as an extortioner; by which means, he was not only liable to a punishment for the crime, but in danger of losing the whole money. With many bitter invectives on his part, he was forced
<PB N="148" REF="158"/>
to a compliance, and Mr. Powel hap∣pily delivered from his power.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn took his new acquain∣tance to the tavern, and would have sent for Mrs. Powel, but her husband excused her appearance; telling his friend, that she was so terribly reduced, by having parted with all that was valu∣able for their support, she was now be∣come the cruel scorn and contempt even of those who once thought themselves blest in her acquaintance; that as soon as she was in a condition to pay her respects, (which he promised should be the next day) she should not fail to join with him in her grateful acknow∣ledgements. As to acknowledgements, replied Mr Evelyn, there are none due; what I have done this day, was but a duty incumbent on myself, and to myself; and think, that I am the only obliged person from the beginning to the end of this affair; as heaven has graciously and providentially empow'red me to restore to every one, what was but their legal claim.</P>
<P>However, Sir, continued he, since 'tis inconvenient for Mrs. Powel to
<PB N="149" REF="159" MS="y"/>
come to you, 'twill be cruelty longer to detain you from her. Giving him a direction to his lodgings in Southamp∣ton street, Covent Garden, to come to him at nine next morning, they part∣ed, and Mr. Powel took coach, or∣dering the man to set him down in Bloomsbury-square. His wife's lodg∣ings being in one of the narrow streets in Saint Giles's; and then making a genteel appearance, did not care the fel∣low should be witness of the dismal place he was going to.</P>
<P>Mrs. Powel on hearing his voice, coming down with eager joy to meet and bid him wellcome, was so overcome with transport at seeing him, she fainted in his arms; and was no sooner brought out of one fit, then it was succeeded by another, which continued for near half an hour. But by the assistance of a good natur'd poor woman that lodged there, they at last brought her to herself.</P>
<P>The landlady, to whom Mrs. Powel was pretty deeply indebted, having no other sense but the joyful expectation of receiving her money, left the poor soul in that fainting condition, to take a
<PB N="150" REF="160"/>
regular march through the neighbour∣hood, to inform them, that long look'd for was come at last; adding, very shrewdly, that if Mr. Powel did not pay to the last farthing she wished she might be totally d—n'd, if she would not send him back to his old lodging. And for fear of disappointment, was resolving within herself to go directly to a lawyer, to take out a writ against him; till a person who stood by, threatened to set the mob upon her, if she went a step farther than her own house, till she had spoke with Mr. Powel.</P>
<P>Such was the brutality and savage temper of this wretch, who instead of commiserating the long scene of sor∣row he had suffered, and bearing a part in the extatic joy, all humane hearts must naturally feel on so unexpected a re∣demption from the sharpest misery: this monster was immediately con∣triving fresh plagues to embitter and corrode his growing happiness. But that was not in her power; for at her return, Mr. Powel demanded his bill, and instantly discharged it. Upon which, the hypocritical jade's tone was turn'd,
<PB N="151" REF="161"/>
with many assurances of her regard for him and his family; that she ne∣ver in the least doubted her money, whenever 'twas in their power; had it been ten times the sum, they should have been wellcome. She always thought Mr. Powel, tho' he was an unfortunate, yet he was an honest man. Pray Sir, what will you and madam be pleased to drink? Lord bless me! where are the little dear babies? out at play I warrant 'em. Lord, Sally, speaking to her daughter) do you go and see for 'em, and tell them, Sir is come, I dare say they are hungry; here, reach me the pye out of the cupboard, please God, they shall have their bellies full. The dissembling beast, (who had before used Mrs. Powel and her infants with the ut∣most barbarism, frequently insulting her on account of her husband's misfortunes) concluded that Mr. Powel would remain in her lodging; applying herself to his wife, please the lord, said she, we'll put up the blue curtains, and set a chair or two, and a table in the room, you can't have a prettier nor a pleasanter room when I have furnished it. By the by, she
<PB N="152" REF="162"/>
allowed Mrs. Powel neither chair nor stool, but she and her little ones were forced to sit and pass their melancholly hours on the floor.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel told her, she need not give herself that unnecessary trouble, for that he should remove his fami∣ly that evening.</P>
<P>The slut observing Mr. Powel to have a large quantity of gold, having changed a note of five and twenty pounds, as he drove home, at a friend's house<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; who gave him and his family an in∣vitation till they could settle them∣selves. She had an hawk's eye at it, and seem'd very much disturbed at his leaving her; promising to make eve∣ry thing agreeable to him, if he would stay; which he positively assured her he would not. Then desired Mrs. Per∣kins (who was always as friendly to Mrs. Powel, as her unhappy low circum∣stances would permit) to go and fetch as many necessaries out of pawn for his wife and children, as would furnish 'em to go to their friend's house.</P>
<P>While she was gone, the little souls came home, and exprest as much tran∣sport
<PB N="153" REF="163" MS="y"/>
at the sight of their father, as could be possibly expected from their tender a∣ges. Mrs. Powel began to clean and pre∣pare them to be dressed, as soon as Mrs. Perkins returned; which she did with the utmost expedition. Mr. Powel presented her with a crown piece for her trouble; which the landlady seeing, forced the poor creature to pay her directly in part of what she owed, threatning to turn her out of her lodging if she did not let her have all the rest, as soon as the two coats she had in hand were quilted. The poor creature, for the sake of a quiet life, was obliged to comply; tho' she protested, she had not another farthing in the world.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel, who had so lately felt the bitter pains of poverty, bore so large a part in the poor woman's affliction, he desired to know how much she owed this greedy mortal? Which, she said, was eight and thirty shillings, but as soon as it had mounted up to forty, she'd have sent her over the water, she vow'd. Upon which Mrs. Perkins burst into tears: but Mr. Powel soon turn'd her sorrow into joy, as she was
<PB N="154" REF="164"/>
an honest, industrious, woman, paying her debt, and hiring her as a servant to wait on the children, and took her away with him that evening.</P>
<P>This made the wretch ten times more mad than she was before, to have her lodgings stripped of all her tenants at once; but to sooth her grief, she im∣mediately had recourse to her Anniseed water bottle, which she ply'd very close∣ly. And when the coach drove away with Mr. Powel and his family, attend∣ed by Mrs. Perkins; she was so fortified with the strength of the creature, and finding herself divested of all future hopes of gain, in bitterness of rage, fell to clapping her hands, and blessing her stars, that she had got rid of the noisy crew, (meaning the poor children) damning them all for a parcel of jail birds; and bawling as loud as she could, asked Mr. Powel, how long he thought he should keep out of the Marshalsea? As the coach moved slowly, on account of the young ones, he had the pleasure of hearing her discourse the length of a street; which served them to laugh at,
<PB N="155" REF="165"/>
and reflect on the misery, the want of sense and humanity exposed any one to, who laboured under that misfortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel's friend had prepared an elegant supper for him, and waited at the street-door to give him the earliest welcome possible, expressing an un∣bounded pleasure in seeing him and fa∣mily again restored to happiness.</P>
<P>After supper, Mr. Powel gave his friend an account of Mr. Evelyn, who was the occasion next to Heaven of that prospect of comfort that lay before him.</P>
<P>Then parted to their repose, with a serenity of mind that only can be felt by those, who have undergone, and over∣come a proportionable share of inexpli∣cable misery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Mr. <HI>Powel</HI> with his Wife wait on Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI>. Mr. <HI>Powel's</HI> His∣tory. He goes to the <HI>Indies,</HI> car∣ries with him a Recommendatory Letter to Mr. <HI>Jennings</HI>. Miss <HI>Evelyn</HI> is married to Sir <HI>John,</HI> falls sick, and recovers. A Discovery of her Passion for another. A Description of his Person. Sir <HI>John</HI> dies.</HEAD>
<P>AT nine next morning, Mr. Powel and his wife went to pay their re∣spects to Mr. Evelyn, who was greatly pleased to see the transformation in Mrs. Powel, from what her husband had the day before described to him concerning her appearance.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn desired Mr. Powel to give him his history from the time of his father's death, which he did as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="167"/>When my father died, Sir, said he, he left behind him two daughters, and myself; but as my sisters had five hun∣dred pounds apiece left them by an uncle who was an old batchelor, he on∣ly doubled their portions; leaving me a thousand pounds and his stock in trade; all which was free from any in∣cumbrance, and amounted to about a thousand pounds more.</P>
<P>I had then been married about two years, and was blessed with two lovely boys which are still living. Our family being but small, and our house extreme∣ly large; to lighten the burthen of a heavy rent, we concluded to take in boarders; which we soon did, unhappily for me! as it laid the foundation for all the misfortunes I since have undergone.</P>
<P>A well drest gentleman, coming one day to my shop, after having laid out a considerable sum of money; asked me, if I knew where he could be accommo∣dated with a genteel apartment, for a couple of months; which was the time he proposed to stay in town. That his business here was to attend a law∣suit, in which he was pretty certain of his
<PB N="158" REF="168"/>
carrying the day, as his cause was just. That he had been above three years en∣deavouring to recover an estate, which he had been wrongfully kept out of by a distant relation, who took the advan∣tage of his being in the Indies to get possession of it when his brother died, who left it him.</P>
<P>I being very young, and entirely un∣skilled in the base practices of the world, immediately proposed the stranger's coming to live at our house, as his ap∣pearance and behaviour, I thought, was a sufficient recommendation, without any farther enquiry.</P>
<P>Accordingly we agreed, and he came the next day, having bought as much Holland and Cambrick as was to make him three dozen of shirts, besides a suitable quantity of fine Muslin for cravats. He gave them to my wife's care, to be put them out to be made for him; all which was accomplished with the utmost haste, and he paid ready money for the making of them, as soon as they were brought home; as indeed he did the first five weeks constantly discharge his lodging and board. His conversation was perfectly
<PB N="159" REF="169"/>
agreeable, and we grew mighty fond of his company. He passed all his lei∣sure hours with us, that he could spare from his attendence on his law suit. In short, he ingratiated himself so much into both my wife's favour and mine, that we never thought ourselves compleatly happy without him.</P>
<P>About the seventh week of his being with us, he came home from Lincolns-Inn Hall; where, he said, his cause was tried, and appeared very melancholly; which I observing, asked him the reason? The reason, said he, Mr. Powel, 'tis e∣nough to distract me, to think that I have spent such immense sums in defence of this cause, and must lose it for want of four hundred pounds more to carry on; and tho' I have a pretty estate, yet I'm so circumstanced at present, I can't command such a sum as that these six months. Upon this, I asked him where his estate lay? he told me, by the lands end, in Cornwal; then proceeded again in his vexation, to think he should be liable to lose five hundred a year (to which he said he had an undoubted right) for want of four hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="170"/>I heartily commiserated his misfor∣tune, and assured him, if I could by any means be serviceable to him, I would. To which he directly replied, why, Mr. Powel, if you know any body that can furnish me with such a parcel of money, for six months, I'll allow them twenty per Cent. and give them a bond for a payment at the expiration of that time.</P>
<P>I told him, I'd consider on't, and let him know the next day. When I went to bed, I consulted with my wife, who was equally concern'd for his distress. Upon the whole we concluded to let him have the money ourselves.</P>
<P>When I rose, being willing to put him out of his pain, informed him of my design to draw upon the bank; he was extreamly overjoy'd, and seem'd very thankful; desiring me either to get a bond filled up myself, or his lawyer should do it, while I was gone for the money.</P>
<P>Not having the least doubt of his doing any thing that was wrong, I left it to him; and in about two hours the matter was ended; and away he went, as he said to the lawyer. I having at
<PB N="161" REF="171"/>
that time a demand upon a person who had been in my books longer than I chose, desired this gentleman to take a line to him; so only writing a couple of lines on the top, subscribed my name at the very bottom of the paper, by which means a large vacancy was left, which this villain (so I must call him) tearing off the letter, fill'd up with a promissary note on demand for two hundred pounds, with my own hand to witness against me at the bottom. Being somewhat cha∣grin'd with the person I wrote to, I made an abrupt conclusion only signing my name. This cruel wretch observing that I had laid his bond in my scrutore, beg'd the favour in a few days after that I would let him write a letter on it; I in∣nocently, though stupidly, giving him the key, he found an opportunity of slipping the bond into his pocket; and the very next day while we were all at church, being Sunday, by help of his emissaries, convey'd his cloaths away and went be∣yond sea, leaving the note in a lawyer's hands to put it in force against me, and remit him the money as quick as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="172"/>In about a fortnight after his elope∣ment I was arrested for the two hundred pounds; and going to my scrutore to search for the bond to prove how much he was in my debt, was soon convinced of his knavish and barbarous design in writing his pretended letter; in short, I put in bail, and stood the test of a law∣suit, in which I was cast; the expences of which, and the losses I had before sustain'd entirely ruin'd me, and brought on the dreadful scenes of misery my poor family and I have since endured, and must have still undergone, had not, by Heaven's permission, your timely succour, Sir, interposed. My two sisters were luckily removed before this villain∣ous wretch came acquainted with me; otherwise it is not impossible, but they might have been also made a prey to his barbarity; but they being under age, and my father dead, their guardian took them intirely to his care; and he being a man that traded to different parts of the world took them with him, delivering them to his wife's charge, and it is many years since I heard from them; the last
<PB N="163" REF="173"/>
intelligence I had was, that they were in Holland, nor do I know if they are living.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn told him he was very sorry that his humanity should have been so grosly imposed on, but desired to know what he proposed to do for a future maintenance? His answer was, that he had thoughts of endeavouring to im∣prove the money Mr. Evelyn had so ge∣nerously surnish'd him with, by going abroad; that as he understood merchan∣dize tolerably well, he rather chose to settle among strangers, conceiving he should have a better chance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thriving, than among those who had formerly pre∣tended to be his friends.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn approved of his design, and gave him a recommendatory letter to Mr. Jennings, advising him to settle in that colony; as he was well assured that gentleman would prove a worthy friend to him on his account. While Mr. Evelyn staid in town Mr. Powel was continually with him; but before he left London he had the satisfaction to see this late unfor∣tunate man, with h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s family, take shipping for the West-Indies, of which a farther account will be given hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="174"/>Mr. Evelyn met his tradesmen as he had appointed, who one and all began to en∣quire after poor Powel; and it was with infinite pleasure he inform'd them that he had a very fair prospect before him of being a much happier man than ever; that he was released from prison, and freed from all incumbrances; he re∣ceived an universal applause for so ge∣nerous an action, which they said must perpetuate his memory, and secure to him eternal happiness both in this world and the next.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn having entirely accom∣plish'd his affairs, returned to Iver, where he found Sir John Generous in a lan∣guishing condition, which Miss Evelyn's scorn had occasioned; the Count and her papa consulted together a considerable time what should be the cause of her obstinate refusal; and as neither of them could assign any, Mr. Evelyn was reso∣lutely determined not to let her blindly oppose her interest. As there was no sort of objection that could possibly be made to Sir John, he took her severely to task about him; but she only answer'd him with tears; at last he told her it was the
<PB N="165" REF="175"/>
Count's request, and his positive com∣mands, that she should receive him for a husband; that if she persisted in her refusal of him, he would never ac∣knowledge her as his child from that instant. So bidding her consider on what he had proposed, she withdrew into her bedchamber; where her own maid who set at work, perceiving her young lady to be under infinite confusion, took the liberty to intreat to know the reason; which Miss unable to resolve her, throw∣ing herself on the bed, burst into a tor∣rent of sorrow, which lasted for some time; her maid, who was extremely fond of her, could not bear to see her to greatly afflicted; and being a young woman of a tolerable share of sense, in the tenderest manner importuned Miss ro ease her anxiety, by unburdening her mind to her, with a firm assurance, with∣out her permission, never to disclose the motive of her grief.</P>
<P>Poor Miss, whose heart was breaking on account of her papa's displeasure (being the first time she ever had incurr'd it and the dreadful apprehension of being wedded where she could not love, furnish'd her with
<PB N="166" REF="176"/>
ten thousand distracted thoughts; at last she desired her maid, whom she thank'd for her proffer'd friendship and fidelity, to beg the favour of her Mama to come to her. The tender mother soon obey'd the summons, and beseech'd her daughter to unfold the mystery which gave birth to this unutterable grief!</P>
<P>Oh! Madam, answer'd the young lady, there is a cause, and indeed a guiltless one; but I conjure you by all the fond maternal love you have ever shewn me, do not insist upon my making a discovery of it. The count's unlimited bounty to my dearest fa∣ther, conjoin'd with his commands, are notwithstanding my distress, too powerful motives for me to dare to disobey them, and though my soul abhors even the very mention of this alliance, I am re∣solved to sacrifice my peace to gratitude and duty; I both believe and wish my compliance may end a life I once thought happy; but from the hour I espouse Sir John, I shall date its misery to the last moment of my existence.</P>
<P>Her tender mother, though she did not insist on knowing who the person was, easily conceived that her daughter's
<PB N="167" REF="177" MS="y"/>
heart was deeply engaged elsewhere; offering her, if she would make a gene∣rous confession, she would endeavour to soften the rigour of her father's displea∣sure, and use her utmost efforts to pre∣vent the intended match; but all argu∣ments were vain, Miss was not to be prevail'd on to give the least hint of that nature; but entreated her mama to make no farther enquiry, that she was ready to yield a perfect obedience to her father's will, though she were sure to expire the next minute.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Evelyn's grief on this ac∣count was inexpressible from the fears of losing her darling child, which she ap∣prehended would be the fatal consequence of her marriage. As she was fully con∣vinced of her being violently in love in another place; what to do she could not tell, as she was with her daughter equally compell'd by a grateful sense of the Count's goodness (who was strenuous for the match) and an implicit obedience to her husband. She left Miss with her maid, and went directly to Mr. Evelyn with the relation of all that had passed, not daring to insinuate to him what she
<PB N="168" REF="178"/>
conjectured in respect to her daughter's inclination to some other; however, she used many arguments to disswade him from the marriage, but in vain; he alledging that as Miss would give no other reason than merely not caring to marry, he should positively insist upon it, being well assured Sir John Generous was capable of making her one of the happiest women in the universe; then charged his wife to let her know that in three days the nuptials were to be solem∣nized.</P>
<P>When Miss received the news she fainted away, and continued doing so for near the space of an hour; her afflicted mother would fain have return'd to Mr. Evelyn, but Miss would not suffer her; telling her that the sooner she was mar∣ried, so much sooner her life and misery would end together. Accordingly the marriage was solemnized, the Count gave her away, and Sir John thought himself the happiest of mankind, while lady Ge∣nerous (for so we must call her now) was exactly the reverse. When the ceremony was ended she fell into a swoon in the church, and it was with difficulty they
<PB N="169" REF="179"/>
brought her back to life; the bride∣groom was like a distracted creature with the dreadful apprehension of her loss, and with the tenderest endearments try'd to sooth her sorrow; he and Mr. Du∣mont led her to Sir John's own coach, supporting her all the way.</P>
<P>This violent grief was a terrible shock to her new made husband, for whom her good nature, notwithstanding her aver∣sion to the match, was not a little con∣cern'd, at being the unhappy cause of the affliction she perceived he underwent on her account.</P>
<P>The reader may suppose there was no extraordinary rejoicing at this wedding, for poor Lady Generous's grief swelled up so high, she fell into a violent fever, in which she continued near two months, and was given over by the physicians; but it pleased heaven to spare her. Du∣ring the time of her illness her fond husband, who doated on her to excess, never stirred from her night or day, till by continual watching he was almost in as bad a condition as his lady; but Mr. Evelyn interposed his authority, and in∣sisted on his endeavouring to rest, which
<PB N="170" REF="180"/>
as she began to amend, he was at last persuaded to. Mrs. Evelyn having oc∣casion to search for something in her daughter's closet▪ which she seldom or ever went into; upon opening one of the drawers of her escrutore, discover'd the fatal secret her afflicted child had so cautiously conceal'd: the reader may re∣member I inform'd them that Miss Eve∣lyn was equal to the finest limners of the age in the art of painting, which talent she exercised in above twenty different pictures she had drawn of Mr. Dumont, which no mortal eye besides her own had ever seen before; her mama was no longer at a loss to find out the scource from whence this sorrow flow'd, and privately inform'd her husband of it, which when he heard, he was ready to run mad, as he should have prefer'd Mr. Dumont for a son in law infinitely before Sir John; but since it was past recall, he laid a strong injunction on Mrs. Evelyn to bury the secret in her breast. In one piece she had drawn herself with Mr. Dumont in mi∣niature, at full length, presenting him a bleeding heart, shading her lovely eyes with a veil of cypress, which her other
<PB N="171" REF="181" MS="y"/>
beautiful hand supported, to hide the falling tears that bedew'd her blushing cheek; on the back of each piece was the date when they were drawn; by which it plainly appear'd she had been distractedly in love from the age of fifteen, which was full six years, she be∣ing just turn'd of twenty one when she married. The family could never, thro' her prudent behaviour, have been able to have found it out, had it not been occa∣sion'd by her being forced into this alliance with Sir John; that we may say of her with Shakespear.</P>
<Q><L>"She never told her love, but sat like</L>
<L>"Patience on a monument smiling at "Grief".</L></Q>
<P>By Divine permission, and the skilful care of the physicians, this unhappy lady's health was at last restor'd; but alas a set∣led sorrow dwelt ever on her mind, which her tender husband hourly endeavour'd to remove, but fruitless were his attempts;
<Q>“For love conceal'd lay like a canker∣worm upon her heart, eating thro' ”the quiet of her soul.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="182"/>As soon as the physicians thought pro∣per Sir John took her down to his seat in Northumberland, having first prepared a splendid and magnificent equipage to escort her: But now comes the dreadful stroke of fate, when she must part from all her heart held dear, without even the satisfaction of innocently seeing and con∣versing with him.</P>
<P>The fatal day being come that was to separate her from this much loved object, a fresh scene of woe appear'd; the only consolation she received was in having the pleasure of her mama's company to her new seat, which in her deplorable state of mind she would have joyfully exchanged for her grave.</P>
<P>After she had taken leave of the Count in the most respectful manner, she left the apartment to indulge the sorrow she sustain'd in parting from his lordship; but how much more dreadful was the shock when young Dumont enter'd the room to take his leave, and hand her to the coach; it happened very luckily at that moment Sir John was in the dining room with the Count, and nobody pre∣sent with Lady Generous but her mama and Mr. Dumont. When he approach'd
<PB N="173" REF="183" MS="y"/>
tears filled his eyes at the thoughts of parting, which was only the result of an innocent and sincere friendship, that grew between them from infancy, and strengthened as their years encreased: Happy had it been if Mr. Dumont's heart had received the same fond im∣pression for the lady, as she felt for him, but fate had otherwise decreed! When he gently took her hand, and pressing forward to salute her, she drop'd in all appearance dead at his foot, which alarm'd the young gentleman extreamly, giving him a pain inconceivable to see her in that condition; he was going to call out for help, but her mama prevented him, and with their assistance she was brought to herself again. After the ease of a sad shower of tears, she began to be a little more composed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn being assured that the ceremony of a formal leave between them would only relapse her into a second tor∣rent of grief, beckon'd Mr. Dumont out of the room; and desired him not to see her any more, till he went to pay a visit in Northumberland, whither he would have gone at that time, but that he was
<PB N="174" REF="184"/>
obliged to stay with his Grand-papa. Mr. Dumont observed Mrs. Evelyn's directions, and went out of the way till they were all set forward on their journey.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this young gentleman was in the eye of every beholder, the compleatest and finest figure of a man that ever graced a court, or charm'd the heart of woman, he was the only insensible person of those happy attractions; there∣fore had no other conception of Lady Generous's distress, but that it proceeded from her inviolable friendship, which was adequate with his, and equally wounded at their separation; and that the shock was too violent for her tender nature to support. He little dream'd that Sir John had only carried off the outward frame, and that her whole soul, with its dearest best affections, were entirely left with him. I should have observed that at the bot∣tom of one of the pictures this lady drew of Dumont, her fond imagination had led her so far as to insert those lines with which Hamlet describes the person of his father, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="175" REF="185"/>
<L>"See what a grace is seated on this brow,</L>
<L>"Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove "himself,</L>
<L>"An eye like Mars to threaten and com|"mand,</L>
<L>"A combination and a form indeed, "whereon</L>
<L>"Each God did seem to set his seal, to</L>
<L>"Give the world assurance of a man".</L></Q>
<P>Many may be apt to think the Lady's partial fondness excited her to give this amiable description of him without his having a real claim to it; but it is the gene∣ral opinion of all who know him, to allow he does not in the least fall short of it; nor has nature only outwardly adorn'd him, for his mind is beautiful as his per∣son; therefore we must hope that all who read Miss Evelyn's story will rather pity than condemn her, as she so worthily bestow'd her heart.</P>
<P>As soon as the new married pair were arrived at their seat, Sir John and Mrs. Evelyn wrote to Iver, giving but a me∣lancholy account of the poor lady who relapsed into a second illness, which with much difficulty she at last overcame.
<PB N="176" REF="186"/>
When she was perfectly recover'd Mrs. Evelyn took her leave and return'd to Iver. The morning they came away Sir John gave his mother in law a paper sealed up, which as it was the beginning of the year, he beg'd her to accept on as a New-year's gift; notwithstanding the smallness of the parcel, she conceived it to be a valuable present, but never ex∣amin'd the contents of it till she got to Iver, which upon opening, she found to be bank notes for two thousand pounds; upon which she wrote to her son a letter of sincerest acknowledgments; and in return he sent her word he had received more than mines of wealth from her hand, for which his whole estate and life conjoin'd, could never make her a suf∣ficient amends.</P>
<P>Sir John and his lady, notwithstanding her want of conjugal affection, lived as happy as could be possibly expected; he was ever studying to ease the anxiety of mind he too plainly perceived she la∣bour'd under; nor was he ignorant of the cause of her melancholy; and though not positively assured that Mr. Dumont was the object of her love, he shrewdly
<PB N="177" REF="187" MS="y"/>
suspected it; but as she was discreet enough never to mention his name, her husband was equally cautious to avoid it. He knew by himself that love was an involuntary passion, therefore could not blame her, especially as he had in a man∣ner robbed her of herself, was deter∣mined to make the utmost amends within his power, by a constant endeavour to make her happy; and she, on her part, strove to conceal the love that labour'd in her breast by an exact complacency of temper, and a perpetual spring of good nature; each thinking they had wrong'd the other, the one by forcibly marrying the Lady contrary to her will, and she by allienating her heart from one, whom she confessed, had it not been for her love to Dumont, she might have been truly happy with.</P>
<P>They lived together three years; Sir John's affection hourly encreasing was greatly augmented by the birth of a beautiful daughter, in the second year of their marriage; I must observe to the reader this child was the very image of Mr. Dumont, which might, in the opi∣nion of the censorious, have drawn an
<PB N="178" REF="188"/>
imputation on the lady's character had they been together at that time; but they had not seen each other two years before the birth of this infant, or if they had, there was the strong guard of the lady's impregnable virtue to take off an odium of that kind. But it is no wonder the child should bear so strong a resem∣blance of one who was the hourly image of the mother's thoughts. Nor did she fail to indulge her eyes in often viewing the pictures she had of him, which she kept unknown to any one.</P>
<P>It happened one day, Sir John was obliged to attend at the assizes, being chose among the rest of the gentlemen of the county to make up the number of the Grand jury. The county town was ten miles distant from his seat, and the court sitting late, he would not be per∣swaded to stay all night, but excited by his fondness, resolved to go home late as it was. When he came within half a mile of his own house, his horse took fright and threw him several yards from him, which broke his arm, and bruised him inwardly in so terrible a manner he
<PB N="179" REF="189" MS="y"/>
was thrown into a violent fever, and ex∣pired in a few days.</P>
<P>The first tender attack he ever made on the heart of lady Generous, was at the sight of him in his distress, when he was brought in by his servants; had it even been Mr. Dumont, she could not have shewn more tender concern; and her care of him the time he languish'd under his misfortune, greatly alleviated his pain, and convinced him of the dignity of her mind, that could so patiently endure such a load of complicated woes with so per∣fect a resignation.</P>
<P>Some few moments before the death of this unfortunate gentleman, he desired his afflicted lady to lye by him on the bed, having something of consequence to impart to her; then ordering the ser∣vants and nurse to withdraw; he thus addressed himself.
<Q>“My heart's dearest blessing, I am now upon the ex∣tream verge of life, therefore hope you won't be offended at what I am going to say; I know my un∣bounded passion for you has been the motive of that continued melancholly and violent illness you have twice
<PB N="180" REF="190" MS="y"/>
endured; for which I sincerely im∣plore your pardon. I also am no stranger to the tender regard and in∣vincible fondness your disappointed heart is charged with for young Du∣”mont.</Q>
Lady Generous intreated him to proceed no farther, unless he intended her immediate death. After having given her time to recover from the surprize and agony he threw her into by these last words, he resumed his dis∣course; assuring her that so far from being angry, he thought himself more than much obliged to her for having sacrificed her own happiness to establish his.
<Q>“When I am dead, which in a very short time, said he, I certainly shall be; the only amends I can make you, is to intreat you to let your papa (who I am assured is no stranger to the tenderest secrets of your soul) contrive the means of a reward for all those sufferings my unhappy love has brought upon you, by a wish'd for ”union with his worthy friend.</Q>
His speech was interrupted by a flood of tears; which when she had gently wiped away with the softest tenderness, he
<PB N="181" REF="191"/>
beg'd her to love his little one for the sake of him, who tho' in the agonizing pains of death, felt no pain equal to that of leaving her. Lady Generous had but just life enough herself to ring the bell to order the physicians in, who were con∣stantly attending in the house, but before they came up he had with a gentle sigh expired in her arms, fixing his fond eyes to their last beam of light upon the only object of his tend'rest wishes.</P>
<P>When the physicians came in and found Sir John dead, they immediately conducted the afflicted lady to another apartment; and sure no person breathing ever labour'd under such accumulated griefs as poor Lady Generous! Con∣sider her dreadful circumstance! Her poor heart long tormented with a hope∣less passion for another; her grateful mind corroded with the sight of her expiring husband, who doated on her even to madness; the reflection of all his sufferings on her account, and his generous consignment of her even to his rival at their mournful parting, raised such a conflict in her soul, that had she not been strongly fortified with an un∣common
<PB N="182" REF="192"/>
understanding, she must have consequently fallen a victim to such an unreasonable share of dire cala∣mities.</P>
<P>The next day Sir John's will was read, which entitled his lady to the whole estate, paying out of it a fortune of ten thousand pounds to little Miss when she came of age; and in case lady Generous died a widow, the whole estate to de∣volve upon the child; but if otherwise, it was left to the lady and her heirs for ever. He left also two hundred a year during the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Eve∣lyn, besides some trifling legacies to servants.</P>
<P>Lady Generous gave orders to her steward to have Sir John interr'd with great funeral pomp, that nothing might be wanting to testify the high respect she should ever pay to his memory. Accordingly he lay in state some days, and one of the finest marble monuments was erected, with his effigy at full length, and a beautiful epitaph describing the noble character he justly deserved.</P>
<P>The steward dispatch'd a servant with letters to the Count's family, who were
<PB N="183" REF="193" MS="y"/>
sensibly touched with the loss of this much valued gentleman. Mr. Evelyn went back with the messenger who bro't the fatal news, with a design to have persuaded the Lady to reside at Iver, in hopes of diverting her melancholly; and the rather as it might have been a means to have crown'd the end of all her wishes in Mr. Dumont.</P>
<P>When Mr. Evelyn arrived, he found his daughter, (whose beauties even grief could not shadow) sitting with her sweet babe, whom she was alternately kissing and weeping o'er: all the apartments were hung in mourning for a twelve∣month, and every soul in the house, to the most menial servant, bore an as∣pect of real sorrow for their worthy master.</P>
<P>Lady Generous was greatly pleased at this unexpected visit from her papa; who proposed her removing from her seat, for the forementioned reasons; but, even in respect to that, she discovered a nobleness of soul, which I may venture to affirm is unprecedented; for when her father urged her probability of mar∣rying Dumont, making then his know∣ledge
<PB N="184" REF="194" MS="y"/>
of her passion for him no longer a secret; she absolutely refused the offer, as she was determined to pay the strictest respect to the memory of her deceas'd husband; adding, that she had been so inur'd to sorrow, she was resolved to submit to its utmost poignancy, rather than wound her fame, by flying to such a relief as must put her in the eye of modesty, upon the level of a com∣mon prostitute.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, if the great exam∣ple of this virtuous Lady, whose love was of so delicate a nature, and founded upon the most exalted principles of truth and honour, was more universal: The British fair ones would secure to them∣selves a more lasting tenderness, and high∣er opinion of their understandings, than a too forward fondness can possibly cre∣ate in the mind of a lover or a husband.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was so charmed with her superiority of sense, he could not forbear taking her to his arms, expressing his joy, by a vast effusion from his eyes; after fondly embracing her, and kissing with tenderest affection her lovely off∣spring, whose features bore the strong
<PB N="185" REF="195" MS="y"/>
resemblance of Dumont; which he ob∣serving, alass! said he, my child, what malignant star presided to obstruct the happiness we might have all enjoyed, had fate ordain'd this little one to have been the issue of him, whose image it exactly wears, in every glance and smile? Why did you not reveal your passion to your mother, who would have spar'd your blushes in communicating the secret to me? You know the influence I have over our much esteem'd and valued friend the Count; whose fondness for you almost equals that he feels for young Dumont; then the friendship contracted from your infancies, authorized by my Lord's commands, would soon on his part have ripen'd into love.</P>
<P>No Sir, replied the Lady, notwith∣standing Mr. Dumont's being dearer to me than life and its utmost happiness, I resolved never to make the least disco∣very of my inclination, unless his heart had been equally subdued. I found a secret charm in his conversation, and the extremest pleasure of my life was to behold him. As he was disen∣gaged, I thought it a sufficient transport
<PB N="186" REF="196"/>
to know I had no rival to kill my hopes; therefore patiently endured the pains I suffered from uncertainty, and thought it a sweet reward, to have hourly in view the dear delightful object of my love.</P>
<P>But, Sir, (continued she) I entreat we may drop the subject, which now ill suits the decency required in my present circumstance. Sir John, whom I lament as a most valuable friend, must now en∣gross my thoughts; and though my dis∣tracted mind, and tortur'd heart, could not make him the soft returns of love his fondness bestowed on me; I shall, how∣ever, even to a religious sense of ten∣derness, pay that grateful tribute to his memory, his honest soul deserves, and justly claims.</P>
<P>Her father could not but approve of her conduct, yet still was anxious for her welfare, and feared her devoting herself to such continued melancholly would soon deprive him of her; there∣fore resolved, in hopes to soften and as∣swage her grief, to stay with her the winter; but was prevented by an express from Mr. Dumont, to inform him his
<PB N="187" REF="197" MS="y"/>
Grandpapa was taken dangerously ill, and begged him to return with the ut∣most haste.</P>
<P>This was another cruel stroke of fate to poor Lady Generous; who upon hear∣ing the news, said, she began to imagine that Heaven had marked her out to bear incessant and multiplied afflictions. Then sighing, cried, be it so! Who dare dis∣pute the Power Omnipotent? and since I'm born to struggle with misfortunes, let meekest patience guide me thro' the dreadful maze of never ceasing woe!</P>
<P>Her father was in the utmost distress at leaving her, but she knew he was compelled by the strongest bonds of af∣fection, gratitude, and honour; and ear∣ly next morning he took a melancholly farewel of her and his beloved grand∣child, to pay his last duty as it proved to his noble friend.</P>

<P>MR. Evelyn's great regard, and high concern, gave wings to his eager expedition; and in less time than could be expected, he reached Iver, to the great surprize of the whole family. When he saw the terrible alteration which the death dealing hand of time had stamp∣ed in every feature of the Count, he was forced to withdraw to give vent to un∣utterable grief.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont and Mrs. Evelyn, who were constant in their attendance, per∣ceiving by Mr. Evelyn's grief and con∣fusion when he left the room, that he
<PB N="189" REF="199"/>
apprehended the Count's dissolution was near at hand; they underwent an addi∣tional weight of sorrow, having till then flattered themselves with some hopes of his recovery.</P>
<P>The good Count missing his dear friend, lifting up his feeble eyes in search of him; told his grandson, he appre∣hended that his approaching fate was more than his honest tender heart could bear; therefore I won't recall him, till he finds himself capable of a voluntary return.</P>
<P>In the mean time, continued he, my dearest Harry, let me employ my latest moments in comforting thy grief∣swoln heart; consider, my child, how wonderfully in thy favour, Providence has blest me with length of days to see thee, (at least I fondly think so) the wonder of the world! and of an age to guard thyself with the assistance of thy virtues against any temptation that might lure thee to the most trifling fall of honour. Think of my departure, but as being ap∣pointed as thy careful purveyor on a journey thou must hereafter take; where we shall meet in joy never to be separated more.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="200" MS="y"/>Mr. Dumont's filial sorrow grew al∣most insupportable; which the Count tried to asswage, by telling him 'twas an offence to Heaven, to let contending grief o'er-sway his reason; that as it had spared him to a good old age, he should reflect how much he was obliged to the Power Divine, which might have cut his thread of life e'er half those years were finished; that he was now kindly invited to everlasting peace, and a cessa∣tion from such pains his nature's strength could no longer bear.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn by this time was returned, whom the worthy Count entreated with the rest of his family, to join with him in prayer; which as often as his weak condition would permit, they did most fervently. His senses continuing to the last; between the hours of one and two in the morning, with a smiling aspect, and gentle sigh, he resigned his noble soul into the All Powerful Hand that gave it. Thus ended the life of the worthiest gentle∣man that e'er adorn'd a court, or graced the most exalted titles of nobility.</P>
<P>The general grief that diffused itself on this melancholly occasion is not dif∣ficult
<PB N="191" REF="201"/>
to conceive, that I shall not tire the reader's patience with a description of it, as a lively imagination can so easily paint it in its utmost distress.</P>
<P>The Count ordered by his will to have his body deposited in France, and placed in the vault as near as possible to the remains of Mr. Dumont and Lady Charlotte.</P>
<P>His fortune he bequeathed to his well beloved grandson, and three hundred pound per Annum, to Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn, during their lives. Also lega∣cies to servants.</P>
<P>His Lordship after his embalment, was conveyed to the seat of eternal rest with his ancestors, attended by the fami∣ly in general.</P>
<P>After some time, when Mr Dumont's sorrow was in some measure allayed, by Mr. Evelyn's advice, he made a tour through France and Italy; then returned again to France, to settle some affairs re∣lative to two vast estates, which devolved to him on the death of his Grandpapa, and those he was entitled to in the right of his father; all which, made him ma∣ster of full eighteen thousand pounds a year.</P>

<P><PB N="192" REF="204" MS="y"/>When his business was accomplish'd he embark'd for England and landed at Dover, where he happened at the inn to fall into the company of Miss Le Roy, and her brother, who had been over to Paris to sell an estate they had left them by an uncle, which was divided equally between them.</P>
<P>This lady and her brother were of French extraction, but English born, and had been each possess'd of very fine fortunes; but from an insatiable fond∣ness for gaming, they had reduced them∣selves to a necessity of jointly consenting to part from the foremention'd estate, not so much for a needful support, as to supply that avaricious folly, and I may say, baseness of mind, which had been the fatal cause of their undoing. Miss Le Roy was as splendidly dress'd as a rich riding habit could possibly ad∣mit of. She was a tall graceful figure, and perfectly genteel; I can't say she was to compare in beauty with Lady Generous, but there was an attractive je ne quoy in her aspect that is equally sure of captivating the heart; which she fail'd not to do even to a distracted
<PB N="193" REF="205"/>
fondness, that of poor Mr. Dumont; nor was the young Lady unaffected with the nobleness of his form; but the ha∣zard and card tables, which were most formidable rivals, would not give way to the softer passion of love, so far as to suffer her to know the terrible anxi∣eties Lady Generous had felt on that account; yet notwithstanding she soon found he had a very particular interest in her heart, and as he closely pursued her, resolved as soon as they got to Lon∣don, to give consent to marry him, which she never promised till then, ha∣ving sense enough to secure her conquest, by not being over forward.</P>
<P>Miss Le Roy having an acquaintance who was newly married at Canterbury, she staid a week there to pay her re∣spects to her friend. Mr. Dumont went to the King's-Head with his whole family, nor was all the eloquence and rhetorick Mr. Evelyn was master of suf∣ficiently powerful to move him, till Miss Le Roy left the place.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman foreseeing that Mr. Dumont was unhappily <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allen into a dreadful snare, and from which he
<PB N="194" REF="206"/>
fear'd it was impossible to redeem him, grew excessively uneasy, setting before him the terrible hazards a man ran who enter'd into an alliance with a woman so devoted to gaming, that the best estate in the kingdom might be ruin'd from the result of that detest∣able vice, and in plain terms, told him, he saw his ruin They prolong'd their stay about ten days, during which time Mr. Dumont and Mr. Evelyn were equally assiduous, the one in pursuit of his love, and the other no less so in trying to dissuade him from what he afterwards had very powerful reasons to repent.</P>
<P>This unfortunate affair occasion'd a great coldness between these two gen∣tlemen; in short, the debate between them arose to such a height, that Mr. Dumont positively affirm'd to Mr. Eve∣lyn, all arguments in opposition to his design of marrying Miss Le Roy were fruitless, and (as he through his impa∣tience pleased to add) impertinent; this was a style Mr. Evelyn never had been treated with from Mr. Dumont, and indeed a method of discourse the young
<PB N="195" REF="207"/>
gentleman had never been before used to, even to the lowest of his domesticks; as his tutor was the first instance of his deviating from that nice decorum he had bred him up to, it struck deeply to his heart, as he regarded him not only as his pupil, but with the fond eye of a tender parent. In the heat of their debate Mr. Dumont told Mr. Eve∣lyn he thought he was of an age capable to judge for himself without any inter∣position, and as he was his own master he should act agreeable to the dictates of his will. His good friend assured him he would never more trouble him with his advice, since he found his fondness met with such ungrateful re∣turns, and apparent contempt; but in∣sisted upon his grosly mistaking his being master of himself, while he submitted to the slavery of unreasonable and ungo∣vernable passions. Then left the room with a disorder'd haste, and flew for relief to his faithful spouse, whose sweetness of temper, conjoin'd with her incomparable understanding, was ever ready to soften all his cares; and in order to mitigate the pain he suf∣fer'd
<PB N="196" REF="208"/>
from Mr. Dumont's unexpected abruptness (being fully and sorrowfully convinced of his intention to undo him∣self) perswaded him to avoid the pain of being witness of his ruin, by going down to Northumberland, and passing their remaining life with their much-valued and beloved child.</P>
<P>As soon as they went to London Mr. Evelyn took a painful leave of his unhappy friend, for such he deem'd him; and settled with Lady Generous, whose melancholly was in a great mea∣sure relieved by the tender and agree∣able conversation of her fond parents, who made it their continual study to sweeten that life which unprecedented woes had long embitter'd.</P>
<P>The surprizing change of Mr. Du∣mont's behaviour to Mr. Evelyn, which nothing but his fatal love could have oc∣casion'd, gave the worthy gentleman an uneasiness he never felt before, and such as he never truly overcame. When they parted it was but with a bare civility on both sides; but on Mr. Evelyn's part with a secret grief, fore∣seeing the sad consequences attending
<PB N="197" REF="209" MS="y"/>
this unhappy connection between Mr. Dumont and Miss Le Roy.</P>
<P>This young Lady having seen a great deal of the world, had art enough to deal with it, as every one ought to do who have a design to thrive in it; and had it not been for her fond∣ness for play, the match would not have been altogether so very unreaso∣nable, as she was descended from very good families, her mother being daugh∣ter to a peer of Great-Britain, and her father a gentleman employ'd in consi∣derable posts of honour under the go∣vernment; by which he saved handsome fortunes for his son and daughter, which they were soon strip'd of from the foremention'd vice; that so shame∣fully predominated over their hearts, from ten thousand pounds a piece, in less than three years they were not worth a shilling. They were then obliged to pursue this egregious folly as a business for their support; and before Miss was married, she play'd away not only the trifling remains of fortune arising from the little estate she had sold, but her very watch and jewels, all which Mr.
<PB N="198" REF="210" MS="y"/>
Dumont was witness of; yet his un∣limited passion could take no warning from the sad specimen she gave of what he was hereafter to expect, and too surely suffer'd: nor was that fond∣ness for this dreadful motive of ruin confined alone to her; the infection caught poor Mr. Dumont, and as it is natural to imitate the actions of those we love, he gave demonstrative proofs of his regard, by suffering this con∣tagion to poison the health of reason and reflection, which till then had ever been the happy ornaments of his well-conducted life.</P>
<P>When Miss was thoroughly convinced she was undone, and perfectly assured of her power over her thoughtless lover, she thought it high time to look about her, as creditors began to grow pressing; and she and her brother being equally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igent, she resolved to make a me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of necessity; and upon Mr. Du∣mont's next entreaty, consented to name what he then thought the day of his happiness; in pursuance of which, new coach and liveries, with an additional train of servants, were immediately or∣der'd;
<PB N="199" REF="211"/>
a set of dressing plate for the lady of two thousand pounds value; jewels innumerable, and rich cloaths to the amount of many thousands more, were provided for the bride; and the wedding solemnized with extravagant and superfluous splendour.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Dumont, who was blinded by the violence of love, conceived himself the happiest of mankind; in short, his boundless passion led him into a thousand needless follies to please and support his Lady's vanity. She soon establish'd a private assembly for play at her own house, and was never missing at all publick diversions.</P>
<P>Her brother, who by the bye, was swingingly in debt, and who had ra∣ther more cunning than real sense, un∣known to his sister, contrived with his creditors to enter into a general de∣sign to arrest him; which in about two months after the wedding was over, as he was stepping into the coach, with his brother in law, according to his own appointment and expectation, he was laid hold on for two hundred pounds; upon which Mr. Dumont,
<PB N="200" REF="212"/>
with his accustom'd good nature, re∣turned with him and the officers into the house, and immediately discharged the debt. The next day he had or∣der'd another set of bailiffs to look out for him at White's chocolate-house, where he resolved to go for that pur∣pose; so only writing a line to his sister, to excuse his being so suddenly troublesome a second time, another debt of a hundred pound more was ac∣quitted; in this manner he proceeded to get himself clear of all incumbrances, presuming upon his brother in law's uncommon fondness for his sister, to make him the dupe to his villainous impositions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dumont, who was too sensible of her brother's disregard to any points of honour, secretly rebuked him for this mean artifice, which with all his contrivance he had not cunning enough to conceal; but that he might never more become burdensome to her husband she prevail'd on him to purchase him a commission, only proposing his ha∣ving a pair of colours in the guards; but the too generous Dumont changed
<PB N="201" REF="213"/>
that design into a colonel's commission in the dragoons; yet notwithstanding he began to find out the nature and principles, or rather the want of them, in this gentleman, yet he was resol∣ved never to miss any opportunity of convincing his spouse of her vast ascen∣dancy o'er his heart.</P>
<P>As soon as this new officer was establish'd, he went down into Wilt∣shire to a famous cloathing town, call'd Bradford, to join the troop, which then was under his command. What hap∣pen'd to him afterwards we shall here∣after treat of, and return to Mr. Dumont and his Lady.</P>
<P>This unfortunate pair by that time they had been married two years, had through losses at play, and unbounded extravagancies in living, reduced the eighteen thousand per annum most shame∣fully; nor was it to be wonder'd at, when neither of them ever set less upon a card than a hundred guineas, half that sum they only call'd piddling with; and as if fate design'd to punish them for their vice, they generally lost ten times to once winning.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="214"/>Poor Mr. Evelyn, who still was anxious for this unthinking gentleman, held private correspondence with a friend who was frequently at Mr. Dumont's, and who was truly concern'd at the melancholly account he was obliged to give him, assuring him that by his method of life, he foresaw inevi∣table ruin gathering fast round him; and was farther grieved to add, that he was changed in many respects from that delicacy of mind which Mr. Eve∣lyn's careful hand had implanted in his infancy, and pruned with skilful tenderness; little imagining his early hopes of virtue would have been so untimely nip'd by folly, to wither in their bloom.</P>
<P>Lady Generous remain'd a stranger to this unhappy marriage, till it was reveal'd to her by reading a maga∣zine: that was a motive for new grief, but when she heard of the de∣clension of his fortune, her eyes were one perpetual stream of sorrow; with some difficulty she prevail'd on her papa to write him a letter of friendly ad∣monition, but he received it with cold∣ness</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Mr. <HI>Powel</HI> meets with unexpected Interviews in the <HI>Indies</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as Mr. Powel arrived, his first business was to enquire after Mr. Jennings, whom he did not see the first time of waiting on him, being inform'd by Mr. Jennings's clerk his master went the day before into the country to the solemnization of his sister in law's wedding, that he would be in town the day following, and if he had any particular business, he was authorised to transact it, equally as if his master were present; then desiring him to walk in, introduced him to a magnificent apartment, which seemed calculated for the reception of an em∣peror. They soon entered into a con∣versation, which confirm'd the report Mr. Evelyn had given Powel of the excellent character of Mr. Jennings, nor was he a little pleased to hear it, on his own cccount, as Mr. Jennings
<PB N="208" REF="216"/>
was the worthy person on whom his future success in a great measure de∣pended, through Mr. Evelyn's inter∣cession.</P>
<P>Mr. Ledger (that was the clerk's name) entertain'd Mr. Powel in a very elegant manner, and as he understood Mrs. Powel and her little ones were also in the colony, dispatch'd a servant with an invitation to them; which Mr. Powel would have evaded, think∣ing it a troublesome incroachment upon a stranger's curtesy; but Mr. Ledger assured him he was bound equally by his master's command and his own in∣clination, to pay the highest respect to all English strangers. The servant soon return'd with Mrs. Powel and her chil∣dren. When they were assembled, they pass'd the remaining part of the day in viewing the house and gardens, and were entertain'd with such hospitable ease and friendly politeness, that both Powel and his wife thought themselves en∣tirely happy. Mr. Ledger gave him Mr. Jennings's history from the time of young Dumont's first seeing him, and the story
<PB N="209" REF="217" MS="y"/>
in all points told so much to his master's honour, he thought it no error to recite it: Mr. Powel in return gave Mr. Ledger his history, with which the good natured man was truly affected, when he heard the calamitous part of it, and promised him as far as his knowledge and advice could be of use to him, to do the utmost in his power to serve him; farther he could not offer, as he was himself but lately relieved from a series of misfortunes, through Mr. Jennings's extensive hu∣manity and benevolence; Mr. Powel thank'd him for the friendly promise he had given; and night drawing on they parted with the highest satisfaction on all sides. And according to appoint∣ment, Mr. Powel next evening waited on Mr. Jennings, who was expected by dinner time; but as his coming was uncertain he was refer'd to the latest hour that he might be sure not to be disappointed.</P>
<P>Next afternoon Mr. Jennings and his Lady return'd, who were inform'd by Mr. Ledger of Mr. Powel's arrival, and deliver'd to him Mr. Evelyn's recom∣mendatory
<PB N="210" REF="218" MS="y"/>
letter which Mr. Powel had left the night before; the pleasing op∣portunity of shewing every grateful sense of Mr. Evelyn's care of Jen∣nings in his minority, raised in his soul a generous impatience to receive and serve his new commended friend. Mr. Ledger was instantly dispatch'd to Mr. Powel, who soon returned with him, and met with such a reception from Mr. Jennings, as confirm'd him in the belief of all he had heard of him from Mr. Evelyn and Mr. Ledger.</P>
<P>After the necessary compliments, Mr. Jennings call'd to his little son, about five years of age, and bid him tell his mama there was a gentleman from England desired to see her; the little well-bred soul, young as it was, made a very genteel bow, and hastened to obey his papa's commands; it is to be remark'd this was Mr. Jennings's first born, and bore as strong a resem∣blance of Lady Generous, as her daugh∣ter did of young Dumont, a plain demonstration that poor Mr. Jennings secretly languish'd with his hopeless passion; even after marriage, though
<PB N="211" REF="219" MS="y"/>
his noble generous nature never suf∣fer'd him to give Mrs. Jennings the least suspicion of the misfortune he labour'd under; but time and the fond regard that lady had for her husband, at last engross'd every tender thought for her, and her alone, insomuch they lived together in an uninterrupted state of conjugal bliss.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jennings soon appear'd, con∣ducted by her son. Mr. Jennings in∣troduced Mr. Powel to this agreeable lady; who going to salute her, they started, and fix'd in astonishment, gazed at each other, expressing by their looks an unusual joy at the interview.</P>
<P>Powel after getting the better of his pleasing surprize, cried out, Good Hea∣ven, is it possible! Do I hold thee once more in these arms? My dear Belina! After such a tedious absence I began to fear you were no more; and little thought to find thee li∣ving in a foreign clime! Mrs. Jen∣nings express'd the effusion of her transport with drops of joy and repeated embraces; which struck Mr. Jennings into the strongest amazement, never
<PB N="212" REF="220" MS="y"/>
having once seen the least familiarity from his wife to any man but himself, and very gravely ask'd Mr. Powel how long he had been acquainted with Mrs. Jennings? Oh Sir, replied Mr. Powel, from infancy, and our loves increased with our years. Alass I thought her dead, but how shall I express my over∣flow of happiness in seeing her, after so many baleful hours of anguish I have felt on her account, least fate might have inflicted miseries on her, as it has lately most severely done on me.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings could not very well tell what to make of all this, till Mr. Powel call'd her sister; upon which Mr. Jennings embraced him with a fraternal tenderness, and was overjoy'd that Providence had so fortunately put it in his power to give fresh proofs of his fondness to Mrs. Jennings, by paying all due regard to the person and interest of so near a relation.</P>
<P>An apartment was immediately or∣der'd for Mr. Powel and family in Mr. Jennings's own house till a proper settlement could be found for him, which
<PB N="213" REF="221" MS="y"/>
was soon after accomplish'd; it hap∣pening that a factor died in a short time after, and he was settled by his brother in law in the house of the de∣ceased, and by a large present from him, enabled him to carry on the bu∣siness.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel was very desirous to see his youngest sister, whom he under∣stood by Mr. Ledger was married the day before. Mr. Jennings, though he was but just come from the new mar∣ried pair, would not protract the bro∣ther's joy of seeing his other sister, and made a journey for that purpose the next day, to visit Mrs. Leicester who had married an English gentleman, that had resided but a very few years in that country, but by an industrious improve∣ment of a little fortune, and gaining by his behaviour an universal esteem, made himself master of ten thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Mrs. Leicester was no less pleased at the unexpected sight of her brother, than Mrs. Jennings had been; but now rea∣der judge the strong confusion and surprize both of Mr. Powel and Mr. Lei∣cester,
<PB N="214" REF="222"/>
who proved to be the very man that had defrauded him of the 400 <HI>l.</HI> and was the cruel author of all poor Powel's sufferings; the money he rob∣bed him of was the means of his ad∣vancement in the Indies, whilst the other was pining with famine and de∣spair in a loathsome jail in England.</P>
<P>When these two persons met they both changed countenance, Powel with rage, redned and darted his eyes like an offended tyger, while the other turn∣ed pale, from the result of conscious guilt, and whose whole mass of blood retreated to his heart, both remain∣ing speechless and immoveable. This visible confusion put all the company in a most profound consternation. Mr. Jennings asking Mrs. Powel if she could explain this riddle, she told him yes; by which time Mr. Powel who perceived her to be going to open the affair, prevented her, by winking at her, resolving within himself to take different measures in the conduct of this business than what Leicester expect∣ed he would have done, who from the strong impulse of shame, surprize, and
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>
anguish of mind, fainted quite away, which gave a general concern to all, but most especially the bride, who threw herself prostrate on her husband, con∣cluding him to be gone for ever; but by proper assistance he recover'd, and desired for a few moments to be left alone with Mr. Powel.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings at this request took all the company into the garden, who remain'd in strange confusion; the ladies most especially were curious to know, and began to question Mrs. Powel, as they fear'd something wrong on Mr. Leicester's part; but her husband's hint was a sufficient excuse for her decli∣ning to give the least account; nor would Mr. Jennings permit them to make any farther enquiry. When they were all gone Mr. Leicester thus ad∣dressed Mr. Powel.</P>
<P><Q>“Thou much injured man! I am but too sensible neither words or deeds can make you the least amends for the horrid and barbarous villainies I have committed against you; and though Providence has crown'd me with success in the use of the cruel
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>
spoils of your wreck'd fortune, I assure you I have ever felt a secret terror, even in the acquisition of all that seeming happiness I am now possess'd of; nor did I ever know a moment's peace till an unbounded fondness for your sister, relieved my thoughts, which were before employ'd in the most painful reflections on that shameful and inhuman treatment of your generous friendship. I know myself in your power, nor shall I intreat you to foregoe a proper and justifiable use of it on my own ac∣count, but to avoid the agonizing grief your sister (whom more than life I love) must consequently feel on a publick process against me. I here offer you my sword and ready bosom to take such a revenge as your just resentment shall th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk pro∣per; and though I fear my death might occasion that of my unhappy wife, yet let me beg of you not to load her sorrow with that scandalous reproach the world would throw upon her should your justice inflict that ”punishment I most truly deserve.</Q>
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>
No, answer'd Mr. Powel, I am far from any such intent, and on my sister's ac∣count will promise to conceal your cruel return of my friendly assistance; and shall only put this matter upon the footing of a debt of considerable consequence, as they will naturally make some farther enquiry into what passed between us; and hope this lenity will induce you to redouble and make a lasting continuance of that fondness you avow for poor Harriet whom I find you have espoused. And now Mr. Liecester let us embrace as friends and brothers, and when you are at leisure let me know (for I am certain you are a gentleman) what induced you to throw so apparent a blemish on that character. Mr. Leicester promised he would; then stepping to an inner room return'd with bills to the amount of a thousand pounds, which he beg'd his brother to accept on in part to∣wards an amends for the wrongs he had done him.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel very thankfully received them, but when he related that thro' Mr. Liecester's means he had been
<PB N="218" REF="226"/>
exposed to the bitterness of want in a prison, and that his wife and chil∣dren had been in a perishing condi∣tion; he was so dreadfully shock'd at the recital, he wanted power to express the tender concern he felt on that ac∣count, but shew'd it by pressing his brother close to his bosom, and vented his sorrow and contrition by a very hearty flood of penitential tears.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings who was quite in the dark about this business, and very un∣easy till he got some information con∣cerning it, slip'd away from the ladies to join the gentlemens company, when he found Mr. Leicester had been in tears, and a fixed melancholy in his face, fondly requested to be ac∣quainted with the cause, as he was ready, if any thing in his power could mitigate the affair between them, to put it in immediate execution.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel, to stop any further en∣quiry, told Mr. Jennings that Mr. Lei∣cester had formerly used him ill in an affair of very great consequence, by witholding from him a considerable sum, which had exposed him even to want
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>
and a prison; and knowing Mr. Lei∣cester founded his fortune on his ruin, seeing him so unexpected and unpre∣pared, threw himself into a rage, which he begg'd Mr. Jennings's pardon for, telling him the matter was entirely made up by an ample amends from his brother in law; and that all that was past should be forgot on his side, expressing an earnest desire to live in a lasting friendship with him, as a brother and a friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings was highly pleased to find the matter was accommodated, and went to fetch the ladies, who were equally delighted on that account; when the two brothers in law were left alone the second time, Mr. Lie∣cester took that opportunity to express how much he thought himself obliged to Mr. Powel's uncommon generosity, and promised to give him every con∣vincing proof by promoting his interest, and which he forwarded with the ut∣most expedition, making him, thro' his means, in two years time, a five thousand pound man, clear of all in∣cumbrances. When the company re∣turn'd
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>
they mutually congratulated each other on their alliances, and a happy end of the dispute that had subsisted be∣tween the two gentlemen. They passed that night at Mr. Leicester's; the next day he and his bride set out with the rest to Mr. Jennings's seat, where they finish'd the usual rejoicings at great wed∣dings. In about a fortnight's time Mr. Jennings and Mr. Leicester undertook Mr. Powel's settlement, in which Mr. Leicester was most particularly assiduous, never thinking it possible for him to make Mr. Powel amends, either for the wrongs he had done him, or for the generous concealment of so brutal a crime.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Mr. <HI>Powel</HI> is settled. Mr. <HI>Leicester</HI> gives him a short Account of him∣self and family. A rich Planter dies, and <HI>Powel</HI> purchases a large Part of his Effects. Mr. <HI>Jennings</HI> meets with a violent Shock. His Behaviour on that Account.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Jennings, and Mr. Leicester spared neither pains nor cost to effect Mr. Powel's business, in a very short time; the former excited to it from the recommendation of Mr. Eve∣lyn, as well as from the regard he had to him from being his brother in law; and the other impell'd by a strong de∣sire to make him the utmost amends within his power; for the foremention'd reasons, Mr. Powel very soon became a man of note in the place, and in∣structed by his brother Jennings, who was one of the greatest and richest mer∣chants there, he made so considerable
<PB N="222" REF="230"/>
a progress, that he was worth several thousand pounds in a few years.</P>
<P>One day, as Mr. Leicester and he were walking in a grove, that belonged to Powel's estate, he reminded him of the promise he made him of his history, which the other began as follows.</P>
<P>You may remember, said Leicester, that I told you I was at law for an estate of five hundred a year; 'tis true I was, but I was at that time defending a very bad cause, for I had taken pos∣session of my mother's jointure, which fell to my elder brother by her death, while he was in the East Indies; and by an extravagant course of life, had a great deal impair'd it, mortgaging some of the land belonging thereto; and had he not come over as he did, 'tis possible from the riotous life I led, devoting myself too much to the ladies and the bottle, the whole might have been e∣qually incumbred. I took care not to let him know my mother was dead, nor did he ever get the least information of it, till he came to England; at which time, finding me obstinately, and I may say insolently resolved, to withold his
<PB N="223" REF="231"/>
right from him, he commenced a law-suit in which I was soon cast▪ and having run thro' the fortune my father bequeath'd me five years before, I was drove to my wits end to know which way I was to subsist; never having been bred to any business, and acquiring an idle way of thinking from the ill examples of my associates, I ran very much in debt, and at the time I so shamefully and cruelly wrong'd your friendship, I was under an arrest for two hundred and fifty pounds, but by virtue of the last five guineas I was master of, the officer set me at large for two days; and knowing a prison for life, must have been the consequence of my surrendring, I emboldened my spirits with drinking, to perpetrate the horrid design I put in force against you and your unhappy family; paid the debt, and went on board an India-man with the remaining part of the cash, without considering what I should do when I arrived here; till luckily fal∣ling into the worthy acquaintance of Mr. Jennings, whose powerful exam∣ples of honour and virtue made such
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>
an impression on my mind, I was de∣termined no longer to pursue the tract of villainy; and heartily repenting of my crime, I found the superior force of innocence hourly gaining ground; and what considerably added to my conversion, was the conception of the most tender and honourable passion for my dearest Harriot; whom more than life I love. Her amiable dispo∣sition softened me into every noble sen∣timent of honour supported with hu∣manity; and set my past crimes before me in so just a light, as made me hate the reflection of my guilt, and fixed me everlastingly a friend to virtue.</P>
<P>The only torment of my life, was the dreadful imagination of what you suffered; but the terror of my guilt being disclosed, by advertizing where I was, and the uncertainty of your not taking a just revenge, made me foregoe any design of enquiring after you. And had not providence so happily cast you on our shore, that circum∣stance must still have embittered the sweets of life; which through Hea∣ven's and your forgiveness, I hope
<PB N="225" REF="233"/>
we shall ever enjoy. And be assured, my dear friend and brother, I look upon no part of my estate my own, when ever your interest demands it.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel's good nature had long since forgiven the injury, and as a convincing proof that he desired also to forget it, he enjoined his brother never more to give the least hint of what had passed; declaring, that he was made ample amends in the won∣drous turns of providence on his side, and received an additional and un∣speakable happiness in Mr. Leicester's conversion.</P>
<P>It happened that one of the richest black planters died, who leaving only a widow behind him, and she being advanced in years, resolved to sell the plantation and a numerous stock of slaves, and retire from business. Accordingly a sale was advertised, and among the rest of the gentlemen, Mr. Jennings, Mr. Leicester, and Mr. Powel, went to make purchases of the goods; as to slaves, Mr. Jennings ne∣ver would deal that way, being of too tender a disposition to inflict the
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>
heavy grievances and burdens lie often saw his fellow creatures un∣dergoe. However, he went into the gardens with the rest of the company, where these unhappy wretches were employed in dreadful tasks in the ex∣tremity of the sultry heat, frequently receiving cruel stripes from the mer∣ciless hands of their overseers.</P>
<P>But what must be his confusion and surprize, when among the number of these miserable objects, he saw his own uncle, who had formerly abandon∣ed him to the utmost wretchedness, had not Providence sent young Du∣mont to his relief. Yet notwithstand∣ing his barbarity, Mr. Jennings felt all the tender emotions of heart for his misfortune, as if he had never wronged him; and immediately en∣quired into the cause of his arrival there, not owning him farther than one he had seen in England, and was sorry for his unhappy mis-manage∣ment, which had reduced the laws to a necessity of exposing his age, (he being pretty elderly) to such hard∣ships.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="235"/>When he came to speak to him, Mr. Jennings found he had entirely out∣grown his knowledge; nor did he in∣tend to reveal himself, till upon que∣stioning him, he found he was likely ever to be worthy of such a disco∣very.</P>
<P>When this worthy gentleman ac∣costed him, his humanity was so touched, he had scarce power to speak; nor was his honest soul less affected with inward shame, to think that a∣ny one so nearly related to him, was capable of deserving such a punish∣ment. But when he was informed the cause proceeded from his attempt to rob the late noble and illustrious Count Destrades; his grief and confusion was not to be described; nor could he bear the reflection of an injury intended from any part of his fami∣ly to his worthy benefactor. And in a letter to Mr. Evelyn, which he sent soon after on that occasion, he suffi∣ciently testified the concern he felt on that account; however, he had the satisfaction of letting him know at the same time, that upon his discover∣ing
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
himself to his uncle; (whom he had purchased from the widow) it had so happy an effect on the old man, that he grew penitent; and from Mr. Jennings's generous usage, (from whom he had no right to ex∣pect the least glimmering hope of mercy) he became the reverse of what he had been; confessing his crimes, with an utter abhorrence of the re∣membrance of 'em, and in the hum∣blest manner implored his nephew's pardon; who not only gave him his freedom, but settled him some few miles distant from him. He lived two years only, leading a life of contri∣tion, and died a perfect convert to religion's truth and purest laws.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> receives a Letter from Mr. <HI>Allworth,</HI> the Contents give him great Concern. A short Ac∣count of Mr. <HI>Allworth</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Evelyn was extreamly pleas'd at the account Mr. Jennings gave of the happy issue of his uncle's affair, and highly applauded his forgiving nature, and godlike disposition; Lady Generous and Mrs. Evelyn were equally delighted with the virtues of this worthy gentle∣man, nor could they refrain from tears, when they reflected on his sufferings in regard to his passion for Lady Gene∣rous; who strongly sympathized with him in the pains she endured from her fondness of young Dumont.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn answer'd his letter, with fresh assurances of the sincerest friendship, and hearty congratulation for his success in merchandize; he had scarce finish'd Mr. Jennings's epistle, before the post stopt at the gate, with one from Mr.
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
Allworth, who was the gentleman Mr. Evelyn enjoyn'd to have a watchful eye upon Mr. Dumont, and notwithstanding the coldness arising from Dumont's un∣expected turn of behaviour, he could not help feeling the secret tenderness which offended parents often do, when head∣strong children precipitately rush into follies which not only destroy their own happiness, but terribly corrode that of the afflicted father and suffering mo∣ther.</P>
<P>Such was the case with Mr. Evelyn, who having been acquainted in his youth with Mr. Allworth, and proved him to be a gentleman of honour and strictest integrity, he depended on his friendly and secret correspondence to inform him of every unhappy step he foresaw Mr. Dumont was going to take.</P>
<P>I must beg leave to let the reader know, that Mr. Allworth was a Gentle∣man of an ancient family, but being a younger brother, his father had it only in his power to leave him 2000l. which with difficulty he had scraped toge∣ther for him; this gentleman had a libe∣ral education, and nature having fur∣nished
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>
him with sound judgment and sprightly wit, he was universally ad∣mired and caressed, which led him into a general acquaintance with all the po∣lite and sensible part of the town; and happy were they, who could first se∣cure him for all parties of pleasure. Being perfectly well bred, and ever∣lastingly good humour'd, he wisely con∣sidered that the smallness of his income, was inferior to the dignity of his edu∣cation; and as he was above the mean∣ness of being a fortune hunter, remain'd a batchelor, nor would he stoop to marry any one below him in birth, and help to people the world with genteel beg∣gars.</P>
<P>This resolution empowered him to live easy to himself, and ever agree∣able to his friends; among whom was the Count Destrades, having been in∣troduced by Mr. Evelyn there a few months before that nobleman's decease; in conformity to Mr. Evelyn's request, he sent the following account of Mr. Dumont.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="232" REF="240" MS="y"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry to send my dear and wor∣thy friend such an account, as I am sensible must throw him into many melancholly reflections, but as you have laid the injunction on me, I think it en∣tirely consistent with that friendship which has for years subsisted between us to be comformable to your request, and wish it were not in my power to inform you, that poor Mr. Dumont seems to ride post on the back of misfortune; which he presses forward beyond her common speed: those noble sentiments and shining virtues, which nature be∣stow'd, and your care so transcendently improved, are all lost in a labyrinth of love for a thoughtless woman: Were she an ideot, I should not be surprized at the daily follies she commits: In her intervals of madness for gaming, she appears a reasonable and sensible crea∣ture; yet her infatuation is so strong, that insisting on my staying dinner, she very gravely told me dice was just coming up, and beg'd me to stay and
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
eat a bit with them; I smiling replied, I never attempted to make a meal of that sort but once; and found them of so very indigestive a nature, I never car'd for them since. My reply made her sensible of her mistake: upon which, I took the opportunity to tell her how narrowly I escaped the ruin of my small fortune in my younger days, by falling into the hands of sharpers; and enter∣taining a fondness for play, which you my good friend, by your timely cautions soon broke me of; and 'tis to your superior virtue, I now think myself indebted, for the happiness I enjoy in the preservation of my income, and secluding me from the association of the most villainous part of mankind. Believe me, dear sir, 'tis with astonish∣ment I behold a daily concourse of people assemble themselves with a pre∣meditated design, like so many Savages to prey upon one another; yet shake hands, and embrace, call each other friend, when at the same time, they meet with a barbarous intent of robbing each other of the means of life; which I think falls but one step short of a devastation
<PB N="234" REF="242" MS="y"/>
of life itself; and in my opinion would prove the gentler evil of the two.</P>
<P>I have so far ingratiated myself into the favour of our unhappy friend and his lady, as to be appointed master of the ceremonies at their assembly, which they hold twice a week; and my rules are as punctually observed, as those of the worthy old Beau at Bath; who has for a successive roll of years been their chief arbiter at those polite-assemblies. The first use I made of my power, was to abolish that unnatural custom in pa∣rents, of introducing their sons and daughters, whose ages perhaps did not exceed nine or ten years; and were made intimate acquaintance with Basto Ponto and Ames Ace, and at the same time absolute strangers to their alphabet. This I regard as a most unpardonable cruelty, to lead unwary youth into in∣evitable dilemmas which were so easily avoided; I resolved to put an end to it, by making it a rule that no person should be admitted there under the age of twenty five: and I wish I could as ea∣sily extirpate the race of embroider'd sharpers; to which, I hourly see Mr.
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>
Dumont a most insufferable dupe. I must needs confess, I think it incumbent on our legislature to scrutinize into that affair, and endeavour to obtain an act of parliament, to prevent the proper ornaments of nobility becoming the scandalous concealment of theft and ra∣pine; a scoundrel has it in his power by giving half a guinea, for the hire of a rich suit in Monmouth street, to ruin whole families: and as there have been so many instances, of the perpetration of many horrid designs in those glaring appearances, 'tis needless to expatiate on them farther; but I am apt to believe, if it were made felony to wear lace and embroidery without any real pretensions to it by birth and fortune, it would be the happy means of preventing the ruin of thousands.</P>
<P>In the reign of Edward the III. every person dress'd agreeable to their condi∣tion; and were that law again in force, we should not be so liable to the fore∣mentioned evils, but less pester'd with a croud of pragmatical coxcombs, who because they dress like gentlemen fancy themselves so; when at the same time,
<PB N="236" REF="244"/>
their utmost merit consists in being broken attornies, or barber's appren∣tices.</P>
<P>Pardon me, dear Sir, for taking up so much of your time with these re∣marks; but as they bear some analogy with the characters of those wretches whose hands Mr. Dumont is fallen into, I shall I hope stand excused, and intreat you to employ your thoughts with mine, to find out some expedient e're it be too late to prevent the ruin he pursues. I am sorry to add farther, that night is now turned into day, and many of the servants who are often obliged to be strangers to their beds five or six nights and days successively, have given warn∣ing on account of their healths, which these irregularities have considerably im∣pair'd. The porter indeed who finds the advantageous sweets of his place, has hired a deputy; but those who pay their attendance in other lights, have not so favourable an opportunity. When I ap∣point to wait on him at breakfast, I never attempt going till tea time in the after∣noon, by which hour I am sure to find them drinking their morning chocolate,

<P>Last night the beautiful seat at Iver was the melancholy sacrifice to a set of loaded dice; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eloniously ravaged from its owner, by one of the most execrable villains in town; and I confess my trem∣bling heart beats thick for the danger of those noble structures at Versailles and Fontainbleau; I have formed a design to save them if possible, and if needful will put it in execution.

<P><PB N="238" REF="246"/>Any person who ever felt the natural impulses of parental tenderness, friendly sorrow, and grateful sensations, may without much trouble inform themselves of the terror of Mr. Evelyn's heart, which this epistle must consequently occasion. However, he resolved not to let the grandson of his generous patron fall a victim if possible to those blood∣sucking villains, who were daily feeding on his vital life.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding his former determi∣nation of never seeing young Dumont more on his scornful contemptuous be∣haviour to him, when his fatherly and friendly advice was offer'd to prevent his marriage, which he foresaw too plainly would end in his destruction; he com∣municated his mind to Mrs. Evelyn, who in all the occurrences of life was his faithful adviser, but did not dare give the smallest hint to lady Generous, whom he still perceived to languish with a hope∣less passion, which was discover'd by the frequent lonely and melancholy retreats she made, and has been found weeping both by her fond parents and little daughter, who was come to an age to
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>
distinguish so far as without knowing the cause, to partake in any sorrow she saw her dear Mama involved in.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn proposed her husband's going to London and paying Mr. Du∣mont a visit, but he declined it, ra∣ther chusing to depend on Mr. All∣worth's letters, which he knew would give him proper instructions how to proceed; and as there was a kind of breach subsisting, he imagined Mr. Du∣mont would only look on him as an interloping busy medler, which would rather widen it still more, and by that means deprive him of the power of being his friend when he should stand in most need of him; he therefore concluded at that time to answer Mr. Allworth's letter, which he did by the first post, as follows,
<LETTER>

<P>I AM certain your good sense will na∣turally conceive the torture my mind endures, from the terrible account you give of the poor, unhappy, beloved Du∣mont;

for Heaven's sake, prevent his ruin if possible. I believe I shall soon be in London, for I have half prevail'd on my melancholy child to leave this (though a noble, yet) gloomy retreat. The painful apprehensions I hourly labour under lest I should lose her, have enforced me to blend my parental fondness, with my positive command to be obey'd; her fear of offending, I believe, will gain my point.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Mr. Allworth was highly delighted at the thoughts of seeing his worthy friend again, and more especially so, as it was likely to be the happy means of pre∣venting the total ruin of this unfor∣tunate gentleman. But alas! his lady
<PB N="241" REF="249" MS="y"/>
ran to such excesses, that before Mr. Evelyn could possibly take his intend∣ed journey, he was absolutely undone. At the very last assembly that was held at his house, there came in two well dress'd strangers, whom Mr. All∣worth took but little notice of, and as Mr. Dumont, to oblige his lady, had made it a general rule to enter∣tain any person who made a genteel appearance, they were permitted to play, and in less than three hours, made themselves masters of every shil∣ling he was worth in the world. Mrs. Dumont continued playing till she had strip'd herself of her watch and jewels, with the hopes of redeeming all again, but in vain! All was lost, and they were obliged next day to quit the house, and by virtue of the writings of the estate deliver'd by Mr. Dumont, these two persons took immediate pos∣session. Mr. Allworth's humanity pro∣vided Mr. Dumont an apartment, and supplied him with cash, as far as his circumstances would admit; but Mrs. Dumont, from the shock of this dreadful catastrophe, took so immoderately to
<PB N="242" REF="250"/>
drinking, that in about three months time she died raving mad.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Evelyn at that time fell into a violent fever, which retarded their journey till her death; which misfortune made her disconsolate husband persist more strenuously for his daughter's coming to London, not being able to bear the place where he had sustain'd such a real loss. Lady Generous was not less concern'd, and readily obey'd her father's will, setting forward with the utmost expedition, after her dear mo∣ther's interment.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont, notwithstanding he owed his ruin to his wife, was most ten∣derly affected at her decease; and for some time, from the reflection of the unhappy misconduct on both sides, fell into a deep melancholy, and as a farther addi∣tion to his distress, he received news of his brother-in-law (who was ever a disaffected person) having joined the rebels, suf∣fer'd a publick ignominious death, which every LOYAL HEART MUST THINK HIS TREASON JUSTLY DESERVED. Thus were, through the height of excessive in∣discretions, and the immoderate pursuit
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
of follies, two persons lost to the world and themselves, and a noble youth terribly involved in their ruin, each of whom might otherwise have been shining ornaments of the present age.</P>
<P>As I before hinted to the reader, Mr. Evelyn and Lady Generous in about three months space came to town, with a design to settle in it for life.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth joyfully received his friend, who desired Mr. Dumont might remain a stranger to his arrival for some time; well knowing that a sudden sur∣prize to a melancholy mind, might possibly be attended with dreadful con∣sequences. And as Dumont was con∣scious that he had wrong'd Mr. Evelyn's friendship, which he often express'd infinite concern for to Mr. Allworth; it was concluded, by slow degrees and gentle means, to make the discovery.</P>
<P>Lady Generous and her papa resided at her ladyship's town house near St. James's; and though that amiable worthy creature's heart still felt the ago∣nizing pain of separation from the di∣stressed object of her wishes; she never once attempted at a proposition to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
<PB N="244" REF="252"/>
father for an interview, positively re∣solving to be rather a sacrifice to the utmost dignity of virtue than betray a weakness that should put her on the common level of too many of her sex.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Dumont's misfortunes, had so far deprived him of that noble sense he was once master of, that one day, taking a melancholly walk, without very well knowing where he should steer his course, he stray'd (unknown to Mr. Allworth) as far as Brentford; and hearing a drum beat up for volun∣teers, forgetful of himself, directly listed; his height, and beautiful person, attracted every eye with pleasure and surprize. The serjeant that enlisted him, found he had no common person in his power, and joyful at his success, took coach, and went to Kensington, where his Colonel lodged; who was equally pleased at what the serjeant had done, and went with him to the first justice of peace to have him imme∣diately attested; strictly charging the serjeant, to take him directly to the Savoy, and keep him close confined,
<PB N="245" REF="253"/>
till they had orders to sail; (the regiment being soon to go abroad) but with this caution, to treat him with the utmost respect, as he was a gentleman, and in compassion to his indisposition, plainly perceiving he had a fever, attended with a terrible low∣ness of spirits, tho' ignorant from whence it proceeded, nor was it his business to enquire.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont underwent a violent indisposition in the Savoy, and as the Colonel was charmed with his appearance, took care to let him want for nothing but the use of a pen and ink, which was a dreadful motive of sorrow to poor Mr. Evelyn, and his friend Allworth; who not having heard of him for some weeks, con∣cluded he had rashly destroyed him∣self; and tho' they advertised him, no tidings could be gain'd. And both these gentlemen made it their daily business to go in quest of him, but to no purpose. At length there came an order (a peace being concluded) to draught out several men, and place those approved of in the guards, the
<PB N="246" REF="254"/>
others were discharged accordingly.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was one of those whom they were proud to keep; and di¦rectly stationed in the first regiment. When he was at large, shame would not permit him to let his friend All∣worth know in what situation he was in; only directing a line to him, to signify that he was alive, and much better in health than he had been for some time; that if he could re∣concile it to himself patiently, to en∣dure his concealment a little longer, and forgive his abrupt departure, he should hear farther from him; but re∣quired no answer, being resolved (at that time) not to make any farther dis∣covery.</P>
<P>This epistle reached Mr. Allworth by the penny post, which rendered it impossible to make an enquiry concern∣ing him. Mr. Evelyn was soon ac∣quainted with the contents, and tho' ex∣cessively uneasy, both he and Mr. Allworth were obliged to rest satisfied, till Mr. Dumont thought proper to give them farther information; not that he knew Mr. Evelyn was in town,
<PB N="247" REF="255"/>
nor did that worthy gentleman inform his daughter of what had befallen their lamented, unhappy friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth being let into the se∣cret of Lady Generous's melancholly, advised her papa, to persuade her as much as possible, to partake of all the polite and fashionable entertain∣ment the town afforded; and with much difficulty they prevailed on her to go to the Opera; which as her lady∣ship was a very great proficient in mu∣sick, she preferred to a play. Accord∣ingly Mr. Allworth and her papa, with a young lady, accompanied her thither, and sat in one of the stage boxes.</P>
<P>Lady Generous, notwithstanding all the grief she had for years sustained, still preserved every native charm, and struck the eye of each behold∣er with a most pleasing astonishment; but what was most surprizing, on her seating herself in the box, the poor centinel, who was upon guard just by it, suddenly starting, dropped his piece on the stage, and stooping to recover it, was obliged to make a nearer approach; by which means,
<PB N="248" REF="256"/>
that company discovered it was the un∣happy Dumont; whom we may easily conceive, to suffer all the shock and terror a great mind must on such an oc∣casion be susceptible of. Poor Lady Gene∣rous was carried off for dead, whom as soon as she was conducted home, Mr. Allworth left, and returned to the opera, but found a fresh guard to supply Du∣mont's place, who was render'd thro' his confusion, and surprize, incapable of performing the duty of the night.</P>
<P>When Mr. Allworth miss'd him on the stage, he ask'd the serjeant what was become of him, who inform'd him he was sent to his quarters speechless; and not knowing the cause, could give no other account than that he was thought to be taken with an apoplectick fit; upon which this worthy gentleman gave the honest soldier a crown, to let him know where the poor fellow (as he thought proper to term him) was to be found; he was no sooner informed, than with the most friendly expedition, he sought him out, and had him carefully placed in a hackney-chair, and convey'd to his own house; it is true, he had re∣cover'd
<PB N="249" REF="257" MS="y"/>
his senses, but was so extreamly ill, Mr. Allworth thought proper to have him put to bed, and sent for one of the best physicians in town, who attended him all that night.</P>
<P>Next morning, Mr. Evelyn came to wait on him, when after having been properly prepair'd for the interview by Mr. Allworth, these long parted friends met, embrac'd, and with the moving eloquence of silent tears alone renew'd their former friendship. A farther de∣scription is needless on this occasion, as every generous mind must naturally bear a part in the pleasing anguish, each must feel on so extraordinary an event.</P>
<P>As soon as they were capable of con∣versing, Mr. Evelyn beg'd Mr. Dumont to be entirely conformable to the skill and care of his physician, in regard to his health: adding, that he was very certain providence had still many blessings in store for him; which if he made a pro∣per use of, would compensate for all the sorrows he had undergone thro' his mis∣taken fondness for Mrs. Dumont. Here the afflicted gentleman stopt him, beg∣ging him never to mention her again;
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>
adding, that he did not chuse to expa∣tiate on that subject, he could only con∣fess his folly, and implore his pardon for the insolent disregard he paid his friend∣ship, which was so anxiously employ'd to have saved him from destruction.</P>
<P>He then changed the discourse, by a friendly enquiry after Lady Generous; whom he saw carried in a chair from the box to her coach; dreading an ac∣count, least it should end in an infor∣mation of her being in danger: but her papa eas'd him of that fear, assuring him, that he had great hopes of her recovery; and that as soon as she could receive company, and he was able to go abroad, intreated him to favour her with a visit. What, said Dumont, favour a noble Lady with a visit from a poor soldier? No! that honour—Here Mr. Evelyn in∣terrupted his farther speech, beseeching him to consider himself the man he real∣ly was, and to think of this strange vicis∣situde of fortune, ordain'd by Heaven, as a gentle punishment for having desert∣ed those manifold virtues it endow'd him with; and which the same providen∣tial care would give him power to resume,
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>
and overcome the torrent of distresses that had overwhelm'd him.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth's friendly care was employ'd in attending Mr. Dumont till his recovery, while Mr. Evelyn was equally assiduous in gaining his discharge; which, as he was cautious in exposing a noble family, by not confessing who he was, he found impracticable, and was at last, reduced to a necessity of doing it to effect his purpose. When that was ac∣complish'd, Mr. Evelyn brought the discharge, which Mr. Dumont thank∣fully received; telling him, that if he had but prudently left himself as much as would have purchas'd a commission, he should have been both ready and willing to have employ'd the remaining part of life in the service of his country: but now alass! I have nothing to depend on, but the hopes and certainty of dying, to rid myself of those sorrows my follies have deservedly inflicted. That, sir, can never be, answered Mr. Evelyn, while these writings are in force, which intitled me to a genteel revenue from your wor∣thy Grandsire, and are no longer mine, since your necessity, and my own gra∣titude,
<PB N="252" REF="260" MS="y"/>
demand a restoration, where they are so amply due. Mr. Dumont re∣ceived the generous and grateful design with that nobleness of soul was ever natural to him; but on no terms could be prevail'd on to accept the writings; which notwithstanding his positive refu∣sal, Mr. Evelyn privately left in the hands of Mr. Allworth, and for that time took leave till next day; bringing with him, a friendly, and indeed a grateful invitation from his worthy daughter, in∣sisting by their former friendship, that he would accept her father's offer; and also one from herself, which was sent in bank notes, to the amount of ten thousand pounds; entreating him, not to be offend∣ed, as she thought he had a more na∣tural right to it than herself; it be∣ing the happy effect of the generous Count's benevolence bestow'd on her infancy.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe the torrent of joy flowing round the heart of this late unfortunate gentleman, who not∣withstanding his poverty still persisted in a refusal of their offers. Mr. Evelyn
<PB N="253" REF="261" MS="y"/>
having resolved within himself, with∣out his daughter's knowledge, to make them both happy, proposed a treaty of marriage; which he also rejected, though in a modest sensible manner; answering Mr. Evelyn, that the only objection he had was, that as blind for∣tune had so cruelly misled him when in the height of affluence, he would not pay so ill a compliment, to bring a beggar to her arms; adding, that could time and circumstances be re∣call'd, he should have been indeed a happy man, had Lady Generous and he conceived a tender passion for each other at the time Sir John paid his addresses to that valuable creature. Upon which Mr. Evelyn began to unfold the secret of his daughter's love, positively affirming, that her whole soul had been entirely devoted to him from the age of fifteen, and was the sad motive of that grief, she even to the present mo∣ment suffer'd; and that her delicacy of disposition had made her a virtuous sacrifice to the nicest rules of modesty and honour, and that she was entirely ignorant of the discovery he had made;
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
but was determined to let him know it, to prevent his suffering the loss of so deserving a child.</P>
<P>This recital gave poor Dumont the tend'rest emotions of heart, and a tran∣sport appear'd in his countenance, which great souls alone are capable of feeling, blended with a generous pity and soft concern for the afflicted lady; yet still he urged his want of fortune, which would, should he pay his addresses, make him appear rather a mercenary than a grateful lover.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth soon gave him proof of his not being that indigent person he conceived himself, restoring to him the writings of his estate, which he in madness deliver'd to the two strangers whom he thought had lawfully possess'd themselves of it; but Sir, said he, as I perceived the danger of your ruin, I artfully prevented it, by procuring two worthy friends, whom I could entrust for once, if I may be allow'd the phrase, to be guilty of an honest fraud, with loaded dice, a whole fortune fell into their hands, from the result of your di∣stracted mind; the writings which you
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>
hastily gave to them were secretly de∣liver'd to me, which with unbounded transport I now restore, and have ever since I had the honour, Sir, of being through my friend Evelyn's means, in your family, been secretly and industri∣ously employ'd in taking care of your affairs, all which are retrievable. One thing I must add, Sir, though Mr. Eve∣lyn needs no addition to his character; this was a secret even to him, therefore you may be assured his offer of his daugh∣ter was entirely disinterested. Oh Sir, replied Dumont, who had scarce power of utterance, Mr. Evelyn's merit can only be equal'd by my worthy grandsire, who as far surpassed all others, as Heaven is superior to the earth; there is but one more who can vie with them, which is your worthy self, whose meritorious act of friendship, I shall think poorly rewarded in the acceptance of five hun∣dred pounds a year during life, and a grateful donation to the friends he em∣ploy'd. All matters being properly adjusted, Mr. Evelyn went home and prepared Lady Generous to her ine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pressible surprize and joy to receive Mr.
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>
Dumont for a husband; in a few days their nuptials were publickly solemnized at St. Paul's cathedral, and was the bless'd means of restoration of peace and fortune to this worthy pair.</P>
<P>Not long after this happy union, Mr. Jennings came to England with his fa∣mily, consisting only of his lady and son, exclusive of servants, among whom was Mr. Ledger, his clerk, whose fidelity in that office entitled him to his master's friendship during life. Mr. and Mrs. Leicester were both dead, that gentle∣man not being able to overcome the shocking reflection of the wrongs Mr. Powel had sustain'd, fell into a decay which carried him off, and his wife soon fol∣low'd from the result of a tender affection, which render'd it impossible for her to support his loss; as they died without issue, Mr. Powel was made his heir, which happy bequest added many thou∣sand pounds to his fortune; his two sons were grown up, and as the father had more than a sufficient competence, were jointly concern'd in the trade the father had successfully carried on for some years, each marrying two of the greatest for∣tunes
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>
in the colony, and lived to be the happy instruments of good to several who from their great humanity avoided many sorrows they might have been other∣wise exposed to.</P>
<P>I need not tire the reader's patience in a description of the interview of Mr. Dumont's and Mr. Jennings's family, that must be naturally and easily con∣ceived: I shall only beg leave to inform them that at first sight Master Jennings and Miss Generous mutually conceived a fond regard, which when they both came of age, was rewarded by a happy marriage; and they are now, without ex∣ception, the greatest examples of con∣stancy and virtue to all who enter into a connubial state; whilst the parents on both sides are bless'd with the injoyment of their little prattling offspring to com∣fort them in age, and more than make amends for past afflictions.</P>
