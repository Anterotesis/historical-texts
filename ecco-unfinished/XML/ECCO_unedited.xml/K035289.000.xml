<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not any dramatic entertain∣ment more frequently performed on the theatre at Paris, than the Oracle of Monsieur St. Foix; an author, for delicacy, and purity of style, allowed, by all good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udges, to be one of the best in the French language: and, to say the truth, the constant applause with which the Public have favoured this piece of his, ap∣pears to be little less than what is justly due to its merit; since nothing can be prettier than the idea on which it is founded; or more happily executed, than the character of the girl; in whom love, as the simple production of Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, is drawn in the most lively and charming colours.</P>
<P>UNDER these circumstances, I was always much surprised at the little success it met with upon the English stage. Mrs. Cibber's transla∣tion of it was excellent; and the performance of that incomparable actress, in the first representa∣tions, gave it additional lustre. But I imagine, the character of the Fairy, a legendary being, very different in England from what it is in France, threw upon it an air of childishness.
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
This, I hope, may, in some measure, be reme∣died by the introduction of a Magician: and the present taste of the town favouring the at∣tempt; I thought, by the addition of music, to which the subject seems peculiarly adapted; I might be able to render the whole a toy, very capable of affording an hour's amusement.</P>
<P>THE Oracle has already been twice put into an English dress; first by an anonymous author, and afterwards by Mrs. Cibber. The former is a literal translation; and, for that reason, very indifferent. The latter I should certainly have made use of upon this occasion; but I found, in consequence of my plan, such curtailing and so many alterations necessary, that, in the end▪ I thought it would be juster to give a more faulty paraphrase of my own.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I apprehend it must please; as it has been selected with the greatest attention, both to the beauty of the airs, and its effect upon the theatre. There are, in∣deed, some people, who may possibly be of opi∣nion, that I ought to have chosen old English and Scotch ballads; or got music composed in the same taste. But, in fact, such sort of compositions scarce deserve the name of music at all; at least, they can have little or no merit on the stage; where every thing ought to be supported by a degree of action and character.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
BUT, be the success of this Opera what it will, it would be very ungrateful in me not to ac∣knowledge my obligations to Mr. Garrick for the great pains he has taken in preparing it for representation: if it succeeds, to him, indeed, it must be chiefly attributed; who has a genius for every thing; and thinks nothing, however trifling, below his attention, that may prove an entertainment to the Public.</P>

<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Once more, Amintor, I desire you will go about your business. How dare you venture here, when I have so often, and so solemnly, forbid you? And what have you been doing? The thing on earth which I have told you would prove your destruction: you have seen Daphne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I consess it. Overcome by the heat of the day, she slept on a bed of roses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did she see you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, madam, don't I tell you she was asleep? No, she did not see me. Transported at the sight of so charm∣ing an object, I seized one of her snowy hands▪ and kissed it as she lay; but she stirred; and, fearing she might awake, I retired: however, madam, 'tis in vain you command me any longer to keep out of her sight; I cannot obey you; I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passion for her; I will see her again, and positively tell her so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My art is great; I can, in an instant, build palaces; raise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and change a place, the most charm∣ing▪ in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ghtful desert; but I see it is beyond my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overn a young fool, whose head is turned with love. Well, son, go on; and, by your own im∣prudenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lose Daphne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what reasons can you have for insisting she should not see me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will know them? Be attentive then. At your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, I consulted the Oracle about your de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiny; and this was its answer▪ <Q>“The son of Mindora, the ma∣gician, is threatened with great misfortunes; but shall avoid them, and even be happy, if he can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke himself beloved by a young princess, who be∣lieves him deaf, dumb, and insensible.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deaf, dumb, and insensible▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Judge, Amintor, by the tenderness I have for you, how I was shocked at so dreadful a sentence. At length, however, after much reflection, I hoped, by
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
taking certain measures, not only to overcome the dangers with which you were menaced, but even to bring about the accomplishment of the Oracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me. When you were about two years old, there was born a princess, the daughter of a neigh∣bouring king; 'twas your Daphne: I instantly con∣veyed her away; and, transporting her to this palace, inaccessible to all human beings, she has been here educated, and served only by statues, to which, by my art, I give motion. In short, I have taken every me∣thod to persuade her, that she and I are the only two creatures that speak, think, and reason; and that all others, formed merely for our use, or amusement, are absolutely insensible, and incapable alike of love and hatred, pain and pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to what purpose, I beseech you, have you filled her mind with all these false prejudices?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To make her believe, when I present you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I understand you; that I also am some unin∣formed being; some puppet; but better organized than the rest. The thought pleases me, and may succeed. Psyche, before she saw Cupid, believed him a monster; yet she loved him: and Daphne, full of the notions you have prepossessed her with, will believe me what the Oracle requires she should; and, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>withstanding, love me. Yes, madam, nature will instruct her; that intellectual intelligence, that sympathetic force of
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
hearts, will work; and I shall be the happiest of mor∣tals! Come, dear mother, let us go this instant and find her out: I will be a statue, a piece of insensible marble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold; it is not time for you to appear yet. I see Daphne crossing the gallery yonder: leave us; and, in the conversation we have together, depend upon it, I will endeavour to prepare things so as to bring them to your satifaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must I go? Well then—But remember, in leaving you, how much I trust to your care: my fate is in your hands; on you it depends whether I shall be happy or miserable.</P>
<LG>
<L>Think, oh! think, within my breast,</L>
<L>While contending passions reign,</L>
<L>How my heart is robb'd of rest;</L>
<L>And, in pity, ease my pain.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know; he disappeared like lightning; but I believe he has done something to me, for my part; he breathed some fire upon my hand, when he kissed it, that went to my heart. I have never been myself since; so restless, so thoughtful; I want—I don't
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
know what I want—I have been just admiring two little birds; they were perched upon the same branch; they sung, they look'd at one another; but with such looks!—You and I never look at one another so—They were silent a few moments, and then began to sing again, or rather to answer one another—with such, such!—Nah, you laugh at me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt. To answer one another, my dear Daphne, they must understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I really believe they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame! Do you believe that your guittar, and your harpsichord, understand you when they accord so justly with your voice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty comparison! They are machines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have not I told you, an hundred, and an hun∣dred times, that your birds are mere machines; only with springs better regulated, being the work of Na∣ture herself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you may repeat it to me a thousand, and a thousand times, my dear, but I shall not believe it: a secret sensation I felt at the sight of these two little birds, refutes all you can say.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<STAGE>MINDORA strikes the Statues with her Wand, who descend and dance; the Women first, and afterwards the Men. They seem to play to each other. DAPHNE appears thoughtful.</STAGE>
<STAGE>MINDORA, DAPHNE, DANCERS.</STAGE>
<P>Daphne, look at these statues; examine them; they are marble, and certainly you do not believe them sen∣sible; yet, by touching certain springs, I will give them motions as extraordinary as those you admired in your birds; which made you believe they felt and thought.—How now, Daphne; you are sad of a sudden; does this little entertainment displease you?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does indeed. Ah! my poor pretty birds! Are you then but machines! I thought you sensible, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted infinite satisfaction in sitting upon the same bough in the day, and resting together in some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at night. Nature, said I to myself, has inspir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d those birds with such tender sentiments to make them happy. She certainly has not been less kind to me—But tell me, my dear Mindora, for you know, who could have come to kiss my hand while I was asleep? Tell me that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I suspect it was a young man, whose foot∣steps I have to day traced about the palace. He took you, at first, I suppose, for a being of his own kind; but finding his mistake when you waked, he ran away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young man!—Are men machines too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but more perfect, and better finished, than even your monkey, whose wit you entertain so high an opinion of: they are generally white, and shaped something like us; I kept some of them here for∣merly; but they had so many faults, that I took a dislike to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Birds sing, statues dance, my harpsichord gives me music—What is it men do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there are several sorts of them. Those who are called soldiers, and are generally the handsomest to look at, meet, sometimes, in great plains, twenty or thirty thousand of them together; and there, with swords and other instruments, cut one another to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye! That's horrid. They are certainly machines; there can be no sense in all that blood-shed; and yet I should not be sorry to see a man neither—for I don't think he would kill me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you have nothing to fear, Daphne. We are women; the fiercest of them all think it a glory to sub∣mit to us.</P>

<P>I do long vastly to see a man—Pray, my dear, try to get me a sight of him that kissed my hand in the garden.</P>

<P>If you did not scare him too much, he may, per∣haps, still be somewhere hereabouts; I think I'll go look for him before he gets farther off.</P>

<P>Yes, Daphne, an impossibility. Must I again repeat to you, that these beings who amuse you, can, by the disposition of their springs, be made to imitate some of our actions; but that these springs, manage them as we will, can never produce a single thought.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! madam, they are no secrets, I assure you. I fee that you are extremely learned, and that you want to make me as great a philosopher as yourself, in order
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
to have always some one to reason with: and you are unwilling to animate Charmer, because you think, if we were able to entertain one another, we should have very little pleasure in rendering ourselves qualified for your sublime conversation. But take notice, from this moment, I am ignorant, and resolved to continue so. The seven sciences are my utter detestation; and, least you should doubt the truth of what I say, I will go instantly and give convincing proofs of my sin∣cerity.</P>

<L>Yes, my dear, depend on't,</L>
<L>One time or other there will be an end on't:</L>

<P>Adieu, globes, spheres, and maps of the world! Is not this anger delightful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is pleasant at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love her the better for it. But let me tell you, madam, you arrived at a very critical moment; I was just going to speak.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Oracle—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I could think of nothing but Daphne! Flat∣tered, caressed, encouraged, I, for a long time, kept my eyes fixed upon the ground; I bit my lips; my whole person was a burthen to me. Ah! madam, what terrible things are lips and eyes, when one dares not make use of them with the angel one adores!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is necessary, however, to constrain yourself for some time longer. Perhaps the sentiments which Daphne en∣tertains for you are not those of love, but meer caprice and curiosity. It will be prudent, therefore, for seven or eight days—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seven or eight days!</P>

<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, dear madam, consider my situation a lit∣tle. Daphne will be pulling me after her every where; she will have me in her apartment, in the garden, in all her walks and retirements about the palace. Do you think I can bear to be tantalized at such a rate; while she plays with me as indifferently as if I was a lap-dog?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you think young girls do; who, for months together, resist their inclinations; and not only hide their passions, but even seem cruel to the man they like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but I am no girl, nor can I be any longer a statue; and, for that reason, I will this moment follow Daphne, and discover myself to her without reserve.</P>
<LG>
<L>Pretend no longer to restrain</L>
<L>The passion struggling in my mind;</L>
<L>Like sprightly coursers, that disdain</L>
<L>The feeble curbing of the rein,</L>
<L>It starts, and leaves the will behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My pangs increase! I'm all on fire!</L>
<L>Then let me to the charmer fly;</L>
<L>Obtain her love, my soul's desire,</L>

<P>Son, I intreat you to defer your designs for a few moments. Here's Daphne again: let me make one thorough trial of her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, madam, 'tis done: I have broke the zodiac and the poles, and thrown the world out of the win∣dows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very passionate, Daphne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you very cruel, madam. You say, sometimes, you love me; and yet, when I ask you to do the only thing in nature that can make me happy, you refuse it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, Daphne, to convince you that I am willing to do every thing in my power, for your amuse∣ment, this puppet shall, if you please, go, and come, and laugh, and cry; throw himself at your feet, appear tender, submissive, complaisant, amorous, uneasy. But all mechanically, like your monkey and your parrot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPHNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My monkey, my parrot! Always my monkey, my parrot! You only make those comparisons, that the inclination I have for him may appear ridiculous.</P>

<P>'Tis very true; and therefore take my advice; turn him away, and think no more of him.</P>

<P>You only say that to vex me now, because you know I can't bear the thoughts of it.</P>

<P>Well then let him stay, and divert yourself with teaching him verses, or any thing you have a mind he should repeat.</P>
