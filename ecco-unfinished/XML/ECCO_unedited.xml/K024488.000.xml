<HEAD>1 PETER II. 16.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</HEAD>
<P>THE duties to which we are this day cal∣led,
are principally two; to implore the
blessing of God on the counsels and the
arms of our sovereign and our country, for put∣ting
an happy end to the civil war in which we
are involved; and to humble ourselves in sincere
repentance for those sins by which we have pro∣voked
God to visit us with this calamity, and
which, persisted in, may justly provoke him to
prolong it, or to blast our success and our national
prosperity. In both these duties we may be ani∣mated
and directed, by due consideration of the
words now read.</P>
<P>THE apostle having inculcated on Christians
submission to the civil government under which
they lived; and, though it was a very exception∣able
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
form, being the government of the Roman
emperours, and that too chiefly as it was exer∣cised
over the provinces, having represented that
submission as a duty of sacred obligation, as in∣cumbent
<HI>for the Lord's sake,</HI> and required by <HI>the
will of God;</HI> he adds, <HI>As free, and not using
your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the
servants of God.</HI> He acknowleges that they were
free in many important respects; but he inti∣mates
that a licence wantonly to oppose established
government, is no part of that liberty which the
gospel either bestows or tolerates: he permits them
to enjoy and rejoice in every degree of true li∣berty
which the government allowed them; but
he warns them, that under the false colour of en∣joying
and using it, they might very readily run
into <HI>maliciousness,</HI> into bad practices of many kinds,
and, by the plausible pretence of these being im∣plied
in the lawful exercise of their liberty, might
deceive both themselves and others into an insen∣sibility
of their baseness, perhaps into an admira∣tion
of them as great and worthy. He points
out their danger, not to excuse their misconduct
by the difficulty of avoiding it, but on the con∣trary
to make them the more careful to avoid it;
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
for he assures them that what is in any degree
wrong cannot be justified by its being disguised
under the <HI>cloke</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> that it is inconsistent with
their being <HI>the servants of God,</HI> a right to disobey
whom liberty cannot possibly include, who ex∣pressly
requires Christians to be subject to their
governours, and who will call them to an account
for the manner in which they use their liberty, as
well as for every other part of their behaviour.</P>
<P>IF now, my brethren, that opposition to the
government of Britain, which its colonies have
raised, comes under the description of what Peter
expressly forbids, if it has been raised under a <HI>false
pretence</HI> of enjoying and defending their <HI>liberty,</HI>
and if it has led them into conduct which may
justly be called <HI>maliciousness,</HI> we may with humble
saith and trust implore the blessing of God on our
righteous cause: And if many of the vices which
stain our national character, and insect the hearts
and pervert the ways of individuals, spring srom
our indulging ourselves in what is wrong, under
the colour of liberty, we may, by considering
them in their source, be excited to and directed
in our repentance for them. That both these
suppositions are founded in truth, it shall be my
business to evince.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
I. I SHALL show that the opposition of the
colonies to the government of Britain has been
raised under a false pretence of liberty, and has
proceeded to maliciousness. I shall not enter mi∣nutely
into all the reasonings which might be used
for the full proof of this, nor into an examination
of all the exceptions which have been adopted in
order to elude their force; I shall only suggest
some of those principles and maxims, which may
be clearly established, and which lead directly to
the conclusion.</P>
<P>THE world is not yet so degenerate that men
can carry on what is wrong, avowedly as being
wrong; all except the most abandoned must, for
their own peace of mind, disguise it to them∣selves;
and, for obtaining the support or even
avoiding the detestation of others, all must veil
it to the world, under the cloke of what is right,
or innocent at least. We can never safely form
our judgment of the designs and the conduct of
men, by the representation which themselves give
of them: the brighter the varnish which they en∣deavour
to throw over them, the blacker in rea∣lity
generally are bad designs and vicious actions.
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Any thing that is good, may, by the self-deceit
and artifice of men, be perverted into a cover for
evil practices: but there is a singular danger of
liberty being abused into a mask for all the de∣grees
of undutiful behaviour towards governours.
The very conception of liberty naturally warms
the heart, makes a strong impression on the spirit,
and produces vigorous efforts to repell whatever
we regard as an encroachment on it: and it is
too ready to lead us to mistake the justest re∣straints
for encroachments. If its true nature and
its real extent be in any measure misunderstood,
it inevitably pushes men into misconduct; and
that with the greater force, on account of the
ardor which it kindles in the breast, and which
always burns strongest in the most generous na∣tures.</P>
<P>A SUPPOSED encroachment on their liberty, is
confessedly the motive to the defection of the
colonies; and this encroachment lies precisely in
their being taxed by the British parliament without
their own consent. The plea, that to be taxed
without their own consent, is simply and in itself
to be in slavery, depends on this general principle,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
That liberty consists in mens being governed only
by laws made by themselves or with their own
consent. This description of liberty has been
given by some of the greatest of our countrymen,
and under the sanction of their names has been
implicitly received, and with the generality has
past into an axiom. But it is a description, from
which it might easily be proved to follow, That
the best possible form of government may be in∣consistent
with liberty, That the very worst form
may be consistent with liberty, That there never
was one free government in the world, That if a
free government were formed, it could not be
transmitted beyond that generation which formed
it, That liberty cannot subsist in any society, ex∣cept
every individual belonging to it have a share
in the legislature, Nor subsist a moment longer
than all their resolutions are unanimous. A con∣ception
of liberty fraught with consequences so
absurd, yet demonstrably deducible from it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have often examined the connexion between all these
consequences and the commonly received description of li∣berty,
with the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st scrupulous attention of which I am ca∣pable:
but a full eviction of it would have been improper
in a <HI>sermon:</HI> it is a subject much fitter for a <HI>treatise.</HI></NOTE>,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
must needs be false; and when it is prevalent, it
is certainly of importance that it be exploded. That
every person should be governed only by his own
consent, is inconsistent with every possible form of
government; it is, in its strictest sense, inconsistent
even with the independence of a nation of savages.</P>
<P>LIBERTY cannot exist in any society without
restraints; were there but two persons within
reach of one another, the one could not enjoy
liberty, if the other were under no restraint. Li∣berty
consists only in the power of doing what we
ought, and in not being constrained to do what
we ought not. Wherever laws require only what
is right, and forbid only what is wrong, there is li∣berty,
by whomsoever the laws be made. Where∣ever
the form of government gives security for
such laws, it gives proportionable security for li∣berty.
It is our happiness to live under a govern∣ment
which gives the greatest security for this:
but our security arises not immediately, but only
remotely, from part of the legislature being cho∣sen
by the people: the circumstance from which
it <HI>immediately</HI> arises, is, that the legislature have
the same interest with the body of the people; and
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
this circumstance gives the very same security to
those who have no voice in chusing them, as to
those who have.</P>
<P>LAWS imposing taxes, stand on no different
ground from other laws. Taxes proportioned to
the real ends of good government, are as necessary
as government itself. They are not a <HI>free gift</HI> of
the people, which they may lawfully with-hold at
pleasure: They are a <HI>debt</HI> on the property of the
people, strictly due to the public; a right to re∣fuse
them, would be a right to subvert govern∣ment,
which cannot subsist without them. There∣fore
the same apostle who faith, <HI>Let every soul be
subject unto the higher powers</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1.</NOTE>, saith also, <HI>Render
to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due,
custom to whom custom</HI><NOTE N="||" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7.</NOTE>. Taxes are encroach∣ments
upon liberty, not by their being imposed
upon persons without their own consent, but only
by their being such as they ought not to be; only
when they are excessive, or when they are grossly
unequal, or when there is no security against their
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ming such. That the taxes required from
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onies were excessive, either in themselves,
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in comparison with those of Britain, has not
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
been and cannot be pretended; they were palpa∣bly
the reverse. That the colonies, if taxed by the
British parliament, would not have had the very
same <HI>degree</HI> of security against oppression, as the
other subjects, is readily acknowleged; yet they
would have had a very great, perhaps a sufficient
degree of security, from the very circumstance
which gives us security, their manifold connexions
of interest with the members of the legislature;
but if this was not deemed a sufficient security,
concern for their liberty would have doubtless ju∣stified
them in making dutiful application for some
additional security; every liberal mind would have
wished success to their application, and it would
have met with success; if it had been obstinately
refused, the refusal, in a free state, I scruple not
to say, would have justified resistance; for it would
have betrayed an intention of abridging the liber∣ty
which the constitution allows. But this has ne∣ver
been their demand; it has been declared that
this was not what they desired, or would be satis∣fied
with. Their demand has been such as pre∣cluded
the offer of such security from being made
to them. Their <HI>professed</HI> demand has constantly
been, that they should not be at all taxed by the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
British parliament, but only by their own separate
assemblies: and this is a demand truly inconsistent
with their being parts of the whole empire; a de∣mand,
the granting of which could scarcely fail to
occasion a continual deficience in the revenue, and
would either overburden the rest of the subjects▪ to
make up their deficience, or else put a stop to all
the operations of government; nay it is a demand,
though made by the pretended partizans of liberty,
which it might easily be proved, by entitling ad∣ministration
to make requisitions from distinct and
independent legislatures, would directly tend to
enable them, by caressing one, to enslave the
whole. But even this demand, unreasonable and
pernicious as it is, was only a mask to disguise
what they truly and ultimately aimed at, a total
immunity from contributing any thing to the ge∣neral
support of the British empire; an immunity
repugnant to the plainest principles of justice, an
invasion on the property, and an encroachment
on the liberty of all the other subjects.</P>
<P>UNDER the specious <HI>cloke of liberty,</HI> but really
in support of so unjust a demand, our deluded
brethren have proceeded to conduct which in
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
every point of view may be termed <HI>maliciousness.</HI>
With liberty in their mouths, they have exercised
the cruellest violence, the most oppressive tyranny
over all among themselves, who would not co-operate
in their designs: <HI>the vilest men</HI> have been
<HI>exalted,</HI> and therefore <HI>the wicked</HI> have <HI>walked on
every side</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. xii. 8.</NOTE>. They have stirred up war: and war
is one of the siercest siends which the Almighty
turneth loose sor the punishment of nations by
whom he hath been long provoked; the destruc∣tion
of the human species is the end at which it
aims; as soon as it breaks out, thousands be∣come
intent on butchering thousands. They have
wantonly risen in rebellion, they have excited a
civil war: to excite it, except for the most urgent
as well as the most important cause, is enormous
and complicated guilt. It is the sellest sorm of
war; it sets every man against his brother; it
bursts the dearest and the most sacred ties. They
have persisted for years in war; many a father,
with a bleeding heart, has been dragged srom his
clinging wife and his tender offspring, to fall in
turning the battle from the gate; many a weeping
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
mother has seen her darling son, perhaps her only
hope, torn from her bosom, to perish by the sword;
the bloody horrors os a field of battle have been
renewed and again renewed: <HI>come, behold what
desolations</HI> have been <HI>made in the earth</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlvi. 8.</NOTE>. Unna∣tural
children have made these desolations in lift∣ing
up their arm against the mother land, who
had cherished their infancy, and raised them to
high prosperity. They have lifted up their arm
against her, in violation of the solemn oaths of
allegiance which their own mouths had pronoun∣ced
in the face of heaven. Not another, but that
very generation of men have thus afflicted Bri∣tain,
in whose defence she had lately wasted mil∣lions
of her treasures and rivers of her blood;
ungrateful, they have thus afflicted her for having,
at this expence, driven from their continent, a
nation from whom they were in perpetual dan∣ger.
This very security which she had dearly
purchased for them, they have misemployed against
herself. To fill up the measure of their ingrati∣tude,
that same nation, in dread of whom they
had lived so long, and by whom, for all that them∣selves
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
could have done, they had been ere now
enslaved, they have courted to embrue her hands
in the blood of their parent country, by whose
strenuous and costly efforts alone, but about
fifteen years ago, their deliverance was wrought,
By such conduct, the spirit of the nation may well
be roused. By exposing its accumulated baseness,
I mean not to exasperate you against their persons;
most of them have been deluded, many of them
have mistaken; I mean to excite you to pray
with the greater earnestness for their repentance,
to pray, not that they may, by the success of our
arms, be reduced to slavery,—the generous spirit
of British liberty, both in our rulers, and in the
people, reprobates the thought with indignation,—but
to pray that, by returning to their
duty, they may be restored to the blessings of the
freest government under heaven, instead of groan∣ing
for years under the alternate ravages of anarchy
and tyranny, and in all probability, after a series
of excruciating convulsions, settling at last in ar∣bitrary
government: I mean to make you feel
the justice of your country's cause, and to add con∣fidence
and fervour to your prayers for her pros∣perity
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
and success. Guilty as she may be in many
respects, in relation to her colonies she is guilt∣less;
if she be chargeable with any faults on their
account, they are so trivial as to vanish when
compared with the atrocity of theirs. If in so
just a cause, the righteous King of nations deny
us success, it must be, either for the accomplish∣ment
of some great purpose of his own inscrutable
providence, or for the punishment of our sins.
Mani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old and heinous the sins of this nation doubt∣less
are; and the general spirit of that corruption
from which they flow, cannot perhaps be repre∣sented
in any juster point of view, than that which
the text suggests, as we shall briefly unsold under
the second head proposed.</P>
<P>II. WE too, brethren, have <HI>used our liberty for
a cloke of maliciousness.</HI> Many of the vices which
stain our national character, and pollute individu∣als,
spring srom our indulging ourselves in what is
wrong, under the colour of liberty. The faulty
part of the British character, in the present age,
cannot be more precisely desined, than by a reign∣ing
propensity to libertinism and licentiousness.
The leading seature in the prevailing manners of
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
the times, is a daring freedom in disdaining all
restraints of laws human and divine, and in de∣spising
all that order and decorum which compli∣ance
with them would establish.</P>
<P>IT is the fundamental law of civil society, more
ancient than any written law, enacted by God at
that moment when he formed man for society,
that all the members of the state co-operate for
the public good. But in the practice of very ma∣ny,
this fundamental law is even reversed. In the
room of affection to the interest and service of
their country, they have substituted attachment to
a party, and sordid selfish views. When they on∣ly
perform their duty, by promoting right mea∣sures,
they must be hired to perform it; and for
hire they will promote any measures. I need not
labour to expose this spirit of corruption: however
many may be actuated by it, all pretend that they
detest it. By many again, a spirit of stated, un∣distinguished
opposition to every measure of go∣vernment,
right or wrong, is indulged, avowed,
and applauded. It is <HI>maliciousness;</HI> it is inconsistent
with integrity, for it is not possible that <HI>every</HI> mea∣sure
should be wrong. It would pass itself for the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
opposite of corruption; but it is its twin-brother;
its language is, Let my country perish, if it is not
saved by the party to which I have given my
name, and in the prevalence of which my interest
or my caprice is involved. It calls itself a watchful
jealousy for liberty; but the first opportunity of
getting into place proves that it was only unprinci∣pled
selfishness and ambition. It pretends to be
of great utility as a check against bad designs: but
it loses all the power of checking <HI>bad</HI> designs, by
being pointed against <HI>every</HI> measure; it necessarily
hinders many <HI>good</HI> designs from being formed;
it obstructs the execution of the best; if it prevailed,
it would stop all the motions of government and
annihilate the state; it renders corruption almost
inevitable for avoiding this effect. It disfuses itself
through the body of the people; it produces <HI>mur∣murers,
complainers, presumptuous, self-willed,</HI> sac∣tious
spirits, <HI>despising government, speaking evil of
dignities</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jude 16. 2 Pet. ii. 10.</NOTE>; it vents itself in groundless clamours,
little dangerous, it may be to the public, on ac∣count
of the obscurity and impotence of those who
utter them, but violations of that dutiful behavi∣our
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
which religion, as well as sound reason, re∣quires
of subjects. In every rank of men, it some∣times
festers even into such malignity as to pro∣duce
partiality against their country.</P>
<P>THE law of God is, <HI>Honour the king; submit
yourselves to every ordinance of man, whether it be
to the king, as supreme, or unto governours, as unto
them that are sent by him</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14, 17.</NOTE>; <HI>render to all their
dues, fear to whom fear is due, honour to whom
honour</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 7.</NOTE>. But the spirit of this age spurns all
subordination; it indulges itself in vilifying and
abusing the best and the most exalted characters;
it glories in insolence to all superiours, as the most
delicious enjoyment of liberty. Alas! liberty has
not a more deadly foe than such licentiousness:
its immediate effect is lawless anarchy; its end
seldom fails to be slavery.</P>
<P>SUCH instances of behaviour as I have mention∣ed,
we generally consider as purely political; we
are very apt to forget that morality and religion
have any concern in them: but both have a
deep concern in them; all the degrees of dis∣affection
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
to the interest of our country, and of
disrespect to our rulers and superiours, are truly
sinful, however they may be cloked; and they
are sins which there is a peculiar necessity to men∣tion
on this day, as requiring repentance, because,
not only by the just judgment of God against them,
but also by their own direct operation, they tend
to bring on national calamities, and have in an
eminent degree contributed to produce, and if
persisted in, must continue to aggravate the very
calamity which we are now deploring.</P>
<P>BUT these are not the only sins by which God
may be provoked to afflict our country; these are
not the only kinds of <HI>maliciousness</HI> which we indulge
under the disguise of <HI>liberty.</HI> God often punishes
sins by other judgments than those which arise
directly from their own natural tendency; and
among us many sins prevail, which deserve his
heaviest judgments. I need not enumerate them
minutely; they are too notorious to require it.
I need not studiously trace them up to the affecta∣tion
of false liberty, as their source; they are too
plainly tinged with the colour of this corrupt foun∣tain.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
THE laws of private justice are of sacred and
indispensible obligation; they are necessary for the
very existence of society. The violation of them
is so grossly vicious as scarce to be susceptible of
palliation, by the most extravagant misconception
of liberty. Yet so great is our depravity, that
justice is violated with the most unreserved licence.
Violations of it, in some of their blackest forms,
and the most subversive of the faith of solemn con∣tracts,
are frequent and flagrant beyond the exam∣ple
of any former period; and in all transactions
of business, how much do the arts of dishonesty
abound? What injuries are daily perpetrated
against the property, the reputation, the peace
and quiet, the most valuable rights of men?</P>
<P>WITH what impetuosity do persons of every
station of life, rush madly into every conceivable
dissipation? The gentle ties of decency and propri∣ety
are regarded as intolerable fetters, and thrown
aside as incompatible with enlargement and free∣dom
of spirit. A levity of manners greatly blame∣able,
a giddy fondness for unceasing amusement,
insignificance, enervation of spirit, application to
trifles, impatience of reflection, indisposition to
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
serious or severe employment, are chargeable on
multitudes who are comparatively innocent. The
destructive idleness of gaming is no longer only
the asylum of the desperate and the unthinking;
very generally in the upper spheres of life, and
too generally in the lower, it is painfully pursued
as an occupation, its arts are seriously formed into
a science, its objects are, with a misemployed in∣genuity,
surprisingly multiplied. Profusion over∣leaps
all the boundaries of prudence, and ex∣hausts
in a moment all the supplies which industry
can furnish or honestly permit, and all the resour∣ces
which princely fortunes can afford. Tempe∣rance
imposes only wholesome and salutary restric∣tions:
but they gall like shackles; they are burst
asunder, and cast away; full scope is given to
luxury in all its forms; debauchery revels thro' the
land; every pleasure, the most guilty, the most
shameful, is eagerly and openly pursued. The
holy bands of marriage are contemned; the sacred
purity of the marriage bed, as well as the chastity
of the blushing virgin, is polluted with a degree
of effrontery unknown in other ages. Even the
more delicate sex have, in numerous instances,
renounced all the modesty of their nature. And
all these heinous vices are varnished over, and at∣tempted
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
to be justified, by being misnamed liber∣ties.
All the passions are indulged till they cannot
bear control from principle or conscience.</P>
<P>WE think ourselves free to shake even the throne
of God. The liberty of examining every religious
principle with impartiality, many abuse into a li∣cence
of rejecting all religious principles without
examination, and of treating all religion with
scurrilous abuse or sneering ridicule. The liberty
of every man's worshiping God according to his
conscience, many pervert into the privilege of not
worshiping him at all, and of scoffing at those who
worship him, as the slaves of illiberal superstition.
In how many ways is the solemnity of oaths profan∣ed,
and their tremendous obligation slighted? A
commanding sense of God, habitual piety, fervent
devotion, how generally are they wanting? how
defective are they in the best?</P>
<P><HI>The land and all the inhabitants thereof are
dissolved</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxv. 3.</NOTE>. Dissoluteness of manners has made
an alarming progress. God forbid that these enor∣mous
vices should be general in the nation! God
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
forbid that they should not be ballanced by many
virtues! But certainly they are by far too pre∣valent:
and while they continue prevalent, can we
wonder if God with-hold his blessing from us, even
in the justest cause, and notwithstanding the
crimes of those who have risen up against us? Suc∣cess
proportioned to the justice of our cause, we
have not yet obtained. Let us mourn for the cor∣ruption
of manners which doubtless has obstructed
it; let us pray for a general reformation; let each
of us search out his own sins and turn from them.
Let us never foolishly affect an exemption from the
restraints of any one of God's laws, but act in all
things <HI>as the servants of God,</HI> persuaded that his
service is perfect liberty, and peace, and happiness.</P>
