<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>RIGHT Arts, abus'd, like Gems, receive their Flaws;</L>
<L>Physick has Quacks, and Quirks obscure the Laws.</L>
<L>Fables to shade Historic Truths combine,</L>
<L>And the dark Sophist dims the Text Divine.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
The Art of Reasoning in Religion's Cause,</L>
<L>By Superstition's Taint a Blindness draws.</L>
<L>The <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Thinking Free</HI> (Man's noblest Aim!)</L>
<L>Turns, in <HI>Half-thinking</HI> Souls, his equal Shame.</L>
<L>Colours, ill-mingled, coarse, and lifeless grow!</L>
<L>Violins squeak, when Scrapers work the Bow!</L>
<L>Distortion deadens Action's temper'd Fire!</L>
<L>Belab'ring Poetasters <HI>thrum</HI> the Lyre!</L>
<L>Gesture shuns Strut, and Elocution, Cant!</L>
<L>Passion lies murder'd by unmeaning Rant!</L>
<L>Wit we debase, if Ribaldry we praise,</L>
<L>And Satire fades, when Slander wears the Bays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU, to whose Scrolls a just Neglect is shewn,</L>
<L>Whose Names, tho' printed oft, remain unknown;</L>
<L>I war not with the Weak, if wanting Fame,</L>
<L>The Proud, and Prosp'rous Trifler is my Game.</L>
<L>With usual Wit, unfelt while you assail,</L>
<L>Remark unanswer'd, and unheeded Rail!</L>
<L>Or heeded, know I can your Censure prize,</L>
<L>For a Fool's Praise is Censure from the Wise;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
If then my Labour your kind Malice draws,</L>
<L>Censure from you is from the Wise Applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU, who delineate strong our Lust of Fame,</L>
<L>These mimic Lays your kind Protection claim!</L>
<L>My Frown, like your's, would to Improvement tend,</L>
<L>You but assume the Foe, to act the Friend.</L>
<L>Pleasing, yet wounding, you our Faults rehearse,</L>
<L>Strong are your Thoughts! Inchanting rolls your Verse!</L>
<L>Deep, clear, and sounding! decent, yet sincere;</L>
<L>In Praise impartial, without Spleen severe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“HOLD, Criticks cry—Erroneous are your Lays,</L>
<L>Your Field was Satire, your Pursuit is Praise.”</L>
<L>True, you Profound!—I praise, but yet I sneer;</L>
<L>You're dark to Beauties, if to Errors clear!</L>
<L>Know my Lampoon's in Panegyric seen,</L>
<L>For just Applause turns Satire on your Spleen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHALL Ignorance and Insult claim my Rage?</L>
<L>Then with the World a gen'ral War I wage!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
No—to some Follies Satire scorns to bend,</L>
<L>And Worth (or press'd, or prosp'rous) I commend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FIRST, let me view what noxious Nonsense reigns,</L>
<L>While yet I loiter on Prosaic Plains;</L>
<L>If Pens impartial active Annals trace,</L>
<L>Others, with secret Hist'ry, Truth deface:</L>
<L>Views and Reviews, and wild Memoirs appear,</L>
<L>And Slander darkens each recorded Year.</L>
<L>Each Prince's Death to Poison they apply,</L>
<L>No Royal Mortals sure by Nature die.</L>
<L>Fav'rites or Kindred artful Deaths create,</L>
<L>A Father, Brother, Son, or Wife is Fate.</L>
<L>In a past Reign was form'd a secret League,</L>
<L>Some Ring, or Letter, now reveals th' Intrigue:</L>
<L>A certain Earl a certain Queen enjoys,</L>
<L>A certain Subject Fair her Peace destroys;</L>
<L>The jealous Queen a vengeful Art assumes,</L>
<L>And scents her Rival's Gloves with dire Perfumes:</L>
<L>Queens, with their Ladies, work unseemly things,</L>
<L>And Boys grow Dukes, when Catamites to Kings.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
A lying Monk on Miracles refines,</L>
<L>And Vengeance glares from violated Shrines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS Slander o'er the Dead-One's Fame prevails,</L>
<L>And easy Minds imbibe Romantic Tales:</L>
<L>Thus from feign'd Facts a false Reflection flows,</L>
<L>And by Tradition Superstition grows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEXT, Pamphleteers a Trade licentious drive,</L>
<L>Like wrangling Lawyers, they by Discord thrive.</L>
<L>If <HI>Hancock</HI> proves <HI>Cold Water's</HI> Virtue clear,</L>
<L>His Rival prints a Treatise on <HI>Warm Beer.</HI></L>
<L>If next Inoculation's Art spreads wide,</L>
<L>(An Art, that mitigates Infection's Tide)</L>
<L>Loud <HI>Pamphleteers</HI> 'gainst <HI>Innovation</HI> cry,</L>
<L><HI>Let Nature work</HI>—'Tis natural to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF Heav'n-born Wisdom, gazing Nature thro',</L>
<L>Thro' Nature's Optics forms Religion's View,</L>
<L>Priestcraft opposes Demonstration's Aid,</L>
<L>And with dark Myst'ry dignifies her Trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<L>IF Ruin rushes o'er a Statesman's Sway,</L>
<L>Scribblers, like Worms, on tainted Grandeur pre</L>
<L>While a poor Felon waits th' impending Stroke,</L>
<L>Voracious Scribes, like hov'ring Ravens, croak.</L>
<L>In their dark Quills a dreary Insult lies,</L>
<L>Th' Offence lives recent, tho' th' Offender dies;</L>
<L>In his last Words they suck his parting Breath,</L>
<L>And gorge on his loath'd Memory after Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WRETCHES, like these, no Satire wou'd chastise,</L>
<L>But Follies here to ruthless Insult rise;</L>
<L>Distinguish'd Insult taints a Nation's Fame,</L>
<L>And various Vice deserves a various Shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PAMPHLETS I leave—sublime my Fancy grows!</L>
<L>No more she sweeps the humble <HI>Vale</HI> of <HI>Prose.</HI></L>
<L>Now I trace swift the <HI>Muse's</HI> airy Clime,</L>
<L>The Dance of Numbers, and the Change of Rhime!</L>
<L>In measur'd Rounds Imagination swims,</L>
<L>And the Brain whirls with new, surprizing Whims!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<HI>Poets are mad!</HI> 'tis granted:—So are you,</L>
<L>Grave Critics, who those Lunatics pursue:</L>
<L>You labour Comments, dry on <HI>Classic</HI> Lays,</L>
<L>Partial alike in Censure, and in Praise;</L>
<L>Where most abstruse, you most assert they shine,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Homer</HI> raves, his <HI>Allegory's</HI> fine!</L>
<L>But if a <HI>Modern</HI> with an <HI>Ancient</HI> vies,</L>
<L>Spirit grows Phrensy, to a Wit so wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PHLEGM without Fire, your flat Encomiums bear,</L>
<L>When you declaim, a Mark revers'd you wear;</L>
<L>If not inspir'd, at least possess'd you seem,</L>
<L>You boil with Choler, and <HI>dismiss</HI> your Phlegm.</L>
<L>None unprefer'd, in Parliament more loud!</L>
<L>No worn-out Fair more peevish, or more proud!</L>
<L>No City-Dame, when to the Birth-Night drawn,</L>
<L>More vain of Gems!—(some Female Courtier's Pawn!)</L>
<L>Proud as a Judge, when Equity's a Trade,</L>
<L>Or Lord, whose Guilt was with a Title paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<L>MARK cautious <HI>Cinna</HI> mimic Poesy's Flame,</L>
<L>Coarse are his Colours, and obscure his Aim!</L>
<L><HI>Cinna,</HI> thy Genius weds not with the Muse;</L>
<L>No longer then thy well-known Parts misuse!</L>
<L><HI>Cinna,</HI> thus <HI>doctor'd,</HI> stifles all he writ,</L>
<L>But sneers malignant at another's Wit.</L>
<L>Some beauteous Piece applauded, He replies,</L>
<L><HI>The Sun has Spots,</HI> and a wish'd Error spies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO some warm Lass grows pregnant e'er she marries,</L>
<L>Takes <HI>Physic,</HI> and for <HI>Honour's</HI> sake <HI>miscarries;</HI></L>
<L>Jealous of Praise, pale Envy taints her Lip,</L>
<L>And her Tongue tattles of each Virgin's Trip.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>THEOCRITUS</HI>'s <HI>Ape,</HI> dry, proud, and vain,</L>
<L>Shews the stiff Quaker for the simple Swain.</L>
<L>In Tragic Scenes, how <HI>soft</HI> he moves Distress?</L>
<L>His <HI>Lamb-like Princess</HI> in the <HI>Pure-one's Dress:</HI></L>
<L>Plain in Expression, and in Passion tame,</L>
<L>Propriety of Words is all his Aim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>SCRIBLERS grow fast—One, who gains least Applause,</L>
<L>(His Works reprinting) a Subscription draws.</L>
<L>Ape of an Ape! How is the Species grown?</L>
<L>Inferior Apes this Ape a <HI>Viceroy</HI> own!</L>
<L>O'er a learn'd Tribe, He <HI>Grand Dictator</HI> plays,</L>
<L>And points young Wits new Models in his Lays.</L>
<L>Flat Odes, Epistles, and Translations rise,</L>
<L>And a new Preface words it with the Wise!</L>
<L>Art is School Trash—<HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI> are Fool</L>
<L>Sonnets and Madrigals require no Rules.</L>
<L><HI>Milton</HI> runs <HI>rough</HI>—Here <HI>plainer</HI> Lays allure!</L>
<L>Nor Low, nor Grand, nor Simple, nor Impure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Love-sick Youth, who sighs about Eighteen,</L>
<L>Whines in Blank Verse, and tries a Tragic Scene.</L>
<L>One Poet, damn'd, turns Critick, storms in Prose;</L>
<L>His railing Pamphlet his wrong'd Merit shows.</L>
<L>A trading Bard salutes the Lord in Place,</L>
<L>Whom he insults with Satire, in Disgrace.</L>
<L>One, jocund, sings Birth-Days, and Nuptial Rites:</L>
<L>One, of the Dead, a doleful Dirge recites,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Dull as deep Bells, that toll the Fun'ral's Time,</L>
<L>Or drowzy Echoes from the Bell-Man's Rhime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A cast-off Dame, who of Intrigues can judge,</L>
<L>Writes Scandal in Romance—A Printer's Drudge!</L>
<L>Flush'd with Success, for Stage-Renown she pants,</L>
<L>And melts, and swells, and pens luxurious Rants.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT while her Muse a sulph'rous Flame displays,</L>
<L>Glows strong with Lust, or burns with Envy's Blaze!</L>
<L>While some black Fiend, that hugs the haggar'd Shrew,</L>
<L>Hangs his collected Horrors on her Brow!</L>
<L><HI>Clio,</HI> descending Angels sweep thy Lyre,</L>
<L>Prompt thy soft Lays, and breathe <HI>Seraphic</HI> Fire.</L>
<L>Tears fall, Sighs rise, obedient to thy Strains,</L>
<L>And the Blood dances in the mazy Veins!</L>
<L>Crown'd with the Palm, Bays, Myrtle, and the Vine;</L>
<L>Love, Pity, Friendship, Music, Wit, and Wine,</L>
<L>In social Spirits, lead thy Hours along,</L>
<L>Thou Life of Loveliness, thou Soul of Song!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<L>A Blade whose Life a Turn of Humour takes,</L>
<L>Cocks smart, trims fine, treats Harlots, scours with Rakes!</L>
<L>When his drain'd Purse no new Expence supplies,</L>
<L>Fond Madam frowns, each dear Companion flies!</L>
<L>Duns clamour, Bailiffs lurk, and Clothes decay,</L>
<L>Coin ebbs, he must recruit—He writes a Play.</L>
<L>“Bold Task! a Play?—Mark our young Bard proceed!</L>
<L>A Play?—Your Wits in Want are Wits indeed.”</L>
<L>Here the Punk's Jokes are for Politeness wrote,</L>
<L>Some inconsistent Novel forms a Plot.</L>
<L>In the Gallant, his own wise Conduct glares!</L>
<L>Smut is sheer Wit!—Each Prank a Merit wears!</L>
<L>Bright Youth! He steals, to make the Piece entire,</L>
<L>A Cuckold, Beau, pert Footman, and a Squire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Bards thus patch up Plays from various Scraps,</L>
<L>They dream of crouded Houses! thundring Claps!</L>
<L>False Hope! Poets are poor, and Fortune's blind,</L>
<L>Actors are saucy—or the Town's unkind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
<L>BUT why should Satire war with ill Success?</L>
<L>Why should I add Affliction to Distress?</L>
<L>'Tis bold t' assail proud Vice with stinging Lays!</L>
<L>'Tis bolder yet, to give wrong'd Merit Praise!</L>
<L>Few dare accuse what stately Wits defend!</L>
<L>Few dare against the gen'ral Vogue commend!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>JOHNNY</HI>'s fine Works at Court obtain Renown!</L>
<L><HI>Aaron</HI> writes Trash—He ne'er collogues the Town.</L>
<L>How Grand the Verse which <HI>My Lord's</HI> Feats declares.</L>
<L>Rude are Lampoons, that lash <HI>My Lady's</HI> Airs.</L>
<L>How arch the Wit, when <HI>Her Grace</HI> deigns a Laugh</L>
<L>Dull is the Satire on the <HI>Duke's white Staff.</HI></L>
<L>Oh, <HI>You Polite!</HI> Your Smiles are Fame's sweet Road;</L>
<L>We praise, subscribe, or damn—because the <HI>Mode.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>JOHNNY</HI> no more reflects a shining Page,</L>
<L>From that bright Genius, that has charm'd the Age!</L>
<L>More conscious now, his single Worth he rates!</L>
<L>Verses are made, like Med'cines, by Receipts.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Soft Phrases he collects—to scan, to chime,</L>
<L>Reads deep, and weighs vast <HI>Lexicons</HI> of Rhyme.</L>
<L>Hints from <HI>Fontaine,</HI> some smart Design compleat;</L>
<L>The Whim is pretty, and the Language neat.</L>
<L>Tho' smart, neat, pretty; yet ev'n Courtiers own,</L>
<L>It glitters not with <HI>Pope</HI>—aside 'tis thrown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>JOHNNY,</HI> who fosters next his Patron's Wit,</L>
<L>Strikes out a Play, with Thought, and Spirit writ!</L>
<L>To first-rank Beaus our artful Bard applies,</L>
<L>One writes to charm the Fair, and One the Wise.</L>
<L>Beaus fly the Fame, yet secret Talents know,</L>
<L>And read, revise, and ev'n Co-Authors grow;</L>
<L>And now anew th'inverted Work they frame,</L>
<L>New Thoughts they hatch!—But <HI>Johnny</HI> holds the <HI>Name.</HI></L>
<L>So fruitful Madams, their Amours unknown,</L>
<L>Bear private Babes, which, born, their Midwives own.</L>
<L>At Grand Assemblies, Play and Bard appear,</L>
<L>Cabals are form'd, our <HI>Johnny</HI>'s Debts to clear;</L>
<L>'Tis read, prais'd, acted!—Now the Poet's Trap!</L>
<L><HI>Beaus</HI> heed your <HI>Scenes!</HI> You know your <HI>Cues</HI> to <HI>clap.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<L>THUS thro' nine Nights loud Party-Praises roar,</L>
<L>Then die away at once, to noise no more.</L>
<L>In vain such Authors hope substantial Fame,</L>
<L>Such Praise must usher in a sequent Shame.</L>
<L>To the next Age, the present proves disgrac'd,</L>
<L>With the mean Wits we priz'd, it ranks our Taste;</L>
<L>But thro' a third, not ev'n their Shame they boast,</L>
<L>Their Names, their Works, and Shame alike are lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CALL you these Witlings a Poetic Brood?</L>
<L>Are Pies and Daws the Songsters of the Wood?</L>
<L>For Wit, not Nonsense, first was form'd the Stage,</L>
<L>Not to infect, but to refine the Age!</L>
<L>Here soften'd Virtue Rigour's Frown declines!</L>
<L>Precept, enforc'd by just Example, shines!</L>
<L>In each rais'd Tear a gen'rous Meaning flows!</L>
<L>In each pleas'd Smile a fair Instruction grows!</L>
<L>When we strike Nature, and improve the Mind,</L>
<L>Those deathless Works a sweet Remembrance find;</L>
<L>No chearless Merit unrewarded toils,</L>
<L>Still <HI>Compton</HI> lives, and still a <HI>Dorset</HI> smiles:</L>

Some Noble Spirits still adorn the <HI>Great,</HI></L>
<L>Still shines <HI>Argyle</HI> with ev'ry Grace of State;</L>
<L>Wisdom and Bounty sweet on <HI>Rutland</HI> sit,</L>

<L>BUT say, whence liberal Arts thus feel Decay?</L>
<L>Why melt their Charms, like Fairy Towers, away?</L>
<L>Not Ignorance, oppos'd, their Strength impairs,</L>
<L>They break, they perish by intestine Jars.</L>
<L>Artists on Artists scoul with jealous Eyes,</L>
<L>And Envy Emulation's place supplies.</L>
<L>With <HI>Envy's</HI> Influence the dark Bosom's fraught,</L>
