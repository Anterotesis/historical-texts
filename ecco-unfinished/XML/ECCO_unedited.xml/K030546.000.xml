<STAGE>Enter <HI>ADELINE,</HI> in Mens Cloaths.</STAGE>
<P>HEIGHO!—six dark and weary miles, and not yet at the camp; how tediously affliction traces.—Come, Gregory, come on, why how you lag behind: poor simple soul, what cares has he to weigh him down?—Oh, yes, he has served me from my cradle, and his plain honest heart feels for his mistress's fallen fortunes, and is so heavy.—Come, my good old fel∣low, come.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Six—sixteen, if we've gone an inch; my feet are cut in pieces. A man may as well do pe∣nance with peas in his shoes as trudge over these con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded roads in Northumberland. I used to wonder
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
when we were at home in the South, where it is as smooth as a bowling-green, what the labourers did with the loose stones they carried off the highways.—But now I find they come and shoot their rubbish in the northern countries. I wish we had never come into 'em, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are weary of my service—you wish you had not followed me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, I—Heaven forbid! I'd follow you to the end of the world;—nay, for the matter of that, I believe I <HI>shall</HI> follow there: for I have tramp'd after you a damn'd long way without knowing where we are going. But I'd live—aye and <HI>die</HI> to serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, we must to the wars, my good Gregory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wars! O Lord, that' s taking me at my word with a vengeance—I never could abide fighting, there's something so plaguey quarrelsome in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you had best return. We now, Gre∣gory, are approaching King Henry's camp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are we—O dear, O dear! pray then let's make off as fast as we can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you observe the lights breaking thro' the tents yonder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me—they are tents sure enough. Come, Madam, let's wheel about, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, whither should I go, poor simpleton? my house is wretchedness—The wars I seek have made it so—they have robb'd me of my husband—comfort now is lost to me, My very children, whose pretty frolic round our hearth, charm'd even time and made the lagging winter's night fly swift as lover's meet∣ings—even they make my heart bleed if they but smile on me—I kiss them thro' my tears, and sigh that they have lost a father. Oh Gondibert, too faithful to weak cause—our ruin is involved with our betters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, rot the cause! say I—plague on the house of Lancester, it has been many a noble gentle∣man's undoing: the white and red roses have caused more eyes to water in England than if we had planted the whole island with onions. Such a coil kept up with these two houses—one's so old, and t'other's so old, they ought both to be pull'd down, for a couple of nuisances to the nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace! peace! man—half such a word tho' spoken at random might cost your life—the times, Gregory, are dangerous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true indeed, Madam; Death has no modesty in him now-a-days; he stares every body full in the face. I wish we had kept quiet at home out of his way: who knows but my master, Lord Gondi∣bert, might have return'd too as unexpectedly as he went—I'm sure he left us unexpectedly enough, for the deuce of any notice did he give us of his going.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Gregory, was it not unkind—and yet I will not call him so—the times are cruel—not my husband—his affection had too much thought in it to change—his regular love corrected by the steady vigour of his mind knew not the turbulence of boyish raptures; but like a sober river in its banks flowed with a sweet and equal current. Oh it was such a placid stream of tenderness!—How long is it since your master left us, Gregory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Six months come to morrow, Madam—I caught a violent cold the same day; it has settled in my eyes I believe, for they have been troublesome to me ever since.—Ah! I shall never forget that mor∣ning when the spies of the house of York, that's got upon the throne, surrounded him for being an old friend to the Lancasters. Egad he laid about him like a lion, and with his broad-sword, whack, he comes me one over the sconce. Pat he goes me another over the cheek—and after putting 'em all out of breath,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
about he wheels his horse, and we have never seen or heard of him since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from that day to this I have in vain cherish'd hopes of his return—fearful, no doubt, of being surprised, he keeps conceal'd; thus is he torn from me—torn from his children—from tender blos∣soms too weak to be expos'd to the rude tempests of the times, and leaves their innocence unsheltered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and mine among the rest—But what is it you mean to do, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>To seek him in the camp—the Lancasters again are making head here in the north. If he has had an oppotunity of joining them, 'tis more than probable he is in their army—neither will we, and for this purpose have I doff'd my woman's habit—leaving my house to the care of a trusty friend—and thus ac∣coutred have led you, Gregory, the faithful follower of my sorrows, a weary journey half over England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Weary, oh dear—no, not, at all—I cou'd turn about again directly, and walk back brisker by half than I came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, man! afraid? Come, come, we run but little risque—example too will animate us—the very air of the camp, Gregory, will brace your cou∣rage to the true martial pitch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be, Madam; and yet for a brac∣ing air, people are apt to die in it sooner than in any other place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, prithee, man, put but a confident look on the matter, and we shall do I warrant—a bluff and blustering outside often conceals a chicken heart—mine achs I'm sure, but I'll hide my grief under the veil of airy carelessness—Down, sorrows, I'll be all bustle like the occasion.—Come, Gregory, now I must be the petulant <HI>military</HI> stripling—Mark your mistress, man, and learn—see how she'll play the part of a young soldier.</P>

<P>Well, if I must go, I must; I can't help following my Adeline—affection has led many a bolder man by the nose than I;—I wonder though how your bold fellows find themselves just before they are going to fight;—I wonder if they have an uncomfortable sort of sticking in the throat, and a queer kind of a cold tickling in some part of the flesh. Oh, Gregory, Gregory Gubbins! your peaceable qualities will never do in a camp—I never could bear gunpowder since I got fuddled at the fair, and the boys ty'd crackers under Dobbin's tail in the market place.</P>

<P>Morrow to you, Mr. Tooting, a merry day-breaking to your worship.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fife.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sad head-breaking, I fancy, plaguy trou∣blesome times brother, buffeted by the opposite party out of one place, and now waiting till they come to buffet us out of another. Whenever they do come, let me tell you, a man will scarce have time to get up from his straw bed before he's laid down again by a long shot of the enemy, we shall be popp'd at like a parcel of partridges rising from stubble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, what signifies taking matters to heart, luck's all—war's a chance you know—if one day's bad another's better—what matters an odd drub∣bing or so? a soldier should never grumble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why zounds, flesh and blood nor any thing that belongs to a camp can't help it—do now, only give your drum a good beating and mind what a damn'd noise it will make—not grumble, when we take so many hard knocks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drum.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure, else how should we be able to return 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there stands the case, we never can return 'em, others now can have a blow, and give a blow, but as for me and yourself, and Kit Crackcheeks, the trumpeter—od'sbud, they may thump us from morning till night, and all the revenge we have, is toot a toot, dub a dub, and tantarara.</P>

<SPEAKER>Drum.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie, learn to know our consequence bet∣ter, brother, I beseech you: My word for it, we are the heroes that do all the execution—who but we, keep up the vigour of an engagement, and the courage of the soldiers. Fear, brother, is for all the world like your bite of a tarantula, there's no conquering its effects without music. We are of as much conse∣quence to an army, as wind to a wind-mill. The wings can't be set in motion without us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, that's true, and if two armies ever meet without coming to blows, nothing but our ab∣sence can be the occasion of it, the only way to restore true harmony is, to take away our music.</P>

<P>No matter—mum—only when the business is over with you, and you are all stiff in the field—do me the credit to say, I was the first that told you it wou'd happen. I Alexander Puff, corporal to king Henry the sixth, heavens bless him! in his majesty's camp at Hexham, in Northumberland.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, tho' they do muster strong, we may make Edward's party skip, if we have but justice on our side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Corp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Mr. Wiseacre—justice, no, no, might overcomes right now a-days, bully rebellion has almost frightened puny justice out of her wits, and when she ventures to weigh causes, her hand trem∣bles so, that half the merits tumble out of the scale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still I say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Corp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, say no more, but take care of yourself in the battle: that's all, s'blood if the enemy were to find your little taper dry carcase pink, full of round holes, they'd mistake you for your own fife—but re∣member this, my lads, Edward of York has again shov'd king Henry from his possessions, and squatted his own usurping beggarly galligaskins in the clean seat of sovereignty. Here are we, brave fellows of Hexham, come to place him on the stool of repen∣tance—and, there's our king at the head of us—and there's his noble consort, the sword and buckler,

Queen Margaret—and there's the Lord Seneschal of Normandy—and the Lord Duke of Somerset and the lord knows who. The enemy are at hand with a thumping power—So up courage and to loggerheads we go for it.—Huzza for the red rose and the house of Lancaster.</P>

Truly for a fool of experience I have but little wisdom, and yet a camp suits well with my humour—take away the fighting—the sleeping in a field—the bad fare—the long marches, and the short pay, and a soldier is a rare merry life!

<P>Now, then to a business of greater import.—I have been lurking about the camp here on the skirts of the forest—the parties met, and a hot battle ensued. It was a long time fought with such stub∣born courage, that as I stood observing it, the spirit of war, pent up within me, had well nigh burst my breast—twenty times I was on the point of breaking from my shelter and joining combat, but I am pledg'd to you, my fellows—that thought restrain'd me.</P>

<P>It may be so: you all, I know, will expect a rich booty, and those whom we shall meet, will pro∣bably, from the unsettled nature of the times, bear their whole wealth about their persons; but they are brave and have been oppress'd—disapointment there∣fore, and their situation may cause'em▪ to fight in their defence like heroes.</P>

<P>Oh this world, this world!

<P>Yes, but he has plaguey damp sheets for all that—I'd exchange all the turf and sky in the country, for a good barn and blanket, and as for the cooing∣doves, I wou'd not give a crack'd tester, for a forest full of 'em, unless I cou'd see some of their claws stuck up thro' the holes of a brown pie-crust.</P>

<P>Why, we are out of the fire to be sure; but make the best we can on't, we are still in the frying-pan—and starving is one of those blessings, for which people are not very apt to be thankful—but we have escap'd a killing—so i'll e'en be content as long as there's comfort in companion—I stumbled over a fat trumpeter in the field, stript and plunder'd, with his skin full of bullets—well, I'm thankful yet—mine's a marvellous happy lot to be better than a dead trum∣peter.</P>

<P>Here's a simple change in a man's fortune! now might I, when I say 'tis he, were it not as plain 'tis he as a nose is a nose—swear that my eyes were putting a lie in my mouth, in very spite of my teeth. Gad a man might to near to think that one of the thieves had robb'd my lord of his person, and was wearing it out, that his own might lie by. Oh, the quiet comfortable days that I shall see again!—Mercy on me! 'tis enough to make a coward tremble to think on the battles my valour has been put to.—Nothing now again but old fare—old rubbing of spoons, and a cup of old sherry behind the old pan∣try-door, to comfort my old nose in a cold frosty morning.</P>
