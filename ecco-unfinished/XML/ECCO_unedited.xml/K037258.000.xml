<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following INTERLUDE was
prepared for the Stage, merely
with a View of assisting Mrs.
<HI>Pritchard</HI> at her Benefit; and the Desire
of serving so good an Actress, is a better
Excuse for its Defects, than the few
Days in which it was written, and repre∣sented.
Notwithstanding the favourable
Reception it has met with, the Author
would not have printed it, had not his
Friend, Mr. <HI>Hogarth,</HI> flattered him most
agreeably, by thinking <HI>The Farmer and
his Family</HI> not unworthy of a Sketch of
his Pencil. To Him, therefore, this
Trifle, which he has so much honoured,
is inscribed, as a faint Testimony of the
sincere Esteem which the Writer bears
him, both as a <HI>Man</HI> and an <HI>Artist.</HI></P>
