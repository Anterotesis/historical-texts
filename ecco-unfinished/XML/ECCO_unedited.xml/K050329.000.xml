<P>REASONS
AGAINST
FIGHTING.
BEING
An ENQUIRY into this Great
<HI>Debate,</HI> Whether it is Safe for Her
MAJESTY, or Her MINISTRY,
to Venture an Engagement with
the <HI>FRENCH,</HI> considering the
Present Behaviour of the ALLIES.</P>
<P><HI>The Resolution of the</HI> House of Commons, <HI>on</HI> Wednesday,
May 28. 1712.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That this House hath an entire Confidence i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Her Majesties most Gracious Promise to communicate
to Her Parliament the Terms of the <HI>Peace</HI> before the
same shall be concluded; and that they will support Her
Majesty in obtaining an <HI>Honourable and Safe Peace,</HI> against
all such Persons, either at Home or Abroad, who have
endeavour'd, or shall endeavour, to obstruct the same.</P>
<P>Her Majesty's most Gracious Answer to this Resolution,
<HI>Friday, May</HI> 30. 1712.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI>
I thank you most Heartily for this Resolution, which is Dutiful
to Me, Honest to Our Country, and very Seasonable at this
Time, when so many Artifices are used to obstruct a <HI>Good
Peace,</HI> or to force one <HI>Disadvantageous</HI> to <HI>Britain.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REASONS
AGAINST
FIGHTING:
OR,
Some Account why the Confederates
could not expect the British Army
should join with them whenever
they thought fit to attack the
French.</HEAD>
<P>THE Town having been most ma∣liciously
amused with an Account
in a Printed Postscript, which, (as
it is there managed and related,) is calculated
to lay as much Reproach on the <HI>British</HI> Na∣tion,
and on Her Majesty, as is possible; it
cannot but be an acceptable Work to all
that have any Regard to the Honour of their
Countrey, or their Queen, to examine into
an Affair of such a Nature, and state the
same to the People, that they may not be
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
imposed upon by false Glosses, and malici∣ous
Constructions. In our first Entrance
into the Merits of this Cause, we shall save
a great deal of Fending and Proving about
the Matter of Fact, and therefore without
enquiring into the Truth of the Relation,
which is believed to be a meer Forgery of
the <HI>Scotchman</HI> who writes that Paper,
whose Talent of Lying is so well known to
Mankind; yet to deal the better with him
and his Party, we will for once suppose
here all his Relation to be right, and shall
argue from it as if it were so, (<HI>viz.) I am
no Braggadocio nor Gascon, but do assure you,
that I never promised myself more from a Day
of Battle than I did from this; and I prepared
myself to fight, when—refus'd to Second
me. I ask'd him, what he did there then? He
told me, he came to fight, but that he had re∣ceiv'd
Orders, which he shew'd me, not to act
offensively against the Army of</HI> France.</P>
<P>Supposing this then to be true, who are
they that make Complaint? This Author
says, <HI>many do;</HI> it is hoped it is not our good
Friends and Confederates the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Many
Reasons concur to move us to hope thus of
them: Principally that it was for some Ages
the Practice of that wise and wary People,
with us, and with all their Allies, it hath
been so often, and so loudly complained of
by the <HI>English</HI> Court in former Days, and
by their other Confederates that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
sent their Deputies into the Army to con∣troul
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
their Generals; and such fatal Effects
have been found to be the Consequence of
it, that surely it can never be the <HI>Dutch</HI> that
should complain of being abandoned, but
they should look back to their former Con∣duct
in the like Cases, of which the History
of those Days is full. If his Grace the Duke
of <HI>Marlborough</HI> pleaseth to give an Account
of the many Occasions in which this Con∣duct
of the States-General hath been fatal to
King <HI>William,</HI> in his Wars in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
there will be but too many Instances of the
like, more especially beginning at the
Siege of <HI>Bonne</HI> in the Year 1674, or there∣abouts.</P>
<P>If his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>
doth not think fit to give his Evidence in
this Case, the Opponents being at this Time
something Allied to his Grace's Interest,
there are not wanting living Witnesses to
prove it, when the States Field-Deputies
refused to let the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces fight, as
especially during the first Part of the late
War, at the Business of <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> at <HI>Beau∣mont,</HI>
before that at the long March to gain
the <HI>French</HI> Lines, when the late <HI>Dauphin</HI>
commanded the <HI>French</HI> Army; also at the
first Siege of <HI>Mons</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> at the
first Siege of <HI>Namure,</HI> and many more In∣stances
of like Nature: It was not without
very great Difficulty that the late King
<HI>William</HI> obtain'd so entire a Confidence to
be placed in him by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as to have
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
the Command of the Army compleatly in
himself. Soon as the King was dead, al∣though
they have committed the Command
of their Troops to the Duke of <HI>MarlBorough,</HI>
to Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and the like Great Gene∣rals,
yet is it plain it is all Subject, and un∣der
Orders, to the Five <HI>Dutch</HI> Field-Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ties,
who have their Voices in every Coun∣cil
of War; and who, though they have
no Command in the Army, yet have a
Universal Command over the whole Army.
Nor can the General Act, or March, much
less Fight, if they please to put in their Ne∣gative
at a Council of War. If it is al∣ledged
that they never gave their Negative
upon any probable Action, it shall be an∣swered
in many Particulars, but not to dis∣pute
that; it is certain they are empowered to
give a Negative most effectually, in Case
of which Negative the Troops would not
act, no although their General should
command them. And what shall we say,
that after and notwithstanding this, the
Queen should have less Authority to act than
the <HI>Dutch;</HI> that Her Majesty should not
have Power to prevent the Effusion of
Blood, when she may see the Conclusion of
a Peace so easie, if the Confederates would
hear Reason; that there should be no Ne∣cessity
of such a Butchery, as that of <HI>Blareg∣nies,</HI>
to gain perhaps the bare Retreat of the
<HI>French,</HI> and perhaps not that.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
But to wave that Part till afterward, and
return to what was mentioned before, after
the P—of <HI>O</HI>—was come to be ad∣vanced
to the <HI>British</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrones, and by his
Successes in <HI>England</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eland</HI> had made
himself more popular in <HI>Holland</HI> than before,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> finding also that the <HI>English</HI> were
ill satisfied with the Diffidence the States
had always shewn in the Trusts of their
Army, came at last into the Measures the
King had laid before them, and committed
their Forces to the King, with a Discretio∣nary
Power to Fight, or not to Fight, when
he thought fit. It should not be forgotten
that the States were moved to this, by see∣ing
the King at the Head of a Powerful
Army of his own Troops, entirely com∣manding
the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Armies;
and that if they should refuse to give up
their Troops to him, he would be in a Con∣dition
to sight the <HI>French,</HI> or undertake some
Siege without their Help that their Troops
would not only lose the Honour, but the
States themselves should be lessened in the
Figure they made in the Confederacy; that
as their Troops should perhaps be scarcely
in the Action, so neither would their Inte∣rests
be equally taken Care of in case of any
Advantages obtained. These, and many
more, were the Arguments which really
brought in the States-General to consent to
take off their Field-Deyuties from the Ar∣my,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
and leave the King entirely to act as he
should think fit.</P>
<P>Those People who remember any Thing
of what is behind them cannot forget how
great a Point it was thought gained when
the <HI>Dutch</HI> were brought to do thus; how
the Success, which was promised to Affairs,
encouraged the Parliament and People to go
on more warmly in the Prosecution of the
War, because the <HI>Dutch</HI> had now consent∣ed
to take away their Restraints: After the
Death of the King, as well when the Ar∣mies
were commanded by Monsieur <HI>Over∣kirk</HI>
as by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> himself,
the said <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies were replaced in
their Army; on all Occasions they were ad∣mitted
to sit in the Councils of War, and
if they did not give their Assent no Action
of Moment could be undertaken; farther,
the States have kept such a Negative upon
the Actions in the Field, as that even when
the Council of War have often resolved on
this or that, those Resolutions have been
first sent to the <HI>Hague</HI> for the Approbation
of the States themselves before they could be
put in Practice, though the Field-Deputies
have been consenting to it before in the
Army. Such hath been the Power the
States-General have always reserved in
their Hands to govern and restrain the Af∣fairs
of the Army and the War, by which,
in Effect, they had the Command of the
<HI>British</HI> Armies and Generals; the Queen
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
had the Name indeed of being at the Head
of the Confederacy, and had the Power to
put a General of Her own in the Command
over Her own Troops; but even Her Ma∣jesty,
and all Her Generals and Forces,
were so far under the Command of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and so far to be governed by the
Councils at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that nothing could
be done without first applying to the said
States, or their Deputies, for their Consent:
Thus we willingly submitted to having gi∣ven
ourselves up to <HI>Dutch</HI> Councils, it is
not to be wonder'd that this, and more,
was stooped to by such People as were come
into a State of Pupilage to the States; and
who left both the Direction of the War,
and the Management of the Peace, to them,
as if their own Nation had no Interest or
Concern in it, other than to receive their
Orders from their High Mightinesses:
Whether it is more wonderful that any Peo∣ple
should thus Sacrifice their Countries In∣terest
to a Selfish Neighbour, and with a
profound and implicit Submission should
give themselves over to the Management
of a Foreign Nation? Or that the same
People should now complain that Her Ma∣jesty
assumes a little Her Right of judging
when it is Right or Safe to hazard Battle,
or not, as well as the <HI>Dutch.</HI> It seems to some
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have taken this Part upon
them so long, that it should now be challeng∣ed
as their due; and that the Exclusion of the
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is most Righteous, that
the States alone should have a Negative Voice
in the Field▪ that the <HI>English</HI> Generals were
never to Fight but when the <HI>Dutch</HI> gave them
Leave, and were always to fight when they,
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> proposed it: It is counted as an
Aggravation in the present Case, that Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> was for Fighting the <HI>French,</HI> and to
Crown all, <HI>the</HI> Dutch <HI>Deputies had consented;</HI>
a Mighty Argument! What is the Infe∣rence?
Then it was a most Heinous Offence
that our General had not Orders to comply;
so that the <HI>British</HI> Forces must Bleed, and
Die, and March, and Fight, or lye Still,
just as Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Depu∣ties
think fit that whenever these, for the
carrying on their Separate Views, think fit
to attack the <HI>French</HI> Army, tho' entrench'd
up to the Teeth, fortified and posted to Ad∣vantage,
the <HI>British</HI> Troops, like Obedient
Slaves, must fall on with the greatest Ha∣zard;
for it is well known that Her Ma∣jesties
Troops are never failed of the Posts
of Danger, and the Hotest and most Despe∣rate
of the Service. On the other Hand,
if the Advantages which offer, however
great, are accepted by the <HI>British</HI> Generals,
unless the <HI>Dutch</HI> please to join their Assent:
Our Men can on no Account embrace the
Opportunity; there are Numberless Exam∣ples
of this Kind to be given but we esteem
it so known a Truth in the Army, and eve∣rywhere
else, that it is needless to mention
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
any more what is so Universally known: How
then comes it to be surprizing to the People
here that Her Majesty should, when she sees
Cause, assume that Authority in the Army
which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have so avowedly practised?
And why is not Her Majesty as much of
Right empowered to do this when her own
Affairs require it, as the States-General have
been when their Affairs have likewise re∣quired
it? Observe here, the Dispute in
this Part has no Relation to the Reasons
why Her Majesty declines hazarding a Bat∣tle
with the <HI>French;</HI> but to the Right Her
Majesty has when Her own Affairs make it
reasonable upon any Score to Fight, or not
to Fight, as She thinks fit.</P>
<P>Having thus made a Protest in Her
Majesty's Name for the Reservation to Her∣self,
the guiding of Her own Affairs, it
comes in order to examine the Case before
us, which has given so great an Occasion
of Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Queen has
given Orders to Her Generals not to Fight
with the <HI>French,</HI> or to undertake any Siege;
we shall be wary in saying that there might
be, or that there are, Reasons why it might
not be Safe for Her Majesty to hazard Her
Troops, and that there may be good
Reasons why, as Cases stand, the Queen
should not venture a Battle in Conjun∣ction
with the Allies, who are now in the
Field with Her: But this may be said Safely,
that whereas the Endeavours of a Party
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
among us to render the Ministry here, and
the Management of Affairs in the <HI>British</HI>
Court, suspected to the Allies, and that those
wicked Designs have had but too much
Success; so that great Misunderstandings,
scandalous Misrepresentations, and Inve∣ctives,
have too much supplied the Place
of the usual mutual Confidence and Affecti∣on
which was formerly established, and
ought now to have been cultivated between
Her <HI>Britannic</HI> Majesty and Her Allies; it
cannot be supposed that in this Case the same
Harmony, the same Unity, the same Con∣fidence,
could be between them as it were
to be wished; and therefore while that
Confidence on both Sides hath been so Art∣fully
lessened it cannot be expected, espe∣cially
by that Side, who have so openly
profest their Jealousie and Dissatisfaction,
that the other should with the like Freedom,
as on former Occasions, hazard with them
in so Nice and so Critical an Affair as that
of a General Battle.</P>
<P>This is not all, but it is not unknown of
what Consequence the least Blow or Disap∣pointment
in Case of Action might be to
Her Majesty's Affairs; the Party here have
not been silent in their Malicious Expecta∣tions,
and have not scrupled to let us know
that they had some Hopes in a Disappoint∣ment;
they have been heard to say that
One Defeat of the Army, One Battle in the
Field, would ruin the present Ministry, and
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
fright the Queen into other Measures: As these
are the known Hopes of this Party, and that
the Secret Correspondence between them,
and some Leading Men Abroad, who have
it much in their Power to do either Good
or Hurt in a Day of Battle, is also known,
it may not be an ill-grounded Caution, that
we should be backward to hazard a Battle
with the Enemy, while in Conjunction with
some who entertain a strict Confederacy with
that Party here, who own, as above, that
their Hopes are founded upon a Supposition
of the Army receiving a Defeat Abroad: It
is suggested that this is Supposititious, that
no such Thoughts have been entertain'd
here, and that our Confederates are not
capable of entertaining any Thing so Disho∣nourable,
nor could practise the Thing
without Ruin and Destruction to them∣selves:
This may have many Answers to it,
all of them significant of the Thing, and
justifying the Conduct of a Nation in such
a Case. 1. That if these People here have
no such Thoughts, as perhaps some among
them may abhor so wicked a Practice;
but why do they speak it in their own Dis∣course?
Why do they please themselves
with the talking of it? Do their Tongues
speak what their Hearts never thought?
It may be too true of them, that they think
little, and might talk of small matters with∣out
Meaning, but Capital Mischiefs never
hang on the Tongue but when they are
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
dictated from the Heart; why should they
talk thus? Would they be thought more
Wicked than they are? Or would they talk
what they did not intend, on Purpose, and
with Design, to make themselves be suspect∣ed?
Have we not heard them in the Public
Coffee-houses say on the last Proclaimed Fast
that they did not know how to keep it,
that they did not know whether they should
pray for Success upon our Armies, yea,
or no? Or whether it were not as good that
we should be beaten Abroad, that it might
bring us to our Senses at Home; that One
Battle lost would ruin the Ministry, and
blow them all up, and such Talk as this; nay,
have we not many so far exasperated, that
will stop their Ears, or sit down in the midst
of the Public Prayers, when the Minister
is praying for the best of Blessings upon the
Queen, and for Success to Her Majesty's
Forces both at Sea and Land? They treat
Her Majesty with more Freedom in their
Cups, and long ago have they left off Tost∣ing
a Health to the Generals, or Success to
our Arms; while this Principle prevails, let
any one judge whether it is Safe for us to
venture an Engagement, tho' with an Ene∣my
less Considerable, and less Dangerous,
than the <HI>French,</HI> while thus Circum∣stanc'd
at Home, and while these People
boast of their strict Alliance, and close
Friendship Abroad, with such People, up∣on
whose Conduct the Sum of Affairs very
much depends.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
This is not to be construed as a Reflecti∣on
on the Fidelity of the Allies, or a De∣claration
that there is any such Thing as a
Distrust on the Part of the <HI>British</HI> Court of
the Justice or Faithfulness of the Confede∣rates▪
but it must be acknowledged by any
unbya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Judgment that these People have
done what is <HI>their possible</HI> to create such a
Jealousie: After such Notices of their
Minds at Home, and Boasts of their In∣fluence
Abroad, a Ministry, less wary,
and less penetrating, than ours, might be well
justified in resolving to Risque nothing with
them: This is most sure, that they would
be most inexcusable, who after such Warn∣ings
should venture a Thing of so great a
Consequence as a Battle, on a Disappoint∣ment
wherein they had an Assurance that
so much of the Hopes of their Enemies
did depend. History might be brought to
give Evidence in this Case, where in Affairs
less Critical than these Cautions have been
taken, and Measures of Safety pursued, on
the least Discovery of the Secret Designs of
Parties among the Confederate Troops.</P>
<P>It may be needful to say something here
to the Objection following, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
this cannot be Rational to suspect, because
it cannot be practised but at the Ruin of
the Confederates: But many Instances
have been given in the World of Armies
driven to Exigences, by being deserted or
forsaken in the Time of Action by their
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Friends, without giving the Enemy Oppor∣tunity
to break in upon the Parties who have
so for saken them, of any where to hurt them:
There have not wanted Instances of this,
even between the same Parties we are speak∣ing
of, when in the Sea-fight between the
Confederate Fleet and the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, off
of <HI>Beachy-Head,</HI> in the Year 1690, when the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Admirals complained of their being
forsaken and betrayed by the <HI>English</HI> Ad∣mirals,
and left to the Mercy of the <HI>French</HI>
Fleet, while the <HI>English</HI> made their Retreat
in the best Manner they could, that by this
Means the <HI>English</HI> Navy were preserved,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> were defeated, great part of
their Squadron burnt and destroyed, or
taken by the <HI>French,</HI> and the rest of the
Fleet, being <HI>English,</HI> made off: This
was afterwards brought before the King,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirals complaining,
threatned, that unless they had Satisfaction
they would never hazard a Fight in Con∣ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction
with the <HI>English</HI> any more.</P>
<P>This is brought but as a parallel Case,
for upon Examination no Treachery was
found in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase at all, but the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Admiral thought the Inequality too
great to venture a general Engagement;
likewife in this Case we may be justly said
to be Uneasie, and not think ourselves Safe,
while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isunderstandings and Jealousies are
fomented between us and our Allies: Whe∣ther
we are really dissatisfied in the Fideli∣ty
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
of the Parties, or no; but be those Dis∣satisfactions
of what Kind soever, it cannot
be Prudence for us to run the Hazards that
in other Cases might be done.</P>
<P>But to leave this ungrateful Part of the
Subject, it is not said, or suggested
here, that any Design was formed that
might look like abandoning, or betraying,
yet do many other Circumstances concur to
make it reasonable that they should not
Fight; that it is Her Majesty's Desire, and
also the Desire of all Her Faithful Subjects,
that a Good and Lasting Peace should be
made, has been openly declared; what else
has a Negotiation been set on Foot for?
Her Majesty has other Work to do in the
World than to amuse the Nations Abroad,
or Her Subjects at Home, with a Treaty,
if a Peace had not been Her Design: This is
not a Thing to be dallied with, if the Pious
and Christian Design of the Queen meets
with Opposition from Parties, whose Views
are known to be the Confusion of their
Country, yet Her Majesty persists in Her
Resolutions of making Peace: This brings
us Home to the Teeth of the Party, and
will expose their Scandalous Practices, and
they may value themselves upon it when
they please, it will be but shewing their
own Nakedness to Posterity.</P>
<P>Her Majesty having, with mighty
Struggling and Opposition, obtained a
Treaty, and Plenipotentiaries from most of
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
the Confederates to meet for that Purpose▪
New Intrigues were immediately set or
Foot to render all the Meetings and Confe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rences
on the Grand Affair Abortive, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to come to nothing; to this Purpose, and
the Measures for it being concerted, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Emperor on a sudden sends his Plenipoten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiaries
to the Congress, which he had re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solved
never to do before; it is to be
observed, that no sooner were those Pleni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>potentiaries
arrived, but a New Scene be∣gan
to appear, and a different Part was
acted from what they were acting before▪
for as they answered <HI>Cavaillierly,</HI> that they
would never send any Ministers to the
Meeting, or take any Notice of it, all on a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sudden they were not only come to the
Congress, but New Conferences, and New
Measures, appear'd; the Imperial Mini∣sters
were every Day at the <HI>Hague,</HI> there
they conferr'd singly with other People▪
immediately the Subject of the Peace be∣came
the Jest of the Place: The Earl of
<HI>Strafford,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> Envoy and Plenipo∣tentiary,
was Treated after a different and
uncommon Manner, and all the Councils
the Gentlemen had on that Affair discover∣ed
an Inclination rather to prevent than
promote a Peace, as the properest Scheme to
carry on the Designs of their Party, which
could not stand, or hope for it, but by
carrying on the War.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Thus they put off the Time, and sus∣pended
the Prosecution of the Peace, as
if they had a Certainty that the Armies
would join, that the Campaign would
begin, and so the Treaty would be cut
in Two by the Sword; believing that if
they could get the Two Armies into
Action the Treaty would of Course be
broken off.</P>
<P>Now Her Majesty disappointed them
All by coming to this Happy Resolu∣tion,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) “If ye will not treat of Peace,
neither will I carry on the War; if all
that can be expected by the War may
be obtained by a Treaty of Peace, I
cannot satisfie myself to let any more
Blood be shed when it may upon so good
Grounds be prevented; therefore I shall
order my Army and my Generals to act
on the Defensive only till you can give

War.”</P>
<P>All this is said upon a Supposition that
what the Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dalous S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribler of false
News hath Printed. But can any Man
believe the Account? Is it Rational
to think that Prince <HI>Engene</HI> is so lit∣tle
a Man of Breeding as to give the
<HI>British</HI> General such Language? Ought
not the Writer of such News to be
brought to the Whipping-Post for thus
abusing Prince <HI>Eugene?</HI> Is it in the
least likely that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> would
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
have asked the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> so
Insolent a Question on his giving his
Opinion against Fighting, as, <HI>What do
you do here then?</HI> Every General has his
Liberty in the Council of War to give
his Opinion to what shall be there pro∣pos'd
for or against Fighting: Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> would not have made that Re∣ply
to any Private Colonel, as to say,
<HI>What do you do here then?</HI> But had not his
Grace many a ready Answer to have re∣turned
to such an Insult as that? Might
he not have said, “That the Troops of his
Mistress were there, and had been there
Nine Year, to give his Master a Crown,
which he had neither Ability to gain
without them, nor Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ude to acknow∣ledge
to his Benefactress now he had got
it?” Might he not have replied, They were
to fight when they saw Occasion, but
not like Auxiliaries, to fight at his bid∣ding?
Might be not have said, They
were there to fight when Probable Oc∣casions
presented, and when Evident Ad∣vantage
presented, but not <HI>Alamode de
Blaregnies,</HI> to sacrifice the Lives of a Brave
Body of Men to the Glory of a Gene∣ral,
and to butcher their Men for the
meer Name of a Victory, as was
done at <HI>Malplacquet?</HI> Many more Just
Returns might have been given to a
Sarcasm, so Haughty and so Rude as
that; but our General contented him∣self
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
to give no other Reply than to shew
his Orders; and this may be a very
good Reason for any Wise Men to be∣lieve
no such Affront was offered to him;
for all that know the Duke know this
of him, that he does not want Fire in his
Temper to resent such an Affront.</P>
<P>But here it is fit that we observe how
Villainous the Party Her Majesty has to
do with at Home are in their very Na∣ture,
who rather than not form something
to enflame their Party, will publish such
gross Forgeries, and put Affronts of the
Grossest Nature upon their own Friends,
and Men of the Greatest Rank in the
World: It is also the kindest and best
Construction that can be put upon this
Affair, to say that it is a Forgery of the
News-writers here, set on Work by a
Party who have Designs against the Queen's
Interest, and that of her Allies also; for
if it were true in Fact, if Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>
did actually Send such a Message to the
Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> or ask him such a
Question upon his giving his Opinion a∣gainst
attacking the <HI>French.</HI> is it not a
very good Reason why Her Majesty should
give such Orders? Is it not high Time
the Queen should be Mistress of Her own
Troops, and of Her own Part in the
War also? Indeed had there been no o∣ther
Dispute or Dissatisfaction between them
before, yet such a Passage happening, the
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> ought never to have
encamped in one Line with them after
it. This proves to any Considering Per∣son
to what a Degree of Subjection to our
Haughty Allies the Ministry of late
Years had brought our Affairs, and how
till now we were to be called out when∣ever
the Hirelings of the Foreign Prin∣ces
pleas'd to demand it, and to attack
at whatever Expence of Blood, and with
whatever Disadvantage. Nothing can be
a greater Justification to the Measures now
taking than the Insolence of the Allies to
us, not on this Occasion only, but on
many other Occasions, and also of the
dangerous Correspondence carry'd on be∣tween
some People Abroad, whose Obli∣gations
to Her Majesty call for other Things
from them; and a Party at Home, who
avowedly espouse and justifie the giving
us all into the Hands of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and
that we are not to be trusted with our
own Peace, but ought to take it at a Se∣cond
Hand, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> please to make
it for us. Will any contend that we
should not now open our Eyes, and that
we should not now act by our own Coun∣cils?
Will they still suppose us in our
Non-age and Pupil-age, that we must be
led about Blindfold, and be made Tools
and Engines to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Avarice and
<HI>Imperial</HI> Ambition? The Party here, to
cover the Eyes of their Followers, have
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
now taken a New Course in this Matter,
to sti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le ad Compiain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s against our Allies,
and to make is Obvious so much as to
compla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or of the hardest
and most unjust Treatment from them,
or from any other of the Allies; they
are Industrious to spread Reports that
Her Majesty seeks Occasions against the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and that we are all driving into
a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as if we could be
in no Alliance with them, but such
a one in which they must be allowed to
give the Law to our Conduct, and make
their Markets of us, by putting the most
Shameful Tricks upon us, and managing
us to gain on their Crutches, or rather
carry them on our Shoulders; this has
been no New Practice; some Men had
Eyes to see it before, tho' now 'tis con∣fest
it becomes more undeniably Public
by their own Usage of the <HI>British</HI> Nation,
according to the following Lines out of
a Ballad of their own making, at the
Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI>
played as many false Cards as they have
done now.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Whigs lately put out the Nation to Nurse,</L>
<L>With an Old Wooden Leg and a Crutch,</L>
<L>And to teach us to Go, ty'd our <HI>Leading-strings</HI> too,</L>
<L>And gave them to hold to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></L>

<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
<L>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> as who would not, that understood

<L>And as we grew weak, they doubled our Pack,</L>

<P>This is the true State of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nagement,
which many People, who for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merly

here with their Friends at the <HI>Hague▪</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this brings us back to the Treaty of Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and the Conduct of the Party in <HI>Engla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
It is mentioned above how when the Im<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rialists
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
found a Treaty of Peace unavoida∣ble,
and that Her <HI>Britannic</HI> Majesty prest
it so earnestly, that it would go on without
them, if they did not think fit to come in;
they at last complied, and how, after their
having so complied their Application,
turn'd immediately to counter-act the Pro∣gress
of the Treaty, that so, tho' they could
not interrupt the beginning, they might
disappoint the end of a Treaty, and bring
on the War by the necessary Consequence;
what were the Measures they took to bring
this to pass is obvious to every ordinary
View; and how far they obtain'd their
End, as they thought, is evident also; the
Armies being already in the Field, while
the Negotiations at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> were at a full
stand, by the insisting upon Answers in
writing from the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries,
instead of entring into a Treaty by Confe∣rence,
as was first intended; during the
whole Negotiation at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> the Parties
in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Holland</HI> spread about Re∣ports,
and positively affirmed, that the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Court had made a Separate Peace with
<HI>France;</HI> and even the <HI>Memorials</HI> from some
of the Foreign Ministers signified as much;
the Party from hence assur'd them Abroad
so constantly of it, that all Means possible
were made use of to put a Stop to the Ne∣gotiations,
that they might bring the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Ministers Abroad to declare themselves;
but they were too penetrating for the other
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
to break into their Councils, till the other
thought of this Experiment, which, as a
Great Man among the Party here said,
could not fail, and this was their last Resort,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the Armies should join, and that
a Motion should be made, whatever the Po∣sture
of Affairs might be, to attack the
<HI>French</HI> Army in their Camp, and force them
to a Battle; then, said they, you produce
the desired Effect, let it fail either Way;
for if the <HI>British</HI> General Fights, we shall
either Conquer or be Defeated, if we Con∣quer
the Treaty of Peace is at End, if we
are Defeated the Ministry in <HI>England</HI> are
Ruined, and so we shall Conquer that
Way. On the other Hand, if the <HI>British</HI>
General will not Fight then they discover
themselves that they have made a Se∣parate
Peace; that these have been the
Methods of the Party, and the Steps they
have taken, they may deny if they think
fit; but the publishing them here will serve
to convince them that their Measures are
not quite so Impenetrable, or their private
Resolves so well Concerted and Concealed,
as they slatter themselves to believe.</P>
<P>Now it may appear also, that altho' these
Things promised a sure Event equal to the
Expectation of the Contrivers, yet their Po∣liticks
have failed at this Time, the <HI>British</HI>
Councils have thought fit to countermine all
this Plot; First, they have not been so
<HI>Dupe</HI> as to be drawn into the Snare of Fight∣ing,
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
and engage the Enemy with a Confe∣deracy,
who had some Views which made
it less Essentaial than at another Time,
whether they were Victors, or not: Here
the Match was not equal; for the Victory
only was the <HI>British</HI> General's Safety, the
only Security of his Mistress, the Queen,
and of the whole Nation▪ whereas a Defeat,
however fatal to us, was not entirely with∣out
some Prospects that render'd it less
fatal in its Consequences to some People than
at other Times; for, fay these Men, one
Blow would Ruin all the New Scheme, and
Restore Affairs, set up the Old Ministry
again, and break all the Measures of the
<HI>British</HI> Court. This is the Foundation up∣on
which, as is said, some were so open to
say, “They knew not how to keep the Fast
that was appointed by Her Majesty for the
Success of the War, for they did not know
whether they had best pray for Victory or
no;” nay, a known Citizen of <HI>London,</HI>
whose Name is no Secret, was pleased to say
openly, “He did not know but that if we
were a little beaten it might be for our Good
at this Time;” let any one that knows and
sees these Things, judge Impartially, whe∣ther,
while such a Temper is reigning a∣mong
us, it would consist with the Wisdom
and Penetration of Her Majesty and Her
Council to venture a Battle, either as joined
with such Allies Abroad, or surrounded
with such Private Enemies at Home, but by
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
the Wisdom of the <HI>British</HI> Councils we have
countermined this Plot; and now they find
themselves all disappointed, for they can
neither bring the Army to run Headlong
into an Engagement, nor have they yet
made themselves Masters of our Measures;
this Wisdom however they have learn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by
it, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>British</HI> Affairs are no
more in Foreign Management; that if
they will end the War Honourably, and
make a Firm, Lasting, Peace, they may
have the Concurrence of the <HI>British</HI> Court
for the Advantage of all their Interests,
and for the procuring to them a Just and
Reasonable Satisfaction; but that the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Nation are not to be Bullied into the
War, as another said the Emperor would
not be Bullied into the Peace.</P>
<P>There are the true Plans of this Affair,
and now it seems as if they are come to
such a Head, that they must be brought
to an Issue one Way or other; the <HI>British</HI>
Court have desired a Fair Treaty, that an
Honourable Peace might be obtained for
all Parties▪ the Obstinacy of a few encou∣couraged
from hence, and prompted at
<HI>Vienna,</HI> have done their utmost to prevent
that Peace being General; and as if they had
insulted our Court upon it, they had brought
it to this Point, which was spoken openly at
the <HI>Hague;</HI> “We will take Care they shall
not make a General Peace, and let them
make a Separate Peace if they dare: If they
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
have now push'd on that Notion so far as
they can, should <HI>Great-Britain</HI> make such a
Peace as Her own Safety requires, they
may see Cause to blame themselves; for
tho' the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has been
very far from desiring to make Her own
Peace exclusive from Her Allies, yet no
good Subject of Her Majesty can patiently
hear the Tools of the present Parties, or
the Emissaries of those who oppose this
Peace, insult Her as being afraid to se∣cure
Herself and Her own People: If a Sepa∣rate
Peace shall be the Result of the Obsti∣nacy
of those whose Interests are made
wilfully to oppose Her Majesty, the Conse∣quences
lye at their Door; Her Majesty is
not to be insulted by Prince <HI>Eugen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or any
one else, as if She was afraid to pursue Her
own Measures, or afraid to own what She
has proposed: The Intrigue is of Necessity
to be now made Publick, the Measures
taken on both Sides will now appear, yea,
they do appear: The Plot is against a Peace;
not against this or that Condition of
Peace, but against Peace in General; the
Transaction is double, let us see the dark
Sides of both.</P>
<P>The Emperor is positive against a Peace,
his Reason is plain and undeniable; his is
the Gain of the War; all that hath been
fought for, or all that is contended for in
the War, or in the Peace, is for him: While
the Contention is carrying on, what is it he
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
possesses? He receives the whole Revenues of
the Electorate of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and of the Dutchy
of <HI>Mantua,</HI> the large Contributions levyed
upon the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Grand Duke
of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> many of the Territories of
the Pope, the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the other
Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> this he puts into the Impe∣rial
Treasury for the Support of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his War,
whilst yet it is depending; and all this is,
besides the Possession of such Parts of the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy as are obtaind for him,
with the Blood, and at the Expence, of the
Confederates; such are the Provinces of the
<HI>Low Countries,</HI> the Rich Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> the
Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Principality of <HI>Cata∣lognia,
&amp;c.</HI> except only the Expence of the Em∣peror
in gaining and maintaining the Possessi∣on
of the last of these Places. Two Things will
appear eviden tin this, in which the true Rea∣son
of the Emperors desiring the Continuance
of the War may be found. 1. That except
the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Conquests of
all those Countries are the Effect of the
Treasure, as well as Power, of the Confe∣derates,
and have been reduced chiefly at
their Expence. 2. That the prodigious Re∣venues
of those several Countries put much
more Money into the Coffers of the Em∣peror
than has been expended by him in
the Support of the War, (the present Year
excepted,) and has gone plenteously into
the Coffers of the great Officers, Courtiers,
and the great Army of Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndants, who
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
always hang on upon the Imperial Courts,
whose Voratious Avarice not the whole
Monarchy of <HI>Spain,</HI> no, or of the World,
can satisfie. This is that which has so
many Years been the Complaint of other
Nations as the true Reason why no Peace
could be made in <HI>Hungaria;</HI> not all the
Confederates could prevail by the most
pressing Importunities upon the Imperial
Court to grant Peace to the Poor Distressed
Protestants, because the Courtiers and
Clergy at <HI>Vienna</HI> had gotten such large
Possession of the Revenues and Estates of the
Malecontents, which they knew on the
close of the Troubles they must be obliged
to refund, and which they resolved never
to part with so long as they could be detain∣ed,
that the Miseries of that Countrey could
never find an End, but in Conquest and
Depopulation: And such hath been the
Devastation in that poor Kingdom, that
they have not now People left to fill and
cultivate the Land, in a Place, once the most
Populous Countrey of <HI>Europe,</HI> for which
Reason they now invite the Boors of
<HI>Suabia</HI> to go and settle there, that the
Landlords may have Tenants to occupy
their Lands: This is a most Remarkable
Event, a Thing no War with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urks</HI>
could ever bring to pass, altho' those Wars
are very Desolating also.</P>
<P>Come we next to the other Bran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the
Opposers of Peace, as such; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Party at Home here among ourselves; i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
needeth very little Cunning to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
or Penetration to dive, into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Reasons of the Opposition made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Peace; that is to say, the violent Oppo∣sition
of Parties; the Case is so Nak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
any Eye may see it; the Dispute here is
all for Management and Superiority; the
New Ministry propose putting an End to
the War; the Outed Party see, that if
the Peace is made the New Ministry will
be established by that Means, and be be∣yond
the Power of them and their Interest
to shake them; they apply therefore with
all their Might to oppose a Peace, as that
in which they find the Ruin of their Party
infallibly contained.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Opposers of Peace are un∣derstood
of those who oppose it not on
Account of the Conditions, but as a Peace;
the other Allies, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> the Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the King of <HI>Partugal,</HI> &amp;c. these
are supposed only to have their Views at
the Conditions on which a Peace may
be obtained, such as the Possession of a
Barrier in <HI>Flanders,</HI> a Tariff of Trade,
and the like, for the <HI>Dutch;</HI> the Recovery
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and Security of the Posts and
Vallies to the <HI>Savoyard;</HI> the Articles of
the late Treaty, and the Affairs of <HI>Brasil</HI>
to the <HI>Portugal;</HI> these Things granted,
these Allies would be soon reconciled to
a Peace, not regarding who, or by what
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
lands it was made; but with the other
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is not so: The strict and newly settled
Confederacy between the former Poten∣tate,
and a Party here, has no Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficulty
in it, after the Reasons why they respe∣ctively
are obliged to oppose all Peace,
as such, are thus examined; if there is any
Thing W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>derful in the Conjunction, it
must be to see a Sovereign Court of the
First Magnitude, a Head, containing the
First Figure in the Christian World, stoop∣ing
to concert Measures with a Faction,
and to support a Disaffected Party, whose
Views are not only contemptible, but
are obnoxious to, and the Aversion of,
their Sovereign; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omenting a Distracted,
Outed, and Desperate Party, against their
Prince, and against a Prince to whom the
said Court are under Insinite Obligations;
to whose Kindness and Generosity the
Emperor very much owes the Crown
he enjoys. This may give some Surprize
to the World, though, as Things go
among some Confe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erated People, no∣thing
is to be esteemed Wonderful; nor
is there any Thing so strange in the World
but it may be expected from these People,
except it be that very N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w and Unknown
Thing, of which Authors have lately en∣deavoured
to make some Description,
called <HI>Imperial Grvtitude.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus a little enquired into the
several Circumstances, which have brought
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
the Publick Matters to their present State,
it will serve the better to explain the
other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Manag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which
remain: Can any wonder or reflect that
having to do with an enraged Faction,
and with Foreign Powers, who, how∣ever
differently moved, concur in project∣ing
the Destruction of their Countrey,
and aim at carrying on the War which
must end in the General Calamity; the
<HI>British</HI> Court should take Measures to de∣feat
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Danger us Principle, and to dis∣appoint
the Cruel and Bloody Projects of
those who value not the Blood of Millions
of People, so their private Interests and
Designs are carried on: To this Purpose,
finding the Opposition to all Publick Trea∣ties
carried on with so much Malicious Vi∣olence,
and a Confederacy of Interests op∣posing
the true In <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Her Majesty's
Subjects, it became absolutely necessary
to take such M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, as that the posi∣tive
Interest of <HI>Britain</HI> may be secured,
whether those People think sit to join, or
no; at the same Time actually doing Right
to the whole Confederacy, and leaving
them full Space to find their Account in it,
who are not infatuated by Heaven for their
own Punishment and Destruction: This,
however wholesome for the whole Body,
admitted not of being done so, as that
those, who, for the Reasons above, were
bent to circumvent and destroy all Attempts
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
towards healing the Wounds of <HI>Europe,</HI>
might be in a Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition to practice
upon it, as they had done before. This
the Party here make loud Complaints of,
and hence began the popular Reports,
and individuons Complaints, that there
was a Private Clandestine Treaty carried on
with <HI>France</HI> to the Prejudice of the Alliance,
and without the Concurrence of the Con∣federates,
contrary to the Grand Alliance,
and in Prejudice of the several Powers con∣cerned
in the War with <HI>France;</HI> whereas,
were this rightly examined, the Truth of
the Case is no more than this, that a Party
Prepossession being entred into the Heads of
those People, who ought to have been bet∣ter
Judges of the Publick Good, and almost
every Branch of the Confederacy having
in their Turn either acted in Prejudice of
the <HI>British</HI> Interest, or stood still, and suf∣fered
themselves to be made Parties to those
that did so, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
was obliged to take Her Interest, and that
of Her Kingdoms, into Her own Hands,
and having at the same Time a due Regard
to the Safety and Security of Her Allies,
and especially an exact Eye upon the Stipu∣lations
of Her Leagues and Confederacies
with others, to attempt by Herself the re∣storing
the Tranquility of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It is no more to be wonder'd at, that all
the Parties who having hitherto made their
Merchandise of this Nation, and who
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
thought we were the <HI>Dupes</HI> of their Pro∣jects
and Schemes, of whom they were still
to make Advantage, were secretly Nettled
and Restless when they saw themselves di∣vested
of the Influence they formerly had
over our Affairs, than it might be won∣der'd
at, that a Man having gain'd a great
Prize from another, should be unwilling
to part with it again; they had no Re∣course
but to Clamours and incessant Rail∣ing
at the <HI>British</HI> Management, unjustly
reproaching the Queen with having be∣tray'd
the Alliance, that is to say, having
rescued Herself and Her Nation from being
made a Prey to Ten Friends, under Pretence
of reducing One Enemy; it has been their
especial Grievance, that Her Majesty hath
been obliged, in Her own Defence, to ex∣pose
to the World the Scandalous Usage
She hath had from these Her Allies: Tne
Deficiency of their Quota's, the Fallacious
Construction of their several Conventions
and Agreements made for mutual Assist∣ance,
the Weak and Unjust Pretences they
have made use of to excuse or extenuate
their not supplying Money, Troops, Ships,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in due Proportions to what Her Majesty
has done; these Things they hoped to have
concealed, and to have thus carried on the
Game of the War to such length as might
have served their own Ends; in which it
appears too evident, that <HI>Britain</HI> had al∣ways
the labouring Oar, <HI>viz.</HI> the Expence
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
without the Advantage under this Usage,
the Government at present suffers, and the
Queen being happily restored to search the
Bottom of Things, and, as above, taking
the Management of Her own Peace into
Her own Hands, it is scarce Credible, nor
will Posterity believe it, what Treatment
Her Majesty meets with, as well from Her
Allies Abroad, as more especially from a
Furious and Raging Party at Home; what
Reproaches on Her Per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and on those
who are thought fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be entrusted in Her
Affairs; Ministers of State have often been
Maligned and Maltreated, and as often for
faithful doing their Duty as for any Thing;
but never were any treated like these;
never did any Prince bear such Indignities
in the Persons of Her Servants as Her Ma∣jesty
now does, and all this too upon bare
Supposition; before the Issue of Things is
brought on, before Things are come to Con∣clusions,
or the Matters of Fact appear.</P>
<P>The Design of this is rather to search in∣to
the Practice of the Enemies of our Peace,
than to vindicate Her Majesty, or Her Mi∣nistry;
they want no Aid of that Kind, the
Issue of Things will be their Vindication:
They go on steadily with their Designs in
Defiance of all these, giving us still Hopes
that all will issue in the Publick Good, and
in that Firm, Lasting, Peace which <HI>Europe</HI>
wants so much, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h these very Men
are to be happy in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much oppose
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
it, and malign the Government for endea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouring
to make it.</P>
<P>The Intrigues of these People bring us
down, as before, directly to the Case now
so exclaim'd against, <HI>viz.</HI>) the Queen ha∣ving
given Her Generals Order not to act
offensively against <HI>France;</HI> and what can the
Enemies of the Public Peace say to this? Had
not Her Majesty done this, all their Con∣trivances,
and all the Intrigues at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI>
the <HI>Hague,</HI> and elsewhere, had been
brought to Perfection, and their Plot had
had its desired Effect; it has all along ap∣pear'd
to those who have had the least
Power of searching into these Affairs, that
the Designs of those People, who pretend∣ed
to meet at a Treaty, were only to delay
and spin out the Negotiations in length,
loading the Treaties with Difficulties, and
starting unreasonable Scruples and Ob∣jections,
that the Season advancing, and
the Time for Action coming on, the Ar∣mies
might be in the Field, and the War
might have succeeded.</P>
<P>According to this Plot they went
on, they obtain'd to impose the De∣mand
of Answers in writing upon the
<HI>French,</HI> which they knew gave the usual
advantage to the Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, by which for∣mer
Treaties <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> just to a

have been
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>micably adjusted, and by which the Plenipote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iaries
might soonest have come into the Bottom
of the Respective Demands, and so have directly
treated on the Whole, by which a speedy Conclu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
might have been made, either for Peace or
War, which was the true Intent and Meaning
of Her Majesty in obtaining a Treaty: But these
People to whom the Thoughts of Peace was hate∣ful,
as the Thing itself appear'd Fatal to their Mea∣sures,
opposed all the Just Measures taken to bring
Things thus to a Conclusion, building all their
Hopes upon this Supposition, that if they could
bring the Armies to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ether, the War must go on of
Course; it is astonishing to think these People
should be so weak to believe that the Queen of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> should send Ministers of so little
Penetration to the Treaty, that they should not see
when they were thus trifled with; or that they
should think when it was seen, and discovered, Her
Majesty should not take effectual Measures to pre∣vent
them; that they should imagine that such
Dealing was not in the highest Manner disobliging,
and that when it should be discovered it would not
serve to open the Eyes of Her Majesty's Subjects, and
fill them with just Indignation at seeing their Sove∣reign,
and the whole Nation, in so gross a Manner
abused; but be that as it will, they have not,
Thanks be to God, found the <HI>British</HI> Court so easie,
or so at a loss, to take their own Measures, Her
Majesty having soon resolved not to leave Her Ambas∣sadors
and Servants there to be thus treated, ordered
the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> to come away, and has, by o∣ther
Hands, given the States Occasion to know how
She has Reason to resent this Treatment.</P>
<P>And yet what is it this Resentment amounts to?
Hitherto it amounts to little more than Negatives,
<HI>viz.</HI> No to gratifie the De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igns of those who would
either prorract the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declaredly, by refusing
the most Just Conditions of Peace, or Artificially, by
pushing Her Majesty upon prosecuting the War even
before it had been tried whether the Enemy would
yield to Honourable Terms, or no;” to let them
see therefore that Her Majesty is not to be used as
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
She has been any longer, and that whatever they
think fit to do in the Affair, Her Majesty ought not
to be obliged to take Her Measures <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, more
especially when it is so evident that those Measures
are so directly contrary to the true <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esign of the
War, and the General Good of <HI>Europe;</HI> for these
Reasons Her Majesty has thought fit to forbid Her
General joining in carrying on an Offensive War; at
the same Time letting the Allies know, that Her
Majesty having Reason to think Herself ill used in
the Affair of the Treaty, and that all Parties did not
come thither equally disposed to bring the said Trea∣ty
to the Happy desired Conclusion of an Honoura∣ble
Peace, that therefore Her Majesty finds Herself
obliged to take Care of the Safety and Peace of Her
own Dominions, and of the Happiness and Interest
of Her own Subjects, already sufficiently exhausted
by the length of the War, as well as by the unequal
Share of the Burthen which they have hitherto borne,
and which has very unjustly been put upon the Al∣lies,
and unwarily submitted to by those whom
Her Majesty has formerly entrusted with the Di∣rection
of those Affairs.</P>
<P>And let any Impartial Considering Man tell us
what could Her Majesty do less, in common Justice
to Her Faithful Subjects, whose Presures have been
so great, and who have so chearfully▪ so long, and
so patiently, borne the Burden of this war? Had Her
Majesty found Her Allies sincerely disposed to a
Treaty, and to enter into the particular Demands
for nogotiating a Public and General Peace, it is
certain that the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was heartily
and entirely bent to have procured a general Satis∣faction
to all the Allies, and was disposed to have
concerned Herself in their Safety and Interest equally
with Her own; but finding Herself treated as a∣bove,
She is justified before God and Man in taking
Care of the Interests of Her own People, leaving
those who Delight in War to carry it on by them∣selves,
till Time, and their own Experience, shall
open their Eyes.</P>
