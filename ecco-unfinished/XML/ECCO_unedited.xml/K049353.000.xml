<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHatever Reluctance I have to trouble the
Publick, with a Detail of the Mortifications
I have suffered, in my Attempts to bring the en∣suing
Performance on the Stage; I think it a Duty
incumbent upon me, to declare my Reasons for
presenting it in this extraordinary Manner; and
if the Explanation shall be found either tedious or
trifling, I hope the candid Reader will charge my
Impertinence upon those who drove me to the Ne∣cessity
of making such an ineffectual Appeal.</P>
<P>Besides, I flatter myself, that a fair Representa∣tion
of the Usage I have met with, will be as a
Beacon, to caution other inexperienced Authors
against the Insincerity of Managers, to which they
might otherwise become egregious Dupes; and,
after a cajoling Dream of good Fortune, wake in
all the Aggravation of Disappointment.</P>
<P>Although I claim no Merit from having finished
a Tragedy at the Age of Eighteen; I cannot help
thinking myself intitled to some share of Indul∣gence,
for the Humility, Industry and Patience,
I have exerted during a Period of ten Years, in
which this unfortunate Production hath been expo∣sed
to the Censure of Criticks of all Degrees; and
in Consequence of their several Opinions, altered,
and (I hope) amended Times without Number.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Had some of those who were pleased to call
themselves my Friends, been at any Pains to deserve
the Character, and told me ingenuously what I had
to expect in the Capacity of an Author, when I
first professed myself of that venerable Fraternity,
I should in all Probability, have spared myself the
incredible Labour and Chagrin I have since under∣gone:
But as early as the Year 1739, my Play
was taken into the Protection of one of those little
Fellows who are sometimes called great Men; and
like other Orphans, neglected accordingly.</P>
<P>Stung with Resentment, which I mistook for
Contempt, I resolved to punish this barbarous In∣difference,
and actually discarded my Patron; con∣soling
myself with the barren Praise of a few As∣sociates,
who, in the most indefatigable Manner,
employed their Time and Influence, in collecting
from all Quarters Observations on my Piece, which,
in consequence of those Suggestions, put on a new
Appearance almost every Day, until my Occasions
called me out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>—Soon after my Return, I and my Production
were introduced to a late Patentee, of courteous
Memory, who (rest his Soul!) found Means to
amuse me a whole Season, and then declared it
impracticable to bring it on till next Year; ad∣vising
me to make my Application more early in
the Winter, that we might have Time to concert
such Alterations, as should be thought necessary
for its successful Appearance on the Stage.—But
I did not find my Account in following this whole∣some
Advice; for, to me, he was always less and
less at Leisure. In short after sundry Promises,
and numberless Evasions, in the Course of which,
he practised upon me the whole Art of Procras∣tination,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
I demanded his final Answer, with such
Obstinacy and Warmth, that he could no longer
resist my Importunity, and refused my Tragedy
in plain Terms.—Not that he mentioned any ma∣terial
Objections to the Piece itself; but seemed
to fear my Interest was not sufficient to support it
in the Representation; affirming, that no drama∣tic
Composition, however perfect, could succeed
with an <HI>English</HI> Audience by its own Merit only;
but must entirely depend upon a Faction raised
in its Behalf.—Incensed at this unexpected Declara∣tion,
I reproached him bitterly, for having trifled
with me so long; and, like my Brother <HI>Bayes,</HI>
threaten'd to carry my Performance to the other
House.</P>
<P>This was actually my Intention, when I was
given to understand by a Friend, that an Noble∣man
of great Weight, had expressed an Inclina∣tion
to peruse it; and that, as Interest was requi∣site,
I could not do better than gratify his Desire
with all Expedition. I committed it accordingly
to the Care of my Counsellor, who undertook to
give me a good Account of it in less than a
Fortnight: But four Months elapsed before I heard
any Tidings of my Play; and then it was retrieved
by pure Accident (I believe) from the most disho∣nourable
Apartment of his Lordship's House.</P>
<P>Enraged at the Behaviour of this supercilious Peer,
and exceedingly mortified at the Miscarriage of all
my Efforts, I wreaked my Resentment upon the
innocent Cause of my Disgraces, and forthwith
condemned it to Oblivion, where in all Probability,
it would have for ever slept, like a miserable Abor∣tion;
had not a young Gentleman of Learning
and Taste waked my paternal Sense, and per∣swaded
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
me not only to rescue it from the Tomb,
where it had lain two whole Years; but also to
new model the Plan, which was imperfect and un∣digested
before, and mould it into a regular Trage∣dy,
confined within the Unites of the Drama.</P>
<P>Thus improved, it fell into the Hands of a Gen∣tleman
who had wrote for the Stage, and happened
to please him so much, that he spoke of it very
cordially to a young Nobleman, since deceased, who
in the most generous Manner, charged himself
with the Care of introducing it to the Pub∣lick;
and, in the mean time, honour'd me with
his own Remarks, in Conformity to which, it was
immediately altered, and offered by his Lordship to
the new Manager of <HI>Drury-lane</HI> Theatre. It was
about the latter End of the Season, when this can∣did
Personage, to whom I owe many Obligations
for the Exercises of Patience he has set me, received
the Performance, which, some Weeks after, he
returned, assuring my Friend, that he was pre-in∣gaged
to another Author, but if I could be pre∣vailed
upon to reserve it 'till the ensuing Winter,
he would bring it on.—In the Interim, my noble
Patron left <HI>London,</HI> whither he was doomed never
to return; and the conscientious Manager next
Season, instead of fulfilling his own Promise and
my Expectation, gratified the Town with the Pro∣duction
of a Player, the Fate of which every Body
knows.</P>
<P>I shall leave the Reader to make his Reflections
on this Event, and proceed to relate the other Par∣ticulars
of Fortune, that attended my unhappy
Issue, which in the succeeding Spring, had the good
Luck to acquire the Approbation of an eminent
Wit, who proposed a few Amendments, and re∣commended
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
it to a Person, by whose Influence, I
laid my Account with seeing it appear at last, with
such Advantage as should make ample Amends
for all my Disappointments.</P>
<P>But here too, I reckoned without my Host. The
Master of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre, bluntly reject∣ed
it, as a Piece altogether unfit for the Stage; even
after he had told me, in Presence of another Gentle∣man,
that he believed he should not venture to find
Fault with any Performance which had gained the
good Opinion of the honourable Person who ap∣proved
and recommended my Play.</P>
<P>Baffled in every Attempt, I renounced all Hopes
of its seeing the Light, when a humane Lady of
Quality, interposed so urgently in its Behalf, with
my worthy Friend the other Manager, that he very
complaisantly received it again, and had Recourse
to the old Mystery of Protraction, which he exer∣cised
with such Success, that the Season was almost
consumed, before he could afford it a Reading.—
My Patience being by this Time quite exhausted,
I desired a Gentleman, who interested himself in
my Concerns, to go and expostulate with the Va∣ticide:
And indeed, this piece of Friendship he per∣formed
with so much Zeal, upbraiding him with
his evasive and presumptuous Behaviour, that the
sage Politician was enraged at his Reprimand; and
in the Mettle of his Wrath, pronounced my Play a
wretched Piece, deficient in Language, Sentiment,
Character and Plan. My Friend, who was surpri∣sed
at the Hardness and Severity of this Sentence,
asking how he came to change his Opinion, which
had been more favourable when the Tragedy was
first put into his Hands; he answered, that his Opi∣nion
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
was not altered, neither had he ever uttered
an Expression in its Favour.</P>
<P>This was an unlucky Assertion—For, the other
immediately produced a Letter which I had receiv∣ed
from the young Nobleman two years before, be∣ginning
with these Words—</P>
<P>“Sir, I have received Mr. <HI>L</HI>—'s Answer; who
says, he thinks your Play has indubitable Merit,
but has prior Promises to Mr. <HI>T—n,</HI> as an honest
Man, cannot be evaded.”—And concluding thus;
“As the Manager has promised me the Choice of
the Season next Year, if you'll be advised by me,
rest it with me.”</P>
<P>After having made some Remarks suitable to the
Occasion, my Friend left him to chew the Cud of
Reflection, the Result of which was, a Message to
my Patroness, importing, (with many Expressions
of Duty) that neither the Circumstances of his
Company, nor the advanced Season of the Year,
would permit him to obey her Command, but if I
would wait till next Winter, and during the Sum∣mer,
make such Alterations as I had agreed to, at
a Conference with some of his principal Performers,
he would assuredly put my Play in Rehearsal, and
in the mean time give me an Obligation in Writ∣ing,
for my further Satisfaction.—I would have
taken him at his Word, without Hesitation, but
was persuaded to dispense with the proffered Secu∣rity,
that I might not seem to doubt the Influence
or Authority of her Ladyship.—The Play (how∣ever)
was altered and presented to this upright Di∣rector,
who renounced his Engagement, without
the least Scruple, Apology or Reason assigned.—</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
Thus have I in the most impartial Manner, (per∣haps
too circumstantially) displayed the Conduct of
those Play-house Managers with whom I have had
any Concern, relating to my Tragedy: And what∣ever
Disputes have happened between the Actors
and me, are suppressed as frivolous Animosities un∣worthy
of the Reader's Attention.</P>
<P>Had I suffered a Repulse when I first presented
my Performance, I should have had Cause to com∣plain
of my being excluded from that Avenue to the
public Favour, which ought to lie open to all Men
of Genius; and how far I deserve that Distinction,
I now leave the World to decide; after I have in
Justice to myself, declared that my Hopes of Suc∣cess
were not derived from the partial Applause, of
my own Friends only, but inspired (as some of my
greatest Enemies know) by the Approbation of
Persons of the first Note in the Republic of Taste;
whose Countenance, I vainly imagined, would have
been an effectual Introduction to the Stage.</P>
<P>Be that as it will; I hope the unprejudiced Ob∣server
will own, with Indignation and Disdain, that
every Disappointment I have endured, was an ac∣cumulated
Injury; and the whole of my Adversa∣ry's
Conduct, a Series of the most unjustifiable E∣quivocation
and insolent Absurdity: For, though
he may be excusable in refusing a Work of this
kind, either on Account of his Ignorance or Dis∣cernment;
surely, neither the one nor the other
can vindicate his Dissimulation and Breach of Pro∣mise
to the Author.</P>
<P>Abuse of Prerogative, in Matters of greater Im∣portance,
prevails so much at present, and is so ge∣nerally
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
overlooked, that it is almost ridiculous to
lament the Situation of Authors, who must either,
at once, forego all Opportunities of acquiring Re∣putation
in Dramatic Poetry; or humble them∣selves
so, as to sooth the Pride, and Humour the
Petulance of a meer <HI>Goth,</HI> who by the most pre∣posterous
Delegation of Power, may become sole
Arbiter of this kind of Writing.</P>
<P>Nay granting that a Bard is willing to prostitute
his Talents so shamefully, perhaps he may never
find an Occasion to practice this vile Condescension
to Advantage: For, after he has gained Admission
to a Patentee, who is often more difficult of Access
than a Sovereign Prince, and even made Shift to
remove all other Objections; an insurmountable
Obstacle may be raised by the Manager's Avarice,
which will dissuade him from hazarding a certain
Expence on an uncertain Issue, when he can fill
his Theatre without running any Risk, or disoblig∣ing
his principal Actors, by putting them to the
trouble of studying new Parts.—</P>
<P>Besides, he will be apt to say within himself,
“If I must entertain the Town with Variety, it
is but natural that I should prefer the Produc∣tions
of my Friends, or of those who have any
Friends worth obliging, to the Works of ob∣scure
Strangers, who have nothing to recom∣mend
them but a doubtful Superiority of Merit,
which in all likelihood, will never rise in Judg∣ment
against me.”</P>
<P>That such have been the Reflections of Paten∣tees,
I believe no Man of Intelligence and Veraci∣ty
will deny; and I will venture to affirm, that on
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
the Strength of Interest or Connection with the
Stage, some People have commenced Dramatic
Authors, who otherwise, would have employed
their Faculties in Exercises better adapted to their
Capacity.</P>
<P>—After what has been said, any thing by way
of Application would be an Insult on the Under∣standing
of the Public, to which I owe and ac∣knowledge
the most indelible Obligation, for
former Favours as well as for the uncommon En∣couragement
I have received in the Publication
of the following Play.</P>
