<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a custom with the Grecian Fishermen of old, when they had escaped an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> danger at sea, to dedi∣cate their little skiffs to whatever Tutelary Being they attributed its preservation; there is nothing more cer∣tain, than that the ABSENT MAN is chiefly, was I not the Author myself, perhaps, I might say wholly, indebted for its success, to your excellent performance; it is therefore, with great pleasure I take this method of expressing my obligations to you.</P>
<P>Indeed, when I consider your punctuality in attending the Rehearsals of this little Piece, though out of the common business of the Theatre; and the care you took, not only to be perfect yourself, but that it should be, in every respect, produced as complete as possible; I can∣not help congratulating all our present Writers for the Stage, on the acquisition of a performer of such uncom∣mon merit; and so great a favourite with the Public; who, they may be assured, will consider their advantage and reputation, as well as his own; and do their pieces, at least, all the justice they are capable of receiving.</P>
<P>Had I an inclination to indulge myself in the Dedica∣tory Stile. I might now tell you, with truth, that few men have filled so many Characters with the same pro∣priety that you have; but I leave this to some News∣paper Essayist, who may be fond of playing upon mean∣ings and wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; and vary your appearance upon the Theatre how you please, I will venture to say, your acquaintance in private life, will always find you an honest and sensible, and a gentleman like man.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, Sir, with great esteem, your obliged, humble servant.</SALUTE></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS farce was written some years ago, since which time it has lain by the Author, without being offered to the stage; nor should he have ventured it there at all, but to serve Mr. Holland, at his benefit; upon which occasion, he thought the Publick, through favour to so deserving a performer, would be willing to be pleased with any thing.</P>
<P>The event has greatly exceeded his hopes; the farce was not only received with general approbation the first night, but that sort of approbation which a writer may depend upon with greatest safety.</P>
<Q><L>"For smiles are honest when the hands are not;"</L></Q>
<P>And on the second night, it met with marks of fa∣vour still more manifest; this engaged the author to look over it with greater care than he had before done, and having heightened some places where he thought it most deficient, he now submits it to the public, in a form, in which, he hopes it will not utterly displease, though it is needless to say that things of this kind have their principal merit in representation.</P>
<P>Regnard one of the most famous French comic poets, ranked by his countrymen next to Moliere, has written a play of five acts upon this subject, called, le DIS∣TRAIT; however, exclusive of their great disparity in merit; no two pieces can be less alike than that, and the ABSENT MAN; at least, where the materials have been drawn from the same source. The DISTRAIT of Regnard is exactly the Menalcas of La Bruyere's charac∣ters, a few things only left out, which, though possessed of a pleasant extravagance in recital▪ would be too absurd for actual representation; the hint of the ABSENT MAN, and no more, is taken from the same character of Menalcas, translated in one of the num∣bers of the Spectator; with the assistance of which, if the present writer has been able to produce a laughable farce, it is all he aimed at, and he pretends to no more praise than such a trifling composition may deserve.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>ERE the curtain draws up, list a little to me:</L>
<L>Are you all in a very good humour? Let's see;</L>
<L>Good humour you have, howe'er you come by it,</L>
<L>And I'm glad to my soul; for, by Jove we shall try it.</L>
<L>Our farce is so very a farce, I'm in doubt,</L>
<L>If the pit and the boxes; will suffer it out;</L>
<L>But when we're in danger of such a mishap,</L>
<L>My dear friends above, drown their hiss in a clap;</L>
<L>And if you are pleas'd with our farcical man,</L>
<L>In spite of their airs, laugh as loud as you can.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To give you a sketch, now, by way of portraying,</L>
<L>His character's this—pray observe what I'm saying;</L>
<L>An odd kind of whimsical blundering being,</L>
<L>Who has ears without hearing, and eyes without seeing;</L>
<L>Takes things by all handles, except by the right,</L>
<L>Ask a question in black, he answers in white.</L>
<L>Yes for no, no for yes; confuses, mistakes;</L>
<L>All he does so like dreaming▪ you'd scarce think he wakes.</L>
<L>Suppose to back-gammon my gentleman falls,</L>
<L>Box and dice in his hand▪ for some water he calls;</L>
<L>'Tis brought in a tumbler, when pop, in a trice,</L>
<L>He throws out the liquor, and swallows the dice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard set are poor bards for your pleasure to cater,</L>
<L>And thus one provides for you, from the Spectator;</L>
<L>From volume the first, page three hundred and nine,</L>
<L>Number seventy-seven he takes his design;</L>
<L>Let that be his sanction for what you behold▪</L>
<L>Can the figure be bad from so perfect a mold?</L>
<L>'Tis polish'd and varnish'd as well as he's able,</L>
<L>And he hopes you'll find something like conduct and fable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still this curst absence—in shortt here's the thing,</L>
<L>If the character hits, thence his actions all spring;</L>
<L>And nought will disgust you, and nought will alarm you,</L>
<L>You'll taste ev'ry blunder, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is follies will charm you;</L>
<L>But if—Gad we're all in a terrible fright,</L>
<L>So, begging for mercy, I wish you good night.</L>

<P>If I was not acquainted with my master now, I should naturally conclude that he had either hanged, or drown'd himself, in order to avoid being married.</P>

<P>Well, if ever I <STAGE>(Laughs again.)</STAGE> If ever I heard the like of this since I was born, I wish I may be mar∣ried to a woman of three-score, with the constitution of a girl of sixteen—Why it will be the general joke of the whole town—that a man, <STAGE>(Laughs again)</STAGE> that a man should be such a—but stay—I'll tell the story to myself, and try how it will sound—Doctor Gruel, a physician of noted worth and eminence, comes to a certain gentleman, Mr. Shatterbrain by name; and on account of an antient friendship subsisting between their families, and for some other reasons, which shall be nameless, offers him his only daughter for a wife—Mr. Shatterbrain accepts the propo∣sal, and, in short, the happy day arrives, in which he is to be put in possession of the amiable object; when, behold you, the Doctor coming to call on his de∣stined son-in-law, presto, pass and be gone, the bird is flown; my gentleman is not to be found—He took himself off the same morning about seven o'Clock—and nobody can tell what is become of him—it will never do—But, hark! the Doctor is marching up stairs—perhaps he may be able to give a physical reason for this.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>So young man, where's your master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>When will he come in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I can't tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he say nothing to you when he was going out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a syllable, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor to you, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor to me, Sir, as I'm a christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on us; I suppose you know what engagements he had upon his hands this evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sure, Sir, very well, and I thought he had known it himself; but it seems I was mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seriously, I am afraid some accident has happened to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I don't believe any accident has happened to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's your opinion then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I need not tell you, Sir, that my master is, one or other, the most absent man this day upon the face of the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I have often heard him remarked for it; nay, I have myself taken notice of several glaring instances of it in him; but, that is a failing he will soon get the better of when his thoughts are pro∣perly employed; and matrimony—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will in all likelihood perfectly cure him. 'Tis granted, Sir, matrimony is without doubt an excellent remedy, in such distempers; a kind of manna and cream of tartar; a mixture of sweet and sower; wonderfully adapted to purge the mind of it's gross humours, and reduce the understanding to a perfect regularity of constitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good comical fellow this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you cannot expect that the patient should recover, Sir, before you have administer'd the remedy you intend to prescribe for his disease: there∣fore, you must not be surprised if my master happens to labour under a very violent fit of his out of the way malady, at this present moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither more, nor less, than that he has forgot he was to be married to your daughter to night, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>As sure as can be he has Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, forgot—and given the reins to his wild imagination, suffer'd it to run away with him the Lord knows whither. Why, Sir, when he is in the forgetting mood, his memory is a perfect sieve—Any thing will fall thro' it—I have known him forget his own name before now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am unwilling to think my friend Shatter∣brain design'd to affront me—But if his memory was a sieve, to which you compare it, that only
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
yields a passage to minuter particle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, while the more gross remain behind—And an affair of con∣sequence, like—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir! I could tell you such stories of him, as would make you credit this with very little difficulty—for instance, the other day▪ he was sit∣ting in a coffee-house, when a fly which had buzz'd about him a good while, and he was watching an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣portunity to kill, unluckily settled upon the cheek of a person who stood near him—Ha! says he, I believe I have you now; and with that, Sir, he up with his hand, and hit the poor gentleman such a confounded slap, as made the room ring again; one started, the other stared; in short, swords were drawn, and the case would insallibly have been transferred to Hyde Park, had not the acquaintance on both sides interposed; so he begged pardon, confessed he did not know what he was doing; it ended in a hearty laugh, and the general astonishment of the whole company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a fortnight ago, Sir, he locked up a lady, and a gentleman, in his bed-chamber here, in the way of a joke only; was call'd down about some business; forgot it by the time he came to the foot of the stairs, went out with the key in his pocket, and it was six o'clock before we could set the pound∣ed couple at liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>His ideas are so confused, sometimes, Sir, that I have known him write a letter to one person, direct it to another, and send it to a third, who could not devise who it came from; because, he had forgot to put his name to the bottom on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>A beggar takes off his hat to him in the street, in hopes of receiving an alms; Mr. Shatter∣brain makes him a low bow, tells him, he's his most obedient humble servant, and walks on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the best thing I have heard of him a good while, was, what he did lately at a gentleman's house in the city; where taking his leave with an intention to go away, in one of his absent sits, he mounted up three pair of stairs into the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ret; the maids that by chance were ironing there▪ wonder'd what the plague kept such a stamping about the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
rooms, when one of them taking a candle to see what it was, found my poor master; who, in the utmost confusion, told her▪ he fancy'd he had made some mistake, and begg'd to know if that was not the way to the street door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I don't know; but, if his present behaviour proceeds from his forgetfulness, it is the most extraordinary instance of the kind that ever was heard of; and, how shall I proceed in this case; my daughter is at home ready dressed; the lawyer will be there presently with the writings; I have taken out a lience; appointed the clergyman to come and marry them; how shall I put it off after this, with∣out making us all ridiculous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, Sir, I am sure I have been at my wits end about it all day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose, Mr. Frank, you were to go and look for your master again; what if you gave a peep into the Bedford coffee-house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you think you will find him there.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can be no harm to try, Sir.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I with all my heart; for, on many accounts, I would not wish to have my daughter's marriage delay'd; her own indiscretion, Madam, has occasioned me to treat her with a severity of late, very irksome both to herself and me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a pity, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth and so it is: few fathers have taken greater care in the education of a child, nor has that care been wholly unprofitable; for I think I may say without vanity, that there is not a young woman in England, of her age and station, more compleatly ac∣complished than my Flavia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet she has no more pride, I warrant, than a boarding-school girl, in the first row of her samplar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's her fault, Madam—a proper pride is
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
woman's virtue—I should be sorry to see my daugh∣ter give herself airs, but at the same time I would have her know her proper value; I would not have her throw herself away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet had I not interposed my parental au∣thority, such was her purpose, Madam; if I may call it throwing herself away, to marry a young fel∣low not worth a groat.</P>

<P>For your daughter! Upon my word, and so I do—bless my soul, what was I thinking of. Did I say your mother? No, no; your daughter to be sure. How does Miss Gruel, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, at your service heartily—if you recollect we agreed to consummate our affairs this evening. Accordingly I have disposed every thing for that purpose; and having a patient to visit in your neighbourhood here, called in my return home to take you along with me—guess then how I was sur∣prised when the people told me you had gone out early, and nobody knew whither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shatter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, I am quite ashamed—but up∣on my word it went out of my head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so your servant said he was sure it had, and I am very well pleased to find he was not mistaken—for in truth I was apprehensive that it pro∣ceeded from a worse cause▪ and some ill accident de∣tain'd you—but where the duce have you been with your shoes and stockings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shatter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frank, what are you doing? my shoes and stockings, Sir? Why they are in a very beastly pickle, that's the truth on't—and now I look at them again, upon my soul I am amazed how I could contrive to make them so though the roads were confounded deep; and if they had been a fathom, it would have been just the same—for I never pick my steps, but wade through the middle of every thing—I had like to have been run over once or twice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you walked into the country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shatter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Sir, I had no thoughts of it when I left home—but I don't know how it was, the beauty of the weather had inticed me as far as Put∣ney, before I perceived that I was on t'other side the river; where meeting with a party of friends going to dine at Richmond, I made a fifth in their ve∣hicle—by the way I was obliged to get one of the ladies to pay my reckoning—for when I came to put my hand in my pocket—the duce a farthing had I about me.</P>

<P>Impossible!—If there be any such thing as faith or constancy in woman. But I'll know the truth of that presently—I'll go to her father's house; by some means or other get admittance; and, if I find her false—</P>
