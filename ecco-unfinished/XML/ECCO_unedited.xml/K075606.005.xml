<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE plan of this Collection having been alrea∣dy submitted to the reader, little remains but to apologize for delay, which, it is hoped, has pro∣duced improvement. The fifth and sixth volumes might have appeared in 1780; but it was thought more adviseable to wait till the work was entirely completed.</P>
<P>It cannot but be a pleasing satisfaction to the Editor to find that what he has laid before the publick has attracted the notice of many gentlemen, whose praise is real fame, and who have shewn their approbation by communications which in no small degree adorn the present volumes.</P>
<P>That the biographical notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The extract in the former Advertisement, from a Dia∣logue of PRIOR, will be illustrated by the following quo∣tation from a Writer as amiable as he is learned, and by whose kind hints the present Collection has been considera∣bly benefited: "I have lately been permitted to read a cu∣rious manuscript, now in the hands of her Grace the Duchess Dowager of Portland, containing Essays and Dialogues of the Dead, on the following subjects, by Prior. 1. Heads for a Treatise on Learning. 2. Essay on Opinion. 3. A Dialogue betwixt Charles the Fifth and Clenard the Grammarian. 4. Betwixt Locke and Montague. 5. The Vicar of Bray and Sir Thomas More. 6. Oliver Cromwell and his Porter. If these pieces were published, Prior would appear to be as good a prose writer as poet.—Some valuable memoirs of his life, written by the Hon. Mr. Montagu, his friend, are also in p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssession of the Duchess Dowager of Portland."</P>
<BIBL>Dr. WARTON, <HI>Essay on Pope</HI>, vol. II. p. 482.</BIBL>
<P>The anonymous Imitation of Anacreon, which is printed in p. 155. of this volume, I since perceive, is attributed to Prior, in the late Collection of the English Poets, vol. XXXI. p. 250.</P></NOTE> have been acceptable, is evident from their having occasioned a new edition of Mr. DODSLEY's Poems on a similar plan.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>Among the poems now exhibited are some valuable originals, and a number of academical verses by some of the most distinguished scholars of this kingdom.— If to these the Editor has added a few of his own ju∣venile attempts at versification, he hopes to stand ex∣cused for the presumption. They are not numerous, and will at least serve as a foil to the beauties with which they are surrounded.</P>
<P>A variety of avocations having prevented the Editor from attending to the Index, that laborious office has been kindly undertaken by Mr. MACBEAN, whose abilities in that line had been before exerted in Dr. JOHNSON's edition of the English Poets.</P>
<P>A short Index to the Notes preceded the former publication; another is here annexed.</P>

<HEAD>A SELECT COLLECTION OF POEMS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>EPIGRAM, BY BP. ATTERBURY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Francis Atterbury, born March 6, 1662, was educated at Westminster; and in 1680 was elected a student of Christ-Church. In 1693 he applied to the earl of Nottingham, to suc∣ceed to his father's rectory of Milton in Bucks; but, being unsuc∣cessful, came to London: where he was soon distinguished, appointed chaplain to king William, and elected preacher at Bridewell, and lecturer of St. Bride's; which last office he resigned in December 1698. In 1700 he was made arch∣deacon of Totness, by Sir Jonathan Trelawney bishop of Exeter; and, entering deeply into the famous controversy concerning the convocation against Dr. Wake dean of Exeter, was created doctor in divinity in a manner which did him sin∣gular honour. On the accession of queen Anne, he was made one of her chaplains; and in October 1704, dean of Carlisle; in 1707, canon residentiary of Exeter; in 1700, preacher at The Rolls. In 1710 he was unanimously chosen prolocutor of the lower house of convocation; in 1711 made dean of Christ-Church, Oxford; in the beginning of June 1713, advanced to the bishoprick of Rochester and deanry of Westminster. He officiated, as dean, at the coronation of king George the First; when he received from his maiesty some marks of per∣sonal dislike, owing probably to his having warmly espoused the cause of Sacheverell, whose defence he penned (in con∣cert with Dr. Smalridge), and from whom he afterwards re∣ceived a legacy of five hundred pounds. In 1715 he refused to sign the declaration published by the Bishops against the rebellion, and was ever afterward in opposition to the court. He was apprehended on suspicion of treason, and committed to The Tower, August 22, 1722; but was never brought to trial, which he repeatedly desired. At length a bill was brought into parliament, and passed, by which he was sentenced to deprivation and banishment, and which received the royal assent May 27, 1723. It is said the king gave his assent to the bill with regret. None of his relations, not even his own children, were permitted to visit him in his banish¦ment, without first obtaining leave under the king's sign manual. On the 18th of June he left this kingdom; and died at Paris, Feb. 17, 1731-2. His body was brought to England, and interred on the 12th of May following in Westminster Abbey. His bowels were in an urn, thus in∣scribed,
<Q><L>"In hâc urnâ depositi sunt cineres</L>
<L>Francisci Atterbury, Episcopi Roffenfis."</L></Q>
Mr. Pope's very beautiful epitaph on him is printed in the English Poets, vol. XXXIII. p. 364. and the following inedited inscription has lately been communicated to me:

Dr. Atterbury and Dr. Smalridge married two sisters, the daughters of the Rev. Mr. Osborne, a relation to the duke of Leeds, who had a benefice in the neighbour∣hood of Oxford, and taught the French language to the young gentlemen at the university. By his lady Dr. At∣terbury had issue one son, Osborne Atterbury, and two daughters. The son, who was educated at Christ Church in Oxford, went to The East Indies, whence he returned in 1732, and succeeded to the estate of his uncle, Dr. Lewis Atterbury, at Great Houghton in Northamptonshire, then worth about 400l. a year. After some time, he was ordained by his father's great rival, Bishop Hoadly; and obtained the living of O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hill in Warwickshire, in June 1746. A letter from the Bishop to this son will appear in his Epistolary Correspondence. One of the Bishop's daugh∣ters died single; the other, his favourite, was married to William Morice, Esq. the high-bailiff of Westminster. I hope speedily to lay before the publick some farther particulars of this truly elegant Writer, with two volumes of his Epis∣tolary Correspondence.</NOTE>; WRITTEN ON A WHITE FAN BORROWED FROM MISS OSBORNE, AFTERWARDS HIS WIFE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>SONG, TAKEN FROM BP. ATTERBURY'S OWN HAND-WRITING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the same authority I ascribe the elegant little song in vol. III. p. 191. to this accomplished Prelate; and also the Imitation of Theocritus, which is printed anonymously vol. I. p. 99. under the title of "The Honey Stealer." In the Bishop's copy it is called "The Bee;" and the four first lines are here copied, as containing some slight variations:

<BYLINE>TRANSLATED BY BP.

This we have often been surprized at, as certainly there is nothing ex∣traordinary in the Ode itself. The chief thing that recom∣mends it, is the easy elegance and gracefulness of its expres∣sion, which is probably the reason why it hath been so popu∣lar, and hath produced such a number of imitators; of whom, however, few have succeeded. Of all the versions of it that we recollect at present, Atterbury's is by far the best. Were we not afraid of offending our classical readers, we should almost be tempted to say, that it is equal to the original; a thing which can scarcely ever be said of the translations of Horace."

<HEAD>HORACE, BOOK IV. ODE III.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>IMITATED BY DR. ATTERBURY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Any one who hath a genius for poetry, says a learned correspondent, will agree with me in wishing that Atterbury had never had any other occupation but poetry. His same as a politician or a divine is not equal to what he deserves for this translation, which is, without exception, the best in any lan∣guage that I have met with." This, undoubtedly, is carrying the encomium on Dr. Atterbury's poetical talent very far; and yet we can scarcely venture to say that it is carried too far. There is something so exceedingly beautiful in the specimens which are given of his early turn for poetry, that it is greatly to be regretted that he did not more direct his thoughts that way. The translation of this Ode is in the highest degree beautiful. The Ode itself, in the original, is peculiarly ex∣cellent and delightful; and Dr. Atterbury hath most happily succeeded in clothing it in an English dress. It was judicious in Dr. Francis not to attempt a new version of this Ode, after so admirable a one was furnished to his hands. And he justly observes, that by Bishop Atterbury's success we may be con∣vinced that it is not impossible to render Horace into English without any great loss of his original beauties."

<HEAD>SOLILOQUY OF CATO <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foreign nations have done this tragedy as much honour as our own; and indeed it is one of those few performances which cannot receive more honour than it deserves. It was translated more than once into French, obtained two Italian versions, and has been either translated or imitated in the German language. But the greatest honour that was ever done to it, was the putting the Soliloquy of Cato, which is perhaps the noblest thing in our language, into a Latin dress, which might have been read with admiration, even by the criticks in the court of Augustus. Fame has attributed this to Bishop Atterbury; and, as it was superlatively fine, tho world thought Fame in the right, and so it proved. Biog. Brit. 1778, vol. I. p. 30.</NOTE>. ACT. V. SCEN.

In "The General Dictionary" it is supposed that he translated Virgil's Georgicks into English. If such a work exists, there is not a man of taste but would wish to see it. How closely the Bishop had studied Virgil, is ap∣parent from the elegant dissertation on the Japyx of that divine poet; in which he endeavours to prove, that under the character of Japyx, Antonius Musa, an eminent physician and a polite scholar at Rome in the reign of Augustus, was intended to be described.

<HEAD>MENALCAS AND ENOSIA, A PASTORAL DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE DUKE OF WHARTON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This unprincipled and unthinking genius, only son of the marquis of Wharton by Lucy his second lady, was born in December 1698, and educated under the immediate inspection of his father, who anxiously endeavoured to qua∣lify him for the high station his birth gave him reason to expect. The first source of his unhappiness was a precipitate marriage with the daughter of major general Holmes, an amiable lady, but so infinitely his inferior in rank and fortune that their union hastened the marquis's death, which hap∣pened April 12, 1715, when the young lord had little more than entered into his 17th year. Early in 1716 he indulged his desire of travelling, and visited several courts of Germany, particularly that of Hanover. When at Lyons, he presented a very fine horse to the chevalier de St. George, who in∣vited him to Avignon, and flattered him with the visionary title of Duke of Northumberland. Continuing there but one day, he made a visit at St. Germains to the dowager of king James the Second. A friend expostulating with him on this conduct, he answered, "that he had pawned his principles to Gordon, the Pretender's banker, for a considerable sum; and till he could repay him, he must be a Jacobite; but when that was done, he would again return to the Whigs." He came back to England in December 1716; and soon set out for Ireland, where, on account of his extraordinary qualities, he was admitted, though under age, to take his seat in the house of peers; where, having distinguished himself as a violent partizan for the ministry, he was taken notice of by king George I. who created him a duke, Jan. 20, 1717. When he came of age, he was introduced into the house of lords in England with the greatest blaze of reputation; but soon changed sides again, and heartily opposed the court. His speech against the ministry, Feb. 4, 1720-21, had a fatal effect; earl Stanhope answering it with so much warmth that he burst a blood-vessel and died. He was one of the most forward in defence of Bp. Atterbury in 1723; and professedly commenced author, by publishing his thoughts twice a week in a paper called "The True Briton." His boundless profusion had in the mean time so incumbered his estate that he resolved to go abroad in order to clear it. He visited Vienna and Madrid; and, after shewing by his con∣duct at both these courts his dislike to the illustrious family on the British throne, entered openly into the service of the Pretender. Whilst thus employed abroad, his dutchess, who had been neglected by him, died in England, April 14, 1726, without issue; and he soon after married Madam Oberne, one of the maids of honour to the queen of Spain. After this marriage, he passed some time at Rome, under the title of Duke of Northumberland, and accepted a blue rib∣band from the Pretender, whose confidence he enjoyed as long as his natural volubility would permit. To prevent his falling into actual disgrace, he quitted Rome, and offered himself to the King of Spain as a volunteer at the siege of Gibraltar. His services were accepted: but he soon grew weary, and wished to return again to the court of the Cheva∣lier; who found means to dissuade him from this intention. He took up his residence at Rouen in May, 1728; about which time a bill of indictment was preferred against him in England for high treason. The Chevalier supplied him with 2000l. for his support; which was soon very profusely squan∣dered away. After this period he removed to Orleans, to Nantz, and to Bilboa. In the beginning of 1731, the Duke declined so fast, being in his quarters at Lerida, that he had not the use of his limbs so as to move without assistance. He received some benefit from mineral waters; but relapsed in May at Terragona, and fell into one of the fainting fits to which he had been for some time subject, at a small village, and was utterly destitute of the necessaries of life, till some chari∣table fathers of a Bernardine convent offered him the assistance their house afforded. The duke accepted the proposal; was removed to their convent; and under their hospitable roof, after languishing a week, died without one friend or acquain∣tance to close his eyes. He was buried in the same manner in which the fathers inter those of their own fraternity. His character, which was admirably drawn by Mr. Pope, in one of his Moral Essays (Epistle I. ver. 180.) is thus elegantly enlarged on by an ingenious writer who had every opportunity of being well-informed:
<Q>“Like Buck∣ingham and Rochester he comforted all the grave and dull by throwing away the brightest profusion of parts on witty fooleries, debaucheries, and scrapes, which may mix graces with a great character, but never can compose one. If Julius Caesar had only <HI>rioted</HI> with Catiline, he had never been Emperor of the World. Indeed the Duke of Wharton was not made for conquest: he was not equally formed for a Roundhouse and Pharsalia. In one of his ballads he has bantered his own want of heroism; it was in a song he made on being seized by the guard in St. James's Park, for singing the Jacobite air, <HI>The King shall have [enjoy] his own again</HI>,
<Q><L>"The Duke he drew out half his sword,</L>
<L>—The Guard drew out the rest.</L></Q>
His levities, wit, and want of principles, his eloquence, and adventures, are too well known to be recapitulated. With attachment to no party, though with talents to govern any party, this lively man changed the free air of Westminster for the gloom of the Escurial, the prospect of King George's Garter for the Pretender's; and, with indifference to all religion, the frolic Lord, who had writ the ballad on the Archbishop of Canterbury, died in the hand of a Ca∣puchin. It is difficult to give an account of the works of so mercurial a man, whose library was a tavern, and women of pleasure his Muses.

II. p. 130.—My intention was to have printed all the duke of Wharton's poe∣tical productions in this volume; but having been informed, whilst this sheet was actually in the press, that a complete collection of them was preparing by an ingenious gentleman who has been long collecting materials expressly for that purpose, I readily relinquish my first design; and submit two only of this nobleman's poems to the publick, as a spe∣cimen of his uncommon talents.

<HEAD>THE SALISBURY BALLAD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Poem was given me in MS. by my worthy friend Anthony Henley, es{que} who used to call it his favourite, for the humour and simplicity of it, and its delicate ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llery on the Dutch commentators.

D. 1083. to Richard Poor, the seventh, 1217. This "Whereupon" therefore is as much as to say, After 134 years suffering the affronts of the gar∣rison, their patience was worn out; flesh and blood could endure no longer; but Bishop Poor being a stout man went to the King.</NOTE> Bishop Poor went to the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">King Henry III.</NOTE> King,</L>

Others more acutely, think this might be Pope Joan; but this ingenious solution is against chronology, for Pope Joan (if ever there was such a one) was in the year 853, 374 years before Bishop Poor. The best reason, in my opi∣nion, is taken out of the context, the last verse of this Stanza, "Where every thing is to be sold:" Rome is a Whore, because it does kindnesses for money only, not for love; which is the very definition of a Whore.</NOTE> Whore, replied Bishop Poor,</L>

<L>A Dreadful plague from angry Juno came,</L>
<L>To scourge the land that bore her rival's name;</L>
<L>Before her fatal anger was reveal'd,</L>
<L>And teeming malice lay as yet conceal'd,</L>
<L>All remedies we try, all medicines use,</L>
<L>Which Nature could supply, or Art produce;</L>
<L>Th' unconquer'd foe derides the vain design,</L>
<L>And Art and Nature foil'd declare the cause divine.</L>
<L>At first we only felt th' oppressive weight</L>
<L>Of gloomy clouds, then teeming with our fate,</L>
<L>And labouring to discharge unactive heat:</L>
<L>But, ere four moons alternate changes knew,</L>
<L>With deadly blasts the fatal South-wind blew,</L>
<L>Infected all the air, and poison'd as it flew.</L>
<L>Our fountains too a dire infection yield,</L>
<L>For crowds of vipers creep along the field,</L>
<L>And, with polluted gore and baneful steams,</L>
<L>Taint all the lakes, and venom all the streams.</L>
<L>The young disease with milder force began,</L>
<L>And rag'd on birds and beasts, excusing man.</L>
<L><PB REF="86"/>The labouring oxen fall before the plow,</L>
<L>Th' unhappy plow-men st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, and wonder how;</L>
<L>The tabid sheep, with sickly bleatings pines;</L>
<L>Its wool decreasing, as its stren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h declines:</L>
<L>The warlike steed, by inward foes compell'd,</L>
<L>Neglects his honours, and deserts the field,</L>
<L>Unnerv'd and languid seeks a base retreat,</L>
<L>And at the manger groans, but wish'd a nobler fate:</L>
<L>The stags forget their speed, the boars their rage,</L>
<L>Nor can the bears the stronger herds engage:</L>
<L>A general faintness does invade them all,</L>
<L>And in the woods and fields promiscuously they fall.</L>
<L>The air receives the stench, and (strange to say)</L>
<L>The ravenous birds and beasts avoid the prey:</L>
<L>Th' offensive bodies rot upon the ground,</L>
<L>And spread the dire contagion all around.</L>
<L>But now the plague, grown to a larger size,</L>
<L>Riots on man, and scorns a meaner prize.</L>
<L>Intestine heats begin the civil war.</L>
<L>And flushings first the latent flame declare,</L>
<L>And breath inspir'd, which seem'd like fiery air.</L>
<L>Their black dry tongues are swell'd, and scarce can move,</L>
<L>And short thick sighs from panting lungs are drove;</L>
<L>They gape for air, with flattering hopes t' abate</L>
<L>Their raging flames, but that augments their heat;</L>
<L>No bed, no covering can the wretches bear,</L>
<L>But on the ground, expos'd to open air,</L>
<L>They lie, and hope to find a pleasing coolness there.</L>
<L>The suffering earth, with that oppression curst,</L>
<L>Returns the heat which they imparted first.</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="87"/>In vain physicians would bestow their aid,</L>
<L>Vain all their art, and useless all their trade;</L>
<L>And they, ev'n they, who fleeting life recall,</L>
<L>Feel the same powers, and undistinguish'd fall.</L>
<L>If any proves so daring to attend</L>
<L>His sick companion, or his darling friend,</L>
<L>Th' officious wretch sucks-in contagious breath,</L>
<L>And with his friend doth sympathize in death.</L>
<L>And now the care and hopes of life are past,</L>
<L>They please their fancies, and indulge their taste;</L>
<L>At brooks and streams, regardless of their shame,</L>
<L>Each sex, promiscuous, strives to quench their flame;</L>
<L>Nor do they strive in vain to quench it there,</L>
<L>For thirst and life at once extinguish'd are.</L>
<L>Thus in the brooks the dying bodies sink,</L>
<L>But heedless still the rash survivors drink.</L>
<L>So much uneasy down the wretches hate,</L>
<L>They fly their beds to struggle with their fate;</L>
<L>But if decaying strength forbids to rise,</L>
<L>The victim crawls and rolls, till on the ground he lies.</L>
<L>Each shuns his bed, as each would shun his tomb;</L>
<L>And thinks th' infection only lodg'd at home.</L>
<L>Here one, with fainting steps, does slowly creep</L>
<L>O'er heaps of dead, and strait augments a heap;</L>
<L>Another, while his strength and tongue prevail'd,</L>
<L>Bewails his friend, and falls himself bewail'd:</L>
<L>This with imploring looks surveys the skies,</L>
<L>The last dear office of his closing eyes;</L>
<L>But finds the Heavens implacable, and dies.</L>
<L>What now, ah! what employ'd my troubled mind?</L>
<L>But only hopes my subject<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sate to find.</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="88"/>What place soe'er my weeping eyes survey,</L>
<L>There in lamented heaps the vulgar lay;</L>
<L>As acorns scatter when the winds prevail,</L>

<L>You see that dome which rears its front so high,</L>
<L>'Tis sacred to the Monarch of the Sky;</L>
<L>How many there, with unregarded tears,</L>
<L>And fruitless vows, sent up successless prayers!</L>
<L>There fathers for expiring sons implor'd,</L>
<L>And there the wife bewail'd her gasping Lord;</L>
<L>With pious offerings they 'd appease the skies,</L>
<L>But they, ere yet th' atoning vapours rise,</L>
<L>Before the altars fall, themselves a sacrifice:</L>
<L>They fall, while yet their hands the gums contain,</L>
<L>The gums surviving, but their offerers slain.</L>
<L>The destin'd Ox, with holy garlands crown'd,</L>
<L>Prevents the blow, and feels an unexpected wound:</L>
<L>When I myself invok'd the Power Divine,</L>
<L>To drive this fatal pest from me and mine;</L>
<L>When now the priest with hands uplifted stood,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to strike, and shed the sacred blood,</L>
<L>The Gods themselves the mortal stroke bestow,</L>
<L>The victim falls, but they impart the blow:</L>
<L>Scarce was the knife with the pale purple stain'd,</L>
<L>And no presages could be then obtain'd</L>
<L>From putrid entrails, where th' infection reign'd.</L>
<L>Death stalk'd around with such resistless sway,</L>
<L>The temples of the Gods his force obey,</L>
<L>And suppliants feel his stroke while yet they pray.</L>
<L>"Go now, said he, your Deitie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> implore</L>
<L>For fruitless aid, for I defy their power."</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="89"/>Then with a curs'd malicious joy survey'd</L>
<L>The very altars, stain'd with trophies of the dead.</L>

<L>Strange madness that, when death pursued so fast,</L>
<L>T' anticipate the blow with impious haste.</L>
<L>No decent honours to their urns are paid,</L>
<L>Nor could the graves receive the numerous dead;</L>
<L>For or they lay unbury'd on the ground,</L>
<L>Or unadorn'd a needy funeral found:</L>
<L>All reverence past, the fainting wretches fight</L>
<L>For funeral piles which were another's right.</L>
<L>Unmourn'd they fall; for who surviv'd to mourn?</L>
<L>And sires and mothers unlamented burn:</L>
<L>Parents and sons sustain an equal fate,</L>
<L>And wandering ghosts their kindred shadows meet▪</L>
<L>The dead a larger space of ground require,</L>
<L>Nor are the trees sufficient for the fire.</L>
<L>Despairing under grief's oppressive weight,</L>
<L>And sunk by these tempestuous blasts of Fate,</L>
<L>"O Jove, said I, if common fame says true,</L>
<L>If e'er Aegina gave those joys to you,</L>
<L>If e'er you lay inclos'd in her embrace,</L>

<L>O father, if you do not yet disclaim</L>
<L>Paternal care, nor yet disown the name,</L>
<L>Grant my petitions; and with speed restore</L>
<L>My subjects numerous as they were before,</L>
<L>Or make me partner of the fate they bore."</L>
<L>I spoke, and glorious lightning shone around,</L>
<L>And rattling thunder gave a prosperous sound;</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="90"/>"So let it be; and may these omens prove</L>
<L>A pledge, said I, of your returning love!"</L>
<L>By chance a reverend oak was near the place,</L>
<L>Sacred to Jove, and of Dodona's race,</L>
<L>Where frugal Ants laid up their winter meat,</L>
<L>Whose little bodies bear a mighty weight:</L>
<L>We saw them march along, and hide their store,</L>
<L>And much admir'd their number, and their power;</L>
<L>Admir'd at first, but after envy'd more.</L>
<L>Full of amazement, thus to Jove I pray'd:</L>
<L>"O grant, since thus my subjects are decay'd,</L>
<L>As many subjects to supply the dead!"</L>
<L>I pray'd, and strange convulsions shook the oak,</L>
<L>Which murmur'd, though by ambient winds unshook:</L>
<L>My trembling hands, and stiff-erected hair,</L>
<L>Exprest all tokens of uncommon fear;</L>
<L>Yet both the earth and sacred oak I kiss'd,</L>
<L>And scarce could hope, yet still I hop'd the best;</L>
<L>For wretches, whatsoe'er the Fates divine,</L>
<L>Expound all omens to their own design.</L>
<L>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now 'twas night, when ev'n distraction wears</L>
<L>A pleasing look, and dreams beguile our cares.</L>
<L>Lo! the same oak appears before my eyes,</L>
<L>Nor alter'd in its shape, nor former size;</L>
<L>As many Ants the numerous branches bear,</L>
<L>The same their labour, and their frugal care;</L>
<L>The branches too a like commotion found,</L>
<L>And shook th' industrious creatures on the ground,</L>
<L>Who by degrees (what 's scarce to be believ'd)</L>
<L>A nobler form and larger bulk receiv'd,</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="91"/>And on the earth walk'd an unusual pace</L>
<L>With many st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides, and an erected face;</L>
<L>Their numerous legs and former colour lost,</L>
<L>The insects could a human figure boast.</L>
<L>I wake, and waking find my cares again,</L>
<L>And to the unperforming Gods complain,</L>
<L>And call their promise and pretences vain.</L>
<L>Yet in my court I heard the murmuring voice</L>
<L>Of strangers, and a mixt uncommon noise:</L>
<L>But I suspected all was still a dream,</L>
<L>Till Telamon to my apartment came,</L>
<L>Opening the door with an impetuous haste:</L>
<L>O come, said he, and see your faith and hopes surpast:</L>
<L>I follow; and, confus'd with wonder, view</L>
<L>Those shapes which my presaging slumbers drew:</L>
<L>I saw, and own'd, and call'd them subjects; they</L>
<L>Confest my power, submissive to my sway.</L>
<L>To Jove, restorer of my race decay'd,</L>
<L>My vows were first with due oblations paid.</L>
<L>I then divide with an impartial hand</L>
<L>My empty city, and my ruin'd land,</L>
<L>To give the new-born youth an equal share,</L>
<L>And call them Myrmidons, from what they were.</L>
<L>You saw their persons; and they still retain</L>
<L>The thrift of Ants, though now transform'd to Men.</L>
<L>A frugal people, and inur'd to sweat,</L>
<L>Labouring to gain, and keeping what they get.</L>
<L>These, equal both in strength and years, shall join</L>

<L>WHAT has this life to make it worth our care?</L>

<L>Gay bloomy joys with prickly sorrows join'd.</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="124"/>Howe'er, I cropt the branch; nor felt much pain;</L>
<L>Well pleas'd to think, when Abin saw the stain</L>

<L>With words and kisses sweet would heal the wound.</L>
<L>Mistaken maid! ne'er did my grated ear,</L>
<L>From lips so sweet, such rude revilings hear.</L>
<L>Now to my bower I tript; but, by the way,</L>
<L>Cull'd out the freshest flowers, the pride of May.</L>
<L>Arriv'd, full fair in front I fix'd the bough</L>
<L>With crimson ting'd; you guess the cause, I trow.</L>
<L>Then, on the turf-rais'd bank, adown I sat;</L>
<L>And often ey'd the distant five-barr'd yat,</L>

<L>Still joyous, thitherwards, the shepherd past.</L>
<L>Nor idly lais'd I, though my hand was sore,</L>

<L>By Abin's often singing there made tame:</L>
<L>Made tame by Abin's song, and so was I,</L>
<L>Erewhile so coldly coy, so simply shy.</L>
<L>Ah, why not shunn'd I still his tempting tale!</L>

<LG>
<L>OLD Chaucer doth of Topas tell,</L>
<L>Mad Rabelais of Pantagruell,</L>
<L>A latter third of Dowsabell</L>
<L>With such poor trifles playing:</L>
<L>Others the like have labour'd at,</L>
<L>Some of this thing, and some of that,</L>
<L>And many of they know not what,</L>
<L>But that they must be saying.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another sort there be, that will</L>
<L>Be talking of the Fayries still,</L>
<L>Nor never can they have their fill,</L>
<L>As they were wedded to them;</L>
<L>No tales of them their thirst can slake,</L>
<L>So much delight therein they take,</L>
<L>And some strange thing they fain would make,</L>
<L>Knew they the way to do them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then since no Muse hath been so bold,</L>
<L>Or of the later, or the old,</L>
<L>Those elvish secrets to unfold,</L>
<L>Which lie from others reading,</L>
<L>My active Muse to light shall bring</L>
<L>The Court of that proud Fayrie King,</L>
<L>And tell there of the Revelling.</L>
<L>Joan, prosper my proceeding.</L>

<L>And thou, Nymphidia, gentle Fay,</L>
<L>Which, meeting me upon the way,</L>
<L>These secrets didst to me betray,</L>
<L>Which now I am in telling;</L>
<L>My pretty light fantastic maid,</L>
<L>I here invoke thee to my aid,</L>
<L>That I may speak what thou hast said,</L>
<L>In numbers smoothly swelling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This palace standeth in the air,</L>
<L>By necromancy placed there,</L>
<L>That it no tempests needs to fear,</L>
<L>Which way so e'er it blow it;</L>
<L>And somewhat southward tow'rd the noon,</L>
<L>Whence lies a way up to the moon,</L>
<L>And thence the Fary can as soon</L>
<L>Pass to the earth below it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The walls of spiders legs are made,</L>
<L>Well mortized and finely laid,</L>
<L>He was the master of his trade</L>
<L>It curiously that builded:</L>
<L>The windows of the eyes of cats,</L>
<L>And for the roof, instead of slats,</L>
<L>Is cover'd with the skins of bats,</L>
<L>That are with moon-shine gilded.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence Oberon him sport to make</L>
<L>(Their rest when weary mortals take),</L>
<L>And none but only Faries wake,</L>
<L>Descendeth for his pleasure.</L>
<L><PB N="178" REF="192"/>And Mab his merry queen by night</L>
<L>Bestrides young folks that lie upright,</L>
<L>(In elder times the mare that hight)</L>
<L>Which plagues them out of measure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence shadows, seeming idle shapes,</L>
<L>Of little frisking elves and apes,</L>
<L>To earth do make their wanton scapes,</L>
<L>As hope of pastime hastes them:</L>
<L>Which maids think on the hearth they see,</L>
<L>When fires well near consumed be,</L>
<L>There dancing hays by two and three,</L>
<L>Just as their fancy casts them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These make our girls their sluttery rue,</L>
<L>By pinching them both black and blue;</L>
<L>And put a penny in their shoe,</L>
<L>The house for cleanly sweeping:</L>
<L>And in their courses make that round,</L>
<L>In meadows, and in marshes found,</L>
<L>Of them so call'd the Fary ground,</L>
<L>Of which they have the keeping.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These when a child haps to be got,</L>
<L>Which after proves an idiot,</L>
<L>When folk perceives it thriveth not,</L>
<L>The fault therein to smother,</L>
<L>Some silly doating brainless calf,</L>
<L>That understands things by the half,</L>
<L>Says that the Fary left his oaf,</L>
<L>And took away the other.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>
<L>But listen, and I shall you tell,</L>
<L>A chance in Fary that befell,</L>
<L>Which certainly may please some well;</L>
<L>In love and arms delighting:</L>
<L>Of Oberon, that jealous grew</L>
<L>Of one of his own Fary crew,</L>
<L>Too well (he fear'd) his Queen that knew,</L>
<L>His love but ill requiting.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pigwiggen was this Fary Knight,</L>
<L>One wondrous gracious in the sight</L>
<L>Of fair Queen Mab, which day and night</L>
<L>He amorously observed;</L>
<L>Which made King Oberon suspect</L>
<L>His service took too good effect,</L>
<L>His sauciness he often check'd,</L>
<L>And could have wish'd him starved.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pigwiggen gladly would commend,</L>
<L>Some token to Queen Mab to send,</L>
<L>If sea, or land, him aught could lend,</L>
<L>Were worthy of her wearing;</L>
<L>At length this lover doth devise</L>
<L>A bracelet, made of emmet's eyes.</L>
<L>A thing he thought that she would prize,</L>
<L>No whit her state impairing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And to the Queen a letter writes,</L>
<L>Which he most curiously endites,</L>
<L>Conjuring her, by all the rites</L>
<L>Of Love, she would be pleased</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="194"/>To meet him, her true servant, where</L>
<L>They might, without suspect or fear,</L>
<L>Themselves to one another clear,</L>
<L>And have their poor hearts eased.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At midnight the appointed hour,</L>
<L>And for the Queen a fitting bower,</L>
<L>(Quoth he) is that fair cowslip flower,</L>
<L>On Hipcut hill that groweth;</L>
<L>In all your train there's not a Fay,</L>
<L>That ever went to gather May,</L>
<L>But she hath made it in her way,</L>
<L>The tallest there that knoweth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When by Tom Thumb, a Fary page,</L>
<L>He sent it, and doth him engage,</L>
<L>By promise of a mighty wage,</L>
<L>It secretly to carry:</L>
<L>Which done, the Queen her maids doth call,</L>
<L>And bids them to be ready all,</L>
<L>She would go see her summer hall,</L>
<L>She could no longer tarry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her chariot ready straight is made,</L>
<L>Each thing therein is fitting laid,</L>
<L>That she by nothing might be staid,</L>
<L>For naught must her be letting.</L>
<L>Four nimble gnats the horses were,</L>
<L>Their harnesses of gossamere,</L>
<L>Fly Cranion her charioteer,</L>
<L>Upon the coach-box getting.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="181" REF="195"/>
<L>Her chariot of a snail's fine shell,</L>
<L>Which for the colours did excell:</L>
<L>The fair Queen Mab becoming well,</L>
<L>So lively was the limning:</L>
<L>The seat the soft wool of the bee;</L>
<L>The cover (gallantly to see)</L>
<L>The wing of a pied butterflee,</L>
<L>I trow 'twas simple trimming.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wheels compos'd of cricket's bones,</L>
<L>And daintily made for the nonce,</L>
<L>For fear of rattling on the stones,</L>
<L>With thistle down they shod it;</L>
<L>For all her maidens much did fear,</L>
<L>If Oberon had chanc'd to hear</L>
<L>That Mab his Queen should have been there,</L>
<L>He would not have aboad it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She mounts her chariot in a trice,</L>
<L>Nor would she stay for no advice,</L>
<L>Until her maids that were so nice</L>
<L>To wait on her were fitted,</L>
<L>But ran herself away alone;</L>
<L>Which when they heard, there was not one</L>
<L>But hasted after to be gone,</L>
<L>As she had been diswitted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hop, and Mop, and Drop so clear,</L>
<L>Pip, and Trip, and Skip, that were</L>

<L>Her special maids of honour:</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="196"/>Fib, and Tib, and Pinck, and Pin,</L>
<L>Tick, and Quick, and Jill, and Jin,</L>
<L>Tit, and Nit, and Wap, and Win,</L>
<L>The train that wait upon her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Upon a grashopper they got,</L>
<L>And what with amble, and with trot,</L>
<L>For hedge nor ditch they spared not,</L>
<L>But after her they hie them.</L>
<L>A cobweb over them they throw,</L>
<L>To shield the wind if it should blow,</L>
<L>Themselves they wisely could bestow,</L>
<L>Lest any should espy them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let us leave Queen Mab awhile.</L>
<L>Through many a gate, o'er many a stile,</L>
<L>That now has gotten by this wile,</L>
<L>Her dear Pigwiggen kissing;</L>
<L>And tell how Oberon doth fare,</L>
<L>Who grew as mad as any hare,</L>
<L>When he had sought each place with care,</L>
<L>And found his Queen was missing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By grisly Pluto he doth swear,</L>
<L>He rent his cloaths, and tore his hair,</L>
<L>And as he runneth here and there,</L>
<L>An acorn cup he greet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th;</L>
<L>Which soon he taketh by the stalk.</L>
<L>About his head he lets it walk,</L>
<L>Nor doth he any creature baulk,</L>

<L>The Tuscan Poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tasso.</NOTE> doth advance</L>
<L>The frantic Palatine of France;</L>

<L>Alcides in his fury;</L>
<L>And others Ajax Telamon:</L>
<L>But to this time there hath been none</L>
<L>So Bedlam as our Oberon,</L>
<L>Of which I dare assure you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And first encountering with a wasp,</L>
<L>He in his arms the fly doth clasp,</L>
<L>As though his breath he forth would grasp,</L>
<L>Him for Pigwiggen taking:</L>
<L>Where is my wife, thou rogue, quoth he,</L>
<L>Pigwiggen, she is come to thee,</L>
<L>Restore her, or thou dy'st by me:</L>
<L>Whereat the poor wasp, quaking,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cries, Oberon! great Fary King,</L>
<L>Content thee, I am no such thing,</L>
<L>I am a wasp, behold my sting:</L>
<L>At which the Fary started:</L>
<L>When soon away the wasp doth go,</L>
<L>Poor wretch was never frighted so,</L>
<L>He thought his wings were much too slow,</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd, they so were parted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He next upon a glow-worm light,</L>
<L>(You must suppose it now was night.)</L>
<L>Which, for her hinder part was bright,</L>
<L>He took to be a devil;</L>
<L><PB N="184" REF="198"/>And furiously doth her assail</L>
<L>For carrying fire in her tail,</L>
<L>He thrasht her rough coat with his flail,</L>
<L>The mad King fear'd no evil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A new adventure him betides,</L>
<L>He met an ant which he bestrides,</L>
<L>And post thereon away he rides,</L>
<L>Which with his haste doth stumble;</L>
<L>And came full over on her snout,</L>
<L>Her heels so threw the dirt about,</L>
<L>For she by no means could get out,</L>
<L>But over him doth tumble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And falling down into a lake</L>
<L>Which him up to the neck doth take,</L>
<L>His fury somewhat it doth slake,</L>
<L>He calleth for a ferry;</L>
<L>Where you may some recovery note,</L>
<L>What was his club, he made his boat,</L>
<L>And in his oaken cup doth float,</L>
<L>As safe as in a wherry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce set on shore, but therewithal</L>
<L>He meeteth Puck, which most men call</L>
<L>Hobgoblin, and on him doth fall,</L>
<L>With words from frenzy spoken;</L>
<L>Hoh, hoh! quoth Hob, God save thy grace,</L>
<L>Who drest thee in this piteous case?</L>
<L>He thus that spoil'd my Sovereign's face,</L>
<L>I would his neck were broken.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="185" REF="199"/>
<L>This Puck seems but a dreaming dolt,</L>
<L>Still walking like a ragged colt,</L>
<L>And oft out of a bush doth bolt,</L>
<L>Of purpose to deceive us;</L>
<L>And, leading us, makes us to stray</L>
<L>Long winter's nights out of the way,</L>
<L>And when we stick in mire and clay</L>
<L>Hob doth with laughter leave us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear Puck (quoth he) my wife is gone;</L>
<L>As e'er thou lov'st King Oberon,</L>
<L>Let every thing but this alone,</L>
<L>With vengeance and pursue her;</L>
<L>Bring her to me alive or dead,</L>
<L>Or that vile thief, Pigwiggen's head,</L>

<L>Quoth Puck, My liege I 'll never lin,</L>

<L>My dearest Lord ne'er doubt it;</L>
<L>Thorough brake, and thorough brier,</L>
<L>Thorough muck, and thorough mire,</L>
<L>Thorough water, thorough fire,</L>
<L>And thus goes Puck about it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This thing Nymphidia over-heard,</L>
<L>That on this mad King had a guard,</L>
<L>Not doubting of a great reward,</L>
<L>For first this business broaching;</L>
<L><PB N="186" REF="200"/>And through the air away doth go,</L>
<L>Swift as an arrow from the bow,</L>
<L>To let her Sovereign Mab to know</L>
<L>What peril was approaching.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Queen, bound with Love's powerful'st charm,</L>
<L>Sate with Pigwiggen arm in arm,</L>
<L>Her merry maids that thought no harm</L>
<L>About the room were skipping:</L>
<L>A humble-bee, their minstrel, play'd</L>
<L>Upon his hautboy; every maid</L>
<L>Fit for this revels was array'd,</L>
<L>The horn-pipe neatly tripping.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In comes Nymphidia, and doth cry,</L>
<L>My sovereign, for your safety fly,</L>
<L>For there is danger but too nigh,</L>
<L>I posted to forewarn you:</L>
<L>The King hath sent Hobgoblin out,</L>
<L>To seek you all the fields about,</L>
<L>And of your safety you may doubt,</L>
<L>If he but once discern you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When like an uproar in a town,</L>
<L>Before them every thing went down,</L>
<L>Some tore a ruff, and some a gown,</L>
<L>'Gainst one another justling:</L>
<L>They flew about like chaff i' th' wind,</L>
<L>For haste some left their masks behind;</L>
<L>Some could not stay their gloves to find,</L>
<L>There never was such bustling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="187" REF="201"/>
<L>Forth ran they by a secret way,</L>
<L>Into a brake that near them lay;</L>
<L>Yet much they doubted there to stay,</L>
<L>Lest Hob should hap to find them:</L>
<L>He had a sharp and piercing sight,</L>
<L>All one to him the day and night,</L>
<L>And therefore was resolv'd by flight</L>
<L>To leave this place behind them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length one chanc'd to find a nut,</L>
<L>In the end of which a hole was cut,</L>
<L>Which lay upon a hazel-root,</L>
<L>There scatter'd by a squirrel:</L>
<L>Which out the kernel gotten had;</L>
<L>When quoth this Fay, Dear Queen, be glad,</L>
<L>Let Oberon be ne'er so mad,</L>
<L>I'll set you safe from peril.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come all into this nut (quoth she)</L>
<L>Come closely in, be rul'd by me,</L>
<L>Each one may here a chooser be,</L>
<L>For room you need not wrastle.</L>
<L>Nor need you be together heapt:</L>
<L>So one by one therein they crept,</L>
<L>And lying down they soundly slept,</L>
<L>And safe as in a castle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nymphidia, that this wile doth watch,</L>
<L>Perceiv'd, if Puck the Queen should catch,</L>
<L>That he should be her over-match,</L>
<L>Of which she well bethought her;</L>
<L><PB N="188" REF="202"/>Found it must be some powerful charm,</L>
<L>The Queen against him that must arm,</L>
<L>Or surely he would do her harm,</L>
<L>For throughly he had sought her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And listening if she aught could hear,</L>
<L>That her might hinder, or might fear:</L>
<L>But finding still the coast was clear,</L>
<L>Nor creature had descry'd her;</L>
<L>Each circumstance and having scan'd,</L>
<L>She came thereby to understand,</L>
<L>Puck would be with them out of hand,</L>
<L>When to her charms she hied her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And first her fern-seed doth bestow,</L>
<L>The kernel of the misseltoe:</L>
<L>And here and there as Puck should go,</L>
<L>With terror to affright him,</L>
<L>She night-shade strews to work him ill,</L>
<L>Therewith her vervain and her dill,</L>
<L>That hindereth witches of their will,</L>
<L>Of purpose to despite him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then sprinkles she the juice of rue,</L>
<L>That groweth underneath the yew;</L>
<L>With nine drops of the midnight dew,</L>
<L>From Lunary distilling:</L>
<L>The molewarp's brain mixt therewithal,</L>
<L>And with the same the pismire's gall,</L>
<L>For she in nothing short would fall,</L>
<L>The Fayrie was so willing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="189" REF="203"/>
<L>Then thrice under a briar doth creep,</L>
<L>Which at both ends was rooted deep,</L>
<L>And over it three times doth leap;</L>
<L>Her magic much availing:</L>
<L>Then on Proserpina doth call,</L>
<L>And so upon her spell doth fall,</L>
<L>Which here to you repeat I shall,</L>
<L>Not in one tittle failing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"By the croaking of the frog,</L>
<L>By the howling of the dog,</L>

<L>By the doleful dying knell,</L>
<L>O let this my direful spell,</L>
<L>Hob, hinder thy surprizing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"By the mandrake's dreadful groans,</L>
<L>By the lubrican's sad moans,</L>
<L>By the noise of dead mens' bones</L>
<L>In charnel-houses rattling:</L>
<L>By the hissing of the snake,</L>
<L>The rustling of the fire-drake,</L>
<L>I charge thee, thou this place forsake,</L>
<L>Nor of Queen Mab be prattling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"By the whirlwind's hollow sound,</L>
<L>By the thunder's dreadful stound,</L>
<L>Yells of spirits under ground,</L>
<L>I charge thee not to fear us:</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her spell thus spoke, she stept aside,</L>
<L>And in a chink herself doth hide,</L>
<L>To see thereof what would betide,</L>
<L>For she doth only mind him:</L>
<L>When presently she Puck espies,</L>
<L>And well she mark'd his gloating eyes,</L>

<L>At length upon his feet he gets,</L>
<L>Hobgoblin fumes, Hobgoblin frets,</L>

<L>And through the bushes scrambles;</L>
<L>A stump doth trip him in his pace.</L>
<L>Down comes poor Hob upon his face,</L>

<L>Queen Mab and all her Fayrie rout:</L>
<L>And come again to have a bout</L>
<L>With Oberon yet madding:</L>
<L>And with Pigwiggen now distrought,</L>
<L>Who much was troubled in his thought,</L>
<L>That he so long the Queen had sought,</L>
<L>And through the fields was gadding.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And as he runs, he still doth cry,</L>
<L>"King Oberon, I thee defy,</L>
<L>And dare thee here in arms to try,</L>
<L>For my dear lady's honour:</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="206"/>For that she is a Queen right good,</L>
<L>In whose defence I 'll shed my blood,</L>
<L>And that thou in this jealous mood</L>
<L>Hast lay'd this slander on her."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And quickly arms him for the field,</L>
<L>A little cockle-shell his shield,</L>
<L>Which he could very bravely wield,</L>
<L>Yet could it not be pierced:</L>
<L>His spear abent, both stiff and strong.</L>
<L>And well near of two inches long:</L>
<L>The pile was of a horse-fly's tongue,</L>
<L>Whose sharpness nought reversed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And puts him on a coat of mail,</L>
<L>Which was made of a fish's scale,</L>
<L>That when his foe should him assail,</L>
<L>No point should be prevailing:</L>
<L>His rapier was a hornet's sting.</L>
<L>It was a very dangerous thing,</L>
<L>For if he chanc'd to hurt the King,</L>
<L>It would be long in healing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His helmet was a beetle's head,</L>
<L>Most horrible and full of dread,</L>
<L>That was able to strike one dead,</L>
<L>Yet did it well become him:</L>

<HEAD>THE QUEST OF CYNTHIA.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHAT time the groves were clad in green,</L>

<L>To seek them summer bowers;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forth rov'd I by the sliding rills</L>
<L>To find where Cynthia sat,</L>
<L>Whose name so often from the hills</L>
<L>The Echos wondered at.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When me upon my quest to bring,</L>
<L>That pleasure might excel,</L>
<L>The birds strove which should sweetliest sing,</L>
<L>The flowers which should sweetest smell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long wandering in the woods, said I,</L>
<L>Oh, whither 's Cynthia gone?</L>
<L>When soon the Echo doth reply</L>
<L>To my last word, <HI>Go on</HI>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length upon a lofty fir,</L>
<L>It was my chance to find,</L>
<L>Where that dear name most due to her</L>
<L>Was carv'd upon the rind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Which whilst with wonder I beheld,</L>
<L>The bees their honey brought,</L>
<L>And up the carved letters fill'd,</L>
<L>As they with gold were wrought.</L>

<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
<L>And near that tree's more spacious root,</L>
<L>Then looking on the ground,</L>
<L>The shape of her most dainty foot</L>
<L>Imprinted there I found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Which stuck there like a curious seal,</L>
<L>As though it should forbid</L>
<L>Us, wretched mortals, to reveal</L>
<L>What under it was hid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Besides, the flowers which it had press'd,</L>
<L>Appeared to my view</L>
<L>More fresh and lovely than the rest,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The clear drops in the steps that stood,</L>

<L>I ask'd some lilies, why so white</L>

<L>I ask'd a nodding violet, why</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>A bed of roses saw I there,</L>

<HEAD>NEREIDES: OR, SEA-ECLOGUES.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN DIAPER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the life of this ingenious poet, but few particulars are known. He was bred at Baliol College, Oxford; and by publishing the Eclogues here re-printed obtained the pa∣tronage of Swift, who thus describes the author and his poem: "Here is a young fellow has writ some sea-eclogues, poems of mermen, resembling pastorals of shepherds; and they are very pretty, and the thought is new. Mermen are he∣mermaids Tritons, natives of the sea. — His name is Diaper. I must do something for him, and get him out of the way. I hate to have any new wits rise; yet when they do rise, I would encourage them; but they tread on our heels, and thrust us off the stage." Journal to Stella, March 12, 1711-12. "The author of the Sea-Eclogues sent books to the Society yesterday, and we gave him guineas apiece; and may do fur∣ther for him." Ib. March 21. On the 23d of December Mr. Diaper presented to Lord Bolingbroke a new philosophical po∣em, "The Dryades, or the Nymph's Prophecy," (re-printed in Poetical Calendar, vol. IX. p. 17.) "which, says Swift, is a very good one; and I am to give him a sum of money from my Lord: and I have contrived to make a Parson of him, for he is half one already, being in Deacon's orders, and serves a small cure in the country; but has a sword at his tail here in town. It is a poor little short wretch, but will do best in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper give him a living." Two months after this, Swift kindly visited him "in a nasty gar∣ret, very sick; and gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bo∣lingbroke." Unfortunately for the poor poet, his friends lost their power before they had an opportunity of providing for him; and he died a country curate, in 1717, in the 29th year of his age. Besides the "Nereides" and "Dryades," he pub∣lished an imitation of an Ode of Horace, which is printed in the Supplement to Swift; assisted Mr. Rowe in the transla∣tion of Quillet's "Callipaedia," of which the first half of Book IV. is by Mr. Diaper; and left behind him in MS. a translation of the three first books of Oppian's Halicutics, which were printed by subscription, in 8vo. 1722, with the re∣mainder of the work executed by Mr. Jones, who was like∣wise of Baliol College.

Of this kind was the Girl kept at Harleim, who was so far rational as to be taught to spin, to understand those about her, and to express her devotions at prayers. We have an account in our English Chronicles of a Sea-inhabitant taken entirely human. Nay, if we believe History, the Sea has, as Du Bar∣tas expresses it, the Mitred Bishop, and the Cowled Fryar. Alexander ab Alexandro, after several other stories of the like nature, gives us the following relation, which, because it carries with it an air of truth, and is somewhat agreeable, I shall translate at length. "Theodorus Gaza, says he, a learn∣ed Greek, living in the Peloponnesus, saw a Nereid, with shoals of other fish, driven to shore by the violence of a sud∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n storm: her face was perfectly human, and not disagreea∣ble; her body scaly, and from the middle downward she seems to have been not unlike our common Sign-post Mermaids. The people flocked together to see this strange monster; who, when she perceived there was no possibility of escaping, shew∣ed all the marks of sorrow and distress. But, when the water had quite left her, and she saw herself exposed as an object of wonder to the multitude, she fetched the deepest sighs that grief could express, and burst out at length into a flood of tears. Gaza, who was a man naturally tender and compassio∣nate, took pity on this distressed Lady, and persuaded the people to suffer her to return to her native element." The same Author tells us, that Georgius Trapezuntius (another famous modern Greek) affirmed "That he saw, as he was walking on the shore, a handsome Girl from the waste up∣wards, who, by her often diving, seemed sporting herself in the water; and when she perceived she was discovered, im∣mediately disappeared." However it be, the antient Nymphs and Nereids, and the modern Mermaids, are sufficient grounds to free the supposition from absurdity, or extravagance: and since we have gone so far as to have found inhabitants in the Planets, I hope I shall not be condemned for having discover∣ed the manners and conversation of a people nearer home: be∣sides we know, that the agreeable images, which are drawn from things on Earth, bave been long since exhausted; but it will be allowed, that the beauties (as well as the riches) of the Sea are yet in a great measure untouched: and those who have made attempts that way, have only given us a few Pis∣catory Eclogues, like the first coasters, that always keep within sight of shore, and never venture into the ocean. Lu∣cian indeed has something of this nature; but, as his design was chiefly to expose the Heathen Deities, so it must be owned that the best of our modern productions are owing to those hints, which were taken from that great Wit.

But the place that Lord Falkland stumbled upon was yet more suited to his destiny, than the other had been to the King's; being the strong ex∣pression of Evander, upon the untimely death of his son, "Non haec, O Palla, &amp;c."

<BYLINE>BY HER HUSBAND, [MR. BIRCH <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>This valuable historical and biographical writer was born in the parish of St. John, Clerkenwell, on the 23d of November, 1705. His parents were both of them Quakers; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd his father, Joseph Birch, was a coffee mill-maker by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rade. Mr. Joseph Birch endeavoured to bring up his son to his own business; but so ardent was the youth's passion for reading, that he solicited his father to be indulged in this i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clination, promising, in that case, to provide for himself. The first school he went to was at Hemel-Hemsted in Hert∣fordshire. It was kept by John Owen, a rigid Quaker, for whom Mr. Birch afterwards officiated some little while as an usher. The next school was kept by one Welby, near Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, who never had above eight or ten scholars at a time, whom he professed to instruct in the Latin tongue in a year and a half. To him Mr. Birch was, likewise, an usher; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he also afterwards was to Mr. Besse, the famous Quaker, in George's Court in St. John's Lane, who published the posthu∣mous works of Claridge. It is farther said that he went to Ireland with Dean Smedley; but in what year, and how long he resided with the Dean, cannot now be ascertained. Smedley published in 1728 "A Specimen of an universal View of all the Eminent Writers on the Holy Scriptures; being a Collection of the dissertations, explications, and opi∣nions of learned men, in all ages, concerning the difficult pas∣sages and obscure texts of the Bible; and of whatsoever is to be met with, in profane authors, which may contribute to∣wards the better understanding of them." This extensive undertaking was intended to have been comprised in two large folio volumes: had the plan proceeded, it is no very far-fetched conjecture to suppose that Mr. Birch was to have been an assistant. He was indefatigable in his application, and stole many hours from sleep to increase his stock of know∣ledge. By this unremitting diligence, though he had not the happiness of an university education, he soon became qua∣lified to take holy orders in the church of England, to the surprize of his acquaintance. It is not precisely known when this event took place; but it must have been as early as 1728. In the same year he married the daughter of the Rev. Mr. Cox, to whom he was curate; and in this union he was sin∣gularly happy: but his felicity was of short duration, Mrs. Birch dying in less than twelve months after their marriage. The disorder which carried her off was a puerperal fever, and almost in the very article of her death she wrote to her hus∣band the following letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATE>"July 31, 1729.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>"This day I return you, my dearest life, my sincere, hearty thanks, for every favour bestowed on your most faith∣ful and obedient wife,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>HANNAH BIRCH."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>In 1732 he was recommended to the friendship and favour of the late Lord High Chancellor Hardwicke, then Attorney General; to which noble Peer, and to the present Earl of Hardwicke, he was indebted for all his preferments. The first proof he experienced of his patron's regard, was the liv∣ing of Ulting, in the county of Essex, in the gift of the crown, to which he was presented 1732. In 1734, he was appointed one of the domestic chaplains to the unfortunate Earl of Kilmarnock, who was beheaded 1746. Mr. Birch was chosen a member of the Royal Society, Feb. 20, 1734-5; and of the Society of Antiquaries, Dec. 11, 1735, of which he afterwards became Director till the year 1746. Before this the Marischal College of Aberdeen had conferred on him, by diploma, the degree of Master of Arts. In 1743, by the interest of Lord Hardwicke, he was presented by the crown to the sinecure rectory of Landewy Welfrey in the country of Pembroke; and in 1743-4 was preferred, in the same man∣ner, to the rectory of Siddington St. Peter's, in the county and diocese of Gloucester. We find no traces of his having taken possession of this living; and, indeed, it is probable that he quitted it immediately, for one more suitable to his incli∣nations, and to his literary engagements, which required his almost constant residence in town; for on the 24th of Febru∣ary, 1743-4, he was instituted to the united rectories of St. Michael, Wood-street, and St. Mary Staining; and in 1745-6 to the united rectories of St. Margaret Pattens, and St. Gabriel, Fenchurch-street (by Lord Chancellor Hard∣wicke, in whose turn the presentation then was). In Janu∣ary, 1752, he was elected one of the Secretaries of the Royal Society, in the room of Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, deceased. In January, 1753, the Marischal College of Aberdeen created him Doctor of Divinity; and in that year the same degree was conferred on him by archbishop Herring. He was one of the trustees of The British Museum, for which honour he was probably indebted to the present Earl of Hardwicke; as he was for his last preferment, the rectory of Depden in Essex, to which he was inducted Feb. 26, 1761. In the lat∣ter part of his life he was chaplain to the Princess Amelia. In 1765 he resigned his office of Secretary to the Royal So∣ciety. His health declining about this time, he was ordered to ride for the recovery of it; but being a bad horseman, and going out, Jan. 9, 1766, he was unfortunately thrown from his horse on the road betwixt London and Hampstead, and died on the spot, in the 61st year of his age, to the great re∣gret of the Doctor's numerous literary friends; and was bu∣ried in St Margaret Pattens. A list of his valuable publica∣tions may be seen in the new edition of the "Biographia Bri∣tannica." N.</P></NOTE>.] WRITTEN ON HER COFFIN.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A LOYAL EXHORTATION, 1688.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LORD LANSDOWNE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the testimonies of contemporary writers were to be relied on, this Nobleman would be intitled to the highest rank, as an accomplished gentleman, an exalted genius, and an excellent poet. Waller, Dryden, Addison, Pope, Boling∣broke, and Young, have borne evidence in the most ample manner to his abilities. He was a younger son of a younger mother, nearly related to the family of the earl of Bath; was born in 1667; became a member of Trinity College, Cambridge, at a very early period of life; took his degree of M. A. there at the age of 13 years; and was with diffi∣culty prevented from taking-up arms, both at the time of Monmouth's rebellion, and at the Revolution of King James. Having no public employment, being totally unconnected with the court, and possessed of but a contracted fortune, he devoted his attention during the reign of King William to literary pursuits and amusements, the fruits of which appear∣ed in his plays and poems, chiefly written within that period. At the accession of Queen Anne, he was chosen into parlia∣ment, and sate in the house of commons until he was created a peer. On the change of the ministry, in the year 1710, he was appointed secretary at war, and afterwards successively comptroller and treasurer of the household. His connections with the Tory ministers prevented his being employed in the succeeding reigns of George I. and II. in the former of which he fell under suspicion of plotting against the Government, and was committed to the Tower, where he was confined 17 months. The latter part of his life was spent in the cultivation of letters in an honourable retirement, univer∣sally beloved and respected by all orders of men.

Being so great an heiress, she was thrice mar∣ried, and twice a widow before she was sixteen. She was but four years old at her father's death; and being educated by her grandmother, the old countess of Northumberland, was, about the latter end of the year 1679, married first to Henry Cavendish earl of Ogle, only son and heir of Henry duke of Newcastle; but he departed this life Nov. 1, 1680. She was secondly married, or contracted, to Thomas Thynne es{que} of Longleate, who was assassinated on Sunday Feb. 12, 1681-2, as he was riding through Pall Mall in his coach by some russians hired by Count Coningsmarck, who had entertained presumptuous hopes of succeeding with this young heiress, if he could remove Mr. Thynne out of the way; but in this he was mistaken, for though he himself escaped the punish∣ment due for this horrible crime, he reaped no advantage from it; as, May 30, 1682, she was thirdly married to Charles Seymour duke of Somerset, being then only in her sixteenth year. Her grace was one of the greatest ornaments of Queen Anne's court, and succeeded the dutchess of Marl∣borough as groom of the stole. She died Nov. 23, 1722, aged 56. She was mother of Algernon duke of Somerset, and grandmother to lady Elizabeth Seymour, who has been so much admired and distinguished as dutchess of Nor∣thumberland. See Collins's Peerage, art.

She was a great favourite with Swift, who gives an account of her mar∣riage, Journal to Stella, Oct. 10, 1710; and, Jan. 3, 1712-13, thus affectionately speaks of her death: "I am just now told that poor dear lady Ashburnham, the duke of Ormond's daughter, died yesterday at her country-house. The poor creature was with child. She was my greatest favourite, and I am in excessive concern for her loss. I hardly knew a more valuable person on all accounts. Your must have heard me talk of her. I am afraid to see the duke and dutchess. She was naturally very healthy; I fear she has been thrown away for want of care. Pray condole with me. 'Tis ex∣tremely moving. Her lord is a puppy; and I shall never think it worth my while to be troubled with him now he has lost all that was valuable in his possession: yet I think he used her pretty well. I hate life, when I think it exposed to such accidents; and to see so many thousand wretches bur∣thening the earth, while such as her die, makes me think God did never intend life for a blessing." From these expres∣sions, Dr. Hawkesworth well observes, and those he uses in the account of the dutchess of Hamilton's affliction on the death of her husband (see his Journal to Stella, Nov. 15, 1712), Swift appears to have had a strong sympathy in the distress of others; which he has generally, even by his advo∣cates, been supposed to want.

<HEAD>SONG FOR ST. CECILIA'S DAY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. p. 28.64.357.—This song of Shadwell's, is selected as a specimen of his poetry, will serve to complete the series of verses in honour of St. Cecilia. N.</NOTE>. WRITTEN BY THO. SHADWELL <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thomas Shadwell es{que} (of a good family in Stafford∣shire) born at his father's seat at Stanton Hall in Nor∣folk about 1640, was educated at Caius College, Cambridge; and, after studying the law for some time in The Middle Temple, went abroad. On his return, he soon introduced himself by his dramatic writings to persons of the first con∣sequence; and obtained on the Revolution the office of Poet Laureat. "The revenue, says Dr. Johnson, which Dryden had enjoyed with so much praise, was transferred to Shadwell, an old enemy, whom he had formerly stigmatized by the name of <HI>Og.</HI> Dryden could not decently complain that he was deposed; but seemed very angry that Shadwell succeeded him, and has therefore celebrated the intruder's inauguration in a poem exquisitely satirical, called <HI>Mac Flecno</HI>." It has been well observed by another able writer, "that a satirist never pays the least regard to truth, when it interferes with the gratification of his resentment or spleen." Nothing can be falser than the idea intended to be conveyed in the follow∣ing couplet:
<Q><L>"Others to some faint meaning make pretence,</L>
<L>But Shadwell never deviates into sense."</L></Q>
Mr. Shadwell was far inferior to Dryden; but Shadwell did not write nonsense. Many of his comedies have fine strokes of humour, and abound in original characters strongly marked and well sustained. He had an uncommon quic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ness of writing. The earl of Rochester, who has observed that
<Q><L>"None seem to touch upon true comedy</L>
<L>But hasty Shadwell, and slow Wicherley,"</L></Q>
had still a better opinion of his conversat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on than of his writ∣ings; for he said, "that if he had burnt all he wrote, and printed all he spoke, he would have had more wit and humour than any other poet." He was a great favourite with Otway; who shared with him in the contempt of Dryden. He died Dec. 9, 1692: and a white marble monument, with his bust, was placed in Westminster Abbey by his son Sir John Shad∣well, physician to king George II. He wrote 17 plays, which need not be here enumerated; and was author of several small poems; the chief of which are, 1. the Ode here printed; 2. A congratulatory poem on the Prince of Orange's coming to England; 3. another on Queen Mary; and 4. a translation of the tenth satire of Juvenal. N.</NOTE>, ESQ. 1690.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ODE ON ST. CECILIA'S DAY,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. BRADY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Major Nicholas Brady (an officer of the king's army in the rebellion of 1641,) and of Martha daughter of Luke Gernon (a judge of singular meekness and probity). He was born at Bandon in the county of Cork, Oct. 28, 1659, and educated at St. Finberry's, in that county, under Dr. Tindall, till he was twelve years of age, when he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> removed to Westminster school, where he was chosen king's scholar, and thence elected student of Christ Church, Ox∣ford. Dr. Busby had always a particular regard for him; and at both those elections he was first and captain among all the candidates: after continuing at Oxford about four years, he went to Dublin, where his father resided; at which uni∣versity he immediately commenced B. A. and the following year M. A. When of due standing, the diploma for the degree of D. D. was, upon account of his uncommon merit, presented to him from that university while he was in Eng∣land, and brought over by Dr. Pratt, then senior travelling-fellow, and afterwards provost of that college. His first pre∣ferment in the church was to a prebend, in the cathedral of St. Bury's, in the city of Cork, and to the parish of Kina∣glarchy, in the county of Cork; to which he was collated by Bp. Wettenhall, to whom he was domestic chaplain. He was a zealous promoter of the Revolution, and an eminent sufferer for it. In 1690, when the troubles broke out in Ireland, by his interest with General Mac Carty, he thrice prevented the burning of Bandon town, after three several orders from king James to destroy it. The same year, hav∣ing been deputed by the people of Bandon, he went over to England, to petition the parliament for a redress of some grievances they had suffered. During his stay there, and to the time of his death, he was in the highest esteem among all ranks of persons in that kingdom, for his eminent at∣tachment to the true interest of his country. June 29, 1690, he married Laetitia daughter of Dr. Synge, archdeacon of Cork, and a near relation of the bishop of that name. By this lady he had four sons and four daughters. Having quitted his preferments in Ireland, he settled in London, where he became noted for his abilities in the pulpit, and was elected minister of St. Catharine Creechurch, in 1691, and lecturer of St. Michael, Wood-street. He soon after, in conjunction with Mr. Tate, undertook a new version of the Psalms, which have since (though Brady's share of it incurred the ridicule of Swift in his "Remarks on Gibbs,") been adopted in a considerable number of our parish churches. Whilst he was engaged in this undertaking, he retired to Richmond in Surrey; and, in consequence of the high es∣teem entertained for him by the gentlemen of that village, was invited to accept the office of their minister. The vi∣carage of Stratford upon Avon was presented to him by the great earl of Dorset; and the rectory of Clapham in Surrey by Dame Rebekah Atkins, relict of Sir Richard Atkins, bart. This rectory he held, with Richmond, till his death. He was also chaplain to the duke of Ormond's troop of horse-guards, as he was to king William and queen Mary, and afterwards to queen Anne. The whole of his prefer∣ments, which were in very pleasant and elegible situations, amounted to six hundred pounds a-year. His qualifications, it is said, would have raised him to some of the greatest dig∣nities in the church, if the singular humanity and benevo∣lence of his disposition would have suffered him to have run in with the vehemence of either prevailing party, or had he not settled in a country where he was regarded as a foreigner. Dr. Brady wrote a Play, called
<Q>“The Rape, or The Innocent Impostors, a Tragedy, acted at Drury Lane, 1692,”</Q>
and published in 4to, in that year, with his name. He died March 20, 1726, in the 67th year of his age, leaving behind him the character of being a person of a most obliging, sweet, affable temper, a polite gentleman, an excellent preacher, and a good poet. His publications are, 1. The version of the Psalms; 2. The Aeneids of Virgil, published by subscription, 2 vols. 8vo. the last of them in 1726. He also published, in his life time, two volumes of Sermons, printed at London in 1704 and 1706; to which a third (posthumous) volume was added in 1730. N.</NOTE>, 1692.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>AS ALTERED BY MR. POPE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Set to music by Dr. Greene, in 1730, as an exercise on taking his degree of Doctor of Music in the university of Cambridge. It was performed with great applause; and, as an additional testimony to his merit, Dr. Greene was honoured with the title of professor of music at Cambridge. To answer Greene's purpose, Mr. Pope condescended to make considerable alterations in the poem, and at his request to insert in it one stanza, viz. the third. As he thereby rendered it greatly diffe∣rent from the ode originally published, I shall make no apo∣logy to my readers for copying it from the valuable work in which it first appeared in print, the "History of Music," by Sir John Hawkins.
