Most ILLUSTRIOUS LADY
REASON:
First Monarch of the World:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Emperess of the East, West, North and South:
Hereditary Director of Mankind: Guide of the
Passions: Lady of the Vast Continent of Human
Understanding: Mistress of all the Islands of
Science: Governess of the Fifteen Provinces of

<OPENER>May it Please Your Majesty;</OPENER>
<P>THE Author of this Book thought himself oblig'd
to Dedicate it to your Majesty first, as an Hum∣ble
Acknowledgment of your Superiour Authority
over all Laws and Princes of the World: He acknow∣ledges
that your Majesty's Right of Government is <HI>Jure
Divino;</HI> and that therefore your Majesty is a just Ex∣ception
to the General Rules here laid down, your Autho∣rity
is truly Sacred, and to your Majesty all the Powers of
<PB REF="4"/>
Men as well as their Actions pay a Just Homage; all Laws
made contradicting your Absolute Pleasure, are <HI>ipso facto</HI>
void in their own Nature, and whatever the greatest
Princes in the World act contrary to your Majesty's
Commands is ridiculous and impertinent, and their Sub∣jects
ought to Disobey them in it; your Majesty Reigns
with an Uncontroul'd Sovereignty in the very Hearts of
your Subjects; your Power is wholly Despotick, You
are truly accountable to none but your Maker, and your
Majesty's imnediate Adherence to his Sovereign Will,
gives the true Sanction to all your most exact Commands.</P>
<P>And yet your Majesty is far from being a Tyrant,
since at the same time that you Command the most Absolute
Obedience, such is the Demonstration of your Royal Justice,
that You gain upon the very Souls of your Subjects, and they
pay a voluntary Homage to all your Commands.</P>
<P>Having thus in brief Recogniz'd your Majesty's Un∣doubted
Divine Right to a Superiority over all the Actions
of Men; I then with the Profoundest Submission and
Obedience to your Royal Authority, proceed most humbly
to lay the following Papers at your Royal Feet; Appeal∣ing
from all the unjust Censures of Partial and Corrupted
Men, to your Majesty's Impartial Judgment, for their
Sincerity, and Correspondence with your Establish'd
Government; entirely submitting both them and their
Author to your Majesty's Authority, as becomes,</P>
<CLOSER>May it please Your Imperial Majesty,
Your Majesty's most Humble, most Obedient, and
most Devoted Subject and Servant,

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Satyr</HI> had never been Publish'd, tho' some of it has been
a long time in being, had not the World seem'd to be going
mad a second Time with the Error of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and
<HI>Non-Resistance.</HI></P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Sacred</HI> has been added to that of <HI>Majesty</HI> by the Complai∣sance
of a Party, who have all along been rather ready to talk of Loyalty,
than perform it, and who have shown themselves wonderful forward to
tax other People with Rebellion and Disloyalty, in order to perswade
their Princes to trust them in their most emergent Occasions; but when
their King had the Misfortune to believe them honest, he paid too dear for
the Mistake; for as they were the first that prompted him to want their
Assistance, they were also the first that let him want it.</P>
<P>When our Blessed Saviour only talk'd of his approaching Sufferings, and
things were seen in Perspective, they were all for dying with him, and
dying for him; but when the Band of Soldiers came, when <HI>Judas</HI> had
given the Signal, and their Lord was in the hands of his Enemies, <HI>They
all forsook him and fled.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis a Mystery to me what these Gentlemen start this lost Doctrine
in the World again for, Have they any more Kings or Queens to betray?
Do they think any Prince in the World will ever be so weak to take
their words again? a Man once perjur'd, no Justice of the Peace will
ever administer an Oath to him again; I believe I am in no danger of
being thought a <HI>Jacobite;</HI> but this I must affirm, had I told K. <HI>James</HI> II.
'twas my Principle, that I ought not to resist him, whatever vio∣lence
he offered either to me or mine; That, as he was a King, his
Person was Sacred, and that if he oppress'd me in the Highest Man∣ner;
nay, if he demanded my Life or Estate by Force, I ought and
would Submit to him, and if I could not obey his Commands, I durst
not oppose his Punishment. Had I told him that he was King by inhe∣rent
Birth-right, and his Power was <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> and therefore to re∣sist
him in any thing, tho' never so contrary to Reason or Justice,
was to fight against God, and pursuant to this Exposition of my Loyalty,
had I sworn the Oath of my Allegiance, and subscrib'd the Declaration;
if ever I took Arms against him, resisted or oppos'd him, I should have
<PB N="ii" REF="6"/>
been guilty of a most horrible Perjury, and Breach of Faith, and ought
never to be believ'd on my Word or Oath again.</P>
<P>As for me, I never understood my Loyalty, nor my Princes Au∣thority,
in such an extended Sense; I never took any such Oath; and
therefore the joining with a Foreign Power in such a Case, cannot
bear the same Construction: From such as were of this Opinion no King
can expect any other than whenever they attempt to ruin the Constitu∣tion,
suspend the Laws, and invade Property, they will never be obey'd;
the People will oppose such Oppression, and if they do not, 'tis for want
of Power, not for want of Will.</P>
<P>But in this Case the weight of the Matter lies higher, if there be an Er∣ror
in the resisting Tyrannick Princes, 'tis in Principle, <HI>and that I never yet
saw prov'd;</HI> but this is a meer Fraud, a Cheat put upon Princes, to encourage
them to be Tyrants on Pretence of Passive Submission; and that they
will, like <HI>Issachar</HI>'s <HI>Ass,</HI> couch down under the Load, but when the Prince
taking them at at their word, ventures to lay the Burden on their Backs,
they rise up and kick him in the Face.</P>
<P>Of all the People in the World these Gentlemen should have done
with this old Sham; one Jest at a time is enough for a Nation; one
King in an Age is enough to be cheated.</P>
<P>Besides, Who are they for? <HI>Qui vive?</HI> What Party are they of? The
Church of <HI>England</HI> cannot but think they design to banter her, that 'tis
a Whig-Plot to rip up old Matters; and that because she has once com∣mitted
a Fault, they are always reproaching her with it: what tho' she
was drawn in to own a Doctrine, and almost mix it with her Creed.
That when she came to the Extremity, she found would not hold Wa-Water,
What then? <HI>She was mistaken,</HI> and 'tis no Disgrace or Reflection,
for any Church or any People or Person, when they find themselves in an
Error, to own it, acknowledge and reform it: But to bring the same obso∣lete
abdicated Principle in play again, and father it upon the Church
too, this can be nothing but a Combination to expose her.</P>
<P>What would any King of <HI>England</HI> think of the Men that should talk
this Language to them again, that should come to a Prince and say, Sir,
you need never fear any disturbance from your Loyal Subjects the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> for whatever you do to them, they'll submit, 'tis their
Principle, and they profess to believe that you are God's Vicegerent, ac∣countable
to no Body; That you can do no Wrong; That your Crown
is held immediately of God, and Independent of the Laws; and there∣fore
if your Occasions should require you to pinch them a little in their
Property, or dispense with the Execution of the Laws, or the like, you
need not fear; the Church will always stand by you with her Life and
Fortunes. What would a King of any Policy answer? I know not in∣deed,
but if I were to make an Answer for him it should be, <HI>Salisbury for
that; I'll not venture you:</HI> Shall any Man pretend to be a Friend to the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and set a foot again the Doctrine of the King's Ab∣solute
Power? If the King can do no Wrong, somebody did the late
King a great deal of Wrong; Are evil Counsellors only punishable and
accountable for the Mismanagements of the Government? Where then
was the Justice of this sort of Churchmen, who flew in the Face of
their King, and never punish'd one of his Evil Counsellors? the Unac∣countable
King was Dethroned, but his Accountable Ministers conti∣nued
<PB N="iii" REF="7"/>
in play, and perhaps some of them bought their Employments with
his Money; Was king <HI>James</HI> treated like a Man <HI>that could do no Wrong,</HI>
and was not Accountable? Let those who blame some People for the in∣consistency
of their Principles, reconcile if they can the Doctrine of Pas∣sive-Obedience,
Non-Resistance, and the Kings being not Accountable,
to the Practice of the High-Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Primitive Part
of the Late Revolution.</P>
<P>I think my self unconcern'd to enlarge here upon the incoherent Non∣sense
that this Doctrine abounds with: The Church of <HI>England</HI> is bound
to show it, to justify her own Actings in Dethroning the Late King, and
it is a double <HI>Satyr</HI> upon the Church to pretend to vindicate it; it being
impossible to reconcile the principle of Passive Obedience with the whole
Proceeding of the Late Revolution; if the Doctrine be true, <HI>if the King
can do no Wrong,</HI> if it be lawful on no Account whatever to resist his Power,
or take up Arms in Defence of Liberty, Law, Religion or Property,
however oppress'd or endanger'd: These are some of the most inevita∣ble
Consequences.</P>
<P>All the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy and Commons of <HI>England,</HI> who
either invited over, or join'd with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and afterwards
consented to his being made King; all those who swore to him when he
was King, or that have since concur'd in the New Establishments, are
all Perjur'd Rebels; abominable, and to be abominated by all good
Men; are never to be trusted or believ'd again, neither <HI>when they Say,</HI>
nor <HI>when they Swear;</HI> the Crime ought never to be forgotten by Men,
nor without Repentance will be forgiven by Heaven; and till some Ge∣neral
Act of Revocation be made by the whole United Authority of the
Kingdom, and Justice done, the <HI>English</HI> should be stigmatiz'd thro' all
the World as a Nation without Faith, Honesty, or Principle.</P>
<P>But if the People of <HI>England were in the Right,</HI> if the Depredations made
on the Ancient Rights of the Nation were a just Foundation of suspend∣ing
the General Allegiance, and applying to a foreign Prince, for the re∣dressing
the Nations Grievances; if the <HI>English</HI> Nation had both Reason
and Right to oblige the King to give the Laws their Course and to let
every Man enjoy his Property: If the King is guilty of doing Wrong,
and both he and his Counsellors may be punish'd for the same; He by
making War against him, and they by the Axe and the Halter: In a
word, if the present Establishment, of the Late King, or present Queen,
if the late or present Parliament are fix'd on any Justice, Law or Rea∣son,
then this <HI>Satyr</HI> is just, the Argument good, and the <HI>English</HI> has
done no Wrong.</P>
<P>That Kings are not Kings <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> that when they break the
Laws, trample on Property, affront Religion, invade the Liberties of Na∣tions,
<HI>and the like,</HI> they may be opposed and resisted by Force.</P>
<P>The present Publication of this <HI>Satyr</HI> has oblig'd me to consider of
Circumstances, and as there are some Truths which do suit all Times,
I have laid by a Second Volume; not that I think there is any thing
in it which is not as fit to see the Light as this; but I say of it, as the
Apostle in another Case, <HI>I have many things to say, but you cannot bear
them now.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="8"/>
The second Part I confess was the first in Action, and contains some
Characters, and some Enlargements on particular Transactions, which
for ought I know might not give Offence, and I am perswaded would
not from another Pen; neither had this been mention'd, but to let
those Gentlemen, who may think this incompleat without it, know, That
no other reason prevented its running a further length, than those
Prudentials, which I have not been over-apt to make use of in other
Cases.</P>
<P>I confess I am sorry I should entertain any Fears that this Nation should
resent a thing wrote against a Principle, which is the greatest Affront
to the present Establishment that can possibly be thought of; and nothing
but the Power of Prejudice could move such a thing, but since some Peo∣ple
who are too apt to make Misconstruction, watch for my Miscarriage,
I sacrifice the remaining part of this Work to their Malice, not at all at
the same time thinking they act either with Justice or Honour.</P>
<P>I have concluded this Volume with a just Acknowledgment in behalf
of my Native Country to the present and last Reign, for that visible
Difference appearing in them between the Reign of Tyrants, and the
Reign of just Princes, when Property is secur'd under just Laws pun∣ctually
observ'd, and the Crown enjoying a due Extent, is nevertheless
limitted by those Laws; when the executive Power acknowledging the
just Superiority of the Law, regulates it self according to the true in∣tent
and meaning of all Power; <HI>The Publick Good.</HI></P>
<P>If any are so weak as to suppose this is a <HI>satyr</HI> against Kingly Govern∣ment,
and wrote to expose Monarchy; I think I should sufficiently
answer so soolish a Piece of Raillery, by saying only, <HI>they are mistaken.</HI></P>
<P>But because some Men require more explicit Answers than others; I
take the Liberty to declare, that I not only now, but on all Occasions,
when there was less need of vindicating my Opinion, have declared my
Belief to be, that a Monarchy according to the present Constitution limit∣ted
by Parliament, and <HI>dependent upon Law,</HI> is not only the best Govern∣ment
in the World; but also <HI>the best for this Nation in particular,</HI> most
suitable to the <HI>Genius</HI> of the People, and the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of the whole
Body; a <HI>Commonwealth</HI> can never suit a Nation where there is <HI>so Illu∣strious
a Nobility,</HI> and so numerous a <HI>Gentry;</HI> the Emulations, Factions and
Parties of such Men, are apt to be too turbulent for such a Government.
If we were a Nation of <HI>meer Plebeii,</HI> all Commoners, or the like, other
Arguments might be us'd: But as it is, I am fully perswaded of the be∣nefit
of a Monarchical Government to the whole Body; and I must
tell the Objector, no Man is likelier to be a faithful Subject to a Mo∣narchy,
than he who is convinc'd in his Judgment of its being,
not only a Good Government, but <HI>the best for the Publick Benefit.</HI></P>
<P>But this I can defend without being of opinion, That Kings came
down from Heaven <HI>with Crowns upon their Heads,</HI> and the People were
all born <HI>with Sadles on their Backs;</HI> I own I am none of <HI>Issachar</HI>'s <HI>Asses,</HI>
nor should I be willing to be govern'd by the <HI>Czar of Muscovy;</HI> I don't
think if a King wanted to walk cross a dirty High Way, his Majesty
might command 20 or 30 of the Heads of his Followers to be cut off to
make Steppings for him, that he might not dirty his <HI>Sacred Shoes.</HI> I pro∣fess
<PB N="v" REF="9"/>
my self a dutyful Subject to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and in that word
I mean to what Head soever on which <HI>the Parliament of England</HI> shall place
the Crown; but I own no King who shall ever wear it without Con∣sent
of Parliament, no King who shall after such Consent employ the Powers
of it <HI>to the Destruction of the Law,</HI> and Constitution of the Nation, who
shall invade the Property of the Subject, invert the Publick Justice, or
overthrow the Religion and Liberty of <HI>England;</HI> such a Prince is a
Tyrant, and <HI>may be deposed</HI> by the <HI>same Power</HI> that plac'd him upon the
Throne; any Hereditary Succession, Pretended Divine Right, Supreme
Power, or other Matter, Cause or Thing <HI>to the contrary in any wise not∣withstanding.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> Consisting of the King, Lords and Com∣mons,
are to me the Supreme Channel of Power, the Great Collective
Body in Miniature; their Right has a much fairer Character of Divinity
upon it than the Regal, being deriv'd from their Propriety in the Free∣hold;
the Land is their own, this Island is their own, and every Man
has a Right of Government, who has a a Right of Possession.</P>
<P>Kings, <HI>say our Champions of Absolute Power,</HI> have their Authority from God,
<HI>and from him only;</HI> of such Gentlemen it would be well to ask some such
Questions as these; When they receive this Power? And what Kings are
they have it? If all Kings have it, then the Usurper who murthers the
Right Heir has it, and Crookback <HI>Richard</HI> had it, and was King <HI>Jure
Divino;</HI> and what was <HI>Henry</HI> VII. then? to take up Arms against a
Rightful, Lawful Prince, who had his Power immediately from the Most
High, and was accountable to none but him? If Usurpers have not this
Divine Right, Where then will you find it? And what Nation has a
Prince whose Line did not begin at some Period of Usurpation, or in the
Injury of the Right of another; or, in short, by some unjust Suc∣cession?</P>
<P>If a Usurper then has no Right, he has not a Divine Right; if he
has any Right, he is no more an Usurper.</P>
<P>They that will make no Distinction between Person and Power in this
Case, would do well to tell us where this Wonder of a King is born: let
them show us this Star, that we may go and worship; I think we may
fairly challenge them to show us a Line of Kings in the World, that is
not full of Usurpations.</P>
<P>But if we grant <HI>this Divine Right,</HI> and particularly grant it in our own
Line, which I believe is as clear from such Interruptions as any in the
World can pretend to.</P>
<P>Then a certain University which burnt the Books of our Late Phana∣tical
Authors concerning the Distinctions, between the Person and the
Power of the King, should now burn the new Distinctions between a
King <HI>de Jure,</HI> and a King <HI>de Facto,</HI> and should now burn all their Pane∣gyricks
and Pastorals, their Speeches, flattering Declamations, printed by
Church-Authority, and made in Praise of King <HI>William,</HI> and on the Death
of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>They would do well to acquaint the World how he came to be King,
and her present Majesty to be his Successor; and if K. <HI>James</HI> had a Divine
Right, which I believe he had as much as ever any King of <HI>England</HI> had,
which is just none at all; and if he was accountable to no Body, how
<PB N="vi" REF="10"/>
the Church will answer trampling on that Divine Right, and bringing
in a Foreign Power to question him for Malversation of Government.</P>
<P>Will they tell us at the <HI>Boyn,</HI> Did they fight against his Person or his
Power? Did they there distinguish between the Man and the King?
Did they not in Monthly Fasts and Daily Prayers, give God thanks for
the Peoples victory over their Late Monarch? Did they not pray for
Success against him, and make Bonfires when they had it?</P>
<P>Every Panegyrick upon King <HI>William,</HI> was a Ballad upon King <HI>James,</HI>
and a Lampoon upon Divine Right; if this Doctrine have any Truth in it,
<HI>these Gentlemen have but little in them;</HI> and the Church of <HI>England</HI> has
more to answer for, than all the Churches in the Christian World.</P>
<P>But she is wiser, the Doctrine of Government and Obedience is settled
by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and confirm'd by Parliament; and 'tis an
unaccountable Affront to both, but particularly to the Church, to pre∣tend
to father this Doctrine upon her, when with Arms in her hands
she has declar'd her self to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> has not only deposed the King that pretended
<HI>to this empty Title,</HI> and that encourag'd this Doctrine, but has deposed
the very Doctrine it self; and condemn'd it as absurd and ridiculous,
and this both by Practice and Profession; and how should the Church of
<HI>England</HI> do any otherwise? when her very Foundation stands <HI>upon this
Deposing Power:</HI> Has she not practis'd it to secure her own Foundation,
and justified it it as a Necessity very well to be defended? What greater
Argument was given for inviting the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to come over with
an Army? and what greater Argument can be given, <HI>than that</HI> King
<HI>James,</HI> mov'd by Popish Counsels, and undermin'd and invaded the
Church of <HI>England?</HI>—This was the universal Complaint, the Fact was
true beyond Contradiction; the Attempt was not denied even by those
that were concern'd in it: For this the Church of <HI>England</HI> had recourse
to a Foreign Power: for this she took Arms, and Fled for recourse <HI>to her
Native Right,</HI> and to the <HI>People of England,</HI> who at all times were her
Refuge, and who ever will be so.</P>
<P>Nor is this the first time the People of <HI>England</HI> have done thus by a great
many, the Barons Wars are standing Records of the just Title the
<HI>English</HI> Nation had to their Antient Privileges, and by Consequence, to
defend them when invaded even by their Kings themselves; the several
Contraventions of Treaties, Breaches of Oaths, and Invasions of
Right in King <HI>John</HI> against the Liberties of his Subjects, we find
justified the Treaty they made with Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> Son to the King of
<HI>France,</HI> who the <HI>English</HI> Nobility and Gentry invited over, to free them
from the Male-administration of the Tyrant, and whom they join'd with
all their Forces at his Arrival, defeating their King by his Assistance in
the Battle near <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>And after the Death of King <HI>John,</HI> when the Earl Marshal in a
Speech perswaded the <HI>English</HI> Nobility to accept of the young Prince
<HI>Henry</HI> Son of King <HI>John</HI> to be their King; he recommends him not bare∣ly
as his Son, or having a Divine Right in his Succession, but as he had
by his tender Years been capable of no part in the Evil Government of
his Father, he desires them to pity his Youth, and not deprive him
<PB N="vii" REF="11"/>
for the Sin of his Father: Upon which they unanimously made him
King.</P>
<P>I know no Parallel Case so exactly Suits the calling over the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> as this calling over Prince <HI>Lewis:</HI> Nor was it from any sense of
King <HI>John</HI>'s Title, or their want of a just Right to Depose him, that
they did not actually declare <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> their King: But first K. <HI>John</HI>
did not Abdicate and leave the Kingdom, and consequently the Throne
vacant; and had not King <HI>James</HI> done so in too much haste for him, it
had been very difficult to have declar'd King <HI>William</HI> during his Life;
but the <HI>French</HI> began to be insolent and haughty, and rendred them∣selves
intolerable to the <HI>English;</HI> which alienated the minds of the Peo∣ple,
and especially of the Gentry from them, and serv'd to hasten the ac∣knowledging
the Son of their late King.</P>
<P>Nor had it been any Question, but that had King <HI>James</HI> left a Son in
<HI>England</HI> behind him a Protestant, and claiming the Crown, he would
have had it—But had the Birth of his Son been unquestion'd here, his
carrying him away into <HI>France</HI> certainly depriv'd him as effectually as it
did his Father.</P>
<P>The next General Instance of the Peoples taking up Arms in <HI>England</HI>
against their Sovereign, is in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. I know there
were Wars in <HI>England</HI> on various Occasions between the Houses of <HI>Lancaster</HI>
and <HI>York,</HI> besides the Quarrel between <HI>Rich.</HI> 3. and <HI>Heb.</HI> D. of <HI>Richmond;</HI>
but these were rather Disputes of Rival Titles to the Crown, than uni∣versal
Desertions of the opprest People from their Subjection to their in∣vading
Princes.</P>
<P>But examining the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. you find none of the
Nations either of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> disputing the Legality of
his Title to Govern, but the Legality of his Governing—And therefore
with Submission to some Gentlemen, who will not bear the Comparison
between the Late Revolution, and the Parliament War, I must say, that
distinguishing rightly, the Comparison is very just, and the Parts have
an exact Connexion, so far as it was a Parliament-War.</P>
<P>It is therefore for want of distinguishing rightly of the several Parts
of those Transactions, which Causes the Beginners of one Action, to en∣title
Heaven to the Wonders of the Revolution, and the other fall under
the Scandal of Rebellion.</P>
<P>I know some People will not bear the Comparison, and sometimes are
apt to let their Patience forsake them when 'tis attempted: but if
they return to their Temper, be pleas'd to let their Judgments be gui∣ded
by the Nature of things, and the true History of those Times guide
them, they will see less difference here than perhaps they imagine.</P>
<P>To clear up this Point, it will be necessary to examine the Originals of
both these Wars.</P>
<P>The Complaints of the People in those days against the King's Inva∣sion
of their Rights, are not only acknowledg'd to be just by my Lord
<HI>Clarendon,</HI> who sufficiently blames the Conduct of that King; but even
by that King himself, when he pass'd the Famous Petition of Right, a
thing in its own Nature exactly the same with the Declaration of Right
at the Revolution: The words of the King at the passing that Petition,
which was converted into a Law, were, <HI>Soit Droit comme it est Desire.</HI>

Let Right be done you, as you Demand—A plain Acknowledgment,
not only that it was their Right they demanded; but also that they had
a Right to demand it.</P>
<P>The several Concessions at other Times made by the King, <HI>whose Mis∣fortune
was sometimes to grant too much, and at other times to little,</HI> were plain
Acknowledgments, that he had given them good occasion to complain.</P>
<P>'Twas for these Rights afterwards invaded, that the Parliament and
the King unhappily differ'd; I won't trouble the Reader with the De∣bate,
who began the War, who run things to needless Extremities, or
whether both Sides, <HI>Led by England</HI>'s <HI>Fate,</HI> did not incur the blame of
being too blind to the Calamities that ensued—But I no way excuse
what the Consequence of these things was in excusing the first Contrivers
and Beginners of them from having the least hand in, or Design of bring∣ing
things to the Extremities that follow'd.</P>
<P>There were a great many honest Gentlemen in that Parliament, who,
tho' they thought themselves oblig'd in Duty to their Posterity, to con∣tend
with the utmost Vehemence for the Liberty of their Country, yet
had no manner of Design to Dethrone the Monarchy, overturn and sub∣vert
the Constitution, and bring this Nation under the Tyrranny of a
Standing Army.</P>
<P>As to the Death of the King, their future Behaviour testified for them,
both in their Treatment of the King, while he was in their Power, and
their Resentment of the Usage he met with when he was taken out of
their Power, by the Soldiers, That they were innocent so much as of
the Thought.</P>
<P>I cannot deny what I have so often affirm'd in another Case, which
I say is parallel to this, that from the time they took up Arms, every
Battle fought, every shot made, every Gun fired, was a tacit killing the
King, and that so every Member of that Parliament had a hand in kil∣ling
the King.</P>
<P>But when these Gentlemen had brought the War to Conclusion, and
had the King in their Power, What did they do? did they not according to
their Treaty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> treat him with Freedom, Honour and Safety?
Did they not seriously apply themselves to a Treaty with him for the set∣tling
the Nation, upon such a Foundation as they thought agreeable
to what they had fought for? And did they not consent to restore him to his
Crown and Dignity, and to return to their Obedience upon such Condi∣tions
as were suitable to their first Demands? and had they not gone so
far, and the King so far complyed, as that they voted the King's Con∣cessions
a sufficient Ground of a Treaty?</P>
<P>Thus far I do still insist upon it, That the Parallel between the <HI>Civil</HI>
War, or <HI>Parliament</HI> War, or <HI>Rebellion,</HI> call it which you will; and the
Inviting over, Joyning with, and Taking up Arms under the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> against King <HI>James,</HI> seems to me to be very exact, the drawing
such a Parallel very just, and the Foundation proceeding, and Issue just
the same.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do here with the Consequences of the Action, the
Parliament-Men and others concern'd in that War, could no more have
it in their Design to destroy the Person of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. or the <HI>English</HI>
Gentry that invited over the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> have it in their Design to
<PB N="ix" REF="13"/>
form the Revolution that follow, then either of them could foresee the
subsequent Issues of their Undertaking, before it was begun.</P>
<P>Neither of them can deny, the Destruction of their King, might for
ought they knew be the Consequences of the War, or by an alternate
Fortune, their own destruction might be the same: But the necessity
of putting both to the hazard was certainly equal, and the Lawfulness
equal by the same Consequence; and I cannot go from it, that both the
said Wars were raised upon the same Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> the Crown, in∣vading
the Laws and Liberties of the Subject. How any People can then
<HI>Defend the inviting over the Prince of Orange,</HI> to check the Invasions of
King <HI>James</HI> II. and at the same time condemn the taking Arms against
the Invasions of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. remains to be resolv'd.</P>
<P>If they will prove that the Invasions of Right, Property, and English
Laws were not equal, or proportionably so; nor the Actions of both
equally illegal, they must deny what the Parties themselves have ac∣knowledg'd
by their attempting to undo them again when too late.</P>
<P>If they will prove that one Prince had <HI>more Right to impose</HI> upon his
Subjects than the other, and that the Subjects <HI>then</HI> ought to bear what
the Subjects <HI>now</HI> ought to resent, the Case will alter, and I shall pati∣ently
expect some such Arguments to justify this: But if I am disap∣pointed
in that, I shall cease to wonder, when I reflect that Impossibi∣lities
are not to be expected.</P>
<P>But all these things are answered by one sort of Men, and they are
such as argue, That neither of these Actions are justifiable at all; That
the King receiving his Authority from no human Sanction, but from God
alone, is accountable to none <HI>but Him;</HI> That <HI>his Right</HI> is Inherent, <HI>his
Person</HI> Sacred, and the Obedience of his Subjects <HI>a Debt of Religion,</HI> in
Obedience to the Commands of God; and consequently must be with∣out
Reserve.</P>
<P>To such I am not speaking in the Preface, <HI>but in the Book;</HI> and shall
refer them to it; the <HI>Satyr</HI> is theirs: This Part is directed to another
sort of Folk, and therefore is wrote in another Dialect; I only ask
these, what is all this to the Parallel I draw between the Parliament War,
and <HI>the taking up Arms</HI> against King <HI>James,</HI> both which were begun
upon the same Foundation, and against the same Person, on the same
Pretence?</P>
<P>Both are express'd and describ'd by the same Phrase or Form of Words;
both are the <HI>English</HI> Nation or Parliament taking Arms, upon the account
of their Liberties invaded, and Laws dispensed with, by the Arbitrary
Will of their Princes.</P>
<P>Both are the Subjects taking Arms against their Sovereign, which if
it be not lawful on any account, confirms the Parallel, and both shall
join in meriting the Title of a Rebellion; if it may be lawful on any Ac∣count,
then it will only remain to examine, whether of the two can put
in the fairest Claim to the Right of taking Arms for their Liberty?</P>
<P>And not to enter here into the Melancholy Exmination of the Particu∣lars,
I leave it to any Body to examine, whether the Invasion of Liberty,
without Consent in Parliament, dispensing with Laws, discontinuing
Parliaments, and oppressing the Subject in the Reign of King <HI>Charles,</HI>
were not equal to the same, or such like Articles, under the Administra∣tion
<PB N="x" REF="14"/>
of King <HI>James</HI> II. and let but the Advocates of this Matter deal im∣partially;
and whenever they bring a Historical Parallel between the
Reigns, I fear not an effectual Confirmation of my Proposition?</P>
<P>I cannot but remind my Readear to do me Justice, for many are
they that catch at the Sound of things, and misplace wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; but
let them <HI>take me right,</HI> and fix the same Periods of the several Actions
as I do; the first to the King being sorcibly taken out of the hands
of the Parliament, by a <HI>Juncto</HI> of the Army, when <HI>His Majesty's Con∣cessions</HI>
on one hand, and <HI>his Subjects Concessions</HI> on the other, had
brought a happy Peace in view, which View was one Reason that ex∣asperated
the Army, and to prevent which they thus flew in the
Faces of their Masters, and turn'd that Force upon them, which
they ought to have employ'd in their Defence, and by their Or∣der:
The other Period they must fix at the time of the Retreat of King
<HI>James,</HI> and the Convention of Estates being Assembled to settle the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Government, and to restore the Liberties of the People, which the
Arbitrary Proceedings of that King had ruin'd and subverted.</P>
<P>Hitherto both Parties acted upon the same Foundation, from the same
and equally to be justified Principles, and kept to their declar'd Designs.</P>
<P>What happen'd in both cases subsequent to these Periods, may be rec∣koned
among the unforeseen, and remote Consequences, which no Man
could have been charg'd with projecting in the first Design, and are not
at all concern'd in the Dispute.</P>
<P>I no more believe that the first Raisers of the Civil War, <HI>suppose the
Parliament Agressors,</HI> ever design'd to have brought the King to a for∣mal
Trial, and to the Block as a Criminal, or foresaw any such Event
in that War; than the first Signers of the Invitation to the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> could foresee or design King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication, and the future
Settlement of the Crown: Nor can any Man form a rational Conjecture
from whence, to make it probable, that either of these could be foreseen
on either hand.</P>
<P>As the Chances of War and the various Successes of Actions of this
Nature are unaccountable, and Men that act on such Occasions are answe∣rable
for the Consequences of such Actions, whether foreseen or no: <HI>So
indeed,</HI> either side are accountable for the things that follow'd; and how
justifiable both are, I refer to History and this Book; but the Business I
am here upon, is, whether the Cases are alike, or no, and I profess not to
be able to see the Difference.</P>
<P>The War in both Articles began with the same Pretences, on the
same Principles, in the same Manner, the Complainers alledge the same
thing, the Kings acted almost the same things, and the Issue brought forth
the same event, <HI>viz.</HI> Deposing the King.</P>
<P>What Difference there was in the subsequent Proceedings, I say again
is nothing to the purpose I am upon: nor can I concern my self to en∣quire,
whether Suffering of Death or Exile were most grievous, or most
Criminal; those things admit of Dispute, and are <HI>too sad to make merry
with;</HI> but thus far I think the Parallel is very plain, and cannot be de∣ny'd,
that the Reason of the War is the same, and one cannot be justified
without the other.</P>
<P>And yet, should I enter inro the Enquiry, which of the two Kings had
<PB N="xi" REF="15"/>
the worst Treatment; I confess my self at some Loss to determine; and
therefore to those Gentlemen that are angry at an Expression of mine
in another place, concerning the Difference between <HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>Wet</HI> Matyr∣dome;
I'take the Liberty to say.</P>
<P>That either respecting the Suffering it self;</P>
<P>Or, The manner preceding it—If I might be at liberty to say
what I think; 'tis really my Opinion, That King <HI>James</HI> went thro' the
most, and with more cutting Aggravations; and let the Censurers of this
do me Justice, I fear incurring no blame from Men of impartial, discern∣ing,
unbyass'd Judgments.</P>
<P>It is not material to enquire into the Causes here, or what brought ei∣ther
of these Unfortunate Princes into Distress; but I am speaking as to
the Weight of their Sufferings, respecting themselves, and the Guilt of the
Persons, respecting the Instruments.</P>
<P>1. As to the Weight of the Sufferings, I am clear in it; tho' in this I
pretend but to speak my own Opinion, that all the formidable Terrors of
the Axe and the Scaffold, with their preceding Violences, I mean from
the time the King fell into the hands of the Army to his Death, could
not amount to a Ballance of the Exile, the Insults, the unsufferable
Treachery of Friends, and this added to the length of Time, which the
late King had to struggle with in his Deposing.</P>
<P>Death is an immediate Gate of Deliverance to such Pressures as are be∣yond
the Power of Flesh and Blood to support; and tho' the Weight
of all sorts must be very heavy, under which King <HI>Charles</HI> the first fell,
yet it had some Alleviations which this had not.</P>
<P>1. He had the Satisfaction to see, that his numerous Friends had stuck
to him faithfully; that tho' he was over-powered by his Enemies, yet
he had thousands of his Faithful Subjects had spent their Blood in his
Service, and the Remnant continued true to him to the last, only want∣ed
Ability.</P>
<P>2. He saw the very People whose Power had reduc'd him, look'd on
the Violences he then suffered with the utmost Regret; That it was a
new undiscovered Mine, set on fire from below, under which the whole
Constitution at that time seem'd to lie buryed as well as he; and that
the very Men who took up Arms against him for their Liberty, yet ab∣horr'd
the extending their Victory to his Destruction.</P>
<P>3. Had he thought fit, <HI>as few Princes but he would have stuck at it,</HI>
to have abandon'd the Bishops, he might long before that have been
Re-establish'd.</P>
<P>Other Circumstances I omit, which I might bring to prove the Allevi∣tions
of Sorrow on his Side much greater than on King <HI>James</HI>'s: But to
come to the other Side.</P>
<P>The late King saw himself betray'd by his nearest Friends, abandon'd
of those very Men that had led him by the hand into the Snare; a Uni∣versal
Defection, the Exceptions in which were very few; no Body to
stand by him; those very Men that had sworn to a Passive Absolute Sub∣mission,
and taught it to others, <HI>in Arms against him.</HI></P>
<P>He saw himself so entirely deserted, that he found himself incapable
of having, <HI>as we say,</HI> one day for it, or an Opportunity of striking one Blow
for his Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="16"/>
He saw himself toss'd off from his Throne by those very People, who
in the Reign before, were most zealous to place him there; he saw
those that flattered him with the Sanction of his Person, and his deriving
his Authority from God alone, arm'd with Guns and Swords, violating
that very Person they pretended to hallow; those that told him he was
accountable to none, calling him to an Account for even the very things
he had acted by their Advice, and which they had been the Engins to
draw him into.</P>
<P>Add to this, that he saw himself driven out of his Kingdom, by a Force
he had the least Reason to apprehend; his own Children set upon his
Throne by that National Authority, which he had too much con∣temn'd,
and all possible Indignities put upon his Person by the Common
People.</P>
<P>Escaping the Tumult and Insults of the Rabble, he fled into <HI>France;</HI>
there he liv'd to see his Powerful Ally not able to restore him, the Royal
Navy of <HI>France</HI> destroy'd in his Defence, and at last the most bloody War
that ever <HI>Europe</HI> saw, began on his Account, but ended without any Relief
and his Patron of <HI>France</HI> forc'd to make Peace without him.</P>
<P>He saw his Rival King <HI>William</HI> establish'd at home, acknowledged from
abroad, and go home triumphing over his Desperate Fortunes; and all
these Severities making Deep Wounds in his Soul by the continuance of
11 years, without prospect of Recovery.</P>
<P>Let any Man ask me, if the Axe and the Scaffold had half the intole∣rable
Weight of this Burthen—I cannot but think I have sufficiently
demonstrated that the last, as the passive Part of Valour, as the Greatest,
suffered most; as to the active Part, and the Persons afflicting, to me it is
still the same, and the Guilt of the last rather exceeds that of the first.</P>
<P>And here let me enter a due Caution; I do not by heightning the
Guilt of the last, Attempt to lessen the Guilt of the first, nor am I con∣cern'd
in it.</P>
<P>The first was all Tumult, Army, and Rabble; their Violence was equal
on the Nation, as on the Person of the King; they Dethron'd not the
King only, but the Constitution; they beheaded the very Govenment;
Government as well as the Governour;—It was an unaccountable
Torrent, like a Flood from the Sea driven upon the Land by some strong
Tempest, which when it has forc'd its way over all Bounds, and broke
down all the legal Banks and Opposition, Drowns the Country, and
many innocent People are destroy'd by the violence of it; but when
it has spent its Force, returns with the like Fury and Impetuosity,
and at last ends in its Native Ocean; and so did this.</P>
<P>That these violences were illegal, rebellious, bloody, and barbarous,
and that the King and many others of the best Families in <HI>England,</HI>
and some of those that were of the first that took Arms against him, fell
under it, was what indeed was to be expected from such a Storm; and
of these it shall be said, That as a Man fell before wicked Men, so fell
<HI>Abner.</HI></P>
<P>But take even this Army, this Rabble of Soldiery; nay, add to them
all the Designing Party, and those, if any such there were, who had
the Destruction both of King and Constitution in their View from the
beginning, all does not amount to the Treachery, the Baseness and abo∣minable
<PB N="xiii" REF="17"/>
Hypocrisy of these Men, who did all this Violence to King
<HI>James,</HI> after they, <HI>the very same individual Persons,</HI> had prompted him to
all the unhappy Steps he took, justified the very Arbitrary Proceedings
and illegal Practices they afterwards expos'd him for; nay, and some
of them the very Instruments which assisted him in acting them.</P>
<P>This unsufferable Treachery in the People he trusted, aggravated their
Crime and his suffering, beyond all that I think can be said of K. <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>To say they did not murther him, is to say nothing, his Share, <HI>as to
them I mean,</HI> I think exceeded that of his Fathers, and if their Crimes will
admit of Comparisons, certainly the last exceeded all that ever went
before them.</P>
<P>They did not try him and cut off his Head; That had been <HI>Ʋne coup
de Grace,</HI> they were 11 Years a Murthering of him, and he languish'd
all that while under their Treachery: And this is what I mean by the
<HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>Wet</HI> Martyrdom; and if the Gentlemen that Object against the
Comparison please to enter into the Particulars, they will find the Dry,
Starving, Betraying Martyrdom of King <HI>James,</HI> exceed the other.</P>
<P>Not that I think the Revolution founded upon any thing of this
Treachery, however assistant it was to bring the Revolution to pass,
nor do I argue that the Deposing King <HI>James</HI> was an unjust Action, be∣cause
it came as the Consequence of the People of <HI>England</HI> taklng Arms
to defend their Liberties and Laws which were manifestly invaded▪</P>
<P>But that respects those People who suffered by, and complain'd of those
Invasions and Oppressions.</P>
<P>For King <HI>James</HI> was not Deposed by those, otherwise than eventually;
these were the Causes of all this; these Men led him into this Snare,
swore their Allegiance to him upon absolute resigning Terms; sign'd a
License to him to be a Tyrant, <HI>as far as concern'd their part:</HI> They own'd
him as a Monarch <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> of Right inherent, Power absolute, and
Person Sacred, and when they had thus led him to the Gulph, they push'd
him in, and not only abandon'd him, but pursued him with the same
Violence they had condemn'd other for before; one and all, they drew
the Sword against the Lord's Anointed, call'd him to an Account whom
they had sworn to as Unaccountable, and ruin'd him for those very
Actions they had thrust him upon before.</P>
<P>After they had made his Case desperate, and push'd him upon things
so unjustifiable and unaccountable, that forc'd even his best Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and his own Houshold and Children to fly from him; how did these Men
defend him? how did they stand by him with their Lives and Fortunes,
things they had so often Bantered him with; How did they that address'd
him with Thanks for his Standing Army to Day, to Morrow address
the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with perhaps like Hypocritical Thanks for rescuing
them from the Slavery and Tyranny of the same Standing Army? How
did they, that in their frequent Addresses <HI>to stand by him</HI> with their Lives
and Fortunes, indeed stand by and look on at his Destruction, reserving
those Lives and Fortunes to cheat his Successor with?</P>
<P>Thus they put him to <HI>Dry</HI> Martyrdom, drove him from his Throne,
sent him to seek Safety, and even Subsistence from Foreign Courts▪
to live an exil'd Stranger in other Countries—And perish under all the
Miseries of a Banishment, that, to a great Mind, is worse than Death.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="18"/>
To say he was entertain'd and receiv'd well abroad, is nothing to them,
to the utmost of their Power, they starv'd him; and thus they murther'd
him, as I call it; and what he endur'd by their Treachery, both as to
the Person suffering, and Persons procuring, was in this much greater
than that of his Father.</P>
<P>As to the rest of the Nation, such as never consented to arbitrary In∣vasions
of Liberty, arbitrary Dispensings with the Laws, and Arbitrary
Governing by an Army, they had really no other hand in the late King's Di∣sasters,
than what he ought to have expected; they never profest Sub∣mission
beyond the Bounds of the Law; never told the King he might
do what he pleas'd with them, and that their Wives, Lives, Children
and Estates were his Cattle, and his Goods to dispose at his Pleasure;
they never told him that his Authority, was equal with that of God
himself; and to resist him, tho' he should turn Tyrant, was a Damning
Sin.</P>
<P>They alway knew a Legal Obedience, and no other; they understood
themselves bound to resist Violence of all sorts, and to be at Liberty to
oppose all that should attempt the Life of the Constitution, as the uni∣versal
Enemies of their Country; this they had practsed in all Ages, and
so had other Nations likewise, and King <HI>James</HI> could expect no other
from them.</P>
<P>The Sum of all is this; all Nations determine, That Kings who invade
their Peoples Liberties, break in upon Constitutions, and the Sacred <HI>Po∣stulata</HI>
of Government; that oppress their Subjects, and impose unjust
and intolerable things upon them, MAY BE RESISTED; be it by cal∣ling
in and joyning with Foreign Aid, or be it by taking Arms in the
Defence of the Law and Common Liberty; this is what is declar'd in
the Revolution, and this is the Foundation upon which the Parliament
took Arms in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>And upon this very score, tho' in the Common Stile they were call'd
Rebels, yet at the Treaty of <HI>Ʋxbridge,</HI> his Majesty condescended to treat
with them as an <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and such they certainly then were,
however afterward disposess'd and crush'd by the Soldiery: And in the
Matter of War, the King even from the first, voluntarily declin'd treat∣ing
them as Rebells, but gave Quarter of War to their Men, Exchang'd
and Ransom'd their Prisoners, and in all things us'd them as fair Ene∣mies;
and the like without doubt would have been done, had King <HI>James</HI>
the Second stood out with his Subjects, and it had gone on to a War.</P>
<P>From all these things it appears, that it has never been the Opini∣on
of the People of <HI>England,</HI> that the Sacred Right of their Princes ex∣tended
to protect them against the Laws; or that if they acted contrary
to their Duty and Contract, they were forbid even to Displace and De∣throne
them.</P>
<P>From whence then, and for what ends the Modern Politicks of these
Ages have usher'd this Monster into the World, would merit some Hi∣story,
were it not directly to be answer'd in a very few words.</P>
<P>The Rise, Birth and Introduction of this Piece of Inconsistence in Rea∣soning,
I take to be properly accounted for, thus: A meer Device, and po∣litick
Invention, furnish'd from the Fountain of Mischief, <HI>viz.</HI> Man's cor∣rupt
yet fruitful Imagination, prompted by the Author of all Mischief,
<PB N="xv" REF="19"/>
the Devil; calculated for the erecting, and found out by such as purposed
to introduce Tyranny, and absolute Government in the World.</P>
<P>In these, and in their Plots against human Liberty, and Civil Society,
this Creature had its Birth; since 'tis evident nothing can serve so natural∣ly
to the Hellish Purpose of subduing the Civil Rights of a Nation,
as first to captivate their Minds, and infuse Notions of something Sa∣cred,
either in the Person or Authority of the Wretch they were to be
oppress'd by: Thus the way is made smooth for all the horrid Excursi∣ons
of the most vicious and encroaching Tyrants in the World; for who
in his Senses would resist the Voice of the King, if once he were bigotted
into an Opinion that it was in a perfect Conjuncton with, had a resem∣blance
of, and was back'd with Sacred Authority, from the Commands
of God.</P>
<P>And this doubtless was the Occasion of the Profane Attempts in the
Case of several of the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Tyrants, of causing Divine Ho∣nours
to be paid them; by this they obtain'd so much upon the subject∣ed
Minds of the Poor-<HI>imposed-upon</HI>- Multitude, that these entirely gave
up their Liberties to the Absolute Tyranny of every barbarous Inhuman
Wretch: and who could question but it would be so, when once the
Folly of Men was prevail'd upon to believe the Divinity of the Tyrant,
<Q>Who would not, <HI>if the Gods should rule,</HI> Obey.</Q></P>
<P>Thus this Delusion gain'd upon the World, as a studyed Introduction to
Universal Bondage—And nothing else could have made us stoop in these
wiser Ages, <HI>as we say they are, of the World;</HI> Nothing could so well have
reconcil'd us to the Absurdities of Arbitrary Power, as to back the Pre∣posterous
Notion with strange Suppositions of a Sacred Stamp upon the
<HI>Royal Thing</HI> imposing, as a proper handle to prepare our Subjection to what
on no other Terms, or by no other Method we could be brought to.</P>
<P>And yet as all evil Designs generally ruin themselves, by pushing too
far a certain Token of the Wrong Foundation they stand on, so it was
here; for had they been content to have fix'd the Sacred upon the Office,
and not altogether upon the Person of the Monarch, they might by
their usual Artifice have run us a great way blindfold; but as they
foresaw that would not so entirely vindicate the constant Enormities
committed by such Flagrant Wretches as God for the Execution of his
Judgments sometimes thinks fit to suffer on the Thrones of Power; so,
like Men resolv'd to answer every End, and, if possible to bring deluded
Nations into an absolute Subjection to the Devil, under the Notion of a
God, they insist upon the Divinity of the Person of a King, inherent in
himself.</P>
<P>Whether this inherent Divinity, is convey'd to him by his Office, or
his Line, they have not yet thought fit to determine, but have left it as
one of the unsurmountable Difficulties of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Tyranny
by Divine Right, which future Ages may Solve if they can; or rather,
which will rise up against the Forgery, with such unaswerable Violence, as
must some time or other effectually undeceive the World, and restore
Men to their Senses.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="20"/>
For if Kings have their Divinity by Line, then none can have it but
the Line; 'tis an Inheritance of the Royal Blood, form the first Great
Prince that Heaven deputed it to, and every Branch of that Line must
enjoy it; who that Prince was, when the Sanction was impress'd upon
him, and entail'd on his Posterity, is a Mystery yet unfolded; but where
he found how the most antient Family now reigning will do to <HI>Cap Pede∣grees,</HI>
and derive from that sanctified Blood, is a new Difficulty past any
mortal Reach, and the ready way to bring some Scandal upon all the
Families of Royal Blood in the World, as Upstarts and Usurper.</P>
<P>If puzzled with this Wilderness-Inquiry, they would on the other
hand remove the Sacred from the Line to the Office, that is, the Posses∣sion;
they open the Door to all manner of Violence and Usurpation,
since then he that has the Crown, becomes equally Divine with him that
ought to have it, and the Usurper is as Sacred as the most righful Mo∣narch
in the World.</P>
<P>Other Absurdities also would follow here, <HI>viz.</HI> a Person might be Sa∣cred
to day, and not to morrow; if Sacred at all, it could not be lawful
to Dethrone him; and yet if Dethron'd, the Person who did it, by
whatsoever Violence, Injustice, Cruelty or Blood, by his stepping into
the Seat, became <HI>ipso facto</HI> as Divine, as Sacred, and as much to be obey'd
upon pain of Damnation, as he; and so <HI>vice versa</HI> from Tyrant to Tyrant,
as often as Providence thought fit to let Power overcome Right in the
World.</P>
<P>I shall no more Trouble my Reader with searching this Maze of Folly,
its ridiculous and inconsistent Nature merits rather to be expos'd than De∣bated;
and therefore was this <HI>Satyr</HI> wrote; in which, if this Football of
<HI>Jure Divino</HI> is not sufficiently kick'd about, you must blame the Ability,
not the Good Will of the Author.</P>
<P>I know it has been expected I should in this Book have examin'd into
all the Parts of Tyranny, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, and perhaps
there had been room enough for <HI>Satyr</HI> upon our Church-Tyranny; espe∣as
it has been lately practis'd, and since endeavour'd to be Re-establish'd
in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But I have wav'd this unpleasant task for many Reasons, and some
of them are as follow.</P>
<P>1. Because it seems to be at and in <HI>England,</HI> I look on it as a Lyon
slain, buried in the Grave of the Popish Invasions, and Arbitrary En∣croachments
of the Late Reigns of King <HI>C—s</HI> and King <HI>J</HI>—<HI>s</HI> II. a
Criminal convicted by the Revolution, and executed by the Legal To∣leration,
which is part of the Establishment of these Nations; and a thing
on which too much now depends, to give us any just Concern for its
Danger: Persecution, and Priestly Tyranny, has receiv'd its Mortal
Wound; in vain have been all the Attempts to revive it—And
I doubt not so they will continue.</P>
<P>2. As the Sovereignty of Conscience has gain'd the Victory over Par∣ty
Invasion, and the Church her self has disown'd the Doctrine of Perse∣cution,
as <HI>a thing contrary to her Doctrine,</HI> and contrary to <HI>the Principles
of the Christian Religion,</HI> it cannot be that a Resurrection of that Spirit
can happen in this Nation, till <HI>England</HI> shall so far forget her self, as to
<PB N="xvii" REF="21"/>
contradict <HI>her own Doctrine,</HI> and act <HI>contrary to the Principles</HI> of the
Christian Religion.</P>
<P>And should that unhappy time ever come to pass in <HI>England,</HI> when
the Church, by the Errors and Impositions of any Party, shall be brought
to such Excentrick Measures, they may depend upon it, that when she
comes to her self again, she will return to the same Moderation, which
she owns by her Principle to be just.</P>
<P>Persecution therefore which is a meer Church-Tyranny, is an Enemy
Conquer'd, absolutely subdued, and I think Probabilities justify me speak∣ing
with Assurance, will never have a Resurrection again in this Na∣tion.</P>
<P>There can but one thing restore the Dominion of this evil Spirit in
this Nation, and that must be the Return of Popery upon us; and if this
sort of Persecution comes among us, it will make no difference between
Church of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Dissenter,</HI> but Persecution respecting Protestan∣tism
in General will be our Fate; and how odious will Protestant-Per∣secution
look then! All equally differ and dissent from Popery; I hope
they will not push me upon entring on the ungrateful Comparison of who
differs most, or whose Principle is remotest from the Chruch of <HI>Rome;</HI>
if Popery prevails, the whole Protestant Church will be one Body of
<HI>Dissenters</HI> under the Burthen of Ecclesiastical Persecution, and under a
Church-Tyranny, which the Christian Religion abhors; and some that
are very forward to persecute for the private Opinions of Men, would
do well to consider.</P>
<P>1. How naturally their tearing one another to Pieces by unreasonable
and unchristian Feuds, tends to pulling down the Protestant Interest in
General in these Nations; laying open the Fences and Fortifications
of the Church, which so much consist in a General Unity, and expose∣ing
her to be devour'd by Popery and Superstition.</P>
<P>2. How readily it fills the Mouths of the Enemies of the Church,
who wait for her halting with, Arguments against the very Foundation of
her Principles, that while she blames the <HI>Roman</HI> Church for Coercives,
and the Fury of Church Tyranny, she at the same time falls upon her
weak Brethren that offer to separate from her Communion, and to tear
them to pieces by like unjustifiable Tyranny.</P>
<P>The most necessary Application I can make from hence, is, That Per∣secution
is <HI>a Seed of the Devil,</HI> born of <HI>Civil Tyranny,</HI> and degenerated
into a meaner Species of Kind than its Orignal; for I readily confirm this
Maxim,
<Q><L>That of all Plagues with which Mankind is Curst,</L>
<L>Ecclesiastick Tyranny's the worst.</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis plain, <HI>Persecution</HI> is a thing really odious and hateful to all Na∣tions,
and therefore most Religions in the World most industriously
avoid the Challenge, and either strive to throw it off from one another,
or excuse themselves by Charging it upon their Neighbours; also think∣ing
to extenuate the Crime, by having it allow'd to be universal.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> began with this, and <HI>Saunders</HI> the Jesuit re∣proaches
the Church of <HI>England</HI> with persecuting their Fellow-Hereticks,
<PB N="xviii" REF="22"/>
even as soon as they were but just got out of the Reach of Fire and Fag∣got
themselves.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> on the other hand, reproaches the Dissenters
with the same Spirit, boasting the Pretences to the <HI>Jure Divino</HI> of <HI>Pres∣bytery,</HI>
instancing farther in the late Proclamation for banishing Prelatick
Ministers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Persecution of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI>
and the like.</P>
<P>The Truth is, no Church, <HI>but that of Rome,</HI> professes Persecution; and
that I may not charge the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> with the Article of Perse∣cution
without Ground, I refer the Reader to the Oath of a Bishop to
the Pope, set down at large in my Lord Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s History of
the Reformation; “Hereticks, Schismaticks, and Rebells, to our Holy
Father and his Successors, I shall RESIST AND PERSECUTE to
my Power.” <HI>Hist. Reform. Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>f.</HI> 123. So that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>
were bound by Oath to persecute those that were deem'd Scismaticks
and Hereticks.</P>
<P>But in the Church of <HI>England</HI> its quite differnt, and as the Nature
of her Constitution is inconsistent with the persecuting Principle, the Re∣formation
having begun in an Abhorrence of Persecution; so to me it is
a Declaration never to be forgotten, which we found in the Preamble
to the first Occasional Bill and tho' some have taken Care to obli∣terate
it, by leaving it out in the second Bill, I cannot but on all Occasi∣ons
repeat it, in order to perpetuate it to Posterity, as a thing which de∣serves
to be recorded to the Honour of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> viz.
<HI>Whereas Persecution for Conscience Sake is contrary to the Principles of the
Christian Religion, and to the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be
it Enacted—</P>
<P>Under all these Circumstances I cannot but take the Freedom to say, the
Protestant Religion in <HI>England</HI> seems to Triumph over Persecution, with∣out
any Fear or Danger of its recovering its self in time to come; To∣leration
is now a Publick Right by Law, as it was before a Right of Con∣science;
and would the Patrons of Tyranny suffer themselves to judge im∣partially,
and put the Civil Peace of the Nation in the Balance with their
private Sense of things, they cannot but judge that Toleration of Reli∣gious
Dissenters is most suited to the General Good both of Religion,
Civil Government, and the Common Interests of Nations.</P>
<P>I would not here enter the Dissenter's Claim of Right to the Tole∣ration
they now enjoy, were it not that we are so often told that To∣leration
to Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> is the meer Grace and Bounty of the Church.</P>
<P>That if it were so, we had a great deal to thank them for, I readily
own, and no Man should be more forward to own, and upon all Occa∣sions
acknowledge the Debt—But however I would not lessen the Cha∣rity
and Tenderness of the Church, abstracted from the Impositions of
<HI>Court-Interest,</HI> Party-Contrivance, and all the Powerful <HI>Et Cetera</HI>'s that
prevail'd with her to be made <HI>a Tool of Popery,</HI> to weaken her self and her
Brethren; I must yet be allow'd to say the Dissenters enjoy their
Toleration as a Capitulation or Treaty of Union, when they join'd
with the Church of <HI>England</HI> upon sure Foundations, never to be shaken,
<PB N="xix" REF="23"/>
but by something that must overturn Nation, Constitution, and Pro∣testant
Religion together.</P>
<P>The Stipulations of this Treaty were Toleration of Dissenters, signified
in the Memorial to the Prince, delivered at the <HI>Hague,</HI> Recapitulated in
his Declaration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>The 8th Article of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of</HI> Orange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Declaration.</HI></NOTE> upon his coming over, <HI>of which he was Guarantee,</HI> and
in Dependance upon which the Dissenters rejected a precarious illegal
Liberty offered them by King <HI>James,</HI> founded upon his Dispensing Power,
and join'd heartily with the Church of <HI>England.</HI> The Stipulations of
this Treaty, I say, were Liberty to Tender Consciences to be settled by
Act of Parliament, which is in English, an Act of Toleation.</P>
<P>I forbear to enlarge upon this Head, because I have at large insisted
upon it; and I think effectually clear'd it up in another place; and I ne∣ver
yet met with any Person that thought fit to debate the Particulars.</P>
<P>But when I am speaking of this Article of Toleration of Religion,
Liberty of Conscience, and the like, it naturally occurs to examine the
Pretences of those Gentlemen who press the Dissenters, and I must say
very imprudently as to the Matter of Universal Toleration; and that I
may not be charg'd with taking them at an Advantage, I shall not tye
them up to the literal Sense of their words; but take them in their own
declar'd Meaning.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> in a certain, <HI>to him unhappy, Libel</HI> upon the Government,
entitled, <HI>A Letter to the Author of the Memorial of the State of</HI> England,
has an Expression to this Purpose; <HI>Whether it might not be for the Interest
of the Dissenters to declare themselves for an Ʋniversal Toleration of all Opi∣nions
meerly Religious?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> since that designing something for the Press upon this Head,
sends three Letters, one to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> one to the <HI>Independents,</HI> and
one to the <HI>Baptist</HI> Congregations, to move them to declare themselves on
this Article of Universal Toleration, and desires them to give him their
Answer in Writing, which I have been told he design'd to Publish.</P>
<P>I will not determine here for any Body but my self, and therefore these
Gentlemen must not pretend to take my Answer here for the General
Opinion of the Dissenters; but as I venture my private Opinion in this
Case, all Men are at Liberty to pass their Judgments upon it as they see
convenient.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> proposes this to the Dissenters as a thing which he thinks
a Debt from them with respect to the Papists, who Charge the Prote∣stants
in General with Persecuting Princples, and as he seems also to
insinuate, that nothing but this can entitle them to a right of Toleration
themselves; and this is plain from his own Words.</P>
<P>All Men have a Right to the Liberty of their Consciences, exept those who
have denied that Liberty to others.</P>
<P>What he afterwards Designs, by proving the Church of <HI>England</HI> has
denied Liberty, and has persecuted others for Conscience, I know not,
nor can I infer any thing from it; but that therefore he thinks the Church
of <HI>England</HI> merits not the Toleration she did refuse to give; if this be
the meaning, the Papists are more beholden to that Gentlemen than the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> whose Cloth he wears.</P>
<P>But why must the Dissenters declare themselves <HI>for</HI> universal Tolera∣tion?
or why <HI>for</HI> or <HI>against?</HI> Why declare themselves at all?</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="24"/>
Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> in his Letter urges a kind of Necessity of it, to remove the
Scandals endeavour'd to be thrown upon the Dissenters, as a People of a
persecuting Temper; and that while they make loud Complaints against
Persecution, talk much of the Sovereignty of Conscience, and the Right
of Mankind to a Liberty of worshipping God thier own way, they them∣selves,
were the Power put in thier hands, would push upon Coercives,
assert the Divine Right of their own Constitution, and make equal Re∣straints
upon their Fellow Christians that differ'd from them in Opinion;
and to clear them of this Scandal, that Gentleman thinks it stands them
in stead to undeceive the World in the point of their Charity, and the
Wideness of their Principles, and to justify themselves to the World.</P>
<P>I will not suspect, much less dispute the Expressions of Tenderness
and sincere Regard to the Interest and Reputation of Religion in Gene∣ral,
and of the Dissenters in particular, which Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> professes to
be the true Motives of his desiring them to make such a publick Decla∣ration,
but leave it here till I speak to it in General.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Desire to have the Dissenters declare themselves for this
Universal Toleration, seems to be a Challenge to them, to make out
their Title to Toleration themselves, since by his Rule no Men have any
Claim to Toleration for their own Opinion that would not grant Tolera∣tion
to others.</P>
<P>But supposing, <HI>tho' I do not grant it,</HI> that the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI>
are not for Tolerating all Opinions; I would ask, Does it follow from
thence, that they must not be Tolerated?</P>
<P>All Opinions that are meerly Religious, are not equally Orthodox▪
Now if my Opinion be really in it self, Doctrinally sound, tho' not in all
things relating to Circumstances, conforming to the Establish'd Mode, will
nothing entitle me to a Toleration of my sound and orthodox Opinion,
but being willing to Tolerate another Opinion that is Hetrodox, Blas∣phemous
or Heretical?</P>
<P>If we must not distinguish of Opinions, which are, or are not consi∣stent
with the Christian Religion, then we must not distinguish of
those things which the Scripture has plainly distinguish'd; as in the Case
of the Church of <HI>Pergamos,</HI> where she is blamed for having THERE,
that is, <HI>Tolerated</HI> in her, or with her, those who hold—The Doctrine
of <HI>Balaam,</HI> who tought <HI>Balak</HI> to cast a Stumbling-block before the Chil∣dren
of <HI>Israel, Rev.</HI> 12. 14. and again, <HI>v.</HI> 16. SO HAST THOU ALSO;
them that hold the Doctrine of the <HI>Nicolaitans;</HI> which thing I hate—
<HI>Repent therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, the Church of <HI>Thyatira</HI> is blam'd for Toleration, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Because
thou sufferest that Woman</HI> Jezabel, <HI>who calleth her self a Prophetess, to teach
and seduce my Servants,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I will not undertake a Comment upon this Text, or enter into the
Debate, what Errors are meant by the Doctrines these taught, but to me
it seems plain that the Spirit of God does direct us not to Tolerate such
in his Church as Teach the Doctrines which his Soul hates, which are
destructive of his Honour, and of the Nature of Religion, Heretical
and Abominable.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="25"/>
The Churches are here blam'd for having such among them; and in
another place for suffering them—What should prevent my conclu∣ding
that such are not to be Tolerated in the Church, I confess I cannot
foresee, and therefore I leave it to be censur'd as the Reader pleases.</P>
<P>But when we come to Toleration of Orthodox Churches, let us ex∣amine
the same Text, and there we find some of the Churches left their
first Love, as that at <HI>Ephesus;</HI> others had a Name of Living, but were Dead,
as the Church of <HI>Sardis;</HI> others neither <HI>cold nor hot</HI> in Religion, as the
Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> and the like, and yet all are own'd by the Scripture,
as Churches, and being Sound in Doctrine, are only admonished to repent,
but no where denied a Name among the Churches.</P>
<P>From this I pretend to offer this Positive Assertion, That Christans
of what Denomination soever, being Orthodox in Principle, and Sound
in Doctrine, have a Native Right to Liberty of serving God, ac∣cording
to the Dictates of their own Consciences, and ought to be To∣lerated,
provided they behave themselves peaceably under the Govern∣ment,
and obedient in all other things to the Civil Magistracy of the
Country in which they live.</P>
<P>That I should say the same of Opinions that are Blasphemous and He∣retical,
that deny the Fundamentals of the Christian Religion, derogate
from the Nature or Attributes of God, or the Honour and Divinity of
our Redeemer, or any the like desperate Errors, I see no Foundation for
it in the Scripture, or in the Nature of the thing.</P>
<P>If it shall be enquir'd here, who shall determine what is or is not Or∣thodox,
and alledged every Man being possess'd with the Soundness of
his own Opinion, this will send us all to <HI>Rome</HI> for an infallible Judge in
every Dispute.</P>
<P>I must answer there is no occasion for any such Difficulties, the few
things which serve to declare the difference between an Orthodox Christain
and a Heretick, are so plain, so visible in Scripture, so explicit in our Creeds
and Consessions of Faith, in which all Orthodox Christians agree; that
we need go no farther; the Scripture is allow'd by all Christians to be
the Rule of Faith, sufficient to Instruction; the Christian Confessions of
Faith are a Collection of the fundamental Heads of our Religion, de∣duc'd
from the said Scriptures, composed of plain, indisputable Truths,
unto which whoever agrees, tho' in the <HI>Addenda</HI> and Circumstances of
Order, Discipline and Manner, he may differ, he is in the Sense of all
Christians, an Orthodox Believer.</P>
<P>But if a Man denies the Nature, Being, or Attributes of God, the
Resurrect on of the Body, Futurity of Rewards and Punishments;
the Divinity, Conception, Birth, Death, Resurrection, Ascension and
Intercession of our Redeemer; his delegated Power of Judgment and
Retribution: the Power, Operation and Efficacy of the Holy Spirit, and
the Mystical Union of the Trinity; if any Man denies the Necessity of
Faith and Repentance, and the Salvation of a Soul, only by the Pur∣chase
and Merits of a Redeemer, and the like essential Points of the
Christian Religion; such a Man is a Disciple of that <HI>Jezabel,</HI> who call,
her self a Prophetess, and who ought not to be suffered, that is, Tolera∣ted,
in the Church of Christ to teach and seduce his People to commit
Fornication, <HI>&amp;c. Rev.</HI> 2. 20.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="26"/>
I think we have no need of a Pope here, the infallible Judge is before
you, <HI>to the Word and to the Testimony;</HI> the Proof is plain, and the di∣stinction
I hope is according to Charity.</P>
<P>To Persecute any Man or Body of Men, that own and profess such Fun∣damental
Doctrines as these, is an evident Invasion of the Native Rights
of Conscience, which in such Matters can be subject to no temporal Ju∣risdiction,
no nor any human Power, Ecclesiastical or Civil; and there∣fore
is meer Church-Tyranny, exploded and abhor'd by all Nations of
Christians, and of which I have already noted, that it has been declar'd
by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to be contrary to the Principles of the Chri∣stian
Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But yet to say, that therefore all manner of Excursions, Blasphemous
Opinions, and Heretical Doctrines, must be allow'd as a General Homage
paid to the Claim of Conscience; I see no Connection in the thing, nor
any thing on either hand that makes such a Toleration a Consequence
of the other.</P>
<P>But come we now to the Enquiry, What have the Dissenters to do
in this Case? and why should they be call'd upon to make any Declara∣tion
on this Head?</P>
<P>If any Man means by this to make an invidious Enquiry, which of
the several sorts of Dissenters are widest in their Toleration-Charity, who
would or would not persecute if it was in their Power, and look back
upon former Days to fetch their Proofs of what may be, from what has
been.</P>
<P>At least let such People pretend no more that this Inquiry is made to
unite, fortify, defend, and clear the Scandals rais'd against the Dissen∣ters,
since such Enquiries tend to divide, make Reflections and Compa∣risons,
the Practice of which is equally odious with the Consequences.</P>
<P>And farther, let them observe, that they will find nothing from such an
Enquiry or Retrospect, but what may be joyn'd to like or worse Actions
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and buried among those things which they
are equally willing should be forgotten.</P>
<P>The influences of the several Courts, the Effects of the Disputes about
the <HI>Jus Divinum,</HI> of several sorts of Power, whether Regal, Episcopal,
or Presbyterial, have had fatal Effects in their several Turns—But all
may have a good Issue, in making every Age amend the Errors of their
Fathers; and I cannot think it is to be argued, That if the Presbyterian
Power were restored to its full Exercise, it would proceed to Persecuti∣on
of other Orthodox Opinions, because, <HI>as they say,</HI> it was once so, any
more than it is to be argued, That the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if the Tolera∣tion-Act
were repeal'd, and the Law <HI>de Haeretico Comburendo</HI> restor'd, would
condemn the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Baptists</HI> to Fire and Faggot, because they for∣merly
did so.</P>
<P>These Suggestions therefore as contentious and malicious, I must ex∣plode;
and being equally bury'd in an Establish'd Toleration, the Re∣trospect
is needless and impertinent.</P>
<P>But to come nearer to Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> Why should the Dissenters take
upon them to declare their Opinion of who has or has not a Religious
Right to Toleration? 'Tis plain they have a Civil Right to it; 'tis the Pur∣chace
of their Blood and Treasure; 'tis one of the Articles of their Confede∣racy
<PB N="xxiii" REF="27"/>
with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and stipulated at a Time when it was
in their Power to have been a sore Obstruction to the present Safety and
flourishing Condition of the Church, if not to have pull'd her quite
down; from whence I cannot but note, That to talk now of Gifts, Cha∣rity,
and meer Concession of Grace, is a little ungrateful, and looks as if
some Gentlemen had forgot what Condition their Affairs were in, when
the Dissenters left all the ease and promised Liberty of the inviting Court,
and embark'd in the same Hazards with the Church, meerly for the sup∣porting
that Church, which some are so unkind to say they would destroy.</P>
<P>Here's the Foundation of the present Liberty; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Dis∣senters
are unconcern'd with the Dispute about the Religious Right to a
Liberty of Opinion in matters of Conscience.</P>
<P>Not that the Dissenters have less Right by the Nature of the thing to
a Toleration of Religion, but their Native Liberty is fortified by the ad∣dition
of this Civil Right; they claim it by both, and in both their Te∣nure
is Good; 'tis a free Possession without Homage or Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>What is it to them, who ought to be Toletated, <HI>or who not;</HI> 'tis plain
that both ways THEY OUGHT to be Tolerated, since not their Enemies
themselves can charge them with any Opinions that are not Orthodox,
that are Heretical, Blasphemous, or inconsistent with the Christian Re∣ligion,
and that confirms their Religious Right; and 'tis a Claim by
Treaty, and stipulated on conditions compleatly perform'd on <HI>their Side,</HI>
and honestly executed by the lawful Authority and Government of the
Nation <HI>on the other Side;</HI> and that confirms their Civil Right.</P>
<P>As to the Dissenters declaring what they would do if they were vested
with the Power in Government, and how far they would go in Tolerat∣ing
all Opinions meerly Religious—I cannot conceive the best Answer
in the World can be so effectual, inoffensive and significant, as no Answer
at all, to such a many-fac'd Question.</P>
<P>And tho' I will noway Attempt here to determine the Design of the
Question, which I rather chose to suppose as sincere and as free from
Design, as the Enquirer says it is; yet the apparent ill Construction
which both the Question, and the best Answer that could be given might
be liable to, makes the giving no Answer to it very proper, I need take
little pains to explain.</P>
<P>Should the Dissenters declare for Universal Toleration of all Opinions
meerly Religious, To what manifest Objections such a Declaration would
be liable, in respect to the essential Parts of some Peoples Profession, and
how many Inconveniences the Disputes of that sort might lead them to,
I will not here examine.</P>
<P>But what Sport would some People be glad of the Opportunity of
making; should any Man have been so weak to answer for what any
Party would do if the Power were in their hands! and how would some
People, <HI>who are fond of pretending from every Trifle that the Dissenters dream
of Power and Government,</HI> presently flye upon them, and say they were
determining their Conduct against they met with the Opportunity!</P>
<P>Should they declare for a General Anarchy of Opinions, what Confu∣sions
would these People argue upon, as the Consequence of their Latitu∣dinarian
Power?</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="28"/>
Should they declare against it, how would they ruffle the Dissenters
upon the Article of a Persecuting Spirit? and who can pretend a real Zeal
for the Interest of the Dissenters, and attempt to draw them into any
thing from which so much injurious Advantage against them might be
taken?</P>
<P>On the other hand what benefit can there be to any Person from this
Declaration, what can any Man propose to them to move it?</P>
<P>To say such a Declaration entitles them to the Toleration they enjoy,
as Mr. <HI>Stephens,</HI> is to say nothing, because they have a better Title to it
already, and this will not so much as add the least Strength to it.</P>
<P>To say it is to clear them from Scandal, is to say nothing, since they really
lie under no Scandal already upon that Account; and if the Church
should throw any Dirt of that Sort from Days of Infirmity on both sides,
so much of it would fly back in her own Face, as would drown the
Memory of those Pretences.</P>
<P>Both the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Dissenters have gone such a length
in the Article of Toleration and Christian Liberty, as I am free to say
has buryed all the Fears of Persecution here, let what Government will,
Popery excepted, get uppermost—And in this Ecclesiastick Liberty
lies buryed all Church-Tyranny; <HI>and there let it lye</HI> FOR EVER AND
FOR AY.</P>
<P>To have the Dissenters say what they will, or will not do, when that
shall happen, which they themselves do not desire should come to pass,
seems to have something in it too weak for the Proposer, methinks he could
not be capable, his Learning and Judgment consider'd, of imagining
the Gentlemen he wrote to could be so weak, as to make any Publick
Conclusion or Determination on that Head, which to me would have
been the first Action they had ever done, to make the World think them
unworthy of that Liberty they enjoy'd.</P>
<P>I had not spoke to this here, but as I thought it very proper as well
to lay down the true Foundation upon which the Dissenters enjoy their
Liberty, as to clear up that supposed Obligation which they are fancied
to lie under, That because <HI>they who ought to have Liberty</HI> enjoy it, there∣fore,
they should be oblig'd to espouse a general Liberty to others, whe∣ther
they have an equal Claim, or indeed any Claim to it or no.</P>
<P>I conclude this Head with only one Observation more; Suppose the
Enquirer here should not Grant the Claim of Civil Right to Liberty and
Toleration which I say the Dissenters have, but that they enjoy it as the
meer Gift and Bounty o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Church. This most certainly makes it yet
more unreasonable for them to declare themselves as to the Tolerating
others; for if what they enjoy be a Gift, then it is absolutely in the Church
or in the Government, <HI>take it where you will,</HI> to bestow it, or not to
bestow it; and who to bestow it upon, or who to withhold it from;
otherwise the Gift is restrain'd, and is no more a Gift, but an Act of
Debt or Necessity</P>
<P>It would be then very ungrateful and disrespectful to these Benefactors,
for the Dissenters, as soon as they receiv'd this meer Grace and Bounty
of the Chorch, to pretend to prescribe to the Denors, who ought or ought
not to partake of the Gift as well as they. When you have given an Alms to
<PB N="xxv" REF="29"/>
a Beggar, you would take it for a piece of uncommon Insolence, that
he should come and bring another Beggar to you, pretending you ought
to relieve him too.</P>
<P>If this be a Grace, the Dissenters Business is to go away and be thank∣ful,
and not concern themselves with who is or is not intitled to the
Bounty.</P>
<P>So that take it which way we can, with Submission to the Enquirer, it
was not a Request he could think the Dissenters, if in their Senses,
could give any Answer to, the Proposal favour'd of something not extra∣ordinary
careful either of their Interest or Reputation, to say no worse
it; if there was any other Design, be that to the Contriver.</P>
<P>But to return to the Subject, we are happen'd into the World in an
Age when all sorts of Tyranny have met with their deserv'd tho' most
unexpected Fate.</P>
<P>Ecclesiastick Tyranny lies buryed in the Grave of the High Com∣mission,
and Civil Tyranny in that of the late King <HI>James;</HI> these are both
succeeded by their Contraries, Toleration and Revolution, and we all trust
are buried too deep ever to rise more.</P>
<P>We have Attempts to destroy them both, every day set on foot a∣mong
us; the Dissenters are branded as Rebels, and constant Under∣miners
of the Church; to divide them, they are rendred odious to one ano∣ther;
the <HI>Prebyterians</HI> charg'd with Persecuting-Principles, the <HI>Indepen∣dent</HI>
with Commonwealth Tenents, the <HI>Quakers</HI> unchristianiz'd, and
char'd with having no Principles at all; Snakes in the Grass are daily
Snarling, and private Animosities prompted among those of every sort,
who are weak enough to entertain them; and 'tis plain the Design lies
at the Body, the Axe lies at the Root of the Tree; the Overthrow of the
Constitution is the Design, and the Enemies of the Dissenters, as such,
have by too many visible Tokens explain'd themselves to mean the Sub∣version
of the Universal Right of Christians, and of Subjects.</P>
<P>For this the Doctrine of <HI>Jure Divino</HI> is calculated, Civil and Eccle∣siastick
Tyranny universally pleaded for, and all sorts of Liberty run
down and oppos'd: Let those that plead for Tyrants of any sort submit
to their Power; for my part, I esteem the Liberty of Estate and Religi∣on,
equally with our Lives, every Man's Birthright by Nature; no Go∣vernment
ever received a Legal Authority to abridge or take it away:
Nor has God ever vested any single or Confederated Power in any hand
to destroy it; and 'tis in Defence of this Common Right that I have
wrote this Book.</P>
<P>I shall say very little in Defence of the Performance, but this; It has
been wrote under the heaviest Weight of intolerable Pressures; the
greatest part of it was compos'd in Prison, and as the Author has unhap∣pily
felt the most violent and constant Efforts of his Enemies to destroy
him ever since that, the little Composure he has had must be his short
excuse for any thing incorrect.</P>
<P>Let any Man, under Millions of distracting Cares, and the constant ill
Treatment of the World, consider the Power of such Circumstances
over both Invention and Expression, He will allow I had been to be
excus'd, even in worse Errors than are to be found in this Book.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="30"/>
I know some will cavil at the Title, and that it either has no literal
Signification, or <HI>is not good Latin;</HI> let such observe, I could not part
with my Title in Civility to the Objection; and if it will not pass as a
Latin Sentence, it may pass as a proper Name or Title to a Book, or
a Phrase added to the Tongue, signifying the vain Pretensions of a Divine
Right; as the World has used me very unkindly in the Subscribing-Part,
so they have in their Character of the Work. I have heard of Plays that
have been hiss'd and laugh'd off the Stage; but I never heard of a Play
hiss'd off the Stage before it came upon the Stage.</P>
<P>This poor Work has met with the hard Fate of being reported to be
ill done, and the meanest thing I ever did, and that it will not sell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
yet the Authors of that Report, to my Diversion as well as Remark
I observe it, I am very positive, never saw, read, or heard one
Line of it in their Lives; their Judgment, <HI>which must, you'll say, be very
good, and suited to their Discretion,</HI> is, I thank God, none of my Con∣cern.</P>
<P>I have indeed been forc'd into an open War with the Booksellers about
this Book, having universally refused them subscribing, some particular
Friends excepted; and in return I am assur'd they will reprint it, and
sell it for half the Money: Now to tell them that this is meer Theft,
picking of Pockets, robbing upon the High Way, and the like, is to tell
them nothing, but what they are reconcil'd to in practice; to call them
hard Names is what I am not used to; they are Booksellers: and that's
the highest <HI>Satyr</HI> I shall make upon them.</P>
<P>But however, I am content; let them turn Pyrates, and take away my
Right, I have been us'd to be rob'd and plundred in every thing I have
ushered into the World, that I might not at least want the Principal
Qualification of a Poet—But let them be sure of this, whoever at∣tempts
it will lose by it—And let them take my word, or not take it,
as they please.</P>
<P>As to the Poetical Part of it, where the Argument of it lies strong,
I have been very careless of Censure that way, and have often sacri∣fic'd
the Poet to the Reasoning Stile.</P>
<P>The Historical Part, I think I may say, cannot admit of being very Po∣etical;
but as I think it was equal to any of the rest in its necessity, I am
very well pleas'd to argue strongly rather than softly.</P>
<P>I know I am under the same Censure, tho' without his Merit to sup∣port
me, that <HI>Cowley</HI>'s <HI>Davideis</HI> has suffered before me, <HI>viz.</HI> that if it had
been explicit in it self, it had needed no Annotations; but I think the
necessary Quotations of History coming on very thick, I could not but
explain my meaning, whereby People of small Reading may exactly
understand it; the Annotations therefore are chiefly Historical, and di∣rect
and serve to guide the Reader to the Authors which justify the work;
and this I chose rather than to advance on my own Authority, what I
know will meet with Opposition enough.</P>
<P>I am perfectly arm'd against Events in the Success this Book shall
meet with in the World; my Fate, and that of my Writings have been
very singular, <HI>viz.</HI> to be most neglected of them, that at the same time
have own'd them useful; but as neither the Work nor its Author depend
upon any thing in this World; so neither am I looking either at Praise
<PB N="xxvii" REF="31"/>
or Reward, and therefore am entirely unconcern'd at the Success of
it.</P>
<P>I shall quit therefore any farther Defence of it, and leave it to its Fate,
and the Universal Censure of <HI>Criticks, Rehearsers, Jacobites, Non-Jurors,</HI>
and the Crowd of <HI>Party-Furies,</HI> that wait to worry it, as they would do
its Author, and am pleased with, instead of being mortified at what my
Experience knows has been a just Motto for me,
<Q><L>Aude aliquod brevibus Gyaris &amp; Carcere Dignum,</L>
<L>Si vis esse aliquis: <HI>PROBITAS</HI> laudatur &amp; Alget.</L>
Juven. Sat. 1. lin. 73, 74.</Q></P>
<P>I shall close this Preface with a Word to those Gentlemen, who have
ill treated me for the Delay of bringing it into the World—In which
they have been very barbarous and uncivil, as well as unjust.</P>
<P>All those few and wiser Heads that had any respect for the Author,
earnestly press'd me not to attempt it while the last Parliament was sit∣ting,
Measures having been taken, and the Party then powerful enough
to blast it in its Birth, seize it in the Press, and suppress both it and
me together, by the heavy Weight of Parliamentary Censure; and this
laid it asleep a Year.</P>
<P>The necessary Obstruction of a 4 Months Travail defer'd it last Sum∣mer,
being unwilling to let it pass the Press unrevis'd; and from <HI>October</HI>
last, it has, thro' many Interruptions of private and publick Hurries,
been Passing the Press.</P>
<P>Those People who have open'd their Mouths at this Delay, to reproach
the Author with taking Subscription-Mony without any Design to publish
it, will now see how unjust so rash and so severe a Slander has been.</P>
<P>But above all, those that have pretended to keep the Subscription-Money
they had received in their hands for a Security till they shall have
the Book, have first been very unjust to the Author; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, done
their best to prevent its being publish'd at all.</P>
<P>Subscriptions are in their Nature design'd for two ends; First, To en∣able
the Authors by the Money advanc'd, to go thro' the Expence of Print∣ing,
which every Man, that undertakes to publish a Book on his own
Risque, cannot do, nor which these Gentlemen did not know I could
do without them.</P>
<P>Secondly, To secure the Author that the Subscribers will take it when
'tis finished, many People having lately learnt not to put too great
a Sanction, no not on their own hand, when they please to alter their
Minds.</P>
<P>Both these Hardships are put upon me by these false Friends, and yet
without their Help behold 'tis finished; and They, not the Author, have
been guilty of designing a Fraud, if any has been design'd at all.</P>
<P>As for those who having subscrib'd and Honourably assisted the Au∣thor
to go thro' with it, he hopes the Work it self will in Conjunction
with this Acknowledgment be their Satisfaction; and had they not ex∣presly
forbid it, he had both printed their Names, and made the Dedica∣tion
of it to them, as Benefactors to it.</P>
<P>As to Sale, the Author entirely declines it; and tells the Gentlemen-Booksellers
that threatned to Pyrate it, as they call it, <HI>viz.</HI> reprint it,
<PB N="xxviii" REF="32"/>
and sell it for half a Crown; so you must, Gentlemen, if you intend to
have it: for of the Original Copies, if the Subscribers are honest, you will
have very few; and if all Men that write would take the same Method,
the Booksellers would soon leave off imposing upon them—</P>
<P>Some <HI>Addenda,</HI> not yet finished, relating to the present Victories and
great Prospect of reducing Tyrrany, will be deliver'd <HI>gratis</HI> to the Sub∣scribers,
either early enough to bind with this, if they please; or pre∣par'd
to be read by themselves.</P>
<P>I don't expect the Advocates of Tyranny should like it; it was not
wrote to gratify them, but convince them; and therefore all their Re∣proaches,
and all their Fury at the Author will be perfectly lost; he is
prepar'd to contemn them, as they deserve.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE Introduction to the Work.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>LIB.</HI> I. A Satyrical Allusion to the Heathen Gods, who
are suppos'd to have been all of them Kings or famous Men in
their Time, and fabl'd into Deities by the Error and Ignorance
of those Days; concluding with a List of Great but Vicious
Princes in our Modern times, fit to make Gods of in the next
Promotion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Allusion brought down to the Kings below, who are call'd
God's too in the Scripture: Their Original Power examin'd
from its Patriarchal Institution; and joyning in Societies for
mutual Defence prov'd to be the General Act, even of those
Patriarchs themselves; so that the Right of the People Go∣vern'd,
is plain from that very Foundation laid to oppose it;
the Story Illustrated from <HI>Saul,</HI> who tho' Anointed by <HI>Samuel,</HI>
was not Crown'd till the Consent of the People was obtain'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. An Enquiry why God in his Providence gives Power to wick∣ed
Men, and while he punishes private Murthers and Injustice,
leaves the World at the Mercy of Tyrants to ravage and destroy
it at their Pleasure; a Proof that he left Mens Liberty a Trust
to them to preserve and defend, and gave them the use of their
Reason to that purpose.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. A Search into the Laws of Custom for the Divine Right of
Princes; and among the rest, some <HI>Satyr</HI> on the Custom of
those Gentlemen here that preach up this Doctrine, exemplified
in their Treatment of the late King <HI>James;</HI> their first swearing,
and perswading him to believe that they would pay an undispu∣ted
Obedience to him, exposed, as a greater Treachery than their
deserting him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. A Retrospect on the earliest time; Property prov'd the true and
only Original of Power. The Story of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> and the
Ten Tribes, Satyrically methodiz'd; a Hymn to Liberty.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="34"/>
VI. A Draft of Tyranny, and an Enquiry from the Nature of
it, if it ought not to be Resisted; an Excursion here on the
Laws of God, Nature, and Reason, concurring to resist Op∣pression.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII.
A Search into History; affirming, That all Nations, and
in all Ages, have made it a constant Practice to Dethrone Ty∣rants,
and Defend their Liberty, and Examples brought from
Antiquity to prove this Assertion; an Excursion to Home Af∣fairs
and Persons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. The Search into History continued, with Remarks on the In∣troduction
of Tyrranny and Idolatry hand in hand into the
World; an Encomium on <HI>Arbaces,</HI> the first Man that ever
took up Arms for Liberty, and Dethron'd a Monarch; the
<HI>Median</HI> Monarchy examin'd, and prov'd Limited and Regu∣lated
by the People, and Ʋniversal History unravell'd for Ex∣amples
of Tyrants Deposed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. An Historical Search into the Pretended Succession of Kings by
Divine Right, and the spurious irregular Descent of all the
Kings in the World, made out in order Explode the foolish No∣tion
of Divine Succession.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. The same continued and brought Home to the <HI>English</HI> Lines,
from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Race to the Present Reign.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. A Panygerick on the <HI>English</HI> Happy Constitution, depending
neither on Persons nor Race, but upon the Laws and Limitations
of Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. The like on the Person of the Queen, her Government, and
Nobility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Conclusion to the Queen.</ITEM>

<L><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The Authors of this Notion show'd one of the most exact Speci∣mens of their absolute Doctrine that these latter Ages had ever known; and from whence the Strength and Force of their Principle may be fairly determin'd, as follows;</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Filmer</HI> being the Great Champion of this Doctrine, had defended it in print, <HI>Algernoon Sidney,</HI> an Ancient Branch of the Noble Family of the <HI>Sidneys,</HI> and Brother to the then Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> drew out a true System of Original Power, and the stated Bounds of Government and Subjection by the Laws of God, Nature and Reason; and tho' it might be design'd for the Press in answer to Sir <HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> it was not yet perfected or finish'd for the Press, nor had it been expo∣sed to View; but the Manuscript being seized, and the Subject examin'd, it was thought fit instead of answering him with the Pen, to answer him with the Axe, and conquer his Argument by the Extent of that very Power he exploded.</P>
<P>This must pass for an Admirable way of disputing, and is so na∣tural to the thing, that it may pass for a Maxim, That Arbitrary Power is only to be defended by Arbitrary Power, and Passive absolute Subjection can only be exemplifyed by it self.</P>
<P>He that when he is argued against, can answer with his Sword instead of his Pen has certainly a full power in his hand to confirm this Doctrine, and need no other Method; nor is it any other way to be defended: When therefore they found <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI>'s Argument unanswerable by Words, the only way left them was to lay aside debating with the Book, and fall upon the Man—So they cut off his Head, meerly be∣cause they could not answer his Book.</P>
<P>The Book has since been printed, and remains unaswerable to this day; and a Man would desire no better Conquest over the Adversaries of Liberty, than to desire them to reply to it now, when they have Free∣dom to speak, and won't be answer'd, as the Author was, by the Scaffold or Gibbet.</P></NOTE> Divine Commands <HI>concurring</HI> with the Sin,</L>

The Sovereign Law of Reason thought it sit,</L>
<L>And <HI>Median</HI> Kings<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>And thus the Limitation of Power and Superiority of Laws in mat∣ters of Government, have-an Original in the very early Ages of the World, and the Holy Text gives such an Instance of the limited Power of Kings, and their Subjection to the Laws of their own making, that I know no Instances in the World can come up to it; and I have chosen to make no Paraphrase in the Verse upon this Subject, but leave it in plain Words, for all Mens Understanding.</P>
<P>The Princes and Rulers under <HI>Darius,</HI> the <HI>Median</HI> King, having resolv'd the Destruction of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> laid their Contrivance thus to get a Law made, that no Man should pray to any God, or make any Request to any Man, but to the King, for such a Time, <HI>Dan.</HI> 6. 7. Now know∣ing that <HI>Darius</HI> was so fond of <HI>Daniel,</HI> that he would not be directly prevail'd upon to hurt him, they form this Project, and tender it to the King in their Council, or Assembly, or Parliament, and they bring in a <HI>Bill of Occasional Conformity,</HI> and desire the King <HI>to pass it,</HI> not discover∣ing their persecution Design against the Innocent, who they certainly knew would not omit his Duty, and, consequently, would fall into the Snare.</P>
<P>That this was a National Law, or Act of Parliament, the Text is happi∣ly particular in, <HI>v. 7. all the Presidents of the Kingdoms, Governours, Princes,</HI> there's their House of Lords, <HI>Counsellors, and Captains,</HI> there's their House of Commons, <HI>consulted together, to establish a Royal Statute.</HI> Where I ob∣serve,</P>
<P>1. To make a Statute, requir'd the assembling and consulting of the Princes, Counsellors, Great Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as the King, so that Legislation was thus early vested in the Persons to be govern'd.</P>
<P>2. The King had nothing to do, but to approve and sign the Decree, the making it, and consulting about it, requir'd the assembling the Heads of the People.</P>
<P>3. When the Parliament, or Assembly of Princes, and Counsellors, had made a Law, and the King had sign'd it, even the King himself could not alter it; so that the making of Laws was in the People, and when made, they will be superior even to the King himself.</P>
<P>4. Nay, the King had not Power, after a Law was made, so much as to suspend its Execution on the Criminal: All which are deducible di∣rectly from the Example of the Prophet.</P>
<P>Nor is the King's signing this Decree, or Statute, left here to his arbi∣trary Choice, but the Text is plain.</P>
<P>The Princes, Counsellors, <HI>&amp;c. assemble together to the King,</HI> v. 6. that is, in our Parliament-Terms, both Houses join'd in an Address to his Ma∣jesty; for the Reason of his passing this Law, they tell him, <HI>They have all consulted together,</HI> or because they have all consulted..... as appears by the very next Words.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 8. <HI>Now, O King, establish the Decree, and sign the Writing,</HI> or, in our Phrase, Since both Houses have unanimously pass'd this Act, we hope your Majesty will not refuse your Royal Assent, for we have all consult∣ed together about it.</P>
<P>And to confirm this, and prove that it is no forc't Construction, see the next Words, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>WHEREFORE King</HI> Darius <HI>signed the Writing, and the Decree,</HI> even for that Reason.</P>
<P>Now observe the Treatment these People gave their King, upon the ripening of the Plot. They find <HI>Daniel</HI> praying, as they knew before they should, at the Window of his Chamber looking towards <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as was the Custom of their Country, from the Words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> in the Dedication of the Temple, <HI>Hearken thou to the Supplication of thy People</HI> Israel, <HI>when they shall pray towards this Place,</HI> 1 Kings 8. 30. away they go to the King, and first demand a Recognition of the Law from him, <HI>v.</HI> 12. <HI>Then they came near, and spake before the King, concerning the King's Decree, Hast thou not signed a Decree, that every Man that shall ask a Petition of any God or Man, within thirty Days, save of thee, O King, shall be cast into the Den of Lions.</HI></P>
<P>Well, says the King, I have, and you know when it is done, I cannot undo it, but, <HI>According to the Law of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Persians, <HI>it altereth not.</HI> Then they tell him the Story of <HI>Daniel,</HI> how he had not regarded the Law, nor the King's signing it, <HI>v.</HI> 13th.</P>
<P>Now observe the King's Conduct, <HI>v.</HI> 15. <HI>then the King, when he heard these things, was sore displeased with himself,</HI> i.e. for passing such a Law un∣advisedly, without making some <HI>Proviso,</HI> or Exception, for his belov'd <HI>Daniel, and he set his Heart on</HI> Daniel, <HI>to deliver him, and he labour'd to the going down of the Sun to deliver him.</HI> This Passage is a most significant Ex∣pression of the Extremity of the King's Affairs, and how he labour'd be∣tween the Affection he had for the Prophet, and his Respect for the Law.</P>
<P>He labour'd till Sun set, where we may suppose, <HI>I believe, without any Arrogance,</HI> that he labour'd by perswading the Great Men to spare him; it is plain he did not labour with himself to be willing and easie to deliver him up, but the Words are express, <HI>he labour'd to deliver him.</HI></P>
<P>Note here, the King had no dispensing Power, the Criminal the Law condemns, must be executed, even the King himself could not reprieve him.</P>
<P>And tho' the King suspended the Execution but one Day, see the Un∣weariness and Clamour is raised, <HI>THEN,</HI> that is at the going down of the Sun, <HI>these Men assembled unto the King.</HI> Now mark the Emphasis, they do not come with another humble Address to his Majesty, that the Laws might be put in Execution, but they come with a Claim of Right, <HI>KNOW, O KING, that the Laws of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Persians <HI>is, that no Decree, or Statute, which the King establisheth may be changed,</HI> as if they had said, Sir we come to demand our Rights and Liberties, according to the known Laws of this Land, and to tell you Sir, that to dispence with the Laws of the Land is illegal, and is not in your Power. The King took their meaning presently, and knowing he could not contend with them, or in meer Veneration to the most Sacred Authority of the Law, gives them no Answer, but delivers up <HI>Daniel</HI> to their Mercy.</P>
<P>His Concern for him when he was in his Enemies Hands, appears, <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>Then the King went to his Palace, and passed the Night fasting, nei∣ther were the Instruments of Mustck brought before him, and his Sleep went from him.</HI> Here's his Concern for him illustrated farther, by his running to the Den of Lyons, in the Morning, to know how it had far'd with him: His Joy at his Knowledge of his Deliverance; and his severe Revenge upon his Accusers, as may be seen at large, <HI>v.</HI> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</P>
<P>Here's an Original Monarch, whose sacred absolute Power and Domi∣nion could not save a Favourite from the Force of the Law, tho' falsly accused. Here is the due Sovereignty of the Law so acknowledg'd, and so recogised, as no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> could stoop to.</P>
<P>Not King <HI>Charles</HI> the First parted with his beloved <HI>Strafford;</HI> not <HI>Charles</HI> the Second with the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act and <HI>Star-Chamber;</HI> not King <HI>James</HI> with his Crown or King <HI>William</HI> with his Blue-Guards, with a fortieth Part of the Reluctance; but the Law was pass'd, and the King had no Power to alter or suspend it.</P>
<P>Thus the Superiority of the Law, to Kingly Power, was acknowledg'd in the <HI>Median</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Monarchy, and King <HI>Darius,</HI> tho' as potent a Prince as most that ever reign'd, vail'd his Crown to the Regency of Law and acknowledg'd himself unable to alter it, or suspend its Execution.</P></NOTE> disdain'd not to submit:</L>
<L>When Kings submit to Rules of Government,</L>
<L>'Tis not Submission, truly, but Consent.</L>
<L>He that wou'd Reign, but Reign without a Rule,</L>

With Care thy just Ideas regulate,</L>
<L>And ballance well Her Vertue and Her State;</L>
<L><HI>Remember,</HI> Flattering Words no Glory raise,</L>

<L>Her People—</L>
<L>Who their willing Homage pay,</L>
<L>And press'd in Love, by very Choice obey:</L>
<L>Describe Her Humble, Merciful, and Kind,</L>
<L>And swell'd in Triumphs, <HI>not at all in Mind:</HI></L>
<L>Then from thy artless, well-designing Pen,</L>

<L>Mean Time, to Her exalted Throne address,</L>

<HEAD>TO THE
QUEEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>TIS Heaven's Decree, th'Almighty Voice,</L>
<L>Has spoke the Word, you always must rejoice:</L>
<L>Fate that does Nature's Lottery supervise,</L>
<L>Directs your Hand, you always draw the Prize;</L>
<L>The very Disappointments of your Reign,</L>
<L>So Heaven commands, and Hell resists in vain,</L>
<L>Revert to Joys, and in your Loss you gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From vain Attempts, and a disgrac'd Retreat,</L>
<L>Your flying Troops unlook'd for Conquest meet;</L>
<L>As if your Genius strove to let them know,</L>
<L>What they your Fates not their own Conquestowe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Cadiz</HI> repells your Troops, that they may fly,</L>
<L>To <HI>Vigo</HI> Spoils, and Golden Victory;</L>
<L>And <HI>Gibraltar</HI> your rising Glory greets,</L>
<L>And calls to Conquest your <HI>too passive</HI> Fleets.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The waning Glory of th'<HI>Algarvian</HI> War,</L>
<L>Unworthy <HI>Charles</HI>'s Fortune, or your Care,</L>
<L>Weakens your Hands, that you may stronger grow,</L>
<L>And to a nobler Nation's Conquest go;</L>
<L><HI>Castilian</HI> Mountains, distant and remote,</L>
<L>Too cold their Temper, as their Clime too hot;</L>
<L>Repulse your Arms to their own Country's Shame,</L>
<L>That <HI>Catalognian</HI> Coasts may raise Fame.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="371"/>
And <HI>Charles</HI> retreating, in your Fate secure,</L>
<L>In Disappointment makes his Conquest sure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Ruvigny</HI> so from <HI>Guadiana</HI> flies,</L>
<L>That <HI>Alcantara</HI> may be made his Prize;</L>
<L>Th' insulting <HI>Spaniards</HI> so contemn his Force,</L>
<L>But with their Victory secur'd the Curse;</L>
<L>Wounded, in Flames of just Revenge he'll burn,</L>
<L>And left his Hand, a Pledge of his return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Marlbro'</HI> at the bauk'd <HI>Moselle repines,</HI></L>
<L>Your Fate repay'd him with the conquer'd Lines;</L>
<L>Vict'ry that waited on <HI>that Son of War,</HI></L>
<L>Adjourn'd it here, that she might yield it there:</L>
<L>Thus, <HI>MADAM,</HI> your Disasters are your Gain,</L>
<L>And they that beat us, conquer but in vain;</L>
<L>Your Glory rises, when you want Success,</L>
<L>And in your Loss you find your Happiness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In nearer Circumstances 'tis the same,</L>
<L>All Things concur, to raise your growing Fame;</L>
<L>The very Chagrin, Feud, and Discontent,</L>
<L>That ruin others, fix your Government:</L>
<L>Envy, in spight of all her Snakes, concurs,</L>
<L>And she that murthers Kingdoms, settles yours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So Heav'n commands, and so when Heav'n commands,</L>
<L>Hell shall concur,</L>
<L>Dev'ls with directed Hands,</L>
<L>Shall aid that Crown that on his Power depends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Parties join to urge the Nation's Fate,</L>
<L>Their very Fury does their Aims defeat:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="372"/>
Tacking their Projects to invade your Throne,</L>
<L>They tack the Nation's Peace, and sink their own;</L>
<L>Their worst Designs, your Glory to invade,</L>
<L>That Glory rais'd, and those Designs betray'd;</L>
<L>By their own Guilt, and your Success, struck Dumb,</L>
<L>Chagrin and Heartless, they foresee their Doom;</L>
<L>Silent they stand, in envious Whispers curse,</L>
<L>And as they rise in Rage, decay in Force.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Scotland</HI> rejects our Settlement and Crown,</L>
<L>That Two vast Nations may unite in One;</L>
<L>And all the threatning Clouds of Northern Night,</L>
<L>Assist to make that Union still more bright;</L>
<L>The Thoughts of <HI>Border-War,</HI> as they increase,</L>
<L>Serve but to prompt our wiser Heads to Peace;</L>
<L>And all the Men of Plot, and vast Intrigue,</L>
<L>While they inflame the Nations, press the League.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Envy, whose feeble Jaws and falt'ring Tongue,</L>
<L>Had chew'd the vip'rous Blood of Strife too long;</L>
<L>Ripen'd for Mischief, from her crasie Bed,</L>
<L>With tainted Breath, and vile corrupted Head,</L>
<L>In whining Eloquence, and subtle Phrase,</L>
<L>And Curses guilded with the Baits of Praise,</L>
<L>Attempts the wav'ring Nations to deceive,</L>
<L>With Arts, 'twas fear'd, would make th' Elect believe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see her Gall, for vilest Ends design'd,</L>
<L>Repuls'd, flows back, and cankers in her Mind;</L>
<L>The gross corroded Humour inward draws,</L>
<L>Eats up the very Vitals of their Cause;</L>
<L>The vile Harangues, the Feud they wish'd, appeas'd,</L>
<L>And laid the very Storm they would ha' rais'd:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="373"/>
Thus they your Peace, tho' they your Peace abhorr'd,</L>
<L>By their own Steps to ruin it, procur'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Instructing Miseries make Nations wise,</L>
<L>Illuminate their Judgments with their Eyes;</L>
<L>Direct them in the Quest of Happiness,</L>
<L>And tell them boldly, all depends on Peace:</L>
<L>This is the Sanction given to your High Reign,</L>
<L>Where Heaven thus blesses, Men may curse in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis you that makes your Government Divine,</L>
<L>The Sacred's in your Vertue▪ not your Line:</L>
<L>Your Truth gives awsul Homage to your Word,</L>
<L>And 'tis your Justice sanctifies your Sword;</L>
<L>Your God-like Pity suits the Crown you wear,</L>
<L>Like Heaven, your Mercy makes your People fear:</L>
<L>Force is tyrannick, but 'tis Love perswades,</L>
<L>And always conquers, where it once invades:</L>
<L>Thus when you quit the Bondage of Command,</L>
<L>You govern all our Hearts with out your Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Kingdoms thus in Heart, like yours, unite,</L>
<L>No wonder Nations tremble at the sight:</L>
<L>Vict'ry must come, the World expects no less,</L>
<L>Where Two such Bodies, join'd in One, address;</L>
<L>Such Union, <HI>MADAM,</HI> ne'er was seen before,</L>
<L>And as 'tis strange, must strange Effects procure,</L>
<L>For suited to their Zeal will be their Power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Princes thus their Peoples Prayers possess,</L>
<L>They very seldom are deny'd Success;</L>
<L>For never Hands with such Assurance fight,</L>
<L>As where they're mov'd by Hearts that first unite;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="374"/>
Such Nations of a double Power possest,</L>
<L>With double Hopes of Victory are blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Seas of Blood! What Storms of Party-Strife!</L>
<L>Have brought this long expected Truce to Life:</L>
<L>'Twas Danger, <HI>MADAM,</HI> made this Peace secure,</L>
<L>The Nation's Suff'rings make your Glory sure;</L>
<L>Till thus alarm'd, how fatally we strove,</L>
<L>Neither by Int rest govern'd, hor by Love;</L>
<L>We wou'd not all your just Perswasions hear,</L>
<L>Till we were frighted into Peace, by Fear;</L>
<L>Pacifick Eloquence was all in vain,</L>
<L>No Passion can, like that of Fear, restrain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, <HI>MADAM,</HI> Heaven has long decreed it so,</L>
<L>Your Glory must from your Misfortunes grow:</L>
<L>You fall to rise, your Losses are your Gain,</L>
<L>For Pleasures are illustrated by Pain:</L>
<L>Your Enemies, that think they pull you down,</L>
<L>Exalt your Glory, and eclipse their own:</L>
<L>The publick Struggles of our Party-Powers,</L>
<L>Break their own Int'rests, and establish yours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In all your happy and successful Reign,</L>
<L>Peace rises out of Strife, and Ease from Pain,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sampson</HI>'s Riddle's acted here again.</L>
