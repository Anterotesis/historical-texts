<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Reader can desire no better Recommendation
of the History now published, than to be assured
that it is the genuine Work of the Great Earl of
<HI>Clarendon.</HI> The Work it self bears plain Cha∣racteristicks
of its Author. The same Dignity of
Sentiment, and Style, which distinguishes <HI>THE
HISTORY OF THE REBELLION,</HI> and all
other the Works of this noble Writer, breathes
through the whole of this Performance.</P>
<P>THE Reason, why this History has lain so long concealed, will ap∣pear
from the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Continuation, Page 1.</NOTE> Title of it, which shews that his Lordship intended it <HI>only for
the Information of his Children.</HI> But the late Lord <HI>Hyde,</HI> judging that
so faithful and authentick an Account of this interesting Period of our
History would be an useful and acceptable Present to the Publick, and bear∣ing
a grateful Remembrance of this Place of his Education, left by his Will
this, and the other Remains of his Great Grandfather, in the Hands of
Trustees, to be printed at our Press, and directed <HI>that the Profits arising
from the Sale should be employed towards the establishing a Riding-School
in the University.</HI> But Lord <HI>Hyde</HI> dying before his Father, the then
Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> the Property of these Papers never became vested in him,
and consequently this Bequest was void. However, the noble Heiresses of the
Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> out of their Regard to the Publick, and to this Seat of
Learning, have been pleased to fulfill the kind Intentions of Lord <HI>Hyde,</HI>
and adopt a Scheme recommended both by him,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his Dialogue on Education, P. 325, &amp;c.</NOTE> and his Great Grand∣father.
<PB N="II" REF="5"/>
To this End They have sent to the University this History, to be
printed at our Press, on Condition <HI>that the Profits arising from the Publi∣cation
or Sale of this Work be applied, as a Beginning for a Fund for
supporting a Manage, or Academy for Riding, and other useful Exer∣cises,
in</HI> Oxford.</P>
<P>THE Work here offered to the Publick consists of two Parts. The Second,
which is the most important and interesting Part of the Work, is <HI>THE
HISTORY OF THE EARL OF CLARENDON'S LIFE FROM THE YEAR 1660
TO</HI> 1667, from the Restoration to the Time of his Banishment, and in∣cludes
in it the most memorable Transactions of those Times. It may be
therefore considered in two Views. It is a Second Part of <HI>LORD CLARENDON'S
LIFE:</HI> and is also a Continuation of his former History, entitled
<HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION,</HI> from the Year 1660, where that ends,
to the Year 1667. This is carefully printed, without any material Varia∣tions,
from a Manuscript all of Lord <HI>Clarendon's</HI> own Hand-writing, ex∣cepting
some few Pages in the Hand of his Amanuensis, which are only
Transcripts from two Papers, the one, <HI>a Letter from the Chancellor to the
King on the Subject of his Majesty's declared Displeasure;</HI> the other, <HI>a
Paper containing his Reasons for withdrawing himself,</HI> which He left be∣hind
him to be presented to the House of Peers.</P>
<P>TO this our noble Benefactresses have thought fit to prefix, as a First
Part, <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE EARL OF CLARENDON'S LIFE, FROM HIS
BIRTH, TO THE YEAR</HI> 1660, extracted from another Manuscript of Lord
<HI>Clarendon's</HI> own Hand-writing. This other Manuscript is entitled by his
Lordship, <HI>THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN LIFE,</HI> and contains likewise the Sub∣stance
of <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.</HI> However, it is not the Ma∣nuscript
from whence that History was printed, but appears rather to be
the rough Draught, from whence that History, or however great Part of it,
was afterwards compiled. For although He tells us towards the Close of this
Work, that He wrote the first four Books of <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBEL∣LION
in the Island of</HI> Jersey, (many Years before the Date of this <HI>HISTORY
OF HIS LIFE)</HI> yet He likewise informs us, that He did not proceed to com∣pleat
that History till after his Banishment. It is therefore supposed by the
Family (and the Supposition seems to carry with it great Probability) that,
seeing an unjust and cruel Persecution prevail against him, He was induced
at that Time to extend the original Plan of his Work, by introducing the
particular History of his own Life, from his earliest Days down to the Time
of his Disgrace, as the most effectual Means of vindicating his Character,
wickedly traduced by his Enemies, and artfully misrepresented to a Master,
whom he had long and faithfully served, whose Countenance and Favour be∣ing
transferred to the Authors and Abettors of his Ruin, might probably in the
Eyes of the World, give too much Colour to their Aspersions. But afterwards,
on more mature Thoughts, his great Benevolence, and publick Spirit, pre∣vailed
on him to drop the Defence of his own private Character, and resume
his original Plan of <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.</HI> However his noble
Descendants, willing to do Justice to the Memory of their Great Grandfather,
and thinking it might be also of Service to the Publick to deliver his Exemplary
Life as compleat, as They could authentically collect it, have caused such
Parts of this Manuscript, as related to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon's</HI> private
Life, to be extracted, and according to their Directions it is printed.</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="iii" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>The Directions are as follows.</HEAD>
<P>“THE LIFE OF LORD CHANCELLOR CLARENDON FROM HIS BIRTH TO
THE RESTORATION OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, is extracted from a large
Manuscript in his own Hand-writing, in which is contained what has al∣ready
been printed in THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION; and there∣fore
Care has been taken to transcribe only what has never yet been
published: But as those Passages are often intermixed with the History
already printed, it has been found necessary to preserve Connection, by
giving<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Those Passages are indented. Those printed in <HI>Italicks,</HI> Pages 59, 82, 90, 135, the Note Page 100, and some others
still less material, were added with the same View.</NOTE> Abstracts of some Parts of the printed History, with References
to the Pages, where the Reader may be satisfied more at large. And,
as great Pains have been taken to put this First Part in the Order it now
stands, it is desired that in this first Edition it may be printed exactly
after the Copy to be sent.”</P>
<P>“THE original Manuscript of THE CONTINUATION OF LORD CHAN∣CELLOR
CLARENDON'S LIFE FROM 1660 TO 1667 INCLUSIVE is very in∣correct,
many Words being omitted, that must necessarily be supplied:
But it is desired that no other Alterations may be made, except in the
Orthography, or where literal, or grammatical Errors require it, or
where little Inaccuracies may have escaped the Attention of the Author.
The Work must be printed entire, as it now stands, no Part of it left
out, not an Abstract, nor a Reference omitted.”</P>
<P><HI>THESE Directions have been punctually observed. The Second Part is
printed from his Lordship's Manuscript entire, without any Omission, or Va∣riation,
except as above. And with Regard to the First Part, the Extract
sent to us has been carefully compared with the Original Manuscript it self,
and found to agree: So that the Whole here offered to the Publick is the ge∣nuine
Work of the Lord Chancellor</HI> CLARENDON. <HI>And both these Valuable
Original Manuscripts are given to the University by our noble Benefactresses,
to be deposited in the Publick Library.</HI></P>

Knight: And these four Sons and four Daughters lived all above forty
Years after the Death of their Father.</P>
<P>LAURENCE, shortly after his Marriage with <HI>Anne,</HI> purchased the Manor
of <HI>West-Hatch,</HI> where He died, and several other Lands; and having
taken Care to breed his Sons at the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Inns of
Court, leaving his Wife, the Mother of all his Children, possessed of the
greatest Part of his Estate, presuming that She would be careful and kind
to all their Children, upon that Account left the Bulk of his Estate to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
<HI>Robert</HI> his eldest Son, who married <HI>Anne</HI> the Daughter of—<HI>Castilian</HI>
of <HI>Benham</HI> in the County of <HI>Berks,</HI> Es{que} who had many Children, and
lived to the Age of eighty, and left his Estate, a little impaired by the
Marriage of many Daughters, to his Son. To <HI>Laurence</HI> his second Son,
(who was afterwards Sir <HI>Laurence,</HI> and Attorney General to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI>
and a Lawyer of great Name and Practice) He left the impropriate Rectory
of <HI>Dinton,</HI> after the Life of <HI>Anne</HI> his Mother, charged with an Annuity
of forty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> to his third Son <HI>Henry</HI> for his Life; and He
charged some other Part of his Estate with an Annuity of thirty Pounds
<HI>per Annum</HI> to his youngest Son <HI>Nicholas,</HI> for his Life, relying upon the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Goodness of his Wife, who was left very rich, as well by his Donation,
as from her Husband <HI>Calthurst,</HI> that She would provide for the better
Support of the younger Children; two of which raised their Fortunes by
the Law, <HI>Laurence,</HI> as was said before, being Attorney General to the
Queen, and <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the youngest Son, living to be Lord Chief Justice
of the King's Bench, and dying in that Office; both of them leaving
behind them many Sons and Daughters.</P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his Fa∣ther.</NOTE> the third Son, being of the Middle Temple at his Father's
Death, and being thought to be most in the Favour of his Mother, and being
ready to be called to the Bar, though He had studied the Law very well,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and was a very good Scholar, having proceeded Master of Arts in <HI>Oxford,</HI>
had yet no Mind to the Practice of the Law, but had long had an Inclination
to travel beyond the Seas, which in that strict Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
was not usual, except to Merchants, and such Gentlemen who resolved to
be Soldiers; and at last prevailed with his Mother to give him Leave to go to
the <HI>Spa</HI> for his Health, from whence He followed his former Inclinations,
and passing through <HI>Germany,</HI> He went into <HI>Italy,</HI> and from <HI>Florence</HI> He
went to <HI>Syena,</HI> and thence to <HI>Rome:</HI> Which was not only strictly inhibited
to all the Queen's Subjects, but was very dangerous to all the <HI>English</HI> Nation
who did not profess themselves <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> to which Profession He<MILESTONE N="50"/>
was very averse, in Regard of the great Animosity <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> (who was
then Pope) had to the Person of Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> Yet Cardinal <HI>Allen,</HI>
who was the last <HI>English</HI> Cardinal, being then in <HI>Rome,</HI> He received so
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
much Protection from him, that during the Time He staid there, which
was some Months, He received no Trouble, though many <HI>English</HI> Priests
murmured very much, and said, “that my Lord Cardinal was much to
be blamed for protecting such Men, who came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and so seeing
the Ecclesiastical Persons of that Nation, discovered them afterwards when
They came into <HI>England,</HI> and so They were put to Death.”</P>
<P>AFTER He was returned into <HI>England</HI> his Mother was very glad, and
persuaded him very earnestly to marry, offering him in that Case, that
whereas She had the Rectory of <HI>Dinton</HI> in Jointure for her Life, upon
<MILESTONE N="10"/>which He had only an Annuity of forty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for his Life,
the Remainder being to come to <HI>Laurence</HI> the second Brother and his
Heirs for ever, She would immediately resign her Term to him, for his
better Support, and would likewise purchase of <HI>Laurence,</HI> the said Rectory
for the Life of <HI>Henry,</HI> and such a Wife as He should marry; upon which
Encouragement, and depending still upon his Mother's future Bounty,
about the thirtieth Year of his Age, He married <HI>Mary,</HI> one of the
Daughters and Heirs of <HI>Edward Langford</HI> of <HI>Trowbridge</HI> in the County of
<HI>Wilts,</HI> Es{que} by whom in present, and after her Mother, He had a good
Fortune, in the Account of that Age. From that Time, He lived a
<MILESTONE N="20"/>private Life at <HI>Dinton</HI> aforesaid, with great Chearfulness and Content, and
with a general Reputation throughout the whole Country; being a Person of
great Knowledge and Reputation, and of so great Esteem for Integrity, that
most Persons near him referred all Matters of Contention and Difference
which did arise amongst them, to his Determination; by which, that Part
of the Country lived in more Peace and Quietness than many of their
Neighbours. During the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> He served as a Burgess
for some neighbour Boroughs in many Parliaments; but from the Death of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> He never was in <HI>London,</HI> though He lived above thirty
Years after; and his Wife, who was married to him above forty Years,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>never was in <HI>London</HI> in her Life; the Wisdom and Frugality of that Time
being such, that few Gentlemen made Journies to <HI>London,</HI> or any other
expensive Journies, but upon important Business, and their Wives never;
by which Providence, They enjoyed and improved their Estates in the
Country, and kept good Hospitality in their Houses, brought up their
Children well, and were beloved by their Neighbours; and in this Rank,
and with this Reputation this Gentleman lived till He was seventy Years
of Age; his younger Brother the Chief Justice dying some Years before
him, and his two elder Brothers outliving him: The great Affection between
the four Brothers, and towards their Sisters, of whom all, enjoyed Plenty
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and Contentedness, was very notorious throughout the Country, and of
Credit to them all.</P>
<P>HENRY HYDE, the third Son of <HI>Laurence,</HI> by his Intermarriage with
<HI>Mary Langford,</HI> had four Sons and five Daughters, and being by the
Kindness and Bounty of his Mother, who lived long, and till He had
seven or eight Children, possessed of such an Estate as made his Condition
easy to him, lived still in the Country, as was said before. <HI>Laurence</HI> his
eldest Son died young; <HI>Henry</HI> his second Son lived till He was twenty six
or twenty seven Years of Age; <HI>Edward</HI> his third Son was He who came
afterwards to be Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and Lord High Chancellor of <HI>England;
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Nicholus</HI> died young; <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> were both in the University of
<HI>Oxford</HI> together; <HI>Henry</HI> being Master of Arts the Act before his younger
Brother <HI>Edward</HI> came to the University, who was designed by his Father
to the Clergy.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11"/>
EDWARD HYDE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of the Author's Birth. His Educa∣tion.</NOTE> being the third Son of his Father, was born at <HI>Din∣ton</HI>
upon the eighteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> in the Year 1608, being the
fifth Year of King <HI>James;</HI> and was always bred in his Father's House un∣der
the Care of a Schoolmaster, to whom his Father had given the Vi∣carage
of that Parish, who having been always a Schoolmaster, had bred
many good Scholars, and this Person of whom we now speak, principally
by the Care and Conversation of his Father, (who was an excellent Scholar,
and took Pleasure in conferring with him, and contributed much more to
his Education than the School did) was thought fit to be sent to the Uni∣versity
soon after He was thirteen Years of Age; and being a younger<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Son of a younger Brother, was to expect a small Patrimony from his Fa∣ther,
but to make his own Fortune by his own Industry; and in Order to
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is sent to</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> was sent by his Father to <HI>Oxford</HI> at that Time, being about <HI>Mag∣dalen</HI>
Election Time, in Expectation that He should have been chosen
Demy of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College, the Election being to be at that Time, for
which He was recommended by a special Letter from King <HI>James</HI> to Dr.
<HI>Langton</HI> then President of that College; but upon Pretence that the Letter
came too late, though the Election was not then begun, He was not chosen,
and so remained in <HI>Magdalen</HI> Hall (where He was before admitted) under
the Tuition of Mr. <HI>John Oliver,</HI> a Fellow of that College, who had been<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Junior of the Act a Month before, and a Scholar of Eminency.</P>
<P>THE Year following, the President of the College having received Re∣prehension
from the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> then Secretary of State, for giving no
more Respect to the King's Letter, He was chosen the next Election in
the first Place, but that whole Year passed without any Avoidance of a
Demy's Place, which was never known before in any Man's Memory; and
that Year King <HI>James</HI> died, and shortly after, <HI>Henry</HI> his elder Brother,
and thereupon his Father having now no other Son, changed his former
Inclination, and resolved to send his Son <HI>Edward</HI> to the Inns of Court:
He was then entered in the middle Temple by his Uncle <HI>Nicholas Hyde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>entered of the Middle Tem∣ple.</HI></NOTE><MILESTONE N="30"/>
who was then Treasurer of that Society, and afterwards Lord Chief Justice
of the King's Bench; but by Reason of the great Plague then at <HI>London</HI>
in the first Year of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and the Parliament being then adjourned
to <HI>Oxford,</HI> whither the Plague was likewise then brought by Sir <HI>James
Hussy,</HI> one of the Masters of the Chancery, who died in <HI>New-College</HI>
the first Night after his Arrival at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and shortly after Dr. <HI>Chaloner</HI>
Principal of <HI>Alban-Hall,</HI> who had supped that Night with Sir <HI>James
Hussy,</HI> He did not go to the middle Temple till the <HI>Michaelmass</HI> Term after
the Term at <HI>Reading,</HI> but remained partly at his Father's House, and partly
at the University, where He took the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
then left it, rather with the Opinion of a young Man of Parts and Pregnancy
of Wit, than that He had improved it much by Industry, the Discipline
of that Time being not so strict as it hath been since, and as it ought to be;
and the Custom of Drinking being too much introduced and practised,
his elder Brother having been too much corrupted in that Kind, and so
having at his first Coming given him some Liberty, at least some Example
towards that License, insomuch as He was often heard to say, “that it was
a very good Fortune to him, that his Father so soon removed him from
the University, though He always reserved a high Esteem of it.”</P>
<P>BEFORE the Beginning of <HI>Michaelmass</HI> Term (which was in the Year 1625)<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the City being then clear from the Plague, He went from <HI>Marlborough</HI>
after the Quarter Sessions with his Uncle <HI>Nicholas Hyde</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and ar∣rived
there the Eve of the Term, being then between sixteen and seven∣teen
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
Years of Age: In the Evening He went to Prayers to the Temple
Church, and was there seized upon by a Fit of an Ague very violently,
which proved a Quartan, and brought him in a short Time so weak, that
his Friends much feared a Consumption, so that his Uncle thought fit
shortly after <HI>Alhollandtide</HI> to send him into the Country to <HI>Pirton</HI> in <HI>North
Wiltshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Removed to</HI> Pirton.</NOTE> whither his Father had removed himself from <HI>Dinton;</HI> chusing
rather to live upon his own Land, the which He had purchased many Years
before, and to rent <HI>Dinton,</HI> which was but a Lease for Lives, to a Tenant.
He came Home to his Father's House very weak, his Ague continuing so
<MILESTONE N="10"/>violently upon him (though it sometimes changed its Course from a quar∣tan
to a tertian, and then to a quotidian, and on new Year's Day he had
two hot Fits and two cold Fits) until <HI>Whitsunday</HI> following, that all Men
thought him to be in a Consumption; it then left him, and he grew quickly
strong again. In this Time of his Sickness his Uncle was made Chief
Justice:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Returns to the</HI> Middle Tem∣ple.</NOTE> It was <HI>Michaelmass</HI> following before He returned to the Middle
Temple, having by his Want of Health lost a full Year of Study, and
when He returned, it was without great Application to the Study of the
Law for some Years, it being then a Time when the Town was full of
Soldiers, the King having then a War both with <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Business of the Isle of <HI>Ree</HI> shortly followed; and He had gotten into
the Acquaintance of many of those Officers, which took up too much of
his Time for one Year; but as the War was quickly ended, so He had the
good Fortune quickly to make a full Retreat from that Company, and
from any Conversation with any of them, and without any Hurt or Pre∣judice;
insomuch as He used often to say, “that since it pleased God to
preserve him whilst He did keep that Company (in which He wonder∣fully
escaped from being involved in many Inconveniences) and to with∣draw
him so soon from it, He was not sorry that He had some Expe∣rience
in the Conversation of such Men, and of the Licence of those
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Times”, which was very exorbitant: Yet when He did indulge himself
that Liberty, it was without any signal Debauchery, and not without some
Hours every Day, at least every Night, spent amongst his Books; yet He
would not deny that more than to be able to answer his Uncle, who almost
every Night put a Case to him in Law, He could not bring himself to an
industrious Pursuit of the Law Study; but rather loved polite Learning and
History, in which, especially in the <HI>Roman,</HI> he had been always con∣versant.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1628 his Father gave him Leave to ride the Circuit in the
Summer with his Uncle the Chief Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sets out on the</HI> Norfolk <HI>Cir∣cuit.</HI></NOTE> who then rode the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Cir∣cuit;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and indeed desired it, both that He might see those Counties, and
especially that He might be out of <HI>London</HI> in that Season, when the Small
Pox raged very furiously, and many Persons, some whereof were much
acquainted with him, died of that Disease in the Middle Temple itself:
It was about the Middle of <HI>July</HI> when that Circuit began, and <HI>Cambridge</HI>
was the first Place the Judges begun at; Mr. Justice <HI>Harvey,</HI> (one of the
Judges of the Common Pleas) was in Commission with the Chief Justice:
They both came into <HI>Cambridge</HI> on the <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, and the next Day
Mr. <HI>Edward Hyde</HI> fell sick,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Falls sick of the Small Pox at</HI> Cambridge.</NOTE> which was imputed only to his Journey the
Day before in very hot Weather; but He continued so ill the Day or two
<MILESTONE N="50"/>following, that it was apprehended that He might have the Small Pox;
whereupon He was removed out of <HI>Trinity</HI> College, where the Judges
were lodged, to the <HI>Sun</HI> Inn, over against the College Gate, the Judges
being to go out of Town the next Day; but before they went, the Small
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
Pox appeared; whereupon his Uncle put him under the Care of Mr. <HI>Crane</HI>
an eminent Apothecary, who had been bred up under Dr. <HI>Butler,</HI> and
was in much greater Practice than any Physician in the University; and left
with him <HI>Laurence St. Loe</HI> one of his Servants, who was likewise his Ne∣phew,
to assist and comfort him: It pleased God to preserve him from that
devouring Disease, which was spread all over him very furiously, and had
so far prevailed over him, that for some Hours both his Friends and Phy∣sician
consulted of nothing but of the Place and Manner of his Burial; but
as I said, by God's Goodness He escaped that Sickness, and within few
Days more than a Month after his first Indisposition, He passed in mode∣rate<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Journeys to his Father's House at <HI>Pirton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Returns again to</HI> Pirton <HI>after his Recovery.</HI></NOTE> where He arrived a Day or
two before <HI>Bartholemew</HI> Day.</P>
<P>HE was often wont to say, that He was reading to his Father in <HI>Cam∣den's</HI>
Annals, and that particular Place, in which it is said, “<HI>Johannes
Feltonus, qui Bullam Pontificiam valvis Palatii Episcopi Londinensis af∣fixerat
jam deprehensus, cum fugere nollet, factum confessus quod tamen
crimen agnoscere noluit,</HI> &amp;c.” when a Person of the Neighbourhood
knocked at the Door, and being called in, told his Father, that a Post was
then passed through the Village to <HI>Charleton,</HI> the House of the Earl of
<HI>Berkshire,</HI> to inform the Earl of <HI>Berkshire</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>

in the Court, made a great Change in the State, produced a sudden Disbanding
of all Armies, and a due Observation of, and Obedience to the
Laws; so that there being no more Mutations in View (which usually affect
the Spirits of young Men, at least hold them some Time at Gaze)
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> returned again to his Studies at the Middle Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And from</HI> Pir∣ton <HI>to the</HI> Middle Tem∣ple.</NOTE> having it
still in his Resolution to dedicate himself to the Profession of the Law,
without declining the politer Learning, to which his Humour and his
Conversation kept him always very indulgent; and to lay some Obligation<MILESTONE N="30"/>
upon himself to be fixed to that Course of Life, He inclined to a Propo∣sition
of Marriage, which having no other Passion in it, than an Appetite
to a convenient Estate, succeeded not, yet produced new Acquaintance,
and continued the same Inclinations.</P>
<P>ABOUT this Time his Uncle Sir <HI>Nicholas Hyde</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the
King's Bench,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Death and Character of his Uncle Sir</HI> Nicholas Hyde.</NOTE> died of a malignant Fever, gotten from the Infection of
some Goal in his Summer Circuit: He was a Man of excellent Learning
for that Province He was to govern, of unsuspected and unblemished In∣tegrity,
of an exemplar Gravity and Austerity, which was necessary for
the Manners of that Time, corrupted by the marching of Armies, and by<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the Licence after the disbanding them; and though upon his Promotion
some Years before, from a private Practicer of the Law, to the supreme
Judicatory in it, by the Power and Recommendation of the great Fa∣vourite,
of whose Council He had been, He was exposed to much
Envy and some Prejudice; yet his Behaviour was so grateful to all the
Judges, who had an entire Confidence in him, his Service so useful to the
King in his Government, his Justice and Sincerity so conspicuous through∣out
the Kingdom, that the Death of no Judge had in any Time been
more lamented.</P>
<P>THE Loss of so beneficial an Encouragement and Support in that Pro∣fession,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
did not at all discourage his Nephew in his Purpose; rather added
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
new Resolution to him; and to call Home all straggling and wandering Ap∣petites,
which naturally produce Irresolution and Inconstancy in the Mind,
with his Father's Consent and Approbation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Hyde's</HI> Marraige.</NOTE> He married a young Lady
very fair and beautiful, the Daughter of Sir <HI>George Ayliffe,</HI> a Gentleman
of a good Name and Fortune in the County of <HI>Wilts,</HI> where his own Ex∣pectations
lay, and by her Mother (a <HI>St. John</HI>) nearly allied to many noble
Families in <HI>England.</HI> He enjoyed this Comfort and Composure of Mind
a very short Time, for within less than six Months after He was married,
being upon the Way from <HI>London</HI> towards his Father's House, she fell sick
<MILESTONE N="10"/>at <HI>Reading,</HI> and being removed to a Friend's House near that Town, the
Small Pox discovered themselves, and (she being with Child) forced her to
miscarry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of his Wife.</NOTE> and She died within two Days. He bore her Loss with so great
Passion and Confusion of Spirit, that it shook all the Frame of his Reso∣lutions,
and nothing but his entire Duty and Reverence to his Father,
kept him from giving over all Thoughts of Books, and transporting him∣self
beyond the Seas, to enjoy his own Melancholy; nor could any Per∣suasion
or Importunity from his Friends, prevail with him in some Years
to think of another Marriage. There was an ill Accident in the Court
befel a Lady of a Family nearly allied to his Wife, whose Memory was
<MILESTONE N="20"/>very dear to him, and there always continued a firm Friendship in him to
all her Alliance, which likewise ever manifested an equal Affection to him;
amongst those was <HI>William</HI> Viscount <HI>Grandison,</HI> a young Man of extraor∣dinary
Hope, between whom and the other there was an entire Confi∣dence:
The Injury was of that Nature, that the young Lord thought of
nothing but repairing it his own Way; but those Imaginations were quickly
at an End, by the King's rigorous and just Proceeding against the Per∣sons
offending, in committing them both to the Tower, and declaring
that “since He was satisfied that there was a Promise of Marriage in the
Case, the Gentleman should make good his Promise by marrying the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Lady; or be kept in Prison, and for ever banished from all Pretence or
Relation to the Court”, where He had a very great Credit and Interest:
This Declaration by the King, made the nearest Friends of the Lady
pursue the Design of this Reparation more solicitously, in which They
had all Access to the King, who continued still in his declared Judgment
in the Matter: In this Pursuit Mr. <HI>Hyde's</HI> passionate Affection to the Fa∣mily
embarked him, and They were all as willing to be guided by his
Conduct; the Business was to be followed by frequent Instances at Court,
and Conferences with those who had most Power and Opportunity to con∣firm
the King in the Sense He had entertained; and those Conferences
<MILESTONE N="40"/>were wholly managed by him, who thereby had all Admission to the
Persons of Alliance to the Lady, and so concerned in the Dishonour,
which was a great Body of Lords and Ladies of principal Relations in
Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Occasion of Mr.</HI> Hyde'<HI>s Intro∣duction to the Marquis of</HI> Hamilton.</NOTE> with whom in a short Time He was of great Credit and Esteem;
of which the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> was one, who having married an ex∣cellent
Lady, Cousin-German to the injured Person, seemed the most con∣cerned
and most zealous for her Vindication, and who had at that Time
the most Credit of any Man about the Court, and upon that Occasion
entered into a Familiarity with him, and made as great Professions of
Kindness to him as could pass to a Person at that Distance from him,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>which continued till the End and Conclusion of that Affair, when the
Marquis believed that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had discovered some Want of Sincerity
in him in that Prosecution, which He pretended so much to assert.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
THE Mention of this particular little Story, in itself of no seeming
Consequence, is not inserted here only as it made some Alterations, and
accidentally introduced him into another Way of Conversation than He
had formerly been accustomed to, and which in Truth by the Ac∣quaintance,
by the Friends and Enemies, He then made, had an Influence
upon the whole Course of his Life afterwards; but as it made such Im∣pressions
upon the whole Court, by dividing the Lords and Ladies, both
in their Wishes and Appearances, that much of that Faction grew out of
it, which survived the Memory of the Original; and from this Occasion
(to shew us from how small Springs great Rivers may arise) the Women,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
who till then had not appeared concerned in publick Affairs, began to have
some Part in all Business; and having shewh themselves warm upon this
Amour, as their Passions or Affections carried them, and thereby entered
into new Affections, and formed new Interests; the Activity in their Spi∣rits
remained still vigorous when the Object which first inspired it was va∣nished
and put in Oblivion. Nor were the very Ministers of State vacant
upon this Occasion; They who for their own Sakes, or, as They pre∣tended,
for the King's Dignity, and Honour of the Court, desired the
Ruin of the Gentleman, pressed the Magnitude of the Crime, in bring∣ing
so great a Scandal upon the King's Family, which would hinder Per∣sons<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of Honour from sending their Children to the Court; and that there
could be no Reparation without the Marriage, which They therefore only
insisted upon, because They believed He would prefer Banishment before
it; others who had Friendship for him and believed that He had an In∣terest
in the Court, which might accommodate himself and them if this
Breach were closed any Way, therefore if the King's Severity could not be
prevailed upon, wished it concluded by the Marriage; which neither him∣self
nor They upon whom He most depended, would ever be brought to
consent to; so that all the Jealousies and Animosities in the Court or State,
came to play their own Prizes in the widening or accommodating this<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Contention: In the Conclusion, on a sudden, contrary to the Expectation
of any Man of either Party, the Gentleman was immediately sent out of
the Kingdom, under the Formality of a temporary and short Banishment,
and the Lady commended to her Friends, to be taken care of till her De∣livery;
and from that Time never Word more spoken of the Business, nor
shall their Names ever come upon the Stage by any Record of mine: It
was only observed, that at this Time there was a great Change in the
Friendships of the Court, and in those of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who
came now into the Queen's Confidence, towards whom He had always
been in great Jealousy; and another Lady more appeared in View, who<MILESTONE N="40"/>
had for the most Part before continued behind the Curtain; and who in
few Years after came to a very unhappy and untimely End.</P>
<P>Now after a Widowhood of near three Years, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> inclined again
to marry, which He knew would be the most grateful Thing to his Father
(for whom He had always a profound Reverence) He could do; and though
He needed no other Motive to it, He would often say, that though He was
now called to the Bar, and entered into the Profession of the Law, He
was not so confident of himself that He should not start aside, if his
Father should die, who was then near seventy Years of Age, having
long entertained Thoughts of Travels, but that He thought it necessary<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to lay some Obligation upon himself, which would suppress and restrain all
those Appetites; and thereupon resolved to marry, and so being about the
Age of twenty four Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His second Marriage</NOTE> in the Year of our Lord 1632, He married the
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
Daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Aylesbury</HI> Baronet, Master of Requests to the
King; by whom He had many Children of both Sexes, with whom He
lived very comfortably in the most uncomfortable Times, and very joy∣fully
in those Times when Matter of Joy was administered, for the Space
of five or six and thirty Years; what befell him after her Death will be
recounted in its Place. From the Time of his Marriage He laid aside all
other Thoughts but of his Profession, to the which He betook himself very
seriously; but in the very Entrance into it, He met with a great Mortifi∣cation;
some Months after He was married, He went with his Wife to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>wait upon his Father and Mother at his House at <HI>Pirton,</HI> to make them
Sharers in that Satisfaction which They had so long desired to see, and in
which They took great Delight.</P>
<P>HIS Father had long suffered under an Indisposition (even before the
Time his Son could remember) which gave him rather frequent Pains, than
Sickness; and gave him Cause to be terrified with the Expectation of the
Stone, without being exercised with the present Sense of it; but from the
Time He was sixty Years of Age, it increased very much, and four or
five Years before his Death, with Circumstances scarce heard of before,
and the Causes whereof are not yet understood by any Physician; He
<MILESTONE N="20"/>was very often, both in the Day and the Night, forced to make Water,
seldom in any Quantity, because He could not retain it long enough, and
in the Close of that Work, without any sharp Pain in those Parts, He
was still and constantly seized on by so sharp a Pain in the left Arm, for
Half a Quarter of an Hour, or near so much, that the Torment made
him as pale (whereas He was otherwise of a very sanguine Complexion) as
if He were dead; and He used to say, “that He had passed the Pangs of
Death, and He should die in one of those Fits”; as soon as it was over,
which was quickly, He was the chearfullest Man living; eat well such
Things as He could fancy, walked, slept, digested, conversed with such
<MILESTONE N="30"/>a Promptness and Vivacity upon all Arguments (for He was <HI>omnifariam
doctus,</HI>) as hath been seldom known in a Man of his Age: But He had the
Image of Death so constantly before him in those continual Torments, that
for many Years before his Death, He always parted with his Son, as to
see him no more; and at Parting still shewed him his Will, discoursing
very particularly and very chearfully of all Things He would have per∣formed
after his Death.</P>
<P>HE had for some Time before resolved to leave the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Father's Removal to</HI> Salisbury.</NOTE> and to
spend the Remainder of his Time in <HI>Salisbury,</HI> where He had caused a
House to be provided for him, both for the Neighbourhood of the Ca∣thedral
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Church, where He could perform his Devotions every Day, and
for the Conversation of many of his Family who lived there, and not
far from it; and especially that He might be buried there, where many
of his Family and Friends lay; and He obliged his Son to accompany him
thither before his Return to <HI>London;</HI> and He came to <HI>Salisbury</HI> on the
<HI>Friday</HI> before <HI>Michaelmass</HI> Day in the Year 1632, and lodged in his own
House that Night; the next Day He was so wholly taken up in receiving
Visits from his many Friends, being a Person wonderfully reverenced in
those Parts, that He walked very little out of his House. The next
Morning, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> He rose very early, and went to two or three
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Churches, and when He returned, which was by eight of the Clock, He
told his Wife and his Son, “that He had been to look out a Place to be
buried in, but found none against which He had not some Exception,
the Cathedral only excepted, where He had made Choice of a Place
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
near a Kinsman of his own Name, and had shewed it to the Sexton, whom
He had sent for to that Purpose; and wished them to see him buried
there;” and this with as much Compofedness of Mind as if it had made
no Impression on him; then went to the Cathedral to Sermon, and spent
the whole Day in as chearful Conversation with his Friends (saving only
the frequent Interruptions his Infirmity gave him once in two or three
Hours, sometimes more, sometimes less) as the Man in the most confirmed
Health could do. <HI>Monday</HI> was <HI>Michaelmass</HI> Day, when in the Morning
He went to visit his Brother Sir <HI>Laurence Hyde,</HI> who was then making a
Journey in the Service of the King, and from him went to the Church<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to a Sermon, where He found himself a little pressed as He used to be,
and therefore thought fit to make what Haste He could to his House, and
was no sooner come thither into a lower Room, than having made Water,
and the Pain in his Arm seizing upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Death.</NOTE> He fell down dead, without
the least Motion of any Limb: The Suddenness of it made it apprehended
to be an Apoplexy, but there being nothing like Convulsions, or the least
Distortion or Alteration in the Visage, it is not like to be from that Cause,
nor could the Physicians make any reasonable Guess from whence that
mortal Blow proceeded. He wanted about six Weeks of attaining the
Age of seventy, and was the greatest Instance of the Felicity of a Coun∣try<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Life that was seen in that Age; having enjoyed a competent, and to
him a plentiful Fortune, a very great Reputation of Piety and Virtue, and
his Death being attended with universal Lamentation. It cannot be ex∣pressed
with what Agony his Son bore this Loss, having as He was used
to say, “not only lost the best Father, but the best Friend and the best
Companion He ever had or could have;” and He was never so well
pleased, as when He had fit Occasions given him to mention his Father,
whom He did in Truth believe to be the wisest Man He had ever known,
and He was often heard to say, in the Time when his Condition was at
highest, “that though God Almighty had been very propitious to him, in<MILESTONE N="30"/>
raising him to great Honours and Preferments, He did not value any
Honour He had so much, as the being the Son of such a Father and
Mother, for whose Sakes principally He thought God had conferred those
Blessings upon him.”</P>
<P>THERE fell out at this Time or thereabouts, a great Alteration in the
Court and State, by the Death of the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> Lord High Trea∣surer
of <HI>England.</HI> The King from the Death of the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI>
had not only been very reserved in his Bounty, but so frugal in his
own Expense, that He had retrenched much of what had formerly issued
out for his Houshold, insomuch as every Year somewhat had been paid of<MILESTONE N="40"/>
his Debts. He resolved now to govern his Treasury by Commission, and
to take a constant Account of it; and thereby to discover what had been
of late done amiss:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trea∣surer's Office given to Com∣missioners.</NOTE> The Commissioners He appointed were, the Lord
Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> Dr. <HI>Laud,</HI> (formerly Bishop of <HI>London</HI>) the
Lord Keeper <HI>Coventry,</HI> and other principal Officers of State, who together
with the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> (who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and by
his Office of the Quorum in that Commission) were to supply the Office
of Treasurer in all Particulars. The Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who till
now had only intended the good Government of the Church, without in∣termeddling
in secular Affairs, otherwise than when the Discipline of the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Church was concerned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of whom Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> is one.</NOTE> in which He was very strict, both in the high
Commission, and in all other Places, where He sat as a privy Counsellor,
well foreseeing, as He made manifest upon several Occasions, the Growth
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
of the <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> and that if They were not with Rigour suppressed,
They would put the whole Kingdom into a Flame, which shortly after
fell out to be too confessed a Truth; though for the present his Providence
only served to increase the Number of his Enemies, who had from that
his Zeal contracted all the Malice against him that can be imagined, and
which He, out of the Conscience of his Duty, and the Purity of his In∣tentions,
and his Knowledge of the King's full Approbation of his Vigi∣lance
and Ardour, too much undervalued; I say, as soon as He was made
Commissioner of the Treasury, He thought himself obliged to take all the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Pains He could to understand that Employment, and the Nature of the
Revenue, and to find out all possible Ways for the Improvement thereof,
and for the present Managery of the Expense. Many were of Opinion
that He was the more solicitous in that Disquisition, and the more in∣quisitive
into what had been done, that He might make some Disco∣very
of past Actions, which might reflect upon the Memory of the
late Treasurer, the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and call his Wisdom and In∣tegrity
in Question, who had been so far from being his Friend, That
He had always laboured to do him all the Mischief He could, and
it was no small Grief of Heart to him, and much Occasion of his ill
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Humour, to find that the Archbishop had too much Credit with the King,
to be shaken by him; and the Archbishop was not in his Affections be∣hind
hand with him, looking always upon him as a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI>
though He dissembled it by going to Church; and as the great Counte∣nancer
and Support of that Religion; all his Family being of that Pro∣fession,
and very few resorting to it, or having any Credit with him but
such: It is very true, the Archbishop had no great Regard for his Me∣mory,
or for his Friends, and was willing enough to make any Discovery
of his Miscarriages, and to inform his Majesty of them, who He believed
had too good an Opinion of him and his Integrity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE Truth is, the Archbishop had laid down one Principle to himself,
which He believed would much advance the King's Service, and was with∣out
Doubt very prudent; that the King's Duties being provided for, and
chearfully paid, the Merchants should receive all the Countenance and
Protection from the King that They could expect; and not be liable to
the Vexation particular Men gave them for their private Advantage; being
forward enough to receive Propositions which tended to the King's Profit,
but careful that what accrued of Burthen to the Subject, should redound
entirely to the Benefit of the Crown, and not enrich Projectors at the
Charge of the People; and there is Reason to believe that if this Measure
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had been well observed, much of that Murmur had been prevented, which
contributed to that Jealousy and Discontent which soon after brake out.
This Vigilance and Inclination in the Archbishop, opened a Door to the
Admission of any Merchants or others to him, who gave him Information
of this Kind; and who being ready to pay any Thing to the King, de∣sired
only to be protected from private Oppressions. The Archbishop used
to spend as much Time as He could get, at his Country House at <HI>Croydon,</HI>
and then his Mind being unbent from Business, He delighted in the Con∣versation
of his Neighbours, and treated them with great Urbanity.</P>
<P>THERE was a Merchant of the greatest Reputation, <HI>(Daniel Harvey)</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>who having a Country House within the Distance of a few Miles from <HI>Croy∣don,</HI>
and understanding the whole Business of Trade more exactly than most
Men, was always very welcome to the Archbishop, who used to ask him
many Questions upon such Matters as He desired to be informed in; and
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
received much Satisfaction from him. Upon an Accidental Discourse be∣tween
them, what Encouragement Merchants ought to receive, who
brought a great Trade into the Kingdom, and paid thereupon great Sums
of Money to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI>'s Complaint to the Archbishop of the Earl of <HI>Portland.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> mentioned the Discouragements They
had received in the late Times, by the Rigour of the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> in
Matters that related nothing to the King's Service, but to the Profit of
private Men; and thereupon remembered a Particular, that, after the Dis∣solution
of the Parliament in the fourth Year of the King, and the Com∣bination
amongst many Merchants to pay no more Customs or Imposi∣tions
to the King, because They had not been granted in Parliament,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which produced those Suits and Decrees in the Exchequer, which are ge∣nerally
understood, and a general Distraction in Trade; many Merchants
of the greatest Wealth and Reputation resolved to continue the Trade;
and in a short Time reduced it into so good Order, and by their Advice
and Example disposed others to make a punctual Entry of their Goods,
and to pay their Duties to the King, that the Trade seemed to be restored
to the Nation, and the Customs to rise above the Value They had ever
yielded to the Crown; which was no sooner brought to pass, than the Earl
of <HI>Portland</HI> (who endeavoured to persuade the King that this great Work
was entirely compassed by his Wisdom, Interest, and Dexterity) disobliged<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the Merchants in a very sensible Degree, in requiring them to unlade their
Ships at the Custom-House Quay, and at no other Quay or Wharf, upon
Pretence that thereby the King would have his Customs well paid, of
which otherwise He would be in Danger to be cozened; and alledged an
Order that had been formerly made in the Court of the Exchequer,
that fine Goods which were portable (as Silks and fine Linens) and might
easily be stolen, should always be landed at the Custom-House Quay: The
Merchants looked upon this Constraint and Restraint, as a great Oppres∣sion,
and applied themselves to him for Reparation and Redress; They
undertook to make it evident to him, that it was merely a Matter which<MILESTONE N="30"/>
concerned the private Benefit of the particular Wharfingers, and not in
the least Degree the King's Profit; that the Custom House Quay was of
great Value to the Owner of it, who had a very great Rent for it, but
that it yielded the King nothing, nor would in fifty Years or thereabouts,
there being a Lease yet to come for that Term; that the Mention of fine
Goods, and the Order of the Exchequer, was not applicable to the Ques∣tion;
that They disputed not the Landing of fine Goods, but that the
Pretence was to compel them to bring their grossest, and their Merchandize
of the greatest Bulk to that Quay, whereas They had been always free
to ship or unship such Goods at what Wharf They would chufe for their<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Conveniences; there being the sworn Waiters of the Custom House at∣tending
in the one, as well as the other; that the restraining them to one
Wharf, and obliging all the Ships to be brought thither, must prove much
to their Prejudice, and make them depend upon the good Will of the
Wharfinger for their Dispatch, who in Truth, let his Desire be never so
good, could not be able to perform the Service, without obliging them to
wait very long, and thereby to lose their Markets: All this Discourse how
reasonable soever, made no Impression upon the Treasurer, but He dis∣missed
them with his usual Roughness, and reproached them that They
desired all Occasions to cozen the King of his Customs; which They<MILESTONE N="50"/>
looked upon as an ill Reward for the Service They had done, and a great
Discouragement to Trade. The Archbishop heard this Discourse with great
Trouble and Indignation, and being then interrupted by the Coming of

Persons of Quality, told him, He would some other Time run over all
these Particulars again, and that He should recollect himself for other In∣stances
of that strange Nature.</P>
<P>THE next Time the Archbishop returned to <HI>Croydon,</HI> which He usually
did once in the Week during the Summer, and staid a Day or two, impa∣tient
to understand more of the Matter, He sent for Mr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> and told
him, “that his last Discourse had given him much Cause of Sorrow, in
finding how the King had been used, and that He knew his Nature so
well, that He could confidently say, that He never knew of that Kind
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of Proceeding, and that He wondered that the Merchants had not then
petitioned the King, to hear the Matter himself;” He answered, “that
They had left no Way unattempted for their Ease, having no Fear of
displeasing the Treasurer; that They had caused a Petition to be drawn
by their Council, which was signed by all the principal Merchants in
the City, wherein (to obviate the Calumny concerning refusing to pay,
or stealing Customs) They declared, that They were all very willing to
pay all Duties to his Majesty, and would never refuse the same, (which
was a Declaration, would have been much valued a Year or two before,
and ought to have been so then) only desired to be left at Liberty to ship
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and land their Goods as They had been accustomed to; that They had
given this Petition to a Secretary of State to present it to the King, who
referred it to the Consideration of the Treasurer; and thereupon They
pursued it no further, knowing how He stood resolved, and the Cause
of it, which troubled them most, <HI>viz.</HI> that that Custom House Quay
did, though not in his own Name, in Truth belong to Sir <HI>Abraham
Dawes,</HI> one of the Farmers of the Customs, and the only Favourite of
the Lord Treasurer, all the other Farmers being offended with the Or∣der,
which They saw would offend the Merchants:” The Archbishop
asked “where that Petition was, that He thought it still of that Moment,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>that He would be glad to see it:” He answered, “He knew not where
it was; but He believed it to remain in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> who
had drawn it, and was of Council with the Merchants throughout the
whole Proceedings; and was so warm in it, that He had exceedingly
provoked the Lord Treasurer, who would have ruined him if He could:”
He asked who that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was, and where He was; the other said,
He was a young Lawyer of the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Harvey <HI>mentions Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>to the Archbishop.</HI></NOTE> who was not afraid of
being of Council with them, when all Men of Name durst not appear
for them; and that He was confident that He, having been always pre∣sent
at all Debates, remembered many Circumstances in the Business
<MILESTONE N="40"/>which the other had forgotten; that He was generally known; and had
lately married the Daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Aylesbury.</HI>”</P>
<P>WITHIN a few Days after, the Archbishop meeting Sir <HI>Thomas Ayles∣bury</HI>
at Court, asked him whether He had married his Daughter to one
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> a Lawyer, and where He was; He answered, He had done so,
and that He lived in his House, when He was not at his Chamber in the
<HI>Middle Temple:</HI> The Archbishop desired him to send him to Him, for He
heard well of him;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>at∣tends the Archbishop.</HI></NOTE> and the next Morning He attended him, and found
him walking alone in his Garden at <HI>Lambeth;</HI> He received him civilly ac∣cording
to his Manner, without much Ceremony; and presently asked
<MILESTONE N="50"/>him, whether He had not been of Council with some Merchants in such
a Business, and where that Petition now was; He answered him, not
knowing why He asked, “that He had been about two Years past, of
“Council with some Merchants about such an Affair, in which the Earl
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
of <HI>Portland</HI> had been much incensed against him, that He remembered
He had drawn such a Petition, which was signed by all the considerable
Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> but that there was little Progress made thereupon,
by Reason of the Asperity of the Treasurer:” He asked still for the
Petition that was so signed; He told him, He thought He had it himself,
if He had it not, He was confident He could find who had it: He de∣sired
him, that He would find it out, and bring it to Him, and any other
Papers concerning that Affair, or the Business of the Customs: He said,
“the King had, contrary to his Desire, made him one of the Commis∣sioners
of the Treasury; that He understood nothing of that Province,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
but was willing to take any Pains which might enable him to do his
Master Service, which made him inquisitive into the Customs, the prin∣cipal
Branch of the Revenue; that his Neighbour <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> had
spoken much Good of him to Him; and informed him of that Com∣plaint
of the Merchants, which He thought had much Reason in it, but
it was like other Acts of the Earl of <HI>Portland;</HI> that He would be wil∣ling
to receive any Information from him, and that He should be wel∣come
when He came to him.” He told him, in short (which He heard
would please him best) two or three Passages that happened in that Transaction;
and some haughty Expressions which fell from the Treasurer, when<MILESTONE N="20"/>
upon his urging that the Farmers would not hold their Farm, if He did
not strictly hold the Merchants to Custom House Quay; He told him,
“that if the Farmers were weary of their Bargain, He would help
the King to forty thousand Pounds a Year above the Rent They paid,
and that They should be paid all the Money They had advanced within
one Week;” upon which the Earl indeed had let himself out into an
indecent Rage, using many Threats to him; which He found was not in∣grateful
to the Archbishop, upon whom He attended within a Day or two
again, and delivered him the Petition, and many other useful Papers,
which pleased him abundantly; and He required him to see Him often.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>By this Accident Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> came first to be known to the Archbishop,
who ever afterwards used him very kindly, and spoke well of him upon
all Occasions, and took particular Notice of him when He came of Coun∣cil
in any Causes depending at the Council Board, as He did frequently;
and desired his Service in many Occasions, and particularly in the raising
Monies for the building St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Church, in which He made a Journey
or two into <HI>Wiltshire</HI> with good Success; which the Archbishop still ac∣knowledged,
in a more obliging Way than He was accustomed to; inso∣much
as it was so much taken notice of, that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (who well knew
how to cultivate those Advantages) was used with more Countenance by<MILESTONE N="40"/>
all the Judges in <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>re∣ceives Encou∣ragement in his Profession.</HI></NOTE> and the eminent Practisers, than was
usually given to Men of his Years; so that He grew every Day in Prac∣tice,
of which He had as much as He desired, and having a competent
Estate of his own, He enjoyed a very pleasant and a plentiful Life, living
much above the Rank of those Lawyers, whose Business was only to be
rich; and was generally beloved and esteemed by most Persons of Condi∣tion
and great Reputation. Though He pursued his Profession with great
Diligence and Intentness of Mind, and upon the Matter wholly betook
himself to Business, yet He made not himself a Slave to it; but kept both
his Friends at Court, and about the Town, by his frequent Application and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
constant Conversation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Method of spending his Time.</NOTE> in Order to which, He always gave himself at
Dinner to those who used to meet together at that Hour, and in such
Places as was mutually agreed between them; where They enjoyed them∣selves
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
with great Delight, and publick Reputation, for the Innocence, and
Sharpness, and Learning of their Conversation: For He would never suffer
himself to be deprived of some Hours (which commonly He borrowed
from the Night) to refresh himself with polite Learning, in which He still
made some Progress: The Afternoons He entirely dedicated to the Bu∣siness
of his Profession, taking Instructions and the like; and very rarely
supped, except He was called out by some of his Friends, who spared him
the more, because He always complied with those Summons; otherwise
He never supped, for many Years (before the Troubles brought in that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Custom) both for the gaining that Time for himself, and that He might
rise early in the Morning according to his Custom, and which He would
say, He could never do when He supped. The Vacations He gave wholly
to his Study and Conversation, never going out of <HI>London</HI> in those Seasons,
except for two Months in the Summer, which He spent at his own House
in the Country, with great Chearfulness amongst his Friends, who then
resorted to him in good Numbers.</P>
<P>HE never did ride any Country Circuits with the Judges, which He
often repented afterwards, saying, that besides the knowing the Gentry,
and People, and Manners of <HI>England</HI> (which is best attained that Way)
<MILESTONE N="20"/>there is a very good and necessary Part of the Learning in the Law, which
is not so easily got any other Way, as in riding those Circuits, which as it
seems to have much of Drudgery, so is accompanied with much Pleasure
and Profit; and it may be, the long Lives of Men of that Profession (for
the Lawyers usually live to more Years than any other Profession) may
very reasonably be imputed to the Exercise They give themselves by their
Circuits, as well as to their other Acts of Temperance and Sobriety: And
as He had denied himself that Satisfaction purely to have that Time to
himself for other Delight, so He did resolve, if the Confusion of the
Time had not surprized him, for three or four Years, (longer He did not
<MILESTONE N="30"/>intend) to have improved himself by the Experience of those Journies.</P>
<P>HE was often heard to say, that, “next the immediate Blessing and
Providence of God Almighty, which had preserved him throughout the
whole Course of his Life (less strict than it ought to have been) from
many Dangers and Disadvantages, in which many other young Men
were lost; He owed all the little He knew, and the little Good that
was in him, to the Friendships and Conversation He had still been used
to, of the most excellent Men in their several Kinds that lived in that
Age; by whose Learning, and Information, and Instruction, He formed
his Studies, and mended his Understanding; and by whose Gentleness
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and Sweetness of Behaviour, and Justice, and Virtue, and Example, He
formed his Manners, subdued that Pride, and suppressed that Heat
and Passion, He was naturally inclined to be transported with.” And
He never took more Pleasure in any Thing, than in frequently men∣tioning
and naming those Persons, who were then his Friends, or of his
most familiar Conversation; and in remembring their particular Virtues
and Faculties; and used often to say, “that He never was so proud, or
thought himself so good a Man, as when He was the worst Man in the
Company;” all his Friends and Companions being in their Quality, in
their Fortunes, at least in their Faculties and Endowments of Mind, very
<MILESTONE N="50"/>much his Superiors; and He always charged his Children to follow his Example
in that Point, in making their Friendships and Conversation; pro∣testing,
that in the whole Course of his Life, He never knew one Man, of
what Condition soever, arrive to any Degree of Reputation in the World,
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
who made choice or delighted in the Company or Conversation of those,
who in their Qualities were inferior, or in their Parts not much superior
to himself.</P>
<P>WHILST He was only a Student of the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Account of his chief Acquaintance whilst only a Student of the Law.</NOTE> and stood at Gaze, and
irresolute what Course of Life to take, his chief Acquaintance were <HI>Ben.
Johnson, John Selden, Charles Cotton, John Vaughan,</HI> Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby,
Thomas May,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Carew,</HI> and some others of eminent Faculties
in their several Ways. <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI>'s Name can never be forgotten,
having by his very good Learning, and the Severity of his Nature and
Manners, very much reformed the Stage; and indeed the <HI>English</HI> Poetry<MILESTONE N="10"/>
itself:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of</HI> Ben Johnson.</NOTE> His natural Advantages were, Judgment to order and govern Fancy,
rather than Excess of Fancy, his Productions being slow and upon Deli∣beration,
yet then abounding with great Wit and Fancy, and will live ac∣cordingly;
and surely as He did exceedingly exalt the <HI>English</HI> Language in
Eloquence, Propriety, and masculine Expressions; so He was the best Judge
of, and fittest to prescribe Rules to Poetry and Poets, of any Man who had
lived with, or before him, or since: If Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> had not made a Flight be∣yond
all Men, with that Modesty yet, to ascribe much of this, to the Ex∣ample
and Learning of <HI>Ben. Johnson.</HI> His Conversation was very good,
and with the Men of most Note; and He had for many Years an extra∣ordinary<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Kindness for Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> till He found He betook himself to Bu∣siness,
which He believed ought never to be preferred before his Com∣pany:
He lived to be very old, and till the Palsy made a deep Impression
upon his Body, and his Mind.</P>
<P>Mr. SELDEN was a Person,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Sel∣den.</NOTE> whom no Character can flatter, or transmit
in any Expressions equal to his Merit and Virtue; He was of so stupendous
Learning in all Kinds, and in all Languages (as may appear in his excellent
and transcendent Writings) that a Man would have thought He had been
entirely conversant amongst Books, and had never spent an Hour but in
Reading and Writing; yet his Humanity, Courtesy, and Affability was<MILESTONE N="30"/>
such, that He would have been thought to have been bred in the best Courts,
but that his good Nature, Charity, and Delight in doing good, and in
communicating all He knew, exceeded that Breeding: His Stile in all his
Writings seems harsh and sometimes obscure; which is not wholly to be
imputed to the abstruse Subjects of which He commonly treated, out of
the Paths trod by other Men; but to a little undervaluing the Beauty of
a Stile, and too much Propensity to the Language of Antiquity; but in
his Conversation He was the most clear Discourser, and had the best Fa∣culty
in making hard Things easy, and presenting them to the Under∣standing,
of any Man that hath been known. Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was wont to say,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that He valued himself upon nothing more than upon having had Mr.
<HI>Selden's</HI> Acquaintance from the Time He was very young; and held it with
great Delight as long as They were suffered to continue together in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
and He was very much troubled always when He heard him blamed,
censured, and reproached, for staying in <HI>London,</HI> and in the Parliament, after
They were in Rebellion, and in the worst Times, which his Age obliged
him to do; and how wicked soever the Actions were, which were every
Day done, He was confident He had not given his Consent to them; but
would have hindered them if He could, with his own Safety, to which
He was always enough indulgent. If He had some Infirmities with other<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Men, They were weighed down with wonderful and prodigious Abilities
and Excellencies in the other Scale.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"/>
CHARLES COTTON was a Gentleman born to a competent Fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Cot∣ton.</NOTE> and
so qualified in his Person, and Education, that for many Years He conti∣nued
the greatest Ornament of the Town, in the Esteem of those who
had been best bred: His natural Parts were very great, his Wit flowing in
all the Parts of Conversation; the Superstructure of Learning not raised
to a considerable Height, but having passed some Years in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and
then in <HI>France,</HI> and conversing always with learned Men, his Expressions
were ever proper, and significant, and gave great Lustre to his Discourse,
upon any Argument; so that He was thought by those who were not intimate
<MILESTONE N="10"/>with him, to have been much better acquainted with Books than He was.
He had all those Qualities which in Youth raise Men to the Reputation of
being fine Gentlemen; such a Pleasantness and Gaiety of Humour, such
a Sweetness and Gentleness of Nature, and such a Civility and Delight∣fulness
in Conversation, that no Man in the Court, or out of it, appeared
a more accomplished Person; all these extraordinary Qualifications being
supported by as extraordinary a Clearness of Courage, and Fearlessness of
Spirit, of which He gave too often Manifestation. Some unhappy Suits
in Law, and Waste of his Fortune in those Suits, made some Impression
upon his Mind; which being improved by domestick Afflictions, and those
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Indulgences to himself, which naturally attend those Afflictions, rendered
his Age less reverenced, than his Youth had been; and gave his best Friends
Cause to have wished, that He had not lived so long.</P>
<P>JOHN VAUGHAN was then a Student of the Law in the <HI>Inner Temple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Vaughan.</NOTE>
but at that Time indulged more to the politer Learning; and was in
Truth a Man of great Parts of Nature, and very well adorned by Arts
and Books; and so much cherished by Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI> that He grew to be of
entire Trust and Friendship with him, and to that owed the best Part of
his Reputation; for He was of so magisterial and supercilious a Humour,
so proud and insolent a Behaviour, that all Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>'s Instructions, and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Authority, and Example, could not file off that Roughness of his Na∣ture,
so as to make him very grateful. He looked most into those Parts
of the Law, which disposed him to least Reverence to the Crown, and
most, to popular Authority; yet without Inclination to any Change in Go∣vernment;
and therefore, before the Beginning of the Civil War, and when
He clearly discerned the Approaches to it in Parliament (of which He was
a Member) He withdrew himself into the Fastnesses of his own Country,
<HI>North Wales,</HI> where He enjoyed a secure, and as near an innocent Life,
as the Iniquity of that Time would permit; and upon the Return of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, He appeared under the Character of a Man,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>who had preserved his Loyalty entire, and was esteemed accordingly by all
that Party.</P>
<P>HIS Friend Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> who was then become Lord High Chancellor of
<HI>England,</HI> renewed his old Kindness and Friendship towards him, and was
desirous to gratify him all the Ways He could, and earnestly pressed him
to put on his Gown again, and take upon him the Office of a Judge;
but He excused himself upon his long Discontinuance (having not worn his
Gown, and wholly discontinued the Profession from the Year 1640, full
twenty Years) and upon his Age, and expressly refused to receive any Pro∣motion;
but continued all the Professions of Respect and Gratitude ima∣ginable
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to the Chancellor, till it was in his Power to manifest the con∣trary,
to his Prejudice, which He did with Circumstances very uncom∣mendable.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25"/>
SIR <HI>Kenelm Digby</HI> was a Person very eminent and notorious throughout
the whole Course of his Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Ke∣nelm Digby.</NOTE> from his Cradle to his Grave; of an ancient
Family and noble Extraction; and inherited a fair and plentiful Fortune,
notwithstanding the Attainder of his Father. He was a Man of a very
extraordinary Person and Presence, which drew the Eyes of all Men upon
him, which were more fixed by a wonderful graceful Behaviour, a flow∣ing
Courtesy and Civility, and such a Volubility of Language, as sur∣prized,
and delighted; and though in another Man it might have appeared
to have somewhat of Affectation, it was marvellous graceful in him, and
seemed natural to his Size, and Mould of his Person, to the Gravity of his<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Motion, and the Tune of his Voice and Delivery. He had a fair Repu∣tation
in Arms, of which He gave an early Testimony in his Youth, in
some Encounters in <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and afterwards in an Action in the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, where He had the Command of a Squadron of Ships
of War, set out at his own Charge under the King's Commission; with
which, upon an Injury received, or apprehended from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> He
encountered their whole Fleet, killed many of their Men, and sunk one
of their Galeasses; which in that drowsy and unactive Time, was looked
upon with a general Estimation, though the Crown disavowed it. In a
Word, He had all the Advantages that Nature, and Art, and an excellent<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Education could give him, which, with a great Confidence and Presentness
of Mind, buoyed him up against all those Prejudices, and Disadvantages,
(as the Attainder, and Execution of his Father, for a Crime of the highest
Nature; his own Marriage with a Lady, though of an extraordinary Beauty,
of as extraordinary a Fame; his changing, and re-changing his Religion;
and some personal Vices, and Licences in his Life) which would have sup∣pressed
and sunk any other Man, but never clouded or eclipsed him, from
appearing in the best Places, and the best Company, and with the best
Estimation and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>THOMAS MAY was the eldest Son of his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> May.</NOTE> a Knight, and born<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to a Fortune, if his Father had not spent it; so that He had only an An∣nuity
left him, not proportionable to a liberal Education; yet since his
Fortune could not raise his Mind, He brought his Mind down to his For∣tune,
by a great Modesty and Humility in his Nature, which was not af∣fected,
but very well became an Imperfection in his Speech, which was a
great Mortification to him, and kept him from entering upon any Dis∣course
but in the Company of his very Friends. His Parts of Nature,
and Art were very good, as appears by his Translation of <HI>Lucan</HI> (none of
the easiest Work of that Kind) and more by his Supplement to <HI>Lucan,</HI>
which being entirely his own, for the Learning, the Wit, and the Lan∣guage,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
may be well looked upon as one of the best Epic Poems in the
<HI>English</HI> Language; He writ some other commendable Pieces, of the Reign
of some of our Kings; He was cherished by many Persons of Honour,
and very acceptable in all Places; yet (to shew that Pride and Envy have
their Influences upon the narrowest Minds, and which have the greatest
Semblance of Humility) though He had received much Countenance, and
a very considerable Donative from the King; upon his Majesty's refusing
to give him a small Pension, which He had designed and promised to ano∣ther
very ingenious Person, whose Qualities He thought inferior to his
own, He fell from his Duty, and all his former Friends; and prostituted<MILESTONE N="50"/>
himself to the vile Office of celebrating the infamous Acts of those who
were in Rebellion against the King; which He did so meanly, that He
seemed to all Men to have lost his Wits, when He left his Honesty; and
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
so shortly after, died miserable and neglected; and deserves to be for∣gotten.</P>
<P>THOMAS CAREW was a younger Brother of a good Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Mr. Ca∣rew.</NOTE> and of ex∣cellent
Parts, and had spent many Years of his Youth in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI>
and returning from Travel, followed the Court; which the Modesty of
that Time disposed Men to do some Time, before They pretended to be of
it; and He was very much esteemed by the most eminent Persons in the
Court, and well looked upon by the King himself, some Years, before He
could obtain to be Sewer to the King; and when the King conferred that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Place upon him, it was not without the Regret even of the whole <HI>Scotch</HI>
Nation, which united themselves in recommending another Gentleman to
it; of so great Value were those Relations held in that Age, when Ma∣jesty
was beheld with the Reverence it ought to be. He was a Person
of a pleasant and facetious Wit, and made many Poems (especially in
the amorous Way) which for the Sharpness of the Fancy, and the Ele∣gancy
of the Language, in which that Fancy was spread, were at least
equal, if not superior to any of that Time: But his Glory was, that
after fifty Years of his Life, spent with less Severity or Exactness than it
ought to have been, He died with the greatest Remorse for that Licence,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and with the greatest Manifestation of Christianity, that his best Friends
could desire.</P>
<P>AMONG these Persons Mr. <HI>Hyde's</HI> usual Time of Conversation was spent,
till He grew more retired to his more serious Studies, and never discon∣tinued
his Acquaintance with any of them, though He spent less Time
in their Company; only upon Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> He looked with so much Af∣fection,
and Reverence, that He always thought himself best, when He
was with him; but He had then another Conjunction and Communica∣tion,
that He took so much Delight in, that He embraced it in the
Time of his greatest Business and Practice, and would suffer no other
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Pretence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Characters of Mr.</HI> Hyde's <HI>more intimate Friends.</HI></NOTE> or Obligation to withdraw him from that Familiarity and Friend∣ship;
and took frequent Occasions to mention their Names with great
Pleasure; being often heard to say, “that if He had any Thing good
in him, in his Humour, or in his Manners, He owed it to the Example,
and the Information He had received in, and from that Company, with
most of whom He had an entire Friendship:” And They were in Truth,
in their several Qualifications, Men of more than ordinary Eminence, be∣fore
They attained the great Preferments many of them lived to enjoy:
The Persons were, Sir <HI>Lucius Carey,</HI> eldest Son to the Lord Viscount
<HI>Falkland,</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland;</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Wenman</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Sidney Godolphin</HI> of <HI>Godolphin</HI> in <HI>Cornwall; Edmund Waller</HI> of <HI>Becconsfield;</HI>
Dr. <HI>Gilbert Sheldon;</HI> Dr. <HI>George Morley;</HI> Dr. <HI>John Earles;</HI> Mr. <HI>John
Hales</HI> of <HI>Eton;</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Chillingworth.</HI></P>
<P>WITH Sir <HI>Lucius Carey</HI> He had a most entire Friendship without Re∣serve,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Lucius Carey.</NOTE>
from his Age of twenty Years, to the Hour of his Death, near
twenty Years after; upon which there will be Occasion to enlarge when
We come to speak of that Time, and often before, and therefore we shall
say no more of him in this Place, than to shew his Condition, and Qualifi∣cations,
which were the first Ingredients into that Friendship; which was
afterwards cultivated, and improved by a constant Conversation and Fami∣liarity,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and by many Accidents which contributed thereto. He had the
Advantage of a noble Extraction, and of being born his Father's eldest Son,
when there was a greater Fortune in Prospect to be inherited (besides what
He might reasonably expect by his Mother) than came afterwards to his
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
Possession. His Education was equal to his Birth, at least in the Care, if
not in the Climate; for his Father being Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> before He
was of Age fit to be sent abroad, his Breeding was in the Court, and in
the University of <HI>Dublin;</HI> but under the Care, Vigilance, and Direction
of such Governors and Tutors, that He learned all those Exercises and Lan∣guages,
better than most Men do in more celebrated Places; insomuch as
when He came into <HI>England,</HI> which was when He was about the Age of
eighteen Years, He was not only Master of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and had
read all the Poets, and other of the best Authors with notable Judgment
for that Age, but He understood, and spake, and writ <HI>French,</HI> as if He<MILESTONE N="10"/>
had spent many Years in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>HE had another Advantage, which was a great Ornament to the rest,
that was, a good, a plentiful Estate, of which He had the early Possession.
His Mother was the sole Daughter and Heir of the Lord Chief Baron <HI>Tan∣field,</HI>
who having given a fair Portion with his Daughter in Marriage, had
kept himself free to dispose of his Land, and his other Estate, in such
Manner as He should think fit; and He settled it in such Manner upon
his Grandson Sir <HI>Lucius Carey,</HI> without taking Notice of his Father, or
Mother, that upon his Grandmother's Death, which fell out about the
Time that He was nineteen Years of Age, all the Land, with two very<MILESTONE N="20"/>
good Houses very well furnished (worth above £2000 <HI>per Annum</HI>) in a
most pleasant Country, and the two most pleasant Places in that Country,
with a very plentiful personal Estate, fell into his Hands and Possession,
and to his entire Disposal.</P>
<P>WITH these Advantages, He had one great Disadvantage (which in the
first Entrance into the World is attended with too much Prejudice) in his
Person and Presence, which was in no Degree attractive or promising:
His Stature was low, and smaller than most Men; his Motion not grace∣ful;
and his Aspect so far from inviting, that it had somewhat in it of Simplicity;
and his Voice the worst of the three, and so untuned, that in∣stead<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of reconciling, it offended the Ear, so that no Body would have ex∣pected
Musick from that Tongue; and sure no Man was less beholdèn to
Nature for its Recommendation into the World; but then no Man sooner,
or more disappointed this general and customary Prejudice; that little
Person and small Stature was quickly found to contain a great Heart, a
Courage so keen, and a Nature so fearless, that no Composition of the
strongest Limbs, and most harmonious and proportioned Presence and
Strength, ever more disposed any Man to the greatest Enterprize; it being
his greatest Weakness to be too solicitous for such Adventures; and that
untuned Tongue and Voice, easily discovered itself to be supplied, and go∣verned,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
by a Mind and Understanding so excellent, that the Wit and
Weight of all He said, carried another Kind of Lustre, and Admiration in
it, and even another Kind of Acceptation from the Persons present, than
any Ornament of Delivery could reasonably promise itself, or is usually at∣tended
with; and his Disposition and Nature was so gentle and obliging,
so much delighted in Courtesy, Kindness, and Generosity, that all Mankind
could not but admire, and love him.</P>
<P>IN a short Time after He had Possession of the Estate his Grandfather
had left him, and before He was of Age, He committed a Fault against
his Father, in marrying a young Lady, whom He passionately loved, without<MILESTONE N="50"/>
any considerable Portion, which exceedingly offended him; and disappointed
all his reasonable Hopes and Expectation, of redeeming and repairing
his own broken Fortune, and desperate Hopes in Court, by some
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
advantageous Marriage of his Son; about which He had then some pro∣bable
Treaty. Sir <HI>Lucius Carey</HI> was very conscious to himself of his
Offence and Transgression, and the Consequence of it, which though
He could not repent, having married a Lady of a most extraordinary
Wit, and Judgment, and of the most signal Virtue, and exemplary Life,
that the Age produced, and who brought him many hopeful Children,
in which He took great Delight; yet He confessed it, with the most sin∣cere
and dutiful Applications to his Father for his Pardon, that could be
made; and for the Prejudice He had brought upon his Fortune, by bring∣ing
<MILESTONE N="10"/>no Portion to him, He offered to repair it, by resigning his whole
Estate to his Disposal, and to rely wholly upon his Kindness for his
own Maintenance and Support; and to that Purpose, He had caused
Conveyances to be drawn by Council, which He brought ready engrossed
to his Father, and was willing to seal, and execute them, that They
might be valid; but his Father's Passion and Indignation so far trans∣ported
him (though He was a Gentleman of excellent Parts,) that He
refused any Reconciliation, and rejected all the Offers that were made
him of the Estate; so that his Son remained still in the Possesssion of his
Estate against his Will; for which He found great Reason afterwards to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>rejoice; but He was for the present, so much afflicted with his Father's
Displeasure, that He transported himself and his Wife into <HI>Holland,</HI> re∣solving
to buy some military Command, and to spend the Remainder of
his Life in that Profession; but being disappointed in the Treaty He ex∣pected;
and finding no Opportunity to accommodate himself with such
a Command, He returned again into <HI>England;</HI> resolving to retire to a
Country Life, and to his Books; that since He was not like to improve
himself in Arms, He might advance in Letters.</P>
<P>IN this Resolution He was so severe (as He was always naturally very in∣tent
upon what He was inclined to) that He declared, He would not see <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
<MILESTONE N="30"/>in many Years, which was the Place He loved of all the World; and that
in his Studies, He would first apply himself to the <HI>Greek,</HI> and pursue it with∣out
Intermission, till He should attain to the full Understanding of that
Tongue; and it is hardly to be credited, what Industry He used, and what
Success attended that Industry; for though his Father's Death, by an un∣happy
Accident, made his Repair to <HI>London</HI> absolutely necessary, in fewer
Years, than He had proposed for his Absence; yet He had first made him∣self
Master of the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue (in the <HI>Latin</HI> He was very well versed
before) and had read not only the <HI>Greek</HI> Historians, but <HI>Homer</HI> likewise,
and such of the Poets as were worthy to be perused.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>THOUGH his Father's Death brought no other Convenience to him, but
a Title to redeem an Estate, mortgaged for as much as it was worth, and
for which He was compelled to sell a siner Seat of his own; yet it im∣posed
a Burthen upon him, of the Title of a Viscount, and an Increase
of Expense, in which He was not in his Nature too provident, or re∣strained;
having naturally such a Generosity and Bounty in him, that He
seemed to have his Estate in Trust, for all worthy Persons, who stood in
want of Supplies and Encouragement, as <HI>Ben. Johnson,</HI> and many others
of that Time, whose Fortunes required, and whose Spirits made them su∣perior
to, ordinary Obligations; which yet They were contented to receive
<MILESTONE N="50"/>from Him, because his Bounties were so generously distributed, and so
much without Vanity and Ostentation, that except from those few Per∣sons,
from whom He sometimes received the Characters of fit Objects for
his Benefits, or whom He intrusted, for the more secret deriving them to
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
them, He did all He could, that the Persons themselves who received them,
should not know from what Fountain They flowed; and when that could
not be concealed, He sustained any Acknowledgment from the Persons
obliged, with so much Trouble, and Bashfulness, that They might well
perceive, that He was even ashamed of the little He had given, and to re∣ceive
so large a Recompence for it.</P>
<P>AS soon as He had finished all those Transactions, which the Death of
his Father had made necessary to be done, He retired again to his Coun∣try
Life, and to his severe Course of Study, which was very delightful to
him, as soon as He was engaged in it; but He was wont to say, that He<MILESTONE N="10"/>
never found Reluctancy in any Thing He resolved to do, but in his quitting
<HI>London,</HI> and departing from the Conversation of those He enjoyed there;
which was in some Degree preserved, and continued by frequent Letters,
and often Visits, which were made by his Friends from thence, whilst He
continued wedded to the Country; and which were so grateful to him,
that during their Stay with him, He looked upon no Book, except their
very Conversation made an Appeal to some Book; and truly his whole
Conversation was one continued <HI>Convivium Philosophicum,</HI> or <HI>Convivium
Theologicum,</HI> enlivened, and refreshed with all the Facetiousness of Wit, and
Good-Humour, and Pleasantness of Discourse, which made the Gravity<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of the Argument itself (whatever it was) very delectable. His House
where He usually resided (<HI>Tew,</HI> or <HI>Burford</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>) being within ten
or twelve Miles of the University, looked like the University itself, by the
Company that was always found there. There were Dr. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Morley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> Dr. <HI>Earles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> and indeed all
Men of eminent Parts and Faculties in <HI>Oxford,</HI> besides those who resorted
thither from <HI>London;</HI> who all found their Lodgings there, as ready as in the
Colleges, nor did the Lord of the House know of their coming, or going,
nor who were in his House, till He came to Dinner, or Supper, where all
still met; otherwise, there was no troublesome Ceremony, or Constraint to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
forbid Men to come to the House, or to make them weary of staying
there; so that many came thither to study in a better Air, finding all the
Books They could desire, in his Library, and all the Persons together,
whose Company They could wish, and not find, in any other Society.
Here Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> wrote, and formed, and modelled his excellent
Book against the learned Jesuit Mr. <HI>Nott,</HI> after frequent Debates upon the
most important Particulars; in many of which, He suffered himself to be
over-ruled by the Judgment of his Friends, though in others He still ad∣hered
to his own Fancy, which was sceptical enough, even in the highest
Points.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IN this happy and delightful Conversation, and Restraint, He remained
in the Country many Years; and until He had made so prodigious a Progress
in Learning, that there were very few classick Authors in the <HI>Greek,</HI> or
<HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, that He had not read with great Exactness; He had read
all the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers; all the most allowed and authentick ec∣clesiastical
Writers; and all the Councils, with wonderful Care, and Obser∣vation;
for in Religion He thought too careful, and too curious an En∣quiry
could not be made, amongst those, whose Purity was not questioned,
and whose Authority was constantly, and confidently urged, by Men who
were furthest from being of one Mind amongst themselves; and for the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
mutual Support of their several Opinions, in which They most contra∣dicted
each other; and in all those Controversies, He had so dispassioned
a Consideration; such a Candour in his Nature, and so profound a Charity
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
in his Conscience, that in those Points, in which He was in his own Judg∣ment
most clear, He never thought the worse, or in any Degree declined
the Familiarity, of those who were of another Mind; which, without
Question, is an excellent Temper for the Propagation, and Advancement
of Christianity. With these great Advantages of Industry, He had a Me∣mory
retentive of all that He had ever read, and an Understanding and
Judgment to apply it seasonably and appositely, with the most Dexterity
and Address, and the least Pedantry and Affectation, that ever Man, who
knew so much, was possessed with, of what Quality soever: It is not a
<MILESTONE N="10"/>trivial Evidence of his Learning, his Wit, and his Candour, that may be
found in that Discourse of his, against the Infallibility of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> published since his Death, and from a Copy under his own Hand,
though not prepared and digested by him for the Press, and to which He
would have given some Castigations.</P>
<P>BUT all his Parts, Abilities, and Faculties, by Art and Industry, were
not to be valued, or mentioned, in Comparison of his most accomplished
Mind and Manners; his Gentleness, and Affability was so transcendent, and
obliging, that it drew Reverence, and some Kind of Compliance from the
roughest, and most unpolished, and stubborn Constitutions; and made
<MILESTONE N="20"/>them of another Temper in Debate, in his Presence, than They were in
other Places: He was in his Nature so severe a Lover of Justice, and so
precise a Lover of Truth, that He was superior to all possible Tempta∣tions
for the Violation of either; indeed so rigid an Exacter of Perfection,
in all those Things which seemed but to border upon either of them, and
by the common Practice of Men were not thought to border upon either,
that many who knew him very well, and loved, and admired his Virtue (as
all who did know him must love, and admire it) did believe, that He was
of a Temper and Composition, fitter to live in <HI>Republicâ Platonis,</HI> than <HI>in
Faece Romuli;</HI> but this Rigidness was only exercised towards himself; to∣wards
<MILESTONE N="30"/>his Friend's Infirmities no man was more indulgent. In his Conver∣sation,
which was the most chearful and pleasant that can be imagined,
though He was young (for all I have yet spoken of him doth not exceed
his Age of twenty-five or twenty-six Years) and of great Gaiety in his Hu∣mour,
with a flowing Delightfulness of Language, He had so chaste a
Tongue, and Ear, that there was never known a profane, or loose Word to
fall from him, nor in Truth in his Company; the Integrity, and Cleanli∣ness
of the Wit of that Time, not exercising itself in that Licence, be∣fore
Persons for whom They had any Esteem.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Francis Wenman</HI> would not look upon himself under any other
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Character,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Francis Wenman.</NOTE> than that of a Country Gentleman; though no Man of his
Quality in <HI>England</HI> was more esteemed in Court. He was of a noble
Extraction, and of an ancient Family in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> where He was
possessed of a competent Estate; but his Reputation of Wisdom, and In∣tegrity,
gave him an Interest and Credit in that Country, much above his
Fortune; and no Man had more Esteem in it, or Power over it. He was
a Neighbour to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and in so entire Friendship and Con∣sidence
with him, that He had great Authority in the Society of all his
Friends, and Acquaintance. He was a Man of a great Sharpness of Un∣derstanding,
and of a piercing Judgment; no Man better understood the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Affections and Temper of the Kingdom, or indeed the Nature of the Na∣tion,
or discerned farther the Consequence of Counsels, and with what
Success They were like to be attended. He was a very good <HI>Latin</HI> Scho∣lar,
but his Ratiocination was above his Learning; and the Sharpness of his
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
Wit incomparable: He was equal to the greatest Trust and Employment,
if He had been ambitious of it, or solicitous for it; but his Want of
Health produced a Kind of Laziness of Mind, which disinclined him to
Business, and He died a little before the general Troubles of the Kingdom,
which He foresaw with wonderful Concern, and when many wise Men
were weary of living so long.</P>
<P>SIDNEY GODOLPHIN was a younger Brother of <HI>Godolphin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Sid∣ney Godol∣phin.</NOTE> but by the
Provision left by his Father, and by the Death of a younger Brother, li∣berally
supplied for a very good Education, and for a chearful Subsistence,
in any Course of Life He proposed to himself. There was never so great<MILESTONE N="10"/>
a Mind and Spirit contained in so little Room; so large an Understanding,
and so unrestrained a Fancy, in so very small a Body; so that the Lord
<HI>Falkland</HI> used to say merrily, that He thought it was a great Ingredient
into his Friendship for Mr. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> that He was pleased to be found in
his Company, where He was the properer Man; and it may be, the very
Remarkableness of his little Person, made the Sharpness of his Wit, and
the composed Quickness of his Judgment and Understanding, the more
notable. He had spent some Years in <HI>France,</HI> and in the low Countries;
and accompanied the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> in his Ambassage into <HI>Denmark,</HI> be∣fore
He resolved to be quiet, and attend some Promotion in the Court;<MILESTONE N="20"/>
where his excellent Disposition and Manners, and extraordinary Qualifica∣tions,
made him very acceptable. Though every Body loved his Com∣pany
very well, yet He loved very much to be alone, being in his Consti∣tution
inclined somewhat to Melancholy, and to Retirement amongst his
Books; and was so far from being active, that He was contented to be re∣proached
by his Friends with Laziness; and was of so nice and tender a
Composition, that a little Rain or Wind would disorder him, and divert
him from any short Journey, He had most willingly proposed to himself;
insomuch, as when He rid abroad with those in whose Company He most
delighted, if the Wind chanced to be in his Face, he would (after a little<MILESTONE N="30"/>
pleasant murmuring) suddenly turn his Horse, and go Home: Yet the Ci∣vil
War no sooner began (the first Approaches towards which He dis∣covered
as soon as any Man, by the Proceedings in Parliament, where He
was a Member, and opposed with great Indignation) than He put himself
into the first Troops which were raised in the West for the King; and
bore the Uneasiness and Fatigue of Winter Marches, with an exemplar
Courage and Alacrity; until by too brave a Pursuit of the Enemy, into an
obscure Village in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> He was shot with a Musket; with which
(without saying any Word more, than, Oh God, I am hurt) He fell dead
from his Horse; to the excessive Grief of his Friends, who were all that<MILESTONE N="40"/>
knew him; and the irreparable Damage of the Public.</P>
<P>EDMUND WALLER was born to a very fair Estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Ed∣mund Waller.</NOTE> by the Parsimony, or
Frugality, of a wise Father and Mother; and He thought it so com∣mendable
an Advantage, that He resolved to improve it with his utmost
Care, upon which in his Nature He was too much intent; and in Order
to that, He was so much reserved and retired, that He was scarce ever
heard of, till by his Address and Dexterity He had gotten a very rich
Wife in the City, against all the Recommendation, and Countenance, and
Authority of the Court, which was thoroughly engaged on the Behalf of
Mr. <HI>Crofts;</HI> and which used to be successful in that Age, against any Op∣position.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
He had the good Fortune to have an Alliance and Friendship
with Dr. <HI>Morley,</HI> who had assisted, and instructed him in the reading many
good Books, to which his natural Parts and Promptitude inclined him,
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
especially the Poets; and at the Age when other Men used to give over
writing Verses (for He was near thirty Years of Age, when He first en∣gaged
himself in that Exercise, at least, that He was known to do so)
He surprized the Town with two or three Pieces of that Kind; as if a
tenth Muse had been newly born, to cherish drooping Poetry. The Doctor
at that Time brought him into that Company, which was most cele∣brated
for good Conversation; where He was received, and esteemed, with
great Applause, and Respect. He was a very pleasant Discourser, in Ear∣nest,
and in Jest, and therefore very grateful to all Kind of Company,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>where He was not the less esteemed for being very rich.</P>
<P>HE had been even nursed in Parliaments, where He sat when He was very
young; and so when They were resumed again (after a long Intermission)
He appeared in those Assemblies with great Advantage; having a graceful
Way of speaking, and by thinking much upon several Arguments (which his
Temper and Complexion, that had much of Melancholic, inclined him to)
He seemed often to speak upon the sudden, when the Occasion had only
administred the Opportunity of saying, what He had thoroughly considered,
which gave a great Lustre to all He said; which yet was rather of Delight,
than Weight. There needs no more be said to extol the Excellence and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Power of his Wit, and Pleasantness of his Conversation, than that it was of
Magnitude enough, to cover a World of very great Faults; that is, so to
cover them, that They were not taken Notice of to his Reproach; <HI>viz.</HI> a
Narrowness in his Nature to the lowest Degree; an Abjectness, and Want
of Courage to support him in any virtuous Undertaking; an Insinuation,
and servile Flattery to the Height, the vainest, and most imperious Nature
could be contented with; that it preserved and won his Life from those,
who were most resolved to take it; and in an Occasion in which He ought
to have been ambitious to have lost it; and then preserved him again, from
the Reproach and Contempt that was due to him, for so preserving it,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and for vindicating it at such a Price; that it had Power to reconcile him
to those, whom He had most offended and provoked; and continued to
his Age with that rare Felicity, that his Company was acceptable, where
his Spirit was odious; and He was at least pitied, where He was most
detested.</P>
<P>OF Doctor <HI>Sheldon</HI> there needs no more be said in this Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Dr.</HI> Shel∣don.</NOTE> than that
his Learning, and Gravity, and Prudence, had in that Time raised him to
such a Reputation, when He was Chaplain in the House to the Lord
Keeper <HI>Coventry,</HI> (who exceedingly esteemed him, and used his Service
not only in all Matters relating to the Church, but in many other Busi∣nesses
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of Importance, and in which that great, and good Lord was nearly
concerned) and when He was afterwards Warden of <HI>All Souls</HI> College in
<HI>Oxford,</HI> that He then was looked upon, as very equal to any Preferment
the Church could yield, or hath since yielded unto him; and Sir <HI>Francis
Wenman</HI> would often say, when the Doctor resorted to the Conversation
at the Lord <HI>Falkland's</HI> House, as He frequently did, that “Dr. <HI>Sheldon</HI>
was born, and bred to be Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI>”</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Morley</HI> was a Gentleman of very eminent Parts in all polite
Learning;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Dr.</HI> Mor∣ley.</NOTE> of great Wit, and Readiness, and Subtilty in Disputation; and
of remarkable Temper, and Prudence in Conversation, which rendered
<MILESTONE N="50"/>him most grateful in all the best Company. He was then Chaplain in the
House, and to the Family, of the Lord and Lady <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> which needed
a wise, and a wary Director. From some academick Contests He had been
engaged in, during his living in <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where He was al∣ways
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
of the first Eminency, He had by the natural Faction and Animosity
of those Disputes, fallen under the Reproach of holding some Opinions,
which were not then grateful to those Churchmen, who had the greatest
Power in ecclesiastical Promotions; and some sharp Answers and Replies,
He used to make in accidental Discourses, and which in Truth were made
for Mirth and Pleasantness sake (as He was of the highest Facetiousness)
were reported, and spread abroad to his Prejudice; as being once asked by
a grave Country Gentleman (who was desirous to be instructed what their
Tenets and Opinions were) “what the <HI>Arminians</HI> held,” He pleasantly
answered, that <HI>They held all the best Bishopricks and Deaneries in</HI> England;<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which was quickly reported abroad, as Mr. <HI>Morley</HI>'s Definition of the <HI>Ar∣minian</HI>
Tenets.</P>
<P>SUCH, and the like harmless and jocular Sayings, upon many accidental
Occasions, had wrought upon the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury, Laud,</HI> (who
lived to change his Mind, and to have a just Esteem of him) to entertain
some Prejudice towards him; and the Respect which was paid him by many
eminent Persons, as <HI>John Hampden, Arthur Goodwin,</HI> and others, who were
not thought Friends to the Prosperity the Church was in, made others ap∣prehend
that He was not enough zealous for it: But that Disaffection, and
Virulency (which few Men had then owned and discovered) no sooner ap∣peared,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in those, and other Men, but Dr. <HI>Morley</HI> made haste as publickly to
oppose them, both in private, and in publick; which had the more Effect to
the Benefit of the Church, by his being a Person above all possible Reproach,
and known, and valued by more Persons of Honour than most of the Clergy
were; and being not only without the Envy of any Preferment, but un∣der
the Advantage of a discountenanced Person: And as He was after∣wards
the late King's Chaplain, and much regarded by him, and as long
about him, as any of his Chaplains were permitted to attend him; so pre∣sently
after his Murder, He left the Kingdom, and remained in Banish∣ment,
till King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's happy Return.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Earles</HI> was at that Time Chaplain in the House to the Earl
Of <HI>Pembroke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Dr.</HI> Earles.</NOTE> Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold, and had a
Lodging in the Court under that Relation: He was a Person very notable
for his Elegance in the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues; and being Fellow of
<HI>Merton</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and having been Proctor of the University, and
some very witty, and sharp Discourses being published in Print without his
Consent, though known to be his, He grew suddenly into a very general
Esteem with all Men; being a Man of great Piety and Devotion; a most
eloquent and powerful Preacher; and of a Conversation so pleasant and
delightful, so very innocent, and so very facetious, that no Man's Com∣pany<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was more desired, and more loved. No Man was more negligent
in his Dress, and Habit, and Mien; no Man more wary, and cultivated,
in his Behaviour, and Discourse; insomuch as He had the greater Ad∣vantage
when He was known, by promising so little before He was known.
He was an excellent Poet, both in <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> as appears
by many Pieces yet abroad; though He suppressed many more himself,
especially of <HI>English,</HI> incomparably good, out of an Austerity to those
Sallies of his Youth. He was very dear to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> with whom
He spent as much Time as He could make his own; and as that Lord
would impute the speedy Progress He made in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, to the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Information, and Assistance He had from Mr. <HI>Earles,</HI> so Mr. <HI>Earles</HI> would
frequently profess, that He had got more useful Learning by his Conver∣sation
at <HI>Tew</HI> (the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>'s House) than He had at <HI>Oxford.</HI> In the
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
first settling of the Prince his Family, He was made one of his Chap∣lains;
and attended on him when He was forced to leave the Kingdom.
He was amongst the few excellent Men who never had, nor ever could
have an Enemy, but such a one, who was an Enemy to all Learning, and
Virtue, and therefore would never make himself known.</P>
<P>Mr. JOHN HALES had been <HI>Greek</HI> Professor in the University of <HI>Oxford;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Hales.</NOTE>
and had borne the greatest Part of the Labour of that excellent Edition
and Impression of St. <HI>Chrysostom's</HI> Works, set out by Sir <HI>Harry Savile;</HI>
who was then Warden of <HI>Merton</HI> College, when the other was Fellow of
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that House. He was Chaplain in the House with Sir <HI>Dudley Carleton,</HI>
Ambassador at the <HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> at the Time when the Synod of
<HI>Dort</HI> was held, and so had Liberty to be present at the Consultations in
that Assembly; and hath left the best Memorial behind him, of the Ig∣norance,
and Passion, and Animosity, and Injustice of that Convention;
of which He often made very pleasant Relations; though at that Time
it received too much Countenance from <HI>England.</HI> Being a Person of the
greatest Eminency for Learning, and other Abilities, from which He might
have promised himself any Preserment in the Church, He withdrew him∣self
from all Pursuits of that Kind, into a private Fellowship in the Col∣lege
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of <HI>Eton,</HI> where his Friend Sir <HI>Harry Savile</HI> was Provost; where He
lived amongst his Books, and the most separated from the World of any
Man then living; though He was not in the least Degree inclined to Me∣lancholy,
but on the contrary, of a very open and pleasant Conversation;
and therefore was very well pleased with the Resort of his Friends to him,
who were such as He had chosen, and in whose Company He delighted,
and for whose sake He would sometimes, once in a Year, resort to <HI>London,</HI>
only to enjoy their chearful Conversation.</P>
<P>HE would never take any Cure of Souls; and was so great a Con∣temner
of Money, that He was wont to say, that his Fellowship, and the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Bursar's Place (which for the good of the College, He held many Years)
was worth him fifty Pounds a Year more than He could spend; and yet,
besides his being very charitable to all poor People, even to Liberality;
He had made a greater, and better Collection of Books, than were to be
found in any other private Library that I have seen; as He had sure read
more, and carried more about him, in his excellent Memory, than any
Man I ever knew, my Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> only excepted, who I think sided
him. He had, whether from his natural Temper and Constitution, or
from his long Retirement from all Crowds, or from his profound Judg∣ment,
and discerning Spirit, contracted some Opinions, which were not
<MILESTONE N="40"/>received, nor by him published, except in private Discourses; and then
rather upon Occasion of Dispute, than of positive Opinion; and He
would often say, his Opinions He was sure did Him no Harm, but He
was far from being confident, that They might not do others Harm, who
entertained them, and might entertain other Results from them, than He
did; and therefore He was very reserved in communicating what He
thought Himself in those Points, in which He differed from what was re∣ceived.</P>
<P>NOTHING troubled him more, than the Brawls which were grown
from Religion; and He therefore exceedingly detested the Tyranny of the
Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> more for their imposing uncharitably upon the Con∣sciences
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of other Men, than for the Errors in their own Opinions; and
Would often say, that He would renounce the Religion of the Church of
<HI>England</HI> to-morrow, if it obliged him to believe that any other Christians
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
should be damned; and that nobody would conclude another Man to be
damned, who did not wish him so. No Man more strict and severe to
himself; to other Men so charitable as to their Opinions, that He thought
that other Men were more in Fault for their Carriage towards them, than
the Men themselves were, who erred; and He thought that Pride, and
Passion, more than Conscience, were the Cause of all Separation from
each others Communion; and He frequently said, that that only kept the
World from agreeing upon such a Liturgy, as might bring them into one
Communion; all doctrinal Points upon which Men differed in their Opi∣nions,
being to have no Place in any Liturgy. Upon an occasional Dis∣course<MILESTONE N="10"/>
with a Friend, of the frequent, and uncharitable Reproaches of
Heretick, and Schismatick, too lightly thrown at each other, amongst
Men who differ in their Judgment, He writ a little Discourse of Schism,
contained in less than two Sheets of Paper; which being transmitted from
Friend to Friend in Writing, was at last, without any Malice, brought to
the View of the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Dr. <HI>Laud,</HI> who was a very
rigid Surveyor of all Things which never so little bordered upon Schism;
and thought the Church could not be too vigilant against, and jealous of
such Incursions.</P>
<P>HE sent for Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> whom, when They had both lived in the Uni∣versity<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of <HI>Oxford,</HI> He had known well; and told him, that He had in
Truth believed him to be long since dead; and chid him very kindly for
having never come to him, having been of his old Acquaintance; then
asked him, whether He had lately writ a short Discourse of Schism,
and whether He was of that Opinion, which that Discourse implied; He
told him, that He had, for the Satisfaction of a private Friend, (who was
not of his Mind) a Year or two before, writ such a small Tract, without
any Imagination that it would be communicated; and that He believed it
did not contain any Thing, that was not agreeable to the Judgment of the
Primitive Fathers; upon which, the Archbishop debated with him upon<MILESTONE N="30"/>
some Expressions of <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> and the most ancient Fathers; and con∣cluded
with saying, that the Time was very apt to set new Doctrines on
Foot, of which the Wits of the Age were too susceptible; and that there
could not be too much Care taken, to preserve the Peace and Unity of the
Church; and from thence asked him of his Condition, and whether He
wanted any Thing, and the other answering, that He had enough,
and wanted, or desired no Addition, so dismissed him with great Courtesy;
and shortly after sent for him again, when there was a Prebendary of
<HI>Windsor</HI> fallen, and told him, the King had given him the Preferment,
because it lay so convenient to his Fellowship of <HI>Eton;</HI> which (though in∣deed<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the most convenient Preferment that could be thought of for him)
the Archbishop could not without great Difficulty, persuade him to ac∣cept,
and He did accept it rather to please Him, than Himself; because He
really believed He had enough before. He was one of the least Men in
the Kingdom, and one of the greatest Scholars in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. CHILLINGWORTH was of a Stature little superior to Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> (and
it was an Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Chilling∣worth.</NOTE> in which there were many great, and wonderful Men of
that Size) and a Man of so great a Subtilty of Understanding, and so rare
a Temper in Debate; that as it was impossible to provoke Him into any
Passion, so it was very difficult to keep a Man's self from being a little dis∣composed<MILESTONE N="50"/>
by his Sharpness, and Quickness of Argument, and Instances,
in which He had a rare Facility, and a great Advantage over all the Men
I ever knew. He had spent all his younger Time in Disputation; and
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
had arrived to so great a Mastery, as He was inferior to no Man in those
Skirmishes; but He had, with his notable Perfection in this Exercise,
contracted such an Irresolution, and Habit of doubting, that by Degrees
He grew confident of nothing, and a Sceptick at least, in the greatest Mys∣teries
of Faith.</P>
<P>THIS made him from first wavering in Religion, and indulging to
Scruples, to reconcile himself too soon, and too easily to the Church of
<HI>Rome;</HI> and carrying still his own Inquisitiveness about him, without any
Resignation to their Authority (which is the only Temper can make that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Church sure of it's Proselytes) having made a Journey to <HI>St. Omers,</HI> purely to
perfect his Conversion, by the Conversation of those, who had the greatest
Name, He found as little Satisfaction there; and returned with as much
Haste from them; with a Belief that an entire Exemption from Error, was
neither inherent in, nor necessary to any Church: which occasioned that
War, which was carried on by the Jesuits with so great Asperity, and Re∣proaches
against him, and in which He defended himself, by such an ad∣mirable
Eloquence of Language, and clear, and incomparable Power of
Reason, that He not only made them appear unequal Adversaries, but
carried the War into their own Quarters; and made the Pope's Infallibi∣lity
<MILESTONE N="20"/>to be as much shaken, and declined by their own Doctors (and as
great an Acrimony amongst themselves upon that Subject) and to be at
least as much doubted, as in the Schools of the Reformed or Protestant;
and forced them since, to defend and maintain those unhappy Contro∣versies
in Religion, with Arms and Weapons of another Nature, than were
used, or known in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Bellarmine</HI> died; and which
probably will in Time undermine the very Foundation that supports it.</P>
<P>SUCH a Levity, and Propensity to change, is commonly attended with
great Infirmities in, and no less Reproach, and Prejudice to the Person;
but the Sincerity of his Heart was so conspicuous, and without the least
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Temptation of any corrupt End; and the Innocence, and Candour in his
Nature so evident, and without any Perverseness; that all who knew him,
clearly discerned, that all those restless Motions and Fluctuations, pro∣ceeded
only from the Warmth, and Jealousy of his own Thoughts, in a too
nice Inquisition for Truth. Neither the Books of the Adversary, nor any
of their Persons, though He was acquainted with the best of both, had ever
made great Impression upon him; all his Doubts grew out of himself,
when He assisted his Scruples with all the Strength of his own Reason, and
was then too hard for Himself; but finding as little Quiet and Repose in
those Victories, He quickly recovered, by a new Appeal to his own Judg∣ment;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>so that He was in Truth, upon the Matter, in all his Sallies, and
Retreats, his own Convert; though He was not so totally divested of all
Thoughts of this World, but that when He was ready for it, He ad∣mitted
some great and considerable Churchmen, to be Sharers with him
in his publick Conversion.</P>
<P>WHILST He was in Perplexity, or rather some passionate Disinclina∣tion
to the Religion He had been educated in, He had the Misfortune to
have much Acquaintance with one Mr. <HI>Lugar,</HI> a Minister of that Church;
a Man of a Competency of Learning, in those Points most controverted
with the <HI>Romanists,</HI> but of no acute Parts of Wit, or Judgment; and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>wrought so far upon him, by weakening, and enervating those Arguments,
by which He found He was governed (as He had all the Logick, and all the
Rhetorick, that was necessary to persuade very powerfully Men of the
greatest Talents) that the poor Man, not able to live long in Doubt, too
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
hastily deserted his own Church, and betook himself to the <HI>Roman:</HI> nor
could all the Arguments, and Reasons of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> make him
pause in the Expedition He was using; or reduce him from that Church
after He had given himself to it; but He had always a great Animosity
against him, for having (as He said) unkindly betrayed him, and carried
him into another Religion, and there left him. So unfit are some Consti∣tutions
to be troubled with Doubts, after They are once fixed.</P>
<P>HE did really believe all War to be unlawful; and did not think that
the Parliament (whose Proceedings He perfectly abhorted) did in Truth
intend to involve the Nation in a Civil War, till after the Battle of <HI>Edge∣hill;</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
and then He thought any Expedient, or Stratagem that was like to
put a speedy End to it, to be the most commendable: and so having too
mathematically conceived an Engine, that should move so lightly, as to
be a Breast-work in all Encounters, and Assaults in the Field; He car∣ried
it, to make the Experiment, into that Part of his Majesty's Army,
which was only in that Winter Season in the Field, under the Command
of the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> upon the Borders of <HI>Sussex;</HI> where
He was shut up in the Castle of <HI>Arundel;</HI> which was forced, after a short,
sharp Siege, to yield for want of Victual; and poor Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>
with it, falling into the Rebels Hands; and being most barbarously treated<MILESTONE N="20"/>
by them, especially by that Clergy which followed them; and being
broken with Sickness, contracted by the ill Accommodation, and Want
of Meat, and Fire during the Siege, which was in a terrible Season of
Frost and Snow, He died shortly after in Prison. He was a Man of ex∣cellent
Parts, and of a chearful Disposition; void of all Kind of Vice,
and endued with many notable Virtues; of a very publick Heart, and an
indefatigable Desire to do Good; his only Unhappiness proceeded from his
sleeping too little, and thinking too much; which sometimes threw him
into violent Fevers</P>
<P>THIS was Mr. HYDE's Company, and Conversation, to which He<MILESTONE N="30"/>
dedicated his vacant Times, and all that Time which He could make vacant,
from the Business of his Profession; which He indulged with no more
Passion than was necessary to keep up the Reputation of a Man, that had
no Purpose to be idle; which indeed He perfectly abhorred: and He took
always Occasion to celebrate the Time He had spent in that Conversation,
with great Satisfaction, and Delight. Nor was He less fortunate, in the
acquaintance and Friendships which He made with the Persons in his Pro∣fession;
who were all eminent Men, or of the most hopeful Parts; who
being all much superior to him in Age, and Experience, and entirely de∣voted
to their Profession, were yet well pleased with the Gaiety of his<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Humour, and inoffensive, and, winning Behaviour; and this good Incli∣nation
of theirs was improved by the Interest They saw He had in Per∣sons
of the best Quality, to whom He was very acceptable, and his Con∣dition
of living, which was with more Expense than young Lawyers were
accustomed to.</P>
<P>THOSE Persons were,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde's <HI>Friends in his Profession.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Lane,</HI> who was then Attorney to the Prinće
of <HI>Wales;</HI> and afterwards Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer; and lastly
upon the Death of the Lord <HI>Littleton,</HI> was made Keeper of the Great
Seal, who died in Banishment with King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. Mr. <HI>Geoffrey
Palmer,</HI> afterwards Attorney General. Mr. <HI>John Maynard;</HI> and <HI>Bulstrode<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Whitlock;</HI> all Men of eminent Parts, and great Learning out of their Pro∣fessions;
and in their Professions, of signal Reputation; and though the
two last did afterwards bow their Knees to <HI>Baal,</HI> and so swerved from
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
their Allegiance, it was with less Rancour and Malice than other Men;
They never led, but followed; and were rather carried away with the Tor∣rent,
than swam with the Stream; and failed through those Infirmities,
which less than a general Defection, and a prosperous Rebellion could ne∣ver
have discovered. With these, and very few other Persons of other So∣cieties,
and of more than ordinary Parts in the Profession, He conversed.
In Business, and in Practice, with the rest of the Profession He had at
most a formal Acquaintance, and little Familiarity; very seldom using,
when his Practice was at highest, so much as to eat in the Hall, without
<MILESTONE N="10"/>which, no Man ever got the Reputation of a good Student; but He ever
gave his Time of eating to his Friends; and was wont pleasantly to say,
“that He repaired himself with very good Company at Dinner, for the
ill Company He had kept in the Morning;” and made himself amends
for the Time He lost with his Friends, by declining Suppers; and with a
Part of that Time which was allowed for Sleep; but He grew every Day
more intent on Business, and more engaged in Practice, so that He could
not assign so much Time as He had used to do, to his beloved Conver∣sation.</P>
<P>THE Countenance He received from the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI>
who took all Occasion to mention him as a Person He had Kindness for;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Favour of the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> manifested as often as He came before
him; the Reception He found with the Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of <HI>Man∣chester,</HI>
who had raised the Court of Requests to as much Business as the
Chancery itself was possessed of, and where He was looked upon as a Fa∣vourite;
the Familiarity used towards him by the Lord <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who
was Lord Chamberlain of the King's House, and a greater Man in the
Country than the Court; by the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and many other Lords
and Ladies, and other Persons of Interest in the Court, made him looked
upon by the Judges in <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI> with much Condescension; and
They, who before He put on his Gown, looked upon him as one who
<MILESTONE N="30"/>designed some other Course of Life (for though He had been always very
punctual in the Performance of all those publick Exercises the Profession
obliged him to, both before, and after He was called to the Bar; yet in
all other Respects He seemed not to confine himself wholly to that Course
of Life) now when They no sooner saw him put on his Gown, but that
He was suddenly in Practice, and taken Notice of particularly in all Courts
of Justice with unusual Countenance, thought He would make what Pro∣gress
He desired in that Profession.</P>
<P>AS He had those many Friends in Court, so He was not less acceptable
to many great Persons in the Country, who least regarded the Court, and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>were least esteemed by it; and He had that rare Felicity, that even They,
who did not love many of those, upon whom He most depended, were
yet very well pleased with him, and with his Company. The Earl of
<HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> whose Interests, and Friendships were
then the same; and who were looked upon with Reverence by all who
had not Reverence for the Court; and even by all in the Court, who were
not satisfied there (which was, and always will be a great People) were
very kind to him, and ready to trust him in any Thing that was most se∣cret;
and though He could not dispose the Archbishop, or the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>
to any Correspondence, or good Intelligence with each other; which He
<MILESTONE N="50"/>exceedingly laboured to do, and found an equal Aversion in both towards
each other;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>re∣conciles the Archbishop, and the Earl of</HI> Hertford.</NOTE> yet He succeeded to his Wish in bringing the Archbishop, and
the Earl of <HI>Hertford</HI> to a very good Acquaintance, and Inclination to each
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
other; which They both often acknowledged kindly to him, and with
which the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was as much unsatisfied.</P>
<P>THE Person whose Life this Discourse is to recollect (and who had so
great an Affection, and Reverence for the Memory of Archbishop <HI>Laud,</HI>
that He never spake of him without extraordinary Esteem, and believed
him to be a Man of the most exemplar Virtue, and Piety of any of that
Age) was wont to say, the greatest Want the Archbishop had, was of a
true Friend, who would seasonably have told him of his Infirmities, and
what People spake of him; and He said, He knew well, that such a
Friend would have been very acceptable to him; and upon that Occasion<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He used to mention a Story of Himself; that when He was a young
Practiser of the Law, being in some Favour with him (as is mentioned be∣fore)
He went to visit him, in the Beginning of a <HI>Michaelmass</HI> Term,
shortly after his Return from the Country, where He had spent a Month
or two of the Summer.</P>
<P>HE found the Archbishop early walking in the Garden;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His free Ex∣postulation with the Arch∣bishop.</NOTE> who received
him according to his Custom, very graciously, and continuing his Walk,
asked him, “what good News in the Country?” to which He answered,
“there was none good; the People were universally discontented; and
(which troubled him most) that many People spoke extreme ill of his<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Grace, as the Cause of all that was amiss.” He replied, “that He was
sorry for it; He knew He did not deserve it; and that He must not
give over serving the King, and the Church, to please the People, who
otherwise would not speak well of him.” Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, “He
thought He need not lessen his Zeal for either; and that it grieved him
to find Persons of the best Condition, and who loved both King, and
Church, exceedingly indevoted to Him; complaining of his Manner of
treating them, when They had Occasion to resort to him, it may be,
for his Directions.” And then named him two Persons of the most In∣terest
and Credit in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> who had that Summer attended the Coun∣cil<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Board, in some Affairs which concerned the King, and the County;
that all the Lords present used them with great Courtesy, knowing well
their Quality, and Reputation; but that He alone spake very sharply to
them, and without any Thing of Grace, at which They were much trou∣bled;
and one of them, supposing that somebody had done him ill Offices,
went the next Morning to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to present his Service to him, and to
discover, if He could, what Misrepresentation had been made of him:
that after He had attended very long, He was admitted to speak with his
Grace, who scarce hearing him, sharply answered him, that “He had no
Leisure for Compliments;” and so hurried away; which put the other<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Gentleman much out of Countenance: And that this Kind of Behaviour
of his was the Discourse of all Companies of Persons of Quality; every Man
continuing any such Story with another like it, very much to his Disad∣vantage;
and to the Trouble of those who were very just to him.</P>
<P>HE heard the Relation very patiently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop's Re∣ply.</NOTE> and attentively; and discoursed
over every Particular with all imaginable Condescension; and said, with
evident Shew of Trouble, that “He was very unfortunate to be so ill un∣derstood;
that He meant very well; that He remembered the Time,
when those two Persons were with the Council; than upon any Delibe∣rations,
when any Thing was resolved, or to be said to any body, the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Council enjoined him to deliver their Resolutions; which He did al∣ways
according to the best of his Understanding; but by the Imper∣fection
He had by Nature, which He said often troubled him, He might
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
deliver it in such a Tune, and with a Sharpness of Voice, that made
Men believe He was angry, when there was no such Thing; that when
those Gentlemen were there, and He had delivered what He was to say,
They made some Stay, and spake with some of the Lords, which not
being according to Order, He thought He gave them some Reprehen∣sion;
They having at that Time very much other Business to do: that
He did well remember, that one of them (who was a Person of Honour)
came afterwards to him, at a Time He was shut up about an Affair of
Importance, which required his full Thoughts; but that as soon as He
<MILESTONE N="10"/>heard of the other's being without, He sent for him, himself going into
the next Room, and received him very kindly, as He thought; and sup∣posing
that He came about Business, asked him what his Business was,
and the other answering, that He had no Business, but continuing his
Address with some Ceremony, He had indeed said, that He had not
Time for Compliments; but He did not think that He went out of the
Room in that Manner: and concluded, that it was not possible for him
in the many Occupations He had, to spend any Time in unnecessary
Compliments; and that if his Integrity and Uprightness, which never
should be liable to Reproach, could not be strong enough to preserve
<MILESTONE N="20"/>him, He must submit to God's Pleasure.”</P>
<P>HE was well contented to hear Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> reply very freely upon the
Subject, who said, “He observed by what his Grace himself had related,
that the Gentlemen had too much Reason for the Report They made;
and He did not wonder that They had been much troubled at his Car∣riage
towards them; that He did exceedingly wish, that He would more
reserve his Passion towards all Persons, how faulty soever; and that He
would treat Persons of Honour, and Quality, and Interest in their Coun∣try,
with more Courtesy, and Condescension; especially when They came
to visit him, and make Offer of their Service.” He said, smiling, that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>“He could only undertake for his Heart; that He had very good Mean∣ing;
for his Tongue, He could not undertake, that He would not some∣times
speak more hastily, and sharply, than He should do, (which
oftentimes He was sorry, and reprehended himself for) and in a Tune
which might be liable to Misinterpretation, with them, who were
not very well acquainted with him, and so knew, that it was an In∣firmity,
which his Nature, and Education had so rooted in him,
that it was in vain to contend with it.” For the State, and Distance
He kept with Men, He said, “He thought it was not more than was
suitable to the Place and Degree He held in the Church, and State;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>or so much as others had assumed to themselves, who had sat in his
Place; and thereupon He told him some Behaviour and Carriage of his
Predecessor <HI>Abbot</HI> (who He said was not better born than himself) to∣wards
the greatest Nobility of the Kingdom, which He thought was
very insolent, and inexcusable;” and was indeed very ridiculous.</P>
<P>AFTER this free Discourse, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> ever found himself more graciously
received by him, and treated with more Familiarity; upon which He al∣ways
concluded, that if the Archbishop had had any true Friend, who
would, in proper Seasons, have dealt frankly with him, in the most im∣portant
Matters, and wherein the Errors were like to be most penal, He
<MILESTONE N="50"/>would not only have received it very well, but have profited himself by it.
But it is the Misfortune of most Persons of that Education (how worthy
soever) that They have rarely Friendships with Men above their own Con∣dition;
and that their Ascent being commonly sudden, from low to high,
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
They have afterwards rather Dependants than Friends; and are still de∣ceived,
by keeping somewhat in Reserve to themselves, even from those
with whom They seem most openly to communicate; and which is worse,
receive for the most Part, their Informations and Advertisements from
Clergymen, who understand the least, and take the worst Measure of hu∣man
Affairs, of all Mankind, that can write, and read.</P>
<P>UNDER this universal Acquaintance, and general Acceptation, Mr.
<HI>Hyde</HI> led, for many Years, as chearful, and pleasant a Life, as any Man
did enjoy, as long as the Kingdom took any Pleasure in itself. His Prac∣tice
grew every Day as much as He wished; and would have been much<MILESTONE N="10"/>
more, if He had wished it; by which, He not only supported his Ex∣pense,
greater much than Men of his Rank, and Pretences, used to make,
but encreased his Estate by some convenient Purchases of Land, adjoin∣ing
to his other; and He grew so much in Love with Business and Prac∣tice,
that He gave up his whole Heart to it; resolving, by a Course of se∣vere
Study, to recover the Time He had lost upon less profitable Learn∣ing;
and to intend nothing else, but to reap all those Benefits, to which
that Profession could carry him, and to the pursuing whereof, He had so
many, and so unusual Encouragements; and towards which it was not the
least, that God had blessed him with an excellent Wife, who perfectly<MILESTONE N="20"/>
resigned herself to him; and who then had brought him, before any Trou∣bles
in the Kingdom, three Sons, and a Daughter, which He then, and
ever, looked upon as his greatest Blessing, and Consolation.</P>
<P>BECAUSE we shall have little Cause hereafter to mention any other
Particulars,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde's <HI>Reflections on the younger Part of his Life.</HI></NOTE> in the calm Part of his Life, whilst He followed the Study
and Practice of the Law, it will not in this Place appear a very imper∣tinent
Digression to say, that He was, in that very Time, when Fortune
seemed to smile, and to intend well towards him, and often afterwards,
throughout the whole Course of his Life, wont to say, that “when He
reflected upon himself, and his past Actions, even from the Time of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
his first coming to the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> He had much more Cause to be
terrified upon the Reflection, than the Man had, who viewed <HI>Rochester</HI>
Bridge in the Morning that it was broken, and which He had galloped
over in the Night; that He had passed over more Precipices than the
other had done, for many Nights, and Days, and some Years together;
from which, nothing but the immediate Hand of God, could have pre∣served
him.” For though it is very true, the Persons before mentioned
were the only Men, in whose Company, in those Seasons of his Life, He
took Delight; yet He frequently found himself in the Conversation of
worse, and indeed of all Manner of Men; and it being in the Time when<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the War was entered into against the two Crowns; and the Expeditions
made to, and unprosperous returns from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> the
Town was full of Soldiers, and of young Gentlemen who intended to be
Soldiers, or as like them as They could; great License used of all Kinds,
in Cloaths, in Diet, in Gaming; and all Kind of Expenses equally carried
on, by Men who had Fortunes of their own to support it, and by others,
who having nothing of their own, cared not what They spent, whilst They
could find Credit; so that there was never an Age, in which in so short
a Time, so many young Gentlemen, who had not Experience in the
World, or some good tutelar Angel to protect them, were insensibly, and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
suddenly overwhelmed in that Sea of Wine, and Women, and Quarrels, and
Gaming, which almost overspread the whole Kingdom, and the Nobility,
and Gentry thereof. And when He had by God's immediate Blessing, dis∣entangled
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
himself from these Labyrinths (his Nature and Inclination dis∣posing
him rather to pass through those dissolute Quarters, than to make
any Stay in them) and was enough composed against any extravagant
Excursions; He was still conversant with a Rank of Men (how worthy
soever) above his Quality; and engaged in an Expense above his For∣tune,
if the extraordinary Accidents of his Life, had not supplied him
for those Excesses; so that it brought no Prejudice upon him, except in the
Censure of severe Men, who thought him a Person of more License than in
Truth He was; and who in a short Time, were very fully reconciled to him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>HE had without Doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And his own Character.</NOTE> great Infirmities; which by a providential
Mercy were seasonably restrained from growing into Vices, at least into
any that were habitual. He had Ambition enough to keep him from
being satisfied with his own Condition, and to raise his Spirit to great De∣signs
of raising himself; but not to transport him to endeavour it by any
crooked, and indirect Means. He was never suspected to flatter the great∣est
Man; or in the least Degree to dissemble his own Opinions, or Thoughts,
how ingrateful soever it often proved; and even an affected Defect in, and
Contempt of those two useful Qualities cost him dear afterwards. He in∣dulged
his Palate very much, and took even some Delight in eating and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>drinking well; but without any Approach to Luxury; and, in Truth,
rather discoursed like an Epicure, than was one; having spent much Time
in the eating Hours, with the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and the
Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> Men who excelled in gratifying their Appetites. He had
a Fancy sharp, and luxuriant; but so carefully cultivated, and strictly
guarded, that He never was heard to speak a loose, or a profane Word;
which He imputed to the Chastity of the Persons, where his Conversa∣tion
usually was; where that rank Sort of Wit was religiously detested;
and a little Discountenance would quickly root those unsavoury Weeds
out of all Discourses where Persons of Honour are present.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>HE was in his Nature inclined to Pride and Passion; and to a Hu∣mour
between Wrangling, and Disputing, very troublesome; which good
Company in a short Time, so much reformed, and mastered, that no Man
was more affable and courteous to all Kind of Persons; and They who
knew the great Infirmity of his whole Family, which abounded in Pas∣sion,
used to say, He had much extinguished the Unruliness of that Fire.
That which supported, and rendered him generally acceptable, was his
Generosity (for He had too much a Contempt of Money) and the Opi∣nion
Men had of the Goodness, and Justice of his Nature which was
transcendent in him, in a wonderful Tenderness, and Delight in obliging.
<MILESTONE N="40"/>His Integrity was ever without Blemish; and believed to be above Temp∣tation.
He was firm and unshaken in his Friendships: and though He
had great Candour towards others in the Differences of Religion, He was
zealously, and deliberately fixed in the Principles both of the Doctrine, and
Discipline of the Church: yet He used to say to his nearest Friends, in
that Time, when He expected another Kind of Calm for the Remainder
of his Life, “though He had some glimmering Light of, and Inclination
to Virtue in his Nature, that the whole Progress of his Life had been
full of desperate Hazards; and that only the merciful Hand of God Al∣mighty
had prevented his being both an unfortunate, and a vicious Man:”
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and He still said, that “God had vouchsafed that signal Goodness to him,
for the Piety, and exemplar Virtue of his Father, and Mother;” whose
Memory He had always in Veneration; and He was pleased with what
his nearest Ally, and Bosom Friend Serjeant <HI>Hyde</HI> (who was afterwards
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
Chief Justice of the King's Bench) used at that Time to say of him, that
his Cousin had passed his Time very luckily; and with notable Success;
and was like to be very happy in the World; but He would never advise
any of his Friends to walk in the same Paths, or to tread in his Steps.</P>
<P>IT was about the Year 1639,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General State of <HI>Europe.</HI> A. D. 1639.</NOTE> when He was little more than thirty
Years of Age; and when <HI>England</HI> enjoyed the greatest Measure of Feli∣city,
that it had ever known; the two Crowns of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> wor∣rying
each other, by their mutual Incursions, and Invasions; whilst They
had both a Civil War in their own Bowels; the former, by frequent Re∣bellions
from their own Factions, and Animosities; the latter, by the De∣fection<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and both laboured more to ransack, and burn each
other's Dominions, than to extinguish their own Fire. All <HI>Germany</HI>
welt'ring in it's own Blood; and contributing to each other's Destruction,
that the poor Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> might grow great out of their Ruins, and
at their Charge. <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> being Adventurers in the same de∣structive
Enterprizes. <HI>Holland,</HI> and the united Provinces wearied, and tired
with their long, and chargeable War, how prosperous soever They were
in it; and beginning to be more afraid of <HI>France,</HI> their Ally, than of
<HI>Spain,</HI> their Enemy. <HI>Italy,</HI> every Year infested by the Arms of <HI>Spain,</HI> and
<HI>France;</HI> which divided the Princes thereof into the several Factions.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>OF all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> the King of <HI>England</HI> alone seemed to be
seated upon that pleasant Promontory, that might safely view the tragick
Sufferings of all his Neighbours about him, without any other Concern∣ment,
than what arose from his own princely Heart, and christian Com∣passion,
to see such Desolation wrought by the Pride, and Passion, and
Ambition of private Persons, supported by Princes, who knew not what
themselves would have. His three Kingdoms flourishing in entire Peace,
and universal Plenty; in Danger of nothing but their own Surfeits; and
his Dominions every Day enlarged, by sending out Colonies upon large,
and fruitful Plantations; his strong Fleets commanding all Seas; and the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
numerous Shipping of the Nation bringing the Trade of the World into
his Ports; nor could it with unquestionable Security be carried any whi∣ther
else; and all these Blessings enjoyed, under a Prince of the greatest
Clemency, and Justice, and of the greatest Piety, and Devotion, and the most
indulgent to his Subjects, and most solicitous for their Happiness and Pros∣perity.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>O fortunati nimium, bona si sua nôrint!</HEAD>
<P>IN this blessed Conjuncture, when no other Prince thought He wanted
any Thing, to compass what He most desired to be possessed of, but the
Affection and Friendship of the King of <HI>England;</HI> a small, scarce discern∣able<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Cloud arose in the North; which was shortly after attended with such
a Storm, that never gave over raging, till it had shaken, and even rooted
up the greatest, and tallest Cedars of the three Nations; blasted all its
Beauty and Fruitfulness; brought its Strength to Decay, and its Glory to
Reproach, and almost to Desolation; by such a Career, and Deluge of
Wickedness, and Rebellion, as by not being enough foreseen, or, in Truth,
suspected, could not be prevented.</P>
<P>UPON the Rebellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Year 1640, the King called a
Parliament; which met according to Summons, upon the 3d of <HI>April.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was chosen to serve for two Places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> chosen Mem¦ber for <HI>Wot∣ton Basset.</HI></NOTE> for the Borough of <HI>Wotton∣Basset</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
in the County of <HI>Wilts;</HI> and for the Borough of <HI>Shaftesbury,</HI> in the
County of <HI>Dorset;</HI> but made choice to serve for his Neighbours of the
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
former Place; and so a new Writ issued for the Choice of another Burgess
for <HI>Shaftesbury.</HI></P>
<P>THE next Day after Mr. <HI>Pym</HI> had recapitulated the whole Series
of the Grievances, and Miscarriages, which had been in the State;
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told the House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His first Speech in the House of Com∣mons.</NOTE> that “that worthy Gentleman had omitted
one Grievance, more heavy than (as He thought) many of the others;
which was, the Earl Marshal's Court: a Court newly erected, without
Colour, or Shadow of Law, which took upon it to fine, and imprison
the King's Subjects; and to give great Damages for Matters which the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Law gave no Damages for.” He repeated a pleasant Story of a Citizen,
who being rudely treated, for more than his Fare came to, by a Water∣man,
who pressing him, still shewed his Crest, or Badge upon his Coat,
the Citizen bad him begone <HI>with his Goose;</HI> whereas it was in Truth, a
Swan, the Crest of an Earl, whose Servant the Waterman was; where∣upon
the Citizen was called into the Marshal's Court, and after a long, and
chargeable Attendance, was, <HI>for the opprobrious dishonouring the Earl's
Crest, by calling the Swan a Goose,</HI> fined, and imprisoned, till He had paid
considerable Damages to the Lord, or at least to the Waterman; which
really undid the Citizen.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>HE told them another Story as ridiculous, of a Gentleman, who owing
his Taylor a long Time, a good Sum of Money for Cloaths, and his Tay∣lor
coming one Day to his Chamber, with more than ordinary Impor∣tunity
for his Debt, and not receiving any good Answer, threatened to
arrest him; upon which the Gentleman enraged, gave him very ill Words,
called him base Fellow, and laid his Hands upon him, to thrust him out
of his Chamber; in this Struggle, and under this Provocation, Oppression,
and Reproach, the poor Taylor chanced to say, that He was as good a
Man as the other; for which Words He was called into the Marshal's
Court; and for his Peace, was content to be satisfied his Debt, out of his
<MILESTONE N="30"/>own ill Manners; being compelled to release all his other Demands in
Lieu of Damages. The Case was known by many, and detested by all.</P>
<P>HE told them, that “there was an Appendant to that Court, which
He called the Pageantry of it, the Heralds, who were as grievous to
the Gentry, as the Court was to the People. He said, that sure the
Knights of that House, when They received that Honour from the
King, though They might think themselves obliged to live at a higher
Rate, yet They believed, that They might die as good cheap as other
Men; He told them They could not, it would cost them ten Pounds
more; and yet a Gentleman could not die for nothing.” The Heralds
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had procured such an Order from the Earl Marshal, to force all Persons
to pay at their Funerals, such several Sums, according to their several De∣grees.
He concluded with a Desire, that when the Wisdom of that House
provided Remedies against the other Grievances, it would likewise secure
the Subject against this Exorbitance. This Representation was very ac∣ceptable
to the House, both in Respect of the Matter, which was odious
enough; and in Regard of the Person that usurped that monstrous Ju∣risdiction,
who was in no Degree grateful to them; upon whom He that
made the Motion, had not made the least Reflection. The Modesty of that
Time not permitting the Mention of great Men, with any Reproach, un∣til
<MILESTONE N="50"/>their Offences were first examined, and proved; and this being the
first Part He had acted upon that Stage, brought him much Applause;
and He was ever afterwards heard with great Benignity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He endeavours to prevent the Dissolution of the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE></P>
<P>UPON the warm Debate in the House of Commons, concerning the
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
giving the King Money, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> observed by the several Discourses
of many of the Court, who were of near Admission to the King,
and Queen, and like to make probable Guesses, that They believed, the
King would be so much displeased at the Proceedings of the House, that
He would dissolve them; which He believed would prove the most fatal
Resolution could be taken. As soon as the House was up, He went over
to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to the Archbishop; whom He found walking in his Garden,
having received a full Account of all that had passed, from Persons who
had made more Haste from the House. He appeared sad, and full of
Thoughts; and calling the other to him, seemed willing to hear what He<MILESTONE N="10"/>
would say. He told him, “that He would not trouble him with the Re∣lation
of any Thing that had passed, of which He presumed He had re∣ceived
a good Account; that his Business was only to inform him of his
own Fears and Apprehensions; and the Observation He had made
upon the Discourses of some considerable Men of the Court; as if the
King might be wrought upon, because there had not been that Expe∣dition
used as He expected, speedily to dissolve the Parliament. That
He came only to beseech him to use all his Credit, to prevent such a des∣perate
Counsel; which would produce great Mischief to the King, and
to the Church: that He was confident the House was as well constituted<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and disposed, as ever House of Commons was, or would be: that the Num∣ber
of the disaffected to Church, or State, was very small; and though
They might obstruct for some Time the quick resolving upon what was
fit, They would never be able to pervert their good Inclinations, and
Desires to serve the King.”</P>
<P>THE Archbishop heard him very patiently, and said, He believed the
King would be very angry at the Way of their Proceedings; for that in
this Conjuncture, the delaying, and denying to do what He desired, was
the same Thing; and therefore He believed it probable that He would
dissolve them; without which He could not enter upon other Counsels.<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that for his own Part, He was resolved to deliver no Opinion; but as He
would not persuade the Dissolution, which might be attended by Conse∣quences
He could not foresee, so He had not so good an Opinion of their
Affections to the King, or the Church, as to persuade their longer Sitting,
if the King were inclined to dissolve them. As He actually did on the 4th
or 5th of <HI>May,</HI> not three Weeks after their first Meeting.</P>
<P>THE Temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is again returned to serve in Par∣liament.</NOTE> and Constitution of both Houses of Parliament, which
the King was forced to call shortly after, and met on the 3d of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI>
1640, was very different from the last: and They discovered not
more Prejudice against any Man, than against Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> who was again<MILESTONE N="40"/>
returned to serve there, and whom They were sorry to find amongst
them; as a Man They knew well to have great Affection for the Arch∣bishop;
and of unalterable Devotion to the Government of the Church;
and therefore They first laboured to find some Defect in his Election;
and then to irreconcile those towards him, who They found had any
Esteem, or Kindness for him: but not finding the Success in either, an∣swerable
to their Expectation, They lived fairly towards him; and en∣deavoured
by several Applications, to gain Credit with him; who re∣turned
them their own Civilities; having had very particular Acquaintance
with many of them, whom He as much endeavoured to preserve from<MILESTONE N="50"/>
being prevailed upon.</P>
<P>WITHIN few Days after their Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He procures the suppression of the Earl Marshal's Court.</NOTE> He renewed the Motion He
had made in the last Parliament, against the Marshal's Court, (though
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
He knew the Earl Marshal had gotten himself much into their Favour,
by his Application, and some Promises He had made to them at the
Meeting at <HI>York;</HI> and principally by his declared Aversion, and Prejudice
to the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> and told them what extravagant Proceedings
there had been in that Court, since the Dissolution of the last Parliament;
and that more Damages had been given there, by the sole Judgment of
the Lord Marshal, for contumelious and reproachful Words, of which the
Law took no Notice, in two Days, than had been given by all the Juries,
in all the Courts in <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI> in the whole Term, and the Days
<MILESTONE N="10"/>for Trial after it was ended. Upon which He got a Committee to be
named, of which himself sat in the Chair; and found that the first Pre∣cedent
They had in all their Records, for that Form of Proceeding, which
They had used, and for giving of Damages for Words, was but in the
Year 1633; and the very Entrance upon this Inquisition, put an End to
that upstart Court, which never presumed to fit afterwards; and so that
Grievance was thoroughly abolished. And to manifest how great an Im∣pression
the Alarums of this Kind made upon the highest, and the proud∣est
Natures, the very next <HI>Sunday</HI> after this Motion was made in the
House of Commons, the Earl Marshal, seeing Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> in the Closet at
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>Whitehall,</HI> during the Time of the Sermon, He came with great Cour∣tesy
to him, thanked him for having treated his Person so civilly, when
upon so just Reason He had found fault with some of his Actions: said,
He believed He had been in the Wrong; but that He had been misled by
the Advice of Sir <HI>Harry Martin,</HI> and other Civilians, who were held
Men of great Learning, and who assured him, that those Proceedings were
just, and lawful. He said, They had gained well by it, but should mis∣lead
him no more: and concluded with great Professions of Kindness, and
Esteem; and offered him all Offices in his Power; when in his Heart, He
did him the Honour to detest, and hate him perfectly; as He professed
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to all whom He trusted.</P>
<P>His Credit grew every Day in the House, in Spite of all the Endea∣deavours,
which were used to lessen it. And it being evident, that He
had no Dependance upon the Court; and insisted wholly upon maintain∣ing
what the Law had established, very many wise Men, and of Estate,
and Reputation in the Kingdom (who observed well the crooked,
and ambitious Designs of those, who desired to be thought to care
only for the good of their Country) adhered to him; and were willing
to take Advice from him, how to prevent those Miseries, which were like
to be brought upon the Kingdom: so that They who had cut out all the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Work from the Beginning, and seldom met with any notable Contradiction,
found themselves now frequently disappointed; and different Resolutions
taken, to what They had proposed; which They imputed to his Activity.</P>
<P>HE was very much in the Business of the House; the greatest Chair∣man
in the Committees of the greatest Moment; and very diligent in at∣tending
the Service both in the House, and at Committees: for He had
from the Beginning of the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He lays aside his Gown, and gives himself wholly to pub∣lick Busi∣ness.</NOTE> laid aside his Gown, and Practice,
and wholly given himself up to the publick Business; which He saw so
much concerned the Peace, and very Being of the Kingdom. He was
in the Chair in that Committee which considered of the Illegality of the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Court of <HI>York:</HI> and the other, that examined the Miscarriage of the Judges,
in the Case of Ship-Money, and in other Cases of Judicatory, in their
several Courts; and prepared Charges thereupon against them. He was
in the Chair against the Marshal's Court. In that Committee which was
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
against the Court of <HI>York,</HI> which was prosecuted with great Passion, and
took up many Weeks Debate: In that which concerned the Jurisdiction
of the Lord President, and Council, of the Marches of <HI>Wales;</HI> which
likewise held a long Time, and was prosecuted with great Bitter∣ness,
and Animosity: In which the Inhabitants of the four neighbour
Counties of <HI>Salop, Worcester, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> and consequent∣ly
the Knights, and Burgesses which served for the same, were pas∣sionately
concerned to absolve themselves from the Burthen of that Ju∣risdiction;
and all the Officers of that Court, and Council, whereof some
were very great Men, and held Offices of great Value, laboured with equal<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Passion, and Concernment, to support, and maintain what was in Prac∣tice,
and Possession; and their Friends appeared accordingly.</P>
<P>HE was in the Chair in many Committees made upon private Com∣plaints:
insomuch as He was seldom in the Afternoon free from that Ser∣vice
in the Committees; as He was never absent in Mornings from the
House: and He was often heard to mention one private Committee, in
which He was put accidentally into the Chair, upon an Inclosure which
had been made of great Waste, belonging to some of the Queen's Ma∣nors,
without the Consent of the Tenants, the Benefit whereof had been
given by the Queen to a Servant of near Trust; who forthwith sold the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Lands inclosed to the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> Lord Privy Seal; who together
with his Son <HI>Mandevil,</HI> were now most concerned to maintain the In∣closure;
against which, as well the Inhabitants of other Manors, who
claimed Common in those Wastes, as the Queen's Tenants of the same,
made loud Complaints, as a great Oppression, carried upon them with a
very high Hand, and supported by Power.</P>
<P>THE Committee sat in the Queen's Court;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Cause of</HI> Oli∣ver Crom∣well's <HI>Enmity to him.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> being
one of them, appeared much concerned to countenance the Petitioners, who
were numerous, together with their Witnesses; the Lord <HI>Mandevil</HI> being
likewise present as a Party, and by the Direction of the Committee, sitting<MILESTONE N="30"/>
covered: <HI>Cromwell</HI> (who had never before been heard to speak in the House
of Commons) ordered the Witnesses, and Petitioners in the Method of the
Proceeding; and seconded, and enlarged upon what They said with great
Passion; and the Witnesses, and Persons concerned, who were a very rude
Kind of People, interrupted the Council, and Witnesses on the other Side,
with great Clamour, when They said any Thing that did not please them;
so that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (whose Office it was to oblige Men of all Sorts to keep
Order) was compelled to use some sharp Reproofs, and some Threats, to
reduce them to such a Temper, that the Business might be quietly heard.
<HI>Cromwell</HI> in great Fury reproached the Chairman for being partial, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that He discountenanced the Witnesses by threatening them; the Other
appealed to the Committee, which justified him, and declared, that He
behaved himself as He ought to do; which more enflamed him, who was
already too much angry. When upon any Mention of Matter of Fact, or
the Proceeding before, and at the Inclosure, the Lord <HI>Mandevil</HI> desired
to be heard, and with great Modesty related what had been done, or ex∣plained
what had been said, Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> did answer, and reply upon
him, with so much Indecency, and Rudeness, and in Language, so con∣trary,
and offensive, that every Man would have thought, that as their
Natures, and their Manners were as opposite as it is possible, so their In∣terest<MILESTONE N="50"/>
could never have been the same. In the End, his whole Carriage
was so tempestuous, and his Behaviour so insolent, that the Chairman found
himself obliged to reprehend him; and to tell him, if He proceeded in
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
the same Manner, He would presently adjourn the Committee; and the
next Morning complain to the House of him; which He never forgave;
and took all Occasions afterwards to pursue him with the utmost Malice
and Revenge, to his Death.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> sat in the Chair, in the grand Committee of the
House, for the Extirpation of Episcopacy, all that Party made great
Court to him; and the House keeping those disorderly Hours, and seldom
rising till after four of the Clock in the Afternoon, They frequently im∣portuned
him to dine with them, at Mr. <HI>Pym</HI>'s Lodging, which was at
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Sir <HI>Richard Manly</HI>'s House, in a little Court behind <HI>Westminster Hall;</HI>
where He, and Mr. <HI>Hambden,</HI> Sir <HI>Arthur Haslerig,</HI> and two or three
more, upon a Stock kept a Table, where They transacted much Business;
and invited thither those, of whose Conversion They had any Hope.</P>
<P>ONE Day after Dinner, <HI>Nathaniel Fiennes,</HI> who that Day likewise dined
there, asked Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> whether He would ride into the Fields, and
take a little Air, it being a fine Evening; which the other consenting to,
They sent for their Horses, and riding together in the Fields, between
<HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>Chelsea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Conversa∣tion with</HI> Nat. Fiennes.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Fiennes</HI> asked him, what it was that in∣clined
him to adhere so passionately to the Church, which could not pos∣sibly
<MILESTONE N="20"/>be supported. He answered, that He could have no other Obliga∣tion
than that of his own Conscience, and his Reason, that could move
with him; for He had no Relation, or Dependance upon any Church∣men,
that could dispose him to it; that He could not conceive, how
Religion could be preserved without Bishops; nor how the Government
of the State could well subsist, if the Government of the Church were
altered; and asked him what Government They meant to introduce in its
Place: To which He answered, that there would be Time enough to
think of that; but assured him, and wished him to remember what He
said, that if the King resolved to defend the Bishops, it would cost the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Kingdom much Blood; and would be the Occasion of as sharp a War,
as had ever been in <HI>England:</HI> for that there was a great Number of good
Men, who resolved to lose their Lives, before They would ever submit to
that Government. Which was the first positive Declaration He had ever
heard from any particular Man of that Party; very few of them having
at that Time that Resolution, much less avowing it; and if They had, the
Kingdom was in no Degree at that Time infected with that Poison, how
much soever it was spread afterwards.</P>
<P>WITHIN two Days after this Discourse from Mr. <HI>Fiennes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI>
walking between the Parliament House, and <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the Church∣Yard
<MILESTONE N="40"/>met with <HI>Harry Martin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And with</HI> Harry Mar∣tin.</NOTE> with whom He lived very familiarly;
and speaking together about the Proceedings of the Houses, <HI>Martin</HI> told
him, that He would undo himself by his adhering to the Court; to
which He replied, that He had no Relation to the Court, and was only
concerned to maintain the Government, and preserve the Law: and then
told him He could not conceive what He proposed to himself, for He did
not think him to be of the Opinion, or Nature with those Men, who go∣verned
the House; and asked him, what He thought of such, and such Men;
and He very frankly answered, that He thought them Knaves; and that
when They had done as much as They intended to do, They should be
<MILESTONE N="50"/>used as They had used others. The other pressed him then to say what He
desired;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who own<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself a Re∣publican.</NOTE> to which, after a little Pause, He very roundly answered, <HI>I do not
think one Man wise enough to govern us all:</HI> which was the first Word He
had ever heard any Man speak to that Purpose; and would without
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
Doubt, if it had been then communicated, or attempted, been the most
abhorred by the whole Nation, of any Design that could be mentioned;
and yet it appears it had even so early entered into the Hearts of some des∣perate
Persons; that Gentleman being at that Time possessed of a very
great Fortune, and having great Credit in his Country.</P>
<P>WHILST Things were thus depending, one Morning, when there was
a Conference with the Lords, and so the House adjourned, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
being walking in the House, Mr. <HI>Peircy,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI>
being a Member of the House, came to him, and told him, that
the King would speak with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>is sent for by the King.</HI></NOTE> and would have him that Afternoon to<MILESTONE N="10"/>
come to him. He answered, He believed it was some Mistake, for that
He had not the Honour to be known to the King; and that there was
another of the same Name, of the House. Mr. <HI>Peircy</HI> assured him,
He was the Man; and so it was agreed, that at such an Hour in
the Evening, He would call on him at his Chamber; which He did, and
was by him conducted into the Gallery, and so into the square Room;
where He staid till the other went to the King; who in a very short Time
came thither, attended only by Mr. <HI>Peircy,</HI> who as soon as Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had
kissed his Majesty's Hand, withdrew.</P>
<P>THE King told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Discourse with him.</NOTE> “that He heard from all Hands, how much He<MILESTONE N="20"/>
was beholden to him; and that when all his Servants in the House of
Commons either neglected his Service, or could not appear usefully in
it, He took all Occasions to do him Service; for which He thought fit
to give him his own Thanks, and to assure him, that He would remem∣ber
it to his Advantage.” He took Notice of his Affection to the Church,
for which, He said, “He thanked him more than for all the rest;” which
the other acknowledged with the Duty that became him; and said, “He
was very happy, that his Majesty was pleased with what He did; but if
He had commanded him to have withdrawn his Affection, and Reve∣rence
for the Church, He would not have obeyed him;” which his Ma∣jesty<MILESTONE N="30"/>
said, made him love him the better. Then He discoursed of the
Passion of the House; and of the Bill then brought in against Episcopacy;
and asked him, “whether He thought They would be able to carry it;”
to which He answered, “He believed They could not, at least, that it
would be very long first.” “Nay (replied the King) if you'll look to
it, that They do not carry it before I go for <HI>Scotland,</HI> which will be
at such a Time, when the Armies shall be disbanded, I will undertake
for the Church after that Time; why then (said the other) by the
Grace of God, it will not be in much Danger:” with which the King
was well pleased; and dismissed him with very gracious Expressions.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
And this was the first Introduction of him to the King's taking Notice
of him.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS in that Summer, during the Time of his Majesty's
Stay in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> (who then kept the Signet, though
He was not sworn Secretary till the King's Return) being very sick, sent
to him, to desire to speak with him; whereupon He went to him to
his House in <HI>King's-Street;</HI> and found him in his Bed: and the Business
was wholly to shew him a Letter from the King to him, in which He
writ to him, that He understood by several Hands, that He was very much
beholden to Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> for the great Zeal He shewed to his Service; and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
therefore commanded him to speak with him, and to let him know the
Sense He had of it; and that when He returned, He would let him know
it himself.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="50"/>
HAVING now taken a View of him from his Birth; and through his
whole Youth, and first Entrance into the Business of the World, in which
He had great Success, and Prosperity (and if the Calm, in which He was
born, and lasted so long, had continued, no Man could with more Pro∣bability
have promised himself better Fortune, in the Profession to which He
had dedicated himself) and having now brought him to be known to the
King; and the Tempest that from the present foul Weather shortly after
broke out, driving him from farther applying himself to, or prosecuting
that Profession; and the Parliament making some short Recess, during the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>King's being in <HI>Scotland;</HI> we will here conclude the first Part of his Life,
and enter upon the second; which will contain a more important Part;
and in which We will mention no Particulars of that active Time, but
such in which He had a signal Part; leaving the rest to the History of
those great, and monstrous Actions.</P>

<HEAD>PART the SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Remonstrance of the State of the Nation, and its
particular Grievances, was (by Order of the House of Com∣mons)
printed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>draws up an Answer to the Parliament's Remonstrance.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> only to give Vent to his own Indig∣nation,
and without the least Purpose of communicating it, or that any
Use should be made of it, had drawn such a full Answer to it, as the
Subject would have enabled any Man to have done, who had thought of
it: and the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who had much Conversation and Friendship with
him, coming accidentally and suddenly into the Room, where He was
alone amongst his Books and Papers; conferring together of the extravagant
Proceedings of the Parliament, He, upon the Familiarity that was be∣tween<MILESTONE N="10"/>
them, and upon the Argument that was then between them, read
the Answer to him which He had prepared to the Remonstrance; with
which He seemed much pleased, and desired him that He would permit it
to be made Use of by the King, and that He might shew it to his Majesty;
who found it absolutely necessary to publish some Answer in his own
Name to that Remonstrance, which had so much poisoned the Hearts of
the People; and that his Majesty was endeavouring to procure such an
Answer to be drawn. The other expresly and positively refused to give it
him, or that any Use should be made of it; and reproached him for pro∣posing
a Thing to him, which might prove ruinous to him, if the House<MILESTONE N="20"/>
should have the least Imagination, that He exercised himself in such Of∣fices;
with which Answer He seemed satisfied, and departed: no other
Person having seen it but the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> from whom Nothing was
ever concealed.</P>
<P>WITHIN few Days after, the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> with whom the King advised
in the Business of the Parliament without Reserve, came again to him;
and after some Apologies, told him freely, that very many had been with
the King, desiring him that He would take Care that some Answer might
be published to that Remonstrance; which had already done much Harm,
and would do much more if it were not answered; and that the King had<MILESTONE N="30"/>
spoken to him; upon which He had confessed that He had seen an Answer,
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
that pleased him very well; but could not prevail with the Author of it to
suffer it to be made Use of; and told him who it was: whereupon the King
seemed to wonder very much, that a Person who had appeared so pub∣lickly
in Defence of his Service, should be so wary of assisting him in pri∣vate:
and after many Expressions of Grace towards that Gentleman, his
Majesty had commanded him to come in his Name to him; and to conjure
him to send that Paper to him; and to give him his Royal Word, that no
Person living should know that He had the least Hand in it; so that no
Danger should accrue to him thereby.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>MR. HYDE, though He was very unsatisfied with what the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>
had done (whose Affection to him He did not in any Degree make Ques∣tion
of, but did not like his over Activity, to which his restless Fancy
always disposed him; and as He doubted not, that himself had given the
Occasion to the King to send those Commands, so He had likewise enlarged
those Commands, as He believed, in such a Manner as He thought might
most oblige him) yet upon the real Consideration that it might do the King
much Service, He did without Delay deliver the Papers: insisting upon
the Promise of Secrecy, and likewise, that his Majesty would not publish,
without first communicating it to his Council, and as done with their
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Advice. And to that Purpose He affixed that Title to it, before He deli∣vered
the Papers out of his Hands; believing that as it would be more for
the King's Service to carry such an Authority in the Front of it, as <HI>The
King's Answer with the Advice of his Council;</HI> so it could not be refused by
them, and yet might engage them in some Displeasure with the House of
Commons, which probably might be offended at it. The King was very
punctual in doing what was desired; and caused it to be read at a full
Council; where many of the Lords commended it very much, and none
spake against it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which by the King's Com∣mand is print∣ed.</NOTE> and so it was published and printed: and it was very ap∣parent
to all Men, that the King's Service was very much advanced by it:
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and it was not more evident to any, than to the House of Commons; who
knew not how to make any Expostulation upon it, it being in the King's
own Name, and published with the Advice of his Privy Council; so that
all They could do, was to endeavour to discover who was the Penner of
it; to which Discovery They were most intent by all their secret Friends
in Court; who found Means to discover most other Secrets to them, but in
this could do them no Service.</P>
<P>AS soon as the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> were called to the
Privy Council, the King sent for Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> to him, who had not seen his
Majesty from the Time He had been presented by Mr. <HI>Peircy.</HI> He com∣manded
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> to bring him when it was Night to the Queen's
back Stairs; and as soon as He was there, both King and Queen came into
the Room; and when He had kissed their Hands, and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was
withdrawn, the King told him “He was much beholden to him for many
good Services; and that now He had preferred two of his Friends, it
was Time to give him some Testimony of his Favour; and therefore He
had sent to him to tell him, that He intended to make him his Solicitor-General,
in the Place of him who had served him so ill.” Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> sud∣denly
answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>declines the Office of Soli∣citor General.</HI></NOTE> “God forbid!” With which the King seeming surprised,
said “why God forbid?” The other replied, “it was in no Degree fit at
<MILESTONE N="50"/>this Time that He should remove the other; and if He were removed,
himself was in no Degree fit for it.” The Queen said, “He ought not to
suffer for his Modesty: She had heard Men who could judge well, say,
that He was as fit for it as the other.” Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> said “that was an Ar∣gument
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
that Gentleman thought the other not fit for it, not that He be∣lieved
<HI>him</HI> fit; which in Truth He said He was not. That it might be,
that when the Place was actually void, the King might have filled it
better with another Man, than with Mr. <HI>St. John;</HI> whose Parts were
not above many others; and his Affections were below most Mens: But
now that He was invested in that Office, it was not a good Con∣juncture
to remove him; and when it should be, He did humbly advise
his Majesty to make Choice of the ablest Man of the Profession, whose
Affections were clear; by whom He might indeed have great Benefit;
whereas himself was young, and without any of that Learning, or Ex∣perience,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which might make him capable of that great Trust.” The
Queen saying again this was his Modesty, He replied, “Madam when
you know me better, you will not find me so modest a Man, but that I
hope by your Majesty's Favour in due Time to be made a better Man,
than I am at present; but if you believe that I know any Thing of the
Disposition of the present Time, or of what may conduce to the King's
Service, I pray believe, that though the Solicitor will never do much
Service, He will be able to do much more Mischief if He be removed.”
The King at the same Time resolved to remove another Officer, who did
disserve him notoriously, and to prefer Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> to that Place; with which<MILESTONE N="20"/>
their gracious Intention both their Majesties acquainted him; but He po∣sitively
refused it; and assured both their Majesties, that He should be able
to do much more Service in the Condition He was in.</P>
<P>BEFORE the King left <HI>Whitehall</HI> He renewed his Commands to the three
Persons mentioned before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is entrust∣ed with the Conduct of the King's Affairs in Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> the Lord Viscount <HI>Falkland,</HI> Sir <HI>John Colepep∣per,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> to meet constantly together, and consult upon his
Affairs; and conduct them the best Way They could in the Parliament;
and to give him constant Advice what He was to do; without which He
declared again very solemnly He would make no Step in the Parliament.
Two of them were obliged by their Offices and Relations, and the other by<MILESTONE N="30"/>
his Duty and Inclination, to give him all Satisfaction; notwithstanding
the Discouragement They had so lately received, in the King's going to
the House to demand the five Members, without ever communicating his
Intention to them; and which had made a deep Impression upon them.
And so They met every Night late together; and communicated their Ob∣servation
and Intelligence of the Day; and so agreed what was to be done,
or attempted the next; there being very many Persons of Condition and
Interest in the House, who would follow their Advice, and assist in any
Thing They desired. And because Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had larger Accommodation,
in the House where He lived in <HI>Westminster,</HI> than either of the other had,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the Meetings at Night were for the most Part with him; and after their
Deliberation together, what was to be put in Writing was always commit∣ted
to Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> and when the King had left the Town, He writ as
freely to the King as either of the other did; and sometimes when They
would be excused, He went to him in great Secret.</P>
<P>HE had been from the Beginning very unbeloved by all the governing
Party; and though They took some Pains at first to win him, yet their
Hope of that was quickly desperate; and from the Night of the Protesta∣tion,
He was as much in their Detestation as any Man; and the more,
that They could take no Advantage against him: and though They had a<MILESTONE N="50"/>
better Opinion of his Discretion, than to believe He had any Share in the
Advice of the late Proceedings, yet They were very willing that others
should believe it; and made all the Infusions They could to that Pur∣pose
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
amongst those, who took their Opinions from them; towards which
his known Friendship with the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was an Argument very pre∣valent;
and then his opposing the Votes upon their Privilege, had in∣flamed
them beyond their Temper; insomuch as Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> told him
one Day, that the Trouble that had lately befallen them, had been at∣tended
with that Benefit, that They knew who were their Friends: and
the other offering to speak upon the Point of Privilege, and how mon∣strous
a Thing it was to make a Vote so contrary to the known Law; He
replied very snappishly, “that He well knew He had a Mind They should
<MILESTONE N="10"/>be all in Prison,” and so departed without staying for an Answer. Then
They imputed to him the disposing the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> to serve the Court;
and the Court to receive his Service; and from the Time that He and <HI>Cole∣pepper</HI>
were called to the Council, They equally were enraged against both:
and now, when They had discovered the Place of the nightly Meetings, that
a Secretary of State, and a Chancellor of the Exchequer, every Day went
to the Lodging of a private Person, who ought to attend them, They believed
it a Condescension that had some other Foundation than mere Ci∣vility;
yet They could not discover any Thing against them, which They
thought fit to offer in Publick.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>IT is not amiss in this Place to say somewhat of those three Persons,
who had from that Time so great a Part in the Business that was upon
the Stage; and did in a short Time raise the Reputation of the King, and
of his Cause, to a very great Degree; and who, though They were well
united in the Opposition of all the ill Designs against the Crown; and
concurred in the publick Service with necessary, and mutual Civilities to∣wards
each other; yet their Principles, and Constitutions were very dif∣ferent;
and the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (between whom, as is said
before, the Friendship was most entire) had never had the least Acquaint∣ance
with Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> before the Parliament; and finding them∣selves
<MILESTONE N="30"/>often of one Opinion, grew into some Conversation; and being af∣ter
united in the King's Trust, They rarely conferred but in the Agita∣tion
of Business; their Natures being in nothing like.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> though He was a Man of a chearful Conversation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some Account of the Temper and Principles of Lord</HI> Falk∣land.</NOTE>
was of a severe Nature, and a Lover of Virtue; yet He had great Esteem
for all Men of great Parts, though They applied them to ill Purposes.
He was so great an Enemy to all Dissimulation, that He chose sometimes
the other Extreme, when it was not requisite. He had not the Court in
great Reverence; and had a presaging Spirit that the King would fall into
great Misfortune: and often said to his Friend, that He chose to serve the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>King, because Honesty obliged him to it; but that He foresaw his own
Ruin by doing it. He had a better Opinion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and the Religion of it, than of any other Church, and Religion; and had
extraordinary Kindness for very many Churchmen; and if He could have
helped, or prevented it, there should have been no Attempts against it.
But He had in his own Judgment such a Latitude in Opinion, that He
did not believe any Part of the Order, or Government of it, to be so es∣sentially
necessary to Religion, but that it might be parted with, and al∣tered,
for a notable publick Benefit, or Convenience: and that the Crown
itself ought to gratify the People, in yielding to many Things; and to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>part with some Power, rather than to run the Hazards, which would at∣tend
the Refusal. But He was swayed in this by a Belief, that the King
would in the End be prevailed with to yield to what was pressed; and this
Opinion wrought too much upon too many.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55"/>
ALBEIT He had the greatest Compliance with the Weakness, and even
the Humour of other Men, when there could be no Suspicion of Flattery;
and the greatest Address to inform, and reform them; yet towards the
King, who many Times obstinately adhered to many Conclusions, which
did not naturally result from good Premises; and did love to argue many
Things, to which He would not so positively adhere, He did not practise
that Condescension; but contradicted him with more Bluntness, and by
sharp Sentences; and in some Particulars (as of the Church) to which
the King was in Conscience most devoted: and of this his Majesty often
complained; and cared less to confer with him in private, and was less<MILESTONE N="10"/>
persuaded by him, than his Affairs, and the other's great Parts, and Wis∣dom
would have required: thought He had not a better Opinion of any
Man's Sincerity, or Fidelity towards him.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Colepepper</HI> had spent some Years of his Youth in foreign Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> John Colepepper.</NOTE>
and especially in Armies; where He had seen good Service, and very well
observed it; and might have made a very good Officer, if He had intended
it. He was of a rough Nature; a hot Head; and of great Courage;
which had engaged him in many Quarrels, and Duels; wherein He still
behaved himself very signally. He had in a very good Season, and after
a small Waste of his Fortune, retired from that Course of Life, and mar∣ried,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and betook himself to a Country Life; and studied the Business of
the Country, and the Concernments of it, in which He was very well
versed; and being a Man of Sharpness of Parts, and Volubility of Lan∣guage,
He was frequently made Choice of to appear at the Council-Board,
in those Matters which related to the Country: in the managing whereof,
his Abilities were well taken Notice of. His Estate was very moderate,
and his usual Expense exceeded it not; not being delighted with Delica∣cies
of any Nature, or indeed ever acquainted with them. He had Infir∣mities,
which sometimes made a Noise; but his Parts, and Abilities made
him very acceptable to his Neighbours, and to those who were most con∣siderable<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in their Estates, and most popular; so that with very little Op∣position,
He had been chosen to be Knight of that great County <HI>Kent</HI>
for the Parliament; where He quickly made himself to be taken Notice
of. He was proud, and ambitious, and very much disposed to improve
his Fortune; which He knew well how to do, by Industry, and Thrift,
without stooping to any corrupt Ways, to which He was not inclined.</P>
<P>HE did not love the Persons of many of those who were the violent
Managers; and less their Designs: and therefore He no sooner knew that
He was well spoken of at Court, but He exposed himself to the Invi∣tation,
and heartily embraced that Interest: and when He came thither,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
He might very well be thought a Man of no very good Breeding; having
never sacrificed to the Muses, or conversed in any polite Company. He
was warm, and positive in Debates; and of present Fancy to object, and
find Fault with what was proposed; and indeed would take any Argu∣ment
in Pieces, and expose it excellently to a full View; and leave No∣thing
to Chance, or Accident, without making it foreseen; but after that,
knew not so well what to judge, and determine; and was so irresolute,
and had a Fancy so perpetually working, that after a Conclusion made,
He would the next Day, in the Execution of it, and sometimes after, raise
new Doubts, and make new Objections; which always occasioned Trouble;<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and sometimes produced Inconvenience.</P>
<P>In Matters of Religion, He was in his Judgment very indifferent; but
more inclined to what was established, to avoid the Accidents which com∣monly
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
attend a Change, without any Motives from his Conscience;
which yet He kept to himself; and was well content to have it believed
that the Activity proceeded from thence. He had, with all this uncourt∣liness
(for sure no Man less appeared a Courtier) and Ungracefulness in
his Mein, and Motion, a wonderful Insinuation and Address into the Ac∣ceptation,
and Confidence of the King, and Queen; and Flattery being
a Weed not so natural to the Air, and Soil of the Country, where He
had wholly lived, He was believed to speak with all Plainness and Since∣rity;
when no Man more complied with those Infirmities they both had;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and by that Compliance prevailed often over them.</P>
<P>HE had a very tragical Way in expressing himself, to raise the Fears
and Apprehensions of those, who were naturally apprehensive of Dangers:
and by this Means He prevailed marvellously with the Queen, in those
Matters to which She was most averse; by representing Things as dismally
to her as He could well do: and on the other Hand, to the King (who
was naturally very Sanguine) He was full of Compliance; cherished all
his Hopes, and Imaginations; and raised and improved those Hopes very
frequently by Expedients very unagreeable to the End proposed. He was
then (as was said before) very positive in his Conclusions: as if He did
<MILESTONE N="20"/>not propose a Thing that might come to pass, but what infallibly must
be so; which was a Temper the King could not contend with; and did
so much suspect himself (which was his greatest Infirmity, and the chief
Ground of all his Sufferings) that He did believe a Man of whom He
thought very well, did know every Thing that He confidently insisted
upon. But his greatest Advantage was (besides his Diligence in Speaking
as often as He could with the King, and Queen, and always with the
Queen, upon any important Counsel) that He had an entire Confidence
and Friendship with Mr. <HI>John Ashburnham,</HI> whom the King loved, and
trusted very much; and who always imprinted that Advice in the King's
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Mind, which the other had infused; and being a Member of the House,
was always ready to report the Service He did his Majesty there, as ad∣vantageously
as the Business would bear.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was in his Nature and Disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Mr. <HI>Hyde.</HI></NOTE> different from both the
other; which never begot the least Disagreement between the Lord <HI>Falk∣land</HI>
and him. He was of a very chearful and open Nature, without
any Dissimulation; and delivered his Opinion of Things or Persons, where
it was convenient, without Reserve, or Disguise; and was at least tena∣cious
enough of his Opinion, and never departed from it out of Compli∣ance
with any Man. He had a very particular Devotion and Passion for
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the Person of the King; and did believe him the most, and the best
Christian in the World. He had a most zealous Esteem and Reverence
for the Constitution of the Government; and believed it so equally pois∣ed,
that if the least Branch of the Prerogative was torn off, or parted
with, the Subject suffered by it, and that his Right was impaired: and He
was as much troubled when the Crown exceeded its just Limits, and
thought it's Prerogative hurt by it: and therefore not only never consented
to any Diminution of the King's Authority, but always wished that the
King would not consent to it, with what Importunity or Impetuosity so∣ever
it was desired and pressed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>HE had taken more Pains than such Men use to do, in the Examina∣tion
of Religion; having always conversed with those of different Opi∣nions
with all Freedom, and Affection; and had very much Kindness and
Esteem for many, who were in no Degree of his own Judgment; and
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
upon all this, He did really believe the Church of <HI>England</HI> the most ex∣actly
formed and framed for the Encouragement and Advancement of
Learning, and Piety, and for the Preservation of Peace, of any Church
in the World; That the taking away any of its Revenue, and applying
it to secular Uses, was Robbery, and notorious Sacrilege; and that the
diminishing the Lustre it had, and had always had in the Government,
by removing the Bishops out of the House of Peers, was a Violation of
Justice; the removing a Land-mark; and the shaking the very Foundation
of Government; and therefore He always opposed, upon the Impulsion
of Conscience, all Mutations in the Church; and did always believe, let<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the Season, or the Circumstance be what it would, that any Compliance
was pernicious: and that a peremptory and obstinate Refusal, that might
put Men in Despair of what They laboured for, and take away all Hope
of obtaining what They desired, would reconcile more Persons to the Go∣vernment,
than the gratifying them in Part; which only whetted their
Appetite to desire more, and their Confidence in demanding it.</P>
<P>THOUGH He was of a Complexion and Humour very far from Despair;
yet He did believe the King would be oppressed by that Party which then
governed; and that They who followed, and served him would be de∣stroyed;
so that it was not Ambition of Power, or Wealth, that engaged<MILESTONE N="20"/>
him to embark in so very hazardous an Imployment; but abstractly the
Consideration of his Duty; and He often used to apply those Words of
<HI>Cicero,</HI> to himself, <HI>Mea Aetas incidit in id Bellum cujus altera Pars Sceleris
nimium habuit, altera Felicitatis parum.</HI> It is very probable, that if his
Access at that Time had been as frequent to the King, as Sir <HI>John Cole∣pepper</HI>'s
was, or the Lord <HI>Falkland's</HI> might have been, some Things might
have been left undone, the doing whereof brought much Prejudice to the
King; for all his Principles were much more agreeable to his Majesty's
own Judgment, than those of either of the other; and what He said was
of equal Authority with him; and when any Advice was given by either<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of the other, the King usually asked, “whether <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> were of that
Opinion;” and They always very ingenuously confessed, that He was
not: but his having no Relation of Service, and so no Pretence to be seen
often at Court; and the great Jealousy that was entertained towards him,
made it necessary to him to repair only in the dark to the King upon
emergent Occasions, and leave the Rest to be imparted by the other two;
and the Differences in their Natures, and Opinions never produced any
Disunion between them in those Councils which concerned the Conduct
of the King's Service; but They proceeded with great Unanimity; and
very manifestly much advanced the King's Business, from the very low<MILESTONE N="40"/>
State it was in, when They were first trusted; the other two having al∣ways
much Deference to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who allayed their Passions;
to which They were both enough inclined.</P>
<P>WHEN the two Bills were sent to the King, <HI>for the granting the Militia,</HI>
and <HI>the removing the Bishops out of the House of Peers,</HI> most Men did
believe that the King would never give his Assent to either of these two;
though very many had concurred in them for no other Reason, than be∣cause
They were assured He would not refuse; and others upon Confi∣dence
that He would; and therefore would not render themselves obnoxi∣ous
by opposing them: upon all which the Queen continued her Resolu∣tion;<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and hastened her Journey that she might be out of the Way, and
thereby the King might the more resolutely reject those Bills, which He
intended to do; and the Houses the more importunately pressed the Dis∣patch
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
of the Bills, as soon as the Day was appointed for the Queen's be∣ginning
her Journey from <HI>Windsor</HI> towards <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Perplexity, when Nothing was so necessary as the most obsti∣nate
Resolution, Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who was naturally inclined to Ex∣pedients;
and in difficult Cases, that is, Cases made difficult, by the Per∣verseness
of supercilious Contenders, to Composition, much desired, that
the King would pass that against the Bishops, and absolutely reject the
other; which He did in Truth believe would satisfy so many, that those
that remained unsatisfied, would not have Credit enough, to give any fur∣ther
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Disturbance; and in his own Judgment, as hath been said before,
He thought the Matter of little Importance; but He knew that Argu∣ment
would make no other Impression upon the King, than to the Dis∣advantage
of the Arguer; and if He had thought himself obliged to have
enacted one, He would have chosen to have passed that for the Militia,
rather than the other; He urged therefore to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> John Colepepper <HI>advises the King to pass the Bill a∣gainst the Bishops.</HI></NOTE> no other Person
present, the Necessity of giving the Parliament Satisfaction in one of those
Bills; and that there were more who would be satisfied with that concern∣ing
the Bishops, than with the other concerning the Militia; and there∣fore
it would be best to gratify the major Part. Then He exposed the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>dreadful Consequences which would attend the yielding in the Point of
the Militia; as if it would be the next Day in their Power to depose him;
and all the tragical Effects of granting that Authority. He seemed in no
Degree to undervalue the Mischief of consenting to the Bill against the
Bishops; yet that it would be attended with that present Benefit, that the
Church would be free from farther Apprehension; and that this Degra∣dation
would secure the Function, and the Revenue; and that when
these Jealousies and Misunderstandings should be once composed, that Bill
would be easily repealed, by the Experience how much the Government
was hurt by it; and whilst the Sword remained in the King's own Hands,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>there would be no Attempt to make farther Alterations. The King asked
him, whether <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> was of that Mind; to which He answered, He
was not, nor did wish that either of the Bills should be passed, which He
thought as the Time was, could not be a reasonable Judgment; the King
said, <HI>it was his; and that He would run the Hazard.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN He found He could not prevail there, He went to the Queen;
and repeated all the Arguments He had used to the King, with his usual
Vehemence; and added, that He exceedingly apprehended that by some
Means or other, upon this Refusal of the King's, her Majesty's Journey
would be stopped; and that She would not be suffered to transport herself
<MILESTONE N="40"/>out of the Kingdom; and therefore He heartily wished that She would
so use her Credit with the King, that He might pass that Act concerning
the Bishops, which He said would lay such an Obligation upon both
Houses, as would redound to her Majesty's Advantage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is pre∣vailed on by the Queen to do so.</NOTE> The Queen was
so terrified with the Apprehension of her being hindered from pursuing
her Purpose, that She gave not over her Importunity with the King, till
She had prevailed with him; and so that Bill for removing the Bishops
out of the House of Peers was passed by Commission; when both their
Majesties were upon their Way, and in their Journey to <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING that is here said must reflect upon the Memory of Sir <HI>John
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Colepepper,</HI> as if He were corrupted in his Affections to the Church; or
gave this Advice to gratify and please other Men, or for any particular
Advantage to himself, of all which He was very innocent. It is said be∣fore,
that in his Judgment He looked upon the Thing as what might be
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
conscientiously consented to; and then his real Apprehension of Danger,
and Mischief to the King (to whom He bore all possible Fidelity) by re∣fusing
it, so far wrought upon his warm Constitution, that He did really
believe it to be his Duty to be solicitous to the vehement Degree He was.
But He quickly found He had been deceived, at least in the Imagination,
that the consenting to that one Bill would at all allay their Passion. They
were on the contrary so far from being pleased with it, that They imme∣diately
betook themselves to enquire, “who the evil Counsellors were,
who dissuaded his Majesty from consenting to the other concerning the
Militia;” which was so necessary to all their Purposes: and forthwith<MILESTONE N="10"/>
sent some of their Messengers to the King, whilst He staid at <HI>Dover,</HI> to
complain of such evil Counsel; and to use all Importunity, that He would
pass it, as a Matter of absolute Necessity for the Peace, and Security of
the Kingdom; and for the carrying on the Service for suppressing the
Rebellion in <HI>Ireland;</HI> with many new Expressions “of the Presumption
of those malignant Persons, who gave his Majesty such Advice,” and
with Boldness enough, that the King should prefer such Advice, before
the Wisdom of the Parliament.</P>
<P>THEY who hated the Bishops most,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect of this Condes∣cension on the several Par∣ties.</NOTE> and were glad that They were rid
of the Opposition They gave them in all their Demands, seemed not at<MILESTONE N="20"/>
all contented; but enlarged exceedingly upon the Mischief, in not grant∣ing
the Militia. And no Doubt there were many the less pleased with the
passing the other, in doubt, that They should thereby lose the Assistance
of very many towards the utter Extirpation of Episcopacy, and the Dis∣posal
of all Church Lands, upon which their Hearts were set; and who
would with the more Choler have concurred with them, if that Bill, as
well as the other, had been rejected; and therefore They rather wished
They had the other, which They knew would bring all their Ends to
pass. They who loved the Church, and were afraid of so great an Alte∣ration
in the Frame and Constitution of Parliament, as the utter taking<MILESTONE N="30"/>
away of one of the <HI>Three Estates,</HI> of which the Parliament is compound∣ed,
were infinitely provoked; and lamented the passing that Act, as an
Introduction to the entire Destruction of the Government of the Church,
and to the Alteration of the Religion of the Kingdom: and very many
who more considered the Policy, than the Justice, and Piety of the State,
did ever after believe, that being removed out of the Parliament,
the preserving them in the Kingdom, was not worth any notable Conten∣tion.
Then They looked upon the King's Condescension in this Particular,
in a Subject that all Men knew had a wonderful Influence upon his Con∣science,
as He often took Occasion to profess, as a Manifestation, that He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
would not be constant in retaining, and denying any Thing that should
be impetuously, and fiercely demanded; which as it exceedingly con∣firmed
those, who were engaged in that Party; so it abated the Courage
of too many, who had always opposed them, and heartily detested their
Proceedings; and made them more remiss in their Attendance at the
House; and less solicitous for any Thing that was done there: who by
degrees first became a neutral Party, believing They should be safe, in
angering no Body; and when They afterwards found no Security in that
Indifferency, They adhered to those, who They saw had the best Success;
and so went Sharers with them in their Future Attempts, according to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
their several Tempers, and Inclinations.</P>
<P>THE Benefit that would redound to the King from not passing the
other Bill of the Militia, more than avoiding the Infamy of consenting to
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
it, was not evident to discerning Men; for They foresaw that They would
quickly wrest it out of his Hands without his Consent; and that the Re∣putation
of the Parliament was so great, that whatsoever the two Houses
(which the People looked upon as the Parliament) should concur in, and
enjoin to be done, the People would look upon as Law, and observe it
accordingly; so that when by the Removal of so many Voices out of the
House of Peers, as the Bishops made, who were always firm to the Crown,
and Government, the House of Commons found a Concurrence from the
Lords, in all They proposed, their joint Determination would find Obe∣dience,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>for the most Part, from the People: whom there were all En∣deavours
used to corrupt, and possess, by presently printing, and causing
to be read in Churches, all their Messages, and Petitions to the King;
that They might see all their Concernments were for the good of the
Kingdom, and Preservation of the People.</P>
<P>WHEN the King accompanied the Queen to <HI>Dover,</HI> where They ex∣pected
a Wind many Days, He sent the Prince, under his new Gover∣nour,
the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> to <HI>Richmond;</HI> that there might be no
Room for the Jealousy, that the Prince should be transported beyond the
Seas; which had been infused into the Minds of many; and would have
<MILESTONE N="20"/>made a great Noise, if He had waited upon his Mother to <HI>Dover:</HI> but as
soon as the Wind appeared hopeful for her Majesty's Embarkation, the
King sent an Express to <HI>Richmond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends for the Prince to</HI> Greenwich.</NOTE> that the Prince should attend his Ma∣jesty
at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> the Saturday following: the Marquis being at that
Time very much indisposed by a Defluction upon his Eyes, and a Ca∣tarrh.
The Parliament being presently informed, as They had Spies in
all Places, of this Direction, and there being yet no Certainty of the
Queen's being embarked, was much troubled; and resolved to send to
his Majesty, by Members of both Houses, to desire that the Prince might
not remove from <HI>Richmond,</HI> at least till the Marquis recovered Health
<MILESTONE N="30"/>enough to be able to attend him; and at the same Time sent an express
Order to the Marquis, that He should not suffer the Prince to go from
thence, till He himself should be able to go with him.</P>
<P>THEY appointed one Lord and two Commoners to carry the Message
to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr</HI> Hyde <HI>is sent to the King on that Occasion.</HI></NOTE> whom They believed to be still at <HI>Dover;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
coming accidentally into the House, when the Matter was in Debate, They
appointed him to be one of the Messengers; which no Excuses could free
him from, for They did not intend it as a Favour to him; so that They
were obliged presently to begin their Journey; and that Night They went
to <HI>Gravesend.</HI> The next Day They were fully informed of the Queen's
<MILESTONE N="40"/>being gone to Sea; and that the King would be that Night at <HI>Canter∣bury;</HI>
whither the Messengers made what Haste They could; and found
his Majesty there, with a very little Court, most of his Servants having
Leave to go before to <HI>London,</HI> the better to provide themselves for a far∣ther
Journey. When They read their Message to the King, in the hear∣ing
whereof He shewed no Satisfaction, He appointed them to attend
him after He had supped, and They should receive their Answer: And
accordingly about nine of the Clock He caused it to be read, and delivered
it to them; taking no Notice of Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> as if He had been known to
him. That Messenger who was a Member of the House of Peers, received
<MILESTONE N="50"/>it from his Majesty, as of Right He ought to do, that it might be first
reported to that House.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> was very much troubled when He heard the Answer read;
for it had much Sharpness in it, which at that Time could only provoke
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
them: So without taking any Notice of it to his Companions, He pretended
to them only to be very weary, and desirous to go to Bed, and bade them
good Night; having the Conveniency offered him by the Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI>
(his familiar Friend) to lodge with him in a House, next the Court: And
so the other two Messengers making Haste to find some Lodging in an Inn;
He sent the Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> to desire the King
that He might speak with him before He went into his Bed. The King
was half undressed, yet said He would stay for him, and bade that he
should make Haste to the back Stairs; and as soon as He came thither, the
Duke went in to the King, who immediately came out in his Night Dress;<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and the Duke having before sent all other Servants from thence, retired
likewise himself.</P>
<P>HE told the King that “He was sorry that his Majesty had expressed
so much Displeasure in his Answer; which could produce no Good,
and might do Hurt; and therefore He desired He would call for it, and
alter some Expressions;” which his Majesty was not inclined to do; en∣larging
himself with much Sharpness upon the Insolence of the Message,
and of the Order They had sent to the Marquis of <HI>Hertford:</HI> And seemed
to apprehend that the Prince would not be suffered to attend him at
<HI>Greenwich;</HI> the Thought whereof had caused that Warmth in him. It<MILESTONE N="20"/>
was now <HI>Friday</HI> Night, and his Majesty resolved the next Night to be at
<HI>Greenwich;</HI> and to stay there all <HI>Sunday;</HI> and then to pursue his former
Resolutions: Upon which Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, “that He hoped the
Prince would be at <HI>Greenwich</HI> as soon as He, and then that Point would
be cleared; that They could not report His Message to the Parliament
till <HI>Monday</HI> Morning; and that They might well attend upon his Ma∣jesty
again on <HI>Sunday,</HI> and receive his Pleasure; and at that Time the
Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> would be likewise present; when
his Majesty might take what Resolution He pleased in that Matter; and
therefore He besought his Majesty that He would presently send a Ser∣vant<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to the other two Messengers, at such an Inn, for the Answer He
had delivered to them, of which He would farther consider when He
came to <HI>Greenwich;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">On whom He prevails to al∣ter his An∣swer to the Parliament.</NOTE> where He commanded them to attend him on <HI>Sun∣day,</HI>
and that He would dispatch them soon enough for them to be at
<HI>London</HI> that Night.” All which his Majesty was pleased to consent to,
and immediately sent a Gentleman to them for the Paper, with that In∣junction;
and then sent it by the Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> the same Night to
Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> whom He had commanded to attend him on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morn∣ing,
saying He had very much to say to him.</P>
<P>WHEN his Majesty came to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> He found the Prince there<MILESTONE N="40"/>
with his Governour, who though indisposed in his Health, without return∣ing
any Answer to the Parliament, brought the Prince very early from
<HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>Greenwich;</HI> with which the King was very much pleased,
and in very good Humour. And the next Morning when Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> came
to Court (to whom his Companions had told, that the King had sent for
his Answer to them again; and appointed them to attend him for it at
<HI>Greenwich</HI> that Afternoon; which They had agreed together to do) the
King being come into the Privy Chamber, and seeing him there, asked
him aloud, where the others who came in the Message with him were;
and said, He would expect them in the Afternoon; and so discoursing<MILESTONE N="50"/>
somewhat of the Weather, that all Men heard, He came near him, and
as it were passing by (which no Body took Notice of, the Room not being
full) He bade him dine with <HI>Porter,</HI> at the back Stairs, that He might be
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
in the Privy Chamber when He rose from Dinner; and after He had
dined He found him there; and at that Hour most People looking after
their own Dinner, his Majesty did without any Body's taking Notice of it,
bid him follow him into the Privy Gallery; where He was no sooner en∣tered,
than the King locked the Door with his own Key, saying, “we
will not now be disturbed, for there is no Man in the House now, who
hath a Key to this Door.” Then He said, “I will say Nothing of the
Answer, for I am sure <HI>Falkland</HI> and <HI>Colepepper</HI> will be here anon; and
then prepare one, and I will not differ with you; for now I have got∣ten
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Charles,</HI> I care not what Answer I send to them.”</P>
<P>THEN He spake of many Particulars of the Parliament with Warmth
enough;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Kings Discourse to him at</HI> Greenwich.</NOTE> and lamented his having consented to the Bill concerning
the Bishops, which He said, He was prevailed upon to do, for his
Wife's security; but He should now be without any Fear to displease
them. He said, He would lay the next Night at <HI>Theobalds;</HI> where He
would stay a Day or two, that his Servants might provide themselves to
attend him Northward: That He should not see him any more before
He took that Journey; and therefore He required him upon all Occasions
to write to him, and advertise him of such Matters as were fit for him to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>know; and to prepare and send him Answers to such Declarations, or
Messages as the Parliament should send to him: He said, He knew well
the Danger He underwent if it were discovered: but his Majesty assured
him, and bade him be confident of it, that no Person alive, but himself and
his two Friends, should know that He corresponded with his Majesty; and
that He would himself transcribe every Paper in his own Hand, before He
would shew it to any Man, and before his Secretary should write it out.
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, that He writ a very ill Hand, which would give his
Majesty too much Trouble to transcribe himself, and that He had so much
Friendship with Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that He was well contented He should
<MILESTONE N="30"/>be trusted: to which the King said, <HI>Nicholas</HI> was a very honest Man; and
He would trust him in any Thing that concerned himself; but in this Par∣ticular,
which would be so penal to the other, if it should be known, it
was not necessary; for He would quickly learn to read the Hand, if it
were writ at first with a little the more Care; and no Body should see it
but himself. And his Majesty continued so firm to this Resolution, that
though the Declarations from the Houses shortly after grew so voluminous,
that the Answers frequently contained five or six Sheets of Paper, very
closely writ; his Majesty always transcribed them with his own Hand;
which sometimes took him up two or three Days, and a good Part of the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Night, before He produced them to the Council; where they were first
read, and then He burned the Originals. And He gave himself no Ease in
this particular, till Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> left the Parliament, and by his Majesty's
Command attended upon him at <HI>York:</HI> which will be mentioned in it's
Time.</P>
<P>WHILST the King held this Discourse with him in the Privy Gallery,
many of the Lords were come from <HI>London;</HI> and not finding him, the
Earls of <HI>Essex,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who by their Offices had Keys to the Gal∣lery,
opened that Door, and went in; and seeing no Body there, walked
to the farther End; where in a turning Walk the King and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>were: And though They presently drew back, the King himself as well as
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was a little discomposed; and said, “I am very sorry for this
Accident, I meant to have said somewhat to you of those Gentlemen;
but we must not stay longer together; forget not what I have said; and
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
send me presently the Answer for your Message, and then attend with
your Companions in the Privy Chamber, and I will come out and deliver
it to them:” and so He withdrew: the two Earls smiling, and saluting
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> civilly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He draws up the King's An∣swer.</NOTE> He quickly found the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and <HI>Colepepper,</HI>
and They as quickly agreed upon the Answer which the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>
carried to the King: And his Majesty approving, and signing it, He came
out, and delivered it, after He had caused it to be read, to the Messengers
who attended to receive it; and who went that Night to <HI>London;</HI> and the
next Morning at the first sitting of the Houses, reported, and delivered it.</P>
<P>IT was expected, and believed, that as soon as the Queen was gone<MILESTONE N="10"/>
for <HI>Holland,</HI> the King would return to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and reside there. And
many wise Men were of Opinion, that if He had done so, He would have
been treated with more Duty and Respect; and that He would be able to
bring his Business to a fair End, by very moderate Condescensions; for the
universal Prejudice and Aversion was to the Queen, how unjustly and un∣reasonably
soever; and to the King only as it was generally believed, that
He governed himself entirely by her Dictates; and many of those, whose
Countenance had most supported the violent Party, by their Concurrence
with them, were grown weary of those Excesses; and as they had been
seduced, and craftily drawn farther than they meant to have gone, so they<MILESTONE N="20"/>
plainly discerned that there would be farther Attempts made, than were
agreeable to their Wishes, or their Interests; and therefore resolved to se∣cond
them no farther.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> himself was in his Nature an honest Man, and a
Man of Honour; and though He did not think the King had any gracious
Purposes towards him, or great Confidence in him, yet he was willing to
retire from that angry Company; and did neither desire the Dignity of
the King should be affronted; or the Government receive an Alteration,
or Diminution; and did hope nothing more, than to make himself the In∣strument
to reconcile the Parliament to the King, by some moderate and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
plausible Expedient. But it was no sooner known in the Houses, that his
Majesty was gone to <HI>Theobalds,</HI> and had taken the Prince with him, with
a Purpose of making a Progress farther Northward; but They fell into all
their usual Heat, and Debate, of their just Causes of Jealousy and Distrust,
and the Wickedness of those Persons who misled him; and the next Morn∣ing,
being well informed that the King staid all Day at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> They
resolved to send a Committee of four Lords, and eight Commoners to him,
to put him in mind of his violating their Privileges, for which They had
yet no Reparation or Satisfaction; his Refusal to settle the Militia, where∣by
He left his Kingdom and People exposed to the Violence of a Foreign<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Enemy, or a domestick Insurrection; the great Jealousies, and Fears which
possessed the Minds of all his Subjects; which would be now exceedingly
increased by his Removal in this Conjuncture from his Parliament; and
thereupon concluded, that He would return to <HI>London,</HI> or reside at such
a Distance, that They might easily repair to him.</P>
<P>WHEN the Persons designed for the Message withdrew to prepare them∣selves
for their Journey, the Message being read and agreed upon,
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> went likewise out of the House; and that the King might not
be surprized with the sight of the Message before He heard of it, he sent
instantly to the Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> (in whom He had entire Confidence) to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
speak with him; and desired him to cause his Horse to be made ready,
that He might with all possible Expedition carry a Letter to the King,
which He would prepare by the Time He could be ready for the Journey.
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
He writ to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to the King upon a Message from the two Houses.</NOTE> that such Persons would be presently with him; and
the Substance of the Message They would bring to him; which in Respect
of the Length of it, and of many Particulars in it, would require some
Time to answer, which He should receive soon enough; and for the
present, He might upon the Delivery, make some short Resentment of the
Houses proceeding with him; and conclude, that He would send an An∣swer
to their Message in due Time. The Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> came to <HI>Theo∣balds</HI>
when the King had newly dined, so that He was alone in his Bed∣chamber;
and as soon as He had delivered the Letter, He returned to
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>London,</HI> and met the Messengers within a Mile or two of <HI>Theobalds.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as They had delivered their Message, which one of them read,
the King with a displeased Countenance, and in a warmer, and more
sprightly Tone than was natural to him, told them, “that He was amazed
at their Message, and could not conceive what They would have, nor
what They meant to do: that They made a great Noise with their Pri∣vileges,
but forgot that He had Privileges too, which They made no
Conscience to violate: that They talked of their Fears, and Jealousies,
for which They had not the least Ground; but if They would well
consider, They would find that They gave him Cause enough for Jea∣lousy:”
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and concluded, “that He would think of their Message, and send
an Answer to the Houses in convenient Time:” without saying any
Thing of his Journey, when or whither He meant to go; nor held any
farther Discourse with them. The Manner, and the Matter of the King's
short Discourse to them, wonderfully surprised the Messengers, who were
all Persons of the best Quality in both Houses, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>
being the Chief, and some of them were of known Affections to his Ma∣jesty's
Service; who were wonderfully delighted with the King's quick,
and sharp Treatment, with which the rest were as much troubled: and
so They all returned the same Night to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE King resolved to pursue the Course agreed upon with the Queen
at her Departure; and would no more resume the Consideration of staying
nearer the Parliament: very reasonably apprehending, that He should
render himself liable every Day to new Affronts. And the Practice both
Houses had gotten, to send for Persons by a Serjeant at Arms, upon any
Suggestions of light Discourse, or upon general, and ungrounded Suspicions,
by which They were compelled to give long Attendance, if They were
not committed to Prison, had so terrified all Conditions of Men, that very
few resorted to the Court. And They who did most diligently seem to at∣tend
their Duty there, did in truth perform that Service, that They might
<MILESTONE N="40"/>with the more Ease betray their Master, and gratify those, who They
thought would at last bring themselves into those Places and Offices, upon
which They were to depend. So that He thought it most absolutely neces∣sary
to be at such a distance from <HI>Westminster,</HI> that People might be less
apprehensive of their Power: resolving likewise, that no Person who at∣tended
him, or resorted to the Place where He was, should yield any
Obedience to their Summons, upon those general Suggestions; or any Ap∣plications
they should make to his Majesty. And though it might have met
with better Success if he had taken the contrary Resolution, and staid in,
or near <HI>Whitehall;</HI> yet the Hazards, or Inconveniences which might very
<MILESTONE N="50"/>probably have attended that Counsel, were too much in View, for wise Men
to engage positively in the Advice. Besides, the Concert that had been
made with the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King be∣gins his Pro∣gress North∣ward.</NOTE> shut out all opposite Consultations: and the King
with a small Court, after two Days stay at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> began his Progress
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
toward <HI>Newmarket;</HI> and sometimes resting a Day in a Place, He advanced
by easy Journeys Northward.</P>
<P>HE took the Prince with him, the Marquis likewise attending him;
but left the Duke of <HI>York</HI> still at <HI>Richmond,</HI> till He came to <HI>York:</HI> and
then likewise He sent for his Highness, who came thither to him: and the
Morning He left <HI>Theobalds,</HI> He sent his Answer to the two Houses, to
their Message They had sent to him thither.</P>
<P>THEY had long detested and suspected Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> from the Time of
their first Remonstrance, for framing the King's Messages, and Answers,
which They now every Day received, to their intolerable Vexation; yet<MILESTONE N="10"/>
knew not how to accuse him. But now that the Earls of <HI>Essex,</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
had discovered his being shut up with the King at <HI>Greenwich;</HI> and
the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had once before, found him very early in Private
with the King at <HI>Windsor,</HI> at a Time when the King thought all Passages
had been stopped; together with his being of late more Absent from the
House, than He had used to be; and the Resort of the other Two every
Night to his Lodging as is mentioned before, satisfied them that He was
the Person; and They resolved to disenable him to manage that Office
long. Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> had as many Eyes upon them, as They had
upon the other, and an equal Animosity against them; and had Familia∣rity<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and Friendship with some Persons, who from the second or third Hand
came to know many of the greatest Designs, before they were brought
upon the Stage. For though They managed those Councils with the
greatest Secrecy, and by few Persons, which amounted to no more than
pure Designs in Speculation; yet when any Thing was to be transacted
in Publick by the House, They were obliged, not only to prepare those,
of whom They were themselves confident, but to allow those Confidents to
communicate it to others, in whom They confided: and so Men who did
not concur with them, came to know sometimes their Intentions, Time
enough to prevent the Success they proposed to themselves.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>AND by this Means Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> meeting at Night with the
Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> assured them, that it had been resolved
that Day to have seized upon all Three,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Design of sending Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>to the</HI> Tower;</NOTE> and sent them to the Tower: of
which He having received Notice as He was going to the House, returned
to his Lodging; not being able to give the same Information to the other
Two; but that his own being absent prevented the Mischief. For He knew
it was resolved the Night before, that when the Three were together in
the House, Somebody should move the House, “that they would apply
themselves to make some strict Enquiry after the Persons, who were most
like to give the King the evil Counsel he had lately followed; and who<MILESTONE N="40"/>
prepared those Answers and Messages They received from his Majesty;”
upon which by one, and another those three Persons should be named,
and particular Reasons given for their Suspicion; and that They did not
doubt, but if their Friends were well prepared before hand, They should
be able to cause them to be all sent to the <HI>Tower;</HI> and then They doubted
not They should be able to keep them there. But it was then likewise
agreed that They would not make the Attempt, but at a Time when
They were all Three in the House; upon hearing whereof, and finding
that They Two were there, He went back to his Lodging; knowing that
thereupon there would be Nothing done.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>UPON this Communication,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE> though They were all of Opinion that the
Design was so extravagant, and exceeding all the Rules of common
Justice, that They would not be able to procure the Consent of the major
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
Part of the House in it, if there were any considerable Number present;
yet because very many usually absented themselves; and They were not
governed by any Rules which had been formerly observed; They thought
fit to resolve that One of them would be always present in the House, that
They might know all that was done; but that They would never be there
altogether; and seldom two of them; and when They were, They would
only hear, and speak no more than was of absolute Necessity. For it was
now grown a very difficult Thing for a Man who was in their Disfavour,
to speak against what They proposed, but that They would find some Ex∣ception
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to some Word or Expression; upon which, after He had been
called upon to explain, He was obliged to withdraw, and then They had
commonly a major Part to send him to the <HI>Tower,</HI> or to expel him the
House; or at least to oblige him to receive a Reprehension at the Bar upon
his Knees. And so They had used Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> at that Time; who ex∣cepting
to some Expression that was used in a Declaration prepared by a
Committee, and presented to the House, which He said was dishonourable
to the King, They said, it was a Tax upon the Committee; caused him to
withdraw; and committed him to the <HI>Tower;</HI> which terrified many from
speaking at all; and caused more to absent themselves from the House;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>where too small numbers appeared any Day. These Three Gentlemen kept
the Resolution agreed upon, till They all found it necessary to forbear any
farther Attendance upon the House.</P>
<P>ABOUT the End of <HI>April,</HI> which was in the Year 1642. Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> re∣ceived
a Letter from the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>is sent for by the King to</HI> York.</NOTE> wherein He required him, that as soon as
He could be spared from his Business there, He should repair to his Ma∣jesty
at <HI>York,</HI> where He had Occasion for his Service: which when He had
communicated to his two Friends, They were all of Opinion, that it was
necessary He should defer that Journey for some Time; there being every
Day great Occasion of consulting together, and of sending Dispatches to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the King. And it was a wonderful Expedition that was then used between
<HI>York,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> when Gentlemen undertook the Service, as enough
were willing to do: insomuch, as when They dispatched a Letter on <HI>Sa∣turday</HI>
Night, at that time of the Year, about twelve at Night, they re∣ceived
always the King's Answer, <HI>Monday</HI> by ten of the Clock in the
Morning. His Majesty was content that He should stay as long as the
Necessity required; but that as soon as He might be dispensed with, He
would expect him. And it was happy that He did stay, for there was an Oc∣casion
then fell out, in which his Presence was very useful,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of the Rebellion, Folio. Vol. I. p. 444, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>towards dis∣posing
the Lord Keeper</HI> Littleton <HI>to send the Great Seal to the King at</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>York; <HI>and to resolve upon going thither himself as soon as possible to attend
his Majesty; which Resolution being taken,</HI> it was agreed between him and
his two Friends, that it was now Time that He should be gone (the King
having sent for him some Time before) after a Day or two; in which
Time the Declaration of the 19th of <HI>May</HI> would be passed, which being
very long, He might carry with him; and prepare the Answer upon the
Way, or after He came to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>IT was upon a <HI>Wednesday</HI> that He resolved to begin his Journey;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toward which He be∣gins his Jour∣ney.</NOTE>
having told the Speaker, that it was very necessary, by the Advice of his
Physician, that He should take the Air of the Country for his Health;
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and his Physician certified the same; which Caution was necessary: For
He had a Week or two before made a Journey into the Country to his own
House; and his Absence being taken Notice of, a Messenger was imme∣diately
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
sent to him, to require him immediately to attend the House;
upon which He found it necessary to return without Delay; and was
willing to prevent the like sudden Enquiry; and so prepared the Speaker
to answer for him. He resolved with the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> to stay at a
Friend's House near <HI>Oxford,</HI> and little out of the Road he meant to take
for <HI>York,</HI> till he should hear of the Keeper's Motion, of which He pro∣mised
to give him timely Notice; not giving in the mean Time any Cre∣dit
to his purpose of moving; but he was quickly convinced.</P>
<P>MUCH Notice had been taken of Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s frequent Resort to him;
and of his being often shut up with him; and when He took his Leave of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
him, the Night before He left the Town, the Keeper was walking in his
Garden with Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glyn;</HI> who had (as They said) then ob∣served,
that as soon as the Keeper's Eyes were upon him, at his Entrance
into the Garden, He had shewn some Impatience to be free from them;
and when They were gone, others took Notice (for there were many in
the Garden) as They pretended, that after They had walked some Time
together, They took their Leave of each other in another Manner
than was usual; and which was not True. But He had not so good a
Name, as that any Thing of that Kind would not easily gain Belief: so
that Dr. <HI>Morley</HI> (who is since Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI>) being in <HI>Westminster</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
Hall on the <HI>Monday</HI> Morning when the News came of the Lord Keeper's
Flight; a Person of great Authority in the Parliament met him, and
with great Passion inveighing against the Keeper, told him that They
knew well enough that his Friend Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had contrived that Mischief,
and brought it to pass; for which He would be that Morning, or the
next, accused of High Treason; which the Doctor (who was ever very
much his Friend) hearing, went presently to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and told
him of it, and desired to know where He was, that He might give him
timely Notice of it; knowing a Gentleman a very near Friend of his, who
would immediately ride to Him. The Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was then writing to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
him to inform him of the Keeper's having made good his Word, of which
he had but then Notice; and to advise him to prosecute his northern
Journey with all Expedition; and desired the Doctor that He would send
for the Gentleman, whom He would presently direct where He should
find Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> who did make so good Haste, that He delivered the Lord
<HI>Falkland</HI>'s Letter to him early the same Night.</P>
<P>HE was then at <HI>Ditchley</HI> with the Lady <HI>Lee</HI> (since Countess of <HI>Rochester</HI>)
and the Person who brought the Advertisement to him was <HI>John Ayliffe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And after a short Stay at</HI> Ditchley</NOTE>
whom he dearly loved. He no sooner received the Advertisement, but
He thought it Time for him to be gone; and as He was utterly unac∣quainted<MILESTONE N="40"/>
with the Way, having never been in the northern Parts, and ap∣prehended
that there would be Care taken to intercept him if He went in
any common Road, there was with him at that Time Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI>
whose Company He had desired from <HI>Oxford,</HI> purposely for that Occa∣casion;
and who was well acquainted with those Ways, which led almost as
far as <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> They sent their Horses that Night to a Village near <HI>Co∣ventry,</HI>
where Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Brother had a Farm; and then in the
Morning They put themselves into the Lady's Coach; which with six
Horses carried them to that Village, thirty Miles from <HI>Ditchley;</HI> where
after. They had a little refreshed themselves, They took their Horses; and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that Night, out of all. Roads, reached <HI>Lutterworth,</HI> a Village in <HI>Lei∣cestershire,</HI>
where Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> had likewise a Friend, who was Par∣son
of the Parish, who received them kindly. And so by unusual Ways
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
They got through <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> until They came to <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and then
rested at <HI>Nostall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>arrives at</HI> Nostall.</NOTE> the House of Sir <HI>John Worstenholme;</HI> who though He
and his Family were at <HI>London,</HI> had given Order for his very good Re∣ception;
it having been before resolved with his Majesty's Consent, that
He should stay in some private Place near <HI>York,</HI> 'till his Majesty was in∣formed
of it; and till his Affairs absolutely required his Presence there;
there being many Reasons that He should be concealed in those Parts, as
long as might be convenient. <HI>Nostall</HI> was within twenty Miles of <HI>York;</HI>
and from thence He gave his Majesty Notice of his being there; and sent
<MILESTONE N="10"/>him the Answer that was prepared to the Declaration of the nineteenth of
<HI>May.</HI> And the King the next Day sent Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI> to him, with
the Declaration of the twenty sixth of <HI>May,</HI> and which was the highest
They had yet published; and to which He wished an Answer should be
prepared as soon as possible it might be, that the Poison thereof might not
work too long upon the Minds of the People.</P>
<P>AS soon as it was taken Notice of in the Parliament that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
was absent, Enquiry was made, what was become of him, and a Motion
made in the House, that He might be sent for. The Speaker said, that He
had acquainted him with his going into the Country to recover his Indis∣position
<MILESTONE N="20"/>which troubled him, by fresh Air; and that Dr. <HI>Winston</HI> his Phy∣sician
was with him, and informed him, that He was troubled with the
Stone; and that his having sat so much in the House, in that very hot
Weather had done him much Harm; and therefore that He had advised
him to refresh himself in the Country Air; with which Testimony They
were for the present satisfied; though Mr. <HI>Peard</HI> said confidently, “that
He was troubled with no other Stone, than the Stone in his Heart; and
therefore He would have him sent for wherever He was; for He was
most confident that He was doing them Mischief, wherever he was.”
But He prevailed not, till their Committee from <HI>York</HI> sent them Word,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>that He was come thither, and almost always with the King. It is said
before, that He staid at <HI>Nostall</HI> at the House of Sir <HI>John Worstenholme,</HI>
from whence He sent every Day to the King, and received his Majesty's
Commands; and He intended to have staid longer there, where He could
better intend, and dispatch any Business He was to do; and He was willing
for some Time not to be seen at <HI>York,</HI> which He knew would quickly be
taken Notice of at <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN He came first thither, He found that the King was not satis∣fied
with the Lord Keeper, which gave him much Trouble; his Majesty
having sent him Word that He did not like his Humours, nor know what
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to make of him. Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> who had brought the Seal to the King, to
magnify his own Service, and not imagining that the Keeper intended to
follow him, had told many Stories; as if the Keeper had refused to deli∣ver
the Seal, and that He got it by Force, by having locked the Door
upon him, and threatened to kill him, if He would not give it to him,
which upon such his Manhood He did for pure Fear consent unto. And his
Tale got so much Credit with the King that He hardly disbelieved it,
when He came himself, though it was in the Nature of it very improbable,
that a single Man, by another Man as strong as himself (who was attended
by many Servants in the next Room) should be suffered to shut the Door
<MILESTONE N="50"/>upon him, and to extort that from him, which He had no Mind to part
with; and afterwards to go out of his House, when there were Persons
enough in every Room to have laid Hands upon him, and to have taken
That again by Force, which He had ravished away. Besides that his Ma∣jesty
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
knew He expected to be sent for at that Time; and that if He had
repented the Promise He had made, and resolved not to perform it, He
could have found several Ways to have evaded it; and refused to have ad∣mitted
Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> to speak with him: But the Prejudice his Majesty had
before contracted against him, and the great Confidence <HI>Elliot</HI> had in the
Relation, which was natural in him, had shut out all those Reflections.
Yet when his Majesty saw him, He received him graciously; and caused
him to be lodged in the Court, in a Room very near his Majesty; which
many believed to be rather out of Jealousy and Care that he should not again
return, than out of Respect to him; his Majesty keeping still the Seal<MILESTONE N="10"/>
himself, and not restoring it to his Custody; which could not but make
some Impression on him, and more on others, who from thence concluded
that He would have no more to do with the Seal; and carried themselves
towards him accordingly.</P>
<P>THE Lords who were come from the House of Peers, and had been
offended at his Behaviour there, gave him little Respect now; but rather
gave Credit to Mr. <HI>Elliot's</HI> Relation; and were forward to make Rela∣tion
of his Carriage in the House to his Disadvantage, to the King him∣self;
so that it was no Wonder that the poor Gentleman grew very Me∣lancholick.
And when He was sent for to attend the King (who was him∣self<MILESTONE N="20"/>
present when the Great Seal was to be used; nor did ever suffer it to
be used but in the Presence of the Keeper, who signed all Things as He
ought to do by his Office) when any Proclamation of Treason, as that
against the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> or against the Proceedings of the Houses, as in
the Business of the Militia, or the like, was brought to be sealed, He used
all Delays; and made many Exceptions; and found Faults in Matters of
Form, and otherwise, sometimes very reasonably; yet in such a Manner,
as made it evident He retained many Fears about him, as if He was not
without Apprehension that He might fall again into their Hands; which
was the Cause that the King had said, that He knew not what to make<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of him.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>writes from</HI> Nostall <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> as soon as He heard this, wrote a Letter to the King; and
put him in Mind of all that had formerly passed in that Affair: how ab∣solutely
the Keeper had destroyed himself in the Account of the Parlia∣ment,
by paying that Obedience which He ought to do to his Majesty's
Commands; and that if He should be deprived of his Majesty's Favour,
He must be of all Men the most miserable; and that himself should be most
unfortunate, in having contributed so much to his Ruin: which would
call his Majesty's Good Nature, and even his Justice into Question; and
therefore besought him to be Gracious to him, and to keep up his Spirits<MILESTONE N="40"/>
with his Countenance. However He made it his own humble Suit to his
Majesty, that He would not take any severe Resolution against him, be∣fore
He gave him leave to kiss his Hand, and to offer him some farther
Considerations. Upon the Receipt of this Letter, the King sent him Word,
that He would gratify him in the last part of his Letter, and conclude No∣thing
before He spake with him: in the mean Time He wished him to
send the Keeper some good Counsel; and that as soon as He should have
dispatched some Business He had then upon his Hands, that He would
come to <HI>York,</HI> where He would find much to do; and that He thought
now, there would be less Reason every Day for his being concealed. And<MILESTONE N="50"/>
within four or five Days after, his Majesty sent Mr. <HI>Ashburnbam</HI> to him to
let him know, that He had every Day so much to do with the Keeper,
and found him so refractory and obstinate, that He should not be able
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
to keep the Promise He had made to him, if He did not make Haste to
<HI>York;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And goes from thence to</HI> York.</NOTE> and therefore bade him to be with him with all Convenience:
Whereupon, within two Days after, for He had somewhat to dispatch that
required Haste, and sooner than He intended, He waited upon his Ma∣jesty
at <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN He came to the Court, being about four of the Clock in the
Afternoon, the King was at Council, upon the publishing his Answer to
the Declaration of the twenty sixth of <HI>May;</HI> which though it contained
eight or nine Sheets of Paper, He brought to the Board in his own Hand
<MILESTONE N="10"/>writing; having kept the Promise He had made at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to that
Hour, in writing out all the Papers himself, which had been sent to him;
which had been a wonderful Task He had imposed on himself: so that
He always spent more than half the Day shut up by himself in his Cham∣ber,
Writing; which was most of the News the Houses heard of him at
<HI>London;</HI> and which perplexed them very much.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> was in the Gallery when the King came from Council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Reception there;</NOTE> and
as soon as He saw him, He bade him Welcome to <HI>York</HI> very graciously;
and asked some Questions aloud of him, as if He thought He had then come
from <HI>London;</HI> and then called him into the Garden, where He walked
<MILESTONE N="20"/>with him above an Hour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Conversa∣tion with the King.</NOTE> He said at the beginning, “that They needed
not now be afraid of being seen together;” then used all the Expres∣sions
of Kindness to him that can be imagined, of the Service He had
done him; and of the great Benefit He had received from it; even to the
turning the Hearts of the whole Nation towards him again; and of his gra∣cious
Resolutions of rewarding him with the first Opportunity; and many
Expressions of that Kind; which the other received with the Modesty and
Reverence that became him. Then his Majesty spake of his Business, and
the Temper of that Country; and quickly entered upon finding Fault
with the Keeper, and protested, if it were not for his Sake, He would
<MILESTONE N="30"/>turn him out of his Place that very Hour; and enlarged upon many Par∣ticulars
of his Obstinacy, and of his Want of Courage, to such a Degree,
as if He did really apprehend, that the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod
would come and take him out of his Chamber.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, that he would discourage many good Men, who
desired to serve him very faithfully, if He were too severe for such Faults
as the Infirmities of their Nature, and Defects in their Education, exposed
them to: That if the Keeper, from those Impressions, had committed some
Faults which might provoke his Majesty's Displeasure, He had redeemed
those Errors by a signal Service, which might well wipe out the Memory
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of the other. The King said with some Warmth, “that He was so far
from another Opinion, that He would hate himself if He did not believe
that He had made a full Expiation; and though He did think that He
had been wrought upon by <HI>him</HI> to perform that Part; yet He thought
the Merit of it far above any of his Transgressions; and that He was
disposed from the first Minute of his coming to <HI>York,</HI> to have renewed
his old Kindness to him, and Confidence in him; and would willingly
have given the Seal again into his Hands, if He had found He had desired
it: but that He found no Serenity in his Countenance; nor any Incli∣nation
to do what Necessity required: and whereas the Parliament took
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Advantage, that none of his Majesty's Acts which He had caused to be
published, were Authentick, nor ought to be looked upon as his, be∣cause
the Great Seal had not been affixed to them, which could not be
done whilst the Great Seal was at <HI>Westminster;</HI> now He had the Seal by
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
him, and sent Proclamations to be sealed, the Keeper was still as un∣willing
that they should pass, as if He was still under their Power;
which made him angry, and Nothing that He had done before.”</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> replied, that “the poor Gentleman could not but think
himself disobliged to the highest Extremity, in the Presumption of
Mr. <HI>Elliot;</HI> and that his extravagant, and insolent Discourses should
find Credit, without his Majesty's Reprehension, and Vindication, who
knew the Falshood of them.” And so put his Majesty in Mind of all that
had passed; and of the other Circumstances, which made all the other's
Brags impossible to be True. For his Fears and Apprehensions, He be∣sought<MILESTONE N="10"/>
his Majesty to remember, that “He had newly escaped out of that
Region, where the Thunder and Lightening is made; and that He
could hardly yet recover the Fright He had been often in, and seen so
many others in; and that his Majesty need not distrust him, He had
passed the <HI>Rubicon,</HI> and had no Hope but in his Majesty.” His Ma∣jesty
concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whom He re∣conciles to the Lord Keeper.</NOTE> that He should be sure to receive all necessary Counte∣nance,
and Protection from him, of which He bade him to assure him,
and presently to visit him, which going to do, He met him in the Gar∣den,
and They there walked together.</P>
<P>HE found him full of Apprehension that He should be put out of his<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Place; and of the Ruin, and Contempt that He should be then exposed
to, which He had brought upon himself; but when the other answered
him, that there was no Danger of that; and told him all that had passed
between the King and Him; and that if He would, He might have the
Seal in his own Custody again within an Hour; He was exceedingly re∣vived,
and desired him to intreat the King to keep the Great Seal still
himself; that He would by no Means be answerable for the Safety of it;
nor would trust any Servant of his own to look to it; which as it was
wisely considered, and resolved by him, so it increased the King's Confi∣dence
in him; who would have been troubled if the other had accepted<MILESTONE N="30"/>
the Grace that was offered. And from that Time, when any Thing was
to be done, that administered any Argument for Doubt, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> always
prepared him by Discourse; so that there was never after any Unkindness
from the King towards him; but the Vigour of his Mind grew every Day
less under a great Melancholy that oppressed him, from the Consideration
of the Time, and of his own ill Condition in his Fortune; which was
much worse than any Body imagined it could be.</P>
<P>BEFORE He went out of the Garden, the Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh
Cholmely,</HI> and Sir <HI>Philip Stapleton</HI> (who were the Committee from the Par∣liament)
had Intelligence that He was walking in the Garden with the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
King; whereupon They came presently thither, and after They had sa∣luted
him with much Civility, They shewed him an Instruction They had
from the Parliament; by which They were required, if any Member of
either House came to <HI>York,</HI> They should let them know, that it was the
Pleasure of the House that They should immediately attend the House;
and signify to them what Answer They made;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is sum∣moned to at∣tend the Par∣liament: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> and so They desired He
would excuse them for doing their Duty. He told them, He was but just
then come thither in Obedience to his Majesty's Commands, and knew
not yet what Service He was to do; but that as soon as his Majesty would
give him Leave, He would return to the Parliament.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THERE happened an Accident, at Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s first coming to <HI>York,</HI>
which He used often to speak of, and to be very merry at. One of the
King's Servants had provided a Lodging for him, so that when He alighted
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
at the Court, He sent his Servants thither, and staid himself at the Court
'till after Supper, and 'till the King went into his Chamber; and then He
had a Guide, who went with him, and conducted him to his Chamber;
which he liked very well, and began to undress himself. One of his Ser∣vants
wished that He had any other Lodging, and desired him not to lie
there; He asked why, it seemed to him a good Chamber: his Servant
answered, that the Chamber was good, but the People of the House the
worst He ever saw, and such, as He was confident would do him some
Mischief: at which wondering, his Servant told him, that the Persons of
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the House seemed to be of some Condition by their Habit, that was very
good; and that the Servants when They came thither, found the Master
and Mistress in the lower Room, who received them civilly, and shewed
them the Chamber where their Master was to lodge; and wished them to
call for any Thing They wanted, and so left them: That shortly after,
one of them went down, and the Mistress of the House being again in the
lower Room, where it seems she usually sat, She asked him, what his
Master's Name was, which He told her; what said She, that <HI>Hyde</HI> that
is of the House of Commons? and He answering yes, She gave a great
Shriek, and cried out, that He should not lodge in her House; cursing
<MILESTONE N="20"/>him with many bitter Execrations. Upon the Noise her Husband came
in, and when She told him who it was that was to lodge in the Chamber
above, He swore a great Oath that He should not; and that He would
rather set his House on Fire, than entertain him in it. The Servant stood
amazed, knowing that his Master had never been in, or near that City;
and desired to know what Offence He had committed against them; He
told them He was confident his Master did not know them, nor could be
known to them. The Man answered after two or three Curses, that He
knew him well enough, and that He had undone him, and his Wife, and
his Children; and so after repeating some new bitter Curses, He concluded,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>that He would set his House on Fire as soon as the Other should set his
Foot in it; and so He, and his Wife went away in a great Rage into an
inner Room, and clapped the Door to them.</P>
<P>WHEN his Servant had made this Relation to him, He was no less sur∣prized;
knew not what to make of it; asked whether the People were
drunk, was assured that They were very sober, and appeared before this
Passion to be well bred. He sent to desire the Master of the House to come
to him, that They might confer together, and that He would immediately
depart his House if He desired it. He received no Answer, but that He
and his Wife were gone to Bed: upon which He said no more, but that, if
<MILESTONE N="40"/>They were gone to Bed, He would go to Bed too, and did accordingly.
Though He was not disturbed in the Night, the Morning was not at all
calmer; the Master and the Mistress stormed as much as ever; and
would not be persuaded to speak with him: but He then understood the
Reason: the Man of the House had been an Attorney in the Court of the
President and Council of the North, in great Reputation and Practice
there; and thereby got a very good Livelihood, with which He had lived
in Splendor; and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had sat in the Chair of that Committee, and
had carried up the Votes of the Commons against that Court, to the House
of Peers, upon which it was dissolved: which He confessed was a better
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Reason for being angry with him, than many others had, who were as
angry, and persecuted him more. However, He thought himself obliged
to remove the Eye-sore from them, and to quit the Lodging that had been
assigned to him; and He was much better accommodated by the Kindness
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
of a good Prebendary of the Church, Dr. <HI>Hodshon,</HI> who sent to in∣vite
him to lodge in his House,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He resides at</HI> York <HI>with Dr.</HI> Hodshon.</NOTE> as soon as He heard He was come to
Town; where He resided as long as the Court staid there.</P>
<P>THERE was now a great Conflux of the Members of both Houses of
Parliament to <HI>York;</HI> insomuch as there remained not in the House of
Commons above a fifth Part of the whole Number; and of the House of
Peers so few, that there continued not at <HI>Westminster</HI> twenty Lords. Yet
They proceeded with the same Spirit, and Presumption, as when their
Numbers were full; published new Declarations against the King; raised
Soldiers for their Army apace; and executed their Ordinance for the Mi∣litia<MILESTONE N="10"/>
in all the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> the northern Parts only excepted;
forbad all Persons to resort to the King; and intercepted many in their
Journey towards <HI>York,</HI> and committed them to Prison: notwithstanding
which, many Persons of Quality every Day flocked thither; and it was
no longer safe for those Members to stay in the Houses of Parliament, who
resolved not to concur with them in their unwarrantable Designs; and
therefore the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> shortly after repaired
likewise to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the King declared that He would go to <HI>Beverley,</HI> a Place with∣in
four Miles of <HI>Hull,</HI> the Noise of the King's Journey thither made a<MILESTONE N="20"/>
great Impression upon the Parliament. Where, how great a Concurrence
soever there was, in those unwarrantable Actions which begot the War;
yet a small Number of those who voted, both the raising the Army, and
making the General, did in Truth intend, or believe that there would
be a War: and therefore when They looked upon it as begun in this
March of the King's to <HI>Hull</HI> (for They considered their own Actions as
done only to prevent a War, by making the King unable to make it, who
as They thought only desired it) they moved presently for some Overtures
of an Accommodation. Which that angry Party that resolved against it,
never durst absolutely reject; but consenting chearfully to it, got thereby<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Authority to insert such Things in the Address, as must inevitably render
it ineffectual. So, at this Time They sent the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> a Person
whom They knew to be most unacceptable to the King, with two Mem∣bers
of the House of Commons, who came to <HI>Beverley</HI> the Day the King
arrived there. The Subject of their Message was, after several specious
Expressions, and Professions of their Duty, to dissuade his Majesty from
making War against his Parliament, by proceeding in his Enterprize against
<HI>Hull,</HI> which the Parliament was obliged to defend. And all the Expe∣dient
They proposed for the avoiding this War was, that He would con∣sent
to the nineteen Propositions, which They had formerly made to him<MILESTONE N="40"/>
at <HI>York,</HI> and to which He had long since returned his Answer; and both
the one and the other were printed.</P>
<P>THESE nineteen Propositions, which contained the Disinherison of the
Crown of all its choice Regalities, and left only the Shadow and empty
Name of the King, had been framed by the Houses after Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> left
<HI>London.</HI> And because He had so much Work then upon his Hands, as They
believed He would not be able to dispatch soon enough, the Lord <HI>Falk∣land,</HI>
and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> undertook to prepare an Answer to them
themselves; and so divided the Propositions between them; and in a short
Time so finished their Answer that They sent it to the King, and desired<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> might peruse it, and then cause it to be published and
printed. The Answer was full to all Particulars; and writ with very much
Wit and Sharpness; but there were some Expressions in it, which He liked
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
not, as prejudicial to the King, and in Truth a Mistake in Point of Right,
in that Part which had been prepared by Sir <HI>John Colepepper;</HI> who had
taken it up upon Credit, and without weighing the Consequence, did
really believe that it had been True; which was, that in the Discourse
of the Constitution of the Kingdom, He had declared, that the <HI>King</HI>
and <HI>the House of Peers,</HI> and <HI>the House of Commons</HI> made the <HI>Three
Estates:</HI> and for this Reason Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> did not advance the Printing it;
and told the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>advises the King not to publish the Answer to the Parliament's nineteen Pro∣positions.</HI></NOTE> that all the Particulars in those Propositions had been
enough answered in former Answers to other Declarations (which was true)
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and therefore that this needed not be published: with which his Majesty
was satisfied, without knowing the particular true Reason; which He
thought not fit to communicate, for both the Persons sakes, of whose Af∣fection
for the Church (which was principally concerned in that Mistake,
since in Truth the Bishops make the <HI>Third Estate,</HI> the King being the
Head, and Sovereign of the Whole) his Majesty was always jealous.</P>
<P>BUT They no sooner came to <HI>York,</HI> than They appeared much unsa∣tisfied,
that that Answer was not printed: and the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> finding
it remained still in Mr. <HI>Hyde's</HI> Hands, He expostulated warmly with him
of the Reasons;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Falk∣land'<HI>s Expol∣tulation with him thereon.</HI></NOTE> and in some Passion said, “He therefore disliked it be∣cause
<MILESTONE N="20"/>He had not writ it himself.” Upon which, without saying more
than that, “He never expected so unkind a Reproach from him,” He
delivered the written Copy to him, and He immediately procured the
King's Consent, and sent it to the Press that Night, with Order to lose
no Time in the Impression. Of which the King was afterwards very sen∣sible;
and that Excellent Lord, who intended not the least Unkindness
(nor did it produce the least Interruption in their Friendship) was likewise
much troubled when He knew the Reason; and imputed it to his own
Inadvertency, and to the Infusion of some Lawyers who had misled Sir
<HI>John Colepepper;</HI> and to the Declarations which many of the Prelatical
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Clergy frequently, and ignorantly made, that the Bishops did not fit in
Parliament, as the Representatives of the Clergy, and so could not be the
<HI>Third Estate.</HI></P>
<P>IT happened that the Day the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> came to <HI>Beverley,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had been riding Abroad; and returning to <HI>Beverley,</HI> happened
to be in the same Road, when the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and his Company
prosecuted their Journey to the King: when meeting together, there
passed the usual Salutations which are between Persons well known to each
other.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde'<HI>s Conversation with the Earl of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> “He hoped (the Earl said) that He should be Welcome to all ho∣nest
Men at the Court, because He came to invite the King to return
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to his Parliament; and to abolish all Jealousies between them.” The
other answered, “He would be very Welcome indeed, if He brought
proper Expedients to produce either of those Effects: but then his Er∣rand
must be of another Composition, than what the King understood
it to be.” Upon which They entered upon a warmer Discourse than it
may be either of them intended; and as the Earl spake in another Stile
than He had used to do, of the Power and Authority of the Parliament,
and how much They were superior to any Opposition or Contradiction; so
the Other in the Debate was less reserved, and kept a less Guard upon
himself than He used to do; so that They seemed nothing pleased with
<MILESTONE N="50"/>each other: nor did Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> visit him after his coming to <HI>Beverley,</HI> be∣cause
He was informed that the Earl had to many Persons who resorted
to him, repeated with some Liberty and Sharpness, what had passed be∣tween
them; and not without some Menaces what the Parliament would
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
do. And as soon as He did return, there was a new Vote passed by
Name against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is exempt∣ed from Par∣don by a Vote of the Houses.</NOTE> and Two or Three more, by which He was exempted
from Pardon in any Accommodation that should be made between the
King, and Parliament.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> had been absent four or five Days from the Court; and
came into the Presence when the King was washing his Hands before Din∣ner;
and as soon as the King saw him, He asked him aloud, “<HI>Ned
Hyde</HI> when did you play with my Bandstrings last?” upon which He
was exceedingly out of Countenance, not imagining the Cause of the
Question, and the Room being full of Gentlemen, who appeared to be<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Merry with what the King had asked. But his Majesty observing him to
be in Disorder, and to blush very much, said pleasantly, “be not trou∣bled
at it, for I have worn no Bandstrings these twenty Years:” and then
asked him whether He had not seen the Diurnal; of which He had not
heard till then, but, shortly after, some of the Standers-by shewed him a
Diurnal, in which there was a Letter of Intelligence printed, where it was
said, that <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> was grown so familiar with the King, that He used
to play with his Bandstrings. Which was a Method of calumniating They
began then, and shortly after prosecuted and exercised upon much greater
Persons.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>IN the Afternoon the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> came to deliver his Message with
great Formality: whom the King received with much Coldness, and Ma∣nifestation
of Neglect; and when the Earl approached, and kneeled to
kiss his Hand, He turned or withdrew his Hand in such a Manner, that
the Earl kissed his own. When the Message was read, the King said little
more, than that They should not stay long for an Answer; and so went
to his Chamber. The Earl was not without many Friends there, and some
of them moved the King, that He would give him Leave to say some∣what
to him in Private, which They believed would be very much for his
Service; but his Majesty would by no Means yield to it. By this Time<MILESTONE N="30"/>
his Majesty had Notice of the Governor's Irresolution at <HI>Hull;</HI> and so was
glad of this Opportunity to have a fair Excuse for making no Attempt
upon that Place. And sent the next Day for the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> to receive
his Answer; which being read aloud in the King's Presence, and a full
Room, by the Clerk of the Council, was very grateful to the Auditors,
who feared some Condescension in the King; though very mortifying to
the Earl. For besides that it was thought very sharp towards the Houses,
it declared his Brother the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> a Traitor, for possessing him∣self
of the King's Fleet against his Consent; and concluded, that He
would forbear any Attempt upon <HI>Hull</HI> for fourteen Days; in which Time,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
if the Parliament would enter into a Treaty for a happy Peace, They should
find him very well inclined to it; after the expiration of that Time He
should pursue those Ways which He thought fit. In the mean Time, He
made a short Progress into the adjacent Counties of <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI>
to see what Countenance They wore; and to encourage those, who
appeared to have good Affections to his Service: And then returning to
<HI>Beverley</HI> within the limited Time, and hearing no more from the Parlia∣ment,
or any Thing from <HI>Hull</HI> that He expected, He returned again to
<HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> was wont often to relate a Passage in that melancholick<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Time, when the Standard was set up at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> with which He was
much affected. Sir <HI>Edmund Varney,</HI> Knight-Marshal, who was mentioned
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
before as Standard Bearer, with whom He had great Familiarity, who
was a Man of great Courage, and generally beloved, came one Day to
him and told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Conversa∣tion with Sir</HI> Edmund Varney.</NOTE> “He was very glad to see him in so universal a Damp,
under which the Spirits of most Men were oppressed, retain still his na∣tural
Vivacity and Chearfulness; that He knew that the Condition of the
King, and the Power of the Parliament, was not better known to any
Man than to him; and therefore He hoped that He was able to admi∣nister
some Comfort to his Friends, that might raise their Spirits, as
well as it supported his own.” He answered, “that He was in Truth be∣holden
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to his Constitution, which did not incline him to Despair; other∣wise,
that He had no pleasant Prospect before him, but thought as ill
of Affairs as most Men did; that the other was as far from being me∣lancholick
as He, and was known to be a Man of great Courage (as in∣deed
He was of a very cheerful, and a generous Nature, and con∣fessedly
Valiant) and that They could not do the King better Service,
than by making it their Business to raise the dejected Minds of Men;
and root out those Apprehensions which disturbed them, of Fear and
Despair, which could do no Good, and did really much Mischief.”</P>
<P>HE replied smiling, “I will willingly join with you the best I can,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>but I shall act it very scurvily. My Condition, <HI>said He,</HI> is much worse
than yours, and different I believe from any other Man's, and will very
well justify the Melancholick that, I confess to you, possesses me. You
have Satisfaction in your Conscience that you are in the Right; that the
King ought not to grant what is required of him; and so you do your
Duty, and your Business together: But for my Part, I do not like the
Quarrel, and do heartily wish that the King would yield and consent to
what They desire; so that my Conscience is only concerned in Honour,
and in Gratitude to follow my Master. I have eaten his Bread, and
served him near thirty Years, and will not do so base a Thing, as to for∣sake
<MILESTONE N="30"/>him; and chuse rather to lose my Life (which I am sure I shall do)
to preserve and defend those Things, which are against my Conscience
to preserve and defend. For I will deal freely with you, I have no Re∣verence
for the Bishops, for whom this Quarrel subsists.” It was not a
Time to Dispute; and his Affection to the Church had never been sus∣pected.
He was as Good as his Word; and was killed in the Battle of
<HI>Edgehill,</HI> within two Months after this Discourse. And if those who had
the same and greater Obligations, had observed the same Rules of Grati∣tude,
and Generosity, whatever their other Affections had been, that
Battle had never been fought, nor any of that Mischief been brought to
<MILESTONE N="40"/>pass, that succeeded it.</P>
<P>AFTER the King came to <HI>Oxford</HI> with his Army, his Majesty one Day
speaking with the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> very graciously concerning Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Wager with Lord</HI> Falk∣land <HI>concern∣ing Mr.</HI> Hyde'<HI>s Style.</HI></NOTE>
said He had such a peculiar Stile, that He could know any Thing written
by him, if it were brought to him by a Stranger, amongst a Multitude of
Writings by other Men. The Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> answered, He doubted his
Majesty could hardly do that; because He himself, who had so long Con∣versation
and Friendship with him, was often deceived; and osten met
with Things written by him, of which He could never have suspected
him, upon the variety of Arguments. To which the King replied, He would
<MILESTONE N="50"/>lay him <HI>an Angel,</HI> that let the Argument be what it would, He should
never bring him a Sheet of Paper (for He would not undertake to judge of
less) of his Writing, but He would discover it to be his. The Lord <HI>Falk∣land</HI>
told him it should be a Wager; but neither the one or the other
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
ever mentioned it to Mr. <HI>Hyde.</HI> Some Days after the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>
brought several Packets, which He had then received from <HI>London,</HI> to
the King, before He had opened them, as he used to do: and after He
had read his several Letters of Intelligence, He took out the Prints of
Diurnals, and Speeches, and the like, which were every Day printed at
<HI>London,</HI> and as constantly sent to <HI>Oxford:</HI> and amongst the rest there
were two Speeches, the one made by the Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> for an Accommo∣dation;
and the other by the Lord <HI>Brooke</HI> against it, and for the carrying on
the War with more Vigour, and utterly to root out the Cavaliers, which
were the King's Party.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE King was very much pleased with reading the Speeches, and said,
He did not think that <HI>Pembroke</HI> could speak so long together; though every
Word He said was so much his own, that no Body else could make it. And
so after He had pleased Himself with reading the Speeches over again, and
then passed to other Papers, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> whispered in his Ear (for
there were other Persons by) desiring him He would pay him <HI>the Angel;</HI>
which his Majesty in the Instant apprehending, blushed, and put his Hand
in his Pocket, and gave him <HI>an Angel,</HI> saying, He had never paid a Wa∣ger
more willingly: and was very merry upon it, and would often call
upon Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> for a Speech, or a Letter, which He very often prepared upon<MILESTONE N="20"/>
several Occasions; and the King always commanded them to be printed.
And He was often wont to say many Years after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He laments the Loss of Many of his occasional Writings.</NOTE> that He would be very
glad He could make a Collection of all those Papers, which he had writ∣ten
occasionally at that Time; which He could never do, though He got
many of them.</P>
<P>THERE was at that Time a pleasant Story upon those Speeches. The
Lord <HI>Brooke</HI> had met with them in print; and heard that he was much
reproached for so Unchristian a Speech against Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Dispute caused by one of them.</NOTE> though the Lan∣guage
was such as He used in all Opportunities: whereupon one Morning
in the House of Peers, and before the House fate, He came to the Earl of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Portland</HI> (who yet remained there with the King's Approbation, and
knew well enough from whence the Speeches came, having himself caused
them to be printed) and shewing them to him, desired He would move
the House, that that Speech might, by their Order, be burned by the
Hand of the Hangman; by which Means the Kingdom would be in∣formed,
that it had never been spoken by him. The Earl said He would
willingly do him the Service; but He observed that the Speeches were
printed in that Manner, that where the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Speech ended
on the one Side of the Leaf, his (the Lord <HI>Brooke</HI>'s) Speech began on the
other Side, so that one could not be burned, without burning the other<MILESTONE N="40"/>
too; which He knew not how the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> would like; and
therefore He durst not move it without his Consent. Whereupon They
both went to the Earl, who was then likewise in the House, and <HI>Port∣land</HI>
told him what the Lord <HI>Brooke</HI> desired, and asked him whether He
wished it should be done. He, who heard He was very well spoken of,
for having spoke so honestly for Peace, said, He did not desire it. Upon
which <HI>Brooke</HI> in great Anger, asked if He had ever made that Speech;
He was very sure He had never made the other; and the other with equal
Choler replied, that He was always for Peace; and though He could not
say He had spoken all those Things together, He was sure He had spoken<MILESTONE N="50"/>
them all at several Times; and that He knew as well, that He had al∣ways
been against Peace, and had often used all those Expressions which
were in the Speech, though it may be not all together. Upon which They
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
entered into a high Combat of reproachful Words against each other, to
the no small Delight of the Earl, who had brought them together, and of
the rest of the Standers by.</P>
<P>THE King was no sooner settled in his Winter Quarters, after his Re∣treat
from <HI>Brentford</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> but the Parliament sent to him for a Safe-Conduct,
for Commissioners to be sent from them to treat of Peace;
which was sent to them. And at this Time there was a Change in
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s Fortune, by a Preferment the King conferred upon him.
Every Body knew that He was trusted by the King in his most secret Trans∣actions;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>but He was under no Character in his Service. When the Com∣missioners
who were sent for the Safe-Conduct came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> some who
came in their Company, amongst other Matters of Intelligence brought
the King a Letter of his own to the Quéen, printed, that had been inter∣cepted,
and printed by the Licence, if not Order, of the Parliament. In
this Letter, of the safe Conveyance whereof his Majesty had no Apprehen∣sion,
the King had lamented the Uneasiness of his own Condition, in re∣spect
of the daily Importunity which was made to him by the Lords and
others, for Honours, Offices, and Preferments; and named several Lords,
who were solicitous by themselves, or their Friends, for this, and that Place;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>in all which He desired to receive the Queen's Advice, being resolved to do
Nothing with Reference to those Pretences, till He should receive it. But
He said there were some Places, which He must dispose of without stay∣ing
for her Answer, the Necessity of his Service requiring it; which were
the Mastership of the Wards; Applications being still made to the Lord
<HI>Say</HI> in those Affairs, and so that Revenue was diverted from him: and
therefore as He had revoked his Patent, so He was resolved to make Secre∣tary
<HI>Nicholas</HI> Master of the Wards, and then (these were his Majesty's own
Words) I must make <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> Secretary of State, for the Truth is, I can
trust no Body else. Which was a very envious Expression, and extended
<MILESTONE N="30"/>by the ill Interpretation of some Men, to a more general Comprehension
than could be intended. This was quickly made Publick, for there were
several Prints of it in many Hands; and some Men had Reason to be trou∣bled
to find their Names mentioned in that Manner, and others were glad
that theirs were there, as having the Pretence to pursue their Importuni∣ties
the more vehemently, being, as the Phrase was, brought upon the
Stage, and should suffer much in their Honour if They should be now re∣jected;
which Kind of Argumentation was very unagreeable and grievous
to the King.</P>
<P>ONE Morning, when the King was walking in the Garden, as He used
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>declines the Office of Se∣cretary of State.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> being then in his View, his Majesty called him, and dis∣coursed
of the Trouble He was in at the intercepting that Letter; and
finding by his Countenance that He understood not the Meaning, He asked
him, “whether He had not heard a Letter of his, which He writ to the
Queen, had been intercepted and printed.” And He answering, that “He
had not heard of it,” as in Truth he had not; the King gave him the
printed Letter to read, and then said, that “He wished it were as much
in his Power to make every Body else Amends, as He could him;
for, <HI>He said,</HI> He was resolved that Afternoon to swear him Secretary of
State, in the Place of <HI>Nicholas;</HI> whom He would likewise then make
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Master of the Wards.” Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, “He was indeed much sur∣prized
with the Sight of the Letter; which He wished had not been
communicated in that Manner: but that He was much more surprized
to find his own Name in it, and his Majesty's Resolution upon it, which
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
He besought him to change; for as He never had the Ambition to
hope, or wish for that Place, so He knew He was very unfit for it, and
unable to discharge it.” To which the King with a little Anger replied,
that “He did the greatest Part of the Business now:” and he answered,
that “what He did now, would be no Part of the Business, if the Rebel∣lion
were ended; and that his Unskilfulness in Languages, and his not
understanding foreign Affairs, rendered him very incapable of that
Trust.” The King said, “He would learn as much as was necessary of
that Kind very quickly.” He continued his Desire, that his Majesty
would lay aside that Thought; and said, “that He had great Friendship<MILESTONE N="10"/>
for Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who would be undone by the Change; for He
would find that his Majesty would receive very Little, and He Nothing,
by that Office, till the Troubles were composed.” The King said, “<HI>Ni∣cholas</HI>
was an honest Man, and that his Change was by his Desire;” and
bade him speak with him of it; which He went presently to do, leaving
his Majesty unsatisfied with the Scruples He had made.</P>
<P>WHEN He came to the Secretary's Lodging, He found him with a
chearful Countenance, and embracing him, called him his Son. Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
answered him, that “it was not the Part of a good Son to undo his Fa∣ther,
or to become his Son that He might undo him:” and so they en∣tered<MILESTONE N="20"/>
upon the Discourse; the one telling him what the King had re∣solved,
and how grateful the Resolution was to him; and the other in∣forming
him of the Conference He had then had with the King, and that
for his Sake as well as his own, He would not submit to the King's Plea∣sure
in it. And so He debated the whole Matter with him; and made it
evident to him, that He would be disappointed in any Expectation He
should entertain of Profit from the Wards, as the State of Affairs then
stood: so that He should relinquish an honourable Employment, which
He was well acquainted with, for an empty Title with which He would
have Nothing to do: and so advised him to consider well of it, and of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
all the Consequences of it, before He expos'd himself to such an Incon∣venience.</P>
<P>WHILST this was in Suspense, Sir <HI>Charles Caesar,</HI> who with great Pre∣judice
to the King, and more Reproach to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,
Laud,</HI> had been made Master of the Rolls, died: and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI>
had long had a Promise from the King of that Place, when it should be∣come
void, and now pressed the Performance of it: which was violently
opposed by Many, partly out of ill Will to him (for He had not the Fa∣culty
of getting himself much loved) and as much out of good Husbandry,
and to supply the King's Necessities with a good Sum of Money, which<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Dr. <HI>Duck</HI> was ready to lay down for the Office. And the King was so far
wrought upon, that He paid down three thousand Pounds in Part of what
He was to give; but his Majesty caused the Money to be repaid, and re∣solved
to make good his Promise to Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who would by no
means release him. This was no sooner declared, than the Lord <HI>Falk∣land</HI>
(who was much more solicitous to have Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> of the Council,
than He was himself for the Honour) took an Opportunity to tell the
King, that He had now a good Opportunity to prefer Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> by
making him Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Place of Sir <HI>John Cole∣pepper;</HI>
which the King said, He had resolved to do, and bid him take<MILESTONE N="50"/>
no Notice of it, until He had told him so himself. And shortly after sent
for him, and said, “that He had now found an Office for him, which
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
He hoped He would not refuse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But accepts that of Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE> That the Chancellorship of the Ex∣chequer
was void by the Promotion of <HI>Colepepper;</HI> and that He re∣solved
to confer it upon him;” with many gracious Expressions of the
Satisfaction He had in his Service. The other answered, “that though it
was an Office much above his Merit, yet He did not despair of enabling
himself by Industry to execute it, which He would do with all Fi∣delity.</P>
<P>As soon as this was known, no Man was so much troubled at it as
Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who had in Truth an Intention to have kept both
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Places, until He should get into the quiet Possession of the Rolls. And
though He professed much Friendship to the other, He had no Mind He
should be upon the same Level with him; and believed He would have
too much Credit in the Council. And so delayed, after his Patent for the
Rolls was passed, to surrender that of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer,
until the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> expostulated very warmly
with him upon it, and until the King took Notice of it; and then,
seeming very much troubled that any Body should doubt the Integrity of
his Friendship to Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> to whom He made all the Professions ima∣ginable,
He surrendered his Office of Chancellor of the Exchequer: and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the next Day Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was sworn of the Privy-Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is sworn of the Privy Council and Knighted.</NOTE> and Knighted,
and had his Patents sealed for that Office. And the King, after He rose
from the Council, and after many Expressions, of the Content He took
himself in the Obligation He had laid upon him, with much Grace, that
was not natural in him upon such Occasions, told him, that “He was
very fortunate, because He verily believed no Body was angry at his
Preferment; for besides that the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> and others, who He
knew loved him, had expressed much Satisfaction in the King's Purpose;
<HI>He said,</HI> the Lord <HI>Maltrevers,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Dunsmore,</HI> who He did
not think had any Acquaintance with him, seemed very much pleased
<MILESTONE N="30"/>with him; and therefore He thought no Body would envy him; which
was a rare Felicity.” But his Majesty was therein mistaken; for He had
great Enviers, of many who thought He had run too fast; especially of
those of his own Profession, who looked upon themselves as his Superiors
in all Respects, and did not think that his Age (which was not then above
thirty three) or his other Parts, did entitle him to such a Preference before
them. And the News of it at <HI>Westminster,</HI> exceedingly offended Those
who governed in the Parliament; to see the Man whom They most hated,
and whom They had voted to be incapable of Pardon, to be now preferred
to an Office the Chief of them looked for. Besides, there was another un∣usual
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Circumstance accompanied his Preferment, that it was without the
Interposition, or Privity of the Queen, which was not like to make it the
more easy, and advantageous; and it was not the more unwelcome to him
from that Circumstance.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the Discourse of, and Inclination to a Treaty,
the Armies were not quiet on either Side. The King's Quarters were en∣larged
by the taking of <HI>Marlborough</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and of <HI>Cirencester</HI> in
<HI>Glocestershire;</HI> which though untenable by their Situation, and weak
Fortifications, were garrisoned by the Parliament with great Numbers of
Men, who were all killed, or taken Prisoners. And the Parliament Forces
<MILESTONE N="50"/>were not without Success too; and after the Loss of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> sur∣prized
the Regiment of Horse, that was commanded by the Lord <HI>Gran∣dison,</HI>
a gallant Gentleman, who if not betrayed, was unhappily invited to
<HI>Winchester,</HI> with Promise of Forces ready to defend the Place; which be∣ing
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
in no Degree performed, He was the next Day after He came, en∣closed
in the Castle of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and compelled to become, all, Officers
and Soldiers, Prisoners of War: Though He and some other of the prin∣cipal
Officers, by the Negligence, or Corruption of their Guard, made
their Escape in the Night, and returned to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the State of the Kingdom, of the King, and of the Par∣liament,
in the beginning of the Year 1643, at the Time when Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
was made of the Privy Council, and Chancellor of the Exchequer: which
was between the Return of the Commissioners, who had been sent to
the King to propose a Treaty, and the coming of those Commissioners<MILESTONE N="10"/>

the King; which being about the End of the Year 1642, this Part shall

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART the THIRD.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about the Beginning of <HI>March</HI> (which by that Account was
about the end of the Year 1642, and about the Beginning of the
Year 1643) that the Commissioners of the Parliament came to <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI>
to treat with his Majesty; and were received graciously by him;
and by his Order lodged conveniently, and well accommodated in all
Respects.</P>
<P>THE Parliament had bound up their Commissioners to the strictest Let∣ter
of their Propositions; nor did their Instructions at this Time (which
They presented to the King) admit the least Latitude to them to interpret
<MILESTONE N="10"/>a Word or Expression, that admitted a doubtful Interpretation. Insomuch
as the King told them, “that He was sorry that They had no more Trust
reposed in them; and that the Parliament might as well have sent their
Demands to him by the common Carrier, as by Commissioners so re∣strained.”
They had only twenty Days allowed them to finish the whole
Treaty: whereof They might employ six Days in adjusting a Cessation, if
They found it probable to effect it in that Time: otherwise They were
to decline the Cessation, and enter upon the Conditions of the Peace;
which if not concluded before the End of the twenty Days, They were to
give it over, and to return to the Parliament.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THESE Propositions, and Restrictions much abated the Hopes of a
good Issue of the Treaty. Yet every Body believed, and the Commissioners
themselves did not doubt, that if such a Progress should be made in the
Treaty, that a Peace was like to ensue, there would be no Difficulty in
the Enlargement of the Time: and therefore the Articles for a Cessation
were the sooner declined, that They might proceed in the main Business,
For though what was proposed by them in Order to it, was agreeable
enough to the Nature of such an Affair; yet the Time allowed for it was
so short, that it was impossible to make it practicable: nor could Notice
be timely given to all the Quarters on either Side, to observe it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>BESIDES that, there were many Particulars in it, which the Officers
on the King's Side (who had no Mind to a Cessation) formalized much
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
upon: and (I know not from what unhappy Root, but) there was sprung
up a wonderful Aversion in the Town against a Cessation. Insomuch as
many Persons of Quality of several Counties, whereof the Town was full,
applied themselves in a Body to the King, not to consent to a Cessation,
till a Peace might be concluded; alledging, that They had several Agita∣tions
in their Countries, for his Majesty's, and their own Conveniencies,
which would be interrupted by the Cessation; and if a Peace should not
afterwards ensue, would be very mischievous. Which Suggestion, if it had
been well weighed, would not have been found to be of Importance.
But the Truth is, the King himself had no Mind to the Cessation, for a<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Reason which shall be mentioned anon, though it was never owned: and
so They waved all farther Mention of the Cessation, and betook them∣selves
to the Treaty; it being reasonable enough to believe, that if both
Sides were heartily disposed to it, a Peace might as soon have been agreed
upon, as a Cessation could be. All the Transactions of that Treaty having
been long since published, and being fit only to be digested into the History
of that Time, are to be omitted here. Only what passed in Secret, and was
never communicated,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Secret Transactions in the Treaty of</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> nor can otherwise be known, since at this Time, no
Man else is living who was privy to that Negotiation, but the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, will have a proper Place in this Discourse.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE Propositions brought by the Commissioners in the Treaty were so
unreasonable, that They well knew that the King would never consent
to them: but some Persons amongst them, who were known to wish well
to the King, endeavoured underhand to bring it to pass. And They did
therefore, whilst They publickly pursued their Instructions, and delivered,
and received Papers upon their Propositions, privately use all the Means
they could, especially in Conferences with the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the King might be prevailed with, in
some Degree to comply with their unreasonable Demands.</P>
<P>IN all Matters which related to the Church, They did not only de∣spair<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of the King's Concurrence, but did not in their own Judgments wish
it; and believed, that the Strength of the Party which desired the Conti∣nuance
of the War, was made up of those, who were very indifferent in
that Point; and that, if They might return with Satisfaction in other Par∣ticulars,
They should have Power enough in the two Houses, to oblige
the more violent People to accept, or submit to the Conditions. They
wished therefore that the King would make some Condescensions in the
Point of the Militia; which They looked upon as the only substantial Se∣curity
They could have, not to be called in Question for what They had
done amiss. And when They saw Nothing could be digested of that Kind,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
which would not reflect both upon the King's Authority, and his Honour,
They gave over insisting upon the General:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Pierre∣point'<HI>s Pro∣position.</HI></NOTE> and then Mr. <HI>Pierrepoint</HI> (who
was of the best Parts, and most intimate with the Earl of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI>)
rather desired than proposed, that the King would offer to grant
his Commission to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to be Lord High Admiral
of <HI>England.</HI> By which Condescension He would be restored to his Office,
which He had lost for their Sakes; and so their Honour would be likewise
repaired, without any signal Prejudice to the King; since He should hold
it only by his Majesty's Commission, and not by any Ordinance of Parlia∣ment;
and He said, if the King would be induced to gratify them in this<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Particular, He could not be confident, that They should be able to pre∣vail
with both Houses to be satisfied therewith, so that a Peace might sud∣denly
be concluded; but as He did not despair even of that, He did be∣lieve,
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
that so many would be satisfied with it, that They would from
thence take the Occasion to separate themselves from them, as Men who
would rather destroy their Country, than restore it to Peace.</P>
<P>AND the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> himself took so much Notice of this
Discourse to Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> (with whom He had as much Freedom, as
his reserved Nature was capable of) as to protest to him, that He desired
only to receive that Honour, and Trust from the King, that He might be
able to do him Service; and thereby to recover the Credit He had un∣happily
lost with him. In which He used very decent Expressions towards
<MILESTONE N="10"/>his Majesty; not without such Reflections upon his own Behaviour, as im∣plied
that He was not proud of it: and concluded, that if his Majesty
would do him that Honour, as to make that Offer to the Houses, upon the
Proposition of the Militia, He would do all He could that it might be ef∣fectual
towards a Peace; and if it had not Success, He would pass his Word
and Honour to the King, that as soon, or whensoever, his Majesty would
please to require it, He would deliver up his Commission again into his
Hands; He having no other Ambition, or Desire, than by this Means to
re-deliver up the Royal Navy to his Majesty's as absolute Disposal, as it was,
when his Majesty first put it into his Hands; and which He doubted
<MILESTONE N="20"/>would hardly be done by any other Expedient, at least not so soon.</P>
<P>WHEN this Proposition (which from the Interest, and Persons who pro∣posed
it, seemed to carry with it some Probability of Success, if it should
be accepted) was communicated with those who were like with most Se∣crecy
to consult it; Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> having already made some Approach
towards the King upon the Subject, and found his Majesty without Incli∣nation
to hear more of it; it was agreed and resolved by them, that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer should presume to make the Proposition
plainly to the King; and to persuade his Majesty to hear it debated in his
Presence: at least, if that might not be, to enlarge upon it himself, as
<MILESTONE N="30"/>much as the Argument required: and He was not unwilling to embark
himself in the Affair.</P>
<P>WHEN He found a fit Opportunity for the Representation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the Chancellor of the Exchequer advises the King to com∣ply with.</NOTE> and his
Majesty at good Leisure, in his Morning's Walk, when He was always
most willing to be entertained, the Chancellor related ingenuously to him
the whole Discourse, which had been made by Mr. <HI>Pierrepoint,</HI> and to
whom; and what the Earl himself had said to Secretary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> and
what Conference They, to whom his Majesty gave Leave to consult toge∣ther
upon his Affairs, had between themselves upon the Argument, and
what occurred to them upon it: in which He mentioned the Earl's De∣merit
<MILESTONE N="40"/>towards his Majesty, with Severity enough, and what Reason He
had, not to be willing to restore a Man to his Favour, who had forfeited
it so unworthily. Yet He desired him to consider his own ill Condition;
and how unlike it was, that it should be improved by the Continuance of
the War; and whether He could ever imagine a Possibility of getting out
of it upon more easy Conditions, than what was now proposed; the Offer
of which to the Parliament could do him no signal Prejudice, and could
not but bring him very notable Advantages: for if the Peace did not ensue
upon it, such a Rupture infallibly would, as might in a little Time facili∣tate
the other. And then He said as much to lessen the Malignity of the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Earl as He could, by remembring, how dutifully He had resigned his
Commission of Admiral, upon his Majesty's Demand; and his Refusal to
accept the Commission the Parliament would have given him: and ob∣served
some Vices in his Nature, which would stand in the Place of Vir∣tues,
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
towards the Support of his Fidelity to his Majesty, and his Animosity
against the Parliament; if He were once re-ingratiated to his Majesty's
Trust.</P>
<P>THE King heard him very quietly without the least Interruption, which
He used not to do upon Subjects which were not grateful to him, for He
knew well, that He was not swayed by any Affection to the Man; to whom
He was more a Stranger, than He was to most of that Condition: and
He upon Occasions, had often made sharp Reflections upon his Ingrati∣tude
to the King. His Majesty seemed at the first to insist upon the Im∣probability,
that any such Concession by him, would be attended with any<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Success; that not only the Earl had not Interest in the Houses, to lead
them into a Resolution, that was only for his particular Benefit; but that
the Parliament it self was not able to make a Peace, without such Condi∣tions,
as the Army would require. And then He should suffer exceedingly
in his Honour, for having shewn an Inclination to a Person, who had re∣quited
his former Graces so unworthily: and this led him into more
Warmth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> than He used to be affected with. He said, “indeed He had
been very unfortunate in conferring his Favours upon many very ungrate∣ful
Persons: but no Man was so inexcusable as the Earl of <HI>Northumber∣land.</HI>”
He said, “He knew that the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was generally<MILESTONE N="20"/>
looked upon as the Man of the greatest Ingratitude; but (He said) He
could better excuse him than the other: that it was true, He owed all
He had to his Father's, and his Bounties; and that himself had con∣ferred
great Favours upon him; but that it was as true, He had fre∣quently
given him many Mortifications, which though He had deserved,
He knew had troubled him very much; that He had oftener denied
him, than any other Man of his Condition; and that He had but lately
refused to gratify him in a Suit He had made to him, of which He had
been very confident; and so might have some Excuse (how ill soever)
for being out of Humour, which led him from one Ill to another; but<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that He had lived always without Intermission, with the Earl of
<HI>Northumberland</HI> as his Friend, and courted him as his Mistress; that
He had never denied any Thing He had ever asked, and therefore his
Carriage to him was never to be forgotten.”</P>
<P>AND this Discourse he continued with more Commotion, and in a more
pathetical Stile, than ever He used upon any other Argument. And though
at that Time it was not fit to press the Matter farther, it was afterwards
resumed by the same Person more than once; but without any other Ef∣fect,
than that his Majesty was contented, that the Earl should not de∣spair
of being restored to that Office, when the Peace should be made; or<MILESTONE N="40"/>
upon any eminent Service performed by him, when the Peace should be
despaired of. The King was very willing and desirous that the Treaty should
be drawn out in Length; to which Purpose a Proposition was made to the
Commissioners, for an Addition of Ten Days, which They sent to the Par∣liament,
without the least Apprehension that it would be denied. But
They were deceived; and for Answer received an Order upon the last Day
but one of the Time before limited, by which They were expresly re∣quired,
to leave <HI>Oxford</HI> the next Day. From that Time, all Intercourse
and Commerce between <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> which had been permitted
before, was absolutely interdicted under the highest Penalties by the Par∣liament.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>IF this secret underhand Proposition had succeeded, and received that
Encouragement from the King, that was desired; and more Application
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
of the same Remedies had been then made to other Persons (for alone it
could never have proved effectual) it is probable, that those violent and
abominable Counsels, which were but then in Projection between very
few Men of any Interest, and which were afterwards miserably put in
Practice, had been prevented. And it was exceedingly wondered at, by
those who were then privy to this Overture, and by all who afterwards
came to hear of it, that the King should in that Conjuncture decline so
advantageous a Proposition; since He did already discern many ill Hu∣mours,
and Factions, growing, and nourished, both in his Court and
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Army, which would every Day be uneasy to him; and did with all his
Soul desire an End of the War. And there was Nothing more suitable and
agreeable to his magnanimous Nature, than to forgive those, who had in
the highest Degree offended him: Which Temper was notorious through∣out
his whole Life. It will not be therefore amiss in this Discourse, to en∣large
upon this fatal Rejection, and the true Cause and Ground thereof.</P>
<P>THE King's Affection to the Queen was of a very extraordinary Alloy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Cause of the King's reject∣ing it.</NOTE>
a Composition of Conscience, and Love, and Generosity, and Gratitude,
and all those noble Affections, which raise the Passion to the greatest
Height; insomuch as He saw with her Eyes; and determined by her Judg∣ment.
<MILESTONE N="20"/>And did not only pay her this Adoration, but desired that all Men
should know that He was swayed by her; which was not Good for either
of them. The Queen was a Lady of great Beauty, excellent Wit and Hu∣mour,
and made him a just Return of noblest Affections; so that They
were the true Idea of conjugal Affection, in the Age in which They lived.
When She was admitted to the Knowledge, and Participation of the most
secret Affairs (from which She had been carefully restrained by the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> whilst He lived) She took Delight in the examining and
discussing them, and from thence in making Judgment of them; in which,
her Passions were always strong.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>SHE had felt so much Pain in knowing Nothing, and medling with No∣thing,
during the Time of that great Favourite, that now She took Plea∣sure
in Nothing but knowing all Things, and disposing all Things: and
thought it but just, that She should dispose of all Favours and Prefer∣ments,
as He had done; at least, that Nothing of that Kind might be
done, without her Privity: not considering, that the universal Prejudice
that great Man had undergone, was not with Reference to his Person, but
his Power: and that the same Power would be equally obnoxious to Mur∣mur
and Complaint, if it resided in any other Person, than the King him∣self.
And She so far concurred with the King's Inclination, that She did
<MILESTONE N="40"/>not more desire to be possessed of this unlimited Power, than that all
the World should take Notice, that She was the entire Mistress of it: which
in Truth (what other unhappy Circumstances soever concurred in the Mis∣chief)
was the Foundation upon which, the first, and the utmost Preju∣dices
to the King, and his Government, were raised, and prosecuted. And
it was her Majesty's, and the Kingdom's Misfortune, that She had not any
Person about her, who had either Ability, or Affection, to inform and ad∣vise
her, of the Temper of the Kingdom, or Humour of the People; or
who thought either worth the caring for.</P>
<P>WHEN the Disturbances grew so rude, as to interrupt this Harmony;
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and the Queen's Fears, and Indisposition, which proceeded from those
Fears, disposed her to leave the Kingdom, which the King to comply with
her, consented to (and if that Fear had not been predominant in her, her
Jealousy, and Apprehension that the King would, at some Time, be pre∣vailed
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
with to yield to some unreasonable Conditions, would have dis∣suaded
her from that Voyage) to make all Things therefore as sure as
might be, that her Absence should not be attended with any such In∣convenience,
his Majesty made a solemn Promise to her at parting, that He
would receive no Person into any Favour, or Trust, who had disserved
him, without her Privity and Consent; and that, as She had undergone so
many Reproaches and Calumnies at the Entrance into the War, so He
would never make any Peace, but by her Interposition, and Mediation, that
the Kingdom might receive that Blessing only from Her.</P>
<P>THIS Promise (of which his Majesty was too Religious an Observer)<MILESTONE N="10"/>
was the Cause of his Majesty's Rejection, or not Entertaining this last
Overture. And this was the Reason that He had that Aversion to the
Cessation; which He thought would inevitably oblige him to consent to
the Peace, as it should be proposed; and therefore He had countenanced
an Address, that had been made to him against it, by the Gentlemen of
several Counties attending the Court: and in Truth They were put upon
that Address by the King's own private Direction. Upon which the Chan∣cellor
of the Exchequer told him, when the Business was over, that He
had raised a Spirit he would not be able to conjure down: And that those
Petitioners had now appeared in a Business that pleased him, but would<MILESTONE N="20"/>
be as ready to appear at another Time, to cross what He desired; which
proved true. For He was afterwards more troubled with Application, and
Importunity of that Kind, and the Murmurs that arose from that Liberty,
when all Men would be Counsellors, and censure all that the Council did,
than with the Power of the Enemy.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Time that the Treaty began, the Queen landed in the
North: And She resolved with a good Quantity of Ammunition, and Arms,
to make what Haste She could to the King: having at her first landing,
expressed by a Letter to his Majesty, her Apprehension of an ill Peace by
that Treaty; and declared, that She would never live in <HI>England,</HI> if She<MILESTONE N="30"/>
might not have a Guard for the Security of her Person: which Letter came
accidentally afterwards into the Hands of the Parliament, of which They
made Use to the Queen's Disadvantage. And the Expectation of her Ma∣jesty's
Arrival at <HI>Oxford,</HI> was the Reason that the King so much desired
the Prolongation of the Treaty. And if it had pleased God that She had
come thither Time enough, as She did shortly after, She would have pro∣bably
condescended to many Propositions for the gratifying particular Per∣sons,
as appeared afterwards, if thereby a reasonable Peace might have
been obtained.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners attended the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
desired his Leave, that there might be a Parliament called in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which his Majesty denied them (well knowing, that They would, against
all the Protestations, and Oaths They had made to him, at his being in
that Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scotish <HI>Commissioners present to the King their Request for the Abolition of Episcopacy.</HI></NOTE> join with those at <HI>Westminster</HI>) They presented a long Pa∣per
to the King, containing a bitter Invective against Bishops, and the
whole Government of the Church; as being contrary to the Word of
God, and to the Advancement of true Religion: and concluded with a
very passionate Desire for the Alteration of that Government, as the only
Means to settle Peace throughout his Majesty's Dominions. In all their
other Demands, concerning the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and calling a Par∣liament<MILESTONE N="50"/>
there, the King had only conserred with two, or three of those He
most trusted, whereof the Chancellor of the Exchequer was always one, and
drew the Answers He gave: But this last Paper which only concerned
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
<HI>England,</HI> He brought to the Council Board, and required their Advice,
what Answer He should give to it. The King himself was very desirous to
take this Occasion, to shew his Affection and Zeal for the Church; and
that other Men's Mouths might be hereafter stopped in that Argument,
and that no Body might ever make the same Proposition to him again, He
had a great Mind to have made an Answer to every Expression in their Pa∣per;
and to have set out the Divine Right of Episcopacy; and how im∣possible
it was ever for him in Conscience to consent to any Thing, to the
Prejudice of that Order and Function, or to the alienating their Lands:
<MILESTONE N="10"/>enlarging himself more in the Debate, than He used to do upon any other
Argument; mentioning those Reasons which the ablest Prelate could do
upon that Occasion; and wished that all those, and such others as might
occur, should be contained in his Answer.</P>
<P>MANY of the Lords were of Opinion, that a short Answer would be
best, that should contain Nothing but a Rejection of the Proposition, with∣out
giving any Reason: no Man seeming to concur with his Majesty, with
which He was not satisfied; and replied with some Sharpness upon what
had been said. Upon which the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> replied, having been be∣fore
of that Mind, desiring that no Reasons might be given; and upon
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that Occasion answered many of those Reasons the King had urged, as
not valid to support the Subject, with a little Quickness of Wit (as his
Notions were always sharp, and expressed with notable Vivacity) which
made the King warmer than He used to be; reproaching all who were of
that Mind, with want of Affection for the Church; and declaring that
He would have the Substance of what He had said, or of the like Nature,
digested into his Answer; with which Reprehension All sat very silent,
having never undergone the like before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King calls upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to deliver his Opinion thereon.</NOTE> Whereupon the King recollect∣ing
himself, and observing, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not
yet spoke, called upon him to deliver his Opinion, adding, that He was
<MILESTONE N="30"/>sure He was of his Majesty's Mind, with Reference to Religion, and the
Church.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor stood up, and said, that He would have been glad to
have said Nothing that Day, having observed more Warmth, than had
ever been at that Board, since He had the Honour to sit there (which was
not many Days before) that in Truth He was not of the Opinion of any
one who had spoken; He did not think that the Answer ought to be very
short, or without any Reasons; and He did as little think, that the Rea∣sons
mentioned by his Majesty, ought to be applied to the Paper, which
the <HI>Scots</HI> had been so bold as to present to the King. He said, all those
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Reasons were fit to be offered in a Synod, or in any other Place, where
that Subject could be lawfully ventilated; and He believed them all to be
of that Weight, that Mr. <HI>Henderson</HI> and all his Assembly of Divines could
never Answer; but He should be very sorry that his Majesty should so far
condescend to their Presumption, as to give those Reasons; as if He ad∣mitted
the Matter to be disputed. He asked his Majesty, what Answer He
would give to the King of <HI>France,</HI> if He should send to him, to alter
the Government of the City of <HI>London,</HI> or any other City, and that He
would substitute other Magistrates in the Place of those, who are; which,
as a King, He might more reasonably demand, than these Gentlemen of
<MILESTONE N="50"/><HI>Scotland</HI> could do what They propose; whether his Majesty would think
it more agreeable to his Honour, to make a reasonable Discourse, of the
Antiquity of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and of the Dependance the pre∣sent
Magistrates had upon the Law, and the Frame of the Government;
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
or whether, He would only send him Word, that He should meddle with
what He had to do. He did think, that it was very sit that his Majesty's
Answer to this Paper should contain a very severe, and sharp Reprehen∣sion
for their Presumption; and take Notice, how solicitous They were
for the Preservation of what They called the Right and Privilege of their
Country, that his Majesty might not bring any Thing into Debate at his
Council Board here, that concerned the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though it had
often too much Relation to the Affairs and Government of <HI>England;</HI> yet
that They would take upon them to demand from his Majesty, at least
to advise him to make, an Alteration in the Government of <HI>England,</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
which would quite alter the Frame of it, and make such a Confusion in
the Laws; which They could no more comprehend, than They could
any of the same Kind, that related to any other foreign Kingdom; and
therefore, that for the Future They should not practise the like Pre∣sumption.</P>
<P>THE King discovered himself to be very well pleased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With which the King is well satisfied.</NOTE> all the Time He
was Speaking; and when He had done, his Majesty said again, He was
sure the Chancellor was entirely of his Mind, with Reference to the
Church; and that He had satisfied him, that this was not the Season, nor
the Occasion, in which those Arguments, which He had used, were to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
be insisted on; and that He was willing to depart from his own Sense;
and was in Truth so well pleased, that He vouchsafed to make some kind
of Excuse for the Passion He had spoken with; and all the Lords were
very well satisfied with the Expedient proposed; and all commended the
Chancellor: and the Answer was given to the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners ac∣cordingly:
who had too good Intelligence, not to know all that had
passed; and upon their long Discourses with the King (who was always
forward to enlarge upon that Subject, in which He was so well versed)
expected such an Answer, as might give them Opportunity to bring the
whole Matter of Episcopacy upon the Stage, and into publick Disputa∣tion.<MILESTONE N="30"/>
And so They returned to <HI>London,</HI> with manifest Dissatisfaction, be∣fore
the Commissioners of the Parliament; and with avowed Detestation
of a Person, against whom They were known always to have an invete∣rate,
and an implacable Displeasure.</P>
<P>THE King was much troubled at <HI>the Disunion between the Princes</HI> Ru∣pert,
<HI>and</HI> Maurice, <HI>and the Marquis of</HI> Hertford, <HI>after the taking of</HI>
Bristol; which He knew must exceedingly disorder and divide that Ar∣my:
For composing whereof, his Majesty resolved the next Day after the
News, to go himself to <HI>Bristol;</HI> which was very necessary in many
Respects. The Settlement of the Port, which was of infinite Importance<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to the King in Point of Trade, and his Customs, and with Reference to
<HI>Ireland;</HI> and the applying the Army to some new Enterprize, without
Loss of Time, could not be done without his Majesty's Presence. But there
was Nothing more disposed his Majesty to that Resolution, than to be ab∣sent
from his Council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> when He should settle the Differences
between the Princes, and the Marquis; for as He was always swayed by
his Affection to his Nephews, which He did not think Partiality; so the
Lords, towards whom the Princes did not live with any Condescension,
were very solicitous, that the Marquis might receive no Injustice, or Dis∣obligation.
And the King, to avoid all Counsel in this Particular, re∣solved<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to declare no Resolution, till He should come himself to <HI>Bristol;</HI>
and so went from <HI>Oxford</HI> thither; taking with him, of the Council, the
Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> the Master of the Rolls, and the
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
Chancellor of the Exchequer. The King lodging the first Night at <HI>Malms∣bury;</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> the Master of the Rolls, and some other
Gentlemen lodging that Night with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at
his House at <HI>Pirton,</HI> which lay in the Way to <HI>Bristol;</HI> where They were
the next Day within an Hour after the King.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer had undergone some Mortification,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chanceller of the Exche∣quer's Office invaded by Mr.</HI> Ashburn∣ham.</NOTE>
during the short Abode at <HI>Bristol,</HI> which was the only Port of Trade
within the King's Quarters; which was like to yield a considerable Benefit
to the King, if it were well managed; and the Direction thereof belonged
<MILESTONE N="10"/>entirely to his Office; but when He sent to the Officers of the Customs, to
be informed of the present State of Trade, He found that some Treaty
was made, and Order given in it by Mr. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> a Groom of the
Bedchamber; who, with the Assistance, and Advice of Sir <HI>John Colepep∣per,</HI>
had prevailed with the King, to assign that Province to him, as a
Means to raise a present Sum of Money for the Supply of the Army: which,
the Chancellor took very heavily, and the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> out of his Friend∣ship
to him, more tenderly; and expostulated it with the King with some
Warmth; and more passionately with Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ash∣burnham,</HI>
as a Violation of the Friendship They professed to the Chancel∣lor,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and an Invasion of his Office; which no Man bears easily.</P>
<P>THEY were both ashamed of it, and made some weak Excuses, of In∣cogitance
and Inadvertence; and the King himself, who discerned the
Mischief that would ensue, if there should be an apparent Schism amongst
those He so entirely trusted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King in∣terposes there∣in.</NOTE> was pleased to take Notice of it to the Chan∣cellor,
with many gracious Expressions; and said, “that Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI>
being Treasurer, and Paymaster of the Army, He did believe some Mo∣ney
might have been raised for the present Occasion; and only intended
it for the Present, without considering, it would be an Invasion of his
Right; and therefore directed, that an Account should be given to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>him of all that had been done, and He should do as He thought fit.”
But when He understood all that had been done, He would make no Al∣teration
in it, that his Majesty might be convinced, that his Service was
not looked after in the Design. And it was discernable enough, that
Mr. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who usually looked very far before him, had not so
much intended to disoblige the Chancellor, as by introducing himself this
Way into the Customs, to continue one of the Farmers of the Customs,
when the War should be at an End; of which He got a Promise from the
King at the same Time; who had great Affection for him, and an ex∣traordinary
Opinion of his Managery. If there remained after this any Jea∣lousy
<MILESTONE N="40"/>or Coldness between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the other
Two, as the Disparity between their Natures, and Humours, made some
believe there did, it never brake out or appeared, to the Disturbance, or
Prejudice of the King's Service; but all possible Concurrence in the car∣rying
it on, was observed between them.</P>
<P>THE March of the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Glocester,</HI> over as large
a Campania as any in <HI>England,</HI> when the King had an Army of above
eight thousand Horse, reputed victorious, without being put to strike one
Stroke—the Circumstances of that Siege; and the raising it—the Earl's
March, after he had performed that great Work; and when the King's
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Army watched only to engage him in a Battle; and passing over a large
and open Campania, three Days before the King had Notice, that He
was come out of <HI>Glocester</HI>—the overtaking the Army; and the Battle by
<HI>Newbury</HI>—and his Retreat afterwards to <HI>London;</HI> contained so many
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
particular Actions of Courage, and Conduct, that They all deserve a very
punctual, and just Relation; and are much above the Level of this plain,
and foreign Discourse.</P>
<P>IN this Battle of <HI>Newbury,</HI> the Chancellor of the Exchequer lost the
Joy and Comfort of his Life; which He lamented so passionately, that
He could not in many Days compose himself to any Thoughts of Business.
His dear Friend the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Lord</HI> Falk∣land.</NOTE> hurried by his Fate, in the Morning
of the Battle, as He was naturally inquisitive after Danger, put himself
into the Head of Sir <HI>John Byron's</HI> Regiment, which He believed was like
to be in the hottest Service, and was then appointed to charge a Body of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Foot; and in that Charge was shot with a Musket Bullet, so that He fell
dead from his Horse. The same Day that the News came to <HI>Oxford</HI> of his
Death, which was the next after He was killed, the Chancellor received a
Letter from him, written at the Time when the Army rose from <HI>Glo∣cester;</HI>
but the Messenger had been employed in other Service, so that He
came not to <HI>Oxford</HI> till that Day. The Letter was an Answer to one the
Chancellor had then sent to him; in which He had told him, how much
He suffered in his Reputation with all discreet Men, by engaging himself
unnecessarily in all Places of Danger: And that it was not the Office of a
Privy Counsellor, and a Secretary of State, to visit the Trenches, as He<MILESTONE N="20"/>
usually did; and conjured him, out of the Conscience of his Duty to the
King, and to free his Friends from those continual uneasy Apprehensions,
not to engage his Person to those Dangers, which were not incumbent to
him. His Answer was, that the Trenches were now at an End, there
would be no more Danger there: That his Case was different from other
Men's; that He was so much taken Notice of for an impatient Desire of
Peace, that it was necessary that He should likewise make it appear, that
it was not out of Fear of the utmost Hazard of War: He said some me∣lancholick
Things of the Time; and concluded, that in few Days They
should come to a Battle, the Issue whereof, He hoped, would put an End<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to the Misery of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>MUCH hath been said of this excellent Person before; but not so much,
or so well, as his wonderful Parts, and Virtues deserved. He died as
much of the Time as of the Bullet: For from the very beginning of the
War, He contracted so deep a Sadness and Melancholy, that his Life was
not pleasant to him; and sure He was too weary of it. Those who did not
know him very well, imputed, very unjustly, much of it to a violent Pas∣sion
He had for a Noble Lady: And it was the more spoken of, because
She died the same Day, and as some computed it, in the same Hour that
He was killed; but They who knew either the Lord, or the Lady, knew<MILESTONE N="40"/>
well, that neither of them was capable of an ill Imagination. She was of
the most unspotted, unblemished Virtue, never married, of an extraordi∣nary
Talent of Mind, but of no alluring Beauty, nor of a Constitution of
tolerable Health, being in a deep Consumption, and not like to have lived
so long by many Months. It is very true, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> had an ex∣traordinary
Esteem of her, and exceedingly loved her Conversation, as
most of the Persons of eminent Parts of that Time did; for She was in her
Understanding, and Discretion, and Wit, and Modesty, above most Wo∣men;
the best of which had always a Friendship with her. But He was
withal so kind to his Wife, whom He knew to be an excellent Person,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that, though He loved his Children with more Affection and Fondness,
than most Fathers use to do, He left by his Will all He had to his Wife;
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
and committed his three Sons, who were all the Children he had, to her
sole Care and Bounty.</P>
<P>HE was little more than thirty Years of Age when He was killed; in
which Time He was very accomplished in all those Parts of Learning, and
Knowledge, which most Men labour to attain, till They are very Old;
and in Wisdom, and the Practice of Virtue, to a wonderful Perfection.
From his Age of twenty Years, He had lived in an entire Friendship with
the Chancellor, who was about six Months elder; and who never spake
of him afterwards, but with a Love, and a Grief, which still raised some
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Commotion in him. And He very often used to lament him, in the Words
of <HI>Cicero</HI> concerning <HI>Hortensius, Quod magnâ Sapientium &amp; Civium bono∣rum
Penuriâ, Vir egregius, conjunctissimusque mecum Consiliorum omnium So∣cietate,
alienissimo Reipublicoe Tempore extinctus, &amp; Auctoritatis, &amp; Pru∣dentioe
suoe, triste nobis Desiderium reliquerat.</HI> And without Doubt, it was
in a Conjuncture of Time, when the Death of every honest and discreet
Person was a very sensible, and terrible Loss, in the Judgment of all good
Men.</P>
<P>AFTER the unhappy Death of the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> the King much de∣sired
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be Secretary of State in
<MILESTONE N="20"/>his Place; which the Queen did not oppose, though She rather wished
that the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> might have it; who had so much Kindness and
Friendship for the Chancellor (which was at that Time, and long after, as
Sincere as could receive Harbour in his Breast) that He professed, He would
not have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chencel∣lor of the Ex∣chequer re¦fuses the Of∣fice of Secre∣tary of State a second Time.</NOTE> if the other would receive it: but the Chancellor gratified his
Civility, and refused the Office, the second Time, as He had once be∣fore.
And He had so much more Reason now, by the coming of a very
specious Embassy from <HI>France,</HI> in the Person of the Count of <HI>Harcourt,</HI>
who was already arrived in <HI>London;</HI> in which the Chancellor knew his
own Want of Ability, to act that Part, the Office of Secretary would have
<MILESTONE N="30"/>obliged him to; and for which, as far as the Perfection of the <HI>French</HI>
Tongue could qualify him, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was very proper; and so He
was made Secretary of State; professing to every Body, that as He had the
Office by the Chancellor's Refusal of it, so He would wholly advise with
him in all Things pertaining to it, which He always did; and the Confi∣dence
and Friendship between them was mutual, and very notorious, un∣til
that Lord changed his Religion. And He was no sooner admitted and
sworn Secretary of State, and Privy-Counsellor, and consequently made of
the <HI>Junto,</HI> which the King at that Time created, consisting of the Duke
of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> the two Secretaries of State, and Sir
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>John Colepepper,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is added to the Junto.</NOTE> but the Chancellor of the Exchequer was likewise added;
to the Trouble, at least the Surprize, of the Master of the Rolls; who
could have been contented, that He should have been excluded from that
near Trust, where all Matters were to be consulted, before they should be
brought to the Council Board. And this Committee was appointed to
treat with the Count of <HI>Harcourt;</HI> whom the King believed to be sent
from <HI>France,</HI> to demand any Thing from the Parliament in that King's
Name, as his Majesty should direct; and therefore They were appointed
to consider well, what He should be directed to propose.</P>
<P>BUT the Ambassador no sooner came to the Town in great State and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Lustre, but He quickly saved them any farther Labour, by declaring, that
He would treat with no Body but the King himself; his Business being
only to serve the King, with Reference to the Differences between his Ma∣jesty,
and the Parliament; and pretended that in his short Stay at <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
He had already discovered that his Majesty was betrayed; and that his most
secret Counsels were discovered: and so there was never any Commmunica∣tion
between him, and the King's Council; but all Matters were transacted
with the King himself, and Queen, and Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who was not of
the Council, and the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> the Queen promising herself very much
from his Negotiation; the Ambassador being then of great Reputation,
having been General of the <HI>French</HI> Army in two or three great Actions, in
which his Success had been very notable; and the Queen looked upon him
as a Person particularly devoted to her Service; and being of the House of
<HI>Lorrain</HI> (the younger Son of the Duke <HI>d'Elboeuf)</HI> He was not without<MILESTONE N="10"/>
some Alliance to the King; and so He returned to <HI>London</HI> with such In∣structions,
and Advice as They thought fit to entrust him with; which
were too Particular; and with the Privity only of the two other Persons
mentioned before.</P>
<P>BUT it quickly appeared after, that He was not sent with any Purpose
to do the King Service; but that Gardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> (who was newly en∣tered
upon the Ministry, after the Death of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI>) might take
such a View of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> as the better to judge what He was
to do; and that an Accommodation there might not break his Measures,
with Reference to his other Designs; which the Ambassador was easily<MILESTONE N="20"/>
satisfied it was not like to do. And so, after three, or four Months spent
between <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> He returned to <HI>France;</HI> leaving the King's
Affairs so much worse than He found them, by having communicated
some Instructions, which had been given him at <HI>Oxford,</HI> with over much
Confidence, and which less disposed some Persons to Peace than They had
been, at <HI>London,</HI></P>
<P>THE King called the Chancellor one Day to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King di∣rects the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare a Proclamation for dissolving the Parlia∣ment at <HI>West∣minster.</HI></NOTE> and told him, “that
He thought there was too much Honour done to those Rebels at <HI>West∣minster</HI>
in all his Declarations, by his mentioning them as Part of the
Parliament; which as long as They should be thought to be, They would<MILESTONE N="30"/>
have more Authority by their continuing their Sitting in the Place, whi∣ther
They were first called, than all the other Members, though so
much more numerous, would have, when They should be convened any
where else (there being a Thought of convening them to <HI>Oxford</HI>) there∣fore
He knew no Reason why He should not positively declare them to
be dissolved; and so forbid them to sit or meet any more there. He said,
that He knew learned Men of an Opinion, that that Act for the conti∣nuance
of the Parliament was void from the Beginning; and that it is not
in the Power of the King, to bar himself from the Power of dissolving
it; which is to be deprived of an essential Part of his Sovereignty: But<MILESTONE N="40"/>
if the Act were good and valid in Law, They had dissolved themselves,
by their Force, in driving so many Members, and even his Majesty him∣self,
who was their Head, from the Parliament; and had forfeited
their Right of Sitting there, and all that the Act had given them, by
their Treason, and Rebellion; which the very being a Parliament could
not support: And therefore He wished, that a Proclamation might be
prepared, to declare them actually dissolved; and expresly forbidding
them to meet, or any Body to own them, or submit to them, as a Par∣liament.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to the King on that Subject.</NOTE> that “He perceived by his Majesty's Dis∣course,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that He had very much considered the Argument, and was well
prepared in it; which for his Part He was not. But He besought him
to think it worth a very strict Reflection; and to hear the Opinion of
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
learned Men, before He resolved upon it. That it was of a very nice
and delicate Nature, at which not only the People in general, but those
of his own Party, and even of his Council, would take more Umbrage,
than upon any one Particular, that had happened since the Beginning of
the War. That He could not imagine that his forbidding them to meet
any more at <HI>Westminster,</HI> would make one Man the less to meet there;
but He might forbid them upon such Grounds and Reasons, as might
bring more to them: And that They who had severed themselves from
them, upon the Guilt of their Actions; might return, and be reconciled
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to them, upon their Unity of Opinion. That it had been the
first powerful Reproach They had corrupted the People with, towards
his Majesty, that He intended to dissolve this Parliament, notwithstand∣ing
the Act for Continuance thereof; and if He had Power to do that,
He might likewise by the same Power, repeal all the other Acts made
this Parliament; whereof some were very precious to the People: And
as his Majesty had always disclaimed any such Thought, so such a Procla∣mation
as He now mentioned, would confirm all the Fears and Jea∣lousies,
which had been infused into them; and would trouble many of
his own true Subjects.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>“THAT for the Invalidity of the Act from the Beginning, He was in his
own Opinion inclined to hope, that it might be originally void; for the
Reasons and Grounds his Majesty had mentioned; and that the Parliament
it self, if this Rebellion was suppressed, might be of the same
Judgment, and declare it accordingly, which would enable him quickly
to dissolve it: But till then, He thought all the Judges together, even
those who were in his own Quarters, and of unquestionable Affection to
his Majesty, would not declare any such Invalidity; and much less, that
any private Man, how learned soever, would avow that Judgment: in
which his Majesty might easily satisfy himself, having so many of the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Judges, and many other excellent Men of the Robe then at <HI>Oxford.</HI>
For their having dissolved themselves, or forfeited their Right of Sitting
there, by their Treason and Rebellion, <HI>He said,</HI> He could less under∣stand
it, than the other Argument of Invalidity; for that the Treason,
and Rebellion could only concern, and be penal to the Persons who
committed them; it was possible many might fit there, He was sure
many had a Right to fit there, who had always opposed every Illegal,
and every Rebellious Act; and therefore the Faults of the others, could
never forfeit any Right of theirs, who had committed no Fault. And
upon the whole Matter, concluded as He had begun, that his Majesty
<MILESTONE N="40"/>would very throughly consult it, before He did so much as incline in his
own Wishes.”</P>
<P>His Majesty said, He had spoken more Reason against it, than He
had thought could have been alledged: However, He bade him confer
with his Attorney General, who, He believed, was of another Opinion.
The Chancellor moved his Majesty, that since the Ground of what should
be resolved on in this Point, must be expressed in the Proclamation, the
Attorney might put his own Conceptions in Writing, and then his Ma∣jesty
would the better judge of them. The King said, it seemed rea∣sonable
to him, and He had proposed it to him, but He had declined it,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and commended the Pen his Majesty had used to employ, as very clear and
significant; and said, if He had an Hour's Conference with that Person,
the Business would be done. Whereupon the Chancellor went immediately
to his Lodging, chusing rather to use that Civility towards him, than to
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
send for him; who did not love him so well as He had done, before He
was his superior Officer.</P>
<P>AFTER a long Conference together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Confe∣rences with the Attorney General there∣on.</NOTE> and many Circumlocutions (which
was his natural Way of Discourse) and asking Questions, <HI>why not this?</HI> and
<HI>why not that?</HI> without expressing his own Opinion; at last He confessed,
that there must be no Attempt to dissolve them, “though it might be
even that might be lawful in many Respects,” but that it would be suf∣ficient
to declare the Force which had been, and still was upon them, that
rendered them not Free; and so They ought not to be looked upon as a
Parliament: And that They might be required, to adjourn from Time,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to Time, till all the Members might with Safety repair to, and sit with
them; in all which the other agreed with him, and so They parted; the
Chancellor promising that, against the next Morning, He would prepare
a Proclamation agreeable to that, which He thought to be their joint
Meaning; for He did not observe any Difference to be between them.
The next Morning the Attorney came to his Lodging, where He found
the Draught prepared, which as soon as He had read, He said did in no
Degree express, or comprehend the Sense that had been agreed between
them: And thereupon, He entered again into the same Discourse He had
made before, and more perplexed than before; being most offended with<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the Preamble, wherein it was declared, that the King neither could, or
intended, to break the Parliament: which was so contrary to what He had
infused into the King; and which the Chancellor thought most necessary,
to contradict that Reproach, which naturally would be cast upon his Ma∣jesty.
In the End, when He had wearied himself with the Debate, They
came both again to mean the same Thing; which was no other, than was
agreed before, though as the Attorney said, it was not expressed in the
Draught before them: whereupon it was agreed between them, that
against the next Morning, either of them should make a Draught apart;
and then, when They came together, it would easily be adjusted.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>BUT the next Morning They were as far asunder as before, and the
Attorney had prepared no Paper, and said, it needed not, the Difference
being very small, and would be rectified with changing, or leaving out a
Word or two; which the Chancellor desired him to do, and to leave out,
or put in, what He pleased: which when He went about to do, twenty
other Things occurred to him; and so He entered upon new Discourses,
without concluding any Thing; and every Day entertained the King with
an Account, as if all were agreed; but upon Conference with the Chan∣cellor,
his Majesty wondered at the Delay, and told him, He wondered
at it, for the Attorney spake still as clearly to him, as it was possible for<MILESTONE N="40"/>
any Man to do, and therefore the putting it in Writing could not be hard.
The other answered him, that it would never be done any other Way,
than that, which He had first proposed to him; and therefore besought his
Majesty, that He would oblige the Attorney to put his own Conceptions,
which He made so clear to him, into Writing; and then, his Majesty
having likewise what the Chancellor prepared in his Hands, He would
easily conclude which should stand; and otherwise there would never be any
Conclusion.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whose Draught of a Proclamation the King shews to the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE> the Chancellor came into the Garden where the
King was walking; and calling him shortly to him, in some Disorder,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
his Majesty told him, “He was never in that Amazement in his Life;
that He had at last, not without a very positive Command, obliged the
Attorney to bring him such a Draught in Writing, as was agreeable to
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
his own Sense; and that He had now done it; but in such a Manner,
that He no more understood what the Meaning of it was, than if it were
in <HI>Welch,</HI> which was the Language of the Attorney's Country: only,
He said, “He was very sure it contained nothing of the Sense He had ever
“expressed to him;” and so bade him follow him into a little Room at the
End of the Garden; where as soon as He was entered He shut the Door,
because there were many People in the Garden; and then pulled a Paper
out of his Pocket, and bade him read it; which when he had done, it
being all in the Attorney's own Hand, He said, “it deserved Wonder in∣deed;”
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and it was so rough, perplexed, and insignificant, that no Man
could judge by it, or out of it, what the Writer proposed to himself. And
it made so great an Impression upon the King (who had before thought him
a Man of a Master Reason, and that no Man had so clear Notions) that He
never after had any Esteem of him.</P>
<P>THE Truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Attorney General.</NOTE> He was a Man very unlike any other Man; of a very
good natural Wit, improved by Conversation with learned Men, but not
at all by Study and Industry: And then his Conversation was most with
Men, though much superior to him in Parts, who rather admired, than
informed him, of which his Nature (being the proudest Man living) made
<MILESTONE N="20"/>him not capable, because not desirous. His greatest Faculty was, and in
which He was a Master, to make difficult Matters more intricate and per∣plexed;
and very easy Things to seem more hard than they were. The
King considered the Matter and Subject of that Proclamation, at the
Council; where that Draught the Chancellor had provided, was agreed
to; and the Attorney seemed to be satisfied in it; and was content to have
it believed, that it had been consulted with him; though He never for∣gave
the Chancellor for exposing him in that Manner; by which He found
He had lost much Ground.</P>
<P>AFTER the Treaty of <HI>Uxbridge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Approbation of the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer's Behaviour in the Treaty of</HI> Uxbridge.</NOTE> most of the Commissioners had given so
<MILESTONE N="30"/>good a Testimony of the Chancellor's Diligence and Industry, that the
King, shortly after his Return, very graciously took Notice of it to him;
and above all, of his Affection to the Church, of which, He said, Dr. <HI>Steward</HI>
had so fully informed him, that He looked upon him as one of the few,
who was to be relied upon in that Particular: at which He said, himself
was not at all surprized, having long known his Affection, and Judgment
in that Point; but confessed He was surprized with the Carriage of some
others, from whom He had expected another kind of Behaviour, in Mat∣ters
of the Church; and named Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgman,</HI> upon whom He
said, He had always looked, being the Son of a Bishop, as so firm, that
<MILESTONE N="40"/>He could not be shaken; and therefore He was the more amazed, to hear
what Condescensions He had been willing to have made, in what con∣cerned
Religion; and pressed the Chancellor to answer some Questions He
asked him about that Transaction: to the Particulars whereof He excused
himself from answering, by the Protestation, They had all taken before
the Treaty, with his Majesty's Approbation: though indeed himself had
been very much surprized with the first Discovery of that Temper in that
Gentleman, which He had never before suspected: and ever after said,
that “He was a Man of excellent Parts, and honestly inclined; and would
chuse much rather to do well than ill; but if it were not safe for him to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>be steady in those Resolutions, He was so much given to find out Expe∣dients
to satisfy unreasonable Men, that He would at last be drawn to
yield to any Thing, He should be powerfully pressed to do.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="97"/>
THE <HI>King at that Time having resolved to separate the Prince his Son
from himself, by sending him into the West,</HI> the Chancellor had a great De∣sire
to excuse himself from attending upon the Prince in that Journey;
and represented to his Majesty, that his Office made it more proper for
him to be near his Majesty's Person; and therefore renewed his Suit again
to him, that his Service might be spared in that Employment: which He
was the less inclined to, because He had discovered, that neither the Duke
of <HI>Richmond,</HI> or the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> did intend to wait upon his High∣ness
in that Expedition: But the King told him positively, and with some
Warmth, that if He would not go, He would not send his Son: where∣upon<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He submitted to do any Thing which His Majesty should judge fit
for his Service.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor speaking one Day with the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who
was exceedingly kind to him, of the ill State of the King's Affairs, and of
the Prince's Journey into the West, the Duke asked him, whether He was
well resolved to carry the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> when He should be requi∣red.
He answered, that there had been no such Thing mentioned to him,
nor could He ever be made instrumental in it, but in one Case, which was,
to prevent his falling into the Hands of the Parliament; and in that Case, He
did believe every honest Man would rather advise his going any whither, than<MILESTONE N="20"/>
be taken by them: Yet even in that Case, He should prefer many Places
before <HI>France.</HI> The Duke wished He might stay till then, implying that
He doubted it was the present Design; but there was never any Thing
discovered to make it believed, that there was a Design at that Time for∣med
to such a Purpose: yet the Lord <HI>Dighy,</HI> who had all Familiarity,
and Confidence with the Chancellor, shortly after gave him Occasion to
apprehend, that there might even then be some such Intention.</P>
<P>AFTER a long Discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Digby'<HI>s Discourse with the Chancellor concerning the Prince's going to</HI> France.</NOTE> of the great Satisfaction the King had in his
(the Chancellor's) Service; and how much He was pleased with his Beha∣viour
in the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> and that He had not a greater Confi∣dence<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in any Man's Affection, and Fidelity; He said, his Majesty had a
great Mind to confer with him upon a Point of the last Importance; but
that He was kept from it, by an Apprehension, that He was of a diffe∣rent
Judgment from his Majesty in that Particular. The other answered,
that He was very sorry that the King was reserved for such a Reason; for
though he knew, the Chancellor did never pretend to think one Thing,
when He did think another, and so might take the Boldness to differ from
his Majesty in his Judgment; yet the King could not believe, that He
would discover the Secret, or refuse to do any Thing that became an ho∣nest
Man, upon his Command, though He did not believe it counsellable.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Whereupon, He entered upon a very reasonable Consideration, of the low
Condition of the King; of the Discontent and Murmur of the Court, and
of the Camp; how very difficult a Thing it was like to be, to raise such
an Army as would be fit to take the Field; and how much more unfit it
would be, for the King to suffer himself to be enclosed in any Garrison;
which He must be, if there were no Army for him to be in. If the first
Difficulty should be mastered, and an Army made ready to march, there
could be little Doubt, how great soever their Distractions were at <HI>London,</HI>
but that the Parliament would be able to send another more numerous,
and much better supplied than the King's could be; and then, if the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
King's Army was beaten, He could have no Hope ever to raise another;
his Quarters already being very streight; and after a Defeat, the victorious
Army would find no Opposition; nor was there any Garrison that could
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
oppose them any considerable Time; <HI>London</HI> would pour out more
Forces; that all the West would be swallowed up in an Instant; and in
such a Case He asked him, whether He would not think it fit, and assist
to the carrying the Prince out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Reply.</NOTE> He would deliver his Opinion freely to him,
and was willing He should let the King know it. That such a Prospect
as He had supposed, might, and ought to be prudently considered; but
that it must be with great Secresy, for that there were already to his Know∣ledge,
some Whispers of such a Purpose; and that it was the true End of
<MILESTONE N="10"/>sending the Prince into the West; which, if it should be believed, it would
never be in their Power to execute, though the Occasion should be most
pressing; therefore desired there might not be the least Whisper of any
Contingency, that might make it fit. For the Matter it self, it must never
be done, upon any Supposition of a Necessity; but when the Necessity
should be real, and in View, it ought to be resolved, and executed at
once: And He would make no Scruple of carrying him rather into <HI>Turkey,</HI>
than suffering him to be made a Prisoner to the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby</HI> replied, that though the King would be very well
pleased with this Opinion of his, yet He would not be surprized with it;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>since He knew his Affection, and Wisdom to be such, that in such an Ex∣tremity,
He could not but have that Resolution: therefore that was not
the Point that the King doubted He would differ with him in. Then He
continued the Discourse, that He hoped there would not such an Occasion
fall out; and that the Divisions at <HI>London</HI> would yet open some Door for
a good Peace to enter at; but if They should unite, and should send out
a strong Army, and likewise appoint the <HI>Scots</HI> to march towards them;
how the King would do between two such Armies, was a terrible Pros∣pect:
and then the least Blow would raise so general a Consternation, that
the King would be more disquieted by his Friends, and Servants, than by
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the Enemy: That his Council was so constituted, that They would look
upon the Prince's leaving the Kingdom, as less advisable, than giving
himself up to the Parliament; and that many Men were yet so weak, as to
believe, that the best Way the King could take for his Security, and
Preservation of his Posterity, was, to deliver up both Himself, and all his
Children, into the Hands of the Parliament; and that They would then
give him better Conditions, than They had offered in their Treaties;
having it then in their Power to keep all such Persons from him, as They
were dissatisfied with.</P>
<P>IF this Opinion should once spread it self, as upon any signal Defeat it
<MILESTONE N="40"/>would undoubtedly do, it must be expected, that the Council, and most
of the Lords, who looked upon themselves as ruined for their Loyalty,
out of their natural Apprehension, would imagine, that the Prince being
then in the West, and at Liberty to do what should be thought fit, would
be directed by the King, to transport himself into Parts beyond the Sea;
and the Queen his Mother being then in <HI>France,</HI> most probably thither;
which was a Circumstance that would likewise make his Transportation
more universally odious. So that upon this Reflection, and erroneous Ani∣madversion,
the King would be, in the first unfortunate Conjuncture, im∣portuned
by all about him, to send for the Prince; or at least to send such
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Orders to those to whose Care He was entrusted, that They should not
presume to transport him beyond the Seas, in what Exigent soever. Most
Men would believe, that They should merit of the Parliament by this Ad∣vice,
and would prosecute it with the more Earnestness and Importunity;
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
whilst those Few who discerned the Mischief and Ruin that must flow
from it, would not have the Courage to deliver their Opinions in Publick,
for Fear of being accused of the Counsel; and by this Means the King
might be so wearied and tired with Importunity, that against his Judg∣ment,
He might be prevailed with, to sign such a Direction and Order,
as is before mentioned; though his Majesty was clearly satisfied in his Un∣derstanding,
that if both himself and the Prince were in their Hands toge∣ther,
the best that could happen, would be Murdering him, and Crown∣ing
his Son; whereas if his Son were at Liberty, and out of their Reach,
They would get Nothing by his Death, and consequently would not at∣tempt<MILESTONE N="10"/>
it.</P>
<P>THIS he said, was the fatal Conjuncture the King apprehended; and He
then asked the Chancellor, what He would do. To which He answered,
without pausing, that He hoped the King had made up a firm Resolution
never to depart from his own Virtue, upon which his Fate depended: and
that if He forsook himself, He had no Reason to depend upon the Con∣stancy
of any other Man, who had Nothing to support that Confidence, but
the Conscience of doing what was just: that no Man could doubt the Law∣fulness
of obeying him, in carrying the Prince out of the Kingdom, to
avoid his being taken by the Rebels; and He was not only ready to obey<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in that Case, but would confidently advise it, as a Thing in Policy and Pru∣dence
necessary to be done. But if the King, being at Liberty, and with
his own Counsellors and Servants, should under his Hand forbid the Prince
to transport himself, and forbid all about him, to suffer it to be done, He
would never be guilty of disobeying that express Command; though He
should be very sorry to receive it. He wished the King would speak with
him of it, that He might take the Boldness to conjure him, never to put
an honest, and a faithful Servant to that unjust Streight, to do any Thing
expresly contrary to his plain, and positive Command, upon Pretence, of
knowing his secret Pleasure; which is exposing him to publick Justice,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and Reproach, which can never be wiped out by the Conscïence of the
other; and that the Artifice was not worthy the Royal Breast of a great
Monarch. This, he said, was still upon the Supposition of the King's
Liberty; but if He were a Prisoner in the Hands of his Enemies (though
that should not shake his Resolution, or make him say Things He doth
not intend, upon Imagination that others will know his Meaning) the Case
would be different; and honest Men would pursue former Resolutions,
though They should be countermanded, according to Circumstances.</P>
<P>THE Conference ended; and was never after resumed: nor did the
King ever in the least Degree, enter upon the Argument with the Chan∣cellor,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
though He had many private Conferences with him upon all that
occurred to him with Reference to what the Prince should do in the West;
and of all the melancholick Contingencies, which might fall out in his
own Fortune. And it was generally believed, that his Majesty had a much
greater Confidence in the Chancellor, than in the other, whose Judgment
He had no Reverence for; and this made the Chancellor afterwards be∣lieve,
that all the other Discourse from the Lord <HI>Dighy,</HI> proceeded rather
from some Communication of Counsels He had with the Queen, than any
Directions from the King. And He did upon concurrent Circumstances ever
think, that the Queen did from the first Minute of the Separation of the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Prince, from the King, intend to draw his Highness into <HI>France,</HI> that He
might be near her, and under her Tuition, before any Thing in the de∣clension
of the King's Fortune required it, or made it counsellable; and
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
therefore had appointed the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> her Creature, who She knew had
great Friendship with the Chancellor, to feel his Pulse, and discover, whe∣ther
He (in whom She had never Confidence) might be applicable to her
Purposes. But He often declared, that the King himself never intimated
the least Thought of the Prince's leaving the Kingdom, till after the Bat∣tle
of <HI>Naseby;</HI> and when <HI>Fairfax</HI> was marched with his Army into the
West; and himself was in Despair of being able to raise another Army;
and even then, when He signified his Pleasure to that Purpose, He left
the Time, and the Manner, and the Place to them, who were especially
<MILESTONE N="10"/>trusted by him, about the Prince; as will appear by the particular Pa∣pers
which are preserved of that Affair; and wherein it will likewise ap∣pear,
that his Majesty received infinite Satisfaction, and Content in the
whole Management of that Affair, and the happy and secure Transporta∣tion
of the Prince, in the just and proper Season, and when all the King∣dom
was right glad that it was done.</P>
<P>As his Majesty was more particularly gracious to the Chancellor from
the Time of the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> so there was no Day passed, without
his conferring with him in private upon his most secret Considerations,
and Apprehensions, before his Departure with the Prince for the <HI>West.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>One Day He told him, He was very glad of what the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>
had done the Day before; and indeed He had done somewhat the Day
before, which very much surprized the Chancellor. When his Majesty
arose from Council, the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> whispered somewhat privately
to him, upon which the King went into his Bedchamber; and the Duke
called the Chancellor, and told him, the King would speak with him,
and so took him by the Hand, and led him into the Bedchamber; the Pri∣vilege,
and Dignity of which Room was then so punctually preserved, that
the King very rarely called any Privy Counsellor to confer with him there,
who was not of the Bedchamber; which maintained a just Reverence to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the Place, and an Esteem of those who were admitted to attend there.</P>
<P>As soon as He came into the Room,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor with the King's Appro∣bation, form, a Friendship with the Duke of</HI> Richmond.</NOTE> before He said any Thing to the
King, who was there alone, the Duke spake to the Chancellor, and told
him, that He had been brought up from his Childhood by the Crown, and
had always paid it the Obedience of a Child; that as He had taken a
Wife with the Approbation, and Advice of the Crown; so He had never
made a Friendship, which He took to be a Kind of Marriage, without the
King's Privity, and particular Approbation; that He had long had a Kind∣ness
for him, but had taken Time to know him well, which He thought
He now did; and therefore had asked his Majesty's Consent, that He
<MILESTONE N="40"/>might make a Friendship with him: and then said to the King, “Sir,
have I not your Approbation to this Conjunction?” to which his Ma∣jesty
said, “yes, my Lord, I am very glad of it; and I will pass my Word
to you for the Chancellor, that you will not repent it;” with many
gracious Expressions to them both: And so the Duke led him out of the
Room again, saying, now Mr. Chancellor it is in your Power to deceive
me. And to this it was, that his Majesty's Discourse related the next Day,
when He told him, He was glad of what had passed, &amp;c. and said, He
hoped He would give him good Counsel; for He had not of late lived to∣wards
him in the Manner he was used to do; that He knew well the Duke
<MILESTONE N="50"/>was a very honest, and worthy Man, and had all the Kindness, as well as
Duty for his Majesty; but that He was grown sullen, or discontented, and
had not the same Countenance He used to have; for which He could ima∣gine
no other Reason, but that his Man <HI>Webb</HI> gave him ill Counsel: He
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
said, He was well contented that He should take Notice, that his Majesty
was not well satisfied; and asked him suddenly, when the Duke was at
<HI>Oriel</HI> College with them; <HI>Oriel</HI> College was the Lodging of the Lord
Treasurer, where that Committee for secret Affairs, of which the Duke
was one, used to meet. The Chancellor answered, that indeed the Duke
had not been there lately, which he thought had proceeded from his At∣tendance
upon his Majesty, or some other necessary Divertisement. The
King said, it proceeded not from thence; and that He might take Occa∣sion
from his Absence from thence, to let himself into that Discourse; and
afterwards proceed as He thought fit.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Duke was a Person of a very good Understanding;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of the Duke of</HI> Richmond.</NOTE> and of so great
Perfection, and Punctuality in all Matters of Honesty, and Honour, that
He was infinitely superior to any kind of Temptation. He had all the
Warmth, and Passions of a Subject, and a Servant, and a Friend for the
King, and for his Person; but He was then a Man of a high Spirit; and
valued his very Fidelity at the Rate it was worth; and not the less, for
that it had almost stood single for some Time. The Chancellor was very
sorry for this Discovery; and chose to wait upon the Duke the same Day,
near the Hour when the Meeting used to be at <HI>Oriel</HI> College: And when
He had spent a short Time with him, He said, He thought it was Time<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to go to <HI>Oriel</HI> College, and asked his Grace, whether He would please to
go thither; for which He making some Excuse, the other pressed him
with some Earnestness, and said, it was observed that He had a good Time
declined that Meeting, and if He should not now go thither, He should
be doubtful there was some Reason for it.</P>
<P>THE Duke replied, that He had indeed been absent from thence for
some Time, and that He would deal clearly with him as his Friend, but
desired it should not be known; that He was resolved to be there no more.
Then complained, that the King was not kind to him; at least had not
that Confidence in him, which He had used to have: And then spake of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
many Particulars loosely; and especially, that before the Treaty, He had
advised the King to use all the Means He could to draw them to a Treaty,
for many Advantages which were like to be gotten by it; and to that Pur∣pose,
produced a Letter that He had newly received from the Countess of
<HI>Carlisle,</HI> and read it to his Majesty, who then seemed not to be moved
with the Contents; but afterwards in several Discourses reflected upon it
in such a Manner, as if He were jealous, that the Duke held too much
Correspondence with that People: Which He looked upon, as such a Point
of Diffidence, that it was no longer fit for him to be present, when the
secret Part of his Affairs was transacted; and so He had, and would for∣bear<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to meet in that Place, till his Majesty should entertain a better Opi∣nion
of him: yet He concealed the Trouble of Mind which He sustained;
and wished, that no Notice might be taken of it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to reconcile to the King;</NOTE> it was too late for that Caution; that the
Lords themselves could not but observe his long Absence, who before used
to be the most punctual; and confessed to him, that the King himself had
spoken to him of it with a Sense of Wonder, and Dislike; which, He said,
He was to blame himself for; since the Honour He had done him to the
King, had likewise disposed his Majesty to trust him so far, as to express
some Dissatisfaction He had in his Grace's late Carriage and Behaviour. The<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Duke seemed not displeased with the Communication, but thereupon en∣tered
into a fuller, and warmer Discourse than before; how much the King
had withdrawn his Confidence from him, and trusted others much more
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
than him. In Sum, it was easy to discern, that the Thing that troubled
him, was the Power and Credit that <HI>John Ashburnham</HI> had with the
King; which his Vanity made him own to that Degree, that He was not
content to enjoy the Benefit of it, except He made it publick, and to be
taken Notice of by all Men; which could not but reflect upon his Ho∣nour:
And when the Chancellor seemed to think it impossible, that him∣self
could believe, that the King could prefer a Man of Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI>'s
Talent, before his Grace; He proceeded with many Instances, and in∣sisted
with most Indignation upon one.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THAT about a Year before, Sir <HI>John Lucas,</HI> who was well known to his
Grace, having met him abroad in his Travels, and ever after paid a par∣ticular
Respect to him, had applied himself to him, and desired his Favour,
that when there should be any Opportunity offered, He would recommend
him to the King, to whom He was not unknown; that his Affection to
his Majesty's Service was notorious enough, and that his Sufferings were so
likewise; his House being the first that was plundered in the beginning of
the War; by which, the Loss He sustained in Furniture, Plate, Money,
and Stock, was very considerable; so that He might modestly hope, that
when his Majesty scattered his Favours upon others of his own Rank, his
<MILESTONE N="20"/>poor Service might likewise be remembered: But He had seen Men raised
to Dignities, who He was fure had not the Advantage over him in their
Sufferings, whatever They might have in their Actings; and He desired
no more, but (since it was too evident that his Majesty's Wants were
great, and that Money would do him some Service) that He might re∣ceive
that Degree of Honour which others had, and He would make
such a Present to him, as should manifest his Gratitude; and He desired
to owe the Obligation to his Grace, and to receive it only by his Me∣diation.</P>
<P>HE said, He had moved this Matter, with the Relation of all the Cir∣cumstances,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to his Majesty, who spake very graciously of the Gentleman,
as a Person of Merit, but said, He was resolved to make no more Lords;
which He received as a very good Answer, and looked upon as a good
Resolution, and commended it; desiring only, that if at any Time his
Majesty found it necessary to vary from that Resolution, He would re∣member
his Proposition, and gratify that Gentleman; which He promised
to do; and with all which He acquainted the Person concerned; think∣ing
it could not but well satisfy him. But He told him, that He was
sorry that He could not receive the Honour, by his Grace's Recommen∣dation;
but for the Thing it self, He could have it when He would; and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>shortly after it was dispatched by Mr. <HI>Ashburnham.</HI> He asked, whether
this was not preferring Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI> very much before him. The Chan∣cellor
told him, He was preferred as the better Market Man; and that He
ought not to believe, that the King's Affection swayed him to that Pre∣ference,
but an Opinion, that the other would make the better Bargain.
He replied, his Majesty was deceived in that, for He had told him what
the other meant to give, without the least Thought of reserving any Thing
for himself; whereas his Majesty had now received five hundred Pounds
less, and his Market Man had gotten so much for his Pains.</P>
<P>IN Conclusion, He prevailed so far with him, that They went that Af∣ternoon
<MILESTONE N="50"/>together to the Committee to <HI>Oriel</HI> College; and the next Day the
Chancellor spake with the King again, and told him, that the Duke had
been in the Afternoon with the Committee, where many Things had been
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
consulted;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And the King to the Duke of</HI> Richmond;</NOTE> and that He found, all his Trouble proceeded from an Appre∣hension,
that his Majesty had withdrawn his Affection from him; at least
that He, the Duke, had not the same Credit with his Majesty, which He
had formerly had; and that the Sense, and Fear of that, could not but
make an Impression upon a good Servant, who loved his Master as well as
He did. His Majesty said, They two should not live as well together, as
They had done, as long as the Duke kept his Man <HI>Webb;</HI> who made him
believe, that the King was wholly governed by <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> and cared
not for any Body else. He said, no Body who knew him, could believe
He could be governed by <HI>Ashburnbam;</HI> who, though an honest Man, and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
one that He believed loved him well, no Man thought was of an Under∣standing
superior to his Majesty; and enlarged himself upon this Argu∣ment
so much, that He seemed as it were glad of the Opportunity, to clear
himself from that Aspersion, or Imputation.</P>
<P>IT is a very great Misfortune for any Prince to be suspected to be go∣verned
by any Man; for as the Reproach is of all others the most grie∣vous,
so They think the trusting weak Men, who are much short of their
own Vigour of Wit, and Understanding, is a sufficient Vindication from
that Calumny; and so, before They are aware of it, They decline wiser
Men, who are fit to advise them, and give themselves to weaker, upon<MILESTONE N="20"/>
an Imagination, that no Body will ever suspect, They can be governed
by them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But without Success.</NOTE> In Fine, He found the Work too hard for him; the King being
so much incensed against <HI>Webb,</HI> that He expected the Duke should turn
him away: and the Duke himself, looked upon the King's Prejudice, as
infused into him by <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> upon particular Malice; having often
desired, that some Accuser might charge <HI>Webb,</HI> and He be heard to an∣swer
for himself; which the King not being willing to admit, the other was
unwilling to dismiss a Servant, his Secretary, who had served him long,
and was very useful to him; and who indeed was never suspected for any
Infidelity, or Want of Affection to his Master: and so the Chancellor, to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
his great Trouble, was not able to remove that Cloudiness that remained
in both their Countenances; which never produced the least ill Effect in
the View or Observation of any; the Duke's Duty being never in any
Degree diminished; and the King's Kindness to him continuing with
many gracious Evidences, to his Death.</P>
<P>THE last Conference his Majesty had with the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King's l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Conference with the Chancellor of the Exche∣quer.</NOTE> was the
very Day the Prince began his Journey towards the West, and indeed
after He had received his Blessing; when his Majesty sent for him into his
Bedchamber; and repeated some Things he had mentioned before. He
told him, “there had been many Things which had troubled him, with<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Reference to his Son's Absence from him; for all which, but one, He
had satisfied himself: the one was, the Inconvenience which might
arise from the Weakness and Folly of his Governor; against which He
had provided, as well as He could, by obliging the Prince to follow the
Advice of his Council in all Things; which He was well assured He
would do; and He had given them as much Authority, as They could
wish. Another was, that there was one Servant about the Prince, who
He thought, had too much Credit with him, which was <HI>Elliot;</HI> who
He did not intend should be with him in the Journey; and had there∣fore
sent him into <HI>France</HI> to the Queen, with Direction to her Majesty,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to keep him there; and if He should return whilst the Prince remained
in the West, that He should be sent to his Majesty; and not suffered to
stay with his Highness; and that was all the Care He could take in
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
those two Particulars: But there was a Third, in which He knew not
what to do, and that troubled him much more than the other two.”
When the Chancellor seemed full of Expectation to know what that might
be, the King said, “I have observed of late some kind of Sharpness, upon
many Occasions, between <HI>Colepepper</HI> and you; and though you are
joined with other honest Men, yet my great Confidence is upon you
two: I know not that the Fault is in you; nay, I must confess, that it
is very often in him; but let it be where it will, any Difference, and
Unkindness between you two, must be at my Charge; And I must tell
<MILESTONE N="10"/>you the Fear I have of it, gives me much Trouble: I have spoken very
plainly to him my Apprehension in this Point, within this Hour; and
He hath made as fair Promises to me as I can wish; and upon my Con∣science
I think, He loves you, though He may sometimes provoke you
to be angry.”</P>
<P>THE King here making a Pause, the Chancellor, out of Countenance,
said, “He was very sorry, that He had ever given his Majesty any Occa∣sion
for such an Apprehension; but very glad, that He had vouchsafed
to inform him of it; because He believed He should give his Majesty
such Assurance in that Particular, as would fully satisfy him: He assu∣red
<MILESTONE N="20"/>his Majesty, that He had a great Esteem of the Lord <HI>Colepepper;</HI>
and though He might have at some Times Passions which were incon∣venient,
He was so confident of himself, that they should not provoke,
or disturb him, that He was well content, that his Majesty should con∣demn,
and think him in the Fault, if any Thing should fall out, of Pre∣judice
to his Service, from a Difference between them two.” With which
his Majesty appeared abundantly satisfied, and pleased; and embracing
him, gave him his Hand to kiss; and He immediately went to Horse, and
followed the Prince: And this was the last Time the Chancellor ever saw
that gracious and excellent King.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>IT was upon the 4th of <HI>March,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor attends the Prince into the West; and is there first assaulted by the Gout.</NOTE> in the Year 1644, that the Prince
parted from the King his Father. He lodged that Night at <HI>Farringdon;</HI>
having made his Journey thither, in one continued Storm of Rain, from
the Minute He left <HI>Oxford:</HI> And from thence went the next Day, to the
Garrison of the <HI>Devizes;</HI> and the third to the City of <HI>Bath;</HI> which being

two or three Days. And in this Journey the Chancellor was first assaulted
with the Gout; having never had the least Apprehension of it before; but
from his coming to <HI>Bath,</HI> He was not able to stand; and so went by Coach
to <HI>Bristol;</HI> where in few Days He recovered that first Lameness; which
<MILESTONE N="40"/>ever after afflicted him too often. And so the Year 1644 ended, which

in the Island of <HI>Scilly:</HI> From whence the next Day, the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI>
was dispatched with Letters, to the Queen to <HI>Paris,</HI> to give Notice of his
Highness's being in that Island; and to desire Money, Arms, and Am∣munition
for the Defence thereof: And at the same Time another Vessel
was sent into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to give the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> likewise Information
of it; and to desire that two Companies of Foot might be sent thither, to
encrease that Garrison; and to defend it in case the Enemy should attack
it—His Highness's Stay in <HI>Scilly,</HI> near six Weeks; until the Lords <HI>Capel,</HI>
and <HI>Hopton</HI> came thither; after They had made Conditions for the dis∣banding
<MILESTONE N="10"/>their Troops, with <HI>Fairfax;</HI> which <HI>Goring's</HI> Troops made it ne∣cessary
to do: They not only refusing to obey all Orders, but mingling
every Day with the Troops of the Enemy; and remaining quietly together
in the same Quarters, drinking and making merry with each other—
The Report of a Fleet designed from the Parliament for <HI>Scilly,</HI> and those
Lords viewing the <HI>Island,</HI> and not looking upon it as tenable, caused a new
Consultation to be held, whether it were fit for his Highness to remain
there, till the Return of the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> or to remove sooner; and
whither He should remove; the Frigate which brought the Prince from
<HI>Pendennis</HI> being still kept in a Readiness at <HI>Scilly,</HI> upon the Foresight that
<MILESTONE N="20"/>his Remove might come to be necessary—That upon this Consultation
it was resolved, that it would not be safe for his Highness to remain there;
but that He should transport himself from thence, into the Island of <HI>Jer∣sey;</HI>
which was done accordingly—And his Highness's Arrival there
about the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> 1645—The Prince's Reception in <HI>Jer∣sey,</HI>

till the Return of the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> His going to <HI>Paris</HI> to persuade
the Queen, and to protest against the Prince's going for <HI>France;</HI> against
which He inveighed with more Passion than any Man—The Arrival
of Mr. <HI>Thomas Jermyn</HI> from <HI>Paris,</HI> with very positive Orders for the
Prince's Repair thither, from the Queen—And shortly after, the Lord
<HI>Colepepper</HI>'s Arrival, who had been dispatched from her Majesty to re∣turn
to <HI>Scilly,</HI> before She knew of his Highness's Remove from thence;
which Advertisement overtook the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> at <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI>
after He was embarked; and so He bent his Course thither, and had the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>same Orders for the Prince his going to <HI>Paris,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Jermyn</HI> had like∣wise
brought.</P>
<P>THERE was none of the Council inclined that his Highness, being in
a Place of unquestionable Safety, should suddenly depart from thence; till
the State and Condition in which his Majesty was, and his Pleasure, might
be known: It was then understood, that his Majesty had left <HI>Oxford,</HI> and
was with the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army before <HI>Newark;</HI> which He had caused to be
rendered, that the Army might retire; which it presently did, and the
King in it, to <HI>Newcastle:</HI> The Prince was yet in his Fathers Dominions;
some Places in <HI>England</HI> still holding out, as <HI>Oxford, Worcester, Pendennis,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and other Places; that it would be easy, in a short Time, to understand
the King's Pleasure; and that there could be no Inconvenience in expect∣ing
it; the Prince's Person being in no possible Danger: But that the
Mischief might be very great, if without the King's Direction it were
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
done; whether his Majesty should be well or ill treated by the <HI>Scots;</HI> and
that the Parliament might make it a new Matter of Reproach against the
King, that He had sent the Heir Apparent of the Crown out of the King∣dom;
which could be no otherwise excused, at least by those who at∣tended
him, than by evident and apparent Necessity: Those Reasons ap∣peared
of so much Weight to the Prince himself (who had not a natural
Inclination to go into <HI>France</HI>) and to all the Council; that the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> were desired to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> to satisfy the Queen,
why the Prince had deferred yielding a present Obedience to her Com∣mand.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Treatment They received at <HI>Paris;</HI> and their Return again to

Persons of Quality: The Lord <HI>Digby</HI> being to return to <HI>Ireland,</HI> with
eight thousand Pistoles; which the Cardinal sent towards the Supply of the
King's Service there; and being by it, and the Cardinal, so throughly con∣vinced
of the Necessity of the Prince's going for <HI>France,</HI> that He was
more positive for it, than any of the Rest; and had promised the Queen,
that He would convert the Chancellor, and make him consent to it; with
whom He had a great Friendship—The Debate at <HI>Jersey</HI> upon their
coming back—The Lord <HI>Capel</HI> adhering to his former Opinion, that<MILESTONE N="20"/>
we might first know the King's Opinion; towards the receiving of which,
He had offered the Queen, and now offered again, to go himself to <HI>New∣castle,</HI>
where the King still was; no Body knowing what would be the Is∣sue
of the Controversy between the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Parliament; and if
the King should direct it, every Man would willingly attend his Highness;
and punctually observe whatsoever the King commanded: And because
the Objection might be removed, of his being taken Prisoner, by the Par∣liament,
or his being not suffered by the <HI>Scots</HI> to speak with the King;
He did offer, and all who were of his Opinion consented to it, that if He
did not return to <HI>Jersey,</HI> within one Month, the Prince should pursue the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Queen's Orders; and every Man would attend his Highness into <HI>France;</HI>
and a Month's Delay could be of no ill Consequence—The Prince's Re∣solution
to go presently for <HI>Paris;</HI>—and the Reasons which moved the
Lords <HI>Capel,</HI> and <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Chancellor, to excuse themselves—
and his Highness's Permission to remain in <HI>Jersey,</HI> from whence They
would attend his Commands, when He had any Service for them—
And the sudden Reservedness, and Strangeness that grew between those,
who advised the going, and those who were for staying—and the Prince's
embarking himself for <HI>France,</HI> about <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1646—</P>

<HEAD>PART the FIFTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prince having left <HI>Jersey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor of the Ex∣chequer's Re∣sidence at <HI>Jersey.</HI></NOTE> about <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1646; the
Chancellor of the Exchequer remained there about two Years
after; where He presently betook himself to his Study; and en∣joyed
(as He was wont to say) the greatest Tranquillity of Mind imaginable.
Whilst the Lords <HI>Capel,</HI> and <HI>Hopton</HI> staid there, They lived, and kept
House together in St. <HI>Hillary</HI>'s; which is the chief Town of the Island;
where having a Chaplain of their own, They had Prayers every Day in the
Church, at Eleven of the Clock in the Morning; till which Hour
They enjoyed themselves in their Chambers, according as They thought
<MILESTONE N="10"/>fit; the Chancellor betaking himself to the Continuance of the History,
which He had begun at <HI>Scilly,</HI> and spending most of his Time at that Exer∣cise.
The other two walked, or rode abroad, or read, as They were dis∣posed;
but at the Hour of Prayers They always met; and then dined to∣gether
at the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Lodging, which was the best House; They
being lodged at several Houses, with Convenience enough. Their Table
was maintained at their joint Expense, only for Dinners; They never using
to sup; but met always upon the Sands in the Evening to walk, often
going to the Castle to Sir <HI>George Carteret;</HI> who treated them with ex∣traordinary
Kindness and Civility, and spent much Time with them;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and in Truth, the whole Island shewed great Affection to them, and
all the Persons of Quality invited them to their Houses, to very good
Entertainments; and all other Ways expressed great Esteem towards
them.</P>
<P>AND from hence They writ a joint Letter to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes from thence to the King.</NOTE> which they
sent to him by Mr. <HI>Fanshaw;</HI> in which They made great Profession of
their Duty to his Majesty, and their Readiness to proceed in his Service;
and to wait upon the Prince upon the first Occasion; with such Reasons
for their not attending him into <HI>France,</HI> as They thought could not but
be satisfactory to his Majesty; declaring, that They had only desired that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>He would stay so long in a Place of his own, of unquestionable Security,
as that They might receive the Signification of his Majesty's Pleasure for his
Remove; upon which They were all resolved to have waited upon him:
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
Though it was evident enough to them, that their Advice would be no
longer hearkened unto, after his Highness should arrive with the Queen.</P>
<P>IN <HI>England,</HI> Men's Hopes, and Fears, were raised according to their
Tempers; for there was Argument for both Affections in the Trans∣actions,
and Occurrences of every Day; it being no easy Matter, to make
a Judgment which Party would prevail; nor what They would do, if
They did. The Lord <HI>Capel</HI> received Advice from his Friends in <HI>England,</HI>
to remove from <HI>Jersey</HI> into some Part of the <HI>United Provinces:</HI> That so
being in a Place to which there could be no Prejudice, his Friends might
the more hopefully solicit for Liberty for him to return into his own Coun∣try,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and that He might live in his own House; which They had Reason
to hope, would not be denied to a Person, who had many Friends, and
could not be conceived to have any Enemies; his Person being worthily
esteemed by all. Whereupon with the full Concurrence, and Advice of
his two Friends from whom He had great Tenderness to part; and with
whom He renewed his Contract of Friendship at parting, in a particular
Manner, upon Foresight of what might happen; He went from thence,
and first waited upon the Prince at <HI>Paris,</HI> that He might have his Royal
Highness's Approbation, for his Return into <HI>England,</HI> if He might do it
upon honourable Conditions: And from thence, with all possible Demon∣stration<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of Grace from the Prince, He transported himself to <HI>Middleburgh</HI>
in <HI>Zealand;</HI> where He remained till his Friends procured Liberty for him
to return, and remain at his own House. The worthy and noble Things
He did after, deserve to be transmitted to Posterity, in some more illus∣trious
Testimony, that may be worthy to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel</HI> thus leaving <HI>Jersey,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> and the Chan∣cellor
remained still there, in the same Conjunction, until, some few Months
after, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> received the News of the Death of his Wife; and
of the Arrival in <HI>France</HI> of his Unkle, Sir <HI>Arthur Hopton;</HI> who having
been Ambassador from the King in <HI>Spain,</HI> had left that Court, and re∣tired<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to <HI>Paris;</HI> from whence He shortly after removed to <HI>Roüen,</HI> with a
Purpose, as soon as He had at large conferred with his Nephew, to go
into <HI>England,</HI> for the Good and Benefit of both their Fortunes: and upon
this Occasion, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> likewise left <HI>Jersey,</HI> with all possible Pro∣fession
of an entire Friendship to the Chancellor, which was never violated
in the least Degree to his Death. And the Chancellor being thus left alone,
He was with great Civility,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And removes to Sir</HI> George Carteret'<HI>s</HI></NOTE> and Friendship invited by Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI>
to remove from the Town (where He had lived with his Friends till then)
and to live with him in the Castle <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> whither He went, the next
Day after the Departure of the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and remained there to his<MILESTONE N="40"/>
wonderful Contentment, in the very chearful Society of Sir <HI>George Carte∣ret,</HI>
and his Lady; in whose House He received all the Liberty, and En∣tertainment
He could have expected in his own Family; of which He al∣ways
retained so just a Memory, that there was never any Intermission, or
Decay of that Friendship He then made: And He remained there, till He
was sent for again to attend the Prince, which will be mentioned in it's
Time.</P>
<P>HE built a Lodging in the Castle, of two or three convenient Rooms,
to the Wall of the Church; which Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> had repaired, and
beautified; and over the Door of his Lodging He set up his Arms, with<MILESTONE N="50"/>
this Inscription, <HI>Bene Vixit, qui bene Latuit:</HI> And he always took Plea∣sure
in relating, with what great Tranquillity of Spirit (though deprived of
the Joy He took in his Wife, and Children) He spent his Time here,
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
amongst his Books (which He got from <HI>Paris</HI>) and his Papers; between
which He seldom spent less than ten Hours in the Day;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He writes the History of the Troubles.</NOTE> and it can hardly
be believed how much He read, and writ there; insomuch as He did
usually compute, that during his whole Stay in <HI>Jersey,</HI> which was some
Months above two Years, He writ daily little less than one Sheet of large
Paper, with his own Hand; most of which are still to be seen amongst his
Papers.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> his Majesty writ to the Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer
with his own Hand; in which He took Notice that He was
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Writing the <HI>History of the late Troubles,</HI> for which He thanked him, say∣ing,
that He knew no Man could do it so well; and that He would not
do it the worse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Towards which the King furnishes him with the Passages of the Years 1645, and 1646.</NOTE> by the Helps that He would very speedily send him (as
his Majesty shortly after did, in two Manuscripts very fairly written; con∣taining
all Matters of Importance, that had passed from the Time that the
Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> went from his Majesty into the West, to the very Time
that his Majesty himself went from <HI>Oxford,</HI> to the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army; which
were all the Passages in the Years 1645, and 1646) He used many gra∣cious
Expressions in that Letter to him; and said, He looked upon him
as one of those, who had served him with most Fidelity, and therefore He
<MILESTONE N="20"/>might be confident of his Kindness; and that He would bring him to him
with the first; though He said, He did not hold him to be Infallible, as
He might discern by what He had commanded Dr. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> who was then
Clerk of his Closet, to write to him; and at the same Time the Doctor
writ him Word, that the King was sorry that He, the Chancellor,
staid at <HI>Jersey,</HI> and did not attend the Prince into <HI>France;</HI> and that if He
had been there, He would have been able to have prevented the Vexation
his Majesty had endured at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> by Messages from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctor likewise sent him Word, that great Pains had been taken
from <HI>Paris,</HI> to incense the King against him; but that it had so little
<MILESTONE N="30"/>prevailed, that his Majesty had with some Sharpness reprehended those, who
blamed him, and had justified the Chancellor. He made haste to answer
his Majesty's Letter, and gave him so much Satisfaction, that his Majesty
said, He was too hard for him. And about the same time the Lord <HI>Capel</HI>
came into <HI>England;</HI> and though He was under Security to the Parliament
for behaving himself peaceably, He was not restrained from seeing the
King; and so gave him a very particular Information of all that had passed
at <HI>Jersey;</HI> and many other Things, of which his Majesty had never been
informed before; which put it out of any Body's Power to make any ill
Impressions in him towards the Chancellor.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>UPON the King's refusing to give his Assent to the four Acts, sent
to him from the Parliament, when He was in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> They
voted, <HI>that no more Addresses should be made to the King;</HI> and published
a Declaration to that Effect, which contained severe Charges against his
Majesty. <HI>Vid. Hist. Reb.</HI> Fol. Vol. 3. P. 67, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer no sooner received a Copy of it in
<HI>Jersey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancel∣lor of the Ex∣chequer writes and publishes an Answer to the Parlia∣ment's Decla∣ration of the 15th of</HI> Feb. 1647.</NOTE> than He prepared a very large and full Answer to it; in which
He made the Malice, and the Treason of that libellous Declaration to ap∣pear;
and his Majesty's Innocence in all the Particulars charged upon him,
with such pathetical Applications, and Insinuations, as were most like to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>work upon the Affections of the People: All which was transmitted (by
the Care of Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who resided at <HI>Caen</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI>
and held a constant Correspondence with the Chancellor) to a trusty
Hand in <HI>London;</HI> who caused it to be well printed, and divulged, and
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
found Means to send it to the King: Who, after He had read it, said He
durst swear it was writ by the Chancellor, if it were not that there was
more Divinity in it, than He expected from him, which made him believe
He had conferred with Dr. <HI>Steward.</HI> But some Months after, being in∣formed
by Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> He sent the Chancellor Thanks for it; and
expressed upon all Occasions, that He was much pleased with that Vindi∣cation.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel</HI> had written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
who remained still in <HI>Jersey,</HI> signifying the King's Commands, that as
soon as the Chancellor should be required to wait upon the Prince,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He should without Delay obey the Summons. The King had writ to
the Queen, that when it should he necessary for the Prince to remove
out of <HI>France,</HI> the Chancellor should have Notice of it, and be re∣quired
to attend him. About the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year 1648,
the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> writ again to the Chancellor, giving him Notice, that
He would probably be sent for soon, and desiring him to be ready.
About the middle of <HI>May,</HI> the Queen sent to the Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer
to <HI>Jersey,</HI> commanding, that He would wait upon the Prince
at <HI>Paris,</HI> upon a Day that was past before the Letter came to his Hands;
but as soon as He received the Summons, He immediately transported<MILESTONE N="20"/>
himself into <HI>Normandy,</HI> and went to <HI>Caen;</HI> from thence He hastened
to <HI>Roüen,</HI> where He found the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and
Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who had received the same Commands. They were
informed that the Prince was passed by towards <HI>Calais,</HI> and Direction
was sent, that the Chancellor, and the rest should stay at <HI>Roüen,</HI> till
They should receive new Orders from <HI>Calais.</HI> Within few Days They
received Advice, that the Prince had put himself on board a Ship that
He found at <HI>Calais</HI> bound for <HI>Holland,</HI> where They were to hear from
him; whereupon They removed from <HI>Roüen</HI> to <HI>Dieppe;</HI> from whence
They might embark for <HI>Holland</HI> when required. <HI>Vid. Hist. Reb.</HI> Fol.<MILESTONE N="30"/>

<P>AFTER the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer had staid at <HI>Dieppe</HI> some Days, and were confirmed by
Reports every Day, that the Prince was in <HI>Holland;</HI> and that the Fleet
wanted some Provisions, without which it could not put out to Sea;
They resolved to make Use of the first Vessel, of which there were many
then in the Harbour, that should be bound for <HI>Holland;</HI> and to transport
themselves thither; and there was one which within two, or three Days
would set out for <HI>Flushing.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> had no Mind to venture
himself in such a Vessel, and since the Fleet that had declared for the King<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was then in <HI>Holland,</HI> He apprehended that the Parliament might have
other Vessels abroad, that might easily seize upon that small Bark; and
so after some Debate with the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> (They two being seldom of
one Mind) the Earl resolved to return to his old Habitation at <HI>Caen,</HI> and
expect another Occasion.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, who knew nothing of the Sea, nor understood the
Hazards thereof (being always so afflicted upon that Element with Sick∣ness,
that He considered nothing about it; and holding himself obliged
to make what Haste he could to the Prince) committed himself entirely to
the Lord <HI>Cottington:</HI> And when They resolved to embark themselves in<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Vessel bound for <HI>Flushing,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, which was called
the King's Ship, came into the Road of <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and offered to carry them
the next Day to <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> which They took to be the safer Passage: And
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
so giving the Captain as much Money as He demanded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exche∣quer embark, for</HI> Dunkirk.</NOTE> They put them∣selves
upon his miserable Frigate; where They had no Accommodations,
but the open Deck; and were safely set on Shore <HI>at Dunkirk;</HI> where
Marshal <HI>Rantzaw</HI> was then Governor. And They no sooner landed in the
Evening, but <HI>Carteret,</HI> a Servant of the Prince's, came to them, and in∣formed
them, that the Prince was entered the River of <HI>Thames</HI> with the
Fleet; and that He was sent by his Highness to the Marshal for a Fri∣gate,
which he had offered to lend the Prince: and that He had delivered
the Letter, and the Marshal (who had been out all, the Night before upon a
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Design upon the Enemy; and was newly arrived, and gone to Bed) had
promised him that the Frigate should be ready the next Day. This seemed
an extraordinary good Fortune to them, that They might now embark di∣rectly
for the Fleet, without going into <HI>Holland,</HI> which They were willing
to avoid; and so resolved to speak with the Marshal as soon as They could,
that They might be confirmed by him, that his Frigate should be ready
the next Day; and thereupon sent a Servant to wait at the Marshal's
Lodging, that They might know when He waked, and was to be spoken
with.</P>
<P>THE Marshal had Notice of their Arrival before the Servant came to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>him, and of their Desire to go to the Prince; and sent one of his Officers
to welcome them to the Town, and to see them well accommodated with
Lodging; and to excuse him, that He did not wait upon them that
Night, by Reason of the Fatigue He had undergone the Night before, and
that Day; and to oblige them to dine with him the next Day, against
which Time the Vessel would be made ready to receive them, and trans∣port
them to the Prince's Fleet; with which They were abundantly sa∣tisfied;
and betook themselves to their Rest for that Night: And were
early up the next Morning to see the Marshal; but it was late before
he rose.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>HE received them with great Civility, being a very proper Man, of a
most extraordinary Presence, and Aspect, and might well be reckoned a
very handsome Man, though He had but one Leg, one Hand, one Eye,
and one Ear, the other being cut off with that Side of his Face; besides
many other Cuts on the other Cheek, and upon his Head, with many
Wounds in the Body; notwithstanding all which, He stood very upright,
and had a very graceful Motion, a clear Voice, and a charming Delivery;
and if He had not, according to the Custom of his Nation (for He was a
<HI>German</HI>) too much indulged to the Excess of Wine, He had been one of
the most excellent Captains of that Age. He professed great Affection to
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the Prince, and much commended the Frigate He intended to send to
him; which, for the swiftness of it was called the <HI>Hare;</HI> and out sailed,
as He said, all the Vessels of that Coast; and after He had treated them
with a very excellent, and a jovial Dinner, about Four of the Clock in the
Afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thence for the Prince's Fleet.</NOTE> He brought them to their Boat, that put them on board their
Frigate; which was but a small Vessel of twenty Guns, much inferior to
what They expected, by the Description the Marshal had made of it.
However, it was very proper for the Use They were to make of it, to be
delivered at the Fleet; and so, the Moon shining very fair, They weighed
Anchor about Sun set, with a very small Gale of Wind.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>THE Prince being Master at Sea, They had no manner of Apprehen∣sion
of an Enemy; not knowing, or considering, that They were very
near <HI>Ostend,</HI> and so, in Respect of the Vessel They were in, liable to be
made a Prize by those Men of War; as it fell out: For about Break of
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
Day, in a dead Calm, They found themselves pursued by six, or seven
Ships, which, as They drew nearer, were known by the Seamen to be the
Frigates of <HI>Ostend.</HI> There was no Hope to Escape by the Swiftness of the
Vessel, for there was not the least Breath of Wind; and it was to no Pur∣pose
to resist; for besides that the Vessel was not half manned, four, or
five of the Pursuers were stronger Ships; so that it was thought best to
let the Sails fall, that They might see there was no Purpose of Resistance;
and to send <HI>Carteret</HI> in the Boat, to inform the Ships who the Persons
were, that were on Board, and that They had a Pass from the Arch∣Duke;
for an authentick Copy of a Pass the Arch-Duke had sent to the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Prince, had been sent to them. All the Ships, though They had the King
of <HI>Spain's</HI> Commission, were Freebooters, belonging to private Owners,
who observed no Rules, or Laws of Nations; but They boarded the Ves∣sel,
with their Swords drawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>But is taken by some Fri∣gates of</HI> Ollend;</NOTE> and Pistols cocked, and without any Dis∣tinction,
plundered all the Passengers with equal Rudeness; save that They
stripped some of the Servants to their very Shirts; They used not the rest
with that Barbarity, being satisfied with taking all They had in their
Pockets, and carefully examined all their <HI>Valises,</HI> and Trunks, in which
They found good Booty.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> lost in Money, and Jewels, above one thousand<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Pounds; the Chancellor in Money, about two hundred Pounds, and all
his Cloaths and Linen; and Sir <HI>George Ratcliffe,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wansford,</HI> who
were in the Company, above five hundred Pounds in Money, and Jewels.
And having pillaged them in this Manner, They carried them all, with the
Frigate They had been in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and carried to that Port.</NOTE> Prisoners to <HI>Ostend;</HI> where They arrived about
Two of the Clock in the Afternoon; all the Men and Women of the Town
being gathered together to behold the Prize that was brought in within so
few Hours; for Intelligence had been sent from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the Night be∣fore
(according to the Custom, and good Intelligence observed in those
Places) of the going out of this Vessel, which had such Persons on Board.<MILESTONE N="30"/>
When They were on Shore, They were carried, through all the Specta∣tors
to a common Inn; from whence They sent to the Magistrates, to in∣form
them of what Condition They were; and of the Injuries They had
received, by having been treated as Enemies; and demanded Restitution
of Ship, and Goods.</P>
<P>THE Magistrates, who were called the Lords of the Admiralty, came
presently to them, and when They were fully informed of the whole Mat∣ter,
and had seen the Arch-Duke's Pass, They seemed very much trou∣bled;
and with much Civility assured them, that They should not only
receive all that had been taken from them; but that the Men should be<MILESTONE N="40"/>
severely punished for their Transgression.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is set at Liberty; and promised Sa∣tisfaction.</NOTE> They immediately discharged
those Guards that kept them as Prisoners; and provided the best Lodgings
in the Town for them: And because it was growing towards the Evening,
and the Frigates were not yet come in, They excused themselves that
They could do no more that Night; but promised to go themselves on
board the Ships the next Morning early; and desired that some of the
Gentlemen of their Company might go with them, to the End that They
might discover at least some of those, who had been most rude towards
them; who should be sure to be imprisoned till full Satisfaction were made
by the rest.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>As soon as the Lords of the Admiralty were gone, the Governor, an
old <HI>Spaniard,</HI> came to visit them with all Professions of Civility, and Ser∣vice;
and seemed to abhor the Barbarity with which They had been treat∣ed;
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
asked very particularly of the Manner, of them, and of every Particu∣lar
that had been taken from them; and told them, They should be sure
to have it all returned; for that They did not trouble themselves in such
Cases to find out the Seamen, who were the Plunderers, but resorted al∣ways
to the Owners of the Ships, who lived in the Town, and were sub∣stantial
Men, and bound to answer and satisfy for all Misdemeanours com∣mitted
by the Company; and said, He would be with them the next Day,
and take Care that all should be done that was Just. These Professions and
Assurances made them believe, that They should receive full Reparation
<MILESTONE N="10"/>for the Damages They had received; and the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> began to
commend the good Order and Discipline that was observed under the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Government, much different from that in other Places; and in
how much better Condition They were, after such Usage, to be brought
into <HI>Ostend,</HI> than if They had been so used by the <HI>French,</HI> and carried
into any of their Ports.</P>
<P>THE next Morning two of the Lords of the Admiralty called upon
them, in their Way to the Ships; retaining the same Professions They had
made the Night before; and Sir <HI>George Ratcliffe,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wansford,</HI> and some
of their Servants accompanied them according to their Desire; and as soon
<MILESTONE N="20"/>as They were on Board the Admiral's Vessel, that had brought them in,
and had taken them out of their own, They knew some of those Seamen,
who had been most busy about them; which were immediately seized on,
and searched, and about some of them some Pieces of Chains of Gold, and
other Things of Value belonging to the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> were found; and
some Mails, in which were Linen, and Cloaths, all which were presently
restored and delivered to some of the Servants, who were present, and
brought them to their Masters. The Chancellor was more solicitous for
some Papers He had lost, than for his Money; and He was used to say,
that He looked upon it as a singular Act of Providence, that those Officers
<MILESTONE N="30"/>prevailed with a Seaman, who had taken it out of his Pocket, to restore
a little Letter which He had lately received from the King, whilst He
was in the Hands of the Army; which for the Grace and Kindness con∣tained
in it, He did ever exceedingly value.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Admiralty, though They had not yet found out either
any of the Jewels, or Money, of which They had been robbed, thought
They had done enough for the Morning; and so returned to Dinner; de∣claring
that They would return in the Afternoon; and directed the Ships
to be drawn nearer together, to the End They might visit them together;
and They did return in the Afternoon, accompanied as before, but their
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Reception by the Seamen was not as in the Morning. The Captains an∣swered
those Questions which were asked of them negligently, and scorn∣fully;
and those Seamen who had been searched in the Morning, and were
appointed to be produced in the Afternoon to be further examined, could
not be found; and instead of bringing the Ships nearer together, some of
them were gone more out to Sea; and the rest declared, that They would
go all out to Sea that Night; and when the Magistrates seemed to threaten
them, They swore They would throw both them, and all who came with
them, over Board; and offered to lay Hands upon them in Order to it;
so that They were all glad to get off; and returned to the Town, talking
<MILESTONE N="50"/>loud what Vengeance They would take upon the Captains and Seamen
when They returned again into Port (for They already stood out to Sea in
their Sight) and in the mean Time They would prosecute the Owners of
the Vessels, who should satisfy for the Damage received; but from this
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>
Time, the Governor, nor the Lords of Admiralty cared to come near
them: And They quickly found that the Reason of all the Governor's Ci∣vility
the first Night, and the many Questions He had asked concerning all
the Particulars They had lost of any Kind, was only to be the better in∣formed,
to demand his Share from the Seamen; and that the Lords of the
Admiralty were the Owners of the several Vessels, or had Shares in them,
and in the victualling, and so were to divide the Spoil, which They pre∣tended
should be restored. So that after They had remained there four, or
five Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But cannot obtain it.</NOTE> They were contented to receive one hundred Pistoles for dis∣charging
the Debts They had contracted in the Town (for there was not<MILESTONE N="10"/>
any Money left amongst them) and to carry them to the Prince; which
those of the Admiralty pretended to have received from some of the
Owners, and to wait for farther Justice, when the Ships should return,
which They doubted not should be effectually called for, by the Com∣mands
of the Arch-Duke, when He should be informed: and so They
prosecuted their Journey to the Prince, making their Way by <HI>Bruges,</HI> and
from thence by the Way of <HI>Sluys</HI> to <HI>Flushing;</HI> and those hundred Pistoles
were the only Recompence that They ever received for that Affront, and
Damage They had sustained; which in the whole amounted to two thou∣sand
Pounds at the least; though the King's Resident <HI>De-Vic</HI> at <HI>Brussels</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
prosecuted the Pretence with the Arch-Duke, as long as there was any
Hope.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was often used to relate an Observation that was ge∣nerally
made, and discoursed at <HI>Ostend,</HI> at that Time, that never any Man
who adventured in setting out those Frigates of Rapine, which are called
Men of War, or in victualling, or bearing any Share in them, died rich,
or possessed of any valuable Estate: and that as He walked one Morning
about the Town, and upon the Quay, with an <HI>English</HI> Officer, who was a
Lieutenant in that Garrison, They saw a poor old Man walk by them,
whom the Lieutenant desired the Chancellor to observe; and when He<MILESTONE N="30"/>
was passed by, He told him, that He had known that Man the richest of
any Man in the Town; that He had been the Owner of above ten Ships
of War at one Time, without any Partner or Sharer with him; that He
had had in his Warehouses in the Town, as much Goods, and Merchan∣dise
together, as amounted to the Value of one hundred thousand Pounds,
within seven Years before the Time He was then speaking; and after the
Loss of two or three Frigates, He insensibly decayed so fast, that having
begun to build another Frigate, which He shewed him as They walked,
and which lay then not half finished, He was not able to go through with
it, and that He was at that Time so poor, that He had not wherewith to<MILESTONE N="40"/>
maintain him; but received the Charity of those who had known him in
a plentiful Estate: And this Relation He made in Confirmation of that
Discourse and Observation; and it made so deep an Impression upon the
Chancellor, that afterwards, when the War was between <HI>England,</HI> and
<HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and when many Gentlemen thought it good Hus∣bandry
to adventure in the setting out such Ships of War, He always dis∣swaded
his Friends from that Traffick, relating to them this Story, of the
Truth whereof He had such Evidence; and did in Truth, moreover in his
own Judgment believe, that all Engagements of that Kind were contrary
to the Rules of Justice, and a good Conscience.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>WHEN They came to <HI>Flushing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes to</HI> Flushing▪</NOTE> They thought it best to stay there, as
the most likely Place to have Commerce with the Fleet; and They found
there Colonel <HI>William Vavasour,</HI> who had by the Prince's Commission,
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
drawn some Companies of Foot together, and expected some Vessel to be
sent from the Fleet, for their transportation; and <HI>Carteret</HI> was already dis∣patched,
to inform the Prince of what had befallen the Treasurer, and
Chancellor, and that They waited his Commands at <HI>Flushing:</HI> And be∣cause
<HI>Middleburgh</HI> would be as convenient to receive Intelligence, and
more convenient for their Accommodation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>from thence to</HI> Middle∣burgh;</NOTE> They removed thither, and
took a private Lodging; where, by having a Cook, and other Servants,
They might make their own Provisions. They had been at <HI>Middleburgh</HI>
very few Days, before the <HI>Hind</HI> Frigate was sent by the Prince to bring
<MILESTONE N="10"/>them to the Fleet; with Direction that They should make as much Haste
as was possible; and They had no Occasion to delay, but the Wind was
so directly against them for two or three Days, that They could not put
themselves on Board.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Embark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to attend the Prince in the River of</HI> Thames, <HI>but is driven <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack.</HI></NOTE> It was now about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> when the
Wind appeared fair, and They presently embarked, and weighed Anchor,
and sailed all the Night; but in the Morning the Wind changed, and blew
so hard a Gale, that They were compelled to turn about, and came before
Night again to <HI>Flushing;</HI> whence They endeavoured three Times more to
get into the Downs; from whence They might easily have got to the
Fleet; but as often as They put to Sea, so often They were driven back;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and once with so violent a Storm, that their Ship was in Danger; and was
driven in under the <HI>Ramekins,</HI> a Fort near the Mouth of the River that
goes to <HI>Middleburgh;</HI> whither They again repaired: And the Winds were
so long contrary, that They received Order from the Prince to repair into
<HI>Holland;</HI> for that his Highness resolved within very few Days, it being
now towards the End of <HI>August,</HI> to carry the Fleet thither; as He shortly
after did. And by this Means the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor
were not able to attend the Prince whilst He remained with the Fleet with∣in
the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> but were well informed, when They came to
him, of all that had passed there.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as soon
as They received Advertisement at <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> that the Prince resolved
to return with the Fleet into <HI>Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> made all the haste They could to
the <HI>Hague;</HI> it being then about the end of <HI>August,</HI> and came thither
within one Day after the Prince's Arrival there.</P>
<P>THE next Morning after the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Prince appointed his Council
to meet together, to receive, and deliberate upon a Message, the Lord
<HI>Lautherdale</HI> had brought from the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> earnestly
pressing him to repair forthwith to their Army; which was already en∣tered

<P>THE Factions in the Prince's Family, and the great Animosity which
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had against the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> infinitely disturbed the
Counsels; and perplexed the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of

Friends could restrain; and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> though very well inclined to

<P>WHILST the Prince was at the <HI>Hague,</HI> He received the shocking
account of the Murder of the King his Father; and soon after, the
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
Queen wrote to him from <HI>Paris,</HI> advising him to repair into <HI>France,</HI> as
soon as possible; and desiring him not to swear any Persons to be of
his Council, till She could speak with him: But before He received her
Letter, He had already caused those of his Father's Council, who had
attended him, to be sworn of his Privy Council; adding only Mr. <HI>Long</HI>
his Secretary. He had no Mind to go into <HI>France;</HI> and it was evident
that He could not be long able to reside at the <HI>Hague;</HI> an Agent from
the Parliament being there at that very Time; so that it was Time to
think of some other Retreat. <HI>Ireland</HI> was then thought most adviseable;
some favourable Accounts having been received from thence, of the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Transactions of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and Lord <HI>Inchiquin;</HI> and of
the Arrival of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at <HI>Kinsale</HI> with the Fleet. <HI>Hist. of the Reb.</HI>

<P>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer was sent to confer with the Mar∣quis
of <HI>Montrose</HI> in a Village near the <HI>Hague,</HI> upon the State of Af∣fairs

<P>THE King declared his Resolution of going into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Pre∣parations<MILESTONE N="20"/>
were made for that Expedition; which however, from Acci∣dents
that afterwards fell out, did not take Effect. The Lord <HI>Cotting∣ton,</HI>
wishing to avoid the Fatigue of such Expeditions, took that Occa∣sion
to confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, upon the Expe∣diency
of the King's sending an Embassy into <HI>Spain;</HI> and proposed,
that himself and the Chancellor should be appointed Ambassadors to
that Court, to which the Chancellor consented; and upon the Lord
<HI>Cottington's</HI> Representation of the Matter to the King, his Majesty
soon after publickly declared his Resolution to send those Two, Am∣bassadors

<P>THIS was no sooner known,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Murmurs of the Court on his being appointed Am∣bassador to</HI> Spain.</NOTE> but all kind of People, who agreed in
nothing else, murmured, and complained of this Counsel; and the more,
because it had never been mentioned, or debated in Council. Only the
<HI>Scots</HI> were very glad of it (<HI>Montrose</HI> excepted) believing that when the
Chancellor was gone, their beloved Covenant would not be so irreverently
mentioned; and that the King would be wrought upon to withdraw all
Countenance and Favour from the Marquis of <HI>Montrose;</HI> and the Marquis
himself looked upon it as a deserting him, and complying with the other
Party; and from that Time, though They lived with Civility towards each<MILESTONE N="40"/>
other, He withdrew very much of his Confidence, which He had formerly
reposed in him. They who loved him were sorry for him, and themselves;
They thought He deserted a Path He had long trod, and was well ac∣quainted
with; and was henceforward to move <HI>extra Sphaeram Activitatis,</HI>
in an Office He had not been acquainted with; and then They should
want his Credit to support, and confirm them in the King's Favour and
Grace: And there were many who were very sorry when They heard it,
out of particular Duty to the King; who being young, They thought
might be without that Counsel, and Advertisement, which They knew
well He would still administer to him.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>No Man was more angry, and offended with the Counsel than the
Lord <HI>Colepepper;</HI> who would have been very glad to have gone himself in
the Employment, if He could have persuaded the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> to have
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
accepted his Company; which He would by no Means do; and though
He and the Chancellor were not thought to have the greatest Kindness for
each other, yet He knew He could agree with no other Man so well in
Business; and was very unwilling He should be from the Person of the
King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His own Con∣tent in that Office.</NOTE> But the Chancellor himself, from the Time that the King had sig∣nified
his own Pleasure to him, was exceedingly pleased with the Com∣mission;
and did believe that He should in some Degree improve his Un∣derstanding,
and very much refresh his Spirits, by what He should learn
by the one, and by his Absence from being continually conversant with
<MILESTONE N="10"/>those Wants which could never be severed from that Court, and that Com∣pany
which would be always corrupted by those Wants. And so He sent
for his Wife, and Children, to meet him at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where He intended
They should reside whilst He continued in <HI>Spain,</HI> and where They were
like to find some Civilities in respect of his Employment.</P>
<P>THE Ambassadors took Leave of the King before the Middle of

Chancellor very graciously; but still expressed Trouble that He was sent
on that Embassy, which She said, would be fruitless, as to any Advantage
the King would receive from it; and She said, She must confess, that
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
though She was not confident of his Affection and Kindness towards her,
yet She believed that He did wish that the King's Carriage towards her,
should be always fair and respectful; and that She did desire that He
might be always about his Majesty's Person; not only because She thought
He understood the Business of <HI>England</HI> better than any Body else; but be∣cause
She knew that He loved the King, and would always give him good
Counsel, towards his living virtuously; and that She thought He had more
Credit with him, than any other, who would deal plainly and honestly
with him.</P>
<P>THERE was a Passage at that Time, of which He used to speak often,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and looked upon as a great Honour to him: The Queen one Day amongst
some of her Ladies, in whom She had most Confidence, expressed some
sharpness towards a Lord of the King's Council, whom She named not,
who She said, always gave her the fairest Words, and promised her every
Thing She desired; and had persuaded her to affect somewhat that She
had before no Mind to; and yet She was well assured, that when the same
was proposed to the King on her behalf, He was the only Man who dis∣suaded
the King from granting it. Some of the Ladies seemed to have the
Curiosity to know who it was; which the Queen would not tell; one of
them who was known to have a Friendship for him, said, She hoped it<MILESTONE N="20"/>

Directions from the Secretary of State, to persuade them to re∣main
there till the King's farther Pleasure might be known; and They
received a Packet from Sir <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> inclosing a Pass

<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THE Masquerade is an Exercise They learned from the Moors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Masque∣rade.</NOTE> per∣formed
by Squadrons of Horse, seeming to charge each other with great
Fierceness; with Bucklers in their left Hands, and a kind of Cane in their
right; which, when They come within little more than a Horse's Length,
They throw with all the Strength They can; and against them They de∣fend
themselves with very broad Bucklers; and as soon as They have
thrown their Darts, They wheel about in a full Gallop, till They can turn
to receive the like Assault from those whom They had charged; and so
several Squadrons of twenty, or five and twenty Horse, run round, and
charge each other. It hath at first the Appearance of a Martial Exercise;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Horses are very beautiful, and well adorned; the Men richly clad, and
must be good Horsemen, otherwise They could not conduct the quick
Motions and Turns of their Horses; all the rest is too childish; the Darts
being nothing else but plain Bulrushes of the biggest Growth. After this,
They run the Course; which is like our running at the Ring; save that
two run still together, and the swifter hath the Prize; a Post dividing
them at the End: From the Start They run their Horses full speed about
fifty Paces, and the Judges are at that Post to determine who is first at
the End.</P>
<P>THE next Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Description of the</HI> Toros.</NOTE> and so for two or three Days together, both the Am∣bassadors
<MILESTONE N="30"/>had a Box prepared for them, to see the <HI>Toros;</HI> which is a Spec∣tacle
very wonderful. Here the Place was very noble, being the Market∣place,
a very large Square, built with handsome Brick Houses, which had
all Balconies, which were adorned with Tapestry, and very beautiful La∣dies.
Scaffolds were built round to the first Story; the lower Rooms
being Shops, and for ordinary Use; and in the division of those Scaffolds,
all the Magistrates, and Officers of the Town knew their Places. The
Pavement of the Place was all covered with Gravel, which in Summer
Time was upon those Occasions watered by Carts charged with Hogsheads
of Water. As soon as the King comes, some Officers clear the whole
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Ground from the Common People; so that there is no Man seen upon the
Plain, but two or three <HI>Alguazills,</HI> Magistrates with their small white
Wands. Then one of the four Gates which lead into the Streets is opened;
at which the <HI>Torreadors</HI> enter, all Persons of Quality richly clad, and upon
the best Horses in <HI>Spain,</HI> every one attended by eight, or ten, or more
Lackeys, all clinquant with Gold, and Silver Lace; who carry the Spears,
which their Masters are to use against the Bulls; and with this Entry
many of the common People break in, for which sometimes They pay
very dear. The Persons on Horseback have all Cloaks solded up upon
their left Shoulder; the least Disorder of which, much more the letting
<MILESTONE N="50"/>it fall, is a very great Disgrace; and in that grave Order, They march to
the Place where the King sits, and after They have made the Reverences,
They place themselves at a good Distance from one another, and expect
the Bull.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="121"/>
THE Bulls are brought in the Night before from the Mountains, by
People used to that Work; who drive them into the Town when no Body
is in the Streets, into a Pen made for them, which hath a Door that opens
into that large Space; the Key whereof is sent to the King, which the
King, when He sees every Thing ready, throws to an <HI>Alguazill,</HI> who
carries it to the Officer that keeps the Door; and He causes it to be open∣ed
when a single Bull is ready to come out. When the Bull enters, the
common People who fit over the Door, or near it, strike him, or throw
short Darts with sharp Points of Steel to provoke him to Rage: He com∣monly
runs with all his Fury against the first Man he sees on Horseback;<MILESTONE N="10"/>
who watches him so carefully, and avoids him so dexterously, that when
the Spectators believe him to be even between the Horns of the Bull, He
avoids him by the quick Turn of his Horse; and with his Lance strikes
the Bull upon a Vein that runs through his Pole, with which in a Mo∣ment
he falls down dead. But this fatal Stroke can never be struck, but
when the Bull comes so near upon the Turn of the Horse, that his Horn
even touches the Rider's Leg; and so is at such a Distance, that He can
shorten his Lance, and use the full Strength of his Arm in the Blow; and
They who are the most skilful in the Exercise, do frequently kill the Beast
with such an exact Stroke: insomuch as in a Day, two, or three fall in<MILESTONE N="20"/>
that Manner: But if They miss the Vein, it only gives a Wound that the
more enrages him.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Bull runs with so much Fierceness (for if he escapes the
first Man, he runs upon the rest as They are in his Way) that he gores the
Horse with his Horns, so that his Guts come out, and He falls, before the
Rider can get from his Back. Sometimes, by the Strength of his Neck,
he raises Horse and Man from the Ground, and throws both down; and
then the greatest Danger is another Gore upon the Ground. In any of
these Disgraces, or any other, by which the Rider comes to be dismounted,
He is obliged in Honour to take his Revenge upon the Bull by his Sword,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and upon his Head; towards which the Standers by assist him, by run∣ning
after the Bull, and hocking him, by which he falls upon his hinder
Legs, but before that Execution can be done, a good Bull hath his Re∣venge
upon many poor Fellows. Sometimes he is so unruly that no Body
dares to attack him; and then the King calls for the Mastiffs, whereof
two are let out at a Time, and if they cannot master him, but are them∣selves
killed, as frequently they are, the King then, as the last Refuge,
calls for the <HI>English</HI> Mastiffs, of which They seldom turn out above one at
a Time, and he rarely misses taking the Bull, and holding him by the Nose,
till the Men run in; and after They have hocked him, They quickly kill<MILESTONE N="40"/>
him.</P>
<P>IN one of those Days there were no fewer than sixteen Horses, as good
as any in <HI>Spain,</HI> the worst of which would that very Morning have yielded
three hundred Pistoles, killed, and four or five Men; besides many more
of both hurt, and some Men remained perpetually maimed: for after the
Horsemen have done as much as They can, They withdraw themselves,
and then some accustomed nimble Fellows to whom Money is thrown,
when They perform their Feats with Skill, stand to receive the Bulls,
whereof the worst are reserved till the last; and it is a wonderful Thing
to see with what Steadiness those Fellows will stand a full Career of the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Bull, and by a little quick Motion upon one Foot, avoid him, and lay a
Hand upon his Horn, as if They guided him from them; but then the
next Standers by, who have not the same Activity, commonly pay for it;
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
and there is no Day without much Mischief. It is a very barbarous Exer∣cise,
and Triumph; in which so many Mens Lives are lost, and always
ventured; but so rooted in the Affections of that Nation, that it is not in
the King's Power, They say, to suppress it; though if He disliked it
enough, He might forbear to be present at it.</P>
<P>THERE are three Festival Days in the Year, whereof <HI>Midsummer</HI> is one,
on which the People hold it to be their Right to be treated with these
Spectacles; not only in great Cities, where They are never disappointed,
but in very ordinary Towns, where there are Places provided for it. Be∣sides
<MILESTONE N="10"/>those ordinary annual Days, upon any extraordinary Accidents of
Joy, as at this Time for the Arrival of the Queen, upon the Birth of the
King's Children, or any signal Victory, these Triumphs are repeated;
which no Ecclesiastical Censures, or Authority can suppress, or discounte∣nance;
for Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the V, in the Time of <HI>Philip</HI> the II, and very
probably with his Approbation, if not upon his Desire, published a Bull
against the <HI>Toros</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> which is still in force; in which He declared,
that no Body should be capable of <HI>Christian</HI> Burial, who lost his Life at
those Spectacles; and that every Clergyman who should be present at
them, stood excommunicated <HI>ipso facto;</HI> and yet there is always one of the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>largest Galleries assigned to the Office of the Inquisition, and the chief of
the Clergy, which is always filled; besides that many Religious Men in
their Habits get other Places; only the <HI>Jesuits</HI> out of their Submission to
the supreme Authority of the Pope, are never present there; but on those
Days, do always appoint some such solemn Exercise to be performed, that
obliges their whole Body to be together.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is not the Course for the Ambassadors to make their Visits
to those who come last,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Is visited by the other Am∣bassadors at</HI> Madrid, <HI>be∣fore his Au∣dience.</HI></NOTE> before They receive their first Audience from the
King; yet the very Night They came to the Town, the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambas∣sador
sent to congratulate their Arrival, and to know what Hour They
<MILESTONE N="30"/>would assign of the next Day to receive a Visit from him: To which
They returned their Acknowledgments; and that when They had ob∣tained
their Audience of the King, They would be ready to receive that
Honour from him. However, the very next Day He came to visit them;
and He was no sooner gone, but the <HI>German</HI> Ambassador, not sending
Notice till He was at the bottom of the Stairs, likewise came to them;
and then the other Ambassadors, and Publick Ministers took their Times
to make their Visits, without attending the Audience.</P>
<P>THERE was one Thing very notable,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some Account of the Ambas∣sadors then at</HI> Madrid.</NOTE> that all the foreign Ministers re∣siding
then in <HI>Madrid</HI> (the <HI>English</HI> Ambassadors, and the Resident of

of the Great Duke.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Julio Ros∣pigliosi.</NOTE> <HI>Julio Rospigliosi</HI> Nuntio for the Pope, was of

He was afterwards, Pope, as He was <HI>Clement</HI> the IX. The Emperor's
Ambassador,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Mar∣quis of</HI> Grana.</NOTE> the Marquis of <HI>Grana</HI> was likewise an <HI>Italian,</HI> and a Subject
of <HI>Florence;</HI> He had been General of one of the Emperor's Armies, and
was sent afterwards Ambassador to <HI>Madrid;</HI> He was a Man of great
Parts; and the removing the Conde-Duke <HI>Olivarez</HI> from Court, was
imputed to his Artifice. He made the Match between the King, and the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>present Queen, for which He expected to have the Cap of a Cardinal;
and had received it, if He had not died before the following Creation;
the Cardinal of <HI>Hesse</HI> being nominated by the Emperor upon his Death.
He was a Man of an imperious, and insolent Nature, and capable of any
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
Temptation, and no Body was more glad of his Death than his own Ser∣vants,
over whom He was a great Tyrant.</P>
<P>THE Ambassador of <HI>Venice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the</HI> Vene∣tian <HI>Ambas∣sador.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pietro Basadonna,</HI> a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> was a
Man, as all that Nation is, of great Civility, and much Profession; He
was the first who told the Ambassadors, that the King their Master had a
Resident at <HI>Venice;</HI> which was Mr. <HI>Killigrew,</HI> which They did not at first
believe, having before They left St. <HI>Germains,</HI> dissuaded the King from
that Purpose; but afterwards his Majesty was prevailed upon, only to gra∣tify
him, that in that Capacity, He might borrow Money of <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants
for his own Subsistence; which He did, and nothing to the Honour<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of his Master; but was at last compelled to leave the Republick, for his
vicious Behaviour; of which the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambassador complained to the
King, when He came afterwards to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>THE Ambassador of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the</HI> Polish <HI>Ambassador.</HI></NOTE> was likewise a <HI>Florentine;</HI>
who was much in Favour with the King <HI>Uladislaus,</HI> from whom He was
sent; and continued by King <HI>Casimir.</HI> He had lived in great Splendour;
but by his vicious Course of Life, and some Miscarriages, He fell very low,
and was revoked with some Circumstances of Dishonour. He was a Man of
a great Wit; if it had not served him to very ill Purposes. The Ambas∣sador
of <HI>Florence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Am∣bassador of</HI> Florence.</NOTE> was a Subject of his Master, and an Abbot; a grave<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Man, and though He was frequently called Ambassador, He was in Truth
but Resident; which was discovered by a Contest He had with the <HI>Den∣mark</HI>
Resident for Place; who alledged, that the other was no more than
Resident; which was true, and made the Discovery that the <HI>Florentines</HI>
send no Ambassadors to <HI>Madrid,</HI> because They are not suffered to cover,
which They use to do in many other Courts. The Arch-Duke of <HI>In∣spruck</HI>'s
Minister was likewise a <HI>Florentine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Arch-Duke of</HI> In spruck's <HI>Mi∣nister.</HI></NOTE> and had been bred in <HI>Spain,</HI>
and was a Knight of the Order; and supported that Character upon a
small Assignation from his Master, for some Benefit and Advantage it gave
him in Negotiations, and Pretences He had in that Court.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE Resident of <HI>Denmark</HI> was Don <HI>Henrique Williamson</HI> (He was af∣terwards
called <HI>Rosewell</HI>) who came Secretary to <HI>Hannibal Zested;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Resi∣dent of</HI> Den∣mark.</NOTE> who
had been the Year before Ambassador in that Court, and lived in extraor∣dinary
Splendour, as all the Northern Ministers do; who have not their
Allowance from the King, but from a Revenue that is purposely set aside
for that Kind of Service. When He went away, He left this Gentleman to
remain there as Resident. He was a grave, and a sober Man, wiser than
most of his Nation; and lived with much more Plenty, and with a better
Retinue than any other Minister of that Rank in that Court.</P>
<P>THEY had not been many Days in <HI>Madrid,</HI> when Don <HI>Lewis</HI> sent them<MILESTONE N="40"/>

Time that They had left <HI>Paris.</HI> There was yet no House provided for
them, which They took very heavily; and believed that it might advance
that Business, if They had once a publick Reception as Ambassadors; and
therefore They resolved to demand an Audience. Don <HI>Lewis</HI> came to be
advertised, that the Ambassadors had prepared Mourning for themselves,
and all their Train, against their Audience, which was true; for They
thought it the most proper Dress to appear in, and to demand Assistance<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to revenge the Murder of their Master, it being yet within the Year: But
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> sent to them, that He hoped that when the whole Court was
<HI>in Gala,</HI> upon the Joy of the Marriage of the King, and to give the Queen
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
a cheerful Reception; They would not dishonour the Festival by appear∣ing
<HI>in Luto,</HI> which the King could not but take unkindly; which He
said, He thought fit to advertise them of, out of Friendship, and without
any Authority. Whereupon, as well to comply in an Affair which seem∣ed
to have somewhat of Reason in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Cotting∣ton, <HI>and the Chancellor of the Exchequer demand their Audience.</HI></NOTE> as out of Apprehension, that from

of <HI>Spain,</HI> desiring them to depart, since their Presence in the Court
would be prejudicial to his Affairs—They imagined this proceeded
from the Expectation of the Arrival of an Ambassador from the Com∣monwealth
of <HI>England,</HI> which was then reported; but They knew af∣terwards
that the true Cause of this Impatience to get rid of them, was,
that their Minister in <HI>England,</HI> having purchased many of the King's
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Pictures, and rich Furniture, had sent them to the <HI>Groyne;</HI> from whence
they were expected to arrive about that Time, at <HI>Madrid:</HI> which
They thought could not decently be brought to the Palace, while the
Ambassadors remained at the Court—<HI>Hist. of the Reb.</HI> Folio, Vol. 3.

<P>THE other Ambassador made his Journey by <HI>Alcala;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancel∣lor of the Ex∣chequer begins his Journey from</HI> Madrid▪</NOTE> and staid a Day
there, to see that University; where the College, and other Buildings made
<MILESTONE N="30"/>by the Cardinal <HI>Ximenes,</HI> are well worth the seeing; and went through
the Kingdom of <HI>Navarre</HI> to <HI>Pampeluna,</HI> where the Vice-King, the
Duke of <HI>Escalona</HI> received him; and lodged him two Days in the Palace;
and treated him with great Civility. There He was seized upon with the
Gout; yet He continued his Journey by Mules, there being no Passage by
Coach, or Litter, over the <HI>Pirenees,</HI> to <HI>Bayonne;</HI> where He was forced to
keep his Bed, and to bleed, for many Days; but was so impatient of
Delay, that after a Week's Rest, and before He was fit for the Journey,
He put himself into a Litter, and reached <HI>Bourdeaux;</HI> where He was
forced to follow the Prescription of Dr. <HI>Lopez,</HI> a very learned <HI>Jew,</HI> and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Physician; and yet went too soon from thence too; so that when He
came to <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And arrives at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> He was cast into his Bed by a new Defluxion of the Gout,
more violent than ever.</P>
<P>As soon as He had recovered any Strength, He waited upon the Queen
Mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen's Complaints to him of the Duke of</HI> York.</NOTE> who received him very graciously; complained very much to
him of the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> who having been left with her by the King
when He parted with her Majesty at <HI>Beauvais,</HI> had expresly against her
Consent, and Command, transported himself to <HI>Brussels,</HI> upon Imagina∣tions,
which had no Foundation; and upon some Treaty with the Duke
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> which She was sure could produce no good Effect. Her Majesty
<MILESTONE N="50"/>seemed most offended with Sir <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> the Attorney General, and
Sir <HI>George Ratcliffe,</HI> as the two Persons who prevailed with the Duke, and
had engaged him in that Journey, and governed him in it, against the Ad∣vice
of the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> who was his Governor; and that being disappointed
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
of what They had unreasonably looked for at <HI>Brussels,</HI> They had carried his
Royal Highness into <HI>Holland,</HI> to his Sister; who suffered much by his Pre∣sence;
the States of <HI>Holland</HI> being resolved not to suffer him to reside within
their Province; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> being lately dead of the Small Pox,
and his Son, who was born after his Death, being an Infant, and depending
so intirely upon the good Will of the States; and therefore the Princess
Royal was much troubled that the coming of the Duke her Brother into
those Parts, gave the States any Occasion of Offence. The Queen said, that
She had writ to the Duke to return into <HI>France,</HI> but had received no An∣swer;
and therefore She desired the Ambassador, as soon as He should<MILESTONE N="10"/>
come into those Parts (for He meant to go to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where his Wife
and Children then were) that He would make a Journey to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to
reduce the Duke, and to prevail with him to return into <HI>France;</HI> which
the Ambassador could not refuse to promise.</P>
<P>HE found there the Queen's own Family in some Disorder, upon some
Declaration She had made, that the Protestant Chaplain should be no
more permitted to perform his Function in the <HI>Louvre;</HI> where the Queen's
Court resided, and where there was a lower Room which had been always
used as a Chapel, from the Time of the Prince's first coming thither, to
that Time; and where twice a Day, the Common Prayer was read to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
those who were Protestants, in both Families; and now the Queen had
signified to Dr. <HI>Cosins</HI> (who was the Chaplain assigned by the late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Cosins <HI>forbid to offi∣ciate to the Protestants in the Queen's Family.</HI></NOTE> to
attend in her Majesty's Family, for the Protestant Part of it) that He
should be no more permitted to have the Use of that Room.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer took this Occasion to speak with
the Queen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor speaks to the Queen on that Subject.</NOTE> and put her in Mind of some Promise She had made him,
when He took his Leave of her to go for <HI>Spain,</HI> that She would not with∣draw
her Stipend, which She allowed to Dr. <HI>Cosins;</HI> whereby He must be
compelled to withdraw; and so the Protestant Part of her Family would
be deprived of their publick Devotions; which Promise She had observed<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to that Time: But if now the Room should be taken from that Use, it
would be the same Thing, as if the Chaplain was turned away. He put
her Majesty in Mind of the ill Impression it might make in the Hearts of
the Protestants in <HI>England,</HI> who retained their Respects, and Duty for her
Majesty; and of what pernicious Consequence it might prove to the King,
who was still in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in a hopeful Condition; and depended most
upon the Affections of his Protestant Subjects of <HI>England;</HI> and in the last
Place, whether it might not prove a better Argument to those, who were
suspected by her to mislead the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to dissuade him from re∣turning
to her, since She would not permit him to have the Exercise of his<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Religion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Answer.</NOTE> The Queen seemed to think that what He said, was not with∣out
Reason, and confessed that She was not the Author of this new Re∣solution,
which She did not believe to be seasonable.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Walter Montague,</HI> who had some Years ago changed his Religion,
and was become Catholick, after He had sustained a long Imprisonment
in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> procured his Release from thence, upon Assu∣rance
that He would no more return into <HI>England;</HI> and so came into
<HI>France,</HI> where He was very well known in the <HI>French,</HI> as well, as the
<HI>English</HI> Court, and in great Reputation, and Esteem with both Queens.
He appeared a Man wholly restrained from all the Vanity, and Levity<MILESTONE N="50"/>
of his former Life; and perfectly mortified to the Pleasures of the World,
which He had enjoyed in a very great Measure and Excess.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="128"/>
HE dedicated himself to his Studies with great Austerity; and seemed
to have no Affection, or Ambition for Preferment; but to live within
himself upon the very moderate Exhibition He had left to him by his Fa∣ther;
and in this melancholick Retreat He had newly taken the Order of
Priesthood; which was in Truth, the most reasonable Way to satisfy his
Ambition, if He had any left; for both the Queen Regent, and the Car∣dinal,
could not but liberally provide for his Support, in that Profession;
which They did very shortly after: and this devout Profession, and new
Function much improved the Interest, and Credit He always had in his old
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Mistress; who very much hearkened to him in Cases of Conscience: and
She confessed to the Chancellor, that He was a little too bigotted in this
Affair; and had not only pressed her very passionately to remove the Scan∣dal
of having a Protestant Chapel in her House, as inconsistent with a good
Conscience; but had likewise inflamed the Queen Regent with the same
Zeal; who had very earnestly pressed and importuned her Majesty no
longer to permit that Offence to be given to the Catholick Religion. And
upon this Occasion She lamented the Death of her late Confessor, Father
<HI>Philips,</HI> who, She said, was a very discreet Man, and would never suffer
her to be troubled with such Infusions, and Scruples. In Conclusion, She
<MILESTONE N="20"/>wished him to confer with Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> and to try if He could with∣draw
him from that Asperity in that Particular; to which Purpose, the
Chancellor conferred with him, but without any Effect.</P>
<P>HE said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor confers with Mr.</HI> Monta∣gue <HI>thereon▪ but without Effect.</HI></NOTE> the House was the King of <HI>France</HI>'s; who only permitted the
Queen to live there; and that the Queen Regent thought her self bound
in Conscience no longer to suffer that Reproach, of which She had never
had Information till very lately: That if the Duke of <HI>York</HI> came thither,
there was no Thought, or Purpose to deny him the Exercise of his Reli∣gion;
He might have his Chaplain say Prayers to him in his own Cham∣ber;
or in some Room adjacent, which served likewise to all other Pur∣poses;
<MILESTONE N="30"/>but that the setting a Room apart, as this was, for that Service,
was upon the Matter dedicating it as a Chapel, for the Exercise of a Reli∣gion,
contrary to what was established in that Kingdom; which the King
of <HI>France</HI> would not suffer to be done in a House of his, though the King
should return thither again. He undervalued all the Considerations which
were offered of <HI>England,</HI> or of a Protestant Interest; as if He thought
them all, as no Doubt He did, of no Importance to the King's Restora∣tion,
which could never be effected but by that Interest which was quite
opposite to it. When He gave the Queen an Account of this Discourse,
He prevailed so far with her, that She promised, in Case She should be
<MILESTONE N="40"/>compelled to take away that Room, as She soresaw She should be, the Fa∣mily
should be permitted to meet in some other Room; and if the Duke
of <HI>York</HI> came, the Place that should be appointed for his Devotions, should
serve for all the rest to resort to.</P>
<P>As soon as the Chancellor had recovered his strength, He took Leave of
the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r goe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>Brus∣sels.</HI></NOTE> and pursued his Journey for <HI>Flanders.</HI> At <HI>Brussels</HI> He staid
till He had an Audience of the Arch-Duke, to whom He had Letters from
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Don <HI>Lewis;</HI> by which the King signified his Plea∣sure,
that He should reside any where in those Provinces He best liked,
until He could conveniently repair to the King his Master; and that in the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>mean Time He should enjoy all the Privileges due to an Ambassador: And
so He had his Audience in that Quality. He spake in <HI>Latin,</HI> and the
Arch-Duke answering in the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Arch-Duke.</NOTE> assured him of all the Respects He
could pay him, whilst He staid in those Parts; and thereupon He went
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
to his Family at <HI>Antwerp,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And resides with his Fa∣mily at</HI> Ant∣werp <HI>in the Character of Ambassador.</HI></NOTE> and kept that Character till the King's coming
into <HI>France,</HI> and his Return to him; by Means whereof He enjoyed many
Privileges, and Exemptions in the Town; and had the Freedom of his
Chapel, not only for his own Devotions, but for the Resort of all the Pro∣testants,
who were then in the Town; whereof the Marquis of <HI>Newcastle,</HI>
the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and Sir <HI>Charles Cavendish</HI> were the principal; who
came always on the <HI>Sundays,</HI> and frequently on the Week Days, to the
Common Prayer, to the Grief of many <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Roman Catho∣licks;
who used all the malicious Artifices They could, to procure that
Liberty to be restrained; and which could not have been enjoyed under<MILESTONE N="10"/>
any other Concession, than by the Privilege of an Ambassador.</P>
<P>WHILST He was preparing to make a Journey to the <HI>Hague</HI> to wait
upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> according to the Promise He had made to the
Queen, He received Information from the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his Royal High∣ness
would be at <HI>Breda</HI> such a Day;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes to the Duke of</HI> York <HI>at</HI> Breda, <HI>to persuade him to return to</HI> Paris.</NOTE> whereupon He was glad to shorten
his Journey, and at the Day, to kiss his Hands there; where He found
his Highness newly arrived; and in an Inclination enough to return to the
Queen; so that the Chancellor had no great Task to confirm him in that
Resolution; nor in Truth did He know what else to do: however all about
him were very glad of the Chancellor's Presence, every Body hoping to get<MILESTONE N="20"/>
him to their Party, that He might be ready to make a fair Report of their
Behaviour to the King; whom They knew the Queen would endeavour
to incense against them.</P>
<P>NEVER little Family was torn into so many Pieces and Factions.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some account of the Duke of</HI> York'<HI>s Fa∣mily.</HI></NOTE> The
Duke was very young; yet loved Intrigues so well, that He was too much
inclined to hearken to any Men, who had the Confidence to make bold
Propositions to him. The King had appointed him to remain with the
Queen; and to obey her in all Things, Religion only excepted. The
Lord <HI>Byron</HI> was his Governour, ordained to be so by his Father, and very
fit for that Province; being a very fine Gentleman; well bred both in<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and perfectly versed in both Languages; of great
Courage, and Fidelity; and in all Respects qualified for the Trust; but his
being absent in the King's Service, when the Duke made his Escape out of
<HI>England,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Berkley</HI> being then put about him, all Pains had
been taken to lessen his Esteem of the Lord <HI>Byron;</HI> and Sir <HI>John Berkley</HI>
knowing that He could no longer remain Governour, when the Lord <HI>Byron</HI>
came thither; and hearing that He was in his Journey, infused into the
Duke's Mind, that it was a great lessening of his Dignity at that Age (when
He was not above fourteen Years of Age, and backward enough for that
Age) to be under a Governour; and so partly by disesteeming the Person,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and partly by reproaching the Office, He grew less inclined to the Person
of that good Lord, than He should have been.</P>
<P>BUT what Title soever any Body had, the whole Authority was in the
Queen; not only by the Direction of the King, but by inevitable Neces∣sity;
for there was no Kind of Fund assigned for the Support of the Duke;
but He depended entirely upon the Queen his Mother's Bounty, who had
no more assigned for her self, than They, to whom the Management there∣of
was committed, knew well how to dispose of, nor was it enough to serve
their Occasions; so that her Majesty her self, certainly spent less upon her
own Person, or in any Thing relating to her self, than ever any Queen,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
or Lady of a very eminent Degree did. This visible, and total Depen∣dance
of the Duke upon his Mother, made her Majesty the less apprehen∣sive
of his doing any Thing contrary to her liking; and there was not that
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
Care for the general Part of his Education; nor that Indulgence to his Per∣son,
as ought to have been; and the Queen's own Carriage and Behaviour
towards him was at least severe enough; as it had been before to the King,
in the Time that He was Prince; which then, and now gave Opportu∣nity
to those, who were not themselves at Ease, to make many Infusions;
which how contrary soever to their Duties, were not so unreasonable, as
to be easily rejected, or to make no Impression.</P>
<P>THE King at his going from <HI>Beauvais</HI> in his Voyage for <HI>Scotland,</HI> had
given some Recommendation to the Duke his Brother, of Sir <HI>George Rat∣cliffe;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to whose Care his Father had once designed to commit him, when
He meant to have sent him into <HI>Ireland;</HI> and his Majesty had likewise, at
the same Time at <HI>Beauvais,</HI> made some Promise to Sir <HI>George Ratcliffe</HI> of
some Place about his Brother, when his Family should be settled, of which
there was then little Appearance: however it was enough to entitle him
to give his frequent Attendance upon the Duke; and the general Reputa∣tion
He had, of having been the Person of the nearest Trust with the Earl
of <HI>Strafford,</HI> might well dispose the Duke to think him a wise Man; and
the better to esteem any Thing He said to him.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> thought himself the wisest Man that followed the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>King's Fortune; and was always angry that He had no more to do; and
now Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was absent, endeavoured all He could, to get Credit
with the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> and came very frequently to him, and held him
in long Whispers, which the Duke easily indulged to him, out of a real
Belief that He was a Man of great Wisdom, and Experience. The Queen
liked neither of these two; which They well enough discerning, grew
into a Friendship, or rather, a Familiarity together, though They were
of the most different Natures, and Humours imaginable: <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> being
a Man very capable of Business; and if the Prosperity of his former For∣tune,
had not raised in him some Fumes of Vanity, and Self-conceited∣ness,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>was very fit to be advised with; being of a Nature constant, and sin∣cere;
which the other was not; yet They agreed well in the Design of
making the Duke of <HI>York</HI> discontented, and weary of his Condition;
which was not pleasant enough to be much delighted in.</P>
<P>THE news from <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cause of the Duke of</HI> York's <HI>having left</HI> Paris.</NOTE> of the State of the King's Affairs in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
made most Men believe that his Majesty was irrecoverably lost; and there
was for some Time a Rumour scattered abroad, and by many believed, that
the King was dead. These two Gentlemen, upon the Fame of this, con∣sulted
together, whether if the news were, or should be true, the Duke
of <HI>York,</HI> who must succeed, were in a good Place; and both concluded,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>that in that Case, it would not be fit that He should be with his Mother.
Hereupon They persuaded the Duke, that it was not fit for him to remain
idle in <HI>France;</HI> but to employ himself Abroad, whereby his Experience
might be improved; and He might put himself into a Posture to be able to
assist the King his Brother; or if any Misfortune should befal him, in some
Degree to provide for himself; and proposed to him, that He would re∣solve
to make a Journey to <HI>Brussels,</HI> to advise and consult with the Duke
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was a Prince of great Wisdom, Wealth, and Courage;
and being driven out of his own Country, by too powerful and potent a
Neighbour, had yet by his own Activity, and Virtue made himself so con∣siderable,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that <HI>Spain</HI> depended upon his Army; and <HI>France</HI> it self would
be glad of his Friendship; that He was very rich, and would not be
only able to give the Duke good Counsel, but Assistance to make it ef∣fectual.

“do the King any Service, He would immediately go into <HI>England,</HI> and
with his Majesty's Approbation into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where if He could do no
other Service, He was confident He could draw off many of the <HI>Irish</HI>
from the Service of the Rebels.” The Queen, upon the good Reputation
He had there, accepted his Offer, and writ a Letter by him to the King,
with a very good Character of his Person, and as very fit to be trusted in
<HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>IT was his Fortune to come to the King very few Days before the Battle
of <HI>Naseby,</HI> where as a Volunteer in the Troop of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> He be∣haved
himself with very signal Courage in the View of the King himself;<MILESTONE N="10"/>
who shortly after gave him a Letter full of Recommendation and Testimony
to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> his Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who received him
kindly, and having conferred with him at large, and understood all He
intended to do, gave him Leave to go into the <HI>Irish</HI> Quarters and to re∣turn
again, as He thought fit. And in a short Time after, both his Father
and his elder Brother died; whereby both the Title and the Estate devolved
to him, and He was possessed accordingly.</P>
<P>THE Man was before and in his Nature elate and proud enough, had a
greater Value of himself than other Men had, and a less of other Men
than They deserved, whereby He got not himself beloved by many; but<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Nobody who loved him worst ever suspected him to incline to the Rebels,
though They knew that He was often in their Quarters, and had often
Conferences with them: And a good Part of his Estate lay in their Quar∣ters.
He attended upon the Lord Lieutenant in all his Expeditions: And
when the <HI>Irish</HI> so infamously broke the first Peace, and besieged the Lieu∣tenant
in <HI>Dublin</HI> (upon which He was compelled to deliver it into the Hands
of the Parliament with the King's Consent), the Lord <HI>Fitzwilliams</HI> returned
with him or about the same Time into <HI>England,</HI> and from thence again into
<HI>France;</HI> where He married the Daughter of the Widow Countess of <HI>Clare,</HI>
and Sister to that Earl, a Lady of a Religion the most opposite to the Roman<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Catholick, which He suffered her to enjoy without any Contradiction.
When the War was at an End in <HI>England,</HI> and the King a Prisoner, He
with his Wife and Family transported himself into <HI>England,</HI> and after some
Time into <HI>Ireland;</HI> where <HI>Cromwell</HI> had a jealous Eye upon him, but
not being able to discover any Thing against him, could not hinder him
from possessing the Estate that had descended to him from his Father and
his elder Brother. And the War being there ended, and the Settlement
made by the Act of Parliament upon the Statute, as hath been mentioned
before, there was not the least Trouble given to him; but He quietly en∣joyed
the Possession of his whole Estate till the King's Return, when He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
came into <HI>England</HI> to kiss his Majesty's Hand, and was by him made Earl
of <HI>Tyrconnell.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Commissioners sate upon the first Act, who observed no
Rules of Justice, Law or Equity, when they contradicted any Interest or
Appetite of their own, He received no Disturbance; but when these new
Commissioners came over, all Men, as well <HI>Protestants</HI> as others, whose
Estates had never been questioned, thought it safest for them to put in
their Claims before the Commissioners, to prevent any Trouble that might
arise hereafter. This Gentleman followed that Advice and Example, put
in his Claim, and pressed the Commissioners for a short Day to be heard.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
The Day was appointed. Neither <HI>Adventurer,</HI> Soldier, or any other Per∣son,
made any Title to the Land: But some envious Person, unqualified for
any Prosecution, offered a Letter to the Commissioners which had many
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
Years before, and before his Coming into <HI>Ireland,</HI> been written by Colonel
<HI>Fitzwilliams</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> to a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> one <HI>Hartogan,</HI> then in <HI>Ireland;</HI> in
which He gave him Notice “of his Purpose of coming into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where
He hoped to do their Friends some Service.”</P>
<P>THIS Letter was writ when the Queen first designed to send him to the
King, that the <HI>Irish,</HI> who were the most jealous People of the World,
might know of his Purpose to come thither, before They should hear of
his being in <HI>Dublin;</HI> and now being produced before the Commissioners,
without considering how long since it was writ or the Reason of writing it,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that He had served the King, and never in the least Degree against him,
upon one of their Rules, “that a Correspondence with the Rebels was a
good Evidence,” They without any Pause declared him nocent, and pre∣sently
assigned his Estate to some Persons to whom Reprisals were to be
made: Whilst They who thought the Judgment very unjust, laughed at the
ill Luck of a Man whom They did not love; and all Men were well
enough pleased with the Sentence, who were displeased with the Person.
And this Party pursued him so severely into <HI>England,</HI> that the King's In∣terposition
to redeem him from so unjust a Decree, was looked upon as over∣favouring
the <HI>Irish;</HI> when none were so glad of the Decree as the <HI>Irish,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>who universally hated him. Nor was He at last restored to the Possession
of his Estate, without making some Composition with those to whom the
Commissioners had assigned it.</P>
<P>MANY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Decrees made upon Settlements notoriously forged.</NOTE> who had formerly made their Claims without insisting upon any
Deeds of Settlement or other Conveyances in Law, now produced former
Settlements in Consideration of Marriage, or other like good Considerations
in Law, made before the Beginning of the Rebellion: Which being now
proved by Witnesses enough, Decrees were every Day obtained for the Re∣stitution
of great Quantities of Land upon those Deeds and Conveyances;
though the Forgeries of those Deeds and Perjury of those Witnesses were very
<MILESTONE N="30"/>notorious. And some Instances were given of the Manifestation and direct
Proof that was made of the Forgery of Deeds, upon which Decrees had been
made, to the Satisfaction of the Commissioners themselves, within a very short
Time after the pronouncing those Decrees: And yet no Reparation was
given, but the Decrees proceeded and were executed with all Rigour, as
if no such Thing had appeared.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commis∣sioners De∣fence.</NOTE> “that They had made no Decrees but
according to their Consciences, and such as They were obliged to make
by the Course and Rule of Justice. That They did doubt and in
Truth believe, that there had been evil Practices used both in the forging
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of Deeds and corrupting of Witnesses, and that the same was equally
practised by the <HI>English</HI> as the <HI>Irish:</HI> And therefore that They had been
obliged to make that Order, which had been so much excepted against,
<HI>not to admit the Testimony of any</HI> English Adventurer <HI>or Soldier in the Case
of another</HI> Adventurer <HI>or Soldier;</HI> for that it was very notorious, They
looked upon the Whole as one joint Interest, and so gratified each other
in their Testimonies.” And of this They gave many sad Instances, by
which it was too evident that the Perjuries were mutual, and too much
practised by the one and the other Side.</P>
<P>“THAT They had used all the Providence and Vigilance They could, by
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the careful Examination of Witnesses (which were produced apart, and
never in the Presence of each other), and by asking them all such material
Questions as occurred to their Understandings, and which They could
not expect to be asked, to discover the Truth, and to prevent and manifest
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
all Perjuries. That They had likewise used their utmost Diligence and
Care, to prevent their being imposed upon with false and forged Deeds
and Conveyances, by taking a precise and strict View themselves of all
Deeds produced; and interrogated the Witnesses with all the Cunning
They could, upon the Matter and Consideration upon which such Deeds
had been entered into, and upon the Manner and Circumstances in the
Execution thereof: Which was all the Providence They could use. And
though They met with many Reasons oftentimes to doubt the Integrity of
the Proceedings, and in their own private Consciences to apprehend there
might be great Corruption; yet that They were obliged judicially to deter∣mine<MILESTONE N="10"/>
according to the Testimony of the Witnesses, and the Evidence of those
Deeds in Law against which no Proofs were made. That They had con∣stantly
heard all that the adverse Party had thought fit to object, both
against the Credit of any Witnesses, and the Truth and Validity of any
Conveyances which were produced; upon which They had rejected many
Witnesses, and disallowed some Conveyances: But when the Objections
were only founded upon Presumptions and Probabilities, as most usually
they were, they could not weigh down the full and categorical Evidence
that was given.”</P>
<P>“THAT if They had yielded to the Importunities of the Persons concerned,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
who often pressed to have farther Time given to them to prove such a Perjury,
or to disprove such a Conveyance; it must have made their Work endless,
and stopped all Manner of Proceedings, for which it appeared They were
streightened too much in Time: And that indeed would have but opened
the Door wider for Perjuries and other Corruptions; since it was very plain
to them, that either Side could bring as many Witnesses as They pleased, to
prove what They pleased, and that They would bring as many as They be∣lieved
necessary to the Work in Hand. And therefore the Commissioners
having before prescribed a Method and Rule to themselves for their Pro∣ceedings,
and that no Man could have a Cause, in which He was concerned,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
brought to Hearing without his knowing when it was to be heard, and so
it was to be presumed, that He was well provided to support his own Ti∣tle;
They had thought fit, upon mature Deliberation amongst themselves,
to adhere to the Order They had prescribed to themselves and others,
and to conclude, that They would not be able to prove that another Day,
which They were not able to prove at the Time when They ought to have
been ready.”</P>
<P>“FOR the Discovery of any Forgery after the Decrees had been passed, and
upon which They had given no Reparation,” They confessed, “that some
few such Discoveries had been made to them, by which the Forgery ap∣peared<MILESTONE N="40"/>
very clearly: But as They had no Power by the Act of Parlia∣ment
to punish either Forgery or Perjury, but must leave the Examina∣tion
and Punishment thereof to the Law and to the Judges of the Law;
so, that They had only Authority to make Decrees upon such Grounds
as satisfied their Consciences, but had not any Authority to reverse those
Decrees, after they were once made and published, upon any Evidence
whatsoever.” They concluded with their humble Desire to the King,
that the most strict Examinations might be made of their Corruptions, in
which” They said “They were sure to be found very innocent, against
all the Malice that was discovered against them: That They had proceeded<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in all Things according to the Integrity of their Hearts, and the best of
their Understanding; and if through the Defect of that They had erred
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
in any Part of their Determinations and Judgments, They hoped their
Want of Wisdom should not be imputed to them as a Crime.”</P>
<P>MANY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Defence not perfectly satisfactory.</NOTE> who had a very good Opinion of the Persons and Abilities of the
Commissioners, were not yet satisfied with their Defence; nor did They
believe, that They were so strictly bound to judge upon the Testimony of
suspected Witnesses; but that They were therefore trusted with an arbitrary
Power, because it was foreseen that Juries were not like to be entire: So
that They were, upon weighing all Circumstances, to declare what in
their Consciences They believed to be true and just. That if They had
<MILESTONE N="10"/>bound themselves up by too strict and unreasonable Rules, They should rather
in Time have reformed those Rules, than think to support what was done
amiss, by the Observation of what They had prescribed to themselves. And
it was believed, that the entire Exclusion of the <HI>English</HI> from being Wit∣nesses
for the proving of what could not in Nature be otherwise proved, was
not just or reasonable. That their Want of Power to reverse or alter their
own Decrees, upon any emergent Reasons which could afterwards occur,
was a just Ground for their more serious Deliberation in and before They
passed any such Decrees. And their Excuse for not granting longer Time
when it was pressed for, was founded upon Reasons which were visibly not
<MILESTONE N="20"/>to be justified; it not being possible for any Man to defend himself against
the Claims of the <HI>Irish,</HI> without knowing what Deeds or Witnesses They
could produce for making good their Suggestions; and therefore it was as
impossible for them to have all their Evidence upon the Place. Besides
that it was very evident, that in the last ten Days of their Sitting (which
was likewise thought to be when their Power as to those Particulars was de∣termined,
and in which They had made more Decrees than in all the Time
before), They had made so many in a Day, contrary to their former Rule and
Method, that Men were plainly surprised, and could not produce those
Proofs which in a short Time They might have been supplied with; and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the refusing to allow them that Time, was upon the Matter to determine
their Interest, and to take away their Estates without being once heard,
and upon the bare Allegations of their Adversaries. And in these last De∣crees
many Instances were given of that Nature, wherein the Evidence ap∣peared
to be very full, if Time had been given to produce it.</P>
<P>THERE was one very notable Case decreed by the Commissioners ex∣tremely
complained of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Decree in Favour of the Marquis of</HI> Antrim <HI>uni∣versally com∣plained of.</HI></NOTE> and cried out against by all Parties, as well <HI>Irish</HI>
as <HI>English;</HI> and for which the Commissioners themselves made no other
Excuse or Defence, but the Receipt of a Letter from the King, which was
not thought a good Plea for sworn Judges, as the Commissioners were. It
<MILESTONE N="40"/>was the Case of the Marquis of <HI>Antrim.</HI> Which Case having been so much
upon the Stage, and so much enlarged upon to the Reproach of the King,
and even to the traducing of the Memory of his blessed Father; and those
Men, who artificially contrived the doing of all that was done amiss, having
done all They could to wound the Reputation of the Chancellor, and to
get it to be believed, “that He had by some finister Information misled the
“King to oblige the Marquis:” It is a Debt due to Truth, and to the Ho∣nour
of Both their Majesties, to set down a very particular Narration of that
whole Affair; by which it will appear, how far the King was from so
much as wishing that any Thing should be done for the Benefit of the Mar∣quis,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>which should be contrary to the Rules of Justice.</P>
<P>WHILST his Majesty was in foreign Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A very parti∣cular Relation of the Marquis of</HI> Antrim'<HI>s Case.</HI></NOTE> He received frequent Adver∣tisements
from <HI>England</HI> and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> “that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> be∣haved
himself very undutifully towards him; and that He had made himself
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
very grateful to the Rebels, by calumniating the late King: And that He
had given it under his Hand to <HI>Ireton,</HI> or some other principal Person em∣ployed
under <HI>Cromwell, that his late Majesty had sent him into</HI> Ireland <HI>to
join with the Rebels, and that his Majesty was not offended with the</HI> Irish
<HI>for entering into that Rebellion:”</HI> Which was a Calumny so false and so
odious, and reflected so much upon the Honour of his Majesty, that the
King was resolved, as soon as God should put it into his Power, to cause the
strictest Examination to be made concerning it; the Report having gained
much Credit with his Majesty, by the Notoriety that the Marquis had pro∣cured
great Recommendations from those who governed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to those<MILESTONE N="10"/>
who governed in <HI>England;</HI> and that upon the Presumption of that He had
come into <HI>England,</HI> and as far as <HI>St. Albans</HI> towards <HI>London,</HI> from whence
He had been forced suddenly to return into <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Activity of his
many Creditors, who upon the News of his Coming had provided for his
Reception, and would unavoidably have cast him into Prison. And no Re∣commendation
could have inclined those who were in Authority, to do any
Thing extraordinary for the Protection of a Person, who from the Begin∣ning
of the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebellion lay under so ill a Character with them, and had
so ill a Name throughout the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE King had been very few Days in <HI>London,</HI> after his Arrival from the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Parts beyond the Seas, when He was informed that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI>
was upon his Way from <HI>Ireland</HI> towards the Court: And the Commissioners
from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have been mentioned before, were the first who gave
his Majesty that Information, and at the same Time told him all that his
Majesty had heard before concerning the Marquis, and of the bold Calumnies
with which He had traduced his Royal Father, with many other Particulars;
“all which” They affirmed “would be proved by unquestionable Evidence,
and by Letters and Certificates under his own Hand.” Upon this full Infor∣mation
(of the Truth whereof his Majesty entertained no Doubt), as soon
as the Marquis came to the Town, He was by the King's special Order com∣mitted<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to the <HI>Tower;</HI> nor could any Petition from him, or Intreaty of his
Friends, of which He had some very powerful, prevail with his Majesty to
admit him into his Presence. But by the first Opportunity He was sent
Prisoner to <HI>Dublin,</HI> where He was committed to the <HI>Castle;</HI> the King
having given Direction, that He should be proceeded against with all
Strictness according to Law: And to that Purpose, the Lords Justices were
required to give all Orders and Directions necessary. The Marquis still
professed and avowed his Innocence, and used all the Means He could to
procure that He might be speedily brought to his Trial; which the King
likewise expected. But after a Year's Detention in Prison, and Nothing<MILESTONE N="40"/>
brought against him, He was fet at Liberty, and had a Pass given him from
the Council there to go into <HI>England.</HI> He then applied himself to his
Majesty, demanding Nothing of Favour, but said, “He expected Justice;
and that after so many Years being deprived of his Estate, He might at
last be restored to it, if Nothing could be objected against him wherein He
had disserved his Majesty.”</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman who had been bred up in the Court of <HI>England,</HI>
and having married the Dutchess of <HI>Buckingham</HI> (though against the King's
Will) He had been afterwards very well received by Both their Majesties,
and was frequently in their Presence. He had spent a very vast Estate in<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Court, without having ever received the least Benefit from it. He had
retired into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and lived upon his own Estate in that Country, some
Years before the Rebellion brake out; in the Beginning whereof He had un∣dergone
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
some Suspicion, having held some Correspondence with the Rebels,
and possibly made some Undertakings to them: But He went speedily to
<HI>Dublin,</HI> was well received by the Justices there, and from thence trans∣ported
himself with their License to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the King was; to
whom He gave so good an Account of all that had passed, that his Majesty
made no Doubt of his Affection to his Service, though He had very little
Confidence in his Judgment and Understanding, which were never re∣markable.
Besides that it was well known, that He had a very unreason∣able
Envy towards the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and would fain have it believed
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that his Interest in <HI>Ireland</HI> was so great, that He could reclaim that whole
Nation to his Majesty's Obedience; but that Vanity and Presumption never
gained the least Credit with his Majesty: Yet it may reasonably be believed
that He thought so himself, and that it was the Source from which all the
bitter Waters of his own Misfortune issued.</P>
<P>UPON the <HI>Scots</HI> second Entering into <HI>England</HI> with their Army upon the
Obligation of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and all his Majesty's Endeavours to prevent it being
disappointed, the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> had proposed to the King, “to make
a Journey privately into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to get into the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where,
with his Majesty's Authority, He hoped He should be able to draw toge∣ther
<MILESTONE N="20"/>such a Body of Men, as might give his Countrymen Cause to call
for their own Army out of <HI>England,</HI> to secure themselves.” And with
this Overture or upon Debate thereof, He wished “that the Earl of <HI>An∣trim</HI>”
(for He was then no more) “might be likewise sent into <HI>Ulster,</HI>
where his Interest lay, and from whence He would be able to transport
a Body of Men into the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where He had likewise the Clan of
<HI>Macdonnels,</HI> who acknowledged him to be their Chief, and would be
consequently at his Devotion; by which Means, the Marquis of <HI>Moun∣trose</HI>
would be enabled the more powerfully to proceed in his Under∣taking.”
The Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> entered upon this Undertaking with great
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Alacrity, and undertook to the King to perform great Matters in <HI>Scotland;</HI> to
which his own Interest and Animosity enough disposed him, having an old and
a sharp Controversy and Contestation with the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who had dis∣possessed
him of a large Territory there. All Things being adjusted for this
Undertaking, and his Majesty being well pleased with the Earl's Alacrity,
He created him at that Time a Marquis, gave him Letters to the Marquis
of <HI>Ormond</HI> his Lieutenant there, as well to satisfy him of the good Opinion
He had of the Marquis of <HI>Antrim,</HI> and of the Trust He had reposed in
him, as to wish him to give him all the Assistance He could with Conve∣nience,
for the carrying on the Expedition for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>AND for the better preventing of any Inconvenience, that might fall out
by the Rashness and Inadvertency of the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> towards the
Lord Lieutenant, his Majesty sent <HI>Daniel ONeile</HI> of his Bedchamber into
<HI>Ireland</HI> with him, who had great Power over him, and very much Credit
with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> and was a Man of that Dexterity and Ad∣dress,
that no Man could so well prevent the Inconveniences and Prejudice,
which the natural Levity and Indiscretion of the other might tempt him to, or
more dispose and incline the Lord Lieutenant to take little Notice of those
Vanities and Indiscretions. And the King, who had no Desire that the Marquis
should stay long in <HI>Dublin,</HI> upon his Promise that He would use all possible
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Expedition in transporting himself into <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave him Leave to hold that
Correspondence with the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels (who had the Command of all the
Northern Parts, and without whose Connivance at least, He could very
hardly be able to make his Levies and transport his Men) as was necessary
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
to his Purposes: Within the Limits of which, it is probable enough that
He did not contain himself; for the Education and Conversation He had
in the World, had not extirpated that natural Craft in which that Nation
excels, and by which They only deceive themselves; and might say many
Things, which He had not Authority or Warrant to say.</P>
<P>UPON his Coming to <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Lord Lieutenant gave him all the
Countenance He could wish, and assisted him in all the Ways He could
propose, to prosecute his Design; but the Men were to be raised in or near
the Rebels Quarters. And it cannot be denied, but that the Levies He
made, and sent over into <HI>Scotland</HI> under the Command of <HI>Calkito,</HI> were the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Foundation of all those wonderful Acts, which were performed afterwards by
the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> (They were fifteen hundred Men, very good, and with
very good Officers, all so hardy, that neither the ill Fare nor the ill Lodging
in the <HI>Highlands</HI> gave them any Discouragement), and gave the first Op∣portunity
to the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> of being in the Head of an Army;
under which He drew together such of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> and others of his
Friends, who were willing to repair to him. But upon any military Action,
and Defeat given to the Enemy, which happened as often as They en∣countered
the <HI>Scots,</HI> the <HI>Highlanders</HI> went always home with their Booty,
and the <HI>Irish</HI> only staid together with their General. And from this Be∣ginning<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> grew to that Power, that after many Bat∣tles
won by him with notable Slaughter of the Enemy, He marched victo∣riously
with his Army till He made himself Master of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and re∣deemed
out of the Prison there the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> Lord <HI>Ogilby,</HI> and many
other noble Persons, who had been taken and sent thither, with Resolution
that They should all lose their Heads. And the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> did
always acknowledge, that the Rise and Beginning of his good Success was
due and to be imputed to that Body of <HI>Irish,</HI> which had in the Beginning
been sent over by the Marquis of <HI>Antrim;</HI> to whom the King had ac∣knowledged
the Service by several Letters, all of his own Handwriting;<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in which were very gracious Expressions of the Sense his Majesty had of his
great Services, and his Resolution to reward him.</P>
<P>IT is true, that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> had not gone over himself with
his Men, as He had promised to do, but stayed in <HI>Ulster</HI> under Pretence of
raising a greater Body of Men, with which He would adventure his own
Person; but either out of Jealousy or Displeasure against the Marquis of
<HI>Mountrose,</HI> or having in Truth no Mind to that Service of <HI>Scotland,</HI> He
prosecuted not that Purpose, but remained still in <HI>Ulster,</HI> where all his own
Estate lay, and so was in the Rebels Quarters, and no Doubt was often in
their Councils; by which He gave great Advantages against himself, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
might in Strictness of Law have been as severely punished by the King, as
the worst of the Rebels. At last, in his moving from Place to Place (for
He was not in any Expedition with the Rebels) He was taken Prisoner by
the <HI>Scots,</HI> who intended to have put him to Death for having sent Men into
<HI>Scotland;</HI> but He made his Escape out of their Hands, and transported
himself into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and from thence, having Assurance that the Prince
(his Majesty that now is) was then in the <HI>West,</HI> He came with two good
Frigats into the Port of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and offered his Service to his Royal High∣ness;
and having in his Frigats a Quantity of Arms and some Ammunition,
which He had procured in <HI>Flanders</HI> for the Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> most of the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Arms and Ammunition were employed, with his Consent, for the Supply of
the Troops and Garrisons in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> And the Prince made Use of one of
the Frigats to transport his Person to <HI>Scilly,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Jersey;</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
without which Convenience, his Highness had been exposed to great Diffi∣culties,
and could hardly have escaped the Hands of his Enemies. After
all which, when <HI>Dublin</HI> was given up to the Parliament, and the King's
Authority was withdrawn out of that Kingdom, He again (not having
wherewithal to live any where else) transported himself into <HI>Ireland,</HI> made
himself gracious with the <HI>Irish,</HI> and was by them sent into <HI>France,</HI> to de∣sire
the Queen Mother and the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> “to send the Marquis of
<HI>Ormond</HI> to reassume his Majesty's Government in that Kingdom;” which was
done accordingly, in the Manner that is mentioned elsewhere.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THE Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> alleged all these Particulars, and produced
many original Letters from the late King (besides those which are mentioned),
the Queen Mother, and the Prince, in all which his Services had been ac∣knowledged,
and many Promises made to him; and concluded with a full
Protestation, “that He desired no Pardon for any Thing that He had ever done
against the King; and if there were the least Proof that He had failed in
his Fidelity to him, or had not according to the best of his Understanding
advanced his Service, He looked for no Favour. But if his being in the
<HI>Irish</HI> Quarters and consulting with them, without which He could not
have made his Levies for <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor transported them if He had levied
<MILESTONE N="20"/>them, and if his living amongst them afterwards, when his Majesty's Au∣thority
was drawn from thence, and when He could live no where else,
do by the strict Letter of the Law expose him to Ruin without his Ma∣jesty's
Grace and Favour, He did hope his Majesty would redeem him from
that Misery, and that the Forfeiture of his Estate should not be taken, as
if He were a Traitor and a Rebel to the King.” And it appeared that
if He were restored to all He could pretend to, or of which He had ever
been possessed, his Debts were so great, and his Creditors had those legal In∣cumbrances
upon his Estate, that his Condition at best would not be liable
to much Envy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THOUGH the King had been never taken Notice of to have any great
Inclinations to the Marquis, who was very little known to him; yet this
Representation and clear View of what He had done and what He had
suffered, raised great Compassion towards him in the Royal Breast of his
Majesty. And He thought it would in some Degree reflect upon his own
Honour and Justice, and upon the Memory of his blessed Father, if in
a Time when He passed by so many Transgressions very heinous, He
should leave the Marquis exposed to the Fury of his Enemies (who were
only his Enemies because They were possessed of his Estate, and because
He desired to have his own from them) for no other Crime upon the Mat∣ter,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>than for not having that Prudence and that Providence in his Endea∣vours
to serve the King, as He ought to have had; that is, He ought to
have been wiser. And the Rigour exercised towards him upon his first Ar∣rival,
in sending him to the <HI>Tower</HI> and afterwards into <HI>Ireland,</HI> by those who
enough wished his Destruction, and that They had not been able to make
the least Proof against him, improved his Majesty's good Disposition towards
him. Yet He refused positively to write a Letter to the Commissioners on
his Behalf; which the Marquis most importunately desired, as the only
Thing that could do him Good. But his Majesty directed a Letter to be
prepared to the Lord Lieutenant, in which all his Allegations and Suggestions
<MILESTONE N="50"/>should be set down, and the Truth thereof examined by him; and that if
He should be found to have committed no greater Faults against the King,
than those which He confessed, then that Letter should be sent to the Commis∣sioners,
that They might see Both their Majesties Testimonies in such Parti∣culars
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
as were known to themselves. And this Letter was very warily
drawn, and being approved by his Majesty, was sent accordingly to the
Lord Lieutenant. And shortly after a Copy of it signed by the King (who
conceived it only to be a Duplicate, lest the other should miscarry) was,
contrary to his Majesty's Resolution, and contrary to the Advice of the
Chancellor and without his Knowledge, likewise sent to the Commissioners;
who had thereupon made such a Decree as is before mentioned, and de∣clared,
“that They had made it only upon that Ground;” which gave his
Majesty some Trouble, and obliged him to insert a Clause in the next Bill
concerning that Affair.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>AND this was the whole Proceeding that related to the Marquis of <HI>An∣trim:</HI>
And it is yet very hard to comprehend, wherein there was more Favour
shewed towards him by his Majesty, than He might in Truth very reasonably
pretend to, what Noise soever was raised, and what Glosses soever made;
which proceeded only from the general Dislike of the Man, who had much
more Weakness than Wickedness in him, and was an Object rather of Pity
than of Malice or Envy.</P>
<P>WHEN his Majesty entered upon the Debate of the third Bill, which was
transmitted to him for a Supplement and Addition to the other two, He
quickly found the Settlement proposed, and which was the End of the three<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Bills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Difficul∣ties of a Set∣tlement in∣creased.</NOTE> was now grown more difficult than ever. All the Measures, which
had formerly been taken from the great Proportion of Land which would
remain to be disposed of, were no more to be relied upon, but appeared to
have been a wrong Foundation from the Beginning; which was now made
more desperate, by the vast Proportions which had been assigned to the <HI>Irish</HI>
by the Commissioners Decrees: And somewhat had intervened by some
Acts of Bounty from his Majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By some im∣provident Acts of Bounty in the King.</NOTE> which had not been carefully enough
watched and represented to him.</P>
<P>THE King had, upon passing the former Bills, and upon discerning how
much the <HI>Irish</HI> were like to suffer, resolved to retain, all that should by<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Forfeiture or otherwise come to his Majesty, in his own Power; to the End,
that when the Settlement should be made, He might be able to gratify
those of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, who had any Thing of Merit towards him, or
had been least faulty. And if He had observed that Resolution, very much
of the Trouble He underwent afterwards had been prevented: For He would
then, besides that which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had reserved to himself (which was a
vast Tract of Ground), have had all those Forfeitures which the Regicides
had been possessed of, and other criminal Persons; which amounted to a
huge Quantity of the best Land. And though the King had before de∣signed
all those forfeited Lands to his Brother the Duke, yet his Highness<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was so pleased with the Resolution his Majesty had taken, to retain them to
that Purpose, that He forbore to prosecute that Grant, till He heard of
great Quantities of Land every Day granted away by his Majesty to his
Servants and others; whereby He saw the main End would be disap∣pointed.
And then He resolved to be no longer a Loser for the Benefit of
those, who had no Pretence to what They got; and so proceeded in
getting that Grant from the King to himself of those Lands designed
to him.</P>
<P>THE King had swerved from that Rule, before it was scarce discerned:
And the Error of it may be very justly imputed to the Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Improvi∣dence owing to the Earl of</HI> Orrery.</NOTE> and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to none but him; who believing that He could never be well enough at
Court, except He had Courtiers of all Sorts obliged to him, who would
therefore speak well of him in all Places and Companies (and those Arts of
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
his put the King to much Trouble and Loss both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>),
He commended to many of such Friends (though He had advised the
King to the former Resolution) many Suits of that Kind, and sent Certi∣ficates
to them, oftentimes under his own Hand, of the Value those Suits
might be to them if obtained, and of the little Importance the granting of
them would be to his Majesty; which, having been shewed to the King,
disposed him to those Concessions, which otherwise He would not so easily
have made. Then He directed them a Way (being then one of the Lords
Justices) for the more immediate passing those Grants They could obtain,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>without meeting those Obstructions which They had been subject to; for
when any of those Grants had been brought to the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI>
the Chancellor always stopped them, and put his Majesty in Mind of his
former Resolution: But this new Way (in itself lawful enough) kept him
from knowing any of those Transactions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without the Chancellor's Knowledge.</NOTE> which were made by Letters from
the King to the Lords Justices; and thereupon the Grants were prepared
there, and passed under the Great Seal of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was then likewise a new Clause introduced into those Grants, of
a very new Nature; for being grounded always upon Letters out of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and passed under the Seal of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Letters were prepared and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>formed there, and transmitted hither only for his Majesty's Sign Manual: So
that neither the King's learned Council at Law, nor any other his Ministers (the
Secretaries only excepted), had any Notice or the Perusal of any of those
Grants. The Clause was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with an extraordinary Clause insert∣ed in the Grants.</NOTE> “that if any of those Lands so granted by his
Majesty should be otherwise decreed, his Majesty's Grantee should be re∣prised
with other Lands:” So that in many Cases, the greatest Inducement
to his Majesty's Bounty being the Incertainty of his own Right, which the
Person to whom it was granted was obliged to vindicate at his own Charge,
the King was now bound to make it good, if his Grant was not valid. And
so that which was but a contingent Bounty, which commonly was the sole
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Argument for the passing it, was now turned into a real and substantial
Benefit, as a Debt; which created another Difficulty in the Settlement:
Which was yet the more hard, because there were many Claims of the <HI>Irish</HI>
themselves yet unheard, all the false Admeasurements to be examined, and
many other Uncertainties to be determined by the Commissioners; which
left those who were in quiet Possession, as well as those who were out of it,
in the highest Insecurity and Apprehension.</P>
<P>THIS Intricacy and even Despair, which possessed all Kind of People, of
any Settlement, made all of them willing to contribute to any that could
be proposed. They found his Majesty very unwilling to consent to the Re∣peal
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of the Decrees made by the Commissioners; which must have taken
away the Confidence and Assurance of whatsoever was to be done hereafter,
by making Men see, that what was settled by one Act of Parliament might
immediately be unsettled by another: So that there was no Hope by that
Expedient to increase the Number of Acres, which being left might in any
Degree comply with the several Pretences. The <HI>Irish</HI> found, that They
might only be able to obstruct any Settlement, but should never be able to
get such a one as would turn to their own Satisfaction. The Soldiers and
<HI>Adventurers</HI> agreed less amongst themselves: And the Clamour was as great
against those, who by false Admeasurements had gotten more than They
<MILESTONE N="50"/>should have, as from those who had received less than was their Due; and
They who least feared any new Examination could not yet have any secure
Title, before all the rest were settled. In a Word, all Men found that any
Settlement would be better thán none; and that more Profit would arise from
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
a smaller Proportion of Land quietly possessed and husbanded accordingly,
than from a much greater Proportion under a doubtful Title and an Incertainty,
which must dishearten any Industry and Improvement.</P>
<P>UPON these Considerations and Motives, They met amongst themselves,
and debated together by what Expedient They might draw Light out of this
Darkness. There appeared only one Way which administered any reason∣able
Hope; which was, by increasing the Stock for Reprisals to such a De∣gree,
that all Mens Pretences might in some Measurebe provided for: And
there was no other Way to arrive to this, but by every Man's parting with
somewhat which He thought to be his own. And to this They had one<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Encouragement, that was of the highest Prevalence with them, which was,
that this Way an End would be put to the illimited Jurisdiction of the Com∣missioners
(which was very terrible to all of them), who from henceforth
could have little other Power, than to execute what should here be agreed
upon.</P>
<P>IN Conclusion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The different Parties at last agree upon an Expedient for a Settlement.</NOTE> They brought a Proposition to the King, raised and di∣gested
between themselves, “that all Persons, who were to receive any Be∣nefit
by this Act, should abate and give a fourth Part of what They had,
towards the Stock for Reprisals; all which the Commissioners should dis∣tribute
amongst those <HI>Irish,</HI> who should appear most fit for his Majesty's<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Bounty.” And this Agreement was so unanimous, that though it met
with some obstinate Opposition after it was brought before the King, yet
the Number of the Opposers was so small in Respect of the others who
agreed to it, that They grew weary and ashamed of farther Contention.
And thereupon that <HI>Third Act of Settlement,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hereupon the King passes the</HI> Third Act of Settlement.</NOTE> as supplemental to the other
two, was consented to by the King; who, to publish to the World that
Nothing stuck with him which seemed to reflect upon the Commissioners,
resolved to make no Change: And so though two of them, who had Of∣fices
here to discharge, prevailed with his Majesty that They might not return
again into <HI>Ireland;</HI> the other five were continued, to execute what was more<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to be done by this Act, and so to perfect the Settlement. And no Doubt it
will be here said, that this Expedient might have been sooner found, and so
prevented many of those Disorders and Inconveniences which intervened.
But They who knew that Time, and the Perverseness and Obstinacy that
possessed all Pretenders, must confess that the Season was never ripe before:
Nor could their Consent and Agreement, upon which this Act was founded,
ever be obtained before.</P>
<P>THESE were all the Transactions which passed with Reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI>
whilst the Chancellor remained at that Board; in which He acted no
more than any other of the Lords who were present did: Except when any<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Difficulties occurred in their private Meetings and Debates, They sometimes
resorted to him for Advice, which He was ready to give; being always
willing to take any Pains, which might make that very difficult Work
more easy to be brought to a good End. But as He never thought He
deserved any Reward for so doing, so He never expected the Benefit of one
Shilling in Money or in Money's Worth, for any Thing He ever did in that
Affair; and was so far from entertaining any Overture to that Purpose, that
it is notoriously known to many Persons of Honour, who I presume will be
ready to testify the same, that when, upon his Majesty's first Return into
<HI>England,</HI> some Propositions were made to him of receiving the Grant of<MILESTONE N="50"/>
some forfeited Lands, and for the buying other Lands there upon the De∣sire
of the Owners thereof, and at so low a Price that the very Profit of the
Land would in a short Time have paid for the Purchase, and other Over∣tures
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
of immediate Benefit in Money (which others did and lawfully might
accept); He rejected all Propositions of that Kind or relating to it, and de∣clared
publickly and privately, “that He would neither have Lands in <HI>Ire∣land</HI>
nor the least Benefit from thence, till all Differences and Pretences
in that Kingdom should be so fully settled and agreed, that there could
be no more Appeal to the King, or repairing to the King's Council for
Justice; in which,” He said, “He should never be thought so competent
an Adviser, if He had any Title of his own in that Kingdom to bias his
Inclinations.” And He was often heard to say, “that He never took a
<MILESTONE N="10"/>firmer Resolution in any Particular in his Life, than to adhere to that
Conclusion.”<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Vindication of the Chan∣cellor with Regard to the</HI> Irish <HI>Affairs.</HI></NOTE> Yet because it was notorious afterwards, that He did re∣ceive
some Money out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had a lawful Title to receive more
(with which He was reproached when He could not answer for himself);
it may not be amiss in this Place, for his Vindication, to set down parti∣cularly
how that came to pass, and to mention all the Circumstances which
preceded, accompanied or attended, that Affair.</P>
<P>IN the Bills which were first transmitted from <HI>Ireland</HI> after his Majesty's
happy Return, there was an Imposition of a certain Sum of Money upon
some specified Lands in several Provinces, “which was to be paid to his
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Majesty within a limited Time, and to be disposed of by his Majesty to
such Persons who had served him faithfully, and suffered in so doing,” or
Words to that Effect; for He often protested that He never saw the Act of
Parliament, and was most confident that He never heard of it at the Time
when it passed, He being often absent from the Council, by Reason of the
Gout or other Accidents, when such Matters were transacted. But two
Years after the King's Return or thereabout, He received a Letter from the
Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI> “that there would be in his Hands, and in the Earl of <HI>An∣glesey's</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Massaren's</HI>” (who it seems were appointed Treasurers
to receive the Money to be raised by that Act of Parliament), “a good Sum
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of Money for him; which He gave him Notice of, to the End that He might
give Direction for the Disposal thereof, whether He would have it returned
into <HI>England,</HI> or laid out in Land in <HI>Ireland;</HI>” and He wished “that He
would speedily send his Direction, because He was confident that the
Money would be paid in, at least by the Time that his Letter could arrive
there.” No Man can be mone surprised, than the Chancellor was at the
Receipt of this Letter, believing that there was some Mistake in it, and
that his Name might have been used in Trust by Somebody who had given him
no Notice of it. And without returning any Answer to the Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI>
He writ by that Post to the Lord Lieutenant, to inform him of what the Earl
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of <HI>Orrery</HI> had writ to him, and desired him to “inform him by his own En∣quiry,
what the Meaning of it was.”</P>
<P>BEFORE He had an Answer from the Lord Lieutenant, or indeed before his
Letter could come to the Lord Lieutenant's Hands, He received a second
Letter from the Earl of <HI>Orrery;</HI> in which He informed him, “that there was
now paid into his Use, the Sum of twelve thousand six hundred and odd Pounds,
and that there would be the like Sum again received for him at the End of
six Months;” and sent him a particular Direction, “to what Person and
in what Form He was to send his Order for the Payment of the Money.”
The Chancellor still forbore to answer this Letter, till He had received an
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Answer to what He had written to the Lord Lieutenant, who then informed
him at large, what Title He had to that Money, and how He came to have
it: “That shortly after the passing that Act of Parliament, which had given
his Majesty the Disposal of the Money before mentioned, the Earl of <HI>Or∣rery</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
had come to him, the Lord Lieutenant, and putting him in Mind,
how the Chancellor had rejected all Overtures which had been made to
him of Benefit out of that Kingdom” (which Refusal, and many others
that shew how unsolicitous He had always been in the Ways of getting, is
not more known to any Man living than to the Lord Lieutenant), “wished
that He would move the King to confer some Part of that Money upon
the Chancellor; which the Lord Lieutenant very willingly did, and his
Majesty as cheerfully granted: That a Letter was accordingly prepared,
and his Majesty's Royal Signature procured by Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
who was at the same Time commanded by the King not to let him<MILESTONE N="10"/>
know of it; to which Purpose there was likewise a Clause in the Letter,
whereby it was provided that He should have no Notice of it; which,”
the Lord Lieutenant said, “was by his Majesty's Direction or with his Appro∣bation,
because it was said, that if He had Notice of it, He would be so
foolish as to obstruct it himself. And there was a Clause likewise in the
said Letter, which directed the Payment of the said Monies to his Heirs,
Executors or Assigns, if He should die before the Receipt thereof.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor being so fully advertised of all this by the Lord Lieute∣tenant,
and of which till that Time He had not the least Notice or Ima∣gination,
He desired Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> to give him a Copy of that Letter<MILESTONE N="20"/>
(which had been since passed as a Grant to him under the Great Seal of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> according to the Form then used); which the Secretary gave him,
with a large Account of many gracious Circumstances in the King's grant∣ing
it, and the Obligation laid upon him of Secrecy, and the great Caution
that was used that He might have no Notice of it. After He was informed
of all this, He did not think that there was any Thing left for him to do,
but to make his humble Acknowledgment to his Majesty for his Royal
Bounty, and to take Care for the receiving and transmitting the Money;
and doubted not but that He might receive it very honestly. He did there∣fore
wait upon his Majesty with that Duty that became him: And his Ma∣jesty<MILESTONE N="30"/>
was graciously pleased to enlarge his Bounty with those Expressions of
Favour, and of the Satisfaction He had vouchsafed to take himself in con∣ferring
his Donative, that his Joy was much greater from that Grace, than
in the Greatness of the Gift.</P>
<P>AT the very same Time, and the very Day that the Chancellor received
the Letter from the Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> came to him,
and informed him of a Difference that was fallen out between the Lord <HI>Love∣lace</HI>
and Sir <HI>Bulstrode Whitlock,</HI> upon a Defect in the Title to certain Lands
purchased heretofore by Sir <HI>Bulstrode Whitlock</HI> from the Lord <HI>Lovelace,</HI> and
enjoyed by him ever since; but being by the Necessity of that Time, the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Delinquency of <HI>Lovelace</HI> and the Power of <HI>Whitlock,</HI> bought and sold at an
Undervalue, and the Time being now more equal, <HI>Lovelace</HI> resolved to have
more Money, or not to perform a Covenant He had entered into; the Not∣performance
whereof would leave the other's Title very defective. The Earl
desired to reconcile those two, which could not be done without Sale of the
Land: And so He proposed to the Chancellor the buying this Land, which
lay next to some Land He had in <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> This Proposition was made
upon the very Day, as is said before, that He had received the Letter from the
Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> by which it appeared that there was near
as much Money already received for him, as would pay for that Pur∣chase,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
besides what was more to be received within six Months after. The
Land was well known to the Chancellor; so that upon a short Confer∣ence
with the Parties, They all agreed upon the Purchase: And He was
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
easily prevailed with to undertake the Payment of the greatest Part of the
Money upon sealing the Writings, not making the least Doubt, but that
He should by that Time receive the Money from <HI>Ireland;</HI> which was the
sole Ground and Motive to his making that Purchase.</P>
<P>BUT the next Letters He received from <HI>Ireland</HI> informed him, “that
the Necessities of that Kingdom had been such, that They could only
return six thousand Pounds of that Money; and that They had been com∣pelled
to make Use of the rest for the Publick, which would take Care
to repay it to him in a short Time:” And so He found himself engaged in
<MILESTONE N="10"/>a Purchase which He could not retract, upon Presumption of Money which
He could not receive. And He did not only never after receive one Penny of
what was due upon the second Payment (which He so little suspected could
fail, there being an Act of Parliament for the Security, that He assigned it
upon the Marriage of his second Son to him, as the best Part of his Por∣tion);
but the Remainder of the first Sum, which was so borrowed or taken
from him, or any Part of it, was never after paid to him or to his Use: By
which, and the Inconveniences and Damages which ensued to him from
thence, He might reasonably say that He was a Loser, and involved in a
great Debt, by that signal Bounty of his Majesty; and which was afterwards
<MILESTONE N="20"/>made Matter of Reproach to him, and as an Argument of his Corruption.
But this is a very true Account of that Business, and of all the Money that
He ever received from <HI>Ireland,</HI> with all the Circumstances thereof; which,
in the Judgment of all impartial Men, cannot reflect to the Prejudice of his
Integrity and Honour.</P>
<P>AND so We shall no further pursue or again resume any Mention of the
Affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though they will afford a large Field of Matter;
but shall return to the Beginning of the Parliament, from whence We
departed.</P>
<P>IT cannot be expressed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions in Parliament.</NOTE> hardly imagined, with what Alacrity the Parlia∣ment
<MILESTONE N="30"/>entered upon all particular Affairs which might refer to the King's
Honour, Safety or Profit. They pulled up all those Principles of Sedition
and Rebellion by the Roots, which in their own Observation had been the
Ground of or contributed to the odious and infamous Rebellion in the long
Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Prerogative asserted.</NOTE> They declared “that sottish Distinction between the King's
Person and his Office to be Treason; that his Negative Voice could not be
taken from him, and was so essential to the making a Law, that no
Order or Ordinance of either House could be binding to the Subject without
it; that the Militia was inseparably vested in his Majesty, and that it was
High Treason to raise or levy Soldiers without the King's Commission.”
<MILESTONE N="40"/>And because the Licence of speaking seditiously, and of laying scandalous
Imputations and Aspersions upon the Person of the King, as saying <HI>that He
was a Papist,</HI> and such like Terms, to alienate the Affections of the People
from his Majesty, had been the Prologue and principal Ingredient to that
Rebellion, and corrupted the Hearts of his loving Subjects; They declared,
“that the raising any Calumnies of that Kind upon the King, as saying
<HI>that He is a Papist, or popishly affected,</HI> or the like, should be Felony.”
In a Word, They vindicated all his Regalities and Royal Prerogatives, and
provided for the Safety of his Person in as loving and ample a Manner as
He could wish: And towards raising and settling a Revenue proportionable
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to his Dignity and necessary Expense, over and above the Confirmation of
all that had been done or granted in the last Convention, They entered
upon all the Expedients which could occur to them, and were willing to
receive Propositions or Advice from any Body that might contribute there∣unto.
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
In all these publick Matters, no Man could wish a more active Spi∣rit
to be in them, than They were in Truth possessed with.</P>
<P>BUT in that which the King had principally recommended to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment unwil∣ling to con∣firm the</HI> Act of Indemnity.</NOTE> the
Confirmation of the <HI>Act of Oblivion and Indemnity,</HI> They proceeded very
slowly, coldly and unwillingly, notwithstanding the King's frequent Mes∣sages
to them “to dispatch it, though with the Delay of those other Things
which They thought did more immediately concern him.” They had
many Agents and Solicitors in the Court, who thought that all that was
released by that Act might lawfully be distributed amongst them; and since
the King had referred that whole Affair to the Parliament, He might well<MILESTONE N="10"/>
leave it to their Judgments, without his own Interposition. But his Majesty
looked upon himself as under another Obligation both of Honour and Con∣science,
and upon the Thing itself as more for the publick Peace and Secu∣rity,
than any Thing the Parliament could provide instead thereof; and
therefore was very much troubled and offended at the apparent Unwilling∣ness
to pass it. And thereupon He went himself to the House of Peers,
and sent for the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King strenuously urges them to confirm it.</NOTE> and told them, “that it was absolutely neces∣sary
to dispatch that Bill, which He himself had sent to them near two
Months before:” For it was now the eighth of <HI>July.</HI> His Majesty told
them, “that it was to put himself in Mind as well as them, that He so often,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
as often as He came to them, mentioned to them his Declaration from
<HI>Breda.</HI>” And He said, “He should put them in Mind of another De∣claration
published by themselves about that Time, and which He was
persuaded made his the more effectual, an honest, generous and Christian
Declaration, signed by the most eminent Persons, who had been the most
eminent Sufferers; in which They renounced all former Animosities, all
Memory of former Unkindnesses, vowed all imaginable Good-Will and all
Confidence in each other.” All which being pressed with so much In∣stance
by his Majesty prevailed with them: And They then forthwith dis∣patched
that Bill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon They confirm it.</NOTE> and the King as soon confirmed it, and would not stay<MILESTONE N="30"/>
a few Days, till other important Bills should be likewise ready to be presented
to him.</P>
<P>AND there cannot be a greater Instance of their Desire to please his Ma∣jesty
from thenceforth, than that before that Session was concluded, not∣withstanding
the Prejudice the Clergy had brought upon themselves (as I
said before) upon their too much good Husbandry in granting Leases, and
though the Presbyterian Party was not without an Interest in Both Houses
of Parliament; They passed a Bill for the Repeal of that Act of Parliament,
by which the Bishops were excluded from sitting there. It was first pro∣posed
in the House of Commons by a Gentleman, who had been always<MILESTONE N="40"/>
taken to be of a Presbyterian Family: And in that House it found less Op∣position
than was looked for;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons pass a Bill for restoring Bi∣shops to their Seats in Par∣liament.</NOTE> all Men knowing, that besides the Justice
of it, and the Prudence to wipe out the Memory of so infamous an Act, as
the Exclusion of them with all the Circumstances was known to be, it would
be grateful to the King.</P>
<P>BUT when it came into the House of Peers, where all Men expected it
would find a general Concurrence, it met with some Obstruction; which
made a Discovery of an Intrigue, that had not been suspected. For though
there were many Lords present, who had industriously laboured the passing
the former Bill for the Exclusion, yet They had likewise been guilty of<MILESTONE N="50"/>
so many other ill Things, of which They were ashamed, that it was be∣lieved
that They would not willingly revive the Memory of the Whole,
by perserving in such an odious Particular. Nor in Truth did They. But
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
when They saw that it would unavoidably pass (for the Number of that
Party was not considerable), They either gave their Consents, as many of
them did, or gave their Negative without Noise. The Obstruction came
not from thence. The <HI>Catholicks</HI> less owned the Contradiction, nor were
guilty of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which is ob∣structed in the House of Lords by the Earl of</HI> Bristol.</NOTE> though They suffered in it. But the Truth is, it proceeded
from the mercurial Brain of the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who much affected to be
looked upon as the Head of the <HI>Catholicks;</HI> which They did so little desire
that He should be thought, that They very rarely concurred with him.
He well knew that the King desired (which his Majesty never dissembled)
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to give the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> Ease from all the sanguinary Laws; and that
He did not desire that They should be liable to the other Penalties which
the Law had made them subject to, whilst They should in all other Respects
behave themselves like good Subjects. Nor had They since his Majesty's
Return sustained the least Prejudice by their Religion, but enjoyed as much
Liberty at Court and in the Country, as any other Men; and with which
the wisest of them were abundantly satisfied, and did abhor the Activity of
those of their own Party, whom They did believe more like to deprive them
of the Liberty They enjoyed, than to enlarge it to them.</P>
<P>WHEN the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> saw this Bill brought into the House for re∣storing
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Bishops to their Seats, He went to the King, and informed his Ma∣jesty,
“that if this Bill should speedily pass, it would absolutely deprive the
<HI>Catholicks</HI> of all those Graces and Indulgence which He intended to them;
for that the Bishops, when They should sit in the House, whatever their
own Opinions or Inclinations were, would find themselves obliged, that
They might preserve their Reputation with the People, to contradict and
oppose whatsoever should look like Favour or Connivance towards the
<HI>Catholicks:</HI> And therefore, if his Majesty continued his former gracious In∣clination
towards the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> He must put some Stop (even for
the Bishops own Sakes) to the passing that Bill, till the other should be
<MILESTONE N="30"/>more advanced, which He supposed might shortly be done;” there having
been already some Overtures made to that Purpose, and a Committee ap∣pointed
in the House of Lords to take a View of all the sanguinary Laws
in Matters of Religion, and to present them to the House that it might
consider farther of them. The King surprised with the Discourse from a Man
who had often told him the Necessity of the restoring the Bishops, and that
it could not be a perfect Parliament without their Presence, thought his
Reason for the Delay to have Weight in it, and that the Delay for a few
Days could be attended with no Prejudice to the Matter itself; and there∣upon
was willing the Bill should not be called for, and that when it
<MILESTONE N="40"/>should be under Commitment, it should be detained there for some Time;
and that He might, the better to produce this Delay, tell some of his
Friends, “that the King would be well pleased, that there should not be
overmuch Haste in the presenting that Bill for his Royal Assent.”</P>
<P>THIS grew quickly to be taken Notice of in the House, that after the
first Reading of that Bill, it had been put off for a second Reading longer
than was usual, when the House was at so much Leisure; and that now it
was under Commitment, it was obstructed there, notwithstanding all the En∣deavours
some Lords of the Committee could use for the Dispatch; the Bill
containing very few Words, being only for the Repeal of a former Act,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and the Expressions admitting, that is, giving little Cause for any Debate.
The Chancellor desired to know how this came to pass, and was informed
by one of the Lords of the Committee, “that They were assured that the
King would have a Stop put to it, till another Bill should be provided
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
which his Majesty looked for.” Hereupon the Chancellor spake with his
Majesty, who told him all the Conference which the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> had held
with him, and what He had consented should be done. To which the
other replied, “that He was sorry that his Majesty had been prevailed with
to give any Obstruction to a Bill, which every Body knew his Majesty's
Heart was so much set upon for Dispatch; and that if the Reason were
known, it would quickly put an End to all the Pretences of the <HI>Catho∣licks;</HI>
to which his Majesty knew He was no Enemy.” The King pre∣sently
concluded that the Reason was not sufficient, and wished “that the
Bill might be dispatched as soon as was possible, that He might pass it<MILESTONE N="10"/>
that Session;” which He had appointed to make an End of within few
Days: And so the next Day the Report was called for and made, and the
Bill ordered to be engrossed against the next Morning; the Earl not being
at that Time in the House. But the next Morning, when the Chancellor
had the Bill engrossed in his Hand to present to the House to be read the
third Time, the Earl came to him to the Woolsack, and with great Dis∣pleasure
and Wrath in his Countenance told him, “that if that Bill were
read that Day, He would speak against it;” to which the Chancellor
gave him an Answer that did not please him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is at last passed.</NOTE> And the Bill was passed that
Day. And from that Time the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was a more avowed and de∣clared<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Enemy to him, than He had before professed to be; though the
Friendship that had been between them had been discontinued or broken,
from the Time the Earl had changed his Religion.</P>
<P>THE King within few Days came to the Parliament, to give his Royal As∣sent
to those Bills which were prepared for him; and then told them, “that
He did thank them with all his Heart, indeed as much as He could for
any Thing, for the Repeal of that Act which excluded the Bishops from
sitting in Parliament.” He said, “it was an unhappy Act in an unhappy
Time, passed with many unhappy Circumstances, and attended with mi∣serable
Events; and therefore He did again thank them for repealing it:<MILESTONE N="30"/>
And that They had thereby restored Parliaments to their primitive Insti∣tutions.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment adjourn∣ed.</NOTE>
This was upon the thirtieth of <HI>July</HI> 1661, when the Parlia∣ment
was adjourned to the twentieth of <HI>November</HI> following.</P>
<P>BECAUSE We have mentioned the gracious Purposes the King had to his
Roman Catholick Subjects, of which afterwards much Use was made to his
Disservice, to which the Vanity and Presumption of many of that Profession
contributed very much; it may not be unseasonable in this Place to mention
the Ground of that his Majesty's Goodness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The true Ground of the King's Favour to the</HI> Roman Catholicks.</NOTE> and the Reasons why that Pur∣pose
of his was not prosecuted to the Purpose it was intended, after so fair
a Rise towards it, by the Appointment of that Committee in the House of<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Peers, which is remembered above.</P>
<P>IT is not to be wondered at, that the King, at the Age He was of when
the Troubles began in <HI>England,</HI> and when He came out of <HI>England,</HI>
knew very little of the Laws which had been long since made and were
still in Force against <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and less of the Grounds and Mo∣tives
which had introduced those Laws. And from the Time that He was
first beyond the Seas, He could not be without hearing very much spoken
against the Protestant Religion, and more for extolling and magnify∣ing
the Religion of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> neither of which Discourses
made any Impression upon him. After the Defeat at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and his<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Escape from thence into <HI>France,</HI> the Queen his Mother (who had very
punctually complied with the King her Husband's Injunctions, in not suf∣fering
any Body to endeavour to pervert the Prince her Son in his Religion,
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
and when He came afterwards into <HI>France</HI> after He was King, continued the
same Reservation) used much more Sharpness in her Discourse against the
<HI>Protestants,</HI> than She had been accustomed to. The Liberty that his Ma∣jesty
formerly had in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> to have a Place set aside for the Exercise
of his Religion, was taken away: And continual Discourses were made by
the Queen in his Presence, “that He had now no Hope ever to be restored
to his Dominions, but by the Help of the <HI>Catholicks;</HI> and therefore that
He must apply himself to them in such a Way, as might induce them to
help him.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>ABOUT this Time there was a short Collection and Abridgment made of
all the penal Laws, which had been made and which were still in Force in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
against the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> “that all Priests for saying Mass were to
be put to Death;” the great Penalties which They were to undergo, who
entertained or harboured a Priest in their House, or were present at Mass,
and the like; with all other envious Clauses, which were in any Acts of
Parliament, that had been enacted upon several Treasons and Conspiracies
of the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King
<HI>James.</HI> And this Collection They caused to be translated into <HI>French</HI>
and into <HI>Latin,</HI> and scattered it abroad in all Places; after They had caused
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Copies of it to be presented to the Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> and to the
Cardinal: So that the King came into no Place where those Papers were
not shewed to him, and where He was not seriously asked, “whether it
was a true Collection of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI>” and “whether it was
possible, that any Christian Kingdom could exercise so much Tyranny
against the Catholick Religion.” The King, who had never heard of these
Particulars, did really believe that the Paper was forged, and answered, “He
did not believe that there were such Laws:” And when He came to his
Lodgings, He gave the Chancellor the Paper, and bade him read it, and
tell him “whether such Laws were in Force in <HI>England.</HI>” He had heard
<MILESTONE N="30"/>before of the scattering of those Papers, and knew well who had made the
Collection; who had been a Lawyer, and was a <HI>Protestant,</HI> but had too
good an Opinion of the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and desired too much to be
grateful to them.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor found an Opportunity the next Day to enlarge upon
the Paper to his Majesty, and informed him of “the Seasons in which, and
the Occasions and Provocations upon which, those Laws had been made;
of the frequent Treasons and Conspiracies which had been entered into by
some <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> always with the Privity and Approbation of their
Priests and Confessors, against the Person and Life of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and after her Death, of the infamous and detestable Gunpowder Treason
to have destroyed King <HI>James</HI> and his Posterity, with the whole Nobility
of the Kingdom: So that in those Times, the Pope having excommuni∣cated
the whole Kingdom, and absolved the Subjects from all their Oaths
of Fidelity, there seemed no Expedient to preserve the Crown, but the
using these Severities against those who were professed Enemies to it.
But that since those Times, that the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> had lived quietly,
that Rigour had not been used: And that the King his Father's Clemency
towards those of that Profession (which Clemency extended no farther
than the dispensing with the utmost Rigour of the Laws), was the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Ground of the Scandal of his being popishly affected, that contributed
as much to his Ruin, as any particular Malice in the worst of his
Enemies.”</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="149"/>
THE King hearkened attentively to all that was said, and then answered,
“that He could not doubt but there was some very extraordinary Reason
for the making such strange Laws: But whatever the Reason then was,
that it was at present and for many Years past very evident, that there
was no such Malignity in the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> that should continue that
heavy Yoke upon their Necks. That He knew well enough, that if He
were in <HI>England,</HI> He had not in himself the Power to repeal any Act of
Parliament, without the Consent of Parliament: But that He knew no
Reason why He might not profess, that He did not like those Laws which
caused Men to be put to Death for their Religion; and that He would<MILESTONE N="10"/>
do his best, if ever God restored him to his Kingdom, that those bloody
Laws might be repealed. And that if there were no other Reason of State
than He could yet comprehend, against the taking away the other Penal∣ties,
He should be glad that all those Distinctions between his Subjects
might be removed; and that whilst They were all equally good Subjects,
They might equally enjoy his Protection.” And his Majesty did fre∣quently,
when He was in the Courts of Catholick Princes, and when He
was sure to hear the Sharpness of the Laws in <HI>England</HI> inveighed against,
enlarge upon the same Discourse: And it had been a very unseasonable
Presumption in any Man, who would have endeavoured to have dissuaded<MILESTONE N="20"/>
him from entertaining that Candour in his Heart.</P>
<P>WITH this gracious Disposition his Majesty returned into <HI>England;</HI> and
received his Catholick Subjects with the same Grace and Frankness, that
He did his other: And They took all Opportunities to extol their own
Sufferings, which They would have understood to have been for him. And
some very noble Persons there were, who had served his Father very wor∣thily
in the War, and suffered as largely afterwards for having done so:
But the Number of those was not great, but much greater than of those
who shewed any Affection to him or for him, during the Time of his Ab∣sence,
and the Government of the Usurper. Yet some few there were, even<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of those who had suffered most for his Father, who did send him Supply
when He was abroad, though They were hardly able to provide Necessaries
for themselves: And in his Escape from <HI>Worcester,</HI> He received extraordi∣nary
Benefit, by the Fidelity of many poor People of that Religion; which
his Majesty was never reserved in the Remembrance of. And this gracious
Disposition in him did not then appear ingrateful to any. And then, upon
an Address made to the House of Peers in the Name of the <HI>Roman Catho∣licks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Committee of the Lords for rel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xing the penal Laws against the</HI> Roman Ca∣tholicks.</NOTE>
for some Relaxation of those Laws which were still in Force against
them, the House of Peers appointed that Committee which is mentioned
before, to examine and report all those penal Statutes, which reached to the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
taking away the Life of any <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> Priest or Layman, for his
Religion; there not appearing one Lord in the House, who seemed to be
unwilling that those Laws should be repealed. And after that Committee
was appointed, the Roman Catholick Lords and their Friends for some
Days diligently attended it, and made their Observations upon several Acts
of Parliament, in which They desired Ease. But on a sudden this Com∣mittee
was discontinued, and never after revived; the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI>
never afterwards being solicitous for it.</P>
<P>THE Argument was now to be debated amongst themselves, that They
might agree what would please them:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Roman Catholicks <HI>dis agree amongst themselves</HI></NOTE> And then there quickly appeared that<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Discord and Animosity between them, that never was nor ever will be
extinguished; and of which the State might make much other Use than
it hath done. The Lords and Men of Estates were not satisfied, in that
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
They observed the Good-Nature of the House did not appear to extend
farther, than the abolishing those Laws which concerned the Lives of the
Priests, which did not much affect them: For besides that those Specta∣cles
were no longer grateful to the People, They were confident that They
should not be without Men to discharge those Functions; and the Number
of such was more grievous to them than the Scarcity. That which They de∣sired
was, the Removal of those Laws, which being let loose would de∣prive
them of so much of their Estates, that the Remainder would not pre∣serve
them from Poverty. This Indulgence would indeed be grateful to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>them; for the other They cared not. Nor were the Ecclesiasticks at all
pleased with what was proposed for their Advantage, but looked upon
themselves as deprived of the Honour of Martyrdom by this Remission,
that They might undergo Restraints, which would be more grievous than
Death itself: And They were very apprehensive, that there would remain
some Order of them excluded, as there was even a most universal Prejudice
against the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> or that there would be some Limitation of their Num∣bers,
which They well knew the <HI>Catholicks</HI> in general would be very glad of,
though They could not appear to desire it.</P>
<P>THERE was a Committee chosen amongst them of the Superiours of all
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Orders, and of the secular Clergy, that sate at <HI>Arundel-House,</HI> and consulted
together with some of the principal Lords and others of the prime Quality
of that Religion, what They should say or do in such and such Cases which
probably might fall out. They all concluded, at least apprehended, that They
should never be dispensed with in Respect of the Oaths, which were enjoined
to be taken by all Men, without their submitting to take some other Oath,
that might be an equal Security of and for their Fidelity to the King, and
the Preservation of the Peace of the Kingdom. And there had been lately scat∣tered
abroad some printed Papers, written by some Regular and Secular
Clergy, with sober Propositions to that Purpose, and even the Form of an
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Oath and Subscription to be taken or made by all <HI>Catholicks;</HI> in which there
was an absolute Renunciation or Declaration against the temporal Authority
of the Pope, which, in all common Discourses amongst the <HI>Protestants,</HI> all
<HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> made no Scruple to renounce and disclaim: But it coming
now to be the Subject-Matter of the Debate in this Committee, the <HI>Jesuits.</HI>
declared with much Warmth, “that They ought not, nor could They with a
good Conscience as <HI>Catholicks,</HI> deprive the Pope of his temporal Authority,
which He hath in all Kingdoms granted to him by God himself,” with very
much to that Purpose; with which most of the temporal Lords, and very
many of the Seculars and Regulars, were so much scandalized, that the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Committee being broken up for that Time, They never attended it again;
the wiser and the more conscientious Men discerning, that there was a Spirit
in the rest that was raised and governed by a Passion, of which They could
not comprehend the Ground. And the Truth is, the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and They
who adhered to them, had entertained great Hopes from the King's too
much Grace to them, and from the great Liberty They enjoyed; and
promised themselves and their Friends another Kind of Indulgence, than
They saw was intended to them by the House of Peers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which the Committee is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> And this was the
Reason that that Committee was no more looked after, nor any publick
Address was any farther prosecuted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>AND from this Time there every Day appeared so much Insolence and
Indiscretion amongst the imprudent <HI>Catholicks,</HI> that They brought so many
Scandals upon his Majesty, and kindled so much Jealousy in the Parlia∣ment,
that there grew a general Aversion towards them. And the King's
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
Party remembered, with what Wariness and Disregard the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI>
had lived towards them in the whole Time of the Usurpation; and how
little Sorrow They made Show of upon the horrid Murder of the King
(which was then exceedingly taken Notice of): And They who had been
abroad with the King remembered, that his Majesty had received less Re∣gard
and Respect from his Catholick Subjects, wherever He found them
abroad, than from any foreign <HI>Catholicks;</HI> who always received him
with all imaginable Duty, whilst his own looked as if They had no De∣pendance
upon him. And so We return to the Parliament after its Ad∣journment.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment meets again.</NOTE> that had been adjourned upon the thirtieth of <HI>July,</HI>
met again upon the twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> with the same Zeal and Affec∣tion
to advance the King's Service. And the King himself came to them
upon the same Day They met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech.</NOTE> and told them, “that He knew that Visit
was not of Course; yet if there were no more in it, it would not be
strange, that He came to see what He and They had so long desired to
see, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of <HI>England,</HI>
met together to consult for the Peace and Safety of the Church and
State, by which Parliaments were restored to their primitive Lustre
and Integrity:” His Majesty said, “He did heartily congratulate with<MILESTONE N="20"/>
them for that Day.” But He told them withal, “that He came thither
upon another Occasion; which was to say somewhat to them on his own
Behalf, to ask somewhat of them for himself, which was more than He
had done of them, or of those who met before them, since his Coming
into <HI>England.</HI> Nor did He think, that what He had to say to them did
alone, or did most concern himself: If the uneasy Condition He was in,
if the Streights and Necessities He was to struggle with, did not manifestly
relate to the publick Peace and Safety, more than to his own Particular,
otherwise than as He was concerned in the Publick, He would not give
them that Trouble that Day; He could bear his Necessities which merely<MILESTONE N="30"/>
related to himself, with Patience enough.”</P>
<P>HE told them, “that He did not importune them to make more Haste
in the settling the constant Revenue of the Crown, than was agreeable to
the Method They had proposed to themselves, nor to consider the insup∣portable
Weight that lay upon it, the Obligations it lay under to provide
for the Interest, Honour and Security of the Nation, in another Pro∣portion
than in any former Times it had been obliged to: His Majesty
well knew, that They had very affectionately and worthily taken all that
into their Thoughts, and would proceed in it with Expedition: But that
He came to put them in Mind of the crying Debts which did every Day<MILESTONE N="40"/>
call upon him, of some necessary Provisions, which were to be made
without Delay for the very Safety of the Kingdom, of the great Sum of
Money that should be ready to discharge the several Fleets when they
came Home, and for the necessary Preparations that were to be made for
the setting out new Fleets to Sea against the next Spring. These were the
pressing Occasions which He was forced to recommend to them with all
possible Earnestness, and He did conjure them to provide for as speedily as
was possible, and in such a Manner as might give them Security at Home,
and some Reputation abroad.” His Majesty said, “that He made this
Discourse to them with some Confidence, because He was very willing<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and desirous that They should thoroughly examine, whether those Ne∣cessities
which He mentioned were real or imaginary, or whether they
were fallen upon him by his own Fault, his own ill Managery, or Ex∣cesses,
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
and provide for them accordingly. He was very willing that They
should make a full Inspection into his Revenue, as well the Disbursements
as Receipts; and if They should find that it had been ill managed by
any Corruptions in the Officers He trusted, or by his own Unthriftiness,
He should take the Advice and Information They should give him very
kindly.”</P>
<P>HE told them, “that He was very sorry that the general Temper and Af∣fections
of the Nation were not so well composed, as He hoped they would
have been, after so signal Blessings from God Almighty upon them all,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and after so great Indulgence and Condescensions from him towards all
Interests. But that there were many wicked Instruments still as active as
ever, who laboured Night and Day to disturb the publick Peace, and to
make all People jealous of each other: It would be worthy their Care
and Vigilance to provide proper Remedies for the Diseases of that Kind;
and if They should find new Diseases, They must study new Remedies.
For those Difficulties which concerned Matters in Religion,” his Majesty
confessed to them, “that they were too hard for him; and therefore He
did recommend them to their Care and Discretion, which could best pro∣vide
for them.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE two Houses were abundantly pleased with all that his Majesty had
said to them, and immediately betook them to the Consideration of those
Particulars, which He had principally recommended to them. And though
for the present They looked upon that Clause of his Majesty's Speech,
wherein He referred to them to make an Inspection into his Revenue and
his Expenses, but as a generous and princely Condescension, which would
not become them to make Use of (nor indeed had They at that Time the
least Prejudice to or Jealousy of any, who were of the nearest Trust about
his Majesty); yet four Years after, when the Expenses had grown to be
much greater, and it may be all Disbursements not so warrantable, and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>when the Factions in Court and Parliament were at a great Height, and
Men made Use of publick Pretences to satisfy their private Animosities and
Malice, They made Use of that frank Offer of his Majesty, to entitle them∣selves
to make Inquisition into publick and private Receipts and Disburse∣ments,
in a very extraordinary Manner never practised before.</P>
<P>LET no Man wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reason why the King's Debts were so great.</NOTE> that within so little Time as a Year and a Half
or very little more after the King's Return, that is, from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>November</HI>
in the next Year, and after so great Sums of Money raised by Acts of Par∣liament
upon the People, his Majesty's Debts could be so crying and im∣portunate,
as to disturb him to that Degree as He expressed. It was never
<MILESTONE N="40"/>enough understood, that in all that Time He never received from the Par∣liament
more than the seventy thousand Pounds towards his Coronation;
nor were the Debts which were now so grievous to him contracted by him∣self
(though it cannot be supposed but that He had contracted Debts him∣self
in that Time): All the Money that had been given and raised had been
applied to the Payment of the Land and Sea Forces, and had done neither.
Parliaments do seldom make their Computations right, but reckon what
They give to be much more than is ever received, and what They are
to pay to be as much less than in Truth They owe; so that when all
the Money that was collected was paid, there remained still very much
<MILESTONE N="50"/>due to the Soldiers, and much more to the Seamen: And the Clamour
from Both reached the King's Ears, as if They had been levied by his
Warrant and for his Service. And his Majesty understood too well, by
the Experience of the ill Husbandry of the last Year, when both the
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
Army and the Ships were so long continued in Pay, for Want of Money to
disband and pay them off, what the Trouble and Charge would be, if the
several Fleets should return before Money was provided to discharge the
Seamen; and for that the Clamour would be only upon him.</P>
<P>BUT there was an Expense that He had been engaged in from the Time
of his Return, and by which He had contracted a great Debt, of which
very few Men could take Notice; nor could the King think fit to discover
it, till He had first provided against the Mischief which might have at∣tended
the Discovery. It will hardly be believed, that in so warlike an Age,
and when the Armies and Fleets of <HI>England</HI> had made more Noise in the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
World for twenty Years, had fought more Battles at Land and Sea, than
all the World had done besides, or any one People had done in any Age
before; and when at his Majesty's Return there remained a hundred Ships
at Sea, and an Army of near threescore thousand Men at Land; there
should not be in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and in all the Stores belonging to
the Crown, Fire-Arms enough, nor indeed of any other Kind, to arm
three thousand Men; nor Powder and naval Provisions enough to set out
five Ships of War.</P>
<P>FROM the Death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> no Care had been taken for Supplies of
any of the Stores. And the Changes which ensued in the Government, and<MILESTONE N="20"/>
putting out and in new Officers; the Expeditions of <HI>Lambert</HI> against Sir
<HI>George Booth,</HI> and afterwards into the <HI>North;</HI> and other Preparations for
those Factions and Parties which succeeded each other; and the continual
Opportunities which the Officers had for Embezzlement; and lastly, the
setting out that Fleet which was sent to attend upon the King for his Re∣turn;
had so totally drained the Stores of all Kinds, that the Magazines
were no better replenished than is mentioned before: Which as soon as his
Majesty knew, as He could not be long ignorant of it, the first Care He
took was to conceal it, that it might not be known abroad or at Home, in
how ill a Posture He was to defend himself against an Enemy. And then<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He committed the Care of that Province to a noble Person, whom He
knew He could not trust too much, and made Sir <HI>William Compton</HI> Master
of the Ordnance, and made all the Shifts He could devise for Monies, that
the Work might be begun. And hereby insensibly He had contracted a
great Debt: And these were Part of the crying Debts, and the necessary
Provisions which were to be made without Delay for the very Safety of the
Kingdom, which He told the Parliament. And in this He had laboured
so effectually, that at the Time when the first <HI>Dutch</HI> War was entered into,
all the Stores were more completely supplied and provided for, and the
Ships and all naval Provisions in greater Strength and Plenty, than they<MILESTONE N="40"/>
had ever been in the Reign of any former King, or in the Time of the
Usurper himself.</P>
<P>THAT Part of the King's Speech, of the Distempers in the Nation by the
Differences in Religion, which He confessed were too hard for him, and
recommended the composing them to their Care and Deliberation, gives me
a seasonable Opportunity to enter upon the Relation, how that Affair stood
at that Time, and how far the Distractions of those several Factions were
from being reconciled, though Episcopacy seemed to be fully restored, and
the Bishops to their Votes in Parliament; which had been looked upon as
the most sovereign Remedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Revisal of the</HI> Litur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> to cure, reform or extinguish all those Mala∣dies.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
The Bishops had spent the Vacation in making such Alterations in
the <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI> as They thought would make it more grateful
to the <HI>dissenting Brethren,</HI> for so the schismatical Party called themselves;
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
and such Additions, as in their Judgments the Temper of the present Time
and the past Miscarriages required. It was necessarily to be presented to the
Convocation, which is the national Synod of the Church; and that did not
sit during the Recess of the Parliament, and so came not together till the
End of <HI>November:</HI> Where the Consideration of it took up much Time;
all Men offering such Alterations and Additions, as were suitable to their
own Fancies, and the Observations which They had made in the Time of
Confusion.</P>
<P>THE Bishops were not all of one Mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some of the Bishops are against all Al∣terations in the</HI> Liturgy.</NOTE> Some of them, who had greatest
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Experience and were in Truth wise Men, thought it best “to restore and
confirm the old <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI> without any Alterations and Ad∣ditions;
and that it would be the best Vindication the <HI>Liturgy</HI> and Go∣vernment
of the Church could receive, that after so many Scandals and
Reproaches cast upon Both, and after a bloody Rebellion and a War of
twenty Years raised, as was pretended, principally against Both, and which
had prevailed and triumphed in the total Suppression and Destruction of
Both, they should now be restored to be in all Respects the same they
had been before. Whereas any Alterations and Additions (besides the Ad∣vantage
it might give to the common Adversary, the <HI>Papist,</HI> who would
<MILESTONE N="20"/>be apt to say that We had reformed and changed our Religion again),
would raise new Scruples in the factious and schismatical Party, that was
ashamed of all the old Arguments, which had so often been answered, and
stood at present exploded in the Judgment of all sober Men; but would
recover new Spirits to make new Objections, and complain that the Al∣terations
and Additions are more grievous and burdensome to the Li∣berty
of their Conscience, than those of which They had formerly com∣plained.”</P>
<P>OTHERS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Others of them press earnestly for some.</NOTE> equally grave, of great Learning and unblemished Reputation,
pressed earnestly both for the Alterations and Additions; said, “that it was
<MILESTONE N="30"/>a common Reproach upon the Government of the Church, that it would
not depart from the least unnecessary Expression or Word, nor explain
the most insignificant Ceremony; which would quiet or remove the
Doubts and Jealousies of many conscientious Men, that they did in Truth
signify somewhat that was not intended: And therefore since some pow∣erful
Men of that troublesome Party had made it their earnest Request,
that some such Alterations and Additions might be made, and professed
that it would give great Satisfaction to many very good Men; it would
be great Pity, now there was a fit Opportunity for it, which had not been
in former Times of Clamour, not to gratify them in those small Particu∣lars,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>which did not make any important Difference from what was before.”
It may be there were some, who believed that the Victory and Triumph of
the Church would be with the more Lustre, if somewhat were inserted,
that might be understood to reflect upon the rude and rebellious Beha∣viour
of the late Times, which had been regulated and conducted by that
Clergy: And so both Additions and Alterations were made.</P>
<P>BUT the Truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The former Opinion the more prudent.</NOTE> what Show of Reason soever and Appearance of Cha∣rity
the latter Opinion seemed to carry with it, the former Advice was the
more prudent, and would have prevented many Inconveniences which en∣sued.
Whatever had been pretended or desired, the Alterations which were
<MILESTONE N="50"/>made to please them did not reduce one of them to the Obedience of the
Church; and the Additions raised the Clamour higher than it had been.
And when it was evident that They should not be left longer without a Li∣turgy,
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
They cried aloud for the same They had before, though They had
inveighed against it for near a hundred Years together.</P>
<P>IT is an unhappy Policy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The unhappy Policy of making Con∣cessions to the</HI> Dissenters.</NOTE> and always unhappily applied, to imagine that
that <HI>Classis</HI> of Men can be recovered and reconciled by partial Concessions,
or granting less than They demand. And if all were granted, They would
have more to ask, somewhat as a Security for the Enjoyment of what is
granted, that shall preserve their Power, and shake the whole Frame of
the Government. Their Faction is their Religion: Nor are those Combi∣nations
ever entered into upon real and substantial Motives of Conscience
how erroneous soever, but consist of many glutinous Materials, of Will,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and Humour, and Folly, and Knavery, and Ambition, and Malice, which
make Men cling inseparably together, till They have Satisfaction in all
their Pretences, or till They are absolutely broken and subdued, which may
always be more easily done than the other. And if some few, how signal
soever (which often deceives us), are separated and divided from the Herd
upon reasonable Overtures, and secret Rewards which make the Overtures
look the more reasonable; They are but so many single Men, and have no
more Credit and Authority (whatever They have had) with their Compa∣nions,
than if They had never known them, rather less; being less mad
than They were makes them thought to be less fit to be believed. And<MILESTONE N="20"/>
They, whom You think You have recovered, carry always a Chagrin about
them, which makes them good for Nothing, but for Instances to divert you
from any more of that Kind of Traffick.</P>
<P>AND it is very strange, that the Clergy did not at this Time remember
what had so lately befallen the poor Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Trans∣mission
of their <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which had been composed with this very Prospect
that now dazzled their Eyes. “To receive a Liturgy from <HI>England</HI> was
below the Dignity of that Nation, which were governed by their own
Laws, without Dependance upon any other. Besides there were many
Errors in that Liturgy that They could never submit to, and some De∣fects<MILESTONE N="30"/>
which ought to be supplied; and if such a one should be compiled,
in which all those Exceptions, which were well enough known, might be
provided for, They would gladly receive it.” All this was carefully per∣formed;
and what Reception it had afterwards is too well known, and will
ever be remembered by the Scars which still remain from those Wounds.
And then the great Objection that was most impudently urged was, “that
it differed from the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which They were
ready to have received, and would have declared to the World, that the
two Nations had but one Religion; whereas the Book sent to them would
have manifested the contrary, and was the Product of a few particular Men,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to whose Spirit and Humour They would not sacrifice their native Liberty
of Conscience.”</P>
<P>THEY of the same Fraternity in <HI>England</HI> at this present governed them∣selves
by the same Method,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>None of the</HI> Dissenters <HI>gained by the Concessions now made.</HI></NOTE> though, God be thanked, not yet with the
same Success. And there is great Reason to believe, that the very Men,
who laboured so much for the Alterations which were made, and professed
to receive so much Satisfaction in them, did it for no other End, but to
procure more Opportunity to continue and enlarge the Contentions; and to
gain Excuse and Credit to the ill Things They had done, by the Redress
and Reparation that was given them in the Amendment of many Particu∣lars,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
against which They had always complained. There was not one of
them who had used that Importunity and made that Profession, who af∣terwards
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
was conformable to the Government of the Church, or frequented
those Churches where or when the <HI>Liturgy</HI> was used.</P>
<P>WHILST the Clergy was busy and solicitous to prepare this Remedy for
the present Distempers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The factious Preachers as∣sume much Li∣cense.</NOTE> the People of all the several Factions in Religion as∣sumed
more License than ever They had done. The <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in all
their Pulpits inveighed against the <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> that They expected,
and took the same Liberty to inveigh against the Government of the Church,
as They had been accustomed to before the Return of the King; with Reflections
upon the Persons of the Bishops, as if They assumed a Jurisdiction that was
<MILESTONE N="10"/>yet at least suspended. And the other Factions in Religion, as if by Con∣cert,
took the same Liberty in their several Congregations. The <HI>Anabap∣tists</HI>
and the <HI>Quakers</HI> made more Noise than ever, and assembled together
in greater Numbers, and talked what Reformations They expected in all
Particulars. These Insolencies offended the Parliament very much: And
the House of Commons expressed much Impatience, that the <HI>Liturgy</HI> was
so long in Preparation, that the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> might without Delay be
passed and published; not without some Insinuations and Reflections, that
his Majesty's Candour, and Admission of all Persons to resort to his Presence,
and his Condescension to confer with them, had raised their Spirits to an
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Insolence insupportable; and that Nothing could reduce them to the Tem∣per
of good Subjects, but the highest Severity.</P>
<P>IT is very true, from the Time of his Majesty's Coming into <HI>England,</HI>
He had not been reserved in the Admission of those who had been his
greatest Enemies, to his Presence. The Presbyterian Ministers He received
with Grace; and did believe that He should work upon them by Persuasions,
having been well acquainted with their common Arguments by the Con∣versation
He had had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was very able to confute them. The
<HI>Independents</HI> had as free Access, both that He might hinder any Conjunc∣tion
between the other Factions, and because They seemed wholly to depend
<MILESTONE N="30"/>upon his Majesty's Will and Pleasure, without resorting to the Parliament,
in which They had no Confidence; and had rather that Episcopacy should
flourish again, than that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> should govern. The King had
always admitted the <HI>Quakers</HI> for his Divertisement and Mirth, because He
thought, that of all the Factions They were the most innocent, and had
least of Malice in their Natures against his Person and his Government:
And it was now too late, though He had a worse Opinion of them all, to re∣strain
them from coming to him, till there should be some Law made to punish
them; and therefore He still called upon the Bishops, to cause the <HI>Liturgy</HI>
to be expedited in the Convocation. And finding that those Distempers
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had that Influence upon the House of Commons, that the Displeasure and
Jealousy which They conceived from thence did retard their Counsels, and
made them less solicitous to advance his Service in the settling his Revenue,
They having sate near three Months after their coming together again upon
their Adjournment, without making any considerable Progress in it; He
sent for the Speaker and the House of Commons to attend him at <HI>White∣hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends for the House of Commons to attend him at</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE>
where He spake unto them, though very graciously, in a Style that
seemed to have more of Expostulation and Reprehension than They had
been accustomed to.</P>
<P>HE said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Speech to them.</NOTE> “He spake his Heart to them when He told them, that He
<MILESTONE N="50"/>did believe, that from the first Institution of Parliaments to that Hour,
there had never been a House of Commons fuller of Affection and Duty
to their King, than They were to him; never any that was more de∣sirous
and solicitous to gratify their King, than They were to oblige him;
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
never a House of Commons, in which there were fewer Persons without
a full Measure of Zeal for the Honour and Welfare of the King and
Country, than there are in this: In a Word,” He said, “He knew most
of their Persons and Names, and could never hope to find better Men in
their Places. Yet after all this He could not but lament and even complain,
that He and They and the Kingdom were yet without that present Fruit and
Advantage, which They might reasonably promise themselves from such a
Harmony of Affections, and Unity in Resolutions to advance the publick Ser∣vice,
and to provide for the Peace and Security of the Kingdom; that They
did not expedite those good Counsels, which were most necessary for Both.<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He knew not how it came to pass, but for many Weeks past, even since their
last Adjournment, private and particular Business had almost thrust the
Consideration of the publick out of Doors; and He did not know that
They were nearer the settling his Revenue, than They had been at <HI>Christ∣mas.</HI>
He was sure He had communicated his Condition to them without
Reserve; what He had coming in, and what his necessary Disbursements
were. And” He said “He was exceedingly deceived, if whatever They
gave him were any otherwise given to him, than to be issued out for
their own Use and Benefit; and if They considered it well, They would
find that They were the richer by what They gave, since it was all to be<MILESTONE N="20"/>
laid out that They might enjoy the rest in Peace and Security.”</P>
<P>HE said, “He need not put them in Mind of the miserable Effects, that
had attended the Wants and Necessities of the Crown; that He needed
not to tell them, that there was a Republican Party still in the Kingdom,
which had the Courage still to promise themselves another Revolution:
And He thought He had as little Need to tell them, that the only Way,
with God's Blessing, to disappoint their Hopes, and indeed to reduce
them from those extravagant Hopes and Desires, was, to let them see
that They had so provided for the Crown, that it had wherewithal to sup∣port
itself, and to secure his People; which He was sure was all He de∣sired,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and desired only for their Preservation. Therefore He conjured
them by all the Professions of Affection which They had made to him,
by all the Kindness which He knew They had for him, that They would,
after all their Deliberations, betake themselves to some speedy Resolutions,
and settle such a real and substantial Revenue upon him, as might hold
some Proportion with the necessary Expenses He was at for the Peace and
Benefit and Honour of the Kingdom; that They who looked for Trou∣bles
at Home might despair of their Wishes; and that our Neighbours
abroad, by seeing that all is well at Home, might have that Esteem and
Value of his Majesty, as might secure the Honour and Interest of the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Nation, and make the Happiness of the Kingdom and of that City once
more the Admiration and Envy of the World.”</P>
<P>HE told them, “that He heard that They were very zealous for the
Church, and very solicitous and even jealous that there was not Expedi∣tion
enough used in that Affair: He thanked them for it, since He pre∣sumed
that it proceeded from a good Root of Piety and Devotion. But”
He said “that He must tell them, that He had the worst Luck in the
World, if after all the Reproaches of being a <HI>Papist</HI> while He was abroad,
He was suspected to be a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> now He was come Home. He knew
They would not take it unkindly, if He told them, that He was as<MILESTONE N="50"/>
zealous for the Church of <HI>England</HI> as any of them could be, and was
enough acquainted with the Enemies of it on all Sides; that He was as
much in Love with the <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> as They could wish, and
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
had Prejudice enough to those who did not love it, who He hoped
in Time would be better informed, and so change their Minds; and
They might be confident, He did as much desire to have an Uniformity
settled, as any Man amongst them. He prayed them to trust him in
that Affair, and promised them to hasten the Dispatch of it with all con∣venient
Speed; They might rely upon him in it.” He said, “He had
transmitted the <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI> with those Alterations and Ad∣ditions
which had been presented to him by the Convocation, to the
House of Peers with his Approbation, that the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> might
<MILESTONE N="10"/>relate to it; so that He presumed that it would shortly be dispatched
there: And that when They had done all They could,” He said, “the
well settling that Affair would require great Prudence and Discretion, and
the Absence of all Passion and Precipitation.”</P>
<P>HIS Majesty concluded with assuring them, “that He did promise him∣self
great Fruits from that Conversation He had with them, and that
They would justify the Confidence He had in their Affections, by letting
the World see, that They took his Concernments to Heart, and were
ready to do whatsoever He desired for the Peace and Welfare of the
Kingdom.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>WHEN the <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Liturgy <HI>presented to the House of Lords with the King's Confir∣mation.</HI></NOTE> by the King's Command, pre∣sented
to the House of Lords by the two Archbishops (for it had been ap∣proved
by the Convocation of the Province of <HI>York,</HI> as well as by that of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>)
confirmed by his Majesty under the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> the
Book itself took up no Debate: Only the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> pro∣posed,
“that the old <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> might be confirmed with∣out
any Alteration or Addition, and then the same <HI>Act of Uniformity,</HI>
that had been in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> would be likewise ap∣plied
to it; whereas a new Act of Uniformity might take up much
Time and raise much Debate, all which would be avoided by adhering
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to the old.”</P>
<P>WHATEVER that Lord's Opinion was, He was known to be of the Presby∣terian
Party. And it was answered, “that if that Proposition had been heartily
made when the King came into <HI>England,</HI> it would have met with a ge∣neral
Approbation, and prevented much Sharpness and Animosity, which
had since risen by those who opposed that excellent Form. But after the
Clergy had so bitterly inveighed against many Parts thereof, and prevailed
with his Majesty to suspend the Use of it till it might be revised, as by
his Declaration of the five and twentieth of <HI>October</HI> He had done, and
thereupon had granted his Commission under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to several Bishops and other Divines, to review the <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI>
and to prepare such Alterations and Additions as They thought fit to offer;
and that afterwards his Majesty had been pleased to authorize the Convo∣cations
of Both the Provinces of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> called and assem∣bled
by his Majesty's Authority, to review the said <HI>Book of Prayer,</HI> and
the <HI>Book of the Form and Manner of the making and consecrating of Bi∣shops,
Priests and Deacons;</HI> and that now after the Bishops and Clergy of
Both Provinces had, upon great Deliberation and upon reviewing those
Books, prepared and consented to some Alterations, and to the Addition
of several Prayers to be used upon emergent Occasions, all which his Ma∣jesty
<MILESTONE N="50"/>had already ratified and confirmed: It could not but be understood
Matter of great Levity and Offence, to reject this Book, that was now
with all this Ceremony and Solemnity presented, for no other Reason but
because They liked better the old Book, which had been for twenty Years
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
discontinued and rejected.” And therefore it was moved, “that there
might not be such an Affront put upon the Convocation, and upon the
King himself.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">And consented to by them.</NOTE> And so with little more publick Contest the Book itself
was consented and submitted to.</P>
<P>BUT then the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> depended long, and took up much Debate
in Both Houses. In the House of Peers, where the Act first began, there were
many Things inserted, which had not been contained in the former <HI>Act of Uni∣formity,</HI>
and so seemed to carry somewhat of Novelty in them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Debates there upon the</HI> Act of Uniformi∣ty.</NOTE> It admitted “no
Person to have any Cure of Souls or any Ecclesiastical Dignity in the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> but such who had been or should be ordained Priest or Deacon<MILESTONE N="10"/>
by some Bishop, that is, who had not Episcopal Ordination; excepting only
the Ministers or Pastors of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches in <HI>London</HI> and other
Places, allowed by the King, who should enjoy the Privileges They had.”</P>
<P>THIS was new; for there had been many and at present there were
some, who possessed Benefices with Cure of Souls, and other Ecclesiastical
Promotions, who had never received Orders but in <HI>France</HI> or in <HI>Holland;</HI>
and these Men must now receive new Ordination, which had been always
held unlawful in the Church, or by this Act of Parliament must be de∣prived
of their Livelihood, which They enjoyed in the most flourishing and
peaceable Time of the Church. And therefore it was said, “that this had<MILESTONE N="20"/>
not been the Opinion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon the Clause re∣quiring Epis∣copal Ordina∣tion.</NOTE> and that it would lay
a great Reproach upon all other Protestant Churches who had no Bi∣shops,
as if They had no Ministers, and consequently were no Churches:
For that it was well known the Church of <HI>England</HI> did not allow Reor∣dination,
as the ancient Church never admited it; insomuch as if any
Priest of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> renounces the Communion thereof, his Or∣dination
is not questioned, but He is as capable of any Preferment in this
Church, as if He had been ordained in it. And therefore the not ad∣mitting
the Ministers of other <HI>Protestants</HI> to have the same Privilege,
can proceed from no other Ground, than that They looked not upon<MILESTONE N="30"/>
them as Ministers, having no Ordination; which is a Judgment the
Church of <HI>England</HI> had not ever owned: And that it would be very im∣prudent
to do it now.”</P>
<P>To this it was answered, “that the Church of <HI>England</HI> judged none but
her own Children, nor did determine that other Protestant Churches were
without Ordination. It is a Thing without her Cognizance: And most
of the learned Men of those Churches had made Necessity the chief Pil∣lar
to support that Ordination of theirs. That Necessity cannot be
pleaded here, where Ordination is given according to the unquestionable
Practice of the Church of Christ: If They who pretend foreign Ordina∣tion<MILESTONE N="40"/>
are his Majesty's Subjects, They have no Excuse of Necessity, for
They might in all Times have received Episcopal Ordination, and so
They did upon the Matter renounce their own Church; if They are
Strangers, and pretend to Preferment in this Church, They ought to
conform and to be subject to the Laws of the Kingdom, which con∣cern
only those who desire to live under the Protection thereof. For the
Argument of Reordination, there is no such Thing required. Rebapti∣zation
is not allowed in or by any Church: Yet in all Churches where it
is doubted, as it may be often with very good Reason, whether the Per∣son
hath been baptized or no, or if it hath been baptized by a Midwife<MILESTONE N="50"/>
or lay Person; without determining the Validity or Invalidity of such
Baptism, there is an hypothetical Form, <HI>If Thou hast not been already
baptized, I do baptize,</HI> &amp;c. So in this Case of Ordination, the Form may
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
be the same, <HI>If Thou hast not been already ordained, then I do
ordain,</HI> &amp;c. If his former Ordination were good, this is void; if
the other was invalid or defective, He hath Reason to be glad that it be
thus supplied.” After much Debate, that Clause remained still in the
Act: And very many, who had received Presbyterian Orders in the late
Times, came very willingly to be ordained in the Manner aforesaid by a
Bishop; and very few chose to quit or lose a Parsonage or Vicarage of any
Value upon that Scruple.</P>
<P>THERE was another Clause in the Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Clamour af∣terwards raised about the Clause of</HI> Assent <HI>and</HI> Consent.</NOTE> that made very much more Noise
<MILESTONE N="10"/>afterwards, though for the present it took not up so much Time, and in
Truth was little taken Notice of: That is, a Form of Subscription that
every Man was to make, who had received, or before He received, any Be∣nefice
or Preferment in the Church; which comprehended all the Governours,
Superiours and Fellows, in all the Colleges and Halls of either University, and
all Schoolmasters and the like, who are subservient towards Learning. Every
such Person was to declare “his unfeigned Assent and Consent to all and every
Thing contained and prescribed in and by the Book, entitled <HI>The Book of
Common Prayer,</HI> &amp;c.” The Subscription was generally thought so rea∣sonable,
that it scarce met with any Opposition in either House. But when
<MILESTONE N="20"/>it came abroad, and was to be submitted to, all the dissenting Brethren
cried out, “that it was a Snare to catch them, to say that which could not
consist with their Consciences.” They took great Pains to distinguish and
to make great Difference between <HI>Assent</HI> and <HI>Consent:</HI> “They could be
content to read the Book in the Manner They were obliged to do, which
shewed their Consent; but declaring their unfeigned Assent to every
Thing contained and prescribed therein would imply, that They were so
fully convinced in their Judgments, as to think that it was so perfect, that
Nothing therein could be amended, which for their Part They thought
there might. That there were many Expressions in the <HI>Rubrick,</HI> which
<MILESTONE N="30"/>They were not bound to read; yet by this Assent They declared their
Approbation thereof.” But after many tedious Discourses of this tyran∣nical
Imposition, They grew by Degrees ashamed of it; and were persuaded
to think, that <HI>Assent</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> had so near the same Signification, that
They could hardly consent to do what They did not assent to: So that
the chiefest amongst them, to avoid a very little Inconvenience, subscribed
the same.</P>
<P>BUT there was shortly after another Clause added, that gave them
Trouble indeed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill passed by the Lords.</NOTE> When the Bill had passed the Lords House, it was
sent of Course to the Commons; where though all the Factions in Re∣ligion
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had too many Friends, for the most contrary and opposite one to
another always were united and reconciled against the Church, yet They
who were zealous for the Government, and who hated all the other Factions
at least enough, were very much superiour in Number and in Reputation.
And the Bill was no sooner read there, than every Man according to his
Passion thought of adding somewhat to it, that might make it more
grievous to Somebody whom He did not love; which made the Discourses
tedious and vehement and full of Animosity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amendments made by the House of Com∣mons.</NOTE> And at last They agreed
upon a Clause, which contained another Subscription and Declaration,
which every Man was to make before He could be admitted into any Benefice
<MILESTONE N="50"/>or Ecclesiastical Promotion, or to be a Governour or Fellow in either of the
Universities. He must first declare, “that it is not lawful, upon any Pre∣tence
whatsoever, to take Arms against the King; and that He doth ab∣hor
that traiterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority against his
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
Person, or against those that are commissioned by him; and that He will
conform to the <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it is now by Law esta∣blished.”
And He doth declare, “that He doth hold there lies no Obli∣gation
upon him, or on any other Person, from the Oath commonly called
<HI>The solemn League and Covenant,</HI> to endeavour any Change or Alteration
of Government, either in Church or State; and that the same was in it∣self
an unlawful Oath, and imposed upon the Subjects of this Realm,
against the known Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom;” with some other
Clauses, which need not be mentioned because they were afterwards left out.
And with this Addition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill re∣turned to the Lords.</NOTE> and some other Alterations, They returned the Bill<MILESTONE N="10"/>
again to the Lords for their Approbation.</P>
<P>THE framing and forming this Clause had taken up very much Time,
and raised no less Passion in the House of Commons: And now it came
among the Lords, it was not less troublesome. It added to the Displeasure
and Jealousy against the Bishops, by whom it was thought to be prepared,
and commended to their Party in the lower House. Many Lords, who had
taken the <HI>Covenant,</HI> were not so much concerned that the Clergy (for whom
only this Act was prepared) should be obliged to make this Declaration;
but apprehended more, that when such a Clause should be once passed in
one Act of Parliament, it could not after be disputed, and so would be<MILESTONE N="20"/>
inserted into all other Acts which related to the Function of any other
Offices, and so would in a short Time be required of themselves. And
therefore They opposed it warmly “as a Thing unnecessary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates upon the Amend∣ments made by the Commons.</NOTE> and which would
widen the Breach, instead of closing up the Wounds that had been made;
which the King had made it his Business to do, and the Parliament had
hitherto concurred with his Majesty in that Endeavour. That many Men
would believe or fear (which in such a Case is the same), that this Clause
might prove a Breach of the <HI>Act of Indemnity,</HI> which had not only pro∣vided
against Indictments and Suits at Law and Penalties, but against Re∣proaches
for what was past, which this Clause would be understood to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
give new Life to. For what concerned the Conformity to the <HI>Liturgy</HI>
of the Church as it is now established, it is provided for as fully
in the former Subscription in this Act, and therefore is impertinent
in this Place. That the <HI>Covenant</HI> contained many good Things in it,
as defending the King's Person, and maintaining the Protestant Reli∣gion:
And therefore to say that there lies no Obligation from it, would
neither be for the Service of the King or the Interest of the Church;
especially since it was well known, that it had wrought upon the Con∣science
of many to serve the King in the late Revolution, from which
his Majesty had received great Advantage. However it was now dead,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
all Men were absolved from taking it, nor could it be imposed or offered
to any Man without Punishment; and They, who had in the ill Times
been forced to take it, did now inviolably and cheerfully perform all the
Duties of Allegiance and Fidelity to his Majesty. If it had at any Time
produced any Good, that was an Excuse for the Irregularity of it: It
could do no Mischief for the future; and therefore that it was Time to
bury it in Oblivion.”</P>
<P>MANY Men believed, that though They insisted principally on that Part
which related to the <HI>Covenant,</HI> They were in Truth more afflicted with
the first Part; in which it was declared, “that it was not lawful, upon<MILESTONE N="50"/>
any Pretence whatsoever, to take Arms against the King; and that He
doth abhor that traiterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority
against his Person:” Which Conclusions had been the Principles which
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
supported their Rebellion, and by which They had imposed upon the Peo∣ple,
and got their Concurrence. They durst not oppose this, because the
Parliament had already by a former Act declared the Law to be so in those
Particulars: Yet this went much nearer to them, that by their own parti∣cular
Declaration (for They looked upon it as that which in a short Time
must be their own), They should upon the Matter confess themselves to
have been Traitors, which They had not yet been declared to have been;
and no Man could now justify the calling them so.</P>
<P>THEY who were most solicitous that the House should concur with the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Commons in this Addition, had Fieldroom enough to expatiate upon the
gross Iniquity of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> They made themselves very merry with the
Allegation, “that the King's Safety and the Interest of the Church were
provided for by the <HI>Covenant,</HI> when it had been therefore entered into, to
fight against the King and to destroy the Church. That there was no
one lawful or honest Clause in the <HI>Covenant,</HI> that was not destroyed or
made of no Signification by the next that succeeded; and if it were not,
the same Obligation was better provided for by some other Oaths, which
the same Men had or ought to have taken, and which ought to have
restrained them from taking the <HI>Covenant:</HI> And therefore it may justly be
<MILESTONE N="20"/>pronounced, that there is no Obligation upon any Man from thence.
That there was no Breach of the <HI>Act of Indemnity,</HI> nor any Reproach
upon any Man for having taken it, except what would result from his
own Conscience. But that it was most absolutely necessary for the Safety
of the King's Person, and the Peace of the Kingdom, that They who
had taken it should declare, that They do not believe themselves to be
bound by it: Otherwise They may still think, that They may fight
against the King, and must conspire the Destruction of the Church. And
They cannot take too much Care, or use too much Diligence, to disco∣ver
who are of that Opinion; that They may be strictly looked unto,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and restrained from doing that which They take themselves obliged
to do. That the <HI>Covenant</HI> is not dead, as was alleged, but still retains
great Vigour; was still the Idol to which the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> sacrificed:
And that there must and would always be a general Jealousy of all those
who had taken it, until They had declared that it did not bind them;
especially of the Clergy, who had so often enlarged in their Pulpits, how
absolutely and indispensably all Men were obliged to prosecute the End
of it, which is to destroy the Church, whatever Danger it brings the
King's Person to. And therefore They of all Men ought to be glad of
this Opportunity, that was offered, to vindicate their Loyalty and Obe∣dience;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and if They were not ready to do so, They were not fit to be
trusted with the Charge and Care of the Souls of the King's Subjects.”</P>
<P>AND in Truth there were not any more importunate for the enjoining
this Declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords con∣sent to most of the Amend∣ments.</NOTE> than many who had taken the <HI>Covenant.</HI> Many who
had never taken it, and had always detested it, and paid soundly for
being known to do so, were yet very sorry that it was inserted at this
Time and in this Place; for They foresaw it would make Divisions, and
keep up the several Factions, which would have been much weakened, and
in a short Time brought to Nothing, if the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had been sepa∣rated
from the rest, who did perfectly hate and were as perfectly hated by
<MILESTONE N="50"/>all the rest. But since it was brought upon the Stage, and it had been the
Subject of so much Debate, They believed the House of Lords could not
now refuse to concur with the Commons, without undergoing some Re∣proach
and Scandal of not having an ill Opinion enough of the <HI>Covenant;</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
of which as They were in no Degree guilty, so They thought it to be of
mischievous Consequence to be suspected to be so. And therefore, after
They had expunged some other Parts of that Subscription which had been
annexed to it, and mended some other Expressions in other Places, which
might rather irritate than compose those Humours which already boiled
too much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons agree with the Lords.</NOTE> They returned the Bill to the House of Commons; which sub∣mitted
to all that They had done: And so it was presented to the King,
who could not well refuse his Royal Assent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Bill.</NOTE> nor did in his own Judgment
or Inclination dislike what was offered to him.</P>
<P>BY this <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> there was an End put to all the Liberty and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
License, which had been practised in all Churches from the Time of his
Majesty's Return, and by his Declaration that He had emitted afterwards.
The <HI>Common Prayer</HI> must now be constantly read in all Churches, and no
other Form admitted: And what Clergyman soever did not fully conform
to whatsoever was contained in that Book, or enjoined by the <HI>Act of Uni∣formity,</HI>
by or before <HI>St. Bartholomew-Day,</HI> which was about three Months
after the Act was published; He was <HI>ipso facto</HI> deprived of his Benefice, or
any other spiritual Promotion of which He stood possessed, and the Patron
was to present another in his Place, as if He were dead: So that it was not
in the King's Power to give any Dispensation to any Man, that could pre∣serve<MILESTONE N="20"/>
him against the Penalty in the <HI>Act of Uniformity.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Act was no sooner published (for I am willing to continue this Re∣lation
to the Execution of it, because there were some intervening Accidents
that were not understood), than all the Presbyterian Ministers expressed
their Disapprobation of it with all the Passion imaginable. They com∣plained
“that the King had violated his Promise made to them in his De∣claration
from <HI>Breda,</HI>”<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Presbyte∣rian Ministers complain of the King's Violation of his</HI> Declara∣tion.</NOTE> which was urged with great Uningenuity, and
without any Shadow of Right; for his Majesty had thereby referred the
whole Settlement of all Things relating to Religion, to the Wisdom of Par∣liament;
and declared, “in the mean Time that Nobody should be punished or<MILESTONE N="30"/>
questioned, for continuing the Exercise of his Religion in the Way He had been
accustomed to in the late Confusions.” And his Majesty had continued this
Indulgence by his Declaration after his Return, and thereby fully complied
with his Promise from <HI>Breda;</HI> which He should indeed have violated, if He
had now refused to concur in the Settlement the Parliament had agreed upon,
being in Truth no less obliged to concur with the Parliament in the Set∣tlement
that the Parliament should propose to him, than He was not to cause
any Man to be punished for not obeying the former Laws, till a new
Settlement should be made. But how evident soever this Truth is, They
would not acknowledge it; but armed their Proselytes with confident As∣sertions,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and unnatural Interpretations of the Words in the King's Declara∣tion,
as if the King were bound to grant Liberty of Conscience, whatever
the Parliament should or should not desire, that is, to leave all Men to live
according to their own Humours and Appetites, let what Laws soever be
made to the contrary. They declared “that They could not with a good
Conscience either subscribe the one or the other Declaration: They could
not say that They did assent or consent in the first, nor declare in the
second that there remained no Obligation from the <HI>Covenant;</HI> and there∣fore
that They were all resolved to quit their Livings, and to depend upon
Providence for their Subsistence.”<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THERE cannot be a better Evidence of the general Affection of the
Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Act in general will recei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d.</NOTE> than that this Act of Parliament had so concurrent an Appro∣bation
of the two Houses of Parliament, after a Suppression of that Form
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
of Devotion for near twenty Years, and the highest Discountenance and
Oppression of all those who were known to be devoted or affected to it.
And from the Time of the King's Return, when it was lawful to use it,
though it was not enjoined, Persons of all Conditions flocked to those Churches
where it was used. And it was by very many sober Men believed, that if
the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and the other Factions in Religion had been only permit∣ted
to exercise their own Ways, without any Countenance from the Court;
the Heart of all the Factions against the Church would have been broken, be∣fore
the Parliament did so fully declare itself.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>AND there cannot be a greater Manifestation of the Distemper and Li∣cense
of the Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the Behaviour of the Presby∣terian Ministeres.</NOTE> than the Presumption of those Presbyterian Ministers, in
the opposing and contradicting an Act of Parliament; when there was scarce
a Man in that Number, who had not been so great a Promoter of the
Rebellion, or contributed so much to it, that They had no other Title to
their Lives but by the King's Mercy; and there were very few amongst
them, who had not come into the Possession of the Churches They now
held, by the Expulsion of the Orthodox Ministers who were lawfully
possessed of them, and who being by their Imprisonment, Poverty, and other
Kinds of Oppression and Contempt during so many Years, departed this
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Life, the Usurpers remained undisturbed in their Livings, and thought it
now the highest Tyranny to be removed from them, though for offending
the Law, and Disobedience to the Government. That those Men should
give themselves an Act of Oblivion of all their Transgressions and Wicked∣ness,
and take upon them again to pretend a Liberty of Conscience against
the Government, which They had once overthrown upon their Pretences;
was such an Impudence, as could not have fallen into the Hearts even of
those Men from the Stock of their own Malice, without some great Defect
in the Government, and Encouragement or Countenance from the highest
Powers. The King's too gracious Disposition and Easiness of Access, as
<MILESTONE N="30"/>hath been said before, had from the Beginning raised their Hopes and dis∣pelled
their Fears; whilst his Majesty promised himself a great Harvest in
their Conversion, by his Gentleness and Affability. And They insinuated
themselves by a Profession, “that it was more the Regard of his Service,
than any Obstinacy in themselves, which kept them from Conformity to
what the Law had enjoined; that They might still preserve their Credit
with their Parishioners, and by Degrees bring them to a perfect Obedience:”
Whereas indeed all the Corruption was in the Clergy; and where a prudent
and Orthodox Man was in the Pulpit, the People very willingly heard the
<HI>Common Prayer.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>NOR did this Confidence leave them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have too free <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the King.</NOTE> after the passing and publishing
this <HI>Act of Uniformity:</HI> But the <HI>London</HI> Ministers, who had the Govern∣ment
of those in the Country, prevailed with the General (who without
any violent Inclinations of his own was always ready for his Wife's Sake)
to bring them to the King, who always received them with too much Cle∣mency,
and dismissed them with too much Hope. They lamented “the
Sadness of their Condition, which (after having done so much Service
to his Majesty, and been so graciously promised by him his Protection)
must now be exposed to all Misery and Famine.” They told him “what
a vast Number of Churches” (five Times more than was true) “would
<MILESTONE N="50"/>become void by this Act, which would not prove for his Service; and
that They much feared, the People would not continue as quiet and peace∣able
as They had been under their Oversight.” They used all the Ar∣guments
They thought might work upon him: And He seemed to be the
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
more moved, because He knew that it was not in his Power to help them.
He told them, “He had great Compassion for them; and was heartily
sorry that the Parliament had been so severe towards them, which He
would remit, if it were in his Power; and therefore that They should
advise with their Friends, and that if They found that it would be in his
Power to give them any Ease, They should find him inclined to gratify
them in whatsoever They desired:” Which gracious Expressions raised
their Spirits as high as ever; and They reported to their Friends much more
than in Truth the King had said to them (which was no new Artifice with
them), and advised their Friends in all Parts “to be firm to their Principles,”<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and assured them, “that the Rigour of the Act of Parliament should not
be pressed against them.”</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that the King was too irresolute, and apt to be
shaken in those Counsels which with the greatest Deliberation He had con∣cluded,
by too easily permitting or at least not restraining any Men who
waited upon him, or were present with him in his Recesses, to examine
and censure what was resolved; an Infirmity that brought him many Trou∣bles,
and exposed his Ministers to Ruin: Though in his Nature, Judg∣ment
and Inclinations He did detest the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and by the Expe∣rience
He had of their Faculties, Pride and Insolence in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had<MILESTONE N="20"/>
brought from thence such an Abhorrence of them, that for their Sakes He
thought better of any of the other Factions. Nor had He any Kindness
for any Person whom He suspected to adhere to them: For the Lord <HI>Lau∣therdale</HI>
took all Pains to be thought no <HI>Presbyterian;</HI> and pleased himself
better with no Humour, than laughing at that People, and telling ridiculous
Stories of their Folly and foul Corruptions. Yet the King, from the Opi∣nion
He had of their great Power to do him Good or Harm, which was
oftentimes unskilfully insinuated to him by Men who He knew were not
of their Party, but were really deceived themselves by a wrong Compu∣tation
and Estimate of their Interest, was not willing to be thought an<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Enemy to them. And there were too many bold Speakers about the Court
too often admitted into his Presence, who being without any Sense of Re∣ligion,
thought all rather ought to be permitted, than to undergo any
Trouble and Disturbance on the Behalf of any one.</P>
<P>THE continued Address and Importunity of these Ministers, as <HI>St. Bar∣tholomew's</HI>
Day approached nearer, more disquieted the King. They
enlarged with many Words “on the great Joy that They and all their
Friends had received, from the Compassion his Majesty so graciously had
expressed on their Behalf, which They would never forget, or forfeit by
any undutiful Carriage.” They confessed “that They found, upon Con∣ference<MILESTONE N="40"/>
with their Friends who wished them well, and upon Perusal of
the Act of Parliament, that it was not in his Majesty's Power to give
them so much Protection against the Penalty of the Act of Parliament,
as They had hoped, and as his great Goodness was inclined to give them.
But that it would be an unspeakable Comfort to them, if his Majesty's
Grace towards them were so manifested, that the People might discern that
this extreme Rigour was not grateful to him, but that He could be well
content if it were for some Time suspended; and therefore They were
humble Suitors to him, that He would by his Letters to the Bishops, or by
a Proclamation, or an Act of Council, or any other Way his Majesty<MILESTONE N="50"/>
should think fit, publish his Desire that the Execution of the <HI>Act of
Uniformity,</HI> as to all but the Reading of the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which They would
conform to, might be suspended for three Months; and that He would
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
take it well from the Bishops or any of the Patrons, who would so far
comply with his Desire, as not to take any Advantage of those Clauses in
the Statute, which gave them Authority to present as in a Vacancy.
They doubted not there would be many, who would willingly submit to
his Majesty's Pleasure: But whatever the Effect should be, They would
pay the same humble Acknowledgments to his Majesty, as if it had pro∣duced
all that They desired.”</P>
<P>WHETHER his Majesty thought it would do them no Good, and there∣fore
that it was no Matter if He granted it; or that He thought it no Pre∣judice
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to the Church, if the Act were suspended for three Months; or that
He was willing to redeem himself from the present Importunity (an Infir∣mity
He was too often guilty of): True it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pro∣mises to sus∣pend the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣cution of the Act.</NOTE> He did make them a positive
Promise, “that He would do what They desired;” with which They were
abundantly satisfied, and renewed their Encouragement to their Friends
“to persevere to the End.” And this Promise was solemnly given to
them in the Presence of the General, who was to solicit the King's Dis∣patch,
that his Pleasure might be known in due Time. It was now the
long Vacation, and few of the Council were then in Town, or of the Bi∣shops,
with whom his Majesty too late thought it necessary to confer, that
<MILESTONE N="20"/>such an Instrument might be prepared as was fit for the Affair. Hereupon
the King told the Chancellor (who was not thought Friend enough to the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> to be sooner communicated with) all that had passed, what
the Ministers had desired, and what He had promised; and bade him “to
think of the best Way of doing it.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was one of those, who would have been glad that the
Act had not been clogged with many of those Clauses, which He foresaw
might produce some Inconveniences; but when it was passed, He thought
it absolutely necessary to see Obedience paid to it without any Connivance:
And therefore, as He had always dissuaded the King from giving so much
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Countenance to those Applications, which He always knew published more
to be said than in Truth was ever spoken, and was the more troubled for
this Progress They had made with the King; He told his Majesty, “ that
it was not in his Power to preserve those Men, who did not submit to
do all that was to be done by the Act, from Deprivation.” He gave
many Reasons which occurred, why “such a Declaration as was desired
would prove ineffectual to the End for which it was desired, and what Incon∣veniences
would result from attempting it.” His Majesty alleged many
Reasons for the doing it, which He had received from those who desired it,
and seemed sorry that they were no better; however concluded, “that He
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had engaged his Word, and that He would perform what He had pro∣mised;”
and required him not to oppose it. The Chancellor had always
been very tender of his Honour; and advised him “to be very wary in
making any Promise, but when He had made it, to perform it though
to his Disadvantage:” And it was no new Thing to him, to be reproached
for opposing the resolving to do such or such a Thing, and then to be re∣proached
again for pursuing the Resolution.</P>
<P>THE King was at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and sent for the Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI>
the Bishops of <HI>London</HI> and of <HI>Winchester,</HI> to attend him, with the
Chief Justice <HI>Bridgman,</HI> and the Attorney General: There were likewise
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the Chancellor, the General, the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Secretaries.
His Majesty acquainted them with “the Importunities used by the <HI>London</HI>
Ministers, and the Reasons They had offered why a further Time should
be given to them to consider of what was so new to them; and what
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
Answer He had given to them; and how They had renewed their Im∣portunity
with a Desire of such a Declaration from him as is mentioned
before, in which He thought there was no Inconvenience, and therefore
had promised to do it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He endeavours to fulfil his Promise.</NOTE> and called them now together to advise of the best
Way of doing it.” The Bishops were very much troubled, that those
Fellows should still presume to give his Majesty so much Vexation, and that
They should have such Access to him. They gave such Arguments against
the doing what was desired, as could not be answered; and for themselves,
They desired “to be excused for not conniving in any Degree at the
Breach of the Act of Parliament, either by not presenting a Clerk where<MILESTONE N="10"/>
themselves were Patrons, or deferring to give Institution upon the Presen∣tation
of others: And that his Majesty's giving such a Declaration or Re∣commendation
would be the greatest Wound to the Church, and to the
Government thereof, that it could receive.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, who did really believe that the King and his Service
would suffer more by the Breach of his Word and Promise, than either
could do from doing the Thing desired, confessed “that He believed it
would do them little Good, which would not be imputed to his Majesty,
when He had done all He could do; and that it would be a greater
Conformity, if the Ministers generally performed what They offered<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to do, in reading all the Service of the Church, than had been these
many Years; and that once having done what was known to be so con∣trary
to their Inclinations, would be an Engagement upon them in a
short Time to comply with the rest of their Obligations: And therefore,”
He said, “He should not dissuade his Majesty from doing what He had
promised;” which indeed He had good Reason to think He was resolved
to do, whatever He was advised to the contrary. The King demanded the
Judgment of the Lawyers, “whether He could legally dispense with the
Observation of the Act for three Months;”<NOTE PLACE="marg">But finds it not in his Power.</NOTE> who answered, “that notwith∣standing
any Thing He could do in their Favour, the Patrons might pre∣sent<MILESTONE N="30"/>
their Clerk as if the Incumbents were dead, upon their Not-perform∣ance
of what They were enjoined.” Upon the whole Matter the King
was converted; and with great Bitterness against that People in general, and
against the particular Persons whom He had always received too graciously,
concluded that He would not do what was desired, and that the Connivance
should not be given to any of them.</P>
<P>THE Bishops departed full of Satisfaction with the King's Resolution, and
as unsatisfied with their Friend the Chancellor's Inclination to gratify that
People, not knowing the Engagement that was upon him. And this Jea∣lousy
produced a greater Coldness from some of them towards him, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
a greater Resentment from him, who thought He had deserved better
from their Function and their Persons, than was in a long Time, if ever,
perfectly reconciled. Yet He never declined in the least Degree his Zeal
for the Government of the Church, or the Interest of those Persons; nor
thought They could be blamed for their Severity against those Ministers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Dis∣ingenuity of the Presby∣terian Mi∣nisters.</NOTE>
who were surely the proudest Malefactors, and the most incapable of being
gently treated, of any Men living. For if any of the Bishops used them
kindly, and endeavoured to persuade them to Conformity, They reported
“that They had been caressed and flattered by the Bishops, and offered great
Preferments, which They had bravely refused to accept for the Preservation<MILESTONE N="50"/>
of a good Conscience:” And in Reports of this Kind, few of them ever
observed any Rules of Ingenuity or Sincerity.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168"/>
WHEN They saw that They were to expect and undergo the worst,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They endea∣vour to raise Discontents in the People.</NOTE>
They agreed upon a Method to be observed by them in the leaving and
parting with their Pulpits: And the last Sunday They were to preach,
They endeavoured to infuse Murmur, Jealousy and Sedition into the Hearts
of their several Auditories; and to prepare them “to expect and bear with
Patience and Courage all the Persecutions which were like to follow, now
the Light of the Gospel was so near being extinguished.” And all those
Sermons They called their Farewel Sermons, and caused to be printed toge∣ther,
with every one of the Preachers Pictures before their Sermons; which
<MILESTONE N="10"/>in Truth contained all the Vanity and Ostentation with Reference to them∣selves,
and all the Insinuations to Mutiny and Rebellion, that could be
warily couched in Words which could not be brought within Penalty of
Law, though their Meaning was well understood.</P>
<P>WHEN the Time was expired, better Men were put into their Churches,
though with much murmuring of some of their Parishes for a Time, in∣creased
by their loud Clamour, “that They had been betrayed by the
King's Promise that They should have three Months longer Time:”
Which drew the like Clamour upon them by those, who had hearkened to
their Advice in continuing their Obstinacy in Confidence of a Dispensation;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>whereas otherwise They would have conformed, as very many of their Party
did. And many of the other who were cozened by them, and so lost the
Livings They had, made all the Haste They could to make themselves
capable of getting others, by as full Subscriptions and Conformity as the
<HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> required.<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length most of them con∣form.</NOTE> And the greatest of them, after some Time,
and after They found that the private Bounty and Donatives, which at first
flowed in upon them in Compassion of their Sufferings and to keep up
their Courages, every Day begun to slacken, and would in the End expire,
subscribed to those very Declarations, which They had urged as the greatest
Motives to their Nonconformity. And the Number was very small, and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of very weak and inconsiderable Men, that continued refractory, and re∣ceived
no Charge in the Church: Though it may without Breach of Cha∣rity
be believed, that many who did subscribe had the same Malignity to
the Church, and to the Government of it; and it may be did more Harm,
than if They had continued in their Inconformity.</P>
<P>THE long Time spent in Both Houses upon the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> had
made the Progress of all other publick Business much the flower;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Animo∣sities in Par∣liament about private Bills.</NOTE> or rather,
the Multitude of private Bills which depended there (and with which former
Parliaments had been very rarely troubled), and the Bitterness and Animo∣sities
which arose from thence, exceedingly disquieted and discomposed the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>House; every Man being so much concerned for the Interest of his Friends
or Allies, that He was more solicitous for the Dispatch of those, than of
any which related to the King and the Publick, which He knew would by
a general Concurrence be all passed before the Session should be made;
whereas if the other should be deferred, the Session would quickly follow
(which the King by frequent Messages desired to hasten, having received
News already of the Queen's having being at Sea many Days), and the Be∣nefit
of those Pretences would be lost, and with greater Difficulty be reco∣vered
in a succeeding Session. Then as those private Bills were for the par∣ticular
Benefit and Advantage of some Persons, which engaged all their
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Friends to be very solicitous for their Dispatch; so for the most Part they
were to the Loss and Damage of other Persons, who likewise called in Aid
of all their Friends to prevent the Houses Consent: And by this Means so
many Factions were kindled in Both Houses, between those who drove on
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
the Interest of their own or of their Relations, who mutually looked upon
one another as Enemies, and against those who for Justice and the Dignity of
Parliament would have rejected all or most of the Addresses of that Kind;
that in most Debates which related to neither, the Custom of Contradic∣tion,
and the Aversion to Persons, very much disturbed and prolonged all
Dispatch.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that after a civil War of so many Years, prose∣cuted
with that Height of Malice and Revenge, so many Houses plun∣dered
and so many burned, in which the Evidences of many Estates
were totally destroyed, and as many by the unskilful Providence of others,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
who in Order to preserve them had buried their Writings so unwarily un∣der
Ground, that they were taken up so defaced or rotted, that they could
not be pleaded in any Court of Justice; many who had followed the King
in the War, and so made themselves liable to those Penalties which the
Parliament had prepared for them and subjected them to, had made many
feigned Conveyances, with such Limitations and so absolutely (that no Trust
might be discovered by those who had Power to avoid it) that they were in∣deed
too absolute to be avoided by themselves, and their Estates become
so much out of their own Disposal, that They could neither apply them to
the Payment of their just Debts, or to the Provision for their Children: I<MILESTONE N="20"/>
say, there were many such Cases, which could be no other Way provided
for but by an Act of Parliament, and to which an Act of Parliament with∣out
too much Severity and Rigour could not be denied. And against any
of those there appeared none or very little Opposition to be made.</P>
<P>BUT the Example and Precedent of such drew with them a World of un∣reasonable
Pretences; and They, who were not in a Condition to receive
Relief in any Court of Justice, thought They had a Ground to appeal to
Parliament. They who had been compelled, for raising the Money They
were forced to pay for their Delinquency, to sell Land, and could not
fell it but at a very low Value (for it was one Species of the Oppression of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that Time, that when a powerful Man had an Aspect upon the Land of
any Man who was to compound, and so in View like to fell it, no other
Man would offer any Money for it, so that He was sure at last to have it
upon his own Price); now all that monstrous Power was vanished, They
who had made those unthristy Bargains and Sales, though with all the For∣malities
of Law, by Fines and Recoveries and the like (which is all the Secu∣rity
that can be given upon a Purchase), especially if the Purchaser was of
an ill Name, came with all imaginable Confidence to the Parliament, to
have their Land restored to them. Every Man had raised an Equity in his
own Imagination, that He thought ought to prevail against any Descent,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Testament or Act of Law; and that whatever any Man had been brought
to do, which common Reason would make manifest that He would never
have done if He could have chosen, was Argument sufficient of such a
Force, and ought to find Relief in Parliament, from the unbounded Equity
They were Masters of and could dispense, whatever Formalities of Law had
preceded or accompanied the Transaction. And whoever opposed those
extravagant Notions, which sometimes deprived Men of the Benefit of the
<HI>Act of Oblivion,</HI> was thought to be without Justice, or which to them was
worse, to be without any Kindness to the King's Party. And without
Question, upon those Motives or others as unreasonable, many Acts were<MILESTONE N="50"/>
passed of very ill Example, and which many Men were scandalized at in
the present, and Posterity will more censure hereafter, when Infants who
were then unborn shall find themselves disinherited of those Estates, which
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
their Ancestors had carefully provided should descend to them; upon
which Irregularities the King made Reflection when He made the Session.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all these Incongruities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with great Duty towards the King.</NOTE> and the Indispositions which
attended them, They performed all those Respects towards the King, which
He did or could expect from them; there being scarce a Man, who op∣posed
the granting any Thing that was proposed for the Benefit of his Ma∣jesty,
or the Greatness of the Crown: And though some of the Particulars
mentioned before did sometimes intervene, to hinder and defer the present
Resolutions and Conclusions in those Counsels, the Resolutions and Conclu∣sions
<MILESTONE N="10"/>in a short Time after succeeded according to the King's Wish. The
Militia and many other Regalities were declared and settled according to the
original Sense of the Law, and the Authority of the Crown vindicated to the
Height it had been at upon the Heads of the greatest Kings who had ever
reigned in the Nation. Monies were raised by several Bills, sufficient as
They conceived to have paid all the Debts the King or the Kingdom owed;
for in their Computations They comprehended the Debts that were owing
before his Majesty's Return, and for which the publick Faith had been en∣gaged:
And if as much had been paid as They conceived They had given,
probably it might have been enough to have discharged all those. They
<MILESTONE N="20"/>settled a constant Revenue upon the Crown, which according to the Esti∣mate
They made would amount to the yearly Revenue of twelve hundred
thousand Pounds, a Proportion double to what it was in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and it may be of any King preceding; and declared,
“that if it did not amount to that full Value, They would supply it at
another Meeting.” And though it hath not in Truth amounted to that
Sum in his Majesty's Receipts, the Parliament hath imputed it rather to ill
Managery, and letting Farms at too easy Rates, than to an Error in their
Computation. For the present, it was looked upon by the King and by
his Ministers as answerable to his Expectation. And so, upon Notice of the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Queen's being upon the Coast, and afterwards of her Arrival at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI>
the King appointed the Houses to present all their Bills to him upon the nine∣teenth
of <HI>May</HI> for his Royal Assent, it being few Days above a Year from
the Time of their being first convened.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came to the Parliament, and They had presented the
great Number of Bills which They had prepared, and after He had given
his Royal Assent to most of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech to the Parliament.</NOTE> his Majesty told them, “that He thought
there had been very few Sessions of Parliament, in which there had been
so many Bills, as He had passed that Day: He was confident, never so
many private Bills, which He hoped They would not draw into Exam∣ple.
<MILESTONE N="40"/>It was true,” He said, “the late ill Times had driven Men into
great Streights, and might have obliged them to make Conveyances
colourably, to avoid Inconveniences, and yet not afterwards to be avoided;
and Men had gotten Estates by new and greater Frauds than had been
heretofore practised; and therefore in this Conjuncture extraordinary
Remedies might be necessary, which had induced him to comply with
their Advice in passing those Bills; but He prayed them that this should
be rarely done hereafter: That the good old Rules of the Law are the best
Security;” and He wished “that Men might not have too much Cause
to fear, that the Settlements which They make of their Estates shall be
<MILESTONE N="50"/>too easily unsettled when They are dead by the Power of Parliament.”</P>
<P>HE said, “They had too much obliged him, not only in the Matter of
those Bills which concerned his Revenue, but in the Manner of passing
them, with so great Affection and Kindness, that He knew not how to
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
thank them enough. He did assure them, and prayed them to assure
their Friends in the Country, that He would apply all that They had
given to him, to the utmost Improvement of the Peace and Happiness of
the Kingdom; and that He would, with the best Advice and good Hus∣bandry
He could, bring his own Expenses within a narrower Compass.”
And He said, “now He was speaking to them of his own good Husbandry,
He must tell them, that would not be enough; He could not but ob∣serve,
that the whole Nation seemed to him a little corrupted in their
Excess of Living. All Men spend much more in their Cloaths, in their
Diet, in all their Expenses, than They had used to do. He hoped it<MILESTONE N="10"/>
had only been the Excess of Joy after so long Sufferings, that had tran∣sported
him and them to those other Excesses; but,” He desired them,
that They might all take Heed that the Continuance of them did not
indeed corrupt their Natures. He did believe that He had been that
Way very faulty himself: He promised that He would reform, and that
if They would join with him in their several Capacities, They would by
their Examples do more Good both in City and Country, than any new
Laws would do.” He said many other good Things that pleased them,
and no Doubt He intended all He said; but the Ways and Expedients to∣wards
good Husbandry were no where pursued.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Speech.</NOTE> by the King's Command, enlarged upon “the general
Murmurs upon the Expense, and that it should so much exceed all
former Times.” He put them in Mind, “how the Crown had been
used since those Times, how the King had found it at his blessed Return:
That as soon as He came hither, besides the infinite Sums that He for∣gave,
He gave more Money to the People than He had since received
from them” (He meant I suppose the Release of all the Rents, Debts and
Receipts which were due to him); “that at least two Parts of three that They
had since given him had issued for the disbanding of Armies never raised
by him, and for Payment of Fleets never sent out by him, and of Debts<MILESTONE N="30"/>
never incurred by him.” He put them in Mind “of the vast Disparity
between the former Times and these in which They now lived, and con∣sequently
of the Disproportion in the Expense the Crown was now at, for
the Protection and Benefit of the Subject, to what it formerly underwent.
How great a Difference there was in the present Greatness and Power of
the two Crowns, and what they had been then possessed of, was evident
to all Men; and if the Greatness and Power of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>
should not be in some Proportion improved too, it might be liable to In∣conveniencies
it would not undergo alone. How our Neighbours and our
Rivals, who court one and the same Mistress, Trade and Commerce,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
with all the World, are advanced in Shipping, Power, and an immode∣rate
Desire to engross the whole Traffick of the Universe, was notorious
enough; and that this unruly Appetite would not be restrained or disap∣pointed,
nor the Trade of the Nation be supported and maintained, with
the same Fleets and Forces which had been maintained in the happy
Times of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He needed not speak of the naval Power
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who instead of sculking abroad in poor single Ships as They
were wont to do, domineer now on the Ocean in strong Fleets, make
naval Fights, and had brought some <HI>Christians</HI> to a better Correspondence,
and another Kind of Commerce and Traffick with them, than was ex∣pected”<MILESTONE N="50"/>
(for at that Time the <HI>Dutch</HI> had made a low and dishonourable
Peace with the Pirates of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis</HI>): “Insomuch as They appre∣hend
no Enemy upon the Sea, but what They find in the King of
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
<HI>England's</HI> Ships, which had indeed brought no small Damage upon
them, with no small Charge to the King, but a great Reputation to the
Nation.”</P>
<P>“HE did assure them, that the Charge the Crown was then at, by Sea
and Land, for the Peace and Security and Wealth and Honour of the
Nation, amounted to no less than eight hundred thousand Pounds in
the Year; all which did not cost the Crown before the late Troubles
fourscore thousand Pounds the Year: And therefore that Nobody could
blame them for any Supply They had given, or Addition They had
<MILESTONE N="10"/>made to the Revenue of the Crown.” He told them, “that the new
Acquisitions of <HI>Dunkirk, Mardike, Tangier, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Bombayne,</HI>
ought to be looked upon as Jewels of an immense Magnitude in the
Royal Diadem; and though they were of present Expense, they were like
in a short Time, with God's Blessing, to bring vast Advantages to the
Trade, Navigation, Wealth and Honour of the King and Kingdom. His
Majesty had enough expressed his Desire to live in a perfect Peace and
Amity with all his Neigbours; nor was it an ill Ingredient towards the
Firmness and Stability of that Peace and Amity which his Royal An∣cestors
had held with them, that He hath some Advantages in Case of a
<MILESTONE N="20"/>War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment pro∣rogued.</NOTE> which They were without.” The same Day the Parliament was
prorogued to the eighteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> following.</P>
<P>IT was about the End of <HI>May,</HI> when the Queen came to <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI>
The Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> after He had reduced those of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis</HI> to
good Conditions, went to <HI>Tangier,</HI> which was to be delivered to him
before He was to go to <HI>Lisbon</HI> for the Reception of the Queen:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sandwich <HI>takes Possession of</HI> Tangier.</NOTE> And deli∣vered
to him it was, though by an Accident that might have caused it to
be delivered into another Hand. There was never the least Doubt, but that
the Queen Regent did resolve religiously to perform all the Conditions on
the Part of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and the Government was yet in her Hands. But the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>King growing towards his Majority, and of a Nature not like to comply
long with his Mother's Advice; Factions began likewise to grow in that
Court. The Delivery of <HI>Tangier,</HI> and into the Hands of Hereticks, was
much murmured at; as like more to irritate the Pope, who did already
carry himself towards them very unlike a common Father, notwithstanding
the powerful Interposition of <HI>France,</HI> which, upon the Peace lately made
between the two Crowns, was already ceased: So that They now appre∣hended,
that this new Provocation would give some Excuse to the Court of
<HI>Rome,</HI> to comply more severely with the Importunities from <HI>Spain,</HI> which
likewise upon this Occasion They were sure would be renewed with all pos∣sible
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Instance. And though the Queen had lately sent a Governour to
<HI>Tangier,</HI> whom She therefore made Choice of, as a Man devoted to her,
and who would obey her Commands in the Delivery of this Place; yet it
is certain, He went thither with a contrary Resolution.</P>
<P>VERY few Days before the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> came thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Design of not giving it up to him.</NOTE> the Governour
marched out with all the Horse and above Half the Foot of the Garrison
into the Country, and fell into an Ambush of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who being
much more numerous cut off the whole Party: And so the Governour
with so many of the chief Officers and Soldiers being killed, the Town
was left so weak, that if the <HI>Moors</HI> had pursued their Advantage with
<MILESTONE N="50"/>such Numbers as They might, and did intend within few Days to bring
with them, They would have been able to have made little Resistance.
And the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> coming happily thither in that Conjuncture, it
was delivered into his Hands, who convoyed the Remainder of the Gar∣rison
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
into <HI>Portugal,</HI> where They were like to be stoned by the People;
and then, having put a good Garrison of Horse and Foot which were sent
from <HI>England</HI> into it, He delivered it up to the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who
had a Commission from the King to be Governour thereof; and himself
with the Fleet failed to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where He had been long expected, and
found his House and Equipage ready, He being then to appear in the Qua∣lity
of Extraordinary Ambassadour to demand the Queen.</P>
<P>HIS Arrival there happened likewise in a very happy Conjuncture;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He comes to</HI> Lisbon <HI>in a critical Con∣juncture.</HI></NOTE> for
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, stronger than it had been before, was upon its March
to besiege a Seaport Town, which lay so near <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that being in the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Enemies Hands it would very much have infested their whole Trade, and was
not strong enough long to have resisted so powerful an Enemy. But upon
the Fame of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet's Arrival, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> gave over that De∣sign,
and retired: Since as it was impossible that They should be able to
take that Place, which the Fleet was so ready to relieve; so They knew
not but that the <HI>English</HI> might make a Descent into their own Quarters,
which kept them from engaging before any other Town. But the Alarum
the March of that Army had given had so much disturbed <HI>Portugal,</HI> which
never keep their whole Forces on Foot, but draw them together upon such
emergent Occasions; that They were compelled to make Use of most of<MILESTONE N="20"/>
that Money, which They said had been laid up and should be kept for the
Payment of the Queen's Portion, which was to be transported with her
into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREUPON, after the Ambassadour had been received with all possible
Demonstration of Respect and publick Joy, and had had his solemn Au∣dience
from the King and from the Queen Regent and the Queen his
Mistress; and some <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen of Quality, who were sent by the
King, were admitted to those Places of Attendance about the Queen, to
which his Majesty had assigned them: The Queen Mother with infinite
Apologies told the Ambassadour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Portu∣guese <HI>not able to pay the Queen's Por∣tion.</HI></NOTE> “that the Streights and Poverty of the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Kingdom were so great upon the late Advance of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, that
there could at this present be only paid one Half of the Queen's Portion,
and that the other Half should infallibly be paid within a Year, with
which She hoped the King her Brother would be satisfied; and that for
the better doing it, She resolved to send back the same Ambassadour,
who had brought so good a Work with God's Blessing to so good an
End, with her Daughter to the King.”</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> was much perplexed, nor did easily resolve what
He was to do. His Instructions were to receive the whole Portion, which
He knew the King expected, and which They were not able to pay. He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
had already received <HI>Tangier,</HI> and left a strong Garrison in it, and had
neither Authority to restore it, nor wherewithal to carry back the Men.
And at last, after He had used all the Means to have the Whole paid, and
was so fully informed, that He did in Truth believe that They could do no
more, He resolved that He would receive the Queen aboard the Fleet.
That which They were ready to deliver for Half the Portion, was not in
Money, but to be made up by Jewels, Sugar and other Commodities,
which should not be overvalued. The Ambassadour was contented to give
his Receipt for the several Species of the Money They would deliver, leaving
the Value to be computed in <HI>England;</HI> but expressly refused to accept the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Jewels, Sugar and Merchandises at any Rates or Prices; but was contented
to receive them on Board the Ships, and to deliver them <HI>in Specie</HI> at <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to any Person who should be appointed by them to receive them, who
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
should be obliged to pay the Money they were valued at, and to make up
the whole Sum that should be paid to the King for the Moiety. In Con∣clusion,
all Things were delivered on Board the Ships; and <HI>Diego Silvas,</HI> a
Jew of great Wealth and full Credit at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> was sent with it, and
obliged to make even the Account with the King's Ministers at <HI>London,</HI>
and to pay what should remain due. And a new Obligation was entered
into by the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> for the Payment of the other Moiety within
the Space of a Year. And the Queen with all her Court and Retinue were
embarked on Board the Fleet; and without any ill Accidents her Majesty
<MILESTONE N="10"/>arrived safely at <HI>Portsmouth:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen arrives in</HI> England.</NOTE> And having rested only three or four Days
there, to recover the Indisposition contracted in so long a Voyage at Sea, her
Majesty together with the King came to <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> at the Time
mentioned before, the twenty ninth of <HI>May,</HI> the King's Birthday, full two
Years after his Majesty's Return and entering <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER the publick Joy of the Kingdom was very manifest upon this
Conjunction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endeavours used to alienate the King's Af∣fection from the Queen.</NOTE> yet in a short Time there appeared not that Serenity in the
Court that was expected. They who had formerly endeavoured to prevent
it, used ever after all the ill Arts They could to make it disagreeable, and
to alienate the King's Affection from the Queen to such a Degree, that it
<MILESTONE N="20"/>might never be in her Power to prevail with him to their Disadvantage; an
Effect They had Reason to expect from any notable Interest She might gain
in his Affections, since She could not be uninformed by the Ambassadour
of the Disservice They had formerly endeavoured to do her.</P>
<P>THERE was a Lady of Youth and Beauty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Circum∣stances that contribute to∣wards a Mis∣understanding between them.</NOTE> with whom the King had lived in
great and notorious Familiarity from the Time of his Coming into <HI>England,</HI>
and who, at the Time of the Queen's Coming or a little before, had been de∣livered
of a Son whom the King owned. And as that Amour had been gene∣rally
taken Notice of, to the lessening of the good Reputation the King had
with the People; so it underwent the less Reproach from the King's being
<MILESTONE N="30"/>young, vigorous, and in his full Strength; and upon a full Presumption that
when He should be married, He would contain himself within the strict
Bounds of Virtue and Conscience. And that his Majesty himself had that
firm Resolution, there want not many Arguments, as well from the excel∣lent
Temper and Justice of his own Nature, as from the Professions He had
made with some Solemnity to Persons who were believed to have much
Credit, and who had not failed to do their Duty, in putting him in Mind
“of the infinite Obligations He had to God Almighty, and that He ex∣pected
another Kind of Return from him, in the Purity of Mind and In∣tegrity
of Life:” Of which his Majesty was piously sensible, albeit there
<MILESTONE N="40"/>was all possible Pains taken by that Company which were admitted to his
Hours of Pleasure, to divert and corrupt all those Impressions and Princi∣ples,
which his own Conscience and reverent Esteem of Providence did sug∣gest
to him; turning all Discourse and Mention of Religion into Ridicule,
as if it were only an Invention of Divines to impose upon Men of Parts,
and to restrain them from the Liberty and Use of those Faculties which God
and Nature had given them, that They might be subject to their Reproofs
and Determinations; which Kind of License was not grateful to the King,
and therefore warily and accidentally used by those who had pleasant Wit,
and in whose Company He took too much Delight.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>THE Queen had Beauty and Wit enough to make herself very agreeable to
him; and it is very certain, that at their first Meeting and for some Time af∣ter
the King had very good Satisfaction in her, and without Doubt made very
good Resolutions within himself, and promised himself a happy and an innocent
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
Life in her Company, without any such Uxoriousness, as might draw the
Reputation upon him of being governed by his Wife, of which He had ob∣served
or been too largely informed of some inconvenient Effects in the
Fortune of some of his nearest Friends, and had long protested against
such a Resignation; though They who knew him well, did not think him
so much superiour to such a Condescension, but that if the Queen had
had that Craft and Address and Dexterity that some former Queens had,
She might have prevailed as far by Degrees as They had done. But the
Truth is, though She was of Years enough to have had more Experience of
the World, and of as much Wit as could be wished, and of a Humour very<MILESTONE N="10"/>
agreeable at some Seasons; yet She had been bred, according to the Mode
and Discipline of her Country, in a Monastery, where She had only seen the
Women who attended her, and conversed with the Religious who resided
there, and without Doubt in her Inclinations was enough disposed to have
been one of that Number. And from this Restraint She was called out to
be a great Queen, and to a free Conversation in a Court that was to be
upon the Matter new formed, and reduced from the Manners of a licentious
Age to the old Rules and Limits which had been observed in better Times;
and to which regular and decent Conformity the present Disposition of Men
or Women was not enough inclined to submit, nor the King enough dis∣posed<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to exact.</P>
<P>THERE was a numerous Family of Men and Women that were sent
from <HI>Portugal,</HI> the most improper to promote that Conformity in the
Queen that was necessary for her Condition and future Happiness, that could
be chosen: The Women for the most Part old and ugly and proud, inca∣pable
of any Conversation with Persons of Quality and a liberal Education.
And They desired and indeed had conspired so far to possess the Queen
themselves, that She should neither learn the <HI>English</HI> Language, nor use
their Habit, nor depart from the Manners and Fashions of her own Country
in any Particulars; “which Resolution” They told her “would be for the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Dignity of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and would quickly induce the <HI>English</HI> Ladies to
conform to her Majesty's Practice:” And this Imagination had made that
Impression, that the Taylor who had been sent into <HI>Portugal</HI> to make her
Cloaths, could never be admitted to see her or receive any Employ∣ment.
Nor when She came to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and found there several La∣dies
of Honour and prime Quality to attend her in the Places to which
They were assigned by the King, did She receive any of them, till the
King himself came; nor then with any Grace, or the Liberty that belonged
to their Places and Offices. She could not be persuaded to be dressed out
of the Wardrobe that the King had sent to her, but would wear the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Cloaths which She had brought, until She found that the King was dis∣pleased,
and would be obeyed: Whereupon She conformed against the
Advice of her Women, who continued their Opiniatrety, without any
one of them receding from their own Mode, which exposed them the more
to Reproach.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen came to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> She brought with her a formed
Resolution, that She would never suffer the Lady who was so much spoken of
to be in her Presence: And afterwards to those She would trust She said,
“her Mother had enjoined her so to do.” On the other Hand, the King
thought that He had so well prepared her to give her a civil Reception,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that within a Day or two after her Majesty's being there, himself led her
into her Chamber, and presented her to the Queen, who received her
with the same Grace as She had done the rest; there being many Lords
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
and other Ladies at the same Time there. But whether her Majesty in the
Instant knew who She was, or upon Recollection found it afterwards, She
was no sooner sate in her Chair, but her Colour changed, and Tears gushed
out of her Eyes, and her Nose bled, and She fainted; so that She was
forthwith removed into another Room, and all the Company retired out of
that where She was before. And this falling out so notoriously when so
many Persons were present, the King looked upon it with wonderful Indig∣nation,
and as an Earnest of Defiance for the Decision of the Supremacy
and who should govern, upon which Point He was the most jealous and
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the most resolute of any Man; and the Answer He received from the
Queen, which kept up the Obstinacy, displeased him more. Now the
Breach of the Conditions grew Matter of Reproach; the Payment of but
Half the Portion was objected to the Ambassadour, who would have been
very glad that the Quarrel had been upon no other Point. He knew not
what to say or do; the King being offended with him for having said so
much in <HI>Portugal</HI> to provoke the Queen, and not instructed her enough to
make her unconcerned in what had been before her Time, and in which
She could not reasonably be concerned; and the Queen with more Indigna∣tion
reproaching him with the Character He had given of the King, of his
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Virtue and good Nature: Whilst the poor Man, not able to endure the
Tempest of so much Injustice from Both, thought it best to satisfy Both by
dying; and from the extreme Affliction of Mind which He underwent, He
sustained such a Fever as brought him to the Brink of his Grave, till
some Grace from Both their Majesties contributed much to the Recovery of
his Spirits.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the King forbore her Majesty's Company, and sought
Ease and Refreshment in that jolly Company, to which in the Evenings
He grew every Day more indulgent, and in which there were some, who
desired rather to inflame than pacify his Discontent. And They found an
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Expedient to vindicate his Royal Jurisdiction, and to make it manifest to
the World, that He would not be governed; which could never without much
Artifice have got Entrance into his Princely Breast, which always entertained
the most tender Affections; nor was ever any Man's Nature more remote
from Thoughts of Roughness or Hardheartedness. They magnified the Tem∣per
and Constitution of his Grandfather, who indeed to all other Purposes
was a glorious Example: “That when He was enamoured, and found a
Return answerable to his Merit, He did not dissemble his Passion, nor
suffered it to be Matter of Reproach to the Persons whom He loved; but
made all others pay them that Respect which He thought them worthy
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of; brought them to the Court, and obliged his own Wife the Queen to
treat them with Grace and Favour; gave them the highest Titles of Ho∣nour,
to draw Reverence and Application to them from all the Court and
all the Kingdom; raised the Children He had by them to the Reputa∣tion,
State and Degree of Princes of the Blood, and conferred Fortunes
and Offices upon them accordingly. That his Majesty, who inherited
the same Passions, was without the Gratitude and noble Inclination to
make Returns proportionable to the Obligations He received. That He
had, by the Charms of his Person and of his Professions, prevailed upon
the Affections and Heart of a young and beautiful Lady of a noble Ex∣traction,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>whose Father had lost his Life in the Service of the Crown.
That She had provoked the Jealousy and Rage of her Husband to that
Degree, that He had separated himself from her: And now the Queen's
Indignation had made the Matter so notorious to the World, that the
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>
disconsolate Lady had no Place of Retreat left, but must be made an Ob∣ject
of Infamy and Contempt to all her Sex, and to the whole World.”</P>
<P>THOSE Discourses, together with a little Book newly printed at <HI>Paris,</HI>
according to the License of that Nation, of the Amours of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.
which was by them presented to him, and too concernedly read by him,
made that Impression upon his Mind, that He resolved to raise the Quality
and Degree of that Lady, who was married to a private Gentleman of a
competent Fortune, that had not the Ambition to be a better Man than
He was born. And that He might do so, He made her Husband an Earl
of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who knew too well the Consideration that He paid for it, and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
abhorred the Brand of such a Nobility, and did not in a long Time as∣sume
the Title. The Lady thus qualified was now made fit for higher
Preferment: And the King resolved, for the Vindication of her Honour and
Innocence, that She should be admitted of the Bedchamber of the Queen,
as the only Means to convince the World, that all Aspersions upon her had
been without Ground. The King used all the Ways He could, by treating
the Queen with all Caresses, to dispose her to gratify him in this Particular,
as a Matter in which his Honour was concerned and engaged; and protested
unto her, which at that Time He did intend to observe, “that He had
not had the least Familiarity with her since her Majesty's Arrival, nor<MILESTONE N="20"/>
would ever after be guilty of it again, but would live always with her
Majesty in all Fidelity for Conscience Sake.” The Queen, who was na∣turally
more transported with Choler than her Countenance declared her to
be, had not the Temper to entertain him with those Discourses, which the
Vivacity of her Wit could very plentifully have suggested to her; but brake
out into a Torrent of Rage, which increased the former Prejudice, con∣firmed
the King in the Resolution He had taken, gave ill People more
Credit to mention her disrespectfully, and more increased his Aversion from
her Company, and which was worse, his Delight in those, who meant
that He should neither love his Wife or his Business, or any Thing but<MILESTONE N="30"/>
their Conversation.</P>
<P>THESE domestick Indispositions and Distempers, and the Impression
they made of several Kinds upon the King's Spirit and his Humour, ex∣ceedingly
discomposed the Minds of the gravest and most serious Men;
gave the People generally Occasion of speaking loudly, and with a License
that the Magistrates knew not how to punish, for the Publication of the
Scandal: And the wisest Men despaired of finding Remedies to apply to the
Dissoluteness and Debauchery of the Time, which visibly increased. No
Man appeared to suffer or likely to suffer more than the Chancellor, against
whom though no particular Person owned a Malignity, the Congregation<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of the witty Men for the Evening Conversation were enough united against
his Interest; and thought his Influence upon the King's Actions and Coun∣sels
would be too much augmented, if the Queen came to have any
Power, who had a very good Opinion of him: And it is very probable,
that even that Apprehension increased the Combination against her Majesty.</P>
<P>THE Lady had Reason to hate him mortally, well knowing that there
had been an inviolable Friendship between her Father and him to his
Death, which had been notorious to all Men; and that He was an im∣placable
Enemy to the Power and Interest She had with the King, and
had used all the Endeavours He could to destroy it. Yet neither She nor any<MILESTONE N="50"/>
of the other adventured to speak ill of him to the King, who at that Time
would not have borne it; except for Wit's Sake They sometimes reflected
upon somewhat He had said, or acted some of his Postures and Manner of

speaking (the Skill in Mimickry being the best Faculty in Wit many of them
had); which License They practised often towards the King himself, and
therefore his Majesty thought it to be the more free from Malice. But by
these Liberties, which at first only raised Laughter, They by Degrees got
the Hardiness to censure both the Persons, Counsels and Actions, of those
who were nearest his Majesty's Trust, with the highest Malice and Pre∣sumption;
and too often suspended or totally disappointed some Resolutions,
which had been taken upon very mature Deliberation, and which ought to
have been pursued. But (as hath been said before) this Presumption had not
<MILESTONE N="10"/>yet come to this Length.</P>
<P>THE King imparted the Trouble and Unquietness of his Mind to No∣body
with equal Freedom, as He did to the Chancellor: To him He
complained of all the Queen's Perverseness and ill Humours, and informed
him of all that passed between them, and obliged him to confer and advise
the Queen, who, He knew, looked upon him as a Man devoted to her Ser∣vice,
and that He would speak very confidently to her whatsoever He
thought; and therefore gave him Leave to take Notice to her of any Thing
He had told him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor endeavours to reconcile heir Majes∣ties.</NOTE> It was too delicate a Province for so plaindealing a
Man as He was to undertake: And yet He knew not how to refuse it, nor
<MILESTONE N="20"/>indeed did despair totally of being able to do some Good, since the Queen was
not yet more acquainted with any Man than with him, nor spake so much
with any Man as with him; and He believed, that He might hereby have
Opportunity to speak sometimes to the King of some Particulars with more
Freedom, than otherwise He could well do, at least more effectually.</P>
<P>HE had never heard before of the Honour the King had done that Lady,
nor of the Purpose He had to make her of his Wife's Bedchamber. He
spake with great Boldness to him upon Both; and did not believe that the
first was proceeded in beyond Revocation, because it had not come to the
Great Seal, and gave him many Arguments against it, which He thought
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of Weight. But upon the other Point He took more Liberty, and spake
“of the Hardheartedness and Cruelty in laying such a Command upon
the Queen, which Flesh and Blood could not comply with.” He put
him in Mind of what He heard his Majesty himself say, upon the like
Excess which a neighbour King had lately used, in making his Mistress
to live in the Court, and in the Presence of the Queen: That his Ma∣jesty
had then said, “<HI>that it was such a Piece of Illnature, that He could
never be guilty of; and if ever He should be guilty of having a Mistress
after He had a Wife, which He hoped He should never be, She should
never come where his Wife was: He would never add that to the Vexation,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of which She would have enough without it.</HI>” And yet He told him,
“that such Friendships were not new in that other Court, nor scandalous
in that Kingdom; whereas in this it was so unheard of and so odious,
that a Woman who prostituted herself to the King was equally infamous
to all Women of Honour, and must expect the same Contempt from
them, as if She were common to Mankind: And that no Enemy He
had could advise him a more sure Way to lose the Hearts and Affections
of the People, of which He was now so abundantly possessed, than the
indulging to himself that Liberty, now it had pleased God to give him a
Wife worthy of him. That the Excess He had already used in that
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and other Ways had lost him some Ground; but that the Continuance
in them would break the Hearts of all his Friends, and be only grate∣ful
to those who wished the Destruction of Monarchy:” And concluded
with “asking his Pardon for speaking so plainly,” and besought his Ma∣jesty
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
to remember “the wonderful Things which God had done for him,
and for which He expected other Returns than He had yet received.”</P>
<P>THE King heard him with Patience enough, yet with those little Inter∣ruptions
which were natural to him, especially to that Part where He had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evelled the Mistresses of Kings and Princes with other lewd Women, at
which He expressed some Indignation, being an Argument often debated
before him by those, who would have them looked upon above any other
Mens Wives. He did not appear displeased with the Liberty He had taken,
but said, “He knew it proceeded from the Affection He had for him;” and
then proceeded upon the several Parts of what He had said, more volubly<MILESTONE N="10"/>
than He used to do, as upon Points in which He was conversant, and had
heard well debated.</P>
<P>To the first, He begun with the Story of an Accident that had fallen
out the Day before; He said, “the Lady had then told him, <HI>that She did
hope that the Chancellor was not so much her Enemy, as He was generally
reported to be, for She was sure He was not guilty of one Discourtesy of
which He had been accused to her, and therefore might be as innocent in
others;</HI> and then told his Majesty, <HI>that the Day before, the Earl of</HI>
Bristol” (who was never without some Reason to engage himself in such
Intrigues, and had been a principal Promoter of all those late Resolutions)<MILESTONE N="20"/>
“<HI>came to her, and asked her whether the Patent was not yet passed; She an∣swered,
No; He asked if She knew the Reason, which She seeming not to
do, He told her that He came in Confidence to tell her, and that if She
did not quickly curb and overrule such Presumption, She would often
meet it to her Prejudice; then told her a long Relation, how the Patent had
been carried to the Chancellor prepared for the Seal, and that He ac∣cording
to his Custom had superciliously said, that He would first speak with
the King of it, and that in the mean Time it should not pass; and that if
She did not make the King very sensible of this his Insolence, his Majesty
should never be Judge of his own Bounty.</HI> And then the Lady laughed, and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
made sharp Reflections upon the Principles of the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI>” (who
had throughout his Life the rare good Fortune of being exceedingly beloved
and exceedingly hated by the same Persons, in the Space of one Month;
and now finding that there was a Stop of the Patent, made a very natural
Guess where it must be, and gratified his own Appetite in the Conclusion),
“and pulled the Warrant out of her Pocket, <HI>where</HI> She said <HI>it had remained
ever since it was signed, and She believed the Chancellor had never heard
of it: She was sure there was no Patent prepared, and therefore He could
not stop it at the Seal.”</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth is: Though according to the Custom She had assumed the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Title as soon as She had the Warrant, that the other Pretence might be
prosecuted, She made not Haste to pass the Patent, left her Husband
might stop it; and after long Deliberation was not so confident of the
Chancellor, as to transmit it to the Seal that was in his Custody, but, the
Honour being <HI>Irish,</HI> sent it into that Kingdom to pass the Great Seal there,
where She was sure it could meet no Interruption.</P>
<P>WHEN the King had made this Relation, and added some sharp Remarks
upon the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> as a Man very particularly known and understood
by him; He said, “that He had undone this Lady, and ruined her Repu∣tation,
which had been fair and untainted till her Friendship for him;<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and that He was obliged in Conscience and Honour to repair her to the
utmost of his Power. That He would always avow to have a great
Friendship for her, which He owed as well to the Memory of her Fa∣ther
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
as to her own Person; and that He would look upon it as the
highest Disrespect to him, in any Body who should treat her otherwise
than was due to her own Birth, and the Dignity to which He had raised
her. That He liked her Company and Conversation, from which He
would not be restrained, because He knew there was and should be all
Innocence in it: And that his Wife should never have Cause to complain
that He brake his Vows to her, if She would live towards him as a good
Wife ought to do, in rendering herself grateful and acceptable to him,
which it was in her Power to do; but if She would continue uneasy to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>him, He could not answer for himself, that He should not endeavour to
seek Content in other Company. That He had proceeded so far in the
Business that concerned the Lady, and was so deeply engaged in it, that
She would not only be exposed to all imaginable Contempt, if it suc∣ceeded
not; but his own Honour would suffer so much, that He should
become ridiculous to the World, and be thought too in Pupilage under
a Governour; and therefore He would expect and exact a Confor∣mity
from his Wife herein, which should be the only hard Thing
He would ever require from her, and which She herself might make
very easy, for the Lady would behave herself with all possible Duty and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Humility unto her, which if She should fail to do in the least Degree,
She should never see the King's Face again: And that He would never
be engaged to put any other Servant about her, without first consulting
with her, and receiving her Consent and Approbation. Upon the Whole,”
He said, “He would never recede from any Part of the Resolution He
had taken and expressed to him: And therefore He required him to use
all those Arguments to the Queen, which were necessary to induce her to
a full Compliance with what the King desired.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor addressed himself to the Queen with as full Liberty and
Plainness as He had presumed to use to his Majesty, but could not proceed
<MILESTONE N="30"/>so far at a Time, nor hold so long Conferences at once. When He first
lamented the Misintelligence He observed to be between their Majesties, and
She perceived the King had told him some Particulars, She protested her
own Innocence, but with so much Passion and such a Torrent of Tears,
that there was Nothing left for him to do, but to retire, and tell her,
“that He would wait upon her in a fitter Season, and when She should be
more capable of receiving humble Advice from her Servants, who wished
her well;” and so departed.</P>
<P>THE next Day He waited upon her again at the Hour assigned by her,
and found her much better composed than He had left her. She vouch∣sased
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to excuse the Passion She had been in, and confessed “She looked
upon him as one of the few Friends She had, and from whom She would
most willingly at all Times receive Counsel: But that She hoped He
would not wonder or blame her, if having greater Misfortunes upon her,
and being to struggle with more Difficulties, than any Woman had ever
been put to of her Condition, She sometimes gave Vent to that Passion
that was ready to break her Heart.” He told her, “He was desirous in∣deed
to serve her, of which He would not make great or many Protes∣tations,
since She could not but believe it, except She thought him to be
a Fool or mad, since Nothing could contribute so much to his Happi∣ness,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>as an eminent Sympathy between the King and her in all Things:
And He could not give her a greater Evidence of his Devotion, than in
always saying that to her which was fit for her to hear, though it did
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
not please her; and He would observe no other Rule towards her,
though it should render him ungracious to her.”</P>
<P>SHE seemed well satisfied with what He said, and told him “He should
never be more welcome to her, than when He told her of her Faults:”
To which He replied, “that it was the Province He was accused of usurping
with Reference to all his Friends.” He told her, “that He doubted She
was little beholden to her Education, that had given her no better In∣formation
of the Follies and Iniquities of Mankind, of which He pre∣sumed
the Climate from whence She came could have given more In∣stances,
than this cold Region would afford;” though at that Time it was<MILESTONE N="10"/>
indeed very hot. He said, “if her Majesty had been fairly dealt with in
that Particular, She could never have thought herself so miserable, and her
Condition so insupportable as She seemed to think it to be; the Ground
of which heavy Complaint He could not comprehend.” Whereupon with
some blushing and Confusion and some Tears She said, “She did not think
that She should have found the King engaged in his Affection to another
Lady;” and then was able to say no more: Which gave the Chan∣cellor
Opportunity to say, “that He knew well, that She had been very
little acquainted with or informed of the World; yet He could not be∣lieve
that She was so utterly ignorant, as to expect that the King her Hus∣band,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in the full Strength and Vigour of his Youth, was of so innocent a
Constitution, as to be reserved for her whom He had never seen, and to
have had no Acquaintance or Familiarity with the Sex;” and asked “whether
She believed, when it should please God to send a Queen to <HI>Portugal,</HI> She
should find that Court so full of chaste Affection.” Upon which her
Majesty smiled, and spake pleasantly enough, but as if She thought it did
not concern her Case, and as if the King's Affection had not wandered, but
remained fixed.</P>
<P>UPON which the Chancellor replied with some Warmth, “that He
came to her with a Message from the King, which if She received as<MILESTONE N="30"/>
She ought to do and as He hoped She would, She would be the happiest
Queen in the World. That whatever Correspondencies the King had en∣tertained
with any other Ladies, before He saw her Majesty, concerned
not her; nor ought She to enquire more into them or after them, than
into what other Excesses He had used in his Youth in <HI>France, Holland</HI>
or <HI>Germany.</HI> That He had Authority to assure her, that all former Ap∣petites
were expired, and that He dedicated himself entirely and without
Reserve to her; and that if She met his Affection with that Warmth and
Spirit and good Humour, which She well knew how to express, She
would live a Life of the greatest Delight imaginable. That her good<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Fortune, and all the Joy She could have in this World, was in her own
Power, and that She only strove to drive it from her.” She heard all
this with apparent Pleasure, and infinite Expressions of her Acknowledg∣ments
of the King's Bounty; thanked the Chancellor more than enough,
and desired him “to help in returning her Thanks to his Majesty, and in
obtaining his Pardon for any Passion or Peevishness She might have been
guilty of, and in assuring him of all future Obedience and Duty.”</P>
<P>UPON this good Temper He approached to the other Part of his Message,
“how necessary it would be that her Majesty should gratify this good Re∣solution
and Justice and Tenderness in the King, by meeting it with a<MILESTONE N="50"/>
proportionable Submission and Resignation on her Part to whatsoever his
Majesty should desire of her;” and then insinuated what would be accept∣able
with Reference to the Lady. But this was no sooner mentioned, than
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
it raised all the Rage and Fury of Yesterday, with fewer Tears, the Fire
appearing in her Eyes, where the Water was. She said, “that the King's
insisting upon that Particular could proceed from no other Ground but his
Hatred of her Person, and to expose her to the Contempt of the World,
who would think her worthy of such an Affront, if She submitted to
it; which before She would do, She would put herself on Board any
little Vessel, and so be transported to <HI>Lisbon:</HI>” With many other extra∣vagant
Expressions, which her Passion suggested in Spite of her Under∣standing;
and which He interrupted with a very ill Countenance, and told
<MILESTONE N="10"/>her “that She had not the Disposal of her own Person, nor could go out
of the House where She was without the King's Leave;” and therefore ad∣vised
her “not to speak any more of <HI>Portugal,</HI> where there were enough who
would wish her to be.” He told her, “that He would find some fitter
Time to speak with her, and till then only desired that She would make
Shew of no such Passion to the King; and that whatever She thought
fit to deny that the King proposed to her, She should deny in such
a Manner, as should look rather like a Deferring than an utter Re∣fusal,
that his Majesty might not be provoked to enter into the same
Passion, which would be superiour to hers.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE Chancellor made the more Haste to inform the King of all that
had passed, that He might prevail with him to suspend for some little Time
the prosecuting that Argument farther with the Queen. He gave him an
Account of all the good and kind Things She had said with Reference to
his Majesty, of the Professions She had made of all Duty and Obedience to
him throughout the whole Course of her Life; “that her Unwillingness to
obey him in this one Particular proceeded only from the great Passion of
Love which She had for him, that transported her beyond the Limits of
her Reason.” He confessed, “He had not discoursed it so fully with
her Majesty as He resolved to have done, because a sudden Passion had
<MILESTONE N="30"/>seized upon her, which She must have some Time to overrule;” and
therefore He entreated his Majesty “for a Day or two to forbear pressing
the Queen in that Matter, till He had once more waited upon her, by
which He hoped He might in some Degree dispose her Majesty to give
him Satisfaction.” And though He was in no Degree pleased with the
Account, yet the other did think, that He would for a little have respited
the farther Discourse of it.</P>
<P>BUT the King quickly found other Counsellors, who told him, “that
the Thing He contended for was not of so much Importance as the Man∣ner
of obtaining it; that the Contention now was, who should govern;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and if He suffered himself to be disputed with, He must resolve hereafter
to do all Things <HI>precariò.</HI>” And as this Advice was more suitable to
his present Passion and Purpose, so it was embraced greedily and resolutely.
The Fire flamed that Night higher than ever: The King reproached the
Queen with Stubbornness and Want of Duty, and She him with Tyranny
and Want of Affection; He used Threats and Menaces, which He never
intended to put in Execution, and She talked loudly “how ill She was
treated, and that She would return again to <HI>Portugal.</HI>” He replied,
that She should do well first to know whether her Mother would receive
her: And He would give her a fit Opportunity to know that, by sending
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to their Home all her <HI>Portuguese</HI> Servants; and that He would forthwith
give Order for the Discharge of them all, since They behaved themselves
so ill, for to them and their Counsels He imputed all her Perverseness.”</P>
<P><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="178" REF="183"/>
have in Affairs of such a Nature, that the King would exact an entire
Conformity to his Pleasure in this Particular; and then the Question
would only be, whether it would be better that She conform herself with
Alacrity to an Obedience, with those Circumstances which might be
obliging and meritorious on her Part; or that it should be done with∣out
her Consent, and with all the Repugnancy She could express, which
could only be in angry Words and ungracious Circumstances, which
would have a more bitter Operation in her own Breast and Thoughts,
than any where else: And therefore He did very importunately advise
her to submit to that cheerfully, that She could not resist; which if She<MILESTONE N="10"/>
should not do, and do out of Hand, She would too late repent.”</P>
<P>To which She replied with great Calmness, “that it may be worse
could not fall out than She expected; but why She should repent the
not giving her Consent, She could not apprehend, since her Conscience
would not give her Leave to consent:” Which when She saw him receive
with a Face of Trouble and Wonder, which it was his Misfortune and
Weakness never to be able to conceal or dissemble, She continued her Dis∣course
and said, “She could not conceive how any Body could, with a
good Conscience, consent to what She could not but suppose would be an
Occasion and Opportunity of Sin.” To which He suddenly replied, “that<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He now understood her; and that She ought to have no such Apprehen∣sion,
but to believe the Professions the King made, of the Sincerity
whereof She would hereby become a Witness; and if there should be any
Tergiversation, the Opportunity, which She fancied, would be more fre∣quent
at a Distance than by such a Relation, which Nothing but a re∣solved
Innocence could make desirable by either Party.” To which He
added, “that He thought her Majesty had too mean and low an Opinion
of her Person and her Parts, if She thought it could be in the Power
of any other Lady to deprive her of the Interest She had a Right to,
if She did all that became her to retain it; and which in that Case<MILESTONE N="30"/>
She could not lose but by the highest Fraud and Perjury, which She could
not justly entertain the Suspicion of.”</P>
<P>THERE cannot be a greater Patience and Intentness of hearing, than the
Queen manifested during the Time of his Discourse, sometimes seeming
not displeased, but oftener by a Smile declaring that She did not believe
what He said: And in Conclusion, in few Words declared, “that the
King might do what He pleased, but that She would not consent to it;”
and pronounced it with a Countenance, as if She both hoped and believed,
that her Obstinacy would in the End prevail over the King's Importunity:
And it is very probable, that She had Advice given her to that Purpose.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
The Chancellor concluded with telling her, “that He would give her no
more Trouble upon this Particular: That He was sorry He had not
Credit enough to prevail with her Majesty in a Point that would have
turned so much to her Benefit; and that She would hereafter be sorry
for her Refusal.” And when He had given the King a faithful Account
of all that had passed; and “that He believed them Both to be very much
to blame, and that that Party would be most excusable who yielded
first;” He made it his humble Suit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Endea∣vours prove unsuccessful.</NOTE> “that He might be no more con∣sulted
with, nor employed in an Affair in which He had been so un∣successful.”</P>
<P>THE King came seldom into the Queen's Company, and when He did<MILESTONE N="50"/>
He spake not to her; but spent his Time in other Divertisements, and
in the Company of those who made it their Business to laugh at all the
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>
World, and who were as bold with God Almighty as with any of his
Creatures. He persevered in all his Resolutions without any Remorse; di∣rected
a Day for all the <HI>Portugueses</HI> to be embarked, without assigning any
considerable Thing of Bounty to any of them, or vouchsafing to write any
Letter to the King or Queen of <HI>Portugal</HI> of the Cause of the Dismission of
them. And this Rigour prevailed upon the great Heart of the Queen, who
had not received any Money to enable her to be liberal to any of those,
who had attended her out of their own Country, and promised themselves
Places of great Advantage in her Family: And She earnestly desired the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>King, “that She might retain some few of those who were known to her,
and of most Use, that She might not be wholly left in the Hands of Stran∣gers;”
and employed others to make the same Suit to the King on her
Behalf. Whereupon the Countess of <HI>Penalva,</HI> who had been bred with her
from a Child, and who, by the Infirmity of her Eyes and other Indispo∣sition
of Health, scarce stirred out of her Chamber, was permitted to remain
in the Court: And some few inferiour Servants in her Kitchen and in the
lowest Offices, besides those who were necessary to her Devotions, were left
here. All the rest were transported to <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>THE Officers of the Revenue were required to use all Strictness in the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Receipt of that Part of the Portion that was brought over with the Fleet;
and not to allow any of those Demands which were made upon Computa∣tion
of the Value of Money, and other Allowances, upon the Account:
And <HI>Diego de Silva,</HI> who was designed in <HI>Portugal</HI> without any good Rea∣son
to be the Queen's Treasurer, and upon that Expectation had undertaken
that troublesome Province to see the Money paid in <HI>London</HI> by what was
assigned to that Purpose, was committed to Prison for not making Haste
enough in the Payment and in finishing the Account; and his Commit∣ment
went very near the Queen, as an Affront done to herself. The <HI>Por∣tugal</HI>
Ambassadour, who was a very honest Man, and so desirous to serve
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the King that He had upon the Matter lost the Queen, was heartbroken;
and after a long Sickness, which all Men believed would have killed him,
as soon as He was able to endure the Air, left <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and re∣tired
to his own House in the City.</P>
<P>IN all this Time the King pursued his Point; the Lady came to
the Court, was lodged there, was every Day in the Queen's Presence,
and the King in continual Conference with her; whilst the Queen
fate untaken Notice of: And if her Majesty rose at the Indignity and
retired into her Chamber, it may be one or two attended her, but all
the Company remained in the Room She left, and too often said those
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Things aloud which Nobody ought to have whispered. The King
(who had in the Beginning of this Conflict appeared still with a Countenance
of Trouble and Sadness, which had been manifest to every Body, and
no Doubt was really afflicted, and sometimes wished that He had not pro∣ceeded
so far, until He was again new chafed with the Reproach of being
governed, which He received with the most sensible Indignation, and was
commonly provoked with it most by those who intended most to govern
him) had now vanquished or suppressed all those Tendernesses and Re∣luctancies,
and appeared every Day more gay and pleasant, without any
Clouds in his Face, and full of good Humour; saving that the close
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Observers thought it more feigned and affected than of a natural Growth.
However to the Queen it appeared very real, and made her the more sen∣sible,
that She alone was left out in all Jollities, and not suffered to have
any Part of those pleasant Applications and Caresses, which She saw made
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
almost to every Body else; an universal Mirth in all Company but in hers,
and in all Places but in her Chamber; her own Servants shewing more Res∣pect
and more Diligence to the Person of the Lady, than towards their
own Mistress, who They found could do them less Good. The nightly
Meeting continued with the same or more License; and the Discourses which
passed there, of what Argument soever, were the Discourse of the whole
Court and of the Town the Day following: Whilst the Queen had the
King's Company those few Hours which remained of the preceding Night,
and which were too little for Sleep.</P>
<P>ALL these Mortifications were too heavy to be borne: So that at<MILESTONE N="10"/>
last, when it was least expected or suspected, the Queen on a sudden
let herself fall first to Conversation and then to Familiarity, and even
in the same Instant to a Confidence with the Lady; was merry with
her in publick, talked kindly of her, and in private used Nobody
more friendly. This Excess of Condescension, without any Provoca∣tion
or Invitation, except by Multiplication of Injuries and Neglect,
and after all Friendships were renewed, and Indulgence yielded to new
Liberty, did the Queen less Good than her former Resoluteness had done.
Very many looked upon her with much Compassion, commended the
Greatness of her Spirit, detested the Barbarity of the Affronts She under∣went,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and censured them as loudly as They durst; not without assuming
the Liberty sometimes of insinuating to the King himself, “how much
his own Honour suffered in the Neglect and Disrespect of her own
Servants, who ought at least in publick to manifest some Duty and
Reverence towards her Majesty; and how much He lost in the general
Affections of his Subjects: And that, besides the Displeasure of God Al∣mighty,
He could not reasonably hope for Children by the Queen, which
was the great if not the only Blessing of which He stood in Need, whilst
her Heart was so full of Grief, and whilst She was continually exercised
with such insupportable Afflictions.” And many, who were not wholly<MILESTONE N="30"/>
unconversant with the King, nor Strangers to his Temper and Constitution,
did believe that He grew weary of the Struggle, and even ready to avoid
the Scandal that was so notorious, by the Lady's withdrawing from the
Verge of the Court and being no longer seen there, how firmly soever the
Friendship might be established. But this sudden Downfal and total abandoning
her own Greatness, this low Demeanour and even Application to a Person
She had justly abhorred and worthily contemned, made all Men conclude,
that it was a hard Matter to know her, and consequently to serve her. And
the King himself was so far from being reconciled by it, that the Esteem,
which He could not hitherto but retain in his Heart for her, grew now<MILESTONE N="40"/>
much less. He concluded that all her former Aversion expressed in those
lively Passions, which seemed not capable of Dissimulation, was all Fiction,
and purely acted to the Life by a Nature crafty, perverse and incon∣stant.
He congratulated his own illnatured Perseverance, by which He had
discovered how He was to behave himself hereafter, and what Remedies
He was to apply to all future Indispositions: Nor had He ever after the
same Value of her Wit, Judgment and Understanding, which He had for∣merly;
and was well enough pleased to observe, that the Reverence others
had for all three was somewhat diminished.</P>
<P>THE Parliament assembled together at the same Time in <HI>February</HI> to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
which They had been adjourned or prorogued, and continued together
till the End of <HI>July</HI> following.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> They brought the same Affection and Duty
with them towards the King, which They had formerly; but were much
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
troubled at what They had heard and what They had observed of the Di∣visions
in Court. They had the same Fidelity for the King's Service, but
not the same Alacrity in it: The Dispatch was much flower in all Matters
depending, than it had used to be. The Truth is; the House of Commons
was upon the Matter not the same: Three Years sitting, for it was very near
so long since They had been first assembled, had consumed very many of
their Members; and in the Places of those who died, great Pains were
taken to have some of the King's menial Servants chosen; so that there
was a very great Number of Men in all Stations in the Court, as well be∣low
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Stairs as above, who were Members of the House of Commons. And
there were very few of them, who did not think themselves qualified to re∣form
whatsoever was amiss in Church or State, and to procure whatsoever
Supply the King would require.</P>
<P>THEY, who either out of their own Modesty, or in Regard of their distant
Relation to his Service, had seldom had Access to his Presence, never had
presumed to speak to him; now by the Privilege of Parliament every Day
resorted to him, and had as much Conference with him as They desired.
They, according to the Comprehension They had of Affairs, represented
their Advice to him for the conducting his Affairs; according to their
<MILESTONE N="20"/>several Opinions and Observations represented those and those Men as well
affected to his Service, and others, much better than They, who did not
pay them so much Respect, to be ill affected and to want Duty for his
Majesty. They brought those, who appeared to them to be most zealous
for his Service, because They professed to be ready to do any Thing He
pleased to prescribe, to receive his Majesty's Thanks, and from himself his
immediate Directions how to behave themselves in the House; when the
Men were capable of no other Instruction, than to follow the Example of
some discreet Man in whatsoever He should vote, and behave themselves
accordingly.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>To this Time, the King had been content to refer the Conduct of his
Affairs in the Parliament to the Chancellor and the Treasurer; who had every
Day Conference with some select Persons of the House of Commons, who
had always served the King, and upon that Account had great Interest in
that Assembly, and in Regard of the Experience They had and their good
Parts were hearkened to with Reverence. And with those They consulted
in what Method to proceed in disposing the House, sometimes to propose
sometimes to consent to what should be most necessary for the Publick; and by
them to assign Parts to other Men, whom They found disposed and willing
to concur in what was to be desired: And all this without any Noise, or
<MILESTONE N="40"/>bringing many together to design, which ever was and ever will be ingrateful
to Parliaments, and however it may succeed for a little Time, will in the
End be attended with Prejudice.</P>
<P>BUT there were two Persons now introduced to act upon that Stage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Characters of two leading Men in the House of Com∣mons.</NOTE> who
disdained to receive Orders, or to have any Method prescribed to them;
who took upon them to judge of other Mens Defects, and thought their
own Abilities beyond Exception.</P>
<P>THE one was Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Henry Bennet.</NOTE> who had procured himself to be sent
Agent or Envoy into <HI>Spain,</HI> as soon as the King came from <HI>Brussels;</HI>
being a Man very well known to the King, and for his pleasant and agree∣able
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Humour acceptable to him: And He remained there at much Ease
till the King returned to <HI>England,</HI> having waited upon his Majesty at <HI>Fuen∣tarabia</HI>
in the Close of the Treaty between the two Crowns, and there
appeared by his Dexterity to have gained good Credit in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
and particularly with <HI>Don Lewis de Haro;</HI> and by that short Negotiation
He renewed and confirmed the former good Inclinations of his Master to
him. He had been obliged always to correspond with the Chancellor, by
whom his Instructions had been drawn, and to receive the King's Pleasure
by his Signification; which He had always done, and professed much Re∣spect
and Submission to him: Though whatever Orders He received, and how
positive soever, in Particulars which highly concerned the King's Honour and
Dignity, He observed them so far and no farther than his own Humour dis∣posed
him; and in some Cases flatly disobeyed what the King enjoined, and
did directly the contrary, as in the Case of the <HI>Jesuit Peter Talbot;</HI> who having<MILESTONE N="10"/>
carried himself with notorious Insolence towards the King in <HI>Flanders,</HI> had
transported himself into <HI>England,</HI> offered his Service to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and after
his Death was employed by the ruling Powers into <HI>Spain,</HI> upon his under∣taking
to procure Orders, by which the King should not be suffered longer to
reside in <HI>Flanders;</HI> of all which his Majesty having received full Advertise∣ment,
He made Haste to send Orders into <HI>Spain</HI> to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> “that
He should prepare <HI>Don Lewis</HI> for his Reception by letting him know, that
though that <HI>Jesuit</HI> was his natural Subject, He had so misbehaved himself,
that He looked upon him as a most inveterate Enemy and a Traitor; and
therefore his Majesty desired, that He might receive no Countenance there,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
being as He well knew sent by the greatest Rebels to do him Prejudice.”</P>
<P>THIS was received by Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> before the Arrival of the Man,
who found no Inconvenience by it; and instead of making any Complaint
concerning him, He writ Word, “that <HI>Talbot</HI> had more Credit than He in
that Court, that He professed to have great Devotion for the King; and
therefore his Advice was, that the King would have a better Opinion of
him, and employ him in his Service:” And himself received him into his
full Confidence, and consulted with no Man so much as with him; which
made all Men believe that He was a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> who did believe that
He had any Religion. But He had made his full Excuse and Defence for<MILESTONE N="30"/>
all this at the Interview at <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> from whence the King returned
with marvellous Satisfaction in his Discretion as well as in his Affection.
And until, contrary to all his Expectation, He heard of the King's Return
into <HI>England,</HI> all his Thoughts were employed how to make Benefit of the
Duke of <HI>York's</HI> coming into <HI>Spain</HI> to be Admiral of the Gallies; which He
writ to hasten all that might be.</P>
<P>THOUGH He continued his formal Correspondence with the Chancellor,
which He could not decline; yet He held a more secret Intelligence with
<HI>Daniel O Neile</HI> of the Bedchamber, with whom He had a long Friendship.
As soon as the King arrived in <HI>England,</HI> He trusted <HI>O Neile</HI> to procure any<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Direction from the King immediately in those Particulars which himself ad∣vised.
And so He obtained the King's Consent, for his consenting to the
old League that had been made between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> in the Time
of the late King, and which <HI>Spain</HI> had expressly refused to renew after the
Death of that King (which was suddenly proclaimed in <HI>Spain,</HI> without ever
being consulted in <HI>England</HI>); and presently after Leave to return into
<HI>England</HI> without any Letter of Revocation: Both which were procured
or rather signified by <HI>O Neile,</HI> without the Privity of the Chancellor or
of either of the Secretaries of State; nor did either of them know that
He was from <HI>Madrid,</HI> till They heard He was in <HI>Paris,</HI> from whence He<MILESTONE N="50"/>
arrived in <HI>London</HI> in a very short Time after. So far the Chancellor was
from that powerful Interest or Influence, when his Credit was at highest.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188"/>
BUT He was very well received by the King, in whose Affections He
had a very good Place: And shortly after his Arrival, though not so soon
as He thought his high Merit deserved, his Majesty conferred the only Place
then void (and that had been long promised to a noble Person, who had
behaved himself very well towards his Majesty and his blessed Father) upon
him, which was the Office of Privy Purse; received him into great Fami∣liarity,
and into the nightly Meeting, in which He filled a principal Place
to all Intents and Purposes. The King very much desired to have him elected
a Member in the House of Commons, and commanded the Chancellor to use
<MILESTONE N="10"/>his Credit to obtain it upon the first Opportunity: And in Obedience to
that Command, He did procure him to be chosen about the Time we are
now speaking of, when the Parliament assembled in <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>THE other Person was Mr. <HI>William Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Wil∣liam Coven∣try.</NOTE> the youngest Son to a
very wise Father, the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had been Lord Keeper of the
Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> for many Years with an universal Reputation. This
Gentleman was young whilst the War continued: Yet He had put himself
before the End of it into the Army, and had the Command of a Foot
Company, and shortly after travelled into <HI>France;</HI> where He remained whilst
there was any Hope of getting another Army for the King, or that either
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of the other Crowns would engage in his Quarrel. But when all Thoughts
of that were desperate, He returned into <HI>England:</HI> Where He remained for
many Years without the least Correspondence with any of his Friends beyond
the Seas, and with so little Reputation of caring much for the King's Re∣storation,
that some of his own Family, who were most zealous for his
Majesty's Service, and had always some signal Part in any reasonable De∣sign,
took Care of Nothing more, than that Nothing They did should come
to his Knowledge; and gave the same Advice to those about the King, with
whom They corresponded, to use the same Caution. Not that any Body
suspected his being inclined to the Rebels, or to do any Act of Treachery;
<MILESTONE N="30"/>but that the Pride and Censoriousness of his Nature made him unconversable,
and his Despair that any Thing could be effectually done made him incom∣petent
to consult the Ways of doing it. Nor had He any Conversation with
any of the King's Party, nor They with him, till the King was proclaimed
in <HI>London;</HI> and then He came over with the rest to offer his Service to his
Majesty at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and had the good Fortune to find the Duke of
<HI>York</HI> without a Secretary. For though He had a <HI>Walloon</HI> that was, in
Respect of the Languages of which He was Master, fit for that Function in
the Army, and had discharged it very well for some Years; yet for the
Province the Duke was now to govern, having the Office of High Admiral
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of <HI>England,</HI> He was without any fit Person to discharge the Office of Secre∣tary
with any tolerable Sufficiency: So that Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> no sooner offered
his Service to the Duke, but He was received into that Employment, very
honourable under such a Master, and in itself of the greatest Profit next the
Secretaries of State, if they in that Respect be to be preferred.</P>
<P>HE had been well known to the King and Duke in <HI>France,</HI> and had a
Brother whom the King loved well and had promised to take into his Bed∣chamber,
as He shortly after did, <HI>Harry Coventry,</HI> who was beloved
by every Body, which made them glad of the Preferment of the other;
whilst They who knew the worst of him, yet knew him able to discharge
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that Office, and so contributed to tbe Duke's receiving him. He was
a sullen, illnatured, proud Man, whose Ambition had no Limits, nor
could be contained within any. His Parts were very good, if He had not
thought them better than any other Man's; and He had Diligence and In∣dustry
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
which Men of good Parts are too often without, which made
him quickly to have at least Credit and Power enough with the Duke;
and He was without those Vices which were too much in Request, and
which make Men most unfit for Business and the Trust that cannot be
separated from it.</P>
<P>HE had sate a Member in the House of Commons, from the Beginning
of the Parliament, with very much Reputation of an able Man. He spake
pertinently, and was always very acceptable and well heard; and was one
of those with whom They, who were trusted by the King in conducting
his Affairs in the lower House, consulted very frequently; but not so<MILESTONE N="10"/>
much, nor relied equally upon his Advice, as upon some few others who
had much more Experience, which He thought was of Use only to igno∣rant
and dull Men, and that Men of Sagacity could see and determine at a
little Light, and ought rather to persuade and engage Men to do that
which They judged fit, than consider what themselves were inclined to do:
And so did not think himself to be enough valued and relied upon, and
only to be made Use of to the celebrating the Designs and Contrivance of
other Men, without being signal in the Managery, which He aspired to be.
Nor did any Man envy him the Province, if He could indeed have governed
it, and that others who had more useful Talents would have been ruled by<MILESTONE N="20"/>
him. However being a Man who naturally loved Faction and Contradic∣tion,
He often made Experiments how far He could prevail in the House,
by declining the Method that was prescribed, and proposing somewhat to
the House that was either beside or contrary to it, and which the others
would not oppose, believing, in Regard of his Relation, that He had re∣ceived
newer Directions: And then if it succeeded well (as sometimes it
did), He had Argument enough to censure and inveigh against the Chan∣cellor,
for having taken so ill Measures of the Temper and Affections of the
House; for He did not dissemble in his private Conversation (though his
outward Carriage was very fair) that He had no Kindness for him, which<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in Gratitude He ought to have had; nor had He any Thing to complain of
from him, but that He wished well and did all He could to defend and sup∣port
a very worthy Person, who had deserved very well from the King, against
whom He manifested a great and causeless Animosity, and desired to oppress
for his own Profit, of which He had an immoderate Appetite.</P>
<P>WHEN those two Persons, Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> (between
whom there had been as great a League of Friendship, as can be between
two very proud Men equally illnatured) came now to sit together in the House
of Commons; though the former of them knew no more of the Constitution
and Laws of <HI>England</HI> than He did of <HI>China,</HI> nor had in Truth a Care or<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Tenderness for Church or State, but believed <HI>France</HI> was the best Pattern in
the World; They thought They should have the greatest Wrong imaginable,
if They did not entirely govern it, and if the King took his Measures of
what should be done there from any Body but themselves. They made
Friendships with some young Men, who spake confidently and often, and
upon some Occasions seemed to have Credit in the House. And upon a little
Conversation with those Men, who being Country Gentlemen of ordinary
Condition and mean Fortunes were desirous to have Interest in such a Per∣son
as Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> who was believed to have great Credit with the
King; He believed He understood the House and what was to be done<MILESTONE N="50"/>
there, as well as any Man in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>HE recommended those Men to the King “as Persons of sublime Parts,
worthy of his Majesty's caressing: That He would undertake to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix them
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
to his Service; and when They were his own, He might carry what He
would in the House of Commons.” The Men had Parts indeed and
good Affections, and often had resorted to the Chancellor, received Advice
from him, and thought themselves beholden to him; being at that Time
entirely governed by Sir <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> who was himself still advised by
the Chancellor (with whom He had a long and fast Friendship) how He
should direct his Friends, having indeed a greater Party in the House of Com∣mons
willing to be disposed of by him, than any Man that ever sate there
in my Time. But now these Gentlemen had got a better Patron; the new
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Courtier had raised their Value, and talked in another Dialect to them, of
Recompenses and Rewards, than They had heard formerly. He carried
them to the King, and told his Majesty in their own Hearing, “what Men
of Parts They were, what Services They had done for him, and how
much greater They could do:” And his Majesty received and conferred
with them very graciously, and dismissed them with Promises which made
them rich already.</P>
<P>THE two Friends before mentioned agreed so well between themselves,
that whether They spake together or apart to the King, They said always
the same Things, gave the same Information, and took Care that Both their
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Masters might have the same Opinions and Judgments. They magnified
the Affections of the House of Commons, “which were so great and united,
that They would do whatsoever his Majesty would require. That there
were many worthy and able Men, of whose Wisdom the House was so
well persuaded, that They commonly consented to whatsoever They pro∣posed:
And that these Men complained, <HI>that They had no Directions given
to them which Way They might best serve the King; They knew not what
He desired, which when They should do, it would quickly appear how much
They were at the King's Disposal, and all Things which now depended long
would be hereafter dispatched in Half the Time.”</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE King wondered very much, “that his Friends in the House were
no better informed, of which He had never heard any Complaint before,
and wished them to speak with the Chancellor:” For neither of these
Men were yet arrived at the Confidence to insinuate in the least Degree
any Ill-Will or Prejudice to him, though They were not united in any
one Thing more than the Desire of his Ruin, and the Resolution to
compass it by all the ill Arts and Devices They could use; but till it should
be more seasonable, They dissembled to Both their Masters to have a high
Esteem of him, having not yet Credit enough with either to do him Harm.
They said, “They would very willingly repair to him, and be directed by
<MILESTONE N="40"/>him: But They desired that his Majesty himself would first speak to him
(because it would not so well become them) to call those Persons, whom
They had recommended to him, to meet together with the rest with
whom He used to advise; which the Persons They named They were
sure would be very glad of, having all of them a great Esteem of the
Chancellor, and being well known to him,” as indeed They were, and
most of them obliged by him.</P>
<P>THE King willingly undertook it: And being shortly after attended
by the Chancellor, his Majesty told him all that the other two had said to
him, and did not forget to let him know the great Good-Will They had Both
<MILESTONE N="50"/>professed towards him. He asked him “what He thought of such and
such Men,” and particularly named Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> and
some other Men of better Quality and much more Interest, “who” He
said “took it ill that They were not particularly informed what the
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
King desired, and which Way They might best serve him;” and bade
him, “that at the next Meeting of the rest, these Men might likewise have
Notice to be present, together with Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Co∣ventry;”</HI>
for <HI>Harry Coventry</HI> (who was a much wiser Man than his Bro∣ther,
and had a much better Reputation with wise Men) was constantly in
those Councils.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, “that great and notorious Meetings and Ca∣bals
in Parliament had been always odious in Parliament: And though
they might produce some Success in one or two Particulars till they
were discovered, they had always ended unluckily; until they were<MILESTONE N="10"/>
introduced in the late ill Times by so great a Combination, that they
could not receive any Discountenance. Yet that They, who compassed
all their wicked Designs by those Cabals, were so jealous that They might
be overmatched by the like Practices, that when They discovered any
three or four of those, who were used to concur with them, to have any
private Meetings, They accused them to conspire against the Parliament.
That when his Majesty returned, and all the World was full of Joy and
Delight to serve him, and Persons were willing and importunate to receive
Direction how They might do it in that Convention; Care had been
taken without any Noise, or bringing any Prejudice upon those who were<MILESTONE N="20"/>
willing to be Instruments towards the procuring what was desirable, and
to prevent what would be ingrateful, that little Notice might be taken of
them, which had good Success.”</P>
<P>“THAT since this Parliament the Lord Treasurer and He had, by his Ma∣jesty's
Direction, made Choice of some Persons eminent for their Affection
to the Crown, of great Experience and known Abilities, to confer with
for the better preparing and conducting what was to be done in the
House of Commons: But the Number of them was not so great as to
give any Umbrage. Nor did They meet oftner together with them,
than upon Accidents and Contingencies was absolutely necessary; but ap∣pointed<MILESTONE N="30"/>
those few who had a mutual Confidence in each other, and every
one of which had an Influence upon others and advised them what to
do, to meet by themselves, either at the Lord <HI>Bridgman's</HI> or Mr. At∣torney's
Chambers, who still gave Notice to the other two of what was
necessary, and received Advice. That there were very few of any
notable Consideration, who did not frequently repair to Both of them,
either to dine with them or to perform some Office of Civility; with every
one of whom They conferred, and said what was necessary to inform
them what was fit for them to do.”</P>
<P>“THAT two of those who were named by his Majesty, Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> were honest Gentlemen, and received the Advice They
were to follow from Sir <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> who had in Truth a very parti∣cular
Influence upon all the <HI>Cornish</HI> and <HI>Devonshire</HI> Men. And that his
Majesty might know that He had not been well informed, <HI>that the others
named by him took it unkindly that They did not know his Pleasure,
who were leading Men,</HI> as indeed They were; He assured his Majesty
that there was not one of those, who was not particularly consulted
with, and advertised by some Person who was chosen by every one of
them for that Purpose; and that They would by no Means resort to
any Meeting, fearing to undergo the odious Name of <HI>Undertakers,</HI> which<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in all Parliaments hath been a Brand: But as They had never opposed
any Thing that related to his Service, so upon any private Insinuation
They had been ready to propose any Thing which would not have
<PB N="187" REF="192"/>
been so acceptable from any, who had been known to have Relation to his
Service, or to depend upon those who had.”</P>
<P>HE besought his Majesty to consider, “whether any Thing had hitherto,
in near three Years, fallen out amiss or short of what He had expected,
in the wary Administration that had been in that Affair;” and did not
conceal his own Fears, “that putting it into a more open and wider
Channel, his Majesty's own too publick speaking with the Members of
Parliament, and believing what every Man who was present told him passed
in Debates, and who for Want of Comprehension as well as Memory
<MILESTONE N="10"/>committed many Mistakes in their Relations, would be attended with
some Inconveniences not easy to be remedied.” The King was not dis∣satisfied
with the Discourse, but seemed to approve it: However He would
have Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and <HI>Churchill,</HI> called to the next
Meeting; and because They were to be introduced into Company They had
not used to converse with, that it should be at the Chancellor's Chamber,
who should let the rest know the good Opinion his Majesty had of those
who were added to the Number.</P>
<P>BY this Means and with these Circumstances this Alteration was made in
the Conduct of the King's Service in the Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Alteration in the Ma∣nagement of the House of Commons.</NOTE> upon which many other
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Alterations followed by Degrees, though not at once. Yet presently it ap∣peared,
that this Introduction of new Confidents was not acceptable to
those, who thought They had very well discharged their Trust. Sir <HI>Harry
Bennet</HI> was utterly unknown to them, a Man unversed in any Business,
who never had nor ever was like to speak in the House, except in his Ear
who sate next him to the Disadvantage of some who had spoken, and had
not the Faculties to get himself beloved, and was thought by all Men to be
a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> for which They had not any other Reason but from his
Indifference in all Things which concerned the Church.</P>
<P>WHEN They met first at the Chancellor's Chamber, as the King had di∣rected,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>They conferred freely together with little Difference of Opinion:
Though it appeared that They, who had used to be together before, did
not use the same Freedom as formerly in delivering their particular Judg∣ments,
not having Confidence enough in the new Comers, who in their
private Meetings afterwards took more upon them, rather to direct than to
advise; so that the other grew unsatisfied in their Conversation. And though
the Meetings continued at one of the Places before mentioned, some always
discontinued their Attendance; so that by Degrees there were less Resolu∣tions
taken than had been formerly: Nor was there so cheerful a Con∣currence,
or so speedy a Dispatch of the Business depending in the House,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>as had been.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, there appeared Nothing of Disunion in the Parliament, but
the same Zeal and Concurrence in all Things which related to the King.
The Murmurs and Discontents were most in the Country, where the Peo∣ple
began to talk with more License and less Reverence of the Court and
of the King himself, and to reproach the Parliament for their raising so much
Money, and increasing of the Impositions upon the Kingdom, without
having done any Thing for the Redress of any Grievance that lay upon
the People. The License with Reference to Religion grew every Day
greater, the Conventicles more frequent and more insolent, which disturbed
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the Country exceedingly; but not so much as the Liberty the <HI>Papists</HI> as∣sumed,
who behaved themselves with Indiscretion, and bragged as if They
had a Toleration and cared not what the Magistrates could do. The
Parliament had a Desire to have provided against those Evils with the same
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>
Rigour: But though there would have been a general Consent in any Pro∣vision
that could be made against the <HI>Fanaticks</HI> and the Conventicles, yet
there would not be the like Concurrence against the <HI>Papists;</HI> and it was
not possible to carry on the one without the other. And therefore the Court,
that They might be sure to prevent the last, interrupted all that was pro∣posed
against the former, which They wished provided against, and chose
to have neither out of Fear of Both; which increased the Disorders in the
Country, and caused more Reflections upon the Court: So that this Ses∣sion
of Parliament produced less of Moment than any other.</P>
<P>AND the King, after They had given him four Subsidies, which was all<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the Money They could be drawn to give, that He might part as kindly
with them as He used to do, and upon Discovery of several seditious Meet∣ings
amongst the Officers of the disbanded Army, which He could best sup∣press
when He had most Leisure, He resolved to prorogue the Parliament.
And so sending for them upon the 27th of <HI>July,</HI> He thanked them for the
Present which They had made to him of the four Subsidies, “which” He told
them “He would not have received from them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech at the Prorogation of the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> if it were not absolutely
necessary for their Peace and Quiet as well as his: And that it would yet
do him very little Good, if He did not improve it by very good Hus∣bandry
of his own; and by retrenching those very Expenses, which in<MILESTONE N="20"/>
many Respects might be thought necessary enough. But They should
see that He would much rather impose upon himself, than upon his Sub∣jects;
and that if all Men would follow his Example in retrenching their
Expenses (which possibly They might do with much more Convenience
than He could do his) the Kingdom would in short Time gain what They
had given him that Day.” He told them, “He was very glad that They
were going into their several Countries, where their Presence would do
much Good: And He hoped their Vigilance and Authority would pre∣vent
those Disturbances, which the restless Spirits of ill and unquiet Men
would be always contriving, and of which his Majesty did assure them<MILESTONE N="30"/>
They promised themselves some Effects that Summer. And that there had
been more Pains and unusual Ways taken to kindle the old fatal Fears
and Jealousies, than He thought He should ever have lived to have seen,
at least to have seen so countenanced.”</P>
<P>HE told them, “that He had expected to have had some Bills
presented to him against the several Distempers in Religion, against
seditious Conventicles, and against the Growth of Popery: But that it
might be They had been in some Fear of reconciling those Contradic∣tions
in Religion into some Conspiracy against the publick Peace, to
which himself doubted Men of the most contrary Motives in Conscience<MILESTONE N="40"/>
were inclinable enough. He did promise them that He would lay that
Business to Heart, and the Mischiefs which might flow from those Li∣censes;
and if He lived to meet with them again, as He hoped He
should, He would himself take Care to present two Bills to them to that
End. And that, as He had already given it in Charge to the Judges, in
their several Circuits, to use their utmost Endeavours to prevent and pu∣nish
the scandalous and seditious Meetings of <HI>Sectaries,</HI> and to convict the
<HI>Papists;</HI> so He would be as watchful, and take all the Pains He could,
that neither the one or the other should disturb the Peace of the King∣dom.”
And adding many gracious Expressions of his Esteem and Con∣fidence<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in their Affections, He caused them to be prorogued towards the
End of <HI>March,</HI> which would be the Beginning of the Year 1664.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="194"/>
THE King had an Intention at that Time to have prepared against the
next Meeting two such Bills as He mentioned to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King in∣tends to pre∣pare <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bills against the</HI> Pa∣pists <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cta∣ries.</NOTE> and was well enough
content that the Parliament had not presented such to him, which He well
foresaw would not have been such as He should have been pleased with.
He would have liked the most rigorous Acts against all the other Factions
in Religion, but did not think the <HI>Papists</HI> had deserved the same Severities,
which would have been provided against them with the other, it being
very apparent, that the Kingdom generally had resumed their old Jealousies
of them, provoked by the very unwary Behaviour of that People, who
<MILESTONE N="10"/>bragged of more Credit in the Court than They could justify, though most
Men thought They had too much: And that was the Reason that He
had commanded the Chancellor to require the Judges, who were then be∣ginning
their Circuits, to cause the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> to be convicted, which
He believed would allay much of the Jealousies in the Country, as for the
present it did. And then He resolved to cause two such Bills to be pre∣pared
for several Reasons, of which the principal was, that He might divide
them into two Bills; presuming that when He had sent one against either,
They would not affect reducing Both into one, which was that which the
Catholick Party most apprehended.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>HIS Majesty was himself very unsatisfied with the imprudent Carriage of
the <HI>Catholicks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Imprudent Be∣haviour of the</HI> Papists.</NOTE> and thought They did affect too much to appear as if They
stood upon the Level with all other Subjects: And He received very parti∣cular
and unquestionable Information, that some Priests had made it an
Argument to some whom They endeavoured to make their Proselytes, “that
the King was of their Religion in his Heart, and would shortly declare
it to all the World;” with which his Majesty was marvellously offended,
and did heartily desire that any of those indiscreet Persons might be pro∣ceeded
against with Severity. Yet He had no Mind that any Man should
be put to Death, which could hardly be avoided if any Man should be
<MILESTONE N="30"/>brought to Trial in the Case aforesaid, except He had granted his Pardon,
which with these Circumstances would have carried Scandal in it. Besides
He did think the wisest of that Party had not carried themselves with Mo∣desty
enough, with what was good for themselves and for his Majesty's Ho∣nour.
And therefore He had, without imparting it to any Friends of
theirs, given that Direction to the Judges for convicting them, as the best
Means to reclaim them to a better Temper: And He had a Purpose, that
the Bill He meant should be prepared should more effectually perform
that Part, without exposing them to any notable Inconveniences in their
Persons or their Fortunes, if They behaved themselves well and warily.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>HE did believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King designs to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the</HI> Papists <HI>convicteled.</HI></NOTE> that it was necessary for his Service that They should be
all convicted, that it might be evident to himself what their Numbers con∣sisted
of and amounted to, which He believed would be found much inse∣riour
to what they were generally computed, and then the Danger from
their Power would not be thought so formidable: And it could be no Pre∣judice
to them without a further Proceeding upon their Conviction, which
He was resolved to restrain, as He well might, and had done hitherto; re∣solving
within himself, that no Man should suffer under those penal Laws
which had been made against them in the Age before, if They lived like
good Subjects, and administered no Occasion of Scandal. And as He was
<MILESTONE N="50"/>not reserved in declaring that his gracious Purpose towards them (as hath
been said before); so hitherto it had not been attended by any Mur∣murs:
And yet He was not without a Purpose of keeping such a Power
over them, as might make them wholly depend upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="195"/>
HIS Majesty did in his Judgment and Inclination put a great Difference
between those <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> who being of antient Extraction had con∣tinued
of the same Religion from Father to Son, without having ever been
<HI>Protestant,</HI> amongst whom there were very few who had not behaved them∣selves
very worthily; and those, who since the late Troubles had apostatized
from the Church of <HI>England</HI> to that of the <HI>Roman,</HI> without any such Evi∣dence
of Conscience, as might not administer just Reason to suspect, that
their Inducements had been from worldly Temptations. And He did re∣solve
in his Bill to make a Distinction between those Classes, and to pre∣vent
or at least to discourage those Lapses which fell out too frequently in<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the Court; nor did Men believe that They need make any Apology for
it, but appeared the more confidently in all Places. He did resolve like∣wise
to contract and lessen the Number of the Ecclesiastical Persons, who
upon Missions resorted hither as to an Infidel Nation (which was and is a
Grievance that the <HI>Catholicks</HI> would be glad to be eased in), and to reduce
them into such an Order and Method by this Bill, that He might himself
know the Names of all Priests remaining in the Kingdom, and their se∣veral
Stations where They resided; which must have produced such a Secu∣rity
to those who stayed, and to those with whom They stayed, as would
have set them free from any Apprehension of any Penalties imposed by pre∣ceding<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Parliaments.</P>
<P>BUT this Design (which comprehended many other Particulars) vanished
as soon as it was discovered.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures taken to frus∣trate his De∣sign.</NOTE> The King's own Discourse of a Bill that He
would cause to be drawn against the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> awakened great
Jealousies; nor did They want Instruments or Opportunities to discover
what the Meaning of it could be. Nor was the King reserved in the Ar∣gument,
but communicated it with those who He knew were well affected
to that Party, and to one or two of themselves who were reputed to be
moderate Men, and to desire Nothing but the Exercise of their Religion
with the greatest Secrecy and Caution, and who often informed him and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
complained “of the Folly and Vanity of some of their Friends, and more
particularly of the Presumption of the <HI>Jesuits.</HI>” And such Kind of Fac∣tions
and Divisions there are amongst them, which might be cultivated to
very happy Productions: But such Ingenuity, as to be contented with what
might gratify all their own Pretences, there is not amongst them.</P>
<P>THESE moderate Men complained already, “that the King was de∣ceived
by their Enemy the Chancellor,” who indeed was generally very
odious to them, for no other Reason, but because They knew He was ir∣reconcilable
to their Profession; not that They thought He desired that
the Laws should be put in Execution against them; and some of the chief<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of them believed him to be much their Friend, and had Obligations to
him. But They all lamented this Direction given to the Judges for their
Conviction, “which” They informed the King “was the necessary Preamble
to the highest Persecution the Law had prepared against them. That till
They were convicted They were in the same Predicament with the rest of
his Subjects; but as soon as They were convicted” (which the Judges now
caused to be prosecuted throughout the Kingdom), “They were liable to all
the other Penalties, which his Majesty was inclined to protect them from.”
They presented to him a short Memorial of the Disadvantages which were
consequent to a Conviction, in which They alleged some Particulars<MILESTONE N="50"/>
which were not clear in the Law, at least had never been practised in
the severest Times.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196"/>
THOUGH the King had well weighed all He had done before He did it,
and well knew, after all their Insinuations and Allegations, that none of
those Inconveniences could ensue to them, if He restrained any further Pro∣secution,
which He always had intended to do; yet They wrought so far
upon him, that He was even sorry that He had proceeded so far: And though
it was not fit to revoke any Part of it, yet He cared not how little it was
advanced. And for the Bill He meant to present in the next Session,
They said “all their Security and Quiet They had enjoyed since his Ma∣jesty's
happy Return depended wholly upon the general Opinion, that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>He had Favour for them, and Satisfaction in their Duty and Obedience
as good Subjects, and their Readiness to do him any Service, which
They would all make good with their Lives and all that They had.
But if He should now discover any Jealousy of their Fidelities, and
that there was Need of a new Law against them, which his Purpose
of providing a Bill implied, what Mitigation soever his Majesty intended
in it, it would not be in his Majesty's Power to restrain the Passion of
other Men; but all those Animosities which had been hitherto covered
and concealed, as grateful to him, would upon this Occasion break
out to their Destruction: And therefore They hoped, that whatever Bit∣terness
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Parliament might express against them when They came toge∣ther,
They should receive no Invitation or Encouragement by any Jea∣lousy
or Displeasure his Majesty should manifest to have towards them.”</P>
<P>THESE and the like Arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gives over his Purpose.</NOTE> or the Credit of those who urged them,
made that Impression, that He declined any further Thought of that Bill;
nor was there ever after Mention of it. The <HI>Catholicks</HI> grew bolder in all Places,
and conversant in those Rooms of the Court into which the King's Chaplains
never presumed to enter; and to crown all their Hopes, the Lady de∣clared
herself of that Faith, and inveighed sharply against the Church She
had been bred in.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>DURING the Interval of the Parliament, there was not such a Vacation
from Trouble and Anxiety as was expected. The domestick Unquietness
in the Court made every Day more Noise abroad: Infinite Scandals and
Calumnies were scattered amongst the People;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents in the Country.</NOTE> and They expressed their
Discontents upon the great Taxes and Impositions which They were com∣pelled
to pay, and publickly reproached the Parliament; when They were
in Truth vexed and grieved at Heart for that which They durst not avow,
and did really believe that God was angry with the Nation, and resolved to
exercise it under greater Tribulation than He had so lately freed them from.
The general Want of Money was complained of, and a great Decay of
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Trade; so that the native Commodities of the Kingdom were not trans∣ported.
Yet Both these were but Pretences, and resulted from Combina∣tions
rather than from Reason. For it appeared by the Customs, that the
Trade was greater than it had ever been, though some of our native Com∣modities,
especially Cloth, seemed for some Time to be at a Stand; which
proceeded rather from the present Glut, which in the general License the
Interlopers had irregularly transported in great Quantities, by which the
Prices were brought low, and could only be recovered by a Restraint for
some Time, which the <HI>Merchant Adventurers</HI> put upon themselves, and
would have put upon the Interlopers, who were at last too hard for them,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>even upon the Matter to the suppressing the Company, that had stood in
great Reputation for very many Years, and had advanced that Manufacture
to a great Height; and whether it deserved that Discountenance, Time must
decide. How unreasonable the other Discourse was of Want of Money, there
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
needs no other Argument, but the great Purchases which were every Day
made of great Estates; nor was any considerable Parcel of Land in any
Part of <HI>England</HI> offered to be sold, but there was a Purchaser at Hand ready
to buy it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER these Pretences, together with the sudden bringing up all the
Money, that was collected for the King, <HI>in Specie</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> which pro∣ceeded
from the Bankers advancing so much present Money for the emer∣gent
Occasions, for which They had those Assignments upon the Money of
the Country, did really produce such a sudden Fall of the Rents throughout
the Kingdom, as had never been known before: So that Men were com∣pelled<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to abate generally a fourth Part of their annual Rents at the least,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sudden Fall of Rents.</NOTE> or
to take their Lands into their own Hands, for which They were as ill pro∣vided.
All this Mischief fell upon the Nobility and greatest Gentry, who
were Owners of the greatest Estates, every Body whose Estate lay in Land
undergoing a Share in the Suffering, which made the Discontent general;
which They thought the best Way to remedy would be to raise no more
Taxes, which They took to be the Cause why the Rents fell. In the
mean Time the Expenses of the Court, and of all who depended upon it,
grew still higher, and the King himself less intent upon his Business, and
more loved his Pleasures, to which He prescribed no Limits, nor to the Ex∣penses<MILESTONE N="20"/>
which could not but accompany them.</P>
<P>THERE was Cause enough to be jealous of the publick Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danger of an Insurrection.</NOTE> there
being every Day Discoveries made of private Meetings and Conferences be∣tween
Officers of the old Army; and that Correspondencies were settled
between them throughout the Kingdom in a wonderful Method; and that
They had a grand Committee residing in <HI>London,</HI> who had the supreme
Power, and which sent Orders to all the rest, who were to rise in one
Day and meet at several Rendezvouses. Hereupon several Persons were
apprehended and committed to Prison; and the King himself often took the
Pains to examine them; and They confessed commonly more to his Majesty<MILESTONE N="30"/>
himself than upon any other Examination. Proclamations issued often for
the banishing all Officers who had ever borne Arms against the King
twenty Miles from <HI>London,</HI> which did more publish the Apprehension of
new Troubles.</P>
<P>THERE can be no Doubt, but that there were many seditious Purposes
amongst that People, of which there often appeared so full Evidence, that
many were executed for High Treason, who were tried and condemned by
the Judges at their general Sessions at <HI>Newgate:</HI> Yet there was often Cause
to believe that many Men were committed, who in Truth had not been
more faulty, than in keeping ill Company and in hearing idle Discourses.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Informing was grown a Trade, which many affected to get Money by:
And as the King's Ministers could not reject in a Time of so much Jealousy,
so the receiving them gave them great Trouble; for few of them were
willing to be produced as Evidence against those They accused, pretending,
sometimes with Reason, “that if They were known They should be ren∣dered
useless for the future, whereas They were yet unsuspected and ad∣mitted
into all Councils.” All the Sects in Religion spake with more
Boldness in their Meetings, and met more frequently, than they had used to
do in the Times that Sir <HI>Richard Browne</HI> and Sir <HI>John Robinson</HI> had been
Lord Mayors; and the Officers who succeeded them proved less vigilant.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
A general Despondency seemed to possess the Minds of Men, as if They lit∣tle
cared what came to pass; which did not proceed so much from Malice,
as from the Disease of murmuring, which had been contracting above
<PB N="193" REF="198"/>
twenty Years, and became almost incorporated into the Nature of the
Nation.</P>
<P>THERE happened about this Time an Alteration in the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Intrigue in the Court to advance Sir</HI> H. Bennet.</NOTE> that
produced afterwards many other Alterations which were not then suspected,
yet even at that Time was not liked in the Court itself, and less out of it.
The Keeper of the Privy Purse, who was more fit for that Province than
for any other to which He could be applied, did not think himself yet pre∣ferred
to a Station worthy of his Merit and great Qualifications. Some
Promises the King had made to him when He was at <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> and had
<MILESTONE N="10"/>long much Kindness for his Person and much Delight in his Company: So
that his Friend, Mr. <HI>ONeile,</HI> who was still ready to put his Majesty in
Mind of all his Services, had Nothing hard to do but to find a Vacancy
that might give Opportunity for his Advancement; and He was dexterous
in making Opportunities which He could not find, and made no Scruple
to insinuate to the King, “that the Abilities of neither of his Secretaries
were so great but that He might be better served.” Indeed his Ma∣jesty,
who did not naturally love old Men, had not so much Esteem
of them as their Parts and Industry and Integrity deserved, and would not
have been sorry if either or Both of them had died.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>SECRETARY <HI>Nicholas</HI> had served the Crown very many Years with a very
good Acceptation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of Secretary</HI> Ni∣cholas.</NOTE> was made Secretary of State by the late King, and loved
and trusted by him in his nearest Concernments to his Death: Nor had
any Man, who served him, a more general Reputation of Virtue and Piety
and unquestionable Integrity throughout the Kingdom. He was a Man
to whom the Rebels had been always irreconcilable; and from the End of
the War lived in Banishment beyond the Seas, was with his Majesty from
the Time He left <HI>France</HI> (for whilst the King was in <HI>France</HI> with his Mo∣ther,
to whom the Secretary was not gracious, He remained at a Distance;
but from the Time that his Majesty came into <HI>Germany</HI> He was always
<MILESTONE N="30"/>with him) in the Exercise of the same Function He had under his Father,
and returned into <HI>England</HI> with him, with Hope to repair his Fortune by the
just Perquisites of his Office, which had been very much impaired by his long
Sufferings and Banishment. He had never been in his Youth a Man of quick
and sudden Parts, but full of Industry and Application (which it may be is
the better Composition), and always versed in Business and all the Forms
of Dispatch. He was now some Years above seventy, yet truly per∣formed
his Office with Punctuality, and to the Satisfaction of all Men
who repaired to him: And the King thought it an envious as well as
an illnatured Thing, to discharge such an Officer because He had lived
<MILESTONE N="40"/>too long.</P>
<P>THE other Secretary was Secretary <HI>Morrice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Secretary</HI> Morrice.</NOTE> whose Merit had been his
having transacted all that had been between the King and the General,
which was thought to be much more than it was. Yet He had behaved
himself very well, and as much disposed the General as He was capable of
being disposed; and his Majesty had preferred him to that Office purely to
gratify and oblige the General; and He had behaved himself very ho∣nestly
and diligently in the King's Service, and had a good Reputation in
the House of Commons, and did the Business of his Office without Re∣proach.
He had lived most Part of his Time in the Country, with the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Repute of a wise Man and a very good Scholar, as indeed He was
both in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Learning; but being without any Knowledge
in the modern Languages, He gave the King often Occasion to laugh at
his unskilful Pronunciation of many Words. In the <HI>Latin</HI> Dispatches,
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>
which concern all the Northern Parts, He was ready, and treated with
those Ambassadours fluently and elegantly; and for all domestick Affairs no
Man doubted his Sufficiency, except in the Garb and Mode and Humour
of the Court.</P>
<P>AND the Inducement that brought him in made it unfit to remove him,
lest it might grieve the General, whose Friend and Kinsman He was: So
that there was no Expedient to provide for Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> but by re∣moving
Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> by his own Consent; for the King would not do
it otherwise to so old and faithful a Servant. And his Majesty was the more
inclined to it, because it would give him the Opportunity to bring another<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Person into the Office of the Privy Purse, of whom He was lately grown
very fond, and towards whom He had, when He came into <HI>England,</HI> a
greater Aversion than to any Gentleman who had been abroad with him,
and that was Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who was then Captain of the Duke of
<HI>York's</HI> Guard, and much in the good Grace of his Royal Highness.</P>
<P>WHILST this Intrigue was contriving and depending, great Care was
taken that it might not come to the Notice of the Chancellor, lest if He
could not divert the King from desiring it, which They believed He would
not attempt, He might dissuade his old Friend the Secretary, with whom
He had held a long and particular Friendship, from hearkening to any<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Proposition, or accepting any Composition; which They believed not un∣reasonably
that the other would be very solicitous in, as well to keep a
Man in, whom He could entirely trust, as to keep another out, of whose
Abilities He had no Esteem, and in whose Affection He had no Confidence:
And it was thought by many, that the same Apprehension prevailed with
the good old Man himself to cherish the Secrecy. Certain it is, that the
whole Matter was resolved and consented to, before ever the Chancellor had
a Suspicion of it.</P>
<P>ONEILE, who had always the Skill to bring that to pass by others which
He could not barefaced appear in himself, insinuated to Mr. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
who pretended and I think had much Friendship for the Secretary, “that
the King thought the Secretary too old to take so much Pains, and often
wished that his Friends would persuade him to retire, that there might be
a younger Man in the Office, who could attend upon his Majesty at all
Hours and in all Journies; but that his Majesty always spake kindly of
him, and as if He resolved to give him an ample Recompense:” And in
Confidence told him, “that the King had an impatient Desire to have Sir
<HI>Harry Bennet</HI> Secretary of State.” <HI>Ashburnham</HI> was well versed in the
Artifices of Court too; and thought He might very well perform the Office of
a Friend to his old Confident, and at the same Time find a new and more<MILESTONE N="40"/>
useful Friend for himself, by having a Hand in procuring a large Satisfac∣tion
for the old, and likewise facilitating the Way for the Introduction of a
new Secretary, who could not forget the Obligation. So He told <HI>ONeile,</HI>
“that all the World knew that He had for many Years professed a great
Friendship for Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI>” (They had been Both Servants at the
same Time to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> when He was killed), “and that
He should be much troubled to see him displaced in his old Age with
Contempt; but if his Majesty would dismiss him with Honour and Reward,
that He might be able to provide for his Wife and Children, He would
make no Scruple to persuade him to quit his Employment.” <HI>ONeile</HI> had<MILESTONE N="50"/>
all He looked for, and only enjoined him Secrecy, “that it might not come
to the King's Ear that He had communicated this Secret to any Man; and
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
He did presume, that before any Resolution was taken in it, his Majesty
would speak of it to the Chancellor.”</P>
<P>WITHIN a Day or two the King sent for <HI>Ashburnham</HI> and told him,
“He knew He was a Friend to the Secretary, who was now grown old,
and not able to take the Pains He had done; that He had served his Fa∣ther
and himself very faithfully, and had spent his Fortune in his Service;
that if He were willing to retire, for without his Consent He would do
Nothing, He would give him ten thousand Pounds, or any other Recom∣pense
He should choose,” implying a Title of Honour: But intimated,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>though He referred all to his own Will, “that He wished, and that it
would be acceptable to him, that the Office might be vacant and at his
Majesty's Disposal.”</P>
<P>HE undertook the Employment very cheerfully, and quickly imparted
all that had passed from the King, and all that He knew before, to the Se∣cretary;
who was not fond of the Court, and thought He had lived long
enough there, having seen and observed much that He was grieved at Heart
to see. He considered, that though this Message was very gracious, and
offered a noble Reward for his Service, it did withal appear that the King
did desire He should be gone; and having designed a Successour to him,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>who had already much Credit with him, if He should seem sullen or un∣willing,
He might in a short Time be put out without any Consideration,
or at most with the Promise of one. Thereupon He wished his Friend “to
assure the King, that He would very readily do whatsoever his Majesty
thought necessary for his Service; but He hoped, that after above forty
Years spent in the Service of the Crown, He should not be exposed to
Disgrace and Contempt. That He had a Wife and Children, who had
all suffered with him in Exile till his Majesty's Return, and for whom He
could not make a competent Provision without his Majesty's Bounty; and
therefore He hoped, that before his Majesty required the Signet, He would
<MILESTONE N="30"/>cause the Recompense He designed to be more than what He had men∣tioned,
and to be first paid.”</P>
<P>THIS Province could not be put into a fitter Hand, for it was managed
with notable Skill. And as soon as it was known that the Secretary would
willingly resign, which was feared, and that only a better Recompense was
expected, every Body was willing that the King should make the Act look
as graciously as might be,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Secretary</HI> Ni∣cholas <HI>resig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></NOTE> that the Successor might be attended with the
less Envy. And Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI> cultivated their Impatience so skilfully,
that it cost the King, in present Money and Land or Lease, very little less
than twenty thousand Pounds, to bring in a Servant whom very few cared
<MILESTONE N="40"/>for, in the Place of an old Servant whom every Body loved: And He re∣ceived
all that was promised, before He resigned his Place. And if the
Change had been as good for the King, as it was for the good old Secre∣tary,
every Body would have been glad.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> H. Ben∣net <HI>made Se∣cretary of State and Sir</HI> Charles Berk∣ley <HI>Privy Purse.</HI></NOTE> And thus Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> was
at the King's Charge accommodated, even to the Satisfaction of his own
Ambition: And his Majesty was as well pleased, that He had gotten Sir
<HI>Charles Berkley</HI> into the other Office about his Person, whom He every
Day loved with more Passion, for what Reason no Man knew nor could
imagine.</P>
<P>AND from this Time They who stood at any near Distance could not
<MILESTONE N="50"/>but discern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Interest declines.</NOTE> that the Chancellor's Interest and Credit with the King mani∣festly
declined: Not that either of these two pretended to be his Rival, or
appeared to cross any Thing in Council that He proposed or advised; on
the contrary, They Both professed great Respect towards him. One of
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
them, being no Privy Counsellor, made great Professions and Addresses to
him by himself, and by some Friends who had much Credit with him; pro∣tested
“against meddling at all in Business, and that He only hoped to
gain a Fortune by his Majesty's Favour, upon which He might be able to
live;” nor did it appear afterwards, that He did to his Death wish that
the Chancellor's Power should be lessened: And the other made all the Pro∣fessions
imaginable of Affection and Respect to him, and repaired upon Oc∣casions
to him for Advice and for Direction. Nor in Truth could either of
them have done him any Prejudice at that Time with the King by pre∣tending
to do it; but by pretending the contrary by Degrees got Power<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to do it.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty did not in the least Degree withdraw his Favour from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King still continues his Favour to him.</NOTE>
heard him as willingly, came as often to him, was as little reserved in any
Thing; only in one Particular He did with some Solemnity conjure him
never to mention it to him again, in which He did not yet punctually obey
him, nor avoid seasonably saying any Thing to him which He believed to be
his Duty, and which his Majesty never seemed to take ill. And whenever
He spake to him of either of the other two Gentlemen, which He frequently
did with much Kindness, He always added somewhat of Both their Respects
and Esteem for him, as a Thing that pleased him well; and said once,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
“that it concerned them, for whenever He should discern it to be other∣wise,
He should make them repent it.” Yet notwithstanding all this,
from that Time Counsels were not so secret, and greater Liberty was taken
to talk of the publick Affairs in the Evening Conversation, than had been
before, when they happened sometimes to be shortly mentioned in the Pro∣duction
of some Wit or Jest; but now they were often taken into De∣bate,
and censured with too much Liberty with Reference to Things and
Persons; and the King himself was less fixed and more irresolute in his
Counsels; and inconvenient Grants came every Day to the Seal for the Be∣nefit
of particular Persons, against which the King had particularly resolved,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and at last by Importunity would have passed. Lastly, Both these Persons
were most devoted to the Lady, and much depended upon her Interest,
and consequently were ready to do any Thing that would be grateful
to her.</P>
<P>THERE was another Mischief contrived about this Time, that had a much
worse Influence upon the Publick, except We shall call it the same, because
it did in Truth proceed from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Rise of the</HI> Dutch <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> Though the publick State of Affairs, in
Respect of the Distempers and Discomposures which are mentioned before,
and that the Expenses exceeded what was assigned to support it, whereby
the great Debt was little diminished, yielded little Delight to those who<MILESTONE N="40"/>
were most trusted to manage and provide for them, and who had a melan∣cholick
and dreadful Apprehension of Consequences: Yet whilst the Nation
continued in Peace, and without any Danger from any foreign Enemy,
the Prospect was so pleasant, especially to those who stood at a Distance,
that They saw Nothing worthy of any Man's Fear; and there was rea∣sonable
Hope, that the Expenses might every Year be reduced within rea∣sonable
Bounds. But all that Hope vanished, when there appeared an im∣moderate
Desire to engage the Nation in a War.</P>
<P>UPON the King's first Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> He manifested a very great
Desire to improve the general Traffick and Trade of the Kingdom, and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
upon all Occasions conferred with the most active Merchants upon it, and
offered all that He could contribute to the Advancement thereof. He
crected a Council of Trade, which produced little other Effect than the Op∣portunity
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
of Mens speaking together, which possibly disposed them to
think more, and to consult more effectually in private, than They could in
such a Crowd of Commissioners. Some Merchants and Seamen made a
Proposition by Mr. <HI>William Coventry</HI> and some few others to the Duke of
<HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Erection of the Royal</HI> African <HI>Com∣pany.</HI></NOTE> “for the Erection of a Company in which They desired his Royal
Highness to preside” (and from thence it was called the Royal Company),
to which his Majesty should grant the sole Trade of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which in a
short Time They presumed would bring great Advantage to the Publick,
and much Profit to the Adventurers, who should begin upon a joint
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Stock, to be managed by a Council of such as should be chosen out of the
Adventurers.”</P>
<P>THIS Privilege had before the Troubles been granted by the late King
to Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> and others named by him, who had at their own
Charge sent Ships thither: And Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> had at his own Charge bought
a Nook of Ground, that lay into the Sea, of the true Owners thereof (all
that Coast being inhabited by Heathens), and built thereon a good Fort
and Warehouses, under which the Ships lay; and He had advanced this
Trade so far before the Troubles, that He found it might be carried on with
very great Benefit. After the Rebellion began, and Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> betook
<MILESTONE N="20"/>himself to serve the King, some Merchants continued the Trade, and either
by his Consent or <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Power had the Possession of that Fort, called
<HI>Cormantine;</HI> which was still in the Possession of the <HI>English</HI> when his Ma∣jesty
returned, though the Trade was small, in Respect the <HI>Dutch</HI> had fixed
a stronger Quarter at no great Distance from it, and sent much more Ships
and Commodities thither, and returned once every Year to their own Coun∣try
with much Wealth. The chief End of this Trade was, besides the
putting off great Quantities of our own Manufactures according as the Trade
should advance, to return with Gold, which that Coast produced in good
Quantity, and with Slaves, <HI>Blacks,</HI> which were readily fold to any Planta∣tion
<MILESTONE N="30"/>at great Prices.</P>
<P>THE Model was so well prepared, and the whole Method for governing
the Trade so rationally proposed, that the Duke was much pleased with it,
and quickly procured a Charter to be granted from the King to this Com∣pany
with ample Privileges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Charter granted to it.</NOTE> and his Majesty himself to become an Adven∣turer,
and which was more, to assist them for the first Establishment of their
Trade with the Use of some of his own Ships. The Duke was the Gover∣nour
of the Company, with Power to make a Deputy: All the other Offi∣cers
and Council were chosen by the Company, which consisted of Persons
of Honour and Quality, every one of which brought in five hundred Pounds
<MILESTONE N="40"/>for the first joint Stock, with which They set out the first Ships; upon
the Return whereof They received so much Encouragement and Benefit,
that They compounded with Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> for his Propriety in the
Fort and Castle; and possessed themselves of another Place upon the
Coast, and sent many Ships thither, which made very good Returns, by
putting off their <HI>Blacks</HI> at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other the King's Plantations
at their own Prices, and brought Home such Store of Gold that adminis∣tered
the first Occasion for the Coinage of those Pieces, which from thence
had the Denomination of <HI>Guineas;</HI> and what was afterwards made of the
same Species, was coined of the Gold that was brought from that Coast by
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the Royal Company. In a Word, if that Company be not broken or dis∣ordered
by the Jealousy that the Gentlemen Adventurers have of the Mer∣chants,
and their Opinion that They understand the Mysteries of Trade as
well as the other, by which They refuse to concur in the necessary Expe∣dients
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>
proposed by the other, and interpose unskilful Overtures of their own
with Pertinacy, it will be found a Model equally to advance the Trade of
<HI>England</HI> with that of any other Company, even that of the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the first Entrance into this Trade, which the Duke was exceedingly
disposed to advance, and was constantly present himself at all Councils,
which were held once a Week in his own Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> it was
easily discovered that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had a better Trade there than the <HI>English,</HI>
which They were then willing to believe that They had no Right to, for
that the Trade was first found out and settled there by the <HI>English;</HI> which
was a sufficient Foundation to settle it upon this Nation, and to exclude all<MILESTONE N="10"/>
others, at least by the same Law that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> enjoys the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> what They or the <HI>Portuguese</HI> possessed in the <HI>East.</HI> But
this They quickly found would not establish such a Title as would bear a
Dispute: The having sent a Ship or two thither, and built a little Fort,
could not be allowed such a Possession as would exclude all other Nations.
And the Truth was; the <HI>Dutch</HI> were there some Time before us, and the
<HI>Dane</HI> before either: And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which was the true Grievance, had
planted themselves more advantageously, upon the Bank of a River, than
We had done; and by the Erection of more Forts were more strongly
seated, and drove a much greater Trade, which They did not believe They<MILESTONE N="20"/>
would be persuaded to quit.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mer∣chants desirous of a War with the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> This drew the Discourse from the Right to
the Easiness, by the Assistance of two or three of the King's Ships, to take
away all that the <HI>Dutch</HI> possessed in and about <HI>Guinea,</HI> there having
never been a Ship of War seen in those Parts; so that the Work might
be presently done, and such an Alliance made with the Natives, who did
not love the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> might be unquestionably possessed of
the whole Trade of that Country, which would be of inestimable Profit to
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Merchants took much Delight to enlarge themselves upon this Ar∣gument,
and shortly after to discourse “of the infinite Benefit that would<MILESTONE N="30"/>
accrue from a barefaced War against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> how easily They might
be subdued, and the Trade carried by the <HI>English.</HI> That <HI>Cromwell</HI> had
always beaten them, and thereby gotten the greatest Glory He had, and
brought them upon their Knees; and could totally have subdued them, if
He had not thought it more for his Interest to have such a Second,
whereby He might the better support his Usurpation against the King.
And therefore, after They had consented to all the infamous Conditions
of the total abandoning his Majesty, and as far as in them lay to the Extir∣pation
of all the Royal Family, and to a perpetual Exclusion of the Prince
of <HI>Orange,</HI> He made a firm Peace with them; which They had not yet<MILESTONE N="40"/>
performed, by their retaining still the Island of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> which They
had so long since barbarously taken from the <HI>English,</HI> and which They
had expressly promised and undertaken to deliver in the last Treaty, af∣ter
<HI>Cromwell</HI> had compelled them to pay a great Sum of Money for the
Damages which the <HI>English</HI> had sustained at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> when all the De∣mands
and Threats from King <HI>James</HI> could never procure any Satisfac∣tion
for that foul Action.”</P>
<P>THESE Discourses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>much for it.</HI></NOTE> often reiterated in Season and out of Season, made
a very deep Impression in the Duke; who having been even from his
Childhood in the Command in Armies and in his Nature inclined to the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
most difficult and dangerous Enterprises, was already weary of having so
little to do, and too impatiently longed for any War, in which He knew
He could not but have the chief Command. But these Kind of Debates,
<PB N="199" REF="204"/>
or the Place in which they were made, could contribute little to an Af∣fair
of so huge an Importance, otherwise than by inciting the Duke, which
they did too much, to consider and affect it, and to dispose others who
were near him to inculcate the same Thoughts into him, as an Argument
in which his Honour would be much exalted in the Eye of all the World:
And to these good Offices They were enough disposed by the Restlessness
and Unquietness of their own Natures, and by many other Motives for the ac∣complishing
their own Designs, and getting more Power into their own Hands.</P>
<P>BUT there was lately, very lately, a Peace fully concluded with the <HI>States
<MILESTONE N="10"/>General</HI> upon the same Terms, Articles and Conditions, which They had
formerly yielded to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> being very much more advantageous than
They had ever granted in any Treaty to the Crown. And at the Time
of the Conclusion of the Peace, They delivered their Orders from the
<HI>States General</HI> and their <HI>East-India</HI> Company for the Delivery of the Island
of <HI>Poleroone</HI> to the <HI>English,</HI> which <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself had extorted from them
with the greatest Difficulty: So that there was now no Colour of Justice
to make a War upon them. Besides that there were at present great
Jealousies from <HI>Spain</HI> upon the Marriage with <HI>Portugal;</HI> nor did <HI>France,</HI>
which had broken Promise in making a Treaty with <HI>Holland,</HI> make any
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Haste to renew the Treaty with <HI>England.</HI> And therefore it could not but
seem strange to all Men, that when We had only made a Treaty of Peace
with <HI>Holland,</HI> and that so newly, and upon so long Consideration, and
had none with either of the Crowns, We should so much desire to enter
into a War with them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Duke's Heart was set upon it, and He loved to speak of
it, and the Benefits which would attend it. He spake of it to the King,
whom He found no Ways inclined to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King not inclined to it.</NOTE> and therefore He knew it was
unfit to propose it in Council: Yet He spake often of it to such of the
Lords of whom He had the best Opinion, and found many of them to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>concur with him in the Opinion of the Advantages which might arise from
thence. And sometimes He thought He left the King disposed to it, by
an Argument which He found prevailed with many: “That the Differ∣ences
and Jealousies in Point of Trade, which did every Day fall out and
would every Day increase between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had
in the late Distractions gotten great Advantages, would unavoidably pro∣duce
a War between them; and then that the Question only was, whe∣ther
it were not better for us to begin it now, when They do not ex∣pect
it, and We are better prepared for it than probably We shall be
then; or to stay two or three Years, in which the same Jealousy would
<MILESTONE N="40"/>provoke them to be well provided, when probably We might not be
ready. That We had the best Sea Officers in the World, many of
whom had often beaten the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and knew how to do it again;
and a Multitude of excellent Mariners and common Seamen: All which,
if They found that Nothing would be done at Home, would disperse
themselves in Merchant Voyages to the <HI>Indies</HI> and the <HI>Straits;</HI> and
probably so many good Men would never be found together again.”</P>
<P>AND with such Arguments He many Times thought that He left the
King much moved: But when He spake to him again (though He knew
that He had no Kindness for the <HI>Dutch</HI>) his Majesty was changed, and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>very averse to a War; which He imputed to the Chancellor, who had not
dissembled, as often as his Highness spake to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor opposes it.</NOTE> to be passionately and ob∣stinately
against it. And He did take all the Opportunities He could find to
confirm the King in his Aversion to it, who was in his Heart averse from it,
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
by presenting to him the State of his own Affairs, “the great Debt that yet
lay upon him, which with Peace and good Husbandry might be in some
Time paid; but a War would involve him in so much greater, that
no Man could see the End of it. That He would be able to preserve
himself against the Factions and Distempers in his own Kingdom, and
probably suppress them, if He were without a foreign Enemy: But if He
should be engaged in a War abroad, his domestick Divisions, especially
those in Religion, would give him more Trouble than He could well strug∣gle
withal.”</P>
<P>“THAT it was an erroneous Assumption, <HI>that the</HI> Dutch <HI>would be better<MILESTONE N="10"/>
provided for a War two or three Years hence, and his Majesty worse,</HI> for
which there was no Reason. That within that Time it would be his own
Fault, if the Distempers in his three Kingdoms were not composed, which
would make him much fitter for a War; whereas now neither of them
could be said to be in Peace, that of <HI>Ireland</HI> being totally unsettled, and
that of <HI>Scotland</HI> not yet well pleased, and <HI>England</HI> far from it. That in
that Time it was very probable that the two Crowns would be again en∣gaged
in a War; since it was generally believed, and with great Reason,
that <HI>France</HI> only expected the Death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was very
infirm, and meant then to fall into <HI>Flanders,</HI> having at the same Time<MILESTONE N="20"/>
with great Expense provided great Magazines of Corn and Hay upon the
Borders, which could be for no other End. That whilst He continued
in Peace, his Friendship would be valuable to all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and the two Crowns would strive who should gain him: But if He en∣gaged
in a War, and in such a War as that with <HI>Holland,</HI> which would
interrupt and disturb all the Trade of the Kingdom, upon which the
greatest Part of his Revenue did rise; all other Princes would look on,
and not much esteem any Offices He could perform to them. And lastly,
that a little Time might possibly administer a just Occasion of a War,
which at present there was not.”<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THESE, and better Arguments which the King's own Understanding sug∣gested
to him, made him fully resolve against the War, and to endeavour to
change his Brother from affecting it, which wrought not at all upon him;
but finding that many Things fell from the King in the Argument, which
had been alleged to himself by the Chancellor, He concluded the Mischief
came from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of∣fended with him for it.</NOTE> and was displeased accordingly, and complained to his
Wife, “that her Father should oppose him in an Affair upon which He knew
his Heart was so much set, and of which every Body took so much No∣tice;”
which troubled her very much. And She very earnestly desired her
Father, “that He would no more oppose the Duke in that Matter.” He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
answered her, “that She did not enough understand the Consequence
of that Affair; but that He would take Notice to the Duke of what She
had said, and give him the best Answer He could.” And accordingly
He waited upon the Duke, who very frankly confessed to him, “that He
took it very unkindly, that He should so positively endeavour to cross a
Design so honourable in itself, and so much desired by the City of <HI>London;</HI>
and He was confident it would be very grateful to the Parliament, and
that They would supply the King with Money enough to carry it on,
which would answer the chief Objection. That He was engaged to pur∣sue
it, and He could not but be sorry and displeased, that every Body<MILESTONE N="50"/>
should see how little Credit He had with him.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣ler satisfies the Duke.</NOTE> “that He had no Apprehension that any so∣ber
Man in <HI>England,</HI> or his Highness himself, should believe that He
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>
could fail in his Duty to him, or that He would omit any Opportunity
to make it manifest, which He could never do without being a Fool or
a Madman. On the other Hand, He could never give an Advice, or
consent to it whoever gave it, which in his Judgment and Conscience
would be very mischievous to the Crown and to the Kingdom, though
his Royal Highness or the King himself were inclined to it.” He did
assure him, “that He found the King very averse from any Thought
of this War, before He ever discovered his own Opinion of it;” but de∣nied
not, “that He had taken all Opportunities to confirm him in that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Judgment by Arguments that He thought could not be answered; and
that the Consequence of that War would be very pernicious. That He
did presume that many good Men, with whom He had conferred, did
seem to concur with his Highness out of Duty to him, and as They saw
it would be grateful to him, or upon a sudden, and without making those
Reflections which would afterwards occur to them, and make them change
their Minds. That a few Merchants, nor all the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI>
were not the City of <HI>London,</HI> which had had War enough, and could
only become rich by Peace. That He did not think the Parliament
would be forward to encourage that War; nor should the King be de∣sirous
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that They should interpose their Advice in it, since it was a Subject
entirely in the King's own Determination: But if They should appear
never so forward in it, He was old enough to remember when a Par∣liament
did advise, and upon the Matter compel, his Grandfather King
<HI>James</HI> to enter into a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> upon Promise of ample Supplies;
and yet when He was engaged in it, They gave him no more Supply;
so that at last the Crown was compelled to accept of a Peace not very
honourable.”</P>
<P>BESIDE the Arguments He had used to the King, He besought his High∣ness
to reflect upon some others more immediately relating to himself,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>“upon the Want of able Men to conduct the Counsels upon which such a
War must be carried on; how few Accidents might expose the Crown to
those Distresses, that it might with more Difficulty be buoyed up than it
had lately been;” with many other Arguments, which He thought made
some Impression upon the Duke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Design for the present drops.</NOTE> And for some Months there was no
more Mention or Discourse in the Court of the War; though They
who first laid the Design still cultivated it, and made little Doubt of
bringing it at last to pass.</P>
<P>AT or about this Time there was a Transaction of great Importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sale of</HI> Dunkirk.</NOTE>
which at the Time was not popular nor indeed understood, and afterwards
<MILESTONE N="40"/>was objected against the Chancellor in his Misfortunes, as a principal Argu∣ment
of his Infidelity and Corruption; which was the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> The
whole Proceeding whereof shall be plainly and exactly related from the Be∣ginning
to the End thereof.</P>
<P>THE Charge and Expense the Crown was at; the Pay of the Land
Forces and Garrisons; the great Fleets set out to Sea for the Reduction of
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Pirates of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> and for guarding the narrow Seas,
and Security of the Merchants; the constant yearly Charge of the Garrison
of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> of that at <HI>Tangier,</HI> and the vast Expense of building a Mole
there, for which there was an Establishment, together with the Garrisons at
<MILESTONE N="50"/><HI>Bombayne</HI> and in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> (none of which had been known to the Crown
in former Times); and the Lord Treasurer's frequent Representation of all
this to the King, as so prodigious an Expense as could never be supported;
had put his Majesty to frequent Consultations how He might lessen and
<PB N="202" REF="207"/>
save any Part of it. But no Expedient could be resolved upon. The Lord
Treasurer, who was most troubled when Money was wanted, had many
secret Conferences with the General and with the best Seamen, of the Be∣nefit
that accrued to the Crown by keeping of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> the constant
Charge and Expense whereof amounted to above one hundred and twenty
thousand Pounds yearly: And He found by them that it was a Place of
little Importance. It is true that He had conferred of it with the Chan∣cellor,
with whom He held a fast Friendship;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor against it.</NOTE> but found him so averse
from it, that He resolved to speak with him no more, till the King had taken
some Resolution. And to that Purpose He persuaded the General to go<MILESTONE N="10"/>
with him to the King and to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> telling them Both, “that
the Chancellor must know Nothing of it:” And after several Debates the
King thought it so counsellable a Thing, that He resolved to have it debated
before that Committee which He trusted in his most secret Affairs; and the
Chancellor being then lame of the Gout, He commanded that all those Lords
should attend him at his House.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Business referred to a Committee.</NOTE> Beside his Majesty himself and the Duke
of <HI>York,</HI> there appeared the Lord Treasurer, the General, the Earl of <HI>Sand∣wich,</HI>
the Vice-Chamberlain Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> who had been a great
Commander at Sea, and the two Secretaries of State. When the King en∣tered
the Room with the Lord Treasurer, He desired his Majesty, smiling,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
“that He would take the Chancellor's Staff from him, otherwise He would
break his Head.” When They were all sate, the King told him, “They were
all come to debate an Affair that He knew He was against, which was the
parting with <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> but He did believe, when He had heard all that was
said for it and against it, He would change his Mind, as He himself had
done.” And so the Debate was entered into in this Method, after enough
was said of the Straights the Crown was in, and what the yearly Ex∣pense
was.</P>
<P>(1.) “THAT the Profit which did or could accrue to the Kingdom by
the keeping of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was very inconsiderable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons urged for parting with it.</NOTE> whether in War or<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Peace. That by Sea <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it was very little useful, it being no Harbour,
nor having Place for the King's Ships to ride in with Safety; and that if
it were in the Hand of an Enemy, it could do us little Prejudice, be∣cause
three or four Ships might block it up, and keep it from infesting
its Neighbours: And that though heretofore it had been a Place of License
at Sea, and had much obstructed Trade by their Men of War, yet that
proceeded only from the Unskilfulness of that Time in applying proper
Remedies to it; which was manifest by <HI>Cromwell's</HI> blocking them up, and
restraining them when He made War upon them, insomuch as all the Men
of War left that Place, and betook themselves to other Harbours. That it<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was so weak to the Land (notwithstanding the great Charge his Majesty
had been at in the Fortifications, which were not yet finished) by the
Situation and the Soil, that it required as many Men within to defend it,
as the Army should consist of that besieged it; otherwise that it could
never hold out and endure a Siege of two Months: As it appeared clearly
by its having been taken and retaken so many Times within the late
Years, in all which Times it never held out so long, though there was
always an Army at no great Distance to relieve it.”</P>
<P>(2.) “THAT the Charge of keeping and maintaining it, without any
Accidents from the Attempt of an Enemy, did amount unto above one<MILESTONE N="50"/>
hundred and twenty thousand Pounds by the Year, which was a Sum the
Revenue of the Crown could not supply, without leaving many other Par∣ticulars
of much more Importance unprovided for.” And this was not
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
lightly or cursorily urged; but the State of the Revenue, and the constant
and indispensable Issues, were at the same Time presented and carefully
examined.</P>
<P>(3.) “IT could not reasonably be believed, but that if <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was
kept, his Majesty would be shortly involved in a War with one of the
two Crowns. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour had already demanded Resti∣tution
of it in Point of Justice, it having been taken from his Master by
the late Usurper, in a Time when there was not only a Peace between
his Majesty and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but when his Majesty resided, and was
<MILESTONE N="10"/>entertained by the <HI>Catholick</HI> King, in <HI>Flanders:</HI> And at this Time both
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> inhibited their Subjects from paying those small Contri∣butions
to the Garrison at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and endeavoured to restrain the Go∣vernour
himself from enjoying some Privileges, which had been always
enjoyed by him from the Time that it had been put into <HI>Cromwell's</HI>
Hands.” And it was upon this and many other Reasons then conceived,
“that as it would be very hard for the King to preserve a Neutrality to∣wards
Both Crowns, even during the Time of the War between them”
(which Temper was thought very necessary for his Majesty's Affairs); “so
it would be much more difficult long to avoid a War with one of them
<MILESTONE N="20"/>upon the keeping <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> if the Peace that was newly made should re∣main
firm and unshaken.”</P>
<P>UPON these Reasons, urged and agreed upon by those who could not but
be thought very competent Judges, in Respect of their several Professions and
great Experience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣solves to dis∣pose of it.</NOTE> the King resolved to ease himself of the insupportable Bur∣den
of maintaining <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and to part with it in such a Manner as might
be most for his Advantage and Benefit. There remained then no other
Question, than into what Hand to put it: And the Measure of that
was only who would give most Money for it, there being no Inclination to
prefer one before another. It was enough understood, that Both Crowns
<MILESTONE N="30"/>would be very glad to have it, and would probably Both make large Offers for
it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reasons for selling it to</HI> France.</NOTE> But it was then as evident, that whatsoever <HI>France</HI> should contract for, the
King would be sure to receive, and the Business would be soon dispatched:
Whereas on the other Hand it was as notorious and evident to his Majesty,
and to all who had any Knowledge of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and of the
Scarcity of Money there and in <HI>Flanders;</HI> that how large Offers soever the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> might make, They could not be able in any Time to pay any
considerable Sum of Money; and that there would be so much Time spent
in Consult between <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Brussels</HI> before it could be dispatched, that
the keeping it so long in his Majesty's Hands would in the Expense disap∣point
<MILESTONE N="40"/>him of a good Part of the End in parting with it. Besides that it
seemed at that Time probable, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would shortly declare
himself an Enemy; for besides that He demanded <HI>Dunkirk</HI> as of Right, so
He likewise required the Restitution of <HI>Tangier</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> upon the same
Reason, and declared “that without it there could be no lasting Peace be∣tween
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>” and refused so much as to enter upon a
Treaty of Alliance with the King, before He should promise to make such
a Restitution.</P>
<P>THERE wanted not in this Conference and Debate the Consideration
of the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> as Persons like enough to desire
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the Possession of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> from whence They had formerly received so
much Damage, and were like enough to receive more whenever They
should be engaged in any War: And if in Truth They should have any
such Desire, more Money might be reasonably required and probably be
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
obtained from them, than could be expected from either of the Kings. But
upon the Discussion of that Point, it did appear to every Man's Reason
very manifest, that though They had rather that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be put
into the Hands of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> than delivered to <HI>France,</HI> or than it should
be detained by the <HI>English;</HI> yet They durst not receive it into their own
Possession, which neither of the two Crowns would have approved of, and
so it would have exposed them to the Displeasure if not to the Hostility of
Both the Kings.</P>
<P>UPON this full Deliberation, his Majesty inclined rather to give it up to
<HI>France</HI> than to <HI>Spain;</HI> but deferred any positive Resolution till He had im∣parted<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the whole Matter to the Council-Board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣fers it to the Privy Council.</NOTE> where the Debate was again re∣sumed,
principally, “whether it were more counsellable to keep it at so vast a
Charge, or to part with it for a good Sum of Money.” And in that Debate
the Mention of what had been heretofore done in the House of Commons upon
that Subject was not omitted, nor the Bill that They had sent up to the House
of Peers for annexing it inseparably to the Crown: But that was not thought
of Moment; for as it had been suddenly entertained in the House of Com∣mons,
upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour's first Proposition for the Restitution,
so it was looked upon in the House of Peers as unfit in itself, and so laid
aside after once being read (which had been in the first Convention soon<MILESTONE N="20"/>
after the King's Return), and so expired as soon as it was born. After a
long Debate of the whole Matter at the Council-Board, where all was
averred concerning the Uselessness and Weakness of the Place, by those who
had said it at the Committee;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where only one opposes it.</NOTE> there was but one Lord of the Council who
offered his Advice to the King against parting with it: And the Ground of
that Lord's dissenting, who was the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> was enough under∣stood
to have Nothing of publick in it, but to draw the Negotiation for it
into his own Hands. In Conclusion, his Majesty resolved to put it into the
Hands of <HI>France,</HI> if that King would comply with his Majesty's Expecta∣tion
in the Payment of so much Money as He would require for it: And a<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Way was found out, that the King might privately be advertised of that
his Majesty's Resolution, if He should have any Desire to deal for it.</P>
<P>THE Advertisement was very welcome to the <HI>French</HI> King, who was
then resolved to visit <HI>Flanders</HI> as soon as He should know of the Death of
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was expected every Day. Nor had He deferred
it till then, upon the late Affront his Ambassadour had received at <HI>London</HI>
from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour (who by a contrived and laboured Stratagem
had got the Precedence for his Coach before the other; which the King of
<HI>France</HI> received with that Indignation, that He sent presently to demand
Justice at <HI>Madrid,</HI> commanded his Ambassadour to retire from thence, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
would not suffer the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour to remain in <HI>Paris</HI> till He should
have Satisfaction, and was resolved to have begun a War upon it), if the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> had not acknowledged the Fault of his Ambassadour, and
under his Hand declared the Precedence to belong to <HI>France;</HI> which Decla∣ration
was sent to the Courts of all Princes: And so for the present that Spark
of Fire was extinguished or rather raked up.</P>
<P>THE King sent <HI>M. D'Estrades</HI> privately to <HI>London</HI> to treat about <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur D'Estrades <HI>comes over to treat about the Price.</HI></NOTE>
without any Character, but pretending to make it his Way to <HI>Holland,</HI>
whither He was designed Ambassadour. After He had waited upon the
King, his Majesty appointed four or five of the Lords of his Council, whereof<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Chancellor and Treasurer and General were three, to treat with <HI>M. D'Es∣trades</HI>
for the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> when the first Conference was spent in en∣deavouring
to persuade him to make the first Offer for the Price, which
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
He could not be drawn to: So that the King's Commissioners were obliged
to make their Demand. And They asked the Sum of seven hundred thou∣sand
Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> to be paid upon the Delivery of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI>
into the Possession of the King of <HI>France;</HI> which Sum appeared to him to
be so stupendous, that He seemed to think the Treaty at an End, and re∣solved
to make no Offer at all on the Part of his Master. And so the Con∣ference
brake up.</P>
<P>AT the next Meeting He offered three Millions of <HI>Livres,</HI> which ac∣cording
to the common Account amounted to three hundred thousand <HI>Pis∣toles,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/>which the King's Commissioners as much undervalued; so that any
farther Conference was discontinued, till He had sent an Express or two into
<HI>France,</HI> and till their Return: For as the Expectation of a great Sum of
ready Money was the King's Motive to part with it, besides the saving
the monthly Charge; so They concluded that his Necessities would oblige
him to part with it at a moderate Price. And after the Return of the
Expresses, the King's Commissioners insisting still upon what <HI>D'Estrades</HI>
thought too much, and He offering what They thought too little, the
Treaty seemed to be at an End, and He prepared for his Return. In
Conclusion, his Majesty being fully as desirous to part with it as the King
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of <HI>France</HI> could be to have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Price a∣greed upon.</NOTE> it was agreed and concluded, “that upon
the Payment of five hundred thousand <HI>Pistoles in Specie</HI> at <HI>Calais</HI> to such
Persons as the King should appoint to receive it, his Majesty's Garrison of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI> should be withdrawn, and those Places put into the
Hands of the King of <HI>France:</HI>” All which was executed accordingly.
And without Doubt it was a greater Sum of Money than was ever paid at one
Payment by any Prince in <HI>Christendom,</HI> upon what Occasion soever; and
every Body seemed very glad to see so vast a Sum of Money delivered into
the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as it was all together; the King at the same Time
declaring, “that no Part of it should be applied to any ordinary Occasion,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>but be preserved for some pressing Accident, as an Insurrection or the
like,” which was reasonably enough apprehended.</P>
<P>NOR was there the least Murmur at this Bargain in all the Sessions of the
Parliament which sate after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vindication of the Chan∣cellor in this Affair.</NOTE> until it fell out to some Mens Purposes to re∣proach
the Chancellor: And then They charged him “with advising the
Sale of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and that the very Artillery, Ammunition and Stores
amounted to a greater Value than the King received for the Whole;” when
upon an Estimate that had been taken of all those, they were not esteemed
to be more worth than twenty thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling;</HI> and the Consi∣deration
of those, when the King's Commissioners insisted upon their being
<MILESTONE N="40"/>all shipped for <HI>England,</HI> and the Necessity of keeping them upon the Place
where they were, had prevailed with <HI>M. D'Estrades</HI> to consent to that
Sum of five hundred thousand <HI>Pistoles.</HI> But whether the Bargain was ill or
well made, there could be no Fault imputed to the Chancellor, who had
no more to do in the Transaction than is before set down, the whole
Matter having been so long deliberated and so fully debated. Nor did He
ever before, or in, or after the Transaction, receive the Value of Half a
Crown for Reward or Present, or any other Consideration relating to that
Affair: And the Treatment He received after his coming into <HI>France</HI>
was Evidence enough, that that King never thought himself beholden
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to him.</P>
<P>A LITTLE before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother brings a natural Son of the King into</HI> England</NOTE> the Queen Mother returned again for <HI>England,</HI>
having disbursed a great Sum of Money in making a noble Addition to her
Palace of <HI>Somerset-House.</HI> With the Queen there came over a Youth of
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
about ten or a dozen Years of Age, who was called by the Name of Mr.
<HI>Crofts,</HI> because the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> had been trusted to take Care of his Breed∣ing;
but He was generally thought to be the King's Son, begotten upon a
private <HI>Welchwoman</HI> of no good Fame, but handsome, who had transported
herself to the <HI>Hague,</HI> when the King was first there, with a Design to ob∣tain
that Honour, which a Groom of the Bedchamber willingly preferred
her to; and there it was this Boy was born. The Mother lived afterwards
for some Years in <HI>France</HI> in the King's Sight, and at last lost his Majesty's
Favour: Yet the King desired to have the Son delivered to him, that He
might take Care of his Education, which She would not consent to. At<MILESTONE N="10"/>
last the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> got him into his Charge; and the Mother dying at
<HI>Paris,</HI> He had the sole Tuition of him, and took Care for the breeding
him suitable to the Quality of a very good Gentleman. And the Queen
after some Years came to know of it, and frequently had him brought to
her, and used him with much Grace; and upon the King's Desire brought
him with her from <HI>Paris</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> when He was about twelve Years
of Age, very handsome, and performed those Exercises gracefully which
Youths of that Age used to learn in <HI>France.</HI> The King received him with
extraordinary Fondness, and was willing that every Body should believe
him to be his Son, though He did not yet make any Declaration that He<MILESTONE N="20"/>
looked upon him as such, otherwise than by his Kindness and Familiarity
towards him. He assigned a liberal Maintenance for him; but took not
that Care for a strict Breeding of him as his Age required.</P>
<P>THE General, during the Time of his Command in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had Ac∣quaintance
with a Lady of much Honour there, the Countess of <HI>Weemes,</HI>
who had been before the Wife of the Earl of <HI>Buccleuch,</HI> and by him had
one only Daughter, who inherited his very great Estate and Title, and was
called the Countess of <HI>Buccleuch,</HI> a Child of eight or ten Years of Age.
All Men believed, that the General's Purpose was to get this Lady for his
own Son, a Match suitable enough: But the Time being now changed, the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> being a good Courtier, thought his Countrywoman
might be much better married, if She were given to the King for this
Youth, towards whom He expressed so much Fondness, those Kinds of
Extractions carrying little Disadvantage with them in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the Ge∣neral,
whatever Thoughts He had before, would not be so ill a Courtier
as not to advance such a Proposition. The Lady was already in Possession
of the greatest Fortune in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which would have a fair Addition upon
the Death of her Mother.</P>
<P>THE King liked the Motion well; and so the Mother was sent to, to
bring up her Daughter to <HI>London,</HI> They being then Both in <HI>Scotland.</HI> And<MILESTONE N="40"/>
when They came, the King trusted the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> principally to
treat that Affair with the Mother, who had rather have been referred to any
other Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is contract∣ed to the Countess of</HI> Buccleuch.</NOTE> having indeed some just Exceptions. They were Both yet
under the Years of Consent; but that Time drawing on, such a Contract
was drawn up as had been first proposed to the King, which was, “that
the whole Estate, for Want of Issue by the young Lady, or by her Death,
should be devolved upon the young Man who was to marry her, and his
Heirs for ever; and that this should be settled by Act of Parliament in
<HI>Scotland.</HI>” Matters being drawn to this Length, and Writings being to
be prepared, it was now necessary that this young Gentleman must have a<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Name, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Advocate had prepared a Draught, in which He was
styled the King's natural Son: And the King was every Day pressed by the
great Lady, and those young Men who knew the Customs of <HI>France,</HI> to
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
create him a Nobleman of <HI>England;</HI> and was indeed very willing to be
advised to that Purpose.</P>
<P>TILL this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con∣sults the Chan∣cellor about this Son.</NOTE> this whole Matter was treated in secret amongst the
<HI>Scots:</HI> But now the King thought fit to consult it with others; and telling
the Chancellor of all that had past, shewed him the Draught prepared by
the <HI>Scots</HI> Advocate, and asked him “what He thought of it,” and likewise
implied “that He thought fit to give him some Title of Honour.” After
He had read it over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Advice.</NOTE> He told his Majesty, “that He need not give him any
other Title of Honour than He would enjoy by his Marriage, by which
<MILESTONE N="10"/>He would by the Law of <HI>Scotland</HI> be called Earl of <HI>Buccleuch,</HI> which
would be Title enough; and He desired his Majesty to pardon him, if
He found Fault with and disliked the Title They had given him who
prepared that Draught, wherein They had presumed to style him the
King's natural Son, which was never, at least in many Ages, used in
<HI>England,</HI> and would have an ill Sound in <HI>England</HI> with all his People,
who thought that those unlawful Acts ought to be concealed, and not
published and justified. That <HI>France</HI> indeed had, with Inconvenience
enough to the Crown, raised some Families of those Births; but it was
always from Women of great Quality, and who had never been tainted
<MILESTONE N="20"/>with any other Familiarity. And that there was another Circumstance
required in <HI>Spain,</HI> which his Majesty should do well to observe in this
Case, if He had taken a Resolution in the Main; which was, that the
King took Care for the good Education of that Child whom He believed
to be his, but never publickly owned or declared him to be such, till He
had given some notable Evidence of his inheriting or having acquired such
Virtues and Qualities, as made him in the Eyes of all Men worthy of
such a Descent. That this Gentleman was yet young, and not yet to be
judged of: And therefore if He were for the present married to this
young Lady, and assumed her Title as He must do, his Majesty might
<MILESTONE N="30"/>defer for some Years making any such Declaration; which He might do
when He would, and which at present would be as unpopular an Action
in the Hearts of his Subjects as He could commit.”</P>
<P>THOUGH the King did not seem to concur in all that was said, He did
not appear at all offended, and only asked him, “whether He had not
conferred with the Queen his Mother upon that Subject.” When He
assured him “He had not, nor with any other Person, and though He had
heard some general Discourse of his Majesty's Purpose to make that Mar∣riage,
He had never heard either of the other Particulars mentioned;” the
King said, “He had Reason to ask the Question, because many of those
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Things which He had said had been spoken to him by the Queen his Mo∣ther,
who was entirely of his Opinion, which She used not to be;” and
concluded, “that He would confer with them together,” seeming for the
present to be more moved and doubtful in the Matter of the Declaration,
than in the other of the Creation; and said, “there was no Reason,
since She brought all the Estate, that She should receive no Addition by
her Husband.” The Queen afterwards took an Occasion to speak at large
to the Chancellor of it with much Warmth, and Manifestation that She did
not like it. But the King spake with neither of them afterwards upon it,
but signed the Declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pub∣lickly owns his Son, and creates him Duke of</HI> Mon∣mouth.</NOTE> and created him to be Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>very few Persons dissuading it, and the Lady employing all her Cre∣dit
to bring it to pass: And the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> (who in those difficult
Cases was usually consulted) pressed it as the only Way to make the King's
Friendship valuable.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="213"/>
SINCE the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> is mentioned upon this Occasion, it will not be
unseasonable to give him the next Part in this Relation. Though He had
left no Way unattempted to render himself gracious to the King, by saying
and doing all that might be acceptable unto him, and contriving such
Meetings and Jollities as He was pleased with; and though his Majesty had
been several Ways very bountiful to him, and had particularly given him at one
Time ten thousand Pounds in Money, with which He had purchased <HI>Wim∣bleton</HI>
of the Queen, and had given him <HI>Ashdown-Forest</HI> and other Lands
in <HI>Sussex:</HI> Yet He found He had not that Degree of Favour and Interest
in the King's Affections, as He desired, or desired that other People should<MILESTONE N="10"/>
think He had. The Change of his Religion kept him from being admitted
to the Council, or to any Employment of Moment. And whereas He made
no Doubt of drawing the whole Dependance of the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> upon
himself, and to have the Disposal of that Interest, and to that Purpose had
the <HI>Jesuits</HI> firm to him; He found that He had no Kind of Credit with
them, nor was admitted by them to their most secret Consultations, and
that the Fathers of the Society had more Enemies than Friends amongst the
<HI>Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Estate had been sold and settled by his own Consent, upon the
Marriage of his eldest Son twice to great Fortunes: So that when He re∣turned<MILESTONE N="20"/>
from beyond the Seas, He could not return to his Estate as others
did, and had little more to subsist upon than the King's Bounty; and that
was not poured out upon him in the Measure He wished, though few Per∣sons
tasted more of it. He was in his Nature very covetous, and ready to
embrace all Ways that were offered to get Money, whether honourable or
no, for He had not a great Power over himself, and could not bear Want,
which He could hardly avoid, for He was nothing provident in his Ex∣penses,
when He had any Temptation from his Ambition or Vanity. Be∣sides,
his Appetitite to Play and Gaming, in which He had no Skill, and by
which He had all his Life spent whatever He could get, was not at all<MILESTONE N="30"/>
abated. He spent as much Money at <HI>Wimbleton</HI> in building and garden∣ing,
as the Land was worth.</P>
<P>BY all these Means He found himself in Streights, which He could nei∣ther
endure nor get from, and which transported him to that Degree, that
He resolved to treat the King in another Manner than He had ever yet pre∣sumed
to do. And having asked somewhat of him that his Majesty did
not think fit to grant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Bristol's <HI>ex∣travagant Be∣haviour to the King.</HI></NOTE> He told him, “He knew well the Cause of his with∣drawing
his Favour from him; that it proceeded only from the Chancel∣lor,
who governed him and managed all his Affairs, whilst himself spent
his Time only in Pleasures and Debauchery:” And in this Passion upbraided<MILESTONE N="40"/>
him with many Excesses, to which no Man had contributed more than He
had done. He said many Truths which ought to have been more mo∣destly
and decently mentioned, and all this in the Presence of the Lord
<HI>Aubigny,</HI> who was as much surprised as the King; and concluded, “that if
He did not give him Satisfaction within such a Time” (the Time allowed
did not exceed four and twenty Hours), “He would do somewhat that
would awaken him out of his Slumber, and make him look better to his
own Business;” and added many Threats against the Chancellor. The
King stood all this Time in such Confusion, that though He gave him
more sharp Words than were natural to him, He had not that Presentness<MILESTONE N="50"/>
of Mind (as He afterwards accused himself) as He ought to have had; and
said, “He ought presently to have called for the Guard,” it being in his
own Closet, “and sent him to the <HI>Tower.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="214"/>
THE Court and the Town was full of the Discourse that the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI>
would accuse the Chancellor of High Treason, who knew Nothing of what
had passed with the King. And it seems when the Time was passed that
He prescribed to the King to give him Satisfaction, He came one Morning
to the House of Peers with a Paper in his Hand; and told the Lords,
that He could not but observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He accuses the Chancel∣lor of High Treason.</NOTE> that after so glorious a Return with which
God had blessed the King and the Nation, so that all the World had ex∣pected,
that the Prosperity of the Kingdom would have far exceeded the
Misery and Adversity that it had for many Years endured; and after
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the Parliament had contributed more towards it, than ever Parliament had
done: Notwithstanding all which, it was evident to all Men, and la∣mented
by those who wished well to his Majesty, that his Affairs grew
every Day worse and worse; the King himself lost much of his Honour,
and the Affection He had in the Hearts of the People. That for his
Part He looked upon it with as much Sadness as any Man, and had made
Enquiry as well as He could from whence this great Misfortune, which
every Body was sensible of, could proceed; and that He was satisfied in
his own Conscience, that it proceeded principally from the Power and
Credit and sole Credit of the Chancellor: And therefore He was resolved, for
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Good of his Country, to accuse the Lord Chancellor of High Treason;
which He had done in the Paper which He desired might be read, all
written with his own Hand, to which He subscribed his Name.”</P>
<P>THE Paper contained many Articles, which He called <HI>Articles of High
Treason and other Misdemeanors;</HI> amongst which one was, “that He had
persuaded the King to send a Gentleman (a Creature of his own) to <HI>Rome</HI>
with Letters to the Pope, to give a Cardinal's Cap to the Lord <HI>Aubigny,</HI>
who was Almoner to the Queen.” The rest contained “his assuming to
himself the Government of all publick Affairs, which He had admi∣nistered
unskilfully, corruptly and traiterously; which He was ready
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to prove.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, without any Trouble in his Countenance, told the
Lords, “that He had had the Honour heretofore to have so much the good
Opinion and Friendship of that Lord, that He durst appeal to his own
Conscience, that He did not himself believe one of those Articles to be
true, and knew the contrary of most of them. And He was glad to find
that He thought it so high a Crime to send to <HI>Rome,</HI> and to desire a Car∣dinal's
Cap for a Catholick Lord, who had been always bred from his
Cradle in that Faith: But He did assure them, that that Gentleman was
only sent by the Queen to the Pope, upon an Affair that She thought
<MILESTONE N="40"/>herself obliged to comply with him in, and in Hope to do some good Of∣fice
to <HI>Portugal;</HI> and that the King had neither writ to the Pope, nor to
any other Person in <HI>Rome.</HI>” He spake at large to most of the Articles,
to shew the Impossibility of their being true, and that they reflected more
upon the King's Honour than upon his; and concluded, “that He was
sorry that Lord had not been better advised, for He did believe that
though all that was alleged in the Articles should be true, they would
not all amount to High Treason, upon which He desired the Judges
might be required to deliver their Opinion;” the which the Lords or∣dered
the Judges to do. It was moved by one of the Lords, “that the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Copy of the Articles might be sent to the King, because He was men∣tioned
so presumptuously in them;” which was likewise agreed; and the
Articles were delivered to the Lord Chamberlain to present to the King.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215"/>
THE Chancellor had promised that Day to dine in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> but would
not presume to go thither till He had sent to the King, not thinking it fit
to go into his Court, whilst He lay under an Accusation of High Treason,
without his Leave. His Majesty sent him Word, “that He should dine
where He had appointed, and as soon as He had dined that He should
attend him.” Then his Majesty told him and the Lord Treasurer all
that had passed between the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> and him in the Presence of the
Lord <HI>Aubigny;</HI> and in the Relation of it expressed great Indignation, and
was angry with himself “that He had not immediately sent him to the
<HI>Tower,</HI> which” He said “He would do as soon as He could apprehend<MILESTONE N="10"/>
him.” He used the Chancellor with much Grace, and told him, “that
the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> had not treated him so ill as He had done his Ma∣jesty;
and that his Articles were more to his Dishonour, and reflected
more upon him, for which He would have Justice.”</P>
<P>HIS Majesty commanded the Lord Chamberlain to return his Thanks to
the House, “for the Respect They had shewed to him in sending those Ar∣ticles
to him;” and to let them know, “that He looked upon them as
a Libel against himself more than a Charge against the Chancellor, who
upon his Knowledge was innocent in all the Particulars charged upon
him;” which Report the Lord Chamberlain made the next Morning to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the House: And at the same Time the Judges declared their Opinion una∣nimously,
“that the whole Charge contained Nothing of Treason though
it were all true.” Upon which the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> especially upon what
the Lord Chamberlain had reported from the King, appeared in great Con∣fusion,
and lamented his Condition, “that He, for endeavouring to serve his
Country upon the Impulsion of his Conscience, was discountenanced, and
threatened with the Anger and Displeasure of his Prince; whilst his Adversary
kept his Place in the House, and had the Judges so much at his Devotion that
They would not certify against him.” The Chancellor moved the House,
that a short Day might be given to the Earl, to bring in his Evidence to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
prove the several Matters of his Charge; otherwise that He might have
such Reparation, as was in their Judgments proportionable to the Indig∣nity.”
The Earl said, “He should not fail to produce Witnesses to prove
all He had alleged, and more: But that He could not appoint a Time
when He could be ready for a Hearing, because many of his most im∣portant
Witnesses were beyond the Seas, some at <HI>Paris,</HI> and others in
other Places; and that He must examine the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> who was
Lieutenant in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> who was then in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and must desire Commissioners to that Purpose.”</P>
<P>BUT from that Day He made no farther Instance:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Bristol <HI>ab∣sconds upon the King's Warrant to apprehend him.</HI></NOTE> And understanding<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that the King had given Warrants to a Sergeant at Arms to apprehend
him, He concealed himself in several Places for the Space of near two
Years; sending sometimes Letters and Petitions by his Wife to the King,
who would not receive them. But in the End his Majesty was prevailed
with by the Lady and Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> to see him in private; but would
not admit him to come to the Court, nor repeal his Warrants for his Ap∣prehension:
So that He appeared not publickly till the Chancellor's Mis∣fortune;
and then He came to the Court and to the Parliament in great
Triumph, and shewed a more impotent Malice than was expected from his
Generosity and Understanding.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>WE shall in the next Place take a View of <HI>Scotland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> whither We left
<HI>Middleton</HI> sent the King's Commissioner, who performed his Part with won∣derful
Dexterity and Conduct, and with more Success than some of his Coun∣trymen
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>
were pleased with. We have remembered before the Debate upon
his Instructions, and the earnest Advice and Caution given by <HI>Lauther∣dale</HI>
against any hasty Attempt to make Alteration in the Matters of
the Church, which was at last left to the Discretion of the Commissioner,
to proceed in such a Manner, and at such a Time, as He found most con∣venient.
As soon as He came thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commis∣sioner well re∣ceived.</NOTE> He found himself received with
as universal an Exclamation, and the King's Authority as cheerfully sub∣mitted
to, as can be imagined or could be wished; and such a Consent to
every Thing He proposed, that He made no Question but any Thing his
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Majesty required would find an entire Obedience. The Earl of <HI>Glencarne</HI>
who was Chancellor, and the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and all the Nobility of any
Interest or Credit, were not only faithful to the King but fast Friends to
<HI>Middleton,</HI> and magnified his Conduct in all their Letters.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> alone who was Treasurer, which is an Office
that cannot be unattended by a great Faction in that Kingdom, retained
still his rigid Affection for the Presbytery, when the Ministers themselves
grew much less rigid, and were even ashamed of the many Follies and
Madnesses They had committed. But the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> did all He
could to raise their Spirits, and to keep them firm to the Kirk. In all
<MILESTONE N="20"/>other Particulars He was full of Devotion to the King, being entirely of the
Faction of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and nearly allied to it; and when the King was in
<HI>Scotland</HI> had served him signally, and had then been made by him High
Treasurer of that Kingdom; and upon <HI>Cromwell's</HI> prevailing and Conjunc∣tion
with <HI>Argyle,</HI> was as odious as any Man to them Both, and had for
many Years been Prisoner in <HI>England</HI> till the Time of the King's Return.
There was always a great Friendship between him and <HI>Lautherdale;</HI> the
former being a Man of much the greater Interest, and of unquestionable
Courage; the other excelling him in all the Faculties which are necessary
to Business, and being a Master in Dissimulation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>MIDDLETON, and the Lords who went with him, and the General (upon
whose Advice the King depended as much in the Business of <HI>Scotland</HI>)
were all earnest with his Majesty to remove the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> from
that great Office, which would enable him to do Mischief. But the
King's good Nature prevailed over him, though He knew him as well as
They did: And He thought it too hardhearted a Thing to remove a
Man, whom He found a Prisoner for his Service, from an Office He had
formerly conferred upon him for his Merit, and which He had not for∣feited
by any Miscarriage. And it may be it was some Argument to him
of his Sincerity, that when others, who to his Majesty's own Knowledge
<MILESTONE N="40"/>were as rigid <HI>Presbyterians</HI> as He, were now very frank in renouncing and
disclaiming all Obligations from it, He of all the Nobility was the only
Man who still adhered to it, when it was evident to him that He should
upon the Matter be undone by it. However the King sent him down with
the rest into <HI>Scotland,</HI> being confident that He would do Nothing to dis∣serve
him, as in Truth He never did; and resolved that, when the Business
of the Church came to be agitated, if He did continue still refractory, He
would take the Staff from him, and confer it upon <HI>Middleton:</HI> Who,
though all Things were very fair between him and <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> to whom
all his Dispatches must be addressed, yet depended more upon those of
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the <HI>English</HI> Council, to whom the King had required the Secretary to
communicate all that He received from the Commissioner, and all the
Dispatches which He should make to him. And by this Means no Or∣ders
were sent from the King which restrained him from proceeding in the
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
Matter of the Church according to Discretion, as He was appointed by his
Instructions; though <HI>Lautherdale</HI> did not dissemble, when Letters came
from <HI>Scotland</HI> “of the good Posture the King's Affairs were in there, and
that any Thing might be brought to pass that He desired,” to receive
other Letters to which He gave more Credit; and was still as solicitous that
Nothing might be attempted with Reference to the Kirk.</P>
<P>As soon as the Parliament was convened at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proceedings of the</HI> Scotch <HI>Parliament.</HI></NOTE> and the Com∣missioner
found the Temper of them to be such as He could wish, the
Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> (who had been sent by Sea from the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> to
<HI>Leith</HI>) was brought to his Trial upon many Articles of Treason and Mur∣der;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Argyle <HI>tried, condemned and executed.</HI></NOTE><MILESTONE N="10"/>
wherein all his Confederacies with <HI>Cromwell</HI> were laid open, and much
insisted upon to prove his being privy to the Resolution of taking the King's
Life, and advising it: And though there was great Reason to suspect it,
and most Men believed it, the Proofs were not clear enough to convict
him. But then the Evidence was so full and clear of so many horrid Mur∣ders
committed by his Order upon Persons in his Displeasure, and his im∣mediate
possessing himself of their Estates, and other monstrous and un∣heard
of Acts of Oppression; that the Parliament condemned him to be
hanged upon a Gallows of an unusual Height, and in or near the Place
where He had caused the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> to be formerly executed:<MILESTONE N="20"/>
All which was performed the same Day with the universal Joy of the Peo∣ple;
the unfortunate Person himself shewing more Resolution and Courage
than was expected from him, and expressing much Affection and Zeal for
the <HI>Covenant,</HI> for which He desired all Men should believe He was put to
Death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gilaspy <HI>a Fa∣natick exe∣cuted.</HI></NOTE> There was likewise one seditious Preacher, <HI>Gilaspy,</HI> who had
been a notorious and malicious Rebel against the last and the present King,
underwent the same Trial and Judgment, with the same Faith in the <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI>
and without Shew of Repentance. And it was much wondered at,
that no more of that Tribe, which had kindled the Fire that had almost
burned two Kingdoms, and never had endeavoured to extinguish it, were<MILESTONE N="30"/>
ever brought to Justice; and that the Lives of two Men should be thought
a sufficient Sacrifice for that Kingdom to offer for all the Mischief it
had done.</P>
<P>WHEN this Work was done, the Parliament without Hesitation repealed
all those Acts prejudicial to the Crown and the Royal Dignity, which had
been made since the Beginning of the Rebellion, and upon which all the
Rebellions had been founded; and branded their beloved <HI>Covenant</HI> with all
the Reproaches it deserved, and this even with the Consent and Approba∣tion
of the General Assembly of the Kirk. By all which the Obstructions
were removed; and it was now in the Power of the King to make Bishops<MILESTONE N="40"/>
as heretofore, and to settle the Church in the same Government to which
it had formerly been subject. But the Commissioner thought not this
enough; and apprehended that the King might yet be persuaded, though
there was no such Appearance, “that the People were against it, and that
it would be better to defer it:”<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment petition the King to restere Episcopacy.</NOTE> And therefore the Parliament prepared a
Petition to the King, highly aggravating the Wickedness of the former
Time in destroying Episcopacy, without which They could not have
brought their wicked Devices to pass; and therefore They were humble
Suitors to his Majesty, “that He would make Choice of such grave Di∣vines,
as He thought fit to be consecrated Bishops, for all the vacant Sees,”<MILESTONE N="50"/>
they being at that Time all vacant, there being not one Bishop of the
Nation alive.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="218"/>
AND the Commissioner having declared that He meant to prorogue the
Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They prepare an Abjuration of the</HI> Cove∣nant.</NOTE> They appointed a Draught of an Oath or Subscription to be
prepared against the next Session, whereby every Man, who was possessed
of a Church or any other Ecclesiastical Promotion in that Kingdom,
should be bound to renounce the <HI>Covenant</HI> upon the Penalty of being
deprived; intimating likewise, that They resolved, at the next Meeting
“that no Man should be capable of holding any Office, or of being a
Privy Counsellor, who would not formally subscribe the same.”</P>
<P>THEY settled a standing Militia of forty thousand Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And settle a standing Force.</NOTE> to be always
<MILESTONE N="10"/>ready to march upon the King's Orders; and raised two good Troops of
Horse, and provided for the Payment of them; and granted such a Sum of
Money to the King, as could be reasonably expected from so poor and har∣rassed
a Country, and which would serve the desraying the necessary Ex∣penses
thereof. And all this being done, and the Prorogation made, the
Commissioner and some of the other Lords came to <HI>London</HI> to kiss the
King's Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis∣sioner returns to</HI> London.</NOTE> and to receive his farther Directions, having so fully dis∣patched
all his former Orders. They brought likewise with them some
other Propositions, which will be mentioned anon.</P>
<P>THE King received the Commissioner with open Arms, and was very
<MILESTONE N="20"/>well pleased with all that He had done; and Nobody seemed to magnify it
more than <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who was least satisfied with it. Nor could He
now longer oppose the making of Bishops there: So having presented the
Names of such Persons to the King who were thought fit to be consecrated
Bishops, whereof some had been with his Majesty abroad, They were all
sent for to <HI>London;</HI> and such of them who had not before received their
Ordination from a Bishop, but from the Presbytery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof the
Archbishop of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> was one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch <HI>Bishops consecrated.</HI></NOTE> first received Orders of Deacon and
Priest from the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and were afterwards consecrated in the
usual Form by the Bishops who were then near the Town, and made so
<MILESTONE N="30"/>great a Feast as if it had been at the Charge of their Country.</P>
<P>THE Commissioner, the Chancellor, the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> and others, with
the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> were deputed by the Parliament to be humble Suitors
to the King; “since They had performed on their Part all that was of the
Duty of good Subjects, and were ready to give any other Testimony of
their Obedience that his Majesty would require; and since the whole
Kingdom was entirely at his Devotion, and in such a Posture that They
were able as well as willing to preserve the Peace thereof, and to suppress
any seditious Party that should attempt any Disturbance; that his Ma∣jesty
would now remove the <HI>English</HI> Garrisons from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scotch <HI>desire the</HI> Eng∣lish Garrisons may be <HI>with∣drawn.</HI></NOTE> and permit
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the Fortifications and Works, which had been erected at a vast Charge,
to be demolished, that there might remain no Monuments of the Slavery
They had undergone.” And this They demanded as in Justice due to
them, “since there were few Men now alive, none in the least Power, who
had contributed to the Ills which had been committed; and all the Men
of Power had undergone for ten or a dozen Years as great Oppression as
could be put upon them, because They would not renounce their Fide∣lity
to the King: And since it had pleased God to restore his Majesty,
They hoped He would not continue those Yokes and Shackles upon them,
which had been prepared and put upon them to keep them from return∣ing
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to their Allegiance.”</P>
<P>THIS was proposed in the Presence of those of the <HI>English</HI> Council, who
had been formally admitted to be of the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and conti∣nued
to meet upon that Affair. The <HI>Scots</HI> Lords enlarged with much
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>
Warmth “upon the intolerable Oppression that Nation had undergone, on
the Poverty They still suffered, and the Impossibility of being able to
bear any Part of the Charge, and the Jealousy that it would keep up be∣tween
the Nations, which could not be to the King's Profit and Conve∣nience.”
They had privately spoken before with the King upon it, and
had prevailed with him to think what They desired had Reason and Jus∣tice
in it; and the <HI>English</HI> Lords could not upon the sudden, and with∣out
Conference together, resolve what was fit for them to say: So that
They desired, without expressing any Inclination in the Matter, “that the
Debate might be put off to another Day;” which the <HI>Scots</HI> took very<MILESTONE N="10"/>
ill, as if the very deferring it were an Argument that They thought it might
be denied. But when They saw They would not presently speak to it,
They were content that another Day should be appointed for the Conside∣ration
of it: And They afterwards desired the King, “that He would call
the Committee of the <HI>English</HI> Council, who used to attend him in the
most secret Affairs, to consult what was to be done.” Nobody could
deny but that the <HI>Scots</HI> had Reason to demand it. And They who thought
it a Bridle fit to keep in their Mouths, to restrain them from future Rebel∣lions
which They might be inclined to, could not easily resolve what An∣swer
should be given to them in the Negative. And They who thought<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the Demand to be so just and reasonable, and so much for the King's Be∣nefit
and Advantage, that it ought to be granted, did believe likewise that
it was a Thing so capable of Censure and Reproach, in Regard of the ge∣neral
Prejudice which the <HI>English</HI> have against that People, that no parti∣cular
Person was able to bear the Odium of the Advice; nor that the King
himself should take the Resolution upon himself without very mature De∣liberation.</P>
<P>THAT which advanced the Proposition as fit to be granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Circum∣stances that facilitate their Request.</NOTE> was the
Charge of maintaining those Forces; which that Kingdom was so incapable
of bearing, that <HI>Middleton</HI> and <HI>Glencarne</HI> (whose Duties and entire Devo∣tion<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to the King were above all Exception or Suspicion) declared not only
to the King, but to those of the Lords with whom They would confer
freely, “that if the King thought it necessary to keep that People still
there, He must send more Forces of Horse and Foot thither; otherwise
They were not strong enough to subdue the whole Kingdom, but would
as soon as They stirred out of their Garrisons be knocked in the Head;
nor would the Country pay any Thing towards their Support, but
what should be extorted by Force: So that his Majesty would not be
thought to possess that Kingdom in Peace, which otherwise He would
unquestionably do.”<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>AND this Consideration was improved by the Reflection upon the Body of
Men of which those Forces consisted, which was a Parcel of the worst affected
Men to the King of the whole Army, and which the General had therefore
left in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when He marched into <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of
Major General <HI>Morgan</HI> (who was worthy of any Trust), because He was
not sure enough of their Fidelity to take them with him, yet thought them sit
enough to be left to restrain the <HI>Scots</HI> from any sudden Insurrection. But now
They saw all their Model brought to Confusion, They were not so much above
Temptation, but that They might, especially if They were drawn together,
concur in any desperate Design with a discontented Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or<MILESTONE N="50"/>
with their Brethren of the disbanded Army of <HI>England,</HI> who at that Sea∣son
had rebellious Resolutions in the <HI>North.</HI> And which was of no small
Importance, there was at this very Time an Opportunity to transport all
<PB N="215" REF="220"/>
those Forces (the very disbanding wherof would not be without Danger for
the Reasons aforesaid) to <HI>Portugal,</HI> in Compliance with the King's Obliga∣tion
upon his Marriage.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, it was very notorious that the People generally through∣out
<HI>England,</HI> of what Quality soever, a few <HI>London Presbyterians</HI> ex∣cepted,
were marvellously pleased to see the <HI>Scots</HI> so admirably chastised and
yoked; nor had <HI>Cromwell</HI> ever done an Act that more reconciled the Af∣fections
of the <HI>English</HI> to him, than his most rigorous Treatment of that
Nation: And They never contributed Money so willingly towards any of
<MILESTONE N="10"/>his Designs, as for the erecting those Forts in the several Quarters of the
Kingdom; which, with a little Addition of Force, They had good Expe∣rience
would suffice to keep it from giving any Disturbance to their Neigh∣bours.
And the demolishing all those Structures in one Instant, and leav∣ing
an unquiet and an impoverished People to their own Inclinations, could
not be grateful.</P>
<P>THE King had, during the Time that He resided in <HI>Scotland</HI> before his
March to <HI>Worcester,</HI> contracted, and had brought with him from thence,
a perfect Detestation of their Kirk and Presbyterian Government, and a
great Prejudice against the whole Family of <HI>Argyle</HI> and some other Persons.
<MILESTONE N="20"/>But He was exceedingly reconciled to the Nation; and besides the Esteem
He had of the Persons of very many Noblemen, He did really believe the
Burgesses and common People to be as heartily affected to him, and as
much at his Disposal, as any Subjects He had. And the Lord <HI>Lautherdale</HI>
cultivated this gracious Credulity with so much Diligence, that He assured
the King, “that He might depend upon the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation as upon one
Man, to be employed in his Service and Commands of what Kind soever,
and against what Enemy soever.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King for it.</NOTE> His Majesty upon the Debate of this Busi∣ness
declared, “that He did not only think it good Husbandry in Respect of
the Expense, and good Policy, that He might keep <HI>Scotland</HI> entirely at his
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Devotion, whilst <HI>Ireland</HI> remained in this Confusion, and <HI>England</HI> itself
was threatened by such Factions in Religion, to gratify them in what They
desired; but that He held himself obliged in Honour, Justice and Con∣science,
to send all the Forces out of that Kingdom, and to deface the
Monuments of that Time: And that there would be no more to be con∣sulted,
but what to do with those Forces” (which was quickly resolved,
that They should be all sent for <HI>Portugal;</HI> and Order was presently given
for Ships upon which They were to be embarked), “and then to consider in
what Method the other should be done.”</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> were very well satisfied with the King's Resolution upon the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Main, but troubled at somewhat that the <HI>English</HI> Lords proposed for the Way,
that the Privy Council first, “and then the Parliament, should be informed
of his Majesty's Intentions: Which,” They said, “would be against the
Honour and the Interest and the Right of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which never submitted
any of their Concernments to be debated at the Council-Board of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and the Innovation would be no less in remitting it to the Parlia∣ment,
which had no Pretence of Jurisdiction over them.” To Both which
They were answered, “that the withdrawing the <HI>English</HI> Forces, and de∣molishing
the <HI>English</HI> Fortifications, concerned <HI>England</HI> no less than the
other Kingdom; and that his Majesty did not intend it should be pro∣posed
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to them, as a Thing of which He made any Doubt or required their
Advice, but only as a Matter of Fact, which would prevent all Murmur∣ings
or Censures, which otherwise might arise.” The <HI>English</HI> Lords de∣sired,
“that the King's Orders might be very positive, and that the Com∣missioner
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
might see them executed, for the utter demolishing all those
Fortifications which the <HI>English</HI> were to abandon, that they might not
be continued for the Entertainment of new Garrisons of the Natives,
which would administer Matter of new Jealousies:” All which They cheer∣fully
consented to, well knowing that They might afterwards perform
what They found convenient; and many did since believe, that there
remains enough in some of the Places to be Shelter to a Rebellion
hereafter.</P>
<P>THE King appointed the Chancellor to make a Relation, at a Conference
between the two Houses of Parliament, “of the good Posture his Majesty's<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> stood in; of their having repealed all those ill Laws
which had been made by the Advantage of the Rebellion, and all that
concerned the Church; upon which that his Majesty forthwith resolved to
settle Bishops in that Kingdom, which appeared very unanimously devoted
to his Service: And that the King could not but communicate this good
News to them, which He knew would give them Cause of rejoicing.”
And then He told them, “that the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, in Regard of the Peace
and Quiet that They enjoyed, without the least Apprehension of Trouble
from abroad or at Home, had desired the King, <HI>that the</HI> English <HI>Forces
might be withdrawn and all the Fortifications razed;</HI> and that those Forces<MILESTONE N="20"/>
might be convenient, if his Majesty thought fit, to be transported to <HI>Por∣tugal;</HI>”
without discovering what his Majesty had resolved to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>Parliament do not oppose it.</HI></NOTE> or ask∣ing
any Opinion from them, which however They might have given if
They pleased. The Effect was, that Both Houses sent their humble Thanks
to the King “for his having vouchsafed to let them know the good Condi∣tion
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which They wished his Majesty much Joy; and hoped
his other Dominions would in a short Time be in the same Tranquillity:”
Without taking any Notice of withdrawing the Garrisons. And so that
Affair ended.</P>
<P>DURING this Agitation in <HI>London,</HI> it was discernable enough that there<MILESTONE N="30"/>
were great Jealousies between the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords. The Commissioner and
the other had Cause to believe, that the King gave much more Credit to
<HI>Lautherdale</HI> than to them, and looked upon him as a Man of great Interest
in that Country, when They knew He had none, being neither in his Qua∣lity
or Fortune amongst those who were esteemed Men of Power and De∣pendance.
And He thought them linked in a Faction against him, to lessen
the Value the King had of him, which indeed was the Foundation of all
his Credit and Interest. What Countenance soever He set upon it, He was
sensibly afflicted at the Downfal of the Presbytery, and that <HI>Middleton</HI> had
brought that to pass without any Difficulty (as He had before told the King<MILESTONE N="40"/>
He would), which He had assured his Majesty was impossible to be effected
but in long Time and by many Stratagems.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had been a Man universally odious to the
whole Nation, some Ministers and Preachers excepted: And there had been
always thought to have been an implacable Animosity from <HI>Lautherdale</HI>
towards him; and after the King's Return no Man had appeared more
against him, nor more insisted upon his not being admitted to his Majesty's
Presence, or for his being sent into <HI>Scotland</HI> to be tried. Yet after all this
it was discovered, that He had interposed all He could with his Majesty to
save him, and employed all his Interest in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the same Purpose.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
And the Marquis was no sooner executed, but the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> had
prevailed with the King immediately to give his Son the Lord <HI>Lorne</HI> (who
<PB N="217" REF="222"/>
had remained in <HI>London</HI> to solicit on his Father's Behalf) Leave to kiss his
Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Lorne <HI>restored, and created Earl of</HI> Argyle.</NOTE> and to create him Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and to confer on him the Office
of General Justice in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> by which his Father had been qualified
to do most of the Wickednesses He had committed; all which the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Scotland</HI> should have treated as the most sensible Affront to them
that They could undergo.</P>
<P>IT was well known that this young Man, who was Captain of the King's
Guard when He was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had treated his Majesty with that Rude∣ness
and Barbarity, that He was much more odious to him than his Fa∣ther;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and in all the Letters which <HI>Lautherdale</HI> had found Opportunity to
write, whilst He was a Prisoner in <HI>England,</HI> to the King when He was be∣yond
the Seas, He inveighed equally against the Son as the Father, and
never gave him any other Title than THAT TOAD'S BIRD: So that Nobody
could imagine from whence this Change could proceed, but from a Design
to preserve an Interest in the Presbyterian Party against the Time He should
have Occasion to use them.</P>
<P>THEN there were Circumstances in this Grace of the King to the Lord
<HI>Lorne,</HI> that exceeded all Mens Comprehension: For his Majesty caused all
the Estate of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> which did not appear in any Degree so
<MILESTONE N="20"/>considerable as it was generally believed to have been, to be seized upon as
forfeited to him; and then would grant it to the Son so absolutely, that
neither the Owners should recover what had been injuriously and violently
taken from them for their Loyalty to the King, nor the Creditors receive
Satisfaction for the just Debts which were due to them, and which must
have been satisfied if the King had retained the Forfeiture. But upon the
Application of the Commissioner and the other Lords, that the King would
hear all Persons concerned, there was some Mitigation in those Particulars,
notwithstanding all the Opposition which <HI>Lautherdale</HI> did barefaced make
on the Behalf of the Lord <HI>Lorne,</HI> and which the other bore with great In∣dignation:
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Which He knew very well, and did believe that the Oath and
Subscription, which He well knew They had contrived for the next Session
of Parliament, was levelled at him; that not taking it, as They did not be∣lieve
He would do, the Secretary of <HI>Scotland's</HI> Place might become void,
which They had much rather should have been in any Man's Hand than
in his. And therefore He took all Occasions to profess and declare, besides
his constant Raillery against the Presbytery, “that if They should require
him to subscribe that He is a <HI>Turk,</HI> He would do it before He would lose
his Office.”</P>
<P>THE Matter of these Offences being most in private, and so not pub∣lickly
<MILESTONE N="40"/>taken Notice of, They made a fair Show and kept good Quarter to∣wards
each other. And the King consenting to all that the Commissioner
proposed with Reference to the Publick, being indeed abundantly satisfied
with his Comportment, and at parting promising to give him the Office of
Treasurer, when by <HI>Crawford's</HI> refusing to subscribe it should become void;
They,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis∣sioner and Bishops return to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> with all their Bishops, returned again for <HI>Scotland</HI> with incurable
Jealousy of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who remained waiting upon the King, and re∣solved
to cross all their Designs He could, and quietly to expect a better
Opportunity to undo what He could not for the present prevent.</P>
<P>IT is Time now to return to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>Parliament meets.</HI></NOTE> which, ac∣cording
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to the Time of the Prorogation, met again in <HI>March</HI> towards
the Entrance into the Year 1664: When at their first Meeting the King
informed them at large of the Insurrection that had been endeavoured in
the Summer before in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> which, how foolishly soever contrived,
<PB N="218" REF="223"/>
was a very great Instance of the Distemper of the Nation; that three
Years after the disbanding of the Army, the Officers thereof should re∣main
still so unquiet, as to hope to give any signal Disturbance to the
Peace of the Kingdom, by such a Commotion as They could upon their
Credit raise.</P>
<P>THE continual Discourse of Plots and Insurrections had so wearied the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Insurrec∣tion intended in</HI> Yorkshire.</NOTE> that He even resolved to give no more Countenance to any such In∣formations,
nor to trouble himself with Inquiry into them; but to leave
the Peace of the Kingdom against any such Attempts to the Vigilance of
the civil Magistrates, and the Care of the Officers of the Militia, which He<MILESTONE N="10"/>
presumed would be sufficient to quell and suppress any ordinary fanatick
Design. And upon this Resolution, and to avoid the Reproach of the late
Times, of contriving Plots only to commit Men to Prison against whom
there was any Prejudice, He totally neglected the first Information He re∣ceived
of this seditious Purpose. But when the Intelligence was continued
from several Parts, and so particular for the Time and Place of the Ren∣dezvous,
and for the seizing upon the City of <HI>York;</HI> and there was Evi∣dence
that some Men of Estate and Fortune, and who were held wary and
discreet Men, were engaged in it; his Majesty thought it Time to provide
against it, and not only commended the Care of it to the Lords Lieute∣nants<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and Deputy Lieutenants of the Counties adjacent, but sent likewise se∣veral
Troops of his own Horse to possess the City of <HI>York</HI> before the Day ap∣pointed,
and to attend some of the Places of the Rendezvous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But prevented.</NOTE> And They
came very seasonably, and surprised many upon the very Place, before their
Company was strong enough to make Resistance. Others did make some
Resistance, but quickly fled and were dispersed. Many were taken, and
upon their Examination behaved themselves as if They were sure to be
quickly rescued; for it appeared that They did believe that the Insurrection
would have been general throughout the Kingdom, and that all the dis∣banded
Army would have been brought together at several Rendezvouses.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>ALL the Prisons in the <HI>North</HI> were so full, that the King thought it
necessary to send down four or five of the Judges of the several Benches
of <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> to <HI>York,</HI> with a Commission of <HI>Oyer and Terminer,</HI>
to examine the whole Matter. There, though the Judges did not be∣lieve
that They had discovered the Bottom of the whole Conspiracy, They
found Cause to condemn very many; whereof seventeen or eighteen were
executed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the Plutters exe∣cuted.</NOTE> some reprieved, and very many left in Prison to be tried at the
next Assizes. Amongst those who were executed, the Man who was most
looked upon was one <HI>Rymer,</HI> of the Quality of the better Sort of Grand∣Jurymen,
and held a wise Man, and was known to be trusted by the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
greatest Men who had been in Rebellion: And He was discovered by a
Person of intimate Trust with him, who had heretofore the same Affections
with him, but would venture no more. He was a sullen Man, and used
few Words to excuse himself, and none to hurt any Body else; though He
was thought to know much, and that having a good Estate He would ne∣ver
have embarked in a Design that had no Probability of Success. Some
of the Prisoners declared, “that They were assured by those who engaged
them, that such and such great Men would appear at the Rendezvous or
soon after.” But that was not thought a sufficient Ground to trouble
any Man, though some of them were very liable to Suspicion; since in<MILESTONE N="50"/>
all Combinations of that Kind, it is a most usual Artifice to work upon
weak Men, by persuading them that other Men, of whom They have great
Esteem, are engaged in it, who in Truth know Nothing of it.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224"/>
THE Judges were returned from <HI>York</HI> little Time before the Parliament
met; and therefore the King thought it fit to awaken them to much Vigi∣lance,
by informing them with what Secrecy that Conspiracy had been car∣ried.
And his Majesty assured them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech at the Meeting of the Parliament.</NOTE> “that He was not yet at the Bottom
of that Business; and that it appeared manifestly, that this Conspiracy
was but a Branch of that which He had discovered as well as He could
to them about two Years since, and had been then executed nearer Hand,
if He had not by God's Goodness come to the Knowledge of some of the
principal Contrivers, and so secured them from doing the Mischief They
<MILESTONE N="10"/>intended.”</P>
<P>HIS Majesty told them, “that They would wonder, (yet He said what
was true) that They were now even in those Parts, when They see their
Friends under Trial and Execution, still pursuing the same Consultations:
And it was evident that They had Correspondence with desperate Persons
in most Counties, and a standing Council in <HI>London</HI> itself, from which
They receive their Directions, and by whom They were advised to defer
their last intended Insurrection. But those Orders served only to distract
them, and came too late to prevent their Destruction.” He said, “He
knew more of their Intrigues, than They thought He did; and hoped
<MILESTONE N="20"/>He should shortly discover the Bottom: In the mean Time He desired
the Parliament, that They might all be as watchful to prevent, as They
were to contrive their Mischief.” He said, “He could not upon this
Occasion omit to tell them, that these desperate Men in their Counsels (as
appeared by several Examinations) had not been all of one Mind in the
Ways of carrying on their wicked Resolutions. Some would still insist
upon the Authority of the Long Parliament, of which They say They
have Members enough willing to meet: Others have fancied to them∣selves,
by some Computation of their own, upon some Clause in the
<HI>Triennial Bill, that this present Parliament was at an End some Months
<MILESTONE N="30"/>since; and that for Want of new Writs They may assemble themselves,
and chuse Members for Parliament;</HI> and that this is the best Expedient
to bring themselves together for their other Purposes. For the Long Parlia∣ment,”
his Majesty said, “that He and They together could do no more
than He had done to inform and compose the Minds of Men; let them
proceed upon that at their Peril. But He thought there had been No∣thing
done to disabuse Men in respect of the <HI>Triennial Bill.</HI> He confessed
that He had often himself read over that Bill; and though there is no Co∣lour
for the Fancy of the Determination of this Parliament; yet He would
not deny to them, that He had always expected that They would, and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>even wondered that They had not considered the wonderful Clauses in
that Bill, which had passed in a Time very uncareful for the Dignity of
the Crown, or the Security of the People.” His Majesty desired the
Speaker and the Gentlemen of the House of Commons, “that They would
once give that <HI>Triennial Bill</HI> a Reading in their House; and then in God's
Name They might do what They thought fit for him, themselves, and
the whole Kingdom.” His Majesty said, “that He needed not tell them
how much He loved Parliaments: Never King was so much beholden to
Parliaments as He had been; nor did He think that the Crown could
ever be happy without frequent Parliaments. But He wished them to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>assure themselves, that if He should think otherwise, He would never
suffer a Parliament to come together, by the Means prescribed by that
Bill.”</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="225"/>
HE renewed his Thanks to them “for the free Supply They gave him
the last Session of four Subsidies; yet He could not but tell them, that
that Supply was fallen much short of what He expected and They in∣tended.
That it would hardly be believed, yet They knew it to be true,
that very many Persons, who have Estates of three or four thousand Pounds
by the Year, do not pay for these four Subsidies sixteen Pounds: So that
whereas They intended and declared, <HI>that they should be collected ac∣cording
to former Precedents,</HI> they do not now arise to Half the Propor∣tion
they did in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and yet sure the Crown
wants more now than it did then, and the Subject is at least as well able<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to give.” His Majesty said, “the Truth is, by the License of the late
ill Time, and ill Humour of this, too many of the People, and even of
those who make fair Professions, believe it to be no Sin to defraud the
Crown of any Thing that is due to it. That They no sooner gave him
<HI>Tonnage</HI> and <HI>Poundage,</HI> than Men were devising all the Means They
could to steal Custom; nor could the Farmers be so vigilant for the Col∣lection,
as others were to steal the Duties. They gave him the <HI>Excise,</HI>
which all People abroad believed to be the most insensible Imposition that
can be laid upon a People: What Conspiracies and Combinations were
entered into against it by the Brewers, who He was sure did not bear the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Burden themselves, even to bring that Revenue to Nothing, They would
hear in <HI>Westminster-Hall.</HI> They had given him the <HI>Chimney-Money,</HI>
which They had Reason to believe was a growing Revenue, for Men
build at least fast enough; and They would therefore wonder, that it was
already declined, and that this Half Year brings in less than the former did.”
He desired them therefore, “that They would review that Bill; and since
He was sure that They would have him receive whatsoever They gave,
that He might have the collecting and husbanding of it by his own Of∣ficers,
and then He doubted not but to improve that Receipt, and He
would be cozened as little as He could.”<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>HIS Majesty concluded with “desiring and conjuring them to keep a
very good Correspondence together, that it might not be in the Power
of any seditious or factious Spirits to make them jealous of each other, or
either of them jealous of him, till They see him pretend one Thing and
do another, which He was sure They had never yet done.” He assured
them, “it should be in Nobody's Power to make him jealous of them.” And
so desired them, “that They would dispatch what They found necessary, that
They might be ready for a Session within two Months or thereabout,
because the Season of the Year would invite them all to take the Coun∣try
Air.”<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IT was very happy for his Majesty, that He did cut out their Work to
their Hand, and asked no Money of them, and limited them a short Time
to continue together. It made their Counsels very unanimous: And though
They raised no new Taxes and Impositions upon the People, They made
what They had before raised much more valuable to the King than it was
before, by passing other Acts and Declarations for the explaining many
Things, and the better collecting the Money They had formerly given;
which much added to his Majesty's Profit without grieving the People, who
were rather gratified in the Remedies which were provided against Frauds
and Cozenage.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Parliament had sate but very little more than ten Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Triennial Bill <HI>repealed.</HI></NOTE> when They
presented a Bill to his Majesty for the Repeal of the <HI>Triennial Bill,</HI> which
He had recommended to them; which was so grateful to him, that He
<PB N="221" REF="226"/>
came in Person to the House to pass it and to thank them: And He told
them, “that every good <HI>Englishman</HI> would thank them for it; for it could
only have served to discredit Parliaments, to make the Crown jealous of
Parliaments and Parliaments of the Crown, and persuaded neighbour Princes
that <HI>England</HI> was not governed under a Monarch.” The Truth is: It had
passed in a very jealous and seditious Time, when the Wickedness was first in
hatching, that ripened afterwards to a dismal Perfection; and when all, who
were sworn never to consent to the Disherison of the Crown, thought only
of preserving their own Inheritance which They had gotten, or improving it
<MILESTONE N="10"/>at the Expense of the Crown; and made it manifest enough, that it should wi∣ther,
at least while it stood upon the Head of that King; for at that Time the
Conspiracy went no farther, that is amongst those who had then Credit to pro∣mote
its Passage, though They were weak Men who thought it could rest there.</P>
<P>AS They made this Entrance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Acts passed:</NOTE> so They were wholly intent upon Matters
of Moment, and dispatched all They intended to do within the two Months,
in which the King desired They would be ready for a Prorogation. And
as there was greater Order and Unanimity in their Debates, so They dis∣patched
more Business of publick Importance and Consequence, than any
other Parliament hath done in twice the Time: For, besides the Repeal of the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>odious Bill before mentioned, They made a very good additional Bill for
the Chimney-Money, which made that Revenue much more considerable;
and They passed likewise another Bill against the frequenting of Conven∣ticles,
which was looked upon as the greatest Discountenance the Parlia∣ment
had yet given to all the Factions in Religion, and if it had been vi∣gorously
executed would no Doubt have produced a thorough Reforma∣tion.
They made likewise a very good Act, and very necessary for a Time
of such Corruption, that had contracted new Ways of Dishonesty and Villany
that former Times had not thought of, when many unworthy and cowardly
Masters of Ships and Seamen had been contented to be robbed, and to suffer
<MILESTONE N="30"/>all their Owners Goods to be taken, upon an Allowance made to them by the
Pirates; for the Discovery and Punishment whereof the Law had not enough
provided. They therefore presented a Bill to the King, “for the Discovery
and Punishment of all such treacherous and infamous Actions; and for
the Reward of such honest and stout Seamen, as should manfully and
courageously defend their Owners Goods, and therein maintain the Ho∣nour
of the Nation.”</P>
<P>ALL this They presented to his Majesty, and it was confirmed by his Royal
Assent on the 17th of <HI>May;</HI> when his Majesty, after giving such Thanks
to them as They deserved, told them, “He did not intend to bring them
<MILESTONE N="40"/>together again till the Month of <HI>November,</HI> that They might enjoy the
Summer in the Transaction of their own Affairs: Yet because there might
some emergent Occasion fall out, that might make him wish to find them
together sooner, He would prorogue them only to <HI>August;</HI> and before
the Day They should have seasonable Notice, by Proclamation, not to
give their Attendance, except such Occasion should fall out.” And
so They were prorogued to a Day in <HI>August,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment pro∣rogued.</NOTE> but met not till <HI>November</HI>
following.</P>
<P>DURING this short Session of Parliament, They, who were very solicitous
to promote a War with <HI>Holland,</HI> forgat not what They had to do; but
<MILESTONE N="50"/>They quickly discerned that it was not a good Season to mention the giving
of Money (which the King himself had forborne to mention, that the Peo∣ple
might see one Session of Parliament pass without granting new Imposi∣tions,
which They had not yet seen), and therefore it would be as unseason∣able
<PB N="222" REF="227"/>
to speak of a War. However They made such an Approach towards
it, as might make a farther Advance much more easy.</P>
<P>THE Merchants in the Committee of Trade much lamented the Obstruc∣tions
and Discouragements,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mer∣chants remon∣strate against the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> which They had long found in their Com∣merce
by Sea with other Nations, and which were not removed even by the
blessed Return of the King; all which They imputed to the Pride and Inso∣lence
of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> “who” They said “observed no Laws of Com∣merce,
or any Conditions which themselves consented to. That by their
Fraud and Practice the <HI>English</HI> were almost driven out of the <HI>East</HI> and
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> and had their Trade in <HI>Turkey</HI> and in <HI>Africa</HI> much dimi∣nished.<MILESTONE N="10"/>
In Sum, that besides many insufferable Indignities offered by
them to his Majesty and to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> his Subjects had in
few Years sustained the Damage of seven or eight hundred thousand
Pounds <HI>Sterling.</HI>”</P>
<P>ALL which with some particular Instances being reported from the Com∣mittee
of Trade to the House, They had desired an Audience from his
Majesty, and then presented this Grievance to him, and desired his Majesty,
that He would give such Order in it, as to his Wisdom should seem fit,
that might produce just and honourable Satisfaction.” The King, who
continued firm to his former Resolution, answered them, “that He would<MILESTONE N="20"/>
transmit the Address They had presented to him to his Resident at the
<HI>Hague,</HI> with Order that He should inform the <HI>States,</HI> of it, and require
Satisfaction, which He hoped the <HI>States General</HI> would yield unto,
rather than compel him to demand Justice in another Way.” The An∣swer
pleased them well, nor could They wish that the Prosecution should be
put into a better Hand than the Resident's, who was a Member of the
House, and a Man who had inflamed them more than the Merchants them∣selves
against the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Resident was Sir <HI>George Downing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of Sir</HI> George Downing <HI>the Resident in</HI> Holland.</NOTE> a Man of an obscure Birth, and
more obscure Education, which He had received in Part in <HI>New England:</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
He had passed through many Offices in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Army, of Chaplain,
Scoutmaster, and other Employments, and at last got a very particular
Credit and Confidence with him, and under that Countenance married a
beautiful Lady of a very noble Extraction, which was the Fate of many
bold Men in that presumptuous Time. And when <HI>Cromwell</HI> had subdued
the <HI>Dutch</HI> to that Temper He wished, and had thereupon made a Peace
with them, He sent this Man to reside as his Agent with them, being a
Man of a proud and insolent Spirit, and who would add to any imperious
Command of his somewhat of the Bitterness of his own Spirit.</P>
<P>AND He did so fully execute his Charge in all Things, especially when<MILESTONE N="40"/>
He might manifest his Animosity against the Royal Party, that when the
King himself had once, during his Residence at <HI>Brussels,</HI> for his Divertise∣ment
made a Journey <HI>incognito,</HI> with not above four Persons, to see <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI>
and from thence the Towns of <HI>North Holland; Downing</HI> coming
to have Notice of it delivered a Memorial to the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> wherein
He enclosed the third Article of their Treaty, by which They were obliged
not to suffer any Traitor, Rebel or any other Person, who was declared
an Enemy to the <HI>Commonwealth</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to reside or stay in their
Dominions;” and told them, “that <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> and the Marquis of
<HI>Ormond</HI> had been lately in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and were still in some Places ad∣jacent;”<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and required “that They might not be permitted to remain in
any Part of their Dominions.” Whereupon the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> sent
presently to the Princess Royal, who was then at her Country House at <HI>Houns∣lerdike,</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="228"/>
“that if her Brother were then with her or should come to her,
He should forthwith depart out of their Province:” And not satis∣fied
herewith, They published an Order in the <HI>Hague</HI> to the same Pur∣pose,
which was sent to <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and other Towns according to their
Custom.</P>
<P>WITH this rude Punctuality He behaved himself during the Life of <HI>Crom∣well,</HI>
and whilst his Son retained the Usurpation; but when He saw him
thrown out with that Contempt, and that the Government was not like to
be settled again till there was a Resort to the old Foundation, He bethought
<MILESTONE N="10"/>himself how He might have a Reserve of the King's Favour. And the
Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> making about that Time a Journey <HI>incognito</HI> to the
<HI>Hague,</HI> to treat of a Marriage for his eldest Son with a noble Lady whose
Friends lived there, <HI>Downing</HI> found Opportunity to have a private Con∣ference
with him, and made Offer of his Service to the King, if his De∣votion
might be concealed, without which it would be useless to his Ma∣jesty.
And for an Earnest of his Fidelity, He informed him of some Parti∣culars
which were of Moment for the King to know: Amongst which one
was, “that a Person, who in Respect of his very honourable Extraction, and
the present Obligations himself had to the Royal Family, was not sus∣pected,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>gave him, as He had long done, constant Intelligence of what the
King did, and of many Particulars which in their Nature deserved to be
more secret, which He had always sent to <HI>Cromwell</HI> whilst He was living;
but since his Death, having a Resolution to serve the King, He had never
disserved him, and would hereafter give him Notice of any Thing that
it would be necessary for him to be informed of with Reference to <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
or to <HI>Holland.</HI>”</P>
<P>THE Marquis thought it very fit to accept of such an Instrument, and
promised him “to acquaint his Majesty with his good Affection, who He
presumed would receive it graciously, and give him as much Encouragement
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to continue it as his present Condition would permit.” To which the other
replied, “that He knew the King's present Condition too well to expect any
Reward from him: But if his Majesty would vouchsafe, when He should
be restored, to confirm to him the Office He then held of a Teller in
the Exchequer, and continue him in this Employment He then had in
<HI>Holland,</HI> where He presumed He should be able to do him more Service
than a Stranger could do, He would think himself abundantly rewarded.”
Of all which when the Marquis advertised the King at his Return to <HI>Brussels,</HI>
He had Authority to assure him “of the King's Acceptation, and that all
that He expected should be made good.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>THIS was the Ground and Reason, that when the King came to the
<HI>Hague</HI> the Year following to embark for <HI>England,</HI> He received <HI>Downing</HI>
so graciously, and knighted him, and left him there as his Resident;
which They who were near the King, and knew Nothing of what had
passed, wondered at as much as Strangers who had observed his former Beha∣viour.
And the <HI>States</HI> themselves, who would not at such a Time of pub∣lick
Joy do any Thing that might be ingrateful to his Majesty, could not
forbear to lament in private, “that his Majesty would depute a Person to
have his Authority, who had never used any other Dialect to persuade
them to do any Thing He proposed, but Threats if They should not do
<MILESTONE N="50"/>it, and who at several Times had disobliged most of their Persons by his
Insolence.” And from the Time of his Majesty's Departure from thence,
He never made those Representations which Men in those Ministeries use to
do, but put the worst Commentaries upon all their Actions. And when He
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
sate afterwards as a Member of the House, returning still in the Interval
of Parliament to his Employment at the <HI>Hague,</HI> He took all Opportunities
to inveigh against their Usurpations in Trade; and either did or pretended
to know many of their Mysteries of Iniquity, in opening of which He ren∣dered
himself acceptable to the House, though He was a voluminous
Speaker, which naturally They do not like.</P>
<P>WHEN this Province was committed to him of Expostulation for the
Injuries sustained in several Places from the <HI>Dutch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He endeavours to bring on a War.</NOTE> He had his Wish, and
used little Modesty in the urging of it. They answered, “that most of the
Particulars of which He complained were put under Oblivion by the late<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Treaty, and that in Consideration thereof They had yielded to many
Particulars for the Benefit of the <HI>English;</HI> and that for the other Parti∣culars,
they were likewise by the same Treaty referred to a Process in
Justice, of which They had yet no Cause to complain: Nor had there
been any Action pretended to be committed since the Treaty was con∣cluded,”
which was not many Months before, “that might occasion a Mis∣understanding.”
And surely at this Time when these Things were urged
all this was true: But He, according to the Method He had been accus∣tomed
to, insisted upon his own Demands; and frequently reproached them
with their former Submissions to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and their present Presumptions<MILESTONE N="20"/>
upon the Goodness and Generosity of the King.</P>
<P>IT is without Question, that the <HI>States General</HI> did, by the Standard of
their own Wariness and Circumspection, not suspect that the King did intend
to make a War upon them. They well knew the Streights and Necessities
in which his Affairs stood, with Reference to Money, and to the several
Distempers of the Nation in Matters of Religion, which might probably
grow more dangerous if there were a foreign War; and concluded, that
<HI>Downing's</HI> Importunities and Menaces were but the Results of his own Im∣petuosity,
and that the King would not be solicitous to interrupt and part
with his own Peace. And therefore their own Ships They sent out as They<MILESTONE N="30"/>
used to do, and those for the Coast of <HI>Guinea</HI> better prepared and stronger
than of Course. Nor was the Royal Company less vigilant to carry on that
Trade, but about the same Time sent a stronger Fleet of Merchants Ships
than They had ever before done; and for their better Encouragement the
King lent them two of his own Ships for a Convoy.</P>
<P>AND at this Time They gave the King an Advantage in Point of Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The insolent Behaviour of the</HI> Dutch <HI>on the Coast of</HI> Guinea.</NOTE>
and which concerned all other Nations in Point of Traffick and Com∣merce.
It had been begun by them in the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> where They had
planted themselves in great and strong Towns, and had many Harbours well
fortified, in which They constantly maintained a great Number of good and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
strong Ships; by which They were absolute Masters of those Seas, and forced
the neighbour Kings and Princes to enter into such Terms of Amity with them
as They thought fit to require. And if They found that any advantageous
Trade was driven in any Port by any other Nation, They presently sent
their Ships to lie before that Port, and denounced War against the Prince
to whom that Port belonged; which being done, They published a Decla∣ration,
“that it should not be lawful for any Nation whatsoever to trade in
the Territories of that Prince with whom They then were in War.” And
upon this Pretence They would not suffer an <HI>English</HI> Ship, belonging to the
<HI>East-India</HI> Company, to enter into a Port to lade and take in a <HI>Cargason</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
of Goods, that had been provided by their Factors there before there was
any Mention or Imagination of such a War, and of which there was no other
Instance of Hostility than the very Declaration. And at this Time They
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
transplanted this new Prerogative to <HI>Guinea:</HI> And having as They said, for
there was no other Evidence of it, a War with one of those Princes,
They would not suffer the <HI>English</HI> Ships to enter into those Harbours
where they had always traded. The King received Animadversion of this
unheard of Insolence and Usurpation, and added this more just Complaint to
the former, and required his Resident “to demand a positive Renunciation of
all Pretence to such an odious Usurpation, and a Revocation of those Or∣ders
which their Officers had published.” To this Complaint and De∣mand
They deferred to make Answer, till their Ambassadour had presented
<MILESTONE N="10"/>a Grievance to the King.</P>
<P>ONE of those Ships of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An</HI> English <HI>Captain seizes a</HI> Dutch <HI>Fort on the Coast of</HI> Africa.</NOTE> which the King had lent to the Royal Com∣pany
for the Convoy of their Fleet to <HI>Guinea,</HI> had in the Voyage thither
assaulted and taken a Fort belonging to the <HI>Dutch</HI> near Cape <HI>Verde;</HI> which
was of more Incommodity to them than of Benefit to the <HI>English.</HI> Of this
Invasion their Ambassadour made a loud Complaint, and demanded “that
the Captain might be punished severely; and in the mean Time that the
King would give a present Order to him, the Ambassadour, for the Re∣delivery
of the Place and all that was in it, and He would send it to his
Masters, who would forthwith send a Ship to demand it.” The King
<MILESTONE N="20"/>had in Truth heard Nothing of it; and assured the Ambassadour, “that
the Captain, if He had done any such Thing, had not the least Commis∣sion
or Authority for the doing it; and that He was sure He was upon
his Way homeward, so that He might be expected speedily; and then
He should be sure to undergo such Punishment as the Nature of his Of∣fence
required, when the Matter should be examined, and They should
then receive full Reparation.” This Answer how reasonable soever satis∣fied
them not: Nothing would serve their Turn but a present Restitution,
before his Majesty could be informed of the Provocation or Ground that had
produced so unwarrantable an Action. They gave present Orders for the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>equipping a very great Fleet, and the raising many Land Soldiers, making
greater Preparations for War than They had made in many Years before.
They likewise prepared a strong Fleet for <HI>Guinea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>prepare a strong Fleet for</HI> Guinea.</NOTE> and granted a Commis∣sion
(which was published in Print) to the Commander in Chief, “to make
War upon the <HI>English</HI> in those Parts, and to do them all the Mischief
He could.”</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had been heretofore with the Fleet then under
his Command, in the Beginning of the King's Reign, upon the Coast of
<HI>Guinea</HI> (and by the Report and Testimony He gave of that Coast the
Royal Company had received greater Encouragement), now upon this insolent
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Demeanour of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and publishing the Commission They had sent
to their Commander in Chief, offered his Service to the King, “to sail
into those Parts with such a Fleet as his Majesty thought fit to send, with
which He made little Doubt to secure Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>prepare one likewise.</HI></NOTE> and abate the Presumption
of the <HI>Dutch.</HI>” And hereupon a Fleet was likewise preparing for that Pur∣pose,
to be commanded by Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>THE Parliament had before declared, when They made their Address to
the King against the <HI>Dutch</HI> for obstructing the Trade, “that They would
with their Lives and Fortunes assist his Majesty against all Oppositions
whatsoever, which He should meet with in the Removal of those Obstruc∣tions;”
<MILESTONE N="50"/>which They believed would terrify, but in Truth made the
<HI>Dutch</HI> merry: And in some of their Declarations or Answers to <HI>Downing's</HI>
Memorials, They mentioned it with too much Pride and Contempt. And
in this Posture the Disputes were when the Parliament met again in <HI>No∣vember,</HI>
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
which came together for the most Part without a Desire either to
give Money or make War.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment meets.</NOTE> And <HI>Downing,</HI> who laboured heartily to in∣cense
us and to provoke them, in all his Dispatches declared, “that all
those Insolencies proceeded only from the Malignity of the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
which could vent itself no farther than in Words; but that the
<HI>States General,</HI> without whose Concurrence no War could be made, ab∣horred
the Thought of it:” And there is no Doubt that was true. And
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour, who remained at <HI>London,</HI> and was a very honest
weak Man, and did all the Offices He could to prevent it, did not think
it possible it could come to pass; “and that there might be some Scuffles<MILESTONE N="10"/>
upon the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> by the Direction of the <HI>West-India</HI> Company,
of whose Actions the <HI>States General</HI> took Notice, but would cause Jus∣tice
to be done upon Complaint, and not suffer the publick Peace to be
disturbed upon their Pretences.” And so the King forbore to demand
any Supply from the Parliament, because an ordinary Supply would rather
discredit his Demands than advance them, and He could not expect an ex∣traordinary
Supply but when the War was unquestionable. And the <HI>States
General</HI> at this Time were made a Property by the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> (who
had given private Orders for their own Concernments), and presented an hum∣ble
Desire to the King by their Ambassadour, “that Prince <HI>Rupert's</HI> Fleet might<MILESTONE N="20"/>
stay in Harbour, as theirs likewise that was prepared for <HI>Guinea</HI> should do,
till some Means might be found for the Accommodation of all Differences.”
Whereas before They pretended, that They would send their <HI>Guinea</HI> Fleet
through the Channel, convoyed by their Admiral with a Fleet of fifty
Sail; which Report had before stopped Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> when He was under
Sail for <HI>Guinea,</HI> to wait and expect that Piece of Bravery. But this Ad∣dress
from the <HI>States General</HI> made all Men believe there would be an Ac∣commodation,
without so much as any Hostility in <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it was quickly discovered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The treacher∣ous Behaviour of the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> that They were the honester Men when
They gave the worst Words. For before the <HI>States General</HI> sent to the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
King to stop Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in Harbour, “and that their Fleet should like∣wise
remain in their Harbours,” the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> or that Committee
that was qualified by them, had with great Privacy sent Orders to <HI>De Ruyter,</HI>
who was in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> “to make all possible Haste with his
Fleet to go to the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and not only to retake the Fort near
Cape <HI>Verde</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> had taken from them, but likewise to take
what Places He could which were in Possession of the <HI>English,</HI> and to do
them what Damage He could in those Parts:” So that They might well
offer that their Fleet should now remain in their Harbours in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>De Ruyter</HI> had been sent into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the Pretence<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was, that it was against the Pirates of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> who had in Truth
preyed very much upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> taken very many of their Ships, and had
Abundance of their Subjects in Chains. And when that Fleet was sent into
the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> their Ambassadour had desired the King, “that his Ma∣jesty's
Fleet that was then in those Parts might upon all Occasions join
with <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> when Opportunity should be offered thereby to infest the
<HI>Turks;</HI>” which the King consented to, and sent Orders accordingly. But
the <HI>Dutch</HI> had no such Purpose: His Business was to ransom their Captives
with Money, and not to exact the Delivery of them by Force; and to
make an Accommodation for the Time to come as well as He could. And<MILESTONE N="50"/>
when the <HI>English</HI> Fleet was at any Time in Pursuit of any of the <HI>Turks</HI> Ves∣sels,
and expected that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by whom they must pass, would have
given a little Stop to their Flight, which They might easily have done;
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
They rather assisted than obstructed their Escape. And having made a very
dishonourable Peace with the Pirates, He made Haste to prosecute his Or∣ders
for the Coast of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>AS soon as the King knew of this impudent Affront,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which their Ships are seized.</NOTE> and that <HI>De Ruyter</HI>
was in Truth gone out of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> He thought He might justly
seize upon any Ships of theirs, to satisfy the Damage that He could not but
sustain by <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in <HI>Guinea:</HI> And so, it being the Season of the Year that
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet returned with their Wines from <HI>Bordeaux, Rochelle,</HI> and
other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> such of them as were forced by the Weather to put
<MILESTONE N="10"/>into the <HI>English</HI> Harbours were seized upon. And the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> having
put himself on Board with a Fleet of about fifty Sail, upon the Report of
the <HI>Dutch</HI> being come out to defend their Ships, took many others, even
upon their own Coasts; which They chose rather to suffer, than to venture
out of their Ports to relieve them. However there was not any one of all those
Ships suffered to be unladen, or any Prejudice done to them; but they
were all preserved unhurt, till Notice might arrive from <HI>Guinea</HI> what <HI>De
Ruyter</HI> had done there.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>commence Hos∣tilities in</HI> Guinea.</NOTE> But undoubted Intelligence arrived in a very short
Time after, that <HI>De Ruyter</HI> had declared and begun the War upon the Coast
of <HI>Africa,</HI> not only by a forceable retaking the Fort which had been taken
<MILESTONE N="20"/>from them, and which his Majesty had offered to deliver, but by seizing
upon several <HI>English</HI> Ships in those Parts, and by assaulting and taking other
his Majesty's Forts and Places, and exercising all the Acts of Hostility which
his Commission authorised him to do.</P>
<P>AND in a very short Time after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They refuse to deliver the Island of</HI> Po∣leroone.</NOTE> the <HI>East-India</HI> Company complained
and informed the King, “that when their Officer had demanded the Re∣delivery
of the Isle of <HI>Poleroone</HI> according to the Article of the late Treaty,
and delivered the Letters and Orders from the <HI>States General</HI> and <HI>States</HI>
of <HI>Holland,</HI> which their Ambassadours had given at <HI>London,</HI> to the Go∣vernour
and Captain of that Island; He, after making him stay two or
<MILESTONE N="30"/>three Days there with his Ship and the Men He had brought with him,
told him, <HI>that upon a better Perusal of the Orders which He had brought,
He found that they were not sufficient; and therefore till He should re∣ceive
fuller Orders, He could not give up the Place.</HI>” And so the Officer
and Ship, which had been sent at a great Charge, were necessitated to re∣turn
without any other Effect than the Affront and Indignity to his Majesty.</P>
<P>WHEN there was now no Remedy, and the War was actually made upon
the King upon what Provocation soever, there was Nothing to be done but to
resort to the Parliament, which had been so earnest to enter into it. A Fleet
must be prepared equal to what the <HI>Dutch</HI> would infallibly make ready
<MILESTONE N="40"/>against the Spring, and worthy of the Presence of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who
was impatient to engage his own Person in the Conduct of it; and the
King had given his Promise to him that He should, when He had, God
knows, no Purpose that there should be a War. It was quickly disco∣vered,
that there was not the same Alacrity towards a War now, after it
was begun, in the Parliament, as there had been when They made their
Vote: And They would have been glad that any Expedient might have been
found for a Reconciliation, and that the Captain might have been called
in Question, who first gave Offence by taking the Fort from the <HI>Dutch</HI> near
Cape <HI>Verde,</HI> which some had pressed for when He came Home, before
<MILESTONE N="50"/>any more Mischief was done; and the not calling him in Question made
many believe, that He had done Nothing without Warrant or Promise of
Protection.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="233"/>
THE <HI>Dutch</HI> still disclaimed all Thought or Purpose of War, and seemed
highly offended with their Governour of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> and protested, “that
the Not-delivery of the Place proceeded only from Want of an Order from
the Governour of <HI>Batavia,</HI> which Order came the next Day after the
<HI>English</HI> Ship was departed: But that They had given Notice of it to the
<HI>English</HI> Factory at <HI>Bantam,</HI> that the same or another <HI>English</HI> Ship might
return and receive it; and They were confident that it was then in the
Hand of the <HI>English.</HI>” But it was now too late to expect any honour∣able
Peace, at least without making very notable Preparations for a War,
which could not be done without ready Money. And whatever Orders<MILESTONE N="10"/>
had been given for the Preservation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, it quickly appeared
that much of them had been embezzled or disposed of, before they were
brought to any Judicatory, or adjudged to be Prize; and there was too
much Cause to fear, that the rest would be disposed of to other Purposes
than the Support of the War; though Nothing was more positively spoken,
than that the War would maintain itself.</P>
<P>THE Parliament still promised fairly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures taken to dis∣pose the Par∣liament to grant Supplies for a War.</NOTE> and entered upon Consultation how
and what Money to raise. And now the King commanded the Chancellor
and the Treasurer to meet with those Members of the House of Commons,
with whom They had used to consult, and to whom the King had joined<MILESTONE N="20"/>
others upon whom He was told He might more depend, and to adjust to∣gether
what Sum should be proposed, and how and in what Manner to
propose and conduct it. It was about the Month of <HI>January.</HI> And
though the Duke took indefatigable Pains, by going himself sometimes to
<HI>Portsmouth</HI> and sometimes to <HI>Chatham,</HI> to cause the Ships and all Provisions
to be ready, that He might be at Sea before the <HI>Dutch;</HI> yet let what Advance
could be made, as indeed there was great, Nothing could be said to be
done, till a great Stock of ready Money could be provided; and it would
be long after the Parliament had done their Part, before ready Money
would be got: And therefore no more Time must be lost, without taking<MILESTONE N="30"/>
a particular Resolution.</P>
<P>THE Meeting of those Persons the King appointed was at <HI>Worcester-House,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Meeting of some Lords and principal Commoners for that Pur∣pose.</NOTE>
where the Chancellor and Treasurer (who were known to be averse
from the War) told the rest, “that there was no more Debate now to be,
War or no War: It was come upon us, and We were now only to con∣trive
the best Way of carrying it on with Success; which could only be
done by raising a great present Sum of Money, that the Enemy might see
that We were prepared to continue it as well as to begin.” They who were
most desirous of the War, as Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> (who were
in Truth the Men who brought it upon the Nation), with their Friends, were<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of the Opinion, “that there should not be a great Sum demanded at present,
but only so much as might carry out the Fleet in the Spring, and that suffi∣cient
Provisions might be made for the Summer Service: And then, when
the War was once thoroughly entered into, another and a better Supply
might be gotten about <HI>Michaelmass,</HI> when there was Reason to hope, that
some good Success would dispose all Men to a frank Prosecution of the
War.” Whereas these Gentlemen had hitherto inflamed the King with
an Assurance, “that He could not ask more Money of the Parliament than
They would readily give him, if He would be engaged in this War which
the whole Kingdom so much desired.”<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Chancellor and the Treasurer were of Opinion, “that the House of
Commons could never be in a better Disposition to give, than They were
at present; that hereafter They might grow weary, and apt to find Fault
<PB N="229" REF="234"/>
with the Conduct, especially when They found the Country not so well
pleased with the War as They were now conceived to be: Whereas, now
the War was begun, and the King engaged in it as much as He could
be after ten Battles, and all upon their Desire and their Promise; They
could not refuse to give any Thing proposed within the Compass of that
Reason, which all understanding Men might examine and judge of. That
it was evident enough, that the true Ground of all the Confidence the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had was from their Opinion of the King's Necessities and Want of
Money, and their Belief that the Parliament would supply him very
<MILESTONE N="10"/>sparingly, and not long to continue such an Expense, as They very well
knew that a War at Sea would require: And They would be much con∣firmed
in this their Imagination, if at the Beginning They should see
the Parliament give him such a Sum of Money, as seemed to be implied
by what had been said. That They therefore thought it absolutely neces∣sary,
that the King should propose as much, that is, that his Friends
should move for such a Sum, as might upon a reasonable Computa∣tion,
which every Man would be ready to make, and of which wise
Men upon Experience would easily make an Estimate, carry on the War
for a full Year; that is, for the setting out the present Fleet and paying
<MILESTONE N="20"/>it off upon its Return, and for the setting out another Fleet the next
Spring. If this were now done, his Majesty would not be involved in
importunate Necessities the next Winter; but He might calmly and deli∣berately
consult upon such farther Supplies, as the Experience of what
would be then past should suggest to be necessary: And that this would
give his Majesty such a Reputation with all his Neighbours, and such
Terrour to his Enemies, that it would probably dispose them to Peace.”</P>
<P>THEY told them, “the best Method to compute what the Expense
might amount to in a Year, would be by reflecting upon the vast Dispro∣portion
of the Charge We were now already engaged in, and what had
<MILESTONE N="30"/>been estimated four Months since, when the War was designed. That it
was well known to Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had been always present at those
Conferences, that it had been said by the most experienced Sea Officers,
and those who had fought all the late Battles against the <HI>Dutch, that a Fleet
of forty or fifty such Ships, as the King's were, would be Strength suffi∣cient
to beat all the Ships the</HI> Dutch <HI>had out of the narrow Seas;</HI> and one
very eminent Man amongst them said, <HI>He would not desire above fifty Ships
to fight with all They had, and that He was confident that a greater Num∣ber
than fifty could never be brought to fight orderly or usefully:</HI> And yet that
there were at present no fewer than fourscore good Ships preparing for the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Duke. And the Charge in many other Particulars appeared already to
amount to double the Sum that was first computed.”</P>
<P>THEY concluded, “that a less Sum than two Millions and a Half” (which
is five and twenty hundred thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI>) “ought not to be
proposed, and being once proposed ought to be insisted on and pursued
without consenting to any Diminution; for Nobody could conceive that
it would do more than maintain the War one Year, which the Parlia∣ment
could not refuse to provide for in the Beginning, as there was so
much in Truth of it already expended in the Preparations and Expedition
the Duke had made in <HI>November,</HI> when He went to Sea upon the Fame
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet's Intention to convoy their <HI>Guinea</HI> Ships through the
Channel.”</P>
<P>THERE was not a Man in the Company, who did not heartily wish that
that Sum or a greater might be proposed and granted: But They all,
<PB N="230" REF="235"/>
though They agreed in few other Things, protested, “that They could not
advise that so prodigious a Sum should be as much as named; and that
They did not know any one Man, since it could not be thought fit that
any Man who had Relation to the King's Service should move it, who had
the Courage to attempt it or would be persuaded to it.”</P>
<P>THE two Lords continued very obstinate, “that a less Sum should not
be named for the Reasons They had given,” which the other confessed to
be just; and They acknowledged too, “that the Proposition ought not to
be made by any Man who was related to the Court, or was thought to be
in any Grace there that might dispose him, nor yet by any Gentleman,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
how well soever thought of, who was of a small Estate, and so to pay little
of so great a Sum He was so liberal to give.” They therefore desired them
to name some of those Members, who were honest worthy Men, and
looked upon as Lovers of their Country, and of great Fortunes, unsus∣pected
to have any Designs at Court; and if They were not enough ac∣quainted
with them, the Lords would find some Way by themselves or
others to move them to it.” Whereupon They named five or six Per∣sons
very well known, of whom the House had a very good Esteem, but
without any Hope that any of them would be prevailed with to under∣take
it. The Lords said, “They would try what might be done, and give<MILESTONE N="20"/>
them Notice the next Day, that if it were possible it might be the Busi∣ness
of the following Day.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor and the Treasurer chose three <HI>Norfolk</HI> Gentlemen of those
who had been named, because They were good Friends and grateful to
each other, and desired them the next Day “that They might confer toge∣ther.”
They told them, “They knew well the State of Affairs; the
Parliament had engaged the King in a War, that could not be carried on
without a vast Expense: And therefore if at the Entrance into it there
should be a small or an ordinary Supply given, it would blast all their
Hopes, and startle all other Princes from joining, with whom the <HI>Dutch</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
were not in Favour, and who would be inclined to the King, if They saw
such a Provision for the War as would be sufficient to continue it for some
Time. And therefore They desired to confer with them, who upon all
Occasions manifested good Affections to the King, and whose Advice had
a great Influence upon the House, upon the whole Matter how it might
be conducted.” They all consented to what had been said, and pro∣mised
their own Concurrence and utmost Endeavours to compass what the
King should desire. The Lords said, “They promised themselves more
from them, and that They would not only concur, but propose what
should be necessary to be granted.” And thereupon They enlarged upon<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the Charge which was already in View, and upon what was to be expected,
and concluded “that two Millions and a Half were necessary to be insisted
on;” and desired, “that when the Debate should be entered upon, which
They hoped might be the next Day, one of them would propose this Sum
and the other would second it.”</P>
<P>THEY looked long one upon another, as if They were surprised with the
Sum. At last one of them said, “that the Reasons were unanswerable for
a liberal Supply; yet He did not expect that so prodigious a Sum, which
He believed had never yet been mentioned in Parliament to be granted at
one Time, would be proposed: However He did not think it too much,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and that He would do the best He could to answer any Objections which
should be made against it, as He doubted many would; but He confessed
He durst not propose it.” Another was of the same Mind, and with
<PB N="231" REF="236"/>
many good Professions desired to be excused as to the first proposing it.
The third, who was Sir <HI>Robert Paston,</HI> a Person of a much greater Estate
than Both the other who had yet very good Fortunes, and a Gentleman
of a very antient Extraction by his Father (and his Mother was Daughter to
the Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI>), declared very frankly, “that He was satisfied in his
Conscience, that it would be very good for the Kingdom as well as for
the King that such a Sum should be granted: And therefore if They
thought him fit to do it, He would propose it the next Morning, let other
Men think what They would of him for it.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THE Lords gave him the Thanks They ought to do, and said what was
necessary to confirm him, and to thank the other Gentlemen for their Pro∣mise
to second him, and gave Notice to the rest of the Resolution, that
They might call for the Debate the next Day; which was entered into with
a general Cheerfulness, every Man acknowledging the Necessity and the
Engagement of the House, but no Man adventuring to name the Propor∣tion
that should be given. When the House was in a deep Silence expect∣ing
that Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Robert Paston <HI>moves for a Supply of 2,500,000 l.</HI></NOTE> Sir <HI>Robert Paston,</HI> who was no frequent Speaker, but de∣livered
what He had a Mind to say very clearly, stood up, mentioned
shortly the Obligation, the Charge of the War, and “that the present Sup∣ply
<MILESTONE N="20"/>ought to be such as might as well as terrify the Enemy as assist the
King; and therefore He proposed that They might give his Majesty two
Millions and a Half, which would amount to five and twenty hundred
thousand Pounds.” The Silence of the House was not broken; They
fate as in Amazement, until a Gentleman, who was believed to wish well
to the King, without taking Notice of what had been proposed, stood up,
and moved that They might give the King a much less Proportion. But
then the two others, who had promised to second, renewed the Motion
one after the other; which seemed to be entertained with a Consent
of many, and was contradicted by none: So that, after a short Pause, no
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Man who had Relation to the Court speaking a Word, the Speaker put it
to the Question, “whether They would give the King five and twenty
hundred thousand Pounds for the carrying on the War against the <HI>Dutch;</HI>”
and the Affirmative made a good Sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is a∣greed to by the House.</NOTE> and very few gave their Negative
aloud, and it was notorious very many fate silent. So the Vote was pre∣sently
drawn up into an Order; and the House resolved the next Day to
be in a Committee, to agree upon the Way that should be taken for the
raising this vast Sum, the Proportion whereof could no more be brought
into Debate.</P>
<P>THIS brave Vote gave the King the first Liking of the War: It was above
<MILESTONE N="40"/>what He had expected or indeed wished to be proposed. And They, who had
been at the first Conference, and delivered the Resolution of the two Lords as
impossible to be compassed, not without Insinuation as if it were affected only
to indispose the House to the War (yet They did not think fit to vary from the
Proportion, till They saw the Success of the Proposition, which the Lords were
engaged to procure a fit Person to make); when They found the Conclu∣sion
to be such as could be wished, They commended the Counsel, and
fell into another Extreme, that in the Thing itself and in the Consequence
did very much Harm; which shall be next mentioned, after I have said
that there appeared great Joy and Exaltation of Spirit upon this Vote, and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>not more in the Court than upon the Exchange, the Merchants generally
being unskilfully inclined to that War, above what their true Interest could
invite them to, as in a short Time afterwards They had Cause to confess.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237"/>
THE King sent to the Lord Mayor to call a Common Council, and
commanded the Chancellor, Treasurer, and other Lords of his Council, to
go thither; who, upon the Credit of this Vote of the House of Commons
for this noble Supply, prevailed with the City presently to furnish the King
with the Loan of two hundred thousand Pounds; which being within few
Days paid into the Hands of the Treasurer of the Navy, all Preparations for
the Fleet, and of whatever else was necessary for the Expedition, were pro∣vided
with marvellous Alacrity: And the Parliament made what Haste was
possible to dispatch the Bill, by which their great Present might be collected
from the People.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>IT hath been said before, that in most vacant Places, upon the Death of
any Members, Ways were found out to procure some of the King's do∣mestick
Servants to be elected in their Places; so that his Majesty had many
Voices there at his Devotion; which did not advance his Service. These
Men confidently ran out of the House still to inform the King of what was
doing, commended this Man, and discommended another who deserved
better; and would many Times, when his Majesty spake well of any Man,
ask his Majesty “if He would give them Leave to let that Person know how
“gracious his Majesty was to him, or to bring him to kiss his Hand.” To
which He commonly consenting, every one of his Servants delivered some<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Message from him to a Parliament-Man, invited him to Court as if the
King would be willing to see him. And by this Means the Rooms at
Court, where the King was, were always full of the Members of the House
of Commons; this Man brought to kiss his Hand, and the King induced to
confer with that Man, and to thank him for his Affection, which never
could conclude without some general Expression of Grace or Promise, which
the poor Gentleman always interpreted to his own Advantage, and expected
some Fruit from it that it could never yield: All which, being contrary to
all former Order, did the King no Good, and rendered those unable to do
him Service who were inclined to it.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE new Secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> H. Ben∣net <HI>and Sir</HI> C. Berkley <HI>caress and amuse Sir</HI> Rob. Paston.</NOTE> and Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who by this Time was en∣tered
very far into the King's Favour and his Confidence, were the chief,
and by their Places had Access to him in all Places and Hours: And They
much disliked the Officiousness of the others, as if They presumed to invade
their Province. They thought it but their Due, that the King should take
his Measures of the House of Commons by no other Report but theirs, nor
dispense his Graces there through any other Conduit. They took this Oc∣casion
to caress Sir <HI>Robert Paston,</HI> who was a Stranger to them, and to
magnify the Service He had done the King, and the great Sense the King had
of it, and that He did long to give him his own Thanks: They invited him<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to come to the Court, and Sir <HI>Charles Berkley</HI> told him as from the King,
“that his Majesty resolved to make him a Baron.” And by these daily
Courtships and Importunities the Gentleman, who was well satisfied with
what He had done, and never proposed any Advantage to himself from it,
was amused, and thought He was not to refuse any Honour the King thought
him worthy of, nor to neglect those Graces which were offered to him by
Persons of their Interest. Yet He made not Haste to go to the Court, be∣lieving
that it might make him less capable of serving the King, and that
any Favour his Majesty should do him would be more seasonable here∣after
than at present, left He might be thought to have made that Mo∣tion<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in the House upon Promise of the other Reward. Yet after continued
Invitations He went thither, and those Gentlemen presented him to the
King, who spake very graciously to him, told him, “He had done him
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
great Service, which He would never forget,” and many other princely
Expressions, and “that He should be glad to see him often,” but no Par∣ticular
to that Purpose which had been mentioned to him.</P>
<P>WHEN He went next, He found his Majesty's Countenance the same:
But They, who had courted and amused him so much, grew every Day more
dry and reserved towards him; of which He complained to a Friend of his
who He knew had Interest in the Chancellor, and desired him to acquaint
him with all that had passed, who had not till then heard that He had been
at Court, and when He was informed of the whole Relation was very much
<MILESTONE N="10"/>troubled, well knowing, that how acceptable soever those Kinds of Court∣ships
were for few Days, they were attended with many Inconveniences
when the End was not correspondent with the Beginning. He knew well
the Resolution the King had taken to create no more Noblemen, the Num∣ber
whereof already too much exceeded: However He was very sorry, that
a Person of that Quality and Merit should be exposed to any Indignity,
for having endeavoured in such a Conjuncture to do his Majesty a signal
Service, and succeeded so well; and spake with the King at large of it, and
gave his Majesty a full Account of the Modesty and Temper of the Gentle∣man,
of his Quality and Interest, and what had been said and promised to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>him. The King was troubled, owned all that He had said himself to him,
as being very hearty, and “that He would never forget the Service He
had done, but requite it upon any Opportunity;” but protested, “that
He had never made any such Promise, nor given Sir <HI>Charles Berkley</HI>
any Authority to mention any such Thing to him, which would prove
very inconvenient;” and therefore wished, “that his Friend would divert
him from prosecuting such a Pretence, which He knew to be contrary to
his Resolution.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew not what to say, but truly advertised his Friend
of all the King had said, who again informed Sir <HI>Robert Paston,</HI> who
<MILESTONE N="30"/>thought himself very hardly treated, and went to Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who
had not the same open Arms, yet assured him “that He had said Nothing
to him but by the King's Direction, which He must aver. That He did
not use to interpose or move the King in any of his Affairs: But if He
would desire the Chancellor to take Notice of it, who He knew had a
great Affection for him, and upon whose Desire He had performed that
great Service, He was confident it would be attended with the Success
He wished, to which He would contribute all his Endeavours;” intimating,
that if He had not what He desired, He might impute it to the Chancellor.”
Upon which Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> who was well assured of the Chancellor's Kindness,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>concluded that his Court-Friends had deluded him, or expected Money,
which He would not give: And so the Matter ended with Prejudice to
the King.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these and the like very inconvenient Activities, which
lost more Friends than were gotten by them, the Noise of this stupendous
Supply, given to the King at one Time, made good Impressions upon all
who had any Affections for the King, and was wondered at in those Places
where Money was most Plenty. In <HI>Holland</HI> it wrought even to Consternation,
and the common People cried aloud for Peace, and the <HI>States</HI> pretended to
have great Hope as well as Desire of it, and sent their Ambassadour, who
<MILESTONE N="50"/>remained still in <HI>England,</HI> new Orders to solicit it.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the King neglected not to apply what Endeavours He
could use,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condition of</HI> England <HI>in Respect to it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Neighbours.</HI></NOTE> to dispose his Allies to act such Parts as their own Interest might
reasonably invite them to. From <HI>France</HI> He expected only Neutrality, by
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
Reason He knew He had renewed the Alliance with the <HI>States;</HI> but never
suspected, that it was in such a Manner as would hinder the Neutrality.
<HI>Spain</HI> could do little Good or Harm, nor durst it to engage against <HI>Hol∣land:</HI>
Yet all was done that was necessary towards a good Correspondence
with it. The two Northern Kings would find themselves concerned, at least
to wish better to one Side than to the other; and had been Both so dis∣obliged
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that had it not been for the irreconcilable Jealousy
They had of each other, They might have been united to the Interest of
<HI>England.</HI> But <HI>Denmark</HI> had in the late War given what They could not
keep nor recover, and yet could hardly be without; and <HI>Sweden</HI> looked with<MILESTONE N="10"/>
too much Contempt upon the Weakness and Unactivity of their Neighbour,
to give back any Thing They had got: And this restrained them Both from
provoking an Enemy that might give Strength to the other.</P>
<P>YET <HI>Denmark</HI> had the Year before by <HI>Hannibal Zested,</HI> who went Am∣bassadour
into <HI>France</HI> and made <HI>England</HI> his Way, made many Com∣plaints
to the King “of the Oppression the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> underwent
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the Resolution it had to shake off that Yoke as soon
as an Opportunity should be offered;” and made a Request to the King,
that He would endeavour to make the Alliance so fast between <HI>Denmark</HI>
and <HI>Sweden,</HI> that the Jealousy of each other might hinder neither of them<MILESTONE N="20"/>
from doing any Thing that was for their own Interest, without Prejudice
to the other.” And when the Difficulty was alleged, in Regard that
<HI>Sweden</HI> would never be persuaded to part with <HI>Elsenore,</HI> and those other
Places which had been given up in the late Treaty; <HI>Hannibal Zested</HI> con∣sented
that what was done in that Treaty should be again confirmed, and
said “his Master was willing and desirous that the King of <HI>England</HI> should
undertake and be Caution for the Observation of this Treaty;” implying,
that if this were done, and thereby the Fear of any further Attempt from
<HI>Sweden</HI> were extinguished, <HI>Denmark</HI> would not be long without redeem∣ing
itself from the Vexation which it endured from <HI>Holland,</HI> which,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
upon former Necessities and ill Bargains, upon the Matter had an Exemp∣tion
from paying all Duties upon their own great Trade through the
<HI>Sound,</HI> as much to the Prejudice of all other Princes as of the poor Crown
of <HI>Denmark.</HI>” This having so lately passed from a Minister of that Crown,
the King thought it a good Time to endeavour to do that Office between
the two Crowns, and thereby to unite them Both to the King in this Con∣junction
against the <HI>Dutch;</HI> at least that They might Both remain good
Friends to his Majesty, and supply him with all those Provisions without
which his Navy could not be supported, and as far as was possible restrain
the <HI>Dutch</HI> from those Supplies, by making such large Contracts with the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>English,</HI> that there would not be enough left for the other.</P>
<P>UPON this Ground He sent Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI> of his Bedchamber to the
<HI>Swede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbassa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut to</HI> Den∣mark <HI>and</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weden.</NOTE> whose Friendship He much more valued as more able to assist him,
and upon whose Word He could more firmly depend. And to <HI>Denmark</HI>
He sent Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> who was acceptable to that Crown by his having
performed many Offices of Respect to the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> when He had
been <HI>incognito</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and waited upon him to several Parts of the King∣dom
which He had a Mind to see, and so caused him to be entertained in se∣veral
Gentlemens Houses in his Journey, of which the Prince seemed very
sensible when He departed. That which was expected from that Negotia∣tion,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
except the Confidence could be created between the two Crowns,
was only to preserve <HI>Denmark</HI> a Friend, that He might not favour the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and might recall all his Subjects out of their Service; and that We
<PB N="235" REF="240"/>
might have the same Freedom of Trade, and the Security of his Ports for our
Men of War.</P>
<P>WHILST the King took this Care for the Advancement of his Affairs
abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proposals made by the Bishop of</HI> Munster <HI>for an Alliance against the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> there was an Advantage offered him that looked as if it came from
Heaven. There came one Day a Gentleman, who looked rather like a
Carter, who spoke ill <HI>English,</HI> and desired that He might have a private
Audience with the Chancellor; who presently sent for him, and in a short
Time knew him to be a <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monk, who had been sometimes with
him at <HI>Cologne,</HI> and belonged to the <HI>English</HI> Abbey at <HI>Lamspring</HI> in <HI>West∣phalia,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/>where a very reverend Person of the Family of <HI>Gascoigne</HI> in <HI>York∣shire</HI>
was Abbot, with whom the Chancellor had much Acquaintance, and
esteemed him very much; and He had, during the Time the King stayed in
<HI>Cologne,</HI> sent this Monk several Times thither, who was likewise a Gentleman,
but by living long in <HI>Germany</HI> had almost forgot the Language as well as the
Manners of his own Country. His Business now was to deliver him a Let∣ter
(whereof He knew little of the Contents) from the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI>
upon the Edge of whose Dominions that <HI>English</HI> Abbey was seated, which
had likewise a Territory that extended to the Principality of the other, and
received much Favour and Protection from the other; who desired the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Abbot to give him an honest Man, that would carry a Letter from him to
the Court of <HI>England:</HI> Upon which this Monk was deputed, the rather be∣cause
He was known to the Chancellor. The Matter of the Letter was no more,
than “that if the War against <HI>Holland</HI> was to be resolutely prosecuted by the
King of <HI>England,</HI> He (the Bishop) conceived that a Conjunction with
those Allies, who could infest the <HI>Dutch</HI> by Land as his Majesty would
do by Sea, might not be unacceptable to his Majesty; and in that Cafe,
upon the Answer to this Letter, He would send a fit Person to make
some Propositions to the King and to treat with him.” The Instructions
the Monk had, were “to make all possible Haste back, and that as soon as
<MILESTONE N="30"/>He returned on that Side the Sea, He should send the Answer He had
received, by the Post, so directed as was appointed; and then that himself
should stay at <HI>Brussels</HI> till He received farther Orders.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor quickly informed the King of this Dispatch, to whom
the Monk was likewise known; and his Majesty immediately assembled those
Lords with whom He consulted in the most secret Cases. Every Body knew
so much of the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> that He was a warlike Prince, having
had Command in Armies before He dedicated himself to the Church, and
that He had a great Animosity against <HI>Holland,</HI> which had disobliged
him in the highest Point, by encouraging his Subjects to rebel against him,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and those of his City of <HI>Munster</HI> to shut their Gates against him: And
when He endeavoured to reduce them by Force, and to that Purpose had
besieged them with his Army, the <HI>Dutch</HI> sent an Army to relieve it, and
declared that They would protect that City. And by this Means, and
by the Mediation of the neighbour Princes, who had no Mind that the
Peace of their Country should be disturbed by such an Incursion, the
Bishop was hindered from taking that Vengeance upon his rebel Subjects
which He intended, and compelled to accept of such Conditions as did
not please him. And all this was but two Years before, and boiled still
in his Breast, that was naturally very hot. But He was a poor Prince, unable
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to give any Disturbance to the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> whose Dominions ex∣tended
within a Day's March of his. However every Man was of Opi∣nion,
that the Proposition ought to be very kindly received, and the Bishop
invited to send his Agent. And to that Purpose the Chancellor wrote to
<PB N="236" REF="241"/>
him, and the Monk was dispatched the next Day. And having observed
his Orders in sending away the Answer, He was very few Days at <HI>Brussels,</HI>
when a Servant of the Bishop arrived with Orders that the Monk should ac∣company
him back into <HI>England:</HI> And so They Both arrived in <HI>London</HI> in
less Time than could be expected.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman who came from the Bishop was a very proper Man,
well-bred, a Baron of that Country, but a Subject to the Bishop: He
brought with him a Letter of Credit from the Bishop to the King, and full
Authority to treat and conclude according to his Instructions, which He
likewise presented to his Majesty. He brought likewise a Letter to the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Chancellor from the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in which He recommended to
him the Person whom the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> should send, and declared
“that He believed the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> would be able to perform what∣soever
He should undertake:” Which Letter was a very great Encou∣ragement
to the King; for his Majesty knew the Elector of <HI>Mentz</HI> very well
to be a very wise Prince and notoriously his Friend, and that He would
not say so much of the Ability of the Bishop to perform, except He knew
particularly his Design, and what He would undertake to do.</P>
<P>THE Baron's Instructions were to propose, “that his Majesty would
cause one hundred thousand Pounds to be immediately paid, by Bills of<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Exchange at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> or <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Francfort,</HI> to such Persons as the
Bishop should appoint to receive it; and should promise to pay fifty thou∣sand
Pounds by the Month in the same Places for three Months to come:
Afterwards He hoped the Army would provide for its own Support. This
being undertaken on his Majesty's Part, the Bishop would be engaged,
within one Month after the first Bills of Exchange for the one hundred
thousand Pounds should be delivered into the Hands of his Agent the
Baron, that He would be in the Dominions of the <HI>States General</HI> with an
Army of sixteen thousand Foot and four thousand Horse; with which
He was very confident He should within few Days be possessed of <HI>Arn∣heim,</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
and shortly after of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> And if the King's Fleet came before
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> that Army of the Bishop should march to what Place or
Quarter his Majesty should direct.”</P>
<P>THE Baron was asked, “how it could be possible for the Bishop, though
a gallant Prince and very active, to draw together such an Army in so
short a Time out of his small Province; and how He was sure that his
Neighbours, who two Years before had compelled him to make so disad∣vantageous
a Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> would not again use the same violent
Importunity to obstruct his Proceedings.” To which He answered, “that
the Bishop would never undertake to bring such an Army together in so<MILESTONE N="40"/>
short a Time, in which They could not be levied, but that He knows
They are already levied, and upon an Assurance of Money can be brought
together in the short Time proposed: For the other, the Interposition of his
Neighbours, He had not then, when They prevailed, Half that Army
which He was sure He should now have; besides those Neighbours were
now as much incensed against the <HI>Dutch</HI> as his Master was, and would
all engage with him against them; and that many of the Army that is de∣signed
were at present quartered in their Dominions; and that the Bishop
intended not to march in his own private Capacity, but as General of the
Empire, for which the Elector of <HI>Mentz</HI> had undertaken to procure him<MILESTONE N="50"/>
a Commission.” He was demanded “how his Master stood with <HI>France,</HI>
and whether He did not fear that it would either prevent the Enterprise
by Mediation, or disappoint it by sending Aid to <HI>Holland.</HI>” He an∣swered,
<PB N="237" REF="242"/>
“his Master was confident <HI>France</HI> would not do him any Harm:
That He had sent an Agent, from whom He should be sure to receive
Letters by every Post.” And within few Days after, He shewed a Letter
that He had received from that Agent, in which He said, “that <HI>Monsieur
de Lionne</HI> bade him assure the Bishop, that his <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty would
do Nothing to his Prejudice.”</P>
<P>THIS being the State of that Affair, the King considered what He was
to do. The Propositions made by the Bishop were such, as it was not pos∣sible
for him to comply with. But then it was presumed by every Body,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that very much would be abated of the Money that was demanded: For it
was not an auxiliary Army that was to be raised for the King's Service,
whose Conquests were to be applied to his Benefit, but an Army raised to
revenge the Injuries which himself had received, and what He should get
must be to his own Account; and his Majesty's Hostility at Sea would as
much facilitate his Enterprise at Land, as the marching of his Army might
probably disturb and distract their Preparations for the Sea. Yet it could
not be expected, that the Bishop could draw this Army together (and the
Attempt was not to be made with less Force) without a good Supply of
Money, nor keep it together without Pay.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE Advantage, that would with God's Blessing attend this Conjunc∣tion,
spread itself to a very large Prospect. That the People generally in
the <HI>Provinces</HI> were very unsatisfied with this War, was a Thing notorious; and
that the Province of <HI>Holland</HI> which began it, and was entirely governed by
<HI>De Wit,</HI> did even compel the other Provinces to concur with them, partly
upon Hope that a farther Progress would be prevented by Treaty, or that a
Peace would follow upon the first Engagement. But when They should
see an Army of twenty thousand Men, which They suspected not, to in∣vade
their Country at Land, and in that Part where They were most se∣cure,
and from whence so much of their necessary Provisions were daily
<MILESTONE N="30"/>brought; They must be in great Consternation, and draw all their Land
Army together, which They had not done in near twenty Years, and
could not be done to any Effect without vast Charge, which would put
the People into a loud Distraction. Finally, there was great Reason to cherish
the Design: And therefore the King resolved by an unanimous Advice to
undertake any Thing towards it, that could be in his Power to perform.</P>
<P>THERE was one Difficulty occurred, that had not been thought of nor so
much as apprehended by the Baron, which was the Return of the Money,
whatsoever should be assigned to that Service; for of the three Places proposed
by him, besides the Secrecy that was requisite, all the Trade of <HI>London</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>could not assign one thousand Pounds in the Month to be paid upon <HI>Cologne</HI>
and <HI>Francfort;</HI> nor could <HI>Hamburgh</HI> itself be charged with twenty thou∣sand
Pounds in three Months Time: Which when the Agent knew, He
seemed amazed, and said “They had believed that it had been as easy to
have transmitted Money to those three Towns, as it was for them to re∣ceive
it from thence.”</P>
<P>IN Conclusion, the King gave his Answer in Writing, what Sum of
Money He would cause to be paid at once for the first Advance, that the
Bishop might begin his March, and what He would afterwards cause to be
paid by the Month; which being less than the Baron's Instructions would
<MILESTONE N="50"/>admit him to accept, He sent an Express with it to the Bishop: And “till
his Return,” He desired, “that the King would appoint some Person of
Experience to confer with him; and They might together inform them∣selves
of the best Expedients to return Money into <HI>Germany,</HI> since his Ma∣jesty
<PB N="238" REF="243"/>
had hitherto only undertaken to pay his Assignations in <HI>London.</HI>”
What Success this Treaty afterwards had will be related in its Place.</P>
<P>THESE Advantages from abroad being in this Manner deliberated and
designed, it may be very seasonable to look back, and consider what Pre∣parations
were made at Home towards the carrying on this War, for which
the Parliament had provided so bountifully: And if ordinary Prudence had
been applied to the Managery, if any Order and Method had been con∣sulted
and steadily pursued for the conducting the Whole, the Success would
have been answerable, and at least any Inconvenience from the sudden
Want of Money would have been prevented. But whoever was at any<MILESTONE N="10"/>
near Distance in that Time when those Transactions were in Agitation, as
there are yet many worthy Men who were, or shall be able to procure a
sincere Information of the Occurrences of that Time, will be obliged to
confess, that They who contrived the War had the entire conducting it,
and were the sole Causes of all the ill Effects of it; which cannot be set
down particularly without wounding those, who were by their Confidence
in ill Instruments made accessary to those Mischiefs, in which themselves
suffered most. Nor is it the End of this true Relation to fix a Brand
upon the Memory of those, who deserve it from the Publick and from very
many worthy Men, but is to serve only for a Memorial to cast my own<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Eyes upon, when I cannot but reflect upon those Proceedings; and by my
Consent shall never come into any Hands but theirs, who for their own
Sakes will take Care to preserve it from any publick View or Perusal.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied and may very truly be averred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Navy from the King's Re∣storation.</NOTE> that from the Hour
of the King's Return and being possessed of the entire Government, the
Naval Affairs were never put into any Order. That Province, being com∣mitted
to the Duke as Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> was entirely en∣grossed
by his Servants, in Truth by Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who was newly made
his Secretary, and who made Use of his other Servants, who were better
known to him, to infuse into his Highness the Opinion, “that whoever<MILESTONE N="30"/>
presumed to meddle in any Thing that related to the Navy or the Ad∣miralty,
invaded his Jurisdiction, and would lessen him in the Eyes of the
People; and that He ought to be jealous of such Men, as of those who
would undermine his Greatness; and that as He was superiour to all Men
by being the King's Brother, so being High Admiral He was to render
Account to none but to the King, nor suffer any Body else to interpose
in any Thing relating to it.” Whereas in Truth there is no Officer of
the Crown more subject to the Council-Board than the Admiral of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
who is to give an Account of all his Actions and of every Branch
of his Office constantly to the Board, and to receive their Orders: Nor<MILESTONE N="40"/>
hath He the Nomination of the Captains of the Ships, till upon the Pre∣sentation
of their Names He receives their Approbation, which is never
denied. Nor was there any Counsellor who had ever fate at the Board in
the last King's Time, to whom this was not as much known as any Order
of the Table.</P>
<P>BUT there was no retrieving this Authority, not only from the Influence
Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> and They of the Family who adhered to him, had upon the
Duke, but from the King's own Inclination, who thought that those Offi∣cers,
who immediately depended upon himself and only upon himself, were
more at his Devotion than They who were obliged to give an Account to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
any other Superiour. And from the Time that He came first into <HI>France,</HI>
He had not been accustomed to any Discourse more than to the under∣valuing
the Privy Council, as if it shadowed the King too much, and
<PB N="239" REF="244"/>
usurped too much of his Authority, and too often superseded his own Com∣mands.
And the Queen his Mother had, upon these Discourses, always
some Instances of the Authority which in such a Case the Council had as∣sumed
against the King's Judgment; the Exception to which, according to
the Relation which Nobody could question, seemed to be very reasonable.
This Kind of Discourse, being the Subject of every Day, made so great
Impression that it could never be defaced, and made the Election and No∣mination
of Counsellors less considered, since They were to be no more ad∣vised
with afterwards than before.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>ANOTHER Argument, that used to be as frequently infisted upon by the
Queen, and with more Passion and Indignation, was of the little Respect
and Reverence, that by the Law or Custom of <HI>England</HI> was paid to the
younger Sons of the Crown; and though there was Nobody present in
those Conversations who knew any Thing of the Law or Custom in those
Cases, yet all that was said was taken as granted. And not only the
Duke but the King himself had a marvellous Prejudice to the Nation in
that Part of good Manners: And it was easily agreed, that the Model of
<HI>France</HI> was in those and other Cases much more preferable, and which was
afterwards observed in too many.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THIS being then the State and Temper of the Royal Family when the
King returned, which then consisted of the Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and two
Princesses more than it now hath; the very next Morning after the Fleet
came to <HI>Scheveling,</HI> the Duke went on Board and took Possession of it as
Lord High Admiral: And so his Secretary provided new Commissions for
all the Officers who were in present Command, for which it is probable
They all paid very liberally; for with him the Custom began to receive
five Pounds for every Warrant signed by the Duke, and for which no Se∣cretary
to any Lord Admiral formerly had ever received above twenty Shil∣lings.
Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who was utterly unacquainted with all the Rules and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Customs of the Sea, and knew none of the Officers, but was much courted
by all, as the Secretary to the Admiral always is, made Choice of Captain
<HI>Pen,</HI> whom the King knighted as soon as He came on Board; who from
a common Man had grown up under <HI>Cromwell</HI> to the highest Command,
and was in great Favour with him till He failed in the Action of <HI>St. Do∣mingo,</HI>
when He went Admiral at Sea, as <HI>Venables</HI> was General at Land,
for which They were Both imprisoned in the <HI>Tower</HI> by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> nor ever
employed by him afterwards: But upon his Death He had Command again
at Sea, as He had at this Time under <HI>Mountague</HI> when He came to attend
the King. With this Man Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> made a fast Friendship, and was
<MILESTONE N="40"/>guided by him in all Things.</P>
<P>ALL the Offices which belonged to the Ships, to the Navy, to the Yards,
to the whole Admiralty (except the three superiour Officers, which are not
in the Disposal of the Admiral), were now void, and to be supplied by the
Duke, that is, by Mr. <HI>Coventry;</HI> who by the Advice of Sir <HI>William Pen,</HI>
who was solely trusted by him in the Brocage, conferred them upon those
(without observing any other Rule) who would give most Money, not con∣sidering
any honest Seaman who had continued in the King's Service, or
suffered long Imprisonment for him. And because an incredible Sum of
Money did and would rise this Way, some principal Officers in the Yards,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>as the Master Smith and others, and the Keepers of the Stores, yielding se∣ven,
eight hundred or a thousand Pounds; He had the Skill to move the
Duke to bestow such Money as would arise upon such Place upon Sir
<HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> for another to another, and for some to be divided be∣tween
<PB N="240" REF="245"/>
two or three: By which Means the whole Family was obliged, and
retained to justify him; and the Duke himself looked upon it as a Gene∣rosity
in Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> to accommodate his Fellow Servants with what He
might have asked or kept for himself. But it was the best Husbandry He
could have used: For by this Means all Mens Mouths were stopped, and
all Clamour secured; whilst the lesser Sums for a Multitude of Offices of
all Kinds were reserved to himself, and which, in the Estimation of those
who were at no great Distance, amounted to a very great Sum, and more
than any Officer under the King could possibly get by all the Perquisites
of his Place in many Years. By this Means, the whole Navy and Ships<MILESTONE N="10"/>
were filled with the same Men who had enjoyed the same Places and Offices
under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and thereby were the better able to pay well for them;
whereof many of the most infamous Persons which that Time took Notice
of were now become the King's Officers, to the great Scandal of their ho∣nest
Neighbours, who observed that They retained the same Manners and
Affections, and used the same Discourses They had formerly done.</P>
<P>BESIDES many other irreparable Inconveniences and Mischiefs which re∣sulted
from this Corruption and Choice, one grew quickly visible and noto∣rious,
in the stealing and embezzling all Manner of Things out of the Ships,
even when they were in Service: But when they returned from any Voyages,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
incredible Proportions of Powder, Match, Cordage, Sails, Anchors, and all
other Things, instead of being restored to the several proper Offices which were
to receive them, were embezzled and sold, and very often sold to the King
himself for the setting out other Ships and for replenishing his Stores. And
when this was discovered (as many Times it was) and the criminal Person ap∣prehended,
it was alleged by him as a Defence or Excuse, “that He had paid
so dear for his Place, that He could not maintain himself and Family without
practising such Shifts:” And none of those Fellows were ever brought to ex∣emplary
Justice, and most of them were restored to their Employments.</P>
<P>THE three superiour Officers of the Navy were possessed of their Of∣fices<MILESTONE N="30"/>
by Patents under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> before the King's Re∣turn;
and They are the natural established Council of the Lord High Ad∣miral,
and are to attend him when He requires it, and always used of
Course to be with him one certain Day in a Week, to render him an Ac∣count
of all the State of the Office, and to receive his Orders and to give
their Advice. And now because these three depended not enough upon him,
but especially out of Animosity against Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> who besides
being Treasurer of the Navy was Vice-Chamberlain of the King's Hous∣hold,
and so a Privy Counsellor; Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> proposed to the Duke, “that
in Regard of the Multiplicity of Business in the Navy, much more than in<MILESTONE N="40"/>
former Times, and the setting out greater Fleets than had been accustomed
in that Age when those Officers and that Model for the Government of the
Navy had been established, his Royal Highness would propose to the King
to make an Addition, by Commissioners, of some other Persons always
to sit with the other Officers with equal Authority, and to sign all Bills
with them;” which was a Thing never heard of before, and is in Truth
a lessening of the Power of the Admiral. It is very true, there have fre∣quently
been Commissioners for the Navy; but it hath been in the same
Place of the Admiral and to perform his Office: But in the Time of an
Admiral Commissioners have not been heard of. One principal End in<MILESTONE N="50"/>
this was, to draw from the Treasurer of the Navy (whose Office Mr. <HI>Co∣ventry</HI>
thought too great, and had implacable Animosity against him from
the first Hour after He had made hit Friendship with <HI>Pen</HI>) out of his
<PB N="241" REF="246"/>
Fees (which, though no greater than were granted by his Patent and had
been always enjoyed by his Predecessors, were indeed greater than had used
to be in Times of Peace, when much less Money passed through his Hands)
what should be enough to pay those Commissioners; for it was not rea∣sonable
They should serve for Nothing, nor that They should be upon
the King's Charge, since the Treasurer's Perquisites might be enough
for all.</P>
<P>THE Duke liked the Proposition well, and without conferring with any
Body else upon it proposed it to the King at the Council-Board, where
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Nobody thought fit to examine or debate what the Duke proposed; and the
King approved it, and ordered “that the Commissioners should receive each
five hundred Pounds by the Year:” But finding afterwards that the Trea∣surer
of the Navy's Fees were granted to him under the Great Seal, his Ma∣jesty
did not think it just to take it from him, but would bear it himself,
and appointed the Treasurer to pay and pass those Pensions in his Account.
The Commissioners named and commended by the Duke to the King were
the Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> Sir <HI>John Lawson,</HI> Sir <HI>William Pen,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Ayscue,</HI>
the three last the most eminent Sea-Officers under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> but it must
not be denied but that They served the King afterwards very faithfully.
<MILESTONE N="20"/>These the King made his Commissioners, with a Pension to each of five
hundred Pounds the Year, and in some Time after added Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> to
the Number with the same Pension: So that this first Reformation in the
Time of Peace cost the King one Way or other no less than three thousand
Pounds yearly, without the least visible Benefit or Advantage. The Lord
<HI>Berkley</HI> understood Nothing that related either to the Office or Employ∣ment,
and therefore very seldom was present in the Execution. But after
He had enjoyed the Pension a Year or thereabout, He procured Leave to
sell his Place, and procured a Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Thomas Harvey,</HI> to give him
three thousand Pounds for it: So soon this temporary Commission, which
<MILESTONE N="30"/>might have expired within a Month, got the Reputation of an Office for
Life by the good Managery of an Officer.</P>
<P>THIS was the State of the Navy before the War with <HI>Holland</HI> was re∣solved
upon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Navy at the Commence∣ment of the War.</NOTE> Let us in the next Place see what Alterations were made in
it, or what other Preparations were made, or Counsels entered upon, for the
better Conduct of this War: And a clear and impartial View or Reflection
upon what was then said and done, gave discerning Men an unhappy Pre∣sage
of what would follow. There was no Discourse now in the Court,
after this Royal Subsidy of five and twenty hundred thousand Pounds was
granted, but “of giving the Law to the whole Trade of <HI>Christendom;</HI> of
<MILESTONE N="40"/>making all Ships which passed by or through the narrow Seas to pay an
Imposition to the King, as all do to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> who pass by
the <HI>Sound;</HI> and making all who pass near to pay Contribution to his
Majesty;” which must concern all the Princes of <HI>Christendom:</HI> And
the King and Duke were often desired to discountenance and suppress
this impertinent Talk, which must increase the Number of the Enemies.
Commissioners were appointed to reside in all or the most eminent Port-Towns,
for the Sale of all Prize-Goods; and these were chosen for the most
Part out of those Members of the House of Commons, who were active to
advance the King's Service or who promised to be so, to whom liberal Sa∣laries
<MILESTONE N="50"/>were assigned.</P>
<P>THERE were then Commissioners appointed to judge all Appeals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissioners of Appeals ap∣pointed.</NOTE> which
should be made upon and against all Sentences given by the Judge of the
Admiralty and his Deputies; and these were all Privy Counsellors, the
<PB N="242" REF="247"/>
Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> and the Secretaries of State, who were
like to be most careful of the King's Profit. But then the Rules which were
prescribed to judge by were such as were warranted by no former Precedents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Injustice of their Sen∣tences.</NOTE>
nor acknowledged to be just by the Practice of any neighbour Nation, and
such as would make all Ships which traded for <HI>Holland,</HI> from what Kingdom
soever, lawful Prize; which was foreseen would bring Complaints from all
Places, as it did as soon as the War begun. <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> and
<HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Dane</HI> were alike treated; whilst their Ambassadours made loud
Complaints every Day to the King and the Council for the Injustice and the
Rapine, without Remedy, more than References to the Admiralty, and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
then to the Lords Commissioners of Appeal, which increased the Charge,
and raised and improved the Indignity. Above all, the <HI>Hanse-Towns</HI> of
<HI>Hamburgh, Lubeck, Bremen,</HI> and the rest (who had large Exemptions and
Privileges by Charter granted by former Kings and now renewed by this)
had the worst Luck; for none of them could ever be distinguished from
the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Their Ships were so like, and their Language so near, that not
one of their Vessels were met with, from what Part of the World soever
they came, or whithersoever they were bound, but they were brought in; and
if the Evidence was such as there could be no Colour to retain them, but
that they must be released, they always carried with them sad Remem∣brances<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of the Company they had been in.</P>
<P>THERE was one sure Rule to make any Ship Prize, which was, <HI>if above
three</HI> Dutch <HI>Mariners were aboard it there need no further Proof for the For∣feiture;</HI>
which being no where known could not be prevented, all Mer∣chants
Ships, when they are ready for their Voyage, taking all Seamen on
Board of what Nation soever who are necessary for their Service: So that
those <HI>Dutchmen</HI> who run from their own Country to avoid fighting (as very
many did, and very many more would have done), and put themselves on
Board Merchants Ships of any other Country, where They were willingly en∣tertained,
made those Ships lawful Prize in which They served, by a Rule<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that Nobody knew nor would submit to.</P>
<P>IT was resolved that all possible Encouragement should be given to Pri∣vateers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Too much En∣ceuragement given to Pri∣vateers.</NOTE>
that is, to as many as would take Commissions from the Admiral to
set out Vessels of War, as They call them, to take Prizes from the Enemy;
which no Articles or Obligations can restrain from all the Villany They can
act, and are a People, how countenanced soever or thought necessary, that
do bring an unavoidable Scandal, and it is to be feared a Curse, upon the
justest War that was ever made at Sea. A Sail! A Sail! is the Word with
them; Friend or Foe is the same; They possess all They can master, and
run with it to any obscure Place where They can sell it (which Retreats are<MILESTONE N="40"/>
never wanting), and never attend the Ceremony of an Adjudication. Be∣sides
the horrible Scandal and Clamour that this <HI>Classis</HI> of Men brought
upon the King and the whole Government for Defect of Justice, the Pre∣judice
which resulted from thence to the Publick and to the carrying on
the Service is unspeakable: All Seamen run to them. And though the
King now assigned an ample Share of all Prizes taken by his own Ships to
the Seamen, over and above their Wages; yet there was great Difference
between the Condition of the one and the other: In the King's Fleet They
might gain well, but They were sure of Blows, Nothing could be got there
without fighting; with the Privateers there was rarely fighting, They took<MILESTONE N="50"/>
all who could make little Resistance, and fled from all who were too strong
for them. And so those Fellows were always well manned, when the
King's Ships were compelled to stay many Days for Want of Men, who were
<PB N="243" REF="248"/>
raised by pressing and with great Difficulty. And whoever spake against
those lewd People, upon any Case whatsoever, was thought to have no Re∣gard
for the Duke's Profit, nor to desire to weaken the Enemy.</P>
<P>IN all former Wars at Sea, as there was great Care taken to appoint
Commissioners for the Sale of all Prize-Goods, who understood the Value
of those Commodities They had to sell, yet were compelled to sell better
Bargains than are usually got in publick Markets; so there was all Strictness
used in bringing all Receivers to as punctual an Account, as any other of
the King's Receivers are bound to make, and to compel them to pay in all
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the Money They receive into the Exchequer, that it might be issued out to
the Treasurer of the Navy or to other Officers for the Expense of the War.
And it had been a great Argument in the first Consultations upon this War,
“that it would support itself; and that after one good Fleet should be
set out once to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI>” (for that was never thought worthy of
a Doubt), “the Prizes, which would every Day after be taken, would plen∣tifully
do all the rest: Besides the great Sum that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would give to
purchase their Peace, and the yearly Rent They would give for the Liberty
of fishing;” with all which it was not thought fit to allow them “to keep
above such a Number of Ships of War, limited to so many Ton and to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>so many Guns;” with many Particulars of that Nature, which were care∣fully
digested by those who promoted the War. But now, after this
Supply given by the Parliament, there was no more Danger of Want of
Money: And many Discourses there were, “that the Prize-Money might
be better disposed in rebuilding the King's Houses, and many other good
Uses which would occur;” and the King forbore to speak any more of ap∣pointing
Receivers and Treasurers for that Purpose, when all or most other
Officers, who were judged necessary for the Service, were already named;
and the Lord Treasurer, who by his Office should have the Recommenda∣tion
of those Officers to the King, had a List of Men, who for the Repu∣tation
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and Experience They had were in his Judgment worthy to be trusted,
to be presented to the King when He should enter upon that Subject.</P>
<P>BUT one Evening a Servant of the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> came to the Chancellor
with a Bill signed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Ashley obtains a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appoint∣ing
him Trea∣surer of Prize-Money.</NOTE> and desired in his Master's Name “that it might be sealed
that Night.” The Bill was, “to make and constitute the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> Trea∣surer
of all the Money that should be raised upon the Sale of all Prizes, which
were or should be taken in this present War, with Power to make all
such Officers as should be necessary for the Service; and that He should
account for all Monies so received to the King himself, and to no other
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Person whatsoever, and pay and issue out all those Monies which He
should receive, in such Manner as his Majesty should appoint by Warrant
under his Sign Manual, and by no other Warrant; and that He should
be free and exempt from accounting into the Exchequer.” When the
Chancellor had seen the Contents, He bade the Messenger tell his Lord,
“that He would speak with the King before He would seal that Grant,
and that He desired much to speak with himself.”</P>
<P>THE next Morning He waited upon the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor remon∣strates against sealing this Grant.</NOTE> and informed him “of
the Bill that was brought to him, and doubted that He had been sur∣prised:
That it was not only such an Original as was without any Pre∣cedent,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>but in itself in many Particulars destructive to his Service and to
the Right of other Men. That all Receivers of any Part of his Revenue
were accountable in the Exchequer, and could receive their Discharge in
no other Place: And that if so great a Receipt, as this was already” (for
the Fleet of Wine and other Ships already seized were by a general Compu∣tation
<PB N="244" REF="249"/>
valued at one hundred thousand Pounds), “and as it evidently would
be, should pass without the most formal Account; his Majesty might
be abominably cozened, nor could it any other Way be prevented. And in
the next Place, that this Grant was not only derogatory to the Lord Trea∣surer,
but did really degrade him, there being another Treasurer made
more absolute than himself, and without Dependence upon him.” And
therefore He besought his Majesty, “that He would reconsider the Thing
itself and hear it debated, at least that the Treasurer might be first heard,
without which it could not be done in Justice:” To which He added,
that He would speak with the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> himself, and tell him how<MILESTONE N="10"/>
much He was to blame to affect such a Province, which might bring great
Inconveniences upon his Person and his Estate.”</P>
<P>HE quickly found that the King had not been surprised in what He had
done, “which” He said “was absolutely in his own Power to do; and that
it would bring Prejudice only to himself, which He had sufficiently pro∣vided
against.” However He seemed willing to decline any Thing that
looked like an Affront to the Treasurer, and therefore was content that the
sealing it might be suspended till He had further considered.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> came shortly to the Chancellor, and seemed “to take
it unkindly that his Patent was not sealed:” To which He answered, “that<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He had suspended the immediate sealing it for three Reasons; whereof
one was, that He might first speak with the King, who He believed
would receive much Prejudice by it; another, that it would not consist
with the Respect He owed to the Lord Treasurer, who was much af∣fronted
in it, to seal it before He was made acquainted with it. And in
the last Place, that He had stopped it for his, the Lord <HI>Ashley's,</HI> own Sake:
And that He believed He had neither enough considered the Indignity that
was offered to the Lord Treasurer, to whom He professed so much Res∣pect,
and by whose Favour and powerful Interposition He enjoyed the
Office He held, nor his own true Interest, in submitting his Estate to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
those Incumbrances which such a Receipt would inevitably expose it to.
And that the Exemption from making any Account but to the King him∣self
would deceive him: And as it was an unusual and unnatural Privi∣lege,
so it would never be allowed in any Court of Justice, which would
exact both the Account and the Payment or lawful Discharge of what Mo∣ney
He should receive; and if He depended upon the Exemption He
would live to repent it.”</P>
<P>HE answered little to the Particulars more than with some Sullenness,
that the King had given him the Office, and knew best what is good for his
own Service; and that except his Majesty retracted his Grant, He would<MILESTONE N="40"/>
look to enjoy the Benefit of it. That He did not desire to put an Af∣front
upon the Lord Treasurer; and if there were any Expressions in his
Commission which reflected upon him, He was content they should be
mended or left out: In all other Respects He was resolved to run the
Hazard.”</P>
<P>THE Treasurer himself, though He knew that He was not well used,
and exceedingly disdained the Behaviour of his Nephew (for the Lord
<HI>Ashley</HI> had married his Niece), who He well knew had by new Friendships
cancelled all the Obligations to him, would not appear to oppose what the
King resolved, but sate unconcerned and took no Notice of any Thing.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
And so within a short Time the King sent a positive Order to the Chan∣cellor
to seal the Commission;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King obliges him to seal it.</NOTE> which He could no longer refuse, and did
<PB N="245" REF="250"/>
it with the more Trouble, because He very well knew, that few Men knew
the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> better than the King himself did, or had a worse Opinion
of his Integrity. But He was now gotten into Friendships which were most
behooveful to him, and which could remove or reconcile all Prejudices:
He was fast linked to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> in a League of∣fensive
and defensive, the same Friends and the same Enemies, and had got
an entire Trust with the Lady, who very well understood the Benefit such
an Officer would be to her. Nor was it difficult to persuade the King
(who thought himself more rich in having one thousand Pounds in his Closet
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that Nobody knew of, than in fifty thousand Pounds in his Exchequer) how
many Conveniences He would find in having so much Money at his own
immediate Disposal, without the Formality of Privy Seals and other Mens
Warrants, and the Indecency and Mischief which would attend a formal
Account of all his generous Donatives and Expense, which should be known
only to himself.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King seemed to continue the same gracious Countenance
towards the Chancellor which He had used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures taken to pre∣judice the King against the Chancel∣lor.</NOTE> and frequently came to his
House when He was indisposed with the Gout, and consulted all his Busi∣ness,
which He thought of publick Importance, with him with equal
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Freedom; yet He himself found, and many others observed, that He had
not the same Credit and Power with him. The nightly Meetings had of
late made him more the Subject of the Discourse; and since the Time of
the new Secretary They had taken more Liberty to talk of what was done
in Council, than They had done formerly: And the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
pleased himself and all the Company in acting all the Persons who spake
there in their Looks and Motions, in which Piece of Mimickry He had an
especial Faculty; and in this Exercise the Chancellor had a full Part. In
the Height of Mirth, if the King said “He would go such a Journey or
do such a trivial Thing to-morrow,” Somebody would lay a Wager that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>He would not do it; and when He asked Why, it was answered, “that
the Chancellor would not let him:” And then another would protest,
that He thought there was no Ground for that Imputation; however He
could not deny that it was generally believed abroad, that his Majesty was
entirely and implicitly governed by the Chancellor.” Which often put
the King to declare in some Passion, “that the Chancellor had served him
long, and understood his Business, in which He trusted him: But in
any other Matter than his Business, He had no other Credit with him
than any other Man;” which They reported with great Joy in other
Companies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>IN the former Session of the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proposal made to the King for Li∣berty of Con∣science.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> out of his In∣differency
in Matters of Religion, and the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> out of his Good∣Will
to the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> had drawn in the Lord Privy Seal, whose In∣terest
was most in the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> to propose to the King an Indulgence
for Liberty of Conscience: For which They offered two Motives; the one,
“the Probability of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI>” though it was not then de∣clared;
“and in that Case the Prosecution of People at Home for their several
Opinions in Religion would be very inconvenient, and might prove mis∣chievous.”
The other was, “that the Fright Men were in by Reason
of the late Bill against Conventicles, and the Warmth the Parliament ex∣pressed
<MILESTONE N="50"/>with Reference to the Church, had so prepared all Sorts of Non-Conformists,
that They would gladly compound for Liberty at any rea∣sonable
Rates: And by this Means a good yearly Revenue might be raised
to the King, and a firm Concord and Tranquillity be established in the
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
Kingdom, if Power were granted by the Parliament to the King to grant
Dispensations to such whom He knew to be peaceably affected, for their Ex∣ercise
of that Religion which was agreeable to their Conscience, without
undergoing the Penalty of the Laws.” And They had prepared a Sche∣dule,
in which They computed what every <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> would be wil∣ling
to pay yearly for the Exercise of his Religion, and so of every other
Sect; which, upon the Estimate They made, would indeed have amounted
to a very great Sum of Money yearly.</P>
<P>THE King liked the Arguments and the Project very well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King op∣proves it.</NOTE> and wished
them to prepare such a Bill; which was done quickly, very short, and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
without any Mention of other Advantage to grow from it, than “the Peace
and Quiet of the Kingdom, and an entire Reference to the King's own Judg∣ment
and Discretion in dispensing his Dispensations.” This was equally
approved: And though hitherto it had been managed with great Secrecy,
that it might not come to the Knowledge of the Chancellor and the Trea∣surer,
who They well knew would never consent to it; yet the King re∣solved
to impart it to them. And the Chancellor being then afflicted with the
Gout, the Committee that used to be called was appointed to meet at
<HI>Worcester-House:</HI> And thither likewise came the Privy Seal and the Lord
<HI>Ashley,</HI> who had never before been present in those Meetings.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE King informed them of the Occasion of their Conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor and Trea∣surer oppose it at the private Committee.</NOTE> and
caused the Draught for the Bill to be read to them; which was done, and
such Reasons given by those who promoted it, as They thought fit; the
chief of which was, “that there could be no Danger in trusting the King,
whose Zeal to the Protestant Religion was so well known, that Nobody
would doubt that He would use this Power, when granted to him, other∣wise
than should be for the Good and Benefit of the Church and State.”
The Chancellor and the Treasurer, as had been presaged, were very warm
against it, and used many Arguments to dissuade the King from prose∣cuting
it, “as a Thing that could never find the Concurrence of either or<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Both Houses, and which would raise a Jealousy in Both, and in the Peo∣ple
generally, of his Affection to the <HI>Papists,</HI> which would not be good
for either, and every Body knew that He had no Favour for either of the
other Factions.” But what the others said, who were of another Opinion,
prevailed more; and his Majesty declared, “that the Bill should be presented
to the House of Peers as from him, and in his Name; and that He hoped
none of his Servants, who knew his Mind as well as every Body there did,
would oppose it, but either be absent or silent:” To which Both the
Lords answered, “that They should not be absent purposely, and if They
were present, They hoped his Majesty would excuse them if They spake<MILESTONE N="40"/>
according to their Conscience and Judgment, which They could not for∣bear
to do;” with which his Majesty seemed unsatisfied, though the Lords
of the Combination were better pleased than They would have been with
their Concurrence.</P>
<P>WITHIN few Days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill pre∣sented to the House of Lords.</NOTE> the Chancellor remaining still in his Chamber
without being able to go, the Bill was presented in the House of Peers by
the Lord Privy Seal, as by the King's Direction and Approbation, and
thereupon had the first Reading: And as soon as it was read, the Lord
Treasurer spake against it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treasurer and Bishops oppos it at the first Reading.</NOTE> “as unfit to be received and to have the Counte∣nance
of another Reading in the House, being a Design against the Pro∣testant<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Religion and in Favour of the <HI>Papists,</HI>” with many sharp Reflec∣tions
upon those who had spoken for it; and many of the Bishops spake
to the same Purpose, and urged many weighty Arguments against it. However
<PB N="247" REF="252"/>
it was moved, “that since it was averred <HI>that it was with the King's Pri∣vity,</HI>
it would be a Thing unheard of to deny it a second Reading:” And
that there might be no Danger of a Surprisal by its being read in a thin
House, it was ordered “that it should be read the second Time” upon a
Day named “at ten of the Clock in the Morning;” with which all were
satisfied.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time great Pains were taken to persuade particular Men to
approve it: And some of the Bishops were sharply reprehended for opposing
the King's Prerogative, with some Intimation “that if They continued in that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Obstinacy They would repent it;” to which They made such Answers
as in Honesty and Wisdom They ought to do, without being shaken in
their Resolution. It was rather insinuated than declared, “that the Bill
had been perused,” some said “drawn, by the Chancellor,” and averred
that He was not against it:” Which being confidently reported, and be∣lieved
or not believed as He was more or less known to the Persons present,
He thought himself obliged to make his own Sense known. And so on the
Day appointed for the second Reading, with Pain and Difficulty He was
in his Place in the House: And so after the second Reading of the Bill, He
was of Course to propose the Commitment of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treasurer and Bishops oppose it at the second Read∣ing.</NOTE> Many of the Bishops and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>others spake fiercely against it, as a Way to undermine Religion; and the
Lord Treasurer with his usual Weight of Words shewed the ill Consequence
that must attend it, and “that in the Bottom it was a Project to get Money
at the Price of Religion; which He believed was not intended or known
to the King, but only to those who had projected it, and it may be im∣posed
upon others who meant well.”</P>
<P>THE Lord Privy Seal, either upon the Observation of the Countenance
of the House or Advertisement of his Friends, or unwilling to venture his
Reputation in the Enterprise, had given over the Game the first Day, and
now spake not at all:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Ashley <HI>speaks for it.</HI></NOTE> But the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> adhered firmly to his Point, spake
<MILESTONE N="30"/>often and with great Sharpness of Wit, and had a Cadence in his Words
and Pronunciation that drew Attention. He said, “it was the King's
Misfortune that a Matter of so great Concernment to him, and such a
Prerogative as it may be would be found to be inherent in him without
any Declaration of Parliament, should be supported only by such weak
Men as himself, who served his Majesty at a Distance, whilst the great
Officers of the Crown thought fit to oppose it; which He more wondered
at, because Nobody knew more than They the King's unshakeable Firm∣ness
in his Religion, that had resisted and vanquished so many great
Temptations; and therefore He could not be thought unworthy of a
<MILESTONE N="40"/>greater Trust with Reference to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor speaks against it.</NOTE> than He would have by this Bill.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, having not been present at the former Debate upon the
first Day, thought it fit to sit silent in this, till He found the House in some
Expectation to hear his Opinion: And then He stood up and said, “that
no Man could say more, if it were necessary or pertinent, of the King's
Constancy in his Religion, and of his understanding the Constitution and
Foundation of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than He; no Man had been Wit∣ness
to more Assaults which He had sustained than He had been, and
of many Victories; and therefore if the Question were how far He might
be trusted in that Point, He should make no Scruple in declaring, that
<MILESTONE N="50"/>He thought him more worthy to be trusted than any Man alive. But
there was Nothing in that Bill that could make that the Question, which
had confounded all Notions of Religion, and erected a Chaos of Policy
to overthrow all Religion and Government: So that the Question was
<PB N="248" REF="253"/>
not, whether the King were worthy of that Trust, but whether that Trust
were worthy of the King. That it had been no new Thing for Kings to
divest themselves of many particular Rights and Powers, because They
were thereby exposed to more Trouble and Vexation, and so deputed that
Authority to others qualified by them: And He thought it a very unrea∣sonable
and unjust Thing to commit such a Trust to the King, which
Nobody could suppose He could execute himself, and yet must subject
him to daily and hourly Importunities, which must be so much the more
uneasy to a Nature of so great Bounty and Generosity, that Nothing is so
ungrateful to him as to be obliged to deny.”<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>IN the Vehemence of this Debate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And drops some unguard∣ed Expressions.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> having used some
Language that He knew reflected upon him, the Chancellor let fall some
unwary Expressions, which were turned to his Reproach and remembered
long after. When He insisted upon the Wildness and Illimitedness in the
Bill, He said, “it was Ship-Money in Religion, that Nobody could know
the End of, or where it would rest; that if it were passed, Dr. <HI>Goffe,</HI>
or any other Apostate from the Church of <HI>England</HI> might be made a Bi∣shop
or Archbishop here, all Oaths and Statutes and Subscriptions being
dispensed with:” Which were thought two envious Instances, and gave
his Enemies Opportunities to make Glosses and Reflections upon to his Dis∣advantage.<MILESTONE N="20"/>
In this Debate it fell out that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> appeared very
much against the Bill; which was imputed to the Chancellor, and served
to <HI>heap Coals of Fire upon his Head.</HI> In the End, very few having spoken for
it, though there were many who would have consented to it, besides the
Catholick Lords, it was agreed that there should be no Question put for the
Commitment; which was the most civil Way of rejecting it, and left it to
be no more called for.</P>
<P>THE King was infinitely troubled at the ill Success of this Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of∣fended with the Chancellor and Treasurer.</NOTE> which He
had been assured would pass notwithstanding the Opposition that was ex∣pected;
and it had produced one Effect that was foreseen though not be∣lieved,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in renewing the Bitterness against the <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> And
They, who watched all Occasions to perform those Offices, had now a large
Field to express their Malice against the Chancellor and the Treasurer,
whose Pride only had disposed them to shew their Power and Credit in
diverting the House from gratifying the King, to which They had been
inclined;” and his Majesty heard all that could be said against them
without any Dislike. After two or three Days He sent for them Both to∣gether
into his Closet, which made it generally believed in the Court, that
He resolved to take Both their Offices from them, and They did in Truth
believe and expect it: But there was never any Cause appeared after to think<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that it was in his Purpose. He spake to them of other Business, without
taking the least Notice of the other Matter, and dismissed them with a Coun∣tenance
less open than He used to have towards them, and made it evident
that He had not the same Thoughts of them He had formerly.</P>
<P>AND when the next Day the Chancellor went to him alone, and was
admitted into his Cabinet, and began to take Notice “that He seemed to
have Dissatisfaction in his Looks towards him;” the King, in more Choler
than He had ever before seen him, told him, “his Looks were such as
they ought to be; that He was very much unsatisfied with him, and
thought He had used him very ill; that He had deserved better of him,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and did not expect that He would have carried himself in that Manner as
He had done in the House of Peers, having known his Majesty's own Opi∣nion
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
from himself, which it seemed was of no Authority with him if it dif∣fered
from his Judgment, to which He would not submit against his Reason.”</P>
<P>THE other, with the Confidence of an honest Man, entered upon the
Discourse of the Matter, assured him “the very proposing it had done his
Majesty much Prejudice, and that They who were best affected to his
Service in Both Houses were much troubled and afflicted with it: And of
those who advised him to it, one knew Nothing of the Constitution of
<HI>England,</HI> and was not thought to wish well to the Religion of it; and the
other was so well known to him, that Nothing was more wonderful than
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that his Majesty should take him for a safe Counsellor.” He had Recourse
then again to the Matter, and used some Arguments against it which had not
been urged before, and which seemed to make Impression. He heard all He
said with Patience, but seemed not to change his Mind, and answered no
more than “that it was no Time to speak to the Matter, which was now
passed; and if it had been unseasonably urged, He might still have
carried himself otherwise than He had done;” and so spake of Some∣what
else.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty did not withdraw any of his Trust or Confidence from him
in his Business, and seemed to have the same Kindness for him: But from
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that Time He never had the same Credit with him as He had before. The
Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> got no Ground, but Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> very much, who,
though He spake very little in Council, shewed his Power out of it, by per
suading his Majesty to recede from many Resolutions He had taken there.
And afterwards in all the Debates in Council which were preparatory to the
War, and upon those Particulars which have been mentioned before, which
concerned the Justice and Policy that was to be observed, whatsoever was
offered by the Chancellor or Treasurer was never considered. It was An∣swer
enough, “that They were Enemies to the War;” which was true, as
long as it was in Deliberation: But from the Time it was resolved and re∣mediless,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>none of them who promoted it contributed any Thing to the car∣rying
it on proportionably to what was done by the other two.</P>
<P>THERE was another and a greater Mischief than hath been mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with the Bishops.</NOTE>
that resulted from that unhappy Debate; which was the Prejudice and
Disadvantage that the Bishops underwent by their so unanimous Dislike of
that Bill. For from that Time the King never treated any of them with
that Respect as He had done formerly, and often spake of them too slightly;
which easily encouraged others not only to mention their Persons very neg∣ligently,
but their Function and Religion itself, as an Invention to im∣pose
upon the free Judgments and Understandings of Men. What was
<MILESTONE N="40"/>preached in the Pulpit was commented upon and derided in the Chamber, and
Preachers acted, and Sermons vilified as laboured Discourses, which the
Preachers made only to shew their own Parts and Wit, without any other
Design than to be commended and preferred. These grew to be the Subjects
of the Mirth and Wit of the Court; and so much License was manifested in
it, that gave infinite Scandal to those who observed it, and to those who
received the Reports of it: And all serious and prudent Men took it as an
ill Presage, that whilst all warlike Preparations were made in Abundance
suitable to the Occasion, there should so little Preparation of Spirit be for a
War against an Enemy, who might possibly be without some of our Virtues,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>but assuredly was without any of our Vices.</P>
<P>THERE begun now to appear another Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plague breaks out.</NOTE> much more formidable
than the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and more difficult to be struggled with; which was the
Plague, that brake out in the Winter, and made such an early Progress in
<PB N="250" REF="255"/>
the Spring, that though the weekly Numbers did not rise high, and it ap∣peared
to be only in the Outskirts of the Town, and in the most obscure
Alleys, amongst the poorest People; yet the ancient Men, who well re∣membered
in what Manner the last great Plague (which had been near forty
Years before) first brake out, and the Progress it afterwards made, fore∣told
a terrible Summer. And many of them removed their Families out
of the City to Country-Habitations; when their Neighbours laughed at their
Providence, and thought They might have stayed without Danger: But
They found shortly that They had done wisely. In <HI>March</HI> it spread so
much, that the Parliament was very willing to part: Which was likewise<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the more necessary, in Regard that so many of the Members of the House of
Commons were assigned to so many Offices and Employments which related
to the War, and which required their immediate Attendance. For though
the Fleet was not yet gone out, yet there were many Prizes daily brought
in, besides the first Seizure, which by this Time was adjudged lawful Prize;
in all which great Loss was sustained by the License of Officers as well
as common Men, and the Absence of such as should restrain and punish it:
So that, as soon as the Bill was passed the Houses for the good Aid They
had given the King, and was ready for the Royal Assent, his Majesty passed
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment pro∣rogued.</NOTE> and prorogued the Parliament in <HI>April</HI> (which was in 1665) till <HI>Sep∣tember</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
following; his Majesty declaring, “that if it pleased God to extin∣guish
or allay the Fierceness of the Plague,” which at that Time raged
more, “He should be glad to meet them then; by which Time They
would judge by some Success of the War, what was more to be done.
But if that Visitation increased, They should have Notice by Proclama∣tion
that They might not hazard themselves.”</P>
<P>THE Parliament being thus prorogued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleet pre∣pared.</NOTE> there was the same Reason to
hasten out the Fleet; towards which the Duke left Nothing undone, which
his unwearied Industry and Example could contribute towards it, being him∣self
on Board, and having got all Things necessary into his own Ship that<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He cared for. But He found that it was absolutely requisite to put out
to Sea, though many Things were wanting in other Ships, even of Beer
and other Provision of Victual; not only to be before the Enemy, but be∣cause
He saw it would be impossible, whilst the Ships were in Port, to keep
the Seamen from going on Shore, by which They might bring the Plague
on Board with them; and there was already a Suspicion that the Infection
was got into one of the smaller Ships.</P>
<P>IT hath been said before, that all Things relating to the Fleet were upon
the Matter wholly governed by Mr. <HI>Coventry.</HI> It is very true, that the
Officers of the Navy constantly attended the Duke together with those<MILESTONE N="40"/>
three Sea-Captains who have been named before:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>York</HI> consults much with three eminent Sea Officers.</NOTE> But from the Time that the
War was declared, his Highness consulted daily, for his own Information
and Instruction, with Sir <HI>John Lawson</HI> and Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> and Sir
<HI>William Pen,</HI> all Men of great Experience, and who had commanded in
several Battles. Upon the Advice of these Men the Duke always made his
Estimates and all Propositions to the King. There was somewhat of Ri∣valship
between the two last, because They had been in equal Command:
Therefore the Duke took Sir <HI>William Pen</HI> into his own Ship, and made
him Captain of it; which was a great Trust, and a very honourable Com∣mand,
that exempted him from receiving any Orders but from the Duke,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and so extinguished the other Emulation, the other two being Flag-Of∣ficers
and to command several Squadrons.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="256"/>
IN all Conferences with these Men Mr. <HI>Coventry's</HI> Presence and Attend∣ance
was necessary, both to reduce all Things into Writing which were
agreed upon, and to be able to put the Duke in Mind of what He was to
do. <HI>Lawson</HI> was the Man of whose Judgment the Duke had the best
Esteem: And He was in Truth, of a Man of that Breeding (for He was a
perfect Tarpawlin), a very extraordinary Person; He understood his Pro∣fession
incomparably well, spake clearly and pertinently, but not pertina∣ciously
enough when He was contradicted. <HI>Ayscue</HI> was a Gentleman, but
had kept ill Company too long, which had blunted his Understanding, if
<MILESTONE N="10"/>it had been ever sharp: He was of few Words, yet spake to the Purpose
and to be easily understood. <HI>Pen,</HI> who had much the worst Understand∣ing,
had a great Mind to appear better bred, and to speak like a Gentle∣man;
He had got many good Words which He used at Adventure; He
was a formal Man, and spake very leisurely but much, and left the Matter
more intricate and perplexed than He found it. He was entirely governed
by Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who still learned enough of him to offer any Thing ra∣tionally
in the Debate, or to cross what was not agreeable to his own
Fancy, by which He was still swayed out of the Pride and Perverseness
of his Will.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>UPON Debate and Conference with these Men, the Duke brought Pro∣positions
to the King reduced into Writing by Mr. <HI>Coventry;</HI> and the King
commonly consulted them with the Lord Treasurer in his Presence, the
Propositions being commonly for Increase of the Expense, which Mr. <HI>Co∣ventry</HI>
was solicitous by all the Ways possible to contrive. To those Consul∣tations
the Duke always brought the Sea-Officers, and Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who
spake much more than They, to explain especially what Sir <HI>William Pen</HI> said,
who took upon himself to speak most, and often what the others had never
thought though They durst not contradict; and Sir <HI>John Lawson</HI> often
complained, “that Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> put that in Writing which had never been
<MILESTONE N="30"/>proposed by them, and would continue disputing it till They yielded.”
Every Conference raised the Charge very much; and what They proposed
Yesterday as enough was To-day made twice as much; if They proposed
six Fire-Ships to be provided, within two or three Days They demanded
twelve: So there could be no possible Computation of the Charge.</P>
<P>BY this Means the Fleet that was now ready to put to Sea amounted
to fourscore Sail;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke puts out to Sea.</NOTE> and the King willingly consented, upon the Reasons
the Duke presented to him, that they should set Sail as soon as was possible.
And before the End of <HI>April</HI> the Duke was with the whole Fleet at Sea,
and visited the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> and took many Ships in their View, their
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Fleet being not yet in Readiness.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Noble∣men go as Vo∣lunteers.</NOTE> Many Noblemen, the Earl of <HI>Peterbo∣rough,</HI>
the Lord Viscount <HI>Ferrers,</HI> and others, with many Gentlemen of
Quality, went as Volunteers, and were distributed into the several Ships
with much Countenance by the Duke, and as many taken into his own
Ship as could be done with Convenience.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had from the first Mention of the War,
which He promoted all He could, declared “that He would make one in
“it:” And when it was declared, He desired to have the Command of a
Ship, which the Duke positively denied to give him, except the King com∣manded
it (and his Majesty was content to refer that, as He did the Nomi∣nation
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of all the other Officers, to his Brother), and did not think fit that
a Man, of what Quality soever, who had never been at Sea, should his
first Voyage have the Command of any considerable Ship (and a small
one had not been for his Honour); at which He was much troubled.
<PB N="252" REF="257"/>
Yet his Friends told him that He was too far engaged, to stay at Home
when his Royal Highness ventured his own Person: And thereupon He re∣solved
to go a Volunteer, and put himself on Board a Flag-Ship, the
Captain whereof was in his Favour. And then He desired, “that in Respect
of his Quality, and his being a Privy Counsellor, He might be present in
all Councils of War.” The Duke thought this not reasonable, and would
not make a new Precedent. There were many of the ancient Nobility,
Earls and Barons, who were then on Board as Volunteers; and if the Con∣sideration
of Quality might entitle them to be present in Council, all Orders
would be broken, there being none called but Flag-Officers: And therefore<MILESTONE N="10"/>
his Royal Highness positively refused to gratify him in that Point; which
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> thought (it being enough known that the Duke
had neither Esteem or Kindness for him) to be such a personal Disobligation,
that would well excuse him for declining the Enterprise. And pretending
that He did appeal to the King in Point of Right, He left the Fleet, and
returned to the Shore to complain. And We return back too to the View
of other Particulars.</P>
<P>THERE were two Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some new Peers made.</NOTE> whom the King and his Brother did desire to
make remarkable by some extraordinary Favours: One of which was equally
grateful to Both,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Charles Berkley <HI>created Earl of</HI> Falmouth.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who had been lately created an <HI>Irish</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
Viscount by the Name of Lord <HI>Fitzharding,</HI> the old and true Surname of
the Family; upon whom the King had, for Reasons only known to him∣self,
fet his Affection so much, that He had never denied any Thing He
asked for himself or for any Body else, and was well content that He should
be looked upon as his Favourite. He had been long thought so to the Duke,
who was willing to promote any Thing to his Advantage: And the King
had deferred those Instances only till the Parliament should be prorogued,
left it should raise the Appetites of others to make Suits, which He had hi∣therto
defended himself from, by declaring He would make no more Lords.
But the Parliament was no sooner prorogued, than it was resolved to be put<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in Execution: And when it was to be done, the Chancellor had the Ho∣nour
to be present alone with the King and Duke, when it seemed to be
first thought of. And when the Duke proposed it as a Suit to the King,
that He would make the Lord <HI>Fitzharding</HI> an Earl, extolling his Courage
and Affection to the King; He was pleased with the Motion to that De∣gree,
that He extolled him with Praises which could be applied to few Men:
And it was quickly resolved that He should be an Earl of <HI>England,</HI> and a
Title was as soon found out; and so He was created Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> be∣fore
He had one Foot of Land in the World.</P>
<P>AND to gratify the King for this Favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And sir</HI> H. Bennet <HI>Lord</HI> Arlington.</NOTE> the Duke likewise proposed<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that the King would make Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> a Lord, whom all the World
knew He did not care for; which was as willingly granted: And He
had no more Estate than the other, and could not so easily find a Title for
his Barony. But because He had no Mind to retain his own Name, which
was no good one, his first Warrant was to be created <HI>Cheney,</HI> which was
an ancient Barony expired, and to which Family He had not the least Re∣lation:
And for some Days upon the signing the Warrant He was called
Lord <HI>Cheney,</HI> until a Gentleman of the best Quality in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI>
who though He had no Title to the Barony was yet of the same Family,
and inherited most Part of the Estate, which was very considerable, and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
was married to a Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> heard of it, and
made Haste to stop it. He went first to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> himself, and
desired him “not to affect a Title to which He had no Relation; and to
<PB N="253" REF="258"/>
which though He could not pretend of direct Right, yet He was not so
obscure but that himself or a Son of his might hereafter be thought worthy
of it by the Crown; and in that Respect it would be some Trouble to
him to see it vested in the Family of a Stranger.” The Secretary did not
give him so civil an Answer as He expected, having no Knowledge of the
Gentleman. Yet shortly after, upon Information of his Condition and
Quality (as He was in all Respects very worthy of Consideration), the Pa∣tent
being not yet prepared, He was contented to take the Title of a little
Farm that had belonged to his Father and was sold by him, and now in the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Possession of another private Person; and so was created Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI>
the proper and true Name of the Place being <HI>Harlington,</HI> a little Village
between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Uxbridge.</HI></P>
<P>THE King took the Occasion to make these two Noblemen from an
Obligation that lay upon him to confer two Honours at the same Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Fresche∣ville <HI>created Lord</HI> Fresche∣ville.</NOTE>
the one upon Mr. <HI>Frescheville,</HI> of a very ancient Family in <HI>Derbyshire</HI> and
a fair Estate, who had been always bred in the Court, a menial Servant of
the last King, and had served him in the Head of a Troop of Horse raised
at his own Charge in the War, and whom his late Majesty had promised to
make a Baron.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE other was Mr. <HI>Richard Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Mr.</HI> Ri∣chard Arun∣del <HI>Lord</HI> A∣rundel <HI>of</HI> Tre∣rice.</NOTE> a Gentle∣man
as well known by what He had done and suffered in the late Time, as
by the Eminency of his Family, and the Fortune He was still Master of af∣ter
the great Depredation of the Time. <HI>John Arundel,</HI> his Father, was of
the best Interest and Estate of the Gentlemen of <HI>Cornwall:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The eminent Services of this Gentle∣man and his Family.</NOTE> And in the Be∣ginning
of the Troubles, when the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> and the other Gentlemen
with him were forced to retire into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> He and his Friends sup∣ported
them, and gave the first Turn and Opposition to the Current of the
Parliament's Usurpation; and to them, their Courage and Activity, all the
Success that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had afterwards was justly to be imputed as
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to the first Rise. The old Gentleman was then above seventy Years of
Age, and infirm; but all his Sons He engaged in the War: The two
eldest were eminent Officers, Both Members of the House of Commons,
and the more zealous Soldiers by having been Witnesses of the naughty Pro∣ceedings
of those who had raised the Rebellion. The eldest was killed in
the Head of his Troop, charging and driving back a bold Sally that was
made out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> when it was besieged: And this other Gentleman of
whom We now speak, and who was then the younger Brother, was an ex∣cellent
Colonel of Foot to the End of the War.</P>
<P>WHEN Sir <HI>Nicholas Slanning,</HI> who was Governour of <HI>Pendennis,</HI> lost his
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Life bravely in the Siege of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the King knew not into what Hands to
commit that important Place so securely, as by sending a Commission to old
<HI>John Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> to command, well knowing that it must be preserved
principally by his Interest; and in Respect of his Age joined his eldest Son
with him: And after his Death He added the younger Brother to the Com∣mand,
of whom We are speaking, who was in Truth then looked upon as
the most powerful Person in that County.</P>
<P>WHEN the King, then Prince, was compelled after almost the whole
<HI>West</HI> was lost to retire into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> He remained in <HI>Pendennis Castle,</HI> and
from thence made his first Embarcation to <HI>Scilly:</HI> And at parting, out of a
<MILESTONE N="50"/>princely Sense of the Affection and Service of that Family, He took the old
Gentleman aside, and in the Presence of his Son wished him “to defend
the Place as long as He could, because Relief might come, of which there
was some Hope from abroad;” and promised him, “if He lived to come
<PB N="254" REF="259"/>
back into <HI>England</HI> He would make him a Baron, and if He were dead
He would make it good to his Son.” The old Man behaved him bravely
to his Death, having all his Estate taken from him; and his Son remained
as eminently faithful, and had as deep Marks of it as any Man: So that
at the King's Return, who never forgat his Promise, He might have
received the Effect of it in the first Creation, if He had desired it; but He
chose rather to recover the Bruises his Fortune had endured by Seizures and
Sequestrations, before He would embark him in a Condition that must pre∣sently
raise his Expense in his Way of Living. And as soon as He found
himself at Ease in that Respect, He got a Friend to inform the King, “that<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He was ready to receive his Bounty.”</P>
<P>AND his Majesty, being under these two Obligations, was willing to
take the same Opportunity to prefer the two other Persons He loved so well.
But at the same Time that He declared his Resolution for the last two (but
what concerned the others had been long known and expected), his Majesty
reflected upon the Number of the House of Peers, which was in many Re∣spects
found grievous, and declared to his Brother and the Chancellor, who
were only present, “that no Importunity should prevail with him to make
any more Lords in many Years, and till the present Number should be
lessened;” in which Resolution the Duke willingly concurred, and pro∣tested<MILESTONE N="20"/>
“that He would never more importune him in that Point.” The
Reason of mentioning this Declaration and Resolution will appear hereafter.
This Creation was no sooner over, than the new Earl of <HI>Falmouth</HI> went with
the Duke to Sea: For though his Relation was now immediately to the
King and near his Person, yet He thought himself obliged not to be from
the Duke when He was to be engaged in so much Danger; and He was
confessed by all Men to abound in a most fearless Courage.</P>
<P>IT will not be unseasonable in this Place to take a View of an Act of
State that passed about this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A particular Relation of passing the</HI> Ca∣nary <HI>Patent.</HI></NOTE> and which afterwards administered Matter
of Reproach against the Chancellor, and was made Use of by his Enemies<MILESTONE N="30"/>
as an Evidence of his Corruption; for the better understanding whereof, it
will be necessary to begin the Relation from the original Ground of the Coun∣sel.
About the first <HI>Christmas</HI> after the King's happy Return into <HI>England,</HI>
the Chancellor, Treasurer, Privy Seal, and the two Chief Justices (being the
Persons appointed by the Statute for that Purpose) met together to set the
Prices upon the several Sorts of Wines; and were attended, according to
Custom, by the Company of Vintners, and the chief Merchants in the City
who traded in that Commodity. And being first to limit the Merchants to
a reasonable Rate, before They could prescribe any Price to the Vintners
upon the Retail, They found, by the best Enquiry They could make, that<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the first Prices beyond the Seas which the Merchants paid for their Wines
were so excessive, that the Retail could not be brought within any Com∣pass;
and that since the Beginning of the Troubles the Price of Wines in
general was exceedingly increased, and particularly that of the <HI>Canaries</HI> was
almost double to what it had been in the Year 1640.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew very well, by the Correspondence He had held in
the <HI>Canaries</HI> (during the Time that He had served his Majesty as his Am∣bassadour
in <HI>Spain</HI>), that the whole Trade for the <HI>Canary</HI> Wine was driven
solely by the <HI>English,</HI> and the Commodity entirely vended in the King's
Dominions, all <HI>Christendom</HI> beside not spending any Quantity of that Wine:<MILESTONE N="50"/>
And thereupon He asked the Merchants “whether what He had reported was
not true, and what would be the Way to remedy that Mischief.”</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260"/>
THEY all confessed it to be very true, and “that it was a great Reproach
to the Nation to be so much imposed upon in a Trade that They might
govern themselves: And that the unreasonable Prices of the Wine were not
the greatest Prejudice that was befallen that Trade. That before the Troubles
They had been so far from employing any Stock of Money for the Support
of that Traffick, that They used to send their Ships fully laden with all
Commodities thither, which yielded very good Markets, being sent from
thence into the <HI>West-Indies</HI> with their <HI>Plate</HI> Fleets; and that the very
Pipe-Staves which They carried did very near supply the Value of their
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Wine, so that They brought Home the Proceed of their Commodities
either in Pieces of <HI>Eight,</HI> or such other Merchandises as had been brought
thither from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and upon which They received great Profit. On
the contrary, that the Trade was now wholly driven by ready Money;
that the Commodities They send thither are not taken off, except at their
own Prices, so that They have for the late Years sent their Vessels empty
thither, except only with some few Pipe-Staves, which by the Destruction
in <HI>Ireland</HI> They could not send in any great Proportion; and that their
Ships return from thence with no other Lading but those Wines, which
They trade for in ready Money, either by Pieces of <HI>Eight</HI> sent in their
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Ships from hence, or by Bills of Exchange charged upon some known
Merchants in <HI>Spain.</HI> That over and above these Disadvantages, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in those Islands had of late imposed new Duties upon the Wine,
and laid other Impositions upon the Merchants than the <HI>English</HI> Nation
had been ever accustomed to.” They said, “all these Inconveniences pro∣ceeded
from the immoderate Appetite this Nation hath for that Sort of
Wine, and therefore They take from them as much as They can make;
and from our own Disorder and Irregularity in buying them, and con∣tending
who shall get the most, and so raising the Price upon one ano∣ther,
and making the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves the Judges what the Mer∣chants
<MILESTONE N="30"/>shall pay.”</P>
<P>THE Lords, upon Consultation between themselves, found the Matter
too hard for them, and that the Reformation of so much Evil must be
made by Degrees, and upon a Representation of the Whole, with the Dif∣ficulties
which attended it, to the King and his Privy Council, whose Wis∣doms
only could provide a Remedy proportionable to the Mischiefs. For the
present, as They resolved not to raise the Prices at which Wine was at that
Time bought and sold (which They believed, how reasonably soever it
might be done, would yet be very unpopular), so They thought it not just
to draw down and abate those Prices, since it appeared to them that the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Wines cost more in Proportion upon the Places of their Growth. They
declared therefore to the Merchants and to the Vintners, “that though for
the present They would permit the same Prices to continue for the next
Year, which they had been sold for the present Year,” and which indeed
were confirmed by the late Act of Parliament, “They should hereafter take
Care what Markets They made; for that They were resolved the next
Year to make the Prices much lower both to the Merchant and to the
Vintner:” And so, upon the Report made by the Lords of the whole
Matter to the King in Council, and of what They thought fit to be done
for the present, a Proclamation was published accordingly.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>THE next Year both the Merchants and Vintners were very earnest Suitors
to the Lords at their accustomed Meeting, that greater Prices might be
allowed, or at least that the same might be continued; making it very evi∣dent,
that their Wines cost them more than they had done the Year before.
<PB N="256" REF="261"/>
Upon the Debate the <HI>Canary</HI> Merchants were much divided. Some of
them insisted very importunately to have the Price raised, “because it was
notorious that They had paid much more than formerly, by Reason,” as
They alleged, “that the Vintage had not yielded near the Proportion that
it used to do.” Others, though confessing the Increase of Price, yet pre∣tended
a more publick Spirit and the Necessity of a Reformation: And
therefore They pressed as earnestly, “that the Price might not be raised,
but that They might be permitted to take what They had done already
for this Year.” It was quickly discovered whence this Moderation proceeded;
and that the last Proposers had a great Quantity of Wine upon their Hands,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which had been provided the Year before, and so might well be sold at
the same Price; but that the former had no old Wine left, but were sup∣plied
with a full Provision of new, which had cost them so much dearer.
Both the one and the other desired the Lords, “that whatever Resolution
They took for the present, a Clause might be inserted in the Proclama∣tion,
<HI>That, the next Year which followed,</HI> Canary <HI>Wine should not be sold for
above four and twenty Pounds the Pipe, and that every Year after it should
be drawn lower,</HI>” as it might well be, it having been sold in the Year
1640 for twenty Pounds the Pipe; though, in the Year when his Majesty
returned, it had been permitted to be sold at six and thirty Pounds the Pipe.<MILESTONE N="20"/>
“Such a Clause,” They said, “would give Notice to the Islanders, and
oblige them to sell their Wines at more reasonable Rates, and would ren∣der
the Merchants unexcusable if They should give greater.” Notwith∣standing
all their Allegations, the Lords remembered what They had de∣clared
to them the last Year, which was as fair a Warning as any Thing
They could now say would be. And accordingly They set lower Prices
upon all Wines for the Year to come than had been allowed the last, as the
most effectual Warning for the future: Which was thought a very rigorous
Proceeding; but being reported to the King and Council, what They had
done was allowed and confirmed, and his Majesty was well contented that<MILESTONE N="30"/>
such a Clause as They had proposed should be inserted in the Proclamation;
which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>THE Year following, when the Lords met again according to Custom,
which is as hath been said about <HI>Christmas,</HI> They found not the least Reforma∣tion;
on the contrary, that the <HI>Canary</HI> Merchants had paid dearer than
ever, which made them all more solicitous to have the Price raised, and the
Vintners as importunate for their Retail. And indeed the Vintners seemed
to be in a much worse Condition than the Merchants. And They made
it appear, “that They were often compelled to pay higher Prices to the
Merchant than were imposed by their Lordships; without which They<MILESTONE N="40"/>
could get no good Wine, and so must give over their keeping House:
That the Penalty upon the Merchant was very small, being not above
forty Shillings a Pipe, and the Crime not easy to be discovered, as was
evident by there not having been one Merchant questioned in many Years
for that common Transgression; whereas on the Vintner's Part the Pe∣nalty
was very severe, and easily discovered by any Man who went to a
Tavern and would be an Informer, and that most of the Vintners in
<HI>London</HI> were at that very Time sued in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> upon those very
Penalties, which if exacted must produce their Ruin.”</P>
<P>THE Merchants excused themselves for their present Pretence, and for<MILESTONE N="50"/>
their having given more for their Wines than was lawful for them to have
done by their own Desire: “That They had done their best, and that the
greatest Traders amongst them had consented between themselves not to
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
suffer the Prices to be raised upon them; but that They found it ineffec∣tual,
and that though They should give over their Trades it would pro∣duce
no Reformation. That the Trade was open to all Adventurers, and
that there had been many Ships sent from <HI>England</HI> in that very Year by
<HI>Jews,</HI> and People of several Trades, who had never been before known to
trade to the <HI>Canaries:</HI> Insomuch as when They who had been long bred
up to the Trade, and had been long Factors in those Islands, sent their
Ships thither, They found other <HI>English</HI> Ships there, and the Wines
bought at a greater Price than They had allowed their Factors to give;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>so that They must either have their Ships return empty and unladen, or
take the Wines at the Prices other Men gave. That They had chosen
the latter, as well to continue their Trade, as to draw Home some Part
of the Stock They had in that Country. That They could imagine but
two Ways to reform that Excess: The one, by putting the Trade into
such a Method and under such Rules, as might restrain that License,
and not leave it in the Power of Persons who never had been in the Trade
to give the Law to it; and by this Means the Islanders would find it neces∣sary
to set reasonable Prices upon their Commodities, and to yield such
other Advantages and Privileges to the Merchants as They had heretofore
<MILESTONE N="20"/>enjoyed. The other, that the King would by his Proclamation prohibit
the Importation of any <HI>Canary</HI> Wines into his Dominions: And hereby
He would quickly receive such Propositions from <HI>Spain,</HI> as would put it
into his own Power to make the Reformation; otherwise the Islanders had
been persuaded that <HI>England</HI> could not live without their Wines.”</P>
<P>THE Lords were resolved, notwithstanding all that had been said, that
They would execute the former Proclamation, and reduce the Prices of
Wines to what had been then determined: And after They had given a
full Account of the whole Business to the King in Council, the Resolution
was approved, and a Proclamation was issued out to that Purpose. The
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Merchants and Vintners applied themselves to his Majesty, and to many of
the Lords of the Council, and thought They had Encouragement enough to
hope for a Relief in an Appeal to the King and Council by Petition; and
They had thereupon a Day assigned to be heard. Many of the Lords thought
it very hard, if not unjust, to compel Men to sell cheaper than They bought,
which was the Truth of the Case, and which must oblige both Merchants
and Vintners to sophisticate and corrupt their Wines to preserve their Estates;
which might probably turn to the great Damage of the whole Kingdom,
in producing Sickness and Diseases: And this charitable and generous Con∣sideration
prevailed with the major Part of the Lords to be well contented,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and to wish that some Indulgence might be exercised towards them. On
the contrary, when the King had well weighed the whole Proceedings, and
with Trouble and Indignation considered the obstinate Vice of the Nation,
which made it ridiculous to all the World, He expressed a positive Resolu∣tion
to vindicate himself and his Government from this Reproach. He
thought the adhering firmly to the Prices which had been resolved upon by
the Lords would be the best Preface to this Reformation, though it might be
attended with particular Damage to particular Persons, who had yet less
Cause to complain, because their own Advice had been followed. And
thereupon his Majesty declared, “that He would make no Alteration;” but
<MILESTONE N="50"/>withal told them, “that if They could make any Proposition to him for
the better Regulation of the Trade” (for They had themselves mentioned
a Charter), “He would graciously receive any Propositions They would
make, and gratify them in what was just:” And so, notwithstanding all
<PB N="258" REF="263"/>
Attempts which were often repeated, the Price set by the Lords was ratified
for the Year following.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The principal</HI> Canary <HI>Mer∣chants petition for a Charter.</HI></NOTE> many of the Merchants who had always traded to the <HI>Ca∣naries</HI>
did petition the King, “that They might be incorporated; and that
none might be permitted to trade thither but such who would be of that
Corporation, and observe the Constitutions which should be made by
them:” Which Petition was presented to the King at the Council-Board;
and being read, his Majesty (according to his Custom in Matters of Diffi∣culty
and publick Concernment) directed it to be read again on that Day
Month, at which Time his Majesty presumed that all who would oppose it<MILESTONE N="10"/>
would present their Reasons and Objections against it, which He desired to
hear. At the Day appointed, though there was no Petition against it, yet
it was observed that there were many of the most eminent Merchants of that
Trade, whose Names were not to the Petition, nor who otherwise appeared
desirous to have a Charter granted: Which his Majesty considering, He put
off the Debate for another Week, and directed “that the other Merchants
by Name should be desired to be present, and to give their Advice freely
upon the Point.”</P>
<P>AND there was at that Day a very full Appearance; when his Majesty
directed, “that a Relation should be made to them of the whole Progress<MILESTONE N="20"/>
that had been in the Business, and the Damage and Dishonour the Na∣tion
underwent in the carrying on that Trade: That many Merchants had
presented a Petition to him, containing an Expedient to bring it into
better Order; but finding them not to appear in it, and being informed
that They were best acquainted with and most engaged in that Trade,
He had sent for them to know their Opinion, whether They thought what
was proposed to be reasonable and fit to be granted, and if so, why They
did not concern themselves in it.” They answered, “that the Reason
why They had not appeared in it was, because They thought They
should be Losers by it, and therefore were not solicitous to procure a<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Grant from his Majesty to their own Damage;” and so enlarged “upon
the Nature of the Trade, their long Experience in it, and the Greatness
of their Stock, which They should not be allowed to continue under any
Regulation. But as They did not think themselves in a Situation to be
solicitous for a Change, so They could not deny, being required by his
Majesty to speak the Truth, but that the Proposition that was made was
for the publick Good and Benefit of the Kingdom, and that They con∣ceived
no other Way to redeem that Trade, and the Nation from the In∣solence
which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> exercised upon them;” implying, “that if
his Majesty would command them, They would likewise concur and join<MILESTONE N="40"/>
in the carrying on the Service:” To which his Majesty giving them gra∣cious
Encouragement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ap∣proves the Pe∣tition.</NOTE> They all seemed to depart of one Mind; and his
Majesty remained confirmed in the former Opinion He had of it.</P>
<P>BUT there remained yet an Objection, which was principally insisted on
by the Ministers of the Revenue, who alleged very reasonably, “that this
new-modelling the Trade must produce some Alteration, and would meet
some Opposition from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which for the Time would lessen the
Customs and entitle the Farmers to a Defalcation.” The Petition was there∣fore
referred to the Farmers of the Customs, who were to attend the next
Council-Day: And being then called, They did acknowledge, “that the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Design proposed would prove very profitable to the Kingdom in many
Respects,” upon which They enlarged, “and that in the End it would
not be attended with any Diminutions of the Customs; but for the present,”
<PB N="259" REF="264"/>
They said, “They could not but expect, that the Obstinacy and Con∣tradiction
of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would give such a Stop to Trade, at least for
one Year, that if his Majesty did not reimburse them for what should fall
short in the Receipt of Custom, They must look to be very great Losers.”
The Merchants on the other Hand offered “to be bound, that if They
did not the first Year bring in as much as had been usually entered, They
would make good what should be wanting to the Farmers upon a Me∣dium.”
Whereupon his Majesty himself declared, “that He would not,
for a small Damage to himself, hinder the Kingdom from enjoying so great
<MILESTONE N="10"/>a Benefit:” And He commanded his Solicitor General, who then attended
the Board, “to prepare such a Charter as might provide for all those good
Ends which were desired in the Petition,” and which had been so largely
debated; and it was notorious, that there had never been a greater Con∣currence
of the Board in any Direction.</P>
<P>MANY Months passed before the Charter was prepared; in which Time
there was never the least new Objection made against it, nor was it known
that any Man was unsatisfied with it. After it was engrossed and had
passed the King's Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> London <HI>op∣poses it.</HI></NOTE> it was brought to the Great Seal; and there the Lord
Mayor of <HI>London</HI> and the Court of Aldermen had entered a Caveat to stop
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the passing of it. The Chancellor, according to Course, appointed a Time
when He would hear all Parties. The City alleged an Order made a Year
or two before by the King in Council, upon a Complaint then exhibited by
the Court of Aldermen against the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company and other Corpora∣tions,
“in which” They said “there were very many Merchants of the
best Trade and of the greatest Estates in the City, who would never
take out their Freedom, and so refused to bear any Charge or Office
in it, to the very great Prejudice and Dishonour of the City and of
the Government thereof; since They were thereby compelled to call in∣feriour
Citizens to be Aldermen, before They had Estates to bear the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Charge of it, whilst the gravest and the richest Men, who were most
fit, could not be obliged to accept of it, because They were not Free∣men.”
The Persons concerned, which were indeed a great Number of
very valuable and substantial Men and of great Estates, answered, “that They
had traded very many Years without finding any Reason to take out their
Freedom, which They might do or not do as They thought best for them∣selves;
that They had always paid Scot and Lot in the several Parishes
where They lived with the highest of the Inhabitants, and were taxed the
more because They had not taken out their Freedom, They who taxed
them being always Freemen; that They were grown old now, and had
<MILESTONE N="40"/>no Mind to become young Freemen, but would rather give over their
Trade, and retire into the Country where They had Estates.”</P>
<P>BESIDES the Rules which the King gave upon the Difference then in
Question, He was pleased to declare, and appointed it to be entered as an
Order in the Council-Book, “that Care should be taken, that in all Char∣ters
which He should hereafter renew or grant to any Companies or
Corporations in the City of <HI>London,</HI> They should first make themselves
Freemen of the City; by which They might be liable to the Charges of
it, as other Citizens are.” They said, “that there were many of this
Company that was now to be incorporated who were not Freemen:” And
<MILESTONE N="50"/>therefore the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen desired the Benefit of the
King's Order, which was read.</P>
<P>THE Merchants confessed, “that many of them were not Freemen, and
resolved not to be:” They said, “They had never heard of this Order, and
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
were sorry that They had spent so much Money to no Purpose.” The
Chancellor declared to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor refuses to put the Seal till the Merchants had satisfied the City.</NOTE> “that He could not seal their Charter till
They had complied with the King's Determination, and given the Court
of Aldermen Satisfaction;” and They all seemed as positive that They
would rather be without their Charter, than They would submit to the other
Inconveniences: And so They departed. But after some Days Deliberation
and Consultation between themselves, and when They found that there was
no Possibility to procure a Dispensation from that Order, They treated with
the City, and agreed with them in the preparing a Clause to be inserted in
their Charter, by which They were obliged in so many Years to become<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Freemen; which Clause, being approved by all Parties, was in the King's Pre∣sence
entered in the Bill that his Majesty had signed, and being afterwards
added to the Engrossment, it was again thus reformed and sent to the Great
Seal, and presented to the Chancellor to be sealed.</P>
<P>THERE were by this Time several new Caveats entered against it at the
Seal; all which the Chancellor heard, and settled every one of them to the
joint Satisfaction of all Parties, and all Caveats were withdrawn. There
was then a Rumour, that there would be some Motions made against it in
the House of Commons: And some Parliament-Men, who served for the
Western Boroughs, came to the Chancellor, and desired him “that He<MILESTONE N="20"/>
would defer the sealing it for some Days till They might be heard, since
it would undo their Western Trade; and” They said “They resolved to
move the House of Commons to put a Stop to it.” The Chancellor in∣formed
them of the whole Progress it had passed, and told them, “He be∣lieved
that They would hardly be able to offer any good Reasons against
it:” However, since it was then well known that the Parliament would
be prorogued within ten or twelve Days, He said “He would suspend the
sealing it till then, to the End that They might offer any Objections against
it there or any where else.” But though the Parliament sate longer than
it was then conceived it would have done, there was no Mention or Notice<MILESTONE N="30"/>
taken of it: And after the Prorogation no Application was farther made for
the stopping it, and the Merchants pressed very importunately that it might
be sealed, alleging with Reason “that the deferring it so long had been very
much to their Prejudice.” Whereupon the Chancellor conceived that it
would not consist with his Duty to delay it longer, and so affixed the Great
Seal to it.</P>
<P>THE Company then chose a Governour and other Officers according to
their Charter, and made such Orders and By-Laws as They thought fit for
the carrying on and Advancement of their Trade, which They might alter
when They thought convenient; and for the present They resolved upon a<MILESTONE N="40"/>
joint Stock, and assigned so many Shares to each particular Mart. In this
Composition and Distribution there sell out some Difference between them∣selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Differ∣ences in the Company after their Incorpo∣ration.</NOTE>
which could not be taken Notice of abroad: And even some of
them, who first petitioned and were most solicitous to procure the Charter,
did what They could to hinder the Effect of it; sent privately to their Fac∣tors
at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> “to oppose any Orders that should be sent from the
Governour and the Company, and that They should do all They could
to incense the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against the Charter,” and bade them promise
that all their Wine should be taken off in Spite of the Corporation.”
Whereupon great Disorders did arise in the <HI>Canaries</HI> between the <HI>English</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
themselves; and by the Conjunction of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with those few <HI>En∣glish</HI>
who opposed the Charter, They proceeded so far as to send the prin∣cipal
Factors for the Company out of the Island into <HI>Spain,</HI> and to make
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
a publick Act by the Governour and Council there, “that no Ship belong∣ing
to the Company should be suffered to come into the Harbour, or to
take in any Lading from the Island:” All which was transacted there
many Months before it was known in <HI>England,</HI> and probably would have
been prevented or easily reformed, if it had not pleased God that the
Plague at this Time spread very much in <HI>London,</HI> and if the War with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had not restrained all <HI>English</HI> Ships from going to the <HI>Canaries</HI> for
the Space of a Year; which Intermission, not to be prevented nor in Truth
foreseen, gave some Advantage to the Merchants at Home who opposed their
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Charter, who complained for the Not-Return of their several Stocks within
the Time that the Company had promised they should be returned.</P>
<P>I AM not willing to resume this Discourse in another Place, which I
should be compelled to do if I discontinued the Relation in this Place, as in
Point of Time I should do; but I choose rather to insert here what fell out
afterwards, and to finish the Account of that Affair, that there may be no
Occasion in the Current of this Narration to mention any Particulars that re∣lated
to it.</P>
<P>WHEN the King was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and was informed of what had passed
at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> some Merchants appeared there to petition against the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which are re∣ferred to the King.</NOTE> whereof there were some who were the first Petitioners for it. His
Majesty appointed a Day for the solemn hearing it in the Presence of his
Privy Council, the Governour being likewise summoned and present there.
Upon opening all their Grievances the Petitioners themselves confessed, “that
They could not complain of the Charter; that it was a just and necessary
Charter, and for the great Benefit of the Kingdom, though some private
Men might for the present be Losers by it: That their Complaint was
only against their Constitutions and By-Laws, and the severe Prose∣cution
thereupon contrary to the Intention of the Charter itself;” in∣stancing,
amongst other Things, “the very short Day limited by the Char∣ter,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>after which They could not continue their Trade without being Mem∣bers
of the Corporation; and that Day was so soon after the sealing the
Charter, that it was not possible for them to draw their Stocks from thence
in so short a Time.”</P>
<P>WHEN They had finished all their Objections, the King observed to them,
“that They complained only of what themselves had done, and not at all of
the Charter, which gave them only Authority to choose a Governour and to
make Constitutions and By-Laws, but directed not what the Constitutions
and By-Laws should be, which were the Result of their own Consultations,
in which the major Part must have concurred; and of that Kind the Reso∣lution
<MILESTONE N="40"/>for a joint Stock was one, which and all the rest They might alter
again at the next Court, if the major Part were grieved with it.” But
because They had complained of some Particulars, in which They might
have Reason on their Side, his Majesty expressed a Willingness to mediate
and to make an Agreement between them: And thereupon He required
the Governour to answer such and such Particulars which seemed to have
most of Justice; but the Governour answered all at large, and made it
clearly appear, that They had in Truth no Cause of Complaint. As to the
short Day that was assigned for the drawing away of their Stocks, which
had the greatest Semblance of Reason in all They complained of, He said,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>“They had no Reason to mention their Want of Warning, for that the
Day was well enough known to them long before the sealing the
Charter, and might very well have been complied with” (the Reasons
why the sealing the Charter was so long deferred are set down before),
<PB N="262" REF="267"/>
“and could be no Reason to them to neglect the giving Direction in their
own Concernments; but that They knew likewise, that the Day was en∣larged
to a Day desired by themselves, that there might be no Pretence
for Discontent:” And thereupon the Order of the Court to that Purpose
was read to his Majesty, and They could not deny it to be true.</P>
<P>IN Conclusion, since it did appear that their Stock did in Truth still re∣main
in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and in Justice belonged to them, whether it was
their Fault or their Misfortune that it had not been drawn over in Time;
the King persuaded the Governour and his Assistants to give them such
Satisfaction in that and other Particulars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who satisfies all Parties.</NOTE> that before They retired from<MILESTONE N="10"/>
his Majesty's Presence They were unanimously agreed upon all their Pre∣tences:
And though some of the Lords, upon some Insinuations and Dis∣courses
which They had heard, had believed the Company to have been in
the Wrong, They were now fully convinced of the contrary, and believed
the Charter to be founded upon great Reason of State, and that the Execu∣tion
of it had been very justifiable and with great Moderation. And it is to
be observed, that the Parliament being then assembled at <HI>Oxford,</HI> there was
not the least Complaint against that Charter or Corporation.</P>
<P>AND this was the whole Progress of that Affair, until it served some Mens
Turns to make it afterwards Matter of Reproach to the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vindication of the Chan∣cellor in this Affair.</NOTE> in a<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Time when He had too great a Weight of the King's Displeasure upon him
to defend himself from that and other Calumnies, which few Men thought
him guilty of. And if the Motives of State were not of Weight enough to
support the Patent, more ought not to be objected to him than to every
other Counsellor, there having never been a more unanimous Concurrence
at that Board in any Advice They have given: And the Delays He used in
the passing the Charter after it came to his Hand, his giving so long Time
for the making Objections against it, and his so positively opposing the
Company with Reference to their being Freemen of the City, are no Signs
that He had such a Mind to please them, as a Man would have who had<MILESTONE N="30"/>
been corrupted by them, or who was to have a Share in the Profit of the
Patent, as was afterwards suggested, but never believed by any to whom He
was in any Degree known, who knew well that He frequently refused to re∣ceive
Money that He might very lawfully have done, and never took a
Penny which He was obliged to refuse. He was indeed, as often as that
Affair came to be debated, very clear in his Judgment for the King's grant∣ing
it, and always continued of the same Opinion: Nor did He ever deny,
that some Months after the Patent was sealed the Governour made him a
Present in the Name of the Corporation, as it is presumed He did to many
other Officers through whose Hands it passed, and which was never refused<MILESTONE N="40"/>
by any of his Predecessors when it came from a Community upon the pass∣ing
a Charter; which He never concealed from the King, who thought He
might well do it. In the last Place it is to be remembered, that after all
the Clamour against this Charter in Parliament, and upon the arguing against
the Legality of it by eminent Lawyers before the House of Peers, it was so
well supported by the King's Attorney General and other learned Lawyers,
that the Lords would not give Judgment against it: But the Governour and
the Corporation durst not dispute it farther with the House of Commons,
but chose to surrender their Charter into the King's Hands.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> had their Ambassadour, <HI>Monsieur Comminge,</HI> remaining still<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in <HI>England,</HI> who pretended to be ready to finish still the Treaty of Com∣merce,
but formalized so much upon every Article, though Nothing was de∣manded
but what had been granted to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that it was concluded
<PB N="263" REF="268"/>
that He wanted Power, though Somewhat was imputed to the Capricious∣ness
of his Nature, which made him hard to treat with, and not always
vacant at the Hours himself assigned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>send Ambassa∣dours into</HI> England <HI>un∣der Pretence of Mediation.</HI></NOTE> being hypochondriack and seldom sleep∣ing
without Opium. As soon as the War was declared the King of <HI>France</HI>
sent two other Ambassadours, whereof, for the Countenance and Splendour
of it, the Duke of <HI>Vernueil</HI> was one, who being Uncle to Both the Kings
was received rather under that Relation than in the other Capacity, and
was lodged and treated by the King during the whole Time of his Stay.
With him came likewise <HI>Monsieur Courtine,</HI> a Master of Requests, and much
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the quickest Man of the three, and upon whose Parts and Address most of
the Business depended. The former Ambassadour was joined in Commis∣sion
with the other two: And their declared Business was to mediate a Peace
between the King and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> when there had been yet little Harm
done, only great Preparations made on Both Sides for the War; which They
did not seem very solicitous to interrupt, but contented themselves with de∣claring
at their first Audience, “that the King their Master out of Chris∣tianity,
and to prevent the Effusion of Christian Blood, desired to mediate
a Peace, which the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> were very willing He
should do, and professed to have a very great Desire of Peace; which
<MILESTONE N="20"/>made his <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty hope that He should find the same good In∣clinations
here, and if He might be informed what his Majesty did require
or what would be grateful to him, He did not doubt but that He should
persuade the <HI>States</HI> to submit to it.”</P>
<P>AND with this general Discourse, and without delivering any Memorial in
Writing, the Ambassadours acquiesced for many Months, as if their Busi∣siness
was only that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour, who remained still in <HI>London,</HI>
might know and send Word to his Masters that They had begun their Me∣diation.
Otherwise They seemed in all their Discourses to make some Kind
of Apology for being sent, implying “as if the extraordinary Importunity
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of the <HI>Dutch</HI> had prevailed with the King to undertake this Mediation,
and which He did the rather, upon their Promise that They would yield
to any Thing He should advise them; and He was very far from desiring
that his Majesty might not receive ample Satisfaction in whatsoever He re∣quired:”
So that the King did not imagine, whatever Information He had
received before, and whatever Jealousy He had entertained, that this Embassy
would be concluded in the Denunciation of a War against him. Nor is it
probable that the Ambassadours themselves at that Time knew that They
were to perform that Office, though it was afterwards evident that the
Matter had been long before resolved in <HI>France.</HI> They lived between the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>two Courts, for the Queen Mother was likewise at that Time at her Palace
of <HI>Somerset-House,</HI> in much Jollity, and as vacant from any Affairs till
They might receive new Orders from Court, but spending much Time with
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour, whom They persuaded “that They were very in∣tent
upon and had much advanced the Treaty,” as appeared by the Am∣bassadour's
Letters to the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>THE Plague increased so fast,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother leaves</HI> England.</NOTE> that the Queen Mother, who had all the
Winter complained of her Indisposition of Health, and declared that She
would in the Summer go again into <HI>France,</HI> took that Occasion, albeit She
was recovered to a very good State; and about the End of <HI>July</HI> removed
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and embarked for <HI>France,</HI> and took so many Things with her, that it was
thought by many that She did not intend ever to return into <HI>England.</HI>
Whatever her Intentions at that Time were, She never did see <HI>England</HI>
again, though She lived many Years after.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="269"/>
IT was in <HI>April</HI> that the Duke went to Sea:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke con∣tinually sends for Reinforce∣ments.</NOTE> And from the Day of his
going thither with the Fleet Letters and Orders came from him to the Day
of the Battle for an Addition of more Ships, upon Intelligence of an Increase
of Strength added to the Enemy, though They yet lay still in the Harbours,
whilst the Duke was upon their Coasts. But Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> still made new
Demands, and wrote to the Chancellor, “that whilst the King's Brother
was at Sea and ventured his own Person, Nobody who wished him well
would, for saving Money, hinder any Thing from being sent that his
Highness thought necessary for his Defence:” And all Things were sent,
though procured with wonderful Difficulty.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Treasurer had believed, when all the Provisions were delivered which
had been demanded, and all Computations satisfied which had been made,
and the Fleet at Sea, that there would have been no more Expense till its
Return; whereas every Day added new Expense which had not been
thought of: And the requiring of more Ships was then believed, and more
afterwards, to proceed from the restless Spirit of Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who cared
not how much He increased the Expense, and was willing to put the Trea∣surer
and all the King's Ministers to contend with all Difficulties, that
He might reproach their Laziness or Want of Ability. But They did
not gratify him in that, but all the Ships and whatever else was sent for were<MILESTONE N="20"/>
sent; insomuch as the Fleet amounted to no less than one hundred Sail, and
was now retired for Want of Somewhat to do to our own Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He retires to the</HI> English <HI>Coast.</HI></NOTE> where They
resolved to attend the Motion of the Enemy: And in this Time most of the
Volunteers, having endured the Unpleasantness of the Sea above a Month,
begun to think that the War was not so necessary as They had thought
it to be.</P>
<P>THE Duke's Family that was numerous in his own Ship were not at
Ease, and found less Respect from the Seamen than They had looked for:
They grew into Factions between themselves, and the Earl of <HI>Falmouth</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> were Rivals who should have most Interest in the Duke, who<MILESTONE N="30"/>
loved the Earl best but thought the other the wiser Man, who supported
<HI>Pen</HI> (who disobliged all the Courtiers) even against the Earl, who contemned
<HI>Pen</HI> as a Fellow of no Sense, and not worthy of the Charge and Trust that
was reposed in him. In this Discomposure and having Nothing to do,
every Body grew angry at the Occasion that brought them thither, and
wished for Peace.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> as in a Time of Leisure, was sent by the Duke
with Compliments to the King, and to give him an Account of the good
State of the Fleet: He visited the Chancellor, to whom He had always
paid great Respect and made many Professions; and He told him, “that<MILESTONE N="40"/>
They were all mad who had wished this War, and that himself had been
made a Fool to contribute to it, but that his Eyes were open, and a
Month's Experience at Sea had enough informed him of the great Hazards
the King ran in it.” He reproached <HI>Pen</HI> “as a Sot, and a Fellow that
He thought would be found without Courage.” He told him, “that the
King and the Duke too were Both inclined to Peace, and discerned that
the Charge and Expense of the War would be insupportable;” and con∣cluded,
“that as soon as this Action should be over, which could not be
avoided many Days if the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet put to Sea, as it could not be
doubted it would, it would be good Time to make a Peace, which He<MILESTONE N="50"/>
desired him to think of, and to speak with the King, whom He would
find disposed to it:” And so He returned to the Fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="270"/>
AND by that Time the <HI>Dutch</HI> were come out,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet puts out to Sea under</HI> Opdam.</NOTE> and the next Day were in
View. They were near of equal Number, and well manned, under the
Command of <HI>Opdam</HI> the Admiral of the whole Fleet, upon whom the
<HI>States</HI> had conferred that Charge, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his Party might
conclude, that They never intended that He should have the Charges of his
Father and Grandfather, and likewise to gratify the Nobility of <HI>Holland,</HI>
that had a very small Share in the Government. And this Gentleman, who
had never been at Sea before, and had but a small Fortune, was of that
Number, and had joined with that Faction which was averse from the Family
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of <HI>Orange.</HI> The Fleets came within Sight of each other on the first of
<HI>June,</HI> and had some Skirmishes which continued on the second, the Wind
favouring neither Party, as willing to keep them asunder: But upon the
third it served Both their Turns, and brought them as near each other as
They could desire to be.</P>
<P>NOR did the <HI>Dutch</HI> seem to advance with less Courage and Resolution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first gene∣ral Engage∣ment.</NOTE>
<HI>Opdam</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral with his Squadron bore directly upon the Duke
with a Resolution to board him: But before He came near enough, and
very little before, whether by an Accident within his own Ship, or from a
Grenado or other Shot out of the Duke's Ship, his Gun-Room took Fire,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and in a Moment the Ship sunk without any Man being saved. The Vice-Admiral
of the same Squadron, being a <HI>Zealander,</HI> pursued the same Resolu∣tion,
and had boarded the Duke if Captain <HI>Jeremy Smith,</HI> a Captain of the
Duke's Squadron, had not put himself between and boarded the Vice-Ad∣miral,
who was equally attacked by the Duke: And so that Ship was taken
after most of the Men were killed; and the Captain himself was so wounded,
that He only lived to be brought on Board the Duke's Ship, and to com∣plain
of his Companions “for not having seconded him according to an
Oath They had taken on Board their Admiral the Day before,” and died
within Half an Hour to the great Trouble of the Duke, who gave him
<MILESTONE N="30"/>a great Testimony for a very gallant Man, and much desired to pre∣serve
him.</P>
<P>THE Fight continued all the Day with very great Loss of Men on all
Sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> though after the first two Hours the <HI>Dutch,</HI> seeing many of their
best Ships burned and more taken, did all that the Wind would give them
Leave to separate themselves from the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, which pursued them so
close, that They found They lost more by flying than by fighting, and did
lessen their Sails to give some Stop to the Pursuit till the Night might favour
them: And the Evening no sooner came, but They hoised up all their Sails,
and intended Nothing but their Escape.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>WHEN there was no more to be done by the Approach of the Night, the
Duke, who was infinitely tired with the Labour of the Day, having lost
above two hundred Men aboard his own Ship, whereof some were Persons of
Quality, who stood next his own Person and shall be named anon, was
prevailed with to repose himself after He had taken some Sustenance; which
He did, after He had given the Master of the Ship, an honest and a skilful
Seaman, direct and positive Charge “to bear up in that Manner upon the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that He might lose no Ground, but find himself as near,
when the Day should appear, as He was then when He went to Sleep.”
The Fleet had no Guide but the Lanthorn of the Admiral, and were not to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>outsail him of Course, and behaved themselves accordingly. But when the
Duke arose and the Day appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Remain∣der of their Fleet escapes by Night.</NOTE> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was out of View; and
before He could reach them, They were got into their Ports or under the
Shelter of their Flats, that it was not counsellable for the great Ships to pur∣sue
<PB N="266" REF="271"/>
them farther: Yet some of those Ships which made not so much Way,
or had not steered so directly, were taken by the lesser Ships that followed
them. And the Duke had received so many Blows on his own and the
other Ships, that it was necessary to retire into Port, where they might be
repaired.</P>
<P>IT was a Day of signal Triumph,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The great Loss of the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> the Action of it having much surpassed
all that was done in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, whose Navals were much greater than
had ever been in any Age: But the <HI>Dutch</HI> had never then fought with so
much Courage and Resolution; nor were their Ships then in Strength to be
compared to the <HI>English,</HI> as <HI>Van Trump</HI> assured them, “and that except<MILESTONE N="10"/>
They built better Ships They would be as often beaten as They fought
with the <HI>English.</HI>” And from that Time They new-built all their Navy,
and brought now with them as good Ships as any the King had: And the
Men for some Hours behaved themselves well. In that Day the Duke sunk,
burned, and took eighteen good Ships of War, whereof Half were of the
best They had, with the Loss of one single small Ship, for there was no
more missing of his whole Fleet. It is true the Number of the killed and
wounded Men was very great, and was thought the greater, because in the
great Massacre that was on the other Side there was no Man, except <HI>Opdam</HI>
their Admiral, who had a Name. There were many excellent Officers<MILESTONE N="20"/>
killed and taken, Men of Courage and of great Experience in naval Affairs,
and therefore an irreparable Damage to them; but They had grown up
from common Seamen, and so were of no other Quality than every Mari∣ner
of the Fleet.</P>
<P>ON the Part of the <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Persons slain on the Side of the</HI> English. <HI>The Earl of</HI> Falmouth. <HI>Lord</HI> Mus∣kerry.</NOTE> besides above two hundred Men that were
killed on Board the Duke's own Ship, there fell the Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI>
who hath been lately spoken of, and the Lord <HI>Muskerry,</HI> eldest Son to
the Earl of <HI>Clancarty,</HI> a young Man of extraordinary Courage and Expecta∣tion,
who had been Colonel of a Regiment of Foot in <HI>Flanders</HI> under the
Duke, and had the general Estimation of an excellent Officer: He was<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of the Duke's Bedchamber, and the Earl and He were at that Time so near
the Duke, that his Highness was all covered with their Blood. There fell
likewise in the same Ship Mr. <HI>Richard Boyle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Richard Boyle.</NOTE> a younger Son of the Earl of
<HI>Burlington,</HI> a Youth of great Hope, who came newly Home from Travel,
where He had spent his Time with singular Advantage, and took the first
Opportunity to lose his Life in the King's Service. There were many other
Gentlemen Volunteers in the same Ship, who had the same Fate.</P>
<P>IN Prince <HI>Rupert's</HI> Ship, who did Wonders that Day, and in that of the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who behaved him with notable Courage and Conduct,
there were very many Men slain, and some Gentlemen Volunteers of the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
best Families whose Memories should be preserved. The Earl of <HI>Marlbo∣rough,</HI>
who had the Command of one of the best Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Marlborough.</NOTE> and had great Ex∣perience
at Sea, having made many long Voyages at Sea, and being now
newly returned from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> whither the King had sent him with
a Squadron of Ships to receive the Island of <HI>Bombayne</HI> from <HI>Portugal,</HI> was
in this Battle likewise slain. He was a Man of wonderful Parts in all Kinds
of Learning, which He took more Delight in than his Title; and having no
great Estate descended to him, He brought down his Mind to his Fortune,
and lived very retired, but with more Reputation than any Fortune could
have given him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Portland.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> was a Volunteer on Board his Ship,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and lost his Life by his Side, being a young Man of very good Parts, newly
come of Age, and the Son of a very wise and worthy Father, who died few
Months before: And He having a long and entire Friendship with the Earl
<PB N="267" REF="272"/>
of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> his Son, though of a melancholick Nature, intended to
lead an active Life, and to apply himself to it under the Conduct of his
Father's Friend, with whom He died very bravely.</P>
<P>THERE was another almost irreparable Loss this Day in Sir <HI>John Lawson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Sir</HI> John Lawson.</NOTE>
who was Admiral of a Squadron, and of so eminent Skill and Conduct in
all maritime Occasions, that his Counsel was most considered in all Debates,
and the greatest Seamen were ready to receive Advice from him. In the
Middle of the Battle He received a Shot with a Musket-Bullet upon the
Knee, with which He fell: And finding that He could no more stand
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and was in great Torment, He sent to the Duke to desire him to send ano∣ther
Man to command his Ship; which He presently did. The Wound was
not conceived to be mortal; and They made Haste to send him on Shore,
as far as <HI>Deptford</HI> or <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where for some Days there was Hope of
his Recovery; but shortly his Wound gangrened, and so He died with
very great Courage, and Profession of an entire Duty and Fidelity to
the King.</P>
<P>HE was indeed of all the Men of that Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> and of that Extraction and
Education, incomparably the modestest and the wisest Man, and most worthy
to be confided in. He was of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> of that Rank of
<MILESTONE N="20"/>People who are bred to the Sea from their Cradle. And a young Man of
that Profession He was, when the Parliament first possessed themselves of
the Royal Navy; and <HI>Hull</HI> being in their Hands, all the Northern Seamen
easily betook themselves to their Service: And his Industry and Sobriety
made him quickly taken Notice of, and to be preferred from one Degree to
another, till from a common Sailor He was promoted to be a Captain of a
small Vessel, and from thence to the Command of the best Ships.</P>
<P>HE had been in all the Actions performed by <HI>Blake,</HI> some of which were
very stupendous, and in all the Battles which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had fought with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> in which He was a signal Officer and very much valued by him.
<MILESTONE N="30"/>He was of that <HI>Classis</HI> of Religion which were called <HI>Independents,</HI> most of
which were <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> who were generally believed to have most Aversion
to the King, and therefore employed in most Offices of Trust. He was
Commander in Chief of the Fleet when <HI>Richard</HI> was thrown out: And
when the Contest grew between the <HI>Rump</HI> and <HI>Lambert,</HI> He brought the
whole Fleet into the River, and declared for that which was called the Par∣liament;
which brake the Neck of all other Designs, though He intended
only the better Settlement of the <HI>Commonwealth.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Council of State</HI> was settled between the Dissolution of the
<HI>Rump</HI> and the calling the Parliament, They did not like the Temper of the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Fleet, nor especially of <HI>Lawson,</HI> who under the Title of Vice-Admiral had
the whole Command of the Fleet, which was very strong, and in which
there were many Captains They liked well: Yet They durst not remove
the Vice-Admiral, left his Interest in the Seamen, which was very great,
should give them new Trouble. The Expedient They resolved upon was
to send Colonel <HI>Mountague</HI> as Admiral to command the Fleet, without re∣moving
<HI>Lawson,</HI> who continued still in his Command, and could not refuse
to be commanded by <HI>Mountague,</HI> who had always been his superiour Of∣ficer,
and who had likewise a great Interest in very many of the Officers
and Seamen. Yet <HI>Mountague,</HI> who brought with him a firm Resolution to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>serve the King, which was well known to his Majesty, had no Confidence
in <HI>Lawson</HI> till the Parliament had proclaimed the King: And when He
brought the Fleet to <HI>Scheveling</HI> to receive the King, all Men looked upon
the Vice-Admiral as a great <HI>Anabaptist</HI> and not fit to be trusted. But when
<PB N="268" REF="273"/>
the King and the Duke had conferred with him, They liked him very well:
And He was from Time to Time in the Command of Vice-Admiral in all
the Fleets which were sent into the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> Nor did any Man per∣form
his Duty better: He caused all Persons, how well qualified soever, who
He knew were affected to a Republick, to be dismissed from the Service,
and brought very good Order into his own Ship, and frequented the Church-Prayers
himself, and made all the Seamen do so. He was very remarkable
in his Affection and Countenance towards all those who had faithfully served
the King, and never commended any Body to the Duke to be preferred but
such; and performed to his Death all that could be expected from a brave<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and an honest Man.</P>
<P>IT looked like some Presage that He had of his own Death, that be∣fore
He went to Sea He came to the Treasurer and the Chancellor, to
whom He had always borne much Respect, and spake to them in a Dia∣lect
He had never before used, for He was a very generous Man, and
lived in his House decently and plentifully, and had never made any the
least Suit or Pretence for Money. Now He told them, “that He was going
upon an Expedition in which many honest Men must lose their Lives:
And though He had no Apprehension of himself, but that God would
protect him as He had often done in the same Occasions, yet He<MILESTONE N="20"/>
thought it became him against the Worst to make his Condition known
to them, and the rather, because He knew He was esteemed generally to
be rich.” He said, “in Truth He thought himself so some few Months
since, when He was worth eight or nine thousand Pounds: But the Marriage
of his Daughter to a young Gentleman in Quality and Fortune much
above him (Mr. <HI>Richard Norton</HI> of <HI>Southwick</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> who had
fallen in Love with her, and his Father out of Tenderness to his Son had
consented to it) had obliged him to give her such a Portion as might
in some Degree make her worthy of so great a Fortune; and that He
had not reserved so much to himself and Wife, and all his other Chil∣dren<MILESTONE N="30"/>
which were four or five, as He had given to that Daughter.” He
desired them therefore, “that if He should miscarry in this Enterprise, the
King would give his Wife two hundred Pounds a Year for her Life; if
He lived He desired Nothing, He hoped He should make some Provision
for them by his own Industry: Nor did He desire any other Grant or Se∣curity
for this two hundred Pounds yearly, than the King's Word and
Promise, and that They would see it effectual.” The Suit was so mo∣dest,
and the Ground of making it so just and reasonable, that They wil∣lingly
informed his Majesty of it, who as graciously granted it, and spake
himself to him of it with very obliging Circumstances; so that the poor<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Man went very contentedly to his Work, and perished as gallantly in it
with an universal Lamentation. And it is to be presumed that the Promise
was as well peformed to his Wife: Sure it is, it was exactly complied with
whilst either of those two Persons had any Power.</P>
<P>THE Victory and Triumph of that Day was surely very great, and a just
Argument of publick Joy: How it came to be no greater shall be said anon.
And the Trouble and Grief in many noble Families, for the Loss of so many
worthy and gallant Persons, could not but be very lamentable in Wives,
in Fathers and Mothers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King greatly trou∣bled at the Death of the Earl of</HI> Fal∣mouth.</NOTE> and the other nearest Relations: But no Sorrow was
equal, at least none so remarkable, as the King's was for the Earl of <HI>Falmouth.</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
They who knew his Majesty best, and had seen how unshaken He had
stood in other very terrible Assaults, were amazed at the Flood of Tears He
shed upon this Occasion. The Immenseness of the Victory, and the Con∣sequences
<PB N="269" REF="274"/>
that might have attended it; the Safety and Preservation of his Bro∣ther
with so much Glory, on whose Behalf He had had so terrible Apprehen∣sions
during the three Days Fight, having by the Benefit of the Wind heard the
Thunder of the Ordnance from the Beginning, even after by the lessening of
the Noise as from a greater Distance He concluded that the Enemy was
upon Flight: Yet all this, and the universal Joy that He saw in the Coun∣tenance
of all Men for the Victory and the Safety of the Duke, made no
Impression in him towards the Mitigation of his Passion for the Loss of this
young Favourite, in whom few other Men had ever observed any Virtue or
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Quality which They did not wish their best Friends without; and very
many did believe that his Death was a great Ingredient and considerable
Part of the Victory. He was young and of insatiable Ambition; and a lit∣tle
more Experience might have taught him all Things which his weak Parts
were capable of. But They who observed the strange Degree of Favour He
had on the sudden arrived to, even from a Detestation the King had towards
him, and concluded from thence, and more from the deep Sorrow the King
was possessed with for his Death, to what a prodigious Height He might
have reached in a little Time more, were not at all troubled that He was
taken out of the Way.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE Duke, after He had given Directions for the speedy repairing of the
Fleet, and for the present sending out such Ships as could quickly be made
ready to ride before the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> made Haste to present himself to
the King, and to the Queen his Mother, who was ready to begin her Journey
to <HI>France,</HI> and had stayed some Days to see the Success of the naval Fight,
and afterwards to see the Duke; and within few Days after his Arrival her
Majesty left the Kingdom.</P>
<P>AND now the Whisper began in the Duke's Family of the Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reason why the Vic∣tory was no farther im∣proved.</NOTE> why
the Victory after so great Advantages had not been pursued with that Vigour
that might have made it more destructive to the Enemy than it proved to be.
<MILESTONE N="30"/>The Master of the Duke's Ship (Captain—) pursued his Orders very
punctually after the Duke was gone to Sleep, and kept within a just Di∣stance
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that remained in Order together, for many fled in
Confusion and singly to that Part of the Coast that They thought They knew
best; and many of them were taken. But the Duke was no sooner in Sleep,
but Mr. <HI>Brounker</HI> of his Bedchamber, who with wonderful Confusion had
sustained the Terrour of the Day, resolved to prevent the like on the Day
succeeding. He first went to Sir <HI>William Pen,</HI> who commanded the Ship,
and told him, “that He knew well how miraculously the Duke was pre∣served
that Day, and that They ought not farther to tempt God;” wished
<MILESTONE N="40"/>him to remember, “that the Duke was not only the King's Brother but the
Heir Apparent of the Crown, and what the Consequence would be if He
should be lost. And therefore it would concern him not to suffer the
Duke's known and notorious Courage to engage him in a new Dan∣ger,
which He would infallibly be exposed to the next Morning, if They
continued to make so much Sail as They did, and to keep so near the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> who fled, but if They were pressed and in Despair would fight as
stoutly as They had done in the Beginning. And therefore He desired and
advised him to give the Master Order to slacken the Sails, that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
might get what Ground They could, to avoid a farther Encounter.” <HI>Pen</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>answered him honestly, and told him, “He durst give no such Orders ex∣cept
He had a Mind to be hanged, for the Duke had himself given posi∣tive
Charge to the contrary.”</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="275"/>
MR. <HI>Brounker,</HI> when He could not prevail there, confidently went to
the Master of the Ship, who was an honest and a stout Man, and carefully
kept the Steerage himself that He might be sure to observe the Order He
had received from his Highness, and told him, “that it was the Duke's
Pleasure that He should slack the Sails without taking Notice of it to
any Man.” Whereupon the Master did as He was commanded, making
no Doubt that a Servant so near the Person of his Highness, and in so
much Favour with him, would not have brought such an Order without
due Authority.</P>
<P>AND by this Means the Remainder of the Fleet escaped, which otherwise<MILESTONE N="10"/>
would probably have been all taken: For it was afterwards known, that there
was such a Confusion amongst the Officers, that Nobody would obey; for
though in Truth the Right of commanding, according to the Course ob∣served
amongst them, after the Death of <HI>Opdam</HI> was in the Vice-Admiral
of <HI>Zealand,</HI> yet, He being likewise killed, the other could not agree. But
young <HI>Trump</HI> the Son of the old famous Admiral, who had behaved him∣self
very bravely all the Day, challenged the Command in the Right of <HI>Hol∣land;</HI>
but <HI>John Evertson</HI> of <HI>Zealand,</HI> Brother to him that was killed, re∣quired
it as his Right: Which begat so great an Animosity as well as Con∣fusion
amongst them, that the Morning, if They had been pursued,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
would in all Probability have proved as dismal to them as the Day before
had done.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke never suspected this, nor did any presume to tell him of
it, which made many Men presume that it was done with Privity of Mr.
<HI>Coventry,</HI> not only for the great Friendship between him and <HI>Brounker,</HI> but
because both <HI>Pen</HI> and the Master were so silent when the Duke was so
much troubled the next Morning: Nor did the Duke come to hear of it
till some Years after, when Mr. <HI>Brounker's</HI> ill Course of Life and his abo∣minable
Nature had rendered him so odious, that it was taken Notice of in
Parliament, and upon Examination found to be true, as is here related;<MILESTONE N="30"/>
upon which He was expelled the House of Commons, whereof He was a
Member, as an infamous Person, though his Friend <HI>Coventry</HI> adhered to
him, and used many indirect Arts to have protected him, and afterwards
procured him to have more Countenance from the King than most Men
thought He deserved, being a Person throughout his whole Life never no∣torious
for any Thing but the highest Degree of Impudence, and stooping
to the most infamous Offices, and playing very well at Chess, which pre∣ferred
him more than the most virtuous Qualities could have done.</P>
<P>WITH this Victory a new vast Charge and Expense (beside the repairing
the hurt Ships, Masts and Rigging, and fitting out new Ships of War, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
buying more Fireships) appeared, that was never foreseen or brought into any
Computation; which was a Provision for sick and wounded Men, which
amounted to so great a Number upon all the Coast, that the Charge
amounted in all Places, notwithstanding the general Charity of the Peo∣ple,
and the Convenience that many Hospitals yielded, to above two thou∣sand
Pounds the Week for some Weeks, and though less afterwards by the
Death and Recovery of many, yet continued very great; besides the Charge
of keeping the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners, which were above two thousand, and every
Day increased.</P>
<P>THE Duke was very impatient to repair and set out the Fleet again to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen Mother pre∣vents the Duke's going to Sea again.</NOTE> and resolved Nothing more than to go in Person again to command it,
his Family remaining still on Board, and preparing such Things as were
wanting for his Accommodation: But the Queen Mother had prevailed with
<PB N="271" REF="276"/>
the King at parting to promise her, “that the Duke should not go again
in Person in that Expedition;” which was concealed from the Duke, his
Majesty believing that the Confidence of his Royal Highness's going contri∣buted
very much to the setting out the Fleet, as it did so much, that but
for that, it had been impossible to have procured so much Money as was
with infinite Difficulty procured, to satisfy the Expenses of so many Kinds,
whereof many had been unthought of. And towards this there was a Be∣nefit
that flowed from a Fountain of extreme Misery, which was the In∣crease
of the Plague, which spread so fast that the King's staying so long in
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Town was very dangerous. Yet the Approach of this great Calamity, that
in other Respects produced great Mischiefs, advanced the present Enterprise:
For all People who had Money knew not what to do with it, not daring to
leave it in their Houses where They durst not stay themselves; so that They
willingly put it into the Bankers Hands, who supplied the King upon such
Assignations as the late Act of Parliament and other Branches of the King's
Revenue would yet bear.</P>
<P>AND if at this Time the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours had pursued their Office of
Mediation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Ambassadours neglect an Op∣portunity of making Peace.</HI></NOTE> it is very probable that it might have been with Success. For
besides the great Loss the <HI>Dutch</HI> had received in the Battle and in their being
<MILESTONE N="20"/>deprived of so many of the Merchants Ships, the Factions were irreconcilable
in the Fleet: There were many Officers who had behaved themselves very
basely and cowardly in the Action, but They knew not how to punish
them; <HI>Evertson</HI> and <HI>Trump,</HI> who were their best Seamen, would not submit
to be commanded by each other; the People were ready to rise upon <HI>De
Wit,</HI> upon whom They looked as the Occasion of the War, and cried
aloud for Peace. And the Faction amongst the <HI>States</HI> themselves was very
visible: All the other complained bitterly against the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI>
which” They said “had engaged them in a War against their Will and
without their Privity, which was directly contrary to the Form and Con∣stitution
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of their Government.” In a Word, Peace was universally de∣sired
and prayed for; and in the Opinion of all Men, any reasonable Con∣ditions
would at that Time have been yielded to. And as the People of
<HI>England</HI> generally had not been pleased with the beginning the War, so the
Court was weary of it; and the King would have been willing to have re∣ceived
any good Overtures for the composing it, and the Duke, since He
was kept from bearing a Part in it, would not have opposed it. But the
Ambassadours pressed no such Matter, but congratulated the Victory with
the same Joy They found in the Court, and seemed to think that any Mis∣fortune
that could befall the <HI>Dutch</HI> would be but a just Punishment for
<MILESTONE N="40"/>their Pride and Insolence towards all their neighbour Princes: The two Na∣tions
had not yet worried themselves enough, entirely to submit to the Arbi∣tration
of <HI>France;</HI> which it resolved They should do.</P>
<P>WITHIN less than a Month the Fleet was again prepared and ready for
the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleet a gain prepared.</NOTE> as strong and in as good a Condition as it had been before the Bat∣tle;
and the King and the Duke went thither, the Duke making no Doubt
of putting his Person on Board. And the King at that Time resolved that
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> should have the joint Command of
it: In order to which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was prepared, of whose easy Concur∣rence
only there was some Doubt, his Majesty promising himself all Confor∣mity
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and Resignation from the Earl of <HI>Sandwich;</HI> which He met with in
Both, for the Prince very cheerfully submitted to his Majesty's Pleasure. In
the Journey the King acquainted his Brother with his Resolution, and the
Promise He had made to the Queen their Mother; with which the Duke
<PB N="272" REF="277"/>
was much troubled, and offered many Reasons to divert his Majesty from
laying his Command upon him: But when He found there was no Remedy,
He submitted, and gave Orders for disembarking his Family and Goods.</P>
<P>BUT when this was communicated to Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who was to prepare
such Commissions and Warrants as upon this Alteration of Counsels were
necessary, He persuaded the Duke, and prevailed with him to believe,
“that it would be much better to commit the sole Command of the Fleet
to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> than to join Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in it with him,” who,
for no other Reason but for not esteeming him at the Rate He valued him∣self,
had been long in his Disfavour. He suggested some Defects in the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Prince, which Nobody could absolve him from, and which the gentle
Temper of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who knew him as well as the other,
could have complied with: And many thought it would have in the Con∣junction
produced a very good Mixture, the Danger from the Prince being
too sudden Resolutions from too much Heat and Passion, and the Earl
having enough of Phlegm and Wariness in deliberating, and much Vigour in
the executing what was concluded; and They were Both well prepared and
inclined to perform the Function.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. <HI>Coventry's</HI> Advice prevailed both with the Duke and King:
And so in the Instant that the King and Duke were to return from the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Fleet that was ready to set Sail with the first Wind, and not till then,
the King told Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> without enlarging upon the Reasons, “that
He would have him to return with him to <HI>London</HI> and accompany him
this Summer, and that the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> should have the sole Com∣mand
of the Fleet;” with which the Prince was wonderfully surprised
and perplexed and even heart-broken, but there was no contending. He
stayed behind the King only till He could get his Goods and Family disem∣barked,
and then returned with very much Trouble to the Court: And the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> set Sail with the Fleet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet puts out to Sea un∣der the Earl of</HI> Sandwich.</NOTE> with Direction first to visit the
Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> and if He found that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was not ready to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
come out, that He should go to the Northward to watch the <HI>East-India</HI>
Fleet, which had Orders from their Superiours to come by the <HI>North,</HI> that
They might avoid the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, that was Master of the Sea.</P>
<P>IT was in the End of <HI>June</HI> or Beginning of <HI>July</HI> that the King and Duke
returned from the Fleet; and within few Days after, it set Sail: When the
Plague increased so fast, that there died about two thousand in a Week; so
that all Men cried out against the King's staying so long at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the
Sickness being already in <HI>Westminster.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King moves to</HI> Hampton-Court <HI>on Ac∣count of the Plague.</HI></NOTE> Whereupon the King, after He had
taken the best Care He could with the Lord Mayor for the good ordering
the City, and published such Orders as were thought necessary for the Re∣lief<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and Regulation of infected Persons, and prevailed with some Justices of
the Peace in the <HI>Strand</HI> and in <HI>Westminster</HI> to promise to reside there
(which They were the more easily persuaded to do by the General's de∣claring
that He would stay in his Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> which He did
during the whole Time of the Pestilence; and the Lord <HI>Craven</HI> out of
Friendship to him stayed likewise in his House in <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI> And it
cannot be denied that the Presence of those two great Persons prevented
many Mischiefs which would have fallen out by the Disorder of the Peo∣ple,
and was of great Convenience and Benefit to that End of the Town):
I say, when the King had settled all this He removed to <HI>Hampton,</HI> re∣solving<MILESTONE N="50"/>
there to consider how to dispose of himself for the Remainder of the
Summer. And because there were many Particulars still unresolved con∣cerning
the Business of <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Majesty for some Days appointed that
<PB N="273" REF="278"/>
numerous People, that They might have no Pretence to come to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
to attend at <HI>Sion;</HI> where for many Days together his Majesty spent
many Hours, till He had composed that Affair as well as it was for the pre∣sent
capable of.</P>
<P>THE Plague still increased at <HI>London,</HI> and spread about the Country; so
that it was not thought safe for the Court to remain longer where it then
was, the Sickness being already in some of the adjacent Villages. Where∣upon
the King resolved that his own Family and his Brother's should re∣move
to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and spend the Summer there. And because it was
<MILESTONE N="10"/>already in View, that it would not be fit for the Parliament to assemble
again at <HI>Westminster</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> to which Time it was prorogued, nor
could it be computed at what Time it could be safe to meet in that Place;
and it was as notorious that if the Parliament met not somewhere, whereby
the King might have another Supply before the Winter, there would be very
great Confusion for Want of Money: He caused therefore a Proclamation to
issue out,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment ad∣journed to</HI> Ox∣ford.</NOTE> “that He intended to adjourn the Parliament to meet at <HI>Oxford</HI>
upon the tenth of <HI>October</HI> next, and that the Members need not to attend
at <HI>Westminster</HI> in <HI>September.</HI>” And then He directed the Speaker of the
House of Commons, who lived within Half a Day of <HI>London,</HI> and the Ge∣neral
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and the Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> to give Notice to the Members of Both Houses,
who lived within that Distance, to be present in Both Houses at the Day to
which They were prorogued, and then to adjourn to <HI>Oxford</HI> according to
the Proclamation. And this being settled, his Majesty appointed a Day
for beginning his Progress from <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> to <HI>Salisbury;</HI> against which
Time all Carriages and whatsoever was necessary for the Journey were
prepared.</P>
<P>IN the Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> W. Co∣ventry <HI>per∣suades the Duke to spend the Summer at</HI> York.</NOTE> when every Body believed that the King and Queen and
Duke and Dutchess, with Both their Families, were to go together one Way,
Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> found a Way to break that Resolution, having no Mind to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>be in so great a Court that his Greatness would not appear. He told the
Duke, “that there were general Discontents throughout the Kingdom,”
which was true, “and a Probability of Insurrections,” which were much
spoken of and apprehended; “and therefore it might be better that the
King and the Duke might not be together, but in several Places, that
They might draw what Forces were necessary to them, which the Pre∣sence
of their own Persons would easily do: That the Fleet would pro∣bably
be all the Summer upon the Northern Coast in Expectation of the
<HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Fleet;” for it was not then thought that the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
would have been able to have set out another Fleet able to have
<MILESTONE N="40"/>encountered ours. Upon the whole Matter He proposed to him, “that since
the King meant to spend the Summer in the <HI>West,</HI> with which there
could very hardly be any Correspondence from the Fleet, his Highness
should go into the <HI>North</HI> and reside at <HI>York;</HI> by which He would have
an Influence upon all those Parts where the most disaffected Persons were
most inhabitant, and from <HI>Hull</HI> and those maritime Parts He could not
be long without receiving some Intelligence from the Fleet.”</P>
<P>THE Truth is; the Constitution of the Court at this Time was such, the
Prevalence of the Lady so great, and the Queen's Humour thereupon so in∣constant,
and all together so discomposed the King, that there was no Plea∣sure
<MILESTONE N="50"/>in being a Part of it: And therefore the Advice was as soon embraced,
as given, by the Duke and his Wife, who were well content to enjoy them∣selves
in their own Family apart. And the Duke presently proposed it to
the King, and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> discoursed all the Motives to him so fully
<PB N="274" REF="279"/>
that his Majesty approved it. And then, if it were to be done at all, the
first attending the King to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which was so much out of the Way,
would be to no Purpose: And therefore it was resolved (all the Coaches
and Carriages being then at the Doors to go to <HI>Farnham,</HI> which was the
first Day's Journey towards <HI>Salisbury</HI>),<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣moves to</HI> Salis∣bury.</NOTE> that the King and his Brother would
part upon the Place, and that the King and Queen should continue their
Purpose for <HI>Farnham,</HI> and the Duke and his Wife should go that Night
to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> and so prosecute his Journey for <HI>York;</HI> and all Orders were
in the Instant given out to this Purpose.</P>
<P>WHETHER the Reasons of this Counsel were of Importance or not, the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Alteration on such a sudden from what had been before determined was
thought very strange, and wondered at, and made many believe that some
Accident was fallen out that must not be discovered: For on the sudden
it was, there having been no such Thought Overnight, when the Chan∣cellor
left the Court to go to his own House at <HI>Twickenham.</HI> And when
He returned the next Morning, the Resolution was taken, and every Body
well pleased with the Change, and both the King and the Duke told
him with Satisfaction of it; nor did He understand it enough to make
Objections against it, which would have been ingrateful; nor was it conve∣nient
to spend longer Time in Deliberation at that Place, where some of the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
inferiour Servants had died the Night before of the Plague: And so They
all entered upon their Journey by Nine of the Clock the same Morning.</P>
<P>IT is necessary in this Place to remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Bishop of</HI> Munster <HI>en∣gages to in∣vade the</HI> U∣nited Pro∣vinces.</NOTE> that the Express, that had been
sent by the Bishop of <HI>Munster's</HI> Agent with the Conditions which were of∣fered
by the King, returned with great Expedition, and brought the Bishop's
Acceptation and Engagement, “that, upon the Payment of the first Sum
that was agreed upon, He would draw his Army together, and march
with an Army of twenty thousand Horse and Foot into the <HI>States</HI> Domi∣nions.”
And the King before He left <HI>London</HI> had signed the Treaty, and
made the first Payment, and provided for the second: So that He now ex∣pected<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that the Bishop should be shortly upon his March, and fix his Win∣ter-Quarters
in those <HI>Provinces;</HI> which He did resolve and intend with Cou∣rage
and Sincerity, and which in that Conjuncture must have put the
Counsels of <HI>Holland</HI> into great Confusion, when they began to be again
reduced into some Order.</P>
<P>THE indefatigable Industry and Dexterity of the Pensionary <HI>De Wit</HI>
prevailed with the <HI>States</HI> to believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Wit <HI>per∣suades the</HI> Dutch <HI>to pre∣pare another Fleet.</HI></NOTE> “that He thought a Peace to be ne∣cessary
for their Affairs, and desired Nothing but that it might be upon
honourable and safe Conditions, and that <HI>France</HI> was very real in the en∣deavouring
it: But that the Enemy was so insolent upon their late Suc∣cess,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that They neglected all Overtures, and believed that the Factions and
Divisions amongst themselves would hinder them from being able to set out
another Fleet; and therefore that ought to be the first Design. And if
their Fleet were ready to go out, He doubted not but a Peace would
quickly follow: For that <HI>France</HI> was engaged, if the King should not
consent to what is just and reasonable, to declare a War against <HI>England,</HI>
and to assist them with Men and Money, and all his own naval Power,
which the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was then preparing and making ready in all
the Ports of <HI>France.</HI> But that it was not to be expected that They would
send out their Fleet, which was much inferiour to the <HI>English,</HI> except<MILESTONE N="50"/>
They first saw a <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet at Sea ready to join with them.” He wished
them to consider “how much They were all concerned in their <HI>India</HI> Ships,
which were in their Voyage, and could not be far from their Coasts in a
<PB N="275" REF="280"/>
short Time; all which would inevitably fall into the Hands of the <HI>English,</HI>
if They had no Fleet at Sea to relieve them.”</P>
<P>THESE Reasons, of Weight in themselves, and the Concernment of most
of them in the Preservation of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships, prevailed with them to
do all that could be done to set out a new Fleet: And to that Purpose
They sent very strict and severe Orders to their several Admiralties, for the
proceeding against all, without Distinction of Persons, who had misbehaved
themselves in the late Battle, and to provide new Ships and all necessary
Provisions, to the End that their Fleet might be at Sea by a Time. And
<MILESTONE N="10"/>this grew the more easy to them, by the seasonable Return of <HI>De Ruyter</HI>
with his Fleet from <HI>Guinea,</HI> which brought a present Addition of good
Strength; and He had began the War upon the <HI>English,</HI> and was the best
Sea-Officer They had, and had exercised those Commands that no other Of∣ficer
could refuse to obey him.</P>
<P>FOR the speedy carrying on these present Preparations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>make a Re∣formation in their Nae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> They made, ac∣cording
to their usual Custom in extraordinary Occurrences, Committees of
the <HI>States</HI> to assist in the Admiralties of <HI>Zealand, Amsterdam,</HI> and <HI>Rot∣terdam;</HI>
and to that Purpose <HI>De Wit,</HI> and such other as He thought fittest
at this Time to join with him, were appointed. They went first to the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Fleet to reform the Disorders there: And though They durst not proceed
with that Severity as had been fit, yet They cashiered many Captains and
other Officers, and put some other Marks of Disgrace upon others, and
caused one or two to die.</P>
<P>BUT that which <HI>De Wit's</HI> Heart was most set upon was to take Revenge
upon <HI>Van Trump,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Wit's <HI>Ma∣lice against</HI> Van Trump.</NOTE> and to remove him from ever having any Command at Sea:
For though He was an excellent Officer, and upon the Stock of his Father's
Credit of great Estimation with the Seamen, and inferiour to no Man but
<HI>De Ruyter,</HI> and had behaved himself in the Battle with signal Courage; yet
his Dispute with <HI>Evertson</HI> upon Command had brought much Prejudice to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>them. But that which was worst of all and incensed <HI>De Wit</HI> implacably
was, that He was of entire Devotion to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as his Fa∣ther
had always been and all his Children continued to be, and He knew
well had an especial Part, how covertly soever, in fomenting the Murmurs
of the People against him and the War: And He resolved to take this Op∣portunity
of the good Temper the <HI>States</HI> were in in their Concurrence for
the setting out the Fleet, not only to provide for the better Government of
their Ships and marine Conduct, but to punish and prevent the Murmurs at
Land, by removing all those out of any Power whom He suspected to have
secretly contributed to them. He did all He could to make <HI>Van Trump's</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Offence capital, as if the Right of Command had been so clear in <HI>Evert∣son</HI>
that the other could not dispute it: But <HI>Van Trump</HI> defended himself
so well and had so many Friends, that He was absolved from that Guilt.
Yet for some passionate and indiscreet Words, in which He did naturally
abound, He was deprived of his Command, with a Declaration “that He
should no more be employed in the Service of the <HI>States;</HI>” which whilst
the Government was in those Hands He cared not for, and had a good Es∣tate
to subsist without it. And so for the present all Differences were com∣posed
so far, as to have a general Concurrence in whatsoever was necessary,
and in order to the making ready and setting out their Fleet to Sea.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>THE King had been few Days at <HI>Salisbury</HI> before the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI>
Ambassadours arrived there,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Ambassadours seem desirous of mediating a Peace.</HI></NOTE> and then They made some Instance with the
King, that there might be a Treaty for Peace; and the <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dours
declared, “that the King their Master was so far engaged by Treaty
<PB N="276" REF="281"/>
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that if the King would not accept of a just and an ho∣nourable
Peace, his Majesty must declare himself on their Behalf, which
He was unwilling to do.” The King answered, “that if there were
any such Engagement He had not been well dealt with; for that the
<HI>French</HI> King had given his Word to him, <HI>that He would not enter into
any Treaty with the</HI> Dutch <HI>but</HI> pari passu <HI>with his Majesty”</HI> (and
when his Majesty had been informed that there was some Treaty concluded
with them, He was assured from <HI>France</HI> “that it was only a Treaty of
Commerce, which He had been obliged to enter into to prevent an Edict
in <HI>Holland,</HI> by which strong Waters and other <HI>French</HI> Commodities would<MILESTONE N="10"/>
have been inhibited to be brought into those <HI>Provinces,</HI> but that there
was Nothing in that Treaty that could be to his Majesty's Prejudice”):
That his Majesty had been always ready to embrace Peace, which had
been never yet offered by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> nor did He know what Condi∣tions
They expected.”</P>
<P>THE Ambassadours seemed to be much offended with the insolent Beha∣viour
of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and confessed “that They were not solicitous for Peace,
but only desired to engage the King their Master in the War: But that
if his Majesty would make his Demands, which They presumed would
be reasonable, the other should be brought to consent to them.” To which<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the King replied, “that They had begun the War upon him and not He
upon them, and that God had hitherto given him the Advantage, which
He hoped He should improve; and till They were as desirous of a Peace
as He, it would not become him to make any Propositions.” And in
this Manner that Affair stood whilst the Court remained at <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P>AND there now fell out an unexpected Accident, which looked as if
Providence had been inclined to repair the Mischief and the Damage that
the Plague had produced to the Affairs of the King. It hath been men∣tioned
before, that upon the first Thoughts of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
King had sent Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI> to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Denmark,</HI> to engage those Crowns as far as might be on his Majesty's
Behalf, Both of them being enough disobliged and provoked by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Coventry</HI> in <HI>Sweden</HI> found a frank and open Reception,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Success of Mr.</HI> Henry Co∣ventry's <HI>Em∣bassy to</HI> Sweden.</NOTE> avowing a
hearty Affection to the King, and an Inclination to join in any Thing that
might not be destructive to their own Affairs: Nor did They dissemble the
Injuries They had received from the <HI>Hollander</HI> even to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambas∣sadour
himself, who was at the same Time sent thither to unite that Crown
to their Interest, to which Purpose He had made several specious Overtures.
Nor did They conceal the Jealousy They had of the <HI>French,</HI> who had not
complied with the Payment of the yearly Sum of Money which They were<MILESTONE N="40"/>
obliged to make to them for the Support of their Army, of which They were
in a great Arrear, that discomposed their Affairs very much. And though <HI>M.
Pompone,</HI> who had been long Resident in that Court as an Envoy, was now
come thither as Ambassadour from <HI>France,</HI> and brought with him a good
Sum of Money to retain them fast to their Dependance upon them; yet the
Money was not Half that was due to them, and They well knew what
dark Ends it was for: And They did exceedingly fear the Omnipotence
of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were two Things, which kept them from a full Declaration on
the King's Behalf, and engaging presently in his Interest. The first was the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Apprehension that They had of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that it would take this Opportu∣nity
to unite themselves more firmly to the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and so attempt to
deprive <HI>Sweden</HI> of all their late Conquest, which was confirmed to them by
<PB N="277" REF="282"/>
their own Treaty of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> which They were resolved never to part
from: And in this Particular They were to expect some Satisfaction and
Security from the Negotiation of Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot.</HI> The other was, that
They might see the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> fully engaged, upon whose Expedi∣tion
They had much Expectation. And Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had informed them
of that whole Agreement, which would have given them Opportunity to
have prosecuted their own Design upon <HI>Bremen,</HI> to which their Hearts were
most devoted.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> had been as well received in <HI>Denmark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of Sir</HI> Gilbert Tal∣bot's <HI>to</HI> Den∣mark.</NOTE> with all the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Professions imaginable of Affection to the King, and of their Detestation of
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who in Truth had exercised a strange Tyranny over them by
the Advantage of their Necessities; nor is the Injustice, Oppression and In∣dignities
which They had sustained from them to be expressed and described,
without entering into a large Discourse of Particulars which are foreign to
this Relation: Let it suffice, that there needed few Arguments to persuade
that King to any Thing that was within his Power, and which would have
done signal Mischief to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But the Truth is, the Kingdom was
very poor, the People unwarlike, the King himself very good and very
weak, jealous of all the great Men, and not yet recovered of the Fright that
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>Wolfelt</HI> had put him into. His chief Minister, one <HI>Gabell,</HI> had gotten his
Credit by having been his Barber, an illiterate and unbred Man, yet his sole
Confident in his Business of greatest Trust; which made all the Persons of
Quality in the Kingdom, who are as proud of their Nobility as any Nation,
full of Indignation. And They were able to cross many Resolutions after
they were taken, though They could not establish others in the Place; which
made the King very irresolute and unfixed: So that what was concluded To∣Day
was reversed or not pursued To-morrow. They professed a great Jea∣lousy
of the <HI>Swede,</HI> as the greatest Argument, but their Weakness, against a
War with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> yet were not willing to propose any Expedients which
<MILESTONE N="30"/>might secure them against those Jealousies. And the King absolutely denied
that He had ever given <HI>Hannibal Zested</HI> Authority to declare, “that He would
again confirm the Treaty He had made” and seemed to take it unkindly
that his Majesty should think it reasonable, who therefore thought it so, be∣cause
it was proposed by himself, and because He still confessed, “that He
could make no Attempt to recover what He had parted with.” That
which He did unreasonably design, in all the Disguises which were put on,
was to engage the King to endeavour to persuade the <HI>Swede</HI> to give up and
restore <HI>Elsenore</HI> and the other Places to <HI>Denmark,</HI> or to assist him with
Force for the Recovery of them when there should be a Peace concluded
<MILESTONE N="40"/>with <HI>Holland:</HI> So that the King despaired of any Good from that Ne∣gotiation,
and resolved shortly to recall his Minister from thence.</P>
<P>BUT there was on a sudden a Change to Wonder.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A particular Account of the Attempt upon the</HI> Dutch <HI>at</HI> Bergen.</NOTE> <HI>Gabell</HI> came early in
a Morning to Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> and told him, “his <HI>Master was now re∣solved</HI>
to unite his Interest entirely to that of the King of <HI>England,</HI> having
now an Opportunity to do it securely to Both their Benefits.” He told
him, “that there were Letters arrived that Night from <HI>Bergen,</HI> with News
that the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Ships were all arrived in that Port with Orders
to remain there till they received new Orders from <HI>Holland,</HI> which they
should have as soon as their Fleet should be ready to join with them.
<MILESTONE N="50"/>This had disposed the King to resolve to give the King of <HI>England</HI> Op∣portunity
to possess himself of all that Treasure, out of which He pre∣sumed
He would allow him such a Share, as might enable him to declare,
and assist his Majesty vigorously in his War against the <HI>Dutch.</HI> That if
<PB N="278" REF="283"/>
He gave speedy Notice to the King's Fleet, which every Body knew was
then at Sea, it might easily go to <HI>Bergen,</HI> where They might as easily
surprise all those Ships in the Port, since They should receive no Oppo∣sition
from the Castles under whose Protection they lay.”</P>
<P>AND when He had done his Relation, He offered him to go with him
to the King, that He might receive the Obligation from himself; which
Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> presently did, and found his Majesty as cheerful in the
Resolution as <HI>Gabell</HI> had been. He repeated all that the other had said,
and more particularly “that He thought it reasonable that He might ex∣pect
Half of the Value that the Whole would amount to; which He would<MILESTONE N="10"/>
rely upon the King's Honour and Justice for, after the Ships should be in
<HI>England,</HI> that He might not be suspected by the <HI>Hollander,</HI> for He would
protest against the Act as a Violence that He could not resist: And that He
would expect so many of his Majesty's Ships to arrive in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and
to assist him, before He positively declared against the <HI>Dutch.</HI>” He wished
Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> “to send an Express forthwith to the King with all these
Particulars;” which He did the next Day.</P>
<P>THIS Express arrived within few Days after the King came to <HI>Salisbury,</HI>
and was dispatched presently back again with Letters to the King of <HI>Den∣mark</HI>
of his Majesty's Consent and Ratification of all that He had proposed,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and with Letters likewise to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who according to his
former Orders had sailed Northward in Hope to meet with that Fleet,
which was before got into <HI>Norway.</HI> The King's Letters to him came in a
very good Season, and He immediately continued his Course for <HI>Norway:</HI>
And when He came to that Length, and near enough to that Land of
Rocks which are terrible to all Seamen, He thought it best to remain at
Sea with his Fleet, lest <HI>De Ruyter</HI> might by this Time be come out with
his Fleet (since his being come Northward could not be concealed, nor the
Arrival of the <HI>East-India</HI> Fleet at <HI>Bergen;</HI> which would hasten the other),
and sent in a Squadron of fifteen or sixteen good Ships (of Strength suffi∣cient<MILESTONE N="30"/>
for the Business) into the Harbour of <HI>Bergen</HI> with a Letter to the Go∣vernour.
And with it He sent a Gentleman that was a Volunteer on Board
him, who hath been often mentioned before, Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> the Confident of
the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who was well instructed in all the Transactions which
had been at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> Before They went into the Harbour, Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI>
and another Gentleman or two went by Boat to the Town, where He found
all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships (about a Dozen in Number) riding very near the Shore,
and all under the Protection of the Castle, into which They had put much
of their richest Lading from the Time of their first coming thither, as to a
Place of unquestionable Security.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Governour was not surprised with the Messengers or the Letter, as
appeared by the Reception of Both, but seemed troubled that They were
come so soon, before the Manner of performing the Action was enough
adjusted: He could not deny but “that He had received Orders from
<HI>Copenhagen;</HI> but that He expected more perfect Directions within
four and twenty Hours, and expected likewise the Presence of the
Vice-King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who was his superiour Officer, and would in∣fallibly
be there the next Day.” The Behaviour of the Man was such
as made them believe it sincere, as in Truth it was, for He meant well,
and was content that the Ships, which though they were not come<MILESTONE N="50"/>
into the Port did not ride safe amongst the Rocks, should come into the
Port, upon Assurance that They would not attempt any hostile Act with∣out
his Consent, which was till all Things should be agreed between
<PB N="279" REF="284"/>
them: And so the Fleet entered; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> perceived with great
Consternation, yet changed the Posture of some of their Ships, and new-moored
the rest, and put themselves upon their Defence.</P>
<P>IT is a Port like no other that the World knows, a very great Number
of formidable Rocks, between each of which the Sea runs deep enough for
the greatest Ships to ride securely; so that the Ships were as in so many
Chambers apart between the Rocks: And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which came thither
first, had possessed themselves of that Line of the Sea that lay next to the
Shore, to which They lay so near that They could descend from their
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Vessels on Land; which had been much the better for the Enterprise, if
the <HI>Dane</HI> had concurred in it.</P>
<P>IT was so late before the <HI>English</HI> Ships had taken their Places, which
was as near the <HI>Dutch</HI> as the Rocks would permit, that they remained
quiet all Night, which was spent in Consultation between the Commander
in Chief of the <HI>English</HI> Ships (who was a stout and a good Officer but a
rough Man, who knew better how to follow his Instructions than to de∣bate
the Ground of them; but He was advised by Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and con∣formed
to his Judgment) and the Governour of the Town and Castle,
who seemed still inclined not only to suffer the <HI>English</HI> to do what They
<MILESTONE N="20"/>would, but to be willing to act a Part in it himself from the Shore, and to
expect hourly Orders to that Purpose, as likewise the Arrival of the Vice-King,
whose Authority was more equal to that Attempt, and who was a
Man well known to have a particular Reverence for the King, and as parti∣cular
a Prejudice and Animosity against the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Night being over,
the Governour continued all the next Day as desirous and importunate that
the Enterprise might be longer deferred; upon which there were some cho∣lerick
Words between the Governour and a Gentleman of Quality who was
a Volunteer on Board the Ships, which many thought in some Degree irre∣conciled
the Governour to the Affair.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>IN Conclusion: The Commander of the Squadron was willing to think
that the Governour had rather it should be done without his declared Con∣sent
than by it, and so told him, “that the next Morning He was resolved
to weigh his Anchors and to fall upon the <HI>Dutch;</HI>” to which the other
made such a Reply as confirmed him in his former Imagination. And in
the Morning the Ships were brought out of their several Channels, and
placed as near the Sides of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as they could be, from whence
They resolved to board them as soon as They had sent their Broadsides upon
them. But They found that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had spent their Time well; for in
the two Days and two Nights that the <HI>English</HI> had been in the Harbour,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>besides the unlading the richest of their Commodities that were left into the
Castle, They had drawn all their Ordnance, which lay on that Side of the
Ships which was to the Shore, on Land, and planted them upon a rising
Ground, that They could shoot over their own Ships upon the <HI>English:</HI> And a
Breastwork was cast up, behind which all the Inhabitants of the Town
were in Arms.</P>
<P>IT was a fair Warning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill Success of it.</NOTE> and might very well have persuaded our Men to
be glad to retire out of the Harbour, which yet They might have done: But
their Courage or their Anger disposed them to make farther Trial of the
Governour, for They feared not the Ordnance from the Land which the
<MILESTONE N="50"/><HI>Dutch</HI> had planted, nor the Muskets from the Breastworks, if the Castle did
them no Harm, under the Power of which They all were. And so They fell
upon their Work: And in some Time, and with the Loss of many Men from
the Ships and from the Land, They had dismounted many of the Ordnance upon
<PB N="280" REF="285"/>
the Shore, and were even ready to board the Ships; when out of absurd Rage
or Accident a Ship or two of the <HI>English</HI> discharged some Guns both upon
the Breastworks, from whence They had received no Prejudice, and upon
the Town, which beat down some Houses. But then all the Muskets from
the Breastworks were poured out, and Guns from the Castle, which killed
very many common Men, and five or six Officers of very good Account,
and some Gentlemen Volunteers, amongst which was <HI>Edward Mountague,</HI>
eldest Son to the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton</HI> and Cousin German to the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> a proper Man and wellbred but not easy to be pleased, and
who was then withdrawn from the Court, where He was Master of the Horse<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to the Queen, and in some Discontent had put himself on Board the Fleet
with a Captain, without the Privity of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and was now
slain. There was now no farther Experiment to be made, but how They
could get to Sea, which might easily have been prevented from the Shore
and from the Rocks: But from the Minute that They prepared to be gone
and gave over shooting, there was no more done against them, and They
had Pilots from the Country that carried them safe out.</P>
<P>THE Noise of the Guns had called the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> as near the
Mouth of the Harbour as could safely be, to discover what became of his
Squadron; so that They came shortly to him with the whole Account of<MILESTONE N="20"/>
their ill Success, and within a short Time after a Shallop from the Governour,
with a Letter to the Officer who had commanded the Squadron, complaining
as much as He could do of the Misbehaviour of the <HI>English</HI> in shooting upon
the Town, and desiring “that Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> would give him a Meeting at a
Place He “appointed, to which the Shallop should convey him.” Mr.
<HI>Clifford</HI> was more willing to go than the Earl was to permit him; yet at
last upon his earnest Desire He consented, and He put himself into the
Shallop. It happened that when the Action was over and the <HI>English</HI>
under Sail, the Vice-King arrived at <HI>Bergen</HI> with two or three Regiments
of the Country; and the Orders were likewise come from <HI>Copenhagen,</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
whereby, at least as They pretended, They were required to permit all
that the <HI>English</HI> desired: And the Vice-King had caused the Shallop to be
sent, and was himself with the Governour at the Place whither Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI>
was to come, and there He spake with them together.</P>
<P>THE Governour with many Protestations excused himself for shooting from
the Castle, after the Town was assaulted, and many of the Burghers killed,
who had stood in Arms only to defend the Town, without being concerned
for the <HI>Dutch</HI> or their Ships; and made it an Argument of his Integrity
and Respect, “that He had permitted them to depart when it was in his
Power to have sunk them.” He complained, “that the Commander<MILESTONE N="40"/>
would not have the Patience to defer the Assault one Day longer, which
if He had done the Orders from <HI>Copenhagen</HI> had been come, and the
Vice-King had been present with his Forces, which would have secured
the Enterprise.” The Vice-King seemed very much troubled for what
had been done, and earnestly desired “that the same or another Squadron
might be again sent in, when They should be at Liberty to do what
They would upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and if They stood in Need of Assistance
They should have as much as was necessary.”</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Clifford</HI> replied to many of the Excuses which were made, and
urged “the suffering the <HI>Dutch</HI> to bring their Ordnance on Shore, and the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Townsmen being in Arms to assist them;” and proposed, “that They
would first begin by seizing upon some of their Ships, and then that their
Fleet should answer:” But this the Vice-King did absolutely refuse, and
<PB N="281" REF="286"/>
made another Proposition that startled more and was directly new, “that
when the <HI>English</HI> had seized upon all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, They should not
have carried any of them away till a perfect Division of the Goods was
made, that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> might have his just Proportion.” Mr.
<HI>Clifford</HI> made no Answer but “that He would present all that They proposed
to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> in whom the Power of concluding and executing
remained solely:” And so He returned to the Fleet, and They to the
Town and expected an Answer.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> thought not fit to run any more Hazards,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sandwich <HI>de∣clines making another At∣tempt.</HI></NOTE> and
<MILESTONE N="10"/>was not satisfied that They had proceeded sincerely. But that which most
prevailed with him was, that He had received Intelligence “that <HI>De Ruyter</HI>
was come out with the Fleet,” and He would not He should find him
entangled in those Rocks, or obliged to fight with him upon that Coast;
and the Season of the Year now made that Station very unsecure, for it
was already the Beginning of <HI>October,</HI> when those Seas run very high and
boisterous: And therefore He resolved to be Master of more Sea-Room,
that He might fight <HI>De Ruyter</HI> if He came, and if He did not He might
then meet those <HI>East-India</HI> Ships more securely in their Way to <HI>Holland,</HI>
than by making another Attempt in the Harbour. And so, after some
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Letters had passed and repassed between the Vice-King and him, and both
the Vice-King and Governour had undertaken to keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships there
for the Space of six Weeks, for They desired to see the Success of another
Engagement between the two Fleets; the Earl steered that Way with his
Fleet that most probably might bring him and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> together, which
above all Things He desired.</P>
<P>THIS whole Affair of <HI>Bergen</HI> and the Managery thereof was so perplexed
and intricate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Reflections upon this As∣sain.</NOTE> that it was never clearly understood. That which seemed to
have most Probability was, that as soon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet came to <HI>Bergen,</HI>
They had unladen many of their richest Commodities and put them into the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Castle, before the Governour had received his Orders from <HI>Copenhagen:</HI> And
so both his own and his Master's Faith and Honour were engaged to discharge
the Trust, of which He made Haste to send an Account to the King, and
thereupon expected new Directions, which were not arrived when the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Fleet came thither. And when they did come, whether that Court
according to its Custom did change its Mind, and believe They should make
a better Bargain by keeping what was already deposited in their Hands in
the Castle, than by making an uncertain Division with the King; or whe∣ther
They did in Truth continue firm to the first Agreement, and that the
Messenger was stopped by extraordinary Accidents in his Journey (which
<MILESTONE N="40"/>was positively alleged), so that He did not arrive in Time; or whether the
Governour was not able to master the Town that was much inclined to the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> before the Vice-King came with his Troops, who did make all
possible Haste as soon as He heard that the <HI>English</HI> were arrived; or whe∣ther
the <HI>English</HI> did proceed more unadvisedly and rashly than They ought to
have done; remains still in the Dark: And Both Parties reproached each other
afterwards, as They found most necessary for their several Defences and Pre∣tences;
of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>THE King stayed not altogether so long at <HI>Salisbury</HI> as He had intended
to have done:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King and the Court re∣move to Ox∣ford.</NOTE> For besides a little accidental Indisposition which made him
<MILESTONE N="50"/>dislike the Air, some inferiour Servants and their Wives came from <HI>London</HI>
or the Villages adjacent, and brought the Plague with them; so that the
Court removed to <HI>Oxford</HI> before the End of <HI>September,</HI> the Parliament
being to assemble there on the tenth of the next Month. And before He
<PB N="282" REF="287"/>
left <HI>Salisbury,</HI> his Majesty sent an Express to <HI>York</HI> to his Brother, “that He
would meet him as soon as He could.” The Duke had lived in great
Lustre in <HI>York</HI> all that Summer, with the very great Respect and continual
Attendance of all the Persons of Quality of that large County: And the
Duke no sooner received his Majesty's Summons than He took Post, and
left his Wife and Family to follow by ordinary Journeys, and himself
came to <HI>Oxford</HI> the next Day after the King, where there were indeed
Matters of the highest Importance to be consulted and resolved?</P>
<P>THE King had sent Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> to <HI>Denmark</HI> to be satisfied, upon Confe∣rence
with Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> concerning the Miscarriage at <HI>Bergen,</HI> and if<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the Ships remained still there according to the Promise the Vice-King
had made, and if that King were ready to perform what He had under∣taken,
that all Particulars might be so adjusted that there might be no far∣ther
Mistake; and if He found that the Jealousy of <HI>Sweden</HI> was a real Ob∣struction
to that Alliance, that He should make a Journey to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and
upon Conference with Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who by his Dexterity and very good
Parts had reconciled the Affections of that Court to a very great Esteem of
him, endeavour to remove all those Obstructions: And as soon as his
Majesty should receive full Information of that whole Affair, He must con∣sider
what He was to do to vindicate himself in that Business of <HI>Bergen;</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
for He knew well that He must suffer with all the World, for violating the
Peace of a Port that was under the Government of a neighbour Prince with
whom He was allied, if He did not make it appear that He had the Con∣sent
of that Prince, which He was not willing to do till He first knew what
that King would do.</P>
<P>IN the next Place his Majesty was to resolve what Answer to make to
the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A farther Ne∣gotiation with the</HI> French <HI>Ambassadours.</HI></NOTE> who now desired frequent Audiences, and posi∣tively
declared, “that their Master was engaged by his Treaty with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> that in Case They were invaded or assaulted by any Prince, He
would assist them with Men, Money and Ships, which He had hitherto de∣ferred<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to do out of Respect to the King, and in Hope that He would ac∣cept
his Mediation, and make such Propositions towards Peace as He
might press the others to consent to.” The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour was
likewise come to Town, rather to treat concerning the Prisoners and to ob∣serve
what the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours did, than that He had any Thing to
propose in Order to Peace, there appearing now since their Fleet was at Sea
more Insolence in the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a greater Aversion from the Peace, than
had been formerly.</P>
<P>THE King complained to the Ambassadours of the <HI>French</HI> King's Pro∣ceedings,
“that the entering into that Treaty was expressly against his Word<MILESTONE N="40"/>
given to the King: That the <HI>Dutch</HI> had first began the War, and ought
to make the first Approach towards Peace, but that their Ambassadour had
no Instruction to make any such Instance; and therefore it seemed very
strange to his Majesty, that the <HI>French</HI> King should press for that which
They had no Desire to have.”</P>
<P>THE Ambassadours confessed “that the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not desire a Peace;
that They thought They were too much behindhand, and that They
had at present great Advantages; that They looked upon the great
Plague in <HI>London</HI>” (which continued in its full Rage and Vigour, inso∣much
as at that Time in the End of <HI>September</HI> there died not so few as six<MILESTONE N="50"/>
thousand in the Week, amongst which some were of the best Quality in the
City) “as of such insupportable Damage to the King, that He would not
be able to set out another Fleet the Year following: And therefore that,
<PB N="283" REF="288"/>
when They had been pressed by the <HI>French</HI> King to make some Propositions
towards Peace, He could get no other Answer from them, than <HI>that They
expected that the Island of</HI> Poleroone <HI>should be released to them, and that the
Fort at</HI> Cabo Corso <HI>in</HI> Guinea <HI>should be thrown down and slighted,</HI> which
They confessed was an insolent Proposition. That They complained
<HI>that the King their Master, instead of giving them the Assistance He was
obliged to do, spent the Time in procuring a Peace, which They cared not
for:</HI> So that,” They said, “their Master continued the same Christian Of∣fice
principally to do his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> a Service, who He
<MILESTONE N="10"/>in Truth believed would be reduced to great Streights by the terrible Ef∣fect
of the Plague; and in the next Place to defend himself from entering
into the War, which He could no longer defer to do, if his Majesty did
not, by consenting to some reasonable Overture, give him a just Occasion
to press them to yield to it, and in that Case He would behave himself in
that Manner that the King should have no Cause to complain of his Par∣tiality.”
The King's Indignation was so provoked by the Pride and Im∣pudence
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Demands, that He gave the Ambassadours no other
Answer, than “that He hoped God Almighty had not sent that heavy
Judgment of the Plague upon him and his People on the Behalf of the
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>Hollanders,</HI> and to expose him to their Insolence.”</P>

Numbers than could reasonably have been ex∣pected,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment meets at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE>
the Sickness still continuing to rage and
spread itself in several Counties; so that between
the Danger that was in the Towns infected, and
the necessary Severity in other Towns to keep
themselves, from being infected, it was a very
inconvenient Season for all Persons of Quality to
travel from their own Habitations. Upon the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>tenth of <HI>October</HI> the King commanded Both
Houses to attend him in <HI>Christ-Church</HI> Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech to Roth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and told them, “that He was
confident They did all believe, that if it had not been absolutely neces∣sary
to consult with them He would not have called them together at
that Time, when the Contagion had spread itself over so many Parts of
the Kingdom: And He thanked them for their Compliance so far with
his Desires.”</P>
<P>HIS Majesty said, “the Truth was; as He had entered upon the War
by their Advice and Encouragement, so He desired that They might as
frequently as was possible receive Information of the Effects and Conduct
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of it, and that He might have the Continuance of their cheerful Supply
for the carrying it on. He would not deny to them, that it had proved
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
more chargeable than He could imagine it would have been: The Addi∣tion
the Enemy had still made to their Fleets, beyond their first Purpose,
made it unavoidably necessary for him to make proportionable Prepara∣tions,
which God had hitherto blessed with Success in all Encounters.
And as They had used their utmost Endeavours by Calumnies and false
Suggestions to gain Friends to themselves, and to persuade them to assist
them against him, so He had not been wanting to encourage those Princes
who had been wronged by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to recover their own by Force;
and in Order thereunto, He had assisted the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> with a
great Sum of ready Money, and was to continue a Supply to him, who<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He believed was at that Time in the Bowels of their Country with a pow∣erful
Army.”</P>
<P>“THOSE Issues, which He might tell them had been made with very
much Conduct and Husbandry (nor indeed did He know that any Thing
had been spent that could have been well and safely saved);” He said,
“those Expenses would not suffer them to wonder, that the great Supply
which They gave him for this War in so bountiful a Proportion was upon
the Matter already spent: So that He must not only expect an Assistance
from them to carry on that War, but such an Assistance as might enable
him to defend himself and them against a more powerful Neighbour, if<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He should prefer the Friendship of the <HI>Dutch</HI> before his.”</P>
<P>HE put them in Mind, “that when He entered upon this War He had
told them, <HI>that He had not such a brutal Appetite as to make War for
War's Sake;</HI> He was still of the same Mind: He had been ready to re∣ceive
any Propositions that <HI>France</HI> had thought fit to offer to that End,
but hitherto Nothing had been offered worthy his Acceptance; nor was
the <HI>Dutch</HI> less insolent, though He knew no Advantage They had got but
the Continuance of the Contagion, and He hoped that God Almighty
would shortly deprive them of that Encouragement.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor at the same Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Substance of the Chancel∣lor's Speech.</NOTE> by the King's Command, made a<MILESTONE N="30"/>
short Narrative of the History of the War, the Circumstances with which
it was begun, and the Progress it had since made and the Victory that
the Duke had attained; of the vast Number of the Prisoners and sick and
wounded Men, a Charge that had never been computed.</P>
<P>HE told them, “the <HI>French</HI> King had indeed offered his Mediation, and
that if He intended no more than a Mediation, it was an Office very
worthy the most Christian King; He wished, that as a Mediator He
would make equal Propositions, or that He would not so importunately
press his Majesty to consent to those He makes, upon an Instance and Ar∣gument,
<HI>that He holds himself engaged by a former Treaty</HI> (of which his<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Majesty had never heard till since the Beginning of the War, and had
some Reason to have presumed the contrary) <HI>to assist the</HI> Dutch <HI>with Men
and Money if his Majesty would not consent.</HI>”</P>
<P>HE said, “his Majesty had told them, <HI>that He had no Appetite to make
War for War's Sake;</HI> but He would be always ready to make such a
Peace as might be for his Honour and the Interest of his Subjects. And
no Doubt it would be a great Trouble and Grief to his Majesty to find so
great a Prince, towards whom He had manifested so great an Affection,
in Conjunction with his Enemies: Yet even the Apprehension of such a
War would not terrify him to purchase a Peace by such Concessions as<MILESTONE N="50"/>
He should be ashamed to make them acquainted with; of which Nature
They would easily believe the Propositions hitherto made to be, when
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
They knew the Release of <HI>Poleroone</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and the demolish∣ing
the Fort of <HI>Cabo Corso</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> were two; which
would be upon the Matter to be contented with a very vile Trade in the
<HI>East-Indies</HI> under their Control, and with none in <HI>Guinea.</HI> And yet
those are not Propositions unreasonable enough to please the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who
reproached <HI>France</HI> for interposing for Peace, instead of assisting them in
the War, boldly insisting upon the Advantage the Contagion in <HI>London</HI>
and some other Parts of the Kingdom gives them; by which, They con∣fidently
say, the King will be no longer able to maintain a Fleet against
<MILESTONE N="10"/>them at Sea.”</P>
<P>HE told them, “that He had fully obeyed the Command that had been
laid upon him, in making that plain, clear, true Narrative of what had
passed; He had no Order to make Reflection upon it, nor any Deduc∣tion
from it: The King himself had told them, <HI>that the noble, unparalleled
Supply They had already given him is upon the Matter spent,</HI> spent with all the
Animadversions of good Husbandry that the Nature of the Affair would
bear. What was more to be done He left to their own generous Under∣standings,
being not more assured of any Thing that was to come in this
World, than that the same noble Indignation for the Honour of the King
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and the Nation, that first provoked them to inflame the King himself, would
continue the same Passion still boiling in their loyal Breasts; that all the
World may see, which They never hoped to have seen, that never Prince
and People were so entirely united in their Affections, for their true,
joint, inseparable Honour, as their only sure infallible Expedient to pre∣serve
their distinct several Interests.”</P>
<P>THE King could not expect or wish a fuller Concurrence from a Parlia∣ment
than He now found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther Supply grant∣ed.</NOTE> With very little Hesitation They declared, “that
They would supply his Majesty with another Million (ten hundred thou∣sand
Pounds):” And because They desired to be dismissed as soon as
<MILESTONE N="30"/>might be to their several Habitations, not without Apprehension that so
great a Concourse of Persons from all Places, even from <HI>London</HI> itself (for
the Term was likewise adjourned to <HI>Oxford</HI>), might bring the Contagion
thither likewise; They rejected all other Businesses but what immediately
related to the Publick. To the Supply They designed to the King They
added the Sum of above forty thousand Pounds, which They desired his
Majesty to confer upon the Duke, having received some Insinuation, “that
it would not be ingrateful to the King that such a Present should be
made to his Brother.”<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Act for attainting the</HI> English <HI>in the</HI> Dutch <HI>Ser∣vice.</HI></NOTE> Then They passed two or three Acts of Parlia∣ment
very much for the King's Honour and Security, amongst which one
<MILESTONE N="40"/>was, “for the attainting all those his Subjects who either resided in <HI>Holland</HI>”
(as some of the <HI>English</HI> Officers who had long served in that Country pre∣sumed
still to do) “and continued in their Service, or in any other Parts
beyond the Seas, if They did not appear at a Day prefixed, after Notice
by the King's Proclamation:” And the Nomination of the Persons was en∣tirely
left to his Majesty.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty did hope, that this very good Carriage in the Parliament
would have made some Impression upon <HI>France,</HI> either to have given over
their Mediation, or to have drawn reasonable and just Concessions from the
<HI>States:</HI> But it did produce the contrary. The <HI>Hollander</HI> had received a
<MILESTONE N="50"/>new Damage which inflamed them exceedingly, which shall be particularly
mentioned in the next Place, whereupon They made grievous Complaints to
<HI>France</HI> of its Breach of Faith upon the Promises that had been made to
them. That King upon this required his Ambassadours once more to make
<PB N="288" REF="292"/>
a lively Instance to his Majesty, “that He would declare what He meant
to insist upon in Order to a Peace, which if He should refuse to do, They
should take their Leaves and return into <HI>France</HI> with all possible Expedi∣tion.”
In this Audience They spake in a higher Style than They had
formerly used.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Ambassadours remonstrate warmly a∣gainst the</HI> English.</NOTE> They complained “of the intolerable Damage the Subjects
of <HI>France</HI> had sustained in their Goods and Estates by the King's Ships,
and those who were licensed by his Authority, which without any Dis∣tinction
seized upon all that came in their Way as if They were <HI>Dutch:</HI>
And when They complained to the Admiralty or to the Lords Commis∣sioners,
They could procure no Justice, and were obliged to such an At∣tendance<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and Expense, that what They sued for did not prove of Value to
satisfy the Charge of the Prosecution; and if after a long and a tedious So∣licitation
They did at last procure a Sentence for the Redelivery of what
had been taken from them, when They hoped to enjoy the Benefit of
this just Sentence by the Execution, They found the Goods embezzled in
the Port or plundered by the Seamen, that the Owners had rarely a third
Part of their Goods ever restored to them. And that by this Violence
and unjust Proceeding, of which They had often made Complaint, the
<HI>French</HI> Merchants had lost near five hundred thousand <HI>Pistoles;</HI> which
their Master resented and looked upon as a great Indignity to himself,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
which He had hitherto borne, in Hope that the License would have been
restrained by the End of the War.”</P>
<P>THEY urged it as an Argument of their Master's Friendship to the King,
“that after an offensive Treaty had been so long since entered into by him,
by which He was obliged to assist the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Men, Money and
Ships, He had notwithstanding hitherto forborne it, and looked on whilst
They were soundly beaten and had lately sustained another Blow; and
that it was not possible for him to defer it longer:” And so concluded
with very earnest Persuasions, “that his Majesty would consent to such a
Peace as their Master should judge to be reasonable, who could not but<MILESTONE N="30"/>
be very just to his Majesty;” and wished, “that it might be considered,
besides the Damage by the Plague which Nobody knew how long it might
continue, how impossible it was for the King to sustain the Arms of <HI>France</HI>
in Conjunction to those of <HI>Holland,</HI> when possibly some other Prince might
join likewise with them.”</P>
<P>THEY who were appointed by the King to confer with the Ambassadours
were most perplexed to justify their first Charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Conference between them and the</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>Ministers upon their Re∣monstrance.</HI></NOTE> “of the Depredation that
had been made upon the <HI>French</HI> Merchants,” which had in Truth been
very great, though not amounting to the Sum They mentioned. Yet to
that They answered, “that the Damage and Loss which the Subjects of<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>France</HI> had undergone that Way had originally proceeded from themselves,
and their own Default in owning the Goods and Merchandise of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> to belong to themselves as their proper Goods, and in undertaking
to carry and deliver the Wine and other Goods, which were bought and
paid for in <HI>France</HI> by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in <HI>French</HI> Vessels in that Country;
all which had been fully and notoriously proved and could not be con∣tradicted:
And when that Discovery was once made, it was no Won∣der
if the Seamen sometimes seized upon some Vessels which were not
liable to the same Reproach. But when any Complaints of that Kind
had been made, the King had always given strict Charge to the Judges to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
cause Restitution to be made, and the Transgressors to be severely pu∣nished;
and his Majesty presumed that the Judges had done their Duty.
For the <HI>French</HI> King's being bound by his Treaty to assist the <HI>Hollanders,</HI>”
<PB N="289" REF="293"/>
They said, “that if the King had any such Obligation upon him, it was
subsequent to his Obligation to his Majesty, by which He was bound to
make no such Treaty: Nor in Truth did They believe that He had en∣tered
into any such Treaty, for if it were only such as They themselves
stated it to be, a defensive League, it would neither engage nor excuse
<HI>France</HI> in giving Assistance to them who had done the Wrong and begun
the War; and therefore if the King was in Truth bound to assist them,
it must be from some offensive not defensive Clause.”</P>
<P>THE Ambassadours replied, “that their Master concluded that their
<MILESTONE N="10"/>King was the Aggressor, and then the defensive Article did oblige him;”
and They acknowledged there was no other. It was answered, “that the King
had assumed a Power to judge upon a Matter of Fact of which He had
taken no Examination; and that it was a Partiality not agreeable to the
Office of a Judge, to believe what the <HI>Dutch</HI> said, and not to believe
what the King said, who had clearly published the true History of the
Fact; and that it was notorious and not possible to be denied, that They
had refused to deliver <HI>Poleroone</HI> according to their Treaty, and that <HI>De
Ruyter</HI> had begun the War in <HI>Guinea</HI> before one of their Ships had been
seized on by the King.” To which They replied, “that their Master
<MILESTONE N="20"/>thought otherwise, and did look upon the King as Aggressor.” When
They were urged with the Violation of the former Obligation by entering
into the latter, all the Answer They gave was, “that They knew Nothing
of it, and that They had Commission only to treat upon the present
State of Affairs, and not upon what had passed long before:” And so,
according to the Character They underwent near fourteen hundred Years
since, <HI>Galli ridentes fidem fregerunt.</HI></P>
<P>THE Counsellors of the King told them, “that their Master had very
well considered the Disadvantage He must undergo by the Access of so
powerful a Friend, and of whose Friendship He had thought himself pos∣sessed,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to the Part of his Enemies, who were too insolent already; and
therefore to prevent that Disadvantage, He had and would do any Thing
that would consist with the Dignity of a King: But that He must be
laughed at and despised by all the World, if He should consent to make
him the Arbitrator of the Differences who had already declared himself to
be a Party, and <HI>that He is resolved to make War against him on the Be∣half
of his Enemy;</HI> and that such Menaces would make no Impression in
the last Article of Danger that could befall the King.” The Ambassa∣dours
took that Expression of Menaces very heavily, as if it were a Tax upon
their Manners, and said “They had never used Words that could imply a
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Menace.” To which it was replied, “that there was no Purpose to make
any Reflection upon their Persons, who had always carried themselves with
great Respect to the King, and who his Majesty believed did in their own
particular Affection wish him better than They did the <HI>Dutch:</HI> However
the declaring, <HI>that if the King did not do this or that, the</HI> French <HI>King
would make War upon him,</HI> could in no Language be looked upon to have
any other Signification than of a Menace and Threat.” This raised a little
Warmth on Both Sides, which made the Conference break off at that Time.</P>
<P>THE Ambassadours prepared to be gone; and the King discerned clearly
that there was no Way to divert the <HI>French</HI> from an entire Conjunction
<MILESTONE N="50"/>with the <HI>Dutch:</HI> And thereupon He assembled his secret Council together
again, to consult what should be the final Answer his Majesty should give
to the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours at parting. There was no Person present, who
had not a deep Apprehension of the extreme Damage and Danger that
<PB N="290" REF="294"/>
must fall upon the King's Affairs, if in this Conjuncture <HI>France</HI> should de∣clare
a War against <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IT was well known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prospect of the King's Affairs at this Time.</NOTE> that the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was forthwith to be at <HI>Brest,</HI>
where all the <HI>French</HI> King's Ships were to assemble at their Rendezvous by
<HI>Christmas;</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> King had already sent to the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI>
to dissuade him from prosecuting his Enterprise against <HI>Holland,</HI> and that
probably He might unite <HI>Denmark</HI> again to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and probably even
allay those warm Inclinations which the <HI>Swede</HI> had for the King. It was
well known, that the <HI>French</HI> King had in the last Distractions in <HI>Holland</HI>
contributed very much to the composing them, and to the Support of the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Power and Credit of <HI>De Wit,</HI> who was the Soul of the War, and that He
had sent him one hundred thousand <HI>Pistoles,</HI> without which They would
have hardly been able to have set out their last Fleet under <HI>De Ruyter.</HI>
And above all this, his giving Life to some domestick Rebellion in <HI>England</HI>
and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by sending Money to discontented Persons, was apprehended:
For as there were enough discontented and desperate Persons in the latter, who
wanted only Arms and Money to declare for any Prince who would take
them into his Protection; so it was well known that there was a general
Combination amongst those of the late Army to have risen, if the Duke of
<HI>York</HI> had been defeated at Sea, and that it was that Victory that disap∣pointed<MILESTONE N="20"/>
that intended Insurrection. That there had been a later Design, in
the very Height of this dismal Sickness and Contagion, in <HI>London</HI> (whither
the Fanatick Party had repaired from all the Quarters of the Kingdom, and
had appointed a Day upon which the General should be assassinated, which
some Soldiers of his own Regiment had undertaken, and then the whole
Rendezvous was to be in several Streets at the same Time); which in so for∣midable
a Conjuncture might have succeeded to a great Degree, if by God's
Blessing it had not been discovered two Days before to the General, who
caused some of the chief Conspirators to be apprehended, who suffered after∣wards
by the Hand of Justice. And yet the Chief amongst them, Colonel<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Danvers,</HI> who in Spite of all the Vigilance that could be used had been al∣ways
searched for and always concealed from the Time of the King's Re∣turn,
being at this Time apprehended and brought before the General, and
by him sent with a Lieutenant and a Guard of Soldiers to the <HI>Tower,</HI> was
rescued in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and so escaped, all the Citizens looking on without
aiding the Officer.</P>
<P>THIS was the Prospect that the King had of his Condition and Affairs in
this Consultation: And therefore if any Thing could have occurred that
might probably have diverted this Storm, it would no Doubt have been em∣braced.
But then the exceeding Breach of Faith in entering into that<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Treaty, the denying it afterwards, and concealing his Engagement by it so
long after the War was entered into (which if He had not done the King
could never have looked upon him as a fit Mediator), and the Impossibility
of depending upon any Thing that should be promised for the future, were
convincing Arguments against any such Reference of the Conditions to his
Determination as was proposed, and was the only Expedient that was pro∣posed
towards the making a Peace. It was well known that the chief Counsels
of <HI>France,</HI> since <HI>Monsieur Colbert</HI> entered upon the Ministry, had been di∣rected
towards the Advancement of Manufactures at Home, by which They
might have less Need of Commerce with their Neighbours; and for the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
erecting a Trade abroad, with which They had been very little acquainted
in former Times. And it was justly to be feared, that where the Judgment
was left to them, They would imitate the infamous <HI>Roman</HI> Precedent, of
<PB N="291" REF="295"/>
adjudging that to themselves that was in Difference between their Neigh∣bours
and left to their Decision: And so both <HI>Poleroone</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
and <HI>Cabo Corso</HI> for the <HI>West,</HI> must be determined to belong to them; which
might be the rather apprehended, by their having erected an <HI>East-India</HI>
Company and a <HI>West-India</HI> Company, before They had any visible Founda∣tion
for a Trade in either, to which Both these Places might carry with
them great Conveniences.</P>
<P>THESE Considerations being seriously reflected upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A final An∣swer given to the</HI> French <HI>Ambassadours.</HI></NOTE> with a little gene∣rous
Indignation to find himself thus treated, prevailed with the King to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>lay aside all Thoughts of farther complying with <HI>France,</HI> and to resolve to
dismiss the Ambassadours without any other Answer, than what should con∣tain
Complaints “of the <HI>French</HI> King's Want of Kindness, which his Ma∣jesty
had cultivated by all the Offices He could perform since his Resto∣ration,
which did not receive an equal Return, by the preferring the
Friendship of the <HI>Dutch</HI> before that of his Majesty.” And with this An∣swer
the Ambassadours were dismissed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They leave the Kingdom.</NOTE> with liberal Presents and all gracious
Demonstrations of Esteem of their Persons, and so returned for <HI>France,</HI>
where They always gave just Testimony of the Civilities and fair Treatment
They had received.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>BUT this Resolution increased the King's Appetite to Peace, and made
him think of all other Expedients that might contribute to it; and none
seemed so hopeful, as that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> might be divided: And He
would have been very willing to have agreed with <HI>Holland</HI> upon any reason∣able
Conditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Prospect of dividing</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Holland.</NOTE> that He might continue the War with <HI>France,</HI> which there
were many reasonable Inducements to hope might be brought to pass. It
was notorious, that Preparations had been made for two or three Years past
by <HI>France</HI> at a very great Expense upon the Borders, that They might
be ready to enter into <HI>Flanders</HI> as soon as News should arrive of the King
of <HI>Spain's</HI> Death; and that War would immediately fall out as soon as that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>King's Decease should be known, which from his Age and Infirmities must
be expected every Day: And in that Case the Friendship could not continue
long with <HI>Holland,</HI> which thought that <HI>France</HI> was already too near a
Neighbour to them, to be willing that They should be nearer by a Con∣quest
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which with its own Force could not make an equal Re∣sistance.
It was likewise as notorious that all the other Provinces, <HI>Holland</HI>
only excepted, did impatiently desire the Peace; and <HI>Holland</HI> had only been
restained from the same Impatience by the sole Credit and Authority of <HI>De
Wit,</HI> and by his persuading them, “that <HI>France</HI> would assist them with
Men, Money and Ships, and likewise declare a War against <HI>England,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>which” (as hath been said before) “would produce a Peace upon such
Conditions as would make it happy to them:” And that though it was
true that it had indeed assisted them with some Money, it was not considerable
to their vast Expenses, nor in Truth of Importance in Comparison of the
other, which it was equally obliged to do, and had performed Nothing.
And it was evident that <HI>Holland</HI> itself was jealous of those Proceedings, and
even <HI>De Wit</HI> in his private Discourses to other Ministers seemed to be
much unsatisfied with their Breach of Faith, and not to be without Appre∣hension
that They would in the End enter into a stricter Alliance with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and leave <HI>Holland</HI> as a Prey to Both.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>THE <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour, who always desired that the Peace might be
established between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that They would Both
join with <HI>Spain</HI> in a defensive League, into which <HI>Denmark</HI> would be glad
to enter, and <HI>Sweden</HI> might be drawn in upon the same Conditions which
<PB N="292" REF="296"/>
They now received from <HI>France,</HI> towards which He had often desired the King
to interpose, was now very glad that the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours had taken their
Leaves and were gone; and He pretended to have many Assurances from
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had those Incli∣nations
which are mentioned before, “and that <HI>De Wit</HI> would be glad to
confer in private with any Man trusted by the King, if He might be sure
that it should not be communicated to <HI>France.</HI>” Upon all these Proba∣bilities,
and the Certainty that no Good could be expected from <HI>France,</HI> his
Majesty resolved to embrace all Opportunities to agree with <HI>Holland;</HI> to∣wards
which He had a secret Intelligence, to which He gave more Credit<MILESTONE N="10"/>
than to all the rest, which shall be mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>THERE were so many great Transactions during the King's Residence in
<HI>Oxford,</HI> besides what was done in the Parliament and what related to the
Dismission of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours, so many Counsels which were exe∣cuted,
and so many secret Designs only initiated then and not executed till
long after, that there cannot be too particular a Recollection of the Occur∣rences
of all that Time. And if some Things are mentioned which seem too
light and of too small Importance to have a Place in this Relation, they
will be found at last to be the Rise and principal Ingredient to some Counsel
and Resolution, which proved afterwards of Consequence enough as well to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the Publick as to the Interest of particular Persons.</P>
<P>THE first Attempt that was made was to make a Breach between the
Chancellor and the Treasurer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to break the Friendship be∣tween the Chancellor and Treasurer.</NOTE> who had been long fast Friends, and were
believed to have most Credit with the King; and They who loved neither
of them thought the most likely Way to hurt them was to make them love
one another less. Several Attempts had been made upon the Chancellor to
that Purpose without Effect: He knew the other too well to be shaken in
the Esteem He had of his Friendship, and the Knowledge He had of
his Virtue.</P>
<P>BUT there was now an Accident fell out, that gave them an Opportunity<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to suggest to the Treasurer, “that the Chancellor had failed in his Friend∣ship
towards him.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occasion of it.</NOTE> The Occasion was upon the Vacancy of an Office
near the Queen by the Death of Mr. <HI>Mountague,</HI> Master of the Horse to
her Majesty, who had been killed before <HI>Bergen:</HI> And the News arriving
with the Duke at <HI>York,</HI> before it was known at <HI>Salisbury</HI> to the King, the
Duke and his Wife writ to the King and to the Queen “to confer that
Place upon his younger Brother,” who was now become both the eldest
and the only Son to his Father, the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton;</HI> and the
Gentleman himself, on whose Behalf the Letters were writ, came himself
by Post with them within two or three Hours after the News was brought to <HI>Sa∣lisbury,</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
and He brought likewise a Letter from the Dutchess to the Chan∣cellor,
“to assist the Gentleman all He could in his Pretence,” He at the
same Time enjoying the same Office under the Dutchess that his Brother had
under the Queen.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor had never used to interpose in Matters of that Nature,
nor had He any Acquaintance with this Gentleman who was now recom∣mended:
Yet He could not refuse to wait upon the Queen and shew her
the Letter He had received, without any Intention to appear farther in it.
But when He waited upon the Queen, who had received her Letter before,
her Majesty seemed graciously disposed to gratify the Gentleman if the King<MILESTONE N="50"/>
approved it, but said “that She would make no Choice herself of any
Servant without knowing first his Majesty's Pleasure:” And She added,
that She had been informed, <HI>that the Lord</HI> Mountague <HI>was very angry
<PB N="293" REF="297"/>
with his Son that was unfortunately slain, for having taken that Charge in
her Family, and that He never allowed him any Thing towards his Sup∣port;</HI>
and if all other Obstructions were out of the Way, She would not
receive him except She were first assured that his Father would like and
desire it.” Her Majesty vouchsafed to wish the Chancellor “to speak with
the King, and as dexterously as He could to dispose him to recommend
Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> to her, as just and reasonable since his Brother had lost
his Life in his Service.”</P>
<P>THIS Command of her Majesty obliged the Chancellor to wait upon the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>King, and to shew him the Letter He had received from the Dutchess; and
at the same Time the King gave him that which He had from the Duke,
in which his Highness desired him, “that if that Place was not presently
conferred upon Mr. <HI>Mountague,</HI> his Majesty would not dispose of it till
He waited upon him.” The Chancellor told him, “that the Queen gave
no Answer, but referred it entirely to his Majesty:” And He said, “He
would never recommend any Person to her but such a one as would be
very grateful to her.” He said, “it would seem very hard to deny one
Brother to succeed another who was killed in his Service.” He confessed,
that the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> had moved him on the Behalf of Mr. <HI>Robert Spen∣cer,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of whom He had a good Opinion: But that He had answered him,
that He would not do any Thing in it till He saw his <HI>Brother;</HI> which Re∣solution
He would keep.” To which the Chancellor made no Reply,
having in his own private Inclinations and Affection much more Kindness
for Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> of whose Pretence He had never received the least Inti∣mation
before, than for the other, with whom He had spoken very few
Words in his Life. He told Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> no more but that which the
King himself had told him, <HI>“that He would not dispose of the Place till the
Duke should arrive;”</HI> only He added what the Queen had said of his Fa∣ther,
and advised him to think of the Way to remove that Obstruction.
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Whereupon He resolved to make a Journey to his Father, which He knew
He might well do before the King and his Brother could meet.</P>
<P>THE same Night Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> came to the Chancellor, and brought him
a Letter from the Treasurer (whose Nephew He was, and who was unfor∣tunately
gone out of the Town the Day before to a House of his own twenty
Miles distant) to recommend his Nephew to the Queen, to whom and to
the King He had likewise Letters. The Chancellor gave him an Account
of all that had passed, shewed him the Letter that He had received from the
Dutchess, and told him what the Queen and the King had said, and “that
it was not possible for him to do him Service, for which He was very sorry;”
<MILESTONE N="40"/>but advised him “to deliver Both his Letters, and to attend their Majesties,
who He was confident had yet taken no Resolution:” With all which He
was very well satisfied, and confessed “He could not expect that He should
appear for him.” When He delivered his Letters to Both their Majesties,
He received so gracious an Answer from Both, that He might reasonably
expect his Suit to be granted, though the King told him, “He would not
dispose of the Place till He spake with his Brother.” And there is no
Doubt but if the Lord Treasurer had been in the Town when the News
first came to the King of Mr. <HI>Mountague's</HI> Death, which was a whole Day
before the Arrival of the Duke's Letter, the King or Queen would not
<MILESTONE N="50"/>have denied him his Request.</P>
<P>WITHIN a short Time after Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> had left him, the Lord <HI>Crofts,</HI>
who had married his Sister, and was governed by the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> came
to the Chancellor, and desired him “to take Care, out of his Friendship
<PB N="294" REF="298"/>
with the Treasurer, that the King might not refuse to gratify him in this
Suit for his Nephew, which was the first He had ever made, and if He
should be denied it would exceedingly trouble him. That when He spake
to the King of it as soon as the News came, and told him, <HI>He was sure
that the Treasurer would be a Suitor to him for his Nephew,</HI> his Majesty
did promise him that He should have it; and that Both their Majesties had
as good as said the same now to <HI>Robert Spencer:</HI> And therefore if He
would now use his Credit, the Thing might be dispatched presently and
without farther Delay.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor asked him, “whether Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> had informed him of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
all that had passed between them two:” He said, “Yes; and that He had
done all that the Dutchess had desired him, in speaking both to the King
and Queen, and that his Friendship to the Lord Treasurer should pre∣vail
with him to use all his Endeavours for his Nephew.” Whereupon
the Chancellor shewed the Dutchess's Letter, and repeated to him again
all that He had formerly said to Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> and asked him, “what the
Duke and his Wife must think of him, if instead of pursuing what They
desired, He should solicit quite contrary to it.” He said, “that He might
tell them that He was engaged by the Lord Treasurer before He received
their Letter;” and then talked passionately and indiscreetly “of the Af∣front<MILESTONE N="20"/>
the Treasurer would think He received if this were denied him, and
that all the World would say, that He might have compassed it if He
had not failed in his Friendship.” To which He made no other Answer,
than “that the doing so base a Thing as He desired would more probably de∣stroy
that Friendship with a Man so punctual in Honour and Justice as the
Treasurer was, than any Thing that He had done or should leave undone;”
and advised him “not to make the Business worse by his Activity, and that
if He had the King's and Queen's Promise, as He pretended, He might very
well acquiesce till the Duke came.”</P>
<P>HOWEVER his very great Indiscretion and Presumption made the Thing<MILESTONE N="30"/>
much worse, by delivering Messages from the King to the Queen and
from her Majesty to the King that They Both disavowed, and by his
usual Discourses, “that it should now appear who had the most Credit
with the King, the Duke or the Treasurer, and how much the King
would suffer if He disobliged the Treasurer;” all which was quickly
transmitted by the Intelligence that was every Day sent to <HI>York.</HI> On the
other Hand He still advised the Treasurer “to continue his Importunity to
the King and Queen” (a Thing the most contrary to his Nature), and
assured him, “that it would be grateful to them and was expected by
them.” Whereupon as soon as the Treasurer came to the Court, which<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was not till the King came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> He went to Both their Majesties,
and renewed his Suit to them with more Warmth and Concernment than
was customary to him, and received such an Answer from Both as very well
satisfied him: And without Doubt the King intended to persuade his Bro∣ther
to desist from pressing him father on the Behalf of the other, for whom
He had no Kindness.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke, who arrived by Post the very next Day, came in another
Temper than was expected. The Intelligence from <HI>Salisbury</HI> of the Con∣test
that was for that Place, and the insolent Behaviour and Expressions
used by the Lord <HI>Crofts,</HI> had exceedingly moved him, and He looked<MILESTONE N="50"/>
upon the Treasurer as engaged to try who had the greatest Power, and as
in Opposition to him: So that the same Night that He came to Town,
when the King and He were in private, He complained of it with much
<PB N="295" REF="299"/>
Warmth; and He besought his Majesty importunately “that He would de∣clare,
that the World might know who had most Interest in his Favour,
He or the Treasurer.” The King was so much put out of the Method
He intended to use in this Affair, knowing that the Expressions the Duke
had mentioned had been too often used by the Lord <HI>Crofts,</HI> for which
He had often reprehended him, that He presently applied that Remedy
which He thought most proper, and after Conference with the Queen signed
the Warrant for admitting Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> into the Office, who was sworn
the next Morning: So that the first News the Treasurer heard, after Both
<MILESTONE N="10"/>their Majesties had the Day before said all to him that He could desire,
was, that the Place was already full; which He received with more Com∣motion
than was natural to him, and looked upon it as a designed, con∣trived
Affront to expose him to Contempt. “Why would not the King,
if He had changed his Mind after He left him, first send him Word of it,
that He might have known his Purpose?”</P>
<P>ALL this Storm fell presently upon the Chancellor: The Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> as∣sured
him, “that it had been done at <HI>Salisbury</HI> if He had not hindered it;
that He had been with the Duke before He spake with the King, and
given him Advice what Tune He should speak in, which was used ac∣cordingly
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and had prevailed; and that when He came into the Duke's
Chamber to kiss his Hand, his Highness turned away and would not
speak to him, which must proceed from the Influence of the Chan∣cellor.”
Whereas in Truth the Chancellor had only seen the Duke
in publick, and said no more to him than what He said in publick,
thinking it no good Manners to trouble him with any private Discourse,
when He was so weary of his Journey; nor did He know that any Thing
was done in that Affair till the Day after it was done, and after it was
known to the Treasurer. Upon the whole Matter, how unwilling soever
He was to believe that He could be so grossly faulty to him, when He
<MILESTONE N="30"/>saw the Chancellor next his Countenance was not the same it used to be;
which the other taking Notice of asked him, according to his usual Fami∣liarity,
“what the Matter was,” but received such an Answer as made him
discern that there was Somewhat amiss: And so He said no more. The
other being the same Day with the King, the Duke came into the Room,
and in his Looks manifested a Displeasure towards the Treasurer, which
confirmed the former Jealousy of the Chancellor; which was improved by
the Ladies, who did not like their Lodging, and thought it proceeded from
Want of Friendship in him, who had the Power over the University, and
might have assigned what Lodgings He pleased to the Treasurer; and He
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had assigned this, as the best House in the Town for so great a Family, and
which their own Servant had desired as the best in the Town, as it was.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor discovered the Ground of this Alteration, He grew
out of Humour too, and thought himself unworthily suspected: And so for
two or three Days the two Friends came not together. And in that Time
the Chancellor had enough to do to inform the Duke, who was not only
very much offended with the Treasurer, but thought that He had been,
out of his Friendship to the Treasurer, more remiss than He ought to have
been in a Business so earnestly recommended by him and his Wife; and the
Intelligence from <HI>Salisbury</HI> had made Reflections upon him as much as upon
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the other. But his Royal Highness willingly received Information of all that
had passed, and discerned the foul Carriage of others as well as of the Lord
<HI>Crofts;</HI> and was pleased to confess, “that He had done all He ought to do,
“and that He had been misinformed of the Lord Treasurer's Part in that Affair,
<PB N="296" REF="300"/>
which had made him think amiss of him, which He would acknowledge
to him next Time He saw him.”</P>
<P>AFTER this the Chancellor, having a more clear View, upon Conference
with the King-and the Duke, of this pernicious Design, which in some De∣gree
had compassed its End if there grew a Strangeness between the Trea∣surer
and him, went to him: And They being together without any others,
He told him, “it should not be in his Power to break Friendship with him to
gratify the Humour of other People, without letting him know what the
Matter was,” which He conjured him to impart to him; assuring him,
that He would find that Nothing was more impossible than that He could<MILESTONE N="10"/>
commit a Fault towards him, and that They who wished well to neither
of them had contrived this Separation as the best Way to hurt them Both.”
And when He saw that He did not yet open himself, He told him, “that
He had heard that He had received some Umbrage in the Pretence of his
Nephew, and therefore He would give him an Account of all that He
knew of it,” which He did exactly; and concluded with a Protestation,
that He had not known what had been done at <HI>Oxford</HI> till after He
came from him, when He observed the Change of his Countenance to∣wards
him, of the Cause of which He could not then make any Con∣jecture.”<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE Treasurer thereupon with his usual Freedom told him, “that if his
Part had been no other than as He related, He thought himself obliged
to give him a Narration of all He had done, and of the Grounds and
Motives He had to think that He had failed in his Friendship.” And
thereupon He mentioned “the Kindness and Esteem He had for his Nephew,
whom He thought in all Respects of Birth and Breeding at least as worthy
of that Relation as the Gentleman who was possessed of it; and yet that
since He was not upon the Place, He had no Mind to engage himself in
the Suit: And that when his Nephew had given him an Account what the
Chancellor had said to him,” which He did with great Ingenuity, “and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He knew that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> appeared in it for another, He resolved
to prosecute it no farther; until the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> with all Confidence as∣sured
him, <HI>that the King had promised him to confer the Place upon</HI> Robert
Spencer, <HI>and that Both their Majesties expected that He should make it his
Suit, to the End that They might thereby decline the Importunity that He
expected from his Brother.”</HI> He told him of some Expressions He had
used to the King in that Affair, which the King himself had reported; and
that when He took his Leave of the Queen to go to <HI>Oxford</HI>” (which was
the next Day after Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> came from <HI>York</HI>), “He dissuaded her
Majesty from receiving Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> alleging some Reasons against it,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
which a Lady who was near overheard, and informed the Person of it who
acquainted him with it: All which, with the King's and Queen's so ample
Promises to him so few Hours before the conferring the Place upon ano∣ther,
and the Duke of <HI>York's</HI> Manner of receiving him after He had
been shut up with him, as He was informed, might very well excuse
him for thinking He had some Share in the Affront He had undergone.”</P>
<P>To which the other replied, “that if indeed He did believe all that He
had been told, He could not but think so; but,” He said, “He thought
He had known him better than to give Credit to such Reports, which
must make him a Fool and a Knave: That for the Words He should<MILESTONE N="50"/>
have used to the King or the Queen, there had Nothing passed like it to
either of them, but that they were purely devised out of Malice; which
should be manifest unto him, for He would not speak a Word of it to
<PB N="297" REF="301"/>
the King till They were Both with him together, and then He would ask
before him what his Carriage had been, and by his Majesty's sudden An∣swer
He might judge of the Report.” He told him then, “how much
He had suffered with the Duke, and what excellent Stories had been made
to his Royal Highness of Both of them, and of the good Part the Lord
<HI>Crofts</HI> had acted, of which He was not without some Evidence.” After
this <HI>Eclaircissement,</HI> of the Sincerity whereof every Day administered new Testi∣mony,
They Both returned to their mutual Confidence in each other: And
They who had contrived this former Device entered into a new Confederacy,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>how They might first remove the Treasurer, which would facilitate the
pulling the Chancellor down; of which anon.</P>
<P>WITHIN a short Time after the Duke returned out of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke consults the Chancellor about making two Suits to the King.</NOTE> his
Highness told the Chancellor in Confidence, “that He had two Suits which
He intended to make to the King, and with which He first acquainted him
that He might have his Assistance in the obtaining them. The first was,
in which He and his Wife were equally engaged, to prevail with the
King to make Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> a Viscount.” He said, “He knew well
the Resolution the King had taken, to which He had contributed his Ad∣vice,
to make no more Lords: But that He hoped in this particular Case
<MILESTONE N="20"/>his Majesty would upon his Desire dispense with a general Rule. That
Sir <HI>George</HI> had one of the best Fortunes of any Man in <HI>England,</HI> and
lived the most like a great Man; that He had been very civil to him and
his Wife in the <HI>North,</HI> and treated them at his House in a very spendid
Manner; and that He was engaged to prevail with the King in this
Point, or to confess He had no Power, which He hoped He should not
be without in this Matter;” and asked his Opinion.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor in his usual Freedom, which He always took when
He was to deliver his Advice to the King or Duke, said “that He could
not advise his Highness to move the King in it; for besides that He
<MILESTONE N="30"/>knew the King's positive Determination, the Departure from which might
be of ill Consequence, Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> was a Man of a very ill Repu∣tation
amongst Men of Piety and Religion, and was looked upon as void
of all Sense of Religion, even to the doubting if not denying that there
is a God, and that He was not reserved in any Company to publish his
Opinions: Which made him believe that it would neither be for his
Highness's Honour to propose it, nor for the King's to grant it, in a Time
when all License in Discourse and in Actions was spread over the King∣dom,
to the Heart-breaking of very many good Men, who had terrible
Apprehensions of the Consequence of it.” The Duke was not at all
<MILESTONE N="40"/>pleased with his Discourse, and said, “He was resolved to use all his Cre∣dit
with the King to compass it, and that He hoped that whatever He
thought He would not oppose it.”</P>
<P>THE other Particular was, “that He would move the King to make
Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> his Secretary a Privy Counsellor,” and asked him “what He
thought of that.” To which He answered, “that his Opinion in that
Point would please him no better than in the former. That He did not
think it fit to be asked: And if the King his Brother were inclined
to be jealous of him, as some had endeavoured to persuade him, such an
Instance as this would very much confirm it; for never any Prince of
<MILESTONE N="50"/><HI>Wales</HI> had a Servant of the highest Degree about him called to the Coun∣cil,
till his Father called the Earl of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who was the Prince's Go∣vernour,
to the Board, which was not till upon the Approach of the Trou∣bles
He discerned that He should employ him in another Charge. That the
<PB N="298" REF="302"/>
Members of that Board had been always those great Officers of State,
and other Officers, who in Respect of the Places They held had a Title
to sit there, and of such few others who, having great Titles and For∣tunes
and Interest in the Kingdom, were an Ornament to the Table.
That there were at present too many already, and the Number lessened
the Dignity of the Relation: That his Highness had already brought the
Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> thither, who had no Manner of Title to be there but his De∣pendance
upon him; and now to bring in his Secretary, for no other Reason
but for being his Secretary, might be thought an Encroachment, and be
misinterpreted by the King.” He added, “that his wrangling, litigious Na∣ture<MILESTONE N="10"/>
would give the Board much Trouble; and that He knew him to be
so much his particular Enemy, that He would watch all the Opportunities
to do him all possible ill Offices to the King and to his Royal Highness.”</P>
<P>THE Duke replied only to the last, and said, “He perceived Somebody
had done <HI>Will. Coventry</HI> ill Offices, which He knew to be unjust and
false: And that He could assure him upon his own Knowledge, that He
had a great Respect for him, and desired his Favour; and that He would
pass his Word for him, that He would never do any Thing to disserve
him, which if He should do He should for ever lose his Favour, which
He knew well.” And no Doubt the Duke did believe all He said, for<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He had a perfect Kindness for the Chancellor; and when He did not com∣ply
with what He wished, He knew that it was out of the Integrity of his
Judgment, and his strict Duty to the King and himself, and that He had
never flattered or dissembled with either of them. And Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had
Skill enough to persuade him to believe what He desired should be true,
though there were in the View of all Men frequent Instances of the con∣trary,
and of the Absence of all Ingenuity and Sincerity in his Actions.</P>
<P>WITHIN very few Days after this Conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke moves the King to make Sir</HI> George Sa∣vile <HI>a Vis∣count.</HI></NOTE> and when the Dutchess
had made new Instance with her Father in the Case of Sir <HI>George Savile,</HI>
and with more Importunity than the Duke, and appeared more concerned<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and troubled that He should not be more forward to comply with the
Duke's Desires (but the Chancellor, who always with the Respect that was
due to her Quality preserved the Dignity of a Father very entire, would
give no other Answer than He had done to the Duke, and advised her to
dissuade him from making the Request to the King); his Highness one
Day desired the King that He would retire into his Closet, and call the
Chancellor to him: And when They three were together in the Room,
after a short Discourse of Letters which He had received from the Earl of
<HI>Sandwich,</HI> which there will be Occasion anon to mention at large, the
Duke told the King, “He had an humble Suit to his Majesty;” and then<MILESTONE N="40"/>
spake much of the great Interest that Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> had in the Northern
Parts, of the Greatness of his Estate, and his orderly and splendid Way of
Living, and concluded with his Desire “that his Majesty would make him
an <HI>English</HI> Viscount.” Upon which the King presently put him in Mind
of the Resolution He had formerly made in that Room, and He thought
upon his own Motion, but He was sure it had been with his Concur∣rence
and Approbation.”</P>
<P>THE Duke replied, “that He remembered it very well, and thought He
should do well still in the general to observe it: Yet it was in those Cases
always supposed, that an extraordinary Case might fall out, that might<MILESTONE N="50"/>
produce an Exception; and He did most humbly beseech his Majesty,
that He would upon his very earnest Interposition, from which Nobody
could make a Precedent, dispense with the Rule.” He did consess, “that
<PB N="299" REF="303"/>
He was so confident of his Majesty's Favour, that He had given Sir
<HI>George Savile</HI> Cause to believe that He would prevail in that Suit; which
if He should not do, He must be thought either not to have intended
what He promised, or to have no Credit with his Majesty, neither of
which would be for his Honour.”</P>
<P>THE King replied roundly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the King will not consent to.</NOTE> and with more Presence of Mind than He had
always about him, “that it was absolutely necessary to be very precise in the
Observation of the Rule, which if He should once break, a World of In∣conveniences
would break in upon him, which He could not defend
<MILESTONE N="10"/>himself against.” He named two or three Persons who were very soli∣citous
for Honours, and had several Pretences to it; and his Majesty had
only been able to resist and evade their Importunity, by objecting this de∣clared
Resolution to them. The plain Truth is; He had made some Pro∣mise
(a Weakness He was too often liable to) to those Persons or to their
Friends, “that when He should make any new Creations They should be
sure to be in the Number:” Nor did He apprehend any Inconvenience
from redeeming himself from the present Importunity, which was still
grievous to him, since He had resolved to make no new Creation. And
this was the true Reason that made him now so inexorable to his Brother,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>who was very much troubled, and declined to move any Thing else in so
unlucky a Season, not without some Apprehension, from the King's quicker
Way of Discourse, that He had been prepared for it by the Chancellor, who
though present had not spoke one Word in the Debate, nor indeed ever in∣formed
the King of the Conference his Highness had formerly held with
him upon that Subject, nor ever spoken to him concerning it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER in this Perplexity as the Duke thought it necessary to inform
Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had principally advanced this Pretence, all that had
passed before the King, that his Nephew (for so Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> was) might
see He could make no farther Progress in it; so in the Passion He un∣warily
<MILESTONE N="30"/>told him all that had passed in the former Conference with the
Chancellor, which He took Care should not be concealed from any who
were like to be willing to revenge it. And the Duke, to shew how wil∣ling
He was to oblige the Family, immediately received a younger Brother
of Sir <HI>George Savile,</HI> whom He had only seen in the <HI>North,</HI> to wait upon
him in his Bedchamber; who being a young Man of Wit, and incredible
Confidence and Presumption, omitted no Occasion to vent his Malice
against the Chancellor, with a License that in former Times would have
been very penal, though it had concerned a Person of a much inferiour
Quality in the State.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>WITHIN a short Time after, the King told the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> William Coventry <HI>ad∣mitted of the Privy Council and the pri∣vate Commit∣tee.</HI></NOTE> “that his
Brother had desired him that his Secretary Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> might be ad∣mitted
of the Privy Council, which He could not deny, but had pro∣mised
it should be done at the next Meeting;” which was accordingly
done, and He knighted: And quickly after, upon the like Desire of the
Duke, He was called to that Committee with which his Majesty used to
consult his most secret Affairs. And from this Time there was an Alteration
in the whole Carriage and Debate of all Manner of Business: And as the
Chancellor had found his own Credit with the King much diminished from
the Time of the Lord <HI>Arlington's</HI> being Secretary; so a greater Decrease of
<MILESTONE N="50"/>it was now visible to all Men from the Access of this new Counsellor.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had not the Gift of speaking nor of a quick Concep∣tion,
and so rarely contradicted any Thing in Council: His Talent was in
private, where He frequently procured, very inconveniently, Changes and
<PB N="300" REF="304"/>
Alterations from publick Determinations. But Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> (be∣tween
whom and the other there was an entire Conjunction and Combina∣tion)
was a Man of quick Parts and a ready Speaker, unrestrained by any
Modesty or Submission to the Age, Experience or Dignity of other Men,
equally censorious of what had been done before He was a Counsellor, as
solicitous in Contradiction of whatsoever was proposed afterwards: Insomuch
as the very first Time that He was admitted to the private Committee, the
Debate being about providing Money to be paid at a Day approaching to
the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> according to the King's Obligation, He said, “We
had Need enough of Money for our own immediate Occasions; and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
that We ought not to assign any to the Advancement of the Affairs of
other Men.” Whereupon He was informed “of the Treaty the King
had entered into, and that the Bishop was at that Time upon his March,
which was by every Body looked upon as of great Importance to his Ma∣jesty:”
To which He answered, “that He had heard Somewhat of it how
secretly soever it had been carried, and that He had never liked it from
the Beginning, nor would give his Consent that any more Money should
be paid towards it;” which the King himself looked upon as a rare
Impudence.</P>
<P>HIS great Ambition was to be taken Notice of for opposing and con∣tradicting<MILESTONE N="20"/>
whatsoever was proposed or said by the Chancellor or Treasurer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He constantly op∣poses the Chan∣cellor and Treasurer.</NOTE>
towards whom all other Counsellors, how little soever They cared for their
Persons, had ever paid Respect in Regard of their Offices. He was a de∣clared
Enemy to all Lawyers, and to the Law itself; and any Thing passed
under the great Seal of <HI>England</HI> was of no more Authority with him, than
if it were the Scroll of a Scrivener. He had no Principles in Religion or
State, of one Mind this Day and another To-morrow, and always very un∣easy
to those who were obliged to consult with him; whose Pride and In∣solence
will administer frequent Occasions of Mention throughout the en∣suing
Relation.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE King had not been many Days in <HI>Oxford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Success of the Fleet after the Attempt at</HI> Bergen.</NOTE> when News arrived that
the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> had been engaged in some Conflict with the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet; of the Particulars whereof there was a general Longing to be adver∣tised.
The Truth was, that whilst the Earl rode, after the Business of
<HI>Bergen,</HI> as near that Coast as was safe, in Expectation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet,
the Winds, which are always tempestuous in that Season of the Year, <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
made it absolutely necessary for him to remove with his whole Fleet
to the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where there were Harbours enough for him to
ride safe; and in this Interval of Time <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was passed by towards
that of <HI>Norway.</HI> The News of their <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet having been attacked by<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Bergen,</HI> and the Letters of some of their Officers, which
implied as if They were not satisfied in the Security of the Port and of the
Fidelity of the Governour, produced a wonderful Consternation in <HI>Holland;</HI>
and if They should be deprived of that Wealth, the very Company of the
<HI>East-Indies</HI> would be in Danger of being dissolved.</P>
<P>THE Fleet was ready to set Sail under the Command of <HI>De Ruyter</HI> well
fitted and manned: But there were still many Factions amongst the Cap∣tains
and other Officers, that might upon any Accidents produce many Mis∣chiefs;
for the better Prevention whereof, the Pensionary <HI>De Wit</HI> was wil∣ling
to venture his own Person, believing himself to be as secure any<MILESTONE N="50"/>
where as on Shore, if any Misfortune should befall the Fleet. And so He
was by a special Commission made Plenipotentiary, with an ample Allow∣ance
for his Table, and a Guard of Halberdiers for the Safety of his Per∣son,
<PB N="301" REF="305"/>
with a good Train of Volunteers: And so He put himself on Board the
Ship of <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> who received Orders from him.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Sand∣wich <HI>not able to come to an Engagement with</HI> De Ruyter.</NOTE> after He had received Advertisements of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet's being passed by for <HI>Norway,</HI> took all the Care He could to
put himself and his Fleet in the Way of their Return. They made a short
Stay on the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI> where upon good Consideration their Ships
were dismissed, and loud Clamour raised against the Hostility of the <HI>En∣glish.</HI>
And notwithstanding all the Vigilance the Earl could use, the Dark∣ness
and Length of the Nights so favoured them, that He could not en∣gage
<MILESTONE N="10"/>their whole Fleet as He endeavoured to do: Yet He had the good
Fortune in two Encounters to take eight of their great Ships of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But takes ma∣ny of his Ships in their Flight.</NOTE> two of
their best <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, and about twenty of their other Merchant-Ships,
which were all under the Protection of their Fleet, or ought to have been.
After which He was by Tempest driven to put the Fleet into Security in the
<HI>English</HI> Harbours, it being already the Month of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a fair Booty, and came very opportunely to supply the present
Necessities of the Navy, and to provide for the setting out of the next Fleet
at Spring, and was in Truth gotten with very good Conduct, and without
any considerable Damage: But it being much less than was expected (for
<MILESTONE N="20"/>whatsoever was upon the Sea was looked upon as our own), the News no
sooner arrived at <HI>Oxford,</HI> but Intelligence came with it of many Oversights
which had been committed and Opportunities lost, otherwise it had been
easy to have taken the whole Fleet; and that it might have been pursued
farther when it was in View, after those <HI>East-India</HI> Ships were taken, which
were indeed surprised and boarded at the Break of Day, when They thought
themselves in the Middle of their own Fleet. And it is as true that the
Earl did then pursue to engage the Fleet, till They were got so near the
<HI>French</HI> Shore, that the Wind blowing in to the Land, it was by all the
Flag-Officers thought absolutely necessary to give over the Chace.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>SIR <HI>William Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> W. Co∣ventry's <HI>un∣just Reflec∣tions upon him.</HI></NOTE> who had never paid a Civility to any worthy Man
but as it was a Disobligation to another whom He cared less for, and so
had only contributed to the Preferment of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the last
Expedition that He might cross Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> received much Intelligence
from several Officers in the Fleet, which He scattered abroad to the Preju∣dice
of the Earl, and was willing that it should be believed that He had
been too wary in avoiding Danger. But the King and the Duke were very
just to the Earl, and discountenanced all those Reports as Scandals and
Calumnies: And the Duke, who had seen his Behaviour in the most dan∣gerous
Action, gave him a loud Testimony “of a prudent and brave Com∣mander,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and as forward and bold in the Face of Danger as the Occasion
required or Discretion permitted.” And his Highness undertook “that
He had in all this Expedition done what a Man of Honour was obliged to
do,” and was abundantly satisfied (as his Majesty likewise was) with the
rich Prizes He had brought home, which had caused equal Lamentation in
<HI>Holland,</HI> and almost broke the Heart of <HI>De Wit</HI> himself. But what Suc∣cess
soever the Earl had at Sea, it was his Misfortune to do an unadvised
Action when He came into the Harbour, that lessened the King's own Es∣teem
of him, and to a great Degree irreconciled the Duke to him, and
gave Opportunity to his Enemies to do him much Prejudice.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>IT was a constant and a known Rule in the Admiralty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An imprud<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Action of the Earl of</HI> Sand∣wich <HI>after his Return.</HI></NOTE> that of any
Ship that is taken from the Enemy Bulk is not to be broken, till it be
brought into the Port and adjudged lawful Prize. It seems that when the
Fleet returned to the Harbour, the Flag-Officers petitioned or moved the
<PB N="302" REF="306"/>
Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> “in Regard of their having continued all the Summer
upon the Seas with great Fatigue, and been engaged in many Actions of
Danger, that He would distribute amongst them some Reward out of the
<HI>Indian</HI> Ships;” which He thought reasonable, and inclined to satisfy them,
and writ a Letter to the Vice-Chamberlain to inform the King of it, and
that He thought it fit to be done;” to which the Vice-Chamberlain, having
shewed the Letter to the King, returned his Majesty's Approbation. But
before the Answer came to his Hand He had executed the Design, and di∣stributed
as much of the coarser Goods to the Flag-Officers, as by Estima∣tion
was valued to be one thousand Pounds to each Officer, and took to the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Value of two thousand Pounds for himself. This suddenly made such a
Noise and Outcry, as if all the <HI>Indian</HI> and other Merchant-Ships had been
plundered by the Seamen: And They again cried out as much, that no
Care was taken of them, but all given to the Flag-Officers; which the other
Captains thought to be an Injury to them.</P>
<P>THE General (who had Nothing like Kindness for the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the General re∣presents in the worst Light.</NOTE>
whose Service He thought had been too much considered and recompensed
by the King at his Arrival) had Notice of it before it came to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and
according to his universal Care (which was afterwards found to proceed
from private Animosity) sent Orders to all the Port Towns to seize upon<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Goods which were brought in Shallops from the Fleet; and gave Adver∣tisement
to <HI>Oxford</HI> of the extraordinary ill Consequence of that Action,
and “that it would spoil the Sale of all that remained of those Ships,
since the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, which probably would have been the best
Chapmen, would not now be forward to buy, since so much was disposed
of already to other Hands as would spoil their Market.” And by this
Time the Earl himself had given an Account of all that had been done,
and the Motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of∣fended with the Earl.</NOTE> to the Duke. The King was justly displeased for the
Expedition He had used, “why had his Approbation been desired, when
He resolved to do the Thing before He could receive an Answer?” yet<MILESTONE N="30"/>
was glad that He had done so, because He would have been more excuse∣able
if He had received it.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke, who had been constantly kind to the Earl, was offended
in the highest Degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke in∣censed against him.</NOTE> and thought himself injured and affronted beyond
any Precedent. “This most unjustifiable Action could proceed only from
two Fountains: The one of extreme Vanity and Ambition, to make
himself popular amongst the Officers of the Fleet, who ought not to have
been gratified by him at the King's Charge. When any such Bounty should
be seasonable, it was the Duke's Province to have been the Author, and the
Conduit to have conveyed it: He had himself been an Eyewitness of their<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Behaviour in the greatest Action; and for the Earl to assume the reward∣ing
them by his own Authority was to defraud and rob him of his proper
Right and Jurisdiction.” And He looked upon his having desired the
King's Allowance by the Vice-Chamberlain, as a Trick and an Aggrava∣tion;
for He ought to have asked his Advice as his superiour Officer; And
the poor Vice-Chamberlain underwent his Share in the Reproach, for having
presumed to move the King in a Particular that, if it was to be moved at
all, had been to be moved by the Duke. “The other Fountain which might
produce this Presumption might be Avarice,” which was the sole Blemish
(though it never appeared in any gross Instance) that seemed to cloud many<MILESTONE N="50"/>
noble Virtues in that Earl, who now became a very pregnant Evidence of
the irresistible Strength and Power of Envy; which though it feeds on its
own Poison, and is naturally more grievous to the Person who harbours it
<PB N="303" REF="307"/>
than to him that is maligned, yet when it finds a Subject it can effectually
work upon, it is more insatiable in Revenge than any Passion the Soul is
liable unto.</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of so excellent a Temper and Behaviour that He
could make himself no Enemies; of so many good Qualities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of the Earl of</HI> Sandwich.</NOTE> and so easy
to live with, that He marvellously reconciled the Minds of all Men to him,
who had not Intimacy enough with him to admire his other Parts: Yet
was in the general Inclinations of Men upon some Disadvantage. They
who had constantly followed the King whilst He as constantly adhered to
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Cromwell,</HI> and knew not how early He had entertained Repentance, and
with what Hazards and Dangers He had manifested it, did believe the
King had been too prodigal in heaping so many Honours upon him.
And They who had been familiar with him and of the same Party, and
thought They had been as active as He in contributing to the Revolution,
considered him with some Anger, as one who had better Luck than They
without more Merit, and who had made early Conditions: When in Truth
no Man in the Kingdom had been less guilty of that Address; nor did He
ever contribute to any Advancement to which He arrived, by the least In∣timation
or Insinuation that He wished it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is very injuriously treated.</NOTE> or that it would be acceptable
<MILESTONE N="20"/>to him. Yet upon this Blast the Winds rose from all Quarters, Reproaches
of all Sorts were cast upon him, and all Affronts contrived for him.</P>
<P>THE Earl had conveyed that Part of the Goods which He had as∣signed
to himself in a Shallop to <HI>Lynn,</HI> from whence it could pass by
Water to his own House. An Officer in that Port seized upon it by
Virtue of the General's Warrant, and would cause it presently to be unladen,
which He began to do. But the Servants of the Earl appealed to the other
Officers in equal Authority, to whom They brought a Letter with them
from the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> in which He owned all those Goods to be his
(amongst which were his Bedding and Furniture for his Cabin, and all his
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Plate and other Things suitable), and likewise a Note of all the other
Goods which might be liable to pay Custom; and desired them “to send one
of their Searchers with the Boat to his House, where He should receive all
their Dues, without being unladen in the Port;” which, besides the De∣lay,
would be liable to many Inconveniences. The Officer who had first
arrested it, and who had Dependance upon a great Man of the Country,
who was not unwilling that any Affront should be put upon the Earl,
roughly refused to suffer it to pass without being first unladen; but being
over-ruled by the other Officers, vented his Anger in very unmannerly
Language against the Earl: Of all which He, being advertised by his Ser∣vants,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>sent a Complaint to the Lords of the Council, and desired “the
Fellow might be sent for and punished;” which could not be refused,
though it proved troublesome in the Inquiry. For the Officer, who was
a Gentleman of a fair Behaviour and good Repute, denied all those Words
which carried in them the worst Interpretation; but justified the Action,
and produced the General's Warrant, which had unusual Expressions, and
apparent enough to have a particular and not a general Intention.</P>
<P>THE General had quick Advertisement of it, and writ very passionately
from <HI>London,</HI> “that an Officer should be sent for without having committed
any other Offence than in obeying and executing a Warrant of his:” And
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the other great Man, who was of great Importance to the King's Service
and in the highest Trust in that Country, writ several Letters “how impos∣sible
it would be to carry on the King's Service in that Country, if that
Officer should be punished for doing that, when He ought to be pu∣nished
<PB N="304" REF="308"/>
if He had not done it;” and therefore desired, “that He might
be repaired by them who had caused him to be sent for.”</P>
<P>SIR <HI>William Coventry</HI> had now full Sea-Room to give Vent to all his
Passions, and to incense the Duke, who was enough offended without such
Contributions: “If this proceeded from Covetousness, it was not probable
that it would be satisfied with so little; and therefore it was probable, that
though the Officers might not have received above the Value of one thou∣sand
Pounds,” which was assigned to each, “yet himself would not be
contented with so little as two thousand; and They might therefore well
conceive that He had taken much more, which ought to be examined<MILESTONE N="10"/>
with the greatest Strictness.” There had been Nothing said before of
not taking Advantage enough upon the Enemy in all Occasions which had
been offered, and of not pursuing them far enough, which was not now
renewed, with Advice “that He might be presently sent for;” though it
was known that, as soon as He could put the Ships into the Ports to which
they were designed, He would come to <HI>Oxford.</HI> And there were great un∣derhand
Endeavours, that the House of Commons might be inflamed with
this Miscarriage and Misdemeanor, and present it as a Complaint to the
House of Peers, as fit to be examined and brought to Judgment before that
Tribunal. And They, who with all the Malice imaginable did endeavour<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in vain to kindle this Fire, persuaded the King and the Duke, “that by
their sole Activity and Interest it was prevented for that Time, because
the Session was too short, and that all necessary Evidence could not be
soon produced at <HI>Oxford;</HI> but that, as soon as the Plague should cease to
such a Degree in <HI>London</HI> that the Parliament might assemble there, it
would be impossible to restrain the House of Commons from pursuing
that Complaint,” of which Nobody thought but themselves and They
who were provoked by them.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> had so good Intelligence from <HI>Oxford,</HI> that He
knew all that was said of him, and began to believe that He had done un∣advisedly<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in administering Occasion of speaking ill to those who greedily
sought for it: And as soon as his Absence from the Fleet could be dispensed
with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He fully clears himself of the Charge of Misconduct at Sea.</NOTE> He made Haste to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and gave so full an Account of every
Day's Action, from the Time that He went to Sea to the Day of his Return,
and of his having never done any Thing of Importance, nor having left any
Thing undone, but with and by the Advice of the Council of War, upon
the Orders He had received, that both the King and the Duke could not
but absolve him from all the Imputations of Negligence or Inadvertency.</P>
<P>BUT for the breaking Bulk and the Circumstances that attended it, They
declared They were unsatisfied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And makes an ingenuous Ac∣knowledgement of his Impru∣dence.</NOTE> And He confessed “that He had been<MILESTONE N="40"/>
much to blame,” and asked Pardon, and with such Excuses as He thought
might in some Degree plead for him. He protested, “it seemed to him to have
had some Necessity: That the whole Fleet was in a general Indisposition,
and complained that for all that Summer Action” (which indeed had been
full of Merit) “They had Nothing given to them, not without some mut∣tering
that They would have Somewhat out of those <HI>India</HI> Ships before
They would part with them; insomuch as He had a real Apprehension
that They had a Purpose to plunder them. And He should have feared
more, if He had not complied with the Flag-Officers Importunity: And
thereupon He consented that They should have each of them the Value of<MILESTONE N="50"/>
one thousand Pounds, and which He was most confident the Goods which
had been delivered to them did not exceed.” He confessed “He had not
enough considered the Consequence, and that They who had not re∣ceived
<PB N="305" REF="309"/>
any Donative would be more displeased, than They who had it
were satisfied with it; which He acknowledged was the Case: That He
was heartily sorry for permitting any such Thing to be done, and more for
having aken any himself, and humbly asked Pardon for Both; and desired
that his own Part, which remained entire, might be restored to the Ship
from whence it had been taken, which He would cause to be done.”</P>
<P>A MORE ingenuous Acknowledgement could not be made: And They
who could not but observe many Persons every Day excused for more
enormous Transgressions, did hope that He, who had so few Faults to an∣swer
<MILESTONE N="10"/>for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With which the King is satisfied.</NOTE> would have been absolved for that Trespass. And the King him∣self
used him very graciously, and so did the Duke; and He was sent back
to the Fleet, to give Order for the sending out a Winter-Guard and order∣ing
all other maritime Affairs, and for the sending up the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships into
the River, with great Care that none of the Seamen should go on Shore,
where the Plague still raged little if at all less than it had done in the Sum∣mer:
And so He himself and most other Men believed and were glad, that
an ill Business was so well composed. But Sir <HI>William</HI> did not intend that
it should end there.</P>
<P>THE present Business,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> East-In∣dia <HI>Prizes sold for the Service of the War.</HI></NOTE> that must admit no Interruption, was the raising
<MILESTONE N="20"/>what Money might be to supply the present Necessities of the Fleet, to pay
the Seamen, and to make all Preparations to set out the Fleet against
the Spring, when the <HI>French</HI> Ships would be infallibly ready to join with
the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the Money that was given by the Parliament would not be
paid till long after; and the Affairs of the Bankers were in such Disorder
by the Death of Servants, and the Plague having been in some of their
Houses, that the usual Course of advancing Moneys by Assignations could
not be depended upon. The General had written to the Lord Treasurer,
“that He thought that there could not be so good Chapmen for those Ships
as the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, some whereof had been with him to know the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>King's Pleasure; and if Authority were granted to any Men to treat
upon that Affair, They would send for Members enough of their Com∣pany,
who were dispersed in the Country, to be present at a Court,
which would authorise a Committee to treat and contract with them:”
And He said, “that He was confident that Half the Money would be paid
“upon the making the Bargain.” The King was no sooner advertised of
this Overture, than He sent Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ashburnham</HI> to
<HI>London</HI> to confer with the General and to be advised by him, and granted
Authority to them three to sell those two Prizes to those who would give
most. And They found no Overtures to be so advantageous as those which
<MILESTONE N="40"/>were made by that Company: And yet They made so much Use of the
Advantage of the Time, when all Men of notorious Wealth were out of the
Town, that They thought not fit to make any Agreement till They gave
the King an Account of the whole Transaction, with their Opinions upon
Conference with other Men of Business; and to that Purpose the two
Persons who had been sent to the General returned safe to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been mentioned before, that it was thought a great Presumption
in any Body to presume to interpose in the maritime Affairs, which was in∣terpreted
to be an Invasion of the Duke's peculiar Province; and by this
Means the Credit of Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was so absolute, that the Disposal
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of all was in his Power.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King per∣suaded to re∣move Lord</HI> Sandwich <HI>from the Com∣mand of the Fleet.</HI></NOTE> He had persuaded the Duke, and the Lord <HI>Ar∣lington</HI>
who was in firm Conjunction with him had prevailed with the
King to believe, “that the House of Commons was so incensed against the
Lord <HI>Sandwich</HI> for his late Presumption, that it would not be possible
<PB N="306" REF="310"/>
to hinder them in their next assembling” (which was appointed or re∣solved
to be in <HI>April,</HI> if it pleased God to extinguish the Sickness) “from
falling very severely upon the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> which would be a very
great Dishonour to the King if He were at that Time in the Command
of the Fleet; and that there was no Way to preserve him” (for that was
their Method when They had a Mind to ruin a Man, to pretend a great
Care that He might not be undone) “but by dismissing him from that
Charge, which probably might preserve him from being further questioned
since it would be interpreted a Punishment inflicted on him by the King
for his Crime, and so might stop him from being further prosecuted for<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the same Offence.” To which They added, “that it would be neces∣sary
in another Respect; for that many of the Officers as well as com∣mon
Seamen had opened their Mouths very wide against him, especially
after it was generally known that the King and the Duke were offended
with him, and had not been at all reserved in charging him with several
Reproaches: And that if the same Command were still continued in him,
it could not be presumed that those Men would ever put themselves un∣der
his Command whom They had so much provoked.”</P>
<P>THESE Arguments urged by Men who were not known, at least by the
King and Duke, to be his Enemies, and one of them thought to be (and<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in Truth was but for his Conjunction with the other) his Friend, and to
wish him very well, prevailed upon the Judgments of Both of them; in∣somuch
as They resolved to confer with the Chancellor, whom They knew
to be much the Earl's Friend.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣solves to dis∣miss him with Honour.</NOTE> And They Both expressed “very much
Kindness to and Confidence in the Affection and Integrity and Courage
of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> though He was to be blamed for his late Indis∣cretion,
and a Resolution with their utmost Power to defend him from
undergoing any Disgrace by it: But that it would contribute most to his
Preservation, that He quitted the Employment, and that some other Per∣sons
should be sent to command the next Fleet in the Spring. For if He<MILESTONE N="30"/>
should again go to Sea, and the Parliament should press to have him sent
for to answer what They had to object against him, his Majesty must
either refuse to consent to it, which would make a Breach with his Par∣liament,
or by consenting disorder his maritime Affairs to that Degree,
that the Enemy could not but take very great Advantage of it.” There∣fore
They commanded the Chancellor to confer with him and discourse
the whole Matter to him, to assure him “of the King's and Duke's Fa∣vour,
and that They were in this Particular moved only by their Tender∣ness
to him; and that some Expedient should be first found out to re∣move
him with Honour, before any Notice should be taken of the Pur∣pose<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to remove him, and before any other Person should be deputed to
the Command; and that He himself should either propose the Expedient,
if any such occurred to him that would be grateful, or judge of any that
should be proposed to him.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor did presume to declare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor against re¦moving him.</NOTE> “that He thought that They
were persuaded to apprehend Somewhat that could not fall out. That
He would not take upon him to excuse the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> for any Of∣fence
He had committed: If it were of that Magnitude that his Majesty
thought fit to remove him from his Command, Nobody could censure it;
and it may be in a Time of so much License the Severity might be<MILESTONE N="50"/>
thought seasonable. But the Apprehension that the Parliament would
take more Notice of what the Earl had done, than They would of any
other Breach of Order that was every Day committed, was without any
<PB N="307" REF="311"/>
just Reason.” But that Argument was presently silenced by their under∣taking
to know Somewhat that the other could not do, and that there was
no other Way to preserve him but that which was proposed.</P>
<P>THERE was at that Time an Opportunity in View, that might give the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> an Employment very worthy of him, and which no Man
could imagine would be assigned to any Man who was in Disgrace.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of Sir</HI> Richard Fanshaw's <HI>Embassy in</HI> Spain.</NOTE> Sir
<HI>Richard Fanshaw,</HI> who was a Gentleman very well known and very well
beloved, had been first Ambassadour in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and had behaved himself
so well there, that when He returned from thence He was recommended,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and upon the Matter desired, by that Crown to be sent to <HI>Spain,</HI> as the
fittest Person to mediate in the King's Name between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portu∣gal;</HI>
and the King had before designed to send him Ambassadour into
<HI>Spain,</HI> as well to settle a Treaty between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> (for there
was none yet), as to do all the Offices between those other Crowns which
were requisite to the End aforesaid. No Man knew that Court better
or was so well versed in the Language, having lived many Years before
in that Court in much better Times. He had remained now about two Years,
with such frequent Mortifications as Ministers use to meet with in Courts
irresolute and perplexed in their own Affairs, as the Counsels of <HI>Madrid</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>were in the last Years of the King, as his Indisposition increased or by re∣laxing
administered some Hope. He had made a Journey to <HI>Lisbon</HI> upon
the earnest Desire of <HI>Spain,</HI> and returned without Effect. The Peace was
equally desired and equally necessary to Both Nations: But the <HI>Portugal</HI> was
unmoveable in the Conditions of it, preferring the Worst that could fall out,
even the abandoning their Country, rather than to be without the Sove∣reignty
of it; and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> as positive not to part with their Title,
though They had no Hope of their Subjection. Nor did <HI>Spain</HI> appear so∣licitous
to conclude any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> except either <HI>Portugal</HI> might
be comprehended in it or abandoned by it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>ON a sudden, when the Recovery of the King grew more desperate (which is
never a Thing notoriously known in that Court), a Project for a Treaty was
sent to the Ambassadour, containing more Advantages in Trade to the Nation
(which are the most important Matters in all those Treaties), and insisting
upon fewer inconvenient Conditions, than had ever been in any former
Treaties; without any Mention of <HI>Tangier</HI> or <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which had hi∣therto
in the Entrance into any Treaty since the King's Return made the
Progress impossible: Only it was urged, “that it might either be presently
accepted and signed by the Ambassadour, with a Covenant that it should
be confirmed by the King within so many Days after it should be pre∣sented
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to him, or else that there should be no more Mention or Dis∣course
of it.”</P>
<P>THE Ambassadour, surprised with this Overture, compared what was
offered with what He was to demand by his Instructions; and what was de∣fective
in those Particulars He added to the Articles presented to him, with
such Additions as upon his own Observation and Conference with the Mer∣chants
occurred to him, or which seemed probable to be granted from Some∣what
themselves had offered more than had been demanded by him. These
Alterations and Amendments were approved and consented to, and quickly re∣turned
engrossed and signed by the King, on Condition to be presently signed
<MILESTONE N="50"/>by him, with the Undertaking that is formerly mentioned. It had been wisely
done by the Ambassadour, and no more than his Duty, if He had first ac∣quainted
his Master or the Ministers with all that had passed, and expected a
particular Order before He had signed it. But that being expressly refused,
<PB N="308" REF="312"/>
without concealing the Reason or the King's Weakness, “which” They de∣clared
“might make such an Alteration in Counsels, that if it were not done
in his Life-Time They knew not what might happen after:” This was
thought as good an Argument by him for the Dispatch as it was to them;
and that if He should not make Use of this Conjuncture, there would never
be the like advantageous Treaty offered again. Hereupon He presently
signed the Treaty, with some secret Article which was not to the Advan∣tage
of <HI>Portugal,</HI> otherwise than that He concluded, by what had been said
to him at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> it would have been acceptable to them.</P>
<P>THIS Treaty was no sooner brought to the King by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambas∣sadour<MILESTONE N="10"/>
(who had received it by an Express) and perused at the Council-Ta∣ble,
but many gross Faults were found to be in it. Besides the Gentle∣man's
Absence, who would with greater Abilites have defended himself than
any of those had who reproached him, it was no Advantage to him that
He was known to be much in the Chancellor's Confidence: And therefore
the more Pain was taken to persuade the King that He was a weak Man
(which the King himself knew him not to be); and They put such a Gloss
upon many of the Articles, and rejected others as unprofitable which were
thought to contain Matters of great Moment, that They would not consent
that a Trade to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> could be any Benefit to <HI>England,</HI> and the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
like. In the End, the King concluded that He would not sign the Treaty;
for which He had some Access of Reason within a Month after, by the
Death of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN all these Reproaches were cast upon the Ambassadour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is recalled.</NOTE> and Notice
given that the King did disavow the Treaty and refused to sign it; it
was reasonably resolved that He ought not to remain there longer as Am∣bassadour,
but to be recalled. But the Plague driving the King from <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
and dispersing the Council, the pursuing this Resolution was no more
assumed, till the Business of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> made it thought on as
a good Expedient; and the Chancellor was directed in his Discourse with<MILESTONE N="30"/>
the Earl to mention it, as a proper Expedient in his Condition to be laid
Hold on and embraced.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor entered upon the whole Discourse with that Freedom
and Openness that became a Man who He knew was not suspected by
him. He told him all that himself knew of the Affair, and the Ap∣prehension
the King had of the Parliament, and the Expedient He had
thought of to remove him out of the Reach or Noise of Clamour, of
which He made him the Judge; and “if He did not like this Employment
for <HI>Spain,</HI> some other should be thought of and published before it should
be known, and before the Command of the Fleet should be committed to<MILESTONE N="40"/>
any other.”</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> lamented “that it had been in any Body's Power
to make so ill Impressions in the King and the Duke, upon his having
committed a Trespass for which He was heartily sorry;” and confessed
it was a Presumption and Indiscretion, the ill Consequence whereof He
had not had Wit enough to discover: However He did not yet think it so
great, as to make him fear to give an Account of it before the Parlia∣ment,
or any Thing that They could do upon it.” He seemed not to be
ignorant of the Offices Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> did him, “in drawing Com∣plaints
and Reproaches from those who had neither Cause nor Inclination<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to speak to his Disadvantage. He was sensible of the General's Want of
Justice towards him, which He knew not to what to impute but to
his Pride and Weakness. He did acknowledge it great Bounty in the
<PB N="309" REF="313"/>
King, since He thought him unfit and unworthy to continue in the Com∣mand
He had, that He would yet assign him to so honourable an Em∣ployment;
which, though it could not wipe off the Reproach of being
dismissed from the other Charge, was yet a sufficient Evidence that He
was not out of his Majesty's good Opinion and Confidence: And there∣fore
He did with all Cheerfulness submit to his Majesty's Pleasure, and
would be ready for his Journey to <HI>Spain</HI> as soon as his Dispatch should be
prepared.”</P>
<P>HE told him then, “that He was in one Respect glad to be removed
<MILESTONE N="10"/>from his present Command, for He was confident that He would see no
more great Matters done at Sea, for that the common Men were weary of
the War; and that Sir <HI>William</HI> would never suffer any Peace to be in the
Fleet, but had Creatures ready to do all ill Offices amongst them, whom
He cherished and preferred before the best Officers;” and told him many
other Things which fell out afterwards, and said “Sir <HI>William</HI> would make
any Man who should succeed him weary of his Command, by sending
such Variety of Orders that He would not know what to do.” And shortly
after He gave him a perfect Journal of his last Expedition, in which there
were indeed many Orders which must needs startle and perplex a Commander
<MILESTONE N="20"/>in Chief, it being his usual Course to signify the Duke's Pleasure in Matters
of the greatest Importance without the Duke's Hand; which yet They
durst not disobey, nor produce in their own Justification, being such as
in Truth were no such Warrants as They ought to obey, and yet would
reflect upon his Royal Highness: And told him likewise of the ill Inven∣tions
He had set on Foot, by which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was stopped from being
joined with him in the Command of the last Fleet.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor had informed the King of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI>
his Submission to his Pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sandwich <HI>sent Ambassa∣dour Extraor∣dinary into</HI> Spain.</NOTE> and that He would be ready to undertake
the Employment for <HI>Spain</HI> as soon as his Majesty pleased; hereupon the King
<MILESTONE N="30"/>declared his Resolution in Council to send the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> his Extra∣ordinary
Ambassadour, as well to correct and amend the Mistakes and Er∣rours
in the late Treaty, as farther to mediate the Peace with <HI>Portugal,</HI>
which upon the Death of the King was in some Respect more practicable.
And to that Purpose He sent Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI> one of the Clerks of the
Council, Envoy into <HI>Portugal,</HI> that the Earl might the better know the
Inclinations of that People: And all Instructions necessary were presently to
be prepared to Both those Ends.</P>
<P>THIS first Work being thus dispatched,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King thinks of ap∣pointing Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>and the General joint Admirals.</HI></NOTE> it remained to settle the Com∣mand,
for the ensuing Year, of the Fleet; and there can be little Doubt
<MILESTONE N="40"/>made, but that the King and the Duke had resolved this at the same
Time that They determined that the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> should not continue
in it: However it was communicated to Nobody, till the Designation of the
other was published. Then the King told the Chancellor, “that his Bro∣ther
and He had long considered that Affair, and could not think of any
Expedient so good for the Performance of that Service, as a Conjunction
between Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the General, and making them Both joint Com∣manders
in Chief of the Fleet for the next Expedition.” There had many
Exceptions occurred to them against committing the Charge to either of them
singly; nor were They without Apprehension of some which might fall out
<MILESTONE N="50"/>by joining them together, which would be much greater, if They were not
Both well prepared to embrace the Occasion, and themselves to like the De∣signation.
For the doing this the Chancellor was again thought to be the
fittest Man, being believed to have the greatest Interest in Both of them,
<PB N="310" REF="314"/>
and most in him from whom the greatest Difficulties were expected to arise,
which was Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI> It was easy to know Prince <HI>Rupert's</HI> Mind,
who was in the House: Yet They were Both in Cases of that Nature de∣sirous
always to impart what They desired by others, rather than to debate
it first themselves. But then the General was at <HI>London,</HI> besieged by the
Plague; and the Matter was not fit to be communicated by Letter, be∣cause,
if He should make any Scruple of concurring in it, it was to be
declined.</P>
<P>UPON these Considerations it was resolved, first, that the Chancellor
should prepare Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and then that the General should be sent for<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to <HI>Oxford</HI> upon Pretences, of which enough would occur. The Prince,
though He was much more willing to have gone alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>willingly ac∣cepts of a joint Commission.</HI></NOTE> willingly conformed
to the King's Pleasure: And so both the King and Duke spake at large
with him upon all that was necessary to be adjusted. And the General was
sent to, “that it was necessary for the King to confer with him upon some
Propositions, which were made to him upon the <HI>East-India</HI> Ships” (which
Transaction was not at that Time yet concluded); “and therefore that on
such a Day He should come from <HI>London</HI> early in the Morning” (for it
was deep Winter) “in his own Coach to <HI>Beaconsfield,</HI> where He should
find another Coach ready to receive him, and another at another Stage;<MILESTONE N="20"/>
so that He might be with Ease at <HI>Oxford</HI> the same Night,” as He was,
and very graciously received by the King, as He deserved to be. But as He
had no Manner of Imagination of the true Reason why He was sent for, so
neither his Majesty nor the Duke would impart it to him, out of real Ima∣gination
that it would not be grateful to him; but that was left to be im∣parted
and dexterously managed by the Chancellor, in whom, as was said
before, it was generally believed that He had great Confidence.</P>
<P>HE the next Morning entered into Conference with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor confers with the Ge∣neral upon the Subject.</NOTE> and after general
Discourses told him, “that the King had disposed the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> to
another Employment, for which He did not seem sorry; and that it<MILESTONE N="30"/>
must be now thought of, who was fit to command in his Place: That there
was no Hope of Peace, instead whereof there would be an entire Con∣junction
between <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet” (the
Ambassadours being about this Time gone) “would be ready to join with them
as soon as They should put to Sea; and there was much Doubt that the <HI>Dane</HI>
would betake himself to the same Alliance; and all would be at Sea before
We should be, except extraordinary Diligence were used, which the Con∣tinuance
of the Plague would hardly admit.” The General presently
answered, “that no Person was so fit for that Command as Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
who understood the Seas well, and had that Courage that was necessary<MILESTONE N="40"/>
in this Conjuncture.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, “that the King had great Confidence in the
Affection and unquestionable Courage of Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> But He was not
sure, that the Quickness of his Spirit and the Strength of his Passion might
not sometimes stand in Need of the Advice and Assistance of a Friend, who
should be in equal Authority with him; and had therefore thought of find∣ing
some fit Person to be joined with him, and so make one Admiral of two
Persons.” To which the other not replying suddenly, He continued his
Discourse, saying “that the King had such a Person in his View, whom
He would never acquaint with it, until He might find some Way to<MILESTONE N="50"/>
discover that the proposing it would not be ingrateful to him; and
that He was obliged to make this Discovery, and that the Person in the
King's View was himself; and that if He and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> were joined
<PB N="311" REF="315"/>
in the Command of the Fleet and undertook it, his Majesty would be∣lieve
that He had done all that was in his Power, and would with great
Hope commit all the rest to God Almighty.” He said, “He thought
He had behaved himself most like a Friend in telling him shortly and
plainly what the King's Drift was, towards which, though the Secret
was known to none but the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> yet such an Advance was
made, that his Majesty was well assured that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would readily
comply with his Pleasure.” Upon the whole Matter He desired him “to
deal as like a Friend with him, and to tell him freely if He had no Mind
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to the Employment; and He would take upon him to prevent the making
the Proposition to him, and that neither the King nor Duke should take
it unkindly.”</P>
<P>THE General appeared really surprised and full of Thoughts: And after a
short Pause He desired him “not to believe that He made the least Difficulty
in his Thoughts of undertaking the Service; but many Things had oc∣curred
to him in the Discourse, which He would mention anon.” He said,
that for his own Part He should be willing to go out of <HI>London</HI> To-mor∣row,
and think himself much safer in any Action against the <HI>Dutch</HI> than
He could be in the Post He was, where every Day Men died about him
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and in his View; and as He thought that He had done the King better
Service by staying in <HI>London,</HI> than He could have done in any other Place,
so He believed if the Sickness should continue” (as it was like enough to
do, there appearing yet very little Decrease), “his Majesty might think that
his Presence might be as necessary there as it had been.” The Chan∣cellor
replied, “that his Majesty had foreseen that Contingency; and had
already resolved that if that fell out to be the Case, He should rather de∣sire
his Residence should be where it had been (though He was much
troubled to expose him to so much Hazard) than in any other Place:
But that his Majesty's Confidence in the Mercy of God, that He would
<MILESTONE N="30"/>take off this heavy Visitation before the End of Winter, had suggested
the other Designation of him to the Service of the Fleet, upon the good
Conduct whereof his own and the Kingdom's Happiness so much de∣pended.”</P>
<P>THE General quickly replied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The General submits to the King's Plea∣sure.</NOTE> “that for that Matter He was so willing
to engage himself, that if the King pleased He would most readily serve
under the Command of Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI>” To which the other answered
as readily, “that the King would never consent to that.” And so They
resolved presently to go to the King, that his Majesty and the Duke might
know what would please them so much. And as They were going, the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>General said smiling, “that He would tell him now what the true Cause
was, that had made that Pause in him upon the first Discourse of the
Business; and that it would be necessary for him, after all Things should
be adjusted with the King and Duke and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> that what con∣cerned
him should still remain a Secret, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> be understood
to have that Command alone. For if his Wife should come to know it,
before He had by Degrees prepared her for it, She would break out into
such Passions as would be very uneasy to him: But He would in a short
Time dispose her well enough; and in the mean Time Nothing should
be omitted on his Part, that was necessary for the Advancement of the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Service.” Hereupon the King, the Duke, the Prince and the Ge∣neral
consulted of all that was to be done: And He at the End of two
Days returned to <HI>London</HI> with the same Expedition that He came to <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI>
together with Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> the Treasurer of the Navy, and all
<PB N="312" REF="316"/>
Orders that were requisite for the Sale of the <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, upon which
all Provisions for the Fleet were to be made.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> had preserved that excellent Harmony
that the King had proposed, and hardly wished any Thing in which They
had not concurred, insomuch as never Parliament so entirely sympathised
with his Majesty; and though it passed more Acts for his Honour and Se∣curity
than any other had ever done in so short a Session: Yet it produced a
Precedent of a very unhappy Nature, the Circumstances whereof in the pre∣sent
were unusual and pernicious, and the Consequences in the future very
mischievous, and therefore not unfit to be set out at large.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to remove the Treasurer.</NOTE> closely united in the
same Purposes and especially against the Chancellor, had a great Desire to
find some Means to change the Course and Method of the King's Counsels;
which They could hardly do whilst the same Persons continued still in the
same Employments. Their Malice was most against the Chancellor: Yet
They knew not what Suggestions to make to the King against him, having
always pretended to his Majesty, how falsely soever, to have a great Esteem
of him. Their Project therefore was to remove the Treasurer, who was as
weary of his Office and of the Court as any Body could be of him: But his
Reputation was so great, his Wisdom so unquestionable, and his Integrity<MILESTONE N="20"/>
so confessed, that They knew in neither of those Points He could be im∣peached.
And the King himself had Kindness and Reverence towards him,
though He had for some Years thought him less active, and so less fit for
that Administration, than every Body else knew him to be: And these
Men had long insinuated unto his Majesty, “how ill all the Business of the
Exchequer was managed by the continual Infirmities of the Treasurer,
who between the Gout and the Stone had not Ease enough to attend the
painful Function of that Office, but left the Whole to be managed and
governed by his Secretary Sir <HI>Philip Warwick;</HI>” upon whose Experience
and Fidelity He did in Truth much rely, as He had Reason to do, his<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Reputation for Both being very signal and universal. And towards fasten∣ing
this Reproach They had the Contribution of the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> who was
good at looking into other Mens Offices, and was not pleased to see Sir
<HI>Philip Warwick's</HI> Credit greater than his with the Treasurer, and his Ad∣vice
more followed. And the other two had craftily insinuated to him,
that He would make much a better Treasurer; which, whilst He thought
They were in Earnest, prevailed with him not only to suggest Materials to
them for that Reproach, but to inculcate the same to the King upon several
Occasions: But when He discovered that They intended Nothing of Ad∣vantage
to his Particular, He withdrew from that Intrigue, though in all<MILESTONE N="40"/>
other Particulars He sided with them.</P>
<P>THE King was too easy in making Assignations upon his Revenue,
which would make it uncapable to satisfy others which were more neces∣sary,
and to grant Suits by Lease or Farm (sometimes to worthy Men),
which were of mischievous Consequence to all the Measures which could
be taken; and those the Treasurer found himself obliged to stop: And com∣monly
upon informing the King of it and of his Reasons, his Majesty was
very well pleased with what He had done, and (as hath been said before)
did often give himself Ease from the Importunity of many, by signing the
Warrants They brought to him, in Confidence that either the Chancellor or<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Treasurer would not suffer them to pass. However it raised Clamour; and
there were Men enough who had the same Provocation to make a great
Noise; and They easily found Countenance from others, who desired it
<PB N="313" REF="317"/>
should be believed, “that it was a high Arrogance and Presumption in any
Subject to stop any Signature of the King, and so make his Majesty's
Grace and Bounty to be ineffectual, if his Approbation and Consent was
not likewise procured.” There was visibly great Want of Money, though
there were vast Sums raised; which They laboured to persuade the King
proceeded from the Unskilfulness or Unactivity of the Treasurer, who was
again tired with the Vexation and Indignity, when He had so frequently
presented the King with the Particulars of the Receipts and Disbursements,
and made it demonstrable how much his Expenses exceeded all his Income;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and how impossible it would be, without lessening these, to provide where∣withal
to supply necessary Occasions: But this was an ungracious Subject,
and opened more Mouths than could easily be stopped.</P>
<P>THERE was a Man who hath been often named, Sir <HI>George Downing,</HI>
who by having been some Years in the Office of one of the Tellers of the
Exchequer, and being of a restless Brain, did understand enough of the Na∣ture
of the Revenue and of the Course of the Receipt, to make others who
understood less of it to think that He knew the Bottom of it, and that the
Expedients, which should be proposed by him towards a Reformation, could
not but be very pertinent and practicable. And He was not unhurt in the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Emoluments of his own Office, which were lessened by the Assignations made
to the Bankers upon the Receipts themselves, without the Money's ever
passing through the Tellers Office; by which, though They did receive their
just Fees, They had not what They would have taken if the Money had
passed through their own Hands. He was a Member of Parliament, and a
very voluminous Speaker, who would be thought wiser in Trade than any
of the Merchants, and to understand the Mystery of all Professions much
better than the Professors of them. And such a Kind of Chat is always ac∣ceptable
in a Crowd (where few understand many Subjects), who are always
glad to find those put out of Countenance who thought They understood it
<MILESTONE N="30"/>best: And so They were much pleased to hear Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> inveigh
against the Ignorance of those, who could only smile at his Want of
Knowledge.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman was very grateful to Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> as well as to
Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and was ready to instruct them in all the Miscarriages and
Oversights in the Treasury, and to propose Ways of Reformation to them.
“The Root of all Miscarriage was the unlimited Power of the Lord Trea∣surer,
that no Money could issue out without his particular Direction,
and all Money was paid upon no other Rules than his Order; so that let
the King want as much as was possible, no Money could be paid by his
<MILESTONE N="40"/>without the Treasurer's Warrant;” which to Men who understood no
more than They did seemed a very great Incongruity.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Project of Sir</HI> George Downing <HI>to new-model the Treasury.</HI></NOTE> “But,” He said,
if there were such a Clause inserted into the Bill which was to be passed
in the House of Commons for Money, it might prevent all Inconveniences,
and the King's Money would be paid only to those Persons and Purposes
to which his Majesty should assign them; and more Money would be
presently advanced upon this Act of Parliament, than the Credit of the
Bankers could procure;” for He foresaw, that would be a very natural
Objection against his Clause and the Method He proposed.</P>
<P>HE made his Discourse so plausible to them that They were much
<MILESTONE N="50"/>pleased with it; and it provided for so many of their own Ends, that They
neither did nor were able to consider the Reverse of it, but were most soli∣citous
that there might no Obstructions arise in the Way. If it should
come to the Knowledge of the Chancellor, He would oppose it for the
<PB N="314" REF="318"/>
Novelty, and the Consequences that might attend it; and if the Trea∣surer
had Notice of it, He would not consent to it for the Indignity that
his Office was subjected to: They therefore discoursed it to the King as
a Matter of high Importance to his Service if it were secretly carried; and
then brought the Projector, who was an indefatigable Talker, to inform
his Majesty of the many Benefits which would accrue to his Service by
this new Method that He had devised, and the many Mischiefs which would
be prevented.</P>
<P>THERE were many Things which were suggested, that were agreeable
to some Fancies that the King himself had entertained; there would not<MILESTONE N="10"/>
need now so many Formalities, as Warrants and Privy Seals, before Monies
could be paid; and Money might hereafter issue out and be paid without
the Treasurer's Privity; in which many Conveniences seemed to appear:
Though besides the Innovation and Breach of all old Order, which is ever
attended by many Mischiefs unforeseen, there were very great Inconveniences
in View in those very Particulars which They fancied to be Conveniences.
But it was enough that the King so well liked the Advice upon Conference
with them three, that He resolved to communicate it with no others; but
appointed that when the Bill for Supply should be brought into the House
(it being to be, as was said before, for the Sum of—), at the Com∣mitment<MILESTONE N="20"/>
<HI>Downing</HI> should offer that <HI>Proviso,</HI> which had been drawn by him∣self,
and read to the King and the other two. And because it was fore∣seen,
that it would be opposed by many of those who were known to be
very affectionate to the King's Service, They had all Authority privately
to assure them, that it was offered with the King's Approbation.</P>
<P>AGAINST the Time that the Bill was to be brought in, They prepared
the House by many unseasonable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Clamour raised against the Bankers.</NOTE> bitter Invectives against the Bankers,
called them Cheats, Bloodsuckers, Extortioners, and loaded them with all
the Reproaches which can be cast upon the worst Men in the World, and
would have them looked upon as the Causes of all the King's Necessities,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and of the Want of Monies throughout the Kingdom: All which was a
plausible Argument, as all Invectives against particular Men are; and all
Men who had Faculties of depraving, and of making ill Things appear
worse than they are, were easily engaged with them. The Bankers did not
consist of above the Number of five or six Men, some whereof were Al∣dermen
and had been Lord-Mayors of <HI>London,</HI> and all the rest were Al∣dermen
or had fined for Aldermen. They were a Tribe that had risen
and grown up in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, and never were heard of before the
late Troubles, till when the whole Trade of Money had passed through
the Hands of the Scriveners: They were for the most Part Goldsmiths,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Men known to be so rich, and of so good Reputation, that all the Mo∣ney
of the Kingdom would be trusted or deposited in their Hands.</P>
<P>FROM the Time of the King's Return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Advantage arising from the Bankers.</NOTE> when though great and vast Sums
were granted, yet such vast Debts were presently to be paid, the Armies
by Land and Sea to be presently discharged, that the Money that was to be
collected in six and six Months would not provide for those present unavoid∣able
Issues; but there must be two or three hundred thousand Pounds gotten
together in few Days, before They could begin to disband the Armies or to
pay the Seamen off; the deferring whereof every Month increased the
Charge to an incredible Proportion: None could supply those Occasions<MILESTONE N="50"/>
but the Bankers, which brought the King's Ministers first acquainted with
them; and They were so well satisfied with their Proceedings, that They
did always declare, “that They were so necessary to the King's Affairs,
<PB N="315" REF="319"/>
that They knew not how to have conducted them without that As∣sistance.”</P>
<P>THE Method of Proceeding with them was thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Method of treating with them.</NOTE> As soon as an Act of
Parliament was passed, the King sent for those Bankers (for there was never
any Contract made with them but in his Majesty's Presence): And He being
attended by the Ministers of the Revenue, and commonly the Chancellor and
others of the Council, the Lord Treasurer presented a particular Informa∣tion
to the King of the most urgent Occasions for present Money, either
for disbanding Troops, or discharging Ships, or setting out Fleets (all which
<MILESTONE N="10"/>are to be done together and not by Parcels); so that it was easily foreseen
what ready Money must be provided. And this Account being made, the
Bankers were called in, and told, “that the King had Occasion to use such
a Sum of ready Money within such a Day; They understood the Act of
Parliament, and so might determine what Money They could lend the King,
and what Manner of Security would best satisfy them.” Whereupon one
said, “He would within such a Time pay one hundred thousand Pounds,”
another more, and another less, as They found themselves provided; for there
was no joint Stock amongst them, but every one supplied according to his
Ability. They were desirous to have eight in the Hundred, which was
<MILESTONE N="20"/>not unreasonable to ask and the King was willing to give: But upon better
Consideration amongst themselves, They thought fit to decline that De∣mand
as being capable of turning to their Disadvantage, and would leave
the Interest to the King's own Bounty, declaring “that themselves paid six
in the hundred for all the Money with which They were intrusted,”
which was known to be true.</P>
<P>THEN They demanded such a Receipt and Assignment to be made to
them by the Lord Treasurer, for the Payment of the first Money that
should be payable upon that Act of Parliament, or a Branch of that Act,
or Tallies upon the Farmers of the Customs or Excise, or such other
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Branches of the Revenue as were least charged; having the King's own
Word and the Faith of the Treasurer, that they should be exactly com∣plied
with; for let the Security be what They could desire, it would still be
in the Power of the King or of the Lord Treasurer to divert what was as∣signed
to them to other Purposes. Therefore there is Nothing surer, than
that the Confidence in the King's Justice, and the unquestionable Repu∣tation
of the Lord Treasurer's Honour and Integrity, was the true Foun∣dation
of that Credit which supplied all his Majesty's Necessities and Occa∣sions;
and his Majesty always treated those Men very graciously as his very
good Servants, and all his Ministers looked upon them as very honest
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and valuable Men. And in this Manner for many Years after his Majesty's
Return, even to the unhappy Beginning of the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, the publick Ex∣penses
were carried on, it may be, with too little Difficulty, which possibly
increased some Expenses; and Nobody opened his Mouth against the
Bankers, who every Day increased in Credit and Reputation, and had the
Money of all Men at their Disposal.</P>
<P>THE Solicitor General brought in the Bill for Supply according to Course,
in that Form as those Bills for Money ought and used to be: And after it
had been read the second Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Downing <HI>of∣fers a new</HI> Proviso <HI>in the Bill for the Supply.</HI></NOTE> when it was committed <HI>Downing</HI> offered
his <HI>Proviso,</HI> the End of which was, “to make all the Money that was
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to be raised by this Bill to be applied only to those Ends to which it
was given, which was the carrying on the War, and to no other Pur∣pose
whatsoever, by what Authority soever;” with many other Clauses
in it so monstrous, that the Solicitor and many others who were most
<PB N="316" REF="320"/>
watchful for the King's Service declared against it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is op∣posed by the Solicitor Ge∣neral.</NOTE> as introductive to a
Commonwealth, and not fit for Monarchy. It was observed, “that the
Assignment of the Money that was given by Act of Parliament to be paid
in another Manner and to other Persons than had been formerly used,
though there wanted not plausible Pretences, was the Beginning of the
late Rebellion, and furnished the Parliament with Money to raise a Re∣bellion,
when the King had none to defend himself; which had made
<HI>Cromwell</HI> wise enough never to permit any of those Clauses, or that
the Impositions which were raised should be disposed to any Uses or by
any Persons but by himself and his own Orders.” And by such and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
other Arguments, which the Contrivers had not foreseen, the <HI>Proviso</HI> had
been absolutely thrown out, if Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> and <HI>Downing</HI> had not
gone to the Solicitor and others who spake against it, and assured them,
“that it was brought in by the King's own Direction, and for Purposes well
understood by his Majesty.” Upon which They were contented that it
should be committed, yet with Direction “that such and such Expressions
should be reformed and amended.”</P>
<P>IN the Afternoon the King sent for the Solicitor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King com∣mands him not to oppose it farther.</NOTE> and forbad him any
more to oppose that <HI>Proviso,</HI> for that it was much for his Service. And
when He would inform him of many Mischiefs which would inevitably at∣tend<MILESTONE N="20"/>
it, some were of those which He had no Mind to prevent, being to lessen
their Power who He thought had too much, and the other He cared not to
hear; and said only, “that He would bear the Inconveniences which would
ensue upon his own Account, for the Benefits which would accrue, and
which it was not yet seasonable to communicate with other Members of
the House of Commons, whom He thought not to be so able to dispute
it with him.”<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">SOMETHING seems to be wanting here to make the Sense clear. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether what follows was spoken by <HI>Downing</HI> to the King, <HI>Arlington</HI> and <HI>Coventry;</HI> or, by the King to the Solicitor. In the latter Case, <HI>told them</HI> (as it is in the <HI>M. S.</HI>) should be altered to <HI>told him.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>HE enlarged more in Discourse, and told them, “that this would be an
Encouragement to lend Money, by making the Payment with Interest so
certain and fixed, that there could be no Security in the Kingdom like<MILESTONE N="30"/>
it, when it should be out of any Man's Power to cause any Money that
should be lent To-morrow to be paid before that which was lent Yes∣terday,
but that all should be infallibly paid in Order; by which the Ex∣chequer
(which was now Bankrupt and without any Credit) would be
quickly in that Reputation, that all Men would deposite their Money
there: And that He hoped in few Years, by observing the Method He
now proposed, He would make his Exchequer the best and the greatest
Bank in <HI>Europe,</HI> and where all <HI>Europe</HI> would, when it was once under∣stood,
pay in their Money for the certain Profit it would yield, and the
indubitable Certainty that They should receive their Money.” And with<MILESTONE N="40"/>
this Discourse the vain Man, who had lived many Years in <HI>Holland,</HI> and
would be thought to have made himself Master of all their Policy, had
amused the King, and his two Friends, undertaking to erect the King's
Exchequer into the same Degree of Credit that the Bank of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> stood
upon, the Institution whereof He undertook to know, and from thence to
make it evident, “that all that should be transplanted into <HI>England,</HI> and
all Nations would sooner send their Money into the Exchequer, than into
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> or <HI>Genoa</HI> or <HI>Venice.</HI>” And it cannot be enough wondered
at, that this Intoxication prevailed so far that no Argument would be heard
against it, the King having upon those Notions, and with the Advice of<MILESTONE N="50"/>
those Counsellors, in his own Thoughts new-modelled the whole Govern∣ment
<PB N="317" REF="321"/>
of his Treasury, in which He resolved to have no more superiour Of∣ficers.
But this was only reserved within his own Breast, and not com∣municated
to any but those who devised the Project, without weighing that
the Security for Monies so deposited in Banks is the Republick itself, which
must expire before that Security can fail; which can never be depended on
in a Monarchy, where the Monarch's sole Word can cancel all those formal
Provisions which can be made (as hath since been too evident), by vacating
those Assignations which have been made upon that and the like Acts of
Parliament, for such Time as the present Necessities have made counsellable;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>which would not then be admitted to be possible.</P>
<P>AND so without any more Opposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is passed by the Commons.</NOTE> which was not grateful to the
King, that Act passed the House of Commons, with the Correction only of
such Absurdities as had not been foreseen by those who framed the <HI>Proviso,</HI>
and which did indeed cross their own Designs: And so it was sent from the
Commons to the House of Peers for their Consent.</P>
<P>BILLS of that Nature which concern the raising of Money seldom stay
long with the Lords; but as of Custom, which They call Privilege, they
are first begun in the House of Commons, where they endure long Deli∣beration,
so when they are adjusted there, they seem to pass through the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>House of Peers with the reading twice and formal Commitment, in which
any Alterations are very rarely made, except in any Impositions which are
laid upon their own Persons, for which there are usually Blanks left, the
filling up whereof is all the Amendment or Alteration that is commonly
made by the Lords: So that the same Engrossment that is sent up by the
Commons is usually the Bill itself that is presented to the King for his Royal
Assent. Yet there can be no reasonable Doubt made, but that those Bills
of any Kind of Subsidies, as Excise, Chimney-Money, or any other Way
of Imposition, are as much the Gift and Present from the House of Peers as
they are from the House of Commons, and are no more valid without their
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Consent than without the Consent of the other; and They may alter any
Clause in them that They do not think for the Good of the People. But be∣cause
the House of Commons is the immediate Representative of the Peo∣ple,
it is presumed that They best know what They can bear or are willing
to submit to, and what They propose to give is proportionable to what
They can spare; and therefore the Lords use not to put any Stop in the
Passage of such Bills, much less diminish what is offered by them to
the King.</P>
<P>AND in this Parliament the Expedition that was used in all Business out
of Fear of the Sickness, and out of an impatient Desire to be separated, was
<MILESTONE N="40"/>very notorious: And as soon as this Bill for Supply was sent to the Lords,
very many Members of the House of Commons left the Town and departed,
conceiving that there was no more left for them to do; for it was gene∣rally
thought, that at the passing that Act with the rest which were ready,
the King would prorogue the Parliament. Yet the Novelty in this Act so
surprised the Lords, that They thought it worthy a very serious Deliberation,
and used not their customary Expedition in the passing it. It happened
to be in an ill Conjuncture, when the terrible cold Weather kept the Lord
Treasurer from going out of his Chamber for Fear of the Gout, of which
the Chancellor laboured then in that Extremity, that He was obliged to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>remain in his Bed; and neither of them had received Information of this
Affair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Lords re∣monstrate to the King a∣gainst this Pro∣viso.</NOTE> Many of the Lords came to them and advertised them of this new
<HI>Proviso;</HI> and some of them went to the King to let him know the Pre∣judice
<PB N="318" REF="322"/>
it would bring him, and censured the ill Hand that had con∣trived
it.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and had been
privy in the first Cabal in which this Reformation was designed, whether
because He found himself left out in the most secret Part of it, or not enough
considered in it, passionately inveighed against it both publickly and pri∣vately,
and according to the Fertility of his Wit and Invention found more
Objections against it than any Body else had done, and the Consequences to
be more destructive; with which He so alarmed the King, that his Ma∣jesty
was contented that the Matter should be debated in his Presence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con∣sults the pri∣vate Commit∣tee upon it.</NOTE> and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
because the Chancellor was in his Bed, thought his Chamber to be the fittest
Place for the Consultation: And the Lord Treasurer, though indisposed and
apprehensive of the Gout, could yet use his Feet, and was very willing to
attend his Majesty there, without the least Imagination that He was aimed
at in the least.</P>
<P>THE King appointed the Hour for the Meeting, where his Majesty with
his Brother was present, the Chancellor in his Bed, the Lord Treasurer, the
Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry;</HI> the Attorney
General and the Solicitor were likewise present to word any Alterations which
should be fit to be made; and Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> likewise attended, who the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
King still believed would be able to answer all Objections which could be
made. The Chancellor had never seen the <HI>Proviso</HI> which contained all the
Novelty (for all the other Parts of the Bill were according to the Course),
and the Treasurer had read it only an Hour or two before the Meeting:
The Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> therefore, who had heard it read in the House of Peers and
observed what that House thought of it, opened the whole Business with
the Novelty, and the ill Consequence that must inevitably attend it; all
which He enforced with great Clearness and Evidence of Reason, and would
have enlarged with some Sharpness upon the Advisers of it.</P>
<P>BUT the King himself stopped that by declaring, “that whatsoever had<MILESTONE N="30"/>
been done in the whole Transaction of it had been with his Privity and
Approbation, and the whole Blame must be laid to his own Charge, who
it seems was like to suffer most by it.” He confessed, “He was so fully
convinced in his own Understanding, that the Method proposed would
prove to his infinite Advantage and to the Benefit of the Kingdom, that
He had converted many in the House who had disliked it; and that since
it came into the House of Peers, He had spoken with many of the Lords
who seemed most unsatisfied with it: And He was confident He had so
well informed many of them, that They had changed their Opinion and
would be no more against that <HI>Proviso.</HI> However He confessed that<MILESTONE N="40"/>
some remained still obstinate against it, and They had given some Reasons
which He had not thought of, and which in Truth He could not answer:
He wished therefore that They would apply themselves to the most
weighty Objections which were in View, or which might probably
result from thence, and think of the best Remedies which might be ap∣plied
by Alterations and Amendments in the House of Lords, which He
doubted not but that the Commons would concur in.”</P>
<P>THE first Objection was “the Novelty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections made against it there.</NOTE> which in Cases of that Nature
was very dangerous, remembering what hath been mentioned before of
the Beginning of the late Rebellion, by putting the Money to run in ano∣ther<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Channel than it had used to do: And that when once such a Clause
was admitted in one Bill, the King would hardly get it left out in others
of the same Kind hereafter; and so his Majesty should never be Master
<PB N="319" REF="323"/>
his own Money, nor the Ministers of his Revenue be able to assign Mo∣nies
to defray any casual Expenses of what Nature soever; but that upon
the Matter the Authority of the Treasurer and Chancellor of the Exche∣quer
must be invested in the Tellers of the Exchequer, who were subor∣dinate
Officers, and qualified to do Nothing but by the immediate Order
of those their superiour Officers. And though there are four Tellers in
equal Authority, yet Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> would in a short Time make
his Office the sole Receipt, and the rest neither receive nor pay but by
his Favour and Consent.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THE King had in his Nature so little Reverence or Esteem for Antiquity,
and did in Truth so much contemn old Orders, Forms and Institutions,
that the Objections of Novelty rather advanced than obstructed any Proposi∣tion.
He was a great Lover of new Inventions, and thought them the Effects
of Wit and Spirit, and fit to control the superstitious Observation of the Dic∣tates
of our Ancestors: So that Objection made little Impression. And for
the Continuance of the same Clause in future Bills, He looked for it as
necessary in Order to the Establishment of his Bank, which would abun∣dantly
recompense for his Loss of Power in Disposal of his own Money.
And though it was made appear by very solid Arguments, that the Ima∣gination
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of a Bank was a mere Chimera in itself, and the erecting it in the
Exchequer must suppose that the Crown must be always liable to a vast
Debt upon Interest, which would be very ill Husbandry; and that there
was great Hope, that after a happy Peace should be concluded, and Care
should be taken to bring the Expenses into a narrower Compass, the King
might in a short Time be out of Debt: Yet all Discourse against a Bank was
thought to proceed from pure Ignorance. And Sir <HI>George</HI> was let loose to in∣struct
them how easy it was to be established, who talked imperiously “of the
Method by which it came to be settled in <HI>Holland</HI> by the Industry of very
few Persons, when the greatest Men despaired of it as impracticable; yet the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Obstinacy of the other prevailed, and it was now become the Strength,
Wealth and Security of the State: That the same would be brought to
pass much more easily here, and would be no sooner done, than <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
would be the Seat of all the Trade of <HI>Christendom.</HI>” And then
assuming all He said to be Demonstration, He wrapped himself up, ac∣cording
to his Custom, in a Mist of Words that Nobody could see Light
in, but They who by often hearing the same Chat thought They under∣stood
it.</P>
<P>THE next Objection was “against the Injustice of this Clause, and the
ill Consequence of that Injustice. The Necessities of the Crown being
<MILESTONE N="40"/>still pressing, and the Fleet every Day calling for Supply, Money had
been borrowed from the Bankers upon the Credit of this Bill, as soon as
the first Vote had passed in the House of Commons for so considerable a
Supply; and the Treasurer had made Assignments upon several Branches
of the Revenue, which had been preserved and designed for the Army
and the immediate Expenses of the King's and Queen's Houshold, and
the like unavoidable Issues, upon Presumption that enough would come
in from this new Act of Parliament to be replaced to those Purposes, be∣fore
the Time that would require it should come. But by this <HI>Proviso</HI>
especial Care was taken, that none of the Money that should be raised
<MILESTONE N="50"/>should be applied to the Payment of any Debt that was contracted before
the Royal Assent was given to the Bill: So that both the Money lent by
the Bankers upon the Promise made to them must be unpaid and unse∣cured,
and the Money that had been supplied from other Assignations
<PB N="320" REF="324"/>
must not be applied to the original Use; by which the Army and Hous∣hold
would be unprovided for, the Inconvenience whereof had no Need of
an Enlargement.”</P>
<P>“BESIDES that the Bankers had the King's Word, and the Engagement
of the Ministers of the Revenue, that all new Bills of Supply should still
make good what former Securities were not sufficient to do; as by this
heavy Visitation of the Plague, the Assignations which had been made
upon the Excise and Chimney-Money, and by the Decay of Trade that
the War and Sickness together had produced, the Assignations made upon
the Customs, had brought in so little Money, that the Debt to the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Bankers, which but for those Obstructions might by this Time have been
much abated, remained still very little less than it was near a Year be∣fore.
And when it should be known, that this Sum of Money that was
to be raised was exempt from the Payment of any of those and the like
Debts, it would be a great Heartbreaking to all those, who had not only
lent all their own Estates, but the whole Estates of many thousands of
other Men, to the King, and must expect to be called upon by all who
have trusted them for their Money, which by this Invention They have
no Means to pay: And for the future, let the Necessities be what they
will that the Crown may be involved in, there is no Hope of borrowing<MILESTONE N="20"/>
any Money, since it is not in the Power of the King himself to make any
Assignment upon this new Imposition.”</P>
<P>VERY much of this had been so absolutely unthought of by the King,
that He was very much troubled at it; and He had in his own Judgment
a just Esteem of the Bankers, and looked upon any Prejudice that They
should suffer as hurtful to himself, and a great Violation of his Honour and
Justice. But it was plain enough that the principal Design of the Contrivers
was to prejudice the Bankers, nor did They care what Ruin befell them,
and so talked loosely and bitterly “of their cozening the King, and what
ill Bargains had been made with them;” though it was made manifest,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that no private Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> did upon any real or personal Secu∣rity
borrow Money, but considering the Brocage He pays, and the often
renewing his Security, it costs him yearly much more than the King paid
to the Bankers.</P>
<P>THEY slighted what was past as sufficiently provided for; and for the
future confidently undertook the King should never more have Need of the
Bankers, “for that this Act would be no sooner passed, but upon the
Credit of it Money would be poured into the Exchequer faster than it
could be told.” And when They were told, “that Expectation would
deceive them, and that great Sums would not come in, and small Sums<MILESTONE N="40"/>
would do Hurt, because they would but stop up the Security from
giving Satisfaction to others, because whatever was first paid in must be
first paid:” All this was answered confidently, “that vast Sums were
ready to their Knowledge to be paid in as soon as the Bill should pass;”
which fell out as was foretold. For after ten or twenty thousand Pounds
were delivered in by themselves and their Friends to save their Credit, there
was no more Money like to come; and that Sum did more Harm than
Good, by interrupting the Security.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all their Answers, the King remained unsatisfied in
many Particulars which He had not foreseen, and wished “that the Matter<MILESTONE N="50"/>
had been better consulted;” and confessed “that <HI>Downing</HI> had not an∣swered
many of the Objections;” and wished “that Alterations might be
prepared to be offered in the House of Peers as Amendments, and trans∣mitted
<PB N="321" REF="325"/>
to the Commons, without casting out the <HI>Proviso;</HI>” the Founda∣tion
and End of which still pleased him for those Reasons which He would
not communicate, and for which only it ought to have been rejected. But
as it had been very easy to have had it quite left out, which was the only
proper Remedy; so the mending it would leave much Argument for De∣bate,
and would spend much Time. And it was to be apprehended, that
there were so many of the best affected Members of the House of Com∣mons
gone out of the Town as having no more to do, that when it should
be sent down thither again, it might be longer delayed there than would
<MILESTONE N="10"/>be convenient for the Publick; and so the Parliament be kept longer from
a Prorogation, than would be grateful to them or agreeable to the King.</P>
<P>AND therefore upon the whole Matter his Majesty chose that no Inter∣ruption
should be given to it in the House of Peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is passed by the Lords.</NOTE> and only such small
Amendments, which would be as soon consented to in Both Houses as
read, should be offered, rather than run the other Hazard of Delay: And
so accordingly it was passed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment pro∣rogued.</NOTE> and upon the doing thereof, the Parliament
was prorogued to <HI>April</HI> following.</P>
<P>IN this Debate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King much offend∣ed with the Chancellor in this Affair.</NOTE> upon the insolent Behaviour of <HI>Downing</HI> in the De∣fence
of that which could not be defended, and it may be out of the Ex∣tremity
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of the Pain which at that Time He endured in his Bed, the Chan∣cellor
had given some very sharp Reprehensions to <HI>Downing,</HI> for his Pre∣sumption
in undertaking to set such a Design on Foot that concerned the
whole Fabrick of the Exchequer (in which He was an inferiour Officer),
and such a Branch of the King's Revenue, without first communicating it
to his superiour Officers and receiving their Advice; and told him, “that
it was impossible for the King to be well served, whilst Fellows of his
Condition were admitted to speak as much as They had a Mind to;
and that in the best Times such Presumptions had been punished with Im∣prisonment
by the Lords of the Council, without the King's taking Notice
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of it:” Which, with what Sharpness soever uttered (in which He natu∣rally
exceeded in such Occasions), in a Case of this Nature, in which
with Reference to any Disrespect towards himself He was not concerned,
He thought did not exceed the Privilege and Dignity of the Place He
held; and for which there were many Precedents in the past Times.</P>
<P>AT the present there was no Notice taken, nor Reply made to what
He said. But They who knew themselves equally guilty, and believed
They were reflected upon, found quickly Opportunity to incense the King,
and to persuade him to believe, “that the Chancellor's Behaviour was a
greater Affront to him than to <HI>Downing:</HI> That a Servant should undergo
<MILESTONE N="40"/>such Reproaches in the King's own Presence, for no other Reason but
having with all Humility presented an Information to his Majesty, which
was natural for him to understand in the Office in which He served him,
and afterwards followed and observed the Orders and Directions which
himself had prescribed; that this must terrify all Men from giving the
King any Light in his Affairs, that He may know Nothing of his own
nearest Concernments but what his chief Ministers thought fit to impart
to him.” All which, and whatsoever else was natural to Wit sharpened
with Malice to suggest upon such an Argument, They enforced with
Warmth that They desired might be taken for Zeal for his Service and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Dignity, which was prostituted by those Presumptions of the Chancellor.</P>
<P>AND herewith They so inflamed the King that He was much offended,
and expressed to them such a Dislike that pleased them well, and gave
them Opportunity to add more Fewel to the Fire; and told them, “that
<PB N="322" REF="326"/>
the Chancellor should find that He was not pleased,” as indeed He did by
a greater Reservedness in his Countenance than his Majesty used to carry to∣wards
him; the Reason whereof his Innocence kept him from comprehend∣ing,
till in a short Time He vouchsafed plainly to put him in Mind of his
Behaviour at that Time, and to express a great Resentment of it, and urged
all those Glosses which had been made to him upon it, and “what Inter∣pretation
all Men must make of such an Action, and be terrified by it
from offering any Thing, of what Importance soever to his Service, if it
would offend his Ministers;” and all this in a Choler very unnatural to
him, which exceedingly troubled the Chancellor, and made him more dis∣cern,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
though He had Evidence enough of it before, that He stood upon
very slippery Ground.</P>
<P>HE told his Majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor satisfies his Majesty.</NOTE> “that since He thought his Behaviour to be so bad
in that Particular, for which till then his own Conscience or Discretion
had not reproached him, He must and did believe He had committed
a great Fault, for which He did humbly ask his Pardon; and promised
hereafter no more to incur his Displeasure for such Excesses, which He
could never have fallen into at that Time and upon that Occasion, but
upon the Presumption, that it had been impossible for his Majesty to
have made that Interpretation of it which it seems He had done, or<MILESTONE N="20"/>
that any Body could have Credit enough with him to persuade him to
believe, that He desired that his Majesty should not have a clear View,
and the most discerning Insight, into the darkest and most intricate
Parts of all his Affairs, which They knew in their Consciences to be
most untrue. And He must with great Confidence appeal to his Ma∣jesty,
who knew how much He had desired, and taken some Pains,
that his Majesty might never set his Hand to any Thing, before He fully
understood it upon such References and Reports, as, according to the
Nature of the Business, were to be for his full Information.”</P>
<P>HE besought him to remember “how often He had told him, <HI>that it was<MILESTONE N="30"/>
most absolutely necessary that He should make himself entirely Master of his own
Business, for that there would be no Acquiescence in any Judgment but his own;</HI>
and that his Majesty knew with what Boldness He had often lamented to
himself, <HI>that He would not take the Pains perfectly to understand all his
own Affairs, which exposed his Ministers to the Censures of half-witted Men,
and was the greatest Discouragement to all who served him honestly:</HI> And
He desired his Pardon again for saying that. He would hereafter find that
They who had advised him in this late Transaction, in the handling
whereof He had taken the Liberty that had offended his Majesty, had but
a very dim Insight into that Business which They took upon themselves<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to direct.”</P>
<P>BUT his Majesty was not willing to enter again into that Discourse, and
concluded with forbidding him to believe, “that it was or could be in any
Mens Power to make him suspect his Affection or Integrity to his Ser∣vice,”
and used many other very gracious Expressions to him, nor ever
after seemed to remember that Action to his Prejudice. But within a short
Time the Bishoprick of <HI>Salisbury</HI> becoming void by the never enough la∣mented
Death of Dr. <HI>Earle,</HI> his Majesty conferred that Bishoprick upon Dr.
<HI>Hyde,</HI> the Dean of <HI>Winchester,</HI> upon the Chancellor's Recommendation,
whose near Kinsman He was. Nor was his Credit with the King thought<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to be lessened by any Body but himself, who knew more to that Purpose
than other People could do: Yet He judged more from the Credit that
He found his Enemies got every Day, than from the King's withdrawing
<PB N="323" REF="327"/>
his Trust and Kindness from him; nor did the King believe that They had
then that Design against him, which shortly after They did not dissemble.</P>
<P>THE Purpose of making the Alteration in the Government of the Trea∣sury
was pursued very industriously.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King per∣suaded to desire the Treasurer would resign.</NOTE> And since that <HI>Proviso</HI> with all the
Circumstances thereof had not produced the Effect They proposed, for
They had believed that the Indignity of the Affront would have wrought
so far upon the great Heart of the Treasurer, that He would thereupon have
given up his Staff; which He was too much inclined to have done, if He
had not been prevailed with by those who He knew were his Friends, not to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>gratify those who desired him out of their Way, in doing that which They
of all Things wished: Therefore that Plot not succeeding, They per∣suaded
the King to try another Expedient. For They all knew, that it was
too envious a Thing for his Majesty himself to remove him from his Office
by any Act of his, and that it would be loudly imputed to them. But if
He could be himself persuaded to quit that which every Body knew He was
weary of, it would prevent all Inconveniences: And They had been told
that the Chancellor only had dissuaded him from doing it, which He would
not presume to do, if He were clearly told that the King desired that He
should give it up.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>HEREUPON the King one Day called the Chancellor to him, and told him,
“that He must speak with him in a Business of great Confidence, and which
required great Secrecy;” and then enlarged in a great Commendation of the
Treasurer (whom in Truth He did very much esteem), “of his great Parts
of Judgment, of his unquestionable Integrity, and of his general Interest and
Reputation throughout the Kingdom. But with all this” He said “He was
not fit for the Office He held: That He did not understand the Mystery
of that Place, nor could in his Nature go through with the necessary Obli∣gations
of it. That his bodily Infirmities were such, that many Times
He could not be spoken with for two or three Days, so that there could
<MILESTONE N="30"/>be no Dispatch; of which every Body complained, and by which his Bu∣siness
suffered very much. That all Men knew that all the Business was
done by Sir <HI>Philip Warwick,</HI> whom, though He was a very honest Man,
He did not think fit to be Treasurer; which He was to all Effects, the
Treasurer himself doing Nothing but signing the Papers which the other
prepared for him, which was neither for the King's Honour nor his.”
The Truth was, that his Understanding was too fine for such gross Matters
as that Office must be conversant about, and that if his Want of Health did
not hinder him, his Genius did not carry him that Way; nor would the
Laziness of his Nature permit him to take that Pains, that was absolutely
<MILESTONE N="40"/>necessary for the well discharging that great Office.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty concluded, “that He loved him too well to disoblige him,
and would never do any Thing that would not be grateful to him: But
He had some Reason, even from what He had sometimes said to him, to
think that He was weary of it, and might be easily persuaded to deliver
up his Staff, which his Majesty would be very glad of; and therefore
He wished that He,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King wish∣es the Chan∣cellor to advise him to it.</NOTE> the Chancellor, who was known to have most In∣terest
in him, would persuade him to it, in which He would do his
Majesty a singular Service.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor presently asked him, “if He were so unfit, whom
<MILESTONE N="50"/>He would make Treasurer in his Room.” The King as presently an∣swered,
“that He would never make another Treasurer, which was an Of∣fice
of great Charge, and would be much more effectually executed by
Commissioners; which had been done in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, as many
<PB N="324" REF="328"/>
Offices had been: And that his Majesty found by Experience, that in
Offices of that Kind Commissioners were better than single Officers; for
though Sir <HI>William Compton</HI> was a very extraordinary Man, of great In∣dustry
and Fidelity, yet that the Office of the Ordnance was neither in so
good Order nor so thristily managed whilst He was Master of it, as it hath
been since his Death, since when it hath been governed by Commissioners;
and so He was well assured his Treasury would be.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor replied, “that He was very sorry to find his Majesty so
much inclined to Commissioners, who were indeed fittest to execute all
Offices according to the Model of a Commonwealth, but not at all agree∣able<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to Monarchy: That if He thought the Precedent of <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time
fit to be followed, He should be in the Posture that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was, with
an Army of one hundred thousand Men, which made him have no Need
of the Authority and Reputation of a Treasurer, either to settle his Re∣venue
or to direct the levying it; He could do Both best himself.” But
He very passionately besought his Majesty to believe, “that They who ad∣vised
him to this Method of Government, though They might have good
Affection to his Person and his Service, were very unskilful in the Con∣stitution
of this Kingdom and in the Nature of the People. That the
Office of Treasurer had sometimes upon the Death of a present Officer<MILESTONE N="20"/>
been executed by Commissioners, but very seldom for any Time, or
longer than whilst the King could deliberately make Choice of a fit Mi∣nister.
That himself had been twice a Commissioner for the Treasury,
once in the Time of his Father, and again upon his Majesty's Return:
And therefore that He could upon Experience assure him, that Commis∣sioners,
in so active a Time as this, could never discharge the Duty of that
Office; and that the Dignity of the Person of the Treasurer was most ne∣cessary
for his Service, both towards the procuring the raising of Money in
Parliament, and the improving his Revenue by the Grant of Additions
there, as likewise for the collecting and conducting it afterwards. For the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
present Treasurer,” He said, “there was no Question but if He knew that
his Majesty was weary of his Service, and wished to have the Staff out of
his Hand, He would most readily deliver it: But that They who gave the
Counsel, and thought it fit for his Majesty's Service, were much fitter
to give him that Advertisement, than He who in his Conscience did be∣lieve,
that the following it would be of the most pernicious Consequence
to his Service of any Thing that could be done.”</P>
<P>HE most humbly and with much Earnestness besought his Majesty
seriously to reflect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor earnestly petitions him against this Measure.</NOTE> what an ill Savour it would have over the whole
Kingdom, at this Time of a War with at least two powerful Enemies<MILESTONE N="40"/>
abroad together, of so great Discontent and Jealousy at Home, and
when the Court was in no great Reputation with the People, to re∣move
a Person the most loved and reverenced by the People for his most
exemplary Fidelity and Wisdom, who had deserved as much from his
blessed Father and himself as a Subject can do from his Prince, a No∣bleman
of the best Quality, the best allied and the best beloved; to re∣move
at such a Time such a Person and with such Circumstances from
his Councils and his Trust: For Nobody could imagine, that, after such
a Manifestation of his Majesty's Displeasure, He would be again conver∣sant
in the Court or in the Council, Both which would be much less<MILESTONE N="50"/>
esteemed upon such an Action. That many with the same Diseases and
Infirmities had long executed that Office, which required more the Strength
<PB N="325" REF="329"/>
of the Mind than of the Body: All were obliged to attend him, and He
only to wait upon his Majesty.”</P>
<P>“THAT it was impossible for any Man to discharge that Office without
a Secretary: And if the whole Kingdom had been to have preferred a Se∣cretary
to him, They would have commended this Gentleman to him
whom He trusted, who had for many Years served a former Treasurer in
the same Trust, in the most malignant, captious and calumniating Time
that hath been known, and yet without the least Blemish or Imputation;
and who, ever since that Time, had served his Father in and to the End
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of the War, and himself since in the most secret and dangerous Affairs”
(for He had been trusted by the Persons of the greatest Quality to hold In∣telligence
with his Majesty to the Time of his Return); “so that all Men
rather expected to have found him preferred to some good Place, than
in the same Post He had been in twenty Years before; which He would
never have undertaken under any other Officer than one with whom He
had much Confidence, and who He knew would serve his Majesty so well.
Yet,” He said, “that whoever knew them could never believe that Sir
<HI>Philip Warwick</HI> could govern the Lord Treasurer.”</P>
<P>THE King said, “He had a very good Opinion of Sir <HI>Philip Warwick,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and had never heard any Thing to his Prejudice.” But upon the main
Point of the Debate He seemed rather moved and troubled than convinced,
when by good Fortune the Duke of <HI>York</HI> came into the Room, who had
been well prepared to like the King's Purpose and to believe it necessary;
and therefore his Majesty was glad of his Presence, and called him to him,
and told him what He had been speaking of; and the Chancellor informed
him of all that had passed between the King and him, and told him, “that
He could never do a better Service to the King his Brother, than by
using his Credit with him to restrain him from prosecuting a Purpose that
would prove so mischievous to him.” And so the Discourse was renewed:
<MILESTONE N="30"/>And in the End the Duke was so entirely converted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And at length prevails.</NOTE> that He prevailed with
his Majesty to lay aside the Thought of it; which so broke all the Measures
the other Contrivers had formed their Counsels by, that They were much
out of Countenance. But finding that They could not work upon the
Duke to change his Mind, and to return to the former Resolution, They
thought not fit to press the King farther for the present; and only made so
much Use of their Want of Success, by presenting to his Majesty his Irreso∣luteness,
which made the Chancellor still impose upon him, that the King
did not think the better of the Chancellor or the Treasurer, for his receding
at that Time from prosecuting what He had so positively resolved to have
<MILESTONE N="40"/>done, and promised them “to be firmer to his next Determination.”</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Christmas</HI> the Rage and Fury of the Pestilence began in some De∣gree
to be mitigated, but so little, that Nobody who had left the Town
had yet the Courage to return thither: Nor had They Reason; for though it
was a considerable Abatement from the Height it had been at, yet there died
still between three and four thousand in the Week, and of those, some Men
of better Condition than had fallen before. The General writ from thence,
that there still arose new Difficulties in providing for the setting out the
Fleet, and some of such a Nature, that He could not easily remove them
without Communication with his Majesty, and receiving his more positive
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Directions; and how to bring that to pass He knew not, for as He could
by no Means advise his Majesty to leave <HI>Oxford,</HI> so He found many Ob∣jections
against his own being absent from <HI>London.” Windsor</HI> was thought
upon as a Place where the King might safely reside, there being then no
<PB N="326" REF="330"/>
Infection there: But the King had adjourned the Term thither, which had
possessed the whole Town; and He was not without some Apprehension,
that the Plague had got into one House.</P>
<P>IN the End,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣moves from</HI> Oxford <HI>to</HI> Hampton-Court.</NOTE> towards the End of <HI>February,</HI> the King resolved that the
Queen and Dutchess and all their Families should remain in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and
that his Majesty and his Brother, with Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and such of his Coun∣cil
and other Servants as were thought necessary or fit, would make a quick
Journey to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> where the General might be every Day and
return again to <HI>London</HI> at Night, and his Majesty give such Orders as were
requisite for the carrying on his Service, and so after two or three Days<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Stay there return again to <HI>Oxford;</HI> for no Man did believe it counsell∣able,
that his Majesty should reside longer there, than the Dispatch of the
most important Business required: And with this Resolution his Majesty
made his Journey to <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI></P>
<P>IT pleased God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plague decreases.</NOTE> that the next Week after his Majesty came thither, the
Number of those who died of the Plague in the City decreased one thou∣sand;
and there was a strange universal Joy there for the King's being so
near. The Weather was as it could be wished, deep Snow and terrible
Frost, which very probably stopped the spreading of the Infection, though
it might put an End to those who were already infected, as it did, for in<MILESTONE N="20"/>
a Week or two the Number of the Dead was very little diminished. The
General came and went as was intended: But the Business every Day in∣creased;
and his Majesty's Remove to a farther Distance was thought in∣convenient,
since there appeared no Danger in remaining where He was.</P>
<P>AND after a Fortnight's or three Weeks Stay,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King returns to</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE> He resolved, for the quicker
Dispatch of all that was to be done, to go to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> when there died
above fifteen hundred in the Week, and when there was not in a Day seen
a Coach in the Streets, but those which came in his Majesty's Train; so
much all Men were terrified from returning to a Place of so much Mor∣tality.
Yet it can hardly be imagined, what Numbers flocked thither from<MILESTONE N="30"/>
all Parts upon the Fame of the King's being at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> all Men being
ashamed of their Fears for their own Safety, when the King ventured his
Person. The Judges at <HI>Windsor</HI> adjourned the last Return of the Term to
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and the Town every Day filled marvellously; and which
was more wonderful, the Plague every Day decreased. Upon which the
King changed his Purpose, and instead of returning to <HI>Oxford,</HI> sent for the
Queen and all the Family to come to <HI>Whitehall:</HI> So that before the End
of <HI>March</HI> the Streets were as full, the <HI>Exchange</HI> as much crowded, and the
People in all Places as numerous, as They had ever been seen, few Persons
missing any of their Acquaintance, though by the weekly Bills there ap∣peared<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to have died above one hundred and threescore thousand Persons:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Number supposed to have died of the Plague.</NOTE>
And many, who could compute very well, concluded that there were in
Truth double that Number who died; and that in one Week, when the
Bill mentioned only six thousand, there had in Truth fourteen thousand
died. The frequent Deaths of the Clerks and Sextons of Parishes hindered
the exact Account of every Week; but that which left it without any
Certainty was the vast Number that was buried in the Fields, of which no
Account was kept. Then of the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> and other Secta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, who
abounded in the City, very few left their Habitations; and Multitudes of
them died, whereof no Church-warden or other Officer had Notice; but<MILESTONE N="50"/>
They found Burials, according to their own Fancies, in small Gardens or the
next Fields. The greatest Number of those who died consisted of Women
and Children, and the lowest and poorest Sort of the People: So that, as I
<PB N="327" REF="331"/>
said before, few Men missed any of their Acquaintance when They returned,
not many of Wealth or Quality or of much Conversation being dead; yet
some of either Sort there were.</P>
<P>THE Business of the King and of all about him was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations for setting out the Fleet a∣gain.</NOTE> that the Fleet might
be ready and at Sea with all the possible Expedition: And in or towards this
there was less Disturbance and Interruption than could reasonably have been
expected, an universal Cheerfulness appearing in all who could obstruct or
contribute towards it, the People generally being abundantly satisfied in the
King's Choice of the Commanders. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was very much beloved,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>for his confessed Courage, by the Seamen; and the People believed that They
could not but have the Victory where the General commanded, who only
underwent Unquietness and Vexation from the tempestuous Humour of his
Wife. She, from his Return from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and from the Time that She
had the first Intimation that the King had designed her Husband for the
Command of the Fleet, was all Storm and Fury; and, according to the
Wisdom and Modesty of her Nature, poured out a thousand full-mouthed
Curses against all those who had contributed to that Counsel: But the Ma∣lice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of all that Tempest fell upon the Chancellor. She declared, “that
this was a Plot of his to remove her Husband from the King, that He
<MILESTONE N="20"/>might do what He had a Mind to;” and threw all the ill Words at him
which She had been accustomed to hear, accompanied with her good Wishes
of what She would have befall him. But the Company She kept, and the
Conversation She was accustomed to, could not propagate the Reproaches
far; and the poor General himself felt them most, who knew the Chan∣cellor
to be his very fast and faithful Friend, and that He would not be less
so because his Wife was no wiser than She was born to be. He was inde∣fatigable
in taking Pains Night and Day, that the Fleet might be at Sea.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Fleet pre∣pared.</HI></NOTE> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> was already gone to <HI>Brest,</HI>
and had taken Leave of the King at <HI>Paris,</HI> whither He was not to return
<MILESTONE N="30"/>till after the Summer's Service at Sea, and had appointed a Rendezvous of
all the Ships to be at <HI>Brest</HI> by the Middle of <HI>March,</HI> which They reported
should confist of fifty Ships of War.</P>
<P>THE Rupture was declared on Both Sides with <HI>Denmark.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Denmark <HI>joins the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> That King
had appeared much troubled at the ill Accident at <HI>Bergen,</HI> which had fallen
out merely by the Accidents of Weather, which had hindered the positive
Orders from arriving in the precise Time: And He seemed still resolved to
detain the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships there, and only to fear the Conjunction of the <HI>Swede</HI>
with the <HI>Hollander,</HI> which the King's Agent, Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> assured
him He need not to fear. Which the better to confirm, Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> who
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had been present at <HI>Bergen,</HI> and is before mentioned to be sent after that
by the King to <HI>Denmark,</HI> went from thence into <HI>Sweden</HI> (where Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI>
yet remained) with a Project of such a Treaty as would have been with little
Alterations consented to in <HI>Sweden,</HI> who had good Inclinations to the King,
and resolved to join with the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> when He should advance
according to his Engagement. But the <HI>Danish</HI> Resident in <HI>Sweden</HI> delayed
to conclude, and pretended to have received less positive Orders than the
Nature of the Affair required, and that He expected fuller: And so all
Matters were deferred, till Ambassadours came from <HI>Holland</HI> with no Ex∣postulations,
and a Desire to renew their Alliance, and release some Engage∣ments
<MILESTONE N="50"/>They had upon the <HI>Sound,</HI> which had been very grievous to the
<HI>Dane;</HI> and many other Conditions were granted which were very conve∣nient
to them. An Ambassadour likewise arrived in the Nick of Time from
<HI>France,</HI> to dispose them to a Conjunction with <HI>Holland,</HI> and to warrant
<PB N="328" REF="332"/>
the Performance of whatsoever the <HI>Hollander</HI> should promise, and likewise
to undertake that <HI>France</HI> would protect them against <HI>England,</HI> and there∣fore
that They should not apprehend any Danger from a War from thence;
and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was now gone with the Fleet for <HI>Bergen.</HI></P>
<P>UPON all these Motives concurring in the same Conjuncture, the poor
King embraced that Party; and then declared and complained, “that the
<HI>English</HI> had broken the Law of Nations in violating the Peace of his Ports,
and endeavouring to fire his Town, when They were hospitably received and
treated there under the Protection of his Castle.” He denied that He
had ever made such an Offer or Promise as Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> still charged<MILESTONE N="10"/>
him with, and which He had not denied to Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> when He came
first thither. But now He reproached Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> “for falsifying his
Words, at least for mistaking them, and sending that to the King his Master
which He gave him no Liberty to do.” And now Sir <HI>Gilbert</HI> found his
Errour in not having drawn from him or his Servant <HI>Gabell,</HI> in Writing,
some Evidence of the Engagement: But after many Indignities He left the
Court and returned to <HI>England.</HI> All <HI>English</HI> Ships in <HI>Denmark</HI> or <HI>Nor∣way</HI>
were seized upon; and the Persons of all Merchants and others who
were his Majesty's Subjects, and to some of whom the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
owed great Sums of Money which They had lent to him, were imprisoned,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and their Goods seized and confiscated.</P>
<P>ALL which Proceedings provoked the King to give the like Orders, and
to look upon them as Enemies, and to emit a Declaration of the Motive
He had to send his Fleet to <HI>Bergen,</HI> “which He could never have done
but upon the Invitation and Promise of that King; which was evident
enough by the Reception his Ships had there, and Expectation the Gover∣nour
had of their Arrival, and his Allegation, <HI>that He expected that very
Night fuller Orders than He had yet received;</HI> and lastly, his suffering
them to depart securely, after all the Acts of Hostility had passed in the
Port.” Much of this was denied with many indecent Expressions, and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
such Evasions as made all that was said believed by equal Considerers: And
so the War was declared.</P>
<P>AND then in the Beginning of the Year 1666, a Year long destined by
all Astrologers for the Production of dismal Changes and Alterations through∣out
the World, and by some for the End of it, the King found his Condition
so much worse than it had been the last Year, as the Addition of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Denmark</HI> could make it; against all which, and the Prodigies which
the Year was to produce (and it did truly produce many), the King pre∣pared
with his accustomed Vigour and Resolution, though the Predictions
had a strange Operation upon vulgar Minds.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Proclamation of the War in <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Negotiations of the</HI> French <HI>at this Time.</HI></NOTE> and the Seizure upon the Es∣tates
of the <HI>English</HI> with some Circumstances in the Point of Time, and
other Actions very unjust and unusual, the great maritime Preparations
there, and the visible Assistance of Force that was sent thence to the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
did not trouble nor hurt the King so much as the secret and invisible Nego∣tiations
of that Crown. From the first Declaration of the Bishop of <HI>Mun∣ster</HI>
of his Resolution to make a War upon <HI>Holland</HI> (with which He ac∣quainted
the King of <HI>France</HI> before He declared it, and received such an
Answer that made him very confident (as hath been remembered before
upon his first Address to the King of <HI>Great Britain)</HI> that He should<MILESTONE N="50"/>
meet with no Obstruction from thence; and upon that Confidence the
Treaty was concluded with the King, and great Sums of Money paid to
the Bishop upon his Promise and Engagement, “that He would fix him∣self
<PB N="329" REF="333"/>
with his Army within the Territories of the <HI>States General</HI> before the
Winter was ended; and that against the Spring, when the King's Fleet should
be ready for the Sea, He would at the same Time march with an Army
of twenty thousand Foot and five thousand Horse into the Heart of their
Country;” and what the Effect of that would have been in that Con∣juncture
may be in some Degree guessed at by what hath since fallen out):
I say, <HI>France,</HI> from the first Knowledge They had of his Purpose, and before
They declared on the Behalf of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> secretly sent to the neighbour
Princes “not to join with the Bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They deter the neighbouring States from assisting the Bishop of</HI> Munster.</NOTE> and to do all that was in their Power to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>hinder his Levies;” and prevailed with the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who
had given Hopes to the Bishop of a powerful Assistance upon the Expec∣tation
of the Restoration of <HI>Wesel,</HI> and other Towns then possessed by <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
totally to decline any Conjunction with him, upon Promise “that He
should find his own Account better from the Friendship of <HI>France.</HI>” The
Dukes of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> who had made the Bishop believe that They would
join with him, and had made Levies of Soldiers to that Purpose, having
abundant Argument of Quarrel with <HI>Holland,</HI> were now persuaded by the
same Way not only to desist from helping, but to declare themselves Ene∣mies
to the Bishop if He would not desist, and “that They would serve the
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>Dutch</HI> with their Forces.”</P>
<P>WHEN all this could not discourage the Bishop from prosecuting his In∣tention,
but that He still gathered Troops, and gave new Commissions to
Officers who had prepared for their Levies farther in <HI>Germany;</HI> the King
of <HI>France</HI> sent an Envoy expressly to the Bishop himself, and offered his Me∣diation
and Interposition with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> “that They should do him all
the Right that in Justice He could demand from them, and if this were
not accepted by him, that He must expect what Prejudice the Arms of
<HI>France</HI> could bring upon him;” and then sent to all those Princes who
had permitted Levies to be made in their Countries, “that They should
<MILESTONE N="30"/>not suffer those Troops to march out of their Country,” but offered “to
receive and entertain them in his own Army.” With this He sent to the
other Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> and to the Emperour himself, “that if They did
not prevent this Incursion of the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI>” (to which They all
wished well), “They would involve the Empire in a War.”</P>
<P>WHEN all this could not terrify the Bishop, who defended himself by his
Engagement to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> “that He would not enter into
Treaty nor give over his Enterprise without his Consent,” and drew his
Forces together to a Rendezvous, and had got Permission from the Marquis
of <HI>Castelle Roderigo,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> to make Levies in those
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Provinces without Noise or avowing it, and marched with his Army into
the <HI>States</HI> Dominions, and took a Place or two even in the Sight of Prince
<HI>Maurice</HI> (who drew as many of the <HI>States</HI> Troops together as could be
spared out of their Garrisons, but thought not fit to engage with them, after
He had found in some light Skirmishes that They were not firm); so that
the Bishop, by the Advantage of the Situation of which He was possessed,
began to fasten himself in full Assurance of increasing his Army, in Spite
of all Discouragements, before the Spring (and He had already received
some Troops out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and Advertisement from other of his Officers,
that They were well advanced in their Levies): The King of <HI>France</HI> in this
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Conjuncture, in the imperious Style He customarily used in those Cases, sent
to the Governour of <HI>Flanders</HI> for a License for such Troops, as He had
Occasion to send into <HI>Germany,</HI> to pass through such a Part of his Go∣vernment;
which as He had no Mind to grant, so He durst not deny,
<PB N="330" REF="334"/>
having Orders from <HI>Spain</HI> to be very careful, that no Disgusts might be
given to <HI>France</HI> which might give any Occasion, or Pretence, or Opportunity
for a Breach, which They well knew was desired and longed for.</P>
<P>UPON this Permission the <HI>French</HI> Troops marched into <HI>Flanders:</HI> And in
the first Place, whether in their Way or out of their Way, They fell upon
the Levies which were made for the Bishop, and routed and dispersed them,
or took them Prisoners. In one Place, by the Strength of their Quarter
and a neighbour Church, They defended themselves, imagining the Coun∣try
would relieve them, without suspecting that They had License and Per∣mission
to march through: But They were so much inferiour in Number<MILESTONE N="10"/>
or Strength, that after some of them were killed, the rest were glad to throw
down their Arms and become Prisoners at Mercy, the Officers not compre∣hending
what declared Enemy could fall upon them in those Quarters.
With this Triumph They marched, and joined with Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> by the
Time the Bishop had Notice of the Disaster, and speedily advanced upon
his Quarters, and beat some of his Troops.</P>
<P>UPON which the poor Bishop (who instead of the Supplies and Commis∣sions
and other Countenance that He had Reason to expect from those
Princes, who had been privy and with great Promises encouraged his Enter∣prise,
received every Day Arguments from them against his proceeding far∣ther,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
with many Conjurations that He would entirely submit to the King of
<HI>France</HI> his Determination) found himself necessitated to comply,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And at length force him to make a Peace with the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> and even
heartbroken signed a Treaty with the <HI>French,</HI> who then were careful enough
both of his Honour and Interest in the Conditions with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as for
an Ally of whom They meant to make more Use in another Conjuncture.
Upon all which the Bishop had been much more excusable, if He had
not received some of the King's Money, even after He saw that He should
be obliged to sign the Treaty; which He ought not to have done, though
it had been due, and it may be expended, before He had any such Inten∣tion,
and to which it cannot be denied He had most forcible Com∣pulsions.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THIS was the most sensible Blow, but the Plague, that the King had felt
from the Beginning of the War, and was Instance enough how terrible the
King of <HI>France</HI> was to all the neighbour Kings and Princes, who had so
suddenly departed from their own Inclinations and Resolutions and from
their own Interest, only upon his Insinuations, which became Orders to
them. And <HI>Spain,</HI> if They knew that which all the World besides dis∣cerned,
could not but believe that <HI>France</HI> would break all Treaties as soon
as the other King should die, the News of which was expected and pro∣vided
for every Week. But the drowsy Temper of that Monarch, who
had been so much disquieted throughout his whole Reign, extended so<MILESTONE N="40"/>
far only as to prepare a Stock of Peace that would last during his own
Time, that He saw would be very short, and to leave his Dominions and
his infant Son to shift for themselves when He was dead: And it was an
unhappy Maxim of that State, that it was the best Husbandry to pur∣chase
present Peace and present Money at how dear Interest soever for the
future, which would be assisted with some new Expedients, as <HI>Spain</HI> had
always been.</P>
<P>ALL these Disadvantages made the King the more solicitous to have but
one Enemy to struggle with,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with</HI> Holland <HI>a∣gainst</HI> France.</NOTE> though it were <HI>France:</HI> And therefore He
was very solicitous by all Ways He could devise to make a Peace with <HI>Hol∣land,</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
and to leave <HI>Denmark</HI> to their own Inventions; and He had some
Encouragement to believe, that it was not impossible to separate <HI>Holland</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="335"/>
from <HI>France.</HI> They were sensible enough, that They had been upon the
Matter betrayed into the War, by the positive Promise of Assistance, and a
firm Conjunction from <HI>France</HI> in the Instant that the War should be en∣tered
upon, without any Mention of Mediation or Interposition for Peace,
which was against their Desire; and that They had looked on very unconcern∣edly,
or rather well pleased to see them beaten, and their own People ready to
rise against the Government.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>jealous of</HI> France.</NOTE> Then They knew that <HI>France</HI> did already pro∣vide
for an Expedition against <HI>Flanders,</HI> which could not long defend itself
with its own Forces; and that They depended upon this War between
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as what must hinder Both those Nations from
giving it Assistance: And They as well knew what their own Portion must
be, when that Screen was removed, that was their best Security against so
mighty a Neighbour. And this <HI>De Wit</HI> himself, who was the chief Sup∣porter
of the War, frequently observed and confessed to those with whom
He had most Conversation, and in whom He was believed to have most
Trust: And all those Advertisements were transmitted to the King by those
whose Integrity could not be suspected, and who did not dissemble, being of
the <HI>States</HI> themselves, to be very desirous of Peace and very jealous of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was a Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of</HI> M. Bewett <HI>a Gentleman of great Weight in</HI> Holland.</NOTE> one <HI>Monsieur Bewett,</HI> of a good Family in
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>France</HI> and born there, but long bred in <HI>Holland</HI> whilst the Wars were
there, and who had been Captain in the last Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> Horse-Guards,
and in very particular Favour with him, by which He was married to a
Woman of <HI>Holland</HI> very rich, and very nearly allied to many of those who
had the greatest Influence upon the Government; and who was now looked
upon rather as a <HI>Dutchman</HI> than a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and conversed most fami∣liarly
amongst the <HI>Burgomasters,</HI> and other principal Persons of the <HI>States.</HI>
And by this Interest, after the Death of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that Troop
was still preserved for a Guard to the <HI>States,</HI> and was the only Horse-Troop
that remained constantly in the <HI>Hague.</HI> And for the better pleasing the People,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>it was still called the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> Guard, and continued to wear the
same Livery it had always done: And the young Prince took much De∣light
to see them, and to hear himself called by them their Captain; and
the Commander thereof, <HI>Bewett,</HI> professed and paid the same Devotion to
him that He had done to his Father.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman was generally beloved, and held a Man of great
Sincerity, brave in Point of Courage, and of good Parts of Wit and
Judgment, save that He was immoderately given to Wine and to the Ex∣cess
of it, which, being the Disease or rather the Health of the Country,
made him not the worse thought of or less fit for Business. He was
<MILESTONE N="40"/>well known to the King and well thought of by him, and had great Fami∣liarity
with some of the Bedchamber, and others near the King and trusted
by him. He had made a Journey once, since the King's Return into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
only to kiss his Hand, and profess the same Affection and Duty He
had often done when his Majesty was abroad, which had always made him
acceptable to him.</P>
<P>HE was a bold Speaker, and from the Time that the War was begun
against <HI>England</HI> much inveighed against the Counsel that persuaded it, as
very pernicious to the Affairs of that Country; and in this Argument used
not more Freedom with any than with <HI>De Wit</HI> himself, who loved his Per∣son
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and his Spirit, and conversed very freely with him, though He knew
his Friendships were chiefly with the Dependents upon the House of <HI>Orange,</HI>
and with others of the <HI>States</HI> who were of his own Opinion with Reference
to the War: And the publishing his Opinion drew many of the greatest In∣terest
<PB N="332" REF="336"/>
amongst the <HI>Burgomasters</HI> to delight in his Conversation, and to trust
him much. With those He consulted freely what Means should be used to
procure a Peace, and prevent the Mischief that must attend the Conti∣nuance
of the War, with good Sense and Judgment: But those Consulta∣tions
were always in the Exercise of Drinking, which never ended without
the utmost Excess, though without Noise or Disquiet or Unkindness, which
are never the Effects of those Excesses amongst that People.</P>
<P>AFTER the first Battle, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were so much beaten, and the
People in that Consternation that They called aloud for Peace, and reviled
all those who were thought to be against it, and amongst those <HI>De Wit</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
principally, who had the more Enemies, and Peace the more Friends, for
the Differences which had arisen amongst the Officers of the Fleet upon the
Death of <HI>Opdam,</HI> and upon the Disgrace which <HI>Trump</HI> had undergone by
the Power and Injustice, as They said, of <HI>De Wit</HI> upon personal Dislikes,
and because He was known to have great Affection for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
(and <HI>Van Trump</HI> himself, as hath been said, was not only of much Interest
amongst the Seamen, but very popular in the Government, and had his Sis∣ters
married to <HI>Burgomasters</HI> in some of the greatest Towns; so that the
Disgrace of him increased the Number of <HI>De Wit's</HI> Enemies): In this Con∣juncture
<HI>Bewett</HI> cultivated the best He could all those ill Humours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Endea∣vours to bring about a Peace.</NOTE> how<MILESTONE N="20"/>
mutinous soever, which grew most importunate for Peace; yet without
any Reflection upon the Person of <HI>De Wit,</HI> with whom He was known by
the Company He most kept to have much Familiarity, and whom He did
at that Time really believe to be inclined to Peace, and declared He did
think so to those who knew the contrary, yet did not think the worse of
him for being deceived, being assured He would never deceive them for
Want of Integrity.</P>
<P>BUT He took Advantage of this general Distemper and of the Prejudice
the People had against him, to talk very frankly to <HI>De Wit</HI> of Both; and
admired, “since He did, as He professed, desire Peace, that He would not<MILESTONE N="30"/>
find some Way to undeceive the People, which was necessary for his own
Security; and it might easily be effected, by giving a Beginning to such
a Consultation as might look towards an Accommodation.” <HI>De Wit</HI>
had his Spies in all Places, and knew well what Company <HI>Bewett</HI> most de∣lighted
in, though his Acquaintance was universal and agreeable to all Men:
And He was informed too of his particular Behaviour with Reference to
him, and that He did constantly and confidently vindicate him from many
Imputations, in the Presence of those who were not pleased with his Contra∣dictions;
so that He looked upon him as his Friend, and one that might by
his Interest and Credit divert some of that popular Envy and Malice, of<MILESTONE N="40"/>
which He had no Contempt but much Apprehension.</P>
<P>HE renewed his former Professions of his Desire of Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Wit <HI>pre∣tends to desire a Peace.</HI></NOTE> and gave so
good Reasons for it as might naturally gain Belief; amongst which one was
always a vehement Jealousy of <HI>France,</HI> “which,” He said, “though it had
at last declared War against <HI>England,</HI> which They ought to have done so
long before, had done it only to draw <HI>England</HI> into some Conditions which
might facilitate their own Enterprise upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> which it concerned
them to prevent by all the Ways possible; of which none would be so
probable as a Peace between <HI>England</HI> and them, which would imme∣diately
make each solicitous for their own Interest. But how to set any<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Thing on Foot that might contribute to this He knew not; and the doing
that which the other had proposed, by declaring himself, was the Way
<PB N="333" REF="337"/>
only to slacken all the Provisions for War, the expediting of which would
most advance a Peace.”</P>
<P>BEWETT replied, “that He knew He had many Friends in the <HI>English</HI>
Court, whereof some were of near Trust about his Majesty, for whose
Secrecy He would be accountable;” and named the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who
had lately married a Lady of the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Monsieur Bever∣waert,</HI>
a Person in his Quality and Fortune in the first Rank. He offered
to him, “that He would himself write such a Letter to the Lord <HI>Ar∣lington</HI>
in his own Name, which He should first see and approve, with∣out
<MILESTONE N="10"/>which He would not send it, as should only testify his own good
Wishes for a Peace between the two Nations, which were not unknown
to the King himself; and would make no other Mention of him, than
that He had Reason to believe, that <HI>Monsieur De Wit</HI> (in whose good
Opinion He had the Honour to be known to have some Place) would not
be unwilling to promote any good Overture that should be made.” Af∣ter
some Debate He was content that He should write, provided that He
would promise to write Nothing but what He should first see, and would
still bring the Answers to him which He should receive; to which the
other consented.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>UPON this Encouragement He begun his Correspondence with the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bewett <HI>en∣ters into a Correspond∣ence with the</HI> English <HI>Court with</HI> De Wit's <HI>Consent.</HI></NOTE> and acquainted his Bosom-Friends with it, to dispose them the
more to hope for Peace, and to look upon <HI>De Wit</HI> as not averse to it. But
what He writ was with so much Wariness, being dictated upon the Matter
by the Pensioner, that it could draw no other Answers from the Secretary
but of the same Style, with Expressions of his Majesty's Desire of Peace and
Esteem of <HI>De Wit,</HI> and as if He expected some Overtures to arise from
thence. This Intelligence had not been long on Foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He soon sus∣pects</HI> De Wit's <HI>Sincerity.</HI></NOTE> but He begun to
suspect the Sincerity of <HI>De Wit,</HI> and that indeed He was not so well in∣clined
to Peace as He had pretended to be: His Countenance was not so
<MILESTONE N="30"/>open, nor He so vacant when He came as He used to be; He grew less
jealous of the <HI>French,</HI> and more composed himself, and less apprehensive
of the People, as He found them more composed, and a greater Concur∣rence
in the making all Things ready for the Fleet. All which Observa∣tions
He likewise imparted to his Companions, who were glad to find him
begin to be undeceived; and from that Time He was apter to concur with
them in the fiercer Counsels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And resolves to get a Peace in Opposition to him.</NOTE> how to compass a Peace in Spite of him by
a Majority of Votes in the <HI>States,</HI> with the Help of the People, for the
Suppression of any accidental Insurrection whereof, there were no other
Forces in View than those Horse-Guards that were commanded by him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>HEREUPON He took a new Resolution, but would not lose the Advan∣tage
He had by the Knowledge <HI>De Wit</HI> had of his Correspondence, and
therefore shewed him a Letter that He had received from the Lord <HI>Ar∣lington,</HI>
in which He pressed him “to inform him, what Particulars would
dispose the <HI>States</HI> to Peace and to separate from the <HI>French,</HI>” and had sent
him a Cipher for the more free and safe Communication; which Cipher
He deposited in the Hands of <HI>De Wit,</HI> having received his Directions and
observed them by using the same Cipher, which the other examined and
kept, and hoped by the Answer to put an End to that Correspondence, of
which He grew weary, and less confident of the Person, because He heard
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that He was grown less zealous in his Defence than He had been.</P>
<P>BEWETT upon this grew more resolute one Way and less apprehensive the
other Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He settles a secret Corres∣pondence with the</HI> English <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> and sent a Person with whom He had great Friendship, and
who was well known to the King and most about him, <HI>Monsieur Silvius,</HI> a
<PB N="334" REF="338"/>
Servant to the late Princess Royal, and a Native of <HI>Orange,</HI> with a full Ac∣count
“of the State of the Counsels at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and his Discovery that
<HI>De Wit</HI> did not in Truth desire a Peace, nor would consent to it but
upon very unreasonable Terms,” whereof some were mentioned in his
Letter in Cipher which He had dictated; “but that He was most assured,
that He should be compelled at the next Assembly of the <HI>States</HI> to submit
to more reasonable Conditions.” He gave the King an Account of the
Ground of his Confidence, and an Information of the Persons who were
combined together to press it in the <HI>States,</HI> amongst which there were some
of the greatest Power: And by their Advice He offered the Substance of a<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Message They wished the King should send to the <HI>States General</HI> at the
Time of their convening, in which there was Nothing contained against
which any Thing could be objected on his Majesty's Behalf; and “upon the
Delivery thereof there would so few adhere to <HI>De Wit,</HI> that He should not
be able to prevent a Treaty though <HI>France</HI> should protest against it.” He
sent likewise at the same Time, and by the same Person, another Cipher to
the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> with Direction “that in such Letters as were intended
for the View of the Pensioner the former Cipher should be used, and in
the other Letters, which were to be concealed from him, and which were
for the most Part to contain Intelligence and Advice against him, the lat∣ter<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Cipher was only to be made Use of.”</P>
<P>THOSE Informations by <HI>Silvius,</HI> who was a Man of Parts, and had De∣pendance
upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and meant not to return into <HI>Holland</HI>
except upon a pressing Occasion, when He durst adventure to go, being
looked upon as an Inhabitant of the <HI>Hague,</HI> having been always bred there,
and his Relation to the Duke scarce yet taken Notice of; I say, those In∣formations
the King thought to be worthy to be well considered, and con∣ferred
with the Chancellor upon the Whole, and appointed the Lord <HI>Ar∣lington</HI>
to inform him of all that had passed from the Beginning; and that
<HI>Silvius,</HI> who was concealed, that They might have no Advertisement in<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Holland</HI> of his having been in <HI>England,</HI> should likewise attend him in some
Evening; which He shortly after did, and made him an ample and clear
Relation of the State of the Counsels at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the several Factions
amongst them, and the Distemper of the People. He had himself spoken
with many of the <HI>Burgomasters</HI> and others in Authority, who were privy to
his Coming, and communicated the Method They meant to proceed in to∣wards
the depressing <HI>De Wit,</HI> by mingling the Proposition for Peace with
the Interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which the People thought to be inse∣parable.</P>
<P>IN Fine, He gave a perfect good Account of all to which He was in∣structed,
with great Modesty: And when the Chancellor, to whom <HI>Bewett</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
and He were Both well known, would have induced him to deliver Somewhat
of his own Judgment, whether He thought that Combination to be strong
enough to over-rule <HI>De Wit;</HI> He could draw no other Answer from him
than the magnifying the Credit and Interest of <HI>Bewett,</HI> which He seemed
principally to rely upon, and the Impossibility that He should fail in Point
of Integrity or Courage.</P>
<P>SILVIUS had settled a sure Way of Correspondence, and by every Post re∣ceived
fresh Intelligence of the Preparations and Progress <HI>Bewett</HI> and his
Friends made in their Designs, of the Success whereof They were every Day
more confident, and thought their Party so much to increase, that as They<MILESTONE N="50"/>
did not apprehend any Discovery like to be made by Treachery, so They
did not seem to fear it, if <HI>De Wit</HI> himself should know all that They in∣tended:
<PB N="335" REF="339"/>
And They pressed very earnestly, “that the King's Letter, in the
Manner They had proposed, might be at the <HI>Hague</HI> when the <HI>General
States</HI> were to meet,” the Time whereof approached.</P>
<P>THE King called those to him to whom the whole Negotiation had been
imparted, to advise what was to be done. On the King's Part Nothing was
considerable, but whether He should write to the <HI>States</HI> at all, and what
He should write: And against writing there seemed to be no Objection,
and as little against writing what They advised, which was no more than
He had formerly writ, and always said to their Ambassadour. And that this
<MILESTONE N="10"/>might be a more favourable Conjuncture for the good Reception of it, and
hearkening to it, his Majesty was reasonably to believe those who meant to
second and promote it with their own Reasons: And therefore the Time and
the Manner of the Delivery of it was left to be resolved amongst themselves,
the King having no Minister there to present it.</P>
<P>THE Way that They had thought of was, that <HI>Bewett</HI> should at the
proper Time deliver it to <HI>De Wit,</HI> who durst not conceal it, and if He
should, there would be Ways enough to publish it to his Reproach; nor
could He take any Advantage of <HI>Bewett</HI> for his Correspondence with their
Enemies, because it had been entered into with his Approbation. But for
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the better Security in the sending it, and the better Information of the Per∣sons
engaged of all the Reflections which had been made by the King, and
those with whom He had conferred by his Majesty's Order, it was thought
best that <HI>Silvius</HI> should return; and if <HI>Bewett</HI> thought fit to decline the De∣livery
of the King's Letter, and no better Way could be found for the De∣livery
of it, He might present it in the Manner his Friends there should di∣rect,
and avow his having been at <HI>London</HI> to solicit his own Pretences since
the Death of the Princess Royal his Mistress, and that He had received the
Letter from the King's own Hand. This being the concurrent Opinion
of all, and the Gentleman himself willing to undertake it; <HI>Silvius</HI> was
<MILESTONE N="30"/>dispatched.</P>
<P>IN the Debate of the Matter, the King asked the Chancellor “what He
thought of the Design, and whether He thought it would succeed;” who
said, “He doubted it much, and that it would conclude in the Loss of
poor <HI>Bewett's</HI> Head, who had not a Talent for the Managery of an Af∣fair
of that Weight, which would require great Secrecy and great Sobriety,
and the Consideration of more Particulars at once than his Comprehension
could contain together.” Then He did not like the Method They proposed,
of joining the Demand of Peace with the Interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
which, though it might probably follow the Peace and be an Effect of it,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>would not be seasonable to be joined with it in Regard of his Infancy; and
that many did heartily desire the Peace, who had no Mind that the Prince
should be restored to the Offices of his Father and Family, or that there
should be any Debate of it, till the Prince came to the Age that was pro∣vided
by the solemn Act and Declaration of the <HI>States:</HI> Which had been
the Reason that his Majesty (who had all the Tenderness for his Nephew
that a Parent could have) would never be persuaded to mention him (though
it had been proposed by many, and even by the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>
and the Princess Dowager) in the Conditions of the Peace; the King fore∣seeing
that <HI>De Wit</HI> would have been glad to have that Advantage, as to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>observe to the People, that the King would prescribe to them what Officers
They should choose and admit into their Government, and that They
must have no Peace, except They would take a General and a Stadtholder
<PB N="336" REF="340"/>
and an Admiral of his Nomination, which was to make them subject to
himself.</P>
<P>AND this was the Reason, that in all Conferences with the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassadours,
who sometimes would mention the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with Com∣passion
for the Ingratitude of the <HI>States</HI> towards him, and add, “that They
doubted not their Master would be ready to join with his Majesty in doing
him all Offices;” and sometimes when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour (who was
of that Party that did really wish the Restoration of the Prince) in Con∣ference
would seem to wish and to believe, that the restoring the Prince
of <HI>Orange</HI> would be the Consequence of the Peace: The King never gave<MILESTONE N="10"/>
other Answer, than “that He should be very glad that the <HI>States</HI> would
gratify his Nephew; but that it was a Matter He had Nothing to do
to interpose in, it depending wholly upon their own Good-Will and
Pleasure.”</P>
<P>THE rest who were present had much more Esteem of <HI>Bewett</HI> than the
Chancellor had (who thought as well of his Courage and Integrity as They
did), and believed He would have Success in what He designed, his In∣terest
in the Right of his Wife being confessedly very great amongst the
<HI>States,</HI> and his jolly Course of Living having rendered him very acceptable
and grateful to Men of the most different Affections; and then of all the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Officers of the Militia He was most esteemed, which was like to be of Mo∣ment
if the Dispute brought the Matter to a Struggle: But the Event shewed
the Contrary.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Silvius's</HI> Departure, Letters passed between them, as they had
used to do, for two or three Posts. And <HI>Bewett</HI> one Day meeting <HI>De Wit</HI>
when He came from his good Fellows, and They walking a Turn together
in common Discourse, <HI>De Wit</HI> asked him, “when He had any Letter
from <HI>England,</HI> and how Affairs went there:” To which He suddenly an∣swered,
“that He came just then from receiving one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bewett's <HI>se∣cret Corres∣pondence acci∣dentally disco∣vered by</HI> De Wit.</NOTE> which He had not
yet deciphered,” and put his Hand into his Pocket, and took thence a<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Letter; and casting his Eyes (which were never good, and now worse by
the Company He had left) upon the Superscription, He gave it to him, and
said, “He would go with him that They might decipher it together accord∣ing
to Custom.”</P>
<P>DE WIT presently found that it was not the accustomed Cipher (for He
had delivered the wrong Letter, that which He ought not to see), and de∣sired
him “that He would walk before, and He would presently overtake
him, after He had spoken a few Words at a House in his Way.” And
so leaving him, He took present Order for the apprehending him and search∣ing
his Pockets; and at the same Time sent to his House, and caused his<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Cabinet, where all his Papers were, to be examined and sealed up. And
so poor <HI>Bewett,</HI> whilst He stayed at the other's House that They might
decipher the Letter, was apprehended, and all his Papers taken out of his
Pockets, and He sent to Prison. The other Cipher was quickly found,
and many Letters and other Papers, which discovered many Secrets. Where∣upon
a Court of Justice was speedily erected: And within three Days, ac∣cording
to the Expedition used there in such Cases, a Scaffold was erected,
and the poor Gentleman brought thither in the Sight of all his Friends;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which He is executed.</NOTE> and
there, with his known Courage, and in few Words declaring “that He had
honest Purposes to the Country,” lost his Head.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>SILVIUS quickly heard of his Imprisonment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Friends obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and as soon thought it ne∣cessary
to make his own Escape, and arrived in <HI>England</HI> before He heard
of his last Misfortune, which He did not suspect, nor knew how the Dis∣covery
<PB N="337" REF="341"/>
had been made. The Knot, thus broken, dispersed themselves:
Most of them got into <HI>Flanders;</HI> the <HI>Burgomaster</HI> of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and two
or three others of Note, made all the Haste They could into <HI>England;</HI>
some thought themselves secure in <HI>Antwerp</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Flanders;</HI>
and some were seized upon in several Places of the <HI>States</HI> Dominions, and
imprisoned with all the Circumstances of Severity, though upon the Want
of clear Proofs few of them were put to Death. The Troop of Guards was
reformed, or rather transformed, under new Officers, and assigned for a
constant Guard to the <HI>States,</HI> without the least formal Relation to the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or using his Name or Livery, or Permission to pay any
Reverence to him. And so the Prince was much lower than before, and
all Hopes of reviving almost extinguished or expired; <HI>De Wit</HI> stood firmer
upon his own Feet than ever, and directed all Preparations for the War
without Control; and all the present Expectation in <HI>England</HI> vanished:
Whilst the Pensionary informed <HI>France</HI> of the Dangers He had escaped for
them, and what great Matters had been offered to him if He would have
departed from their Interest; and made the Plot to contain all that He fan∣cied
it might have done.</P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> was prorogued, it was to a Day in
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>April:</HI> But the King had Reason to believe that They would not so soon be
in good Humour enough to give more Money, which was the principal End
of calling them together. And the Dregs of the Plague still remaining,
and venting its Malignity in many Burials every Week, his Majesty thought
fit to dispense with their Attendance at that Time by a Proclamation: And
He caused it at the Day to be prorogued to the twentieth of <HI>September</HI> fol∣lowing.
In the mean Time the Court abounded in all its Excesses. There
had been some Hope during the Abode at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that the Queen had
been with Child; and whilst that Hope lasted, the King lived with more
Constraint and Caution, and prepared to make himself worthy of that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Blessing: And there are many Reasons to believe, besides his own natural
good Inclinations, that if God had vouchsafed to have given him a Child,
and the Queen that Blessing to have merited from him, He would have re∣strained
all those inordinate Appetites and Delights; and that He would se∣riously
have applied himself to his Government, and cut off all those extra∣vagant
Expenses of Money and Time, which disturbed and corrupted the
Evenness of his own Nature and the Sincerity of his Intentions, and exposed
him to the Temptations of those who had all the Traps and Snares to catch
and detain him.</P>
<P>THE Imagination of the Queen's Breeding was one Cause of her Stay
<MILESTONE N="40"/>there;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen miscarries.</NOTE> and her Stay there was the longer, because She miscarried when She
intended to begin her Journey. And though the Doctors declared that it
was a real Miscarriage, ripe enough to make a Judgment of the Sex; yet
some of the Women who had more Credit with the King assured him, “that
it was only a false Conception, and that She had not been at all with
Child:” Insomuch that his Majesty, who had been so confident upon
a former Occasion, as to declare to the Queen his Mother and to others,
“that upon his own Knowledge her Majesty had miscarried of a Son,” suf∣fered
himself now to be so totally convinced by those Ladies and other Wo∣men,
that He did as positively believe that She never had, never could be,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>with Child.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great License in the Court.</NOTE> And from that Time He took little Pleasure in her Conversa∣tion,
and more indulged to himself all Liberties in the Conversation of
those, who used all their Skill to supply him with Divertisements, which
might drive all that was serious out of his Thoughts, and make him un∣dervalue
<PB N="338" REF="342"/>
those whom He had used, and still did most trust and employ, in
what He thought most important; though He sometimes thought many
Things not of Importance, which in the Consequence were of the highest.</P>
<P>THE Lady, who had never declined in Favour, was now greater in
Power than ever: She was with Child again, and well enough contented
that his Majesty should entertain an Amour with another Lady, and made
a very strict Friendship with her, it may be the more diligently out of Con∣fidence
that He would never prevail with her, which many others believed
too. But without Doubt the King's Passion was stronger towards that other
Lady, than ever it was to any other Woman: And She carried it with that<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Discretion and Modesty, that She made no other Use of it than for the
Convenience of her own Fortune and Subsistence, which was narrow enough;
never seemed disposed to interpose in the least Degree in Business, nor to
speak ill of any Body; which Kind of Nature and Temper the more in∣flamed
the King's Affection, who did not in his Nature love a busy Wo∣man,
and had an Aversion from speaking with any Woman, or hearing
them speak, of any Business but to that Purpose He thought them all made
for, however They broke in afterwards upon him to all other Purposes.</P>
<P>THE Lady herself, who every Day (as was said before) grew in Power
and Credit, did not yet presume to interpose in any other Business, than<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in giving all the imaginable Countenance She could to those who desired to
depend upon her, and, in their Right as well as her own, in depressing the
Credit of those who She knew wished her's much less than it was; but in
this last Argument She was hitherto wary, and took only such Opportuni∣ties
as were offered, without going out of her Way to find them. Her
principal Business was to get an Estate for herself and her Children, which
She thought the King at least as much concerned to provide as She to soli∣cit;
which however She would not be wanting in, and so procured round
Sums of Money out of the Privy Purse (where She had placed Mr. <HI>May</HI>),
and other Assignations in other Names, and so the less taken Notice of,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
though in great Proportions: All which yet amounted to little more than
to pay her Debts, which She had in few Years contracted to an unima∣ginable
Greatness, and to defray her constant Expenses, which were very
excessive in Coaches and Horses, Cloaths and Jewels, without any Thing
of Generosity, or gratifying any of her Family, or so much as paying any
of her Father's Debts, whereof some were very clamorous. Her Name
was not used in any Suits for the Grant of Lands; for besides that there
was no avowing or publick Mention of natural Children, She did think
the Chancellor and Treasurer willing to obstruct such Grants, and de∣sired
not to have any Occasion to try the Kindness of either of them:<MILESTONE N="40"/>
And so all the Suits She made of that Kind were with Reference to <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
where They had no Title to obstruct, nor natural Opportunity to
know, what was granted; and in that Kingdom She procured the Grant of
several great Quantities of Land, like to prove of great Benefit and Value to
her or her Children.</P>
<P>THE chief Design They now begun to design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to raise Jealousies in the King of his Brother.</NOTE> and the worst They could
ever design, was to raise a Jealousy in the King of his Brother, to which his
Majesty was not in any Degree inclined, and had in Truth a just Affection
for him and Confidence in him, without thinking better of his natural
Parts than He thought there was Cause for; and yet, which made it the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
more wondered at, He did very often depart in Matters of the highest
Moment from his own Judgment to comply with his Brother, who was
instructed, by those who too well knew the King's Nature, to adhere to
<PB N="339" REF="343"/>
any Thing He once advised, and to be importunate in any Thing He pro∣posed;
in which He prevailed the more easily, because He never used it in
any Thing that concerned himself or his own Benefit.</P>
<P>THE Truth is:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Temper and Disposition of the</HI> Stuart <HI>Family.</HI></NOTE> It was the unhappy Fate and Constitution of that Fa∣mily,
that They trusted naturally the Judgments of those, who were as
much inferiour to them in Understanding as They were in Quality, before
their own which was very good; and suffered even their Natures, which
disposed them to Virtue and Justice, to be prevailed upon and altered and
corrupted by those, who knew how to make Use of some one Infirmity that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>They discovered in them; and by complying with that, and cherishing and
serving it, They by Degrees wrought upon the Mass, and sacrificed all the
other good Inclinations to that single Vice. They were too much inclined
to like Men at first Sight, and did not love the Conversation of Men of
many more Years than themselves, and thought Age not only troublesome
but impertinent. They did not love to deny, and less to Strangers than to
their Friends; not out of Bounty or Generosity, which was a Flower that
did never grow naturally in the Heart of either of the Families, that of
<HI>Stuart</HI> or the other of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> but out of an Unskilfulness and Defect in
the Countenance: And when They prevailed with themselves to make some
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Pause rather than to deny, Importunity removed all Resolution, which
They knew neither how to shut out nor to defend themselves against, even
when it was evident enough that They had much rather not consent; which
often made that which would have looked like Bounty lose all its Grace
and Lustre.</P>
<P>IF the Duke seemed to be more firm and fixed in his Resolutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particularly of the King and Duke.</NOTE> it
was rather from an Obstinacy in his Will, which He defended by Aver∣sion
from the Debate, than from the Constancy of his Judgment, which
was more subject to Persons than to Arguments, and so as changeable at
least as the King's, which was in greatest Danger by Surprise: And from
<MILESTONE N="30"/>this Want of Steadiness, and Irresolution (whencesoever the Infirmity pro∣ceeded)
most of the Misfortunes, which attended either of them or their
Servants who served them honestly, had their Rise and Growth; of which
there will be shortly an Occasion, and too frequently, to say much more.
In the mean Time it cannot be denied, and was observed and confessed by
all, that never any Prince had a more humble and dutiful Condescension and
Submission to an elder Brother, than the Duke had towards the King: His
whole Demeanour and Behaviour was so full of Reverence, that it might
have given Example to be imitated by those, who ought but did not observe
a greater Distance. And the Conscience and Resentment He had within
<MILESTONE N="40"/>himself, for the Sally He had made in <HI>Flanders,</HI> made him after so wary
in his Actions, and so abhorring to hear any Thing that might lessen his
Awe for the King, that no Man who had most Credit with him durst ap∣proach
towards any Thing of that Kind; so that there was never less
Ground of Jealousy than of him. And (as was said before) the King (who
was in his Nature so far from any Kind of Jealousy, that He was too
much inclined to make Interpretations of many Words and Actions, which
might reasonably harbour other Apprehensions) was as incapable of any Infu∣sions
which might lessen his Confidence in his Brother, as any noble and
virtuous Mind could be. And therefore those ill Men, who began about
<MILESTONE N="50"/>this Time to sow that cursed Seed that grew up to bear a large Crop of
the worst and rankest Jealousy in the succeeding Time, did not presume
to make any Reflection upon the Duke himself, but upon his Wife, “upon
the State She assumed, and the Height of the whole Family, that lived
<PB N="340" REF="344"/>
in much more Plenty,” They said, “than the King's, and were more re∣garded
abroad.”</P>
<P>SUCH Kind of People are never without some particular Stories of the Per∣sons
whom They desire to deprave:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endeavours used to lessen the King's Es∣teem of the Dutchess.</NOTE> And so They had many Instances, which
They used upon all Occasions, of some Levity or Vanity, of some Words
affected by the Dutchess, or some outward Carriage, true or false, which
for the most Part concluded in Mirth and Laughter, and seemed ridiculous;
which was the Method They used in all their Approaches of that Kind to∣wards
the highest Acts of Malice, first to make the Person, whom They
hoped to ruin in the End, less esteemed, by the acting and Presentation of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
his Words and Gestures and Motions; which commonly is attended with
Laughter. And this is the first Breach They make upon any Man's Repu∣tation;
and the frequent Custom of this Kind of Laughter and Mirth,
which is easily produced without any Malice, doth in the End open a Space
large enough to let in Calumny and Scandal enough to weaken, if not to
destroy, the best built Reputation.</P>
<P>THIS was the Course They held with Reference to the Dutchess, whom
the King had from the Beginning treated with great Grace and Favour,
and considered her as a Woman of more than an ordinary Wit and Un∣derstanding:
And the Queen Mother had from the Reconciliation used<MILESTONE N="20"/>
her with that abundant Affection and Familiarity that was very wonderful;
and the Heights She assumed, and all that Greatness which many thought
too much, were not only inculcated, but enjoined by the Queen as a
Duty due to her Husband, of whose high Degree She thought She could
not be too tender and careful. And She had the Happiness so well to be∣have
herself towards the Duke, that He was exceedingly pleased with her,
and lived towards her with an Affection so remarkable and notorious, that
it grew to be the publick Discourse and Commendation; and which made
the Liberties that were taken elsewhere the more spoken of and censured.
It was very visible that He liked her Company and Conversation very well,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and was believed to communicate all his Counsels, and all He knew or
thought, without Reserve to her; which, being so contrary to the professed
Doctrine of the Court, administered Occasion to the Men of Mirth, in those
Seasons which took up a good Part of every Night, to be very pleasant
upon the Government of the Dutchess, and the Submission of the Duke;
in which there were always some witty Reflections upon the Chancellor.
And this Kind of Liberty, being first grateful to the King for the Wit that
accompanied it and the Mirth that it produced, grew by the Custom of
it the more acceptable; and it may be the general and publick Obser∣vation
of the Disparity in the Lives of the two Brothers made it wished,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
that there were no more of that Strictness in the one Place than in the
other, towards which there wanted not Application and Advice accordingly
as well as Example.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the Chancellor had a hard Part to act, being neither
able to do the Good He constantly endeavoured on one Side, nor remove
the Ill He disliked on the other Side; for He saw well the Mischief that
would inevitably follow the great Expenses of the Duke, which exceeded
all Limits and could never be provided for; and thought the Dutchess to
be blamed for what She spent upon herself, and used all the Credit
He had with Both to begin in Time to reform what Necessity would<MILESTONE N="50"/>
shortly do with more Dishonour: But the Disease had grown from the
first ill Digestion.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="345"/>
THE Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> had upon the King's first Arrival formed a Family
without Rule or Precedent, and made the Servants in a much better Con∣dition
than the Master, by assigning liberal Pensions and Allowances to
them, who had paid him dear for their Places, without considering from
what Fund they should arise: And now They all would have the Duke
believe, “that He spent not too much; but that He had too little Provision
assigned to him for his Quality and Relation, and that this proceeded from
the Neglect in the Chancellor, who was able, if He endeavoured it, to
persuade the King to enlarge it to a just Proportion.” And this was as
<MILESTONE N="10"/>much urged to the Dutchess as to the Duke, and it made in her a greater
Impression; and though She had in all other Respects a very entire Affec∣tion
and even a Duty and Resignation to her Father, yet in this He had no
Authority with her, nor did She think him a competent Judge what Ex∣penses
Princes should make: And having seen the State and Lustre in which
the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> lived in <HI>France,</HI> and having received many Infusions
from the Queen, of the great Defect in the Customs of <HI>England,</HI> in pro∣viding
either for the Respect or for the Support of the younger Sons of the
Crown, She thought that the Chancellor should rather use his Credit for the
enlarging that Narrowness, which the King was enough disposed to, than to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>reform their Expenses. But of this enough.</P>
<P>THE Plague had really swept away and destroyed so many Seamen (<HI>Step∣ney</HI>
and the Places adjacent, which were their common Habitations, being
almost depopulated) that now, all other Obstructions being removed, there
seemed even an Impossibility to procure Sailors and Mariners enough to set
out the Fleet; insomuch as They found it necessary to press many Wa∣termen,
and to disfurnish all Merchants Ships which were prepared to be set
out to the Plantations or to other Places of Trade: All which turned not
so much to Benefit one Way, as it did to Loss another Way. But the best
Way to expedite all Things was the two Admirals going to the Fleet them∣selves,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>that They who resolved to go might hasten thither, and that They
who had no Mind to go might, out of Shame, likewise accompany them.</P>
<P>THERE appeared great Unanimity and Consent between them. Only
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had a great Desire to go in a Ship apart, and that They
might not be Both in one Ship: But upon Debate it appeared to be un∣practicable,
and that in a Time of Action the Orders could not be the
same, if They who gave them were not together and in the same Place;
and so the Prince was persuaded not to be positive in that Particular.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet puts to Sea under Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>and the Gene∣ral.</HI></NOTE>
And so They Both went together, and took Leave of the King towards the
End of <HI>April,</HI> and laboured so effectually (as They were Both Men of great
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Dexterity and indefatigable Industry in such Conjunctures), that They car∣ried
the Fleet out to Sea, well fitted and provided, by the Middle of <HI>May;</HI>
with which They presently visited the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> and took many
Prizes; and by the Intelligence They met with concluded that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet would not be ready in a Month, of which They gave the King Ad∣vertisement,
and returned into the <HI>Downs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occasion of the Divi∣sion of the Fleet.</NOTE> And Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at the same
Time expressed an Inclination to go himself with Part of the Fleet to meet the
Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> who was reported to be under Sail to join with the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
and “that They would not put to Sea till They foresaw that They were
like to join about <HI>Calais.</HI>”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>AT or near the same Time the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> received Intelligence,
“that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were not yet well manned; and that the Ships which
were in the <HI>Texel,</HI> and were to join with the other under <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in
the <HI>Wierings,</HI> were more unprovided:” Though at the same Time Se∣cretary
<PB N="342" REF="346"/>
<HI>Morrice</HI> (who had always better Intelligence from <HI>Holland)</HI> was as∣sured
from thence, “that all the Ships in Both Places were so ready that
they would join within very few Days.” But the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who
thought He ought to be more believed, received as positive Advertisement
from <HI>France,</HI> “that the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> set Sail from <HI>Brest</HI> on such
“a Day:” And though the Wind had not been yet directly favourable
for him, it was concluded that He must be well advanced in his Way,
and He had no Port to Friend till He came to the Coast of <HI>France</HI>
near <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this there seemed a great Desire that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> might take the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Course He had proposed; for the Convenience was agreed to be very great,
if the <HI>French</HI> could be met with before the Conjunction. However the
Council was so wary that at that Time attended the King at <HI>Worcester-House,</HI>
the Chancellor being affected with the Gout, that They advised the
King “not to send positive Orders for the dividing the Fleet, which by
many Accidents might produce Inconveniences; but rather to send two
of the Council to the Fleet, with an Account of all the Intelligence,
and the Reflections which occurred to the King upon it.” And here∣upon
Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> were presently sent, and
carried such Orders with them, as would be necessary if the Generals had<MILESTONE N="20"/>
not other Intelligence, or did think that the Division was not liable to more
Objections than had been in View. And this Caution I set down more
particularly, because the Council underwent Reproaches which it did not
deserve.</P>
<P>THE two Counsellors used such Expedition, and found so good Conve∣niences
by Land and Water, that They returned to the King the next Day
with an Account, “that the State of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was confirmed to be
the same that his Majesty had heard, and that They believed the other
concerning the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> to be very probable; whereupon They
had concluded with a mutual Consent and Approbation, <HI>that Prince</HI> Ru∣pert<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>should take twenty of the Ships, which He had already chosen, to meet
the</HI> French, <HI>though They were superiour in Number, whilst the General re∣mained
in the</HI> Downs <HI>with the rest:</HI> And in Order to this that the Prince
went aboard his Ship before They came away, and the rather, because
the Wind was so much against him, that his Majesty's Orders, if He
found Cause to send any, would be sure for some Days to find him upon
the Western Coast; and the Wind that was against him was so favoura∣ble
to the Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> that it was probable They might speedily
meet, and in a Place to be wished.” The King saw no Cause yet to
send Orders to the Contrary; and this was the Reason, and all the Circum∣stances,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of the Separation of the Fleet that proved unfortunate.</P>
<P>IT appeared very soon after, which Secretary had the better Intelligence:
For the very next Day after the Departure of the Prince, the General, who
remained in the <HI>Downs,</HI> had certain Intelligence that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were come
out of their Harbours, having it seems received Intelligence likewise of the
<HI>French</HI> Fleet's being at Sea, and being obliged to meet them, and had been
long ready to do so; which had deceived the Court, They believing that
They stayed because They were not ready to come out, whereas They were
ready and expected only the other Advertisement.</P>
<P>As soon as the General was informed, He sent Notice presently to the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Duke late in the same Evening, who, informing the King of it, gave Or∣ders
to Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> to prepare Orders to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> imme∣diately
to return; and if those Orders had been carefully dispatched, they
<PB N="343" REF="347"/>
might have come to the Prince before the Morning.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Neglect in forwarding an Order to Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>to rejoin the Fleet.</HI></NOTE> But Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI>
thought He had done his Part when He got the Order signed, which was
about twelve of the Clock at Night, and then sent them by his Servant to
the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> whose Part He thought it was to charge a Messenger
with them: But He was gone to Bed, and his Servants durst not disquiet
him, a Tenderness not accustomed to be in the Family of a Secretary. But
whether They did not wake him, as He pretended, or being awake He de∣ferred
it, it was not sent away till the next Day, and never came to Prince
<HI>Rupert's</HI> Hand till He had turned his Sails upon the Thunder of the Can∣non;
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and no He sooner endeavoured to return, but the Wind chopped about
to retard him, that He could make little Way that Day or the Night
following. Whose Fault it was that these important Orders were not sent
with more Expedition, whether Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> ought not to have
taken Care for the conveying them, at least to have given the Lord <HI>Arling∣ton</HI>
Notice what the Contents of them were, of which He denied to have
any Notice, was disputed with some Warmth between themselves, and so
came to be published: But it was never examined any where else, though
the Negligence was very mischievous in its Effect; but They were Both too
great Men to be questioned in any Judicatory.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE General, after the Notice He had received of the Motion of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> ordered the Fleet to weigh Anchor about three of the Clock in the
Morning upon the first of <HI>June</HI> 1666,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet comes out.</NOTE> to sail to the <HI>Buoy of the Gun∣fleet</HI>
to join with some other Ships which lay there, to get more Men, being
then but ill manned: And about seven of the Clock in the Morning the
Scouts came in, and brought the General Notice, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was
to the Leeward, and probably intended to decline fighting till They might
join with the <HI>French.</HI> And it had been to be wished that the <HI>English</HI> had
stood off too, upon Confidence that Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> whom the Wind had
kept from being far off, as They could not but know, would receive Di∣rection
<MILESTONE N="30"/>from Court to return. But the General (who was as impatient upon
the Sight of an Enemy to engage with him as Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> himself, and
had a natural Contempt of the <HI>Dutch)</HI> called his Flag-Officers to Council,
and quickly resolved, “that it was not convenient nor safe nor honourable
to decline the Battle, lest it might take off the present Courage of the
Seamen.” And truly in all those Consultations, upon the like Occasions,
whoever proposed any wary Advice ran great Hazard of being reputed a
Coward. And so They bore up with a full Wind upon the Enemy, not∣withstanding
the visible Disadvantage They were in, in Respect of the Strength
of the Enemy, for in the Absence of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> there remained little
<MILESTONE N="40"/>above fifty Sail with the General; whereas <HI>De Ruyter's</HI> Fleet consisted of
above fourscore Sail, who easily perceived his Advantage, and that a great
Part of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet was absent, and so willingly embraced the Occa∣sion,
and made what Sail He could to meet with them.</P>
<P>IT was about two of the Clock in the Afternoon when the Engagement
began;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second ge∣neral Engage∣ment.</NOTE> and the <HI>English</HI> had got the Wind, which was so high that They
could not carry out their lower Tiers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Day's Action.</NOTE> The Admiral was so shattered in
his Rigging and Masts, that He was compelled to get off and anchor, that
He might mend what was amiss; and many of his Squadron had their Main∣yards
shot off, and received such Damage in their Tackling, which was
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the chief Aim of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that They could hardly govern their Ships.
And by this Means the Enemy got the Wind; and the Battle continued
with great Fierceness, and Loss of many Men on Both Sides, till nine or
ten of the Clock at Night, when all were willing to have some Rest.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="348"/>
THAT Night was spent in repairing Masts and Rigging:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Day's Action.</NOTE> And at six of
the Clock in the Morning the Battle began again with the same Fierceness,
and lasted till Night. And that Day the <HI>Dutch</HI> suffered much, and one
of their Vice-Admirals was boarded and afterwards sunk, as many of their
other Ships likewise were; so that They began to fall off: When sixteen
new great Ships came to their Aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>re∣inforced.</HI></NOTE> which gave them new Courage; so that
that They renewed and maintained the Fight with great Resolution, and
killed many Men of the <HI>English</HI> and disabled many of the Ships, till the
Night again parted them.</P>
<P>UPON the Account the General received that Night,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>retire.</HI></NOTE> and the new Ac∣cess<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of Force to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> He thought it necessary to retire; for though
He had lost no Ship, very many were so disabled, that there was Reason to
fear they would hardly hold out to recover the Shore. And thereupon
He caused all those Ships to be put before and make all the Sail they could,
and himself with sixteen Ships in a Breadth went in the Rear: Which as
soon as the Enemy perceived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Day's Action.</NOTE> They pursued, but came not within Reach
of their Guns till four of the Clock in the Afternoon; and then though
They shot hard They did very little Harm, the Sternpieces of the <HI>English</HI>
over-reaching their Broadsides, which made many of them get off as quickly
as They could. But by this Time the <HI>English</HI> descried about twenty Sail<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of Ships standing towards them, which They concluded to be Prince <HI>Ru∣pert</HI>
(as it proved): And so being earnest to join, They edged up towards
them, but so unfortunately, that many of the Flag-Ships were on Ground
off the <HI>Galloper-Sand.</HI> But with much ado they all got off safe, the
<HI>Royal Prince</HI> only excepted, which for this last Age, and till the late War,
was held the best Ship in the World. This brave Ship stuck so fast that no
Art or Industry could move her; so that the Enemy, when They found
They could not carry her off, set her on Fire, and took the Captain Sir
<HI>George Ayscue</HI> and all the Company Prisoners, and without Distinction used
all with great Barbarity, in which They pretended only to use Retaliation.<MILESTONE N="30"/>
That Night Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> joined:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>comes up with his Squadron.</HI></NOTE> And then They bore to the Northward,
that They might get clear of the Sands; and thereby the Enemy got the
Wind again.</P>
<P>THE fourth Day of the Battle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Day's Action.</NOTE> which was the fourth of <HI>June,</HI> the Enemy
being to Windward about three Leagues, the Generals in the Morning made
all Sail towards them: And They lay with their Sails to the Masts to stay
for them, which They would not have had the Courage to have done, if
They had not had Intelligence from the Prisoners of the <HI>Prince,</HI> in how tat∣tered
a Condition the Fleet was. The Battle began about eight of the
Clock in the Morning with extraordinary Confidence on Both Sides, the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>Dutch</HI> continuing their old Guard to spend all their Shot upon the Rigging
and Masts, and to defend themselves from being boarded, which the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
most intended and laboured to do. But the Design of the others suc∣ceeeded
better: Insomuch that one of the Vice-Admirals of a Squadron, and
other of the best Ships, were so disabled that They bore off from the Battle,
that They might mend and repair; which gave no small Encouragement to
the Enemy. But the two Generals were invincible, and continued the Battle
all the Day in several Forms, and by the Advantage of the Wind fired
six or seven of their Ships, and sunk others, and had two or three of their
own likewise sunk. And between six and seven at Night, as if by Consent<MILESTONE N="50"/>
(and no Doubt Both Sides were very weary of the Encounter), They se∣parated
without looking after each other, and hastened to their several
Coasts; many of the <HI>English</HI> being so hurt in Yards, Masts, Rigging
<PB N="345" REF="349"/>
and Hulls, many of them wanting Men to ply their Guns, and their Pow∣der
and Shot near spent, that with very much Difficulty they got into Har∣bour:
And so concluded that great Action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Sides claim the Vit∣tery.</NOTE> wherein either Side pretended
to have Advantage, and Both lost very much.</P>
<P>THE next Day after the Battle was spent in fitting their Masts and re∣pairing
their Rigging, that They might be able to reach the Coast: And
when They came near it, the Generals called a Council about disposing
those Ships which could not remain at Sea, and sent them to such several
Places as they might be soonest repaired in; and gave every Captain very
<MILESTONE N="10"/>strict Order, “that all possible Diligence and Expedition should be used to
get their Ships ready, and furnished with whatsoever was wanting;” and
the Commissioners of the Navy were required to be assistant in all Places.
And so wonderful Diligence was used (which appears almost incredible) that
the whole Fleet was so well fitted, that by the seventeenth Day of the
same Month, within a Fortnight after so terrible a Battle, it was gathered
together to a Rendezvous to the <HI>Buoy of the Nore.</HI> The Enemy made as
much Haste, rather to meet with the <HI>French,</HI> who were every Day still ex∣pected,
than to fight with the <HI>English,</HI> and kept as near to their own Coast
as conveniently They could: So that how ready soever the Generals were
<MILESTONE N="20"/>(who had never left their Ships) with the Fleet by the seventeenth of the
Month, the Winds were so averse or so calm, that it was the four and twen∣tieth
Day of that Month before They could reach the Sight of the Enemy.</P>
<P>AND the next Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third ge∣neral Engage∣ment.</NOTE> which was the twenty fifth, the <HI>English</HI> made
all the Sail They could, and by ten in the Morning engaged in as hot
an Encounter as had hitherto been in any Engagement: And though
the <HI>Dutch</HI> seemed not to fight with the same Spirit and Mettle, yet the
Battle held till two in the Afternoon, when by the Advantage of the
Wind They bore away faster than the <HI>English</HI> could follow.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>victorious.</HI></NOTE> However
here They took Vice-Admiral <HI>Banchart,</HI> and his Ship of threescore Guns
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and three hundred Men was burned; and another Ship of seventy Guns
and three hundred Men was likewise taken and burned; which the Ge∣nerals
thought better, than to undergo the possible Inconvenience of keep∣ing
them: And so They kept up as close to the Enemy in the Night as
They could do. The next Morning They used all their Sails, and designed
to board <HI>De Ruyter;</HI> which, the Wind lessening, They could not effect, He
fighting very well but running faster: And so, though very well pursued,
He got into his Fastness at the <HI>Wierings,</HI> with those who were nearest to
him. But the rest who were farther off, and were like to have the Benefit of
the Night, tacked about: Which They who attacked <HI>De Ruyter</HI> perceiving,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and that They could follow him no farther, and that the rest were five and
forty Sail, They followed them, the Generals doing all They could with
their Squadron to put themselves between them and the Coast; but the
Wind growing on a sudden calm, about Midnight They dropped their An∣chors,
that They might not be driven farther than They had a Mind to be.
But in the Morning, when They weighed Anchor to pursue them, and made
all the Way They could with a little Wind, the Enemy got so close to their
own Shore, their Ships drawing less Water than the <HI>English,</HI> that there could
be no farther Pursuit.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Part of the Fleet, which was separated when <HI>De Ruyter</HI> got
<MILESTONE N="50"/>into the <HI>Wierings,</HI> and which the Generals looked upon as their own, was
so unhappily pursued, though by Men of very good Name, that they es∣caped;
which raised a great Distemper in the Fleet, whilst some Officers of
the prime and most unquestionable Courage charged and accused others,
<PB N="346" REF="350"/>
who had always given great Testimony that They durst do any Thing, “of
base declining to fight when the Enemy was in their Power, and that
They chose rather to suffer them to escape than to encounter them.”
And this Dispute and Expostulation, between Men who had many Seconds,
divided the Generals, one declaring himself on the one Side as the other did
on the other; but They wisely laid aside the Debate, till They should be at
more Leisure with less Inconvenience to determine it.</P>
<P>THE Generals thereupon, having thus scattered the Enemy, resolved to
ply upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coast to take all Ships of Trade, which They did;
and off the <HI>Texel</HI> and the <HI>Flie</HI> took many Prizes, both homeward and out∣ward<MILESTONE N="10"/>
bound,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Attempt upon the Island of</HI> Schelling.</NOTE> of great Value. And They having now Nothing to do but to
lie still, there was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, one <HI>Laurence Van Humskerke,</HI> who after
the first Battle, in the Faction between <HI>Evertson</HI> and <HI>Van Trump,</HI> had
given <HI>De Wit</HI> so great an Advantage, that if He had not made his Escape
He had been hanged, who from that Time had always been on Board
with Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> This Man, whilst the Fleet lay in this Posture, ad∣vised
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to attempt a Place near the <HI>Flie,</HI> which was so locked
in the Land that it was always looked upon as very secure (and where
all Ships laden at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> for the <HI>Straits</HI> and those Parts, when they
were outward bound, used to lie two or three Days, as in a safe Port, un∣til<MILESTONE N="20"/>
all Things which might be forgotten were prepared, and all the Company
came together), and had never been invaded in any War; and by it was a
pretty large Village, called <HI>Schelling,</HI> which had many good Houses in it, be∣sides
others inhabited by, and for the Entertainment of, Seamen.</P>
<P>THIS Enterprise was committed to Sir <HI>Robert Holmes,</HI> a very bold and ex∣pert
Man; who with a Number of small Vessels very well manned, besides
a Body of stout Foot to land upon Occasions, being assisted by the <HI>Dutchman,</HI>
so vigorously assaulted it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chief Town and a large Fleet of Mer∣chant Ships burnt.</NOTE> that He burned all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships lying there,
being of inestimable Value, all outward bound, and some of them worth
above one hundred thousand Pounds each Ship. They burned likewise<MILESTONE N="30"/>
the whole Town of <HI>Schelling;</HI> which Conflagration, with that of the Ships,
appearing at the Break of Day so near <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> put that Place into that
Consternation that They thought the Day of Judgment was come, not
thinking of their Ships there, as being out of the Power or Reach of any
Enemy: And no Doubt it was the greatest Loss that State sustained in the
whole War, that is, greater than all the rest. And as this Victory, if it can
be called a Victory when there is no Resistance, occasioned great Triumph
in <HI>England,</HI> so it raised <HI>great Thoughts of Heart</HI> in <HI>De Wit,</HI> and a Reso∣lution
of Revenge before any Peace should be consented to; which They
effected to a good Degree the next Year.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THERE appeared no more Likelihood of the <HI>Dutch</HI> coming out again:
So about the fifteenth of <HI>August</HI> the Generals returned to <HI>Southwould Bay</HI> to
receive a Recruit of Men, Provisions and Ammunition, having left Ships
enough upon the Coast of <HI>Holland</HI> to take Prizes, and Scouts upon the
Coast to get Intelligence in what Readiness the Enemy's Fleet was, and
what was done within the Land. And about the twenty seventh a little
Pink, that waited upon the Coast of <HI>Zealand,</HI> brought Notice that the
Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Datch <HI>Fleet puts to Sea again.</HI></NOTE> consisting of about fourscore Sail of Ships, were ready to come out
from the <HI>Wierings;</HI> and the next Day They were assured that They were
come out and bound Westward, by which They concluded that They had<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Hope to join the <HI>French</HI> Fleet. Whereupon the Generals gave present Orders
to unmoor the Fleet; and weighing Anchor about seven of the Clock in the
Morning stood to Sea, and about Noon discovered the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet about
<PB N="347" REF="351"/>
four Leagues to the Leeward. The Generals made all Sail towards them:
But the Enemy stood away for the Coast of <HI>Flanders,</HI> whilst the <HI>English</HI>
were so entangled upon the <HI>Galloper-Sands,</HI> that They could not stand af∣ter
the Enemy till late in the Afternoon; so that it was Night before They
came near each other, and then several Guns were fired to little Purpose.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, being the first of <HI>September,</HI> the Season when the
Winds begin to grow boisterous, They had upon the breaking of the Day lost
the Sight of the Enemy, though They believed that They had bore up in the
Night for them: But when it was Light, They found that They were to the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Leeward as far as They could discover, near <HI>St. John's Bay</HI> beyond <HI>Calais.</HI>
The <HI>English</HI> pursued them, and making some Stay for the Fireships, which
could not make Haste by Reason of the blustering Weather, it was four in
the Afternoon before the Fleet came up together to them; when <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI>
made a Shew as if He would draw off from the Shore towards them.
But when He saw the <HI>English</HI> stand with him and advance with their usual
Resolution, He tacked back again, and stood close in to the Shore, where
the rest of the Fleet was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>Fleet dispersed by a Storm.</HI></NOTE> in the Bay of <HI>Staples.</HI> And then the Night
came; and the Wind blew so violently, that the <HI>English</HI> were forced to
tack, and many of the Ships were forced to the Leeward, the Night being
<MILESTONE N="20"/>so foul, that neither the Generals nor the chief Flags could be discerned.
And though the Storm continued very violent the next Day, a good Part of
the Fleet got again together, and stood to the Bay of <HI>Staples,</HI> where the
<HI>Dutch</HI> still remained close under the Shore at Anchor, but could not be in∣vited
to come out. So the <HI>English</HI> found it necessary to stand farther out
to the Sea; and then They discovered the rest of the Fleet at a great Di∣stance
to the Leeward, and so bore after them, and at Night They all ar∣rived
at <HI>St. Helen's Point.</HI> And though the Tempest still increased, a Squa∣dron
went every Day out to the Coast of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Tempest the <HI>French</HI> Fleet had a very narrow Escape,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Fleet has a narrow Escape.</HI></NOTE> by a Pro∣vidence
<MILESTONE N="30"/>They are seldom without. A Gentleman of good Quality of that
Nation returned at this Time out of <HI>England</HI> (whither They repaired with
as much Liberty and were as kindly treated as if there were no War, whilst
no <HI>Englishman</HI> could be safe there); and landing at <HI>Calais,</HI> and finding that
the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was every Day expected, He dispatched two or three
Barks to find him, with Information how and where the <HI>English</HI> lay; one
of which came so luckily to him towards the Evening, that He changed
his Course, and by the Darkness of the Night got into the Road of <HI>Diepe,</HI>
where He dropped his Anchors. But his Vice-Admiral, being the biggest and
the best Ship but one in the Fleet, and carrying seventy Pieces of Cannon,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>pursuing the Course He was directed, in the Dark of the Night fell amongst
the <HI>English,</HI> as the rest had done if it had not been for that Advertisement;
and after a little defending himself, which He saw was to no Purpose, was
taken Prisoner, and desired to be brought to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who knew him
well, and treated him as a gallant Person ought to be, and caused many
Things which belonged to his own Person to be restored to him; and when
He was brought into <HI>England,</HI> He found another Kind of Reception
(though He was Prisoner in the <HI>Tower</HI>) than any of the <HI>English,</HI> though of
the same Quality, met with abroad. By this Accident the <HI>French</HI> Fleet made
a happy Escape: And the Continuance of the Storm for many Days kept the
<MILESTONE N="50"/><HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> from any farther Engagement. But the same Winds,
and at the same Time, did much more Mischief at Land than at Sea.</P>
<P>IT was upon the first Day of that <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of</HI> London.</NOTE> in the dismal Year of 1666
(in which many Prodigies were expected and so many really fell out), that
<PB N="348" REF="352"/>
that memorable and terrible Fire brake out in <HI>London,</HI> which begun about
Midnight, or nearer the Morning of <HI>Sunday,</HI> in a Baker's House at the End
of <HI>Thames Street</HI> next the <HI>Tower,</HI> there being many little narrow Alleys
and very poor Houses about the Place where it first appeared; and then
finding such Store of combustible Materials, as that Street is always fur∣nished
with in Timber-Houses, the Fire prevailed so powerfully, that that
whole Street and the Neighbourhood was in so short a Time turned to
Ashes, that few Persons had Time to save and preserve any of their Goods;
but were a Heap of People almost as dead with the sudden Distraction, as
the Ruins were which They sustained. The Magistrates of the City assem∣bled<MILESTONE N="10"/>
quickly together, and with the usual Remedies of Buckets, which They
were provided with: But the Fire was too ravenous to be extinguished with
such Quantities of Water as those Instruments could apply to it, and fas∣tened
still upon new Materials before it had destroyed the old. And though
it raged furiously all that Day, to that Degree that all Men stood amazed, as
Spectators only, no Man knowing what Remedy to apply, nor the Magis∣trates
what Orders to give: Yet it kept within some Compass, burned what was
next, and laid Hold only on Both Sides; and the greatest Apprehension was
of the <HI>Tower,</HI> and all Considerations entered upon how to secure that Place.</P>
<P>BUT in the Night the Wind changed, and carried the Danger from<MILESTONE N="20"/>
thence, but with so great and irresistible Violence, that as it kept the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets from grappling when they were so near each other, so
it scattered the Fire from pursuing the Line it was in with all its Force, and
spread it over the City: So that They, who went late to Bed at a great Dis∣stance
from any Place where the Fire prevailed, were awakened before Morn∣ing
with their own House's being in a Flame; and whilst Endeavour was used
to quench that, other Houses were discovered to be burning, which were
near no Place from whence They could imagine the Fire could come; all
which kindled another Fire in the Breasts of Men, almost as dangerous as
that within their Houses.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>MONDAY Morning produced first a Jealousy, and then an universal Con∣clusion,
that this Fire came not by Chance, nor did They care where it
began; but the breaking out in several Places at so great Distance from
each other made it evident, that it was by Conspiracy and Combination.
And this Determination could not hold long without Discovery of the
wicked Authors, who were concluded to be all the <HI>Dutch</HI> and all the
<HI>French</HI> in the Town, though They had inhabited the same Places above
twenty Years. All of that Kind, or, if They were Strangers, of what Na∣tion
soever, were laid Hold of; and after all the ill Usage that can consist in
Words, and some Blows and Kicks, They were thrown into Prison. And<MILESTONE N="40"/>
shortly after, the same Conclusion comprehended all the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI>
who were in the same Predicament of Guilt and Danger, and quickly
found that their only Safety consisted in keeping within Doors; and yet
some of them, and of Quality, were taken by Force out of their Houses
and carried to Prison.</P>
<P>WHEN this Rage spread as far as the Fire, and every Hour brought Reports
of some bloody Effects of it, worse than in Truth there were, the King dis∣tributed
many of the Privy Council into several Quarters of the City, to
prevent, by their Authorities, those Inhumanities which He heard were com∣mitted.
In the mean Time, even They or any other Person thought it<MILESTONE N="50"/>
not safe to declare, “that They believed that the Fire came by Accident, or
that it was not a Plot of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> to burn the
City;” which was so generally believed, and in the best Company, that
<PB N="349" REF="353"/>
He who said the Contrary was suspected for a Conspirator, or at best a Fa∣vourer
of them. It could not be conceived, how a House that was distant
a Mile from any Part of the Fire could suddenly be in a Flame, without
some particular Malice; and this Case fell out every Hour. When a Man
at the farthest End of <HI>Bread-Street</HI> had made a Shift to get out of his House
his best and most portable Goods, because the Fire had approached near
them; He no sooner had secured them, as He thought, in some Friend's
House in <HI>Holborn,</HI> which was believed a safe Distance, but He saw that
very House, and none else near it, in a sudden Flame. Nor did there
<MILESTONE N="10"/>want, in this woful Distemper, the Testimony of Witnesses who saw this
Villany committed, and apprehended Men who They were ready to swear
threw Fireballs into Houses, which were presently burning.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> and Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> who had their Quarters assigned about
<HI>Newgate-Market</HI> and the Streets adjacent, had many brought to them in
Custody for Crimes of this Nature; and saw, within a very little Distance from
the Place where They were, the People gathered together in great Disorder;
and as They came nearer saw a Man in the Middle of them without a
Hat or Cloak, pulled and hauled and very ill used, whom They knew to
be a Servant to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ambassadour, who was presently brought to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>them. And a substantial Citizen was ready to take his Oath, “that He
saw that Man put his Hand in his Pocket, and throw into a Shop a Fire∣ball;
upon which He saw the House immediately on Fire: Whereupon,
being on the other Side of the Way, and seeing this, He cried out to the
People to stop that Gentleman, and made all the Haste He could him∣self;”
but the People had first seized upon him, and taken away his
Sword, which He was ready to draw; and He not speaking nor under∣standing
<HI>English,</HI> They had used him in the Manner set down before. The
Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> told him what He was accused of, and “that He was seen to
have thrown Somewhat out of his Pocket, which They thought to be a
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Fireball, into a House which was now on Fire;” and the People had di∣ligently
searched his Pockets to find more of the same Commodities, but
found Nothing that They meant to accuse him of. The Man standing in
great Amazement to hear He was so charged, the Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> asked him,
“what it was that He pulled out of his Pocket, and what it was He
threw into the House:” To which He answered, “that He did not think
that He had put his Hand into his Pocket; but He remembered very well,
that as He walked in the Street He saw a Piece of Bread upon the Ground,
which He took up and laid upon a Shelf in the next House;” which is a
Custom or Superstition so natural to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> that if the King of
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>Portugal</HI> were walking, and saw a Piece of Bread upon the Ground, He
would take it up with his own Hand, and keep it till He saw a fit Place to
lay it down.</P>
<P>THE House being in View, the Lords with many of the People walked
to it, and found the Piece of Bread just within the Door upon a Board,
where He said He laid it; and the House on Fire was two Doors beyond
it, which the Man who was on the other Side of the Way, and saw this
Man put his Hand into the House without staying, and presently after the
Fire break out, concluded to be the same House; which was very natural
in the Fright that all Men were in: Nor did the Lords, though They were
<MILESTONE N="50"/>satisfied, set the poor Man at Liberty; but, as if there remained Ground
enough of Suspicion, committed him to the Constable, to be kept by him
in his own House for some Hours, when They pretended They would exa∣mine
him again. Nor were any Persons who were seized upon in the same
<PB N="350" REF="354"/>
Manner, as Multitudes were in all the Parts of the Town, especially if They
were Strangers or <HI>Papists,</HI> presently discharged, when there was no reason∣able
Ground to suspect; but all sent to Prison, where They were in much more
Security than They could have been in full Liberty, after They were once
known to have been suspected; and most of them understood their Com∣mitment
to be upon that Ground, and were glad of it.</P>
<P>THE Fire and the Wind continued in the same Excess all <HI>Monday, Tues∣day,</HI>
and <HI>Wednesday</HI> till Afternoon, and flung and scattered Brands burn∣ing
into all Quarters; the Nights more terrible than the Days, and the
Light the same, the Light of the Fire supplying that of the Sun. And in∣deed<MILESTONE N="10"/>
whoever was an Eyewitness of that terrible Prospect, can never have
so lively an Image of the last Conflagration till He beholds it; the Faces of
all People in a wonderful Dejection and Discomposure, not knowing where
They could repose themselves for one Hour's Sleep, and no Distance thought
secure from the Fire, which suddenly started up before it was suspected; so
that People left their Houses and carried away their Goods from many Places
which received no Hurt, and whither They afterwards returned again; all
the Fields full of Women and Children, who had made a Shift to bring
thither some Goods and Conveniences to rest upon, as safer than any Houses,
where yet They felt such intolerable Heat and Drought, as if They had<MILESTONE N="20"/>
been in the Middle of the Fire. The King and the Duke, who rode from
one Place to another, and put themselves into great Dangers amongst the
burning and falling Houses, to give Advice and Direction what was to be
done, underwent as much Fatigue as the meanest, and had as little Sleep
or Rest; and the Faces of all Men appeared ghastly and in the highest Con∣fusion.
The Country sent in Carts to help those miserable People who had
saved any Goods: And by this Means, and the Help of Coaches, all the neigh∣bour
Villages were filled with more People than they could contain, and
more Goods than they could find Room for; so that those Fields became
likewise as full as the other about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>IT was observed that where the Fire prevailed most, when it met with
brick Buildings, if it was not repulsed, it was so well resisted that it made
a much slower Progress; and when it had done its Worst, that the Tim∣ber
and all the combustible Matter fell, it fell down to the Bottom within
the House, and the Walls stood and enclosed the Fire, and it was burned out
without making a farther Progress in many of those Places; and then the
Vacancy so interrupted the Fury of it, that many Times the two or three
next Houses stood without much Damage. Besides the spreading, insomuch
as all <HI>London</HI> seemed but one Fire in the Breadth of it, it seemed to con∣tinue
in its full Fury a direct Line to the <HI>Thames</HI> Side, all <HI>Cheapside</HI> from<MILESTONE N="40"/>
beyond the <HI>Exchange,</HI> through <HI>Fleetstreet;</HI> insomuch as for that Breadth,
taking in Both Sides as far as the <HI>Thames,</HI> there was scarce a House or
Church standing from the Bridge to <HI>Dorset-House,</HI> which was burned on
<HI>Tuesday</HI> Night after <HI>Baynard's Castle.</HI></P>
<P>ON <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning, when the King saw that neither the Fire de∣creased
nor the Wind lessened, He even despaired of preserving <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
but was more afraid of <HI>Westminster-Abbey.</HI> But having observed by his
having visited all Places, that where there were any vacant Places between
the Houses, by which the Progress of the Fire was interrupted, it changed its
Course and went to the other Side; He gave Order for pulling down many<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Houses about <HI>Whitehall,</HI> some whereof were newly built and hardly finished,
and sent many of his choice Goods by Water to <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> as most of
<PB N="351" REF="355"/>
the Persons of Quality in the <HI>Strand,</HI> who had the Benefit of the River,
got Barges and other Vessels, and sent their Furniture for their Houses to
some Houses some Miles out of the Town. And very many on Both Sides
the <HI>Strand,</HI> who knew not whither to go, and scarce what They did, fled
with their Families out of their Houses into the Streets, that They might
not be within when the Fire fell upon their Houses.</P>
<P>BUT it pleased God, contrary to all Expectation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fire de∣creases.</NOTE> that on <HI>Wednesday,</HI> about
four or five of the Clock in the Afternoon, the Wind fell: And as in an Instant
the Fire decreased, having burned all on the <HI>Thames</HI> Side to the New Buildings
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI> next to <HI>White-Friars,</HI> and having consumed them, was
stopped by that Vacancy from proceeding farther into that House; but laid
Hold on some old Buildings which joined to <HI>Ram-Alley,</HI> and swept all those
into <HI>Fleet Street.</HI> And the other Side being likewise destroyed to <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI>
it advanced no farther; but left the other Part of <HI>Fleet Street</HI> to the <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI>
and all the <HI>Strand,</HI> unhurt, but what Damage the Owners of the
Houses had done to themselves by endeavouring to remove; and it ceased in
all other Parts of the Town near the same Time: So that the greatest Care
then was, to keep good Guards to watch the Fire that was upon the
Ground, that it might not break out again. And this was the better per∣formed,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>because They who had yet their Houses standing had not the
Courage to sleep, but watched with much less Distraction; though the same
Distemper still remained in the utmost Extent, “that all this had fallen out
by the Conspiracy of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> with the <HI>Papists;</HI>” and all Gaols
were filled with those who were every Hour apprehended upon that Jea∣lousy,
or rather upon some Evidence that They were guilty of the Crime.
And the People were so sottish, that They believed that all the <HI>French</HI> in the
Town (which no Doubt were a very great Number) were drawn into a Body,
to prosecute those by the Sword who were preserved from the Fire: And
the Inhabitants of a whole Street have ran in a great Tumult one Way,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>upon the Rumour that the <HI>French</HI> were marching at the other End of it; so
terrified Men were with their own Apprehensions.</P>
<P>WHEN the Night, though far from being a quiet one, had somewhat les∣sened
the Consternation, the first Care the King took was, that the Country
might speedily supply Markets in all Places, that They who had saved
themselves from burning might not be in Danger of starving; and if there
had not been extraordinary Care and Diligence used, many would have pe∣rished
that Way. The vast Destruction of Corn, and all other Sorts of
Provisions, in those Parts where the Fire had prevailed, had not only left
all that People destitute of all that was to be eat or drank; but the Bakers
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and Brewers, which inhabited the other Parts which were unhurt, had for∣saken
their Houses, and carried away all that was portable: Insomuch as
many Days passed, before They were enough in their Wits and in their
Houses to fall to their Occupations; and those Parts of the Town which
God had spared and preserved were many Hours without any Thing to eat,
as well as They who were in the Fields. And yet it can hardly be con∣ceived,
how great a Supply of all Kinds was brought from all Places within
four and twenty Hours. And which was more miraculous, in four Days,
in all the Fields about the Town, which had seemed covered with those
whose Habitations were burned, and with the Goods which They had saved,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>there was scarce a Man to be seen: All found Shelter in so short a Time,
either in those Parts which remained of the City and in the Suburbs, or
in the neighbour Villages; all Kind of People expressing a marvellous
Charity towards those who appeared to be undone. And very many, with
<PB N="352" REF="356"/>
more Expedition than can be conceived, set up little Sheds of Brick and
Timber upon the Ruins of their own Houses, where They chose rather to
inhabit than in more convenient Places, though They knew They could
not long reside in those new Buildings.</P>
<P>THE King was not more troubled at any Particular, than at the Ima∣gination
which possessed the Hearts of so many, that all this Mischief had
fallen out by a real and formed Conspiracy; which, albeit He saw no Co∣lour
to believe, He found very many intelligent Men, and even some of his
own Council, who did really believe it. Whereupon He appointed the
Privy Council to sit both Morning and Evening, to examine all Evidence<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of that Kind that should be brought before them, and to send for any Per∣sons
who had been committed to Prison upon some Evidence that made the
greatest Noise; and sent for the Lord Chief Justice, who was in the Coun∣try,
to come to the Town for the better Examination of all Suggestions and
Allegations of that Kind, there having been some malicious Report scat∣tered
about the Town, “that the Court had so great a Prejudice against any
Kind of Testimony of such a Conspiracy, that They discountenanced all
Witnesses who came before them to testify what They knew;” which was
without any Colour of Truth. Yet many, who were produced as if
their Testimony would remove all Doubts, made such senseless Relations<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of what They had been told, without knowing the Condition of the Per∣sons
who told them, or where to find them, that it was a hard Matter
to forbear smiling at their Evidence. Some <HI>Frenchmens</HI> Houses had been
searched, in which had been found many of those Shells for Squibs and
other Fireworks, frequently used in Nights of Joy and Triumph; and
the Men were well known, and had lived many Years there by that Trade,
and had no other: And one of these was the King's Servant, and employed
by the Office of Ordnance for making Grenades of all Kinds, as well for
the Hand as for Mortarpieces. Yet these Men were looked upon as in the
Number of the Conspirators, and remained still in Prison till their Neigh∣bours<MILESTONE N="30"/>
solicited for their Liberty. And it cannot be enough wondered at,
that in this general Rage of the People no Mischief was done to the
Strangers, that no one of them was assassinated outright, though many were
sorely beaten and bruised.</P>
<P>THERE was a very odd Accident that confirmed many in what They
were inclined to believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubert's <HI>strange Con∣session.</HI></NOTE> and startled others, who thought the Conspiracy im∣possible,
since no Combination not very discernible and discovered could have
effected that Mischief, in which the immediate Hand of God was so visible.
Amongst many <HI>Frenchmen</HI> who had been sent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> there was one
<HI>Hubert,</HI> a young Man of five or six and twenty Years of Age, the Son of a<MILESTONE N="40"/>
famous Watchmaker in the City of <HI>Roan;</HI> and this Fellow had wrought in
the same Profession with several Men in <HI>London,</HI> and had for many Years both
in <HI>Roan</HI> and in <HI>London</HI> been looked upon as distracted. This Man con∣fessed
“that He had set the first House on Fire, and that He had been
hired in <HI>Paris</HI> a Year before to do it: That there were three more com∣bined
with him to do the same Thing, and that They came over toge∣ther
into <HI>England</HI> to put it in Execution in the Time of the Plague;
but when They were in <HI>London,</HI> He and two of his Companions went
into <HI>Sweden,</HI> and returned from thence in the latter End of <HI>August,</HI> and
He resolved to undertake it; and that the two others went away into<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<HI>France.”</HI></P>
<P>THE whole Examination was so senseless, that the Chief Justice, who
was not looked upon as a Man who wanted Rigour, did not believe any
<PB N="353" REF="357"/>
Thing He said. He was asked, “who it was in <HI>Paris</HI> that suborned him
to this Action:” To which He answered, “that He did not know, having
never seen him before;” and in the enlarging upon that Point He con∣tradicted
himself in many Particulars. Being asked “what Money He had
received to perform a Service of so much Hazard,” He said, “He had
received but a <HI>Pistole,</HI> but was promised five <HI>Pistoles</HI> more when He should
have done his Work;” and many such unreasonable Things, that Nobody
present credited any Thing He said. However They durst not slight the
Evidence, but put him to a Particular, in which He so fully confirmed all
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that He had said before, that They were surprised with Wonder, and knew
not afterwards what to say or think. They asked him, “if He knew the
Place where He first put Fire;” He answered, “that He knew it very
well, and would shew it to any Body.” Upon this the Chief Justice,
and many Aldermen who fate with him, sent a Guard of substantial Citi∣zens
with the Prisoner, that He might shew them the House; and They
first led him to a Place at some Distance from it, and asked him “if that
were it;” to which He answered presently, “No, it was lower, nearer
to the <HI>Thames.”</HI> The House and all which were near it were so covered
and buried in Ruins, that the Owners themselves, without some infallible
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Mark, could very hardly have said where their own Houses had stood: But
this Man led them directly to the Place, described how it stood, the Shape
of the little Yard, the Fashion of the Door and Windows, and where He
first put the Fire; and all this with such Exactness, that They who had
dwelt long near it could not so perfectly have described all Particulars.</P>
<P>THIS silenced all farther Doubts. And though the Chief Justice told the
King, “that all his Discourse was so disjointed that He did not believe him
guilty;” nor was there one Man who prosecuted or accused him: Yet upon
his own Confession, and so sensible a Relation of all that He had done, ac∣companied
with so many Circumstances (though without the least Shew of
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Compunction or Sorrow for what He said He had done, nor yet seeming to
justify or to take Delight in it; but being asked whether He was not sorry for
the Wickedness, and whether He intended to do so much, He gave no
Answer at all, or made Reply to what was said; and with the same Tem∣per
died),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which He is executed.</NOTE> the Jury found him guilty, and He was executed accordingly.
And though no Man could imagine any Reason why a Man should so des∣perately
throw away his Life, which He might have saved though He had
been guilty, since He was only accused upon his own Confession; yet neither
the Judges nor any present at the Trial did believe him guilty, but that He
was a poor distracted Wretch weary of his Life, and chose to part with it
<MILESTONE N="40"/>this Way. Certain it is, that upon the strictest Examination that could be
afterwards made by the King's Command, and then by the Diligence of
the House, that upon the general Jealousy and Rumour made a Commit∣tee,
that was very diligent and solicitous to make that Discovery, there was
never any probable Evidence (that poor Creature's only excepted) that there
was any other Cause of that wosul Fire, than the Displeasure of God Al∣mighty:
The first Accident of the Beginning in a Baker's House, where
there was so great a Stock of Faggots, and the Neighbourhood of much
combustible Matter, of Pitch and Rosin and the like, led it in an Instant
from House to House through <HI>Thames Street,</HI> with the Agitation of so ter∣rible
<MILESTONE N="50"/>a Wind to scatter and disperse it.</P>
<P>LET the Cause be what it would, the Effect was very terrible; for above
two Parts of three of that great City were burned to Ashes, and those the
most rich and wealthy Parts of the City, where the greatest Warehouses and
<PB N="354" REF="358"/>
the best Shops stood. The <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI> with all the Streets about it,
<HI>Lombard Street, Cheapside, Paternoster-Row, St. Paul's</HI> Church, and almost
all the other Churches in the City, with the <HI>Old Bailey, Ludgate,</HI> all <HI>Paul's
Church-Yard</HI> even to the <HI>Thames,</HI> and the greatest Part of <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> all which
were Places the best inhabited, were all burned without one House remaining.</P>
<P>THE Value or Estimate of what that devouring Fire consumed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inestima∣ble Loss sus∣tained by the Fire.</NOTE> over and
above the Houses, could never be computed in any Degree: For besides
that the first Night (which in a Moment swept away the vast Wealth of
<HI>Thames Street)</HI> there was not any Thing that could be preserved in Respect
of the Suddenness and Amazement (all People being in their Beds till the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Fire was in their Houses, and so could save Nothing but themselves), the
next Day with the Violence of the Wind increased the Distraction; nor did
many believe that the Fire was near them, or that They had Reason to re∣move
their Goods, till it was upon them and rendered it impossible. Then
it fell out at a Season in the Year, the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when very
many of the substantial Citizens and other wealthy Men were in the Coun∣try,
whereof many had not left a Servant in their Houses, thinking them∣selves
upon all ordinary Accidents more secure in the Goodness and Kind∣ness
of their Neighbours, than They could be in the Fidelity of a Servant;
and whatsoever was in such Houses was entirely consumed by the Fire, or<MILESTONE N="20"/>
lost as to the Owners. And of this <HI>Classis</HI> of absent Men, when the Fire
came where the Lawyers had Houses, as They had in many Places, espe∣cially
<HI>Serjeants-Inn</HI> in <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> with that Part of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI> that
was next it and <HI>White-Friars,</HI> there was scarce a Man to whom those
Lodgings appertained who was in the Town: So that whatsoever was
there, their Money, Books and Papers, besides the Evidences of many Mens
Estates deposited in their Hands, were all burned or lost, to a very great Va∣lue.
But of particular Mens Losses could never be made any Computation.</P>
<P>IT was an incredible Damage that was and might rationally be com∣puted
to be sustained by one small Company, the Company of Stationers,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in Books, Paper, and the other lesser Commodities which are vendible in that
Corporation, which amounted to no less than two hundred thousand Pounds:
In which prodigious Loss there was one Circumstance very lamentable. All
those who dwelt near <HI>Paul's</HI> carried their Goods, Books, Paper, and the like,
as others of greater Trades did their Commodities, into the large Vaults which
were under <HI>St. Paul's</HI> Church, before the Fire came thither: Which Vaults,
though all the Church above the Ground was afterwards burned, with all the
Houses round about, still stood firm and supported the Foundation, and
preserved all that was within them; until the Impatience of those who had
lost their Houses, and whatsoever They had else, in the Fire, made them<MILESTONE N="40"/>
very desirous to see what They had saved, upon which all their Hopes were
founded to repair the rest.</P>
<P>IT was the fourth Day after the Fire ceased to flame, though it still
burned in the Ruins, from whence there was still an intolerable Heat,
when the Booksellers especially, and some other Tradesmen, who had de∣posited
all They had preserved in the greatest and most spacious Vault,
came to behold all their Wealth, which to that Moment was safe: But the
Doors were no sooner opened, and the Air from without fanned the strong
Heat within, but first the dryost and most combustible Matters broke into a
Flame, which consumed all, of what Kind soever, that till then had been<MILESTONE N="50"/>
unhurt there. Yet They who had committed their Goods to some lesser
Vaults, at a Distance from that greater, had better Fortune; and having
learned from the second Ruin of their Friends to have more Patience, at∣tended
<PB N="355" REF="359"/>
till the Rain fell, and extinguished the Fire in all Places, and cooled
the Air: And then They securely opened the Doors, and received all from
thence that They had there.</P>
<P>IF so vast a Damage as two hundred thousand Pounds befell that little
Company of Stationers in Books and Paper and the like, what shall We
conceive was lost in Cloth (of which the Country Clothiers lost all that
They had brought up to <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> against <HI>Michaelmass,</HI> which was all
burned with that fair Structure), in Silks of all Kinds, in Linen, and those
richer Manufactures? Not to speak of Money, Plate and Jewels, whereof
<MILESTONE N="10"/>some were recovered out of the Ruins of those Houses which the Owners took
Care to watch, as containing Somewhat that was worth the looking for,
and in which Deluge there were Men ready enough to fish.</P>
<P>THE Lord Mayor, though a very honest Man, was much blamed for
Want of Sagacity in the first Night of the Fire, before the Wind gave it
much Advancement: For though He came with great Diligence as soon as
He had Notice of it, and was present with the first, yet having never been
used to such Spectacles, his Consternation was equal to that of other Men,
nor did He know how to apply his Authority to the remedying the present
Distress; and when Men who were less terrified with the Object pressed him
<MILESTONE N="20"/>very earnestly, “that He would give Order for the present pulling down
those Houses which were nearest, and by which the Fire climbed to go
farther” (the doing whereof at that Time might probably have prevented
much of the Mischief that succeeded), He thought it not safe Counsel,
and made no other Answer, “than that He durst not do it without the
Consent of the Owners.” His Want of Skill was the less wondered at,
when it was known afterwards, that some Gentlemen of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI>
would not endeavour to preserve the Goods which were in the Lodgings of
absent Persons, nor suffer others to do it, “because,” They said, “it was
against the Law to break up any Man's Chamber.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE so sudden Repair of those formidable Ruins, and the giving so great
Beauty to all Deformity (a Beauty and a Lustre that City had never before
been acquainted with), is little less wonderful than the Fire that consumed it.</P>
<P>IT was hoped and expected that this prodigious and universal Calamity,
for the Effects of it covered the whole Kingdom, would have made Im∣pression,
and produced some Reformation in the License of the Court:
For as the Pains the King had taken Night and Day during the Fire,
and the Dangers He had exposed himself to, even for the saving the Citi∣zens
Goods, had been very notorious, and in the Mouths of all Men, with
good Wishes and Prayers for him; so his Majesty had been heard during
<MILESTONE N="40"/>that Time to speak with great Piety and Devotion of the Displeasure that
God was provoked to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King se∣riously affected with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ca∣lamity.</NOTE> And no Doubt the deep Sense of it did raise many
good Thoughts and Purposes in his Royal Breast. But He was narrowly
watched and looked to, that such melancholick Thoughts might not long
possess him, the Consequence and Effect whereof was like to be more
grievous than that of the Fire itself; of which that loose Company that was
too much cherished, even before it was extinguished, discoursed as of an
Argument for Mirth and Wit to describe the Wildness of the Confusion all
People were in; in which the Scripture itself was used with equal Liberty,
when They could apply it to their profane Purposes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures ta∣ken to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in him.</NOTE> And Mr. <HI>May</HI> pre∣sumed
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to assure the King, “that this was the greatest Blessing that God had
ever conferred upon him, his Restoration only excepted: For the Walls
and Gates being now burned and thrown down of that rebellious City,
which was always an Enemy to the Crown, his Majesty would never suf∣fer
<PB N="356" REF="360"/>
them to repair and build them up again to be a <HI>Bit in his Mouth and
a Bridle upon his Neck;</HI> but would keep all open, that his Troops might
enter upon them whenever He thought necessary for his Service, there
being no other Way to govern that rude Multitude but by Force.”</P>
<P>THIS Kind of Discourse did not please the King, but was highly ap∣proved
by the Company; and for the Wit and Pleasantness of it was re∣peated
in all Companies, infinitely to the King's Disservice, and corrupted
the Affections of the Citizens and of the Country, who used and assumed the
same Liberty to publish the Profaneness and Atheism of the Court. And as
Nothing was done there in private, so it was made more publick in Pasquils<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and Libels, which were as bold with Reflections of the broadest Nature upon
the King himself, and upon those in whose Company He was most delighted,
as upon the meanest Person.</P>
<P>ALL Men of Virtue and Sobriety, of which there were very many in the
King's Family, were grieved and heartbroken with hearing what They could
not choose but hear, and seeing many Things which They could not avoid
the seeing. There were few of the Council that did not to one another la∣ment
the Excesses, which must in Time be attended with fatal Consequences,
and for the present did apparently lessen the Reverence to the King, that is
the best Support of his Royalty: But few of them had the Courage to say<MILESTONE N="20"/>
that to his Majesty, which was not so fit to be said to any Body else. Nor
can it be denied, that his Majesty did, upon all Occasions, receive those
Advertisements from those who presented them to him, with Patience and
Benignity, and without the least Shew of Displeasure; though the Persons
concerned endeavoured no one Thing more than to persuade him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And to lesson his Esteem of the Privy Council.</NOTE> “that
it was the highest Presumption imaginable in the Privy Council to be∣lieve,
that They had any Jurisdiction in the Court, or ought to censure
the Manners of it.”</P>
<P>NOR were all those Endeavours without making some Impression upon
his Majesty, who rather esteemed some particular Members of it, than was<MILESTONE N="30"/>
inclined to believe that the Body of it ought to receive a Reverence from the
People, or be looked upon as a vital Part of the Government: In which
his Majesty (as hath been often said before) by the ill Principles He had re∣ceived
in <HI>France,</HI> and the accustomed Liberty of his Bedchamber, was ex∣ceedingly
and unhappily mistaken. For by the Constitution of the King∣dom,
and the very Laws and Customs of the Nation, as the Privy Council
and every Member of it is of the King's sole Choice and Election of him to
that Trust (for the greatest Office in the State, though conferred likewise by
the King himself, doth not qualify the Officer to be of the Privy Council,
or to be present in it, before by a new Assignation that Honour is bestowed<MILESTONE N="40"/>
on him, and that He be sworn of the Council); so the Body of it is the
most sacred, and hath the greatest Authority in the Government of the
State, next the Person of the King himself, to whom all other Powers are
equally subject: And no King of <HI>England</HI> can so well secure his own just
Prerogative, or preserve it from Violation, as by a strict defending and sup∣porting
the Dignity of his Privy Council.</P>
<P>WHEN it was too much taken Notice of, that the King himself had not
that Esteem or Consideration of the Council that was due to it, what They
did or ordered to be done was less valued by the People; and that Disres∣pect
every Day improved by the Want of Gravity and Justice and Constancy<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in the Proceedings there, the Resolutions of one Day being reversed or al∣tered
the next, either upon some Whispers in the King's Ear, or some new
Fancy in some of those Counsellors, who were always of one Mind against
<PB N="357" REF="361"/>
all former Orders and Precedents; the Pride and insolent Humour of Sir
<HI>William Coventry</HI> taking not so much Delight in any Thing, as to cross
and oppose whatsoever the Chancellor or the Treasurer advised, and to re∣verse
what had been ordered upon that Ground. And though He had
sucked his Milk at the Charge of the Law, no Man was so professed an
Enemy to it and to the Professors of it, and shewed so little Respect to any
Thing passed and granted under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> but spake against
it with the same Confidence as if it had been a common Scroll of no Signifi∣cation;
which Kind of Behaviour in a Person unqualified by any Office to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>speak much in such an Assembly, as it had never been accustomed, so it
would have found much Reprehension there, if it had not been for Respect
to the Duke, and if the King himself had not very often declared himself to
be of his Opinion, even in Particulars which himself had caused to be pro∣posed
to a contrary Purpose.</P>
<P>ONE Day his Majesty called the Chancellor to him, and complained
very much of the License that was assumed in the Coffeehouses, which
were the Places where the boldest Calumnies and Scandals were raised, and
discoursed amongst a People who knew not each other, and came together
only for that Communication, and from thence were propagated over the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Kingdom; and mentioned some particular Rumours which had been lately
dispersed from those Fountains, which on his own Behalf He was enough
displeased with, and asked him what was to be done in it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor concurred with him in the Sense of the Scandal, and
the Mischief that must attend the Impunity of such Places, where the foulest
Imputations were laid upon the Government, which were held lawful to be
reported and divulged to every Body but to the Magistrates, who might ex∣amine
and punish them; of which there having yet been no Precedent, Peo∣ple
generally believed that those Houses had a Charter of Privilege to speak
what They would, without being in Danger to be called in Question: And
<MILESTONE N="30"/>“that it was high Time for his Majesty to apply some Remedy to such a
growing Disease, and to reform the Understanding of those who believed
that no Remedy could be applied to it. That it would be fit, either by
a Proclamation to forbid all Persons to resort to those Houses, and so to∣tally
to suppress them; or to employ some Spies, who, being present in
the Conversation, might be ready to charge and accuse the Persons who
had talked with most License in a Subject that would bear a Complaint;
upon which the Proceedings might be in such a Manner, as would put an
End to the Confidence that was only mischievous in those Meetings.” The
King liked Both the Expedients, and thought that the last could not justly
<MILESTONE N="40"/>be made Use of till the former should give fair Warning; and commanded
him to propose it that same Day in Council, that some Order might be
given in it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor proposed it, as He was required, with such Arguments
as were like to move with Men who knew the Inconveniences which arose
from those Places; and the King himself mentioned it with Passion, as de∣rogatory
to the Government, and directed that the Attorney might prepare
a Proclamation for the Suppression of those Houses, in which the Board
seemed to agree: When Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> who had been heard within
few Days before to inveigh with much Fierceness against the Permission of
<MILESTONE N="50"/>so much seditious Prattle in the Impunity of those Houses, stood up, and
said, “that Coffee was a Commodity that yielded the King a good Re∣venue,
and therefore it would not be just to receive the Duties and inhibit
the Sale of it, which many Men found to be very good for their Health,”
<PB N="358" REF="362"/>
as if it might not be bought and drank but in those licentious Meetings.
“That it had been permitted in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, and that the King's
Friends had used more Liberty of Speech in those Places than They durst
do in any other; and that He thought it would be better to leave them
as they were, without running the Hazard of Ill being continued not∣withstanding
his Command to the Contrary.” And upon these Reasons
his Majesty was converted, and declined any farther Debate; which put
the Chancellor very much out of Countenance, nor knew He how to be∣have
himself.</P>
<P>THE Truth is:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Interest declines: Whilst the Courtiers af∣fect to repre∣sent i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the highest.</NOTE> He had a very hard Province, and found his Credit every<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Day to decay with the King; whilst They who prevailed against him used
all the Skill and Cunning They had to make it believed, “that his Power
with his Majesty was as great as it had ever been, and that all those
Things which He most opposed were acted by his Advice.” And whilst
They procured all those for whom He had Kindness, or who professed any
Respect towards him, to be discountenanced and undervalued, and preferred
none but such who were known to have an Aversion for him upon Some∣what
that He had, or They had been told that He had, obstructed their
Pretences in; They persuaded Men, “that Nobody had any Credit with
the King to dispose of any Place but He.”<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THOSE very Men would often profess to him, “that They were so much
afflicted at the King's Course of Life, that They even despaired that He
would be able to master those Difficulties which would still press him;”
and would then tell him some Particulars which He himself had said or
done, or had been said or done lately in his own Presence, and of which
He had never heard before; which gave him Occasion often to blame them,
“that They, who had the Opportunity to see and know many Things which
He had no Notice of or could not take any, and foresaw the Consequence
that did attend them, did yet forbear to use the Credit They had with his
Majesty, in advertising him what They thought and heard all others say;”<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and He offered “to go with them to his Majesty, and make a lively Repre∣sentation
to him of the great Decay of his Reputation with the People upon
his exorbitant Excesses, which God could never bless:” To all which They
were not ashamed to confess, “that They never had nor durst speak to his
Majesty to that Purpose, or in such a Dialect.” Indeed They were the
honester Men in not doing it, for it had been gross Hypocrisy to have found
Fault with those Actions, upon the pursuing whereof They most depended;
and the Reformation which They would have been glad to have seen, had
no Relation to those inordinate and unlawful Appetites, which were the
Root from whence all the other Mischiefs had their Birth. They did<MILESTONE N="40"/>
not wish that the Lady's Authority and Power should be lessened, much less
extinguished; and that which would have been the most universal Blessing
to the whole Kingdom, would have been received by them as the greatest
Curse that could befall them.</P>
<P>ONE Day the Chancellor and the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> were together alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arlington <HI>la∣ments to the Chancellor the King's Course of Life: The King enters the Room.</HI></NOTE>
and the Secretary according to his Custom was speaking soberly of many
great Miscarriages by the License of the Court, and how much his Majesty
suffered thereby; when the King suddenly came into the Room to them,
and after He was fate asked them what They were talking of; to which
the Chancellor answered “that He would tell him honestly and truly, and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
was not sorry for the Opportunity.” And the other looking with a very
troubled Countenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To whom the Chancellor re∣peats the Dis∣course.</NOTE> He proceeded and said, “that They were speaking
of his Majesty, and, as They did frequently, were bewailing the un∣happy
<PB N="359" REF="363"/>
Life He lived, both with Respect to himself, who, by the Excess
of Pleasures which He indulged to himself, was indeed without the true
Delight and Relish of any; and in Respect to his Government, which He
totally neglected, and of which the Kingdom was so sensible, that it
could not be long before He felt the ill Effects of it. That the People
were well prepared and well inclined to obey; but if They found that
He either would not or could not command, their Temper would quickly
be changed, and He would find less Obedience in all Places, than was
necessary for his Affairs: And that it was too evident and visible, that He
<MILESTONE N="10"/>had already lost very much of the Affection and Reverence the Nation had
for him.”</P>
<P>HE said, “that this was the Subject They two were discoursing upon when
his Majesty entered; and that it is the Argument, upon which all those
of his Council with whom He had any Conversation did every Day en∣large,
when They were together, with Grief of Heart, and even with
Tears; and that He hoped that some of them did, with that Duty that
became them, represent to his Majesty their own Sense, and the Sense his
good Subjects had, of his Condition of living, both with Reference to God
who had wrought such Miracles for him, and expected some proportionable
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Return; and with Reference to his People, who were in the highest Discon∣tent.
He doubted all Men did not discharge their Duty this Way; and
some had confessed to him <HI>that They durst not do it lest They might of∣fend
him, which</HI> He had assured them often <HI>that They would not do,
having had so often Experience himself of his Goodness in that Respect;</HI>
and that He had the rather taken this Opportunity to make this Repre∣sentation
to him in the Presence of another, which He had never used to
do:” And concluded “with beseeching his Majesty to believe that which
He had often said to him, <HI>that no Prince could be more miserable, nor
could have more Reason to fear his own Ruin, than He who hath no Ser∣vants
<MILESTONE N="30"/>who dare contradict him in his Opinions, or advise him against his In∣clinations
how natural soever.</HI>”</P>
<P>THE King heard all this and more to the same Effect with his usual
Temper (for He was a patient Hearer), and spake sensibly, as if He thought
that much that had been said was with too much Reason;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arlington <HI>put: it off with Raillery.</HI></NOTE> when the other,
who wished not such an Effect from the Discourse, instead of seconding any
Thing that had been said, made Use of the Warmth the Chancellor was in,
and of some Expressions He had used, to fall into Raillery, which was his
best Faculty; with which He diverted the King from any farther serious Re∣flections;
and Both of them grew very merry with the other, and reproached
<MILESTONE N="40"/>his overmuch Severity, now He grew old and considered not the Infirmities
of younger Men: Which increased the Passion He was in, and provoked him
to say, “that it was observed abroad, that it was a Faculty very much im∣proved
of late in the Court, to laugh at those Arguments They could not
answer, and which would always be requited with the same Mirth amongst
those who were Enemies to it, and therefore it was Pity that it should be
so much embraced by those who pretended to be Friends;” and to use
some other, too plain, Expressions, which it may be were not warily enough
used, and which the good Lord forgot not to put the King in Mind of, and
to descant upon the Presumption, in a Season that was more ripe for such
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Reflections, which at the present He forbore to do, and for some Time after
remembered only in merry Occasions.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King did not yet, nor in a good Time after, appear to
dislike the Liberty the Chancellor presumed to take with him (who often told
<PB N="360" REF="364"/>
him, “that He knew He made himself grievous to him, and gave his Ene∣mies
too great Advantages against him; but that the Conscience of having
done his Duty, and having never failed to inform his Majesty of any
Thing that was fit for him to know and to believe, was the only Support
He had to bear the present Trouble of his Mind, and to prepare him for
those Distresses which He foresaw He was to undergo:” Which his Ma∣jesty
heard with great Goodness and Condescension, and vouchsafed still
to tell him, “that it was in Nobody's Power to divert his Kindness from
him”): Yet He found every Day that some Arguments grew less accept∣able
to him, and that the constant Conversation with Men of great Pro∣faneness,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
whose Wit consisted in abusing Scripture, and in repeating and
acting what the Preachers said in their Sermons, and turning it into Ridi∣cule
(a Faculty in which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> excelled), did much lessen
the natural Esteem and Reverence He had for the Clergy; and inclined him
to consider them as a Rank of Men that compounded a Religion for their
own Advantage, and to serve their own Turns. Nor was all He could say to
him of Weight enough to make Impression to the Contrary.</P>
<P>AND then He seemed to think,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King com∣plains to the Chancellor of the Liberties taken with his Character.</NOTE> “that Men were bolder in the examining
his Actions and censuring them, than They ought to be:” And once He
told him, “that He thought He was more severe against common Infir∣mities<MILESTONE N="20"/>
than He should be; and that his Wife was not courteous in re∣turning
Visits and Civilities to those who paid her Respect; and that He
expected that all his Friends should be very kind to those who They
knew were much loved by him, and that He thought so much Justice
was due to him.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, who had never dissembled with him, but on the Con∣trary
had always endeavoured to persuade him to believe, that Dissimulation
was the most dishonest and ungentlemanly Quality that could be affected,
answered him very roundly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor seriously remonstrates with him.</NOTE> “that He might seem not to understand his
Meaning, and so make no Reply to the Discourse He had made: But that<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He understood it all, and the Meaning of every Word of it; and there∣fore
that it would not become him to suffer his Majesty to depart with an
Opinion, that what He had said would produce any Alteration in his Be∣haviour
towards him, or Reformation of his Manners towards any other
Persons.”</P>
<P>“THAT for the first Part, the Liberty Men took to speak of him
and to censure his Actions, He was of the Opinion that it was a very great
Presumption, and a Crime very fit to be punished: For let it be true or
false, Men had been always severely chastised for that License, because it
tended to Sedition. However He put his Majesty in Mind of the Exam∣ple<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> who, when one of his Servants accused a Per∣son
of Condition to him of having spoken ill of him, and offered to go
himself to the Magistrate and make Proof of it, answered him; <HI>that the
Person He accused was a Man of the greatest Reputation of Wisdom and
Integrity in the Kingdom, and therefore it would be fit in the first Place to
examine, whether himself</HI> (the King) <HI>had not done Somewhat by which He
had deserved to be so spoken of:</HI> Indeed this Way the best Men would
often receive Benefit from their worst Enemies. For the Matter itself,”
He said, “He need make no Apology: For that it was notoriously known,
that He had constantly given it in Charge to all the Judges, to make di∣ligent<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Inquiry into Misdemeanours and Transgressions of that Magnitude,
and to punish those who were guilty in the most exemplary Manner;
and that He took not more Pains any Way, than to preserve in the
<PB N="361" REF="365"/>
Hearts of the People that Veneration for his Person that is due to his Dig∣nity,
and to persuade many who appeared afflicted with the Reports
They heard, <HI>that They heard more than was true; and that the suppressing
all Reports of that Kind was the Duty of every good Subject, and would
contribute more towards the reforming any Thing that in Truth is amiss,
than the propagating the Scandal by spreading it in Discourses could do.</HI>
However that all this which was his Duty, and but his Duty, did not
make it unfit for him, or any other under his Obligations, in fit Seasons
to make a lively Representation to his Majesty of what is done, and how
<MILESTONE N="10"/>secretly soever, that cannot be justified or excused; and of the Untruths
and Scandals which spring from thence to his irreparable Dishonour and
Prejudice.”</P>
<P>“FOR the other Part, of Want of Ceremony and Respect to those who
were loved and esteemed by his Majesty, He might likewise avoid en∣larging
upon that Subject, by putting his Majesty in Mind, that He had
the Honour to serve him in a Province that excused him from making Vi∣sits,
and exempted him from all Ceremonies of that Kind. But He would
not shelter himself under such a general Defence, when He perceived that
his Majesty had in the Reprehension a particular Intention: And there∣fore
<MILESTONE N="20"/>He confessed ingenuously to his Majesty, that He did deny himself
many Liberties, which in themselves might be innocent enough and
agreeable to his Person, because they would not be decent or agreeable
to the Office He held, which obliged him for his Majesty's Honour, and
to preserve him from the Reproach of having put a light Person into a
grave Place, to have the more Care of his own Carriage and Behaviour.
And that, as it would reflect upon his Majesty himself, if his Chancellor
was known or thought to be of difsolute and debauched Manners, which
would make him as uncapable as unworthy to do him Service; so it would
be a Blemish and Taint upon him to give any Countenance, or to pay
<MILESTONE N="30"/>more than ordinary, cursory and unavoidable Civilities, to Persons in∣famous
for any Vice, for which by the Laws of God and Man They
ought to be odious, and to be exposed to the Judgment of the Church
and State. And that He would not for his own Sake and for his own
Dignity, to how low a Condition soever He might be reduced, stoop to
such a Condescension as to have the least Commerce, or to make the Ap∣plication
of a Visit, to any such Person, for any Benefit or Advantage that
it might bring to him. He did beseech his Majesty not to believe, that
He hath a Prerogative to declare Vice Virtue; or to qualify any Person
who lives in a Sin and avows it, against which God himself hath pro∣nounced
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Damnation, for the Company and Conversation of innocent and
worthy Persons. And that whatever low Obedience, which was in Truth
gross Flattery, some People might pay to what They believed would be
grateful to his Majesty, They had in their Hearts a perfect Detestation of
the Persons They made Address to: And that for his Part He was long
resolved that his Wife should not be one of those Courtiers; and that He
would himself much less like her Company, if She put herself into theirs
who had not the same Innocence.”</P>
<P>THE King was not the more pleased for the Defence He made, and did
not dissemble his Dislike of it, without any other Sharpness, than by telling
<MILESTONE N="50"/>him “that He was in the Wrong, and had an Understanding different from
all other Men who had Experience in the World.” And it is most cer∣tain,
it was an avowed Doctrine, and with great Address daily insinuated
to the King, “that Princes had many Liberties which private Persons have
<PB N="362" REF="366"/>
not; and that a Lady of Honour who dedicates herself only to please a
King, and continues faithful to him, ought not to be branded with any
Name or Mark of Infamy, but hath been always looked upon by all Per∣sons
wellbred as worthy of Respect:” And to this Purpose the History of
all the Amours of his Grandfather were carefully presented to him, and with
what Indignation He suffered any Disrespect towards any of his Mistresses.</P>
<P>BUT of all these Artifices the Chancellor had no Apprehension, out of
the Confidence He had in the Integrity of the King's Nature; and that
though He might be swayed to sacrifice his present Affections to his Appe∣tite,
He could never be prevailed upon to entertain a real Suspicion of his<MILESTONE N="10"/>
very passionate Affection and Duty to his Person. That which gave him
most Trouble, and many Times made him wish himself in any private Con∣dition
separated from the Court, was that Unfixedness and Irresolution of
Judgment that was natural to all his Family of the Male Line, which often
exposed them all to the Importunities of bold, and to the Snares of crafty,
Men.</P>
<P>ONE Day the King and the Duke came to the Chancellor together; and
the King told him with a very visible Trouble in his Countenance, “that
They were come to confer and advise with him upon an Affair of Im∣portance,
which exceedingly disquieted them Both.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One</HI> Talbot, <HI>an</HI> Irishman, <HI>designs to as∣sassinate the Duke of</HI> Or∣mond.</NOTE> That <HI>Dick Talbot</HI>”<MILESTONE N="20"/>
(which was the familiar Appellation, according to the ill Custom of the
Court, that most Men gave him) “had a Resolution to assassinate the Duke
of <HI>Ormond.</HI> That He had sworn in the Presence of two or three Persons
of Honour, <HI>that He would do it in the Revenge of some Injuries which,</HI> He
pretended, <HI>He had done his Family: That He had much rather fight with
him, which He knew the Duke would be willing enough to do; but That He
should never be able to bring to pass; and therefore He would take his Re∣venge
in any Way that should offer itself.</HI> And every Body knew that the
Man had Courage and Wickedness enough to attempt any Thing like it.
That the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> knew well enough that the Fellow threatened<MILESTONE N="30"/>
it, and was like enough to act it; but that He thought it below him to
apprehend it: And that his Majesty came to the Notice of it by the Earl
of <HI>Clancarty,</HI> to whom Sir <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI> the elder Brother of the other,
told it, to the End that the Earl might give the Duke Notice of it, and
find some Way to prevent it; and the Earl had that Day informed the
King of it, as the best Way He could think of to prevent it.” His Ma∣jesty
said, “there remained no Doubt to be made of the Truth of it; for
there were two or three more of unquestionable Credit who had heard him
use the same Expressions: And that He had first spoken with his Bro∣ther,
whose Servant He was, whom He found equally incensed as him∣self;<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and that They came immediately together to consult with him what
was to be done.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew all the Brothers well, and was believed to have
too much Prejudice to them all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of this Man's Family: With the Characters of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brothers.</NOTE> They were all of an <HI>Irish</HI> Family but of
ancient <HI>English</HI> Extraction, which had always inhabited within that Cir∣cle
that was called the <HI>Pale;</HI> which, being originally an <HI>English</HI> Plantation,
was in so many hundred Years for the most Part degenerated into the Man∣ners
of the <HI>Irish,</HI> and rose and mingled with them in the late Rebellion:
And of this Family there were two distinct Families, who had competent
Estates, and lived in many Descents in the Rank of Gentlemen of Quality;<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and those Brothers were all the Sons, or the Grandsons, of one who was a Judge
in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Talbot, <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> and esteemed a learned Man. The eldest was Sir <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI>
who was by much the best; that is, the rest were much worse Men: A Man,
<PB N="363" REF="367"/>
whom the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> most esteemed of those who had been in Rebel∣lion,
as one who had less Malice than most of the rest, and had recom∣mended
to the King as a Person fit for his Favour. But because He did
not ask all on his Behalf, which He must have done for a Man entirely inno∣cent,
this Refusal was looked upon as the highest Disobligation.</P>
<P>THE second Brother was a <HI>Jesuit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter <HI>the se∣cond, a</HI> Je∣suit.</NOTE> who had been very troublesome to the
King abroad, and had behaved himself in so insolent a Manner, that his Ma∣jesty
had forbidden him his Court; after which He went into <HI>England,</HI> and
applied himself to the ruling Power there, and was by that sent into <HI>Spain,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/>at the Time when the Treaty was at <HI>Fuentarabia</HI> between the two Crowns,
to procure that <HI>England</HI> might be included in that Peace, and the King ex∣cluded,
and not to be suffered to remain in <HI>Flanders.</HI> Of all which his
Majesty having Advertisement, sent positive Orders to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> his
Resident then in <HI>Madrid</HI> to complain of him, and to desire <HI>Don Lewis de
Haro,</HI> that He might receive no Countenance in that Court. But the <HI>Je∣suit</HI>
had better and more powerful Recommendation; and was not only wel∣come
there, but (which was very strange, considering his Talent of Under∣standing)
in a short Time got so much Interest in the Resident, that He
received him into all Kind of Familiarity and Trust, and undertook to re∣concile
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the King to him, and was as good as his Word: And from the
Time of his Majesty's Return, or rather from the Return of Sir <HI>Harry Ben∣net,</HI>
He was as much and as busy in the Court as if He were a domestick
Servant. And after the Queen came to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> He was admitted one of
her Almoners; and walked with the same or more Freedom in the King's
House (and in Clergy Habit) than any of his Majesty's Chaplains did, who
did not presume to be seen in the Galleries and other reserved Rooms,
where He was conversant with the same Confidence as if He were of the
Bedchamber.</P>
<P>THE third Brother was <HI>Gilbert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gilbert <HI>the third, called Colonel</HI> Tal∣bot.</NOTE> who was called Colonel <HI>Talbot</HI> from
<MILESTONE N="30"/>some Command He had with the Rebels against the King. And He had
likewise been with the King in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that is, had lived in <HI>Antwerp</HI> and
<HI>Brussels</HI> whilst the King was there; and being a half-witted Fellow did not
meddle with any Thing nor angered any Body, but found a Way to get
good Cloaths and to play, and was looked upon as a Man of Courage,
having fought a Duel or two with stout Men.</P>
<P>THE fourth Brother was a <HI>Franciscan Friar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomas <HI>the fourth, a</HI> Fran∣ciscan Friar.</NOTE> of Wit enough, but of so
notorious Debauchery, that He was frequently under severe Discipline by the
Superiours of his Order for his scandalous Life, which made him hate his
Habit, and take all Opportunities to make Journies into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land:</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>But not being able to live there, He was forced to return and put
on his abhorred Habit, which He always called his <HI>Fool's Coat,</HI> and came
seldom into those Places where He was known, and so wandered into <HI>Ger∣many</HI>
and <HI>Flanders,</HI> and took all Opportunities to be in the Places where the
King was; and so He came to <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Brussels</HI> and <HI>Bruges,</HI> and being
a merry Fellow, was the more made of for laughing at and contemning his
Brother the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> who had not so good natural Parts, though by his Edu∣cation
He had more Sobriety, and lived without Scandal in his Manners.
He went by the Name of <HI>Tom Talbot,</HI> and after the King's Return was in
<HI>London</HI> in his <HI>Man's Cloaths</HI> (as He called them), with the natural Li∣cense
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of an <HI>Irish Friar</HI> (which are a People, for the most Part, of the whole
Creation the most sortish and the most brutal), and against his Obedience,
and all Orders of his Superiours, who interdicted him to say Mass.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="368"/>
THE fifth Brother was this <HI>Dick Talbot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard <HI>the fifth, the Per∣son concerned.</HI></NOTE> who gave the King and the
Duke the Trouble mentioned before. He was brought into <HI>Flanders</HI> first
by <HI>Daniel O Neile,</HI> as one who was willing to assassinate <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and
He made a Journey into <HI>England</HI> with that Resolution not long before
his Death, and after it returned into <HI>Flanders</HI> ready to do all that He
should be required. He was a very handsome young Man, wore good
Cloaths, and was without Doubt of a clear, ready Courage, which was Vir∣tue
enough to recommend a Man to the Duke's good Opinion; which,
with more Expedition than could be expected, He got to that Degree, that
He was made of his Bedchamber; and, from that Qualification, embarked<MILESTONE N="10"/>
himself after the King's Return in the Pretences of the <HI>Irish,</HI> with such an
unusual Confidence, and upon private Contracts with very scandalous Cir∣cumstances,
that the Chancellor had sometimes at the Council-Table been
obliged to give him severe Reprehensions, and often desired the Duke to
withdraw his Countenance from him. He had likewise declared very loudly
against the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> and, though He had made many Addresses unto him by
Letters and by some Friends who had Credit with him, would never from
the Time of the King's Return be persuaded to speak with him, and had
once prevailed with the King so far, that He was forbid to come to the
Court; but He had a Friend, who after some Time got that Restraint off<MILESTONE N="20"/>
again. The Chancellor had likewise observed the <HI>Friar</HI> to be too fre∣quently
in the Galleries, and sometimes drunk there, and caused him to
be forbid to come into the Court: And the eldest Brother, towards whom
He had rather Kindness than Prejudice, finding many Obstructions in his
Pretences, was persuaded to think him not his Friend. And so He got the
Reproach of being an Enemy to the whole Family.</P>
<P>THIS Consideration did really affect the Chancellor, so that He appeared
more reserved and more wary in this Particular proposed by the King and
by the Duke, than He used to be. He said, “that in many Respects He was
not so fit to advise in this Particular as other Men were. Though this<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Man's Behaviour was so scandalous that it deserved exemplary Punishment,
yet He did not conceive any present Danger from it: That He would deny
it and repent it, and give any other Satisfaction that would be required or
assigned; and then his Majesty and the Duke would be prevailed with to
take off their Displeasure. And therefore it would be better not to make
such a Matter publick, which, considering the Person and the Circum∣stances,
would make a deep Impression upon the Minds of all wise Men;
than, after the World takes Notice of it, to pass it over with a light and
ordinary Punishment.” The King interrupted him as He was going on,
and told him, “there was no Danger of that, and that He would deal<MILESTONE N="40"/>
freely with him. That as the Offence was in itself unpardonable, so He
and his Brother were resolved to take this Opportunity and Occasion to
free themselves from the Importunity of the whole Family: That all the
Brothers were naughty Fellows, and had no good Meaning.” And there∣upon
his Majesty enlarged with much Sharpness upon the <HI>Jesuit</HI> and <HI>Friar,</HI>
with Charges upon Both very weighty and unanswerable; and the Duke
upon this Man who was the Subject of the Debate: And Both concluded,
that They should be in great Ease by the Absence of all of them, which
should be enjoined as soon as a Resolution should be taken in this Par∣ticular.”<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew that there was Somewhat else, which was not so
fit to be mentioned, that had offended them Both as much; and thought He
had Reason to believe that They would be Both resolute in the Punishment,
<PB N="365" REF="369"/>
and that They had deliberated it too long to depart from the Prosecution.
He therefore advised, “that the Gentleman should be presently apprehended
and examined upon the Words, which some Witness should be ready to
affirm: And that thereupon He should be sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and the
next Day that his Majesty should inform the Privy Council of the Whole,
which without Question would give Direction to his Attorney General to
prosecute this soul Misdemeanour in such a Manner, that should put this
Gentleman in such a Condition, that He should not trouble the Court
with his Attendance; and other Men should by his Example find, that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>their Tongues are not their own, to be employed according to their own
malicious Pleasures.”</P>
<P>THE Person was the same Night sent to the <HI>Tower;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is sent to the</HI> Tower <HI>by the Chancel∣lor's Advice.</HI></NOTE> and both the King
and the Duke declared themselves, in the Presence of their Servants and
many others, to be as highly offended, and as positively resolved to take as
much Vengeance upon the impudent Presumption of the Offender as the
Rigour of the Law would inflict, as ever They had done upon any Occur∣rence
and Accident in their Lives: And if They had had Persons enough
about them, who out of a just Sense of their Honour would have con∣firmed
them in the Judgment They were of, it would have been in No∣body's
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Power to have shaken them. But as from the first Day of his Com∣mitment,
the Servants near the Person both of the King and Duke pre∣sumed,
against all ancient Order (which made it a Crime in any to per∣form
those Civilities to Persons declared to be under his Majesty's Displea∣sure),
to visit Mr. <HI>Talbot,</HI> and to censure those who had advised his Com∣mitment;
so after some few Days, when They thought the Duke's Passion
in some Degree abated, the Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> confidently told the Duke, “that
He suffered much in the Opinion of the World, in permitting a Servant
of so near Relation to be committed to Prison for a few hasty and unad∣vised
Words, to which He had been provoked; and that it was well
<MILESTONE N="30"/>enough known that it was by the Contrivement and Advice of the Chan∣cellor,
who was taken Notice of to be an Enemy to that whole Family,
nor any great Friend to any of his Highness's Servants; and if He had
that Credit to remove any of them from his Person, there would in a
short Time be few of them found in his Court.”</P>
<P>THIS was seconded by all the Standers by; and though it did not sud∣denly
work its Effect, yet the continual pressing it by Degrees weakened
the Resolution: And the same Offices being with equal Importunity per∣formed
towards the King, and with the more Zeal after it was published that
the Whole was done by the Chancellor's Procurement; both his Majesty
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and his Highness grew weary of their Severity, and, upon Conference to∣gether,
resolved to interpose with the Duke for his Remission, who disdained
to make himself a Prosecutor in such a Transgression.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But soon re∣leased by the Artifice of the Chancellor's Enemies.</NOTE> And so the Prisoner
returned to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> with the Advantage which Men who have been un∣justly
imprisoned usually receive: And all Men thought He triumphed over
the Chancellor, who, how unconcerned soever, knew every Day the less
how to behave himself. And this unhappy Constitution grew so notorious
(for there were too many Instances of it), that all Men grew less resolute in
Matters which concerned the King and drew the Displeasure of others upon
them, which was like to prove unprofitable to them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>ACCORDING to their last Prorogation the Parliament convened again upon
the one and twentieth of <HI>September;</HI> when the King told them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> “that He
was very glad to meet so many of them together again, and thanked God
for their Meeting together again in that Place.” He said, “little Time had
<PB N="366" REF="370"/>
passed since They were almost in Despair of having that Place left to
meet in. They saw the dismal Ruins the Fire had made; and Nothing
but a Miracle of God's Mercy could have preserved what was left from
the same Destruction.”</P>
<P>His Majesty told them, “He need make no Excuse to them for having
dispensed with their Attendance in <HI>April;</HI> He was confident They all
thanked him for it: The Truth is, He desired to put them to as little
Trouble as He could; and He could tell them truly, He desired to put
them to as little Cost as was possible. He wished with all his Heart that
He could bear the whole Charge of the War himself, and that his Sub∣jects<MILESTONE N="10"/>
should reap the whole Benefit of it to themselves. But He had two
great and powerful Enemies, who used all the Ways They could, fair
and soul, to make all the World to concur with them; and the War was
more chargeable by that Conjunction, than any Body thought it would
have been. He needed not tell them the Success of the Summer, in
which God had given them great Success; and no Question the Enemy
had undergone great Losses; and if it had pleased God to have withheld
his late Judgment by Fire, He had been in no ill Condition.” His Ma∣jesty
confessed, “that They had given him very large Supplies for the car∣rying
on the War: And yet,” He told them, “that if He had not, by<MILESTONE N="20"/>
anticipating his own Revenue, raised a very great Sum of Money, He had
not been able to have set out the Fleet the last Spring; and He had some
Hope upon the same Credit to be able to pay off the great Ships as they
should come in. They would consider what was to be done next, when
They were well informed of the Expense: And He would leave it to their
Wisdoms, to find out the best Expedients for the carrying on the War
with as little Burden to the People as was possible.” He said, “He would
add no more than to put them in Mind, that their Enemies were very
insolent; and if They were able the last Year to persuade their miserable
People whom They misled, <HI>that the Contagion had so wasted the Nation,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and impoverished the King, that He would not be able to set out any Fleet;</HI>
how would They be exalted with this last Impoverishment of the City,
and contemn all reasonable Conditions of Peace? And therefore He could
not doubt but that They would provide accordingly.”</P>
<P>INDEED the King did not till now understand the Damage He had sus∣tained
by the Plague, much less what He must sustain from the Fire.
Monies could neither be collected nor borrowed where the Plague had pre∣vailed,
which was over all the City and over a great Part of the Country;
the Collectors durst not go to require it or receive it. Yet the Fountains
remained yet clear, and the Waters would run again: But this late Confla∣gration<MILESTONE N="40"/>
had dried up or so stopped the very Fountains, that there was no
Prospect when they would flow again. The two great Branches of the
Revenue, the Customs and Excise, which was the great and almost inex∣haustible
Security to borrow Money upon, were now bankrupt, and would
neither bring in Money nor supply Credit: All the Measures by which Com∣putations
had been made were so broken, that they could not be brought to
meet again. By a Medium of the constant Receipts it had been depended
upon, that what had been borrowed upon that Fund would by this Time
have been fully satisfied with all the Interest, whereby the Money would have
been replaced in the Hands to which it was due, which would have been<MILESTONE N="50"/>
glad to have laid it out again; and the Security would have remained still in
Vigour to be applied to any other urgent Occasions: But now the Plague
had routed all those Receipts, especially in <HI>London,</HI> where the great Con∣duits
<PB N="367" REF="371"/>
of those Receipts still ran. The Plague and the War had so totally
broken and distracted those Receipts, that the Farmers of either had not
received enough to discharge the constant Burden of the Officers, and were
so far from paying any Part of the Principal that was secured upon it, that
it left the Interest unpaid to swell the Principal. And now this Deluge by
Fire had dissipated the Persons, and destroyed the Houses, which were liable
to the Reimbursement of all Arrears; and the very Stocks were consumed
which should carry on and revive the Trade. And the third next consi∣derable
Branch of the Revenue, the Chimney-Money, was determined; and
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the City must be rebuilt before any Body could be required to pay for his
Chimnies.</P>
<P>THIS was the true State of the Crown, if all other Inconveniences and
casual Expenses had been away, and all Application to Things serious had
been made by all Persons concerned. And this woful Prospect was in View
when the Parliament met again; which came not together with the better
Countenance by seeing all Hopes abroad with so sad an Aspect, and all
Things at Home (that troubled them much more) appear so desperate in
many Respects. Yet within few Days after the King had spoken to them,
the House of Commons beings most filled with the King's Servants, the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Gentlemen of the Country being not yet come, there was a faint Vote pro∣cured,
“that They would give a Supply to the King proportionable to his
Wants,” without mentioning any Sum, or which Way it should be raised:
Nor from that Minute did They make the least Reflection upon that Engage∣ment
in many Months after. Whilst the Enemies, much more exalted than
ever, believed, as They had good Cause, that They should reap a much
greater Benefit by the Burning of <HI>London</HI> than They had from the Contagion.</P>
<P>WHEN the Numbers of the Members increased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents in the House of Commons.</NOTE> the Parliament appeared
much more chagrined than it had hitherto done; and though They made
the same Professions of Affection and Duty to the King They had ever
<MILESTONE N="30"/>done, They did not conceal the very ill Opinion They had of the Court and
the continual Riotings there: And the very idle Discourses of some (who
were much countenanced) upon the miserable Event of the Fire made them
even believe, that the former Jealousies of the City, when They saw their
Houses burning at such a Distance from each other, were not without some
Foundation, nor without just Apprehension of a Conspiracy, and that it
had not been diligently enough examined;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed to inquire into the Causes of the Fire.</NOTE> and therefore They appointed a
Committee, with large Authority to send for and examine all Persons who
could give any Information concerning it.</P>
<P>WHEN any Mention was made of the Declaration They had so lately
<MILESTONE N="40"/>passed, for giving the King Supply, and “that it was high Time to dis∣patch
it, that all necessary Provisions might be made for the setting out
a Fleet against the Spring;” it was answered with Passion, “that the
King's Wants must be made first to appear before any Supply must be dis∣coursed
of: That there were already such vast Sums of Money given to the
King, that there was none left in the Country; nor could any Commo∣dities
there, upon which They should raise wherewith to pay their Taxes,
be sold for Want of Money, which was all brought to <HI>London in Specie,</HI>
and none left to carry on the Commerce and Trade in the Country,
where They could not sell their Corn or their Cattle or their Wool for
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Half the Value.”</P>
<P>THEY who had not fate in the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> were exceedingly
vexed, that there had been so much given there, so soon after the two Mil∣lions
and a Half had been granted; and said, “if the King wanted again
<PB N="368" REF="372"/>
already, that He must have been abominably cheated, which was sit to be
examined. That the Number of the Ships, which had been set out by the
King in several Fleets since the Beginning of this War, was no Secret; and
that there are Men enough who are acquainted with the Charge of setting
out and manning and victualling Ships, and can make thereby a reason∣able
Computation what this vast Expense can amount to: And that They
cannot but conclude, that if his Majesty hath been honestly dealt with,
there must remain still a very great Proportion of Money to carry on the
War, without Need of imposing more upon the People, till They are
better able to bear it. And therefore that it was absolutely necessary, that<MILESTONE N="10"/>
all those, through whose Hands the Money had passed, should first give
an exact Account of what They had received, and what and how They
had disbursed it: And when that should appear, it would be seasonable
to demand an Addition of Supply, which would be cheerfully granted.”</P>
<P>AND for the better Expedition of this (for every Body confessed that the
Time pressed) it was proposed, “that forthwith a Bill should be prepared,
which should pass into an Act of Parliament, in which such Commis∣sioners
should be appointed as the Houses should think fit, to examine
all Accounts of those who had received or issued out any Monies for this
War; and where They found any Persons faulty, and who had broken<MILESTONE N="20"/>
their Trust, They should be liable to such Punishment as the Parliament
should think fit:” And a Committee was presently named to prepare such
a Bill accordingly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill brought in for inspect∣ing publick Accounts.</NOTE> This Proposition found such a Concurrence in the House,
that none of the Court thought fit to oppose it; and others who knew the
Method to be new, and liable to just Exceptions, thought it to as little Pur∣pose
to endeavour to divert it: And so all Motions for present Supply were
to be laid aside till a more favourable Conjuncture; and the Overture had
been contrived and put on by many who seemed not to like it, which is
an Artifice not unusual in Courts or Parliaments.</P>
<P>THE Persons, who were principally aimed at (for no Doubt They be∣lieved<MILESTONE N="30"/>
that others would be comprehended), were Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> the
Treasurer of the Navy, through whom all that Expense had passed, who
had many Enemies upon the Opinion that his Office was too great, and
the more by the ill Offices Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was always ready to do
him; and the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> who was Treasurer of all the Money that had
been raised upon Prizes, which could not but be a great Proportion. The
former was a punctual Officer and a good Accomptant, and had already
passed his Account in the Exchequer for two Years, upon which He had
his <HI>Quietus est;</HI> which was the only lawful Way known and practised by
all Accomptants to the Crown, who can receive a good Discharge no<MILESTONE N="40"/>
other Way: And He was ready to make another Year's Account. But
what Method Commissioners extraordinary by Act of Parliament would put
it into, He could not imagine, nor be well satisfied with. The other, the
Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> had more Reason to be troubled, for He was by his Commis∣sion
exempted from giving any other Account but to the King himself,
which Exemption was the only Reason that made him so solicitous for the
Office; and He well knew that there were great Sums issued, which could
not be put into any publick Account: So that his Perplexity in several Res∣pects
was not small. And They Both applied themselves to the King for his
Protection in the Point.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>His Majesty was no less troubled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which the King can∣sults the pri∣vate Commit∣tee.</NOTE> knowing that Both had issued out many
Sums upon his Warrants, which He would not suffer to be produced; and
called that Committee of the Privy Council with which He used to ad∣vise,
<PB N="369" REF="373"/>
and complained of this unusual Way of Proceeding in the House of
Commons, which would terrify all Men from serving his Majesty in any
Receipts; to which Employment Men submitted because They knew what
They were to do, and what They were to suffer. If They made their Ac∣count
according to the known Rules of the Exchequer, their Discharge could
not be denied; and if They failed, They knew what Process would be
awarded against them. But to account by such Orders as the Parliament
should prescribe, and to be liable to such Punishment as the Parliament
would inflict, was such an Uncertainty as would deprive them of all Rest
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and Quiet of Mind; and was in itself so unjust, that his Majesty declared
“that He would never suffer it: That He hoped it would never find a Con∣sent
in the House of Commons; if it should, that the House of Peers would
reject it; but if it should be brought to him, He was resolved never to
give his Royal Assent.” There was no Man present, who did not seem
fully to concur with his Majesty that He should never consent to it: “How∣ever
that the best Care and Diligence should be used, that it might never
be presented to him, but stopped in the Houses; and to that Purpose that
the Members should be prepared by giving them Notice of his Pleasure.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor upon this Argument,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor delivers his Opinion very freely.</NOTE> in which He discerned no Oppo∣sition,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>enlarged himself upon what He had often before put his Majesty in
Mind of; “that He could not be too indulgent in the Defence of the Pri∣vileges
of Parliament; that He hoped He would never violate any of them:”
But He desired him “to be equally solicitous to prevent the Excesses in Par∣liament,
and not to suffer them to extend their Jurisdiction to Cases They
have Nothing to do with; and that to restrain them within their proper
Bounds and Limits is as necessary, as it is to preserve them from being in∣vaded.
That this was such a new Encroachment as had no Bottom; and
the Scars were yet too fresh and green of those Wounds which had been
inflicted upon the Kingdom from such Usurpation.” And therefore He
<MILESTONE N="30"/>desired his Majesty “to be firm in the Resolution He had taken, and not
to depart from it; and if such a Bill should be brought up to the House
of Peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is soon reported a∣broad to his Prejudice.</NOTE> He would not fail in doing his Duty, and speaking freely his
Opinion against such Innovations, how many soever it might offend.” All
which Discourse of his was in a short Time after communicated to those,
who would not fail to make Use of it to his Disadvantage.</P>
<P>THERE was a Correspondence by this Time begun and warmly pursued
between some discontented Members of the House of Peers, who thought
their Parts not enough valued (and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was in
the Head of them), and some Members of the House of Commons, who
<MILESTONE N="40"/>made themselves remarkable by opposing all Things which were pro∣posed
in that House for the King's Service, or which were like to be grate∣ful
to him, as Sir <HI>Richard Temple,</HI> Mr. <HI>Seymour,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garraway,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Robert Howard;</HI> who were all bold Speakers, and meant to make them∣selves
considerable by saying, upon all Occasions, what wiser Men would
not, whatever They thought.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> took more Pains than was agreeable to his
Constitution to get an Interest in all such Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>at the Head of the Opposition.</HI></NOTE> invited them to his Ta∣ble,
pretended to have a great Esteem of their Parts, asked Counsel of them,
lamented the King's neglecting his Business, and committing it to other Peo∣ple
<MILESTONE N="50"/>who were not fit for it; and then reported all the License and De∣bauchery
of the Court in the most lively Colours, being himself a frequent
Eye and Earwitness of it. He had a mortal Quarrel with the Lady, and
was at this Time so much in the King's Displeasure (as He was very fre∣quently),
<PB N="370" REF="374"/>
that He forbore going to the Court, and revenged himself upon
it by all the merry Tales He could tell of what was done there.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagined, considering the loose Life He led (which was a
Life more by Night than by Day) in all the Liberties that Nature could de∣sire
or Wit invent, how great an Interest He had in Both Houses of Parlia∣ment;
that is, how many in Both would follow his Advice, and concur in
what He proposed. His Quality and Condescensions, the Pleasantness of
his Humour and Conversation, the Extravagance and Sharpness of his Wit,
unrestrained by any Modesty or Religion, drew Persons of all Affections and
Inclinations to like his Company; and to believe that the Levities and the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Vanities would be wrought off by Age, and there would enough of Good
be left to become a great Man, and make him useful to his Country, for
which He pretended to have a wonderful Affection and Reverence; and
that all his Displeasure against the Court proceeded from their declared Ma∣lignity
against the Liberty of the Subject, and their Desire that the King
should govern by the Example of <HI>France.</HI> He had always held Intelli∣gence
with the principal Persons of the <HI>Levelling</HI> Party, and professed to de∣sire
that Liberty of Conscience might be granted to all; and exercised his
Wit with most License against the Church, the Law and the Court.</P>
<P>THE King had constant Intelligence of all his Behaviour, and the Li∣berty<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He took in his Discourses of him, for which He had Indignation
enough: But of this new Stratagem to make himself great in Parliament,
and to have a Faction there to disturb his Business, his Majesty had no Ap∣prehension,
believing it impossible for the Duke to keep his Mind long bent
upon any particular Design, or to keep and observe those Hours and Orders
of sleeping and eating, as Men who pretend to Business are obliged to;
and that it was more impossible, for him to make and preserve a Friendship
with any serious Persons, whom He could never restrain himself from abusing
and making ridiculous, as soon as He was out of their Company. Yet with
all these Infirmities and Vices He found a Respect and Concurrence from<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Men of different Tempers and Talents, and had an incredible Opinion with
the People.</P>
<P>THE great Object of his Dislike,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Hatred to the Duke of</HI> Ormond.</NOTE> Displeasure and Hatred was the Duke
of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who being his Equal in Title, and Superiour in Credit with the
King, and at least equal to him in all other Respects, He looked upon him
as his Rival; and that his constant Attendance upon the King through all
his Fortunes, was a Reproach to him for not having performed his Duty
that Way, and gave him a general Reputation in the Kingdom with all
Men who had been faithful to the Crown. The Duke of <HI>Ormond's</HI> younger
Son had married his Niece, who was the Heir apparent of his House; to<MILESTONE N="40"/>
which though He had given his Consent when He saw it was not in his
Power to contradict it, yet He pretended that the Duke had made many
Promises of Friendship to him which He had not made good; whereas in
Truth the other did really desire, and had heartily endeavoured, to do him
all the good Offices He could with the King, which some other new Ex∣travagance
of his own disappointed and made uneffectual. Let the Ground
and Reason be what they will, He did not dissemble to hate the Duke of <HI>Or∣mond</HI>
heartily, and to be willing to undertake the Prosecution of any Com∣plaint
against him; of which, in that distempered and disjointed Condition
of <HI>Ireland,</HI> there could not be Occasion wanting, as soon as it was known<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that such a Patron was ready to undertake their Defence. And it cannot be
denied (the Spirit of Envy is so powerful), that there were too many, who had
no Affection for the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who were yet willing that any
<PB N="371" REF="375"/>
Thing should be done to the Prejudice of the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who They
thought eclipsed the Nobility of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THERE had been for many Months a great Murmur, rather than Com∣plaint,
“of the great Damage the Kingdom in general sustained by the Im∣portation
of such great Quantities of <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle, which were bred there
for Nothing, and transported for little, that They might well undersell
all the Cattle here; and from hence the Breed of Cattle in the Kingdom
was totally given over, and thereby the Land would yield no Rent pro∣portionably
to what it had ever done: And that this was a principal
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Cause of the Want of Money in the Country, which could only be re∣medied
by a very strict Act of Parliament, to forbid the Importation of
any Sort of Cattle out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into this Kingdom.” And some of
them who had most thought of the Matter had prepared a Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Bill brought into the House of Commons against the Importation of</HI> Irish <HI>Cattle.</HI></NOTE> and brought
it into the House of Commons, where it was read. At first it underwent
very calm and reasonable Debates. Very many Members of several Coun∣ties
desired, “that their Counties might not undergo any Damage for the
Benefit of other individual Places.” They professed “that their Coun∣ties
had no Land bad enough to breed: But that their great Traffick
consisted in buying lean Cattle, and making them fat, and upon this
<MILESTONE N="20"/>They paid their Rent; and if the bringing over <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle should be
restrained, their Counties must be undone.” And this appeared to be the
Case of very many Counties in <HI>England.</HI> And the Complaint was of so
new a Nature, that it had never been heard of in <HI>England</HI> till some few
Months before this Meeting in Parliament; only it had been mentioned in
the Parliament at <HI>Oxford,</HI> as a Grievance to the Northern Counties, which
complained no less of the <HI>Scots</HI> than of the <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle; and the Bill that
was at this Time brought into the House of Commons provided as well
against the one as the other.</P>
<P>WHETHER this Complaint originally proceeded from the Damage which
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the People of some Counties sustained, or thought They sustained, which
made their Members in Parliament press the Restraint with much Earnest∣ness
(and it cannot be denied that many worthy Men were passionate in it,
who were not like to be engaged in particular and factious Contests, to comply
with the Humours of other Men), is not easy to other Men to judge of than
those who sate in the Houses, and observed the Manner and the Passion in
which those Debates were carried. And it cannot be denied but that, how
innocently soever the Grievance first came to be mentioned, and to be re∣commended
to the Consideration and Wisdom of the House, the carrying
it on was with unusual Heat and Passion, different from what appeared in
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the Transaction of any other Business, that had an Aspect only to the Pub∣lick:
And it was observed, that the Cabal that is mentioned before, be∣tween
some of the House of Peers and of the House of Commons, began
at this Time to meet more frequently, and were united in the driving on
this Affair; which suddenly grew to be insisted on as of that Importance,
that there could be no Debate begun with Reference to the giving Money
to the King, till this Bill were first passed.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the Council of <HI>Ireland</HI> had the Alarm of what was in∣tended
before the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Privy Council of</HI> Ireland <HI>re∣monstrate a∣gainst this Bill.</HI></NOTE> and did not only write to the King himself,
but a large Letter to the Lords of the Privy Council, in which They repre∣sented
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the present distracted Condition of that Kingdom, “that there were
more than one hundred thousand Persons who had Nothing else to live
upon but their Droves of Cattle; out of which They twice a Year sent
as many as They could spare into <HI>England,</HI> which enabled them to
<PB N="372" REF="376"/>
pay their Rents, and return such Goods and Merchandise from thence as
the Kingdom stood in Need of;” for no Money <HI>in Specie</HI> was returned
upon that Commerce. “That if this Liberty of Trade, which They had
enjoyed in all Ages, should be taken from them, the King's Army could
not be supported, nor the Government maintained, but the Kingdom must
necessarily be ruined; and probably a new Rebellion, in so general a Dis∣content
as this Restraint would administer, might be again entered into:
And therefore They desired, that at least some Years might be allowed to
that Traffick which had been always enjoyed; to the End that some other
Husbandry might be introduced into the Kingdom, by which the People<MILESTONE N="10"/>
might live, and which the Government would endeavour to plant with all
possible Diligence and Encouragement.”</P>
<P>THE King himself was so much moved with those Letters, that He declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King a∣gainst the Bill.</NOTE>
“that He could neither in Justice nor in Conscience consent to such a Bill,
which upon Pretence of Benefit to one of his Kingdoms might and must be
so mischievous to the other two” (for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as is said, was yet compre∣hended
as well as <HI>Ireland</HI>): “That He was equally King to all, and obliged
to have an equal Care of all; and never to consent to any Thing that might
be prejudicial to either of the other, especially if the Benefit to the one
were not proportionable to, and as evident as, the Damage was to the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
other.” And upon these Grounds He recommended to them, “to give
such a Stop to this Bill, that it might never be presented to him, for if
it were He must positively reject it:” And without Doubt his Majesty at
that Time did not resolve any Thing more within himself, than never to
give his Royal Assent to that Bill.</P>
<P>THE Letters from <HI>Ireland</HI> did not make the same Impressions upon the
Lords of the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Privy Council di∣vided in their Opinions upon it.</NOTE> who were very much divided in their Opinions, even
They whose Zeal for the King's Service was most unquestionable. Some
were, upon the sole Consideration of the Injustice of it, and the Mischief
that it would produce in <HI>Ireland,</HI> positively against ever consenting to it,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and as positive that it might be stopped in the House of Commons, or
thrown out of the Lords House, that it should never come to the King:
Others did as much believe that it was a real Grievance, in which the Sub∣ject
should have Relief; and insisted much, “that in a Point evidently for
the Benefit and Advantage of <HI>England, Ireland</HI> ought not to be put into
the Scale, because it would be some Inconvenience there.” Some did in
Truth think that the King was too much inclined to favour the <HI>Irish,</HI> and
in that Respect were well content that this Bill should be a Mortification to
them: And there wanted not others, who in dark Expressions (which grew
clearer when the Matter came into the House of Peers) seemed to think,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
“that the Estates in <HI>Ireland</HI> were more valuable than they were in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and that some Noblemen of that Kingdom lived in a higher Garb,
and made greater Expenses, than the Noblemen in <HI>England</HI> were able
to do; which had not been in former Times.” But They never con∣sidered,
that those Noblemen had Nothing but what descended to them
from their Ancestors; and that They had faithfully adhered to the King,
and undergone as much Damage for doing so, as any Men had done.</P>
<P>THE House of Commons seemed much more morose and obstinate than
it had formerly appeared to be, and solicitous to grasp as much Power and
Authority as any of their Predecessors had done, though no Doubt with no<MILESTONE N="50"/>
ill Intention: And it may be this would not have so much appeared, if
there had been the same Vigour in those who had used to conduct the King's
Business in that House, as there had used to be. But that Spirit was much
<PB N="373" REF="377"/>
fallen. The chief Men of the Court, upon whose Example other Men
looked, were much more humble than They had used to be, and took more
Pains to ingratiate themselves than to advance the Interest of their Master:
And instead of pressing what was desirable upon the Strength of Reason
and Policy, as They had used to do, and by which the major Part of
the House had usually concurred with them, They now applied them∣selves
with Address to those, who had always frowardly opposed whatsoever
They thought would be grateful to the King; and desired rather to buy
their Votes and Concurrence by Promises of Reward and Preferment (which
<MILESTONE N="10"/>is the most dishonourable and unthrifty Brokery that can be practised in a Par∣liament,
which from this Time was much practised, and brought many ill
Things to pass), than to prevail upon those weighty and important Argu∣ments
which would bear the Light. Which low Artifice raised the Insolence
of those, which would, as easily as it had been, have been still overruled
and suppressed; and was quickly discerned by those others, who upon the
Principles of Honour and Wisdom had hitherto swayed the House in all
Matters of publick Concernment, and who now concluded by those new
Condescensions, that the former sober Spirit and Resolution was laid aside,
and that peevish Men would be compounded with; and so resolved to fit
<MILESTONE N="20"/>still or look on, till the Success of this Stratagem might be discerned.</P>
<P>AND by this Means the Bill for <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle was driven on with more
Fury, and the other concerning Accounts more passionately spoken of;
whilst every Day not only many of those, who had constantly observed the
Advice that had been given them on the Behalf of the King, fell off to the
other Party, but many of his houshold Servants concurred in the Bill for
<HI>Ireland;</HI> whilst the rest, who did not yet think fit to do so, applied
themselves to the King for his Leave that They might do the same. And
Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> who had now by his Insinuations and Communication
made himself very grateful to the refractory Party, persuaded the King, “that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the House had taken the <HI>Irish</HI> Bill so much to Heart, that They would
never enter upon the Debate of Money, till that had passed the House
and was sent to the Lords, who no Doubt, upon the Knowledge of his
Majesty's Mind and Resolution, would easily throw it out. That if his Ser∣vants
continued obstinate in opposing it below, They should but provoke
and anger the House, and render themselves useless to other Parts of his
Majesty's more important Business: Whereas if They did now gratify
the House by concurring with them in this Matter, They should make
themselves acceptable, have Credit enough to divert the Bill of Ac∣counts,
and presently to dispose every Body to enter upon the Matter of
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Supply.”</P>
<P>THE King was not pleased with the Counsel, but had a very good Opi∣nion
of the Counsellor, who He believed could not but judge aright of the
Temper of those with whom He had fate and conversed so long: And so
his Majesty told him, “He was contented He should follow the Dictates
of his own Judgment and Conscience;” and the same Answer He gave
to all such Members of the House of Commons who came to receive his
Orders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill. af∣ter great Op∣position, passed by the Com∣mons.</NOTE> And after all this, the Bill was carried with great Difficulty, and
long Opposition given to it by those Members of several Counties, which
professed, “that the bringing over the <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle was so much for their Be∣nefit,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that They could not live well without it,” and were exceedingly
perplexed that it should pass; which yet They hoped would be prevented
in the House of Peers: And so the Bill was in great Triumph, and by all
<PB N="374" REF="378"/>
the Members (as in Cases They much delight in is usual), presented to the
House of Peers.</P>
<P>AND the Commons no sooner repaired to their own House, than They as∣sumed
the Debate upon the Accounts, with the same Fervour They had pur∣sued
the other Bill of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and with the same Declaration, “that They
would not enter upon the Subject of Money, till They saw what Suc∣cess
that Bill would likewise have;” and appearing every Day more out
of Humour, expressed less Reverence towards the Court. And some Ex∣pressions
were frequently used, which seemed to glance at the License and
Disorders and extravagant Expense of that Place, not without some Reflec∣tions<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which aimed at the Lady, and at the exorbitant Power exercised by
her. And this imperious Way of Proceeding confirmed those in their Wa∣riness,
who had no Mind to oppose or contradict the Party that They would
and meant should prevail: But They the more endeavoured to render them∣selves
gracious to the Leaders, as being willing to administer Fewel to the
Fire the others intended to kindle; and, so They might preserve themselves,
were very willing to expose other Ministers to the Jealousy of them, who
They thought would not be quiet without some Sacrifice. And thus They
alarmed the King with the new Apprehensions, “that the House, which
had yet dutiful Intentions, if They were crossed in what They designed<MILESTONE N="20"/>
for his Service, might be provoked to be bolder with his Majesty than They
had been yet, and to mention the Prevalence of the Lady,” which every
Body knew the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> would have been glad to have contri∣buted
to. And with these continued Representations, but especially with
their old Argument of casting it out by the House of Peers, where his Power
could not be doubted, They at last prevailed with the King to leave all
Men to themselves in the Business of the Accounts (where there was a greater
Concurrence),<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill for inspecting pub∣lick Accounts passed by the Commons.</NOTE> as He had done in the <HI>Irish</HI> Bill: And so that Bill likewise
was transmitted to the Lords.</P>
<P>AND at this Time many wise Men thought, that it would have been<MILESTONE N="30"/>
very happy for the King if He would have dissolved the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Propriety of dissolving the Parlia∣ment at this Time.</NOTE> and
presently after called another; which would have discovered many Combi∣nations,
when the Actors had found themselves excluded from entering
again upon the Stage; and it would have appeared, that all the Storms had
been raised by those Winds which had their Birth in the King's own House.
And such a Dissolution (to which the King himself was enough inclined)
would have been very popular throughout the Kingdom, which naturally
doth not love long Parliaments, and exceedingly detested this for having only
given away their Money, and raised a War of which They saw no End nor
possible Benefit, without passing any good Laws for the Advancement of the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Peace and Happiness of the Kingdom. And very few of those, who had
gotten Credit in the House to obstruct what the King desired, were Men of
any Interest or Reputation with the People.</P>
<P>BUT as Nobody was forward publickly to own and avow this Counsel,
the Consequence whereof They knew if it were not consented to; so They
who meant to do themselves more Good by the present Indisposition and Dis∣temper,
than They could propose from a new Convention of Men utterly
unknown, and who were like enough to bring Prejudice against their own
Particulars, used all the Means They could devise to divert the King from
that Inclination. They told him, “that He would never have such ano∣ther<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Parliament, where He had near one hundred Members of his own
menial Servants and their near Relations, who were all at his Disposal;
by which They had incurred so much Prejudice in the Country, that very
<PB N="375" REF="379"/>
few of them would ever be elected again. That the present Distemper
was contracted by Accidents and Mistakes, and would yanish upon very
reasonable Condescensions, and in another Prorogation: Whereas if it
should be dissolved and new Writs sent out, the People would return none
but <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and known Enemies to the Church, and such who were
most notoriously disaffected to the Court.” And this Argument, pressed
by Men who had no more Affection for the Church than the <HI>Quakers</HI> had,
prevailed with most of the Bishops to dissuade the King from hearkening to
any such Advice; when They had much more Reason to expect a stronger
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Party in a new Parliament, and might have observed that their Friends fell
from them every Day in Both Houses, and that the Court was not propi∣tious
to them, of which They had afterwards a sad Experience, and which
They might then have well foreseen.</P>
<P>THE House of Peers was no sooner possessed of the Bill against <HI>Irish</HI>
Cattle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great Animo∣sities in the House of Lords upon the Bill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Cattle.</HI></NOTE> but it was read, and a marvellous keen Resolution appeared in
many to use all Expedition in the passing it; though if the Matter itself had
been without Exception, there were so many Clauses and <HI>Provisos</HI> in it so
derogatory to the King's Honour and Prerogative, that many thought it a
high Disrespect to his Majesty to admit them into Debate. But of these
<MILESTONE N="20"/>anon. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> appeared in the Head of those who fa∣voured
the Bill, with a marvellous Concernment: And at the Times ap∣pointed
for the Debate of it, contrary to his Custom of coming into the
House, indeed of not rising till eleven of the Clock, and seldom staying
above a Quarter of an Hour, except upon some Affair which He concerned
himself in, He was now always present with the first in a Morning, and
stayed till the last at Night; for the Debate often held from the Morning
till four of the Clock in the Afternoon, and sometimes till Candles were
brought in.</P>
<P>AND it grew quickly evident, that there were other Reasons which caused
<MILESTONE N="30"/>so earnest a Prosecution of it, above the Encouragement of the Breed of
Cattle in <HI>England:</HI> Insomuch as the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> who next the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> appeared the most violent Supporter of the Bill, could not for∣bear
to urge it as an Argument for the prosecuting it, “that if this Bill did
not pass, all the Rents in <HI>Ireland</HI> would rise in a vast Proportion, and those
in <HI>England</HI> fall as much; so that in a Year or two the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>
would have a greater Revenue than the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI>” which
made a visible Impression in many, as a Thing not to be endured. Whereas
the Duke had indeed at least four Times the Proportion of Land in <HI>Ireland</HI>
that descended to him from his Ancestors, that the Earl had in <HI>England;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and the Revenue of it before the Rebellion was not inferiour to the other's.
But Nothing was more manifest, than that the Warmth of that Prosecution
in the House of Peers in many Lords did proceed from the Envy They had
of the Duke's Station in one Kingdom, and of his Fortune in the other.</P>
<P>AND the whole Debate upon the Bill was so disorderly and unparliamentary,
that the like had never been known: No Rules or Orders of the House for
the Course and Method of Debate were observed. And there being, amongst
those who advanced the Bill, fewer Speakers than there were of those who
were against it, those few took upon them to speak oftner than They ought to
do, and to reply to every Man who declared himself to be of another Opinion:
<MILESTONE N="50"/>And when They were put in Mind of the Rule of the House, “that no
Man should speak above once upon the same Question,” They called pre∣sently
to have the House resolved into a Committee, which any single Mem∣ber
may require, and then every Man may speak as often as He please;
<PB N="376" REF="380"/>
and so the Time was spent unprofitably without the Business being advanced.
In the mean Time the House of Commons proceeded as irregularly, in
sending frequent Messages to hasten the Dispatch of the Bill, when They
knew well the Debate of every Day: And it was frequently urged as an
Argument, “that the House of Commons was the fittest Judge of the
Necessities and Grievances of the People; and They having passed this
Bill, the Lords ought to conform to their Opinion.” In Fine, there
grew so great a License of Words in this Debate, and so many personal Re∣flections,
that every Day some Quarrels arose, to the great Scandal and Dis∣honour
of a Court that was the supreme Judicatory of the Kingdom.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who assumed a Liberty of speaking when and
what He would in a Dialect unusual and ungrave, his Similes and other
Expressions giving Occasion of much Mirth and Laughter, one Day said in
the Debate, “that whoever was against that Bill had either an <HI>Irish</HI> Interest
or an <HI>Irish</HI> Understanding:” Which so much offended the Lord <HI>Ossory,</HI>
who was eldest Son to the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> (who had very narrowly escaped
the Censure of the House lately, for reproaching the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> with
having been a Counsellor to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and would not therefore trust him∣self
with giving a present Answer),<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Os∣sory <HI>challenges the Duke of</HI> Buckingham.</NOTE> that meeting him afterwards in the Court,
He desired the Duke “that He would walk into the next Room with him;”<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and there told him, “that He had taken the Liberty to use many loose and
unworthy Expressions which reflected upon the whole <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, and
which He himself resented so much that He expected Satisfaction, and to
find him with his Sword in his Hand;” which the Duke endeavoured to
avoid by all the fair Words and Shifts He could use, but was so far pressed
by the other, whose Courage was never doubted, that He could not avoid
appointing a Place where They would presently meet, which He found the
other would exact to prevent Discovery, and therefore had chosen rather to
urge it himself than to send a Message to him. And so He named a known
Place in <HI>Chelsea Fields,</HI> and to be there within less than an Hour.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Ossory</HI> made Haste thither, and expected him much beyond
the Time; and then seeing some Persons come out of the Way towards
the Place where He was, and concluding They were sent out to prevent
any Action between them, He avoided speaking with them, but got to the
Place where his Horse was, and so retired to <HI>London.</HI> The Duke was
found by himself in another Place on the other Side of the Water, which
was never known by the Name of <HI>Chelsea Fields,</HI> which He said was the
Place He had appointed to meet.</P>
<P>FINDING that Night that the Lord <HI>Ossory</HI> was not in Custody, and so
He was sure He should quickly hear from him, and upon Conference with<MILESTONE N="40"/>
his Friends, that the Mistake of the Place would be imputed to him; He
took a strange Resolution, that every Body wondered at, and his Friends dis∣suaded
him from. And the next Morning, as soon as the House was sate,
the Lord <HI>Ossory</HI> being likewise present that He might find some Opportu∣nity
to speak with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>informs the House of the Affair.</HI></NOTE> the Duke told the House, “that He must inform
them of Somewhat that concerned himself; and being sure that it would
come to their Notice some other Way, He had therefore chose to acquaint
them with it himself:” And thereupon related “how the Lord <HI>Ossory</HI> had the
Day before found him in the Court, and desired him to walk into the next
Room, where He charged him with many Particulars which He had spoken<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in that Place, and in few Words told him He should fight with him;
which though He did not hold himself obliged to do in Maintenance of any
Thing He had said or done in the Parliament, yet that it being suitable
<PB N="377" REF="381"/>
and agreeable to his Nature, to fight with any Man who had a Mind to
fight with him” (upon which He enlarged with a little Vanity, as if
Duelling were his daily Exercise and Inclination), “He appointed the
Place in <HI>Chelsea Fields,</HI> which He understood to be the Fields over against
<HI>Chelsea;</HI> whither, having only gone to his Lodging to change his Sword,
He hastened, by presently crossing the Water in a Pair of Oars, and stayed
there in Expectation of the Lord <HI>Ossory,</HI> until such Gentlemen,” whom
He named, “found him there, and said, <HI>They were sent to prevent his and
the Lord</HI> Ossory's <HI>Meeting, whom others were likewise sent to find for
<MILESTONE N="10"/>the same Prevention.</HI> Whereupon, concluding that for the present there
would be no Meeting together, He returned with those Gentlemen to his
Lodging, being always ready to give any Gentleman Satisfaction that
should require it of him.”</P>
<P>EVERY Body was exceedingly surprised with the Oddness and Unseason∣ableness
of the Discourse, which consisted, with some Confusion, between
aggravating the Presumption of the Lord <HI>Ossory,</HI> and making the Offence
as heinous, as the violating all the Privileges of Parliament could amount
unto; and magnifying his own Courage and Readiness to fight upon any
Opportunity, when it was clear enough that He had declined it by a gross
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Shift: And it was wondered at, that He had not chosen rather that some
other Person might inform the House of a Quarrel between two Members,
that it might be examined and the Mischief prevented. But He believed
that Way would not so well represent and manifest the Lustre of his Cou∣rage,
and might leave him under an Examination that would not be so ad∣vantageous
to him as his own Information: And therefore no Persuasion
and Importunity of his Friends could prevail with him to decline that
Method.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Ossory</HI> seemed out of Countenance, and troubled that the Con∣test
was like to be only in that Place, and cared not to deny any Thing that
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the Duke had accused him of; only “wondered, that He should say He
had challenged him for Words spoken in the House, when He had ex∣pressly
declared to him, when his Grace insisted much upon the Privilege
of Parliament to decline giving him any Satisfaction, <HI>that He did not
question him for any Words spoken in Parliament, but for Words spoken in
other Places, and for Affronts, which He had at other Times chosen to bear
rather than to disturb the Company.</HI>” He confessed, “He had attended
in the very Place where the Duke had done him the Honour to promise to
meet him;” and mentioned some Expressions which He had used in de∣signing
it, which left the Certainty of it not to be doubted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>WHEN They had Both said as much as They had a Mind to, They were
Both required, as is the Custom, to withdraw to several Rooms near the
House: And then the Lords entered upon Debate of the Transgression;
many insisting “upon the Magnitude of the Offence, which concerned the
Honour and Safety of the highest Tribunal in the Kingdom, and the Li∣berty
and Security of every Member of the House. That if in any De∣bate
any Lord exceeded the modest Limits prescribed, in any offensive
Expressions, the House had the Power and the Practice to restrain and
reprehend and imprison the Person, according to the Quality and Degree
of the Offence; and that no other Remedy or Examination could be ap∣plied
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to it, even by the King himself. But if it should be in any pri∣vate
Man to take Exceptions against any Words which the House finds no
Fault with, and to require Men to justify with their Swords all that They
say in Discharge of their Conscience, and for the Good and Benefit of
<PB N="377" REF="382"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="376" REF="383"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="378" REF="384"/>
their Country; there is an End of the Privilege of Parliament and the
Freedom of Speech: And therefore that there could not be too great a
Punishment inflicted upon this notorious and monstrous Offence of the
Lord <HI>Ossory,</HI> which concerned every Lord in particular, as much as it did
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> who had carried himself as well as the ill Cus∣tom
and Iniquity of the Age would admit, and had given no Offence to
the House, towards which He had always paid all possible Respect and
Reverence.”</P>
<P>THEY who considered the Honour and Dignity only of the House, and
the ill Consequence of such Violations as these, which Way soever their<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Affections were inclined with Reference to their Persons, were all of Opi∣nion,
“that their Offences were so near equal that their Punishment ought
to be equal: For that besides the Lord <HI>Ossory's</HI> Denial that He had made
any Reflection upon any Words spoken in Parliament, which was the Aggra∣vation
of his Offence, there was some Testimony given to the House by
some Lords present, that the Lord <HI>Ossory</HI> had complained of the Duke's Com∣portment<MILESTONE N="20"/>
towards him before those Words used in the House by him, <HI>of the</HI>
Irish <HI>Interest or</HI> Irish <HI>Understanding,</HI> and resolved to expostulate with him
upon it; so that those Words could not be the Ground of the Quarrel.
And it was evident by the Duke's own Confession and Declaration, that<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He was as ready to fight, and went to the Place appointed by himself for
Encounter; which made the Offence equal.” And therefore They moved,
that They might be Both brought to the Bar, and upon their Knees re∣ceive
the Sentence of the House for their Commitment to the <HI>Tower.</HI>”</P>
<P>SOME, who would shew their Kindness to the Duke, were not willing
that He should undergo the same Punishment with the other, until some
Lords, who were known not to be his Friends, were very earnest “that
the Duke might receive no Punishment, because He had committed no
Fault; for that it was very evident that He never intended to fight,
and had, when no other Tergiversation would serve his Turn, prudently<MILESTONE N="30"/>
mistaken the Place that was appointed by himself;” which was pressed
by two or three Lords in such a pleasant Manner, with Reflection upon some
Expressions used by himself, that his better Friends thought it would be
more for his Honour to undergo the Censure of the House, than the Pe∣nalty
of such a Vindication:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They are Both sent to the</HI> Tower.</NOTE> And so They were Both sent to the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>AND during the Time They remained there, the Bill against <HI>Ireland</HI> re∣mained
in Suspense, and uncalled for by those, who would not hazard their
Cause in the Absence of their strongest Champion. But the same Spirit was
kept up in all other Arguments, the Displeasure, that had arisen against each
other in that, venting itself in Contradictions and sharp Replies in all other<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Occasions; a Mischief that is always contracted from the Agitation of pri∣vate
Affairs, where different Interests are pursued; from whence personal
Animosities arise, which are not quickly laid aside, after the Affair itself
that produced those Passions is composed and ended. And this Kind of Dis∣temper
never more appeared, nor ever lasted longer, than from the Debate
and Contestation upon this Bill.</P>
<P>THOSE two Lords were no sooner at Liberty, and their Displeasure towards
each other suppressed or silenced by the King's Command, but another more
untoward Outrage happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Scuffle be∣tween the Duke of</HI> Bucking∣ham <HI>and the Marquis of</HI> Dorchester.</NOTE> that continued the same Disturbance. It hap∣pened
that upon the Debate of the same Affair, the <HI>Irish</HI> Bill, there was a<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Conference appointed with the House of Commons, in which the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> was a Manager; and as They were sitting down in the <HI>Painted
Chamber,</HI> which is seldom done in good Order, it chanced that the Mar∣quis
<PB N="379" REF="385"/>
of <HI>Dorchester</HI> sate next the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> between whom there
was no good Correspondence. The one changing his Posture for his own
Ease, which made the Station of the other the more uneasy, They first en∣deavoured
by justling to recover what They had dispossessed each other of,
and afterwards fell to direct Blows; in which the Marquis, who was the
lower of the two in Stature, and was less active in his Limbs, lost his Peri∣wig,
and received some Rudeness, which Nobody imputed to his Want of
Courage, which was ever less questioned than that of the other.</P>
<P>THE Misdemeanor, greater than had ever happened, in that Place and
<MILESTONE N="10"/>upon such an Occasion, in any Age when the least Reverence to Govern∣ment
was preserved, could not be concealed; but as soon as the Conference
was ended, was reported to the House, and Both Parties heard, who Both
confessed enough to make them undergo the Censure of the House. The
Duke's Friends would fain have justified him, as being provoked by the
other; and it was evident their mutual undervaluing each other always dis∣posed
them to affect any Opportunity to manifest it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>For which They are com∣mitted to the</HI> Tower.</NOTE> But the House sent
them Both to the <HI>Tower;</HI> from whence after a few Days They were again
released together, and such a Reconciliation made as after such Rencounters
is usual, where either Party thinks himself beforehand with the other, as the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Marquis had much of the Duke's Hair in his Hands to recompense for his
pulling off of his Perriwig, which He could not reach high enough to do
to the other.</P>
<P>WHEN all Things were thus far quieted, the Bill was again entered upon
with no less Passion for the Stock that had been wasted.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arguments urged against the</HI> Irish <HI>Bill in the House of Peers.</HI></NOTE> The Arguments
which were urged against the Bill for the Injustice of it were, “that They
should, without any Cause or Demerit on their Part, or any visible Evi∣dence
of a Benefit that would accrue from it to this Kingdom, deprive his
Majesty's two other Kingdoms of a Privilege they had ever been possessed
of. That They might as reasonably take away the Trade from any one
<MILESTONE N="30"/>County in <HI>England,</HI> because it produced some Inconvenience to another
County more in their Favour. That the large Counties of <HI>Norfolk, Suf∣folk,
Kent,</HI> and other Provinces, would lose as much by the passing of
this Act, as the Northern and any other Counties would gain by it. That
those two Kingdoms might with the same Justice press his Majesty's Con∣currence,
that They might have no Trade with <HI>England,</HI> which would
bring more Damage to <HI>England</HI> by much, than it would gain by this
Act of Restraint: And that it was against all the Maxims of Prudence, to
run the Danger of a present Mischief and Damage, as this would produce
in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Testimony of the Lord Lieutenant and Council of that
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Kingdom, only upon the Speculation of a future Benefit that might accrue,
though it were yet only in Speculation.”</P>
<P>THESE, and many other Arguments of this Kind, which for the most
Part were offered by Men who had not the least Relation to <HI>Ireland,</HI> made
no other Impression, than that They were content to leave <HI>Scotland</HI> out of
the Bill; which increased their Party against <HI>Ireland,</HI> and gave little Satis∣faction
to the other, who did not so much value the Commerce with the
other Kingdom. And this Alteration the House of Commons likewise con∣sented
to, but with great Opposition, since in Truth that Concession de∣stroyed
the Foundation upon which the whole Fabrick of the Bill was
<MILESTONE N="50"/>supported.</P>
<P>THEN the Debate fell upon some derogatory Clauses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Clauses in it derogatory to the Preroga∣tive.</NOTE> and <HI>Provisos</HI> very
contrary to his Majesty's just Prerogative and Power (for They made his
Majesty's own License and Warrant of no Effect or Authority, but liable
<PB N="380" REF="386"/>
to be controlled by a Constable; nor would permit the Importation of three
thousand Beeves, which, by an Act of Parliament in <HI>Ireland,</HI> were every
Year to be delivered at <HI>Chester</HI> and another Port for the Provision of the
King's House); which in many Respects the House generally disliked, and
desired “that it might have no other Style than had been accustomed in all
the penal Acts of Parliament which were in Force, it being to be pre∣sumed,
that the King would never dispense with any Violation of it, ex∣cept
in such Cases as the Benefit and Good of the Kingdom required it;
which might naturally fall out, if there should happen such a Murrain
amongst the Beasts of that Species, as had been these late Years amongst<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Horses, which had destroyed so many thousand, that good Horses were
now hard to be procured. And if the same or the like Destruction should
fall upon the other Cattle, We should have then more Cause to complain
of the Scarcity and the Dearness of Meat, than We have now of the Plenty
and Cheapness, which was the only Grievance now felt, and which King∣doms
seldom complained of: And in such a Case it would be very great
Pity, that the King should not have Power enough to provide for the
Supply of his Subjects, and to prevent a common Dearth.”</P>
<P>BUT this was again opposed with as much Passion and Violence as had
fallen out in any Part of the Debate; and such rude Arguments used against<MILESTONE N="20"/>
such a Power in the King, as if the Question were upon reposing some new
Trust in him, whereas it was upon divesting him of a Trust that was inhe∣rent
in him from all Antiquity: And “that it was the same Thing to be
without the Bill, and not to provide against the King's dispensing with
the not obeying it, whose Inclinations were well known in this Particu∣lar;
and therefore the Effect of them, and of the Importunity of the
Courtiers, must be provided against.” And throughout this Discourse
there was such a Liberty of Language made Use of, as reflected more upon
the King's Honour, and indeed upon his whole Council and Court, than had
been heard in that House, but in a Time of Rebellion, without very se∣vere<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Reprehension: And it so much offended the House now, that, not∣withstanding
all the sturdy Opposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Clauses are amended by the Lords.</NOTE> it was resolved that those Clauses and
<HI>Provisos</HI> should be amended in some Places, and totally left out in others.
And with the Alteration and Amendments it was sent down to the House
of Commons.</P>
<P>AT this Time the publick Affairs and Necessities were little looked after
or considered. The Fleet was come into the Ports, but there was no Mo∣ney
to pay off the Men: And what was equally mischievous, there was no
Way to make the Provisions for the next Spring, that the Fleet might be
ready for the Sea by the Time the Enemy would assuredly be out. If the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Victualler were not supplied, who had much Money due to him, the Sea∣son
would be past in which He was to buy the Cattle that He must kill;
and He complained how much He should suffer by this Bill of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
which already raised the Price of all Meats. And the Yards wanted all
those Tacklings and Rigging and Masts, without which another Fleet could
not be sent out, and which could no otherwise be provided than by ready
Money. The King had anticipated all his own Revenue, and was ready
to expose that for farther Security, but Nobody would trust. The new
<HI>Provisos</HI> in the Bill of Supply at <HI>Oxford</HI> gave no new Credit, but were
found as mischievous as any Body had apprehended they would be: And<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Bankers, who in all such Occasions were a sure Refuge, wanted now
Credit themselves; which that They might not recover, the Parliament
had treated them as ill since They came together, that is, with Reproaches
<PB N="381" REF="387"/>
and Threats, as They had done at <HI>Oxford.</HI> In which Kind of Persecution
Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> and some who followed him, led the Van, very much
to the King's Prejudice and against his Command; but They excused them∣selves,
upon the Credit it gave them in the House to do him Service.</P>
<P>ALL this was well enough understood: And it was as visible, that They
intended to make it a forcible Argument for the passing the <HI>Irish</HI> Bill,
which, though from different Motives, was now become the Sacrifice with∣out
which They would not be appeased; and therefore, when the Bill was
sent to them with those Alterations and Amendments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons adhere to their Bill.</NOTE> They rejected them
<MILESTONE N="10"/>all, and voted, “that They would adhere to their own Bill without de∣parting
from a Word of it, except with Reference to <HI>Scotland,</HI>” from
which They had receded. And if upon this very unusual Return the House
of Peers had likewise voted, “that They too would adhere,” which They
might regularly have done, and would have been consented to by the
major Part of the House if the Question had been then put; there had
been an End of that Bill. But that must not be suffered: The Party that
cherished it was too much concerned to let it expire in a deep Silence,
and were numerous enough to obstruct and defer what They liked not,
though not to establish what They desired. Some of them, that is, some
<MILESTONE N="20"/>who desired that the Bill should pass, though uncorrupted by their Passions,
did not like the Obstinacy of the House of Commons in not departing from
some unusual Clauses and Pretences; yet were not willing to have the like
Vote for adhering to pass in that House, which it might do when all other
Remedies should fail; and therefore moved, “that a Conference might be
required, in which such Reasons might be given as might satisfy them.”
Many Conferences, and free Conferences, were held, in which the Com∣mons
still maintained their Adherence with a wonderful Petulance: And
those Members, who were appointed to manage the Conferences, took the
Liberty to use all those Arguments, and the very Expressions, which had
<MILESTONE N="30"/>been used in the House of Peers, against leaving any Power in the King to
dispense; and added such other of their own as more reflected on his Ma∣jesty's
Honour; and yet concluded as if They could say more if They were
provoked, upon which every Man might make what Glosses He pleased, and
the King himself was left to his own Imaginations.</P>
<P>THERE need be no other Instance given of the unheard of and incre∣dible
Passion that was shewed in the Transaction of that Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Instance of the Passion of the Commons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Affair.</NOTE> than a Parti∣cular
that related to the City of <HI>London.</HI> Upon the News of the great Fire
in <HI>London,</HI> and the Devastation that it made there, there was so general a
Lamentation in <HI>Ireland</HI> as might be expected from a neighbour Province,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>that had so great a Commerce with and Dependance upon it. And the
Consent in this Lamentation was so digested, that the several Provinces had
made a Computation and Division between themselves, and presented a De∣claration
to the Lord Lieutenant and Council, “that They had so tender a
Sense of that Calamity, that if They were able to raise Money to admi∣nister
some Assistance to the City towards the Reparation of their great
Loss, They would willingly offer and present it: But that not being in
their Power or Possession, the great Scarcity and Want of Money through∣out
that Kingdom being notoriously known, but there being Somewhat in
their Power to offer, which might at least testify their Good-Will, and not
<MILESTONE N="50"/>be wholly useless towards the End They designed it; They had agreed be∣tween
themselves to give unto the Lord Mayor and City of <HI>London,</HI> to be
disposed of by them to such particular Uses as They should judge most
convenient, the Number of thirty thousand <HI>Irish</HI> Beasts, which should be
<PB N="382" REF="388"/>
delivered within such a Time and at such Ports,” which were named, “to
any such Persons as should be appointed to receive them.” And of this
They desired the Lord Lieutenant and Council to advertise the King, and
likewise give Notice to the City of <HI>London:</HI> Both which were done ac∣cordingly;
and the Advertisement arrived in the City in the Time when
this Bill was depending in the Lords House. Whereupon the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen presented a Petition to the Lords, with a <HI>Proviso</HI> that They
desired might be inserted in the Bill that was before them, by which it was
provided, “that Nothing contained in that Bill should hinder the City of
<HI>London</HI> from enjoying the charitable Donative of the thirty thousand<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Cattle, but that They might have Liberty to import the same.”</P>
<P>IT can hardly be believed with what Passion and Indignation this Petition
was received by the House, what Invectives were made against the City,
“for their Presumption in interposing their own particular Interest to ob∣struct
the publick Affairs of the Kingdom;” and then the Reflections
which were made upon the Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> “for giving Countenance
to such an Address, and becoming Instruments themselves to promote and
advance it:” Which They would not allow “to be an Offering of Cha∣rity,
but a Cheat and a Cozenage by Combination to elude an Act of Par∣liament,
which They could not choose but hear of, and could not but<MILESTONE N="20"/>
believe that it was passed by this Time. Which if it had been, and that
Power left in the King as had been proposed, They might now see how
it would have been applied: For They could not doubt, but there would
enough have advised the King, that He should gratify the City of <HI>London</HI>
with a License for this Importation; which could not or would not have
been so warily drawn, but that, under the License for thirty thousand,
there would be three hundred thousand imported into <HI>England;</HI> and this
the great Charity aimed at and was assured of.” And so, after much
Bitterness, They desired “that the Petition and the <HI>Proviso</HI> might be Both
rejected.”<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>BUT this Passion did not cover the whole House, which neither com∣mended
nor approved it, and were much less transported with it. They
believed it was a very seasonable Intention of Charity, and would not
take upon them to frustrate it; and so prevailed, that it was passed in that
House, and transmitted with Approbation to the other. But it had the
same Fate there with the other <HI>Provisos,</HI> and was thrown out with that Bit∣terness
and Observation which had been offered against it by some Lords.
Nor could any Expedients alter or remove their Obstinacy, though many
were offered upon Conferences, and particularly “that all the Beasts should
be killed in <HI>Ireland</HI> and powdered there, and then sent over in Barrels or<MILESTONE N="40"/>
other Casks;” but They found Cozenage in that too, and were as angry
with the Cattle when they were dead, as when they were alive, as if it
would for a Time keep down the Price of Meat in <HI>England,</HI> which They
desired to advance: So that there was Nothing gotten in all those Conferences,
but the Discovery of new Jealousies of the King and the Court, and new
Insinuations of the Discontents and Murmurs in the Country, that this Bill
was so long obstructed. Which being still represented to the King with the
most ghastly Aspects towards what Effects it might produce, his Majesty in
the End was prevailed upon, notwithstanding very earnest Advice to the
Contrary, not only to be willing to give his Royal Assent when it should be<MILESTONE N="50"/>
offered to him, but to take very great Pains to remove those Obstructions
which hindered it from being offered to him, and to solicit particularly very
many Lords to depart from their own Sense, and to conform to what He
<PB N="383" REF="389"/>
thought convenient to his Service; which gave those who loved him not
great Argument of Triumph, and to those who loved him very passionately
much Matter of Mortification. Yet after all this, and when his Majesty
had changed some Mens Resolutions, and prevailed with others to withdraw
and to be absent when the Bill should come again to be discussed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill at length consent∣ed to by the House of Lords.</NOTE> it was
carried with great Difficulty and with great Opposition, and against the Pro∣testation
of many of the Lords.</P>
<P>IN all the Debate upon this Bill, and upon the other of Accounts, the
Chancellor had the Misfortune to lose much Credit in the House of Com∣mons,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>not only by a very strong and cordial Opposition to what They de∣sired,
but by taking all Occasions, which were offered by the frequent Ar∣guments
which were urged “of the Opinion and the Authority of the House
of Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor offends the Commons by desiring the Peers to re∣strain their Encroach∣ments.</NOTE> and that it was fit and necessary to concur with them,”
to mention them with less Reverence than They expected. It is very
true: He had always used in such Provocations to desire the Lords, “to
be more solicitous in preserving their own unquestionable Rights and
most important Privileges, and less tender in restraining the Excess and
new Encroachments of the House of Commons, which extended their
Jurisdiction beyond their Limits.” He put them often in Mind “of the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Mischiefs which had their Original from the Liberties the House of Com∣mons
assumed, and the Compliance the House of Peers had descended to,
in the late ill Times, and which produced the Rebellion; and were
carried so far, till, after all the multiplied Affronts, They had wrested
the whole Authority out of the Hands of the House of Peers, and at
last declared them useless Members of the Commonwealth, and shut
up the Door of their House with a Padlock, which They had never
Power to unfasten till the King's Return.” And in those Occasions his
Expressions were many Times so lively, that they offended many of the
Lords who were present, and had too much contributed to those Extrava∣gancies,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>as much as it could do any of the Commons.</P>
<P>THE Truth is; He did never dissemble from the Time of his Return
with the King, whom He had likewise prepared and disposed to the same
Sentiments whilst his Majesty was abroad, that his Opinion was, “that the
late Rebellion could never be extirpated and pulled up by the Roots, till
the King's regal and inherent Power and Prerogative should be fully
avowed and vindicated; and till the Usurpations in Both Houses of Parlia∣ment
since the Year 1640 were disclaimed and made odious; and many
other Excesses, which had been affected by Both before that Time under
the Name of Privileges, should be restrained or explained:” For all which
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Reformation the Kingdom in general was very well disposed, when it
pleased God to restore the King to it. Nor did the Convention, which pro∣claimed
the King and invited him to return, exercise after his Return any
exorbitant Power, but what was of Necessity upon former Irregularities, and
contributed to the present Ends and Desires of the King.</P>
<P>AND this Parliament, that was upon the Dissolution of the former quickly
summoned by the King's Writ, willingly inclined to that Method, as ap∣pears
by those many excellent Acts which vindicated the King's Sovereign
Power over Parliaments, and declared the Nullity of all Acts done by one
or Both Houses without the King's Assent; declared and settled the absolute
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Power of the Crown over the Militia; repealed that Act of Parliament that
had excluded the Bishops from being Members of the House of Peers, and
restored them to their Session there; and repealed that other infamous Act
for Triennial Parliaments, which had Clauses in it to have led the People
<PB N="384" REF="390"/>
into Rebellion; and would willingly have prosecuted the same Method, if
They had had the same Advice and Encouragement.</P>
<P>BUT They had continued to sit too long together, and were invited
to meddle and interpose in Matters out of their own Sphere, to give their
Advice with Reference to Peace and War, to hold Conferences with the
King, and to offer their Advices to him, and to receive Orders from himself;
and his Majesty was persuaded by very unskilful Men, “that They were
so absolutely at his Disposal, that He need never doubt their undertaking
any Thing that would be ingrateful to him, and that whilst He preserved
that entire Interest He had in the lower House (which He might easily do)<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He need not care what the other House did or had a Mind to do;” and
so induced his Majesty to undervalue his House of Peers as of little Power to
do him Good or Harm, and prevailed with him too far to countenance
that false Doctrine; towards which the House of Peers themselves contri∣buted
too much, by not inquiring into or considering the publick State of
the Kingdom, or providing Remedies for growing Evils, or indeed meddling
with any Thing in the Government till They were invited to it by some
Message or Overture from the House of Commons: Insomuch as They sate
not early in the Morning, according to the former Custom of Parliaments,
but came not together till ten of the Clock; and very often adjourned as<MILESTONE N="20"/>
soon as They met, because that Nothing was brought from the House of
Commons that administered Cause of Consultation; and upon that Ground
often adjourned for one or two Days together, whilst the other House sate,
and drew the Eyes of the Kingdom upon them, as the only vigilant People
for their Good.</P>
<P>THEN when any Thing fell in their Way, that They could draw a Con∣sequence
from that might relate to their Privileges, They were so jealous of
an Invasion, that They neither considered former Precedents, nor Rules of
Honour or Justice; and were not only solicitous for that Freedom which
belonged to themselves and their menial Servants, who ought not to be dis∣quieted<MILESTONE N="30"/>
by private Suits and Prosecutions in Law, whilst They are obliged
to attend upon the Service of their Country in Parliament, but gave their
Protections <HI>ad Libitum,</HI> which were commonly sold by their Servants to
bankrupt Citizens, and to such who were able but refused to pay their
just Debts. And when their Creditors knew that They could have no
Relation of Attendance to any Man, and thereupon caused them to be ar∣rested,
They produced some Protection granted to them by some Lord;
whereupon They were not only discharged, but their Creditors, and all
who bore any Part in the Prosecution, were punished with great Rigour,
and to their great Loss and Damage, and to the great Prejudice of the City,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and Interruption of the whole Course of the Justice of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>WHEN the House of Commons sent up a Bill for the Suppression or Re∣formation
of many Irregularities and Misdemeanors, which had grown up
in the late Times of Disorder and Confusion, as Conventicles and other
riotous Assemblies, wherein there was a Necessity of some Clauses of Power
to inseriour Officers, whereby They were qualified to discover those Trans∣gressions
which would otherwise be concealed; the Lords would be sure al∣ways
to insert some <HI>Proviso</HI> to save their Privileges, even in Acts which pro∣vided
for the Punishment of such Crimes as no Person of Quality could be
supposed to be guilty of, as stealing of Wood, and such vile Trespasses:<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Which took up much Time in Debate, and incensed the House of Com∣mons,
and produced many froward Debates, in which the King thought
the Peers in the Wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="391"/>
THIS Kind of Temper or Distemper upon very trivial and light Occasions,
in Seasons which required Gravity and Dispatch, provoked the House of Com∣mons
to take more upon them, to enter upon Contests sometimes unreason∣ably
with the Lords, and to assume to themselves an Authority in Matters in
which They ought not to interpose; and then were encouraged and in∣deed
induced by those who had near Relation to the King and were trusted
in his Service, to affect Novelties both in the Form and Substance of their
Proceedings, which those Persons concurred in, much out of Ignorance what
was to be done, and more out of Affectation to compass some crooked
<MILESTONE N="10"/>End of their own, to the Prejudice of another Person who was in their Dis∣favour.
And when these Sallies out of the old trodden Path were taken No∣tice
of, and his Majesty had been advised to prevent them in Time, He was
persuaded, either “that the Exceptions were in Matters of little Moment,
and made only by formal Men who liked Nothing that was out of the old
common Road; or that the Liberty would be applied to his Service, and in
many useful Occasions would mollify or subdue the inconvenient Morosity
of the Lords; or, when it should exceed, it would be still in his Majesty's
Power to restrain it, when He found it necessary.” And these Discourses
prevailed too much with his Majesty, till He now found the Humour was
<MILESTONE N="20"/>grown too sturdy for him to contend with; and the same Men, who had
persuaded him to contemn it, were now more importunate with him that
He would comply with it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor had always as earnestly opposed the over-captious in∣sisting
upon Privilege in the Lords House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He offends the Lords by ad∣vising them not to insist unreasonably upon Privi∣lege.</NOTE> either when in Truth there was
not a just Ground for it, or when They would extend it farther than it
would regularly reach; and oftentimes put them in Mind “of many exor∣bitant
Acts which stood still mentioned in their Journal-Books, of their
Proceedings in the late rebellious Times, which might be looked upon as
Precedents by Posterity, and in which the House of Commons had really
<MILESTONE N="30"/>invaded their greatest Privileges, and trampled upon their highest Juris∣diction;
which was worthy of their most strict Proceedings to vindicate
by Protestation, and by expunging the Memorial thereof out of all their
Books and Records, that there might be no Footsteps left to mislead the
succeeding Ages;” and often desired them “to preserve a Power in them∣selves
to put the House of Commons in Mind of their exceeding their
Limits, for which They often gave them Occasion, and particularly as
often as They sent to quicken them in any Debate, which was a very
modern Presumption, and derogatory from that Respect which a House of
Commons had always paid to the House of Lords. And this They could
<MILESTONE N="40"/>not reasonably or effectually do, till They declined all unjust or unne∣cessary
Pretences to Privileges which were not their Due, and especially
to a Power of calling private Cases of Right and Justice, which ought to
be determined by the Law and in Courts of Justice, to be heard and ad∣judged
before themselves in Parliament; of which there were too frequent
Occasions to oppose and contradict their Jurisdiction.”</P>
<P>THIS free Way of Discourse offended many of the Lords, who thought
him not jealous enough of nor zealous for the Privilege of the Peerage: And
They were now very glad that He used so much more Freedom against the
Proceedings of the House of Commons, which They were sure would be re∣sented
<MILESTONE N="50"/>below, more than it had been above. And many of his Friends in∣formed
him “how ill it was taken; and how carefully all that He said, and
much that He did not say, was transmitted by some of the Lords to them,
who would not sail in some Season to remember and apply it to his highest
<PB N="386" REF="392"/>
Disadvantage;” and therefore desired him “to use less Fervour in those
Argumentations.” But He was in that, as in many Things of that Kind
that related to the offending other Men, for his own Sake uncounsellable:
Not that He did not know that it exposed him to the Censure of some Men
who lay in Wait to do him Hurt, but because He neglected those Censures,
nor valued the Persons who promoted them; being confident that He would
be liable to no Charge that He should be ashamed of, and well knowing
that He had, and being well known to have, a higher Esteem of Parliament,
and a greater Desire to preserve the just Privileges of Both Houses, than They
had who seemed to be angry with him on that Behalf; and that the extend∣ing<MILESTONE N="10"/>
them beyond their due Length would in the End endanger the Destruc∣tion
of Parliaments.</P>
<P>BUT He shortly after found, that this Guard was not secure enough to
defend him. What He said in Parliament was the Sense of more who would
not speak it, than there were of those who disliked it; and how much so∣ever
it offended them, They could not out of it find a Crime to accuse him
of. But They who were more concerned to remove him from a Post,
where He too narrowly watched and too often obstructed the Liberties They
took, resolved to sacrifice all their Oaths and Obligations, which obliged
them to the Contrary, to the Satisfaction of their Envy and their Malice:<MILESTONE N="20"/>
And so whatsoever He said or advised in the most secret Council to the King
himself with Reference to Things or Persons, They communicated all to
those who had most Reason to be angry, yet could not own the Informa∣tion.
Of all which He had Advertisement, and that a Storm would be
shortly raised to shake him, of which He had little Apprehension; never
suspecting that it would arise out of that Quarter, from whence He soon
after discerned it to proceed.</P>
<P>THERE was another particular and private Accident that fell out at this
Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Roos <HI>moves for a Bill to set aside the Issue of his Lady.</HI></NOTE> that administered more Occasion of Faction and Dissention in the
Houses, which always obstructed and perplexed all publick Business. The<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Marquis of <HI>Dorchester</HI> had some Years before married one of his Daughters
to the Lord <HI>Roos,</HI> eldest Son to the Earl of <HI>Rutland;</HI> Both Families very
noble in themselves, and of great Fortunes, and allied to all the great Fa∣milies
of the Kingdom. The Lady being of a Humour not very agreeable,
and not finding the Satisfaction She expected where She ought to have re∣ceived
it, looked for it abroad where She ought not to find it. And her
Husband, as Men conscious to themselves of any notable Defect use to be,
was indulgent enough, not strictly inquiring how She behaved herself, and
She as little dissembling or concealing the Contempt She had of her Husband;
until his Friends, especially the Mother (who was a Lady of a very great Spirit<MILESTONE N="40"/>
and most exalted Passion), took Notice of her frequent Absence from her Hus∣band,
and of her little Kindness towards him when She was present with him.
And the young Lady, who with her other Defects had Want of Wit to bear
a Reprehension She deserved, instead of excusing, avowed her no Esteem of
her Husband; charged him with Debauchery, and being always in Drink,
which was too true; and reproached him with Folly, as a Man not worthy
to be beloved. And the Passion swelling to a great Height on Both Sides, the
Marquis came to be engaged on the Behalf of his Daughter, and challenged
her Husband to fight with him, who in many Respects was not capable, nor
did understand those Encounters.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>IN the End, after many Acts of Passion, which administered too much
Cause of Mirth and Scandal to the World, yet by the Advice and Mediation
of Friends, as good a Reconciliation as in such Cases is usual was made, and
<PB N="387" REF="393"/>
the young Couple brought to live again together. And the Lady having the
Ascendant over the Lord, who was very desirous to live quietly upon any
Conditions, that He might enjoy himself though He could not enjoy her, He
was contented that She made a Journey to <HI>London</HI> upon Pretence to see some
Friends: And the Time being expired which She had prescribed for her Ab∣sence,
He sent to her to return, which She deferred from Time to Time. But
at last after many Months She returned to him in so gross a Manner, that it ap∣peared
that She had kept Company too much, which She never endeavoured
to conceal; and when her Husband told her “that She was with Child,”
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and asked “who got it;” She answered him confidently, “that whoever
got it, if it proved a Boy, as She believed it would, He should be Earl of
<HI>Rutland.</HI>”</P>
<P>THIS was more than the young Man could bear without informing his
Mother (the good Earl not loving to engage himself in so much Noise), who
presently took Care that the greatbellied Lady was made a Prisoner in her
Chamber, strictly guarded, that She could not go out of those Lodgings
which were assigned her; all her own Servants removed from her, and
others appointed to attend; and all other Things supplied that She could
stand in Need of or require, Liberty only excepted. Yet in this close Re∣straint
<MILESTONE N="20"/>She found Means to advertise her Father of the Condition She was in,
and made it much worse than it was, seeming to apprehend the Safety of
her Life threatened by the Malice of the Countess, Mother to her Husband,
“who,” She said, “did all She could to alienate his Affection from her;
and now that She found She was with Child, would persuade him that it
was not his; and took all this extreme Course, either to make her miscarry
and so endanger her Life, or to put an End to Mother and Child when
She should miscarry:” And therefore besought her Father, “that He would
find some Way to procure her Liberty, and to remove her from that Place,
as the only Means to save her Life.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE Marquis, with the Passion of a Father, and Confidence of his Daugh∣ter's
Virtue, and having no Reverence for the Countess, thought it an Act
of great Barbarity, and consulted whether He could have any Remedy at
Law to recover his Daughter's Liberty; and finding little Hope from thence
(the Restraint of a Wife by the Jealousy of her Husband in his own House
being not a Crime the Law had provided a Remedy against) He resorted
then to the King, who as little knew how to meddle in it. In the mean
Time He sent Women to see and attend his Daughter, who were admitted
to see and confer with her, but not to stay with her; the Countess declaring,
“that She should want Nothing; but that since it was impossible that the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Child could be of Kin to her Son, who had not seen her in so many
Months before the Child must have been got, She would provide that there
should be no more foul Play, when She should be delivered; and after that
Time She should have no more Restraint or Residence in that House, but
be at Liberty to go whither She would.”</P>
<P>THE Conclusion was: The Lady was delivered, and a Son born, who
was quickly christened by the Name of <HI>Ignoto,</HI> and committed to a poor
Woman, who lived near, to be nursed; and as soon as the Lady recovered
Strength enough, She was dismissed and sent to a House of her Father, who
received her with the Affection He thought was due to her. And having
<MILESTONE N="50"/>conferred and examined her with all the Strictness He could, He remained
satisfied in her Innocence, and consequently of the barbarous Treatment She
had received, and the Injury and Indignity, both to him and her, that was
done to the Son; for which He was resolved to leave no Way untried in
<PB N="388" REF="394"/>
which He might receive a Vindication. In Order to which He first desired the
King to hear all Parties, who was prevailed with to appoint a Day for the doing
it, being attended by some Bishops and other Lords of his Council; when
the Marquis and his Daughter, and the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> and his Mother, appeared,
with more Ladies than could have the Patience to stay till the End of the
Examination, where there were so many indecent and uncleanly Particulars
mentioned, that made all the Auditors very weary. Nor was there any
Room for his Majesty to interpose towards a Reconciliation, which was in
View impossible; nor could the Lady be excused for a great Delight She
took in making her Husband jealous of her, and in expressing a Contempt<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of him, whatever else She was guilty of: And so the King left it as He
found it. And the Marquis, who had heard many Things He did not
expect to have heard, took his Daughter to his own House, that by her
own strict Behaviour She might best vindicate herself from the Scandal She
lay under: But She quickly freed him from that Hope and Expectation;
for within a short Time after, She, not being able to submit to the strict
Order and Discipline of her Father's House, which would not permit those
Wanderings She desired to make, nor the Visits She desired to receive, made
an Escape from thence, and lodged herself at more Liberty, and lived in
that Manner as gave too much Evidence against her with Reference to the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Time that was past.</P>
<P>THE Marquis, who was a Man of great Honour, and most punctual in
all Things relating to Justice, gave a noble Instance of Both, and how much
He detested the base and unworthy Behaviour of his own Child, when it was
manifest to him. He went to the other noble Family, asked their Pardon
“for his Incredulity, and for any Offence He had committed against them,
or Reproach He laid upon them, for the Vindication of an unworthy Wo∣man,
who He believed now had deserved all and more Aspersions than
had been laid on her: And therefore He was ready to join with them to
free the Family, as much as was possible, from the Infamy She had<MILESTONE N="30"/>
brought to them and him, and that her base Issue might not be an eter∣nal
Reproach in their Family.” Upon this She was first, upon the Com∣plaint
of her Husband, cited into the Court of the Arches before the Ec∣clesiastical
Judges: Where, after a full Examination of Witnesses on Both
Sides, and hearing what She could allege in her own Defence, her Crime was
declared to be proved sufficiently; and thereupon a Judgment was pronounced
“of a full and entire Separation <HI>a Toro et a Mensâ pro Causâ Adulterii,”</HI> in
such a Form, and with such Circumstances, as are of Course in those Cases.</P>
<P>BUT all this was not Remedy enough against the Bastard's Title to the
Honour of that illustrious Family: And therefore there was a Bill prepared,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
wherein all the foul Carriage of the Lady was set out, the Birth and Chris∣tening
of <HI>Ignoto,</HI> the Declaration and Judgment of the Court of the Arches,
and Separation of the Parties for the Adultery proved; and thereupon a
Desire that it might be declared by Act of Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill brought in for this Purpose.</NOTE> “that the Son, <HI>Ig∣noto</HI>
by Name, is a Bastard, and incapable to inherit any Part of the
Title, Honour or Estate of or belonging to the House of <HI>Rutland;</HI> and
the same Incapacity to attend all other Children, which from that Time,
the Birth of <HI>Ignoto,</HI> had or might be born from the Body of that Lady.”
And this Bill being presented to the House of Peers by a Lord nearly al∣lied
to that Family, the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> being present with the Marquis,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
as soon as it was read the Marquis stood up, and “with Expressions of
Trouble, and of the Justice that was due to the Greatness of a noble
House, that had received a foul Blemish by a Woman of too near a Re∣lation
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
to him, of whom He was ashamed,” gave his free Consent to the
Bill, and desired that it might pass: And the Earl likewise besought the
House, “that so infamous a Branch might not be ingrafted into his Family,
of which his Son the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> was the sole Heir Male, with whom the
Honour must expire.”</P>
<P>IT was a Case of general Concernment as well as Compassion, that an
impudent Woman should have the Power to give an Heir to inherit a noble
Title and Fortune by Descent, when it was so notoriously known and ad∣judged
to be illegitimate, and a mere Stranger to the Blood of the House.
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Yet there were some very good Lords, and who detested the Woman and
the Wickedness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Lords a∣gainst a Precedent of this Nature.</NOTE> made much Scruple of making a new Precedent in a par∣ticular
Case, that undermined a Foundation of Law, and opened a Door
to let in an unjust Declaration, upon Pretences not so well proved, to the
Disinherison of one that should not be illegitimate. But though it was a
rare Case, it was found not to be a new one, there having been one or two
Declarations of Bastardy in Parliament in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
and <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it was as just that She should be heard, to defend both herself
and her Son; and therefore the Bill being read the second Time, it was
<MILESTONE N="20"/>committed, with Direction “that the Lady should have personal Notice to
attend, before the Committee entered upon it:” And after long Inquiry
at the Places where She used to be, it was found that She had transported
herself into <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Company of the Person whom She had preferred
before her Husband; and there was Reason to believe, that it was after She
had Notice of the Bill. However all Proceedings were respited till there
was full Proof given to the House, by the Person himself who had spoken
with her in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and given her the Warrant that required her Attend∣ance
upon the Committee: And then, after many Days longer Delay, it
was read and debated, and by the Committee reported to the House to be
<MILESTONE N="30"/>engrossed.</P>
<P>AND then,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>obstructs the Bill.</HI></NOTE> and not till then, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> opposed the pass∣ing
of it, upon Pretence, “that in the Bill the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> had assumed a
Title that belonged to him by his Mother, who had been Heir Female
to <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Rutland;</HI>” when that Title, now challenged, had de∣scended
to <HI>George</HI> the Brother of <HI>Francis,</HI> and had been enjoyed by two Earls
of <HI>Rutland</HI> since. It was generally thought a strange Exception: Nor was
it known, whether the Duke was disposed to it as a Revenge upon the
Marquis, or to shew his own Power (for He had many who concurred with
him in Both Houses upon many Occasions), or whether He did in Truth
<MILESTONE N="40"/>desire to support the Lady in her Infamy, He not being over-tender in Cases
of that Nature. However it was necessary to recommit the Bill, that some
Expedient might be there found to remove the Obstruction, which though
He was obstinate in till the House was tired with many Days Debate upon
it, in which most of his Adherents upon the Unreasonableness left him, He
persisted still and maintained the Debate almost alone, till the Time of the
Session approached; when the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> was compelled to humour him in
leaving out a Title that all the World gave him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But it is at length passed.</NOTE> And then, after into∣lerable
Vexation to the House and Loss of Time, He desisted to appear
against it; and the Act passed the Royal Assent.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>THE ill Humour of the House of Commons was not abated; and though
They knew well that their <HI>Irish</HI> Bill could never have passed the upper House
but by the King's powerful Interposition, They remained still jealous, or pre∣tended
to be so, that He would not give his Assent; which till He should do,
<PB N="390" REF="396"/>
They would admit no Debate of Money: So that as soon as the Bill was pre∣sented
to him, his Majesty came to the House of Peers, and sent for the Com∣mons
to attend him upon the 18th Day of <HI>January;</HI> when, after He had given
his Consent to that and another private Bill which They had presented, He told
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King passes the <HI>Irish</HI> Bill with a Speech.</NOTE> “that He had now passed their Bills, and that He had been in Hope
to have had other Bills ready to have passed too.” He said, “that He
could not forget, that within few Days after their coming together in <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
Both Houses had presented to him their Vote and Declaration,
<HI>that They would give him a Supply proportionable to his Occasions;</HI> and the
Confidence of that had made him anticipate that small Part of his Revenue<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which was unanticipated, for the Payment of the Seamen; and his Cre∣dit
had gone farther than He had Reason to think it would, but it was
now at an End.”</P>
<P>“THIS was the first Day,” He said, “He had heard of a Supply, being
the 18th of <HI>January,</HI> and what it would amount unto, God only knew;
and what Time He had to make such Preparations as were necessary to
meet three such Enemies as He had, They could well enough judge. And
He must tell them, what Discourses soever were abroad, He was not in
any Treaty; but by the Grace of God He would not give over himself
and them, but would do what was in his Power for Defence of Both. It<MILESTONE N="20"/>
was high Time for them to make good their Promise; and it was high
Time for them to be in the Country, as well for the raising of Money, as
that the Lords Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieutenants might watch those se∣ditious
Spirits which were at Work to disturb the publick Peace. And
therefore He was resolved to put an End to that Session on <HI>Monday</HI> next
come Sennight, before which Time He desired that all Things might be
made ready that He was to dispatch.” His Majesty said, “He was not
willing to complain that They had dealt unkindly with him in a Bill He
had then passed, in which They had manifested a greater Distrust of him
than He had deserved. He did not pretend to be without Infirmities, but<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He had never broken his Word to them; and if He did not flatter him∣self,
the Nation had never less Cause to complain of Grievances, or the
least Injustice or Oppression, than it had had in those seven Years since it
had pleased God to restore him to them: He would,” He said, “be glad
to be used accordingly.”</P>
<P>THIS little Quickness in his Majesty prevailed more upon them, than all
the former Application had done: And now They saw that They should not
be suffered to continue longer together, They resolved to leave some Relish
of their former Duty and Compliance. Not that the Humour was at all re∣formed
or abated in those who had shewed so much Frowardness, who still<MILESTONE N="40"/>
continued as perverse as ever; but They were over-ruled by the major Part
of the House, as They would have been sooner, if it had not been that a
contrary Course had been pursfued to what had been formerly. Nor were
They, who had advised that Change, willing that his Majesty should de∣cline
the same Method, and were much troubled that He had not caressed
the House more in his late Discourse. And as They had before advised his
Majesty freely and without any Condition to offer the Repeal, and release
the Act that had granted the Chimney-Money to him, which was a very
good and a growing Revenue, but They observed to be unpopular; upon a
Presumption (which They assured him could not fail) that so generous an<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Action in his Majesty towards his People would be immediately requited by
a Grant of much greater Value (and They had prevailed in this Counsel, if
the Chancellor and the Treasurer had not with great Resolution opposed it,
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
and made evident to his Majesty, “that He ought never to propose it himself
though with Conditions, because it would make the Grace undervalued,
and the Conditions to be esteemed unreasonable; nor to hearken to any
general Proposition, or consent to the Repeal of that Act, without having
a full and equivalent Recompense (which ought to be very well weighed)
granted in the same Act of Parliament; for He had now sufficient Evi∣dence,
that the constant Good-Humour of the House was not to be de∣pended
upon:” Which confirmed his Majesty to resolve never to hearken to
the one without the other, and so that Mischief was prevented): So They were
<MILESTONE N="10"/>now as desirous that the House of Commons would still press the Dispatch
of the Bill of Accounts, which rested in the Lords House; and assured them,
“that if They would embrace the same Positiveness They had done, the
Chancellor would be no more able to hinder the passing of that Act, than
He had been to keep his Majesty from consenting to the <HI>Irish</HI> Bill so much
against his Resolution.” But They and their Friends could not keep up
the same Spirit of Stubbornness in the House, nor prevail with the King to
recede from his Purpose: So that the Bill for Accounts remained still in the
House of Lords not fully discussed. And such a Progress was made in the
House of Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Supply granted.</NOTE> notwithstanding all Opposition, that a Bill for Supply
<MILESTONE N="20"/>was prepared within the Time prescribed, though in Respect of the Propor∣tion
not equal to the Occasions, and entangled still with the same inconve∣nient
Clauses and <HI>Provisos</HI> which had so unwarily been admitted at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
and which made what was granted unapplicable to the procuring ready Mo∣ney;
of which his Majesty was now fully convinced. But the Time was too
short to labour in the Alteration. And so the Bill, as it was, was sent up to
the Lords, who, after the short Formality that cannot be avoided, gave it
a Passage through that House: So that it was now ready for the King.</P>
<P>THE 8th of <HI>February</HI> the King came to the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech at the Prorogation of the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and the Speaker
of the House presented the Bill to the King, who gave his Royal Assent to it,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and thanked them for it, with his Assurance “that the Money should be
laid out for the Ends it was given: However,” He said, “He hoped He
should live to have Bills of this Nature in the old Style, with fewer <HI>Pro∣visos.”</HI>
He took Notice, “that the Bill of Accounts for the Money that
had been already raised since the War was not offered to him: But,” his
Majesty said, “that He would take Care (after so much Noise) that the
same should not be stifled; but that He would issue out his Commission
in the Manner He had formerly promised the House of Peers; and the
Commissioners should have very much to answer, if They should not dis∣cover
all Matters of Fraud and Cozenage.” He told them, “the Sea∣son
<MILESTONE N="40"/>of the Year was very far spent, in which the Enemy had got great
Advantage; but by the Help of God, He would make all the Prepara∣tions
He could, and as fast as He could: And yet He would tell them,
that if any good Overtures were made for an honourable Peace, He would
not reject them; and He believed all sober Men would be glad to see it
brought to pass.”</P>
<P>“HE would now prorogue them till towards Winter, that They might in
their several Places intend the Peace and Security of their several Coun∣tries,
where there were unquiet Spirits still working. He did pray them,
and” said “He did expect it from them, that They would use their ut∣most
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Endeavours to remove all those false Imaginations out of the Hearts
of the People, which the Malice of ill Men had industriously infused into
them, of He knew not what Jealousies and Grievances: For He must tell
them again, and He was sure He was in the Right, <HI>that the People had never
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>
so little Cause to complain of Oppression and Grievances, as They had since
his Return to them.</HI> If the Taxes and Impositions were grievous and heavy
upon them, They would put them in Mind, that a War with such pow∣erful
Enemies could not be maintained without Taxes; and He was sure
the Money raised thereby came not into his Purse.” He concluded “with
promising himself good Effects from their Affections and Wisdoms, where∣ever
They were: And He did hope They should all meet again of one
Mind, for his Honour, and the Good of the Kingdom.” And so They
were prorogued to the 10th Day of <HI>October</HI> next.</P>
<P>AND now the King had very much to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Commis∣ers for in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing pub-Accounts.</NOTE> more than He had Time or<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Tools to dispatch. Yet He began first where the Parliament left off, that
when They came again together They might have no Cause to say, that He
had not performed what He had promised, and so with the same Passion
renew their Clamour upon the Accounts, which was made now a very po∣pular
Complaint; and whoever was accused of obstructing that Examination,
was presently concluded to have had a Share in the Prey. Yet He was not willing
that such a strict Account or Examination should be made, especially into
the Receipt of the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> for the Prizes, that all the World should know
what Money had been issued out by his own immediate Orders, and to
whom. Hereupon He commanded his Attorney and Solicitor General to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
prepare a Commission, with all necessary Clauses, to call all Persons to Ac∣count
who had received any such Monies, and to examine and take any
Exception to the same.</P>
<P>AND that there might be no just Exception to the Commission, which
He knew would be strictly looked into, They were required “to advise with
all or any of the Judges, that it might have their Approbation; and that
there should be a Clause in the Commission, whereby the Commissioners
should be authorised to call any of the Judges to their Assistance, when
upon any Matters of Difficulty They should think it necessary.” And that
there might be no Exception to any of the Commissioners, as like to be par∣tial<MILESTONE N="30"/>
in Respect of Friendship or Alliance to any of those who were to be
called before them, his Majesty appointed all those Persons, who were no∣minated
for Commissioners in the Bill sent to the House of Lords by the
Commons, to be inserted into this Commission; and likewise made Choice
of such a Number of the Peers as was fit, to be joined to the others, and
named those who had upon all Debates in the House appeared most soli∣citous,
that a very exact Account should be required, and of such others
who had no Relation to the Court, and were looked upon with the utmost
Esteem by the House of Commons: All which was prepared with the Ex∣pedition
that was possible, and the Commission sealed; and Notice given<MILESTONE N="40"/>
to all the Commissioners, that They should meet at a Place appointed, upon
a Day named, presently after <HI>Easter,</HI> by which Time the Judges would be
returned out of their Circuits; and They were then at Liberty to adjourn
to what Place They pleased.</P>
<P>WE are now to enter upon the Occurrences of the Year 1667, a Year
little more prosperous to the Publick than the Year preceding, and fatal in
Respect to many calamitous Accidents to the Chancellor, and which put a
Period to his Greatness; the Circumstances whereof, very notorious, were
so interwoven with the publick Transactions of State, that it is not easy to
make a distinct and clear Relation of the one without the other.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Temper the Parliament had been in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King in∣volved in great Difficulties.</NOTE> and the Delay They had used
in giving the King any Supply towards the carrying on the War, made the
King discern that He had been too confident of their Generosity, and that
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
They had already departed from that Spirit with which They first had per∣suaded
him to enter into that War: And it was as evident (which had been
often foretold to him) that the <HI>Dutch</HI> could endure being beaten longer than
He could endure to beat them. They were now relieved and supplied with
the Money of <HI>France,</HI> and the governing Party had subdued all Contradic∣tions;
and whatever their Affections were, all Compliance and Submission
appeared to the Commands of the State; and there wanted Nothing but
the Season of the Year to carry their Fleet again to Sea, as great and as
well provided as it had ever been. All Murmuring was transplanted from
<MILESTONE N="10"/>thence into <HI>England,</HI> where it grew up plentifully: And the King was,
upon the Credit of an Act of Parliament that was passed on the 8th of <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI>
to provide a Fleet ready to encounter with the potent Enemies in the
Spring. There was no Trade by Sea, and therefore could not be much by
Land, that could bring any Benefit to the King; and the Seamen ran all to
the Privateers, who adventured for Booty, which They preferred before serv∣ing
in the Royal Navy.</P>
<P>THE King in those Streights called that Council together with whom He
used to consult his most secret Affairs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He consults the private Com∣mittee upon the perplexing State of his Affairs.</NOTE> and the chief Officers at Sea, and
the Commissioners of the Navy, attended to give such Information as was
<MILESTONE N="20"/>necessary before any Resolution could be taken. There the whole State of
the Navy was inquired into; what was in the Stores, and what the Defects or
Deficiencies were, and what Hopes there were of supplying them; what
Ships were ready, and what would be made ready in three Months. The
Victualler was sent for to give an Account what Provision of Victuals was
ready, and what could be provided and put on Board in the same Time,
which was the utmost that could be limited. Every Officer protested, “ that
there could not be the least Attempt towards any Preparations without a
good Sum of ready Money:” And the Yards were in that Necessity by
Reason of the great Arrear of Wages that was due to them, that They were
<MILESTONE N="30"/>near a Mutiny, and could not be kept to their Work, being necessitated to
do any Work abroad to get Victual for their Families. The inferiour Of∣ficers,
which belonged to the Stores, lived by stealing and selling what They
were entrusted to keep. In short: All Things were presented to be in that
Confusion, that there appeared no Probability of being able to set out any
Fleet before the Enemy would be so strong upon the Coast, that it would be
very difficult to make a Conjunction between those Ships which were in the
River, and the other which were at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> and in other Ports.</P>
<P>THIS desperate Representation did not make the King take a sudden Re∣solution:
But the same Council met many Days Morning and Evening. All
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Ways were thought upon which might administer Hope to get any Money;
and Considerations were entered upon what was to be done in Case a Fleet
could not be provided fit to engage the Enemy, and which Way a defensive
War was to be made at Sea, and how the Trade should be secured, and the
Coasts and Harbours be so preserved, that the Enemy might do no Affront
at Land; for every Day brought loose and ungrounded Intelligence of Bodies
of Horse and Foot, drawn in <HI>France</HI> to the Seaside in many Places upon
that large Coast, and likewise in <HI>Holland,</HI> and great Provision of Flatbot∣toms,
as if They intended to make some Descent; which Kind of Rumours
exceedingly discomposed the common People, though They who understood
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the Expeditions of that Nature, and with what Difficulty Land Armies
were transported, were not moved by those Reports. After all Expedients
were considered and well weighed, his Majesty found Cause to despair of
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>
being able to set out in any Time a Fleet equal to the Occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Resolution taken to act on the Defensive.</NOTE> and so
contracted his Thoughts to the other Part, for the Defensive.</P>
<P>THERE is a Point of Land on the <HI>Kentish</HI> Coast that extends itself into
the Sea, and at the very Entrance of the River, where the King had often
thought and discoursed of erecting a Royal Fort, that would both preserve
the Coast, and likewise be a great Security to the River: And the prose∣cuting
this Design was in this Consultation thought of great Importance, and
the erecting another Fort in another Place, and repairing and strengthening
<HI>Landguard Point</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Preparations for the Sea, it was thought fit and enough, “that a<MILESTONE N="10"/>
good Squadron of light Frigats should ride on the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and another of the same Strength lie off <HI>Plymouth,</HI> Both which should
intercept the Trade of <HI>Holland</HI> both outward and inward, if They did not
maintain it with strong Convoys, which would break their Fleet; and in
those Cases the Frigats would easily retire to their Harbours. That some
Frigats should be always in the <HI>Downs,</HI> to chase Picaroons from infesting
the Coast, and to observe and get Intelligence of the Enemies Motion,
and upon Occasion should retire up the River. That there should be
some of the greatest Ships at <HI>Chatham, Portsmouth</HI> and other Places, pre∣pared
and put in Readiness against the End of Summer, before which<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Time Money might be provided: And then the Enemies Fleet being
weary and soul, it might be presumed the <HI>French</HI> would return early into
their own Ports, which were so far off; and then the Frigats from the
<HI>West</HI> and the <HI>North</HI> might find the Way to join with the great Ships,
which should be ready against that Time, and either fight the <HI>Dutch</HI> if
They should choose it, or infest their Coast more than They had done this,
and take all their Ships homeward bound from all Places, which, upon the
Fame of their being Masters of the Sea all the Summer, would repair
Home without Apprehension of an Enemy.” And there were some Of∣ficers
of great Experience at Sea, who, being called by the King to advise<MILESTONE N="30"/>
upon this Project, declared with Confidence, “that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would be
greater Losers by the War thus conducted the next Summer, than They
had been in any Year since the War begun.”</P>
<P>FOR the Security of Trade, it was declared, “that there was no possible
Way to secure it but by restraining it, and not suffering any Merchants
Ships to go to Sea, and by giving them Advice to send to all their Factors
and Correspondents, <HI>that They should send no Goods Home till They received
new Orders:</HI>” Which Restraint some were against, “both because it
would have an ill Reception with the People, when They should find that
a War, which had been entered into for the Enlargement and Advance∣ment<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of Trade, had produced a Cessation of all Trade; and it would ap∣pear
very hard that Men, who had laid out their own Stocks and were
willing to venture them, should be forbid and hindered from sending
them to those Markets for which They had provided them, which would
turn to little less Loss to them than They should incur by their being
taken by the Enemy. Then it would be, not a Discouragement but a
Dissipation of the Seamen, who, if They could have no Employment
in the King's Ships or in the Merchant Ships, would be scattered abroad
to seek their Fortune, so that They would not be brought together when
the King had Occasion for their Service. In the last Place: That the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
giving this Order for Restraint, and Advice to the Merchants to inform
their Factors and Correspondents, would be, and could not choose but be,
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>
an absolute Publication of this Resolution of the King to send out no Fleet
in the Spring; which was yet agreed to be the highest Secret.”</P>
<P>ALL these Reasons were temperately weighed and answered. “That it
could not be unreasonable or unjust to hinder Men from doing them∣selves
Harm: The King could not take their Goods from them to his
own Use; but He might lawfully hinder them from spoiling or destroy∣ing
the Goods that were their own. That their being taken by the
Enemy (which would be unavoidable) concerned the King and the King∣dom
little less than it did the private Owners: It would increase the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Insolence and the Wealth of the Enemy, and reflect upon his Majesty's
Honour as well as impoverish his Subjects; and the Difference would be
very great between losing their Goods, and keeping them upon their Hands
for a better Market. For the Dissipation of the Seamen, there would no
great Danger be of that: The Squadrons on the Western and the Northern
Coasts, which must be very well manned, would entertain good Num∣bers;
and the rest would put themselves on Board the Privateers, who
should be all bound to come Home against the Time the King would have
Occasion for their Service, and then the Privateers should be restrained as
now the Merchants. For the keeping the present Resolution secret, which
<MILESTONE N="20"/>would by this Means be published, it were to be desired that it might re∣main
a Secret as long as should be possible: But as discerning Men would
easily discover it, and could not but already know that it was impossible
for the King in Time to set out a Fleet, so it would quickly be evident
to all the World; and the Secret was not to be affected longer than it could
be concealed.”</P>
<P>THERE was another Inconvenience or Mischief that was in View, that
would <HI>come like an armed Man</HI> upon the City, which was Want of Fewel,
especially the Want of Coals from <HI>Newcastle,</HI> of which there had been a
vast Quantity consumed in the late Fire, which had likewise consumed those
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Houses and Chimnies which should be supplied; yet the People remained
still, and were not like to be much the warmer for being crowded closer
together. But to that there could no other Remedy applied, but the send∣ing
Orders to <HI>Newcastle</HI> to employ all their Ships, and all They could
procure, in sending as much Coal as was possible to <HI>London</HI> and the Towns
adjacent, before the Enemies Fleet could put to Sea; and Convoys were
assigned too strong for their Privateers or small Parties of their Men of War:
And the King gave two or three Vessels of his own, and likewise Money, to
fetch Coals, that the Poor might have them at the Rates they cost; and di∣rected
the City to do the same. All which produced some good Effect.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>UPON the whole Matter, and thorough Examination of the Whole, the
King concluded upon all the Particulars mentioned before, assigning proper
Persons to supervise every Particular, that all should be executed in Time
that was agreed upon. The Duke issued out all his Orders to the Ships,
with which Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King in∣spects the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣tification, of</HI> Sheerne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> whose Office it was: And
the King would charge himself with that which was most important, the
Fortification at <HI>Sheerness;</HI> whither his Majesty made a Journey in the Cold
and Depth of Winter, and took an Engineer and some Officers of the Ord∣nance
with him, that all Things might be supplied from thence which be∣longed
to that Office. He caused Master-Workmen to be sent from <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and drew common Labourers enough out of the Country, having pro∣vided
Money to pay them. And after all Things were in this Order, and
He had seen the Work begun, He left the Master-Engineer, whom He de∣signed
to be the Governour of the Fort, for which He was very equal, upon
<PB N="396" REF="402"/>
the Place; and committed the overlooking of the Whole, that all possible
Expedition might be used, to one of the Commissioners of the Ordnance,
who promised to look carefully to it: And his Majesty returned to <HI>London,</HI>
when in the Opinion of all his Servants He had stayed too long in such a
Season, and such an Air, to the Danger of his Health. How all those Re∣solutions
and Orders were executed afterwards, or complied with, must un∣avoidably
be mentioned in its Place.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagined by any Man who in any Degree knew him, that
the Chancellor, though He was present, could have any Part in these Reso∣lutions
but the submitting to them; every Particular being so much out of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
his Sphere, that He never pretended to understand what was fit and rea∣sonable
to be done: Nor throughout the whole Conduct of the War was
He ever known to presume to give an Advice; but presuming that all whose
Profession it was advised what was fit, He readily concurred. And He did
always declare, “that in this last Consultation all Points were so fully de∣bated;
and that there was so concurrent an Opinion in the Commanders
of the Ships, and the Officers of the Navy, with the Approbation of the
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the General, <HI>that it was not possible to
set out a Fleet in Time equal to that of the Enemy, to engage with it; and
that the next best would be to stand upon the Defensive in the Manner pro∣posed:</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
That it did not appear to him, that there was any Election left but
to pursue that Course,” which He did believe very reasonably proposed and
resolved upon; nor did any Thing occur to him, why very much Good
might not be hoped from it, He being so totally unskilful in the Knowledge
of the Coast and the River, that He knew not where <HI>Sheerness</HI> was, nor
had ever heard of the Name of such a Place till this last Discourse, nor had
ever been upon any Part of the River with any other Thought about him,
than to get on Shore as soon as could be possible.</P>
<P>THE King had not himself thought of this defensive Way, but approved
it very much when He heard it so fully discussed, and in which himself had<MILESTONE N="30"/>
proposed all his Doubts, which no Man raised more pertinently in Arguments
of that Nature than his Majesty; and it may be He liked it the better, be∣cause
at that Time, as He was heartily weary of the War, so He was not
without a reasonable Hope of Peace, which He resolved to cherish, as He
told the Parliament at parting He would do. The Grounds of which Hope,
and the Progress thereupon, the entering upon a Treaty, and the Conclusion
thereof, will be the Discourse and Relation We shall next enter upon.</P>
<P>How ill Success soever had attended the Negotiation of <HI>Denmark</HI> by the
Irresolution and Unsteadiness of that Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Swedes <HI>disposed to as∣sist the</HI> Eng∣lish.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had conducted
what had been committed to him with very good Effect in <HI>Sweden.</HI> And<MILESTONE N="40"/>
after He had disposed that Court (where He had rendered himself extremely
acceptable) to a just Esteem of the King's Friendship, and an equal Aver∣sion
to the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and concluded such Articles as were for the present
and joint Convenience and Benefit of Both Nations, and prepared them to
be willing to enter into a stricter and nearer Alliance, and to that Purpose
to send Ambassadours into <HI>England,</HI> where They had an Agent; He re∣turned
to give his Majesty an Account and Information of the Constitution
and Temper of that Court, and of the Nature and Disposition of the two
Ambassadours who were to attend his Majesty, who were chosen before He
left <HI>Stockholm,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They send Ambassadours into</HI> England.</NOTE> and resolved to embark within ten Days: Which They did,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and arrived about the Time, or soon after, that the City was so miserably
destroyed by Fire; which was the less favourable Conjuncture, not so much
by the Influence that dreadful Distraction and Damage was like to have
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
upon the vigorous carrying on the War, as by the ill Humour which the
Parliament shortly after appeared to be in, and their manifest Obstinacy
against the King's Desires; which was a Temper very different from what
They expected to have found, and what They had been informed had pos∣sessed
them from the Time of his Majesty's Return. Nor was this manifest
Indisposition without some unhappy Impression upon the Spirits of the Am∣bassadours,
and that Alacrity They brought with them presently to enter
into a Treaty, and Conjunction of Forces against the common Enemy.</P>
<P>IT was manifest enough, that the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> was weary of the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Obligations They had been long bound in to <HI>France,</HI> which had superci∣liously
neglected of late to comply with what was on their Part to be per∣formed;
and rather endeavoured to make Alliances with <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the
lesser neighbour Princes, as those of the House of <HI>Brunswick</HI> and <HI>Lunen∣burg,</HI>
to their Disadvantage, than to consider that Crown which had been
so useful to them, as if their Friendship was so considerable to them. Nor
was this out of a real Disesteem of them; but that They might bind them
to a faster Dependance upon them, and that They might not be severed
from their Interest, whatsoever They should declare it to be. And there∣fore,
when it was first suspected that They might be inclined to <HI>England,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and <HI>Holland</HI> apprehended that They might be induced to make a Con∣junction
with the Bishop of <HI>Munster, France</HI> (as hath been touched before)
sent their Ambassadour <HI>Pompone</HI> into <HI>Sweden,</HI> with a full Year's Salary of
what was in Arrear, much more still remaining due, and to incline that
Crown to a Neutrality between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> in which He
found Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had prevented him, and though He had not then the
Character of Ambassadour, He was much better respected there than He
was. And as They would have joined with the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> if He
had advanced according to his Pretence, or had not been absolutely taken
off by <HI>France;</HI> so, when He was diverted from his Purpose, They were the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>more inclined to make a firm Alliance with <HI>England,</HI> and thereby such a
farther Conjunction with other Princes, Protestant or Catholick, that might
give some Check to the impetuous Humour of <HI>France,</HI> which They now
were as jealous of, and of their overflowing all the Banks which belonged to
their Neighbours, as They had been formerly of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> and
for the same Reason were as desirous to retire from any Dependance upon or
Relation to that Crown, as They had been formerly of its Protection; and
were very well prepared to change their Alliance, and, if They might not
be Losers by it, to make a Conjunction with <HI>Germany</HI> and the House of
<HI>Austria,</HI> into which it was reasonable to be presumed that the <HI>United Pro∣vinces</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>would be glad to be received upon moderate Conditions, when a Peace
should be made with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>AND this was the Prospect that had been presented to them by Mr. <HI>Co∣ventry,</HI>
and upon View of which They now sent their Ambassadours, with∣out
being terrified by the Declaration of <HI>France</HI> on the Behalf of the <HI>Dutch;</HI>
and with a Resolution, if They could not persuade <HI>Holland</HI> to separate from
that Conjunction, and make a Peace apart with the King (which They la∣boured
by their Ambassadour the Count of <HI>Dhona</HI> to the <HI>States</HI>) to join their
Interest frankly to that of his Majesty, and to run the Hazard and expect
the Issue and Event of the War.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>THE two Ambassadours were <HI>Flemming</HI> and <HI>Coyet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Charac∣ters of the Ambassadours.</NOTE> Both Senators in the
great Council of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Men of prime Authority there: The former
of the greater Place and Esteem, being a Nobleman of an ancient and noble
Extraction of a Family in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that had lived through many Descents
<PB N="398" REF="404"/>
in <HI>Sweden</HI> in great Employment and Lustre; and this Man never dissembled
a particular Devotion to the King, and for that Reason principally was de∣signed
to this Negotiation. The other was not so well born or bred, or
of so cheerful a Complexion, but a more thinking and melancholick Man,
more conversant in Books, and more versed in the Course and Forms of
Business; and by his own Virtue and humble Industry had from a mean
and low Birth, which in those Northern Kingdoms is the highest Disad∣vantage,
by Degrees ascended to the Degree of a Senator, which is the
chiefest Qualification; and had gotten his first Credit and Reputation by a
Negotiation He was intrusted with in <HI>Holland,</HI> and a Treaty well managed<MILESTONE N="10"/>
by him there; which made him liable in that Court to be much inclined
to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to have some particular Friendship with <HI>De Wit,</HI> They
having studied together in <HI>Leyden</HI> when They were young; and their Fa∣miliarity
after was improved to a good Correspondence in that Negotiation
in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>THIS being well known and commonly spoken of there, Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI>
endeavoured to prevent his Designation to that Employment, by speaking to
the Chancellor of that Kingdom, who always received him with open Arms,
and gave good Testimony of his hearty and passionate Desire of a firm Con∣junction
between the two Crowns; and, though He was of a <HI>French</HI> Ex∣traction,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
had a full Jealousy of the Want of Sincerity and Justice of that
Nation. When He discovered the Apprehension Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had, He
persuaded him to acquiesce in his Judgment rather than to credit common
Rumour: “That He well knew Both, and had contributed to the Election of
Both, who were very fit to be joined together in an Employment of this
Nature, the Gaiety and Warmth of the one standing in Need sometimes of
the Phlegm of the other, who would yet pay that Reverence to him that
was due to his superiour Quality; and that He was too good a <HI>Swede</HI> to
have Inclinations to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> how much Conversation soever He had
with them. In a Word, He would pass his Word;” which put an End<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to all farther Doubts: And it was well enough known, that He had been
raised by and was a Creature of the Chancellor.</P>
<P>AND in Truth, from the Time of their Arrival in <HI>England</HI> He carried
himself very fairly, and without any visible Inclination to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
much less to the <HI>French;</HI> and They Both very frankly declared to those of
the King's Ministers with whom They conferred with Intimacy, “that that
Crown would gladly be separated from them, if a good Expedient might
be found to make them no Losers by it.” Yet it is as true, that after
They had been some Months in <HI>England,</HI> and saw in how ill a Posture the
King was for the carrying on the War, and how far the Parliament was from<MILESTONE N="40"/>
giving Money, or from any reasonable Compliance with his Majesty's De∣sires,
<HI>Coyet</HI> did not concur with the same Warmth in his Dispatches, with
<HI>Flemming,</HI> into <HI>Sweden;</HI> but writ apart to the Ministers there, “that They
must take new Measures, and not depend upon a Conjunction with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to which, how well soever the King was inclined, He would not
be able to bear the Part They expected, by Reason that He had no
Power with the Parliament;” which Letters his Majesty's Agent then in
<HI>Sweden</HI> had a Sight of: Which produced no other Effect there, but a Re∣solution,
that if They saw that either the King was inclined to a Peace, or
would be reduced to a Necessity to treat, the Ambassadours should offer in<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Name of their Master his Interposition, which their Ministers in <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Holland</HI> should then likewise make Proffer of, upon Advertisement first
from them, but with a secret Assurance to the King, “that if a Treaty
<PB N="399" REF="405"/>
should not take Effect” (which it could hardly be believed it would do),
the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> would firmly unite itself to his Majesty's Interest,
and engage in the War with him;”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweden <HI>is de∣sirous of a se∣parate Treaty with</HI> Holland.</NOTE> which it was evident They were more
inclined to, than to a Peace in which <HI>France</HI> might be comprehended. But
that which They most desired was, that a Peace might be made with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> without comprehending <HI>France,</HI> in which They would willingly
enter, which would draw <HI>Spain</HI> and all the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> to desire to
be admitted for their own Security.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Molina</HI> was Ambassadour from <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The same en∣deavoured by the</HI> Spanish <HI>and</HI> Imperial <HI>Ambassadours.</HI></NOTE> near the King, a
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Man rather sincere than subtil, and so had the more Need of the Advice
and Assistance of the Baron of <HI>Isola,</HI> who was, under the Title of Envoy from
the Emperour, entirely trusted and supported (as most of the Emperour's Mi∣nisters
were) by the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> who being a <HI>Burgundian,</HI> born in those
Parts which remain subject to <HI>Spain,</HI> had an implacable Hatred to the
<HI>French;</HI> and by the Employments He had undergone in <HI>Italy</HI> and other
Places, where He had been Ambassadour, had made himself so considerable,
that He was become notoriously odious to the <HI>French,</HI> and was a Man of
great Experience and very subtil Parts. Both those Ministers did heartily
wish a Peace between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> with the Exclusion of <HI>France:</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>But if that could not be, They had much rather the War should continue
as it was, than that <HI>France</HI> should be comprehended in the Peace; for
which They had some Reason. For at this Time the King of <HI>Spain</HI> died,
which They had too many Reasons to believe would put an End to the Quiet
of <HI>Flanders;</HI> and therefore would be glad that They might have the Assist∣ance
of <HI>England</HI> for their Defence, and in which <HI>Holland</HI> could not think
itself unconcerned. The Probability of this, and the constant Intelligence
They received from the <HI>Hague,</HI> “that there were already Jealousies grown
up between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI>” persuaded them, and They en∣deavoured
to persuade the King, “that <HI>Holland</HI> might be now induced to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>treat by themselves; or if They could not do that, but must proceed
jointly with <HI>France,</HI> They would upon Assurance of the King's Affection
sever themselves from them, if They insisted upon any Thing that was
not for the joint Benefit of all.” The King left them to do what They
thought fit towards it, without undertaking any Thing on his Part until
their fair Intentions were discerned, and then to assure them of his Majesty's
Inclinations to Peace upon just and honourable Conditions.</P>
<P>THERE is no Doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holland <HI>and</HI> France <HI>jealous of each other.</HI></NOTE> there was a real Jealousy and Dissatisfaction between
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> at this Time. The <HI>Dutch</HI> complained, “that the <HI>French</HI>
had broken their Promise with them no less this Year than They had done
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the last: They had indeed declared and proclaimed a War, but They had
done no Acts of Hostility; and whereas They were engaged that their
Fleet should have joined with theirs in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> They had
never been in View but at a great Distance, and suffered the <HI>Dutch</HI> to fight
so many Days together without any Help from them. And upon their
renewed Promise, They had again carried out their Fleet to meet with
them in <HI>August;</HI> when They failed again, and left them exposed to the
whole <HI>English</HI> Fleet: So that They were compelled with some Loss to get
again into their Harbours.” And now They had a real Apprehension, that
They might treat with <HI>England</HI> apart, and leave them to support the War
<MILESTONE N="50"/>at Sea by themselves, whilst They pursued their Expedition against <HI>Flanders</HI>
upon the Death of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other Side, <HI>France</HI> as much complained of the Proceedings of the
<HI>Dutch:</HI> “That after They had received a great Sum of Money from them,
<PB N="400" REF="406"/>
without which They could not have set out their Fleet, They no more cared
for a Conjunction with their Ships, nor went to that Length at Sea which
They were bound to to join with them; which They might have done, if
They had continued their Course when They put to Sea in the Beginning
of <HI>June.</HI> Instead of which They went over to the Coast of <HI>England</HI> to find
the <HI>English,</HI> confessing thereby, that They had no Need of the Assistance
of the <HI>French</HI> Ships; but leaving them to shift for themselves. And after∣wards,
in the End of <HI>August,</HI> They came not to the Place They had
promised to have done; by Reason of which Neglect and Breach of
Faith, if a singular Act of Providence had not prevented it, their whole<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Fleet had fallen into the Hands of the <HI>English,</HI> as some Part of it did.”
But that which made them likewise willing that this War should be at an
End was, that now, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> being dead, They might enter upon
a War with <HI>Spain;</HI> towards which They prepared <HI>Manifestos</HI> to publish upon
the Matter of their Right, and already prepared Levies of Men, of which
They could pretend no other Use: Yet They professed to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Am∣bassadour
to have no such Design in their Purposes. However They would
not enter upon any Treaty apart without the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Nor would <HI>De Wit,</HI>
who entirely governed the Councils of <HI>Holland,</HI> be induced to consent to
any Overtures made to separate, before or in the Treaty, from <HI>France;</HI> but<MILESTONE N="20"/>
gave Information of whatsoever was proposed by the Baron of <HI>Isola,</HI> or the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> or any other Person, to that Purpose, and enlarged upon that In∣formation
more than was true, to endear his own Punctuality.</P>
<P>THE Mother of the King was then at <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother endea∣vours to bring about a Peace with</HI> France.</NOTE> having chosen rather to re∣side
there than in <HI>England,</HI> since She saw the Resolution of a War between
them, and desired Nothing more than to be an Instrument in the composing
those Differences, which She thought were not good for either of the Crowns;
and found now another Style in that Court than it had used to discourse in,
and, from the Time of the News of the Death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that
the <HI>French</HI> King had spoken as if He wished a Peace with <HI>England:</HI> Where∣upon<MILESTONE N="30"/>
about the Time when the Parliament was prorogued, the Earl of <HI>St.
Albans</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>She fends the Earl of</HI> St. Albans <HI>into</HI> England <HI>for that Purpose.</HI></NOTE> as to look to the Queen's Affairs, of which He
was the great Intendant. He informed the King “of the good Temper the
<HI>French</HI> Court was in, and that He was confident, if his Majesty would
make any Advance towards a Peace, the Queen would be able to dispose
that King to hearken to it, and to be a Mediator between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Holland;</HI> and either to draw them to consent to what was just, or to se∣parate
from them: And He thought it very reasonable, that the Condi∣tions
should be referred to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who He was sure, upon
such a Trust, would be very careful of the King's Honour and Interest.”<MILESTONE N="40"/>
He professed “to have no Authority for any Thing He proposed, from the
<HI>French</HI> King or any of his Ministers, but from the Queen's Conjectures and
his own Observation: And if the King would give him a Commission, He
would presently return, and would not be known to have any Powers, till
He should find such a Conjuncture to own it, as that the Peace should be
concluded before there should be any Discourse of a Treaty (which He knew
the <HI>French</HI> most desired) lest <HI>Spain</HI> might interpose to perplex or delay it.”
And therefore He proposed, “that He might carry Instructions with him,
upon what Conditions the King would be willing that a Peace should
be established.” His Majesty was resolved never to make the <HI>French</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
King Arbitrator of the Conditions of the Peace, nor that it should be treated
at <HI>Paris;</HI> and most of all, that the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> should not have any
Power to treat, “who,” the King always used to say, “was more a <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="401" REF="407"/>
than an <HI>English</HI> Man:” And He likewise resolved, “that no Overture
should be made towards Peace in his Name.”</P>
<P>WHILST this was in Suspense, the Earl received Letters from <HI>Paris,</HI> in
which He was advised “to return thither with Power to treat, and with In∣formation
what Conditions the King expected; for that his most <HI>Christian</HI>
Majesty had so prepared the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that He should have present Power
to treat and conclude; and so all Things might be settled before the For∣mality
of a Treaty should be entered into or heard of.” This did not
alter the King's Resolution against authorizing the Earl to treat, or making
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Paris</HI> the Place of the Treaty. But because the Letters were written by
<HI>Monsieur Ruvigny,</HI> who was a Person well known to the King, and of whom
He had a good Opinion, and whom He well knew to be too wary a Man
to write in that Manner without having good Authority to do so; his Ma∣jesty
was contented “that the Earl should make Haste to <HI>Paris;</HI> and if He
found by <HI>Ruvigny</HI> that what They proposed was really desired, He should
undertake to know that the King was very well inclined to Peace, and
that himself would willingly confer with any Body He would carry him
to; and whatsoever should be proposed, He would with all possible Ex∣pedition
transmit it to the King:” With this farther Direction, “that if
<MILESTONE N="20"/>He were satisfied that their Intentions were real, which the Alterations in
their own Affairs made probable, He should endeavour, by the Queen or
<HI>Ruvigny,</HI> to discover whether it would not be possible to persuade that
King to treat apart and exclude <HI>Holland;</HI> and if it appeared to him that
was not to be hoped, that at least his Majesty would think it reason∣able,
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> should restore whatsoever Fort or other Place They
had taken upon the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and likewise pay a good Sum of
Money to the King towards the Charge of the War.”</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> had no Mind to return with no larger a Com∣mission,
and pretended to know “that this was not the Way to advance a
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Treaty, and that He could as well write what the King directed, and
know again by Letter what They thought of it; and therefore He would
stay and dispatch the Business which the Queen sent him about, before He
would return.” But when He saw the King was contented He should stay;
rather than have Nothing to do in the Treaty, He chose to be at the Be∣ginning
of it, and thought He should not be afterwards left out; and so
offered the King to depart without farther Delay.</P>
<P>THE King had from the Beginning informed the Chancellor of all that
the Earl had said to him from his Arrival: And when He had received those
Letters from <HI>Ruvigny,</HI> He sent him to shew them to him; and himself came
<MILESTONE N="40"/>presently whilst the Earl was there, and directed him to prepare the Instruc∣tions
for him, which the Earl likewise desired He might do. The Chan∣cellor
very well knew, that his Credit with the King was much lessened,
and that of the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> much increased, who did not like that He
should meddle in the Affairs proper to his Office: Besides He had no Mind
to be intrusted in the Transactions with <HI>France,</HI> of whose Want of Faith
He had too much Experience; which would neither be grateful to the
Queen Mother nor to the Earl. And therefore He very earnestly besought
the King, “that, it being the Lord <HI>Arlington's</HI> Province, all those Dis∣patches
might pass through his Hands.” The King said, “that He knew
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> desired his Help, and that He should prepare all those
Dispatches,” which He required him to do: And the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI>
seemed very much to desire, “that not only his Instructions might be pre∣pared
by him, but that He might always receive his Majesty's Pleasure
<PB N="402" REF="408"/>
signified by him, upon any material Point that should arise;” which the
King promised him He should do. Upon which the other, who durst not
decline those Commands He was so unwilling to obey, humbly desired his
Majesty, “that the whole Matter might be first communicated to that Com∣mittee
of the Council, with which He consulted his most secret Affairs;
and that the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> might be present at the Debate; and that
whatever He should be appointed to put into Writing might be perused
at that Board, and if it required his Majesty's Signature, it should be
presented to him by the Secretary:” All which his Majesty consented to.
And all being done according to what is mentioned before,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns into</HI> France <HI>to negotiate a Peace.</HI></NOTE> the Earl de∣parted<MILESTONE N="10"/>
for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very true, there was yet no visible Alteration in the King's Confi∣dence
towards the Chancellor with Reference to his Business, in which his
Majesty had no Reserve, and spent as much Time with him, and vouchsafed
as often to go to his House, as He had ever used to do. But when He of∣fered
to speak to him of other Matters, as He could not forbear to do, which
He thought concerned him more than his most publick Transactions; He
found his Countenance presently shut, no Attention, and no Answer, or
such a one as shewed He was not pleased: And He took all Occasions to
make others see, that He was advised only by him in what immediately re∣lated<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to his Business, and not more in that than by other Men.</P>
<P>WHEN the Earl came to <HI>Paris,</HI> He found the <HI>French</HI> less upon their
Guard than He expected: And the King himself frankly expressed himself
“to wish an End of this War, and that He might be possessed of the King's
Friendship, which He valued exceedingly;” and referred to <HI>Monsieur
Lionne,</HI> “who” his Majesty said “was prepared to speak to him.” <HI>Mon∣sieur
De Lionne</HI> kept himself within Generals, “of the Benefit that <HI>England</HI>
would receive by a Peace, which made his <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty desire to
promote it, and never more to depart from his Friendship. That He was
obliged in Honour now not to quit the <HI>Dutch,</HI> having entered into a<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Treaty with them when He had no Imagination that there would be a
War between them and <HI>England;</HI> that He had been often sorry for it,
and had given them just Occasion to complain, <HI>that He forbore longer
than He ought to have done to give them Help:</HI> And therefore He could
not now leave them to themselves, except They were obstinate, and re∣fused
to make Peace upon just Conditions; and then He would renounce
them.” But when He found that the Earl had no Power, and that He
talked of Money to be given for the Charge of the War, and expected to have
particular Overtures to send to the King; He brake off the Discourse till
He could confer with his Master.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>WITHIN two or three Days <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> visited the Earl, and
told him, “that if any Thing were to be done towards a Peace, there must
be no Time lost: It was yet in the Power of the most <HI>Christian</HI> King to
bring it to pass upon just and honourable Terms; but He knew not how
long it would continue in his Power; for He confessed the <HI>Dutch</HI> took
themselves to be so much behindhand, that They had no Mind to Peace,
believing They had now Advantage. That it was never heard of, that
after a War between two Nations, upon the making Peace, either Side
consented to pay the Charge of the War: Therefore any Expectation of
that, or but Mention of it, would shut the Door against any Treaty.” He<MILESTONE N="50"/>
gave two Papers to him to send to the King, Both under his own Hand,
which his Majesty had the Choice of, and which the <HI>Dutch</HI> would consent
<PB N="403" REF="409"/>
to; “but if that should be required, the Treaty was at an End before it was
begun, and the Sword must determine it.”</P>
<P>ONE of the Papers contained an Equivalent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Overtures made by</HI> France.</NOTE> of which his Majesty might
make his Choice; whether “all Things should continue in the State and Pos∣ture
in which they were at present, either Side enjoying what They had got
and sustaining what They had lost, and so all Things to remain as they
were before the War;” or, “that a true and just Computation should be
made of the Losses on Both Sides, and They who were found to have re∣ceived
most Damage should be repaired at the Charge of the other.”
<MILESTONE N="10"/>The other Paper was, “that if his Majesty approved of either of these Ex∣pedients,
He should himself make Choice of the Place where the Treaty
should be, whither all Parties should send their Ambassadours:” But then
the <HI>French</HI> King desired, “that his Majesty would not make Choice of any
Place in the King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Dominions;” and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour
there had nominated <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Francfort</HI> or <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> And the Earl of
<HI>St. Albans</HI> immediately sent away an Express with those two Papers to the
King, upon Receipt whereof the Council were summoned.</P>
<P>THERE was no Hope of Money, which some, not reasonably, had expected
should be paid whenever a Peace should be made; and it had been men∣tioned
<MILESTONE N="20"/>in <HI>Holland</HI> as a Thing They expected should be propounded, it
may be, that it might be propounded and rejected. Then the Dispatch
of whatsoever should be agreed concerned the King very much, that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> might not put to Sea, nor discover that the King had no Fleet to
set out; for the Spring was not yet come, though approaching. There ap∣peared
little Difficulty in the Choice of the Equivalent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the King approves.</NOTE> for the <HI>English</HI> had
taken much more from the <HI>Dutch</HI> than They had taken from <HI>England;</HI> and
the other Computation would be endless, and liable to very difficult Exa∣minations:
So that by an unanimous Advice the King resolved to choose the
first Equivalent.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>BUT then the Place for the Treaty was not so easy to be chosen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulties about settling the Place for the Treaty.</NOTE> The
most natural had been <HI>Brussels, Antwerp,</HI> or some other large City in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
which were all neutral Places, and to which all Parties might repair
with the same Ease and Security. Whereas all the Places mentioned in <HI>Ger∣many</HI>
were at so great a Distance, that the Summer would be far entered
into, and so, many Acts of Hostility pass, before the Ambassadours could meet;
and the <HI>English</HI> must pass through the Enemy's Country thither: Therefore
there could be no Thought of any of those Places. Then the King of
<HI>France</HI> had taken upon him to exclude <HI>Flanders,</HI> which He had no Power
to do, and it was as desirable to the <HI>Dutch</HI> as to the King: And therefore
<MILESTONE N="40"/>it was thought reasonable, that the King should insist upon some good Town
there, of which there was Choice enough; and if <HI>Holland</HI> should approve
it <HI>France</HI> could not reject it. But on the other Hand it was clearly dis∣cerned,
that <HI>France</HI> would never send Ambassadours into a Country which
He meant at the same Time to invade; and that his Majesty knew very well
to be the Intention, and the Ground of that King's desiring the Peace, which
it was plain enough the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not desire, and were only drawn to con∣sent
to a Treaty by the positive Demand of <HI>France,</HI> which They durst not
contradict: And therefore it concerned the King to preserve that good Dis∣position,
and that the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours might come fully instructed to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>conour with the <HI>English</HI> in what should be just, and prevent any insolent
Carriage of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or the <HI>Dans,</HI> who was likewise to have his Ambas∣sadours
upon the Place.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="410"/>
UPON those Reasons the Express returned with his Majesty's Consent and
Election of the first Equivalent, and “that as soon as He should know that
the <HI>Dutch</HI> had consented to it, his Majesty would propose some equal Place
for the Treaty.” And as soon as the Express was dispatched, his Ma∣jesty
entered upon the Debate of a fit Place for the Treaty; and said,
“that He had a Proposition then made to him by Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI>
that was of such a Nature as much surprised him, as He believed it would
the Lords; yet He had not thought enough to dislike or condemn it:”
And so bade the other to propose it. He, with some short Apology which
He did not use to make, said, “that He perceived there would be little less<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Difficulty in agreeing upon a Place for the Treaty than upon any Doubts
which might arise in it; for if the King of <HI>France</HI> was to be gratified in
the Exclusion of <HI>Flanders,</HI> it would be very inconvenient to oblige the
King to send into <HI>Germany,</HI> which by the great Delay would deprive the
King of the greatest Benefit He expected from the Treaty; the speedy
Dispatch whereof would be attended with the greatest Conveniences:
Therefore He had proposed to the King, <HI>that He would immediately write
to the</HI> States General <HI>without acquainting</HI> France <HI>with it, and offer to send
his Ambassadours to treat the Peace at the</HI> Hague, <HI>that it might be speedily
concluded, which would otherwise take up much Time in sending for any Re∣solution<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to the</HI> States <HI>upon what should arise. If They consented to it, it would
probably be attended with Success, the general Affection of the People being
well known to desire Peace: And if They refused it, the World would con∣clude
that They would have no Peace, when They would not treat about it;
and that his Majesty would never have done them the Honour to have sent
his Ambassadours Home to them, if He had intended to deny any Thing that
was reasonable to them.</HI>”</P>
<P>IT was very new, and thought of by Nobody but the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and
Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> who had communicated it together; and the Objec∣tion
of the Condescension that it would seem to most Men, as if the King<MILESTONE N="30"/>
sent to beg a Peace at their own Doors, was obvious to all Men: But that
would have been an Objection against admitting it to have been at <HI>Paris.</HI>
But the <HI>States</HI> not being upon any Level that pretended to an Equality, the
probable Convenience or Benefit that might attend it was only to be consi∣dered;
and the Affection and Desire of the People generally to Peace was
so notorious, that there was Reason to believe that They would not be wil∣ling
that a Treaty begun amongst them should end but with Effect: And
therefore it was unanimously agreed, that the Advice should be pursued.
But then it was a new Doubt, how the Message or Overture or Letter,
for the Form was not yet thought of, should be conveyed; for the sending<MILESTONE N="40"/>
a Trumpet or Express had much more of Application than the Thing itself:
And it was to be wished, that it might be gone out of the King's Hands
before the Answer could come from <HI>Paris,</HI> lest new Instance should be made
for a particular Place.</P>
<P>IT was at last resolved, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> Ambassadours (both <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Holland</HI> having accepted the Mediation of that Crown) should be consulted
with, to engage their Minister at the <HI>Hague</HI> to deliver it to the <HI>States Ge∣neral;</HI>
for there was some Apprehension, that if <HI>De Wit</HI> knew of it, it
might be considered only by that Committee which was deputed for that
Affair, and never be brought to the <HI>States:</HI> And the adjusting all that<MILESTONE N="50"/>
was commended to the Chancellor, who presently sent for the Ambassa∣dours,
and found them very ready to perform any Office which might
<PB N="405" REF="411"/>
bring them upon the Stage in the Treaty. And upon Communication to∣gether,
They were willing to send a Servant of their own to the <HI>Hague,</HI>
who should deliver to their Ambassadour the King's Message to the <HI>States
General,</HI> as an Effect of their Mediation and Credit with the King. And
so it was delivered, not in the Form of a Letter, but of a Message in the
third Person to the <HI>States General,</HI> signed by the King and under the Signet;
and the Ambassadours sent a Gentleman in Post with it.</P>
<P>BUT within two Days a new Alarm comes from <HI>France;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>refuse to re∣store</HI> Pole∣roone <HI>accord∣ing to the O∣vertures.</HI></NOTE> and all that
was done proved to be to no Purpose. When They received the King's An∣swer,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>They could not but acknowledge that it was as fair as They could
expect; and <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> shewed it as such to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassa∣dour,
who finding that He was satisfied with it, and by him, that the
King was so too, fell into much Passion, and declared “that it was not
according to the Consent He had given to the King and to <HI>Monsieur
De Lionne;</HI> and that He must protest against any Treaty to be entered
into upon this Declaration.” He put him then in Mind, “that He had
informed the King, in his Presence, <HI>that there was an Article in the late
Treaty between</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Holland, <HI>by which They were obliged to deli∣ver
up the Island of</HI> Poleroone <HI>in the</HI> East-Indies <HI>to the</HI> East-India <HI>Company
<MILESTONE N="20"/>of</HI> London, <HI>which They had formerly consented to with</HI> Cromwell, <HI>but had
neither delivered it then nor yet, and were resolved rather to continue the
War than to part with it;</HI> which He had declared, when with Reference
to all other Things He consented to the Alternative: And if the King
would not release that Article of the former Treaty, his Masters would
not enter upon any new.”</P>
<P>WHETHER this was true or no cannot be known. But <HI>Monsieur De
Lionne</HI> came in great Disorder to the Lord of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> and told him all
that the Ambassadour had said, and confessed it “to be very true, and that
the King remembered it well, and promised that Article should be re∣leased:
<MILESTONE N="30"/>But that He, not clearly understanding the Delivery of it to be
contained in a former Treaty, and knowing it had been many Years in
the Possession of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that it still remained so, thought it had
been comprehended in the Alternative, and forgat to insert it in the
Paper that was sent to the King, for which He asked a thousand Pardons;
and made it his Suit to the King that He would yield to it, and that a
Treaty that was so necessary to the Good of <HI>Christendom</HI> might not be
extinguished upon his Negligence and Want of Memory;” which was a
strange Excuse for a Minister of his known Sagacity.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> refused to transmit any such Tergiversation to the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>King, and said, “He knew the King would never consent to it; and that
this Manner of Proceeding, after that his Majesty had consented to what
themselves proposed, would shut out all future Confidence of their Sin∣cerity.”
<HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> was exceedingly troubled and out of Coun∣tenance,
as a Man conscious to himself of a great Oversight, and desired him, “
that He would meet the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour at his Lodging, that They
might together endeavour to remove him from the Obstinacy He pro∣fessed;”
which the Earl was contented to do, and the Ambassadour, how
unwillingly soever, was prevailed with to meet at the Time appointed: But
They were no sooner met, and <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> entered upon the Argu∣ment
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> but the Ambassadour fell into a rude Passion, and said,“
the War should determine it.” And when the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> began
to speak of the Unreasonableness of the Demand, and entered upon the soul
Manner in which They had first taken that Island from the <HI>English,</HI> who
<PB N="406" REF="412"/>
were in Possession of it; He told him, “that He had Nothing to say to
him,” and used much other Language unfit for the other to hear, and
which He had returned with Interest, if <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> had not inter∣posed,
and been very desirous the Conference should end, the Ambassadour's
Insolence being not to be endured: And so They parted, <HI>Lionne</HI> seeming
very much offended; and He complained to the King, and the Earl gave
the Account of all to his Majesty.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> King was no less surprised and offended when He heard what
Message the King had sent to the <HI>States</HI> (which He was advertised of by an
Express from <HI>Holland),</HI> than <HI>De Wit</HI> had been at the Delivery of it, who<MILESTONE N="10"/>
presently knew the Drist of it, and could not forbear to tell the <HI>States,</HI>
“that the Design was only to stir up the People against the Magistrates,
and indeed to make them the Judges of the Conditions of the Peace:”
And He knew well that the People generally were no Friends to the <HI>East∣India</HI>
Company (where himself had a great Stock), and therefore would ne∣ver
consent that a Treaty entered into should break only upon their Interest;
which likewise was the Reason, why They had provided that that Particu∣lar
should be first consented to, before any Treaty should be agreed upon.
And hereupon He prevailed upon the <HI>States General</HI> forthwith to declare in
the Negative, “that the Treaty should not be at the <HI>Hague.</HI>” But at the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
same Time, after the naming again of <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Francfort,</HI> They added,“
that if the King desired to do them the Honour to appoint it in any Place
of their Dominions, which They did not presume to propose; They should
consent that it might be at <HI>Breda,</HI> or <HI>Maestricht,</HI>” or a Place or two that
They named: And this was resolved before the People heard that the King
had named the <HI>Hague,</HI> and wondered and murmured at their Refusal.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>France</HI> took it ill, that at a Time when He proceeded with
so much Openness, and had given the first Rise to a Treaty, and opened
the Door which the <HI>Hollander</HI> peevishly shut against it, by his own offer∣ing
the Alternative, which the King had so far approved as to make his<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Election; He should at the same Time, without communicating it to him,
send this Overture to the <HI>Hague:</HI> Which troubled him the more, that it
gave him Matter of Jealousy to apprehend, that there was some other un∣derhand
Treaty that was concealed from him, and contrived by the Baron
of <HI>Isola,</HI> who He knew had been privately at the <HI>Hague</HI> and had Con∣ference
with <HI>De Wit.</HI> And the same Imagination did more perplex the
Queen Mother and the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> who looked upon this as a De∣vice
to exclude them from having any Share in the Peace; the Earl having
digested the Conclusion in his own Breast, that in what Place soever the
Treaty should be held, He should without Doubt be intrusted in the Ma∣nagery<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of it. However the King could not own his Part of the Dislike,
since his Majesty might without any Violation of Friendship make the Over∣ture
by Message to the <HI>Hague,</HI> as well as to or by him: Therefore He
seemed to take no Exception to it, and only sent the King Word, “that He
believed the <HI>Dutch</HI> would quickly discern, that this Condescension in his
Majesty proceeded from some Expectation of a Party amongst the People
to second it; and therefore He was confident They would never consent
to treat at the <HI>Hague.</HI>” But He proposed, “as the best Way for Expe∣dition,
that it might be at <HI>Dover,</HI>” which He advised his Majesty not to
reject: “For if it were once begun there, it might possibly, and He would<MILESTONE N="50"/>
further it all He could, quickly be removed to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and probably
might be concluded in <HI>London.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="413"/>
BUT before this Message arrived, the other new Demand of <HI>Poleroone,</HI>
with <HI>Monsieur De Lionne's</HI> Acknowledgement of the Defect of his Memory,
and that He ought to have inserted it in the Paper that contained the
Alternative, with all the Excuses He made for it, was received; which
seemed to put an End to all Hopes of Peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King high∣ly offend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> The King was highly in∣censed,
and looked upon it as an Affront contrived by Both Parties to amuse
him. Every Body concluded, that there could be no Safety in depending
upon any Thing that could be offered from <HI>France,</HI> when They could never
be without as reasonable a Pretence as They had at present, to disclaim or
<MILESTONE N="10"/>avoid any Concession They had made in Writing. That the Particular de∣manded
could never be consented to by his Majesty, without swerving from
the common Rules of Justice, and the Violation of his own Honour. That
though it did not immediately concern his Majesty in his own Interest and
the Interest of the Crown, which was an Argument used in <HI>France</HI> for his
Majesty's not insisting upon it, it was however an unquestionable and a very
considerable Interest of his Subjects, which He was in Justice bound to
maintain, and which in Justice He had no Power to release. It was an In∣terest
so valuable, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had insisted upon it so resolutely, that
They had consented to it as a principal Article of the Peace He made with
<MILESTONE N="20"/>them; by which He gained great Reputation with the People. And
his Majesty had thought himself so much concerned in Honour not to suffer
his Subjects to be deprived of that Right which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had vindicated
(though by his Death it came not to be executed), that He would never con∣sent
to the Treaty that had been concluded since his happy Return, until
They consented to and renewed the same Article, and promised the Rede∣livery
of the said Island to the <HI>English</HI> by such a Day: And their having
broken their Faith in not delivering it according to the last Treaty, and with
very offensive Circumstances, his Majesty had declared to be a principal
Cause of the War, and made them unquestionably to appear the first Ag∣gressor.
<MILESTONE N="30"/>And in that Respect, his Honour could not receive a more mor∣tal
Wound than in releasing that Article, which concerned the Estates of
other Men, and would in the Opinion of the World draw the Guilt of the
War upon himself, or, which would be as bad, the Reproach of having
purchased a Peace upon very dishonourable Conditions to himself, at the
Charge and with the Estates of his Subjects.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And resolves to continue the War.</NOTE> the King resolved rather to undergo the Hazard of the
War upon what Disadvantage soever, than to consent to a Proposition so
dishonourable: And a Dispatch was presently sent to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI>
with a very lively Resentment “of the Indignity offered to the King, in
<MILESTONE N="40"/>receding from what was offered by themselves, and in asking what He was
resolved never to grant.” And all were enjoined to review all that had
been resolved for the War, and to give the utmost Advancement to it that
was possible: And without Doubt, if <HI>Spain</HI> had yet put itself into any Pos∣ture
to defend itself against the Power that was even ready to invade it, and
to act any Part towards the Support of a common Interest; the King would
hardly have been persuaded to have hearkened more to any Propositions
from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, new Overtures and new Importunities were
sent from <HI>France.</HI> “It was true,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New Over∣tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from</HI> France</NOTE> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had always protested
<MILESTONE N="50"/>against making a Peace or consenting to a Treaty without the Release
of <HI>Poleroone;</HI> which his <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty had consented to, and could
not recede from it without their Consent, though the Mention of it had
been unfortunately omitted by <HI>Monsieur De Lionne:</HI> But his Majesty pro∣mised
<PB N="408" REF="414"/>
and engaged his Royal Word, that when the Treaty should be en∣tered
into, He would use all his Credit and Authority to persuade the
<HI>States General</HI> to recede from their Obstinacy, and to make no Alteration in
the last Treaty; but that all Things should remain as had been settled by it.
And if He could not prevail with them to satisfy him therein, as He did
fear that there was upon their particular Interest some peremptory Resolu∣tion
fixed, from whence They would not be removed as to the Main; yet
in that Case He did in no Degree despair of obliging them to give a con∣siderable
Sum of Money for Recompense thereof, which He desired might
satisfy the King, who would find himself at much Ease by it. And if<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the Commissioners once met and the Treaty was begun, it would not be
dissolved before a Peace should be concluded; and that the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassadours,
as soon as They met, should propose a Cessation from all Acts
of Hostility, which He expected should be as soon yielded to as proposed;
and that already They had promised <HI>that their Fleet should remain in their
Harbours till the Middle of</HI> May, before which Time the Treaty might
well begin.” And from the present Time the <HI>French</HI> King promised,
that no hostile Act should be done by him, and that his own Fleet should
not stir out of their Port; and that his Ambassadours should in all
Things behave themselves as his Majesty could wish, that Particular only<MILESTONE N="20"/>
of <HI>Poleroone</HI> excepted, in which They should do as He had promised.”</P>
<P>THE King had by this Time had Recourse to all the Inventions and De∣vices,
which might yet enable him to set out a Fleet that might be able to
fight the Enemy; but in vain. He found all Men of the same Opinion
They had been, that He must be upon the Defensive in the Manner ex∣pressed
before, and expect the End of the Summer before He could draw
his Ships together; and that there was an universal Impatience for Peace:
So that when the Warmth of his Indignation was a little remitted, He was
very willing to hear any Thing that might revive the Hope of a Treaty,
when this last Overture from <HI>Paris</HI> arrived; upon which He presently con∣vened<MILESTONE N="30"/>
the Council, that He might take a speedy Resolution what He was
to do, for He saw many Conveniences might be lost by the not speedily en∣tering
upon the Treaty, if it were to be entered upon at all. The Protes∣tation
and Promise of <HI>France</HI> to assist in all Things, that Particular only ex∣cepted,
for his Majesty's Service, and his Promise even in that, made him
willing to believe that they might be real: The Hope of Recompense for
it seemed little inferiour to the Redelivery of the Island, and was an equal
Satisfaction to his Majesty's Honour. And it seemed the more probable to
be compassed, in that <HI>De Wit</HI> in his private Conference with the Baron of
<HI>Isola,</HI> in all his Passion in which He would not endure the Mention of the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Delivery of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> and said, “that the <HI>States</HI> would perish before They
would part with it,” concluded, “that He would not say that They might
not be persuaded to give some Recompense for it.”</P>
<P>AND many believed that the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, which was only con∣cerned
in the Interest of it, would choose rather to receive a good Recom∣pense
than the Island itself, which was a barren, sandy Soil, which yielded
no Fruit, but only Nutmegs, which was the sole Commodity it bore, and
is a Commodity of great Value. But when They were bound to give it up
to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> there had been immediate Order sent to cut down all the
Trees upon the Island; which Order would be now again repeated: And<MILESTONE N="50"/>
so no less than seven Years must expire before any Fruit could be expected
from thence. And it was so far from any <HI>English</HI> Factory, and so near to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that They would easily possess themselves of it again when They
<PB N="409" REF="415"/>
had a Mind to it. And therefore if the Company might have Money, or
such a Quantity of Nutmegs delivered to them, as might, besides being
enough for the Expense of <HI>England,</HI> bear a Part in the foreign Trade (which
had been mentioned by some Merchants of that Company), it might be rea∣sonably
preferable to the Island.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER Resolution should in the End be taken, this Expedient of
Recompense gave a Hint to a Counsel that had not been yet thought of,
which was to leave the Business of <HI>Poleroone</HI> to the sole Managery of the
<HI>East-India</HI> Company, who should be advised to choose some Members of
<MILESTONE N="10"/>their own, who should go over with the Ambassadours, and receive all Ad∣vice
and Assistance from them in the Conduct of their Pretence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: And They
would be the Witnesses of what the King insisted upon on their Behalf; and
would likewise judge, if Nothing prevented the Peace but that Interest, how
far it should be insisted on.</P>
<P>THE <HI>East-India</HI> Company was sent for,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> East In∣dia <HI>Company consulted in Relation to</HI> Poleroone</NOTE> and were told “that the King
had Hope of a Treaty for Peace, which He presumed would be welcome
to them: He heard that the greatest Difficulty and Obstruction that was
like to arise would be concerning their Interest in the Island of <HI>Poleroone,</HI>
which He was resolved never to abandon. But because He heard likewise
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that the <HI>Dutch</HI> did intend to offer a Recompense rather than to restore
the Place, and that the Recompense might be such as might be as agreeable
to them (of which He would not take upon him to judge, but leave it
entirely to themselves), He had given them this timely Notice of it, that
They might bethink themselves what was fit for them to do, upon a Pros∣pect
of all that might probably occur; and that They might make Choice
of such Persons amongst themselves, who best understood their Affairs, to
the End that when the Treaty should be agreed upon and the Place ap∣pointed,
and his Majesty had resolved what Ambassadours He would send
(of all which They should have seasonable Notice), those Persons elected
<MILESTONE N="30"/>by them as their Commissioners might go over with the Ambassadours;
that when that Point came into Debate, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> should call some
of their <HI>East-India</HI> Company to inform them, They likewise might be
ready to advertise his Ambassadours of whatsoever might advance their
Pretences: And if a Recompense was to be considered, They might enter
into that Consultation with the other Deputies; and that They should be
sure to receive all the Advice and Assistance from his Ambassadours, that
They could require or stand in Need of.” The Company received this
Information from his Majesty with all Demonstration of Duty and Submis∣sion,
giving humble Thanks for his Majesty's Bounty and Care of their
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Interest; and said, “They would not fail to make Choice of a Commit∣tee
to attend the Ambassadours, when They should know it would be
seasonable.”</P>
<P>THE King thought it now Time to receive the Advice of his whole Coun∣cil-Board
upon this Affair,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King con∣sults the Privy Council upon the Overtures made by</HI> France.</NOTE> which had been hitherto only debated before the
Committee for foreign Affairs: And so They being assembled, an Account
was given of all that had passed, with all its Circumstances, in <HI>France,</HI>
and in <HI>Holland</HI> by the Baron of <HI>Isola</HI> and by the <HI>Swedes</HI> Ambassadours. And
his Majesty said thereupon, “that He had yet taken no Resolution, and had
been so provoked by the Miscarriage of <HI>France,</HI> that He would have been
<MILESTONE N="50"/>glad to have put himself into a better Posture, and not thought farther of
a Treaty, till there should appear a more favourable Conjuncture: But
They now understood as much as He did with Reference to the State
<PB N="410" REF="416"/>
He was in both at Home and abroad, and that He was resolved to follow
their Advice.”</P>
<P>ALL the Objections which had been foreseen before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which advises him to enter upon the Treaty.</NOTE> and the Considera∣tions
thereupon, were renewed and again debated: And in the End there
was a general Concurrence, “that his Majesty should embrace the Oppor∣tunity
of a Treaty; and if a reasonable Peace could be obtained, it would
be very grateful to the whole Kingdom, that was weary of the War;
and that his Majesty should lose no Time in returning such a Dispatch to
<HI>Paris,</HI> as might bring on the Treaty.” And some of the Lords pro∣ceeded
so far as to declare, “that the Consideration of <HI>Poleroone</HI> was not of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
that Importance, nor could be thought so by the <HI>East-India</HI> Company
themselves, as that the insisting upon it should deprive the Kingdom of
a Peace that was so necessary for it.” But the King thought the entering
upon that Argument was not yet seasonable: But He gave Order for the
Dispatch to be prepared for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were two material Points not yet determined, the first of which
was fit to be inserted into the present Dispatch; which was the Nomination
of the Place where the Treaty should be. Some were of Opinion, “that
his Majesty should lay Hold of the Overture that had been made from
<HI>France,</HI> which was since likewise confirmed by <HI>Holland, that the Treaty<MILESTONE N="20"/>
should be at</HI> Dover:” But They changed their Minds, when They well
considered that the same Objections would be naturally made against <HI>Dover</HI>
on the King's Behalf, that had been made by the <HI>Dutch</HI> against the <HI>Hague;</HI>
and that the People there, and less at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> were not incapable of any
Impressions, which the numerous Trains of the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> would
be ready to imprint in them. In a Word; there was much more fit to be
considered upon that Point, than is fit to be remembered. The Conclusion
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breda <HI>agreed to be the Place of treating.</HI></NOTE> “that <HI>Breda,</HI> which had been offered by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> should be the
Place the King would accept;” which was added to the Dispatch for
<HI>Paris,</HI> and presently sent away.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE other Matter undetermined of was the Choice of Ambassadours,
which had been never entered upon. The King had spoken with the Chan∣cellor,
what Persons would be fit to be employed in that Negotiation, when
the Time should be ripe for it; and took Notice, as He did frequently, of
the small Choice He had of Men well acquainted with Business of that
Nature: Upon which He had named to the King the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> who had
been lately Ambassadour in <HI>France,</HI> and was in all Respects equal to any
Business, and Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI> of his Bedchamber, who had shewed so
great Abilities in his late Negotiation in <HI>Sweden.</HI> Upon the naming of whom
his Majesty said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Hollis <HI>and Mr.</HI> Hen∣ry Coventry <HI>appointed Ple∣nipotentiaries.</HI></NOTE> “They were Both very fit, and that He would think of<MILESTONE N="40"/>
no other:” So that when all other Particulars were adjusted with Refe∣rence
to the Treaty, the King, without farther consulting it, declared,
“that He intended to send those two his Ambassadours for the Treaty,”
before either of them knew or thought of the Employment. And when his
Majesty told them of it, He bade them repair to the Chancellor for their
Instructions. And this gave new Thoughts of Heart to the Lord <HI>Arling∣ton,</HI>
who had designed himself and Sir <HI>Thomas Clifford,</HI> who was newly
made a Privy Counsellor and Controller of the Houshold upon the Death
of Sir <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> for the Performance of that Service; and thought him∣self
the better qualified for it by his late Alliance in <HI>Holland,</HI> by his Mar∣riage<MILESTONE N="50"/>
with the Daughter of <HI>Monsieur Beverwaert,</HI> a natural Son of Prince
<HI>Maurice.</HI> And this Disappointment went very near him; though the other
had not the least Thought that He had any such Thing in his Heart, but
<PB N="411" REF="417"/>
advised it purely as They were the fittest Persons who could be thought of;
and their Abilities, which were well thought of before, were very notorious
in this Negotiation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedish</HI> Ambassadours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Swedish <HI>Ambassadours Mediators.</HI></NOTE> who were the only Mediators, prepared
likewise to go to the Treaty, having agreed with the King, “that if the
Treaty should not produce a Peace,” of which They who hoped most
were not confident, “that Crown would immediately declare for the King,
and unite itself to his Interest both against the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>French;</HI>”
their Army at that Time, being held the best in <HI>Europe,</HI> under the Com∣mand
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of their General <HI>Wrangel,</HI> being near the <HI>States</HI> Dominions. And
for the better confirming them in that Disposition, the Chancellor had
brought the Baron of <HI>Isola</HI> to a Conference with the <HI>Swedes</HI> Ambassadours,
and begun that Treaty between them which was shortly after finished, and
known by the Style of the <HI>Triple Alliance,</HI> that was the first Act that de∣tached
the <HI>Swede</HI> from <HI>France:</HI> And for the present the King himself found
Means to supply the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> with a Sum of Money for the Sup∣port
of their Army.</P>
<P>ALL Things being thus adjusted, and the Place of the Treaty being on
all Hands agreed to be <HI>Breda,</HI> and Notice being sent from <HI>Paris,</HI> “that their
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Ambassadours were departed from thence;” the King thought himself as
much concerned in the Expedition in Respect of the Cessation, which the <HI>French</HI>
promised to obtain in the very Entrance into the Treaty; and it was now the
Month of <HI>May.</HI> And so his Ambassadours were dispatched, and arrived
there before the Middle of that Month, with an Equipage worthy their Mas∣ter
who sent them.</P>
<P>THERE happened at this Time an Accident that made a fatal Breach into
the Chancellor's Fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Earl of</HI> Southampton.</NOTE> with a Gap wide enough to let in all that Ruin
which soon after was poured upon him. The Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> the Trea∣surer,
with whom He had an entire fast Friendship, and who, when They
<MILESTONE N="30"/>were together, had Credit enough with the King and at the Board to pre∣vent,
at least to defer, any very unreasonable Resolution, was now ready
to expire with the Stone; a Disease that had kept him in great Pain many
Months, and for which He had sent to <HI>Paris</HI> for a Surgeon to be cut, but
had deferred it too long by the Physicians not agreeing what the Disease
was: So that at last He grew too weak to apply that Remedy. They who
had with so much Industry, and as They thought Certainty, prevailed with
the King at <HI>Oxford</HI> to have removed him from that Office, had never since
intermitted the pursuing the Design, and persuaded his Majesty, “that his
Service had suffered exceedingly by his receding from his Purpose;” and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>did not think their Triumph notorious enough, if They suffered him to die
in the Office: Insomuch as when He grew so weak that it is true He could
not sign any Orders with his Hand, which was four or five Days before his
Death, They had again persuaded the King to send for the Staff. But the
Chancellor again prevailed with him not to do so ungracious an Act to a
Servant who had served him and his Father so long and so eminently, to so
little Purpose as the ravishing an Office unseasonably, which must within
five or fix Days fall into his Hands; as it did within less Time by his
Death.</P>
<P>HE was a Person of extraordinary Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> of Faculties very discerning and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Judgment very profound, great Eloquence in his Delivery, without the
least Affectation of Words, for He always spake best on the sudden. In
the Beginning of the Troubles, He was looked upon amongst those Lords
who were least inclined to the Court, and so most acceptable to the Peo∣ple:
<PB N="412" REF="418"/>
He was in Truth not obliged by the Court, and thought himself op∣pressed
by it, which his great Spirit could not bear; and so He had for
some Years forbore to be much seen there, which was imputed to a Habit
of Melancholy, to which He was naturally inclined, though it appeared
more in his Countenance than in his Conversation, which to those with
whom He was acquainted was very cheerful.</P>
<P>THE great Friendship that had been between their Fathers made many
believe, that there was a Confidence between the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> and him;
which was true to that Degree as could be between Men of so different Na∣tures
and Understandings. And when They came to the Parliament in the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Year 1640, They appeared Both unsatisfied with the Prudence and Politicks
of the Court, and were not reserved in declaring it, when the great Offi∣cers
were called in Question for great Transgressions in their several Admi∣nistrations:
But in the Prosecution there was great Difference in their Pas∣sions
and their Ends. The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was a great Lover of Justice, and
could not have been tempted to consent to the Oppression of an innocent
Man: But in the discerning the several Species of Guilt, and in the propor∣tioning
the Degrees of Punishment to the Degree of Guilt, He had no Fa∣culties
or Measure of judging; nor was above the Temptation of general Pre∣judice,
and it may be of particular Disobligations and Resentments, which<MILESTONE N="20"/>
proceeded from the Weakness of his Judgment, not the Malice of his Na∣ture.
The Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> was not only an exact Observer of Justice,
but so clearsighted a Discerner of all the Circumstances which might dis∣guise
it, that no false or fraudulent Colour could impose upon him; and of
so sincere and impartial a Judgment, that no Prejudice to the Person of any
Man made him less awake to his Cause; but believed that there is <HI>aliquid
et in Hostem Nefas,</HI> and that a very ill Man might be very unjustly
dealt with.</P>
<P>THIS Difference of Faculties divided them quickly in the Progress of those
Businesses, in the Beginning whereof They were Both of one Mind. They<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Both thought the Crown had committed great Excesses in the Exercise of
its Power, which the one thought could not be otherwise prevented, than by
its being deprived of it: The Consequence whereof the other too well un∣derstood,
and that the absolute taking away that Power that might do Hurt,
would likewise take away some of that which was necessary for the doing
Good; and that a Monarch cannot be deprived of a fundamental Right,
without such a lasting Wound to Monarchy itself, that They who have most
Shelter from it and stand nearest to it, the Nobility, could not continue long
in their native Strength, if the Crown received a Maim. Which if the Earl
of <HI>Essex</HI> had comprehended, who set as great a Price upon Nobility as any<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Man living did, He could never have been wrought upon to have contri∣buted
to his own Undoing; which the other knew was unavoidable, if the
King were undone. So They were Both satisfied that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>
had countenanced some high Proceedings, which could not be supported by
any Rules of Justice, though the Policy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the constant Course
observed in the Government of that Kingdom, might have excused and jus∣tified
many of the high Proceedings with which He was reproached: And
They who had now the Advantage-Ground, by being thought to be most
solicitous for the Liberty of the Subject, and most vigilant that the same
Outrages might not be transplanted out of the other Kingdom into this,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
looked upon him as having the strongest Influence upon the Counsels of
<HI>England</HI> as well as Governour of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Then He had declared himself
so averse and irreconcilable to the Sedition and Rebellion of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>
the whole Nation had contracted so great an Animosity against him, that
less than his Life could not secure them from the Fears They had conceived
of him: And this Fury of theirs met with a full Concurrence from those of
the <HI>English,</HI> who could not compass their own Ends without their Help.
And this Combination too soon drew the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who had none of
their Ends, into their Party, to satisfy his Pride and his Passion, in removing
a Man who seemed to have no Regard for him; for the Stories, which were
then made of Disobligations from the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> towards the Earl of
<HI>Clanrickard,</HI> were without any Foundation of Truth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THE Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who had Nothing of Obligation, and Some∣what
of Prejudice to some high Acts of Power which had been exercised by
the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> was not unwilling that they should be so far looked
into and examined, as might raise more Caution and Apprehension in Men
of great Authority of the Consequence of such Excesses. But when He dis∣cerned
irregular Ways entered into to punish those Irregularities, and which
might be attended with as ill Consequences, and that They intended to
compound one great Crime out of several smaller Trespasses, and, to use
their own Style, <HI>to complicate a Treason out of Misdemeanors,</HI> and so to take
away his Life for what He might be fined and imprisoned; He first dissuaded
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and then abhorred that Exorbitance, and more abhorred it, when He found
it passionately and maliciously resolved by a direct Combination.</P>
<P>FROM this Time He and the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> were perfectly divided and se∣parated,
and seldom afterwards concurred in the same Opinion: But as He
worthily and bravely stood in the Gap in the Defence of that great Man's
Life, so He did afterwards oppose all those Invasions, which were every
Day made by the House of Commons upon the Rights of the Crown, or
the Privileges of the Peers, which the Lords were willing to sacrifice to the
useful Humour of the other. And by this Means, whilst most of the
King's Servants listed themselves with the Conspirators in promoting all
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Things which were ingrateful to him, this Lord, who had no Relation to
his Service, was looked upon as a Courtier; and by the Strength of his Rea∣son
gave such a Check to their Proceedings, that He became little less odious
to them than the Court itself; and so much the more odious, because as
He was superiour to their Temptations, so his unquestionable Integrity was
out of their Reach, and made him contemn their Power as much as their
Malice.</P>
<P>HE had all the Detestation imaginable of the civil War, and discerned
the dismal Effects it would produce, more than most other Men, which
made him do all He could to prevent it. But when it could not be avoided,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>He made no Scruple how to dispose of himself, but frankly declared for
the King, who had a just Sense of the Service He had done him, and made
him then both of his Privy Council and Gentleman of his Bedchamber,
without the least Application or Desire of his, and when most of those who
were under Both those Relations had chosen, as the much stronger, the Re∣bels
Side: And his receiving those Obligations at that present was known
to proceed more from his Duty than his Ambition. He had all the Fidelity
that God requires, and all the Affection to the Person of the King that his
Duty suggested to him was due, without any Reverence for or Compliance
with his Infirmities or Weakness; which made him many Times uneasy to
<MILESTONE N="50"/>the King, especially in all Consultations towards Peace, in which He was
always desirous that his Majesty should yield more than He was inclined
to do.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="420"/>
HE was in his Nature melancholick, and reserved in his Conversation,
except towards those with whom He was very well acquainted; with whom
He was not only cheerful, but upon Occasion light and pleasant. He was
naturally lazy, and indulged overmuch Ease to himself: Yet as no Man
had a quicker Apprehension or solider Judgment in Business of all Kinds,
so, when it had a hopeful Prospect, no Man could keep his Mind longer
bent, and take more Pains in it. In the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> which was a
continued Fatigue of twenty Days, He never slept four Hours in a Night, who
had never used to allow himself less than ten, and at the End of the Treaty
was much more vigorous than in the Beginning; which made the Chan∣cellor<MILESTONE N="10"/>
to tell the King when They returned to <HI>Oxford,</HI> “that if He would
have the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> in good Health and good Humour, He must
give him good Store of Business to do.”</P>
<P>HIS Person was of a small Stature; his Courage, as all his other
Faculties, very great; having no Sign of Fear or Sense of Danger, when
He was in a Place where He ought to be found. When the King
had withdrawn himself from <HI>Oxford</HI> in Order to his Escape to the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Army, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> had brought his Army before the Town; in some De∣bate
at the Council-Board, there being some Mention of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with
Reference to his Dignity in a large Degree above all of the Nobility, the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who never used to speak indecently, used some Expres∣sions,
which, being unfaithfully reported to the Prince, his Highness inter∣preted
to be disrespectful towards him: Whereupon He sent the Lord <HI>Ge∣rard</HI>
to expostulate with him. To whom the Earl without any Apology
related the Words He had used; which being reported by him again to the
Prince, though they were not the same which He had been informed, yet
He was not so well satisfied with them, but that He sent the same Lord to
him again to tell him, “that his Highness expected other Satisfaction from
him, and expected to meet him with his Sword in his Hand, and desired
it might be as soon as He could, lest it might be prevented.”<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE Earl appointed the next Morning, at a Place well known; and
being asked “what Weapon He chose,” He said, “that He had no Horse
fit for such a Service, nor knew where suddenly to get one; and that He
knew himself too weak to close with the Prince: And therefore He hoped
his Highness would excuse him, if He made Choice of such Weapons as
He could best use; and therefore He resolved to fight on Foot with a
Case of Pistols only;” which the Prince willingly consented to. And
without Doubt They had met the next Morning, the Earl having chosen
Sir <HI>George Villiers</HI> for his Second; but that the Lord <HI>Gerard's</HI> coming to
the Earl so often, with whom He had no Acquaintance, had been so much<MILESTONE N="40"/>
observed, that some of the Lords who had been present at the Debate at
the Board, and heard some Replies which had been made, and thence con∣cluded
that ill Offices had been done, watched them Both so narrowly, and
caused the Town-Gates to be shut, that They discovered enough, notwith∣standing
the Denial of Both Parties, to prevent their Meeting; and afterwards
interposed till a Reconciliation was made: And the Prince ever afterwards
had a good Respect for the Earl.</P>
<P>AFTER the Murder of the King, the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> remained in
his own House, without the least Application to those Powers which had
made themselves so terrible, and which seemed to resolve to root out the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
whole Party as well as the Royal Family; and would not receive a Civility
from any of them: And when <HI>Cromwell</HI> was near his House in the Coun∣try,
upon the Marriage of his Son in those Parts, and had a Purpose to have
<PB N="415" REF="421"/>
made a Visit to him; upon a private Notice thereof, He immediately re∣moved
to another House at a greater Distance. He sent frequently some
trusty Person to the King with such Presents of Money, as He could receive
out of the Fortune They had left to him, which was scarce enough to sup∣port
him in that Retirement: And after the Battle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> when the
Rebels had set a Price upon the King's Head, and denounced the most
terrible Judgment upon any Person, and his Posterity, that should presume
to give any Shelter or Assistance to <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> towards his Escape; He
sent a faithful Servant to all those Persons, who in Respect of their Fidelity
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and Activity were most like to be trusted upon such an Occasion, that They
should advertise the King, “that He would most willingly receive him into
his House, and provide a Ship for his Escape.” And his Majesty received
this Advertisement from him the Day before He was ready to embark in a
small Vessel prepared for him in <HI>Sussex;</HI> which his Majesty always remem∣bered,
as a worthy Testimony of his Affection and Courage in so general a
Consternation. And the Earl was used to say, “that after that miraculous
Escape, how dismal soever the Prospect was, He had still a Confidence
of his Majesty's Restoration.”</P>
<P>His own natural Disposition inclined to melancholick; and his Retire∣ment
<MILESTONE N="20"/>from all Conversation, in which He might have given some Vent to
his own Thoughts, with the Discontinuance of all those bodily Exercises and
Recreations to which He had been accustomed, brought many Diseases upon
him, which made his Life less pleasant to him; so that from the Time of the
King's Return, between the Gout and the Stone, He underwent great Afflic∣tion.
Yet upon the happy Return of his Majesty He seemed to recover great
Vigour of Mind, and undertook the Charge of High Treasurer with much
Alacrity and Industry, as long as He had any Hope to get a Revenue set∣tled
proportionable to the Expense of the Crown (towards which his Interest
and Authority and Counsel contributed very much), or to reduce the Ex∣pense
<MILESTONE N="30"/>of the Court within the Limits of the Revenue. But when He dis∣cerned
that the last did and would still make the former impossible (upon
which He made as frequent and lively Representations as He thought him∣self
obliged to do), and when He saw Irregularities and Excesses to abound,
and to overflow all the Banks which should restrain them; He grew more
dispirited, and weary of that Province, which exposed him to the Reproaches
which others ought to undergo, and which supplied him not with Authority
to prevent them. And He had then withdrawn from the Burden, which He
infinitely desired to be cased of, but out of Conscience of his Duty to the
King, who He knew would suffer in it; and that the People who knew his
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Affections very well, and already opened their Mouths wide against the Li∣cense
of the Court, would believe it worse and incurable if He quitted the
Station He was in. This, and this only, prevailed with him still to undergo
that Burden, even when He knew that They who enjoyed the Benefit of it
were as weary that He should be disquieted with it.</P>
<P>HE was a Man of great and exemplary Virtue and Piety, and very regular
in his Devotions; yet was not generally believed by the Bishops to have an
Affection keen enough for the Government of the Church, because He was
willing and desirous, that Somewhat more might have been done to gratify
the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> than They thought just. But the Truth is; He had a
<MILESTONE N="50"/>perfect Detestation of all the Presbyterian Principles, nor had ever had any
Conversation with their Persons, having during all those wicked Times
strictly observed the Devotions prescribed by the Church of <HI>England;</HI> in the
Performance whereof He had always an orthodox Chaplain, one of those
<PB N="416" REF="422"/>
deprived of their Estates by that Government, which disposed of the Church
as well as of the State. But it is very true, that upon the Observation of the
great Power and Authority which the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> usurped and were possessed
of, even when <HI>Cromwell</HI> did all He could to divest them of it, and applied all
his Interest to oppress or suppress them, insomuch as They did often give a
Check to and divert many of his Designs; He did believe that their Num∣bers
and their Credit had been much greater than in Truth they were.
And then some Persons, who had Credit with him by being thought to
have an equal Aversion from them, persuaded him to believe, that They
would be satisfied with very easy Concessions, which would bring no Preju∣dice<MILESTONE N="10"/>
or Inconvenience to the Church. And this Imagination prevailed with
him, and more with others who loved them not, to wish that there might be
some Indulgence towards them. But that which had the strongest Influence
upon him, and which made him less apprehensive of the Venom of any other
Sect, was the extreme Jealousy He had of the Power and Malignity of the
<HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> whose Behaviour from the Time of the Suppression of the
Regal Power, and more scandalously at and from the Time of the Murder
of the King, had very much irreconciled him towards them: And He did
believe, that the King and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had a better Opinion of their
Fidelity, and less Jealousy of their Affections, than They deserved; and so<MILESTONE N="20"/>
thought there could not be too great an Union of all other Interests to con∣trol
the Exorbitance of that. And upon this Argument, with his private
Friends, He was more passionate than in any other.</P>
<P>HE had a marvellous Zeal and Affection for the Royal Family; insomuch
as the two Sons of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> falling Both into Distempers (of which
They Both shortly after died) very few Days before his Death, He was so
marvellously affected with it, that many believed the Trouble of it, or a Pre∣sage
what might befall the Kingdom by it, hastened his Death some Hours:
And in the Agony of Death, the very Morning He died, He sent to know
how They did; and seemed to receive some Relief, when the Messenger re∣turned<MILESTONE N="30"/>
with the News, that They were Both alive and in some Degree
mended.</P>
<P>THE next Day after his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣solves to put the Treasury into Commis∣sion.</NOTE> which was about the End of <HI>May,</HI> the
King called the Chancellor into his Closet; and, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being
only present, told him, “that He could think of no Man fit to be Trea∣surer,
and therefore resolved, as He had long done, to put that Office into
Commission;” and then asked, “who should be Commissioners:” To
which He answered, “the Business would be much better done by a single
Officer, if He could think of a fit one; for Commissioners never had, ne∣ver
would do, that Business well.” The Duke of <HI>York</HI> said, “that He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
believed it would be best done by Commission; it had been so managed
during all the ill Times” (for from the Beginning of the Troubles there
had been no Treasurer): “And He had observed (and the King found the
Benefit of it), that though Sir <HI>William Compton</HI> was an extraordinary
Person, and better qualified than most Men for that Charge, yet since his
Decease, that his Majesty had put the Office of the Ordnance under the
Government of Commissioners, it was in much better Order, and the King
was better served there than He had ever been; and He believed He
would be so likewise in the Office of the Treasury, if fit Persons were
chosen for it, who might have Nothing else to do.” And the King seemed<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to be of the same Mind.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor replied, “that He was very sorry, that They were Both
so much delighted with the Function of Commissioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor advises him against it.</NOTE> which were more
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>
suitable to the modelling a Commonwealth, than for the Support of Mo∣narchy:
That during the late Troubles, whilst the Parliament exercised
the Government, They reduced it as fast as They could to the Form of
a Commonwealth; and then no Question the putting the Treasury into
the Hands of Commissioners was much more suitable to the rest of the
Model, than it could be under a single Person. Besides, having no Re∣venue
of their own, but being to raise one according to their Inventions
and proportionable to their own Occasions, it could never be well col∣lected
or ordered by old Officers, who were obliged to Forms which would
<MILESTONE N="10"/>not be agreeable to their necessary Transactions: So that new Ministers
were to be made for new Employments, who might be obliged punctually
to observe their new Orders, without any Superiority over each other, but
a joint Obedience to the supreme Authority. But when <HI>Cromwell</HI> assumed
the entire Government into his own Hands, He cancelled all those Re∣publican
Rules and Forms, and appointed inferiour Persons to several
Functions, and reserved the whole Disposition to himself, and was his
own High Treasurer: And it was well known that He resolved, as soon
as He should be able to reduce Things to the Forms He intended, to can∣cel
all those Commissions, and invest single Persons in the Government of
<MILESTONE N="20"/>those Provinces.”</P>
<P>HE said, “He would not take upon him to say any Thing of the Office
of the Ordnance, where the Commissioners were his Friends; only He
might say, that that Kind of Administration had not been yet long enough
known to have a good Judgment made of it: However, that it was of so
different a Nature from the Office of the Treasury, that no Observation of
the one could be applied to the other. The Ordnance was conversant
only with Smiths and Carpenters, and other Artificers and Handicrafts∣men,
with whom all their Transactions were: Whereas the Treasury had
much to do with the Nobility and chief Gentry of the Kingdom; must
<MILESTONE N="30"/>have often Recourse to the King himself for his particular Directions, to
the Privy Council for their Assistance and Advice, to the Judges for their
Resolutions in Matters of Difficulty; and if the Ministers of it were not
of that Quality and Degree, that They might have free Recourse to all
those, and find Respect from them, his Majesty's Service would notoriously
suffer. And that the White Staff itself, in the Hands of a Person esteemed,
did more to the bringing in several Branches of the Revenue, by the Obe∣dience
and Reverence all Officers paid to it, than any Orders from Com∣missioners
could do: And that how mean an Opinion soever some Men
had of the Faculties of the late excellent Officer for that Administration, his
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Majesty would find by Experience, that the vast Sums of Money, which
He had borrowed in these late Years, had been in a great Measure pro∣cured
upon the general Confidence all Men had in the Honour and Justice
of the Treasurer; and that the Credit of Commissioners would never be
able to supply such Necessities.”</P>
<P>THE King said, “He was not at all of his Opinion, and doubted not his
Business would be much better done by Commissioners; and therefore He
should speak to the Nomination of those, since He was sure He could pro∣pose
no single Person fit for it.” To which the Chancellor answered, “that
He thought it much harder to find a worthy Man, who would be persuaded
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to accept it in the Disorder in which his Affairs were, than a Man who
might be very fit for it: And that if that Subject who had the greatest For∣tune
in <HI>England</HI> and the most general Reputation would receive it, his Ma∣jesty
would be no Loser in conferring it on such a one; and till such a one
<PB N="418" REF="424"/>
might be found, He might put it into Commission. But,” He said,
“He perceived well, that He would not approve the old Course in the
Choice of Commissioners; who had always been the Keeper of the Great
Seal, and the two Secretaries of State, and two other of the principal Per∣sons
of the Council, besides the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who used
to be the sole Person of the <HI>Quorum.</HI>”</P>
<P>NEITHER the King nor Duke seemed to like any of those; and the Chan∣cellor
plainly discerned from the Beginning that They were resolved upon
the Persons, though his Opinion was asked: And the King said, “He would
choose such Persons, whether Privy Counsellors or not, who might have<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Nothing else to do, and were rough and illnatured Men, not to be moved
with Civilities or Importunities in the Payment of Money; but would
apply it all to his present Necessities, till some new Supplies might be
gotten for the Payment of those Debts, which were first necessary to be
paid. That He, the Chancellor, had so much Business already upon
his Hands, that He could not attend this other; and the Secretaries
had enough to do: So He would have none of those.” And then He
named Sir <HI>Thomas Clifford,</HI> who was newly of the Council and Controller
of the House, and Sir <HI>William Coventry;</HI> and said, “He did not think
there should be many:” And the Duke then named Sir <HI>John Duncombe,</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
as a Man of whom He had heard well, and every Body knew He was inti∣mate
with Sir <HI>William Coventry.</HI> The King said, “He thought They three
would be enough, and that a greater Number would but make the Dis∣patch
of all Business the more slow.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor said, “He doubted those Persons would not have Credit
and Authority enough to go through the necessary Affairs of that Pro∣vince;
that for his own Part, He was not desirous to meddle in it; He
had indeed too much Business to do: That He had no Objection to the
three Persons named, but that He thought them not known and esteemed
enough for that Employment; and that it would be very incongruous to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
bring Sir <HI>John Duncombe,</HI> who was a private Country Gentleman, and ut∣terly
unacquainted with Business of that Nature, to sit in equal Authority
with Privy Counsellors, and in Affairs which would be often debated at
the Council-Table, where He could not be present.” And He put his
Majesty in Mind, “that He must put the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> out of his Office of
Chancellor of the Exchequer, if He did not make him Commissioner of
the Treasury, and of the <HI>Quorum:</HI>” And concluded, “that if He did
not name the General, and some other Person that might give some Lustre
to the others, the Work would not be done as it ought to be; for many
Persons would be sometimes obliged to attend upon the Treasury, who<MILESTONE N="40"/>
would not think those Gentlemen enough superiour to them, how qua∣lified
soever.”</P>
<P>THE King said, “He could easily provide against the Exception to
Sir <HI>John Duncombe,</HI> by making him a Privy Counsellor; and He did
not care if He added the General to them.” The Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> gave
him some Trouble, and He said enough to make it manifest that He
thought him not fit to be amongst them: Yet He knew not how to put
him out of his Place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissioners of the Treasury appointed.</NOTE> but gave Direction for preparing the Commission for
the Treasury to the Persons named before, and made the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> only
one of the Commissioners, and a major Part to make a <HI>Quorum;</HI> which<MILESTONE N="50"/>
would quickly bring the Government of the whole Business into the Hands
of those three who were designed for it. And <HI>Ashley</HI> rather chose to be de∣graded,
than to dispute it.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="425"/>
THE King expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Negotiations at</HI> Breda.</NOTE> that as soon as the Ambassadours should meet at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> a Cessation would be the first Thing that would be agreed upon:
And the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours did in the first Place propose it, and in such
a Manner, as made it evident that They depended upon it as a Thing re∣solved
upon; and their Master had with their Consent dismissed his own
Fleet, and theirs was yet in their Ports. Nor did the <HI>Dutch</HI> seem to refuse
it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>de∣fer agreeing to a Cessation.</HI></NOTE> but answered, “that the adjusting all Things in Order to a Cessation
would require as much Time as would serve to finish the Treaty, consi∣dering
all material Points were upon the Matter already stated and agreed
<MILESTONE N="10"/>upon, the King having already chosen the Alternative:” And notwith∣standing
all the Earnestness used by the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours, no other An∣swer
could be obtained as to a Cessation; which, together with the super∣cilious
Behaviour of the Commissioners from <HI>Holland,</HI> made it apparent, that
They had no other Mind at that Time to Peace, than as They were com∣pelled
to it by <HI>France,</HI> that was impatient to have it concluded. They would
not hear any Mention for the Redelivery of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> “which,” They said,
the King of <HI>France</HI> had promised should not be demanded;” and as little
for any Recompense in Money; nor would suffer the Merchant-Deputies from
the <HI>English</HI> Company to go to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to confer with the <HI>East-India</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Company there for any Composition. It quickly appeared, that They had
Revenge in their Hearts for their last Year's Affront and Damage at the
<HI>Flie;</HI> and <HI>De Wit</HI> had often said, “that before any Peace They would
leave some such Mark of their having been upon the <HI>English</HI> Coast, as
the <HI>English</HI> had left of their having been upon that of <HI>Holland.</HI>”</P>
<P>AFTER the Treaty was entered into,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Attempts of the</HI> Dutch <HI>upon</HI> Sheerness <HI>and</HI> Chatham.</NOTE> about the Beginning of <HI>June De
Ruyter</HI> came with the Fleet out of the <HI>Wierings,</HI> and joining with the rest
from the <HI>Texel</HI> sailed for the Coast of <HI>England:</HI> And having a fair Wind
stood for the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> which put the County of <HI>Kent</HI> into such an
Alarm, that all near the Sea left their Houses and fled into the Country.
<MILESTONE N="30"/>The Earl of <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> who was Lord Lieutenant of that County, was at
that Time Ambassadour at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the Deputy-Lieutenants had
all equal Authority: So that no Man had Power to command in that large
County in so general a Distraction. Hereupon the King sent down Lieute∣nant
General <HI>Middleton</HI> with Commission to draw all the Trainbands toge∣ther,
and to command all the Forces that could be raised: And He imme∣diately
went thither, and was very well obeyed, and quickly drew all the
Trainbands of Horse and Foot to <HI>Rochester;</HI> and other Troops resorted to
him from the neighbour Counties, all the People expressing a great Alacrity
in being commanded by him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>THERE had been enough Discourse all that Year of erecting a Fort at
<HI>Sheerness</HI> for the Defence of the River: And the King had made two
Journies thither in the Winter, and had given such Orders to the Commis∣sioners
of the Ordnance for the overseeing and finishing the Fortifications,
that every Body believed that Work done; it having been the principal De∣fence
and Provision directed and depended upon (as hath been said before),
when the Resolution had been taken for the standing only upon the Defence
for this Summer. But whatever had been thought or directed, very little
had been done. There were a Company or two of very good Soldiers there
under excellent Officers; but the Fortifications were so weak and unfinished,
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and all other Provisions so entirely wanting, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet no sooner
approached within a Distance, but with their Cannon They beat all the
Works flat, and drove all the Men from the Ground: Which as soon as
<PB N="420" REF="426"/>
They had done, with their Boats They landed Men, and seemed resolved to fortify and keep it.</P>
<P>THIS put the Country into a Flame, and the News of it exceedingly
disturbed the King. He knew the Consequence of the Place, and how easily
it might have been secured, and was the more troubled that it had been
neglected: And with what Loss soever, it must be presently recovered out
of those Hands. The General was immediately ordered to march to <HI>Chat∣ham,</HI>
for the Security of the Navy, with such Troops of Horse and Foot as
could be presently drawn together out of the Guards, and from the neigh∣bour
Counties; and the City appeared very forward to send such Regiments<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of their Trainbands as should be required. When the General came to <HI>Chat∣ham,</HI>
He found <HI>Middleton</HI> in so good a Posture, and so good a Body of Men,
that He had no Apprehension of any Attempt the <HI>Dutch</HI> could make at
Land; and He writ very cheerful and confident Letters to the King and
the Duke, “that if the Enemy should make any Attempt, which He be∣lieved
They durst not do, They would repent it. That He had put a
Chain over the River, which would hinder them from coming up: And if
They should adventure to land any where, He would quickly beat them
to their Ships;” as no Doubt He had been very well able to have done.</P>
<P>THERE was indeed no Danger of their landing, and They were too wife<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to think of it: Their Business was in an Element They had more Confidence
in and more Power upon. They had good Intelligence how loosely all
Things were left in the River: And therefore as soon as the Tide came to
help them, They stood full up the River, without any Consideration of the
Chain, which their Ships immediately brake in Pieces, and passed without
the least Pause; there being either no such Device to be made that can ob∣struct
such an Enterprise, or that which was made was so weak, that it was
of no Signification, but to raise an unseasonable Confidence in unskilful Men,
that being disappointed must increase the Confusion, as it did. For all Men
were so confounded to see the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet advance over the Chain, which<MILESTONE N="30"/>
They looked upon as a Wall of Brass, that They knew not what They
were to do.</P>
<P>THE General was of a Constitution and Temper so void of Fear, that
there could appear no Signs of Distraction in him: Yet it was plain enough
that He knew not what Orders to give. There were two or three Ships of
the Royal Navy negligently, if not treacherously, left in the River, which
might have been very easily drawn into Safety, and could be of no ima∣ginable
Use in the Place where they then were: Into one of those the Ge∣neral
put himself, and invited the young Gentlemen who were Volunteers to
accompany him; which They readily did in great Numbers, only with Pikes<MILESTONE N="40"/>
in their Hands. But some of his Friends whispered to him, “how unad∣vised
that Resolution was, and how desperate, without Possibility of Suc∣cess,
the whole Fleet of the Enemy approaching as fast as the Tide would
enable them.” And so He was prevailed with to put himself again on
Shore: Which except He had done, both himself and two or three hundred
Gentlemen of the Nobility and prime Gentry of the Kingdom had in∣evitably
perished; for all those Ships, and some Merchant-Men laden and
ready to put to Sea, were presently in a Flame; the <HI>Dutch,</HI> knowing that
They could not carry them off, giving Order to burn them, the General
standing upon the Shore, and not knowing what Remedy to apply to all<MILESTONE N="50"/>
this Mischief. The People of <HI>Chatham,</HI> which is naturally an Army of
Seamen and Officers of the Navy, who might and ought to have secured all
those Ships, which They had Time enough to have done, were in Distrac∣tion;
<PB N="421" REF="427"/>
their chief Officers having applied all those Boats and lighter Vessels
which should have towed up the Ships, to carry away their own Goods and
Housholdstuff, and given what They left behind for lost. And without
Doubt, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> had prosecuted the present Advantage They had, with
that Circumspection and Courage that was necessary, They might have fired
the Royal Navy at <HI>Chatham,</HI> and taken or destroyed all the Ships which
lay higher in the River, and so fully revenged themselves for what They
had suffered at the <HI>Flie:</HI> But They thought They had done enough, and so
made Use of the Ebb to carry them back again.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>BUT the Noise of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Conster∣nation in the City and Court.</NOTE> and the Flame of the Ships which were burned,
made it easily believed in the City of <HI>London,</HI> that the Enemy had done all
that They conceived They might have done: They thought that They were
landed in many Places, and that their Fleet was come up as far as <HI>Green∣wich.</HI>
Nor was the Confusion there greater than it was in the Court itself:
Where They who had most advanced the War, and reproached all them
who had been or were thought to be against it, “as Men who had no pub∣lick
Spirits, and were not solicitous for the Honour and Glory of the Na∣tion;”
and who had never spoken of the <HI>Dutch</HI> but with Scorn and Con∣tempt,
as a Nation rather worthy to be cudgelled than fought with; were now
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the most dejected Men that can be imagined, railed very bitterly at those who
had advised the King to enter into that War, “which had already consumed
so many gallant Men, and would probably ruin the Kingdom,” and wished“
that a Peace, as the only Hope, were made upon any Terms.” In a
Word; the Distraction and Consternation was so great in Court and City,
as if the <HI>Dutch</HI> had not been only Masters of the River, but had really landed
an Army of one hundred thousand Men.</P>
<P>THEY who remember that Conjuncture, and were then present in the
Galleries and privy Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> whither all the World flocked
with equal Liberty, can easily call to Mind many Instances of such wild
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Despair and even ridiculous Apprehensions, that I am willing to forget, and
would not that the least Mention of them should remain: And if the King's
and Duke's personal Composure had not restrained Men from expressing their
Fears, there wanted not some who would have advised them to have left the
City. And there was a Lord, who would be thought one of the greatest
Soldiers in <HI>Europe,</HI> to whom the Custody of the <HI>Tower</HI> was committed, who
lodging there only one Night, declared “that it was not tenable,” and de∣sired
not to be charged with it: And thereupon many, who had carried
their Money and Goods thither, removed them from thence that they might
be farther from the River. Nor did this unreasonable Distemper pass away,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>when it was known that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet had not only left the River, but
had taken away all their Men from <HI>Sheerness,</HI> which was a Manifestation
very sufficient that They had no Design upon the Land: But there remained
still such a Chagrin in the Minds of many, as if They would return again;
in which They were confirmed, when They heard that They were still upon
the Coasts, and gave the same Alarm now to <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> as They had
done to <HI>Kent,</HI> not without making a Shew as if They meant to attempt
<HI>Harwich</HI> and <HI>Landguard Point;</HI> which drew all the Trainbands of those
Counties to the Seaside, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> went thither to conduct them,
if there should be Occasion.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>IN this Perplexity the King was not at Ease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ad∣vised to con∣vent the Par∣liament during the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roga∣tion.</NOTE> and the less that every Man
took upon him to discourse to him of the Distemper of the People generally
over the Kingdom, and to give him Counsel what was to be done: And
some Men had advised him to call the Parliament, which at the last Session
<PB N="422" REF="428"/>
had been prorogued to the twentieth of <HI>October;</HI> and it was now the Mid∣dle
of <HI>June.</HI> And surely most discerning Men thought such a Conjuncture
so unseasonable for the Council of a Parliament, that if it had been then
fitting, the most wholesome Advice that could be given would be to sepa∣rate
them, till that Occasion should be over, which could be best provided
for by a more contracted Council: However not knowing else what to do
disposed the King to incline to that Remedy. And it being a current Opi∣nion,
or rather an unquestioned Certainty, that upon a Prorogation a Par∣liament
cannot be convened before the Day, though upon an Adjournment
it may; They had brought Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> privately to the King to satisfy him,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
“that upon an extraordinary Occasion He might do it:” And his Judgment,
which in all other Cases He did enough undervalue, very much confirmed
him in what He had a Mind to.</P>
<P>IN the Beginning of the Summer, when He had resolved to have no Fleet
at Sea, there were many Reasons which induced him to increase his Forces
at Land. And that He might do it without Jealousy of the People, He gave
Commission to three or four Persons of the Nobility, of great Fortunes and
good Names, to raise Regiments of Foot, and to others for Troops of Horse;
which was done at their own Charge, and with wonderful Expedition: And
upon their first Musters They all received one Month's Pay. Of these Le∣vies<MILESTONE N="20"/>
some were sent to repossess <HI>Sheerness,</HI> and extraordinary Care was taken
for the better Advancement of those Fortifications; and others were disposed
to other Posts upon the Coast: But it was in View, that upon the Expira∣tion
of that Month, there must be new Pay provided for those Regiments
and Troops. Then the Trainbands, which had been drawn together, had
continued for one Month, which was as long as the Law required: And
now They required, or were said to require, to be relieved or dismissed, or
that They might receive Pay. There were Discontents and Emulations upon
Command; and They who had usually prosessed, “that They would wil∣lingly
serve the King in the Offices of Corporals or Serjeants, whatever<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Command They formerly had,” now disputed all the Punctilios, and
would not receive Orders from any who had been formerly in inferiour Of∣fices.
And all these Waywardnesses were brought to the King, as Matters of
the highest Consequence, who found Difficulty enough in determining Points
of more Importance.</P>
<P>THEY who for their own private Designs desired that the Parliament might
meet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Privy Council con∣sulted about the reassem∣bling the Par∣liament.</NOTE> and cared not in what Humour They met, urged the King very im∣portunately,
“that He would issue out a Proclamation to summon them,
as the only Expedient to give himself Ease, and to provide for all that was
to be done:” And his Majesty was most inclined to it, and in Truth re∣solved<MILESTONE N="40"/>
it; though knowing that it was contrary to the Sense of many, He
resolved to debate it at the Council. And there He told them, “that They
all saw the Streights that He was in, the Insolence of the Enemy, and the
general Distemper of the Nation, which made it manifest that it was ne∣cessary
for him to have an Army, that might be ready against any Thing
that might fall out. That He had no Money, nor knew where to get
any; nor could imagine any other Way to provide against the Mischiefs
which were in View, than by calling the Parliament to come together, of
which or any other Expedient He was willing to receive their Advice;”
expressing so much of his own Sense, that it was plain enough that He<MILESTONE N="50"/>
thought that Remedy the best that could be applied. Three or four of those
who fate at the lower End of the Board, and who were well enough known
to have given the Counsel, and to be industrious that it might be followed,
<PB N="423" REF="429"/>
enlarged themselves in the Debate, “that the Soldiers could not be kept to∣gether
without Money; and They could not advise any other Way to get
Money but by the convening the Parliament, which They were confident
might justly and regularly be done:” And They desired, “that They
who were of another Opinion would propose some other Way how the
King might get Money.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor discerned that the Matter was already concluded, what
Advice soever should be given; and that the three new Commissioners of the
Treasury, since They could find no Way to procure Money, had been very
<MILESTONE N="10"/>importunate with the King to try that Expedient, and the more, because
They well knew that He was against it, He having not been at all reserved
upon several Occasions in private Discourses, when They were present, to
give many Reasons against it: And He knew as well, that They would
gladly make any Use of any Expressions which might fall from him, when
the Remembrance might be applied to his Prejudice. Yet his natural Un∣wariness
in such Cases with Reference to himself, when He thought his Ma∣jesty's
Service concerned, to which He did really believe the present Advice
would produce much Prejudice, prevailed with him to dissuade it.</P>
<P>HE said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor opposes it.</NOTE> “He knew well upon what Disadvantage He spake, and how
<MILESTONE N="20"/>unpopular a Thing it was to speak against the convening the Parliament
in those Streights, which seemed to be capable of no other Remedy: Yet
since He thought the Remedy neither proper to the Disease, nor that it
could be applied in Time, He could not concur with those who advised
it. That most Men who had any Knowledge in the Law did confess,
that when the Parliament stood prorogued to a certain Day, the convening
them upon a sooner Day was very doubtful; and to him, upon all the
Disquisition He could make, it was very clear that it could not be done:
And therefore He desired the Judges might be consulted in that Point,
before any Resolution should be taken. That the Temper of Both Houses
<MILESTONE N="30"/>was well known; and that it could not but be presumed, that when They
came together, the first Debate They would fall upon would be of the
Manner of their coming together, and whether They were in a Capacity
to act: And He doubted there would be very few who would be for∣ward
to pass an Act in a Season, when the Validity of it might be ques∣tioned
by those who had no Mind to pay any Obedience to it. And then
if their Meeting were only to confer together upon all Occurrences, and
They might presume of Liberty to say what They had a Mind to say,
without Power to conclude any Thing; it was well worth the considering,
whether, in so general a Distemper, such an Assembly might not inter∣rupt
<MILESTONE N="40"/>all other Consultations and Expedients, and yet propose none, and
so increase the Confusion. If the Necessities were so urgent, that it was
absolutely necessary that a Parliament should be convened, and that which
stood prorogued could not lawfully reassemble till the twentieth of <HI>Oc∣tober,</HI>
as He was confident it could not; there was no Question to be
made, but that the King might lawfully by his Proclamation presently
dissolve the prorogued Parliament, and send out his Writs to have a new
Parliament, which might regularly meet a Month before the prorogued
Parliament could come together.” And many of the Council were of
Opinion, that it would most conduce to his Majesty's Service to dissolve the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>one, and to call another Parliament.</P>
<P>THIS was an Advice They believed no Man had the Courage to make,
and were sorry to find so many of the Opinion, which They had rather
should have appeared to be single. Many very warmly opposed this Expe∣dient,
<PB N="424" REF="430"/>
magnified the Affections and Inclinations of Both Houses: “And
though there appeared some ill Humour in them at their last being toge∣ther,
and Aversion to give any Money for the present; yet in the Main
their Affections were very right for Church and State. And that the
King was never to hope to see a Parliament better constituted for his Ser∣vice,
or so many of the Members at his Disposal: But that He must ex∣pect
that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> would be chosen in all Places, and that They
who were most eminent now for opposing all that He desired would be
chosen, and all They who were most zealous for his Service would be
carefully excluded;” which was a Fancy that sunk very deep in the Minds<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of the Bishops, though their best Friends thought them like to find more
Friends and a stronger Support in any, than They would have in that Par∣liament.
But the King quickly declared his Confidence in the Parliament
that was prorogued, and his Resolution not to dissolve it; which put an
End to that Debate. And the other was again resumed, “what the King
was to do towards the raising Money; or how He should be able to
maintain his Army, if He should defer calling the Parliament till the Day
upon which They were to assemble by the Prorogation:” And all Men
were to restrain their Discourse to that Point.</P>
<P>THE old Argument, “that there could be no other Way found out,”<MILESTONE N="20"/>
was renewed, and urged with more Earnestness and Confidence; and that
They who were against it might be obliged to offer their Advice what other
Course should be taken: And this was often demanded, in a Manner not
usual in that Place, as a Reproach to the Persons. His Majesty himself with
some Quickness was pleased to ask the Chancellor, “what He did advise.”
To which He replied, “that if in Truth what was proposed was in the Na∣ture
of it not practicable, or being practised could not attain the Effect
proposed, it ought to be laid aside, that Men might unbiassed apply their
Thoughts to find out some other Expedient. That He thought it very
clear that the Parliament could not assemble, though the Proclamation<MILESTONE N="30"/>
should issue out that very Hour, within less than twenty Days; and that
if They were met, and believed themselves lawfully qualified to grant a
Supply of Money, all Men knew the Formality of that Transaction would
require so much Time, that Money could not be raised Time enough to
raise an Army, or to maintain that Part of it that was raised, to prevent
the landing of an Enemy that was already upon the Coast, and (as many
thought or seemed to think) ready every Day to make their Descent: And
yet the sending out a Proclamation for reassembling the Parliament would
inevitably put an End to all other Counsels. That for his Part He did
believe, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had already satisfied themselves in the Affront<MILESTONE N="40"/>
They had given, and could not be in any Condition to pursue it, or have
Men enough on Board to make a Descent, without the King's having
Notice of it; and that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> without a Conjunction with the <HI>French,</HI>
had not Strength for such an Undertaking: And that the <HI>French</HI> had no
such Purpose his Majesty had all the Assurance possible, and that their
Fleet was gone far from the Coast of <HI>England.</HI> And his Majesty had
Reason to believe, that the present Treaty would put an End to this War
in a short Time, though the Power and Artifice of <HI>De Wit</HI> had prevented
a Cessation.”</P>
<P>“HOWEVER, for the present Support of those Troops which were necessary<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to guard the Coasts, since Money could not be found for their present con∣stant
Pay, without which free Quarter could not be avoided; the only
Way that appeared to him to be practicable, and to avoid the last Evil,
<PB N="425" REF="431"/>
would be, to write Letters to the Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieutenants of
those Counties where the Troops were obliged to remain, <HI>that They would
cause Provisions of all Kinds to be brought into those Quarters,</HI> that so the
Soldiers might not be compelled to straggle abroad to provide their own Vic∣tual,
which would end in the worst Kind of free Quarter: And that the like
Letters might be written to the neighbour Counties, wherein no Soldiers
were quartered, to raise Money by Way of Contribution or Loan, which
should be abated out of the next Impositions, that so the Troops might be
enabled to stay and continue in the Posts where They were, for Defence
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of the Kingdom; in which those other Counties had their Share in the
Benefit, and without which They must themselves be exposed to the Dis∣order
of the Soldiers, and possibly to the Invasion of the Enemy.”</P>
<P>IT is very probable, that in the Earnestness of this Debate, and the fre∣quent
Interruptions which were given, He might use that Expression (which
was afterwards objected against him) “of raising Contribution as had been
in the late civil War.” Whatever it was He said, it was evident at the
Time that some Men were well pleased with it, as Somewhat They meant
to make Use of hereafter, in which his Innocence made him little concerned.</P>
<P>THE Conclusion was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment summon∣ed to meet.</NOTE> though many of the Lords spake against it, and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>much the major Part thought it not counsellable; that a Proclamation
should forthwith issue out, to require all the Members of Parliament to meet
upon a Day appointed in the Beginning of <HI>August,</HI> to consult upon the
great Affairs of the Kingdom: And this Proclamation was presently issued
accordingly.</P>
<P>ALL this Time the Treaty proceeded at <HI>Breda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treaty ad∣vanced.</NOTE> as fast as the insolent Hu∣mour
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> would suffer it. The <HI>French</HI> King declared himself
much offended with their Proceedings at Sea: And his Ambassadours spake
so loud, that the <HI>States</HI> gave Order to their Deputies to bring the Treaty to
a Conclusion; and sent such Orders to <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> that there was no more
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Hostility of any Moment; only the Fleet remained at Sea, that it might ap∣pear
They were Masters of it. It cannot be denied that the <HI>French</HI> Ambas∣sadours,
except in what referred to <HI>Poleroone,</HI> behaved themselves as candidly
as could be wished: And it is probable, that the same Reason which moved
the <HI>French</HI> to use all possible Diligence to bring the Treaty to an End, pre∣vailed
likewise with the <HI>Dutch</HI> to use all the Delays They could, that it might
be prolonged.</P>
<P>THOUGH there was no War declared, it had been long notorious that
<HI>Flanders</HI> would be invaded: And it was as notorious, that there was no
Provision made there towards a Resistance or Defence; the Marquis of <HI>Cas∣telle
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Roderigo,</HI> who came Governour thither with a great Reputation, not
making good the Expectation in the Sagacity He was famed for, nor offer∣ing
at any Levies of Men, or mending Fortifications, until the <HI>French</HI> Army
was upon the Borders. Then He sent into <HI>England</HI> to press the King to
assist him with an Army of Horse and Foot; and it easily appeared the Na∣tion
would gladly have engaged in that War, not being willing that <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>
should be in the Possession of <HI>France:</HI> But the King was engaged not
to give any Assistance to the Enemies of <HI>France</HI> until the Treaty should be
ended, which yet it was not. However He suffered the Earl of <HI>Castle-ha∣ven,</HI>
under Pretence of recruiting a Regiment in <HI>Flanders</HI> which He had
<MILESTONE N="50"/>formerly, to raise a Body of one thousand Foot, which He quickly trans∣ported
to <HI>Ostend.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>France</HI> was impatient to march, and yet desired the Treaty
might be first concluded, that both himself and the King of <HI>England</HI> might
<PB N="426" REF="432"/>
be at Liberty to enter into such an Alliance as They should think proper for
their Interest: And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had no Mind that the Expedition should
be prosecuted, and as much feared the Consequence of such an Alliance,
though They were not wise enough to consider the right Means to prevent
it, desired that the Treaty might not be concluded till the Winter drew
nearer.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>invade</HI> Flan∣ders.</NOTE> But the <HI>French</HI> quickly put an End to that their Hope by march∣ing
into the Heart of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and so giving them new Matter for their
present Consultations; not without Intimation, “that if They would not
finish the Treaty, that King would conclude for what concerned himself:”
And this put an End to it. Yet there were some Alterations of small Im∣portance<MILESTONE N="10"/>
in some Articles of the former Treaty, besides that of <HI>Poleroone,</HI>
which the Ambassadours would not consent to without farther Knowledge
of the King's Pleasure: And so one of them (Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI>) came to
attend his Majesty to give him an Account of all Particulars, and receive his
own final Determination.</P>
<P>THE King in the first Place sent for the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and let
them know, “that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would not consent to the former Article for
the Redelivery of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> nor give any Recompense for it; and that He
was resolved not to depart from them, and so release their Right without
their Consent: And therefore that They should consider what would be<MILESTONE N="20"/>
for their Good.”<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> East-In∣dia <HI>Company give up their Claim to</HI> Po∣leroone.</NOTE> They answered, “that They thought a Peace to be so
necessary for the Kingdom, that They would not that any particular In∣terest
of theirs should give any Interruption to it:” And They acknow∣ledged,
“that if the War continued, They should in many Respects be
greater Losers, than the Redelivery of <HI>Poleroone</HI> would repair; and that
They would gladly sacrifice that Pretence to the publick Peace.”</P>
<P>UPON which Answer the Ambassadour made his Report of all the Parti∣culars
which were consented to on Both Sides in the Treaty, and what re∣mained
yet in Suspense; and made Answer to all Questions which any of the
Council thought fit to ask. And the King requiring him to deliver his own<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Opinion upon his Observation, and “whether He believed, that if his Ma∣jesty
should positively insist upon what They had hitherto refused to con∣sent
to, the <HI>Dutch</HI> would choose to continue the War; and whether the
<HI>French</HI> would join with them in it:” He answered; “that it was very evi∣dent
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not at present desire the Peace, otherwise than to
comply with <HI>France</HI> and for Fear of it; and that <HI>France</HI> was obliged not
to abandon them in the Point of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> which the other would never
part with, nor give any Recompense for, though the <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dours
had used all the Arguments to persuade them to it. But if that
were agreed, He was confident They would be compelled to consent to<MILESTONE N="40"/>
whatsoever was else of Moment. And that the <HI>French</HI> had used some
threatening Expressions, upon some insolent Propositions made by the
<HI>Dane,</HI> which They thought proceeded from the Instigation of <HI>Holland.</HI>
And that at his coming away, the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours had used great
Freedom with him, and advised <HI>in what Particulars which were yet un∣agreed
They wished his Majesty would not consent, and in which They could
not serve him, but believed a Time would come, in which He would be re∣paired
for those Condescensions: In other Particulars He should positively
insist, at least with some little Variation of Expression;</HI> in which He ex∣pressed
both his own and the Opinion of the other Ambassadour.”<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>AND the Whole being in this Manner clearly stated, the King required all
the Lords severally to deliver their Judgment what He was to do; and every
Man did deliver his Opinion in more or fewer Words. And it may be truly
<PB N="427" REF="433"/>
said, that, though one or two adorned their Passion with some Expressions
of Indignation against the <HI>Dutch</HI> for their Presumption, and as if They did
believe that the Parliament would concur with the King in all Things which
might vindicate his Honour from their insolent Demands, the Advice was
upon the Matter unanimous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Council ad∣vises the King to conclude the Treaty.</NOTE> “that the Ambassadours should immediately
return, and conclude the Peace upon those Conditions which were stated
at the Board.” And He did presently return: And all Matters were, within
few Days after his Arrival, adjusted, and put into proper ministerial Hands
for Engrossment, and all Forms and Circumstances agreed upon for the Pro∣clamation
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of the Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace made.</NOTE> and the Day appointed for the proclaiming thereof;
and such Forms of Passes as should be given on all Sides to Merchants Ships
(which would be impatient for Trade before the Days could be expired), in
which all Ships of War should be obliged to take Notice that the Peace was
proclaimed.</P>
<P>ALL this was done before the Day of the Parliament's convening upon the
King's Proclamation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment meets, and is imme∣diately pro∣rogu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> So that there being now no Use of an Army, and
Reason enough to disband those Regiments which had been raised towards
it, his Majesty thought it not reasonable that They should enter upon the
Debate of any Business, but be continued under the former Prorogation to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Day appointed; and in this there appeared not one Person of a different
Opinion. And so, upon the Day, the King went to the House, and told
them, “that since the Condition of his Affairs was not so full of Difficulty
as it had been when He sent out his Proclamation, and since many were
of Opinion, that there might be Doubts arise upon the Regularity of their
Meeting; He was content to dismiss them till the twentieth of <HI>October:</HI>”
And so They separated without any Debate.</P>
<P>THE Publick no sooner entered into this Repose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Storm begins to arise against the Chancellor.</NOTE> than the Storm began
to arise that destroyed all the Prosperity, ruined the Fortune, and ship∣wrecked
all the Hopes, of the Chancellor, who had been the principal In∣strument
<MILESTONE N="30"/>in the providing that Repose. The Parliament, that had been so
unseasonably called together from their Business and Recreations, in a Sea∣son
of the Year that They most desired to be vacant, were not pleased to
be so soon dismissed: And very great Pains were taken by those, who were
thought to be able to do him the least Harm, because They were known
to be his Enemies, to persuade the Members of Parliament, “that it was
the Chancellor only who had hindered their continuing together, and
that He had advised the King to dissolve them;” which exceedingly
inflamed them.</P>
<P>AND Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was so far from being reserved in his Malice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> William Coventry <HI>in∣censes the Members of the House of Commons a∣gainst him.</HI></NOTE>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>that the very Day that the Parliament was dismissed, after He had incensed
them against the Chancellor, in the Presence of six or seven of the Members,
who were not all of the same Mind, He declared “that if at their next Meet∣ing,
which would be within little more than two Months, They had a
Mind to remove, the Chancellor from the Court, They should easily bring
it to pass:” Of all which He had quickly Information, and had several
other Advertisements from Persons of Honour, “that there was a strong
Combination entered into against him;” and They mentioned some Par∣ticulars
to have been told the King concerning him, which had exceedingly
offended his Majesty. All which Particulars, being without any Colour or
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Ground of Truth, He believed were Inventions (though not from those who
informed him) only to amuse him.</P>
<P>YET He took an Opportunity to acquaint the King with it, who, with
the same Openness He had always used, conferred with him about his pre∣sent
<PB N="428" REF="434"/>
Business, but only of the Business. He besought his Majesty to let him
know, “whether He had received any Information that He had done or
said such and such Things,” which He made appear to him to be in
themselves so incredible and improbable, that it could hardly be in his Ma∣jesty's
Power to believe them; to which the King answered, “that Nobody
had told him any such Thing.” To which the other replied, “that He
did really think They had not, though He knew that They had bragged
They had done so, and thereby incensed his Majesty against him; which
They desired should be generally believed.”</P>
<P>THE Truth is; the Chancellor was guilty of that himself which He had<MILESTONE N="10"/>
used to accuse the Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> of, that He was too proud of a good
Conscience. He knew his own Innocence, and had no Kind of Apprehension of
being publickly charged with any Crime. He knew well He had many Enemies
who had Credit with the King, and that They did him all the ill Offices
They could: And He knew that the Lady's Power and Credit increased,
and that She desired Nothing more than to remove him from his Majesty's
Confidence; in which He never thought her to blame, since She well knew
that He employed all the Credit He had to remove her from the Court.
But He thought himself very secure in the King's Justice: And though his
Kindness was much lessened, He was confident his Majesty would protect<MILESTONE N="20"/>
him from being oppressed, since He knew his Integrity; and never suspected
that He would consent to his Ruin. He was in Truth weary of the Con∣dition
He was in, and had in the last Year undergone much Mortification;
and desired Nothing more, than to be divested of all other Trusts and Em∣ployments
than what concerned the Chancery only, in which He could
have no Rival, and in the Administration whereof He had not heard of
any Complaint: And this He thought might have satisfied all Parties; and
had sometimes desired the King, “that He might retire from all other Bu∣siness
than that of the Judicatory,” for He plainly discerned He was not
able to contend with other Struggles.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>I CANNOT avoid in this Place mentioning an Accident that fell out in this
Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Particular relating to the Duke of</HI> Buck∣ingham <HI>which hastens the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Chancellor.</HI></NOTE> and enlarge upon all the Circumstances thereof, which might other∣wise
be passed over, but that it had an immediate Influence on the Fate of
the Person who is so near his Fall. The King had been very much offended
with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had behaved himself much worse to∣wards
him than could be expected from his Obligations and Discretion, and
had been in Truth the original Cause of all the ill Humour which had been
in Both Houses of Parliament in the last Session; after the End of which
He went into the Country without taking his Leave of the King, and in
several Places spake with greater License of the Court and Government, and<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of the Person of the King, than any other Person presumed to do; of all
which his Majesty had Intelligence and Information, and was at that Time
without Doubt more offended with him than with any Man in <HI>England,</HI>
and had really great Provocation to Jealousy of his Fidelity, as well as
of his Respect and Affection. The Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> as Secretary of State, had
received several Informations of dangerous Words spoken by him against the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Duke's Behaviour.</NOTE> and of his Correspondencies with Persons the most suspected for sedi∣tious
Inclinations, the Duke having made himself very popular amongst the
<HI>Levellers,</HI> and amongst them who clamoured for Liberty of Conscience, which
Pretence He seemed very much to cherish.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE King was very much awakened to be jealous of him, besides his Be∣haviour
in the Parliament, by some Informations He received from his own
Servants. There was one <HI>Braythwaite</HI> a Citizen, who had been a great
<PB N="429" REF="435"/>
Confident of <HI>Cromwell</HI> and of the <HI>Council of State,</HI> a Man of Parts, and
looked upon as having a greater Interest with the discontented Party than
any Man of the City. Upon the King's Return this Man fled beyond the
Seas, and after near a Year's Stay there came again to <HI>London,</HI> but remained
there as <HI>incognito,</HI> came not upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> nor was seen in Publick,
and returned again into <HI>Holland;</HI> and so made frequent Journies backward
and forward for several Months, and then came and resided publickly in the
City. This being taken Notice of by Sir <HI>Richard Browne,</HI> who was Major
General of the City, upon whose Vigilance the King very much and very
<MILESTONE N="10"/>justly depended, and the Man being well known to him, He had long en∣deavoured
to apprehend him, till He understood that He was a Servant to
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and in great Trust with him, as He was; for
the Duke had committed the whole Managery of his Estate to him, and upon
his Recommendation had received many other inferiour Servants to be em∣ployed
under him, all of the same Leven with him, and all notorious for
their Disaffection to the Church and State. The Major General, being one
Day to give the King an Account of some Business, told him likewise of
this Man, “as one as worthy to be suspected for all disloyal Purposes, and as
like to bring them to pass, as any Man of that Condition in <HI>England;</HI>”
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and seemed to wonder “that the Duke would entertain such a Person in
his Service.”</P>
<P>AT that Time the Duke had by his Diligence, and those Faculties to∣wards
Mirth in which He excelled, made himself very acceptable to the
King; though many wondered that He could be so, considering what the
King himself knew of him: Insomuch that his Majesty told him what He
had been informed of his Steward, and how much He suffered in his Repu∣tation
for entertaining such Servants. The Duke received the Animadver∣sion
with all possible Submission and Acknowledgment of the Obligation,
and then enlarged upon the Commendation of the Man, “of his great
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Abilities, and the Benefit He received by his Service;” and besought
his Majesty “that He would vouchsafe to hear him, for He believed
He would give an Account of the State of the City, and of many Parti∣culars
which related to his Majesty's Service, better than most Men could
do.” And the King shortly after supping at the Duke's House, He
found an Opportunity to present Mr. <HI>Braythwaite</HI> to him, who was a Man
of a very good Aspect, which that People used not to have, and of notable
Insinuation. He made the King a Narration of the whole Course of his
Life, in which He did not endeavour to make himself appear a better Man
than He had been reported to be; which Kind of Ingenuity, as Men call
<MILESTONE N="40"/>it, is a wonderful Approach towards being believed. He related “by what
Degrees, and in what Method of Conviction, He had explicated himself
from all those ill Principles in which He had been entangled: And that it
had been a principal Motive to him to embrace the Opportunity of serving
the Duke, that He might totally retire from that Company and Conver∣sation
to which He had been most accustomed. And yet He thought He
had so much Credit with the chief of them, that They could never enter
into any active Combination, but He should have Notice of it: And as∣sured
his Majesty that Nothing should pass of Moment amongst that People,
but his Majesty should have very seasonable Information of it, and that
<MILESTONE N="50"/>He would always serve him with great Fidelity.” In Fine, the King was
well satisfied with his Discourse, and often afterwards upon the like Oppor∣tunities
conferred with him, and believed him to be well disposed to do him
any Service.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="436"/>
DURING the last Session of Parliament, in which the Duke carried him∣self
so disrespectfully to the King, this Man found an Opportunity to get
Access to his Majesty, which He was willing to give him; when He said,
“that He thought it his Duty, and according to his Obligation, to give his
Majesty an Account of what He had lately observed, and of his own Reso∣lutions.”
He told him, “that his Lord was of late very much altered,
and was fallen into the Acquaintance and Conversation of some Men of
very mean Condition, but of very desperate Intentions; with whom He
used to meet at unseasonable Hours, and in obscure Places, where Per∣sons
of Quality did not use to resort; and that He frequently received Let∣ters<MILESTONE N="10"/>
from them: All which made him apprehend that there was a Design
on Foot, which, how unreasonable soever, the Duke might be engaged
in. And for these and other Reasons, and the irregular Course of his
Life, He was resolved to withdraw himself from his Service: And that He
hoped, into what Extravagancies soever the Duke should cast himself, his
Majesty would retain a good Opinion of him, who would never swerve
from his Affection and Duty.”</P>
<P>THE Information and Testimony, which the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> brought to
the King shortly after this Advertisement, made the greater Impression; and
there were many Particulars in the Informations that could not be suspected<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to be forged. And it appeared that there was a poor Fellow, who had a
poorer Lodging about <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> and professed Skill in Horoscopes, to
whom the Duke often repaired in Disguise in the Night: And the Lord <HI>Ar∣lington</HI>
had caused that Fellow to be apprehended, and his Pockets and his
Chamber to be searched; where were found several Letters to the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> one or two whereof were in his Pocket sealed and not sent,
and the rest Copies, and one original Letter from the Duke to him, in all
which there were many unusual Expressions, which were capable of a very
ill Interpretation, and could not bear a good one. This Man and some
others were sent close Prisoners to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
and two other Privy Counsellors, by the King's Order, took their several
Examinations, and confronted them with those Witnesses, who accused them
and justified their Accusations; all which were brought to the King.</P>
<P>AND then his Majesty was pleased to acquaint the Chancellor with all that
had passed, who to that Minute had not the least Imagination of any Par∣ticular
relating to it: Nor had He any other Prejudice to the Person of
the Duke (for He behaved himself towards him with more than ordinary
Civility), than what was necessary for any Man to have upon Account of the
Extravagancy of his Life; and which He could not be without, upon what
He had often received from the Duke himself upon his own Knowledge.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
The King now shewed him all those Examinations and Depositions which
had been taken; and that Letter to the Fellow, “which,” his Majesty said,
“He knew to be every Word the Duke's own Hand;” and the Letters to
the Duke from the Fellow, which still gave him the Style of Prince, and
mentioned what <HI>great Things his Stars promised to him,</HI> and <HI>that He was the
Darling of the People, who had set their Hearts and Affections and all their
Hopes upon his Highness,</HI> with many other foolish and some sustian Expres∣sions.
His Majesty told him in what Places the Duke had been since He left
<HI>London;</HI> “that He stayed few Days in any Place; and that He intended on
such a Day, that was to come, to be in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> at the House of Sir<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<HI>Charles Wolsely,</HI>” a Gentleman who had been of great Eminency in <HI>Crom∣well's</HI>
Council, and one of those who had been sent by the House of Com∣mons
to persuade him to accept the Crown with the Title of King. Upon
<PB N="431" REF="437"/>
the whole Matter his Majesty asked him, “what Way He was to proceed
against him:” To which He answered, “that He was first to be appre∣hended;
and when He should be in Custody and examined, his Majesty
would better judge which Way He was to proceed against him.”</P>
<P>UPON farther Consideration with the Chancellor and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and
others of the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King is∣sues out his Warrant to apprehend him.</NOTE> the King sent a Sergeant at Arms, with a Warrant
under his Sign Manual, “to apprehend the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and to bring
him before one of the Secretaries of State, to answer to such Crimes as should
be objected against him;” or to that Purpose. The Sergeant made a Journey
<MILESTONE N="10"/>into <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> where He was informed the Duke was: But still, when
He came to the House where He was said to be, it was pretended that He
was gone from thence some Hours before; by which He found that He had
Notice of his Business. And therefore He concealed himself, and appointed
some Men to watch and inform themselves of his Motions, it being generally
reported that He would be at the House of the Earl of <HI>Exeter</HI> at such a
Time. And Notice was given him, that He was then in a Coach with
Ladies going to that House: Upon which He made so good Haste, that He
was in View of the Coach, and saw the Duke alight out of the Coach, and
lead a Lady into the House; upon which the Door of the Court was shut
<MILESTONE N="20"/>before He could get to it. He knocked loudly at that and other Doors
that were all shut; so that He could not get into the House, though it
were some Hours before Sunset in the Month of <HI>May.</HI> After some Hours
Attendance, one Mr. <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted upon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
came to the Door, and without opening it asked him, “what He would
have:” And He answered, “that He had a Message to the Duke from
the King, and that He must speak with him;” to which He replied,
that He was not there, and that He should seek for him in some other
Place.” The Sergeant told him, “that He saw him go into the House;
and that if He might not be admitted to speak with him, He would re∣quire
<MILESTONE N="30"/>the Sheriff of the County to give him his Assistance:” Upon which
the Gentleman went away, and about Half an Hour after returned again,
and threatened the Sergeant so much, after He had opened the Door, that
the poor Man had not the Courage to stay longer; but returned to the
Court, and gave a full Relation in Writing to the Secretary of the Endea∣vours
He had used, and the Affronts He had received.</P>
<P>WHY all the particular Circumstances of this Affair are so punctually re∣lated,
will appear anon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is removed from all his Employments.</NOTE> The King was so exceedingly offended at this
Carriage and Behaviour of the Duke, that He made Relation of it to the
Council-Board, and publickly declared, “that He was no longer of that
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Number,” and caused his Name to be left out in the List of the Coun∣sellors,
and “that He was no longer a Gentleman of his Bedchamber,” and
put the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> to wait in his Place. His Majesty likewise revoked
that Commission by which He was constituted Lord Lieutenant of the East
Riding in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and granted that Commission to the Earl of <HI>Burling∣ton:</HI>
So that it was not possible for his Majesty to give more lively Instances
of his Displeasure against any Man, than He had done against the Duke.
And at the same Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proclama∣tion for ap∣prehending him.</NOTE> with the Advice of the Board, a Proclamation issued
out for his Apprehension, and inhibiting all Persons to entertain, receive or
conceal him. Upon which He thought it fit to leave the Country, and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that He should be less discovered in <HI>London,</HI> whither He resorted, and had
many Lodgings in several Quarters of the City. And though his Majesty had
frequent Intelligence where He was, and continued Advertisements of the
Liberty He took in his Discourses of his own Person, and of some others, of
<PB N="432" REF="438"/>
which He was no less sensible; yet when the Sergeant at Arms, and others
employed for his Apprehension, came where He was known to have been
but an Hour before, He was gone from thence, or so concealed there that
He could not be found: And in this Manner He continued sleeping all the
Day, and walking from Place to Place in the Night, for the Space of some
Months.</P>
<P>AT last being advertised of renewed Instances of the King's Displeasure,
and that it every Day increased upon new Intelligence that He received of
his Behaviour, He grew weary of the Posture He was in, and employed se∣veral
Persons to move the King on his Behalf; for He was informed that<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the King resolved to proceed against him for his Life, and that his Estate
was begged and given.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke de∣sires the Chan¦cellor to inter¦pose in his Be∣half.</NOTE> Upon this one Night He sent his Secretary, Mr.
<HI>Clifford,</HI> to the Chancellor, with whom He had never entered into any Dis∣pute,
with some Compliments and Expressions of Confidence in his Friend∣ship.
He professed “great Innocence and Integrity in all his Actions with
Reference to the King, though He might have been passionate and in∣discreet
in his Words; that there was a Conspiracy against his Life, and
that his Estate was granted or promised to Persons who had begged it:”
And in Conclusion He desired “that He would send him his Advice what
He should do, but rather, that He would permit him to come to him<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in the Evening to his House that He might confer with him.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor answered his Secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Advice to him.</NOTE> who was well known to him, “that
He might not confer with him till He rendered himself to the King; that
He was confident, having seen Testimony enough to convince him, that the
Duke was not innocent; and that He had much to answer for direspectful
Mention of the King, which would require much Acknowledgement and
Submission: But that He did not know that his Crimes were of that Mag∣nitude
as would put his Life into Danger; and that He was most confi∣dent
that there was no Conspiracy to take that from him, except his Faults
were of another Nature than they yet appeared to be; and which no<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Conspiracy, which He need not fear, could deprive him of. And He did
not believe that there had been any Attempt to beg his Estate: But He
was sure there had not been, nor could be, any Grant of it to any Man,
which must have passed by the Great Seal.” He did advise him, and de∣sired
him to follow his Advice, “that if He did know himself innocent as
to unlawful Actions and Designs, and that his Fault consisted only in in∣discreet
Words, as He seemed to confess; He would no longer aggravate
his Offence by contemning his Warrants, which He would not be long
able to avoid, but deliver himself into the Custody of the Lieutenant of
the <HI>Tower,</HI> which He was at Liberty by the Proclamation to do, and send<MILESTONE N="40"/>
then a Petition to the King, that He might be heard: And that when
He had done this, He would be ready and willing to do him all the Of∣fices
which would consist with his Duty.”</P>
<P>AND the next Day He gave his Majesty a particular Account of the Mes∣sage
which He had received, and of the Answer which He had returned;
which his Majesty approved, and shewed him a Letter that He had received
from the Duke that Morning, which seemed to have been written after his
Secretary had returned from the Chancellor. The Letter contained a large
Profession of his Innocence, and Complaint of the Power of his Enemies,
and a very earnest Desire “that his Majesty would give him Leave to speak<MILESTONE N="50"/>
with him, and then dispose of him as He pleased;” to which his Majesty
had answered to the Person who brought the Letter, who, as I remember,
<PB N="433" REF="439"/>
was Sir <HI>Robert Howard,</HI> “that the Duke need not fear the Power of any
Enemies, but would be sure to have Justice if He would submit to it.”</P>
<P>BUT his Majesty in his Discourse seemed to be as weary of the Prosecu∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King grows weary of the Prose∣cution.</NOTE>
as the Duke was of the concealing himself to avoid it, and to have
much Apprehension of his Interest and Power in the Parliament; and to be
troubled that the principal Witness, upon whose Testimony He relied, was
at that Time sick of the Smallpox, and in Danger of Death, and that
another retracted Part of that Evidence that He had given. In a Word;
his Majesty appeared less angry than He had been, and willing that an End
<MILESTONE N="10"/>should be put to the Business without any publick Prosecution. To which
the Chancellor made no other Answer, than “that no Advice could be
given with Preservation of his Majesty's Dignity, till the Duke rendered
himself into the Hand of Justice:” Which He was very unwilling to do,
and sent again to the Chancellor by Sir <HI>Robert Howard,</HI> to press him, “that
He might be admitted first to the King's Presence, and then sent to the
<HI>Tower.</HI>” The other told him, “that if the King were inclined to admit
him in that Manner, He would dissuade him from it, as a Thing disho∣nourable
to him after so long a Contest;” and repeated the same to him
that He said formerly to Mr. <HI>Clifford:</HI> Nor could He be persuaded by any
<MILESTONE N="20"/>others (for others did speak to him to the same Purpose) to recede a Tittle
from what He had insisted upon, “that He should put himself in the
<HI>Tower.</HI>” In all which He still gave the King a faithful Account of every
Word that passed: For He knew well that the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> endeavoured
to persuade the King, “that the Chancellor favoured the Duke, and de∣sired
that He should be at Liberty;” when at the same Time He used all
the Ways He could to have it insinuated to the Duke's Friends, “that He
knew Nothing of the Business, but that the whole Prosecution was made
by the Information and Advice of the Chancellor.”</P>
<P>IN the End, the Duke was persuaded to render himself to the <HI>Tower:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke sur∣renders him∣self.</NOTE>
<MILESTONE N="30"/>And from thence He sent a Petition to the King, who presently appeared
very well inclined to give over any farther Prosecution; which Alteration
all Men wondered at, nor could any Man imagine the Ground or Reason
of it. For though the principal Witness was dead, as the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>
declared He was, and that so much could not be proved as at the first
Discovery was reasonably suspected; yet the Meanness and Vileness of the
Persons with whom He kept so familiar Correspondence, the Letters between
them which were ready to be produced, the disrespectful and scandalous
Discourses which He often held concerning the King's Person, and many
other Particulars which had most inflamed the King, and which might fully
<MILESTONE N="40"/>have been proved, would have manifested so much Vanity and Presump∣tion
in the Duke, as must have lessened his Credit and Reputation with all
serious Men, and made him worthy of severe Censure. But whether the
King thought not fit to proceed upon the Words and scandalous Discourses,
which He thought would more disperse and publish the Scandals; or whe∣ther
He did really believe that it would disturb and obstruct all his Business
in Parliament; or what other Reason soever prevailed with his Majesty, as
without Doubt some other there were: His Majesty was very impatient to be
rid of the Business, and would have been easily persuaded to have given pre∣sent
Order for setting the Duke at Liberty, and so to silence all farther Dis∣course.
<MILESTONE N="50"/>But He was persuaded, “that that would most reflect upon his own
Honour, by making it believed, that there had been in Truth a foul Con∣spiracy
against the Person of the Duke, which would give him more Credit
in the Parliament and every where else;” for the King had not yet, with
<PB N="434" REF="440"/>
all his Indulgence, a better Opinion of his Affection and Fidelity than He
had before.</P>
<P>IN Conclusion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is exa∣mined at the Council-Board.</NOTE> it was resolved, “that the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> should
bring the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> to the Council-Chamber, his Majesty being
present; and there the Attorney and Solicitor General should open the
Charge that was against him, and read all the Examinations which had
been taken, and the Letters which had passed between them:” All which
was done. And the Duke denying “that He had ever written to that
Fellow, though He knew him well, and used to make himself merry
with him,” the Letter was produced (which the King and the Lord <HI>Ar∣lington,</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
who Both knew his Hand well, made no Doubt to be his Hand)
and delivered to the Duke; who, as soon as He cast his Eye upon it, said, “it
was not his Hand, but He well knew whose it was.” And being asked whose
Hand it was, He said, “it was his Sister's, the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> with
whom,” He said, “it was known that He had no Correspondence.”
Whereupon the King called for the Letter, and, having looked upon it, He
said, “He had been mistaken,” and confessed “that it was the Dutchess's
Hand;” and seemed much out of Countenance upon the Mistake:
Though the Letter gave still as much Cause of Suspicion, for it was as
strange that She should write to such a Fellow in a Style very obliging, and<MILESTONE N="20"/>
in Answer to a Letter; so that it seemed very reasonable still to believe, that
She might have written it upon his Desire and dictating.</P>
<P>THE Duke denied most of the Particulars contained in the Examinations:
And for the other Letters which had been written to him by the Fellow who
was in the <HI>Tower</HI> (whereof one was found in his Pocket sealed to be sent to the
Duke, and the others were Copies of others which had been sent; and the
Witness who was dead had delivered one of them into the Duke's own
Hand, and related at large the Kindness He expressed towards the Man,
and the Message He sent to him by him), He denied that He had ever re∣ceived
those Letters; but acknowledged, “that the Man came often to him,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
and pretended Skill in Horoscopes, but more in Distillations, in which the
Duke delighted and exercised himself, but looked upon the Fellow as
cracked in his Brain and fit only to be laughed at.” When the Duke was
withdrawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ea∣sily satisfied with his De∣fence.</NOTE> the King declared, “that He had been deceived in being con∣fident
that the Letter had been written by the Duke, which He now dis∣cerned
not to be his Hand, and He knew as well to have been written
by the Dutchess;” and thereupon seemed to think that there was No∣thing
else worth the examining: And so Order was given to set the Duke
at Liberty, who immediately went to his own House, and went not in some
Days afterwards to the Court.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>ABOUT this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor loses his Wife.</NOTE> or in few Days afterwards, a great Affliction befell the
Chancellor in his Domesticks, which prepared him to bear all the unex∣pected
Accidents that suddenly succeeded that more insupportable Misfor∣tune.
His Wife, the Mother of all his Children, and his Companion in all
his Banishment, and who had made all his former Calamities less grievous by
her Company and Courage, having made a Journey to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for her
Health, returned from thence without the Benefit She expected, yet without
being thought by the Physicians to be in any Danger; and within less than
three Days died: Which was so sudden, unexpected and irreparable a Loss
that He had not Courage to support; which Nobody wondered at who knew<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the mutual Satisfaction and Comfort They had in each other. And He
might possibly have sunk under it, if his Enemies had not found out a new
Kind of Consolation to him, which his Friends could never have thought of.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="441"/>
WITHIN few Days after his Wife's Death, the King vouchsafed to come
to his House to condole with him, and used many gracious Expressions to
him: Yet within less than a Fortnight the Duke (who was seldom a Day
without doing him the Honour to see him) came to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of York sent by the King to desire the Chancellor to resign.</NOTE> and with very
much Trouble told him, “that such a Day, that was past, walking with
the King in the Park, his Majesty asked him <HI>how the Chancellor did:</HI>
To which his Highness had made Answer, <HI>that He was the most disconsolate
Person He ever saw; and that He had lamented himself to him not only
upon the Loss of his Wife, but out of Apprehension that his Majesty had of
<MILESTONE N="10"/>late withdrawn his Countenance from him;</HI> to which his Majesty replied,
<HI>that He wondered He should think so, but that He would speak more to him
of that Subject the next Day.</HI> And that that Morning his Majesty had held
a long Discourse with him, in which He told him, <HI>that He had received
very particular and certain Intelligence, that when the Parliament should meet
again They were resolved to impeach the Chancellor, who was grown very
odious to them, not only for his having opposed them in all those Things upon
which They had set their Hearts, but that They had been informed that He
had proposed and advised their Dissolution; which had enraged them to that
Degree, that They had taken a Resolution as soon as They came together again
<MILESTONE N="20"/>to send up an Impeachment against him; which would be a great Dishonour
to his Majesty and obstruct all his Affairs, nor should He be able to protect
him or divert them: And therefore that it would be necessary for his Ser∣vice,
and likewise for the Preservation of the Chancellor, that He should de∣liver
up the Seal to him.</HI> All which He desired the Duke” (who confessed
that He had likewise received the same Advertisement) “to inform him of:
And <HI>that the Chancellor himself should choose the Way and the Manner of
delivering up the Seal, whether He would wait upon the King and give it
into his own Hand, or whether the King should send a Secretary or a Privy
Counsellor for it.</HI>” When the Duke had said all that the King had given
<MILESTONE N="30"/>him in Charge, He declared himself “to be much unsatisfied with the
King's Resolution; and that though He had received the same Adver∣tisement,
and believed that there was a real Combination and Conspiracy
against him, yet He knew the Chancellor's Innocence would not be frighted
with it.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was indeed as much surprised with this Relation, as He
could have been at the Sight of a Warrant for his Execution. He told the
Duke, “that He did not wonder that the King and his Highness had been
informed of such a Resolution; for that They who had contrived the
Conspiracy, and done all They could to make it prevalent, could best in∣form
<MILESTONE N="40"/>his Majesty and his Highness of what would probably fall out.” And
thereupon He informed the Duke “of what had passed at the Day of the
last Prorogation, and the Discourse and Promise Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> had
made to them, if They had a Mind to be rid of the Chancellor: But,”
He said, “that which only afflicted him was, that the King should have no
better Opinion of his Innocence and Integrity, than to conclude that such
a Combination must ruin him. And He was more troubled to find, that
the King himself had so terrible an Apprehension of their Power and
their Purposes, as if They might do any Thing They had a Mind to do.
He did not believe that He was so odious to the Parliament as He was
<MILESTONE N="50"/>reported to be; if He were, it was only for his Zeal to his Majesty's Ser∣vice,
and his insisting upon what his Majesty had resolved: But He was
confident that when his Enemies had done all that their Malice could
suggest against him, it would appear that the Parliament was not of their
<PB N="436" REF="442"/>
Mind. He wished that He might have the Honour to speak with the
King, before He returned any Answer to his Commands.” The Duke
was pleased graciously to reply, “that it was the Advice He intended to
give him, that He should desire it; and that He doubted not but that He
should easily prevail with the King to come to his House, whither He had
used so frequently to come, and where He had been so few Days before:”
And at this Time the Chancellor was not well able to walk; besides that it
was against the common Rules of Decency to go so soon out of his House.
When the Duke desired the King, that He would vouchsafe to go to <HI>Cla∣rendon-House;</HI>
his Majesty very readily consented to it, and said, “He would<MILESTONE N="10"/>
go thither the next Day.” But that and more Days passed: And then He
told the Duke, “that since He resolved to take the Seal, it would not be
so fit for him to go thither; but He would send for the Chancellor to
come to his own Chamber in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and He would go thither
to him.”</P>
<P>IN the mean Time it began to be the Discourse of the Court: And the
Dutchess, from whom the Duke had yet concealed it, came to be informed
of it; who presently went to the King with some Passion; and the Arch∣bishop
of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and the General accompanied her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Persons of Eminence interpose on his Behalf.</NOTE> who all befought
the King not to take such a Resolution. And many other of the Privy<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Council, with none of whom the Chancellor had spoken, taking Notice of
the Rumour, attended the King with the same Suit and Advice. To all
whom his Majesty answered, “that what He intended was for his Good,
and the only Way to preserve him.” He held longer Discourse to the Ge∣neral,
“that He did believe by what his Brother had told him, of the ex∣treme
Agony the Chancellor was in upon the Death of his Wife, that He
had himself desired to be dismissed from his Office;” and bade the Ge∣neral
“go to him, and bid him come the next Morning to his own Cham∣ber
at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and the King would come thither to him.” And the
General came to him with great Professions of Kindness, which He had<MILESTONE N="30"/>
well deserved from him, gave him a Relation of all that had passed with
the King, and concluded, “that what had been done had been upon Mis∣take;
and He doubted not, but that upon Conference with his Majesty
all Things would be well settled again to his Content;” which no Doubt
He did at that Time believe as well as wish.</P>
<P>UPON <HI>Monday,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancel∣lor attends the King at</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE> the twenty sixth of <HI>August,</HI> about Ten of the Clock in the
Morning, the Chancellor went to his Chamber in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where He had
not been many Minutes, before the King and Duke by themselves came
into the Room. His Majesty looked very graciously upon him, and made
him sit down;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference be∣tween them.</NOTE> when the other acknowledged “the Honour his Majesty had<MILESTONE N="40"/>
done him, in admitting him into his Presence before He executed a Re∣solution
He had taken.” He said, “that He had no Suit to make to
him, nor the least Thought to dispute with him, or to divert him from
the Resolution He had taken; but only to receive his Determination from
himself, and most humbly to beseech him to let him know what Fault He
had committed, that had drawn this Severity upon him from his Majesty.”
The King told him, “He had not any Thing to object against him; but must
always acknowledge, that He had always served him honestly and faith∣fully,
and that He did believe that never King had a better Servant: And
that He had taken this Resolution for his Good and Preservation, as well<MILESTONE N="50"/>
as for his own Convenience and Security; and that He had verily believed
that it had been upon his Consent and Desire.” And thereupon his Ma∣jesty
entered upon a Relation of all that had passed between him and the
<PB N="437" REF="443"/>
Duke, and “that He really thought his Brother had concurred with him in
his Opinion, as the only Way to preserve him.” In that Discourse the
Duke sometimes positively denied to have said Somewhat, and explained other
Things as not said to the Purpose his Majesty understood, or that He ever
implied that himself thought it fit.</P>
<P>THE Sum of what his Majesty said was, “that He was most assured by
Information that could not deceive him, that the Parliament was resolved,
as soon as They should come together again, to impeach the Chancellor;
and then that his Innocence would no more defend and secure him against
<MILESTONE N="10"/>their Power, than the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had defended himself against them:
And,” He said, “He was as sure, that his taking the Seal from him at
this Time would so well please the Parliament, that his Majesty should
thereby be able to preserve him, and to provide for the Passage of his own
Business, and the obtaining all that He desired.” He said, “He was sorry
that the Business had taken so much Air, and was so publickly spoken of,
that He knew not how to change his Purpose;” Which He seemed to
impute to the Passion of the Dutchess, that had divulged it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, “that He had not contributed to the Noise,
nor had imparted it to his own Children, till They with great Trouble
<MILESTONE N="20"/>informed him, that They heard it from such and such Persons,” whom
They named, “with some Complaint that it was concealed from them:
Nor did He then come in Hope to divert him from the Resolution He had
taken in the Matter itself.” He said, “He had but two Things to trou∣ble
him with. The first, that He would by no Means suffer it to be be∣lieved
that He himself was willing to deliver up the Seal; and that He
should not think himself a Gentleman, if He were willing to depart and
withdraw himself from the Office, in a Time when He thought his Ma∣jesty
would have Need of all honest Men, and in which He thought He
might be able to do him some Service. The second, that He could not
<MILESTONE N="30"/>acknowledge this Deprivation to be done in his Favour, or in Order to do
him Good; but on the Contrary, that He looked upon it as the greatest
Ruin He could undergo, by his Majesty's own declaring his Judgment
upon him, which would amount to little less than a Confirmation of
those many libellous Discourses which had been raised, and would upon
the Matter expose him to the Rage and Fury of the People, who had been
with great Artifice and Industry persuaded to believe, that He had been
the Cause and the Counsellor of all that They liked not. That He was so
far from fearing the Justice of the Parliament, that He renounced his Ma∣jesty's
Protection or Interposition towards his Preservation: And that though
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had undergone a Sentence He did not deserve,
yet He could not acknowledge their Cases to be parallel. That though
that great Person had never committed any Offence that could amount
to Treason, yet He had done many Things which He could not justify,
and which were Transgressions against the Law: Whereas He was not
guilty of any Action, whereof He did not desire the Law might be the
Judge. And if his Majesty himself should discover all that He had said
to him in Secret, He feared not any Censure that should attend it: If any
Body could charge him with any Crime or Offence, He would most wil∣lingly
undergo the Punishment that belonged to it.”</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>“BUT,” He said, “He doubted very much, that the throwing off
an old Servant, who had served the Crown in some Trust near thirty
Years (who had the Honour by the Command of his blessed Father, who
had left good Evidence of the Esteem He had of his Fidelity, to wait
<PB N="438" REF="444"/>
upon his Majesty when He went out of the Kingdom, and by the great
Blessing of God had the Honour to return with him again; which no
other Counsellor alive could say), on the Sudden, without any Suggestion
of a Crime, nay with a Declaration of Innocence, would call his Ma∣jesty's
Justice and good Nature into Question; and Men would not know
how securely to serve him, when They should see it was in the Power of
three or four Persons who had never done him any notable Service, nor
were in the Opinion of those who knew them best like to do, to dispose
him to so ungracious an Act.”</P>
<P>THE King seemed very much troubled and irresolute; then repeated<MILESTONE N="10"/>
“the great Power of the Parliament, and the clear Information He had of
their Purposes, which They were resolved to go through with right or
wrong; and that his own Condition was such, that He could not dispute
with them, but was upon the Matter at their Mercy.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, “it was not possible for his Majesty to have
any probable Assurance what the Parliament would do. And though He
knew He had offended some of the House of Commons, in opposing their
Desires in such Particulars as his Majesty thought were prejudicial to his
Service; yet He did not doubt but his Reputation was much greater in
Both Houses, than either of theirs who were known to be his Enemies,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and to have this Influence upon his Majesty, who were all known to be
guilty of some Transgressions, which They would have been called in
Question for in Parliament, if He had not very industriously, out of the
Tenderness He had for his Majesty's Honour and Service, prevented it;
Somewhat whereof was not unknown to his Majesty.” He concluded
“with beseeching him, whatever Resolution He took in his Particular, not
to suffer his Spirits to fall, nor himself to be dejected with the Apprehen∣sion
of the formidable Power of the Parliament, which was more or less or
Nothing, as He pleased to make it: That it was yet in his own Power to
govern them; but if They found it was in theirs to govern him, Nobody<MILESTONE N="30"/>
knew what the End would be.” And thereupon He made him a short
Relation of the Method that was used in the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second,
“when They terrified the King with the Power and the Purposes of the
Parliament, till They brought him to consent to that from which He could
not redeem himself, and without which They could have done him no
Harm.” And in the Warmth of this Relation He found a seasonable Op∣portunity
to mention the Lady with some Reflections and Cautions, which
He might more advisedly have declined.</P>
<P>AFTER two Hours Discourse the King rose without saying any Thing,
but appeared not well pleased with all that had been said;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King leaves him in Displeasure.</NOTE> and the Duke<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of <HI>York</HI> found He was offended with the last Part of it. The Garden, that
used to be private, had now many in it to observe the Countenance of the
King when He came out of the Room: And when the Chancellor re∣turned,
the Lady, the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Mr. <HI>May,</HI> looked together out
of her open Window with great Gaiety and Triumph, which all People
observed.</P>
<P>FOUR or five Days passed without any farther Proceedings, or the King's
declaring his Resolution: And in that Time the Chancellor's Concern was the
only Argument of the Court. Many of the Council, and other Persons of
Honour and Interest, presumed to speak with the King, and to give a very<MILESTONE N="50"/>
good Testimony of him, of his unquestionable Integrity, and of his Parts,
and Credit with the sober Part of the Nation: And to those his Majesty
always commended him, with Profession of much Kindness; but said, “He
<PB N="439" REF="445"/>
had made himself odious to the Parliament, and so was no more capable
to do him Service.” On the other Side the Lady and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>
and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> exceedingly triumphed, the last of which openly
and without Reserve declared, “that He had given the King Advice to remove
him as a Man odious to the Parliament, and that the King would be ruined
if He did it not; that He was so imperious that He would endure no
Contradiction;” with many other Reproaches to that Purpose. But except
those three, and Mr. <HI>May</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brounker,</HI> there seemed none of Name in
the Court who wished that the Resolution should be pursued.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THE Duke of <HI>York</HI> concerned himself wonderfully on the Chancellor's
Behalf,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>interests himself on the Chancellor's Behalf.</HI></NOTE> and with as much Warmth as any private Gentleman could express
on the Behalf of his Friend. He had great Indignation at the Behaviour of
Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brounker,</HI> that being his Servants They should
presume to shew so much Malice towards a Person They knew He had
Kindness for. And the former had so much Sense of it, that He resolved
to quit the Relation by which He had got vast Wealth, and came to him,
and told him, “that since He was Commissioner for the Treasury, He found
He should not be able to attend his Service so diligently as He ought to
do; and therefore desired his Highness's Favour in his Dismission, and
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that He would give him Leave to commend an honest Man to succeed him
in his Service:” To which his Highness shortly answered, “that He might
dispose himself as He would, with which He was well content; and
that He would choose another Secretary for himself without his Recom∣mendation.”
And his Highness presently went to the Chancellor, and
informed him of it, with Displeasure enough towards the Man, and much
Satisfaction that He was rid of him; and asked him “whom He would re∣commend
to him for a Secretary.” He told his Highness, “that if He
would trust his Judgment, He would recommend a Person to him, who
He believed was not unknown to him, and for whose Parts and Fidelity
<MILESTONE N="30"/>He would pass his Word, having had good Experience of Both in his
having served him as a Secretary for the Space of above seven Years;” and
named Mr. <HI>Wren.</HI> The Duke said, “He knew him well, being a Member
of the Royal Company, where He often heard him speak very intelligently,
and discerned him to be a Man of very good Parts, and therefore He would
very willingly receive him; and the rather, that He knew it would be
looked upon as an Evidence of his Kindness to him, which He would
always own and testify to all the World:” And within two Days after, He
received him into his Service with the King's Approbation, the Gentleman's
Abilities being very well known, and his Person much loved.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>IN this Suspension, the common Argument was, “that it was not now
the Question whether the Chancellor was innocent; but whether, when
the King had so long resolved to remove him, and had now proceeded so
far towards it, He should retract his Resolution, and be governed by his
Brother: It was enough that He was not beloved, and that the Court
wished him removed.” And Mr. <HI>Brounker</HI> openly declared, “that the
Resolution had been taken above two Months before; and that it would
not consist with his Majesty's Honour to be hectored out of it by his Bro∣ther,
who was wrought upon by his Wife's Crying.” And this Kind
of Argumentation was every Moment inculcated by the Lady and her Party:
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Insomuch as when the Duke made his Instances with all the Importunity
He could use, and put his Majesty in Mind “of many Discourses his Ma∣jesty
had formerly held with him, of the Chancellor's Honesty and Dis∣cretion,
conjuring him to love and esteem him accordingly, when his
<PB N="440" REF="446"/>
Highness had not so good an Opinion of him;” and complained, “that
now He had found by good Experience that He deserved that Character,
his Majesty would withdraw his Kindness from him, and rather believe others,
who He knew were his Enemies, than his own Judgment:” The King gave
no other Answer, than “that He had proceeded too far to retire; and that
He should be looked upon as a Child if He receded from his Purpose.”</P>
<P>AND so being reconfirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great Seal taken from the Chancellor.</NOTE> upon the thirtieth of <HI>August</HI> in the Year 1667
He sent Secretary <HI>Morrice,</HI> who had no Mind to the Employment, with a
Warrant under the Sign Manual, to require and receive the Great Seal;
which the Chancellor immediately delivered to him with all the Expressions<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of Duty to the King. And as soon as the Secretary had delivered it to the
King in his Closet, Mr. <HI>May</HI> went into the Closet, and fell upon his Knees,
and kissed his Majesty's Hand, telling him “that He was now King, which
He had never been before.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor believed that the Storm had been now over; for He had
not the least Apprehension of the Displeasure of the Parliament, or of any
Thing They could say or do against him: Yet He resolved to stay at his
House till it should meet (without going thither, which He was informed
would be ill taken), that He might not be thought to be afraid of being
questioned; and then to retire into the Country, and to live there very pri∣vately.<MILESTONE N="20"/>
And there was a Report raised without any Ground, that He in∣tended
to go to the House of Peers, and take his Precedence as Chancellor,
with which the King was much offended: But as soon as He heard of it, He
desired the Lord Chamberlain to assure his Majesty, “that He never in∣tended
any such Thing, nor would ever do any Thing that He believed
would displease him;” with which He seemed well satisfied.</P>
<P>HOWEVER a new Tempest was quickly raised against him. Many Persons
of Honour and Quality came every Day to visit him with many Expressions
of Affection and Esteem; and most of the King's Servants, except only
those few who had declared themselves his Enemies, still frequented his<MILESTONE N="30"/>
House with the same Kindness They had always professed: But They were
looked upon quickly with a very ill Countenance by the other Party, and
were plainly told, “that the King would take it ill from all his Servants who
visited the Chancellor;” though when some of them asked his Majesty,
“whether their visiting him, to whom They had been formerly much be∣holden,
would offend his Majesty;” He answered, “No, He had not
forbid any Man to visit him.” Yet it appeared more every Day, that
They were best looked on who forbore going to him, and the other found
themselves upon much Disadvantage; by which however many were not
discouraged.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE chief Prosecutors behaved themselves with more Insolence than was
agreeable to their Discretion: And the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who had long before
behaved himself with very little Courtesy towards all Persons whom He be∣lieved
to be well affected to the Chancellor, even towards Ambassadours
and other foreign Ministers, now when any of his Friends came to him for
the Dispatch of Business in his Office, asked them “when They saw the
Chancellor,” and bade them “go to him to put their Business into a Me∣thod.”
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had after his Enlargement visited
the Chancellor, and acknowledged the Civilities He had received from
him, came now again to the Court, and was received with extraordinary<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Grace by the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>restored to all his Employ∣ments.</HI></NOTE> and restored to all the Honours and Offices of which
He was deprived; and was informed and assured, “that all the Proceedings
which had been against him were upon the Information and Advice of the
<PB N="441" REF="447"/>
Chancellor:” And whatever He had spoken in Council was told him in
that Manner (and without the true Circumstances) that might make most
Impression on him.</P>
<P>ONE Day whilst that Matter was depending (which is not mentioned be∣fore)
the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> after He found the King had acquainted the
Chancellor with the Business, and shewed him the Information and Exami∣nations
which had been taken, proposed, there being more or the same Wit∣nesses
to be farther examined, “that the Chancellor might be present with
the rest who had been formerly employed at their examining:” Which the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>King seeming to consent to, the other desired to be excused, “for that the
Office He held never used to be subject to those Employments;” and in
the Debate added, “that if the Testimony of Witnesses made good all that
was suggested, and the Duke should be brought to a Trial, it might pro∣bably
fall out, that the King might command him to execute the Office
of High Steward, as He had lately done in the Trial of the Lord <HI>Morley;</HI>
and in that Respect it would be very incongruous for him to be present
at the Examinations.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is inflamed against the Chancellor.</NOTE> The Duke was now informed, without any of
the Circumstances, that the Chancellor had said that He was to be High
Steward at the Trial of the Duke.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>THE Duke, who always believed, and could not but upon the Matter
know, that the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> (with whom He had Enmity) had been very
solicitous in his Prosecution, had, after his having visited the Chancellor,
sent a Friend, whom He thought He would trust, to him “to desire him to
deal freely with him concerning the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> whom He knew to
be an Enemy to Both of them; and that He must have him examined
upon that Conspiracy, which He hoped He would not take ill:” To
which He answered, “that He neither would nor could be examined con∣cerning
any Thing that had been said or done in Council; but that He
would as his Friend, and to prevent his exposing himself to any new In∣convenience,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>very freely and faithfully assure him, that He did not be∣lieve
that there had been any Conspiracy against him, nor did know that
the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had done any Thing in the Prosecution, but what was
according to the Obligation and Duty of his Office; which Testimony,”
He said, “could proceed only from Justice, since He well knew that Lord
did not wish him well.” This Answer, it seems, or the Despair of draw∣ing
any other from him to his Purpose, disposed him to give entire Credit
to the other Information; and the King took great Pains to reconcile him
to the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who made many Vows to him of his future Service,
and desired his Protection:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And induced to concur in the Prosecution.</NOTE> And hereupon the Duke openly professed his
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Resolution of Revenge, and frankly entered into the Combination with the
Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> against the Chancellor.</P>
<P>BUT the Knowledge of all this did not give him much Trouble (so much
Confidence He had in his own Innocence, and so little Esteem of the Cre∣dit
and Interest of his Enemies), until He heard that the King himself ex∣pressed
great Displeasure towards him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ex∣presses great Displeasure against the Chancellor.</NOTE> and declared “that He had misbe∣haved
himself towards his Majesty, and that He was so imperious that He
would endure no Contradiction; that He had a Faction in the House of
Commons, that opposed every Thing that concerned his Majesty's Service,
if it were not recommended to them by him; and that He had given him
<MILESTONE N="50"/>very ill Advice concerning the Parliament, which offended him most:”
All which They to whom his Majesty said it divulged to others, that They
might thereby lessen the Chancellor's Credit and Interest. It is very true,
They who had taken all Advantages to alienate the King's Affections from
<PB N="442" REF="448"/>
him, had at first only proposed his Removal “as a Person odious to the
Parliament, and whom They were resolved to impeach, which would put
his Majesty into a Streight, either to renounce and desert an old Servant,
which would not be for his Honour, or, by protecting him, to deprive
himself of all those Benefits which He expected from the Parliament;
whereas the removing him would so gratify the Houses, that They would
deny Nothing that his Majesty should demand of them;” and his Majesty
did believe it the only Way to preserve him. But when They had prevailed
so far, and rendered themselves more necessary to him, They prosecuted
what They had begun with more visible Animosity, and told him, “that<MILESTONE N="10"/>
if the Parliament suspected that his Majesty retained still any Kindness to∣wards
him, They would not be satisfied with his Removal, but appre∣hend
that He would be again received into his Favour; and He would in
the mean Time have so much Credit in Both Houses, especially if He
sate in the House of Peers,” which They undertook to know He intended
to do, “that He would be able to obstruct whatsoever his Majesty desired:
And therefore it was necessary that his Majesty should upon all Occasions
declare, and that it should be believed, that He had so full a Prejudice
against him, that Nobody should have Cause to fear, that He would ever
again be received into any Trust.” And this disposed his Majesty to dis∣course<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to many in that Manner that is before set down.</P>
<P>AND when the Duke of <HI>York</HI> lamented to his Majesty the Reports which
were generally spread abroad, of the Discourses which He made to many
Persons of the Chancellor's Misbehaviour towards himself, and his own Dis∣pleasure
against him; the King denied many of the Particulars, as that
concerning his ill Counsel against the Parliament, which He denied to have
spoken: But said withal, “that if the Chancellor had done as He advised
him, and delivered up the Seal to him as of his own Inclination, all
would have been quiet. But since He insisted so much upon it, and
compelled him to send for it in that Manner, He was obliged in the<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Vindication of his Honour to give some Reasons for what He had done,
when other Men took upon them so loudly to commend the Chancellor,
and to justify his Innocence, not without some Reflection upon his own
Honour and Justice, which He could not but take very ill: But He should
not suffer” (He said) “for what other Men did, and that He would use
his two Sons as kindly as ever He had done.” And it must be always
acknowledged, that though great Importunity was used to his Majesty to
discharge his two Sons from his Service, as a Thing necessary by all the Rules
of Policy, not to suffer the Sons to remain so near his Person, when their
Father lay under so notorious a Brand of his Displeasure (in which They be∣lieved<MILESTONE N="40"/>
They had so far prevailed, that They took upon them to promise their
Places to other Men); yet the King positively refused to yield to them, and
continued his Favour still to them Both in the same Manner He had done.
And though He was long after persuaded to suspend his eldest Son from
waiting, under which Cloud He continued for many Months, yet at last He
was restored to his Place with Circumstances of extraordinary Favour and
Grace: Nor did his Majesty afterwards recede from his Goodness towards
either of them, notwithstanding all the Attempts which were made.</P>
<P>THE Parliament met upon the tenth of <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment meets: The King re∣flects on the Chancellor.</NOTE> when the King in a short
Speech told them, “that there had been some former Miscarriages, which had<MILESTONE N="50"/>
occasioned some Differences between him and them: But that He had now
altered his Counsels, and made no Question but that They should hence∣forward
agree, for He was resolved to give them all Satisfaction; and did
<PB N="443" REF="449"/>
not doubt but that They would supply his Necessities, and provide for
the Payment of his Debts;” with an Insinuation, “that what had been
formerly done amiss had been by the Advice of the Person whom He
had removed from his Counsels, and with whom He should not hereafter
advise.”</P>
<P>WHEN the House of Commons came together,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Me∣thods used to induce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Houses to thank the King for removing him.</NOTE> one <HI>Tomkins,</HI> a Man of
very contemptible Parts and of worse Manners (who used to be encouraged
by Men of Design to set some Motion on Foot, which They thought not fit
to appear in themselves till They discerned how it would take), moved the
<MILESTONE N="10"/>House, “that They might send a Message of Thanks to the King for his
gracious Expressions, and for the many good Things which He had done,
and particularly for his removing the Chancellor;” which was seconded
by two or three, but rejected by the House as a Thing unreasonable for
them who knew not the Motives which had disposed his Majesty: And so
a Committee was appointed to prepare such a Message as might be fit for
them to send. And the House of Lords the same Day sent to the King,
without consulting with the House of Commons, to give his Majesty Thanks
for the Speech He had made to them in the Morning, which commonly
used to be done. The King declared himself very much offended that the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Proposition in the House of Commons for returning Thanks to him had not
succeeded, and more that it had been opposed by many of his own Servants;
and commanded them “to press and renew the Motion: That his Honour
was concerned in it; and therefore He would expect Thanks, and would
take it very ill of any of his own Servants who refused to concur in it.”
Hereupon it was again moved: But notwithstanding all the Labour that had
been used contrary to all Custom and Privilege of Parliament, the Question
held six Hours Debate, very many speaking against the Injustice and Irregu∣larity
of it; They on the other Side urging the King's Expectation of it.
In the End the Question being put, it was believed the <HI>Noes</HI> were the greater
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Number: But the Division of the House was not urged for many Reasons;
and so the Vote was sent to the House of Lords, who were desired to con∣cur
with them.</P>
<P>BUT it had there a greater Contradiction. They had already returned
their Thanks to the King; and now to send again, and to add any Parti∣cular
to it, would be very incongruous and without any Precedent: And
therefore They would not concur in it. This Obstinacy very much dis∣pleased
the King: And He was persuaded by those who had hitherto pre∣vailed
with him, to believe that this Contradiction, if He did not master it,
would run through all his Business that should be brought into that House.
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Whereupon his Majesty reproached many of the Lords for presuming to op∣pose
and cross what was so absolutely necessary for his Service: And sent to
the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> “that He should in his Majesty's Name
command all the Bishops Bench to concur in it; and if They should refuse
it, He would make them repent it;” with many other very severe Repre∣hensions
and Animadversions. This being done in so extraordinary a Man∣ner,
the Duke of <HI>York</HI> told his Majesty, “how much it was spoken of and
wondered at:” To which his Majesty replied, “that his Honour was en∣gaged,
and that He would not be satisfied if Thanks were not returned to
him by Both Houses; and that it should go the worse for the Chancellor
<MILESTONE N="50"/>if his Friends opposed it.” And He commanded his Royal Highness that
He should not cross it, but was contented to dispense with his Attendance,
and gave him Leave to be absent from the Debate; which Liberty many
<PB N="444" REF="450"/>
others likewise took: And so when it was again moved, though it still was
confidently opposed, it was carried by a major Part, many being absent.</P>
<P>AND so Both Houses attended the King and gave him Thanks, which
his Majesty graciously received as a Boon He looked for, and said Somewhat
that implied that He was much displeased with the Chancellor; of which
some Men thought They were to make the best Use They could. And
therefore, after the King's Answer was reported to the House of Peers,
as of Course whatsoever the King says upon any Message is always reported,
it was proposed, “that the King's Answer might be entered into the Jour∣nal-Book;”
which was rejected, as not usual, even when the King him∣self<MILESTONE N="10"/>
spoke to Both Houses: Nor was what He now said entered in the House
of Commons. However when They had consulted together, finding that
They had not yet so particular a Record of the Displeasure against the Chan∣cellor,
as what He had said upon this Message did amount unto, They
moved the House again, “that it might be entered in the Book:” And it
was again rejected. All which would not serve the Turn; but the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> a third Time moved it, as a Thing the King expected: And
thereupon it was entered.</P>
<P>AND his Majesty now declared to his Brother and to many of the Lords,
that He had now all He desired, and that there should be no more done<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to the Chancellor.” And without Doubt the King had not at this Time
a Purpose to give any farther Countenance to the Animosity of his Enemies,
who thought that what was already done was too easy a Composition, and
told his Majesty, “that, if He were not prosecuted farther, He would gain
Reputation by it: For that the Manner in which all Votes had been yet
carried was rather a Vindication than Censure of him; and He would
shortly come to the House with more Credit to do Mischief, and to ob∣struct
whatsoever related to his Service. But that such Things would
be found against him, as soon as Men were satisfied that his Majesty had
totally deserted him (which yet They were not), that He would have no<MILESTONE N="30"/>
more Credit to do Good or Harm.” Hereupon there were several Cabals
entered into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persons sought after to fur∣nish Matter of Impeachment against him.</NOTE> who invited and sent for Persons of all Conditions, who had
had any Business depending before the Chancellor, or Charters passed the
Seal; and examined them whether He had not received Money from them,
or They were otherwise grieved by him, promising that They should receive
ample Reparation.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and some others with him, sent for Sir <HI>Ro∣bert
Harlow,</HI> who had the Year before gone to the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with the
Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who had much Friendship for him; yet after They came
thither, They grew unsatisfied with each other to that Degree, that the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who was Governour of those Islands, removed him from
the Office He had conferred on him, and sent him by the next Shipping into
<HI>England;</HI> where He arrived full of Vexation for the Treatment He had re∣ceived,
and willing to embrace any Opportunity to be revenged on the Go∣vernour.
Him the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> sent for, who He knew was privy
to all the Lord <HI>Willoughby's</HI> Counsels, and asked him, “what Money the
Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> had given the Chancellor for that Government” (for it
was well known that the Chancellor had been his chief Friend in procuring
that Government for him, and in discountenancing and suppressing those
who in <HI>England</HI> or in the Islands had complained of him), “and what<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Money He had received from those Islands; and that it was probable that
He had some Influence upon the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> towards the Disgrace
himself had undergone:” And added, “that He would do the King a
<PB N="445" REF="451"/>
very acceptable Service, in discovering any Thing of the Chancellor's Mis∣carriages,
of which his Majesty himself knew so much.” To which the
Gentleman answered, “that He had no Obligation to the Chancellor that
would restrain him from declaring any Thing that might be to his Preju∣dice;
but that He was not able to do it: Nor did He believe that He
had ever received any Money from the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> or from the
Islands.” And this Kind of Artifice and Inquisition was used to examine
all his Actions; and They who were known to be any Way offended with
him, or disobliged by him, were most welcome to them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>AFTER many Days spent in such close Contrivances and Combinations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> accuses him of High Treason in the House of Commens.</NOTE>
Mr. <HI>Seymour,</HI> a young Man of great Confidence and Boldness, stood up in
the House of Commons, and spake long and with great Bitterness against
the Chancellor, and “of his great Corruption in many Particulars, by which,”
He said, “He had gotten a vast Estate. That He had received great Sums
of Money from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for making a Settlement that every Body com∣plained
of, and that left that Kingdom in as great Distraction as ever it
had been. That He had gotten great Sums of Money indirectly and cor∣ruptly
from the Plantations, the Governments whereof He had disposed;
by Preferments in the Law and in the Church; and for the passing of
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Charters: And that He had received four thousand Pounds from the <HI>Ca∣nary</HI>
Company for the establishing that Company, which was so great and
general a Grievance to the Kingdom. And, which was above all this,
that He had traiterously persuaded, or endeavoured to persuade, the King
to dissolve the Parliament, and to govern by a standing Army; and
that He had said, <HI>that four hundred Country Gentlemen were only fit to
give Money, and did not understand how an Invasion was to be resisted.”</HI> He
mentioned many other odious Particulars “which” He said “He would prove,”
and therefore proposed, “that They would presently send up to the Lords
to accuse him of High Treason, and require that his Person might be se∣cured.”
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Some others seconded him with very bitter Invectives: And as
many gave another Kind of Testimony, and many Reasons which made it
improbable that He could be guilty of so many heinous Crimes; and “that
it would be unreasonable that He should be accused of High Treason by
the House, before such Proofs should be presented to them of Crimes,
that They had Reason to believe him guilty.” And so after many Hours
Debate, what They proposed for the present accusing him was rejected, and
a Committee appointed to consider of all Particulars which should be pre∣sented
against him; “upon reporting whereof to the House, it would give
such farther Order as should be just.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>THE confident Averment of so many Particulars, and the so positively
naming the particular Sums of Money which He had received, with Cir∣cumstances
not likely to be feigned; and especially the mentioning of many
Things spoken in Council, “which,” They said, “would be proved by
privy Counsellors;” and other particular Advices given in private to the
King himself, “which,” They implied, and confidently affirmed in private,
“the King himself would acknowledge;” made that Impression upon many
who had no ill Opinion of the Chancellor, and upon others who had always
thought well of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many advise him to make his Escape.</NOTE> and had in Truth Kindness for him, that of Both Sorts
several Messages of Advice were secretly sent to him, “that He would pre∣serve
<MILESTONE N="50"/>his Life by making an Escape, and transporting himself into foreign
Parts; for that it was not probable there could be so extreme and violent
a Prosecution, if They had not such Evidence against him as would com∣pass
their Ends.” To all which He answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which He re∣fuses to do.</NOTE> “that He would not give
<PB N="446" REF="452"/>
his Enemies that Advantage as to fly from them: And in the mean Time
desired his Friends to retain the good Opinion They had always had of
him, until They heard Somewhat proved that would make him unworthy
of it; and then He would be well contented They should withdraw it.”
And it appeared afterwards, that though some of his good Friends had ad∣vised
that He should secure himself by Flight, it proceeded from the Adver∣tisements
that They had received through other Hands, which came ori∣ginally
from his chiefest Enemies, who desired that He might appear to be
guilty by avoiding a Trial; and who confidently informed many Men,
“that the Impeachment was ready, and had been perused by the King,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and that his Majesty had with his Hand struck out an Article which re∣lated
to the Queen's Marriage, and another that concerned the Marriage
of the Duke; but that there was enough left to do the Business; and
that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> should be made High Steward for the
Trial.”</P>
<P>THESE Reports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Declaration of the Chancel∣lor's Innocence.</NOTE> being spread abroad, wrought upon the Duke to desire
the King, “that He would let him know what He did intend; and whe∣ther
He desired to have the Chancellor's Life, or that He should be con∣demned
to perpetual Imprisonment:” To which his Majesty protested, “that
He would have neither, but was well satisfied; and that He was resolved<MILESTONE N="20"/>
to stop all farther Prosecution against him,” which his Majesty likewise said
to many others. The Duke then asked the King, “whether the Chancellor
had ever given him Counsel to govern by an Army, or any Thing like it;
which,” He said, “was so contrary to his Humour, and to the Profes∣sions
which He had always made, and the Advices He had given him,
that if He were guilty of it, He should doubt his Sincerity in all other
Things:” To which his Majesty answered, “that He had never given
him such Counsel in his Life; but, on the Contrary, his Fault was that
He always insisted too much upon the Law.” Whereupon his Royal
Highness asked him, “whether He would give him Leave to say so to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
others;” and his Majesty replied, “with all his Heart.”</P>
<P>THE Duke then told it to his Secretary Mr. <HI>Wren,</HI> and to many other
Persons, and wished them to publish it upon any Occasion: Upon which it
was spread abroad, and Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> informed many of the Members of the
House of Commons of all that had passed between the King and the Duke
in that Discourse; which so much disheartened the violent Prosecutors, that
when the Committee met that was to present the Heads of a Charge against
him to the House, Nobody appeared to give any Evidence, so that They
adjourned without doing any Thing. Hereupon Sir <HI>Thomas Osborne,</HI> a De∣pendant
and Creature of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and who had told many<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Persons in the Country before the Parliament met, “that the Chancellor
would be accused of High Treason; and if He were not hanged, He
would be hanged himself;” this Gentleman went to the King, and in∣formed
him what Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> confidently reported in all Places, “which very
much dissatisfied that Party that desired to do him Service; so that They
knew not how to behave themselves:” To which his Majesty answered,
“that <HI>Wren</HI> was a lying Fellow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which He af∣terwards dis∣owns.</NOTE> and that He had never held any such Dis∣course
with his Brother.” This gave them new Courage, and They re∣solved
to call Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> to an Account for traducing the King. And his
Majesty expostulated with the Duke for what Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> had so publickly<MILESTONE N="50"/>
discoursed: And his Highness declared, “that Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> had pursued his
Order, his Majesty having not only said all that was reported, but having
given him Leave to divulge it;” to which the King made no other An∣swer,
<PB N="447" REF="453"/>
“but that He should be hereafter more careful of what He said to
him.”</P>
<P>ALL this begat new Pauses, and no Advance was made in many
Days; so that it was generally believed that there would be no farther Pro∣secution:
But the old Argument, that They were gone too far to retire, had
now more Force, because many Members of Both Houses were now joined
to the Party in declaring against the Chancellor, who would think them∣selves
to be betrayed and deserted if no more should be done against him.
And hereupon the Committee was again revived, that was appointed to pre∣pare
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Heads for a Charge, which sate many Days, there being little Debate
upon the Matter; for such of the Committee, who knew him well, were
so well pleased to find him accused of Nothing but what all the World did
believe him not guilty of, that They thought They could not do him more
Right, than to suffer all that was offered to pass, since there appeared no
Person that offered to make Proof of any Particular that was suggested. But
three or four Members of the House brought several Papers, containing Par∣ticulars
“which,” They said, “would be proved:” All which They reported
to the House.</P>
<P>THE Heads were;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>I. “THAT the Chancellor had traiterously,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of the Charge against him.</NOTE> about the Month of <HI>June</HI> last,
advised the King to dissolve the Parliament, and said <HI>there could be no far∣ther
Use of Parliaments; that it was a foolish Constitution and not fit to
govern by; and that it could not be imagined, that three or four hundred
Country Gentlemen could be either prudent Men or Statesmen:</HI> And <HI>that it
would be best for the King to raise a standing Army and to govern by that;</HI>
whereupon it being demanded how that Army should be maintained, He
answered, <HI>by Contribution and free Quarter, as the last King maintained
his Army in the War.</HI>”</P>
<P>II. “THAT He had, in the Hearing of several Persons, reported <HI>that the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>King was a Papist in his Heart, or popishly affected,</HI> or had used Words
to that Effect.”</P>
<P>III. “THAT He had advised the King to grant a Charter to the <HI>Canary</HI>
Company, for which He had received great Sums of Money.”</P>
<P>IV. “THAT He had raised great Sums of Money by the Sale of Offices
which ought not to be sold, and granted Injunctions to stop Proceedings
at Law, and dissolved them afterwards for Money.”</P>
<P>V. “THAT He had introduced an arbitrary Government into his Ma∣jesty's
several Plantations, and had caused such as had complained to his
Majesty and Privy Council of it to be imprisoned long for their Presump∣tion;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and that He had frustrated and rejected a Proposition that had
been made for the Preservation of <HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> and for
the reducing the <HI>French</HI> Plantations to his Majesty's Obedience.”</P>
<P>VI. “THAT He had caused <HI>Quo Warrantos</HI> to be issued out against most
Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> although the Charters were newly confirmed by
Act of Parliament, till They paid him good Sums of Money, and then
the <HI>Quo Warrantos</HI> were discharged.”</P>
<P>VII. “THAT He had received great Sums of Money for the Settlement
of <HI>Ireland.”</HI></P>
<P>VIII. “THAT He had deluded the King and betrayed the Nation in all
<MILESTONE N="50"/>foreign Treaties and Negotiations, especially concerning the late War.”</P>
<P>IX. “THAT He had procured his Majesty's Customs to be farmed at
Underrates, knowing them to be so; and caused many pretended Debts
<PB N="448" REF="454"/>
to be paid by his Majesty, to the Payment whereof his Majesty was not
in Strictness bound; for all which He had received great Sums of Money.”</P>
<P>X. “THAT He had received Bribes from the Company of Vintners, that
They might continue the Prices of their Wines, and might be freed from
the Penalties which They were liable to.”</P>
<P>XI. “THAT He had raised in a short Time a greater Estate than could
be lawfully got; and that He had gotten the Grant of several of the
Crown Lands contrary to his Duty.”</P>
<P>XII. “THAT He had advised and effected the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the
<HI>French</HI> King, for less Money than the Ammunition, Artillery and Stores<MILESTONE N="10"/>
were worth.”</P>
<P>XIII. “THAT He had caused the King's Letters under the Great Seal to
one Dr. <HI>Crowther</HI> to be altered, and the Enrolment thereof to be rased.”</P>
<P>XIV. “THAT He had in an arbitrary Way examined and drawn into
Question divers of his Majesty's Subjects concerning their Lands and Pro∣perties,
and determined thereof at the Council-Table, and stopped the
Proceedings at Law, and threatened some that pleaded the Statute of
17 <HI>Car.</HI>”</P>
<P>XV. “THAT He was a principal Author of that fatal Counsel of dividing
the Fleet in <HI>June</HI> 1666.”<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE Committee reported another Article for his Charge, which was, “that
He had kept Correspondence with <HI>Cromwell</HI> during the Time of the King's
being beyond the Seas, and had sent over his Secretary to him, who was shut
up with him for many Hours:” But there were many Members of the
House, who wished it had been true, knew well enough that foolish Ca∣lumny
had been examined at <HI>Paris</HI> during the Time that his Majesty re∣sided
there, when Persons of the highest Degree were very desirous to have
kindled a Jealousy in the King of the Chancellor's Fidelity; and that the
Scandal appeared so gross and impossible, that his Majesty had then published
a full Vindication of his Innocence; with a farther Declaration, “that when<MILESTONE N="30"/>
it should please God to restore him to his own Dominions, He should re∣ceive
such farther Justice and Reparation, as the Laws would enable him
to procure.” And it was well known to divers of the Members present,
that the Persons who were suborned in that Conspiracy had acknowledged
it since the King's Return; and the Persons themselves who had suborned
them had confessed it, and begged the Chancellor's Pardon: Of all which
his Majesty had been particularly and fully informed. And that it might
be no more ripped up or looked into, They seemed to reject it as being in∣cluded
under the <HI>Act of Indemnity,</HI> which They would have left him to
have pleaded for the Infamy of it, if They had not very well known the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Grossness of the Scandal.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Fierceness of the Malice that was contracted against him
was enough known and taken Notice of, yet the Heads for the Charge,
which upon so much Deliberation were prepared and offered to the House
against him, were of such a Nature, that all Men present did in their own
Conscience acquit him: And therefore it was generally believed the Prose∣cutors
would rather have acquiesced with what They had done to blast his
Reputation, than have proceeded farther to bring him to answer for himself.
But They had gone too far to retire. And They who had first wrought
upon the King, only by persuading him, “that there was so universal a<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Hatred against the Chancellor, that the Parliament would the first Day
accuse him of High Treason; and that the removing him from his
Office was the only Way to preserve him, except He would in such a
<PB N="449" REF="455"/>
Conjuncture, and when He had so much Need of the Parliament, sacri∣fice
all his Interest for the Protection of the Chancellor” (and this was
the sole Motive that had prevailed with him, as his Majesty not only as∣sured
him the last Time He spake with him, with many gracious Expres∣sions,
but at large expressed it to very many Persons of Honour, who
endeavoured to dissuade him from pursuing that Counsel, “that it was
the only Expedient for the Chancellor's Preservation,” with as great a
Testimony of his Integrity and the Services He had done him as could be
given): The same Men now importuned him “to prosecute with all his
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King per∣suaded to en∣courage the Prosecution.</NOTE> and to let those of his Servants, and others who regarded his
Commands, know that They could not serve him and the Chancellor
together; and that He should look upon their adhering to him as the
abandoning his Majesty's Service. That the Chancellor had so great a
Faction in Both Houses, that no Proposition on his Majesty's Behalf would
have Effect; and that He would shortly come to the House of Peers, and
obstruct all Proceedings there.”</P>
<P>THIS prevailed so far that They resumed their former Courage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings against him in the House of Commons.</NOTE> and pressed
“that He might be accused by the House of Commons of High Treason:
Upon which the Lords would presently commit him to the <HI>Tower;</HI> and then
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Nobody would have any longer Apprehension of his Power to do Hurt.”
Hereupon They resolved again to consider the several Heads of the Charge
They had provided, to see if They could find any one upon which They could
ground an Accusation of High Treason. They spent a whole Day upon the
first Head, which They thought contained enough to do their Work, it con∣taining
the most unpopular and ungracious Reproach that any Man could
lie under; “that He had designed a standing Army to be raised, and to go∣vern
the Kingdom thereby; He advised the King to dissolve the present
Parliament, to lay aside all Thoughts of Parliaments for the future, to go∣vern
by military Power, and to maintain the same by free Quarter and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Contribution.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor had been bred of the Gown; and in the first War, in
which the last King had been involved by a powerful Rebellion, was known
always to have advanced and embraced all Overtures towards Peace. Since
the King's Return He laboured Nothing more, than that his Majesty might
enter into a firm Peace with all his Neighbours, as most necessary for the
reducing his own Dominions into that Temper of Subjection and Obedience,
as they ought to be in. It was notorious to all Men, that He had most
passionately dissuaded the War with <HI>Holland,</HI> with much Disadvantage to
himself; and that no Man had taken so much Pains as He to bring the pre∣sent
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Peace to pass, which at that Time was grateful to all Degrees of Men:
And, in a Word, that He had no Manner of Interest or Credit with the
Soldiers; but was looked upon by them all, as an Enemy to the Privileges
which They required, of being exempted from the ordinary Rules of Jus∣tice,
in which He always opposed them.</P>
<P>BUT let the Improbability of this Charge be what it would, there were
Persons of the House who pretended that it should be fully proved; and so
the Question was only, “whether upon it They should charge him with
an Accusation of Treason:” And after a Debate of eight Hours, it was
declared by all the Lawyers of the House, “that how foul soever the Charge
<MILESTONE N="50"/>seemed to be, yet it contained no High Treason;” and in that Conclu∣sion
They at last concurred who were most relied upon to support the Ac∣cusation.
But when the Speaker directed the Order to be drawn, “that
the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> should not be accused of High Treason,” it was al∣leged
<PB N="450" REF="456"/>
that the Order was only to relate to that first Head; some Men de∣claring,
“that though that Article had missed him, yet there were others
which would hit him:” And so the Night being come, the farther De∣bate
was adjourned to another Day.</P>
<P>WHEN the Day appointed came (in which Interval all imaginable Pains
and Arts were used, by Threats and Promises, to allure and terrify as many
as could be wrought upon, either to be against the Chancellor, or to be ab∣sent
at the next Debate that concerned him), upon reading the several other
Heads as they had been presented from the Committee, it appeared to all
Men, that though all that was alleged were proved, the Whole would not<MILESTONE N="10"/>
amount to make him guilty of High Treason. And They got no Ground
by throwing Aspersions upon him upon the several Arguments, which They
did with extraordinary License who were known to be his Enemies; for
thereby other Men of much better Reputations, and who had no Relation
to the Chancellor, took Occasion to answer and contradict their Calumnies,
and to give him such a Testimony, as made him another Man than They
would have him understood to be; and their Testimony had more Credit:
So that They declined the Pursuit of that License, and intended wholly the
Discovery of the Treason, since no other Accusation would serve their
Turn.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>WHEN They had examined all their Store, They pitched at last upon
that Head, “that He had deluded and betrayed his Majesty and the Nation
in all foreign Treaties and Negotiations relating to the late War:” Which
when read and considered, it was said, “that in those general Expressions
there was not enough contained upon which They could accuse him of
High Treason, except it were added, that being a Privy Counsellor He
had discovered the King's secret Counsels to the Enemy.” Which was no
sooner said, than a young confident Man, the Lord <HI>Vaughan,</HI> Son to the
Earl of <HI>Carbery,</HI> a Person of as ill a Face as Fame, his Looks and his Man∣ners
Both extreme bad, asked for the Paper that had been presented from<MILESTONE N="30"/>
the Committee, and with his own Hand entered into that Place those Words,
“that being a Privy Counsellor He had discovered the King's Secrets to the
Enemy,” which He said He would prove; whilst many others whispered
into the Ears of those who sate next to them, “that He had discovered all
the secret Resolutions to the King of <HI>France,</HI> which,” They said, “was
the Ground of the King's Displeasure towards him.” Upon this confident
Insinuation from Persons who were near the Person of his Majesty, and
known to have much Credit with him; and the positive Averment by a
Member, “that the disclosing the King's Secrets to the Enemy,” which No∣body
could deny to be Treason, “would be positively and fully proved<MILESTONE N="40"/>
against him,” and the rather because no Man believed it to be true; it was
voted, “that They should impeach him of High Treason in the usual
Manner to the House of Peers.” Whereupon Mr. <HI>Seymour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Seymour <HI>accuses him of High Treason at the Bar of the House of Lords.</HI></NOTE> who had ap∣peared
very violent against him, was sent up to the Lords; and at the Bar
He accused <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> of High Treason and other Crimes
and Misdemeanors, and desired “that He might be sequestered from that
House, and his Person secured.”</P>
<P>AND as soon as He was withdrawn, some of the Lords moved, “that
He might be sent for:”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in that House concern∣ing his Com∣mitment.</NOTE> And now the Warmth that had been so long
within the Walls of the House of Commons appeared in the House of Peers.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Many of the Lords, who were not thought much inclined to the Per∣son
of the Chancellor, represented, “that the Consequence of such a Pro∣ceeding
would reflect to the Prejudice of every one of the Peers. If
<PB N="451" REF="457"/>
upon a general Accusation from the House of Commons of High Treason,
without mentioning any Particular, They should be obliged to commit
any Peer; any Member that House should be offended with, how unjustly
soever, might be removed from the Body: Which would be a greater
Disadvantage than the Members of the House of Commons were liable to.”
And therefore They advised, “that They should for Answer let the House
of Commons know, that They would not commit the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>
until some particular Charge was exhibited against him.”</P>
<P>ON the other Side, it was urged with much Passion, “that They ought
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to comply with the House of Commons in satisfying their Requests, ac∣cording
to former Precedents:” And the Case of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI>
and some other Cases in that Parliament, were cited; which gave those who
were of another Mind Opportunity to inveigh against that Time, and the
accursed Precedents thereof, which had produced so many and great Mis∣chiefs
to the Kingdom. They put them in Mind, “that They had com∣mitted
eleven Bishops at one Time for High Treason, only that They might
be removed from the House, whilst a Bill passed against their having Votes
any more in that House, which was no sooner passed than They were set at
Liberty; which had brought great Scandal and great Reproach upon the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Honour and Justice of the Parliament: And that Both those Bills, for the
Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> and for the excluding the Bishops out
of the House of Peers, stand at present repealed by the Wisdom and Au∣thority
of this Parliament.” In a Word, after many Hours Debate with
much Passion, either Side adhering obstinately to their Opinion, no Resolu∣tion
was taken; but the House adjourned, without so much as putting the
Question, to the next Day.</P>
<P>FROM the Time of the Parliament's coming together, and after the King's
Displeasure was generally taken Notice of, many of the Chancellor's Friends
advised him to withdraw, and transport himself into foreign Parts; and some
<MILESTONE N="30"/>very near the King, and who were Witnesses of the very great Displeasure
his Majesty every Day expressed towards him, were of the same Opinion:
But He positively refused so to do, and resolved to trust to his Innocence,
which He was sure must appear.</P>
<P>THE Debate continued still between the two Houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences between the Houses.</NOTE> which would en∣tertain
no other Business: The House of Commons in frequent Conferences
demanding the Commitment of the Chancellor; and the major Part of the
House of Peers, notwithstanding all the indirect Prosecution and Interpo∣sition
from the Court, remaining as resolved not to commit him. In this
unhappy Conjuncture, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who expressed great Affection and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Concernment for the Chancellor, fell sick of the Smallpox; which proved
of great Disadvantage to him. For not only many of the Peers who were
before restrained by their Respect to him, and supported by his Countenance
in the Debates, either changed their Minds, or absented themselves from the
House; but the General, who had always professed great Friendship to the
Chancellor, who had deserved very well from him, and had endeavoured to
dissuade the King from withdrawing his Favour from him with all possible
Importunity, was now changed by the unruly Humour of his Wife, and
the frequent Instances of the King; and made it his Business to solicit and
dispose the Members of Both Houses, with many of whom He had great
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Credit, “no longer to adhere to the Chancellor, since the King resolved to
ruin him, and would look upon all who were his Friends as Enemies to
his Majesty.” Notwithstanding all which, the major Part by much of the
House of Peers continued still firm against his Commitment: With which
<PB N="452" REF="458"/>
the King was so offended, that there were secret Consultations of sending a
Guard of Soldiers, by the General's Authority, to take the Chancellor out
of his House, and to send him to the <HI>Tower;</HI> whither Directions were al∣ready
sent what Lodging He should have, and Caution given to the Lieu∣tenant
of the <HI>Tower,</HI> who was thought to have too much Respect for the
Chancellor, “that He should not treat him with more Civility than He did
other Prisoners.”</P>
<P>HE had many Friends of the Council and near the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor is again ad∣vised to with∣draw.</NOTE> who adver∣tised
him of those and all other Intrigues, and thereupon renewed their Im∣portunity
that He would make his Escape; and some of them undertook to<MILESTONE N="10"/>
know, and without Question did believe, “that his withdrawing would be
grateful to the King,” who every Day grew more incensed against him,
for the Obstinacy his Friends in Both Houses expressed on his Behalf. They
urged “the ill Condition He must in a short Time be reduced to, wherein
his Innocence would not secure him; for it was evident that his Enemies
had no Purpose or Thought of bringing him to a Trial, but to keep him
always in Prison, which They would in the End one Way or other bring
to pass: Whereas He might now easily transport himself, and avoid all
the other Inconveniences.” And They undertook to know, “that if He
were gone, there would be no farther Proceeding against him.”<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THERE could not be a more terrifying or prevalent Argument used to∣wards
his withdrawing, than that of a Prison; the Thought and Apprehen∣sion
whereof was more grievous to him than of Death itself, which He was
confident would quickly be the Effect of the other. However He very re∣solutely
refused to follow their Advice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">But refuses.</NOTE> and urged to them “the Advantage
He should give his Enemies, and the Dishonour He should bring upon
himself, by flying, in having his Integrity condemned, if He had not the
Confidence to defend it.” He said, “He could now appear, wherever
He should be required, with an honest Countenance, and the Courage of
an innocent Man: But if He should be apprehended in a Disguise running<MILESTONE N="30"/>
away, which He could not but expect by the Vigilance of his Enemies
(since He could not make any Journey by Land, being at that Time very
weak and infirm), He should be very much out of Countenance, and
should be exposed to publick Scorn and Contempt. And if He should
make his Escape into foreign Parts, it would not be reasonable to expect
or imagine that his Enemies, who had so far aliened the King's Affec∣tion
from him, and in Spite of his Innocence prevailed thus far, would
want Power to prosecute the Advantage They should get by his Flight,
which would be interpreted as a Confession of his Guilt; and thereupon
They would procure such Proceedings in the Parliament, as might ruin<MILESTONE N="40"/>
both his Fortune and his Fame.”</P>
<P>HIS Friends, how unsatisfied soever with his Resolution, acquiesced for
the present, after having first prevailed with him to write himself to the
King; which He did, though without any Hope that it would make any
Impression upon him. He could not comprehend or imagine from what
Fountain, except the Power of the great Lady with the Conjunction of his
known Enemies, which had been long without that Effect, that Fierceness
of his Majesty's Displeasure could proceed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King of∣fended with him about the Duke of</HI> Rich∣mond's <HI>Mar∣riage.</HI></NOTE> He had, before this Storm sell
upon him, been informed by a Person of Honour who knew the Truth of
it, “that some Persons had persuaded the King, <HI>that the Chancellor had a<MILESTONE N="50"/>
principal Hand in the Marriage of the Duke of</HI> Richmond, with which his
Majesty was offended in the highest Degree: And the Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> had
reported it with all Confidence.” Whereupon the Chancellor had expos∣tulated
<PB N="453" REF="459"/>
with the Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> whom He knew to be his secret Enemy,
though no Man made more outward Professions to him: But He denied
He had reported any such Thing. And then He took Notice to the King
himself of the Discourse, and desired to know, “whether any such Story had
been represented to his Majesty, since there was not the least Shadow of
Truth in it:” To which the King answered with some Dryness; “that no
such Thing had been told to him.” Yet now He was assured, “that
that Business stuck most with his Majesty, and that from that Suggestion
his Enemies had gotten Credit to do him the worst Offices; and his Ma∣jesty
<MILESTONE N="10"/>complained much of the Insolence with which He used to treat him
in the Agitation and Debate of Business, if He differed from him in Opi∣nion.”
Upon these Reasons He writ this Letter in his own Hand to the
King, which was delivered to him by the Lord Keeper, who was willing
to perform that Office. The Letter was in these Words.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“MAY it please your Majesty,”</OPENER>
<P>“I AM so broken under the daily insupportable Instances of your Majesty's
terrible Displeasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Letter to the King upon that Subject.</NOTE> that I know not what to do, hardly what to wish.
The Crimes which are objected against me, how passionately soever pur∣sued,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and with Circumstances very unusual, do not in the least Degree
fright me. God knows I am innocent in every Particular as I ought to
be; and I hope your Majesty knows enough of me to believe that I had
never a violent Appetite for Money, that could corrupt me. But alas!
your Majesty's declared Anger and Indignation deprives me of the Comfort
and Support even of my own Innocence, and exposes me to the Rage and
Fury of those who have some Excuse for being my Enemies; whom I
have sometimes displeased, when (and only then) your Majesty believed
them not to be your Friends. I hope They may be changed; I am sure
I am not, but have the same Duty, Passion and Affection for you, that I
<MILESTONE N="30"/>had when You thought it most unquestionable, and which was and is as
great as ever Man had for any mortal Creature. I should die in Peace
(and truly I do heartily wish that God Almighty would free you from fur∣ther
Trouble, by taking me to himself), if I could know or guess at the
Ground of your Displeasure, which I am sure must proceed from your
believing, that I have said or done Somewhat I have neither said nor done.
If it be for any Thing my Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> hath reported, which I know He
hath said to many, though being charged with it by me He did as positively
disclaim it; I am as innocent in that whole Affair, and gave no more Advice
or Counsel or Countenance in it, than the Child that is not born: Which
<MILESTONE N="40"/>your Majesty seemed once to believe, when I took Notice to you of the
Report, and when You considered how totally I was a Stranger to the
Persons mentioned, to either of whom I never spake Word, or received
Message from either in my Life. And this I protest to your Majesty is
true, as I have Hope in Heaven: And that I have never wilfully offended
your Majesty in my Life, and do upon my Knees beg your Pardon for any
over-bold or saucy Expressions I have ever used to you; which, being a
natural Disease in old Servants who have received too much Countenance,
I am sure hath always proceeded from the Zeal and Warmth of the most
sincere Affection and Duty.”</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>“I HOPE your Majesty believes, that the sharp Chastisement I have re∣ceived
from the best-natured and most bountiful Master in the World, and
whose Kindness alone made my Condition these many Years supportable,
hath enough mortified me as to this World; and that I have not the
<PB N="454" REF="460"/>
Presumption or the Madness to imagine or desire ever to be admitted to
any Employment or Trust again. But I do most humbly beseech your
Majesty by the Memory of your Father, who recommended me to you
with some Testimony, and by your own gracious Reflection upon some
one Service I may have performed in my Life, that hath been acceptable
to you; that You will by your Royal Power and Interposition put a Stop
to this severe Prosecution against me, and that my Concernment may give
no longer Interruption to the great Affairs of the Kingdom; but that I
may spend the small Remainder of my Life, which cannot hold long, in
some Parts beyond the Seas, never to return; where I will pray for your<MILESTONE N="10"/>

</LETTER>
<P>THE King was in his Cabinet when the Letter was delivered to him;
which as soon as He had read, He burned in a Candle that was on the Ta∣ble,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and only said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ex∣presses a De∣sire of his withdrawing.</NOTE> “that there was Somewhat in it that He did not un∣derstand,
but that He wondered that the Chancellor did not withdraw
himself;” Of which the Keeper presently advertised him, with his earnest
Advice that He would be gone.</P>
<P>THE King's Discourse was according to the Persons with whom He con∣ferred.
To those who were engaged in the violent Prosecution He spake with
great Bitterness of him, repeating many particular Passages, in which He had
shewed much Passion because his Majesty did not concur with him in what
He advised. To those who He knew were his Friends He mentioned him
without any Bitterness, and with some Testimony of his having served him<MILESTONE N="30"/>
long and usefully, and as if He had Pity and Compassion for him: Yet
“that He wondered that He did not absent himself, since it could not but
be very manifest to him and to all his Friends, that it was not in his
Majesty's Power to protect him against the Prejudice that was against him
in Both Houses; which,” He said, “could not but be increased by the
Obstruction his particular Concernment gave to all publick Affairs in this
Conjuncture; in which,” He said, “He was sure He would prevail at
last.” All these Advertisements could not prevail over the Chancellor
for the Reasons mentioned before; though He was very much afflicted at
the Division between the two Houses, the evil Consequence whereof He well<MILESTONE N="40"/>
understood, and could have been well content that the Lords would have
consented to his Imprisonment.</P>
<P>THE Bishop of <HI>Hereford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Bishop of</HI> Hereford <HI>sent to advise him to leave the Kingdom.</HI></NOTE> who had been very much obliged to the Chan∣cellor,
and throughout this whole Affair had behaved himself with very sig∣nal
Ingratitude to him, and thereby got much Credit in the Court, went
to the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who was known to be a fast and unshaken
Friend to the Chancellor; and made him a long Discourse of what the King
had said to him, and desired him “that He would go with him to his House;”
which He presently did, and, leaving him in a Room, went himself to the
Chancellor, and told him what had passed from the Bishop of <HI>Hereford,</HI><MILESTONE N="50"/>
“who was in the next Room to speak with him, but would not in direct
Words to him acknowledge that He spake by the King's Order or Appro∣bation;
but that He had confessed so much to him with many Circum∣stances,
<PB N="455" REF="461"/>
and that the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had been present.”
The Chancellor had no Mind to see or speak with the Bishop, who
had carried himself so unworthily towards him, and might probably misre∣port
any Thing He should say: But He was overruled by the other Bishop;
and so They went Both into the next Room to him.</P>
<P>THE Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI> in some Disorder, as a Man conscious to himself
of some Want of Sincerity towards him, desired “that He would believe that
He would not at that Time have come to him, with whom He knew He was
in some Umbrage, if it were not with a Desire to do him Service, and if He
<MILESTONE N="10"/>had not a full Authority for whatsoever He said to him.” Then He enlarged
himself in Discourse more involved and perplexed, without any Mention of the
King, or the Authority He had for what He should say; the Care to avoid
which was evidently the Cause of the Want of Clearness in all He said.
But the Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> supplied it by relating all that He had said
to him: With which though He was not pleased, because the King and
others were named, yet He did not contradict it; but said, “He did not
say that He was sent by the King or spake by his Direction, only <HI>that He
could not be so mad as to interpose in such an Affair without full Authority
to make good all that He should promise.</HI>” The Sum of all was, “that
<MILESTONE N="20"/>if the Chancellor would withdraw himself into any Parts beyond the Seas,
to prevent the Mischiefs that must befall the Kingdom by the Division and
Difference between the two Houses; He would undertake upon his Sal∣vation,”
which was the Expression He used more than once, “that He
should not be interrupted in his Journey; and that after He should be
gone, He should not be in any Degree prosecuted, or suffer in his Ho∣nour
or Fortune by his Absence.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which He re∣fuses to do without re∣ceiving a Com∣mand from his Majesty.</NOTE> “that He well understood what He must
suffer by withdrawing himself, and so declining the Trial, in which his
Innocence would secure him, and in the mean Time preserve him from
<MILESTONE N="30"/>being terrified with the Threats and Malice of his Enemies: However He
would expose himself to that Disadvantage, if He received his Majesty's
Commands to that Purpose, or if He had but a clear Evidence that his
Majesty did wish it, as a Thing that He thought might advance his Ser∣vice.
But without that Assurance, which He might receive many Ways
which could not be taken Notice of, He could not with his Honour
or Discretion give his implacable Enemies that Advantage against him,
when his Friends should be able to allege Nothing in his Defence.”</P>
<P>THE Bishop replied, “that He was not allowed to say that his Majesty
required or wished it, but that He could not be so mad as to undertake
<MILESTONE N="40"/>what He had promised, without sufficient Warrant;” and repeated again
what He had formerly said. To which the other answered, “that the Vi∣gilance
and Power of his Enemies was well known: And that though the
King might in Truth wish that He were safe on the other Side of the Sea,
and give no Direction to interrupt or trouble him in his Journey; yet that
it was liable to many Accidents in Respect of his Weakness and Infirmity,”
which was so great at that Time, that He could not walk without being
supported by one or two; so that He could not be disguised to any Body
that had ever known him. Besides that the Pain He was already in,
and the Season of the Year, made him apprehend, that the Gout might so
<MILESTONE N="50"/>seize upon him within two or three Days, that He might not be able to
move: And so the Malice of those who wished his Destruction might very
probably find an Opportunity, without or against the King's Consent, to
apprehend and cast him into Prison, as a Fugitive from the Hand of Justice.
<PB N="456" REF="462"/>
For the Prevention of all which, which no Man could blame him for appre∣hending,
He proposed, “that He might have a Pass from the King, which
He would not produce but in such an Exigent: And would use all the
Providence He could, to proceed with that Secrecy that his Departure
should not be taken Notice of; but if it were, He must not be without
such a Protection, to preserve him from the present Indignities to which
He must be liable, though possibly it would not protect him from the
Displeasure of the Parliament.” The Bishop thought this Proposition to
be reasonable, and seemed confident that He should procure the Pass: And
so that Conference ended.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE next Day the Bishop sent Word, “that the King could not grant
the Pass, because if it should be known, by what Accident soever, it
would much incense the Parliament: But that He might as securely go
as if He had a Pass;” which moved no farther with him, than his former
Undertaking had done. Nor could the Importunity of his Children, or the
Advice of his Friends, persuade him to depart from his Resolution.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Time of the Chancellor's Disgrace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Ambassadour urges him to retire to</HI> France.</NOTE> <HI>Monfieur Ruvigny</HI> arrived
at <HI>London</HI> as Envoy Extraordinary from the <HI>French</HI> King, and came the
next Day after the Seal was taken from him. He was a Person well known
in the Court, and particularly to the Chancellor, with whom He had been<MILESTONE N="20"/>
formerly assigned to treat upon Affairs of Moment, being of the Religion
and very nearly allied to the late Earl of <HI>Southampton.</HI> And as these Consi∣derations
were the chief Motives that He was made Choice of for the present
Employment, so the chief Part of his Instructions was to apply himself to
the Chancellor, through whose Hands it was known that the whole Treaty
that was now happily concluded, and all the Preliminaries with <HI>France,</HI> had
entirely passed. When He found that the Conduct of Affairs was quite
changed, and that the Chancellor came not to the Court, He knew not what
to do, but immediately dispatched an Express to <HI>France</HI> for farther Instruc∣tions.
He desired to speak with the Chancellor; which He refused, and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
likewise to receive the Letters which He had brought for him and offered
to send to him, all which He desired might be delivered to the King.
When the Proceedings in Parliament went so high, <HI>Ruvigny,</HI> who had at
all Hours Admission to the King, and intimate Conversation with the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> and so easily discovered the extreme Prejudice and Malice that
was contracted against the Chancellor, sent him frequent Advertisements of
what was necessary for him to know, and with all possible Earnestness ad∣vised
him, when the Divisions grew so high in the Houses, “that He would
withdraw and retire into <HI>France,</HI> where” He assured him “He would find
himself very welcome:”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which He declines.</NOTE> All which prevailed no more with him than the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
rest. And so another Week passed after the Bishop's Proposition, with the
same Passion in the Houses: And Endeavours were used to incense the Peo∣ple,
as if the Lords obstructed the Proceeding of Justice against the Chan∣cellor
by refusing to commit him; and Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> told the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI>
“that the People would pull down the Chancellor's House first, and then
those of all the Lords who adhered to him.”</P>
<P>BY this Time the Duke of <HI>York</HI> recovered so fast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to him to with∣draw.</NOTE> that the King, being
assured by the Physicians that there would be no Danger of Infection, went
on Saturday Morning, the twenty ninth of <HI>November,</HI> to visit him: And
being alone together, his Majesty bade him “advise the Chancellor to be<MILESTONE N="50"/>
gone,” and blamed him that He had not given Credit to what the Bishop
of <HI>Hereford</HI> had said to him. The King had no sooner left the Duke, but his
Highness sent for the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and bade him tell the Chan∣cellor
<PB N="457" REF="463"/>
from him, “that it was absolutely necessary for him speedily to be
gone, and that He had the King's Word for all that had been undertaken
by the Bishop of <HI>Hereford.</HI>”</P>
<P>AS soon as the Chancellor received this Advice and Command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He unwilling∣ly obeys, and leaves the Kingdom.</NOTE> He re∣solved
with great Reluctancy to obey, and to be gone that very Night:
And having, by the Friendship of Sir <HI>John Wolstenholme,</HI> caused the Far∣mers
Boat to wait for him at <HI>Erith,</HI> as soon as it was dark He took Coach
at his House <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the twenty ninth of <HI>November</HI> 1667, with
two Servants only. And being accompanied with his two Sons and two or
<MILESTONE N="10"/>three other Friends on Horseback as far as <HI>Erith,</HI> He found the Boat ready;
and so embarked about Eleven of the Clock that Night, the Wind indif∣ferently
good: But before Midnight it changed, and carried him back al∣most
as far as He had advanced. And in this Perplexity He remained three
Days and Nights before He arrived at <HI>Calais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He lands at</HI> Calais.</NOTE> which was not a Port chosen
by him, all Places out of <HI>England</HI> being indifferent, and <HI>France</HI> not being
in his Inclination, because of the Reproach and Calumny that was cast upon
him: But since it was the first that offered itself, and it was not seasonable
to affect another, He was very glad to disembark there, and to find himself
safe on Shore.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>ALL these Particulars, of which many may seem too trivial to be remem∣bered,
have been thought necessary to be related, it being a principal Part
of his Vindication for going away, and not insisting upon his Innocence;
which at that Time made a greater Impression upon many worthy Persons
to his Disadvantage, than any Particular that was contained in the Charge
that had been offered to the House. And therefore though He forbore,
when all the Promises were broken which had been made to him, and his
Enemies Malice and Insolence increased by his Absence, to publish or in the
least Degree to communicate the true Ground and Reasons of absenting
himself, to avoid any Inconvenience that in so captious a Season might
<MILESTONE N="30"/>thereby have befallen the King's Service; yet it cannot be thought unreason∣able
to preserve this Memorial of all the Circumstances, as well as the sub∣stantial
Reasons, which disposed him to make that Flight, for the clear In∣formation
of those, who in a fit Season may understand his Innocence with∣out
any Inconvenience to his Majesty, of whose Goodness and Honour and
Justice it may be hoped, that his Majesty himself will give his own Testi∣mony,
both of this Particular of his withdrawing, and a Vindication of his In∣nocence
from all the other Reproaches with which it was aspersed.</P>
<P>I WILL not omit one other Particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Instance of his generous Behaviour to his Enemies.</NOTE> for the Manifestation of the Ine∣quality
that was between the Nature of the Chancellor and of his Enemies,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>and upon what Disadvantage He was to contend with them. Before the
Meeting of the Parliament, when it was well known that the Combination
was entered into by the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> against
the Chancellor, several Members of the House informed him of what They
did and what They said, and told him, “that there was but one Way
to prevent the Prejudice intended towards him, which was by falling
first upon them; which They would cause to be done, if He would
assist them with such Information as it could not but be in his Power
to do. That They were Both very odious generally: The one for his
insolent Carriage towards all Men, and for the Manner of his getting into
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that Office by dispossessing an old faithful Servant, who was forced to part
with it for a very good Recompense of ten thousand Pounds in Money and
other Releases and Grants, which was paid and made by the King to in∣troduce
a Secretary of very mean Parts, and without Industry to improve
<PB N="458" REF="464"/>
them, and one who was generally suspected to be a Papist, or without any
Religion at all; it being generally taken Notice of, that He was rarely
seen in a Church, and never known to receive the Communion. The
other was known by his corrupt Behaviour, and felling all the Offices in
the Fleet and Navy for incredible Sums of Money, and thereby introduc∣ing
Men, who had been most employed and trusted by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> into
the several Offices; whilst loyal and faithful Seamen who had always ad∣hered
to the King, and many of them continued in his Service abroad and
till his Return into <HI>England,</HI> could not be admitted into any Employ∣ment:
The ill Consequence of which to the King's Service was very no∣torious,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
by the daily manifest stealing and embezzling the Stores of
Ammunition, Cordage, Sails, and other Tackling, which were com∣monly
sold again to the King at great Prices. And when the Persons
guilty of this were taken Notice of and apprehended, They talked loudly
of the Sums They had paid for their Offices, which obliged them to those
Frauds: And that it might not be more notorious, They were, by Sir
<HI>William Coventry's</HI> great Power and Interest, never proceeded against, or
removed from their Offices and Employments.”</P>
<P>THEY told him, “that He never said or did any Thing in the most secret
Council, where They two were always present, and where there were fre∣quent<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Occasions of mentioning the Proceedings of Both Houses, and the
Behaviour of several Members in Both, but those Gentlemen declared the
same, and all that He said or did, to those who would be most offended and
incensed by it, and who were like in some Conjuncture to be able to do
him most Mischief: And by those ill Arts They had irreconciled many
Persons to him. And that if He would now, without its being possible
to be taken Notice of, give them such Information and Light into the
Proceedings of those Gentlemen, They would undertake to divert the
Storm that threatened him, and cause it to fall upon the others.” And
this was with much Earnestness pressed to him, not only before the Meeting of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
the Parliament, and when He was fully informed of the ill Arts and un∣gentlemanly
Practice those two Persons were engaged in to do him Hurt, but
after the House of Commons was incensed against him; with a full Assurance,
“that They were much inclined to have accused the other two, if the least
Occasion was given for it.”</P>
<P>BUT the Chancellor would not be prevailed with, saying, “that no Pro∣vocation
or Example should dispose him to do any Thing that would not
become him: That They were Both Privy Counsellors, and trusted by the
King in his most weighty Affairs; and if He discerned any Thing amiss in
them, He could inform the King of it. But the aspersing or accusing<MILESTONE N="40"/>
them any where else was not his Part to do, nor could it be done by any
without some Reflection upon the King and Duke, who would be much
offended at it: And therefore He advised them in no Degree to make any
such Attempt on his Behalf; but to leave him to the Protection of his own
Innocence and of God's good Pleasure, and those Gentlemen to their own
Fate, which at some Time would humble them.” And it is known to
many Persons, and possibly to the King himself, for whose Service only that
Office was performed, that one or Both those Persons had before that Time
been impeached, if the Chancellor's sole Industry and Interest had not divert∣ed
and prevented it.<MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor found it necessary, for the Reasons aforesaid, to
withdraw himself, He thought it as necessary to leave some Address to the
House of Peers, and to make as good an Excuse as He could for his Absence
<PB N="459" REF="465"/>
without asking their Leave; which should be delivered to them by some
Member of their Body (there being many of them ready to perform that civil
Office for him), when his Absence should be known, or some Evidence that He
was safely arrived on the other Side of the Sea. And that Time being come
(for the Packet Boat was ready to depart when the Chancellor landed at <HI>Ca∣lais,</HI>
the Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI> said, “He had an Address to the House from
the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> which He desired might be read;” which contain∣ed
these Words.</P>
<Q><MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>To the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament
assembled;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Apology to the House of Lords for withdrawing.</NOTE> <HI>the humble Petition and Address of</HI> Edward <HI>Earl of</HI> Clarendon.
“MAY it please your Lordships,”</Q>
<P>“I CANNOT express the insupportable Trouble and Grief of Mind I sustain,
under the Apprehension of being misrepresented to your Lordships; and
when I hear how much of your Lordships Time hath been spent upon my
poor Concern (though it be of no less than of my Life and Fortune), and
of the Differences in Opinion which have already or may probably arise be∣tween
your Lordships and the honourable House of Commons; whereby
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the great and weighty Affairs of the Kingdom may be obstructed in a
Time of so general a Dissatisfaction.”</P>
<P>“I AM very unfortunate to find myself to suffer so much under two very
disadvantageous Reflections, which are in no Degree applicable to me:
The first, from the Greatness of my Estate and Fortune, collected and
made in so few Years; which, if it be proportionable to what is reported,
may very reasonably cause my Integrity to be suspected. The second,
that I have been the sole Manager and chief Minister in all the Transac∣tions
of State, since the King's Return into <HI>England</HI> to <HI>August</HI> last; and
therefore that all Miscarriages and Misfortunes ought to be imputed to me,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>and to my Counsels.”</P>
<P>“CONCERNING my Estate, your Lordships will not believe, that after
Malice and Envy hath been so inquisitive, and is so sharpsighted, I will
offer any Thing to your Lordships but what is exactly true: And I do as∣sure
your Lordships in the first Place, that, excepting from the King's
Bounty, I have never received or taken one Penny, but what was gene∣rally
understood to be the just and lawful Perquisites of my Office by the
constant Practice of the best Times, which I did in my own Judgment con∣ceive
to be that of my Lord <HI>Coventry</HI> and my Lord <HI>Ellesmere,</HI> the Practice
of which I constantly observed; although the Office in Both their Times
<MILESTONE N="40"/>was lawfully worth double to what it was to me, and I believe now is.”</P>
<P>“THAT all the Courtesies and Favours, which I have been able to ob∣tain
from the King for other Persons in Church or State or in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI>
have never been worth me five Pound: So that your Lordships
may be confident I am as innocent from Corruption, as from any disloyal
Thought; which, after near thirty Years Service of the Crown in some
Difficulties and Distresses, I did never suspect would have been objected
to me in my Age.”</P>
<P>“THAT I am at present indebted about three or four and twenty
thousand Pounds, for which I pay Interest; the Particulars whereof
<MILESTONE N="50"/>I shall be ready to offer to your Lordships, and for which I have assigned
Lands and Leases to be sold, though at present Nobody will buy or sell
with me. That I am so far from having Money, that from the Time the
Seal was taken from me I have lived upon the coining some small Parcels
<PB N="460" REF="466"/>
of Plate, which have sustained me and my Family, all my Rents being
withheld from me.”</P>
<P>“THAT my Estate, my Debts being paid, will not yield me two thou∣sand
Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for the Support of myself, and providing for two
young Children, who have Nothing: And that all I have is not worth
what the King in his Bounty hath bestowed upon me, his Majesty having
out of his Royal Bounty, within few Months after his coming into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
at one Time bestowed upon me twenty thousand Pounds in ready
Money, without the least Motion or Imagination of mine; and, shortly
after, another Sum of Money, amounting to six thousand Pounds or there∣abouts,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which ought to have amounted to a much greater
Proportion, and of which I never heard Word, till Notice was given me
by the Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI> that there was such a Sum of Money for me. His
Majesty likewise assigned me after the first Year of his Return an annual
Supply towards my Support, which did but defray my Expenses, the cer∣tain
Profits of my Office not amounting to above two thousand Pounds a
Year or thereabouts, and the Perquisites not very considerable and very
uncertain: So that the said several Sums of Money, and some Parcels of
Land his Majesty bestowed upon me, are worth more than all I have
amounts to. So far I am from advancing my Estate by any indirect<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Means. And though this Bounty of his Majesty hath very far exceeded
my Merit or my Expectation; yet some others have been as fortunate
at least in the same Bounty, who had as small Pretences to it, and have
no great Reason to envy my good Fortune.”</P>
<P>“CONCERNING the other Imputation, of the Credit and Power of being
chief Minister, and so causing all to be done that I had a Mind to; I
have no more to say, than that I had the good Fortune to serve a Master
of a very great Judgment and Understanding, and to be always joined
with Persons of great Ability and Experience, without whose Advice and
Concurrence never any Thing hath been done. Before his Majesty's com∣ing<MILESTONE N="30"/>
into <HI>England,</HI> He was constantly attended by the then Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI>
the late Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> who were
equally trusted with myself, and without whose joint Advice and Con∣currence,
when They were all present (as some of them always were), I
never gave any Counsel.”</P>
<P>“AS soon as it pleased God to bring his Majesty into <HI>England,</HI> He esta∣blished
his Privy Council, and shortly out of them a Number of honour∣able
Persons of great Reputation, who for the most Part are still alive, as
a Committee for foreign Affairs, and Consideration of such Things as in
the Nature of them required much Secrecy; and with these Persons He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
vouchsafed to join me. And I am confident this Committee never trans∣acted
any Thing of Moment, his Majesty being always present, without
presenting the same first to the Council-Board: And I must appeal to
them concerning my Carriage, and whether We were not all of one
Mind in all Matters of Importance. For more than two Years I never
knew any Difference in the Councils, or that there were any Complaints
in the Kingdom; which I wholly impute to his Majesty's great Wisdom,
and the entire Concurrence of his Council, without the Vanity of assuming
any Thing to myself: And therefore I hope I shall not be singly charged
with any Thing that hath since fallen out amiss. But from the Time that<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> was removed from his Place, there were great Altera∣tions;
and whosoever knows any Thing of the Court or Councils, knows
well how much my Credit since that Time hath been diminished, though
<PB N="461" REF="467"/>
his Majesty graciously vouchsafed still to hear my Advice in most of his
Affairs. Nor hath there been, from that Time to this, above one or two
Persons brought to the Council, or preferred to any considerable Office in
the Court, who have been of my intimate Acquaintance, or suspected to
have any Kindness for me; and many of them notoriously known to
have been very long my Enemies, and of different Judgment and Principles
from me both in Church and State, and who have taken all Opportuni∣ties
to lessen my Credit to the King, and with all other Persons, by mis∣representing
and misreporting all that I said or did, and persuading Men
<MILESTONE N="10"/>that I had done them some Prejudice with his Majesty, or crossed them
in some of their Pretences; though his Majesty's Goodness and Justice was
such, that it made little Impression upon him.”</P>
<P>“IN my humble Opinion, the great Misfortunes of the Kingdom have
proceeded from the War, to which it is notoriously known that I was
always averse; and may without Vanity say, I did not only foresee but did
declare the Mischiess We should run into, by entering into a War before
any Alliance made with the neighbour Princes. And that it may not be
imputed to his Majesty's Want of Care, or the Negligence of his Coun∣sellors,
that no such Alliances were entered into; I must take the Bold∣ness
<MILESTONE N="20"/>to say, that his Majesty left Nothing unattempted in Order thereunto:
And knowing very well, that <HI>France</HI> resolved to begin a War upon <HI>Spain,</HI>
as soon as his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty should depart this World (which being
much sooner expected by them, They had two Winters before been at
great Charge in providing plentiful Magazines of all Provisions upon the
Frontiers, that They might be ready for the War), his Majesty used all
possible Means to prepare and dispose the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to that Apprehension,
offering his Friendship to that Degree, as might be for the Security and
Benefit of Both Crowns. But <HI>Spain</HI> flattering itself with an Opinion that
<HI>France</HI> would not break with them, at least, that They would not give
<MILESTONE N="30"/>them any Cause by administering Matter of Jealousy to them, never made
any real Approach towards a Friendship with his Majesty; but both by
their Ambassadour here, and to his Majesty's Ambassadour at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
always insisted, as Preliminaries, upon the giving up of <HI>Dunkirk, Tangier,</HI>
and <HI>Jamaica.</HI>”</P>
<P>“THOUGH <HI>France</HI> had an Ambassadour here, to whom a Project for a
Treaty was offered, and the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> his Majesty's Ambassadour at
<HI>Paris,</HI> used all Endeavours to promote and prosecute the said Treaty; yet
it was quickly discerned, that the principal Design of <HI>France</HI> was to draw
his Majesty into such a nearer Alliance as might advance their Designs;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>without which They had no Mind to enter into the Treaty proposed. And
this was the State of Affairs when the War was entered into with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> from which Time neither Crown much considered their making
an Alliance with <HI>England.</HI>”</P>
<P>“AS I did from my Soul abhor the entering into this War, so I never
presumed to give any Advice or Counsel for the Way of managing it, but
by opposing many Propositions which seemed to the late Lord Treasurer
and myself to be unreasonable, as the Payment of the Seamen by Tickets,
and many other Particulars which added to the Expense. My Enemies took
all Occasions to inveigh against me: And making Friendship with others
<MILESTONE N="50"/>out of the Council of more licentious Principles, and who knew well
enough how much I disliked and complained of the Liberty They took to
themselves of reviling all Councils and Counsellors, and turning all Things
serious and sacred into Ridicule; They took all Ways imaginable to render
<PB N="462" REF="468"/>
me ingrateful to all Sorts of Men (whom I shall be compelled to name in
my own Defence), persuading those who miscarried in any of their Designs,
that it was the Chancellor's doing; whereof I never knew any Thing.
However They could not withdraw the King's Favour from me, who was
still pleased to use my Service with others; nor was there ever any Thing
done but upon the joint Advice of at least the major Part of those who
were consulted with. And as his Majesty commanded my Service in the
late Treaties, so I never gave the least Advice in private, nor writ one
Letter to any Person in either of those Negotiations, but upon the Advice
of the Council, and after it was read in Council, or at least by the King<MILESTONE N="10"/>
himself and some others: And if I prepared any Instructions or Memo∣rials,
it was by the King's Command, and the Request of the Secretaries,
who desired my Assistance. Nor was it any Wish of my own, that any
Ambassadours should give me an Account of the Transactions, but to the
Secretaries, with whom I was always ready to advise; nor am I conscious
to myself of having ever given Advice that hath proved mischievous or in∣convenient
to his Majesty. And I have been so far from being the sole
Manager of Affairs, that I have not in the whole last Year been above twice
with his Majesty in any Room alone, and very seldom in the two or three
Years preceding. And since the Parliament at <HI>Oxford,</HI> it hath been very<MILESTONE N="20"/>
visible that my Credit hath been very little, and that very few Things have
been hearkened to which have been proposed by me, but contradicted <HI>eo
Nomine,</HI> because proposed by me.”</P>
<P>“I MOST humbly beseech your Lordships to remember the Office and
Trust I had for seven Years; in which, in Discharge of my Duty, I was
obliged to stop and obstruct many Mens Pretences, and to refuse to ser
the Seal to many Pardons and other Grants, which would have been pro∣fitable
to those who procured them, and many whereof, upon my Repre∣sentation
to his Majesty, were for ever stopped; which naturally have
raised many Enemies to me. And my frequent concurring with the late<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Lord Treasurer, with whom I had the Honour to have a long and a fast
Friendship to his Death, in representing several Excesses and Exorbitances
(the yearly Issues so far exceeding the Revenue), provoked many Persons
concerned, of great Power and Credit, to do me all the ill Offices They
could. And yet I may faithfully say, that I never meddled with any Part
of the Revenue or the Administration of it, but when I was desired by
the late Lord Treasurer to give him my Assistance and Advice (having
had the Honour formerly to serve the Crown as Chancellor of the Exche∣quer),
which was for the most Part in his Majesty's Presence: Nor have
I ever been in the least Degree concerned in Point of Profit in the let∣ting<MILESTONE N="40"/>
any Part of his Majesty's Revenue, nor have ever treated or debated
it but in his Majesty's Presence; in which, my Opinion concurred al∣ways
with the major Part of the Counsellors who were present. All
which, upon Examination, will be made manifest to your Lordships,
how much soever my Integrity is blasted by the Malice of those, who I
am confident do not believe themselves. Nor have I in my Life, upon
all the Treaties or otherwise, received the Value of one Shilling from all
the Kings and Princes in the World (except the Books of the <HI>Louvre</HI>
Print sent me by the Chancellor of <HI>France</HI> by that King's Direction), but
from my own Master; to whose entire Service, and to the Good and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Welfare of my Country, no Man's Heart was ever more devoted.”</P>
<P>“THIS being my present Condition, I do most humbly beseech your
Lordships to retain a favourable Opinion of me, and to believe me to be
<PB N="463" REF="469"/>
innocent from those soul Aspersions, until the Contrary shall be proved;
which I am sure can never be by any Man worthy to be believed. And
since the Distemper of the Time, and the Difference between the two
Houses in the present Debate, with the Power and Malice of my Enemies,
who give out, that I shall prevail with his Majesty to prorogue or dis∣solve
this Parliament in Displeasure, and threaten to expose me to the
Rage and Fury of the People, may make me looked upon as the
Cause which obstructs the King's Service, and the Unity and Peace of the
Kingdom; I must humbly beseech your Lordships, that I may not for∣feit
<MILESTONE N="10"/>your Lordships Favour and Protection, by withdrawing myself from
so powerful a Persecution; in Hopes I may be able, by such withdrawing,
hereafter to appear, and make my Defence; when his Majesty's Justice,
to which I shall always submit, may not be obstructed nor controlled by
the Power and Malioe of those who have sworn my Destruction.”</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew very well, that there were Members enough in Both
Houses who would be very glad to take any Advantage of his Words and Ex∣pressions:
And therefore as He weighed them the best He could himself in
the short Time from which He took his Resolution to be gone; so He con∣sulted
<MILESTONE N="20"/>with as many Friends as that Time would allow, to the End that
their Jealousy and Wariness might better watch, that no Expression might
be liable to a sinister Interpretation, than his own Passion and Indisposition
could provide. And as They all thought it necessary that He should leave
Somewhat behind him, that might offer an Excuse for his Absence; so They
did not conceive, that the Words before mentioned could give any Offence
to equal Judges. But the least Variety or Change of Wind moved those
Waters to wonderful Distempers and Tempests.</P>
<P>THIS Address was no sooner read, by which They perceived He was gone,
but They who had contributed most to the absenting himself, and were
<MILESTONE N="30"/>privy to all the Promises which had invited him to it, seemed much troubled
that He had escaped their Justice; and moved, “that Orders might be forth∣with
sent to stop the Ports, that so He might be apprehended;” when They
well knew that He was landed at <HI>Calais.</HI> Others took Exceptions at some
Expressions, “which,” They said, “reflected upon the King's Honour and
Justice:” Others moved, “that it might be entered in their Journal∣Book,
to the End that They might farther consider of it when They should
think fit;” and this was ordered.</P>
<P>THE Houses till this Time had continued obstinate in their several Reso∣lutions;
the Commons every Day pressing, “that He might be committed
<MILESTONE N="40"/>upon their general Accusation of Treason” (for though They had amongst
themselves and from their Committee offered those Particulars which are
mentioned before, yet They presented none to the House of Peers); and
the Lords as positively refusing to commit him, till some Charge should be
presented against him that amounted to Treason. But now all that Debate
was at an End by his being out of their Reach, so that They pursued that
Point no farther; which, being Matter of Privilege, should have been de∣termined
as necessarily as before, for the Prevention of the like Disputes here∣after.
But the Commons wisely declined that Contention, well knowing
that their Party in the House, that was very passionate for the Commitment
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of the Chancellor, would be as much against the general Order as any of the
rest had been: And the Lords satisfied themselves with sending a Message to
the House of Commons, “that They found by the Address which They had
received that Morning, and which They likewise imparted to them, that
<PB N="464" REF="470"/>
the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had withdrawn himself; and so there was no far∣ther
Occasion of Debate upon that Point.”</P>
<P>THE Address was no sooner read in that House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apology burned by Or∣der of Both Houses.</NOTE> but They who had in∣dustriously
promoted the former Resolution were inflamed, as if this very
Instrument would contribute enough to any Thing that was wanting; and
They severally arraigned it, and inveighed against the Person who had sent
it with all imaginable Bitterness and Insolence: Whilst others, who could
not in the hearing it read observe that Malignity that it was accused of,
sate still and silent, as if They suspected that Somewhat had escaped their
Observations and Discovery, that so much transported other Men; or be∣cause<MILESTONE N="10"/>
They were well pleased that a Person, against whom there was so
much Malice and Fury professed, was got out of their Reach. In Con∣clusion,
after long Debate it was concluded, “that the Paper contained
much Untruth and Scandal and Sedition in it, and that it should
be publickly burned by the Hand of the Hangman;” which Vote
They presently sent to the Lords for their Concurrence, who, though They
had not observed any such Guilt in it before, would maintain no further
Contests with them, and so concurred in the Sentence: And the poor
Paper was accordingly with Solemnity executed by the appointed Officer,
which made the more People inquisitive into the Contents of it; and hav∣ing<MILESTONE N="20"/>
gotten Copies of it, They took upon them to censure the Thing and
the Person with much more Clemency and Compassion, and thought He
had done well to decline such angry Judges.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor found himself at <HI>Calais,</HI> He was unresolved how
to dispose of himself, only that He would not go to <HI>Paris,</HI> against which
He was able to make many Objections: And in this Irresolution He knew
not how to send any Directions to his Children in <HI>England,</HI> to what Place
They should send his Servants and such other Accommodations as He
should want; and therefore stayed there till He might be better informed,
and know Somewhat of the Temper of the Parliament. In the mean Time<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He writ Letters to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> from whose very late
Professions He had Reason to expect Civility, and that was all He did ex∣pect;
never imagining that He should receive any Grace from the Queen,
or that it was fit for him to cast himself at her Feet, whilst He was in his
Majesty's Displeasure.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor writes to the</HI> French-<HI>Court for Leave to remove to</HI> Roan.</NOTE> Only He desired to know, “whether there would
be any Objection against his coming to <HI>Roan,</HI>” and desiring, “if there
were no Objection against it, that a Coach might be hired to meet him
on such a Day at <HI>Abbeville.</HI>” The Lieutenant Governour of <HI>Calais</HI> had,
upon his first Arrival there, given Advertisement to the Court of it: And
by the same Post that He received a very dry Letter from the Earl of <HI>St.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Albans,</HI> in which He said, “He thought that Court would approve of his
coming to <HI>Roan;</HI>” He received likewise a Letter of great Civility from
the Count <HI>De Louvois,</HI> Secretary of State, in which He congratulated his
safe Arrival in <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is granted.</NOTE> and told him, “that his Majesty was well pleased
with it, and with his Purpose of coming to <HI>Roan,</HI> where He should find
himself very welcome.” At the same Time Letters were sent to the
Lieutenant Governour of <HI>Calais, Boulogne,</HI> and <HI>Montrevil,</HI> “to treat him
as a Person of whom the King had Esteem, and to give him such an
Escorte as might make his Journey secure;” of all which He received
Advertisement, and, “that a Coach would be ready at <HI>Abbeville</HI> to wait<MILESTONE N="50"/>
for him at the Day He had appointed.”</P>
<P>AND now He thought He might well take his Resolution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He begins his Journey.</NOTE> and there∣upon
gave Direction, “that such of his Family, whose Attendance He
<PB N="465" REF="471"/>
could not be well without, might with all Expedition be with him at
<HI>Roan;</HI> and such Monies might be likewise returned thither for him, as
were necessary,” for He had not brought with him Supply enough for
long Time. And so He provided to leave <HI>Calais,</HI> that He might be warm
in his Winter-Quarters as soon as might be, which both the Season of the
Year, it being now within few Days of <HI>Christmas,</HI> and his Expectation
of a speedy Defluxion of the Gout, made very requisite. When He came
to <HI>Boulogne,</HI> He found Orders from the Marshal <HI>D' Aumont</HI> to his Lieute∣nant
for a Guard to <HI>Montrevil,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrisons making frequent In∣cursions
<MILESTONE N="10"/>into those Quarters: And at <HI>Montrevil</HI> the Duke <HI>D' Elboeuf</HI> visited
him, and invited him to Supper, which the Chancellor was so much tired
with his Journey that He accepted not; but was not suffered to refuse his
Coach the next Day to <HI>Abbeville,</HI> where He found a Coach from <HI>Paris</HI>
ready to carry him to <HI>Roan.</HI></P>
<P>IT was <HI>Christmas</HI> Eve when He came to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and it was a long
Journey the next Day to <HI>Roan;</HI> which made him send to the Governour,
to desire that the Ports might be open much sooner than their Hour,
which was granted: So that He came to a very ill Inn well known at
<HI>Tostes,</HI> near the middle Way to <HI>Roan,</HI> about Noon. And when He was
<MILESTONE N="20"/>within View of that Place, a Gentleman, passing by in a good Gallop with
a Couple of Servants, asked, “whether the Chancellor of <HI>England</HI> was
in that Coach;” and being answered “that He was,” He alighted at the
Coach-Side, and gave him a Letter from the King, which contained only
Credit to what that Gentleman, <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde,</HI> his Servant in Ordinary,
should say to him from his Majesty. The Gentleman, after some Expres∣sions
of his Majesty's Grace and good Opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But receives on the Way Orders to leave <HI>France</HI> instantly.</NOTE> told him, “that the King
had lately received Advertisement from his Envoy in <HI>England, that the
Parliament there was so much incensed against him, the Chancellor, that if
He should be suffered to stay in</HI> France, <HI>it would be so prejudicial to the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Affairs of his</HI> Christian <HI>Majesty</HI> (to whom He was confident the Chancellor
wished well), <HI>that it might make a Breach between the two Crowns:</HI> And
therefore He desired him to make what Speed He could out of his Do∣minions;
and that He might want no Accommodation for his Journey,
that Gentleman was to accompany him till He saw him out of <HI>France.</HI>”</P>
<P>HE was marvellously struck with this Encounter, which He looked not
for, nor could resolve what to do, being at Liberty to make his Journey
which Way He would so He rested not, which was the only Thing He
desired: So He desired the Gentleman (for all this Conversation was in the
Highway) “to come into the Coach, and to accompany him to <HI>Roan,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>where They would confer farther.” The Gentleman, though He was
a very civil Person, seemed to think that it would be better to return
to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and so to <HI>Calais,</HI> as the shortest Way out of <HI>France:</HI> But
He had no Commission to urge that, and so condescended to go that
Night to <HI>Roan;</HI> with a Declaration, “that it was necessary for him to be
the next Day very early in the Coach, which Way soever He in∣tended
to make his Journey.”</P>
<P>IT was late in the Night before They reached <HI>Roan:</HI> And the Coach was
overthrown three Times in the Gentleman's Sight, who chose to ride his
Horse; so that the Chancellor was really hurt and bruised, and scarce able
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to set his Foot to the Ground. And therefore He told the Gentleman
plainly, “that He could not make any Journey the next Day: But that
He would presently write to <HI>Paris</HI> to a Friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He represents his ill State of Health to the Court.</NOTE> who should inform the
King of the ill Condition He was in, and desire some Time of Rest;
<PB N="466" REF="472"/>
and that as soon as He had finished his Letter, He would send an Ex∣press
with it, who should make all possible Haste in going and coming.”
<HI>Monsieur Le Fonde</HI> assured him, “the Matter was so fully resolved, that no
Writing would procure any Time to stay in <HI>France;</HI> and therefore desired
him to hasten his Journey, which Way soever He intended it.” But when
He saw there was no Remedy, He likewise writ to the Court, and the
Chancellor to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> from whom He thought He should
receive Offices of Humanity, and to another Friend, upon whose Affection
He more depended: And with those Letters the Express was dispatched.</P>
<P>THEY who had prevailed so far against him in <HI>England</HI> were not yet sa∣tisfied,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Occasion of his ill Treatment in</HI> France.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="10"/>
but contrived those Ways to disquiet him as much in <HI>France,</HI> by
telling <HI>Monsieur Ruvigny</HI> (who was too easily disposed to believe them),“
that the Parliament was so much offended with the Chancellor, that it
would never consent that the King should enter into a close and firm Al∣liance
with <HI>France,</HI>” which it was his Business to solicit, “whilst He
should be permitted to stay within that Kingdom:” When in Truth all
the Malice against him was contained within the Breasts of few Men, who
by incensing the King, and infusing many false and groundless Relations
into him, drew such a numerous Party to contribute to their Ends.</P>
<P>WHEN He was now gone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proceedings against him in</HI> England.</NOTE> They observed to the King, “what a great<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Faction there was in Both Houses that adhered to the Chancellor,” who
were called <HI>Clarendonians;</HI> and when any Opposition was made to any
Thing that was proposed, as frequently there was, “it was always done by
the <HI>Clarendonians:</HI>” Whose Condition They thought was not desperate
enough, except They proceeded farther than was yet done. They laboured
with all their Power, that He might be attainted of High Treason by Act
of Parliament, and that Both his Sons might be removed from the Court:
Both which, notwithstanding all their Importunity, his Majesty positively re∣fused
to consent to. Then They told him, “that the Chancellor only waited
the Season that the Parliament should be confirmed in ill Humour, to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
which They were inclined; and then He would return and fit in the
House to disturb all their Counsels, and obstruct all his Service: And
therefore They proposed, since He had fled from the Hand of Justice,
that there could be no more Prosecution for his Guilt” (which was untrue,
for They might as well have proceeded and proved the Crimes objected
against him if They could), “a Bill of Banishment,” which They had pre∣pared,
“might be brought in against him;” which his Majesty consented
to, notwithstanding all that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> urged to the Contrary upon
the King's Promise to him, and which had only betrayed the Chancellor
to making his Escape. But the King alleged, “that the Condescension<MILESTONE N="40"/>
was necessary for his Good, and to compound with those who would else
press that which would be more mischievous to him.”</P>
<P>WHEREUPON a Bill for his Banishment was preferred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill of Ba∣nishment passed against him.</NOTE> only upon his having
declined the Proceeding of Justice by his Flight, without so much as en∣deavouring
to prove one of the Crimes They had charged upon him: And
this Bill was passed by the two Houses, and confirmed by the King; of whom
They had yet so much Jealousy, that They left it not in his Power to pardon
him without the Consent of the two Houses of Parliament. And this Act
was to be absolute, “except by a Day appointed” (which was so short, that
it was hardly possible for him to comply with it, except He could have rode<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Post) “He should appear before one of the Secretaries of State, or deliver
himself to the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> who was detain him in Custody
till He had acquainted the Parliament with it: In the mean Time no
<PB N="467" REF="473"/>
Person was to presume to hold any Correspondence with him or to write
to him, except his own Children or his menial Servants, who were obliged
to shew the Letters which They sent or received to one of the Secretaries
of State.”</P>
<P>THE Express that had been sent to <HI>Paris</HI> returned with reiterated Orders
to <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde</HI> to hasten the Chancellor's Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He receives Orders a se∣cond Time to quit</HI> France.</NOTE> and not to suffer
him to remain there; who executed the Commands He had received with
great Punctuality and Importunity. The Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> did not vouch∣safe
to return any Answer to his Letter, or to interpose on his Behalf, that
<MILESTONE N="10"/>He might rest till He might securely enter upon his Journey: Only Abbot
<HI>Mountague</HI> writ very obligingly to him, and offered all the Offices could
be in his Power to perform, and excused the Rigour of the Court's Pro∣ceedings,
as the Effect of such Reason of State, as would not permit any
Alteration whilst They had that Apprehension of the Parliament; and
therefore advised him “to comply with their Wishes, and make no longer
Stay in <HI>Roan,</HI> which would not be permitted.” But the general Indispo∣sition
of his Body, the Fatigue of his Journey, and the Bruises He had re∣ceived
by the Falls and Overturnings of the Coach, made him not able to rise
out of his Bed; and the Physicians, who had taken much Blood from him,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>exceedingly dissuaded it. All which, how visible soever, prevailed not with
his <HI>French</HI> Conductor to lessen his Importunity that He would go, though
it was evident He could not easily stand; of which no Doubt He gave true
and faithful Advertisement to the Court, though the Jealousy of being
not thought active enough in his Trust made his Behaviour much less
civil, than is agreeable to the Custom of that Nation.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He again re∣presents his ill State of Health to the</HI> French <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> hardened by the Inhumanity of his Treat∣ment,
writ such a Letter in <HI>Latin</HI> to <HI>Monsieur De Lionne,</HI> by whose Hand
all the ungentle Orders to <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde</HI> had been transmitted, as ex∣pressed
the Condition He was in, and his Disability to comply with his Ma∣jesty's
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Commands until He could recover more Strength; not without Com∣plaint
of the little Civility He had received in <HI>France.</HI> And He writ like∣wise
to the Abbot <HI>Mountague,</HI> “to use his Credit with <HI>Monsieur De Tellier,</HI>”
upon whose Humanity He more depended, “to interpose with his <HI>Chris∣tian</HI>
Majesty, that He might not be pressed beyond what his Health would
bear.” And since at that Time He resolved to make his Journey to
<HI>Avignon,</HI> that He might be out of the Dominions of <HI>France,</HI> He desired,“
that He might have Liberty to rest some Days at <HI>Orleans,</HI> until his Ser∣vants
who were upon the Sea, and brought with them many Things
which He wanted, might come to him; and that He might afterwards,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>in so long a Journey in the worst Season of the Year, have Liberty to
take such Repose as his Health would require; in which He could not
affect unnecessary Delay, for the great Charge and Expense it must be
accompanied with.”</P>
<P>THE Answer He received from <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> was the renewing
the King's Commands for his speedy Departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But receives fresh Orders to remove im∣mediately.</NOTE> “as a Thing absolutely
necessary to his Affairs, and which must not be disputed.” But that
which affected him the more tenderly, was the Sight of a Billet which
Abbot <HI>Mountague</HI> sent to him, that He had received from <HI>Monsieur De Tel∣lier,</HI>
in which He said, “that He had, according to his Desire, moved
<MILESTONE N="50"/>his <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty concerning the Chancellor of <HI>England;</HI> and that his
Majesty was much displeased that He made not more Haste to comply
with what was most necessary for his Affairs, and that it must be no longer
<PB N="468" REF="474"/>
delayed; and that if He chose to pass to <HI>Avignon,</HI> He might rest one Day
in ten, which was all his Majesty would allow.”</P>
<P>THIS unexpected Determination, without the least Ceremony or Circum∣stance
of Remorse, signified by a Person who He was well assured was well
inclined to have returned a more grateful Answer, in the Instant suppressed
all Hopes of finding any Humanity in <HI>France,</HI> and raised a Resolution in
him to get out of those Dominions with all the Expedition that was possi∣ble:
Which his <HI>French</HI> Conductor urged with new and importunate In∣stance;
insomuch as though there was sure Information, that the Ship, in
which the Chancellor's Servants and Goods were embarked, was arrived at<MILESTONE N="10"/>
the Mouth of the River, and only kept by the cross Wind from coming up
to the Town; He would by no Means consent to the Delay of one Day in
Expectation of it, or that his Servants might come to him by Land, as He
had sent to them to do.</P>
<P>AT this very Time arrived an Express, a Servant of his, sent by his Children,
with a particular Account of all the Transactions in Parliament, and of the
Bill of Banishment; of Nothing of which He had before heard, and upon
which the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who looked upon himself as ill used by that Pro∣secution,
was of Opinion, “that the Chancellor should make all possible
Haste, and appear by the Day appointed, and undergo the Trial, in which<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He knew his Innocence would justify him.” This Advice, with a little
Indignation at the Discourtesy of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> diverted him from
any farther Thought of <HI>Avignon.</HI> And though He did not imagine that
his Strength would be sufficient to perform the Journey by the Day assigned
(for the Gout had already seized upon Both his Feet), nor did the Argu∣ments
for his Return satisfy him; and the Breach of all the Promises which
had been made was no Sign that They meant speedily to bring him to Trial,
towards which They had not yet made any Preparation: Yet He resolved to
make all possible Haste to <HI>Calais,</HI> that it might be in his Power to proceed
according to such Directions as He might reasonably expect to receive there<MILESTONE N="30"/>
from his Friends from <HI>England,</HI> and from whence He might quickly re∣move
into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions; though the Climate of <HI>Flanders,</HI> well
known to him, terrified him in Respect of the Season and his approaching
Gout. And with this Resolution He dispatched the Express again for <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and left Order with a Merchant at <HI>Roan,</HI> “to receive his Goods when
the Ship should arrive, and detain both them and his Servants till He should
send farther Orders from <HI>Calais:</HI>” And at the same Time He writ to a
Friend in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to speak to the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> with whom He
had formerly held a fair Correspondence, “to send him a Pass to go through
that Country to what Place He should think fit.” And having thus pro∣vided<MILESTONE N="40"/>
for his Journey, He departed from <HI>Roan,</HI> after He had remained
there about twenty Days.</P>
<P>IN how ill a Condition of Health soever He was to travel,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns to</HI> Calais.</NOTE> when the Days
were at shortest, He resolved to make no Stay till He should reach <HI>Calais,</HI>
to the End, that if He met with no Advice there to the Contrary, He might
be at <HI>London</HI> by the Day limited by the Proclamation, which was the first
of <HI>February</HI> that Style: And it was the last of <HI>January</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Style
when He arrived at <HI>Calais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He is confined to his Bed by a dan∣gerous Illness.</NOTE> so broken with the Fatigue of the Journey and
the Defluxion of the Gout, that He could not move but as He was carried,
and was so put into a Bed; and the next Morning the Physicians found him<MILESTONE N="50"/>
in a Fever, and thought it necessary to open a Vein, which They presently
did. But the Pains in all his Limbs so increased, that He was not able to
turn in his Bed; nor for many Nights closed his Eyes. Many Letters He
<PB N="469" REF="475"/>
found there from <HI>England,</HI> but was not in a Condition to read them, nor
in Truth could speak and discourse with any Body. <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde,</HI> out
of pure Compassion, suffered him to remain some Days without his Vexa∣tion,
until He received fresh Orders from <HI>Paris,</HI> “that the Chancellor
might not, in what Case soever, be suffered to remain in <HI>Calais:</HI>” And
then He renewed his Importunity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yet He is re∣quired to re∣tire out of the</HI> French <HI>Ter∣ritories.</HI></NOTE> “that He would the next Day leave the
Town, and either by Sea or Land, if He thought it not fit to pass for
<HI>England,</HI> put himself into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions, which He might do in
few Hours.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>HE was so confounded with the Barbarity, that He had no Mind to give
him any Answer; nor could He suddenly find Words, their Conversation
being in <HI>Latin,</HI> to express the Passion He was in. At last He told him,
“that He must bring Orders from God Almighty as well as from the King,
before He could obey: That He saw the Condition He was in, and con∣ferred
every Day with his Physicians, by which He could not but know,
that He could neither help himself, nor endure the being carried out of
that Chamber, if the House were in a Flame; and therefore that He did
not use him like a Gentleman, in adding his unreasonable Importunities
to the Vexation He suffered by Pain and Sickness. That He might be
<MILESTONE N="20"/>very confident, his Treatment had not been so obliging to make him stay
one Hour in <HI>France,</HI> after He should be able to go out of it: But He
would not willingly endanger himself by Sea to fall into the Hands of his
Enemies. That He knew” (for He had shewed him his Letter) “that
He had written into <HI>Flanders</HI> for a Pass, which was not yet come: As
soon as it did, if He could procure a Litter and endure the Motion of it,
He would remove to <HI>St. Omers</HI> or <HI>Newport,</HI> which were the nearest Places
under the <HI>Spanish</HI> Government.”</P>
<P>TO all which He replied with no Excess of Courtesy, “that He must
and would obey his Orders as He had done; and that He had no Power
<MILESTONE N="30"/>to judge of his Disability to remove, or of the Pain He underwent.” And
there is no Doubt the Gentleman, who was well bred and in his Nature
very civil, was not pleased with his Province, and much troubled that He
could not avoid the Delivery of the Orders He received: And the Con∣juncture
of their Affairs was such with Reference to the Designs then on
Foot, that every Post brought reiterated Commands for the Chancellor's Re∣move;
which grew every Day more impossible, by the Access of new Pain
to the Weakness He was in for Want of Sleep without any Kind of
Sustenance.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING which, within few Days after the last Encounter,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>upon fresh Letters from <HI>Monsieur De Lionne,</HI> the Gentleman came again to
him, told him what Orders He had received, and again proposed, “that He
would either make Use of a Boat to <HI>Newport</HI> or <HI>Ostend,</HI> or a <HI>Brancard</HI> to
<HI>St. Omers;</HI> either of which He would cause to be provided against the
next Morning, for the King's Service was exceedingly concerned in the
Expedition.” And when He saw the other was not moved with what He
said, nor gave him any Answer, He told him plainly, “that the King would
be obeyed in his own Dominions; and if He would not choose to do that
which the King had required, He must go to the Governour, who had
Authority and Power to compel him, which He durst not but do.” Upon
<MILESTONE N="50"/>which, with the Supply of Spirit that Choler administered to him, He told
him, “that though the King was a very great and powerful Prince, He was
not yet so omnipotent, as to make a dying Man strong enough to under∣take
a Journey. That He was at the King's Mercy, and would endure
<PB N="470" REF="476"/>
what He should exact from him as well as He was able: It was in his
Majesty's Power to send him a Prisoner into <HI>England,</HI> or to cause him to
be carried dead or alive into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Territories; but He would not
be <HI>Felo de se,</HI> by willingly attempting to do what He and all who saw
him knew was not possible for him to perform.” And in this Passion He
added some Words of Reproach to <HI>Le Fonde,</HI> which were more due to <HI>Mon∣sieur
De Lionne,</HI> who in Truth had not behaved himself with any Civility:
Whereupon He withdrew in the like Disorder, and for some Days forbore
so much as to see him, in which He had never before failed a Day.</P>
<P>AND the Chancellor, who really did believe that some Force and Violence<MILESTONE N="10"/>
would be used towards him, presently sent to desire the chief Magistrates of
the Town and the Lieutenant Governour to come to him; and then told
them all the Treatment He had received from <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde,</HI> and ap∣pealed
to them, “whether They thought him in a Condition to perform any
Journey.” And the Physicians being likewise present, He required them
to sign such a Certificate and Testimony of his Sickness as They thought
their Duty, which They readily performed; very fully declaring under their
Hands, “that He could not be removed out of the Chamber in which He
lay, without manifest Danger of his Life.” And the Lieutenant Governour
and the President of Justice seemed much scandalized at what had been so<MILESTONE N="20"/>
much pressed, of which They had taken Notice many Days: And the one
of them wrote to the Count of <HI>Charrou,</HI> Governour of the Town and then
at Court, and the other to <HI>Monsieur De Lionne,</HI> what They thought fit;
and the Certificate of the Physicians was enclosed to the Abbot <HI>Mountague,</HI>
with a full Relation of what had passed. And it was never doubted, but
that <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde</HI> himself made a very faithful Relation of the Impos∣sibility
that the Chancellor could comply with what was required, in the
State of Sickness and Pain that He was in at present.</P>
<P>BY this Time the <HI>French</HI> Court discovered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Court suddenly alters its Be∣haviour.</HI></NOTE> that They were prevented of
entering into that strait Alliance They hoped with <HI>England</HI> (and for ob∣taining<MILESTONE N="30"/>
whereof They had gratified the proud and malicious Humours of
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> in the Treatment of the
Chancellor), by the <HI>Triple League,</HI> which They had used all those Com∣pliances
to prevent: So that by the next Post after the Receipt of the Cer∣tificate
from the Physicians, <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> writ a very civil Letter to
the Chancellor, in which He protested, “that He had the same Respect
for him which He had always professed to have in his greatest Fortune,
and that it was never in the Purpose of his <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty to endanger
his Health by making any Journey that He could not well endure;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He has Leave to reside in</HI> France.</NOTE> and
therefore that it was left entirely to himself to remove from <HI>Calais</HI> when<MILESTONE N="40"/>
He thought fit, and to go to what Place He would.” And <HI>Monsieur Le
Fonde</HI> came now again to visit him with another Countenance, by which a
Man could not but discern, that He was much better pleased with the Com∣mission
He had received last than with the former; and told him, “that
He was now to receive no Orders but from himself, which He would
gladly obey.”</P>
<P>THIS gave him some little Ease in the Agony He was in, for his Pains
increased to an intolerable Degree, insomuch that He could not rise out of
his Bed in six Weeks. And it was the more welcome to him, because at
the same Time He received an Account from his Friend in <HI>Flanders,</HI> “that<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Marquis of <HI>Castelle Roderigo,</HI> with as much Regret as a civil Man
could express, protested, <HI>that the Fear He had of offending the Parliament
at that Time would not permit him to grant a Pass: But if He would come
<PB N="471" REF="477"/>
to</HI> Newport, <HI>He should find the Governour there well prepared and disposed
to shew him all possible Respect, and to accommodate him in his Passage
throughout the Country, where it would not be convenient for him to make
any Stay; and that He looked upon it as a great Misfortune to himself,
that He might not wait upon him in his Passage.</HI>” This made it easy for
him to discern, that his Enemies would not give him any Rest in any Place
where their Malice could reach him: And since They were so terrible that
the Marquis of <HI>Castelle Roderigo</HI> durst not grant him a Pass, He thought it
would be no hard Matter for them to cause some Affront to be put on him
<MILESTONE N="10"/>when He should be without any Pass; though He had not the least Suspicion
of the Marquis his failing in Point of Honour or Courtesy.</P>
<P>AT the same Time He received Advice from his Friends in <HI>England,</HI>“
that the Storm from <HI>France</HI> was over, and that He might be permitted to
stay in any Part thereof; and for the present They wished that He would
repair to the Waters of <HI>Bourbon</HI> for his Health, and then choose such
a Place to reside in, as upon Inquiry He should judge most proper.” But
He was not yet so far reconciled to that Court, though He liked the Climate
well, as to depend upon its Protection: And therefore He resumed his
former Purpose of going to <HI>Avignon,</HI> and, if He could recover Strength for
<MILESTONE N="20"/>the Journey before the Season should be expired for drinking the Waters of
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> to pass that Way. And to that Purpose He sent to the Court
“for a Pass to <HI>Avignon,</HI> with Liberty to stay some Days at <HI>Roan,</HI>” where
his Goods and his Monies were (for his Servants had come from thence to
him to <HI>Calais</HI>), “and to use the Waters of <HI>Bourbon</HI> in his Way:” All which
was readily granted.</P>
<P>IT was the third of <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns to</HI> Roan.</NOTE> before He recovered Strength enough to endure
a Coach: And then, having bought a large and easy Coach of the President
of <HI>Calais,</HI> He hired Horses there. And so He begun his Journey for <HI>Roan,</HI>
being still so lame and weak that He could not go without being supported:
<MILESTONE N="30"/>And the first Day had a very ill Omen by the Negligence of the Coach∣man,
who passing upon the Sands between <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Boulogne,</HI> when the
Sea was flowing, drove so unadvisedly (which He might have avoided, as
the Horsemen and another Coach did), that the Sea came over the Boot of
the Coach, to the Middle of all those who fate in it; and a Minute's Pause
more had inevitably overthrown the Coach (the Weight whereof only then
prevented it), and They had been all covered with the Sea. And two Days
after, by the Change of the Coachman for a worse, He was overthrown in
a Place almost as bad, into a deep and dirty Water, from whence He was
with Difficulty and some Hurt drawn out. Both which wonderful Deli∣verances
<MILESTONE N="40"/>were comfortable Instances that God would protect him, of which
He had within few Days a fresh and extraordinary Evidence.</P>
<P>WHEN He came to <HI>Roan,</HI> He received all those Orders He had desired
from the Court. And a Letter from Abbot <HI>Mountague</HI> assured him, “that
He need no more apprehend any Discommodity from Orders of the Court,
but might be confident of the Contrary, and of all Respect that could be
shewed him from thence: That He might stay at <HI>Roan</HI> as long as his In∣disposition
required; and when He had made Use of the Waters of <HI>Bourbon,</HI>
He might retire to any Place He would choose to reside in.” <HI>Monsieur
Le Fonde</HI> had Orders, “after He had accompanied the Chancellor two
<MILESTONE N="50"/>or three Days Journey towards <HI>Bourbon,</HI> except He desired his Company
longer, to return to the Court.” Only <HI>Monsieur De Lionne</HI> desired, “that
He would not in his Journey come nearer <HI>Paris</HI> than the direct Way re∣quired
him to do, because the Emperour's Agent at <HI>London,</HI> the Baron of
<PB N="472" REF="478"/>
<HI>Isola,</HI> had confidently averred, <HI>that the King had one Day gone</HI> incognito
<HI>from the</HI> Bois de Vincennes <HI>to meet the Chancellor, and had a long private
Conference with him.</HI>”</P>
<P>WHEN He had stayed as long at <HI>Roan</HI> as was necessary for the taking a
little Physick and recovering a little Strength,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>From whence He begins his Journey to</HI> Avignon.</NOTE> the Season required his making
Haste to <HI>Bourbon:</HI> And so on the twenty third of <HI>April</HI> He began his
Journey from thence; and that He might comply with the Directions of
<HI>Monfieur De Lionne,</HI> He chose to go by the Way of <HI>Eureux,</HI> and to lodge
there that Night. And because He was unable to go up a Pair of Stairs,
He sent a Servant before, as He had always done, to choose an Inn where<MILESTONE N="10"/>
there was some Ground-Lodging, which often was attended with Discom∣modity
enough, and now (besides being forced to go through the City
into the Suburbs) was like to cost him very dear.</P>
<P>THERE happened to be at that Time quartered there a Foot-Company of
<HI>English</HI> Seamen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is greatly abused by some</HI> English <HI>at</HI> Eureux.</NOTE> who had been raised and were entertained to serve the
<HI>French</HI> in attending upon their Artillery, some of them being Gunners;
and none of them had the Language, but were attended by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Con∣ductor,
who spake ill <HI>English,</HI> for their Interpreter. Their Behaviour there
was so rude and barbarous, in being always drunk, and quarrelling and
fighting with the Townsmen who would not give them any Thing They<MILESTONE N="20"/>
demanded, that the City had sent to the Court their Complaints, and ex∣pected
Orders that Night for their Remove. They quickly heard of the
Chancellor's being come to the Town; and calling their Company toge∣ther
declared, “that there were many Months Pay due to them in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and that They would make him pay it before He got out of the
Town.”</P>
<P>HE was scarce gotten into his ill Ground-Lodging, when many of them
flocked about the House: Upon which the Gates of the Inn were shut, They
making a great Noise, and swearing They would speak with the Chan∣cellor;
and, being about the Number of fifty, They threatened to break<MILESTONE N="30"/>
open the Gate or pull down the House. The Mutiny was notorious to all
the Street; but They had not Courage to appear against them: The Ma∣gistrates
were sent to; but there was a Difference between them upon the
Point of Jurisdiction, this Uproar being in the Suburbs. In short, They
broke open the Door of the Inn: And when They were entered into the
Court, They quickly found which was the Chancellor's Chamber. And the
Door being barricadoed with such Things as were in the Room, They first
discharged their Pistols into the Window, with which They hurt some of the
Servants, and <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde,</HI> who with his Sword kept them from
entering in at the Window with great Courage, until He was shot with a<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Brace of Bullets in the Head, with which He fell: And then another of
the Servants being hurt, They entered in at the Window, and opened the
Door for the rest of their Company, which quickly filled the Chamber.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was in his Gown, sitting upon the Bed, being not able
to stand; upon whom They all came with their Swords drawn: And one
of them gave him a Blow with a great Broadsword upon the Head, which
if it had fallen upon the Edge must have cleft his Head; but it turned in
his Hand, and so struck him with the Flat, with which He fell backward
on the Bed. They gave him many ill Words, called him “Traitor,” and
swore, “before He should get out of their Hands He should lay down all<MILESTONE N="50"/>
their Arrears of Pay.” They differed amongst themselves what They should
do with him, some crying, “that They would kill him,” others, “that
They would carry him into <HI>England:</HI>” Some had their Hands in his
<PB N="473" REF="479"/>
Pockets, and pillaged him of his Money and some other Things of Value;
others broke up his Trunks and plundered his Goods. When himself reco∣vered
out of the Trance in which He was stunned by the Blow, They took
him by the Hand who spake of carrying him into <HI>England,</HI> and told him,
“it was the wisest Thing They could do to carry him thither, where
They would be well rewarded:” Another swore, “that They should be
better rewarded for killing him there.” And in this Confusion, the
Room being full and all speaking together, the Fellow who had given him
the Blow, whose Name was <HI>Howard,</HI> a very lusty strong Man, took him
<MILESTONE N="10"/>by the Hand, and swore, “They should hurt one another if They killed
him there; and therefore They would take him into the Court, and dis∣patch
him where there was more Room.” And thereupon others laid
their Hands upon him and pulled him to the Ground, and then dragged
him into the Court, being in the same Instant ready to run their Swords
into him together: When in the Moment their Ensign, and some of the
Magistrates with a Guard, came into the Court, the Gate being broken;
and so He was rescued out of their bloody Hands, and carried back into his
Chamber.</P>
<P>HOWARD and many of the other, some whereof had been hurt with Swords
<MILESTONE N="20"/>as They entered at the Window, were taken and carried to Prison, and the
rest dispersed, vowing Revenge when They should get the rest of their Com∣pany
together: And it cannot be expressed with how much Fear the Ma∣gistrates,
and the poor Guard that attended them, apprehended their com∣ing
upon them together again.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor himself had the Hurt before mentioned in his Head,
which was a Contusion, and already swollen to a great Bigness; <HI>Monsieur
Le Fonde</HI> was shot into the Head with a Brace of Bullets, and bled much,
but seemed not to think himself in Danger; two of the Chancellor's Servants
were hurt with Swords, and lost much Blood: So that They all desired to
<MILESTONE N="30"/>be in some secure Place, that Physicians and Surgeons might visit them.
And by this Time many Persons of Quality of the Town, both Men and
Women, filled the little Chamber; bitterly inveighing against the Villany of
the Attempt, but renewing the Dispute of their Jurisdiction. And the Pro∣vost,
who out of the City was the greater Officer, would provide an Ac∣commodation
for them in his own House in the City, and appoint a Guard
for them; which the Magistrates of the City would not consent to, nor He
to the Expedient proposed by them. And this Dispute with Animosity and
very ill Words continued in the Chamber till Twelve of the Clock at Night,
the hurt Persons being in the mean Time without any Remedy or Ease: So
<MILESTONE N="40"/>that the Magistrates, though They were not so dangerous, were as trouble∣some
as the Seamen, against whom They were not yet secure upon a second
Attempt.</P>
<P>IN the End; <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde</HI> was forced to raise his Voice louder
than was agreeable to the State He was in, to threaten to complain of them
to the King, for their Neglect before and after the Mischief was done: By
which They were much moved, and presently sent to the Governour of the
Duke of <HI>Bouillon's</HI> Castle (which is a good and noble House in the Town),
“that He would receive the Chancellor and <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde,</HI> with such
Servants as were necessary for their Attendance;” which He did with great
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Courtesy, and gave them such Accommodation as in an unfurnished House
could on the Sudden be expected. And so Physicians and Surgeons visited
their Wounds, and applied such present Remedies as were necessary, till upon
some Repose They might make a better Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="480"/>
THE same Night there were Expresses dispatched to the Court to give
Advertisement of the Outrage, and to <HI>Roan</HI> to inform the Intendant in
whose Province it was committed: And He the next Day with a good Guard
of Horse arrived at <HI>Eureux.</HI> After He had visited the Chancellor, with
the just Sense of the Insolence He had undergone, and of the Indignity that
the King and his Government had sustained; He proceeded in the Court of
Justice to examine the whole Proceedings, and much blamed the Magistrates
on all Sides for their Negligence and Remissness. Upon the whole Examina∣tion
there appeared no Cause to believe, that there was any formed Design
in which any others had concurred than They who appeared in the Execu∣tion,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
who defended themselves by being drunk, which did not appear in
any other Thing than in the Barbarity of the Action. Yet it was confessed,
that upon their first Arrival at <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and whilst They were quartered
there, the Chancellor then passing by between <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> They had
a Resolution to have robbed or killed him, if They had not been prevented
by his getting the Gates opened, and so going away before the usual Hour.</P>
<P>THE Surgeons found <HI>Monsieur Le Fonde's</HI> Wound to be more dangerous
than They had apprehended, and that at least one of the Bullets remained still
in the Wound, and doubted that it might have hurt the Scull, in which
Case trepanning would be necessary; which made him resolve, though He<MILESTONE N="20"/>
was feverish, presently to have a <HI>Brancard</HI> made, and to be put into it in
his Bed, and so with Expedition to be carried to <HI>Paris,</HI> where He was sure
to find better Operators, besides the Benefit and Convenience of his own
House and Family. And so the third Day after his Misadventure, and after
He had given his Testimony to the Intendant, He was in that Manner, and
attended by a Surgeon, conveyed to <HI>Paris;</HI> and, by the Blessing of God,
recovered without the Remedy that had been proposed.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, after He had bled once or twice, found himself only in
Pain with the Blow, without any other Symptoms which frequently attend
great Contusions; and therefore He positively rejected the Proposition of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
trepanning, which had been likewise earnestly urged by the Surgeons: And
upon Application of such Plasters and Ointments as were prescribed, He
found both the Pain and Swelling lessen by Degrees, though the Memory of
the Blow lasted long; so that He thought himself fit enough for his Journey,
and was impatient to be out of that unlucky Town; and his Servants,
having only Flesh-Hurts, could endure the Coach as well as He. The In∣tendant,
who knew his Desire, and was willing to defer his Judgment till
He was gone from thence, was very well content that He should proceed in
his Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He removes from thence to</HI> Bourbon.</NOTE> and sent his Sons with his own Troop to convoy him two or
three Leagues out of the Town; and appointed the Provost with his Troop<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of Horse to attend him to his Lodging that Night, and farther if He de∣sired
it. And the next Day He condemned <HI>Howard</HI> and two others, an
<HI>Englishman,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> and an <HI>Irishman</HI> (for the Company consisted of
the three Nations), to be broken upon the Wheel; which was executed ac∣cordingly.
And shortly after his Arrival at <HI>Bourbon, Monsieur De Lioune</HI>
writ a very civil Letter to the Chancellor, “of the Trouble the King sus∣tained
for the Affront and Danger He had undergone; and that his Ma∣jesty
was very ill satisfied, that so few as three had been sacrificed to
Justice for so barbarous a Crime.”</P>
<P>WHEN He had stayed as long at <HI>Bourbon</HI> in the Use of the Waters,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And from thence to</HI> A∣vignon.</NOTE> as the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Physicians prescribed (in which Time He found a good Recovery of his
Strength, save that the Weakness of his Feet still continued in an uneasy
Degree); and had received great Civilities during his Abode there from all
<PB N="475" REF="481"/>
the <HI>French</HI> of Quality, Men and Women, who came thither for the same
Remedies, and with whom the Town then abounded; He prosecuted his
Journey to <HI>Avignon:</HI> And having stayed a Week at <HI>Lyons,</HI> without any new
ill Accident He arrived about the Middle of <HI>June</HI> there, by the pleasant
Passage of the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH He desired to make his Journey as privately as He could, and
had no more Servants in his Train than was necessary to the State of Health
He was in; yet He was known in most Places by the Presence of <HI>English,</HI>
or by some other Accident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His good Re∣ception there.</NOTE> And some Friends at <HI>Paris</HI> had given such Ad∣vertisement
<MILESTONE N="10"/>to <HI>Avignon,</HI> that when He arrived there, He had no sooner en∣tered
into a private Lodging, which He procured the next Day, but the
Vice-Legate came to visit him in great State and with much Civility, offering
all the Commodities of that Place if He would reside there. The Archbi∣shop,
a very reverend and learned Prelate, a <HI>Genoese,</HI> as the Vice-Legate
likewise was, performed the same Ceremony to him; and afterwards the
Consuls and Magistrates of the City in a Body (who made a Speech to him
in <HI>Latin,</HI> as all the rest treated him in that Language), and all the principal
Officers of the Court: So that He could not receive more Civility and Res∣pect
in any Place; which, together with the Cheapness and Convenience of
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Living, and the Pleasantness of the Country about it, might have inclined
him to reside there. Yet the ill Savour of the Streets by the Multitude of
Dyers and of the Silk-Manufactures, and the worse Smell of the <HI>Jews,</HI> made
him doubt that it could be no pleasant Place to make an Abode in during the
Heat of Summer: And therefore receiving new Confirmation by Letters from
<HI>Paris,</HI> “that He was entirely at Liberty to reside where He would in <HI>France,</HI>”
He resolved to take a View of some Places before He would conclude where
to fix; and the Fame of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> that was within two little Days Jour∣ney,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes to</HI> Montpelier.</NOTE>
invited him thither. And so after a Week's Stay at <HI>Avignon,</HI> and after
having returned all the Visits He had received, He went from thence, and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>came to <HI>Montpelier</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>IT was his very good Fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Where He re∣ceives great Civilities from the Lady</HI> Mor∣daunt.</NOTE> that an <HI>English</HI> Lady of eminent Virtue
and Merit, the Lady Viscountess <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who had in the Beginning of
the Winter before, in as great Weakness of Body as Nature can subsist with,
transported herself thither, remained still at <HI>Montpelier;</HI> where She had mi∣raculously,
by the Benefit of that Air, recovered a comfortable Degree of
Health: And the News of her being still there was a great Motive to his
Journey from <HI>Avignon</HI> thither. The Chancellor had no Mind to be taken
Notice of; but some Relations which that Lady made to his Advantage,
and the great Esteem that City had of her, made his Reception there more
<MILESTONE N="40"/>formal and ceremonious than He desired.</P>
<P>THE Marquis <HI>De Castro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Respect paid to him there.</NOTE> Governour of the City and Castle, visited him
and welcomed him to the Town, though He had not so much as a Pass to
come thither. The <HI>Premier</HI> President, and all the other Courts, and the
Consul and other Magistrates of the City, visited him in their several Bodies,
and entertained him in <HI>Latin.</HI> It is true, that some Days after, the In∣tendant
of the Province (who was not then in the Town) came thither; and
He had received Orders from the Court, as soon as it was known that
the Chancellor was in <HI>Montpelier,</HI> “that He should be looked upon and
treated as a Person of whom the <HI>Most Christian</HI> King had a good Esteem:”
<MILESTONE N="50"/>And so, as soon as He came to the Town, He visited him with much
Ceremony, and told him, “that He had received a particular Command
from the King to do him all the Services He could in that City, and in
the Province of <HI>Languedoc.</HI>” And it must be confessed, that during his
<PB N="476" REF="482"/>
Residence in <HI>Montpelier,</HI> which was not above one or two Months less than
three Years, He did receive as much Civility and formal Courtesy from all
Persons of all Conditions in that Place, or who occasionally resorted thither,
as could have been performed towards him, if He had been sent thither as
a publick Person. And when the Duke of <HI>Vernueil</HI> (who was Governour
of the Province, and used to convene the States thither every Year) came to
<HI>Montpelier,</HI> as He did three Times in those three Years, He always visited
the Chancellor, and shewed a very great Respect to him: Which was as great
a Countenance as He could receive.</P>
<P>YET He did always acknowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which He im∣putes to the Friendship of Lady</HI> Mor∣daunt.</NOTE> that He owed all the Civilities which<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He received at his first coming thither, and which were upon the Matter
the first Civilities He had received in <HI>France,</HI> purely to the Friendship of the
Lady <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> and to the great Credit She had there: And for which,
and the Consolation He received from her during the Time of her Stay
there, He had ever a great Respect for her and her Husband; who, coming
likewise thither, when He received Information from <HI>England</HI> of a Design
to assassinate him by some <HI>Irish,</HI> manifested a noble Affection for him, and
stayed some Months longer than He intended to have done, that He might
see the Issue of that Design. Of which He had a just Sense, and trans∣mitted
the Information of it to his Children, to the End that They and<MILESTONE N="20"/>
his Friends might, upon all Opportunities, acknowledge it to them Both.</P>
<P>AND in Truth the great Respect the Place had for him was notorious,
when any <HI>English</HI> came thither, and forbore to pay any Respect to the
Chancellor; as only one Gentleman did, Sir <HI>Richard Temple,</HI> who publickly
declared “that He would not visit him,” and dissuaded others from doing
it as a Matter the Parliament would punish them for, and shewed much
Vanity and Insolence in his Discourses concerning him: But He found so
little Countenance from any Person of Condition, though He called himself
“the <HI>Premier</HI> President of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI>” and such a general
Aversion towards him; that as They who came with him, and his other<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Friends, deserted him and paid their Civilities to the Chancellor, so himself
grew so ridiculous, that He left the Town sooner than He intended, and
left the Reputation behind him of a very vain, humorous and sordid Person.</P>
<P>AND having thus accompanied the Chancellor through all his ill Treat∣ments
and Misadventures to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> where He resolved to stay, it will
be to no Purpose farther to continue this Relation; otherwise than as him∣self
afterwards communicated his private Thoughts and Reflections to his
Friends.</P>
<P>WHEN He found himself at this Ease, and with those convenient Ac∣commodations,
that He might reasonably believe He should be no more<MILESTONE N="40"/>
exposed to the Troubles and Distresses which He had passed through; He
began to think of composing his Mind to his Fortune, and of regulating
and governing his own Thoughts and Affections towards such a Tranquillity,
as the Sickness of Mind and Body, and the continued sharp Fatigue in the
six or seven precedent Months, had not suffered to enter into any formed
Deliberation. And it pleased God in a short Time, after some Recollections,
and upon his entire Confidence in him, to restore him to that Serenity of
Mind, and Resignation of himself to the Disposal and good Pleasure of God,
that They who conversed most with him could not discover the least Murmur
or Impatience in him, or any Unevenness in his Conversations. He resolved<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to improve his Understanding of the <HI>French</HI> Language, not towards speaking
it, the Defect of which He found many Conveniences in, but for the reading
any Books; and to learn the <HI>Italian:</HI> Towards Both which He made a com∣petent
<PB N="477" REF="483"/>
Progress, and had Opportunity to buy or borrow any good Books He
desired to peruse.</P>
<P>BUT in the first Place He thought He was indebted to his own Reputa∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes a Vindication of himself.</NOTE>
and obliged for the Information of his Children and other Friends, to
vindicate himself from those Aspersions and Reproaches which the Malice of
his Enemies had cast upon him in the Parliament; which, though never re∣duced
into any formal or legal Charge, nor offered to be proved by any one
Witness, were yet maliciously scattered abroad and divulged to take away
his Credit. And the Performance of this Work, that was so necessarily
<MILESTONE N="10"/>incumbent to him, was the more difficult, by his constant and uninterrupted
Fidelity and Zeal for the King's Service, and his Resolution to say Nothing
on his own Behalf and for his own Vindication, that might in the least
Degree reflect upon his Majesty; which Consideration had before kept him
from charging those who persecuted him, with such indirect and naughty
Proceedings as might have put an End to their Power. Nor did He think
fit in that Conjuncture, when his Majesty had not yet met with that Com∣pliance
and Submission from the Parliament since the Chancellor's Remove,
as had been promised to him as the Effect of that Counsel, to publish,
that his coming away (which was the greatest Blot upon his Reputation)
<MILESTONE N="20"/>was with the King's Privity, and at least with his Approbation. However
He was resolved to commit into the Custody of his Children, who He knew
could never commit a Fault against his Majesty, such a plain, particular De∣fence
of his Innocence upon every one of the Reproaches He had been charged
with, that themselves might infallibly know his Uprightness and Integrity in
all his Ministry, which They observed and knew too much of to suspect;
and might likewise manifestly convince other Men, who were willing to be
undeceived: But the Manner of doing it, in Respect of the former Consi∣deration,
He left to their Discretion. And having prepared this, and caused
it to be fairly transcribed, before the Lord and Lady <HI>Mordaunt</HI> returned for
<MILESTONE N="30"/><HI>England;</HI> He committed it to their Care, who delivered it safely to the
Hands of his Sons.</P>
<P>THEY were themselves upon that Disadvantage under the Reproach of
their Relation, that the eldest of them was removed from his Attendance
upon the Queen for many Months, without the Allegation of any Crime;
and the other was retained only by the Goodness of the King, against the
greatest Importunity that could be applied: And therefore it concerned them
to be very wary in giving any Offence, of which their Adversaries might
take any Advantage. Besides, They observed that They, whose Credit and
Interest had done all the Mischief to their Father, were now fallen out
<MILESTONE N="40"/>amongst themselves with equal Animosity, and had all carried themselves so
ill with Reference to the Publick, and so loosely and licentiously in Order
to a good Name, that their being Enemies brought little Prejudice to any
Man's Reputation; and many of those, who had been made Instruments to
deprave the Chancellor, were not scrupulous in declaring how They had
been cozened, and how unjustly He had been traduced and accused: So that
They made no other Use of the Answer and Vindication They had received,
than to be thereby enabled to make a perfect Relation of some particular
Matters of Fact which were variously reported, and could not be understood
by any but those who had been conversant in the Transactions.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>IT will be therefore necessary in this Place, since there hath been before so
methodical an Account of all that the Committee brought into the House of
Commons against him, and never after mentioned when They had once ac∣cused
him, to insert such a short Answer and Defence to all that was alleged,
<PB N="478" REF="484"/>
out of that Vindication which He sent from <HI>Montpelier,</HI> that Nothing may
remain in the possible Thoughts of any worthy and uncorrupted Man that
may reflect upon his Sincerity, or leave any Taint upon his Memory; the
Preservation of which from being sullied by the Misfortunes which befell him,
is the only End of this Discourse, never to be communicated, or perused
by any but his nearest Relations; who, by the Blessing of God, can never
but retain that Affection and Duty to the Crown and for the Royal Family,
that by the Laws of God and Man is due to it and them, and without
which They can never expect God's Blessing in this or the World to come.
And in this I shall observe the Order I used before in the Mention of the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
several Allegations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer to the several Articles of the Charge against him.</NOTE> omitting upon any Particular the Repetition of what
hath been at large already said in this Discourse, which shall be referred to
for Answer.</P>
<Q>TO the FIRST then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had designed a standing Army, and to
govern the Kingdom thereby; advised the King to dissolve the present
Parliament, and to lay aside all Thoughts of future Parliaments; to
govern by military Power, and to maintain the same by free Quarter
and Contribution</HI> (which, if true, whether it was Treason or no, must
worthily have made him odious to all honest Men):</Q>
<P>THE Answer which He then made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> and which was dated at <HI>Montpelier</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
upon the twenty fourth of <HI>July</HI> 1668, within few Days after his Arrival
there and Resolution to stay there, was in these Words. He said, As No∣thing
could be more surprising to him, nor He thought to any Man else,
than to find himself, after near thirty Years Service of the Crown in the
highest Trust; after having passed all the Time of his Majesty's Exile with
him beyond the Seas and in his Service, and in which the indefatigable Pains
He took was notorious to many Nations; and after He had the Honour and
Happiness to return again with his Majesty into <HI>England,</HI> and to receive
from him so many eminent Marks of his Favour, and to serve him near eight
Years after his Return in the Place of the greatest Trust, without ever having<MILESTONE N="30"/>
discovered that his Majesty was offended with him, or in Truth that He
had ever the least ill Success from any Counsel He had ever given him; or
that any Persons of Honour and Reputation, or Interest in the Nation, had
ever made the least Complaint against him, or had any Thought that the
Miscarriages (for Miscarriages were enough spoken of) had proceeded from
him, or from any Advice of his: He said, that as after all this He could not
but be exceedingly surprised to find himself on a Sudden, when He had not
the least Imagination of it, bereft of the King's Favour, and fallen so far
from his Kindness, even within three or four Days after his Majesty had
vouchsafed to condole with him in his House for the Death of his Wife, that<MILESTONE N="40"/>
He resolved to take the Great Seal from him; so it was no small Comfort to
him to see and know, that very few Men of Honour and Reputation ap∣proved
or liked what was done; but that the same was contrived, pursued,
and brought to pass by Men and Women of no Credit in the Nation; by
Men, who had never served his Majesty or his blessed Father eminently or
usefully, but most of them of Trust and Credit under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or never
of Credit to do the King the least Service; and who were only angry with
him for not being pleased with their vicious and debauched Lives, or for op∣posing
and dissuading their loose and unreasonable Counsels, which They
were every Day audaciously administering in Matters of the highest Moment,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
with great License and Presumption.</P>
<P>BUT above all, He said, it was of the highest Consolation to him, when
it was publickly and industriously declared, “that the King was firmly re∣solved
<PB N="479" REF="485"/>
to destroy him, and would take it very well from all Men who would
contribute thereunto, by bringing in any Charge or Accusation against
him;” when the most notorious Enemies He had were the only Persons
trusted in Employment, Men who had most eminently disserved and mali∣ciously
traduced the King, and had been to that Time looked upon as such
by his Majesty; and when all, who were believed to have any Kindness for the
Chancellor, were discountenanced and ill looked upon; when Men of all
Conditions and Degrees were daily solicited and importuned, by Promises and
Threats, to declare themselves against him, at least if They would not be
<MILESTONE N="10"/>wrought over to do any Thing against their Conscience, that They would
absent themselves from those Debates: That all this Malice and Conspiracy,
with so long Deliberation and Consultation, should not be able at last to
produce and exhibit any other Charge and Accusation against him, but such
a one as most Men who knew him, or who had any Trust or Employment
in the publick Affairs, were well able to vindicate him from the Guilt of,
and even his Enemies themselves did not believe. The Particulars whereof,
He said, as far as He could take Notice of them, they having not been to
that Day reduced into any Form, so much as in the House of Commons
itself, He would then examine: And if He should appear too tedious in the
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Examination and Disquisition of them, and to say more than was necessary
in his own Defence, and to mention many particular Persons in another
Manner than is usual upon Occasions of this Kind; He desired it might
be remembered and considered, that this was not written as a formal An∣swer
to an Impeachment, nor like to be published in his Life-Time, a
Judgment of Banishment being passed against him (without the least Proof
made or offered for the making good any one Article of Treason or Misde∣meanor)
by Act of Parliament; but that it was a Debt due to his Children
and Posterity, that They might know (how much soever They were involved
or might be in the Effects of the sharp Malice against him) how far He was
<MILESTONE N="30"/>from any Guilt of those odious Crimes which had been so odiously laid to
his Charge.</P>
<P>AND that being his End, He might be excused if He did so far enlarge
upon all Particulars, that it might be manifest unto them how far He had
been from treading in those Paths, or having been accessory to those Coun∣sels,
which had been the Source from whence all those bitter Waters had
flowed, that had corrupted the Taste even almost of the whole Nation. And
in Order to that so necessary Discourse and Vindication of his Integrity and
Honour, He could only take Notice of the printed Paper of those Heads
for a Charge, that had been reported from the Committee to the House;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>all Correspondence and Communication being so strictly inhibited to all Kind
of Men to hold any Kind of Commerce with him, except his Children and
menial Servants, who only had Liberty to write unto him of his own do∣mestick
Affairs; and the Letters which They should write or receive were
to be first communicated to one of the Secretaries of State.</P>
<P>TO the Charge of the first Article itself He said; it was no great Vanity
to believe, that there was not one Person in <HI>England</HI> of any Quality to
whom He was in any Degree known, who believed him guilty of that
Charge: And that He wanted not a Cloud of Witnesses (besides the Testi∣mony
that He hoped his Majesty himself would vouchsafe to give him in that
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Particular) who, from all that They had heard him say in Council and in Con∣versation,
could vindicate him from having that odious Opinion. Having
had the Honour, by the special Command of his late Majesty of blessed Me∣mory,
to attend the Prince, his now Majesty, into the Parts beyond the
<PB N="480" REF="486"/>
Seas, and to be always with him and in his Service those many Years of his
Exile, and till his happy Return; He had always endeavoured to imprint
in his Majesty's Mind an Affection, Esteem and Reverence for the Laws of
the Land; “without the trampling of which under Foot,” He told him
“that himself could not have been oppressed; and that by the Vindication
and Support of them, He could only hope and expect Honour and Secu∣rity
to the Crown.” Upon that Foundation and declared Judgment (He
said) He came into the Service of the King his Father, by opposing all ir∣regular
and illegal Proceedings in Parliament; and that He had never swerved
from that Rule in any Advice and Counsel He had given to him or to his<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Son.</P>
<P>FROM the Time of his Majesty's happy Return from beyond the Seas, He
had taken Nothing so much to Heart, as the Establishment of the due Ad∣ministration
of Justice throughout the Kingdom according to the known
Laws of the Land, as the best Expedient He could think of for the compo∣sing
the general Distempers of the Nation, and uniting the Hearts of the
People in a true Obedience unto, and Reverence for, his Majesty's Person
and Government. And with what Success He had served his Majesty in that
Province (which He had been pleased principally to commit to his Care and
Trust), He did appeal to the whole Nation; and whether the oldest Man<MILESTONE N="20"/>
could remember, that in the best Times Justice was ever more equally ad∣ministered,
and with less Complaint and Murmur; which had been fre∣quently
acknowledged from all the Parts of the Kingdom, and had been
often taken Notice of by the King himself with great Approbation, and
confessed by most of the Nobility upon several Occasions. He said, He
had often declared in Parliament the King's Affection and Reverence for
the Laws, and his Resolution neither to swerve from them himself, nor to
suffer any Body else to do so: And upon the publick Occasions of swearing
the Judges in any Courts, He had always enjoined them “to be very strict
and precise in the Administration of Justice according to Law, with all<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Equality, and without Respect of Persons, which the King expected from
them; and that as his Majesty resolved never to interpose by Message or
Letter for the Advancement or Favour of any Man's Right or Title, so
He would take it very ill if any Subject (how great soever) should be able
to pervert them.” And He did believe there had never passed so many
Years together in any Age, in which the Crown had not in the least Degree
interposed in any Cause or Title depending in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> to incline
the Court to this or that Side; or in which the Crown itself hath had so many
Causes judged against it in several Courts: At least in which former Prac∣tice
and Usage on the Behalf of the Crown hath been less followed. And<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Nothing is more known, than that from the Time of the King's blessed Re∣turn
into <HI>England,</HI> even to the Preparation of that Charge against him,
He had been reproached with Nothing so much as his too much adhering
to the Law, and subjecting all Persons to it: And this Reproach had not
been cast upon him so bitterly and so maliciously by any, and in Places where
They thought it might produce most Prejudice to him, as by those who
now contrived that Charge, and who had been always great Enemies to
the Law.</P>
<P>ALL this, and much more of the same Kind, He said, was manifest to all
the World: And therefore He needed not more to labour in that Vindication.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
Yet He could not but observe, that there was not in all the King's Forces,
nor was when his Forces were much greater than They were at that present,
one Officer recommended by him: And most of them were such who pro∣fessed
<PB N="481" REF="487"/>
publickly a great Animosity against him, having been, by the Malice
of some Men, very unreasonably persuaded that the Chancellor was their
Enemy; that He desired that They might be disbanded, or at least so
obliged to the Rules of the Law, that They should be every Day cast into
Prison. And They had indeed found, that in some Insolencies which the
Soldiers had committed contrary to the Law, and some Pretences which
They made to Privileges against Arrests, and the like, He had always op∣posed
their Desires with more Warmth than other Men had done; as believ∣ing
it might be the Cause of notable Disorders, and more alienate the Affec∣tion
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of the People from the Soldiers: So that it could not be thought pro∣bable,
that He should contribute his Advice <HI>for the raising a Standing Army,
and that the Kingdom should be governed thereby;</HI> when there were very few
Men so like to be destroyed by that Army as himself, who was so industri∣ously
rendered to be odious to it.</P>
<P>TO the other Part of that first Article, <HI>that He did advise the King to dis∣solve
the present Parliament, and to lay aside all Thoughts of Parliaments for
the future, &amp;c.</HI> which it was said two Privy Counsellors were ready to prove;
He made a Relation of all that had passed in that Consternation when the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet came into the River as far as <HI>Chatham,</HI> and when the Debate
<MILESTONE N="20"/>was in Council upon the reconvening the Parliament in <HI>August,</HI> when it
stood prorogued till <HI>October,</HI> which the Chancellor affirmed could not legally
be done; all which is more at large related in this Discourse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 419. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> of the Time
when those Transactions passed, and so need not to be repeated in this Place.</P>
<Q>THE SECOND Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had, in the Hearing of many of his
Majesty's Subjects, falsely and maliciously said,</HI> That the King was in
his Heart a Papist, popishly affected, <HI>or Words to that Effect.</HI></Q>
<P>HE said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that He had Occasion too often, throughout the whole Charge,
to acknowledge and magnify the great Goodness of God Almighty, that, since
He thought not fit (for his greater Humiliation, and it may be to correct the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Pride of a good Conscience) to preserve him entirely from those Aspersions
of Infamy, and those <HI>Flagella Linguae,</HI> those Strokes of the Tongue, which
always leave some Mark or Scar in the Reputation they desire to wound;
He had yet infused into the Hearts of his Enemies, who had suggested and
contrived this Persecution against him, to lay such Crimes to his Charge as
his Nature is known most to abhor, and which cannot only not be believed,
but must be contradicted, and a Vindication of him from that Guilt must
be made, by all Men who know him to any Degree, or who have been
much in his Company. And as Justice would have required it, so the usual
Form in Cases of this Nature doth exact, that in so general a Charge They
<MILESTONE N="40"/>should have named one single Person of those many, in whose Hearing He
had laid that odious Imputation upon the King: And every Man will
presume, that one such Person would have been named, if He could have
been found.</P>
<P>THERE was no Man then alive, He said, who had had the Honour to be
so many Years about or near the Person of the King as He had been: No
Man, who knew more of the Temptation his Majesty had undergone, and
the Assaults He had sustained, in the Matter of Religion, during the whole
Time of his Exile; when almost a total Despair possessed the Spirits of most
Men of his own Religion, that He would recover his Regality; and the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Hopes and Promises and Assurances were so pregnant of very many of all
Conditions, that He would suddenly recover it if He would change it. No
Man knew so well, with what Christian Courage his Majesty had repelled
<PB N="482" REF="488"/>
those Assaults, or with what pious Contempt and Indignation He resisted
and rejected those Temptations. Nor had any Man, He thought, held so
many Discourses with his Majesty concerning Religion as He had done;
and sooner and more clearly discerned the Reproaches He would undergo
from that innate Candour in his princely Nature, which disposed him to
receive any Addresses, or to hear any Discourses, which those of several Fac∣tions
in Religion with great Presumption have used to present to him:
Whilst his Majesty hath, with equal Temper and singular Benignity, heard
all; and, pitying their Errours, dismissed them with Evidence, that their
Arguments were too weak to make Impression upon his Judgment. Which<MILESTONE N="10"/>
though They knew well, yet either Party, out of the Vanity of their
Hearts, used all the Endeavours They could to get it believed, that the
King was propitious to them and their Party. And the <HI>Papists,</HI> being
most presumptuous in particular, and in their dark Walks in several Coun∣ties
making it a special Argument to their Proselytes, and those They en∣deavoured
to make so, that the King favoured them, and was of their
Religion in his Heart (of which, and the great Prejudice it brought upon
his Majesty, He frequently received Advertisements from many Persons of
Honour, and of warm Affections to the Government); of which He had
always informed the King, who was exceedingly offended at their Folly<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and Presumption, and wished “that some of them might be apprehended,
and prosecuted with the utmost Rigour; and that some such Prosecution
might be made against all the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and that They might be
convicted;” which He always gave in Charge to the Judges accordingly.
And upon that and the like-Occasions He had a just and necessary Opportu∣nity
to enlarge, in the Presence of many Persons of Honour and Interest in
the Kingdom, upon the Sincerity of the King's Religion, and his constant
Exercise of it when He suffered by it; giving such Instances of many Par∣ticulars
as were pertinent to the Discourse: Of which Endeavours of his,
and of some Fruit thereof, He doubted not but that many of as consider∣able<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Persons as are in <HI>England</HI> would be ready to give him their Testimony.
And (He said) He might without Vanity say, that He had more than an
ordinary Part in the framing and promoting that Act of Parliament, that
hath made those seditious Discourses, <HI>of the King's being a</HI> Papist <HI>in his
Heart, or popisbly affected,</HI> so very penal as they are: And therefore there
would be Need of an undoubted and uncontroulable Evidence, that He
had so soon run into that Crime himself. Which was all He would for
the present say upon that second Article.</P>
<Q>THE THIRD Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had received great Sums of Money for
passing the</HI> Canary <HI>Patent, and other illegal Patents; and granted se∣veral<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Injunctions to stop Proceedings at Law against them, and other il∣legal
Patents formerly granted.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that He had presumed in his humble Address to the
House of Peers to assure their Lordships, <HI>that He had never received one
Penny over and above the just Perquisites of his Office, according to the Pre∣cedents
and Practice of the best Times, which He conceived to be those of the
Lord</HI> Coventry <HI>and the Lord</HI> Ellesmere; <HI>and which He had made his Rule
in all that He had received, excepting only what He had from the immediate
Bounty of the King.</HI> And as He had always done all that was in his Power
to prevent and stop all illegal Patents, so He did believe that there would<MILESTONE N="50"/>
be more Patents then found in the Office, which had been stopped by him,
than by any of his Predecessors in so short a Time. He never granted any
Injunctions in the Cases mentioned in the Charge, nor in any Case, where,
<PB N="483" REF="489"/>
by the Course of the Court and the Rules of Justice, it was not warranted.
And for the <HI>Canary</HI> Patent, and the Original, and all the Proceedings
thereupon, so much is said in the Body of this Discourse according to the
Time it was transacted in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 154. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, that there needs no Repetition of it in this
Place.</P>
<Q>THE FOURTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Article.</NOTE> <HI>that He had advised and procured divers of
his Majesty's Subjects to be imprisoned against Law in remote Islands,
Garrisons and other Places; thereby to prevent them from the Benefit of
the Law, and to introduce Precedents for imprisoning of other of his
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Majesty's Subjects in like Manner.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> He knew not what Answer to make to that Ar∣ticle,
it being so general, and no particular Person being named: But, He
said, it was generally known, that He had never taken it upon him to
commit any Man to Prison, but such who, by the Course of the Chancery,
for Matters of Contempt are justly and necessarily to be committed. It
was probable that He had been present at the Council-Board, when many
Persons had been ordered to be committed, and whose Commitment hath
by the Wisdom of that Board been thought just and necessary; and there∣fore
He was not to answer apart for any Thing done by them. Only He
<MILESTONE N="20"/>might say, that He was frequently of Opinion that the Commitments were
very necessary: And it was notoriously known, that by such Commitments
some Rebellions or Insurrections had been prevented; and that other Per∣sons,
who were afterwards attainted and executed for High Treason, had
upon their Examinations and at their Death confessed, that their Pur∣pose
had been to rise in Arms at such and such Times, if their Friends
upon whom They had principally relied had not been then committed to
Prison. And, He said, He did well remember, that it was thought fit that
most of the Persons who stand attainted for the Murder of the late King,
his Majesty's Royal Father, should be removed out of the <HI>Tower,</HI> and dis∣persed
<MILESTONE N="30"/>into several Islands and Garrisons: And if any other Persons had
been likewise sent thither, He presumed it was upon such Reasons, as
upon a due Examination thereof would make it appear to be very just.</P>
<P>THE FIFTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had corruptly sold several Offices con∣trary
to Law.</HI></P>
<P>THIS He positively denied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE></P>
<Q>THE SIXTH was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixth Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had procured his Majesty's Customs to be farmed
at Underrates, knowing the same; and great pretended Debts to be
paid by his Majesty, to the Payment whereof his Majesty was not in
Strictness bound; and that He had received great Sums of Money for
<MILESTONE N="40"/>procuring the same.</HI></Q>
<P>TO this He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> He had never had any Thing to do in the disposing his
Majesty's Customs, or any other Part of his Revenue, except for some short
Time after his Majesty's first Arrival in <HI>England;</HI> when He, amongst others
of the Lords of the Council, was a Commissioner for the Treasury: During
which Time there was no Farm let of any of the Revenue, and the Cus∣toms
were put into the Hands of Commissioners, to the End that a Com∣putation
might be made as near as was possible of the full Value of them,
before that it should be put into a Farm, which every Man conceived would
be fit to be done as soon as might be. The White Staff was shortly after
<MILESTONE N="50"/>given to the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> (to whom his Majesty had designed it before
He returned), and the Chancellorship of the Exchequer to the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI>
the Lord Chancellor having resigned it into his Majesty's Hands, which
<PB N="484" REF="490"/>
He had been possessed of for many Years in the Time of the late King, and
retained it till after his Majesty's Return: And from the Time that those
two Officers of the Revenue were made, which determined the former
Commission, He never intermeddled in the Customs, or in any other Branch
of the Revenue; except when the King commanded him to be present in
some Consultations which He had with the Lord Treasurer, and when
there were other Lords of the Council present. That excellent Person, the
Lord Treasurer, always resorted to the King for his Direction, in all Mat∣ters
of the least Difficulty which occurred to him in the Administration of
his Office; and frequently did desire to confer with the Chancellor (with<MILESTONE N="10"/>
whom He was known to have held a long and a fast Friendship) upon many
Particulars of his Office, believing that He was not altogether ignorant in
that Administration, with which He had been formerly so well acquainted.
And that He conceived might be the Reason, why He did oftentimes
procure him to be joined with him in References from the King, upon
Matters wholly relating to his own Office. But the Chancellor did never
then suffer any particular Application to be made to him in those Cases,
nor had ever secret Conferences with any Persons who were concerned in
those Pretensions.</P>
<P>WHAT was meant <HI>by his having procured his Majesty's Customs to be<MILESTONE N="20"/>
farmed at Underrates, knowing the same; and great pretended Debts to be
paid by his Majesty, to the Payment whereof his Majesty was not in Strictness
bound;</HI> He said, He could not imagine, except it did relate to the Pay∣ment
of a Debt due from his late Majesty to some of the Farmers. In which
though He had no more to do, than in giving Information and his particu∣lar
Advice to his Majesty, in the Presence of the Lord Treasurer, the Chan∣cellor
of the Exchequer, and other of the Lords, and so was not himself
responsible for what his Majesty did thereupon; yet He thought himself
obliged upon this Particular, which so much concerned the Honour and
Justice of the late King and of his present Majesty, to enlarge, and relate all<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He knew of what their Majesties did, and what induced his present Ma∣jesty
to do his Part in it.</P>
<P>HE said, it was notoriously known, that before the late Troubles, and
in the very first Entrance into them, his Majesty was necessitated to borrow
very great Sums of Money from his then Farmers of his Customs, and to
oblige them to stand personally bound for many other great Sums of
Money, which other Men lent to his Majesty upon their Security. That
thereupon, and for the Repayment of those Sums which the Farmers had
advanced, and for securing them from any Damage for those Monies which
others had lent upon their Obligations; his late Majesty, with the Advice of<MILESTONE N="40"/>
the then Lord Treasurer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had granted
a farther Lease of his Customs to those Farmers for three or four Years to
come, after the Expiration of their former Lease; with a Covenant on his
Majesty's Part, to pay the just Interest for all such Monies as were advanced
by them, or for which They stood bound; and likewise that They should,
out of their growing Rent, deduct such Sums of Money by the Year, as
They had lent or been bound for, according to such Proportions yearly as
was agreed upon. That it was as well known, that shortly after the Be∣ginning
of the Parliament in 1640, and before the Commencement of the
second Lease, the House of Commons did not only force the said Farmers<MILESTONE N="50"/>
to pay a very great Sum of Money for their Presumption in receiving Cus∣toms
and Impositions upon Merchandise in the former Years, when They
pretended such Payments were not due; but took also from them their new
<PB N="485" REF="491"/>
Lease granted to them by the King, and so left them without any Capa∣city
of reimbursing themselves of the Money They had lent, and likewise
at the Mercy of their Creditors to whom They stood bound; many of
whom quickly began to exercise that Severity towards them, that many of
the poor Gentlemen had their Estates extended upon Judgments and Re∣cognizances,
and their Persons taken in Execution and committed to Pri∣son;
where some of them who had been known to have great Estates, as
Sir <HI>Paul Pindar</HI> and others, were forced to end their Lives.</P>
<P>THERE were very few Circumstances in the late King's Misfortunes,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>which gave him more Trouble, or so much afflicted him as the Sense He
had of the horrid and unjust Sufferings those poor Gentlemen underwent
for him, and their Affection for his Service; which He often publickly
mentioned, and as often declared, “that He held himself obliged to make
them full Reparation as soon as God should enable him.” And He fre∣quently
spake to the Chancellor, who was then Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer,
of that Affair; of the good Opinion He had of the Men,
and of the great Services They had done for his Majesty; and commanded
him expressly, when it should fall within his Power, He should do them
all the Right He could. And of this He had often informed his Majesty
<MILESTONE N="20"/>during the Time He was abroad, and after his Return, without any other
Motive than his Father's Command and his own Honour, having himself
never had any Degree of Friendship with any of the Persons concerned,
and a very ordinary Acquaintance with some of them. Upon his Majesty's
happy Return, those Gentlemen who were alive of the old Farmers, who
were Sir <HI>John Jacob,</HI> Sir <HI>Job Harby,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> and Sir <HI>John Har∣rison,</HI>
applied themselves to the King, having lain several Years and at that
Time remaining in Execution in several Prisons, and having had their Es∣tates
sold, upon the Prosecution of those Creditors to whom They were
bound for Money lent to his Majesty.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>AS soon as Measures were taken for collecting the Revenue, those four
Gentlemen named before, and two others who had served his Majesty very
well, were appointed his Commissioners for the collecting the Customs and
Duties upon Trade; in which Collection They continued a Year or there∣abouts;
during which Time many of their Creditors, who had generously
forbore to prosecute them whilst They were in Prison and undone, begun
now to commence their Actions against them, presuming They were then
or would shortly be able to satisfy them. Whereupon the King com∣manded
the Lord Treasurer and the Chancellor, with some other Lords,
to send for those Creditors, and to declare to them, “that his Majesty
<MILESTONE N="40"/>would in a short Time enable his Farmers to pay their just Debts, which
He well knew were contracted for his Service; and that He would take
it very well from them, if They would for the present give no Obstruc∣tion
to his Service, by the Prosecution of those Persons at Law, whose
Time was solely taken up in the necessary Service of his Majesty.” Where∣upon
They willingly desisted from that Prosecution; and many of them
finding now, that by his Majesty's Favour They were like to recover their
Debts They before thought to be desperate, They frankly remitted the
Whole or Part of the Interest, that in Strictness of Law was still due
to them.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>HIS Majesty shortly after, finding it best for his Profit to determine the
Collection by Commission, and to let the Whole to Farm, gave Direction
to the Lord Treasurer to confer and treat with any fit Persons who desired
to contract for the same. Many Overtures were made by several Persons,
<PB N="486" REF="492"/>
and some applied themselves directly to his Majesty. Upon which, and after
a competent Time in considering all that had been proposed, the King ap∣pointed
a Day, when He would be attended by the Lord Treasurer and
other of the Lords, and when all the Pretenders should likewise be present,
and He would then and there declare his own Judgment; having first de∣clared
to the Commissioners, whereof four were the old Farmers to whom
so much Money was due, “that whosoever should take the Farm, They
should be obliged to pay them their just Debt at such Times, and by
such Proportions, as his Service could bear. But as to the letting the
Farm itself, He would neither consider the Debt He owed them, nor the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Sufferings They had undergone, but only the Rent They should offer;
which if as much as any Body else would give; He would prefer their
Persons before others; but if any other fit Men would offer more than
They thought fit to give, They should be his Farmers: And therefore
wished them well to consider what They would propose to him.”</P>
<P>AFTER two Days spent by his Majesty with the several Pretenders apart,
and finding that the Propositions made to him by the old Farmers, with
whom the other two were to be joined who had served with them as Com∣missioners,
were at least as much if not more for his Profit than any that
had been made by any of the rest; He did declare, that the Farm should<MILESTONE N="20"/>
be let to those who had been his Commissioners: Which at that Time was un∣derstood
to be so far from being a good Bargain, that the two Commissioners,
who were not concerned in the great Debt, utterly refused to meddle with
the Farm at so great a Rent; the other four publickly declaring at the same
Time, “that They would not give the Rent but in Contemplation of their
Debt, which They thought They should sooner and better receive, when
it should be assigned upon their own Collections, than when it should be
charged upon new Farmers.” But They were Suitors to his Majesty,
“that He would oblige the other two (Sir <HI>John Wolftenholme</HI> and Sir <HI>John
Shaw</HI>) to be joint Farmers with them;” which his Majesty did, by making<MILESTONE N="30"/>
a gracious Promise to them, “that if They should be Losers He would re∣pair
them:” And thereupon Directions were given to Mr. Attorney Ge∣neral
to prepare a Grant accordingly. And, He said, He did not know
that there was one dissenting Voice from what his Majesty inclined to do
upon the whole Matter, the same appearing to every Man to be most just
and reasonable.</P>
<P>THE Farm being thus settled, the old Farmers were directed “to bring
their Accompts to the Lord Treasurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer,
by which it should manifestly appear how much the King was justly and
truly indebted to them, and how the Debts were incurred; that so upon<MILESTONE N="40"/>
a just Computation such Satisfaction might be made to them, as was con∣sistent
with the present State of his Majesty's Affairs and Occasions.”
Many Months, if not a whole Year, were spent in the Examination of those
Accompts before the Auditors: Who, besides the Exceptions They took for
Want of some Formalities in the Proof of some Money paid, which
after twenty Years of License (in which all their Books and Papers had been
taken, their Houses plundered, and their Persons imprisoned; and in which
so many Persons employed by the King to receive and by them to pay Money
were dead) could hardly be made with the usual Exactness; made likewise
several Certificates of particular Cases, which required farther Directions.<MILESTONE N="50"/>
And the Lord Treasurer would never take upon himself to give those Di∣rections,
only declaring to them, as He had frequently done, “that in Re∣gard
his Majesty was not strictly bound in Justice to pay that Debt due
<PB N="487" REF="493"/>
from his Father, but that his present Majesty's generous and Royal Dis∣position
had prevailed with him to pay that just Debt, whereby They might
be preserved from Ruin, in which,” He said, “He had fully concurred
with his Majesty; but that He would never advise him, on the Contrary
He would always dissuade his Majesty from paying or allowing any In∣terest,
though paid by them, which would swell the Debt to such a Pro∣portion,
that his Majesty could never undertake the Payment of it.” Which
Determination, how great soever their Loss appeared to be, seemed to be
so just, at least so necessary for the King, that They wholly referred it to
<MILESTONE N="10"/>his Majesty; hoping that it might prevail with many of their Creditors not
to exact it from them, though the Sale of their whole Estates had made Satis∣faction
to others for the whole Interest, as well as for the Principal.</P>
<P>WHEN the Auditors Certificate was ready, and all the Doubts and
Questions that did arise thereupon were clearly stated, his Majesty vouchsased
again to be present with the other Lords, who had from the Beginning as∣sisted
in the Examination of that Business: And then the Lord Treasurer
declared to his Majesty, what He had before said to the Persons concerned,
“that though He willingly approved his Majesty's Goodness in taking upon
himself that great Debt, yet that He would by no Means give his Advice
<MILESTONE N="20"/>or Consent that He should pay or allow any Interest for it.”</P>
<P>UPON the whole Matter, and upon all the Doubts stated to his Majesty,
and after the Rejection of several of the Sums of Money which were de∣manded
by them, and for the Payment whereof such direct Proof was not
made as is required by the Course of the Exchequer (though, He said,
He thought most Persons who were present were in their private Con∣sciences
well satisfied, that those Sums had been in Truth paid to his Ma∣jesty's
Use, as had been alleged); there appeared to his Majesty to be
justly due to them the Sum of two hundred thousand Pounds; Principal∣Money,
for almost twenty Years, and for which They had paid the Interest
<MILESTONE N="30"/>for many Years out of their own Estates. And his Majesty thought it very
just; and, with many gracious Expressions of his Purpose and Resolution
further to repair them as He should be able, gave Order to the Lord Trea∣surer,
“that the said Debt of two hundred thousand Pounds should be paid
to them in five Years, that is, by forty thousand Pounds for every Year,
out of the Rent of the Farm; and that all Instruments necessary for their
Satisfaction and Security should be presently given to them, whereby They
might be able to comply with their Creditors, and avoid their Impor∣tunity,”
wherewith his Majesty begun to be troubled as much as them∣selves.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>HE did confess himself to have been present at those Agitations, and to
have contributed his humble Advice and Opinion to his Majesty that He
should pay this Debt; which He thought himself obliged to do, as well as
a faithful Counsellor to his present Majesty, as in Discharge of his Duty and
Obligation to his Father. And, He said, He had very good Reason to be∣lieve,
that if that two hundred thousand Pounds be paid according to his
Majesty's Direction, and of which the Heirs and Executors of those Farmers
who are dead, as well as the four present Farmers, have their equal Propor∣tions;
the said Persons have not at this Day Half the Estates They had in
the Year 1640, when They entered into those Engagements for his Majesty.
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Nor was there any one Person present at the Agitation of this Affair, who
seemed in the least Degree to differ in the Opinion, or to dissuade his Ma∣jesty
from giving that Satisfaction for that Debt.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="494"/>
HE said, He did likewise very willingly confess, that He had in the
Manner aforesaid, and being called to advise, given his Opinion for the Pay∣ment
of many other considerable Debts incurred by his late Majesty, and
for which many Persons of Honour, who adhered to him during that War,
were personally bound for him, and whose Estates had been extended and
their Persons imprisoned for the same; many of whom were in Execution
and in Prison for the same when his Majesty returned, and others were then
sued in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> in his Majesty's own Courts. His late Majesty
having granted under his Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> to several Persons intrusted
for the rest, many of his Forests, Parks and other Lands, for their Secu∣rity<MILESTONE N="10"/>
and Indemnity who were or should stand bound for him, for Money
that was then borrowed for and applied to the necessary Support of himself
and his Army, and to no other Purpose; in that Grant He had been par∣ticularly
trusted, as well by the Desire of the Persons particularly concerned,
as by his Majesty's Command to be solicitous for their Satisfaction. And
He did not deny, that He was never more glad, than when He was able
to procure Satisfaction for those Persons who were so bound and so secured;
nor more troubled, than that He could do no more, and that there re∣mained
still so many unsatisfied, and almost undone, for those Debts so
contracted; of which Number He believed there were still too many.<MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>BUT having made those clear Confessions of what was Truth, and what
what He did do in those Transactions, He said, He must as positively deny,
that ever He procured or advised the letting his Majesty's Customs, or any
other Part of his Revenue, at Underrates: On the Contrary, that He used all
the Ways He could to advance the Rents, without Respect of Persons; and
that He was never present at the letting any Farm that any Men would
have given more for, than They did to whom it was let, what Offers soever
were made afterwards, when his Majesty himself had made a Contract, and
when a Grant was issued accordingly under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI> And
He did as positively deny, that ever He received or expected the least Sum<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of Money, or Money-worth, for any Lease made by his Majesty of his Cus∣toms,
or any other Part of his Revenue; or for the Payment of any one
Debt made by his Majesty, to which He was or was not bound: He having
(He said) never had any other Motive for the Performance of those Offices,
but the pure and entire Consideration of his Majesty's Honour, Justice and
Profit, and his own Inclination to gratify worthy Persons, who in Justice
ought to be or might with Justice be gratified and obliged, and who had
commonly been such Persons to whom He had had no Kind of Obligation.</P>
<Q>THE SEVENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seventh Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had received great Sums of Money
from the Company of Vintners, or some of them or their Agents, for<MILESTONE N="40"/>
enhancing the Prices of Wines, and for freeing them from the Payment
of legal Penalties which They had incurred.</HI></Q>
<P>HE said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> if He had been in the least Degree guilty of that Charge, it
would very easily have been proved; and the Vintners would very gladly
have helped them in it, being Persons who never thought themselves beholden
to him, and so not obliged to conceal any of his Corruptions. They well
knew, that He could never be prevailed with to consent to the enhancing the
Prices of their Wines, and that He never had received from them the least
Sum of Money, or other Gratuity from them, in his Life. He said, He
did remember, that at a Time when his Majesty had refused to grant all<MILESTONE N="50"/>
their other Petitions, the Company of Vintners did complain, “that there
were so many Informations against them prosecuted by Informers in the
Exchequer, that They must give over their Trades, and be likewise un∣done,
<PB N="489" REF="495"/>
if They should be severely pursued for what was past:” And there∣fore
They besought his Majesty in Council, “that He would pardon what
“was past; and that for the future They would trespass no more.” Where∣upon
his Majesty thought it worthy of his Mercy to shelter them for the
present from that Prosecution; and thereupon commanded his Attorney Ge∣neral
“to call the Informers before him, and to appoint the Vintners to
pay them such reasonable Rewards for their Pains as He thought fit; and
thereupon He should enter a <HI>Noli Prosequi:</HI>” But his Majesty charged them
for the future not to run into the same Danger.” And as this Grace
<MILESTONE N="10"/>from his Majesty was not upon his Promotion, but purely from his own
Bounty and Goodness, from which Nobody dissuaded him; so He never re∣ceived
the least Profit from the same.</P>
<Q>THE EIGHTH is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eighth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had in a short Time gained to himself
a far greater Estate, than can be imagined to be lawfully gained in
so short a Time; and contrary to his Oath He had procured several
Grants under the Great Seal from his Majesty, to himself and to his
Relations, of several of his Majesty's Lands, Hereditaments and Leases,
to the Disprofit of his Majesty.</HI></Q>
<P>TO this He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that He wished with all his Heart, that the Truth of
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that Article (which He presumed had drawn on all the rest) were clearly
known to all the World: And that They, who in Truth do believe that
He hath so great an Estate, were well informed what it is; and They
would then clearly discern that He needed not be ashamed of having gotten
such an Estate, nor that He needed to have any Recourse to any ill Arts or
Means for the obtaining thereof. They would know, that He had been so
far from <HI>procuring several Grants under the Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>from his
Majesty, to himself and his Relations, of several of his Majesty's Lands, He∣reditaments
and Leases, to the Disprofit of his Majesty;</HI> that He never
moved his Majesty in his Life for any one Grant to himself or any of his
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Relations. If his Majesty's Royal Bounty had disposed him to confer Some∣what
of Benefit and Advantage upon an old Servant, who had waited upon
his Father and himself near thirty Years in some Trust and Employment;
He said, He hoped it should not be imputed as a Crime in him to receive
his Favours. He was far from believing or imagining, that the poor Services
He had ever done, or could do, were in any Degree proportionable to his
Majesty's Bounty: Yet since his Majesty's Goodness had thought him fit for
it, He hoped many others would think so too; at least as fit as some Men,
who had received greater Marks and Proportions of it than He had done,
and who, though They might serve much better, had not served so long.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"/>HE said, He forbore to enlarge upon that Charge, because He conceived
that it was now evident to many, who had been wrought upon by those
who did not believe it themselves, to think his Estate to be very great, that
the Information They received was without Ground: And whoever considers,
that the first Year after the King's Return yielded justly more Profit to the
Great Seal than He ever received in all the Years following, and some par∣ticular
Acts of Bounty conferred on him by his Majesty, without the least
Suit from him, and unthought of by him, will believe that his Fault was
greater in having no better an Estate, than that what He hath hath been
gotten by Corruption. He said, He hath none of his Majesty's Lands, but
<MILESTONE N="50"/>what He had bought, for as much as any Body would pay for it, of those
who had the same granted to them by his Majesty's Bounty, and that Grant
confirmed to them by Act of Parliament. And He presumed that it could
not have fallen from his Majesty's Memory, and was sure was well known
<PB N="490" REF="496"/>
to some Persons of Honour yet alive, that when his Majesty was graciously
pleased, upon his first coming over, to offer him some Land that had never
yielded any Thing to the Crown, He absolutely refused to receive it, because
it was generally thought to be of great Value; and therefore He would not
expose himself to the Envy which naturally attends those Donations,
having in Truth never had an immoderate Appetite <HI>to make Haste to be rich;</HI>
and had as much apprehended the being accused of Witchcraft or Burglary,
as of Bribery and Corruption.</P>
<P>IN a Word: He did declare, that, his Debts being discharged, for which
He paid Interest, all his Estate was not worth, being sold, the Money that<MILESTONE N="10"/>
He had received from his Majesty's own Royal Bounty, and far from being
suitable to the Quality He yet held, and which was never obtained by his
own Ambition, as many Persons of Honour could testify.</P>
<Q>THE NINTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ninth Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had introduced an arbitrary Govern∣ment
in his Majesty's foreign Plantations; and had caused such as com∣plained
thereof before his Majesty and his Council, to be long imprisoned
for so doing.</HI></Q>
<P>TO this He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that though He could not possibly comprehend the full
Meaning of that Article, yet because He had heard of many Discourses made
of the Authority that He assumed to himself over the Plantations, and the<MILESTONE N="20"/>
great Advantage and Benefit that He had drawn to himself from thence,
He was very willing to take that Occasion to relate all that He knew, and
all that He had done, with Reference to any of his Majesty's Plantations;
declaring in the first Place, that at his Majesty's Return, and before, He
had used all the Endeavours He could to prepare and dispose the King to a
great Esteem of his Plantations, and to encourage the Improvement of
them by all the Ways that could reasonably be proposed to him. And He
had been confirmed in that Opinion and Desire, as soon as He had a View
of the Entries in the Customhouse; by which He found what a great Re∣venue
accrued to the King from those Plantations, insomuch as the Receipts<MILESTONE N="30"/>
from thence had upon the Matter repaired the Decrease and Diminution of
the Customs, which the late Troubles had brought upon other Parts of
Trade, from what it had formerly yielded.</P>
<P>THE first Consideration that offered itself before the King that related to
the Plantations, was concerning the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> which having been most
discoursed of since, and, as He had heard, with some Reflections upon him
of Partiality and Injustice, He said, He would in the first Place set down all
He knew in that Affair, and how He came to meddle in it.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Beginning of the late Troubles, the King had granted the
Island of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and his Heirs for ever, upon a<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Supposition that it had been first discovered, possessed and planted at his
Charge: And the said Earl sent a Governour and People thither, and en∣joyed
it to his Death; and by his Will settled it for the Payment of his
Debts, which were very great. The Troubles falling out in a short Time
after, little or no Profit had been drawn from thence towards the Satisfac∣tion
of those Debts; and the Executors and Trustees totally neglected the
taking Care of it, or prosecuting the Plantation. But in and after the War
many Citizens, Merchants and Gentlemen, who were willing or forced to
withdraw themselves from <HI>England,</HI> transported themselves thither, and
planted without asking any Body's Leave, and without being opposed or<MILESTONE N="50"/>
contradicted by any Body.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Year 1647, or thereabouts, the late Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> Son and
Heir of the former Earl, to whom the Inheritance of that Island belonged,
<PB N="491" REF="497"/>
treated with the late Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> how that Island might be
so husbanded, that the Plantation might be advanced, and Profit made by
it; which would at last redound to himself, when the Debt should be paid.
The late King was then in the Hands of the Army: And with his Ma∣jesty's
Approbation and Consent, it was agreed between the said Earl and
the said Lord, “that a Lease should be made by the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> to the
Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> of all the Profits which should arise out of that Planta∣tion,
for the Term of twenty one Years or thereabouts; a Moiety of the
whole Profits to be received by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> himself for his own
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Use, in Recompense for his Pains and Charge. And He was likewise to
receive a Commission from the said Earl, to be Governour of that and the
rest of the <HI>Caribbee</HI> Islands” (all which were comprehended in the Charter
granted by the King to the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI>); “and that a Commission
should be likewise procured from the King or the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by
which the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> was to be constituted Governour of the said
Islands.”</P>
<P>ABOUT that Time the Fleet in the <HI>Downs</HI> returned to their Obedience to
the King, withdrawing themselves to the Coast of <HI>Holland</HI> to offer their Ser∣vice
to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> his Majesty that now is; the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>then likewise coming over to him, to serve him in any Condition his High∣ness
would employ him in. That Summer being passed without any good
Success, the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> then informed the Prince of what had passed
between the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and him with the King his Father's Consent;
which his Highness had likewise received from his Majesty himself, with
much Recommendation of the Lord <HI>Willoughby.</HI> He said, He was then at∣tending
upon the Prince in <HI>Holland,</HI> as one of the King's Council assigned
by his Majesty for that Service. Upon the understanding this whole Case,
the Prince, upon the unanimous Advice of the Council, thought fit to grant
such a Commission of Governour of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and the other Islands, as
<MILESTONE N="30"/>He desired: And He had the more Reason to desire it (notwithstanding
the Earl of <HI>Carlisle's</HI> Grant and Commission), because the principal Planters
upon the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> had been Officers in the King's Army, or of manifest
Affections to him, and always looked upon as of his Party.</P>
<P>WITH this Commission the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> had, at his great Charge
and Expense, transported himself to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and was there received
as Governour; and made a Contract with the Planters, “that so much
should be paid upon the Hundred to the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI>” to whom the
Propriety of the Whole belonged. But before this Agreement could be well
executed, or any Profit drawn from thence, the Island was reduced to the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Obedience of the Parliament and of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and a Governour appointed
by them; the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> being sent into <HI>England,</HI> where He remained
till the King's Return, and had given unquestionable Evidence of his Affec∣tion
to the King's Service, for which He had often been committed to Pri∣son
before and after <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Death.</P>
<P>AS soon as the King returned, the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> (who had then
eight or nine Years to come of his Lease formerly granted to him by the
Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who was then likewise living, and ready to do any other
Act to the Lord <HI>Willoughby's</HI> Advantage) resolved to return himself to the
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and desired the King to renew his Commission to him for the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Government; which his Majesty was very willing to do, as to a Person He
esteemed very much, and who had spent very much of his own Fortune, as
was notoriously known, in that Service. But the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and all those other
Islands were now become of another Consideration and Value, than they
<PB N="492" REF="498"/>
had been of before the Troubles: The <HI>Barbadoes</HI> itself was (by that Conflu∣ence
and Resort thither as was mentioned before) so fully planted, that there
was no Room for new Comers, and They had sent very many of their People
to the other Islands to plant; many Citizens of <HI>London</HI> had raised very great
Estates there, and every Year received a very great Revenue from thence;
and the King's Customs from that one Island came to a very great Sum of
Money yearly.</P>
<P>ALL these Men, who had entered upon that Plantation as a waste Place,
and had with great Charge brought it to that Perfection, and with great
Trouble, begun now to apprehend, that They must depend upon the Good-Will<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> for the Enjoyment of their
Estates there, which They had hitherto looked upon as their own. All
these Men joined together in an Appeal to the King, and humbly prayed“
his Protection, and that They might not be oppressed by those two Lords.”
They pleaded, “that They were the King's Subjects; that They had re∣paired
thither as to a desolate Place, and had by their Industry obtained a
Livelihood there, when They could not with a good Conscience stay in
<HI>England.</HI> That if They should be now left to those Lords to ransom
themselves and compound for their Estates, They must leave the Country;
and the Plantation would be destroyed, which yielded his Majesty so good<MILESTONE N="20"/>
a Revenue. That They could defend themselves by Law against the Earl
of <HI>Carlisle's</HI> Title, if his Majesty did not countenance it by a new Grant
of the Government to the Lord <HI>Willoughby:</HI> And therefore They were
Suitors to his Majesty, that He would not destroy them by that Counte∣nance.”</P>
<P>AT the same Time, the Creditors of the late Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> (whole Debts
were to be satisfied by the Profits of that Plantation, by the Will and
Settlement of the said Earl) petitioned the King, “that They might be in
the first Place provided for: Their Principal-Money due to them at the
Death of the Earl amounted to no less than fifty thousand Pounds, of<MILESTONE N="30"/>
which They had never yet received one Penny; and therefore that the
Profits which should arise ought in the first Place to be applied to them,
there having been many Families utterly ruined for Want of their Monies
so due to them.” The King appointed to hear all their several Pretences
at the Council-Board, where They all attended with their Council: And after
his Majesty had spent three or four Days himself in hearing the several Allega∣tions,
finding new Pretences and Difficulties every Day to arise (which shall
be mentioned anon), the King appointed several of the Lords of the Council
“to consider of the whole Matter, and to confer with the several Parties, and,
if it were possible, to make an End between them by their own Consent;<MILESTONE N="40"/>
otherwise to report the several Titles to his Majesty, with such Expedients as
in their Judgments They thought most like to produce a general Satisfaction,
without endangering the Plantation,” the Preservation whereof his Majesty
took to Heart. The Chancellor was one of that Committee, and took very
much Pains in reading the Charters, Grants and Leases, and many other Papers
and Dispatches which concerned that Affair; and conferred with several of the
Persons interested; to the End that He might the better discern what could
be done, having never understood or heard any Thing of the Matter, or
that concerned that Plantation, otherwise than what He hath before set down
upon the Dispatch of the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> to <HI>Holland;</HI> nor had He the<MILESTONE N="50"/>
least Inclination or Bias to any Party. Upon the hearing all the Allegations
before the Lords, the several Pretences and Titles appeared to them to be
these; which They afterwards reported to the King.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="499"/>
THE Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> demanded Nothing from the King, but his Com∣mission
to be Governour for the Remainder of the Years which had been
granted to him by the Earl of <HI>Carlisle;</HI> to the End that He might receive one
Moiety of those Profits which should arise to the Earl, and which had been
assigned to him with the Consent and Approbation of the late King, and of
his Majesty that now is; upon which He had undertaken that Voyage, and
spent so much of his Estate.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> whilst this Contention was depending, died, and
by his Will devised his Interest in the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> who
<MILESTONE N="10"/>likewise petitioned the King for the Preservation of his Right: But neither
He, nor the Person under whom He claimed, had any Pretence till all the
Debts should be satisfied; nor did the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul</HI> demand any Thing
till then, but believed the Profit would arise yearly to so much, that the
Debts would quickly be satisfied, and then the Whole was to come to him.</P>
<P>THERE was another Title that preceded the Earl of <HI>Carlisle's,</HI> which was
that of the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who alleged, and proved it to be true,“
that the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and those adjacent Islands were first granted by the King
to his Grandfather the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who was then Lord High
Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> before the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> had any Pretence there∣unto;
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and that the Lord Treasurer had afterwards consented that the same
should be granted to the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> upon a full Contract, <HI>that He
should first receive for ever the Sum of three hundred Pounds by the Year out
of the first Profits of the Plantations;</HI> which Sum of three hundred Pounds
had never been yet paid: And therefore the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> desired,
as Heir to his Grandfather, to have Satisfaction for the Arrears, and that
the growing Rent might be secured to him.”</P>
<P>THE Creditors were of two Kinds: The first, and who had first peti∣tioned
the King, as was said before, had an Assignment made to them by
the Executors and Trustees of the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> upon his Will, and who
<MILESTONE N="30"/>at his Death owed them the full Sum of fifty thousand Pounds or there∣abouts.
The other Creditors consisted of several Tradesmen and Artificers,
to whom the said Earl was indebted for Wares and Goods which They had
delivered for his Use; and of several Servants for their Arrears of Wages:
And all those had, during the late Troubles, exhibited their Bill in Chan∣cery
against the Executors and Overseers of the late Earl, and had obtained
a Decree in that Court for their Satisfaction out of the Profits of those Plan∣tations
(which Decree stood confirmed by the late Act of Judicial Proceed∣ings);
and, as He remembered, their Debts amounted to thirty thousand
Pounds or thereabout. None of the Creditors in general, of one or the other
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Sort, had ever received one Shilling from the Time that the Earl had first
assigned it.</P>
<P>THE Planters insisted positively, “that the Charter granted to the Earl
of <HI>Carlisle</HI> by the King was void in Point of Law:” For which their
Council alleged many Reasons. And having spent much Time upon that
Argumentation, They concluded with two humble Propositions to the King.
(1.)“That his Majesty would give them Leave to prosecute in his Name
in the Exchequer, and at their own Charge, to repeal that Grant to the
Earl of <HI>Carlisle;</HI> by which They should be freed from the arbitrary Power
and Oppression which would be exercised upon them under the Colour of
<MILESTONE N="50"/>that Charter, and his Majesty might receive a great Benefit to himself, by
taking the Sovereignty into his own Hands, to which it belonged. And
in that Case They offered in their own Names, and for the rest of the
Planters who were in the Island, to consent to an Imposition of so much
<PB N="494" REF="500"/>
in the Hundred, which They confidently averred would amount in the
Year to ten thousand Pounds at the least; out of which his Majesty's Go∣vernour
might be well supported, and his Majesty dispose of the Overplus
as He should think fit.” (2.) “If his Majesty would not suffer the Charter
to be repealed, that He would leave those who claimed under the Earl
of <HI>Carlisle's</HI> Patent to their Remedy at Law, and leave the Planters to
their own Defence; which They hoped in Justice could not be denied to
them, since They alone had been at the Charge to settle the Plantation,
which brought every Year so great a Revenue to the Crown, when the
Earl had not been at the least Expense thereupon: And if his Majesty<MILESTONE N="10"/>
should not assist their Pretences with his Royal Authority, They must all
quit the Plantation.”</P>
<P>THESE being the several Pretences of the several Persons, and Nothing
being to be done by Agreement between themselves, their Interests being so
distinct and inconsistent with each other; his Majesty thought fit, in the
first Place, to refer the Consideration of the Validity and Legality of the Pa∣tent
to his Council at Law; who, upon full Deliberation and after the Hearing
of all Parties, returned their Opinion “that their Patent was void, and that
his Majesty might take the same into his own Power.” This Report was
no sooner made to his Majesty, but that He very graciously declared, “that<MILESTONE N="20"/>
He would not receive from hence any Benefit or Advantage to himself,
until all their Pretences had received Satisfaction; and that He would make
no farther Use of avoiding the said Charter, than to dispose the Profits of
the Plantation to those, who in Justice had any Pretence in Law or
Equity to receive the same: And therefore that the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
should proceed in his Voyage to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and should receive ac∣cording
to his Bargain a Moiety of the Profits; and that the other Part
should be disposed of for the Satisfaction of the Debts and other Incum∣brances.”
In Order to which, his Majesty appointed the same Committee
of the Lords to meet again, and to adjust the several Proportions.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>WHEN They met again, They had all the Persons concerned with them,
or ready to be called in upon any Occasion; and They all appeared very
glad that the King had taken the Care and Protection of the Plantation upon
himself, which was all the Security the Planters had or could desire. And
the Lords first Care was, to make some Computation that might be de∣pended
upon, as the yearly Revenue that would arise upon the Imposition
within the Island. But the Planters would not be drawn to any particular
Agreement in that Point, not so much as to consent to what should be im∣posed
upon every Hundred; but on the Contrary declared, “that too much
had been undertaken in that Kind by one of their own Number, Mr.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>Kendall,</HI> in his Discourse before the King in the Council,” and declared“
that the Plantation could not bear the Imposition He had mentioned.
That whatsoever was to be done of that Nature was to be transacted by an
Assembly in the Island: And that all that They could promise for them∣selves
was, that They would use their utmost Endeavours with their Friends
in the Island, that when the Lord <HI>Willougbby</HI> should arrive there and call
an Assembly, They should consent to as great an Imposition as the Planta∣tion
would bear; by which,” They said, “a good Revenue would arise
to the King for the Purposes aforesaid.”</P>
<P>THE Creditors had great Reason to be glad of the Resolution his Majesty<MILESTONE N="50"/>
had taken: For though it would be a long Time before They could be
fully satisfied out of a Moiety of the Profits, though it should arise to the
highest Computation, yet in Time They should receive all, and should every
<PB N="495" REF="501"/>
Year receive some; which would lessen their Debt, and relieve those who
were in the highest Necessities, of which there was a great Number. Whereas
They had hitherto in so many Years received not one Penny: And it was
evident, that without his Majesty's Authority They never should, since the
Planters were resolved never to consent to any Imposition, nor submit to any
Authority that should be exercised under the Earl of <HI>Carlisle's</HI> Patent, with∣out
a due Course of Law; the Way to obtain which would be very diffi∣cult
to find out. And They understood well enough, that, without his
Majesty's Grace and Bounty to them, the Repeal or avoiding the Earl of
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Carlisle's</HI> Patent would put a quick End to all their Pretences.</P>
<P>THE greatest Difficulty that did arise was from the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> to
whom the last Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> had devised these Islands by his Will: And
He had a great Mind to go thither himself, and take Possession of his Right;
and his Council had persuaded him, “that the King's Charter granted to the
first Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> was good and valid in Law, and that They believed
They could defend and maintain it in any Court of Justice.” Then his own
Estate in <HI>Scotland</HI> was so totally lost by the Iniquity of the Time, and his
Father's having so frankly declared himself for the King, when very few of
that Nation lost any Thing for their Loyalty, that He had very little left to
<MILESTONE N="20"/>support himself; and therefore was willing to retire into any Place abroad,
where He might find but a bare Subsistance. But when He considered
again, that He could have no Pretence to any Thing till after the Creditors
were fully satisfied, and how long it was like to be before They could be
satisfied, there remaining still due to the Creditors of Both Kinds no less than
fourscore thousand Pounds, Principal-Money; He did not believe that his in∣sisting
upon the Patent would be worth the Charge and Hazard He must
inevitably be put to: And therefore, upon farther Deliberation with his
Friends, He willingly referred himself and all his Interest to the King's gra∣cious
Determination, as all the rest of the Pretenders and interested Persons
<MILESTONE N="30"/>had done.</P>
<P>THE Case being thus fully stated to the Lords, and every Man's Interest
and Pretence clearly appearing before them, They considered seriously
amongst themselves what They might reasonably propose to the several Per∣sons,
in Order to their Agreement amongst themselves; or, that proving in∣effectual,
what Advice They might reasonably give his Majesty. They were
unanimously of Opinion, “not to advise his Majesty to cause the Patent to be
called in Question: For though They doubted not, upon the Opinion of
his learned Council, that the same would be judged void and illegal; yet
They did not think it a seasonable Time, when the Nation was so active and
<MILESTONE N="40"/>industrious in foreign Plantations, that They should see a Charter or Patent
questioned and avoided, after it hath been so many Years allowed and coun∣tenanced,
and under which it hath so long flourished, and was almost grown
to Perfection. And that since his Majesty had declared, <HI>that, notwithstanding
any Right of his own, all possible Care should be taken for the Satisfaction of
the Creditors, as well as for the Preservation and Support of the Plantation;</HI>
it would be equally equitable and honourable in his Majesty, not to leave the
Earl of <HI>Kinnoul</HI> the only Person unconsidered, and bereaved of all his Pre∣tence.
But that They would humbly move his Majesty, that He would gra∣ciously
vouchsafe to assign some present Maintenance to the said Earl, which
<MILESTONE N="50"/>his unhappy Condition required, out of the Revenue that should be there set∣tled,
and until the Debts should be paid; and that after that Time such an
Augmentation might be made to him, as his Majesty in his Royal Bounty
should think sit: In Consideration whereof, the Earl should procure the
<PB N="496" REF="502"/>
Patent to be brought in and surrendered;” which He promised should be
done accordingly, as soon as the Settlement should be made of that Propor∣tion
which should be assigned to him.</P>
<P>“THAT the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> should enjoy the Benefit of his former Con∣tract
with the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and approved by his Majesty, during the Re∣mainder
of those Years which are not yet expired; that He should make
what Haste He could thither, and call an Assembly, to the End that such
an Imposition might be agreed upon to be paid to his Majesty as should be
reasonable, in Consideration of the great Benefit They had already and
should still enjoy, in being continued and secured in their several Planta∣tions,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
in which as yet They were as it were but Tenants at Will, having
no other Pretence of Right but the Possession: And therefore, that those
Merchants and Planters who had petitioned the King should, according to
their Obligation and Promise made by them to his Majesty, use all their
Credit with those in the Island, that the Imposition might arise to such a
Proportion, that the Revenue might answer the Ends proposed; and that
one Moiety of that Revenue should be enjoyed by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
for his Term.”</P>
<P>“THAT the Annuity of three hundred Pounds by the Year should be paid
to the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> according to the original Contract mentioned<MILESTONE N="20"/>
before; and that the Assignment, that his Majesty would likewise be pleased
to make to the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> should be first paid: And then that the
Remainder of that Moiety should be received to the Use of the Creditors.
And that when the Lord <HI>Willoughby's</HI> Term should be expired, his Majesty
should be desired, after the Reservation of so much as He should think fit
for the Support of his Governour, that all the Remainder might be conti∣nued
towards the Creditors, until their just Debts should be paid.”</P>
<P>THESE Particulars appearing reasonable to the Lords, all Persons con∣cerned
were called, and the same communicated to them, who appeared all
well contented: And thereupon the Lords resolved to present the same to<MILESTONE N="30"/>
his Majesty, which They did accordingly at the Board; and his Majesty
with a full Approbation and Advice of the whole Council ratified the same.
Whereupon that Order was made by the King in Council, which compre∣hends
all the Particulars mentioned before; which was delivered to the Lord
<HI>Willoughby,</HI> with his Majesty's express Command, “that He should fee it
punctually and precisely executed;” and the like Order was delivered by
the Clerk of the Council to every other Person mentioned, who desired the
same: To which Order He did for the more Certainty refer himself, being
in no Degree confident (having then no other Help than his Memory), that all
was set down with that Exactness as it ought to be. And, He said, as He<MILESTONE N="40"/>
had throughout the whole Affair taken very great Pains to reduce it to that
Agreement, which at that Time seemed to be satisfactory to all the Persons
concerned, so He had not the least Temptation of particular Benefit to
himself; and He did still believe it to be very just, reasonable, and
agreeable to his Majesty's Justice and Goodness, all Circumstances being
considered. And though it may be, in Strictness of Law, and by the
avoiding the Grant made to the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> his Majesty might have
possessed himself of the whole Island, without any tender Consideration of
the Planters or the Creditors; He said, He was not ashamed that He had
never given his Majesty that or the like Counsel, in that or any other Matter<MILESTONE N="50"/>
of the like Nature; and if He had, He was confident his Majesty would
have abhorred it, and not have thought the better of him for giving it.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="503"/>
THE other Part of that Article, <HI>That He had caused such as complained
of the arbitrary Government in the Plantations before the King and Council,
to be long imprisoned for so doing,</HI> did refer, He supposed, to the Commit∣ment
of one <HI>Farmer;</HI> who, being sent over a Prisoner by the Lord <HI>Wil∣loughby</HI>
in a Ship that came from thence, made his Appearance at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
his Majesty being then there in the Sickness-Time, which, He said, was the
first Moment that He had ever heard of the Man or the Matter. And at the
same Time one of the Secretaries of State received a Letter from the Lord
<HI>Willoughby,</HI> which was sent by the same Ship, in which his Lordship had
<MILESTONE N="10"/>sent a direct, full Charge of Mutiny, Sedition and Treason, against the said
<HI>Farmer;</HI> and by his Letter informed the Secretary of all his Behaviour and
Carriage, with all the Circumstances thereof; and “that He had, by his
seditious Practices, prevailed so far upon a disaffected Party in that Island,
that the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> found himself obliged in the Instant to send him
on Board the Ship, without which He did apprehend a general Revolt in
the Island from his Majesty's Obedience:” And He did therefore desire,“
that <HI>Farmer</HI> might not be suffered to return thither before the Island
should be reduced to a better Temper.” The Man was called in before
the King and Council, and the Charge that the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> had sent
<MILESTONE N="20"/>read to him, the greatest Part whereof He could not deny; and in his
Discourse upon it He behaved himself so peremptorily and insolently before
the King, that his Majesty thought it very necessary to commit him; nor did
any one Counsellor then present appear to think otherwise.</P>
<P>AND He did confess, that the discharging him from his Imprisonment was
some Time afterwards moved, and that He was always against his Discharge;
being of Opinion that it would be impossible for the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> or
any other Governour in any of the Plantations, to preserve his Majesty's Right
and to support the Government, if He should be so far discountenanced,
that a Man, being sent over by him as a Prisoner under so particular and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>heinous a Charge, should be upon his Appearance here set at Liberty. But
his Opinion was, “that He should be sent back a Prisoner thither, that He
might be tried by the Law and Justice of the Island, and receive condign
Punishment for his Offence:” And, He said, He could not deny but
that He was still of the same Opinion; and, if it were an Errour, it pro∣ceeded
from the Weakness of his Understanding, which was not in his Power
to reform.</P>
<P>HE said, what He had here set down was all that occurred to his Me∣mory
with Reference to the Island of the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which being not par∣ticularly
mentioned in the Article, but comprehended under the general
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Expression of his Majesty's foreign Plantations, and secretly and maliciously
insinuated in private Discourses, He took himself to be obliged to give some
Answer to what, how generally soever, had been charged. And He hoped
it would not be imputed as a Crime to him, if He had taken more Pains
than other Men in that important Service of his Majesty concerning his foreign
Plantations, which He did not think had been enough taken to Heart: And
if his Desire and Readiness to take any Pains, or give any Assistance to the
Advancement of that Service, had induced many Persons to apply themselves
to him on those Occasions, He hoped it should not be charged upon him
as Over-Activity, or Ambition to engross more Business into his Hands than
<MILESTONE N="50"/>He was entitled to; for which He had this Excuse to make for himself, that
He found the Pains He took to be acceptable to his Majesty. And He was
so far from having any particular Design of Advantage to himself, that He
did profess and declare, that from all or any of his Majesty's Plantations He
<PB N="498" REF="504"/>
never had the least Reward, or least Present made to him; except that
the now Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> once told him, “that his Brother had sent over
some Pieces of the speckled Wood which grows in <HI>Surinam,</HI> with Direc∣tion,
that if He liked it He might have what He would of it;” where∣upon
He had some Pieces of it, which He thought might have been ap∣plied
to the making of Cabinets or the adorning of Wainscot (but as they
were very small, so the Middle of every Piece was wind-shaken and rotten,
that they could not be applied to any considerable Use); and except some
Blocks of Walnut-Tree which the Governour of <HI>Virginia</HI> sent to him, and
of which He made some Table-Boards and Frames for Chairs; the Work∣manship<MILESTONE N="10"/>
whereof cost much more than the Wood was worth. And these
two Particulars contained all the Rewards and Presents or Profit, that ever
He received from all his Majesty's Plantations, or any Body to his Use.</P>
<Q>THE TENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tenth Ar∣ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He did reject and frustrate a Proposal
and Undertaking approved by his Majesty, for the Preservation of</HI> Nevis
<HI>and</HI> St. Christophers, <HI>and reducing the</HI> French <HI>Plantations to his Ma∣jesty's
Obedience, after the Commissions were drawn for that Purpose;
which was the Occasion of such great Losses and Damages in those Parts.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that He never did reject or frustrate any such
Proposal or Undertaking, never taking upon him in the least Degree to<MILESTONE N="20"/>
make a Judgment of Enterprises of that Nature; nor was ever any such
Proposition made to him. But He did very well remember, that his Ma∣jesty
himself did once deliver to the Council a Paper, which He said one
of his Servants (Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI>) had presented to him, containing some Pro∣positions
for Ships and Men to be sent by his Majesty for the Recovery of
<HI>St. Christophers,</HI> which had been newly taken by the <HI>French.</HI> Upon the
reading which Paper and Propositions, the same were referred to the Con∣sideration
of the General, one of the Secretaries of State, and to the Vice∣Chamberlain,
who were to confer with Mr. <HI>Marsh,</HI> and such others as
joined with him. And They were at the same Time appointed to consider<MILESTONE N="30"/>
of another Proposition delivered in Writing by the now Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI>
and some Merchants of <HI>London</HI> who were Planters in the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> for
the supplying and better securing that Island, and the rest of those <HI>Caribbee</HI>
Islands; and for the reducing and recovering any of them which were or
might be taken by the Enemy. Upon the latter of which Somewhat was
afterwards done: And if the other concerning <HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>St. Christophers</HI>
was rejected, of which, He said, He knew Nothing, He presumed it
was, because it either appeared unpracticable, or not consistent with his
Majesty's other Affairs.</P>
<Q>THE ELEVENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eleventh Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He advised and effected the Sale of</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
Dunkirk <HI>to the</HI> French <HI>King, being Part of his Majesty's Dominions,
together with the Ammunition, Artillery, and all Sorts of Stores there;
and for no greater Value than the said Ammunition, Artillery and Stores
were worth.</HI></Q>
<P>THIS whole Transaction of the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> with all the Circum∣stances,
is so fully related in this Discourse, in the Place and at the Time
when this Affair was transacted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, that any Repetition here is to no Pur∣pose:
And whosoever turns back and reads it will clearly see, that He had
no Hand in the Counsel; though He is far from condemning it, or be∣lieving
that it was not necessary, as his Majesty's Affairs at that Time<MILESTONE N="50"/>
stood. To which may be added, that the Treatment He received after
his coming into <HI>France</HI> was an unquestionable Evidence, that that King did
<PB N="499" REF="505"/>
never take himself to be beholden to him for that or any other Service; as
in Truth He never was.</P>
<Q>THE TWELFTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The twelfth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He did unduly cause his Majesty's
Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>to one Dr.</HI> Crowther
<HI>to be altered, and the Enrollment thereof to be unduly razed.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that when He heard of this Charge, He could not
comprehend what the Meaning thereof was, being most assured that He had
never <HI>caused any Alteration to be made in any of his Majesty's Letters Patents
under the Great Seal, or the Enrollment thereof to be razed.</HI> But upon
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Inquiry He was informed, that Dr. <HI>Crowther,</HI> who was Chaplain to his
Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and had attended upon his Person during
the whole Time that his Highness was beyond the Seas, upon his Majesty's
Return into <HI>England,</HI> had obtained from the King his Royal Presentation
to the Parsonage of <HI>Treddington</HI> in the County of <HI>Worcester;</HI> which Pre∣sentation,
according to Course, passed under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI>
That when He brought his Action against the Intruder, who refused to
give him Possession, and the Record was carried down to the Assizes in the
County; when the Doctor's Council were to open his Title, and there∣upon
to produce the King's Presentation, They found upon Perusal thereof,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>that either by Misinformation or Negligence of the Clerk, instead of the
County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> where the Rectory was, the County of <HI>Warwick</HI> was
inserted: Upon which Mistake the Doctor was necessitated to be nonsuited.
And thereupon He forthwith made a Journey to <HI>London</HI> to advise with his
Council, and the most experienced Clerks, how to recover the Misfortune
that had befallen him, and that his Majesty's Right might not be destroyed
by such an Oversight in the Clerk. And it seems He was by them ad∣vised,
as the usual Way in Cases of that Nature, to petition the King,
“that in his Majesty's Presence the Presentation might be mended, and
<HI>Worcester</HI> inserted instead of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and that thereupon the Great
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Seal might be again affixed to it;” all which was done accordingly, as
in such Cases is usual.</P>
<Q>THE THIRTEENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The thirteenth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had in an arbitrary Way ex∣amined
and drawn into Question divers of his Majesty's Subjects con∣cerning
their Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels, and Properties;
determined thereof at the Council-Table, and stopped Proceedings at Law,
and threatened some that pleaded the Statute of</HI> 17 Car.</Q>
<P>TO this He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> He must here again lament his own Misfortunes, that
He was exposed to publick Reproach under a general odious Charge, with∣out
inserting any one Particular to which He might make his Defence. He
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had therefore no more to say, but that He was very innocent as to any
Crime laid to his Charge in that Article: And that He had been so far
from <HI>examining and drawing into Question any of his Majesty's Subjects con∣cerning
their Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels, and Properties, and
determining the same at the Council-Table, and stopping Proceedings at Law;</HI>
that He did not know or believe, that any one Case of that Nature had
been ever determined there, at least when He had been present. That He
had always discountenanced such Addresses, and procured all Petitions of
that Kind to be rejected as often as they have been tendered: And, He
said, He took himself obliged to say, for the Vindication of his Majesty's
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Honour and Justice, that there had not been so many Years passed, since
the Erection of the Council-Table, with so little Disturbance or Disquiet to
the Subjects concerning their Lands, Tenements, Goods and Properties,
<PB N="500" REF="506"/>
as have been since his Majesty's happy Return; nor hath the ordinary
Course of Proceedings at Law been less obstructed.</P>
<Q>THE FOURTEENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourteenth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had caused</HI> Quo Warrantos <HI>to
be issued out against most of the Corporations in</HI> England, <HI>to the Intent
that He might receive great Sums of Money from them for renewing
their Charters; which when They complied withal, He caused the said</HI>
Quo Warrantos <HI>to be discharged, and Prosecution thereon to cease.</HI></Q>
<P>TO this He answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> That He never caused any <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> to
issue out against any one Corporation in <HI>England,</HI> but by his Majesty's ex∣press
Command, or by Order of the Board; which was always upon some<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Miscarriage or Misbehaviour in the Corporation: And that He did not re∣member
that He had ever moved the King against any particular Corpo∣ration
but that of <HI>Woodstock;</HI> and which his Duty to his Majesty had
obliged him to do, being intrusted by his Majesty with the Command of
his House and Park there, and being his Majesty's Steward of his Majesty's
Honour and Manor of <HI>Woodstock,</HI> upon which that Borough had always
depended.</P>
<P>HE said, his Majesty having conferred that Charge upon him, He was
no sooner possessed of it by the Death of the late Earl of <HI>Lindsey,</HI> who en∣joyed
that Place before, than He received a Petition from several Inha∣bitants<MILESTONE N="20"/>
and Burgesses of the Borough of <HI>Woodstock,</HI> who complained,
“that the Mayor and Justices had lately procured their Charter to be re∣newed,
without the Privity or Consent of the Borough; and that under
Pretence of renewing it, They had procured many new Clauses to be in∣serted,
and thereby reduced much of the Government, which before de∣pended
on the whole Corporation, into their own Hands; and had
thereby likewise procured a Piece of Ground, the Benefit whereof did
formerly belong to all the Burgesses, and was usually applied to the Re∣lief
of such of them who were decayed in their Estates, to be now granted
to the Mayor and a select Number of the Justices, and the Profits thereof<MILESTONE N="30"/>
to be at their Disposal, to the great Prejudice of the Borough and the
Inhabitants thereof.” He referred this Petition to Mr. Justice <HI>Morton,</HI>
who lived within four or five Miles thereof, and desired him to examine
the Truth of those Allegations, and to certify him whether the Complaints
were just and reasonable. Whereupon He took the Pains to go to the
Town, and to confer with the Mayor and Justices, and heard the Alle∣gations
of the Petitioners; and upon the whole Matter certified, “that He
found several important Alterations in the new Charter from what had
been in the old, and some new Concessions.”</P>
<P>AND at the same Time Sir <HI>William Fleetwood,</HI> who was Ranger of the<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Parks, certified him, “that since the renewing their Charter, the Mayor
and Justices were not so good Neighbours to his Majesty's Game as They
had formerly been, and had withdrawn many of those Services which
They had used to perform: And that when any Trespasses were com∣mitted
by those of the Borough upon his Majesty's Woods or Game, which
happened very frequently, and Complaint was thereof made to the Mayor
and Justices, who had the sole Jurisdiction within the Borough; there
was so slight and perfunctory Examination thereof, that the Prosecutors
were wearied out, and no Justice could be obtained.”</P>
<P>THAT it was his Duty to inform the King of those Proceedings, who<MILESTONE N="50"/>
was much offended thereat, and thereupon gave his Direction to his At∣torney
General to bring a <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> and to repeal the Charter which
had been so unduly procured, and in which his Majesty had been so grossly
<PB N="501" REF="507"/>
deceived and abused: And He did believe that there was the less Vigour
used in the Prosecution of that <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> because the Mayor and
Justices for some Time had pretended that They would surrender the said
Charter, and receive a new one in such a Manner as his Majesty thought
fit, though They afterwards changed their Mind. And this was the only
Charter, He said, which He gave Direction for the Prosecution of.</P>
<P>NOR did He ever give Order, upon the Receipt of any Money, <HI>to
discharge any</HI> Quo Warranto, <HI>or cause the Prosecution thereupon to cease:</HI>
Nor did He ever receive the least Sum of Money for the granting or re∣newing
<MILESTONE N="10"/>any Charter, other than the usual Fees received for the same by the
Clerk of the <HI>Hanaper,</HI> and accounted to the Seal; which Fee, as He did
remember, did amount to thirteen Shillings and four Pence, or thereabouts.</P>
<Q>THE FIFTEENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifteenth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He procured the Bills of Settle∣ment
for</HI> Ireland, <HI>and received great Sums of Money for the same, in a
most corrupt and unlawful Manner.</HI></Q>
<P>TO this Article there needs no other Answer than what is contained in
two<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 57, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Page 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> several Places of this Discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> in which so full a Relation is made
of the whole Settlement of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with all the Circumstances that ac∣companied
it, that it would be to no Purpose to repeat it in this Place.
<MILESTONE N="20"/>And therein it appears what Money the Chancellor received from <HI>Ireland,</HI>
and how He came to receive any, and by what Injustice He came to re∣ceive
no more; all which was not only well known to the King himself,
but to very many of those, who promoted the Accusation directly contrary
to what They knew to be true.</P>
<Q>THE SIXTEENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixteenth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had deluded and betrayed his Ma∣jesty
and the Nation, in all foreign Treaties and Negotiations relating
to the late War.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> that He did heartily wish that those particular Treaties,
and the Particulars in those Treaties, had been mentioned, wherein it was
<MILESTONE N="30"/>conceived that He had deluded and betrayed his Majesty, that He might at
large have set down whatsoever He had known or done in those Treaties;
and then it would easily have been made appear, how far He had been
from betraying or deluding him. That it was never any Ambition of his
own that brought him to have a Part in any Treaty: He said, God knew,
that He heartily wished to have meddled in Nothing, but the Administra∣tion
of that great Office the King had thought fit to have trusted him with.
But his Majesty had then so good an Opinion of him, that He required and
commanded his Service in many of those Treaties: And therefore it would
be necessary for him, according to the Method He had hitherto used, to
<MILESTONE N="40"/>mention every particular Treaty that had been entered into since the Time
of his Majesty's Return into <HI>England,</HI> and the Part that He had in it; being
as willing to be called to the strictest Account for any other Treaty He had
been engaged in when He had been abroad, or for any Counsel He had ever
given in his Life, publick or private; wherein, He doubted not, He should
be found to have behaved himself (according to the weak Abilities God had
given him) with Fidelity to his Master, and with all imaginable Affection
to his Country, how unhappily soever He had been represented.</P>
<P>THE first Treaty, He said, was with the Crown of <HI>Portugal;</HI> in which
He was none of the Commissioners who treated, and was only present when
<MILESTONE N="50"/>any Report was made by the Commissioners to the King, or to the Council∣Board,
where all the Articles were debated; and He did not remember
that there had been any Difference of Opinion upon any of them: And
<PB N="502" REF="508"/>
that Treaty had been generally held the best that hath been made with any
Crown, the Merchants having thereby greater Advantages in Trade than
They have in any other Place, besides many other great Benefits, with a great
Enlargement of his Majesty's Empire.</P>
<P>THE second Treaty was with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces;</HI> in which
likewise He was none of the Commissioners who treated: But all that was
by them transacted was still brought to the Council-Board, and debated
there in his Majesty's Presence; in which the Rule by which his Majesty
guided himself was, that He would not remit any of those Concessions which
had been formerly made by them in their last Treaty with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
their Unwillingness to consent to that was the Reason that their Ambassa∣dours
proceeded so slowly. And his Majesty had the less Reason to be soli∣citous
for Expedition, because the King of <HI>France</HI> had given his Royal Word,
and proposed it himself, “that the two Crowns might proceed in the several
Treaties with the <HI>Dutch</HI> together, that so They might be brought to those
good Conditions, that They might live like good Neighbours with Both
the Crowns, which,” He observed, “They were not naturally inclined to
do;” and promised positively, “that for his Part He would not conclude
any Thing with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> before He had entirely communicated the
same to his Majesty.” Notwithstanding which Engagement, <HI>France</HI> en∣tered<MILESTONE N="20"/>
into and finished their Treaty; and in it made that secret Article,
which They declared afterwards to be the Ground of their Obligation to
assist the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the ensuing War. However, his Majesty proceeded not
till the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadours consented to all that had been before granted
to <HI>Cromwell:</HI> Which being done, the Peace was made and ratified on Both
Sides; and without Doubt was with more Advantage and Honour to the
<HI>English,</HI> than ever had been provided by any former Treaty between the
Crown of <HI>England</HI> and those <HI>States.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the two Crowns of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> Ambassadours Extraordi∣nary
arrived at <HI>London</HI> shortly after the King's Return, and the several Treaties<MILESTONE N="30"/>
were made with Both those Crowns before the Departure of the Ambassa∣dours:
In neither of which Treaties the Chancellor was a Commissioner,
nor knew any Thing that passed in either, but as it was represented at
the Council-Board, and debated in his Majesty's Presence; nor did He
ever hear that either of them was reckoned a disadvantageous Treaty, Both
of them containing as much Benefit to the <HI>English</HI> as any Treaties which
had been made before with those Crowns. He said, it was very true, that
there were some unusual Expressions of Kindness and Friendship in the
Treaty with <HI>Denmark;</HI> which, in Respect of that King's being at that Time
in a very low Condition, under the disadvantageous Conditions of the Treaty<MILESTONE N="40"/>
at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> newly submitted to, and under almost as ill a Treaty extorted
from that Crown by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and yet being in terrible Apprehension of
some new Oppression from the one and from the other, the Ambassadour
did very earnestly solicit to have inserted; and which were upon great De∣liberation
allowed and inserted by his Majesty's own particular Direction, in
Consideration of the near Alliance in Blood between his Majesty and that King,
and the Civilities and Obligations his Majesty had received from <HI>Denmark,</HI>
during his being in <HI>Holland</HI> after the Murder of his Father, and during his
being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> sent him Horses, Arms and
Ammunition. Of which his Majesty had so great a Sense, that He was<MILESTONE N="50"/>
often heard to say, “that if it had pleased God to have brought him Home
before that disadvantageous Peace at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> had been made” (which
had been done by the Countenance of the <HI>English</HI> Ships, and the Threats
<PB N="503" REF="509"/>
of those who were then Ambassadours from the governing Power in <HI>Eng∣land),</HI>
“He would have done the best He could to have defended and pro∣tected
him:” And therefore He did very readily yield to that Article drawn
by the Ambassadour; his Majesty declaring at the same Time, “that He
was very willing that those Princes who were Neighbours to <HI>Denmark,</HI> and
from whom that Kingdom apprehended new Oppressions, should know
his Majesty's Resolutions to support that King, and to defend him
from new Injuries;” to which the Policy of his Government, as well as
his Friendship, inclined and obliged him; though it is very true, the King
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of <HI>Denmark</HI> did shortly after make very ill Returns to his Majesty for that
his so signal Affection.</P>
<P>THESE were all the Treaties made by the King before the War with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> (for there was very little Progress made either with <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI>
for the Reasons mentioned before), except only a short Treaty with the
Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> which Treaty was, for the most Part, particular
with Reference only to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> his Majesty's Nephew, and for
the better ordering his Affairs. In which Treaty his Majesty likewise employed
five or six of his Council: And the few Articles between his Majesty and
that Elector in Point of State were likewise transacted by them, and debated
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and considered at the Council-Board, and in which all Things were inserted
for his Majesty's Benefit and Service; and if they had not been afterwards
violated by the Elector, the King would have reaped much Fruit and Ad∣vantage
even from that Treaty.</P>
<P>AFTER the War was entered into with <HI>Holland,</HI> his Majesty sent Mr. <HI>Co∣ventry</HI>
to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> to <HI>Denmark,</HI> to dispose those two
Crowns to a Confidence in each other, and then to dispose them Both to
adhere to his Majesty, or at least not to assist or favour the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The
Treaty with <HI>Sweden</HI> succeeded to his Majesty's Wish, and was concluded
in a League defensive, very much to the King's Satisfaction, and with the
<MILESTONE N="30"/>full Approbation of the whole Board; that Crown having manifested so
much Affection, and such an Inclination to an entire Conjunction with him,
that upon very reasonable Conditions They would have been induced to have
entered into a League offensive, and even into the present War against the
<HI>Dutch:</HI> In Order to which, They sent their Ambassadours to the King at
the same Time when Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> returned, and They became the Me∣diators
for the Peace; having first declared to his Majesty, “that if the
Treaty should prove ineffectual, the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> would immediately
join with his Majesty against the <HI>Dutch.</HI>” What became of the other
Treaty with <HI>Denmark</HI> is publickly known, his Majesty having declared to
<MILESTONE N="40"/>all the World how perfidiously He was treated by the <HI>Dane.</HI></P>
<P>THERE remains only one other Treaty to be mentioned, which is the last
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon which the Peace was made: And therefore it will
be necessary to set down the Inducements to that Treaty, the whole Pro∣gress
and Conclusion of it; by all which it will easily appear that his Ma∣jesty
was neither betrayed nor deluded in it, or, if He were, that it was not
done by him.</P>
<P>AFTER so many Encounters and various Successes in the War, which had
been carried on with a much greater Expense than his Majesty at his first En∣trance
into it was persuaded it would cost him; when He saw the Strength
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and Power of the <HI>Dutch</HI> so much increased by the Conjunction of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Denmark,</HI> who supplied them with Money, Ships, and, what They
more wanted, with Men as many as They desired; and that all the Propo∣sitions
He could make to <HI>Spain</HI> could not induce them to enter into such
<PB N="504" REF="510"/>
an Alliance with him, as might embark them against <HI>France,</HI> notwith∣standing
it was evident to all but themselves, that the <HI>French</HI> resolved to
break the Peace with them, having at that Time published those Declara∣tions
which They afterwards made the Ground of the War: His Majesty
clearly discerned, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> grew less weary of the War than They had
before seemed to have been; and that They would be able, with that As∣sistance
and Conjunction, to continue the War with less Inconvenience than
his Majesty was like to do.</P>
<P>He had found it necessary for streightening the Trade of the Enemy (the
depriving them of which could only induce them to desire a Peace, and<MILESTONE N="10"/>
which He could not do by the Strength of his own Ships, which were still
kept together to encounter their Fleet), to grant Commissions upon Letters
of Marque to as many private Men of War as desired the same, and with
such strict Orders and Limitations as are necessary in those Cases; and He
found indeed the Advantage very great, in the Damage those Men of War
did to the Enemy, which was considerable, and gave them great Trouble.
On the other Side, the common Seamen chose much rather to go on Board
those Men of War, where their Profit out of their Shares of the Booty was
greater, and their Hazards much less, than in the King's Ships, where They
got only Blows without Booty, though their Pay and Provisions were much<MILESTONE N="20"/>
greater than they had been in any former Time: So that when the Royal
Fleet was to be set out, there was greater Difficulty in procuring Seamen
and Mariners to man it.</P>
<P>AND then, whereas the Advancement of Trade was made the great End
of the War, it was now found necessary to suppress all Trade, that there
might be Mariners enough to furnish the Ships for the carrying on the War.
And this Inconvenience produced another Mischief: For by the great Dimi∣nution
and even Suppression of Trade, there was likewise so great a Fall in
the Customs, Excise, and all other Branches of the King's Revenue, that
it was evident enough that his Majesty would have little to carry on the War,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
but what should arise by Imposition in Parliament upon the People; who
already complained loudly of the Decay of their Rents, of the small and low
Prices which their Commodities yielded by the Cessation of Trade, and es∣pecially
by the carrying all the Money <HI>in Specie</HI> from the several Counties
to <HI>London,</HI> for the carrying on the War. And the Parliament itself ap∣peared
so weary of it, that instead of granting a new Supply proportionable
to the Charge, They sell upon Expedients to raise Money by the Sale of Part
of the King's Revenue, which was already too small to support the ordinary
and necessary Expense of the Crown.</P>
<P>BUT above all, his Majesty was most discouraged by the extreme License<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of the Seamen in general; but especially of those who were called Privateers,
set out in the particular Ships of War upon Adventure, who made no Dis∣tinction
between Friends and Foes; but, as if the Sea had been their own
Quarters, They seized upon all Ships which passed within their View, and
either pillaged them entirely and so dismissed them (which They usually did
to those which They foresaw would be delivered by the Course of Justice),
or else brought them into the Harbours, after They had taken from them
what They best liked. And then the formal Proceedings in the Court of
Admiralty were so dilatory, and involved in so many Appeals, that the
Prosecution of Justice for Injuries received grew as grievous as the Injury<MILESTONE N="50"/>
itself; which drew an universal Clamour from all Nations, “that without
being Parties to the War They were all treated as Enemies.”</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="511"/>
FRANCE had made the Damage They had this Way received, and the
Interruption of their Trade, a great Part of their Quarrel, and one Ground
of their Conjunction with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> From <HI>Spain,</HI> which really wished
better to us than to our Enemies, the Complaints were as great; “that their
whole Trade was destroyed; their Ships of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which supplied <HI>Spain</HI>
with what They wanted for themselves, and with what was necessary for
their Trade and Intercourse with the <HI>Indies,</HI> were all taken as <HI>Dutch,</HI> be∣cause
it was very hard to distinguish them by their Language:” Which
was likewise the Case of all the <HI>Hanse-Towns,</HI> which made grievous Com∣plaints,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>and had without Doubt received great Damage. Those Princes of
<HI>Italy</HI> whose Dominions reached to the Sea, as the two Republicks of <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
and <HI>Genoa,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> expostulated very grievously for
their Ships taken by those Freebooters of <HI>Scotland</HI> and of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Both
which Nations enriched themselves very much upon such Depredations. And
how much soever the Royal Navy was weakened every Day, the Number of
those Men of War wonderfully increased; so that those Kind of Ships, of
<HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> covered the whole Ocean: And of those
Ships which were taken and carried into <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> (in <HI>England</HI>
there were many Redeliveries), it was observed, that there were <HI>Ves∣tigia
<MILESTONE N="20"/>nulla retrorsum.</HI> Even <HI>Sweden</HI> itself, with whom a new stricter Al∣liance
was entered into at that Time, with as severe Restrictions to that Li∣cense
of the Men of War as could be contrived for the Liberty and Security
of the Trade of that Crown, complained exceedingly of the Violation of all
those Concessions and Provisions, and that their Ships were every Day taken
and plundered. And this universal Complaint began to awaken all Princes
to a Jealousy, that the <HI>English</HI> endeavoured to restrain all Trade, till They
could make themselves the entire Masters of it, and by their naval Power
put some Imposition upon the whole Traffick of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very true, at the first Entrance into the War there had been many
<MILESTONE N="30"/>unskilful Expressions even in the Parliament itself, as well as in the frequent
Discourses of Parliament-Men, “that by this War, and by suppressing the
Power of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at Sea” (of which They made not the least Doubt),“
the King would be able to give the Law to all the Trade of the World,
and that no Ships should pass the Sea without paying some Tribute to <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>”
Which Liberty and Rashness of Discourse made great Impression upon
those who wished Mischief enough to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> till They saw what Danger
might ensue to themselves by the Success of the <HI>English;</HI> and thereupon
wished that They might break themselves upon each other, without Ad∣vantage
to either Party. And this general Distemper and Complaint made
<MILESTONE N="40"/>the deeper Impression upon the King, by his discerning an extreme Diffi∣culty,
if not an Impossibility, to give any just Remedy to it; and conse∣quently,
that He should be shortly looked upon as a common Enemy.</P>
<P>HE had taken very great Pains, upon deliberate Consultations, to sup∣press
that odious Irregularity and destructive License that was practised amongst
the Seamen, and had in many particular Cases himself examined the Excess,
and caused exemplary Justice to be done upon the Offenders, and Restitu∣tion
to be made of what had been taken, at least of what was left; for no
Justice could preserve the injured Persons from being Losers, He had
granted such Rules and Privileges and Protection to the Ports in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>and to others of his Allies, as themselves desired, and looked upon as full
Security; but then He quickly found, that from those very Ports and in
those very Ships which enjoyed those Privileges, the Trade of the <HI>Dutch</HI> was
driven on: So that it was evident that by that Liberty, which other Nations
<PB N="506" REF="512"/>
thought themselves in Justice entitled to, if not restrained, the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
themselves would be easily able to carry on their whole Trade in the Ships
of <HI>Flanders, Hamburgh,</HI> and the other free Towns, or in their own Ships
owned by the other; and that the Restraint would likewise be impossible,
without a total Suppression of those Men of War, and a Revocation of all
Commissions granted to them or any of them, which would likewise be
attended with the Freedom and Security of Trade to all his Majesty's
Enemies.</P>
<P>IN the last Encounter at Sea, the <HI>Prince Royal,</HI> and three other of his
Majesty's Navy, had been lost; and another, the <HI>London,</HI> had been burned<MILESTONE N="10"/>
in the River by the Negligence of the Seamen; for there was never any Dis∣covery
made, that there was any Purpose or Malice in it. The <HI>French</HI> had
obliged themselves, that the Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> should,
with the whole Fleet under his Command, amounting to eighteen good Ships,
join with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was likewise engaged to
send all his great Ships, which were Ten or a Dozen, in Order to the like
Conjunction: So that it was evident to his Majesty, that the Enemy would
be much superiour to him in Strength and Power, though He had been
able to have manned and set out all his Royal Navy; which He well fore∣saw
He should not be able to do, both for Want of Money and Want of<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Seamen, who were already in great Disorder and Mutiny for Want of their
Pay, of which there was indeed a great Arrear due to them. And, which was
worse, there was grown such an Animosity amongst the principal Officers of
the Fleet between themselves, that the whole Discipline was corrupted; so that
it was hard to resolve into what Hands to put the Government thereof, if it
could have been made ready.</P>
<P>UPON which, and the whole State of Affairs, and upon Deliberation and
frequent Consultation with the principal Officers of the Sea, and such others
whose Experience in such Matters rendered them most capable to give Ad∣vice,
the King found it most counsellable to resolve to make a defensive<MILESTONE N="30"/>
War the next Year, and to lay up all his great Ships, and to have some
Squadrons of the lighter Vessels to continue in several Quarters assigned to
them, which should be ready to take all Advantages which should be offer∣ed;
and that there should be likewise ready in the River another good Squa∣dron
of Ships against the End of the Summer, which being ready to join
with those which lay out, when the Enemy was weary and their Ships soul,
would be able to take many notable Advantages upon them; of which They
who advised it were so confident, that They did believe this defensive Way
thus ordered and prosecuted would prove a greater Damage to the Enemy
in their Trade, and all other Respects, than They had ever undergone.<MILESTONE N="40"/>
And in all this Counsel and Resolution the Chancellor had no other Part
than being present; and not understanding the Subject Matter of Debate
could not be able to answer any of the Reasons that had been alleged.</P>
<P>THESE Considerations, upon a full Survey of his ill Condition at Home
and abroad, induced the King to wish that there were a good End of the
War; of which Inclination his Majesty vouchsafed to inform the Chancellor,
well knowing that He would be very glad to contribute all He could to it,
as a Thing He desired most in this World, and which He thought would
prove the greatest Benefit to the King and Kingdom; and his Majesty like∣wise
told him, “that He found all those, who had been most forward and<MILESTONE N="50"/>
impatient to enter into this War, were now weary of it, and would be
glad of a Peace:” So that there remained now Nothing to do, but for
his Majesty to advise with those whom He thought fit (for there seemed many
<PB N="507" REF="513"/>
Reasons to conceal both the Inclination to Peace, and the Resolution not to
set out a Summer Fleet, from being publickly known), what Method to ob∣serve,
and what Expedients to make Use of, for the better procuring this wished
for Peace, without appearing to be too solicitous or importunate for it, or so
weary of the War as in Truth He was. And to this Consultation the King
was pleased to call together with his Royal Brother, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the
Chancellor, the General, the Lord Treasurer, and those other honourable
Persons with whom He used to advise in his most secret and most important
Affairs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>THAT which occurred first to consider was, whether there were any Hope
to divide the <HI>French</HI> from the <HI>Dutch;</HI> upon which Supposition the Prospect
was not unpleasant, the War with one of them being hopefully enough to be
pursued; the Conjunction was only formidable. And to this Purpose se∣veral
Attempts had been made both in <HI>France</HI> and in <HI>Holland;</HI> Both Sides
being equally resolved not to separate from each other, till a joint Peace
should be made with <HI>England,</HI> though They Both owned a Jealousy of each
other: Those of <HI>Holland</HI> having a terrible Apprehension and Foresight of the
King of <HI>France's</HI> Designs upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> which would make his Greatness
too near a Neighbour to their Territories; besides that the Logick of his De∣mands
<MILESTONE N="20"/>upon the Devolution and Nullity of the Treaty upon the Marriage
was equally applicable to their whole Interest, as it was to their Demands
from the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And <HI>France,</HI> upon all the Attacks They had made
both in <HI>France</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambassadour there, and in <HI>Holland</HI> by their
own Ambassadour, found clearly, that They were to expect no Assistance from
the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their Designs, and that at least They wished them ill Success,
and would probably contribute to it upon the first Occasion: And this made
them willing to put an End to their so strict Alliance, which was already
very chargeable to them, and not like to be attended with any notable Ad∣vantage,
except in weakening an Ally from whom They might probably re∣ceive
<MILESTONE N="30"/>much more Advantage.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, neither the one nor the other would be induced to enter into
any Treaty apart, though They Both seemed willing and desirous of a Peace;
in Order to which, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> through the <HI>Swedes</HI> Ambassadours Hands,
had writ to the King, “to offer a Treaty in any such neutral Place as his
Majesty should make Choice of;” professing, “that They should make
no Scruple of sending their Ambassadours directly to his Majesty, but that
their Conjunction with the other two Crowns, who required a neutral
Place, would not admit that Condescension.” And at the same Time
They intimated to the <HI>Swedes</HI> Ambassadours, “that the King of <HI>France</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>would not send his Ambassadours into <HI>Flanders,</HI> or any Place of the King
of <HI>Spain's</HI> Dominions;” and therefore wished, “that his Majesty would
make Choice of <HI>Dusseldorp, Cologne, Francfort,</HI> or <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> or any
other Place that his Majesty should think more convenient than the other,
under that Exception:” All which Places, and in Truth any other out of
the King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Dominions, were at such a Distance (the Winter being
now near over), that there could be no reasonable Expectation of the Fruit
of the Treaty in Time to prevent more Acts of Hostility.</P>
<P>How the Treaty came afterwards to be introduced by Overtures from
<HI>France,</HI> and what Preliminaries were first proposed from thence by the Earl
<MILESTONE N="50"/>of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> and how agreed to by his Majesty; how the Place of the
Treaty came to be adjusted, the Ambassadours chosen, and the whole Pro∣gress
thereupon, and the Publication of the Articles of the Peace; is so par∣ticularly
<PB N="508" REF="514"/>
set forth in this Narrative before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 400, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Page 425, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, that it needs not to be repeated
here. And one of the Ambassadours repairing (as is there said) to the King,
and giving him an Account of all that had passed before any Thing was
concluded, and every Particular having been debated at the Council-Board
and consented to; He said, He could not understand how his Majesty could
be deluded or betrayed in that Treaty, which passed with such a full Exa∣mination
and Disquisition, and in all which Debates his Majesty himself had
taken the Pains to discourse more, and to enlarge in the Answer to all Ob∣jections
which were foreseen, than He had been ever known to have done
upon any other Article.<MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>IT is very true, that the Chancellor had been commanded by the King to
write most of the Letters which had been sent to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> from
the Time of his going over concerning the Treaty, his Lordship having like∣wise
directed most of his Letters to him; and most of the Dispatches to the
Ambassadours were likewise prepared by him, They being by their Instruc∣tions
(without his Desire or Privity) to transmit all Accounts to one of the
Secretaries or to himself. But, He said, it was as true, that He never received
a Letter from either of them, but it was read entirely, in his Majesty's
Presence, to those Lords of the Council who were assigned for that Service,
where Directions were given what Answer should be returned; and He never<MILESTONE N="20"/>
did return any Answer to either of them, without having first read it to the
Council, or having first sent it to one of the Secretaries to be read to his
Majesty. And He did with a very good Conscience protest to all the World,
that He never did the least Thing, or give the least Advice, relating to the
War or relating to the Peace, which He would not have done if He had
been to expire the next Minute, and to have given an Account thereof to
God Almighty.</P>
<P>AND as his Majesty prudently, piously and passionately desired to put an
End to that War, so no Man appeared more delighted with the Peace when
it was concluded, than his Majesty himself did; though (He said) as far as<MILESTONE N="30"/>
He could make any Judgment of publick Affairs, the Publication of that
Peace was attended with the most universal Joy and Acclamation of the
whole Nation, that can be imagined. Nor is it easy to forget the general
Consternation that the City and People of all Conditions were in, when the
<HI>Dutch</HI> came into the River as high as <HI>Chatham;</HI> and when the Distemper
in the Court itself was so great, that many Persons of Quality and Title, in
the Galleries and Privy Lodgings, very indecently every Day vented their
Passions in bitter Execrations against those who had first counselled and
brought on the War, wishing that an End were put to it by any Peace;
some of which Persons, within very few Days after, as bitterly inveighed<MILESTONE N="40"/>
against the Peace itself, and against the Promoters of it. But, He said, He
was yet so far from repenting or being ashamed of the Part He had in it,
that He looked upon it as a great Honour, that the last Service He per∣formed
for his Majesty was the sealing the Proclamations, and other Instruc∣tions
for the Conclusion and Perfection of that Peace, the Great Seal of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
being that very Day sent for and taken from him.</P>
<Q>THE SEVENTEENTH and last Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seven∣teenth Arti∣cle.</NOTE> <HI>That He was a principal
Author of that fatal Counsel of dividing the Fleet about</HI> June 1666.</Q>
<P>FOR Answer to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> He set down at large an Account of all the Agitation
that was in Council upon that Affair, and that the dividing and Separation of<MILESTONE N="50"/>
the Fleet at that Time was by the Election and Advice of the two Generals,
and not by the Order or Direction of the Council: All which hath been
<PB N="509" REF="515"/>
at large, in that Part of this Discourse which relates the Transactions of that
Time<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 342, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> 1 set down, and therefore needs not to be again inserted.</P>
<P>HE took Notice of the Prejudice that might befall him, in the Opinion
of good Men, by his absenting himself, and thereby declining the full Exa∣mination
and Trial which the publick Justice would have allowed him;
which obliged him to set down all the Particulars which passed from the
taking the Seal from him, the Messages He had received by the Bishop of
<HI>Hereford,</HI> and finally the Advice and Command the Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI>
brought him from the Duke of <HI>York</HI> with the Approbation of the King.
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Upon all which, and the great Distemper that appeared in the two Houses
at that Time, and which was pacified upon his withdrawing, He did hope,
that all dispassioned Men would believe that He had not deserted and be∣trayed
his own Innocence; but on the Contrary, that He had complied with
that Obligation and Duty which He had always paid to his Majesty and to
his Service, in choosing at that Time to sacrifice his own Honour to the
least Intimation of his Majesty's Pleasure, and when the least Inconvenience
might have befallen it by his Obstinacy, though in his own Defence: And
concluded, that though his Enemies, who had by all the evil Arts imaginable
contrived his Destruction, had yet the Power and the Credit to infuse into his
<MILESTONE N="20"/>Majesty's Ears Stories of Words spoken and Things done by him, of all
which He was as innocent as He was at the Time of his Birth, and other
Jealousies of a Nature so odious, that themselves had not the Confidence
publickly to own; yet, He said, notwithstanding all those Disadvantages
for the present, He did not despair, but that his Majesty, in his Goodness
and Justice, might in due Time discover the foul Artifices which had been
used to gain Credit with him, and would reflect graciously upon some poor
Services (how over-rewarded soever) heretofore performed by him, the Me∣mory
whereof would prevail with him to think, that the banishing him out
of his Country, and forcing him to seek his Bread in foreign Parts at this
<MILESTONE N="30"/>Age, is a very severe Judgment. However, He was confident that Posterity
will clearly discern his Innocence and Integrity in all those Particulars, which
have been as untruly as maliciously laid to his Charge by Men who did
Nothing before, or have done any Thing since, that will make them be
thought to be wise or honest Men; and will believe his Misfortunes to have
been much greater than his Faults.</P>
<P>AS soon as He had digested and transmitted this his Answer and Vindi∣cation
to his Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor enjoys great Tranquillity of Mind in his Banishment.</NOTE> which He did in a short Time after his Arrival at
<HI>Montpelier,</HI> He appeared to all Men who conversed with him to be entirely
possessed of so much Tranquillity of Mind, and so unconcerned in all that
<MILESTONE N="40"/>had been done to him or said of him, that Men believed the Temper to be
affected with much Art; and that it could not be natural in a Man, who
was known to have so great an Affection for his own Country, the Air and
Climate thereof; and to take so much Delight and Pleasure in his Relations,
from whom He was now banished, and at such a Distance, that He could
not wish that They should undergo the Inconveniences in many Respects
which were like to attend their making him many Visits. But when there
was visibly always in him such a Vivacity and Cheerfulness as could not be
counterfeited, that was not interrupted nor clouded upon such ill News as
came every Week out of <HI>England,</HI> of the Improvement of the Power and
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Insolence of his Enemies; all Men concluded, that He had Somewhat about
him above a good Constitution, and prosecuted him with all the Offices of
Civility and Respect They could manifest towards a Stranger.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="516"/>
THERE were two Inconveniences which He foresaw might happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Appre∣hensions give him some Un∣easiness.</NOTE> and
could not but discompose the Serenity of his Mind. The first, and that
which gave him least Apprehension, though He could not avoid the think∣ing
of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. The Insuf∣ficiency of his Fortune.</NOTE> nor the Trouble of those Thoughts which could not be sepa∣rated
from it, was, how He should be able to draw as much Money out
of <HI>England</HI> as would support his Expense; which, though husbanded with
as much Frugality as could be used with any Decency, He foresaw would
amount to a greater Proportion than He had proposed to himself. His In∣disposition
and Infirmity, which either kept him under the actual and sharp
Visitation of the Gout, or, when the Vigour of that was abated, in much<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Weakness of his Limbs when the Pain was gone, were so great, that He
could not be without the Attendance of four Servants about his own Person;
having, in those Seasons when He enjoyed most Health and underwent least
Pain, his Knees, Legs and Feet so weak, that He could not walk, espe∣cially
up or down Stairs, without the Help of two Men; and when He was
seized upon by the Gout, They were not able to perform the Office of
watching: So that to the <HI>English</HI> Servants which He had brought with him,
which with a Cook, and a Maid to wash his Linen, amounted to six or seven,
He was compelled to take four or five <HI>French</HI> Servants for the Market and
other Offices of the House; and his Lodging cost him above two hundred<MILESTONE N="20"/>
<HI>Pistoles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This soon re∣moved by his Confidence in the Piety of his Children.</NOTE> But all the Apprehensions of this Kind were upon short Reflec∣tions
composed, in the Assurance He had of the Affection and Piety of his
Children, who He believed out of his and their own Estate would raise
enough for his unavoidable Disbursements.</P>
<P>THE other Apprehension stuck closer to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>The Fear of being again persecuted a∣broad.</HI></NOTE> and made him even trem∣ble
in the very Reflection. He could not forget the Treatment He had be∣tween
<HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Roan,</HI> and the strange violent Importunity that was used
to him to get out of the Kingdom, when He had not Strength to get out
of his Bed. And though He was now at Ease from such inhuman Pressures;
yet his Enemies, who had even extorted that Importunity from a People not<MILESTONE N="30"/>
inclined to such Incivilities, had still the same Power, and the same Malice,
and a froppish Kind of Insolence, that delighted to deprive him of any Thing
that pleased him, and manifestly pleased itself in vexing him. And if They
should again prevail with the same Ministers to remove him from his Quiet,
and oblige him to new Journies, the same Spirit would chace him from
Place to Place; there being none in View like to be superiour to their In∣fluence,
when <HI>France</HI> had been subdued by it. So that besides the Impos∣sibility
of preserving the Peace and Repose of his Mind in so grievous a Fa∣tigue,
and continual Torture of his Body, He saw no Hope of Rest but in
his Grave. And against this Kind of Tyranny He could by no reasonable<MILESTONE N="40"/>
Discourse with himself provide any Security, or Stock of Courage to sup∣port
it.</P>
<P>HIS Friend the Abbot <HI>Mountague,</HI> who was the only Advocate He had
to that Court, used all his powerful Rhetorick to allay those Fears, and to
comfort him against those melancholick Apprehensions, by assuring him,
“that the Ministers were far from such Inclinations, and that Nothing but
Reason of State could dispose them to that Severity:” Yet He prepared
him not to think of removing from <HI>Montpelier,</HI> without first acquainting that
Court with it. And when afterwards He proposed to him, “that He might
have Leave to reside in <HI>Orleans</HI> or some other City, at such a nearer Dis∣tance<MILESTONE N="50"/>
from <HI>England,</HI> that his Children or Friends might more easily repair
to him;” the Court did not like the Proposition, but proposed <HI>Molins,</HI>
whither They would not yet give him a Pass, till first their Ambassadour
<PB N="511" REF="517"/>
in <HI>England</HI> should know that it would not be unacceptable to his Majesty:
So that He found himself upon the Matter not only banished from his
Country, but confined to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> without any Assurance that He should
not be again shortly banished from thence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER after He had revolved all the Expedients that occurred to him
for the Prevention of such a Mischief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This removed by an entire Resignation to Providence.</NOTE> He concluded there was no other Re∣medy
to be applied to those Contingencies, than in acquiescing in the good
Pleasure of God, and depending upon him to enable him to bear what no
Discretion or Foresight of his own could prevent. And in this Composure
<MILESTONE N="10"/>of Mind He betook himself to his Books, and to the Entertainment and Ex∣ercise
of such Thoughts, as were most like to divert him from others which
would be more unpleasant.</P>
<P>GOD blessed him very much in this Composure and Retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on his undeserved Treatment.</NOTE> And the
first Consolation He administered to himself was, from the Reflection upon
the wonderful and unusual Proceedings and Prosecution that had been against
him, in another Kind of Manner, and after another Measure, than used to
be practised by the most bitter Enemies, and than was necessary to their Ends
and Advantages who had contrived them: Not to mention the Malice and
Injustice of their first Design of removing him from the Trust and Credit He
<MILESTONE N="20"/>had with the King, and to alienate his Majesty's Affection and Kindness from
him, to which the corrupt Hopes and Expectation of Benefit to themselves
might incline them; and then such unrighteous Ends cannot naturally be
prosecuted but by as unrighteous Means. When They were not only privy
to but Contrivers of his Escape, which They looked upon as attended with
more Benefit to them than his Imprisonment, or the taking his Life, could
have been; when They were secure of his Absence, and of no more being
troubled or contradicted by him, by the Bill of Banishment, by which They
broke their Faith and Promises to the King, and made him depart from his
own Resolutions: To what Purpose was all their other Prosecution of him
<MILESTONE N="30"/>both at Home and abroad, more derogatory to the King's Honour, and that
innate Goodness of Nature and Clemency that all Men know He abounds
in, than mischievous to him? Why must He be absurdly charged with
Counsels and Actions, of which He could never be suspected? And why
must his Name be struck out of all Books of Council, and Catalogues and
Lists of Servants, that it might not appear that He had ever been a Coun∣sellor
of State, or a Magistrate of Justice; a Method that was never prac∣tised
towards the greatest Malefactor? To what worthy or necessary End
could that exorbitant Demand be made and pursued in <HI>France,</HI> to expose
him and the Honour of that Crown to the general Reproach of all Men,
<MILESTONE N="40"/>with such unparallelled Circumstances?</P>
<P>THESE very extraordinary Attempts and unheard of Devices seemed to
all wise Men but the last Effort of vulgar-spirited Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which raise his Confidence in God.</NOTE> and the faint
grasping of impotent Malice; and instead of depressing the Spirits of him
They hated, raised his Confidence, that God would not permit such gross
Inventions of very ill and shortsighted Men to triumph in the Ruin of an
honest Man, whose Heart was always fixed upon his Protection, and whom
He had so often preserved from more powerful Stratagems: And He did
really believe, that the divine Justice would at some Time expose the Pride
and Ambition of those Men to the Infamy They deserved.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<P>TO those Persons with whom He did with the most Freedom commu∣nicate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He reflects on his Conduct from the Time of the King's Return.</NOTE>
He did often profess, that upon the strictest Inquisition He could
make into all his Actions from the Time of the King's Return, when his
Condition was generally thought to have been very prosperous, though at
<PB N="512" REF="518"/>
best it was exercised with many Thorns which made it uneasy, He could
not reflect upon any one Thing He had done (amongst many which He
doubted not were justly liable to the Reproach of Weakness and Vanity), of
which He was so much ashamed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And blames himself chiefly for his Ex∣pense in Build∣ing.</NOTE> as He was of the vast Expence He had
made in the Building of his House; which had more contributed to that
Gust of Envy that had so violently shaken him, than any Misdemeanor that
He was thought to have been guilty of; and which had infinitely discomposed
his whole Affairs, and broken his Estate. For all which He had no other
Excuse to make, than that He was necessitated to quit the Habitation He
was in at <HI>Worcester-House,</HI> which the Owner required, and for which He<MILESTONE N="10"/>
had always paid five hundred Pounds yearly Rent, and could not find any
convenient House to live in except He built one himself (to which He was
naturally too much inclined); and that He had so much Encouragement
thereunto from the King himself, that his Majesty vouchsafed to appoint the
Place upon which it should stand, and graciously to bestow the Inheritance
of the Land upon him after a short Term of Years, which He purchased
from the present Possessor: Which Approbation and Bounty of his Majesty
was his greatest Encouragement. And his own Unskilfulness in Architecture,
and the positive Undertaking of a Gentleman (who had Skill enough, and a
good Reward for his Skill), that the Expense should not amount to a third<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Part of what in Truth it afterwards amounted to, which He could without
eminent Inconvenience have disbursed, involved him in that rash Enterprise,
that proved so fatal and mischievous to him; not only in the Accumulation
of Envy and Prejudice that it brought upon him, but in the Entanglement
of a great Debt, that broke all his Measures; and, under the Weight of his
sudden, unexpected Misfortune, made his Condition very uneasy, and near
insupportable.</P>
<P>AND this He took all Occasions to confess, and to reproach himself with
the Folly of it. And yet, when his Children and his nearest Friends pro∣posed
and advised the Sale of it in his Banishment, for the Payment of his<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Debts, and making some Provision for two younger Children; He remained
still so much infatuated with the Delight He had enjoyed, that, though He
was deprived of it, He hearkened very unwillingly to the Advice; and ex∣pressly
refused to approve it, until such a Sum should be offered for it, as
held some Proportion to the Money He had laid out; and could not con∣ceal
some Confidence He had, that He should live to be restored to it,
and to be vindicated from the Brand He suffered under, except his parti∣cular
compleat Ruin were involved in the general Distraction and Confu∣sion
of his Country, of which He had a more sensible and serious Appre∣hension.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>HE was wont to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His three Ac∣quiescences, or Retreats from publick Busi∣ness.</NOTE> “that of the infinite Blessings which God had vouch∣safed
to confer upon him almost from his Cradle,” amongst which He
delighted in the reckoning up many signal Instances, “He esteemed himself so
happy in none as in his three Acquiescences,” which He called <HI>his three Va∣cations
and Retreats He had in his Life enjoyed from Business of Trouble and
Vexation;</HI> and in every of which God had given him Grace and Oppor∣tunity
to make full Reflections upon his Actions, and his Observations upon
what He had done himself, and what He had seen others do and suffer; to
repair the Breaches in his own Mind, and to fortify himself with new Reso∣lutions
against future Encounters, in an entire Resignation of all his Thoughts<MILESTONE N="50"/>
and Purposes into the Disposal of God Almighty, and in a firm Confidence
of his Protection and Deliverance in all the Difficulties He should be obliged
to contend with; towards the obtaining whereof, He renewed those Vows
<PB N="513" REF="519"/>
and Promises of Integrity and hearty Endeavour to perform his Duty, which
are the only Means to procure the Continuance of that Protection and De∣liverance.</P>
<P>THE first of these Recesses or Acquiescences was, his remaining and re∣siding
in <HI>Jersey,</HI> when the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> his now Majesty, first went into
<HI>France</HI> upon the Command of the Queen his Mother, contrary, as to the
Time, to the Opinion of the Council the King his Father had directed him
to govern himself by, and, as They conceived, contrary to his Majesty's own
Judgment, the knowing whereof They only waited for; and his Stay there,
<MILESTONE N="10"/>during that Time that his Highness first remained at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>St. Germains,</HI>
until his Expedition afterwards to the Fleet and in the <HI>Downs.</HI> His second
was, when He was sent by his Majesty as his Ambassadour, together with
the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> into <HI>Spain;</HI> in which two full Years were spent before
He waited upon the King again. And the third was his last Recess, by the
Disgrace He underwent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Be∣nefits He re∣ceived in them.</NOTE> and by the Act of Banishment. In which three
Acquiescences, He had learned more, knew himself and other Men much
better, and served God and his Country with more Devotion, and He hoped
more effectually, than in all the other more active Part of his Life.</P>
<P>HE used to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A summary Recapitulation of his Life.</NOTE> that He spent too much of his younger Years in Com∣pany
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and Conversation, and too little with Books; which was in some De∣gree
repaired, by the greatest Part of his Conversation being with Persons of
very eminent Parts of Learning and Virtue, and never with Men of loose
and debauched Manners. And He took great Pleasure frequently to re∣member
and mention the Names of those with whom He kept most Com∣pany,
when He first entered into the World; many whereof lived to be
very eminent in Church and State: To whose Information and Example,
and to the Affection, Awe and Reverence He had to their Persons, He did
acknowledge to owe all that was commendable in him. He did very much
affect to be loved and esteemed amongst Men of good Name and Reputa∣tion,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>which made him warily avoid the Company of loose and dissolute
Men, and to preserve himself from any notable Scandal of any Kind, and
to live <HI>cautè,</HI> if not <HI>castè.</HI> Nor was the Conversation He lived in liable
to any other Exception, than that it was with Men superiour to him in their
Quality and their Fortunes, which exposed him to greater Expense than his
Fortune would warrant: And yet it pleased God to preserve him from ever
undergoing any Reproach or Inconvenience.</P>
<P>HE accused himself of entering too soon out of a Life of Ease and Plea∣sure
and too much Idleness, into a Life of too much Business, that required
more Labour and Experience and Knowledge than He was supplied for;
<MILESTONE N="40"/>for He put on his Gown as soon as He was called to the Bar; and, by the
Countenance of Persons in Place and Authority, as soon engaged himself in
the Business of the Profession as He put on his Gown, and to that Degree
in Practice, that gave little Time for Study, that He had too much neg∣lected
before; besides that He still indulged to his beloved Conversation.
Few Years passed before the Troubles in <HI>Scotland</HI> appeared, and <HI>The little
Parliament</HI> was convened; which being dissolved and presently a new one
called, He was a Member in Both, and wholly gave himself up to the pub∣lick
Affairs agitated there, and where He was enough esteemed and employed,
till the Spirit reigned there, and drove Men of his Principles from thence.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50"/>HE was entirely and without Reserve trusted, with two other of his
Friends, in all the King's Affairs which related to the Parliament, before the
Rebellion appeared; which brought him into Prejudice and Jealousy with
many of Both Houses, who before were very kind to him. And in the Be∣ginning
<PB N="514" REF="520"/>
of the Rebellion He was sworn of the Privy Council and made
Chancellor of the Exchequer: And from this Time the Pains He took,
and the great Fatigue He underwent, were notorious to all Men; insomuch
as, the Refreshment of Dinner excepted, for He never supped, He had very
little of the Day, and not much of the Night, vacant from the most im∣portant
Business.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince was separated from his Father, the King commanded
him to attend his Highness into the <HI>West,</HI> under more than a common
Trust: And the Inequality of Humours amongst the Counsellors, the Wants
and Necessities of the Prince his little Court and Family, the Want of<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Wisdom in his Governour, that made him want that Respect from the Prince
and all other People that was due to him, the Faction amongst all the
Country Gentlemen, and above all, the ill Success in the King's Affairs,
and the Prevalence of the Parliament in all Places, made the Province He
had very uncomfortable and uneasy. The unavoidable Necessity of trans∣porting
the Person of the Prince out of the Kingdom (which was intrusted
only to four of the Council by the King, and by his Command reserved
from his Governour and another) when there should be apparent Danger of
his falling into the Hands of the Rebels, and the as necessary deferring it
till that Danger was even in View, and the Designs of some of the Prince his<MILESTONE N="20"/>
Servants with the County to obstruct and prevent it when it was in View;
the executing it in a seasonable Article of Time before or in the Moment that
it was suspected, and disguising it by a Retreat to <HI>Scilly,</HI> and staying there
till They could be provided for a farther Voyage; and then the Prince's Re∣move
from thence to <HI>Jersey,</HI> the Contests which happened there between
the Counsellors upon the Queen's Commands for his Highness's present Re∣pair
into <HI>France,</HI> her Majesty's declared Displeasure, and the personal Ani∣mosities
which grew from thence between the Persons in the greatest Trust;
were all Particulars of that Weight and Distraction, that made great Im∣pression
upon his Mind and Faculties, which needed much Reflection and<MILESTONE N="30"/>
Contemplation to compose them.</P>
<P>THIS first Retreat gave him Opportunity and Leisure to call himself to
a strict Account for whatsoever He had done,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His first Re∣treat in the Island of</HI> Jer∣sey.</NOTE> upon revolving of all his
particular Actions, and the Behaviour of other Men; and to compose those
Affections and allay those Passions, which, in the Warmth of perpetual
Actions and chafed by continual Contradictions, had Need of Rest and
cool and deliberate Cogitations. He had now Time to mend his Under∣standing,
and to correct the Defects and Infirmities of his Nature, by the
Observation of and Reflection upon the Grounds and Successes of those
Counsels He had been privy to, upon the several Tempers and Distempers<MILESTONE N="40"/>
of Men employed both in the martial and civil Affairs of the greatest Im∣portance,
and upon the Experience He had and the Observation He had
made in the three or four last Years, where the Part He had acted himself
differed so much from all the former Transactions and Commerce of his
Life.</P>
<P>HE had originally in his Nature so great a Tenderness and Love towards
Mankind, that He did not only detest all calumniating and Detraction to∣wards
the lessening the Credit or Parts or Reputation of any Man, but did
really believe that all Men were such as They seemed or appeared to be;
that They had the same Justice and Candour and Goodness in their Nature,<MILESTONE N="50"/>
that They professed to have; and thought no Men to be wicked and dis∣honest
and corrupt, but those who in their Manners and Lives gave un∣questionable
Evidence of it; and even amongst those He did think most
<PB N="515" REF="521"/>
to err and do amiss, rather out of Weakness and Ignorance, for Want of
Friends and good Counsel, than out of the Malice and Wickedness of their
Natures.</P>
<P>BUT now, upon the Observation and Experience He had in the Parlia∣ment
(and He believed He could have made the Discovery no where else,
without Doubt not so soon), He reformed all those Mistakes, and mended
that Easiness of his Understanding. He had seen those there, upon whose
Ingenuity and Probity He would willingly have deposited all his Concern∣ments
of this World, behave themselves with that signal Uningenuity and
<MILESTONE N="10"/>Improbity that must pull up all Confidence by the Roots; Men of the most
unsuspected Integrity, and of the greatest Eminence for their Piety and De∣votion,
most industrious to impose upon and to cozen Men of weaker Parts
and Understanding, upon the Credit of their Sincerity, to concur with them
in mischievous Opinions, which They did not comprehend, and which
conduced to dishonest Actions They did not intend. He saw the most
bloody and inhuman Rebellion contrived by them who were generally
believed to be the most solicitous and zealous for the Peace and Prosperity
of the Kingdom, with such Art and Subtilty, and so great Pretences to
Religion, that it looked like Illnature to believe that such sanctified Per∣sons
<MILESTONE N="20"/>could entertain any but holy Purposes. In a Word, Religion was
made a Cloak to cover the most impious Designs; and Reputation of Ho∣nesty,
a Stratagem to deceive and cheat others who had no Mind to be
wicked. The Court was as full of Murmuring, Ingratitude and Treachery,
and as willing and ready to rebel against the best and most bountiful Master
in the World, as the Country and the City. A barbarous and bloody Fierceness
and Savageness had extinguished all Relations, hardened the Hearts and
Bowels of all Men; and an universal Malice and Animosity had even covered
the most innocent and best-natured People and Nation upon the Earth.</P>
<P>THESE unavoidable Reflections first made him discern, how weak and
<MILESTONE N="30"/>foolish all his former Imaginations had been, and how blind a Surveyor He
had been of the Inclinations and Affections of the Heart of Man; and it made
him likewise conclude from thence, how uncomfortable and vain the Depend∣ance
must be upon any Thing in this World, where whatsoever is good and
desirable <HI>suddenly perisheth,</HI> and Nothing is lasting but <HI>the Folly and Wicked∣ness
of the Inhabitants thereof.</HI> In this first Vacation, He had Leisure to read
many learned and pious Books; and here He began to compose his MEDI∣TATIONS
UPON THE PSALMS, by applying those Devotions to the present
Afflictions and Calamities of his King and Country. He began now by
the especial Encouragement of the King, who was then a Prisoner in the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>Army, to write THE HISTORY OF THE LATE REBELLION AND CIVIL WARS,
and finished the four first Books thereof; and made an Entry upon some
Exercises of Devotion, which He lived to enlarge afterwards.</P>
<P>WHEN He had enjoyed, in that pleasant Island of <HI>Jersey,</HI> full two
Years, in as great Serenity of Mind as the Separation from Country, Wife
and Children can be imagined to admit, He received a Command from the
Queen, then at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and an express Order from the King, upon
which the other had been sent, his Majesty being then Prisoner in the Isle
of <HI>Wight,</HI> that He should forthwith attend the Person of the Prince of
<HI>Wales,</HI> who, upon the Revolt of the Ships under the Command of the
<MILESTONE N="50"/>Parliament in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and their Profession of Obedience to the King,
was advised to make all possible Haste to them; and the Chancellor was
required to wait upon his Highness at <HI>Roan</HI> upon a Day assigned, which
was past before the Orders came to him.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="522"/>
AND then without any Delay He used all possible Diligence to find the
Prince; who with greater Expedition, without coming to <HI>Roan,</HI> passed
to <HI>Calais,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Holland</HI> to possess the Ships which He found
there, and possessed with all that Alacrity (which is always very loud) that
Seamen can express; and by the Assistance of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> got
more Victual quickly on Board, that He might be in the <HI>Downs</HI> with the
Fleet to second some Attempt which was already on Foot in <HI>Kent,</HI> and
others expected in several Parts of the Kingdom. And the Chancellor
having in his Way called upon the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> at <HI>Roan,</HI> and together
with him, and some other Persons of Honour and Quality, made what
Haste They could to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> that They might there embark for any Place
where They should hear the Prince to be; there They were informed,
that his Highness was at the <HI>Brill</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> And thereupon They put
themselves on Board a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, and upon the Sea were taken
Prisoners by <HI>Ostenders,</HI> who, upon the Advantage of being in the Ship of
an Enemy, concluded them to be lawful Prize, and treated them accord∣ingly,
with all the Circumstances of Barbarity; and after having plundered
them thoroughly of Money and Jewels of great Value, and stripped most
of their Servants to their Shirts, They carried them in great Triumph to
<HI>Ostend;</HI> where though their Persons were used with Civility and Respect,
and presently set at Liberty, yet They were compelled to stay there many
Days, in Hope to obtain the Jewels and Money of which They had been
robbed, and, finding that not to be done (those Privateers being subject to
no Discipline, nor regarding the Orders of the Admiralty, or any other Go∣vernour),
to make such Provision as was necessary for a further Voyage.
And at last They got from <HI>Ostend</HI> to <HI>Flushing,</HI> having found Means to in∣form
the Prince of their Misadventures, and of their Readiness at <HI>Flushing</HI>
to receive and obey his Commands.</P>
<P>THE Fleet was then in the <HI>Downs</HI> in so good a Posture, by the Access
of other Ships and Vessels to it, and by some notable Commotions on Land,
that the Prospect was fair and hopeful. And the Prince received the Ad∣vertisement
no sooner, than He was pleased to send a Frigate to <HI>Flushing</HI>
for those who had been so long expected. But the Winds proved then so
cross and tempestuous in the gentlest Season of the Year, that after several
Attempts at Sea, They were so often driven back again into the Harbour,
sometimes by very dangerous Storms, that in the End They received new
Directions to attend the Prince at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Fleet being at the same
Time under Sail for that Coast.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> was at that Time come to the Fleet as Com∣missioner
from the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to inform the Prince, that Duke
<HI>Hamilton</HI> with a powerful Army was already marched into <HI>England;</HI> and
thereupon to invite his Highness to make what Haste He could, to put
himself in the Head of that Army, according to a Promise the King had
made in some private Treaty with the <HI>Scots;</HI> and which the Queen had
sent very positive Commands to be observed and obeyed. This was the
Reason, not without other more reasonable Motives, so suddenly to quit
the <HI>Downs,</HI> that He might get more Victual for the Fleet, and therewith
sail to the <HI>North,</HI> and disembark in such a Place as should be nearest to the
<HI>Scots</HI> Army, with which He doubted not to find a very considerable Con∣junction
of the <HI>English;</HI> since He knew that Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> had
possessed himself with a Body of <HI>English</HI> Officers and Gentlemen, of <HI>Ber∣wick,</HI>
and Sir <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> had done the same with the like Assist∣ance,
at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI> began their March.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="523"/>
THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and the Chancellor came to the <HI>Hague</HI> the next
Day after the Prince his Arrival, and were very graciously received by his
Highness, and with a wonderful Kindness by all the Court, and all the
Gentlemen who had attended upon him; not so much out of Affection to
them, as out of Detestation of one another, who had kept Company for
the Space of two Months last past.</P>
<P>THE Prince had found the common Seamen full of such a keen Devotion
for his Service upon the true Principles of the Cause, and for the Redemp∣tion
of the King his Father out of Prison, and so full of Indignation against
<MILESTONE N="10"/>those who had formerly misled them into Rebellion, especially the <HI>Presby∣terians;</HI>
that as They had before the Declaration set all those Officers on
Shore by Force, who were appointed by the Parliament to command them,
so now They thought the new ones which They had chosen for themselves,
not fierce and resolute enough for their Purposes. The Truth is; there had
been much unskilful Tampering amongst them by Emissaries from <HI>Paris,</HI>
and other Attempts. And the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> having made his Escape
very little Time before, and being then at the <HI>Hague</HI> when the Fleet came
to <HI>Helvoetsluys,</HI> upon the first Notice lost no Time in making Haste to
them. It was generally known, that the King his Father had long designed
<MILESTONE N="20"/>to make him High Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> and the Commission which had
been formerly granted to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> They all knew to be
repealed and cancelled: So that He no sooner came to the Fleet, but He
was received with the usual Acclamations of Joy as their Admiral, and He
as cheerfully assumed the Command. And his small Family presently be∣gan
to propagate their several Factions and Animosities, with which They
abounded, to make such Parties amongst the Seamen as might advance
their several Pretences. And in this Posture the Prince found the Fleet
when He came to it, and resolved to take the Command immediately into
his own Hand, and that the Duke should remain at the <HI>Hague</HI> with his Sis∣ter,
<MILESTONE N="30"/>till that Expedition were over; and so He made Haste with the Fleet
into the <HI>Downs,</HI> hoping that some present Occasion would be the best Ex∣pedient
to extinguish that Fire, and compose those Distempers, which He
discerned already to be kindled amongst the Seamen.</P>
<P>THE Advice and Instruction which were brought from <HI>Paris</HI> were
grounded upon the Treaty with <HI>Scotland,</HI> the marching of that Army, and
the Expectation of some notable Attempt by the Presbyterian Party in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
in Order to which, all Address was to be made to that City, and a
Declaration to be published to gratify that Party. This Secret was intrusted
only to one of the Council, and one other who was to be ministerial in
<MILESTONE N="40"/>whatsoever the other directed. And this Temper was quickly discovered
when They came into the <HI>Downs,</HI> by the great Care that was taken to give
no Offence or Interruption to the Trade of the City, which all Men be∣lieved
would be the best Means to reduce it. Ships of Return, richly
laden, were suffered quietly to pass thither; others coming from thence,
very well freighted, were likewise quietly permitted to prosecute their
Voyage: All which was passionately opposed by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and all the
rest of the Council. And this Contradiction was quickly known to the
Lords of the Bedchamber, and others, who had no Reverence for that
Council, and were now the more inflamed upon this Division of Opinion.
<MILESTONE N="50"/>And the Seamen likewise coming to take Notice of it cried out, “the Prince
was betrayed;” and grew into such Rage and Fury, that They declared,
“that They would throw those overboard who gave the Prince such evil
Counsel.” Two or three unprosperous Attempts at Land, and then the
<PB N="518" REF="524"/>
Lord <HI>Lautherdale's</HI> coming thither, and the Order thereupon for the Fleet
to sail presently for <HI>Holland</HI> for the Reasons aforesaid, kindled all those
Sparkles into a bright Flame of Dissension, so universal, that there were
very few who spake with any Civility of one another, or without the highest
Animosity that can be imagined.</P>
<P>THIS was the distracted Condition of Affairs when the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and
the Chancellor came to the <HI>Hague;</HI> the Council divided between themselves,
and more offended with the Court for Presumption in making themselves of
the Council, and opposing whatsoever the other directed, by their private
Whispering to the Prince in Reproach of them, and their publick Murmurings
against their Persons for the Counsel They gave, every Man endeavouring to in∣cense
others against those who were not affected by him; and this ill Humour
increased by such an universal Poverty, that very few knew where to find a
Subsistence for three Months to come, or how to dispose of themselves. The
Clamour from the Fleet was so high for new Victual and for Money, that
there was Apprehension just enough, that They would provide for them∣selves
by returning to their old Station; to which They had both Oppor∣tunity
and Invitation, by the Parliament's having set out another Fleet supe∣riour
in Power to them, that were already at Anchor in their View, under
the Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to block them up in that inconvenient
Harbour. The sudden News of the total Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and
shortly after of the Loss of <HI>Colchester,</HI> and taking the Persons of so many
gallant Gentlemen, and murdering some of them in cold Blood; the daily
warm Contests in Council upon the insolent Behaviour and the unreasonable
Demands of the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who as peremptorily insisted upon the
Prince's going immediately with the Fleet into <HI>Scotland,</HI> as He had done
before the total Defeat of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and without expecting to hear
what Alteration that fatal Change had produced in that Kingdom, which
was very reasonable to apprehend, and in Truth had at that Time really fallen
out: These and many other ill Presages made the Chancellor quickly find,
that in his two Years Repose in <HI>Jersey</HI> He had not fortified himself enough
against future Assaults, nor laid in Ballast to be prepared to ride out the
Storms and Tempests that He was like to be engaged in.</P>
<P>THE Preservation of the Fleet was a Consideration that would bear no
Delay; and was in a short Time, though with infinite Difficulties and
Contests full of Animosity, resolved to be by committing the Charge of it
to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was to carry it into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where were many good
Ports in his Majesty's Obedience. But that was no sooner done, but the
horrid Murder of the King, and the formed Dissolution of the Monarchy
there, and erecting and establishing the Government in that Kingdom with
a seeming general Consent, at least without any visible Appearance or Pos∣sibility
of Contradiction or Opposition; the faint Proclamation of the present
King in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under the same Conditions which They would have im∣posed,
and with all the Circumstances with which They had prosecuted the
Rebellion against his Father; the Resolution what was fit for the young King
to undertake in his own Person, and the dismal Prospect, how all the neigh∣bour
Princes were solicitous not to pay him any such Civilities, as might en∣courage
him to expect any Thing from them; were all Arguments of Per∣plexity
and Consternation to all Men, who had been moderately versed in
the Transaction of Affairs; and were too many Things to be looked upon at
once, and yet could not be effectually looked upon but together. So that
the Chancellor used to say, “that all the Business He had been conversant
in, from the Beginning to his coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> had not administered
<PB N="519" REF="525"/>
Half the Difficulties and Disconsolation, had not half so much disturbed
and distracted his Understanding, and broken his Mind, as the next six
Months from that Time had done.” Nor could He see any Light before
him to present a Way to the King, by entering into which He might hope∣fully
avoid the greatest Misery that ever Prince had been exposed to. His
own particular Condition (under so general a Mortification) afflicted him
very little, having long composed himself by a Resolution, with God's Bless∣ing,
to do his Duty without Hesitation, and to leave all the rest to the Dis∣position
of Providence.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>WHEN the Fleet was committed to the Government of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to
embark for <HI>Ireland,</HI> it was enough foreseen by those who foresaw what na∣turally
might fall out, that <HI>Ireland</HI> was probably like to be the Place whither
it might be the most counsellable for the Prince himself to repair. But as
it was not then seasonable in many Respects to publish such an Imagina∣tion;
so it was not possible to keep the Fleet where it then was, or in
any Port of the Dominions of <HI>Holland,</HI> where the <HI>States</HI> were already per∣plexed
what Answer They should return if the new Commonwealth should
demand the Ships, or whether They were not obliged to deliver them: And
therefore no Time was to be lost. Nor was the Voyage itself like to be se∣cure,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>but by the Benefit of the Winter Season, and the unquiet Seas They
were to pass through; which would have made it too dangerous a Voyage
for the Person of the Prince, who must find a shorter Passage thither, when
it should be necessary.</P>
<P>WHEN that inhuman Impiety was acted at <HI>London,</HI> and the young King
had in some Degree recovered his Spirits from the sudden Astonishment, and
had received the vile Proclamation and Propositions from <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Ma∣jesty
with those few who were of nearest Trust concluded, “that it, would
be shortly of Necessity to transport himself into <HI>Ireland;</HI>” which was to be
the highest Secret, that it might be equally unsuspected in <HI>England</HI> and in
<HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>Scotland.</HI> “That He should <HI>incognito,</HI> or with a light Train, pass through
<HI>France</HI> to <HI>Nants,</HI> or some other Port of <HI>Bretagne,</HI> where two or three
Ships of War, which He could not doubt of obtaining by the Favour of
his Brother the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> might attend him; and from thence He
might with least Hazard embark for the nearest Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where
the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> might meet him.”</P>
<P>THIS being concluded in that Manner, the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> went in a
Morning to the King before He was dressed; and desired, “that when He
was ready, He would give him a private Audience in his Closet.” He
there told him, “that his Majesty had taken the most prudent Resolution
<MILESTONE N="40"/>that his Condition would admit, for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where there remained yet
some Foundation for Hope. That for himself He was so old and infirm”
(for to his seventy five Years, which was then his Age, He had frequent and
painful Visitations of the Gout and the Stone), “that his Majesty could not
expect his personal Attendance in so many Journies by Land as He must
be exposed to: Yet having served the Crown throughout the Reign of his
Grandfather and his Father, He was very desirous to finish his Life in his
Majesty's Service.”</P>
<P>“THAT He had reflected upon the woful Condition his Affairs were
in, not more by the Power of his Rebels, than by being abandoned by all
<MILESTONE N="50"/>his neighbour Princes. That it was too apparent, that neither of them
would embark themselves in his Quarrel; so that the utmost He could
hope from them was, that in some secret Manner They might contribute
such a Supply and Relief to him, as might give him a Subsistence, till
<PB N="520" REF="526"/>
some new Accidents and Alterations at Home or abroad might produce a
more seasonable Conjuncture. That even in that Particular, He doubted
the Magnanimity or Generosity of Princes would not be very conspicuous:
However it being all his present Dependance, He must try all the Ways He
could to provoke them to that Disposition.”</P>
<P>“THAT He knew the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> was so low at that Time, that
whatever their Inclinations might be, They could neither supply him with
Ships or Men or Money towards the raising or supporting of an Army:
Yet that He knew too, that there is such a Proportion of Honour, and
of a generous Compassion and Bounty, that is inseparable from that Crown,
and even runs through that People, which other Nations are not inspired
with. And He was confident, that if his Majesty sent an Ambassadour thither,
how necessitous soever that Court might be, it would never refuse to make
such an Assignment of Money to him as might, well husbanded, provide
a decent Support for him in <HI>Ireland;</HI> where likewise the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
had Power to do his Majesty more Offices than any other Prince could
do, or He any where else, by the universal Influence He had upon the
<HI>Irish</HI> Nation. And General <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> who was the only Man that
then obstructed the Union of that People in a Submission to the King, had
been bred up in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had spent all his Time in the
Service of that Crown, and had still his sole Dependance upon it; and
therefore it was to be presumed, that He might be induced by Direction
from <HI>Madrid,</HI> to conform himself to a Conjunction with the Marquis of
<HI>Ormond,</HI> the King's Lieutenant there.” He said, “that his Majesty knew
well that He had spent a great Part of his Life in that Court, in the Ser∣vice
of his Grandfather and Father; and He would be willing to end his
Days there, if it were thought of Use to his Affairs.”</P>
<P>THE Discourse was too reasonable not to make Impression upon the King;
which discovering in his Countenance, the other desired him, “that He
would think that Day upon all that He had said, without communicating
it to any Body, till the next Morning, when He would again wait on
him to know his Opinion upon the Whole; for if his Majesty should ap∣prove
of what He proposed, He had another Particular to offer, before the
Matter should be publickly debated.” When He came the next Morn∣ing,
and found the King was much pleased with what He had before dis∣coursed,
and asked what the other Particular was that He intended to offer;
the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> told him, “that He was very glad his Majesty was so
well pleased with what He had proposed, which He confessed the more
He had revolved himself, the more hopeful the Success appeared to him;
which made him the more solicitous, that through any Inadvertency such
a Design might not miscarry.”</P>
<P>HE put him then in Mind again “of his great Age, how unlike it was
that He should be able to hold out such a Journey, or, if He did, the Fa∣tigue
thereof would probably cast him into a Fit of the Gout or the Stone,
or Both, which if He should outlive, He should be long detained from the
Prosecution of his Business, which the less vigorously pursued would be more
ineffectual;” and therefore proposed, “that He might have a Companion
with him, of more Youth and a stronger Constitution, who would receive
some Benefit by the Information and Advice He should be able to give
him, the Advantage whereof would redound for the present, and might
more in the future, to the King's Service;” and in Fine proposed, “that
the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be joined in the Commission with
him, and accompany him into <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence if They made Haste
<PB N="521" REF="527"/>
in their Journey, They might make such a Progress in that Court, that
He might be able to attend his Majesty in <HI>Ireland</HI> in a very short Time
after his Arrival there; whilst himself remained still at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to prose∣cute
all farther Opportunities to advance his Service.”</P>
<P>THE King was surprised with the Overture; and asked, “whether the
Chancellor would be willing to undertake the Employment, and whether
He had spoken with him of it.” To which the other presently replied,
that He knew not, nor had ever spoke to him of it, nor would do, till
his Majesty, if He liked it, should first prepare him; for He knew well
<MILESTONE N="10"/>He would at first be startled at it, and it may be might take it unkindly.
That He knew well how much of the Weight of his Business lay upon the
Chancellor's Shoulders, and in that Respect that many others would not
be willing He should be absent: Yet that there was a long Vacation in
View, and there could be little to be done till the King should come into
<HI>Ireland;</HI> and by that Time He might be with him again, with such a
Return from <HI>Spain</HI> as might be welcome and convenient to him. And
therefore if his Majesty would first break the Matter to him, He would
then take the Work upon him; and He believed He should give him such
Reasons, since He could not suspect his Friendship” (which was very no∣torious,
<MILESTONE N="20"/>and They lived then together), “as would dispose him to the
Journey.”</P>
<P>WHEN the King spake to him of it, as a Thing that had resulted from
his own Thoughts; “that He had more Hope to obtain some Supply from
<HI>Spain,</HI> than from any other Place; that no Man could be so fit to solicit it
as the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and Nobody so fit to accompany him as He, who
might be with him in <HI>Ireland</HI> in a short Time;” He said, “He had
spoken with Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> to undertake the Employment, to which He
was not averse; but He had expressly refused to undertake it alone, and He
knew that no Companion would be so acceptable to him as He would be.”</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30"/>THE Chancellor did not at first dissemble the Apprehension, that this
Device had been contrived at <HI>Paris,</HI> where He knew that neither of them
were acceptable, nor were wished to be about the King, or to have so much
Credit with him as They were Both thought to have: But the King quickly
expelled that Jealousy. And He desired a short Time to consider of it;
and received such Reasons (besides Kindness in the Invitation) from the Lord
<HI>Cottington,</HI> that He did not submit only to the King's Pleasure, but very
willingly undertook the Employment: And, though it was afterwards de∣layed
by the Importunity of many, and the Queen's own Advice, who
thought the Chancellor's Attendance about the Person of the King her Son
<MILESTONE N="40"/>to be more useful to his Service, than it was like to be in the other Climate,
the King was firm to his Purpose; and dispatched them shortly after his
coming into <HI>France,</HI> when He resolved and prepared for his own Expedi∣tion
into <HI>Ireland,</HI> in Order to which there were then some <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships of
War that waited for him at <HI>St. Maloes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Occasion and Ground of his second Retreat and Recess from
a very uneasy Condition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His second Retreat in</HI> Spain.</NOTE> of which He was not more weary in Respect of the
Difficulty and Melancholy of the Business, from which He could not en∣tirely
disentangle himself by Absence, than in Respect of the Company He
was to keep in the conducting it, who had Humours and Inclinations uneasy
<MILESTONE N="50"/>to him, irresolute in themselves, and contrary for the most Part to his Judg∣ment.
And He did still acknowledge, that He did receive much Refresh∣ment
and Benefit by that Negotiation. For though the Employment proved
ineffectual to the Purposes for which it wás intended, by the King's finding it
<PB N="522" REF="528"/>
necessary to divert his intended Journey for <HI>Ireland,</HI> into that of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
yet He had Vacancy to recollect and compose his broken Thoughts; and
mended his Understanding, in the Observation and Experience of another
Kind of Negotiation than He had formerly been acquainted with, under
the Assistance, Advice and Friendship of the most able Person, and the best
acquainted with foreign Negotiations and the general Interests of the several
Kings and States in <HI>Christendom,</HI> of any Statesman then alive in <HI>Europe,</HI> and
who delighted in giving him all the Information He could. He was con∣versant
in a Court of another Nature and Humour, of another Kind of
Grandeur and Gravity, of another Constitution and Policy; and where Am∣bassadours
are more esteemed and regarded, and live with more Conversation
and a better Intelligence amongst themselves, than in any other Court in the
World.</P>
<P>THE less of Business He had, He was the more vacant to study the Lan∣guage
and the Manners and the Government of that Nation. He made a
Collection of and read many of the best Books which are extant in that Lan∣guage,
especially in the Histories of their Civil and Ecclesiastical State. Upon
the reading the Pontifical History written by <HI>Illescas</HI> in two Volumes, and
continued by one or two others in three other Volumes, He begun there first
his ANIMADVERSIONS UPON THE SUPERIORITY AND SUPREMACY OF THE
POPE, which He afterwards continued to a perfect Work. Here He resumed
the Continuation of his DEVOTIONS ON THE PSALMS, and other Discourses
of Piety and Devotion, which He reviewed and enlarged in his later Times
of Leisure. Though He underwent in this Employment many Mortifica∣tions
of several Kinds, yet He still acknowledged that He learned much
during the Time of his being in <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence He returned a little
before the Battle of <HI>Worcester;</HI> and after the King's miraculous Escape into
<HI>France,</HI> He quickly waited upon his Majesty, and was never separated from
his Person, till sixteen or seventeen Years after by his Banishment.</P>
<P>THIS He called his third and most blessed Recess,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His third Re∣treat after his Banishment.</NOTE> in which God vouch∣safed
to exercise many of his Mercies towards him. And though He entered
into it with many very disconsolate Circumstances; yet in a short Time,
upon the Recovery of a better State of Health, and being remitted into a
Posture of Ease and Quietness, and secure from the Power of his Enemies,
He recovered likewise a marvellous Tranquillity and Serenity of Mind, by
making a strict Review and Recollection into all the Actions, all the Faults
and Follies, committed by himself and others in his last continued Fatigue
of seventeen or eighteen Years; in which He had received very many signal
Instances of God's Favour, and in which He had so behaved himself, that
He had the good Opinion and Friendship of those of the best Fame, Re∣putation
and Interest, and was generally believed to have deserved very well
of the King and Kingdom.</P>
<P>IN all this Retirement He was very seldom vacant, and then only when
He was under some sharp Visitation of the Gout, from reading excellent
Books, or writing some Animadversions and Exercitations of his own, as
appears by the Papers and Notes which He left. He learned the <HI>Italian</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> Languages, in which He read many of the choicest Books. Now
He finished the Work which his Heart was most set upon, THE HISTORY
OF THE LATE CIVIL WARS AND TRANSACTIONS TO THE TIME OF THE
KING'S RETURN IN THE YEAR 1660; of which He gave the King Adver∣tisement.
He finished his REFLECTIONS AND DEVOTIONS UPON THE
PSALMS OF DAVID, which He dedicated to his Children; which was
ended at <HI>Montpelier</HI> before the Death of the Dutchess. He wrote and
<PB N="523" REF="529"/>
finished his ANSWER TO MR. HOBBES HIS LEVIATHAN, to which He prefixed
an Epistle dedicatory to the King, if his Majesty would permit it. He wrote
a good Volume of ESSAYS, DIVINE, MORAL, AND POLITICAL, to which
He was always adding. He prepared A DISCOURSE HISTORICAL OF THE
PRETENCE AND PRACTICE OF THE SUCCESSIVE POPES FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THAT JURISDICTION THEY ASSUME; in which He thought He had fully
vindicated the Power and Authority of Kings from that odious Usurpation.
He entered upon the forming A METHOD FOR THE BETTER DISPOSING THE
HISTORY OF ENGLAND, THAT IT MAY BE MORE PROFITABLY AND EXACTLY
<MILESTONE N="10"/>COMMUNICATED THAN IT HATH YET BEEN. He left so many Papers of se∣veral
Kinds, and cut out so many Pieces of Work, that a Man may con∣clude,
that He never intended to be idle.</P>
<P>IN a Word, He did not only by all possible Administrations subdue his
Affections and Passions, to make his Mind conformable to his present For∣tune;
but did all He could to lay in a Stock of Patience and Provision, that
might support him in any future Exigent or Calamity that might befall him:
Yet with a cheerful Expectation, that God would deliver him from that pow∣erful
Combination which then oppressed him.</P>
