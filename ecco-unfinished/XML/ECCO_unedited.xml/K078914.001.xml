<OPENER>To JOHN TEMPLE, Es{que} at Paris.
<DATELINE>Cowes, <DATE>April 10, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER spending two or three very
agreeable days here, with a party
of friends, in exploring the beauties of
the Island, and dropping a tender tear at
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Carisbrook Castle on the memory of the
unfortunate Charles the First, I am just
setting out for America, on a scheme I
once hinted to you, of settling the lands
to which I have a right as a lieutenant-colonel
on half pay. On enquiry and ma∣ture
deliberation, I prefer Canada to New-York
for two reasons, that it is wilder,
and that the women are handsomer: the
first, perhaps, every body will not ap∣prove;
the latter, I am sure, <HI>you</HI> will.</P>
<P>You may perhaps call my project ro∣mantic,
but my active temper is ill suited
to the lazy character of a reduc'd officer:
besides that I am too proud to narrow my
circle of life, and not quite unfeeling
enough to break in on the little estate
which is scarce sufficient to support my
mother and sister in the manner to which
they have been accustom'd.</P>
<P>What you call a sacrifice, is none at all;
I love England, but am not obstinately
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
chain'd down to any spot of earth; na∣ture
has charms every where for a man
willing to be pleased: at my time of life,
the very change of place is amusing; love
of variety, and the natural restlessness of
man, would give me a relish for this voyage,
even if I did not expect, what I really do,
to become lord of a principality which will
put our large-acred men in England out of
countenance. My subjects indeed at pre∣sent
will be only bears and elks, but in
time I hope to see the <HI>human face divine</HI>
multiplying around me; and, in thus cul∣tivating
what is in the rudest state of na∣ture,
I shall taste one of the greatest of
all pleasures, that of creation, and see
order and beauty gradually rise from
chaos.</P>
<P>The vessel is unmoor'd; the winds are
fair; a gentle breeze agitates the bosom
of the deep; all nature smiles: I go with
all the eager hopes of a warm imagina∣tion;
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
yet friendship casts a lingering look
behind.</P>
<P>Our mutual loss, my dear Temple, will
be great. I shall never cease to regret
you, nor will you find it easy to replace
the friend of your youth. You may find
friends of equal merit; you may esteem
them equally; but few connexions form'd
after five and twenty strike root like that
early sympathy, which united us almost
from infancy, and has increas'd to the very
hour of our separation.</P>
<P>What pleasure is there in the friend∣ships
of the spring of life, before the
world, the mean unfeeling selfish world,
breaks in on the gay mistakes of the just-expanding
heart, which sees nothing but
truth, and has nothing but happiness in
prospect!</P>
<P>I am not surpriz'd the heathens rais'd
altars to friendship: 'twas natural for un∣taught
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
superstition to deify the source of
every good; they worship'd friendship,
which animates the moral world, on the
same principle as they paid adoration to
the sun, which gives life to the world of
nature.</P>
<P>I am summon'd on board. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>June 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment your letter, my
dear; I am happy to hear my mother
has been amus'd at Bath, and not at all
surpriz'd to find she rivals you in your
conquests. By the way, I am not sure she
is not handsomer, notwithstanding you tell
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
me you are handsomer than ever: I am
astonish'd she will lead a tall daughter
about with her thus, to let people into a
secret they would never suspect, that she is
past <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive and twenty.</P>
<P>You are a foolish girl, Lucy: do you
think I have not more pleasure in continu∣ing
to my mother, by coming hither, the
little indulgencies of life, than I could have
had by enjoying them myself? pray re∣concile
her to my absence, and assure her
she will make me happier by jovially en∣joying
the trifle I have assign'd to her use,
than by procuring me the wealth of a
Nabob, in which she was to have no
share.</P>
<P>But to return; you really, Lucy, ask me
such a million of questions, 'tis impossible
to know which to answer first; the coun∣try,
the convents, the balls, the ladies, the
beaux—'tis a history, not a letter, you de∣mand,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
and it will take me a twelvemonth
to satisfy your curiosity.</P>
<P>Where shall I begin? certainly with
what must first strike a soldier: I have seen
then the spot where the amiable hero ex∣pir'd
in the arms of victory; have traced
him step by step with equal astonishment
and admiration: 'tis here alone it is possi∣ble
to form an adequate idea of an enter∣prize,
the difficulties of which must have
destroy'd hope itself had they been fore∣seen.</P>
<P>The country is a very fine one: you see
here not only the <HI>beautiful</HI> which it has in
common with Europe, but the <HI>great sub∣lime</HI>
to an amazing degree; every object
here is magnificent: the very people seem
almost another species, if we compare them
with the French from whom they are de∣scended.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
On approaching the coast of America,
I felt a kind of religious veneration, on
seeing rocks which almost touch'd the
clouds, cover'd with tall groves of pines
that seemed coeval with the world itself:
to which veneration the solemn silence not
a little contributed; from Cape Rosieres,
up the river St. Lawrence, during a course
of more than two hundred miles, there is
not the least appearance of a human foot∣step;
no objects meet the eye but moun∣tains,
woods, and numerous rivers, which
seem to roll their waters in vain.</P>
<P>It is impossible to behold a scene like
this without lamenting the madness of
mankind, who, more merciless than the
fierce inhabitants of the howling wilder∣ness,
destroy millions of their own species
in the wild contention for a little portion of
that earth, the far greater part of which
remains yet unpossest, and courts the hand
of labour for cultivation.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
The river itself is one of the noblest in
the world; it's breadth is ninety miles at
it's entrance, gradually, and almost im∣perceptibly,
decreasing; interspers'd with
islands which give it a variety infinitely
pleasing, and navigable near five hundred
miles from the sea.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more striking than the
view of Quebec as you approach; it stands
on the summit of a boldly-rising hill, at the
confluence of two very beautiful rivers, the
St. Lawrence and St. Charles, and, as the
convents and other public buildings first
meet the eye, appears to great advantage
from the port. The island of Orleans, the
distant view of the cascade of Montmo∣renci,
and the opposite village of Beau∣port,
scattered with a pleasing irregularity
along the banks of the river St. Charles,
add greatly to the charms of the prospect.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
I have just had time to observe, that the
Canadian ladies have the vivacity of the
French, with a superior share of beauty:
as to balls and assemblies, we have none at
present, it being a kind of interregnum
of government: if I chose to give you the
political state of the country, I could fill
volumes with the <HI>pours</HI> and the <HI>contres;</HI>
but I am not one of those sagacious obser∣vers,
who, by staying a week in a place,
think themselves qualified to give, not
only its natural, but it's moral and political
history: besides which, you and I are ra∣ther
too young to be very profound politi∣cians.
We are in expectation of a suc∣cessor
from whom we hope a new golden
age; I shall then have better subjects for
a letter to a lady.</P>
<P>Adieu! my dear girl! say every thing
for me to my mother. Yours,</P>

<OPENER>To Col. RIVERS, at Quebec.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>April 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>INDEED! gone to people the wilds of
America, Ned, and multiply the <HI>hu∣man
face divine?</HI> 'tis a project worthy a
tall handsome colonel of twenty seven:
let me see; five feet, eleven inches, well
made, with fine teeth, speaking eyes, a
military air, and the look of a man of
fashion: spirit, generosity, a good under∣standing,
some knowledge, an easy address,
a compassionate heart, a strong inclination
for the ladies, and in short every quality a
gentleman should have: excellent all these
for colonization: <HI>prenez garde, mes cheres
dames.</HI> You have nothing against you,
Ned, but your modesty; a very useless
virtue on French ground, or indeed on
any ground: I wish you had a little more
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
consciousness of your own merits: remem∣ber
that <HI>to know one's self</HI> the oracle of
Apollo has pronounced to be the perfec∣tion
of human wisdom. Our fair friend Mrs.
II—says, “Colonel Rivers wants nothing
to make him the most agreeable man
breathing but a little dash of the cox-comb.”</P>
<P>For my part, I hate humility in a man of
the world; 'tis worse than even the hypo∣crisy
of the faints: I am not ignorant, and
therefore never deny, that I am a very
handsome fellow; and I have the pleasure
to find all the women of the same opinion.</P>
<P>I am just arriv'd from Paris: the divine
Madame De—is as lovely and as con∣stant
as ever; 'twas cruel to leave her, but
who can account for the caprices of the
heart? mine was the prey of a young un∣experienc'd
English charmer, just come out
of a convent,
<Q>“The bloom of opening flowers—”</Q>
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Ha, Ned? But I forget; you are for the
full-blown rose: 'tis a happiness, as we
are friends, that 'tis impossible we can ever
be rivals; a woman is grown out of my
taste some years before she comes up to
yours: absolutely, Ned, you are too nice;
for my part, I am not so delicate; youth
and beauty are sufficient for me; give me
blooming seventeen, and I cede to you the
whole empire of sentiment.</P>
<P>This, I suppose, will find you trying the
force of your destructive charms on the sa∣vage
dames of America; chasing females
wild as the winds thro' woods as wild as
themselves: I see you pursuing the stately
relict of some renown'd Indian chief, some
plump squaw arriv'd at the age of senti∣ment,
some warlike queen dowager of the
Ottawas or Tuscaroras.</P>
<P>And pray, <HI>comment trouvez vous les
dames sauvages?</HI> all pure and genuine na∣ture,
I suppose; none of the affected coy∣ness
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
of Europe: your attention there will
be the more obliging, as the Indian heroes,
I am told, are not very attentive to the
charms of the <HI>beau sexe.</HI></P>
<P>You are very sentimental on the subject
of friendship; no one has more exalted
notions of this species of affection than
myself, yet I deny that it gives life to the
moral world; a gallant man, like you,
might have found a more animating prin∣ciple:
<Q>O Venus! O Mere de l'Amour!</Q></P>
<P>I am most gloriously indolent this morn∣ing,
and would not write another line if
the empire of the world (observe I do not
mean the female world) depended on it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>TO JOHN TEMPLE, Es{que} Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>July 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS very true, Jack; I have no relish
for <HI>the Misses;</HI> for puling girls in
hanging sleeves, who feel no passion but
vanity, and, without any distinguishing taste,
are dying for the first man who tells them
they are handsome. Take your boarding-school
girls; but give me <HI>a woman;</HI> one,
in short, who has a soul; not a cold inami∣mate
form, insensible to the lively impres∣sions
of real love, and unfeeling as the wax
baby she has just thrown away.</P>
<P>You will allow Prior to be no bad
judge of female merit; and you may re∣member
his Egyptian maid, the favorite of
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
the luxurious King Solomon, is painted in
full bloom.</P>
<P>By the way, Jack, there is generally a
certain hoity-toity inelegance of form and
manner at seventeen, which in my opinion
is not balanc'd by freshness of complexion,
the only advantage girls have to boast of.</P>
<P>I have another objection to girls, which
is, that they will eternally fancy every man
they converse with has designs; a coquet
and a prude <HI>in the bud</HI> are equally disagree∣able;
the former expects universal adora∣tion,
the latter is alarm'd even at that ge∣neral
civility which is the right of all their
sex; of the two however the last is, I think,
much the most troublesome; I wish these
very apprehensive young ladies knew,
their <HI>virtue</HI> is not half so often in danger as
they imagine, and that there are many
male creatures to whom they may safely
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
shew politeness without being drawn into
any concessions inconsistent with the strictest
honor. We are not half such terrible ani∣mals
as mammas, nurses, and novels repre∣sent
us; and, if my opinion is of any
weight, I am inclin'd to believe those tre∣mendous
men, who have designs on the
whole sex, are, and ever were, characters
as fabulous as the giants of romance.</P>
<P>Women after twenty begin to know this,
and therefore converse with us on the foot∣ing
of rational creatures, without either
fearing or expecting to find every man a
lover.</P>
<P>To do the ladies justice however, I have
seen the same absurdity in my own sex,
and have observed many a very good sort
of man turn pale at the politeness of an
agreeable woman.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
I lament this mistake, in both sexes, be∣cause
it takes greatly from the pleasure of
mix'd society, the only society for which I
have any relish.</P>
<P>Don't, however, fancy that, because I
dislike <HI>the Misses,</HI> I have a taste for their
grandmothers; there is a golden mean,
Jack, of which you seem to have no idea.</P>
<P>You are very ill inform'd as to the man∣ners
of the Indian ladies; 'tis in the bud
alone these wild roses are accessible; libe∣ral
to profusion of their charms before mar∣riage,
they are chastity itself after: the
moment they commence wives, they give
up the very idea of pleasing, and turn all
their thoughts to the cares, and those not
the most delicate cares, of domestic life:
laborious, hardy, active, they plough the
ground, they sow, they reap; whilst the
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
haughty husband amuses himself with
hunting, shooting, fishing, and such exer∣cises
only as are the image of war; all
other employments being, according to his
idea, unworthy the dignity of man.</P>
<P>I have told you the labors of savage life,
but I should observe that they are only tem∣porary,
and when urg'd by the sharp tooth
of necessity: their lives are, upon the whole,
idle beyond any thing we can conceive. If
the Epicurean definition of happiness is
just, that it consists in indolence of body,
and tranquillity of mind, the Indians of
both sexes are the happiest people on
earth; free from all care, they enjoy the
present moment, forget the past, and are
without solicitude for the future: in sum∣mer,
stretch'd on the verdant turf, they
sing, they laugh, they play, they relate
stories of their ancient heroes to warm the
youth to war; in winter, wrap'd in the
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
furs which bounteous nature provides them,
they dance, they feast, and despise the ri∣gors
of the season, at which the more effe∣minate
Europeans tremble.</P>
<P>War being however the business of their
lives, and the first passion of their souls,
their very pleasures take their colors from
it: every one must have heard of the war
dance, and their songs are almost all on the
same subject: on the most diligent enquiry,
I find but one love song in their language,
which is short and simple, tho' perhaps not
inexpressive:
<Q><L>“I love you,</L>
<L>I love you dearly,</L>
<L>I love you all day long.”</L></Q>
An old Indian told me, they had also songs
of friendship, but I could never procure a
translation of one of them: on my pressing
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
this Indian to translate one into French for
me, he told me with a haughty air, the
Indians were not us'd to make translations,
and that if I chose to understand their songs
I must learn their language. By the way,
their language is extremely harmonious,
especially as pronounced by their women,
and as well adapted to music as Italian it∣self.
I must not here omit an instance of
their independent spirit, which is, that
they never would submit to have the ser∣vice
of the church, tho' they profess the
Romish religion, in any language but their
own; the women, who have in general
fine voices, sing in the choir with a taste
and manner that would surprize you, and
with a devotion that might edify more po∣lish'd
nations.</P>
<P>The Indian women are tall and well
shaped; have good eyes, and before mar∣riage
are, except their color, and their
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
coarse greasy black hair, very far from
being disagreeable; but the laborious life
they afterwards lead is extremely unfa∣vorable
to beauty; they become coarse and
masculine, and lose in a year or two the
power as well as the desire of pleasing. To
compensate however for the loss of their
charms, they acquire a new empire in mar∣rying;
are consulted in all affairs of state,
chuse a chief on every vacancy of the
throne, are sovereign arbiters of peace
and war, as well as of the fate of those
unhappy captives that have the misfortune
to fall into their hands, who are adopted
as children, or put to the most cruel death,
as the wives of the conquerors smile or
frown.</P>
<P>A Jesuit missionary told me a story on
this subject, which one cannot hear with∣out
horror: an Indian woman with whom
he liv'd on his mission was feeding her chil∣dren,
when her husband brought in an
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
English prisoner; she immediately cut off
his arm, and gave her children the stream∣ing
blood to drink: the Jesuit remonstrated
on the cruelty of the action, on which,
looking sternly at him, “I would have them
warriors,” said she, “and therefore feed
them with the food of men.”</P>
<P>This anecdote may perhaps disgust you
with the Indian ladies, who certainly do not
excel in female softness. I will therefore
turn to the Canadian, who have every
charm except that without which all other
charms are to me insipid, I mean sensibi∣lity:
they are gay, coquet, and sprightly;
more gallant than sensible; more flatter'd
by the vanity of inspiring passion, than ca∣pable
of feeling it themselves; and, like
their European countrywomen, prefer the
outward attentions of unmeaning admira∣tion
to the real devotion of the heart. There
is not perhaps on earth a race of females,
who talk so much, or feel so little, of love
as the French; the very reverse is in gene∣ral
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
true of the English: my fair country∣women
seem ashamed of the charming sen∣timent
to which they are indebted for all
their power.</P>
<P>Adieu! I am going to attend a very
handsome French lady, who allows me the
honor to drive her <HI>en calache</HI> to our Cana∣dian
Hyde Park, the road to St. Foix,
where you will see forty or fifty calashes,
with pretty women in them, parading every
evening: you will allow the apology to be
admissible.</P>

<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>July 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT an inconstant animal is man!
do you know, Lucy, I begin to be
tir'd of the lovely landscape round me? I
have enjoy'd from it all the pleasure meer
inanimate objects can give, and find 'tis a
pleasure that soon satiates, if not relieved
by others which are more lively. The
scenery is to be sure divine, but one grows
weary of meer scenery: the most enchant∣ing
prospect soon loses its power of pleas∣ing,
when the eye is accustom'd to it: we
gaze at first transported on the charms of
nature, and fancy they will please for ever;
but, alas! it will not do; we sigh for so∣ciety,
the conversation of those dear to us;
the more animated pleasures of the heart.
There are sine women, and men of merit
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
here; but, as the affections are not in our
power, I have not yet felt my heart gravi∣tate
towards any of them. I must absolutely
set in earnest about my settlement, in order
to emerge from the state of vegetation into
which I seem falling.</P>
<P>But to your last: you ask me a particu∣lar
account of the convents here. Have
you an inclination, my dear, to turn nun?
if you have, you could not have applied to
a properer person; my extreme modesty
and reserve, and my speaking French, hav∣ing
made me already a great favourite with
the older part of all the three communities,
who unanimously declare colonel Rivers to
be <HI>un tres aimable homme,</HI> and have given me
an unlimited liberty of visiting them when∣ever
I please: they now and then treat <HI>me</HI>
with a sight of some of the young ones,
but this is a favor not allow'd to all the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
There are three religious houses at Que∣bec,
so you have choice; the Ursulines,
the Hotel Dieu, and the General Hospital.
The first is the severest order in the Romish
church, except that very cruel one which
denies its fair votaries the inestimable li∣berty
of speech. The house is large and
handsome, but has an air of gloominess,
with which the black habit, and the livid
paleness of the nuns, extremely corre∣sponds.
The church is, contrary to the style
of the rest of the convent, ornamented and
lively to the last degree. The superior is
an English-woman of good family, who
was taken prisoner by the savages when a
child, and plac'd here by the generosity of
a French officer. She is one of the most
amiable women I ever knew, with a bene∣volence
in her countenance which inspires
all who see her with affection: I am very
sond of her conversation, tho' sixty and a
nun.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
The Hotel Dieu is very pleasantly situ∣ated,
with a view of the two rivers, and
the entrance of the port: the house is
chearful, airy, and agreeable; the habit
extremely becoming, a circumstance a hand∣some
woman ought by no means to over∣look;
'tis white with a black gauze veil,
which would shew your complexion to
great advantage. The order is much less
severe than the Ursulines, and I might add,
much more useful, their province being the
care of the sick: the nuns of this house
are sprightly, and have a look of health
which is wanting at the Ursulines.</P>
<P>The General Hospital, situated about a
mile out of town, on the borders of the
river St. Charles, is much the most agree∣able
of the three. The order and the ha∣bit
are the same with the Hotel Dieu, ex∣cept
that to the habit is added the cross,
gererally worn in Europe by canonesses
only: a distinction procur'd sor them by
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
their founder, St. Vallier, the second bi∣shop
of Quebec. The house is, without,
a very noble building; and neatness, ele∣gance
and propriety reign within. The
nuns, who are all of the noblesse, are
many of them handsome, and all genteel,
lively, and well bred; they have an air of
the world, their conversation is easy, spi∣rited,
and polite: with them you almost
forget the recluse in the woman of condi∣tion.
In short, you have the best nuns at
the Ursulines, the most agreeable women
at the General Hospital: all however have
an air of chagrin, which they in vain en∣deavour
to conceal; and the general eager∣ness
with which they tell you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they
are happy, is a strong proof of the con∣trary.</P>
<P>Tho' the most indulgent of all men to the
follies of others, especially such as have
their source in mistaken devotion; tho'
willing to allow all the world to play the
sool their own way, yet I cannot help
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
being fir'd with a degree of zeal against an
institution equally incompatible with public
good, and private happiness; an institution
which cruelly devotes beauty and innocence
to slavery, regret, and wretchedness; to a
more irksome imprisonment than the se∣verest
laws inflict on the worst of crimi∣nals.</P>
<P>Could any thing but experience, my dear
Lucy, make it be believ'd possible that
there should be rational beings, who think
they are serving the God of mercy by in∣flicting
on themselves voluntary tortures,
and cutting themselves off from that state
of society in which he has plac'd them, and
for which they were form'd? by renounc∣ing
the best affections of the human heart,
the tender names of friend, of wife, of mo∣ther?
and, as far as in them lies, counter∣working
creation? by spurning from them
every amusement however innocent, by
refusing the gifts of that benesicent power
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
who made us to be happy, and destroying
his most precious gifts, health, beauty, sen∣sibility,
chearfulness, and peace!</P>
<P>My indignation is yet awake, from hav∣ing
seen a few days since at the Urfulines,
an extreme lovely young girl, whose coun∣tenance
spoke a soul form'd for the most
lively, yet delicate, ties of love and friend∣ship,
led by a momentary enthusiasm, or
perhaps by a childish vanity artfully ex∣cited,
to the foot of those altars, which she
will probably too soon bathe with the bitter
tears of repentance and remorse.</P>
<P>The ceremony, form'd to strike the ima∣gination,
and seduce the heart of unguarded
youth, is extremely solemn and affecting;
the procession of the nuns, the sweetness
of their voices in the choir, the dignified
devotion with which the charming enthu∣siast
received the veil, and took the cruel
vow which shut her from the world for ever,
struck my heart in spite of my reason, and
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
I felt myself touch'd even to tears by a su∣perstition
I equally pity and despise.</P>
<P>I am not however certain it was the cere∣mony
which affected me thus strongly; it
was impossible not to feel for this amiable
victim; never was there an object more in∣teresting;
her form was elegance itself;
her air and motion animated and graceful;
the glow of pleasure was on her cheek, the
fire of enthusiasm in her eyes, which are
the finest I ever saw: never did I see joy so
livelily painted on the countenance of the
happiest bride; she seem'd to walk in air;
her whole person look'd more than human.</P>
<P>An enemy to every s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecies of superstition,
I must however allow it to be least destruc∣tive
to true virtue in your gentle sex, and
therefore to be indulg'd with least danger:
the superstition of men is gloomy and fe∣rocious;
it lights the fire, and points the
dagger of the assassin; whilst that of wo∣men
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
takes its color from the sex; is soft,
mild, and benevolent; exerts itself in acts
of kindness and charity, and seems only
substituting the love of God to that of man.</P>
<P>Who can help admiring, whilst they
pity, the foundress of the Ursuline con∣vent,
Madame de la Peltric, to whom the
very colony in some measure owes its ex∣istence?
young, rich and lovely; a widow
in the bloom of life, mistress of her own
actions, the world was gay before her, yet
she left all the pleasures that world could
give, to devote her days to the severities of
a religion she thought the only true one:
she dar'd the dangers of the sea, and the
greater dangers of a savage people; she
landed on an unknown shore, submitted to
the extremities of cold and heat, of thirst
and hunger, to perform a service she
thought acceptable to the Deity. To an
action like this, however mistaken the mo∣tive,
bigotry alone will deny praise: the
man of candor will only lament that minds
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
capable of such heroic virtue are not di∣rected
to views more conducive to their own
and the general happiness.</P>
<P>I am unexpectedly call'd this moment,
my dear Lucy, on some business to Mon∣treal,
from whence you shall hear from me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>July 9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM arriv'd, my dear, and have brought
my heart safe thro' such a continued sire
as never poor knight errant was exposed
to; waited on at every stage by blooming
country girls, full of spirit and coquetry,
without any of the village bashfulness of
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
England, and dressed like the shepherdesses
of romance. A man of adventure might
make a pleasant journey to Montreal.</P>
<P>The peasants are ignorant, lazy, dirty,
and stupid beyond all belief; but hospita∣ble,
courteous, civil; and, what is parti∣cularly
agreeable, they leave their wives
and daughters to do the honors of the house:
in which obliging office they acquit them∣selves
with an attention, which, amidst every
inconvenience apparent (tho' I am told not
real) poverty can cause, must please every
guest who has a soul inclin'd to be pleas'd:
for my part, I was charm'd with them, and
eat my homely fare with as much pleasure
as if I had been feasting on ortolans in a pa∣lace.
Their conversation is lively and amus∣ing;
all the little knowledge of Canada is
consined to the sex; very few, even of the
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igneurs, being able to write their own
names.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
The road from Quebec to Montreal is
almost a continued street, the villages being
numerous, and so extended along the banks
of the river St. Lawrence as to leave scarce
a space without houses in view; except
where here or there a river, a wood, or
mountain intervenes, as if to give a more
pleasing variety to the scene. I don't re∣member
ever having had a more agreeable
journey; the fine prospects of the day so
enliven'd by the gay chat of the evening,
that I was really sorry when I approach'd
Montreal.</P>
<P>The island of Montreal, on which the
town stands, is a very lovely spot; highly
cultivated, and tho' less wild and magnifi∣cent,
more smiling than the country round
Quebec: the ladies, who seem to make
pleasure their only business, and most of
whom I have seen this morning driving
about the town in calashes, and making
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
what they call, the <HI>tour de la ville,</HI> at∣tended
by English officers, seem generally
handsome, and have an air of sprightliness
with which I am charm'd; I must be ac∣quainted
with them all, for tho' my stay is
to be short, I see no reason why it should
be dull. I am told they are fond of little
rural balls in the country, and intend to
give one as soon as I have paid my respects
in form.</P>
<P>Six in the evening.</P>
<P>I am just come from dining with the—
regiment, and find I have a visit to pay I was
not aware of, to two English ladies who are
a few miles out of town: one of them is
wife to the major of the regiment, and the
other just going to be married to a captain
in it, Sir George Clayton, a young hand∣some
baronet, just come to his title and a
very fine estate, by the death of a distant
relation: he is at present at New York <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
I am told they are to be married as soon as
he comes back.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
Eight o'clock.</P>
<P>I have been making some flying visits to
the French ladies; tho' I have not seen
many beauties, yet in general the women
are handsome; their manner is easy and
obliging, they make the most of their
charms by their vivacity, and I certainly
cannot be displeas'd with their extreme
partiality for the English officers; their
own men, who indeed are not very attrac∣tive,
have not the least chance for any share
in their good graces.</P>
<P>Thursday morning.</P>
<P>I am just setting out with a friend for
Major Melmoth's, to pay my compliments
to the two ladies: I have no relish for this
visit; I hate misses that are going to be
married; they are always so full of the
dear man, that they have not common civi∣lity
to other people. I am told however
both the ladies are agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
<DATE>14th.</DATE> Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>Agreeable, Lucy! she is an angel: 'tis
happy for me she is engag'd; nothing else
could secure my heart, of which you know
I am very tenacious: only think of finding
beauty, delicacy, sensibility, all that can
charm in woman, hid in a wood in Ca∣nada!</P>
<P>You say I am given to be enthusiastic
in my approbations, but she is really
charming. I am resolv'd not only to have
a friendship for her myself, but that <HI>you</HI>
shall, and have told her so; she comes to
England as soon as she is married; you
are form'd to love each other.</P>
<P>But I must tell you; Major Melmoth
kept us a week at his house in the country,
in one continued round of rural amuse∣ments;
by which I do not mean hunting
and shooting, but such pleasures as the
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
ladies could share; little rustic balls and
parties round the neighbouring country, in
which parties we were joined by all the
fine women at Montreal. Mrs. Melmoth is
a very pleasing, genteel brunette, but Emily
Montague—you will say I am in love with
her if I describe her, and yet I declare to
you I am not: knowing she loves another,
to whom she is soon to be united, I see her
charms with the same kind of pleasure I
do yours; a pleasure, which, tho' ex∣tremely
lively, is by our situation without
the least mixture of desire.</P>
<P>I have said, she is charming; there are
men here who do not think so, but to me
she is loveliness itself. My ideas of beauty
are perhaps a little out of the common
road: I hate a woman of whom every
man coldly says, <HI>she is handsome;</HI> I adore
beauty, but it is not meer features or com∣plexion
to which I give that name; 'tis life,
'tis spirit, 'tis animation, 'tis—in one word,
'tis Emily Montague—without being re∣gularly
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
beautiful, she charms every sensible
heart; all other women, however lovely,
appear marble statues near her: fair; pale
(a paleness which gives the idea of delicacy
without destroying that of health), with
dark hair and eyes, the latter large and
languishing, she seems made to feel to a
trembling excess the passion she cannot fail
of inspiring: her elegant form has an air
of softness and languor, which seizes the
whole soul in a moment: her eyes, the
most intelligent I ever saw, hold you en∣chain'd
by their bewitching sensibility.</P>
<P>There are a thousand unspeakable charms
in her conversation; but what I am most
pleas'd with, is the attentive politeness of
her manner, which you seldom see in a
person in love; the extreme desire of
pleasing one man generally taking off greatly
from the attention due to all the rest. This
is partly owing to her admirable under∣standing,
and partly to the natural soft∣ness
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
of her soul, which gives her the
strongest desire of pleasing. As I am a
philosopher in these matters, and have
made the heart my study, I want extremely
to see her with her lover, and to observe
the gradual encrease of her charms in his
presence; love, which embellishes the most
unmeaning countenance, must give to her's
a fire irresistible: what eyes! when ani∣mated
by tenderness!</P>
<P>The very soul acquires a new force and
beauty by loving; a woman of honor ne∣ver
appears half so amiable, or displays
half so many virtues, as when sensible to
the merit of a man who deserves her af∣fection.
Observe, Lucy, I shall never
allow you to be handsome till I hear you
are in love.</P>
<P>Did I tell you Emily Montague had the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inest hand and arm in the world? I should
however have excepted yours: her tone of
voice too has the same melodious sweetness,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
a perfection without which the loveliest
woman could never make the least impres∣sion
on my heart: I don't think you are
very unlike upon the whole, except that
she is paler. You know, Lucy, you have
often told me I should certainly have been
in love with you if I had not been your
brother: this resemblance is a proof you
were right. You are really as handsome as
any woman can be whose sensibility has
never been put in motion.</P>
<P>I am to give a ball to-morrow; Mrs.
Melmoth is to have the honors of it, but as
she is with child, she does not dance. This
circumstance has produc'd a dispute not a
little flattering to my vanity: the ladies
are making interest to dance with me;
what a happy exchange have I made! what
man of common sense would stay to be
overlook'd in England, who can have ri∣val
beauties contend for him in Canada?
This important point is not yet settled; the
<HI>etiquette</HI> here is rather difficult to adjust;
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
as to me, I have nothing to do in the con∣sultation;
my hand is destin'd to the longest
pedigree; we stand prodigiously on our
noblesse at Montreal.</P>
<P>Four o'clock.</P>
<P>After a dispute in which two French la∣dies
were near drawing their husbands into
a duel, the point of honor is yielded by
both to Miss Montague; each insisting only
that I should not dance with the other: for
my part, I submit with a good grace, as
you will suppose.</P>
<P>Saturday morning.</P>
<P>I never passed a more agreeable evening:
we have our amusements here, I assure you:
a set of fine young fellows, and handsome
women, all well dress'd, and in humor with
themselves, and with each other: my lovely
Emily like Venus amongst the Graces, only
multiplied to about sixteen. Nothing is, in
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
my opinion, so favorable to the display of
beauty as a ball. A state of rest is ungrace∣ful;
all nature is most beautiful in motion;
trees agitated by the wind, a ship under sail,
a horse in the course, a fine woman danc∣ing:
never any human being had such an
aversion to still life as I have.</P>
<P>I am going back to Melmoth's for a
month; don't be alarm'd, Lucy! I see all
her perfections, but I see them with the
cold eye of admiration only: a woman en∣gaged
loses all her attractions as a woman;
there is no love without a ray of hope: my
only ambition is to be her friend; I want to
be the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idant of her passion. With what
spirit such a mind as hers must love!</P>

<P>BY Heavens, Lucy, this is more than
man can bear; I was mad to stay so
long at Melmoth's; there is no resisting
this little seducer: 'tis shameful in such a
lovely woman to have understanding too;
yet even this I could forgive, had she not
that enchanting softness in her manner,
which steals upon the soul, and would al∣most
make ugliness itself charm; were she
but vain, one had some chance, but she will
take upon her to have no consciousness, at
least no apparent consciousness, of her per∣fections,
which is really intolerable. I told
her so last night, when she put on such a
malicious smile—I believe the little tyrant
wants to add me to the list of her slaves;
but I was not form'd to sill up a train. The
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
woman I love must be so far from giving
another the preference, that she must have
no soul but for me; I am one of the most
unreasonable men in the world on this head;
she may fancy what she pleases, but I set
her and all her attractions at defiance: I
have made my escape, and shall set off for
Quebec in an hour. Flying is, I must ac∣knowledge,
a little out of character, and
unbecoming a soldier; but in these cases,
it is the very best thing man or woman
either can do, when they doubt their
powers of resistance.</P>
<P>I intend to be ten days going to Quebec.
I propose visiting the priests at every vil∣lage,
and endeavouring to get some know∣ledge
of the nature of the country, in or∣der
to my intended settlement. Idleness be∣ing
the root of all evil, and the nurse of
love, I am determin'd to keep myself em∣ployed;
nothing can be better suited to
my temper than my present design; the
pleasure of cultivating lands here is as much
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
superior to what can be found in the same
employment in England, as watching the
expanding rose, and beholding the falling
leaves: America is in infancy, Europe in
old age. Nor am I very ill qualified for this
agreable task: I have studied the Georgicks,
and am a pretty enough kind of a husband∣man
as far as theory goes; nay, I am not
sure I shall not be, even in practice, the
best <HI>gentleman</HI> farmer in the province.</P>
<P>You may expect soon to hear of me in
the <HI>Museum Rusticum;</HI> I intend to make
amazing discoveries in the rural way: I
have already found out, by the sorce of
my own genius, two very uncommon cir∣cumstances;
that in Canada, contrary to
what we see every where else, the country
is rich, the capital poor; the hills fruitful,
the vallies barren. You see what excellent
dispositions I have to be an useful member
of society: I had always a strong biass to
the study of natural philosophy.</P>

<P>YOU can't think, my dear, what a
fund of useful knowledge I have
treasur'd up during my journey from Mon∣treal.
This colony is a rich mine yet uno∣pen'd;
I do not mean of gold and silver,
but of what are of much more real value,
corn and cattle. Nothing is wanting but
encouragement and cultivation; the Cana∣dians
are at their ease even without labor;
nature is here a bounteous mother, who
pours forth her gifts almost unsolicited:
bigotry, stupidity, and laziness, united,
have not been able to keep the peasantry
poor. I rejoice to find such admirable ca∣pabilities
where I propose to fix my domi∣nion.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
I was hospitably entertained by the curés
all the way down, tho' they are in general
but ill provided for: the parochial clergy
are useful every where, but I have a great
aversion to monks, those drones in the po∣litical
hive, whose whole study seems to be
to make themselves as useless to the world
as possible. Think too of the shocking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndelicacy
of many of them, who make it a
point of religion to abjure linen, and wear
their habits till they drop off. How asto∣nishing
that any mind should suppose the
Deity an enemy to cleanliness! the Jewish
religion was hardly any thing else.</P>
<P>I paid my respects wherever I stopped, to
the <HI>seigneuress</HI> of the village; for as to the
seigneurs, except two or three, if they had
not wives, they would not be worth visiting.</P>
<P>I am every day more pleased with the
women here; and, if I was gallant, should
be in danger of being a convert to the
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
French stile of gallantry; which certainly
debases the mind much less than ours.</P>
<P>But what is all this to my Emily? How I
envy Sir George! what happiness has Hea∣ven
prepared for him, if he has a soul to
taste it!</P>
<P>I really must not think of her; I found
so much delight in her conversation, it was
quite time to come away; I am almost
ashamed to own how much difficulty I found
in leaving her: do you know I have scarce
slept since? This is absurd, but I cannot
help it; which by the way is an admirable
excuse for any thing.</P>
<P>I have been come but two hours, and
am going to Silleri, to pay my compliments
to your friend Miss Formor, who arrived
with her father, who comes to join his re∣giment,
since I lest Quebec. I hear there

<P>I CANNOT, Madam, express my obli∣gation

shall be very pert about it, being much more
solicitous to please you than him, for a

<P><PB N="54" REF="56"/>
I thought you had more penetration than
to suppose me indifferent: on the contrary,
sensibility is my fault; though it is not

it: I have admirable dispositions to

I can love <HI>like an angel,</HI> when I set in earnest
about it. But, alas! you are married, and
in love with your husband; and your friend
is in a situation still more unfavorable to a
lover's hopes. This is particularly unfortu∣nate,
as you are the only two of your be∣witching
sex in Canada, for whom my
heart feels the least sympathy. To be plain,
but don't tell the little Major, I am more

out a fleet, to seize, and bring you to my

<P><PB N="55" REF="57"/>
There is one virtue I admire extremely

compassion for the poor men, which

<P>You ask me how I like the French ladies

and many of them handsome; I
thought Madame L——so, even near you

Montague, no one can be more warmly in∣terested

occasion than I can express: a mind like
hers must, in marriage, be exquisitely happy

<P>I HAVE been a month arrived, my dear,
without having seen your brother, who
is at Montreal, but I am told is expected
to-day. I have spent my time however
very agreably. I know not what the win∣ter
may be, but I am enchanted with the
beauty of this country in summer; bold,
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
picturesque, romantic, nature reigns here
in all her wanton luxuriance, adorned by a
thousand wild graces which mock the cul∣tivated
beauties of Europe. The scenery
about the town is infinitely lovely; the
prospect extensive, and diversified by a va∣riety
of hills, woods, rivers, cascades, in∣termingled
with smiling farms and cottages,
and bounded by distant mountains which
seem to scale the very Heavens.</P>
<P>The days are much hotter here than in
England, but the heat is more supportable
from the breezes which always spring up
about noon; and the evenings are charm∣ing
beyond expression. We have much
thunder and lightening, but very few in∣stances
of their being fatal: the thunder is
more magnificent and aweful than in Eu∣rope,
and the lightening brighter and more
beautiful; I have even seen it of a clear
pale purple, resembling the gay tints of
the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60"/>
The verdure is equal to that of England,
and in the evening acquires an unspeak∣able
beauty from the lucid splendor of the
fire-flies sparkling like a thousand little
stars on the trees and on the grass.</P>
<P>There are two very noble falls of water
near Quebec, la Chaudiere and Montmo∣renci:
the former is a prodigious sheet of
water, rushing over the wildest rocks, and
forming a scene grotesque, irregular, asto∣nishing:
the latter, less wild, less irregular,
but more pleasing and more majestic, falls
from an immense height, down the side of
a romantic mountain, into the river St.
Lawrence, opposite the most smiling part
of the island of Orleans, to the cultivated
charms of which it forms the most striking
and agreeable contrast.</P>
<P>The river of the same name, which sup∣plies
the cascade of Montmorenci, is the
most lovely of all inaminate objects: but
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
why do I call it inanimate? It almost
breathes; I no longer wonder at the enthu∣siasm
of Greece and Rome; 'twas from
objects resembling this their mythology took
its rise; it seems the residence of a thou∣sand
deities.</P>
<P>Paint to yourself a stupendous rock
burst as it were in sunder by the hands of
nature, to give passage to a small, but very
deep and beautiful river; and forming on
each side a regular and magnificent wall,
crowned with the noblest woods that can
be imagined; the sides of these romantic
walls adorned with a variety of the gayest
flowers, and in many places little streams of
the purest water gushing through, and lo∣sing
themselves in the river below: a thou∣sand
natural grottoes in the rock make you
suppose yourself in the abode of the Nereids;
as a little island, covered with slowering
shrubs, about a mile above the falls, where
the river enlarges itself as if to give it room,
seems intended for the throne of the river
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
goddess. Beyond this, the rapids, formed
by the irregular projections of the rock,
which in some places seem almost to meet,
rival in beauty, as they excel in variety,
the cascade itself, and close this little world
of enchantment.</P>
<P>In short, the loveliness of this fairy scene
alone more than pays the fatigues of my
voyage; and, if I ever murmur at having
crossed the Atlantic, remind me that I
have seen the river Montmorenci.</P>
<P>I can give you a very imperfect account of
the people here; I have only examined the
landscape about Quebec, and have given very
little attention to the figures; the French
ladies are handsome, but as to the beaux,
they appear to me not at all dangerous,
and one might safely walk in a wood by
moonlight with the most agreeable French∣man
here. I am not surprized the Cana∣dian
ladies take such pains to seduce our
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
men from us; but I think it a little hard we
have no temptation to make reprisals.</P>
<P>I am at present at an extreme pretty
farm on the banks of the river St. Law∣rence;
the house stands at the foot of a
steep mountain covered with a variety of
trees, forming a verdant sloping wall, which
rises in a kind of regular confusion,
“Shade above shade, a woody theatre,”
and has in front this noble river, on which
the ships continually passing present to the
delighted eye the most charming moving
picture imaginable; I never saw a place so
formed to inspire that pleasing lassitude, that
divine inclination to saunter, which may not
improperly be called, the luxurious indo∣lence
of the country. I intend to build a
temple here to the charming goddess of
laziness.</P>
<P>A gentleman is just coming down the
winding path on the side of the hill, whom
by his air I take to be your brother. Adieu!
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
I must receive him: my father is at Que∣bec.</P>
<CLOSER>Yours,
<SIGNED>ARABELLA FERMOR.</SIGNED>
Your brother has given me a very
pleasing piece of intelligence: my
friend Emily Montague is at Mont∣real,
and is going to be married to
great advantage; I must write to
her immediately, and insist on her
making me a visit before she mar∣ries.
She came to America two
years ago, with her uncle Colonel
Montague, who died here, and I
imagined was gone back to England;
she is however at Montreal with
Mrs. Melmoth, a distant relation of
her mother's. Adieu! <HI>ma tres chere!</HI></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>Sept. 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Find, my dear, that absence and amuse∣ment
are the best remedies for a
beginning passion; I have passed a fort∣night
at the Indian village of Lorette,
where the novelty of the scene, and the
enquiries I have been led to make into
their antient religion and manners, have
been of a thousand times more service to
me than all the reflection in the world
would have been.</P>
<P>I will own to you that I staid too long
at Montreal, or rather at Major Mel∣moth's;
to be six weeks in the same house
with one of the most amiable, most pleas∣ing
of women, was a trying situation to a
heart full of sensibility, and of a sensibi∣lity
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
which has been hitherto, from a vari∣ety
of causes, a good deal restrained. I
should have avoided the danger from the
first, had it appeared to me what it really
was; but I thought myself secure in the
consideration of her engagements, a de∣fence
however which I found grow weaker
every day.</P>
<P>But to my savages: other nations talk
of liberty, they possess it; nothing can be
more astonishing than to see a little village
of about thirty or forty families, the small
remains of the Hurons, almost exterminated
by long and continual war with the Iro∣quoise,
preserve their independence in the
midst of an European colony consisting of
seventy thousand inhabitants; yet the fact
is true of the savages of Lorette; they
assert and they maintain that independence
with a spirit truly noble. One of our com∣pany
having said something which an In∣dian
understood as a supposition that they
had been <HI>subjects</HI> of France, his eyes struck
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
fire, he stop'd him abruptly, contrary to
their respectful and sensible custom of never
interrupting the person who speaks, “You
“mistake, brother,” said he; “we are
subjects to no prince; a savage is free
all over the world.” And he spoke only
truth; they are not only free as a people,
but every individual is perfectly so. Lord
of himself, at once subject and master, a
savage knows no superior, a circumstance
which has a striking effect on his behavi∣our;
unawed by rank or riches, distinctions
unknown amongst his own nation, he would
enter as unconcerned, would possess all his
powers as freely in the palace of an orien∣tal
monarch, as in the cottage of the mean∣est
peasant: 'tis the species, 'tis man, 'tis
his equal he respects, without regarding the
gaudy trappings, the accidental advantages,
to which polished nations pay homage.</P>
<P>I have taken some pains to develop their
present, as well as past, religious senti∣ments,
because the Jesuit missionaries have
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
boasted so much of their conversion; and
find they have rather engrafted a few of
the most plain and simple truths of Christi∣anity
on their ancient superstitions, than
exchanged one faith for another; they are
baptized, and even submit to what they
themselves call the <HI>yoke</HI> of confession, and
worship according to the outward forms of
the Romish church, the drapery of which
cannot but strike minds unused to splen∣dor;
but their belief is very little changed,
except that the women seem to pay great
reverence to the Virgin, perhaps because
flattering to the sex. They anciently be∣lieved
in one God, the ruler and creator
of the universe, whom they called <HI>the
Great Spirit</HI> and the <HI>Master of Life;</HI> in the
sun as his image and representative; in a
multitude of inferior spirits and demons;
and in a future state of rewards and pu∣nishments,
or, to use their own phrase, in <HI>a
country of souls.</HI> They reverenced the spi∣rits
of their departed heroes, but it does
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
not appear that they paid them any religi∣ous
adoration. Their morals were more
pure, their manners more simple, than
those of polished nations, except in what
regarded the intercourse of the sexes: the
young women before marriage were in∣dulged
in great libertinism, hid however
under the most reserved and decent exte∣rior.
They held adultery in abhorrence,
and with the more reason as their marriages
were dissolvible at pleasure. The missio∣naries
are said to have found no difficulty
so great in gaining them to Christianity, as
that of persuading them to marry for life:
they regarded the Christian system of mar∣riage
as contrary to the laws of nature
and reason; and asserted that, as the <HI>Great
Spirit</HI> formed us to be happy, it was op∣posing
his will, to continue together when
otherwise.</P>
<P>The sex we have so unjustly excluded
from power in Europe have a great share
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
in the Huron government; the chief is
chose by the matrons from amongst the
nearest male relations, by the female line,
of him he is to succeed; and is generally
an aunt's or sister's son; a custom which,
if we examine strictly into the principle on
which it is founded, seems a little to con∣tradict
what we are told of the extreme
chastity of the married ladies.</P>
<P>The power of the chief is extremely li∣mited;
he seems rather to advise his people
as a father than command them as a mas∣ter:
yet, as his commands are always rea∣sonable,
and for the general good, no prince
in the world is so well obeyed. They have
a supreme council of ancients, into which
every man enters of course at an age fixed,
and another of assistants to the chief on
common occasions, the members of which
are like him elected by the matrons: I am
pleased with this last regulation, as wo∣men
are, beyond all doubt, the best judges
of the merit of men; and I should be ex∣tremely
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
pleased to see it adopted in Eng∣land:
canvassing for elections would then
be the most agreeable thing in the world,
and I am sure the ladies would give their
votes on much more generous principles
than we do. In the true sense of the word,
<HI>we</HI> are the savages, who so impolitely de∣prive
you of the common rights of citizen∣ship,
and leave you no power but that of
which we cannot deprive you, the resistless
power of your charms. By the way, I
don't think you are obliged in conscience to
obey laws you have had no share in mak∣ing;
your plea would certainly be at least
as good as that of the Americans, about
which we every day hear so much.</P>
<P>The Hurons have no positive laws; yet
being a people not numerous, with a strong
sense of honor, and in that state of equa∣lity
which gives no food to the most tor∣menting
passions of the human heart, and
the council of ancients having a power to
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
punish atrocious crimes, which power how∣ever
they very seldom find occasion to use,
they live together in a tranquillity and or∣der
which appears to us surprizing.</P>
<P>In more numerous Indian nations, I am
told, every village has its chief and its coun∣cils,
and is perfectly independent on the
rest; but on great occasions summon a ge∣neral
council, to which every village sends
deputies.</P>
<P>Their language is at once sublime and
melodious; but, having much fewer ideas,
it is impossible it can be so copious as those
of Europe: the pronunciation of the men
is guttural, but that of the women ex∣tremely
soft and pleasing; without under∣standing
one word of the language, the
sound of it is very agreeable to me. Their
style even in speaking French is bold and
metaphorical: and I am told is on impor∣tant
occasions extremely sublime. Even in
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
common conversation they speak in figures,
of which I have this moment an instance.
A savage woman was wounded lately in de∣fending
an English family from the drunken
rage of one of her nation. I asked her
after her wound; “It is well,” said she;
my sisters at Quebec (meaning the English
ladies) have been kind to me; and pi∣astres,
you know, are very healing.”</P>
<P>They have no idea of letters, no alpha∣bet,
nor is their language reducible to
rules: 'tis by painting they preserve the
memory of the only events which interest
them, or that they think worth recording,
the conquests gained over their enemies in
war.</P>
<P>When I speak of their paintings, I
should not omit that, though extremely
rude, they have a strong resemblance to
the Chinese, a circumstance which struck
me the more, as it is not the stile of nature.
Their dances also, the most lively panto∣mimes
I ever saw, and especially the dance
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
of peace, exhibit variety of attitudes re∣sembling
the figures on Chinese fans; nor
have their features and complexion less
likeness to the pictures we see of the Tar∣tars,
as their wandering manner of life,
before they became christians, was the same.</P>
<P>If I thought it necessary to suppose they
were not natives of the country, and that
America was peopled later than the other
quarters of the world, I should imagine
them the descendants of Tartars; as no∣thing
can be more easy than their pas∣sage
from Asia, from which America is pro∣bably
not divided; or, if it is, by a very
narrow channel. But I leave this to those
who are better informed, being a subject
on which I honestly confess my ignorance.</P>
<P>I have already observed, that they retain
most of their antient superstitions. I should
particularize their belief in dreams, of
which folly even repeated disappointments
cannot cure them: they have also an unli∣mited
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
faith in their <HI>powawers,</HI> or conjurers,
of whom there is one in every Indian vil∣lage,
who is at once physician, orator, and
divine, and who is consulted as an oracle
on every occasion. As I happened to smile
at the recital a savage was making of a
prophetic dream, from which he assured us
of the death of an English officer whom I
knew to be alive, “You Europeans,”
said he, “are the most unreasonable peo∣ple
in the world; you laugh at our be∣lief
in dreams, and yet expect us to be∣lieve
things a thousand times more incre∣dible.”</P>
<P>Their general character is difficult to de∣scribe;
made up of contrary and even con∣tradictory
qualities, they are indolent, tran∣quil,
quiet, humane in peace; active, rest∣less,
cruel, serocious in war: courteous,
attentive, hospitable, and even polite, when
kindly treated; haughty, stern, vindictive,
when they are not; and their resentment
is the more to be dreaded, as they hold <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
point of honor to dissemble their sense of
an injury till they find an opportunity to
revenge it.</P>
<P>They are patient of cold and heat, of
hunger and thirst, even beyond all belief
when necessity requires, passing whole days,
and often three or four days together, with∣out
food, in the woods, when on the watch
for an enemy, or even on their hunting par∣ties;
yet indulging themselves in their
feasts even to the most brutal degree of in∣temperance.
They despise death, and suffer
the most excruciating tortures not only with∣out
a groan, but with an air of triumph;
singing their death song, deriding their tor∣mentors,
and threatening them with the
vengeance of their surviving friends: yet
hold it honorable to fly before an enemy
that appears the least superior in number
or force.</P>
<P>Deprived by their extreme ignorance,
and that indolence which nothing but their
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
ardor for war can surmount, of all the con∣veniencies,
as well as elegant refinements
of polished life; strangers to the softer pas∣sions,
love being with them on the same
footing as amongst their fellow-tenants of
the woods, their lives appear to me rather
tranquil than happy: they have fewer
cares, but they have also much fewer en∣joyments,
than fall to our share. I am told,
however, that, though insensible to love,
they are not without affections; are ex∣tremely
awake to friendship, and passionately
fond of their children.</P>
<P>They are of a copper color, which is
rendered more unpleasing by a quantity
of coarse red on their cheeks; but the chil∣dren,
when born, are of a pale silver white;
perhaps their indelicate custom of greasing
their bodies, and their being so much ex∣posed
to the air and sun even from in∣fancy,
may cause that total change of com∣plexion,
which I know not how otherwise
to account for: their hair is black and
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
shining, the women's very long, parted at
the top, and combed back, tied behind,
and often twisted with a thong of leather,
which they think very ornamental: the
dress of both sexes is a close jacket, reach∣ing
to their knees, with spatterdashes, all
of coarse blue cloth, shoes of deer-skin,
embroidered with porcupine quills, and
sometimes with silver spangles; and a blan∣ket
thrown across their shoulders, and fas∣tened
before with a kind of bodkin, with
necklaces, and other ornaments of beads or
shells.</P>
<P>They are in general tall, well made, and
agile to the last degree; have a lively ima∣gination,
a strong memory; and, as far as
their interests are concerned, are very dex∣trous
politicians.</P>
<P>Their address is cold and reserved; but
their treatment of strangers, and the un∣happy,
infinitely kind and hospitable. A
very worthy priest, with whom I am ac∣quainted
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
at Quebec, was some years since
shipwrecked in December on the island of
Anticosti: after a variety of distresses, not
difficult to be imagined on an island with∣out
inhabitants, during the severity of a
winter even colder than that of Canada;
he, with the small remains of his compa∣nions
who survived such complicated distress,
early in the spring, reached the main land
in their boat, and wandered to a cabbin of
savages; the ancient of which, having heard
his story, bid him enter, and liberally sup∣plied
their wants: “Approach, brother,”
said he; “the unhappy have a right to our
assistance; we are men, and cannot but
feel for the distresses which happen to
men;” a sentiment which has a strong
resemblance to a celebrated one in a Greek
tragedy.</P>
<P>You will not expect more from me on
this subject, as my residence here has been
short, and I can only be said to catch a few
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
marking features flying. I am unable to
give you a picture at full length.</P>
<P>Nothing astonishes me so much as to find
their manners so little changed by their in∣tercourse
with the Europeans; they seem
to have learnt nothing of us but excess in
drinking.</P>
<P>The situation of the village is very fine,
on an eminence, gently rising to a thick
wood at some distance, a beautiful little
serpentine river in front, on which are a
bridge, a mill, and a small cascade, at such
a distance as to be very pleasing objects
from their houses; and a cultivated coun∣try,
intermixed with little woods lying be∣tween
them and Quebec, from which they
are distant only nine very short miles.</P>
<P>What a letter have I written! I shall
quit my post of historian to your friend
Miss Fermor; the ladies love writing much
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
better than we do; and I should perhaps
be only just, if I said they write better.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY morning received a let∣ter
from Major Melmoth, to introduce
to my acquaintance Sir George Clay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,
who brought it; he wanted no other intro∣duction
to me than his being dear to the
most amiable woman breathing; in virtue
of that claim, he may command every civility,
every attention in my power. He break∣fasted
with me yesterday: we were two
hours alone, and had a great deal of con∣versation;
we afterwards spent the day to∣gether
very agreably, on a party of plea∣sure
in the country.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84"/>
I am going with him this afternoon to vi∣sit
Miss Fermor, to whom he has a letter
from the divine Emily, which he is to de∣liver
himself.</P>
<P>He is very handsome, but not of my fa∣vorite
stile of beauty: extremely fair and
blooming, with fine features, light hair
and eyes; his countenance not absolutely
heavy, but inanimate, and to my taste in∣sipid:
finely made, not ungenteel, but with∣out
that easy air of the world which I pre∣fer
to the most exact symmetry without it.
In short, he is what the country ladies in
England call <HI>a sweet pretty man.</HI> He dresses
well, has the finest horses and the hand∣somest
liveries I have seen in Canada. His
manner is civil but cold, his conversation
sensible but not spirited; he seems to be a
man rather to approve than to love. Will
you excuse me if I say, he resembles the
form my imagination paints of Prometheus's
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
man of clay, before he stole the celestial
fire to animate him?</P>
<P>Perhaps I serutinize him too strictly;
perhaps I am prejudiced in my judgment
by the very high idea I had form'd of the
man whom Emily Montague could love. I
will own to you, that I thought it impossible
for her to be pleased with meer beauty;
and I cannot even now change my opinion;
I shall find some latent fire, some hidden
spark, when we are better acquainted.</P>
<P>I intend to be very intimate with him, to
endeavour to see into his very soul; I am
hard to please in a husband for my Emily;
he must have spirit, he must have sensibi∣lity,
or he cannot make her happy.</P>
<P>He thank'd me for my civility to Miss
Montague: do you know I thought him
impertinent? and I am not yet sure he was
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
not so, though I saw he meant to be po∣lite.</P>
<P>He comes: our horses are at the door.
Adieu!</P>
<CLOSER>Yours,
<SIGNED>ED. RIVERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>We are return'd: I every hour like him
less. There were several ladies, French
and English, with Miss Fermor, all on the
rack to engage the Baronet's attention;
you have no notion of the effect of a title
in America. To do the ladies justice how∣ever,
he really look'd very handsome; the
ride, and the civilities he receiv'd from a
circle of pretty women, for they were well
chose, gave a glow to his complexion ex∣tremely
favorable to his desire of pleas∣ing,
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
which, through all his calmness, it was
impossible not to observe; he even at∣tempted
once or twice to be lively, but
fail'd: vanity itself could not inspire him
with vivacity; yet vanity is certainly his
ruling passion, if such a piece of still life
can be said to have any passions at all.</P>
<P>What a charm, my dear Lucy, is there
in sensibility! 'Tis the magnet which at∣tracts
all to itself: virtue may command es∣teem,
understanding and talents admiration,
beauty a transient desire; but 'tis sensibility
alone which can inspire love.</P>
<P>Yet the tender, the sensible Emily Mon∣tague—no,
my dear, 'tis impossible: she
may fancy she loves him, but it is not in
nature; unless she extremely mistakes his
character. His <HI>approbation</HI> of her, for he
cannot feel a livelier sentiment, may at
present, when with her, raise him a little
above his natural vegetative state, but after
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
marriage he will certainly sink into it
again.</P>
<P>If I have the least judgment in men, he
will be a cold, civil, inattentive husband;
a tasteless, insipid, silent companion; a tran∣quil,
frozen, unimpassion'd lover; his in∣sensibility
will secure her from rivals, his
vanity will give her all the drapery of
happiness; her friends will congratulate her
choice; she will be the envy of her own
sex: without giving positive offence, he
will every moment wound, because he is a
stranger to, all the fine feelings of a heart
like hers; she will seek in vain the friend,
the lover, she expected; yet, scarce know∣ing
of what to complain, she will accuse
herself of caprice, and be astonish'd to
find herself wretched with <HI>the best husband
in the world.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="89"/>
I tremble for her happiness; I know
how few of my own sex are to be found
who have the lively sensibility of yours,
and of those few how many wear out their
hearts by a life of gallantry and dissipation,
and bring only apathy and disgust into mar∣riage.
I know few men capable of making
her happy; but this Sir George—my
Lucy, I have not patience.</P>
<P>Did I tell you all the men here are in
love with your friend Bell Fermor? The
women all hate her, which is an unequivo∣cal
proof that she pleases the other sex.</P>

<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>Sept. 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY dearest Bell will better imagine
than I can describe, the pleasure
it gave me to hear of her being in Cana∣da;
I am impatient to see her, but as Mrs.
Melmoth comes in a fortnight to Quebec,
I know she will excuse my waiting to come
with her. My visit however is to Silleri; I
long to see my dear girl, to tell her a thou∣sand
little trifles interesting only to friend∣ship.</P>
<P>You congratulate me, my dear, on the
pleasing prospect I have before me; on
my approaching marriage with a man young,
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
rich, lovely, enamor'd, and of an amiable
character.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear, I am oblig'd to my uncle
for his choice; Sir George is all you have
heard; and, without doubt, loves me, as
he marries me with such an inferiority of
fortune. I am very happy certainly; how
is it possible I should be otherwise?</P>
<P>I could indeed wish my tenderness for
him more lively, but perhaps my wishes
are romantic. I prefer him to all his sex,
but wish my preference was of a less lan∣guid
nature; there is something in it more
like friendship than love; I see him with
pleasure, but I part from him without re∣gret;
yet he deserves my affection, and I
can have no objection to him which is not
founded in caprice.</P>
<P>You say true; Colonel Rivers is very
amiable; he pass'd six weeks with us, yet
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
we found his conversation always new; he
is the man on earth of whom one would
wish to make a friend; I think I could
already trust him with every sentiment of
my soul; I have even more confidence in
him than in Sir George whom I love; his

particularly adapted to please women.
Without designs, without pretensions; he
steals upon you in the character of a friend,

<P>BELIEVE me, Jack, you are wrong;
this vagrant taste is unnatural, and
does not lead to happiness; your eager
pursuit of pleasure defeats itself; love
gives no true delight but where the heart
is attach'd, and you do not give yours time
to six. Such is our unhappy frailty, that
the tenderest passion may wear out, and
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
another succeed, but the love of change
merely as change is not in nature; where it
is a real taste, 'tis a depraved one. Boys are
inconstant from vanity and affectation, old
men from decay of passion; but men, and
particularly men of sense, find their happi∣ness
only in that lively attachment of which
it is impossible for more than one to be the
object. Love is an intellectual pleasure,
and even the senses will be weakly affected
where the heart is silent.</P>
<P>You will find this truth confirmed even
within the walls of the seraglio; amidst
this crowd of rival beauties, eager to
please, one happy fair generally reigns in
the heart of the sultan; the rest serve
only to gratify his pride and ostentation,
and are regarded by him with the same
indifference as the furniture of his superb
palace, of which they may be said to make
a part.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="95"/>
With your estate, you should marry; I
have as many objections to the state as you
can have; I mean, on the footing marriage
is at present. But of this I am certain, that
two persons at once delicate and sensible,
united by friendship, by taste, by a con∣formity
of sentiment, by that lively ardent
tender inclination which alone deserves the
name of love, will find happiness in mar∣riage,
which is in vain sought in any other
kind of attachment.</P>
<P>You are so happy as to have the power
of chusing; you are rich, and have not the
temptation to a mercenary engagement.
Look round you for a companion, a confi∣dente;
a tender amiable friend, with all the
charms of a mistress: above all, be certain
of her affection, that you engage, that
you fill her whole soul. Find such a wo∣man,
my dear Temple, and you cannot make
too much haste to be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96"/>
I have a thousand things to say to you,
but am setting off immediately with Sir
George Clayton, to meet the lieutenant
governor at Montreal; a piece of respect
which I should pay with the most lively
pleasure, if it did not give me the oppor∣tunity
of seeing the woman in the world I
most admire. I am not however going to
set you the example of marrying: I am
not so happy; she is engaged to the gen∣tleman
who goes up with me. Adieu!</P>

<P>TAKE care, my dear Emily, you do
not fall into the common error of sen∣sible
and delicate minds, that of refining
away your happiness.</P>
<P>Sir George is handsome as an Adonis;
you allow him to be of an amiable cha∣racter;
he is rich, young, well born, and
loves you; you will have fine cloaths, fine
jewels, a fine house, a coach and six; all
the <HI>douceurs</HI> of marriage, with an extreme
pretty fellow, who is fond of you, whom
<HI>you see with pleasure, and preser to all his
sex;</HI> and yet you are discontented, because
you have not for him at twenty-four the
romantic passion of fifteen, or rather that
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
ideal passion which perhaps never existed
but in imagination.</P>
<P>To be happy in this world, it is necessary
not to raise one's ideas too high: if I loved
a man of Sir George's fortune half as well
as by your own account you love him, I
should not hesitate one moment about mar∣rying;
but sit down contented with ease,
affluence, and an agreeable man, without
expecting to find life what it certainly is
not, a state of continual rapture. 'Tis, I
am afraid, my dear, your misfortune to
have too much sensibility to be happy.</P>
<P>I could moralize exceedingly well thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
morning on the vanity of human wishes and
expectations, and the folly of hoping for
felicity in this vile sublunary world: but
the subject is a little exhausted, and I have
a passion for being original. I think all the
moral writers, who have set off with pro∣mising
to shew us the road to happiness,
have obligingly ended with telling us there
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
is no such thing; a conclusion extremely
consoling, and which if they had drawn be∣fore
they set pen to paper, would have
saved both themselves and their readers an
infinity of trouble. This fancy of hunting
for what one knows is not to be found, is
really an ingenious way of amusing both
one's self and the world: I wish people
would either write to some purpose, or be
so good as not to write at all.</P>
<P>I believe I shall set about writing a sys∣tem
of ethics myself, which shall be short,
clear, and comprehensive; nearer the Epi∣curean
perhaps than the Stoic; but rural,
refined, and sentimental; rural by all
means; for who does not know that virtue
is a country gentlewoman? all the good
mammas will tell you, there is no such be∣ing
to be heard of in town.</P>
<P>I shall certainly be glad to see you, my
dear; though I foresee strange revolutions
<HI>in the state of Denmark</HI> from this event;
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
at present I have all the men to myself,
and you must know I have a prodigious
aversion to divided empire: however, 'tis
some comfort they all know you are going
to be married. You may come, Emily;
only be so obliging to bring Sir George
along with you: in your present situation,
you are not so very formidable.</P>
<P>The men here, as I said before, are all
dying for me; there are many handsomer
women, but I flatter them, and the dear
creatures cannot resist it. I am a very good
girl to women, but naturally artful (if you
will allow the expression) to the other sex;
I can blush, look down, stifle a sigh, flutter
my fan, and seem so agreeably confused—
you have no notion, my dear, what fools
men are. If you had not got the start of
me, I would have had your little white-haired
baronet in a week, and yet I don't
take him to be made of very combustible
materials; rather mild, composed, and
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
pretty, I believe; but he has vanity, which
is quite enough for my purpose.</P>
<P>Either your love or Colonel Rivers will
have the honor to deliver this letter; 'tis
rather cruel to take them both from us at
once; however, we shall soon be made
amends; for we shall have a torrent of
beaux with the general.</P>
<P>Don't you think the sun in this country
vastly more chearing than in England? I
am charmed with the sun, to say nothing
of the moon, though to be sure I never saw
a moon-light night that deserved the name
till I came to America.</P>
<P><HI>Mon cher pere</HI> desires a thousand com∣pliments;
you know he has been in love
with you ever since you were seven years
old: he is vastly better for his voyage, and
the clear air of Canada, and looks ten years
younger than before he set out.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102"/>

<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Sept. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR brother, my dear, is gone to
Montreal with Sir George Clayton,
of whom I suppose you have heard, and
who is going to marry a friend of mine, to
pay a visit to <HI>Monsieur le General,</HI> who is
arrived there. The men in Canada, the
English I mean, are eternally changing
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
place, even when they have not so pleasing
a call; travelling is cheap and amusing, the
prospects lovely, the weather inviting; and
there are no very lively pleasures at pre∣sent
to attach them either to Quebec or
Montreal, so that they divide themselves
between both.</P>
<P>This fancy of the men, which is ex∣tremely
the mode, makes an agreable
circulation of inamoratoes, which serves to
vary the amusement of the ladies; so that
upon the whole 'tis a pretty fashion, and
deserves encouragement.</P>
<P>You expect too much of your brother,
my dear; the summer is charming here,
but with no such very striking difference
from that of England, as to give room to
say a vast deal on the subject; though I
believe, if you will please to compare our
letters, you will find, putting us together,
we cut a pretty figure in the descriptive
way; at least if your brother tells me truth.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="104"/>
You may expect a very well painted frost∣piece
from me in the winter; as to the
present season, it is just like any fine au∣tumn
in England: I may add, that the
beauty of the nights is much beyond my
power of description: a constant <HI>Aurora
borealis,</HI> without a cloud in the heavens;
and a moon so resplendent that you may
see to read the smallest print by its light;
one has nothing to wish but that it was
full moon every night. Our evening walks
are delicious, especially at Silleri, where
'tis the pleasantest thing in the world to lis∣ten
to soft nonsense,
<Q>“Whilst the moon dances through the
trembling leaves”</Q>
(A line I stole from Philander and Sylvia):
But to return:</P>
<P>The French ladies never walk but at
night, which shews their good taste; and
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
then only within the walls of Quebec,
which does not: they saunter slowly, after
supper, on a particular battery, which is a
kind of little Mall: they have no idea of
walking in the country, nor the least feel∣ing
of the lovely scene around them; there
are many of them who never saw the falls
of Montmorenci, though little more than
an hour's drive from the town. They seem
born without the smallest portion of curio∣sity,
or any idea of the pleasures of the
imagination, or indeed any pleasure but
that of being admired; love, or rather co∣quetry,
dress, and devotion, seem to share
all their hours: yet, as they are lively, and
in general handsome, the men are very
ready to excuse their want of knowledge.</P>
<P>There are two ladies in the province, I
am told, who read; but both of them are
above fifty, and they are regarded as pro∣digies
of erudition.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="106"/>
Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>Absolutely, Lucy, I will marry a savage,
and turn squaw (a pretty soft name for
an Indian princess!): never was any thing
delightful as their lives; they talk of
French husbands, but commend me to an
Indian one, who lets his wife ramble five
hundred miles, without asking where she is
going.</P>
<P>I was sitting after dinner with a book, in
a thicker of hawthorn near the beach,
when a loud laugh called my attention to
the river, where I saw a canoe of savages
making to the shore; there were six wo∣men,
and two or three children, without
one man amongst them: they landed, tied
the canoe to the root of a tree, and finding
out the most agreable shady spot amongst
the bushes with which the beach was
covered, which happened to be very near
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>
me, made a fire, on which they laid some
fish to broil, and, fetching water from
the river, sat down on the grass to their
frugal repast.</P>
<P>I stole softly to the house, and, ordering
a servant to bring some wine and cold pro∣visions,
returned to my squaws: I asked
them in French if they were of Lorette;
they shook their heads: I repeated the
question in English, when the oldest of the
women told me, they were not; that their
country was on the borders of New Eng∣land;
that, their husbands being on a hunt∣ing
party in the woods, curiosity, and the
desire of seeing their brethren the English
who had conquered Quebec, had brought
them up the great river, down which they
should return as soon as they had seen Mon∣treal.
She courteously asked me to sit down,
and eat with them, which I complied with,
and produced my part of the feast. We
soon became good company, and <HI>brighten'd
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
the chain of friendship</HI> with two bottles of
wine, which put them into such spirits,
that they danced, sung, shook me by the
hand, and grew so very fond of me, that
I began to be afraid I should not easily get
rid of them. They were very unwilling to
part with me; but, after two or three very
ridiculous hours, I with some difficulty pre∣vailed
on the ladies to pursue their voyage,
having first replenished their canoe with pro∣visions
and a few bottles of wine, and given
them a letter of recommendation to your
brother, that they might be in no distress
at Montreal.</P>
<P>Adieu! my father is just come in, and
has brought some company with him from
Quebec to supper.</P>

<PB N="105" REF="109"/>
Don't you think, my dear, my good
sisters the squaws seem to live some∣thing
the kind of life of our gyp∣sies?
The idea struck me as they
were dancing. I assure you, there is
a good deal of resemblance in their
persons: I have seen a fine old sea∣soned
female gypsey, of as dark a
complexion as a savage: they are
all equally marked as children of
the sun.</CLOSER>

<P>I Study my fellow traveller closely; his
character, indeed, is not difficult to as∣certain;
his feelings are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull, nothing makes
<PB N="106" REF="110"/>
the least impression on him; he is as insen∣sible
to the various beauties of the charm∣ing
country through which we have tra∣velled,
as the very Canadian peasants them∣selves
who inhabit it. I watched his eyes
at some of the most beautiful prospects,
and saw not the least gleam of pleasure
there: I introduced him here to an extreme
handsome French lady, and as lively as she
is handsome, the wife of an officer who is
of my acquaintance; the same tasteless com∣posure
prevailed; he complained of fa∣tigue,
and retired to his apartment at eight:
the family are now in bed, and I have an
hour to give to my dear Lucy.</P>
<P>He admires Emily because he has seen
her admired by all the world, but he can∣not
taste her charms of himself; they are
not of a stile to please him: I cannot sup∣port

so lost; there are a thousand insensible good

A rich, sober, sedate, presbyterian ci∣tizen's
daughter, educated by her grand∣mother

<P>NO, my dear, it is impossible she can
love him; his dull soul is ill suited to
hers; heavy, unmeaning, formal; a slave
to rules, to ceremony, to <HI>etiquette,</HI> he has
not an idea above those of a gentleman
usher. He has been three hours in town
without seeing her; dressing, and waiting
to pay his compliments first to the general,
who is riding, and every minute expected
back. I am all impatience, though only her
friend, but think it would be indecent in
me to go without him, and look like a de∣sign
of reproaching his coldness. How dif∣ferently
are we formed! I should have stole
a moment to see the woman I loved from
the first prince in the universe.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="113"/>
The general is returned. Adieu! till
our visit is over; we go from thence to Ma∣jor
Melmoth's, whose family I should have
told you are in town, and not half a street
from us. What a soul of fire has this
<HI>lover!</HI> 'Tis to profane the word to use it in
speaking of him.</P>
<P>One o'clock.</P>
<P>I am mistaken, Lucy; astonishing as it is,
she loves him; this dull clod of uninformed
earth has touched the lively soul of my
Emily. Love is indeed the child of ca∣price;
I will not say of sympathy, for what
sympathy can there be between two hearts
so different? I am hurt, she is lowered in
my esteem; I expected to find in the man
she loved, a mind sensible and tender as her
own.</P>
<P>I repeat it, my dear Lucy, she loves him;
I observed her when we entered the room;
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
she blushed, she turned pale, she trembled,
her voice faltered; every look spoke the
strong emotion of her soul.</P>
<P>She is paler than when I saw her last;
she is, I think, less beautiful, but more
touching than ever; there is a languor in
her air, a softness in her countenance,
which are the genuine marks of a heart in
love; all the tenderness of her soul is in
her eyes.</P>
<P>Shall I own to you all my injustice? I
hate this man for having the happiness to
please her: I cannot even behave to him
with the politeness due to every gentle∣man.</P>
<P>I begin to fear my weakness is greater
than I supposed.</P>
<P>22d in the evening.</P>
<P>I am certainly mad, Lucy; what right
have I to expect!—you will scarce believe
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
the excess of my folly. I went after dinner
to Major Melmoth's; I found Emily at pi∣quet
with Sir George: can you conceive
that I fancied myself ill used, that I scarce
spoke to her, and returned immediately
home, though strongly pressed to spend the
evening there. I walked two or three times
about my room, took my hat, and went to
visit the handsomest Frenchwoman at Mon∣treal,
whose windows are directly opposite
to Major Melmoth's; in the excess of my
anger, I asked this lady to dance with me
to-morrow at a little ball we are to have out
of town. Can you imagine any behaviour
more childish? It would have been scarce
pardonable at sixteen.</P>
<P>Adieu! my letter is called for. I will

Major Melmoth tells me, they are to be

<P>I HAVE but a moment, my dear, to ac∣knowledge
your last; this week has been
a continual hurry.</P>
<P>You mistake me; it is not the romantic
passion of fifteen I wish to feel, but that
tender lively friendship which alone can
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
give charms to so intimate an union as that
of marriage. I wish a greater conformity
in our characters, in our sentiments, in our
tastes.</P>
<P>But I will say no more on this subject till
I have the pleasure of seeing you at Silleri.
Mrs. Melmoth and I come in a ship which
sails in a day or two; they tell us, it is the
most agreeable way of coming: Colonel
Rivers is so polite, as to stay to accompany
us down: Major Melmoth asked Sir George,
but he preferred the pleasure of parading
into Quebec, and shewing his fine horses and
fine person to advantage, to that of attending
his mistress: shall I own to you that I am
hurt at this instance of his neglect, as I
know his attendance on the general was not
expected? His situation was more than a
sufficient excuse; it was highly improper
for two women to go to Quebec alone; it
is in some degree so that any other man
should accompany me at this time: my
pride is extremely wounded. I expect a
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>
thousand times more attention from him
since his acquisition of fortune; it is with
pain I tell you, my dear friend, he seems
to shew me much less. I will not descend
to suppose he presumes on this increase of
fortune, but he presumes on the inclination
he supposes I have for him; an inclination,
however, not violent enough to make me
submit to the least ill treatment from him.</P>
<P>In my present state of mind, I am ex∣tremely
hard to please; either his beha∣viour
or my temper have suffered a change.
I know not how it is, but I see his faults in a
much stronger light than I have ever seen
them before. I am alarmed at the coldness of
his disposition, so ill suited to the sensibi∣lity
of mine; I begin to doubt his being of
the amiable character I once supposed: in
short, I begin to doubt of the possibility
of his making me happy.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, call it an excess of
pride, when I say, I am much less inclined
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>
to marry him than when our situations were
equal. I certainly love him; I have a ha∣bit
of considering him as the man I am to
marry, but my affection is not of that kind
which will make me easy under the sense of
an obligation.</P>
<P>I will open all my heart to you when we
meet: I am not so happy as you imagine:
do not accuse me of caprice; can I be too
cautious, where the happiness of my whole

<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>Sept. 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT you say, my dear friend, is
more true than I wish it was; our
English women of character are generally
too reserved; their manner is cold and for∣bidding;
they seem to think it a crime to
be too attractive; they appear almost afraid
to please.</P>
<P>'Tis to this ill-judged reserve I attribute
the low prosligacy of too many of our young
men; the grave faces and distant beha∣viour
<PB N="118" REF="122"/>
of the generality of virtuous women
fright them from their acquaintance, and
drive them into the society of those wretched
votaries of vice, whose conversation de∣bases
every sentiment of their souls.</P>
<P>With as much beauty, good sense, sen∣sibility,
and softness, at least, as any wo∣men
on earth, no women please so little as
the English: depending on their native
charms, and on those really amiable quali∣ties
which envy cannot deny them, they are
too careless in acquiring those enchanting
nameless graces, which no language can de∣fine,
which give resistless force to beauty,
and even supply its place where it is want∣ing.</P>
<P>They are satisfied with being good,
without considering that unadorned vir∣tue
may command esteem, but will never
excite love; and both are necessary in mar∣riage,
which I suppose to be the state
every woman of honor has in prospect; for
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
I own myself rather incredulous as to the
assertions of maiden aunts and cousins to
the contrary. I wish my amiable country-women
would consider one moment, that vir∣tue
is never so lovely as when dressed in
smiles: the virtue of women should have
all the softness of the sex; it should be gen∣tle,
it should be even playful, to please.</P>
<P>There is a lady here, whom I wish you
to see, as the shortest way of explaining to
you all I mean; she is the most pleasing wo∣man
I ever beheld, independently of her
being one of the handsomest; her manner
is irresistible: she has all the smiling graces
of France, all the blushing delicacy and
native softness of England.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more delicate, my dear
Temple, than the manner in which you
offer me your estate in Rutland, by way of
anticipating your intended legacy: it is
however impossible for me to accept it; my
father, who saw me naturally more profuse
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
than became my expectations, took such
pains to counterwork it by inspiring me
with the love of independence, that I can∣not
have such an obligation even to you.</P>
<P>Besides, your legacy is left on the sup∣position
that you are not to marry, and I
am absolutely determined you shall; so that,
by accepting this mark of your esteem, I
should be robbing your younger children.</P>
<P>I have not a wish to be richer whilst I
am a batchelor, and the only woman I ever
wished to marry, the only one my heart
desires, will be in three weeks the wife of
another; I shall spend less than my income
here: shall I not then be rich? To make
you easy, know I have four thousand
pounds in the sunds; and that, from the
equality of living here, an ensign is obliged
to spend near as much as I am; he is inevi∣tably
ruined, but I save money.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="125"/>
I pity you, my friend; I am hurt to
hear you talk of happiness in the life you
at present lead; of finding pleasure in pos∣sessing
venal beauty; you are in danger of
acquiring a habit which will vitiate your
taste, and exclude you from that state of
refined and tender friendship for which na∣ture
formed a heart like yours, and which is
only to be found in marriage: I need not
add, in a marriage of choice.</P>
<P>It has been said that love marriages are
generally unhappy; nothing is more false;
marriages of meer inclination will always
be so: passion alone being concerned, when
that is gratified, all tenderness ceases of
course: but love, the gay child of sympa∣thy
and esteem, is, when attended by de∣licacy,
the only happiness worth a reason∣able
man's pursuit, and the choicest gift of
heaven: it is a softer, tenderer friendship,
enlivened by taste, and by the most ardent
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>
desire of pleasing, which time, instead of
destroying, will render every hour more
dear and interesting.</P>
<P>If, as you possibly will, you should call
me romantic, hear a man of pleasure on
the subject, the Petronius of the last age,
the elegant, but voluptuous St. Evremond,
who speaks in the following manner of the
friendship between married persons:</P>
<P>“I believe it is this pleasing intercourse
of tenderness, this reciprocation of es∣teem,
or, if you will, this mutual ardor
of preventing each other in every en∣dearing
mark of affection, in which con∣sists
the sweetness of this second species
of friendship.”</P>
<P>“I do not speak of other pleasures,
which are not so much in themselves as
in the assurance they give of the intire
possession of those we love: this appears
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
to me so true, that I am not afraid to
assert, the man who is by any other
means certainly assured of the tender∣ness
of her he loves, may easily sup∣port
the privation of those pleasures;
and that they ought not to enter into
the account of friendship, but as proofs
that it is without reserve.”</P>
<P>“'Tis true, few men are capable of the
purity of these sentiments, and 'tis for
that reason we so very seldom see per∣fect
friendship in marriage, at least for
any long time: the object which a sen∣sual
passion has in view cannot long sus∣tain
a commerce so noble as that of
friendship.”</P>
<P>You see, the pleasures you so much boast
are the least of those which true tender∣ness
has to give, and this in the opinion of
a voluptuary.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="128"/>
My dear Temple, all you have ever
known of love is nothing to that sweet con∣sent
of souls in unison, that harmony of
minds congenial to each other, of which
you have not yet an idea.</P>
<P>You have seen beauty, and it has inspired
a momentary emotion, but you have never
yet had a real attachment; you yet know
nothing of that irresistible tenderness, that
delirium of the soul, which, whilst it re∣fines,
adds strength to passion.</P>
<P>I perhaps say too much, but I wish with
ardor to see you happy; in which there is
the more merit, as I have not the least
prospect of being so myself.</P>
<P>I wish you to pursue the plan of life
which I myself think most likely to bring
nappiness, because I know our souls to
be of the same frame: we have taken dif∣ferent
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
roads, but you will come back to
mine. Awake to delicate pleasures, I
have no taste for any other; there are no
other for sensible minds. My gallantries
have been few, rather (if it is allowed to
speak thus of one's self even to a friend)
from elegance of taste than severity of
manners; I have loved seldom, because I
cannot love without esteem.</P>
<P>Believe me, Jack, the meer pleasure of
loving, even without a return, is superior to
all the joys of sense where the heart is un∣touched:
the French poet does not exag∣gerate
when he says,
<Q><L>—Amour;</L>
<L>Tous les autres plaisirs ne valent pas tes peines.</L></Q></P>
<P>You will perhaps call me mad; I am
just come from a woman who is capable of
making all mankind so. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Sept. 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been rambling about amongst
the peasants, and asking them a thou∣sand
questions, in order to satisfy your in∣quisitive
friend. As to my father, though,
properly speaking, your questions are ad∣dressed
to him, yet, being upon duty, he
begs that, for this time, you will accept of
an answer from me.</P>
<P>The Canadians live a good deal like
the ancient patriarchs; the lands were ori∣ginally
settled by the troops, every officer
became a seigneur, or lord of the manor,
every soldier took lands under his com∣mander;
but, as avarice is natural to man∣kind,
the soldiers took a great deal more
than they could cultivate, by way of pro∣viding
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
for a family: which is the reason so
much land is now waste in the finest part
of the province: those who had children,
and in general they have a great number,
portioned out their lands amongst them as
they married, and lived in the midst of a
little world of their descendents.</P>
<P>There are whole villages, and there is
even a large island, that of Coudre, where
the inhabitants are all the descendents of
one pair, if we only suppose that their
sons went to the next village for wives, for
I find no tradition of their having had a dis∣pensation
to marry their sisters.</P>
<P>The corn here is very good, though not
equal to ours; the harvest not half so gay
as in England, and for this reason, that
the lazy creatures leave the greatest part of
their land uncultivated, only sowing as
much corn of different sorts as will serve
themselves; and being too proud and too
idle to work for hire, every family gets in
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
its own harvest, which prevents all that jo∣vial
spirit which we find when the reapers
work together in large parties.</P>
<P>Idleness is the reigning passion here, from
the peasant to his lord; the gentlemen
never either ride on horseback or walk, but
are driven about like women, for they never
drive themselves, lolling at their ease in a
calache: the peasants, I mean the masters
of families, are pretty near as useless as
their lords.</P>
<P>You will scarce believe me, when I tell
you, that I have seen, at the farm next us,
two children, a very beautiful boy and
girl, of about eleven years old, assisted by
their grandmother, reaping a field of oats,
whilst the lazy father, a strong fellow of
thirty two, lay on the grass, smoaking his
pipe, about twenty yards from them: the
old people and children work here; those
in the age of strength and health only take
their pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="133"/>
<HI>A propos</HI> to smoaking, 'tis common to see
here boys of three years old, sitting at their
doors, smoaking their pipes, as grave and
composed as little old Chinese men on a
chimney.</P>
<P>You ask me after our fruits: we have,
as I am told, an immensity of cranberries
all the year; when the snow melts away
in spring, they are said to be found under
it as fresh and as good as in autumn: straw∣berries
and rasberries grow wild in profu∣sion;
you cannot walk a step in the fields
without treading on the former: great
plenty of currants, plumbs, apples, and
pears; a few cherries and grapes, but not
in much perfection: excellent musk me∣lons,
and water melons in abundance, but
not so good in proportion as the musk.
Not a peach, nor any thing of the kind;
this I am however convinced is less the fault
of the climate than of the people, who
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>
are too indolent to take pains for any thing
more than is absolutely necessary to their
existence. They might have any fruit here
but gooseberries, for which the summer is
too hot; there are bushes in the woods,
and some have been brought from England,
but the fruit falls off before it is ripe. The
wild fruits here, especially those of the
bramble kind, are in much greater variety
and perfection than in England.</P>
<P>When I speak of the natural productions
of the country, I should not forget that
hemp and hops grow every where in the
woods; I should imagine the former might
be cultivated here with great success, if the
people could be persuaded to cultivate any
thing.</P>
<P>A little corn of every kind, a little hay,
a little tobacco, half a dozen apple trees,
a few onions and cabbages, make the whole
of a Canadian plantation. There is scarce
a slower, except those in the woods, where
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
there is a variety of the most beautiful
shrubs I ever saw; the wild cherry, of which
the woods are full, is equally charming in
flower and in fruit; and, in my opinion, at
least equals the arbutus.</P>
<P>They sow their wheat in spring, never
manure the ground, and plough it in the
slightest manner; can it then be wondered
at that it is inferior to ours? They fancy the
frost would destroy it if sown in autumn;
but this is all prejudice, as experience has
shewn. I myself saw a field of wheat this
year at the governor's farm, which was
manured and sown in autumn, as fine as I
ever saw in England.</P>
<P>I should tell you, they are so indolent as
never to manure their lands, or even their
gardens; and that, till the English came, all
the manure of Quebec was thrown into the
river.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136"/>
You will judge how naturally rich
the soil must be, to produce good crops
without manure, and without ever lying
fallow, and almost without ploughing; yet
our political writers in England never speak
of Canada without the epithet of <HI>barren.</HI>
They tell me this extreme fertility is owing
to the snow, which lies five or six months
on the ground. Provisions are dear, which
is owing to the prodigious number of horses
kept here; every family having a carriage,
even the poorest peasant; and every son of
that peasant keeping a horse for his little
excursions of pleasure, besides those neces∣sary
for the business of the farm. The war
also destroyed the breed of cattle, which I
am told however begins to encrease; they
have even so far improved in corn, as to
export some this year to Italy and Spain.</P>
<P>Don't you think I am become an excel∣lent
farmeress? 'Tis intuition; some people
are born learned: are you not all astonish∣ment
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
at my knowledge? I never was so vain
of a letter in my life.</P>
<P>Shall I own the truth? I had most of my
intelligence from old John, who lived long
with my grandfather in the country; and
who, having little else to do here, has taken
some pains to pick up a competent know∣ledge
of the state of agriculture five miles
round Quebec.</P>
<P>Adieu! I am tired of the subject.</P>
<CLOSER>Your faithful,
<SIGNED>A. FERMOR.</SIGNED>
Now I think of it, why did you not
write to your brother? Did you
chuse me to expose my ignorance?
If so, I slatter myself you are a lit∣tle
taken in, for I think John and I
figure in the rural way.</CLOSER>

<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Sept. 29,</DATE> 10 o'clock.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O TO be sure! we are vastly to be pi∣tied:
no beaux at all with the ge∣neral;
only about six to one; a very pretty
proportion, and what I hope always to see.
We, the ladies I mean, drink chocolate
with the general to-morrow, and he gives
us a ball on Thursday; you would not
know Quebec again; nothing but smiling
faces now; all so gay as never was, the
sweetest country in the world; never ex∣pect
to see me in England again; one is
really somebody here: I have been asked
to dance by only twenty-seven.</P>
<P>On the subject of dancing, I am, as it
were, a little embarrased: you will please
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
to observe that, in the time of scarcity,
when all the men were at Montreal, I suf∣fered
a foolish little captain to sigh and say
civil things to me, <HI>pour passer le tems,</HI> and
the creature takes the airs of a lover, to
which he has not the least pretensions, and
chuses to be angry that I won't dance with
him on Thursday, and I positively won't.</P>
<P>It is really pretty enough that every ab∣surd
animal, who takes upon him to make
love to one, is to fancy himself entitled to
a return: I have no patience with the men's
ridiculousness: have you, Lucy?</P>
<P>But I see a ship coming down under full
fail; it may be Emily and her friends: the
colours are all out, they slacken sail; they
drop anchor opposite the house; 'tis cer∣tainly
them; I must fly to the beach:
music as I am a person, and an awning on
the deck: the boat puts off with your bro∣ther
in it. Adieu for a moment: I must
go and invite them on shore.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="140"/>
2 o'clock.</P>
<P>'Twas Emily and Mrs. Melmoth, with
two or three very pretty French women;
your brother is a happy man: I found tea
and coffee under the awning, and a table
loaded with Montreal fruit, which is vastly
better than ours; by the way, the colonel
has bought me an immensity; he is so
gallant and all that: we regaled ourselves,
and landed; they dine here, and we dance
in the evening; we are to have a syllabub
in the wood: my father has sent for Sir
George and Major Melmoth, and half a
dozen of the most agreable men, from
Quebec: he is enchanted with his little
Emily, he loved her when she was a child.
I cannot tell you how happy I am; my
Emily is handsomer than ever; you know
how partial I am to beauty: I never had a
friendship for an ugly woman in my life.</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu! <HI>ma tres chere.</HI>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>
<P>Your brother looks like an angel this
morning; he is not drest, he is not undrest,
but somehow, easy, elegant and enchant∣ing:
he has no powder, and his hair a
little <HI>degagée,</HI> blown about by the wind,
and agreably disordered; such fire in his
countenance; his eyes say a thousand agre∣able
things; he is in such spirits as I never
saw him: not a man of them has the least
chance to-day. I shall be in love with him
if he goes on at this rate: not that it will
be to any purpose in the world; he never
would even flirt with me, though I have
made him a thousand advances.</P>
<P>My heart is so light, Lucy, I cannot
describe it: I love Emily at my soul: 'tis
three years since I saw her, and there is
something so romantic in finding her in Ca∣nada:
there is no saying how happy I am:
I want only you, to be perfectly so.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="142"/>
3 o'clock.</P>
<P>The messenger is returned; Sir George
is gone with a party of French ladies to
Lake Charles: Emily blushed when the
message was delivered; he might reasona∣bly
suppose they would be here to-day, as
the wind was fair: your brother dances
with my sweet friend; she loses nothing by
the exchange; she is however a little
piqued at this appearance of disrespect.</P>
<P>12 o'clock.</P>
<P>Sir George came just as we sat down to
supper; he did right, he complained first,
and affected to be angry she had not sent
an express from <HI>Point au Tremble.</HI> He was
however gayer than usual, and very atten∣tive
to his mistress; your brother seemed
chagrined at his arrival; Emily perceived
it, and redoubled her politeness to him,
which in a little time restored part of his
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
good humor: upon the whole, it was an
agreable evening, but it would have been
more so, if Sir George had come at first,
or not at all.</P>
<P>The ladies lie here, and we go all toge∣ther
in the morning to Quebec; the gen∣tlemen
are going.</P>
<P>I steal a moment to seal, and give this to
the colonel, who will put it in his packet
to-morrow.</P>

<P>WOULD you believe it possible, my
dear, that Sir George should de∣cline
attending Emily Montague from Mon∣treal,
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>
and leave the pleasing commission to
me? I am obliged to him for the three
happiest days of my life, yet am piqued
at his chusing me for a <HI>cecisbeo</HI> to his mis∣tress:
he seems to think me a man <HI>sans
consequence,</HI> with whom a lady may safely
be trusted; there is nothing very flattering
in such a kind of confidence: let him take
care of himself, if he is impertinent, and
sets me at defiance; I am not vain, but set
our fortunes aside, and I dare enter the
lists with Sir George Clayton. I cannot
give her a coach and six; but I can give her,
what is more conducive to happiness, a
heart which knows how to value her per∣fections.</P>
<P>I never had so pleasing a journey; we
were three days coming down, because we
made it a continual party of pleasure, took
music with us, landed once or twice a day,
visited the French families we knew, lay
both nights on shore, and danced at the
seigneur's of the village.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="145"/>
This river, from Montreal to Quebec,
exhibits a scene perhaps not to be matched
in the world: it is settled on both sides,
though the settlements are not so numerous
on the south shore as on the other: the
lovely confusion of woods, mountains, mea∣dows,
corn fields, rivers (for there are several
on both sides, which lose themselves in the
St. Lawrence), intermixed with churches
and houses breaking upon you at a distance
through the trees, form a variety of land∣scapes,
to which it is difficult to do justice.</P>
<P>This charming scene, with a clear serene
sky, a gentle breeze in our favor, and the
conversation of half a dozen fine women,
would have made the voyage pleasing to the
most insensible man on earth: my Emily
too of the party, and most politely atten∣tive
to the pleasure she saw I had in making
the voyage agreable to her.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="146"/>
I every day love her more; and, without
considering the impropriety of it, I cannot
help giving way to an inclination, in which
I find such exquisite pleasure; I find a thou∣sand
charms in the least trifle I can do to
oblige her.</P>
<P>Don't reason with me on this subject: I
know it is madness to continue to see her;
but I find a delight in her conversation,
which I cannot prevail on myself to give
up till she is actually married.</P>
<P>I respect her engagements, and pretend to
no more from her than her friendship; but,
as to myself, will love her in whatever manner
I please: to shew you my prudence, how∣ever,
I intend to dance with the handsomest
unmarried Frenchwoman here on Thurs∣day,
and to shew her an attention which
shall destroy all suspicion of my tenderness
for Emily. I am jealous of Sir George,
and hate him; but I dissemble it better than
I thought it possible for me to do.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="147"/>
My Lucy, I am not happy; my mind is
in a state not to be described; I am weak
enough to encourage a hope for which
there is not the least foundation; I miscon∣strue
her friendship for me every moment;
and that attention which is meerly gratitude
for my apparent anxiety to oblige. I even
fancy her eyes understand mine, which I
am afraid speak too plainly the sentiments
of my heart.</P>
<P>I love her, my dear girl, to madness;

<P>AN enchanting ball, my dear; your lit∣tle
friend's head is turned. I was
more admired than Emily, which to be sure
did not flatter my vanity at all: I see she
must content herself with being beloved,
for without coquetry 'tis in vain to expect
admiration.</P>
<P>We had more than three hundred per∣sons
at the ball; above three fourths men;
all gay and well dressed, an elegant sup∣per;
in short, it was charming.</P>
<P>I am half inclined to marry; I am not
at all acquainted with the man I have fixed
upon, I never spoke to him till last night,
nor did he take the least notice of me, more
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
than of other ladies, but that is nothing;
he pleases me better than any man I have
seen here; he is not handsome, but well
made, and looks like a gentleman; he has
a good character, is heir to a very pretty
estate. I will think further of it: there is
nothing more easy than to have him if I
chuse it: 'tis only saying to some of his
friends, that I think Captain Fitzgerald the
most agreable fellow here, and he will
immediately be astonished he did not sooner
find out I was the handsomest woman. I
will consider this affair seriously: one must
marry, 'tis the mode; every body marries;
why don't you marry, Lucy?</P>
<P>This brother of yours is always here; I
am surprized Sir George is not jealous, for
he pays no sort of attention to me, 'tis easy
to see why he comes; I dare say I shan't
see him next week: Emily is going to Mrs.
Melmoth's, where she stays till to-morrow

dinner is over.</P>

a mind to think so.</P>
<P>I hear it whispered that the whole affair
of the wedding is to be settled next week;
my father is in the secret, I am not. Emily

<P>I AM going, my Lucy.—I know not well
whither I am going, but I will not stay
to see this marriage. Could you have be∣lieved
it possible—But what folly! Did
I not know her situation from the first?
Could I suppose she would break off an en∣gagement
of years, with a man who gives
so clear a proof that he prefers her to all
other women, to humor the frenzy of one
who has never even told her he loved her?</P>
<P>Captain Fermor assures me all is settled
but the day, and that she has promised to
name that to-morrow.</P>
<P>I will leave Quebec to-night; no one
shall know the road I take: I do not yet
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>
know it myself; I will cross over to Point
Levi with my valet de chambre, and go
wherever chance directs me. I cannot
bear even to hear the day named. I am
strongly inclined to write to her; but what
can I say? I should betray my tenderness in
spite of myself, and her compassion would
perhaps disturb her approaching happiness:
were it even possible she should prefer me

<P>I THINK I breathe a freer air now I am
out of Quebec. I cannot bear where∣ever
I go to meet this Sir George; his tri∣umphant
air is insupportable; he has, or I
fancy he has, all the insolence of a happy
rival; 'tis unjust, but I cannot avoid hat∣ing
him; I look on him as a man who has
deprived me of a good to which I foolishly
fancy I had pretensions.</P>
<P>My whole behaviour has been weak to
the last degree: I shall grow more reason∣able
when I no longer see this charming
woman; I ought sooner to have taken this
step.</P>
<P>I have sound here an excuse for my ex∣cursion;
I have heard of an estate to be

sold down the river; and am told the pur∣chase
will be less expence than clearing any
lands I might take up. I will go and see it;
it is an object, a pursuit, and will amuse
me.</P>
<P>I am going to send my servant back to
Quebec; my manner of leaving it must ap∣pear
extraordinary to my friends; I have
therefore made this estate my excuse. I
have written to Miss Fermor that I am going
to make a purchase; have begged my
warmest wishes to her lovely friend, for
whose happiness no one on earth is more
anxious; but have told her Sir George is
too much the object of my envy, to expect
from me very sincere congratulations.</P>

<P>MY visit to you is prevented by an
event beyond my hopes. Sir George
has this moment a letter from his mother,
desiring him earnestly to postpone his mar∣riage
till spring, for some reasons of conse∣quence
to his fortune, with the particulars
of which she will acquaint him by the next
packet.</P>
<P>He communicated this intelligence to me
with a grave air, but with a tranquillity
not to be described, and I received it with a
joy I found it impossible wholly to conceal.</P>
<P>I have now time to consult both my heart
and my reason at leisure, and to break with
him, if necessary, by degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="158"/>
What an escape have I had! I was within
four and twenty hours of either determin∣ing
to marry a man with whom I fear I
have little chance to be happy, or of
breaking with him in a manner that would
have subjected one or both of us to the cen∣sures
of a prying impertinent world, whose
censures the most steady temper cannot
always contemn.</P>
<P>I will own to you, my dear, I every
hour have more dread of this marriage:
his present situation has brought his faults
into full light. Captain Clayton, with lit∣tle
more than his commission, was modest,
humble, affable to his inferiors, polite to
all the world; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancied him possessed
of those more active virtues, which I sup∣posed
the smallness of his fortune prevented
from appearing. 'Tis with pain I see that
Sir George, with a splendid income, is ava∣ricious,
selfish, proud, vain, and profuse;
lavish to every caprice of vanity and osten∣tation
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
which regards himself, coldly inat∣tentive
to the real wants of others.</P>
<P>Is this a character to make your Emily
happy? We were not formed for each
other: no two minds were ever so different;
my happiness is in friendship, in the tender
affections, in the sweets of dear domestic
life; his in the idle parade of affluence, in
dress, in equipage, in all that splendor, which,
whilst it excites envy, is too often the mark
of wretchedness.</P>
<P>Shall I say more? Marriage is seldom
happy where there is a great disproportion
of fortune. The lover, after he loses that
endearing character in the husband, which
in common minds I am afraid is not long,
begins to reflect how many more thousands
he might have expected; and perhaps sus∣pects
his mistress of those interested motives
in marrying, of which he now feels his own
heart capable. Coldness, suspicion, and
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>
mutual want of esteem and confidence, fol∣low
of course.</P>
<P>I will come back with you to Silleri this
evening; I have no happiness but when I
am with you. Mrs. Melmoth is so fond of
Sir George, she is eternally persecuting me
with his praises; she is extremely mortified
at this delay, and very angry at the manner
in which I behave upon it.</P>

five or six months longer your own mistress;
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>

attending to. You will also have time to
see whether you like any body else better;

against six months absence, and the atten∣tion

<P>I AM at present, my dear Lucy, in the
wildest country on earth; I mean of
those which are inhabited at all: 'tis for
several leagues almost a continual forest,
with only a few straggling houses on the ri∣ver
side; 'tis however of not the least conse∣quence
to me, all places are equal to me
where Emily is not.</P>
<P>I seek amusement, but without finding
it: she is never one moment from my
thoughts; I am every hour on the point of
returning to Quebec; I cannot support the
idea of her leaving the country without
my seeing her.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="164"/>
'Tis a lady who has this estate to sell: I
am at present at her house; she is very
amiable; a widow about thirty, with an
agreable person, great vivacity, an excel∣lent
understanding, improved by reading, to
which the absolute solitude of her situation
has obliged her; she has an open pleasing
countenance, with a candor and sincerity
in her conversation which would please me,
if my mind was in a state to be pleased with
any thing. Through all the attention and
civility I think myself obliged to shew her,
she seems to perceive the melancholy
which I cannot shake off: she is always
contriving some little party for me, as if
she knew how much I am in want of amuse∣ment.</P>
<P><DATE>Oct. 12.</DATE></P>
<P>Madame Des Roches is very kind; she
sees my chagrin, and takes every method
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>
to divert it: she insists on my going in her
shallop to see the last settlement on the
river, opposite the Isle of Barnaby; she
does me the honor to accompany me, with
a gentleman and lady who live about a
mile from her.</P>
<P>Isle Barnaby, <DATE>Oct. 13.</DATE></P>
<P>I have been paying a very singular
visit; 'tis to a hermit, who has lived sixty
years alone on this island; I came to him
with a strong prejudice against him; I
have no opinion of those who fly society;
who seek a state of all others the most con∣trary
to our nature. Were I a tyrant, and
wished to inflict the most cruel punishment
human nature could support, I would se∣clude
criminals from the joys of society,
and deny them the endearing sight of their
species.</P>
<P>I am certain I could not exist a year
alone: I am miserable even in that degree
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
of solitude to which one is confined in a
ship; no words can speak the joy which I
felt when I came to America, on the first
appearance of something like the chearful
haunts of men; the first man, the first
house, nay the first Indian fire of which I
saw the smoke rise above the trees, gave me
the most lively transport that can be con∣ceived;
I felt all the force of those ties
which unite us to each other, of that so∣cial
love to which we owe all our happi∣ness
here.</P>
<P>But to my hermit: his appearance dis∣armed
my dislike; he is a tall old man,
with white hair and beard, the look of
one who has known better days, and the
strongest marks of benevolence in his
countenance. He received me with the ut∣most
hospitality, spread all his little stores
of fruit before me, fetched me fresh milk,
and water from a spring near his house.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="167"/>
After a little conversation, I expressed
my astonishment, that a man of whose kind∣ness
and humanity I had just had such
proof, could find his happiness in flying
mankind: I said a good deal on the sub∣ject,
to which he listened with the politest
attention.</P>
<P>“You appear,” said he, “of a temper
to pity the miseries of others. My story
is short and simple: I loved the most
amiable of women; I was beloved. The
avarice of our parents, who both had
more gainful views for us, prevented an
union on which our happiness depended.
My Louisa, who was threatened with an
immediate marriage with a man she de∣tested,
proposed to me to sly the tyranny
of our friends: she had an uncle at
Quebec, to whom she was dear. The
wilds of Canada, said she, may afford
us that refuge our cruel country denies
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
us. After a secret marriage, we embarked.
Our voyage was thus far happy; I landed
on the opposite shore, to seek refresh∣ments
for my Louisa; I was returning,
pleased with the thought of obliging the
object of all my tenderness, when a be∣ginning
storm drove me to seek shelter in
this bay. The storm encreased, I saw it's
progress with agonies not to be described;
the ship, which was in sight, was unable
to resist its fury; the sailors crowded
into the boat; they had the humanity to
place my Louisa there; they made for
the spot where I was, my eyes were
wildly fixed on them; I stood eagerly on
the utmost verge of the water, my arms
stretched out to receive her, my prayers
ardently addressed to Heaven, when an
immense wave broke over the boat; I
heard a general shriek; I even fancied I
distinguished my Louisa's cries; it sub∣sided,
the sailors again exerted all their
force; a second wave—I saw them no
more.”</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169"/>
“Never will that dreadful scene be ab∣sent
one moment from my memory: I
fell senseless on the beach; when I re∣turned
to life, the first object I beheld
was the breathless body of my Louisa
at my feet. Heaven gave me the wretched
consolation of rendering to her the last
sad duties. In that grave all my happi∣ness
lies buried. I knelt by her, and
breathed a vow to Heaven, to wait here
the moment that should join me to all I
held dear. I every morning visit her
loved remains, and implore the God of
mercy to hasten my dissolution. I feel
that we shall not long be separated;
I shall soon meet her, to part no more.”</P>
<P>He stopped, and, without seeming to
remember he was not alone, walked hastily
towards a little oratory he has built on the
beach, near which is the grave of his
Louisa; I followed him a few steps, I saw
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
him throw himself on his knees; and, re∣specting
his sorrow, returned to the house.</P>
<P>Though I cannot absolutely approve,
yet I more than forgive, I almost ad∣mire,
his renouncing the world in his situa∣tion.
Devotion is perhaps the only balm for
the wounds given by unhappy love; the
heart is too much softened by true tender∣ness
to admit any common cure.</P>
<P>Seven in the evening.</P>
<P>I am returned to Madame Des Roches and
her friends, who declined visiting the her∣mit.
I found in his conversation all which
could have adorned society; he was pleased
with the sympathy I shewed for his suffer∣ings;
we parted with regret. I wished to
have made him a present, but he will re∣ceive
nothing.</P>
<P>A ship for England is in sight. Madame
Des Roches is so polite to send off this let∣ter;

<P>I HAVE no patience with this foolish

I have been making the tour of the three
religions this morning, and, as I am the most
constant creature breathing; am come back
only a thousand times more pleased with
my own. I have been at mass, at church,
and at the presbyterian meeting: an idea
struck me at the last, in regard to the dra∣pery
of them all; that the Romish religion
is like an over-dressed, tawdry, rich citi∣zen's
wife; the presbyterian like a rude
aukward country girl; the church of Eng∣land
like an elegant well-dressed woman of
quality, “plain in her neatness” (to quote
Horace, who is my favorite author). There
is a noble, graceful simplicity both in the
worship and the ceremonies of the church
of England, which, even if I were a stranger
to her doctrines, would prejudice me strong∣ly
in her favor.</P>
<P>Sir George sets out for Montreal this

<P>I AM this moment arrived from a ramble
down the river; but, a ship being just
going, must acknowledge your last.</P>
<P>You make me happy in telling me my
dear Lady H——has given my place in her
heart to so honest a fellow as Jack Will∣mott;
and I sincerely wish the ladies al∣ways
chose their favorites as well.</P>
<P>I should be very unreasonable indeed to
expect constancy at almost four thousand
mil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s distance, especially when the pro∣spect
of my return is so very uncertain.</P>
<P>My voyage ought undoubtedly to be
considered as an abdication: I am to all in∣tents
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>
and purposes dead in law as a lover;
and the lady has a right to consider her heart
as vacant, and to proceed to a new election.</P>
<P>I claim no more than a share in her es∣teem
and remembrance, which I dare say
I shall never want.</P>
<P>That I have amused myself a little in
the dowager way, I am very far from de∣nying;
but you will observe, it was les<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
from taste than the principle of doing as
little mischief as possible in my few excur∣sions
to the world of gallantry. A little
deviation from the exact rule of right we
men all allow ourselves in love a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>airs; but
I was willing to keep as near it as I could.
Married women are, on my principles, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣bidden
fruit; I abhor the seduction of in∣nocence;
I am too delicate, and (with all
my modesty) too vain, to be pleased with
venal beauty: what was I then to do, with
a heart too active to be absolutely at rest,
<PB N="176" REF="180"/>
and which had not met with it's counter∣part?
Widows were, I thought, fair prey,
as being sufficiently experienced to take care
of themselves.</P>
<P>I have said married women are, on my
principles, forbidden fruit: I should have
explained myself; I mean in England, for
my ideas on this head change as soon as I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is.</P>
<P>Such is the amazing force of local pre∣judice,
that I do not recollect having ever
made love to an English married woman, or
a French unmarried one. Marriages in
France being made by the parents, and
therefore generally without inclination on
either side, gallantry seems to be a tacit
condition, though not absolutely expressed
in the contract.</P>
<P>But to return to my plan: I think it an
excellent one; and would recommend it to all
those young men about town, who, like me,
<PB N="177" REF="181"/>
find in their hearts the necessity of loving,
before they meet with an object capable of
fixing them for life.</P>
<P>By the way, I think the widows ought
to raise a statue to my honor, for having
done my <HI>possible</HI> to prove that, for the sake
of decorum, morals, and order, they ought
to have all the men to themselves.</P>
<P>I have this moment your letter from
Rutland. Do you know I am almost angry?
Your ideas of love are narrow and pedan∣tic;
custom has done enough to make the
life of one half of our species tasteless;
but you would reduce them to a state of
still greater insipidity than even that to
which our tyranny has doomed them.</P>
<P>You would limit the pleasure of loving
and being beloved, and the charming power
of pleasing, to three or four years only in
the life of that sex which is peculiarly
formed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel tenderness; women are born
<PB N="178" REF="182"/>
with more lively affections than men, which
are still more softened by education; to deny
them the privilege of being amiable, the
only privilege we allow them, as long as
nature continues them so, is such a mixture
of cruelty and false taste as I should never
have suspected you of, notwithstanding your
partiality for unripened beauty.</P>
<P>As to myself, I persist in my opinion,
that women are most charming when they
join the attractions of the mind to those
of the person, when they feel the passion
they inspire; or rather, that they are ne∣ver
charming till then.</P>
<P>A woman in the first bloom of youth re∣sembles
a tree in blossom; when mature, in

<P>OUR wanderer is returned, my dear,
and in such spirits as you can't con∣ceive:
he passed yesterday with us; he
<PB N="181" REF="185"/>
likes to have us to himself, and he had yes∣terday;
we walked <HI>à trio</HI> in the wood, and
were foolish; I have not passed so agreable a
day since I came to Canada: I love mightily to
be foolish, and the people here have no
taste that way at all: your brother is di∣vinely
so upon occasion. The weather was,
to use the Canadian phrase, <HI>superbe et mag∣nifique.</HI>
We shall not, I am told, have much
more in the same <HI>magni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ique</HI> style, so we
intend to make the most of it: I have or∣dered
your brother to come and walk with
us from morning till night; every day and
all the day.</P>
<P>The dear man was amazingly overjoyed
to see us again; we shared in his joy,
though my little Emily took some pains to
appear tranquil on the occasion: I never
saw more pleasure in the countenances of
two people in my life, nor more pains
taken to suppress it.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="186"/>
Do you know Fitzgerald is really an
agreable fellow? I have an admirable natu∣ral
instinct; I perceived he had under∣standing,
from his aquiline nose and his
eagle eye, which are indexes I never knew
fail. I believe we are going to be great;
I am not sure I shall not admit him to make
up a <HI>partie quarréc</HI> with your brother and
Emily: I told him my original plot upon
him, and he was immensely pleased with
it. I almost fancy he can be foolish; in
that case, my business is done: if with
his other merits he has that, I am a lost
woman.</P>
<P>He has excellent sense, great good na∣ture,
and the true princely spirit of an
Irishman: he will be ruined here, but that
is his affair, not mine. He changed quar∣ters
with an o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icer now at Montreal; and,
because the lodgings were to be furnished,
thought himself obliged to leave three
months wine in the cellars.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="187"/>
His person is pleasing; he has good
eyes and teeth (the only beauties I require),
is marked with the small pox, which in
men gives a sensible look; very manly,
and looks extremely like a gentleman.</P>
<P>He comes, the conqueror comes.</P>
<P>I see him plainly through the trees; he
is now in full view, within twenty yards of
the house. He looks particularly well on
horseback, Lucy; which is one certain
proof of a good education. The fellow is
well born, and has ideas of things: I think I
shall admit him of my train.</P>
<P>Emily wonders I have never been in
love: the cause is clear; I have prevented
any attachment to one man, by constantly
flirting with twenty: 'tis the most sovereign
receipt in the world. I think too, my dear,
you have maintained a sort of running fight

<P>I AM returned, my dear, and have had
the pleasure of hearing you and my
mother are well, though I have had no
letters from either of you.</P>
<P>Mr. Temple, my dearest Lucy, tells me
he has visited you. Will you pardon me a
freedom which nothing but the most tender
friendship can warrant, when I tell you
<PB N="185" REF="189"/>
that I would wish you to be as little ac∣quainted
with him as politeness allows? He
is a most agreable man, perhaps too agre∣able,
with a thousand amiable qualities; he
is the man I love above all others; and,
where women are not concerned, a man of
the most unblemished honor: but his manner
of life is extremely libertine, and his ideas
of women unworthy the rest of his cha∣racter;
he knows not the perfections which
adorn the valuable part of your sex, he is
a stranger to your virtues, and incapable,
at least I fear so, of that tender affection
which alone can make an amiable woman
happy. With all this, he is polite and at∣tentive,
and has a manner, which, without
intending it, is calculated to deceive women
into an opinion of his being attached when
he is not: he has all the splendid virtues
which command esteem; is noble, gene∣rous,
disinterested, open, brave; and is the
most dangerous man on earth to a woman
<PB N="186" REF="190"/>
of honor, who is unacquainted with the
arts of man.</P>
<P>Do not however mistake me, my Lucy;
I know him to be as incapable of forming
improper designs on you, even were you
not the sister of his friend, as you are of
listening to him if he did: 'tis for your
heart alone I am alarmed; he is formed to
please; you are young and inexperienced,
and have not yet loved; my anxiety for
your peace makes me dread your loving a
man whose views are not turned to mar∣riage,
and who is therefore incapable of re∣turning
properly the tenderness of a wo∣man
of honor.</P>
<P>I have seen my divine Emily: her man∣ner
of receiving me was very flattering; I
cannot doubt her friendship for me; yet I
am not absolutely content. I am however
convinced, by the easy tranquillity of her
air, and her manner of bearing this delay
of their marriage, that she does not love
<PB N="187" REF="191"/>
the man for whom she is intended: she has
been a victim to the avarice of her friends.
I would fain hope—yet what have I to
hope? If I had even the happiness to be
agreable to her, if she was disengaged from
Sir George, my fortune makes it impossible
for me to marry her, without reducing her
to indigence at home, or dooming her to
be an exile in Canada for life. I dare not
ask myself what I wish or intend: yet I
give way in spite of me to the delight of
seeing and conversing with her.</P>
<P>I must not look forward; I will only en∣joy
the present pleasure of believing myself
one of the first in her esteem and friend∣ship,
and of shewing her all those little
pleasing attentions so dear to a sensible
heart; attentions in which her <HI>lover</HI> is
astonishingly remiss: he is at Montreal, and
I am told was gay and happy on his jour∣ney
thither, though he left his mistress
behind.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="192"/>
I have spent two very happy days at

<P>I DANCED last night till four o'clock in
the morning (if you will allow the ex∣pression),
without being the least fatigued:
the little Fitzgerald was my partner, who
grows upon me extremely; the monkey
has a way of being attentive and careless
by turns, which has an amazing effect; no∣thing
attaches a woman of my temper so
much to a lover as her being a little in fear
of losing him; and he keeps up the spirit
of the thing admirably.</P>
<P>Your brother and Emily danced together,
and I think I never saw either of them look
so handsome; she was a thousand times
more admired at this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than the first,
and reason good, for she was a thousand
<PB N="191" REF="195"/>
times more agreable; your brother is
really a charming fellow, he is an immense
favorite with the ladies; he has that very
pleasing general attention, which never fails
to charm women; he can even be particu∣lar
to one, without wounding the vanity of
the rest: if he was in company with twenty,
his misterss of the number, his manner
would be such, that every woman there
would think herself the second in his esteem;
and that, if his heart had not been unluckily
pre-engaged, she herself should have been
the object of his tenderness.</P>
<P>His eyes are of immense use to him; he
looks the civilest things imaginable, his
whole coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ance speaks whatever he
wishes to say; he has the least occasion for
words to explain himself of any man I ever
knew.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald has eyes too, I assure you, and
eyes that know how to speak; he has a
<PB N="192" REF="196"/>
look of saucy unconcern and inattention,
which is really irresistible.</P>
<P>We have had a great deal of snow already,
but it melts away; 'tis a lovely day, but an
odd enough mixture of summer and winter;
in some places you see half a foot of snow
lying, in others the dust is even trouble∣some.</P>

<P>THE savages assure us, my dear, on the
information of the beavers, that we
shall have a very mild winter: it seems, these
creatures have laid in a less winter stock
than usual. I take it very ill, Lucy, that
the beavers have better intelligence than
we have.</P>
<P>We are got into a pretty composed easy
way; Sir George writes very agreable,
sensible, sentimental, gossiping letters, once
a fortnight, which Emily answers in due
course, with all the regularity of a counting∣house
correspondence; he talks of coming
down after Christmas: we expect him with∣out
impatience; and in the mean time
amuse ourselves as well as we can, and soften
<PB N="194" REF="198"/>
the pain of absence by the attention of a
man that I fancy we like quite as well.</P>
<P>With submission to the beavers, the
weather is very cold, and we have had a
great deal of snow already; but they tell
me 'tis nothing to what we shall have: they
are taking precautions which make me shud∣der
beforehand, pasting up the windows,
and not leaving an avenue where cold can
enter.</P>
<P>I like the winter carriages immensely;
the open carriole is a kind of one-horse
chaise, the covered one a chariot, set on a
sledge to run on the icc; we have not yet
had snow enough to use them, but I like
their appearance prodigiously; the covered
carrioles seem the prettiest things in nature
to make love in, as there are curtains to draw
before the windows: we shall have three
in effect, my father's, Rivers's, and Fitz∣gerald's;
the two latter are to be elegance
itself, and entirely for the service of the
<PB N="195" REF="199"/>
ladies: your brother and Fitzgerald are
trying who shall be ruined first for the honor
of their country. I will bet three to one
upon Ireland. They are every day contriv∣ing

My Emily is every day more lovely; I

handsome, but she would please every feel∣ing

<P>MR. Melmoth and I, my dear Emily,
expected by this time to have seen
you at Montreal. I allow something to
your friendship for Miss Fermor; but there
is also something due to relations who ten∣derly
love you, and under whose protec∣tion
your uncle left you at his death.</P>
<P>I should add, that there is something
due to Sir George, had I not already dis∣pleased
you by what I have said on the

<P>You are not to be told, that in a week

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Nov. 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE a thousand reasons, my dearest
Madam, for intreating you to excuse
my staying some time longer at Quebec.
I have the sincerest esteem for Sir George,
and am not insensible of the force of our
engagements; but do not think his being
there a reason for my coming: the kind of
suspended state, to say no more, in which
those engagements now are, call for a de∣licacy
in my behaviour to him, which is
so difficult to observe without the appear∣ance
of affectation, that his absence re∣lieves
me for a very painful kind of re∣straint:
for the same reason, 'tis impossible
for me to come up at the time he does, if
I do come, even though Miss Fermor should
accompany me.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="204"/>
A moment's reflexion will convince you
of the propriety of my staying here till
his mother does me the honor again to ap∣prove
his choice; or till our engagement is
publicly known to be at an end. Mrs.
Clayton is a prudent mother, and a woman
of the world, and may consider that Sir
George's situation is changed since she con∣sented
to his marriage.</P>
<P>I am not capricious; but I will own to
you, that my esteem for Sir George is much
lessened by his behaviour since his last re∣turn
from New-York: he mistakes me ex∣tremely,
if he supposes he has the least
additional merit in my eyes from his late
acquisition of fortune: on the contrary, I
now see faults in him which were concealed
by the mediocrity of his situation before,
and which do not promise happiness to a
heart like mine, a heart which has little
taste for the false glitter of li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and the

<P>I HAVE been seeing the last ship go out
of the port, Lucy; you have no no∣tion
what a melancholy fight it is: we are
now left to ourselves, and shut up from all
the world for the winter: somehow we
<PB N="202" REF="206"/>
seem so forsaken, so cut off from the rest
of human kind, I cannot bear the idea: I
sent a thousand sighs and a thousand ten∣der
wishes to dear England, which I never
loved so much as at this moment.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear, I could cry if I
was not ashamed? I shall not absolutely be
in spirits again this week.</P>
<P>'Tis the first time I have felt any thing
like bad spirits in Canada: I followed the
ship with my eyes till it turned Point Levi,
and, when I lost sight of it, felt as if I had
lost every thing dear to me on earth. I am
not particular: I see a gloom on every
countenance; I have been at church, and
think I never saw so many dejected faces in
my life.</P>
<P>Adieu! for the present: it will be a
fortnight before I can send this letter;
another agreable circumstance that: would
<PB N="203" REF="207"/>
to Heaven I were in England, though I
changed the bright sun of Canada for a
fog!</P>
<P><DATE>Dec. 1.</DATE></P>
<P>We have had a week's snow without in∣termission:
happily for us, your brother
and the Fitz have been weather-bound all
the time at Silleri, and cannot possibly get
away.</P>
<P>We have amused ourselves within doors,
for there is no stirring abroad, with play∣ing
at cards, playing at shuttlecock, playing
the fool, making love, and making moral
reflexions: upon the whole, the week has
not been very disagreable.</P>
<P>The snow is when we wake constantly
up to our chamber windows; we are lite∣rally
dug out of it every morning.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="208"/>
As to Quebec, I give up all hopes of
ever seeing it again: but my comfort is,
that the people there cannot possibly get
to their neighbors; and I flatter myself
very few of them have been half so well
entertained at home.</P>
<P>We shall be abused, I know, for (what is
really the fault of the weather) keeping
these two creatures here this week; the
ladies hate us for engrossing two such fine
fellows as your brother and Fitzgerald, as
well as for having vastly more than our
share of all the men: we generally go out
attended by at least a dozen, without any
other woman but a lively old French lady,
who is a slirt of my father's, and will cer∣tainly
be my mamma.</P>
<P>We sweep into the general's assembly
on Thursdays with such a train of beaux
as draws every eye upon us: the rest of
the fellows crowd round us; the misses
draw up, blush, and slutter their fans; and
<PB N="205" REF="209"/>
your little Bell sits down with such a saucy
impertinent consciousness in her counte∣nance
as is really provoking: Emily on the
contrary looks mild and humble, and seems
by her civil decent air to apologize to them
for being so much more agreable than
themselves, which is a fault I for my part
am not in the least inclined to be ashamed
of.</P>
<P>Your idea of Quebec, my dear, is per∣fectly
just; it is like a third or fourth rate
country town in England; much hospitality,
little society; cards, scandal, dancing, and
good chear; all excellent things to pass
away a winter evening, and peculiarly
adapted to what I am told, and what I be∣gin
to feel, of the severity of this climate.</P>
<P>I am told they abuse me, which I can
easily believe, because my impertinence to
them deserves it: but what care I, you
know, Lucy, so long as I please myself,
and am at Silleri out of the sound?</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="210"/>
They are squabbling at Quebec, I hear,
about I cannot tell what, therefore shall
not attempt to explain: some dregs of old
disputes, it seems, which have had not time
to settle: however, we new comers have
certainly nothing to do with these matters:
you can't think how comfortable we feel
at Silleri, out of the way.</P>
<P>My father says, the politics of Canada
are as complex and as difficult to be under∣stood
as those of the Germanic system.</P>
<P>For my part, I think no politics worth
attending to but those of the little com∣monwealth
of woman: if I can maintain
my empire over hearts, I leave the men to
quarrel for every thing else.</P>
<P>I observe a strict neutrality, that I may
have a chance for admirers amongst both
parties. Adieu! the post is just going out.</P>

<P>THERE is something, my dear Emily,
in what you say as to the delicacy
of your situation; but, whilst you are so
very exact in acting up to it on one side,
do you not a little overlook it on the
other?</P>
<P>I am extremely unwilling to say a dis∣agreable
thing to you, but Miss Fermor is
too young as well as too gay to be a pro∣tection—the
very particular circumstance
you mention makes Mr. Melmoth's the
only house in Canada in which, if I have
any judgment, you can with propriety live
till your marriage takes place.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="212"/>
You extremely injure Sir George in sup∣posing
it possible he should fail in his en∣gagements:
and I see with pain that you
are more quicksighted to his failings than
is quite consistent with that tenderness,
which (allow me to say) he has a right to
expect from you. He is like other men of
his age and fortune; he is the very man
you so lately thought amiable, and of
whose love you cannot without injustice
have a doubt.</P>
<P>Though I approve your contempt of the
false glitter of the world, yet I think it a
little strained at your time of life: did I
not know you as well as I do, I should say
that philosophy in a young and especially a
female mind, is so out of season, as to be
extremely suspicious. The pleasures which
attend on affluence are too great, and too
pleasing to youth, to be overlooked, ex∣cept
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>
when under the influence of a livelier
passion.</P>
<P>Take care, my Emily; I know the
goodness of your heart, but I also know
it's sensibility; remember that, if your situ∣ation
requires great circumspection in your
behaviour to Sir George, it requires much
greater to every other person: it is even
more delicate than marriage itself.</P>
<P>I shall expect you and Miss Fermor as

<P>I ENTREAT you, my dearest Madam,
to do me the justice to believe I see
my engagement to Sir George in as strong
a light as you can do; if there is any
change in my behaviour to him, it is owing
to the very apparent one in his conduct to
me, of which no one but myself can be a
judge. As to what you say in regard to
my contempt of affluence, I can only say
it is in my character, whether it is gene∣rally
in the female one or not.</P>
<P>Were the cruel hint you are pleased to
give just, be assured Sir George should be
the first person to whom I would declare it.
I hope however it is possible to esteem
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
merit without offending even the most sa∣cred
of all engagements.</P>
<P>A gentleman waits for this. I have only
time to say, that Miss Fermor thanks you
for your obliging invitation, and promises
she will accompany me to Montreal as soon
as the river St. Lawrence will bear car∣riages,
as the upper road is extremely in∣convenient.</P>

<P>AFTER a fortnight's snow, we have
had near as much clear blue sky
and sunshine: the snow is six feet deep, so
that we may be said to walk on our own
heads; that is, speaking <HI>en philosophe,</HI> we
occupy the space we should have done in
summer if we had done so; or, to explain
it more clearly, our heels are now where
our heads should be.</P>
<P>The scene is a little changed for the
worse: the lovely landscape is now one un∣distinguished waste of snow, only a little
diversified by the great variety of ever∣greens
in the woods: the romantic winding
path down the side of the hill to our farm,
on which we used to amuse ourselves with
<PB N="213" REF="217"/>
seeing the beaux serpentize, is now a con∣fused,
frightful, rugged precipice, which
one trembles at the idea of ascending.</P>
<P>There is something exceedingly agrea∣ble
in the whirl of the carrioles, which
fly along at the rate of twenty miles an
hour; and really hurry one out of one's
senses.</P>
<P>Our little coterie is the object of great
envy; we live just as we like, without
thinking of other people, which I am not
sure <HI>here</HI> is prudent, but it is pleasant,
which is a better thing.</P>
<P>Emily, who is the civilest creature
breathing, is for giving up her own plea∣sure
to avoid offending others, and wants
me, every time we make a carrioling-party,
to invite all the misses of Quebec to go
with us, because they seem angry at our
being happy without them: but for that
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
very reason I persist in my own way, and
consider wisely, that, though civility is due
to other people, yet there is also some ci∣vility
due to one's self.</P>
<P>I agree to visit every body, but think it
mighty absurd I must not take a ride with∣out
asking a hundred people I scarce know
to go with me: yet this is the style here;
they will neither be happy themselves, nor
let any body else. Adieu!</P>
<P><DATE>Dec. 29.</DATE></P>
<P>I will never take a beaver's word again
as long as I live: there is no supporting
this cold; the Canadians say it is seventeen
years since there has been so severe a sea∣son.
I thought beavers had been people
of more honor.</P>
<P>Adieu! I can no more: the ink freezes
as I take it from the standish to the paper,
though close to a large stove. Don't ex∣pect
<PB N="215" REF="219"/>

<P>IT is with difficulty I breathe, my dear;
the cold is so amazingly intense as al∣most
totally to stop respiration. I have
business, the business of pleasure, at Que∣bec;
but have not courage to stir from the
stove.</P>
<P>We have had five days, the severity of
which none of the natives remember to
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>
have ever seen equaled: 'tis said, the cold
is beyond all the thermometers here, tho'
intended for the climate.</P>
<P>The strongest wine freezes in a room
which has a stove in it; even brandy is
thickened to the consistence of oil: the
largest wood fire, in a wide chimney, does
not throw out it's heat a quarter of a yard.</P>
<P>I must venture to Quebec to-morrow, or
have company at home: amusements are
here necessary to life; we must be jovial,
or the blood will freeze in our veins.</P>
<P>I no longer wonder the elegant arts are
unknown here; the rigour of the climate
suspends the very powers of the understand∣ing;
what then must become of those of
the imagination? Those who expect to see
<Q>“A new Athens rising near the pole,”</Q>
<PB N="217" REF="221"/>
will find themselves extremely disappoint∣ed.
Genius will never mount high, where
the faculties of the mind are benumbed
half the year.</P>
<P>'Tis sufficient employment for the most
lively spirit here to contrive how to pre∣serve
an existence, of which there are mo∣ments
that one is hardly conscious: the
cold really sometimes brings on a sort of
stupefaction.</P>
<P>We had a million of beaux here yester∣day,
notwithstanding the severe cold: 'tis
the Canadian custom, calculated I suppose
for the climate, to visit all the ladies on
New-year's-day, who sit dressed in form
to be kissed: I assure you, however, our
kisses could not warm them; but we were
obliged, to our eternal disgrace, to call in
ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berry brandy as an auxiliary.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="222"/>
You would have died to see the men;
they look just like so many bears in their
open carrioles, all wrapped in furs from
head to foot; you see nothing of the hu∣man
form appear, but the tip of a nose.</P>
<P>They have intire coats of beaver skin,
exactly like Friday's in Robinson Crusoe,
and casques on their heads like the old
knights errant in romance; you never saw
such tremendous figures; but without this
kind of cloathing it would be impossible to
stir out at present.</P>
<P>The ladies are equally covered up, tho'
in a less unbecoming style; they have long
cloth cloaks with loose hoods, like those
worn by the market-women in the north
of England. I have one in scarlet, the
hood lined with sable, the prettiest ever
seen here, in which I assure you I look
amazingly handsome; the men think so,
<PB N="219" REF="223"/>
and call me the <HI>Little red riding-hood;</HI> a
name which becomes me as well as the
hood.</P>
<P>The Canadian ladies wear these cloaks
in India silk in summer, which, fluttering in
the wind, look really graceful on a fine
woman.</P>
<P>Besides our riding-hoods, when we go
out, we have a large buffaloe's skin under
our feet, which turns up, and wraps round
us almost to our shoulders; so that, upon
the whole, we are pretty well guarded from
the weather as well as the men.</P>
<P>Our covered carrioles too have not only
canvas windows (we dare not have glass,
because we often overturn), but cloth cur∣tains
to draw all round us; the extreme
swi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness of these carriages also, which dart
along like lightening, helps to keep one warm,
by promoting the circulation of the blood.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="224"/>
I pity the Fitz; no tiger was ever so
hard-hearted as I am this weather: the
little god has taken his flight, like the swal∣lows.
I say nothing, but cruelty is no
virtue in Canada; at least at this season.</P>
<P>I suppose Pygmalion's statue was some
frozen Canadian gentlewoman, and a sud∣den
warm day thawed her. I love to ex∣pound
ancient fables, and I think no expo∣sition
can be more natural than this.</P>
<P>Would you know what makes me chat∣ter
so this morning? Papa has made me
take some excellent <HI>liqueur;</HI> 'tis the mode
here; all the Canadian ladies take a little,
which makes them so coquet and agreable.
Certainly brandy makes a woman talk like
an angel. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Jan. 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DON'T quite agree with you, my
dear; your brother does not appear
to me to have the least scruple of that
foolish false modesty which stands in a
man's way.</P>
<P>He is extremely what the French call
<HI>awakened;</HI> he is modest, certainly; that is,
he is not a coxcomb, but he has all that
proper self-confidence which is necessary to
set his agreable qualities in full light: no∣thing
can be a stronger proof of this, than
that, wherever he is, he always takes your
attention in a moment, and this without
seeming to solicit it.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="226"/>
I am very fond of him, though he never
makes love to me, in which circumstance he
is very singular: our friendship is quite
platonic, at least on his side, for I am not
quite so sure on the other. I remember
one day in summer we were walking <HI>téte à
tête</HI> in the road to Cape Rouge, when he
wanted me to strike into a very beautiful
thicket: “Positively, Rivers,” said I, “I
will not venture with you into that
wood.” “Are you afraid of <HI>me,</HI> Bell?”
“No, but extremely of <HI>myself.</HI>”</P>
<P>I have loved him ever since a little scene
that passed here three or four months ago:
a very affecting story, of a distressed family
in our neighbourhood, was told him and
Sir George; the latter preserved all the
philosophic dignity and manly composure
of his countenance, very coldly expressed
his concern, and called another subject:
your brother changed color, his eyes glis∣tened;
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>
he took the first opportunity to leave
the room, he sought these poor people, he
found, he relieved them; which we disco∣vered
by accident a month after.</P>
<P>The weather, tho' cold beyond all that
you in England can form an idea of, is yet
mild to what it has been the last five or six
days; we are going to Quebec, to church.</P>
<P>Two o'clock.</P>
<P>Emily and I have been talking religion
all the way home: we are both mighty
good girls, as girls go in these degenerate
days; our grandmothers to be sure—but
it's folly to look back.</P>
<P>We have been saying, Lucy, that 'tis
the strangest thing in the world people
should quarrel about religion, since we un∣doubtedly
all mean the same thing; all
good minds in every religion aim at pleas∣ing
the Supreme Being; the means we take
<PB N="224" REF="228"/>
differ according to the country where we
are born, and the prejudices we imbibe
from education; a consideration which
ought to inspire us with kindness and in∣dulgence
to each other.</P>
<P>If we examine each other's sentiments
with candor, we shall find much less differ∣ence
in essentials than we imagine;
<Q><L>“Since all agree to own, at least to mean,</L>
<L>One great, one good, one general Lord of all.”</L></Q>
There is, I think, a very pretty Sunday
reflexion for you, Lucy.</P>
<P>You must know, I am extremely religious;
and for this amongst other reasons, that I
think infidelity a vice peculiarly contrary
to the native softness of woman: it is bold,
daring, masculine; and I should almost
doubt the sex of an unbeliever in petti∣coats.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="229"/>
Women are religious as they are virtu∣ous,
less from principles founded on rea∣soning
and argument, than from elegance
of mind, delicacy of moral taste, and a
certain quick perception of the beautiful
and becoming in every thing.</P>
<P>This instinct, however, for such it is, is
worth all the tedious reasonings of the men;
which is a point I flatter myself you will
not dispute with me.</P>
<P>Monday, <DATE>Jan. 5.</DATE></P>
<P>This is the first day I have ventured in an
open carriole; we have been running a
race on the snow, your brother and I against
Emily and Fitzgerald: we conquered from
Fitzgerald's complaisance to Emily. I shall
like it mightily, well wrapt up: I set off
with a crape over my face to keep off the
cold, but in three minutes it was a cake
<PB N="226" REF="230"/>
of solid ice, from my breath which froze
upon it; yet this is called a mild day, and
the sun shines in all his glory.</P>
<P>Silleri, Thursday, <DATE>Jan. 8,</DATE> midnight.</P>
<P>We are just come from the general's
assembly; much company, and we danced
till this minute; for I believe we have not
been more coming these four miles.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald is the very pink of courtesy;
he never uses his covered carriole himself,
but devotes it intirely to the ladies; it
stands at the general's door in waiting on
Thursdays: if any lady comes out before
her carriole arrives, the servants call out
mechanically, “Captain Fitzgerald's car∣riole
here, for a lady.” The Colonel is
equally gallant, but I generally lay an em∣bargo
on his: they have each of them an
extreme pretty one for themselves, or to
drive a fair lady a morning's airing, when
<PB N="227" REF="231"/>
she will allow them the honor, and the
weather is mild enough to permit it.</P>

<P>YOU mistake me extremely, Jack, as
you generally do: I have by no
means forsworn marriage: on the contrary,
though happiness is not so often found
there as I wish it was, yet I am convinced
it is to be found no where else; and, poor
as I am, I should not hesitate about trying
the experiment myself to-morrow, if I
<PB N="228" REF="232"/>
could meet with a woman to my taste, unap∣propriated,
whose ideas of the state agreed
with mine, which I allow are something
out of the common road: but I must be
certain those ideas are her own, therefore
they must arise spontaneously, and not in
complaisance to mine; for which reason, if
I could, I would endeavour to lead my mis∣tress
into the subject, and know her senti∣ments
on the manner of living in that state
before I discovered my own.</P>
<P>I must also be well convinced of her ten∣derness
before I make a declaration of mine:
she must not distinguish me because I flatter
her, but because she thinks I have merit;
those fancied passions, where gratified vanity
assumes the form of love, will not satisfy
my heart: the eyes, the air, the voice of
the woman I love, a thousand little indis∣cretions
dear to the heart, must convince
me I am beloved, before I confess I love.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="233"/>
Though sensible of the advantages of
fortune, I can be happy without it: if I
should ever be rich enough to live in the
world, no one will enjoy it with greater
gust; if not, I can with great spirit, pro∣vided
I find such a companion as I wish,
retire from it to love, content, and a cot∣tage:
by which I mean to the life of a
little country gentleman.</P>
<P>You ask me my opinion of the winter
here. If you can bear a degree of cold,
of which Europeans can form no idea, it
is far from being unpleasant; we have set∣tled
frost, and an eternal blue sky. Tra∣velling
in this country in winter is particu∣larly
agreable: the carriages are easy, and
go on the ice with an amazing velocity,
though drawn only by one horse.</P>
<P>The continual plain of snow would be
extremely fatiguing both to the eye and
imagination, were not both relieved, not
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
only by the woods in prospect, but by the
tall branches of pines with which the road
is marked out on each side, and which
form a verdant avenue agreably contrasted
with the dazzling whiteness of the snow, on
which, when the sun shines, it is almost im∣possible
to look steadily even for a moment.</P>
<P>Were it not for this method of marking
out the roads, it would be impossible to
find the way from one village to another.</P>
<P>The eternal sameness however of this
avenue is tiresome when you go far in one
road.</P>
<P>I have passed the last two months in the
most agreable manner possible, in a little
society of persons I extremely love: I feel
myself so attached to this little circle of
friends, that I have no pleasure in any other
company, and think all the time absolutely
lost that politeness forces me to spend any
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
where else. I extremely dread our party's
being dissolved, and wish the winter to last
for ever, for I am afraid the spring will di∣vide
us.</P>

<P>I BEGIN not to disrelish the winter
here; now I am used to the cold, I
don't feel it so much: as there is no busi∣ness
done here in the winter, 'tis the season
of general dissipation; amusement is the
<PB N="232" REF="236"/>
study of every body, and the pains people
take to please themselves contribute to the
general pleasure: upon the whole, I am
not sure it is not a pleasanter winter than
that of England.</P>
<P>Both our houses and our carriages are
uncommonly warm; the clear serene sky,
the dry pure air, the little parties of danc∣ing
and cards, the good tables we all keep,
the driving about on the ice, the abundance
of people we see there, for every body has
a carriole, the variety of objects new to an
European, keep the spirits in a continual
agreable hurry, that is difficult to describe,
but very pleasant to feel.</P>

written Emily a very warm letter; tender,
sentimental, and almost impatient; Mrs.
Melmoth's dictating, I will answer for it;
not at all in his own composed agreable

every body in spirits and good humor.</P>
<P>The Colonel was the soul of our enter∣tainment:
amongst his other virtues, he

<P>WE have passed a mighty stupid day;
Sir George is civil, attentive, and
dull; Emily pensive, thoughtful, and silent;
and my little self as peevish as an old maid:
nobody comes near us, not even your bro∣ther,
because we are supposed to be set∣tling
<PB N="237" REF="241"/>
preliminaries; for you must know Sir
George has graciously condescended to
change his mind, and will marry her, if she
pleases, without waiting for his mother's
letter, which resolution he has communi∣cated
to twenty people at Quebec in his
way hither; he is really extremely oblig∣ing.
I suppose the Melmoths have spirited
him up to this.</P>
<P>One o'clock.</P>
<P>Emily is strangely reserved to me; she
avoids seeing me alone, and when it hap∣pens
talks of the weather; papa is how∣ever
in her confidence: he is as strong an
advocate for this milky baronet as Mrs. Mel∣moth.</P>
<P>Ten at night.</P>
<P>All is over, Lucy; that is to say, all is
fixed: they are to be married on Monday
next at the Recollects church, and to set
off immediately for Montreal: my father
<PB N="238" REF="242"/>
has been telling me the whole plan of ope∣rations:
we go up with them, stay a fort∣night,
then all come down, and show away
till summer, when the happy pair embark
in the first ship for England.</P>
<P>Emily is really what one would call a
prudent pretty sort of woman, I did not
think it had been in her: she is certainly
right, there is danger in delay; she has a
thousand proverbs on her side; I thought
what all her fine sentiments would come
to; she should at least have waited for mam∣ma's
consent; this hurry is not quite con∣sistent
with that extreme delicacy on which
she piques herself; it looks exceedingly as
if she was afraid of losing him.</P>
<P>I don't love her half so well as I did three
days ago; I hate discrect young ladies that
marry and settle; give me an agreable
fellow and a knapsack.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="243"/>
My poor Rivers! what will become of
him when we are gone? he has neglected
every body for us.</P>
<P>As she loves the pleasures of conversation,
she will be amazingly happy in her choice;

He is to be sure a most entertaining

<P>After all, I am a little droll; I am angry
with Emily for concluding an advantageous
match with a man she does not absolutely
dislike, which all good mammas say is suffi∣cient;
and this only because it breaks in on
a little circle of friends, in whose society I
have been happy. O! self! self! I would
<PB N="240" REF="244"/>
have her hazard losing a fine fortune and a
coach and six, that I may continue my co∣terie
two or three months longer.</P>
<P>Adieu! I will write again as soon as we
are married. My next will, I suppose, be
from Montreal. I die to see your brother
and my little Fitzgerald; this man gives me
the vapours. Heavens! Lucy, what a
