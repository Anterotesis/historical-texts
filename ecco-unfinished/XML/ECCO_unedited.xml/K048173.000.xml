<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN every narrative, whether historical
or biographical, authenticity is of the
utmost consequence. Of this I have ever
been so firmly persuaded, that I inscribed
a former work to that person who was
the best judge of its truth. I need not
tell you I mean General Paoli; who,
after his great, though unsuccessful,
efforts to preserve the liberties of his
country, has found an honourable asylum
in Britain, where he has now lived many
years the object of Royal regard and pri∣vate
respect; and whom I cannot name
without expressing my very grateful sense
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
of the uniform kindness which he has
been pleased to shew me.</P>
<P>The friends of Dr. Johnson can best
judge, from internal evidence, whether
the numerous conversations which form
the most valuable part of the ensuing
pages, are correctly related. To them
therefore I wish to appeal, for the accu∣racy
of the portrait here exhibited to the
world.</P>
<P>As one of those who were intimately
acquainted with him, you have a title to
this address. You have obligingly taken
the trouble to peruse the original ma∣nuscript
of this Tour, and can vouch for
the strict fidelity of the present publica∣tion.
Your literary alliance with our
much-lamented friend, in consequence of
having undertaken to render one of his
labours more complete, by your edition
of Shakspeare, a work which I am confi∣dent
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
will not disappoint the expectations
of the publick, gives you another claim.
But I have a still more powerful induce∣ment
to prefix your name to this volume,
as it gives me an opportunity of letting
the world know that I enjoy the honour
and happiness of your friendship; and of
thus publickly testifying the sincere
regard with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE
JOURNAL
OF A
TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES,
WITH
SAMUEL JOHNSON, L. L. D.</HEAD>
<P>DR. JOHNSON has for many years given
me hopes that we should go together,
and visit the Hebrides. Martin's Account of
those islands had impressed us with a notion
that we might there contemplate a system of
life almost totally different from what we had
been accustomed to see, and, to find simplicity
and wildness, and all the circumstances of re∣mote
time or place, so near to our native great
island, was an object within the reach of reason∣able
curiosity. Dr. Johnson has said in his
journey, “that he scarcely remembered how the
wish to visit the Hebrides was excited;” but
he told me, in summer 1763, that his father
put Martin's Account into his hands when he
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
was very young, and that he was much pleased
with it. We reckoned there would be some
inconveniencies and hardships, and perhaps a
little danger; but these we were persuaded
were magnified in the imagination of every
body. When I was at Ferney, in 1764, I men∣tioned
our design to <HI>Voltaire.</HI> He looked at
me, as if I had talked of going to the North
Pole, and said, “You do not insist on my ac∣companying
you?”—“No, Sir.”—“Then I
am very willing you should go.” I was not
afraid that our curious expedition would be
prevented by such apprehensions; but I
doubted that it would not be possible to pre∣vail
on Dr. Johnson to relinquish, for some
time, the felicity of a London life, which, to a
man who can enjoy it with full intellectual re∣lish,
is apt to make existence in any narrower
sphere seem insipid or irksome. I doubted that
he would not be willing to come down from
his elevated state of philosophical dignity;
from a superiority of wisdom amongst the wise,
and of learning amongst the learned; and from
flashing his wit upon minds bright enough to
reflect it.</P>
<P>He had disappointed my expectations so long,
that I began to despair; but in spring, 1773,
he talked of coming to Scotland that year with
so much firmness, that I hoped he was at last in
earnest. I knew that, if he were once launched
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
from the metropolis, he would go forward very
well; and I got our common friends there to
assist in setting him afloat. To Mrs. <HI>Thrale</HI> in
particular, whose enchantment over him seldom
failed, I was much obliged. It was, “<HI>I'll give
thee a wind.”—“Thou art kind.</HI>”—To <HI>attract</HI>
him, we had invitations from the chiefs <HI>Mac∣donald</HI>
and <HI>Macleod;</HI> and for additional aid, I
wrote to Lord <HI>Elibank,</HI> Dr. <HI>William Robertson,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Beattie.</HI></P>
<P>To Dr. <HI>Robertson,</HI> so far as my letter con∣cerned
the present subject, I wrote as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>“OUR friend, Mr. <HI>Samuel Johnson,</HI> is in great
health and spirits; and, I do think, has a se∣rious
resolution to visit Scotland this year.
The more attraction, however, the better;
and therefore, though I know he will be
happy to meet you there, it will forward the
scheme, if, in your answer to this, your express
yourself concerning it with that power of
which you are so happily possessed, and which
may be so directed as to operate strongly
upon him.”</P>
<P>His answer to that part of my letter was quite
as I could have wished. It was written with
the address and persuasion of the historian of
America.</P>
<P>“WHEN I saw you last, you gave us some
hopes that you might prevail with Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
to make out that excursion to Scotland, with
the expectation of which we have long flat∣tered
ourselves. If he could order matters
so, as to pass some time in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> about
the close of the summer session, and then
visit some of the Highland scenes, I am con∣fident
he would be pleased with the grand
features of nature in many parts of this
country: he will meet with many persons
here who respect him, and some whom I am
persuaded he will think not unworthy of his
esteem. I wish he would make the experi∣ment.
He sometimes cracks his jokes upon
us; but he will find that we can distinguish
between the stabs of malevolence, and <HI>the
rebukes of the righteous, which are like excellent
oil,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our friend <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> who by this time had received some pretty sore rubs from Dr. Johnson, on account of the unhappy difference in their politics, upon my repeating this passage to him, exclaimed, “Oil of Vitriol!”</NOTE>, <HI>and break not the head.</HI> Offer my best
compliments to him, and assure him that I
shall be happy to have the satisfaction of see∣ing
him under my roof.”</P>
<P>To Dr. <HI>Beattie</HI> I wrote, “The chief inten∣tion
of this letter is to inform you, that I
now seriously believe Mr. <HI>Samuel Johnson</HI> will
visit <HI>Scotland</HI> this year: but I wish that every
power of attraction may be employed to se∣cure
our having so valuable an acquisition,
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
and therefore I hope you will, without delay,
write to me what I know you think, that I
may read it to the mighty sage, with proper
emphasis, before I leave London, which I
must do soon. He talks of you with the
same warmth that he did last year. We are
to see as much of <HI>Scotland</HI> as we can, in the
months of August and September. We shall
not be long of being at <HI>Marischal College</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I find is a Scotticism. I should have said, “It will not be long before we shall be at <HI>Marischal</HI> College.”</NOTE> He
is particularly desirous of seeing some of the
Western Islands.”</P>
<P>Dr. Beattie did better: <HI>ipse venit.</HI> He was,
however, so polite as to wave his privilege of
<HI>nil mihi rescribas,</HI> and wrote as follows:</P>
<P>“YOUR very kind and agreeable favour of
the 20th of April overtook me here yesterday,
after having gone to Aberdeen, which place
I left about a week ago. I am to set out
this day for London, and hope to have the
honour of paying my respects to Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>
and you, about a week or ten days hence. I
shall then do what I can, to enforce the to∣pick
you mention; but at present I cannot
enter upon it, as I am in a very great hurry;
for I intend to begin my journey within an
hour or two.”</P>
<P>He was as good as his word, and threw some
pleasing motives into the northern scale. But,
indeed, Mr. Johnson loved all that he heard,
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
from one whom he tells us, in his Lives of the
Poets, <HI>Gray</HI> found “a poet, a philosopher, and
a good man.”</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Elibank</HI> did not answer my letter to
his lordship for some time. The reason will
appear, when we come to the isle of <HI>Sky.</HI> I shall
then insert my letter, with letters from his
lordship, both to myself and Mr. <HI>Johnson.</HI> I
beg to be understood, that I insert my own
letters, as I relate my own sayings, rather as
keys to what is valuable belonging to others,
than for their own sake.</P>
<P>Luckily Mr. Justice (now Sir <HI>Robert) Chambers,</HI>
who was about to sail for the East-Indies, was
going to take leave of his relations at <HI>Newcastle</HI>
and he conducted Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> to that town.
Mr. <HI>Scott,</HI> of <HI>University College, Oxford</HI> (now
Dr. <HI>Scott,</HI> of the Commons) accompanied him
from thence to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> With such propi∣tious
convoys did he proceed to my native
city. But, lest metaphor should make it be
supposed he actually went by sea, I choose to
mention that he travelled in post-chaises, of
which the rapid motion was one of his most
favourite amusements.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Samuel Johnson's</HI> character, religious,
moral, political, and literary, nay his figure
and manner, are, I believe, more generally
known than those of almost any man; yet it
may not be superfluous here to attempt a sketch
of him. Let my readers then remember that
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
he was a sincere and zealous christian, of high-church
of England and monarchical principles,
which he would not tamely suffer to be ques∣tioned;
steady and inflexible in maintaining
the obligations of piety and virtue, both from
a regard to the order of society, and from a
veneration for the Great Source of all order;
correct, nay stern in his taste; hard to please,
and easily offended; impetuous and irritable in
his temper; but of a most humane and benevo∣lent
heart; having a mind stored with a vast and
various collection of learning and knowledge,
which he communicated with peculiar perspi∣cuity
and force, in rich and choice expression.
He united a most logical head with a most fer∣tile
imagination, which gave him an extraordi∣nary
advantage in arguing; for he could reason
close or wide, as he saw best for the moment.
He could, when he chose it, be the greatest
sophist that ever wielded a weapon in the schools
of declamation; but he indulged this only in
conversation, for he owned he sometimes talked
for victory. He was too conscientious to make
errour permanent and pernicious, by deliberate∣ly
writing it. He was conscious of his superio∣rity.
He loved praise when it was brought to
him; but was too proud to seek for it. He
was somewhat susceptible of flattery. His
mind was so full of imagery, that he might
have been perpetually a poet. It has been often
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
remarked, that in his poetical pieces, which it
is to be regretted are so few, because so excel∣lent,
his style is easier than in his prose. There
is deception in this: it is not easier, but
better suited to the dignity of verse; as one
may dance with grace, whose motions, in or∣dinary
walking—in the common step, are auk∣ward.
He had a constitutional melancholy,
the clouds of which drakened the brightness of
his fancy, and gave a gloomy cast to his whole
course of thinking: yet, though grave and
aweful in his deportment, when he thought it
necessary or proper, he frequently indulged
himself in pleasantry and sportive sallies. He
was prone to superstition, but not to credulity.
Though his imagination might incline him
to a beliet of the marvellous, and the
mysterious, his vigorous reason examined the
evidence with jealousy. He had a loud voice,
and a slow deliberate utterance, which no doubt
gave some additional weight to the sterling
metal of his conversation. Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> said
once to me at <HI>Wilton,</HI> with a happy pleasantry,
and some truth, that “Dr. <HI>Johnson's</HI> sayings
would not appear so extraordinary were it
not for his <HI>bow-wow way:</HI>” but I admit the
truth of this only on some occasions. The
<HI>Messiah,</HI> played upon the <HI>Canterbury organ,</HI> is
more sublime than when played upon an infe∣rior
instrument: but very slight music will
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
seem grand, when conveyed to the ear through
that majestic medium. <HI>While therefore Doctor
Johnson's sayings are read, let his manner be taken
along.</HI> Let it however be observed, that
the sayings themselves are generally great;
that, though he might be an ordinary composer
at times, he was for the most part a <HI>Handel.</HI> His
person was large, robust, I may say approaching
to the gigantic, and grown unwieldy from cor∣pulency.
His countenance was naturally of
the cast of an ancient statue, but somewhat dis∣figured
by the scars of that <HI>evil,</HI> which, it was
formerly imagined, the <HI>royal touch</HI> could cure.
He was now in his sixty-fourth year: he was
become a little dull of hearing. His sight had
always been somewhat weak; yet, so much does
mind govern, and even supply the deficiency
of organs, that his perceptions were uncom∣monly
quick and accurate. His head, and
sometimes also his body, shook with a kind
of motion like the effect of a palsy: he was fre∣quently
disturbed by cramps, or convulsive
contractions, of the nature of that distemper
called <HI>St. Vitus's</HI> dance. He wore a full suit of
plain brown clothes, with twisted hair buttons
of the same colour, a large bushy greyish wig,
a plain shirt, black worsted stockings, and silver
buckles. Upon this tour, when journeying,
he wore boots, and a very wide brown cloth
great coat, with pockets which might have al∣most
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
held the two volumes of his folio dictionary;
and he carried in his hand a large English oak
stick. Let me not be censured for mentioning
such minute particulars. Every thing relative
to so great a man is worth observing. I re∣member
Dr. <HI>Adam Smith,</HI> in his rhetorical lec∣tures
at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> told us he was glad to know
that <HI>Milton</HI> wore latchets in his shoes, instead of
buckles. When I mention the oak stick, it is
but letting <HI>Hercules</HI> have his club; and, by-and-by,
my readers will find this stick will bud,
and produce a good joke.</P>
<P>This imperfect sketch of “the COMBINATION
and the <HI>form</HI>” of that Wonderful Man, whom I
venerated and loved while in this world, and
after whom I gaze with humble hope, now that
it has pleased ALMIGHTY GOD to call him to a
better world, will serve to introduce to the
fancy of my readers the capital object of the
following journal, in the course of which I trust
they will attain to a considerable degree of ac∣quaintance
with him.</P>
<P>His prejudice against <HI>Scotland</HI> was announced
almost as soon as he began to appear in the
world of letters. In his <HI>London,</HI> a poem, are
the following nervous lines:</P>
<Q><L>For who would leave, unbrib'd, <HI>Hibernia</HI>'s land?</L>
<L>Or change the rocks of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Strand?</L>
<L>There none are swept by sudden fate away;</L>
<L>But all, whom hunger spares, with age decay.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17"/>
The truth is, like the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans,</HI> he allowed himself to look upon all
nations but his own as barbarians: not only
<HI>Hibernia,</HI> but <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> are at∣tacked
in the same poem. If he was particularly
prejudiced against the <HI>Scots,</HI> it was because they
were more in his way; because he thought their
success in <HI>England</HI> rather exceeded the due pro∣portion
of their real merit; and because he
could not but see in them that nationality which
I should think no liberal minded Scotsman will
deny. He was indeed, if I may be allowed the
phrase, at bottom much of a <HI>John Bull;</HI> much of
a blunt <HI>true-born Englishman.</HI> There was a
stratum of common clay under the rock of
marble. He was voraciously fond of good eat∣ing;
and he had a great deal of that quality
called <HI>humour,</HI> which gives an oiliness and a
gloss to every other quality.</P>
<P>I am, I flatter myself, compleatly a citizen of
the world.—In my travels through Holland,
Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Corsica, France,
I never felt myself from home; and I sincerely
love “every kindred and tongue, and people
and nation.” I subscribe to what my late
truly learned and philosophical friend
<HI>Crosbie</HI> said, that the English are better ani∣mals
than the Scots; they are nearer the sun;
their blood is richer, and more mellow: but
when I humour any of them in an outrageous
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
contempt of Scotland, I fairly own I treat them
as children. And thus I have, at some mo∣ments,
found myself obliged to treat even
Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>To <HI>Scotland</HI> however he ventured; and he re∣turned
from it in great good humour, with his
prejudices much lessened, and with very grate∣ful
feelings of the hospitality with which he was
treated; as is evident from that admirable
work, his “Journey to the Western Islands of
Scotland,” which, to my utter astonishment,
has been misapprehended, even to rancour, by
many of my countrymen.</P>
<P>To have the company of <HI>Chambers</HI> and <HI>Scott,</HI>
he delayed his journey so long, that the court of
session, which rises on the eleventh of August,
was broke up before he got to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>On Saturday the fourteenth of August, 1773,
late in the evening, I received a note from him,
that he was arrived at <HI>Boyd's</HI> inn, at the head
of the <HI>Canongate.</HI> I went to him directly. He
embraced me cordially; and I exulted in the
thought, that I now had him actually in <HI>Cale∣donia,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Scott's</HI> amiable manners, and at∣tachment
to our <HI>Socrates,</HI> at once united me to
him. He told me that, before I came in, the
doctor had unluckily had a bad specimen of
<HI>Scottish</HI> cleanliness. He then drank no fer∣mented
liquor. He asked to have his lemonade
made sweeter; upon which the waiter, with his
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
greasy fingers, lifted a lump of fugar, and put
it into it. The doctor, in indignation, threw
it out of the window. <HI>Scott</HI> said, he was afraid
he would have knocked the waiter down. Mr.
<HI>Johnson</HI> told me, that such another trick was
played him at the house of a lady in <HI>Paris.</HI> He
was to do me the honour to lodge under my
roof. I regretted sincerely that I had not also
a room for Mr. <HI>Scott.</HI> Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> and I
walked arm-in-arm up the High-street, to my
house in <HI>James's court:</HI> it was a dusky night: I
could not prevent his being assailed by the even∣ing
effluvia of Edinburgh. I heard a late ba∣ronet,
of some distinction in the political world
in the beginning of the present reign, observe,
that “walking the streets of Edinburgh at
night was pretty perilous, and a good deal
odoriferous.” The peril is much abated, by
the care which the magistrates have taken to
enforce the city laws against throwing foul
water from the windows; but, from the struc∣ture
of the houses in the old town, which con∣sist
of many stories, in each of which a different
family lives, and there being no covered sewers,
the odour still continues. A zealous Scotsman
would have wished Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> to be without
one of his five senses upon this occasion. As
we marched slowly along, he grumbled in my
ear, “I smell you in the dark!” But he ac∣knowledged
that the breadth of the street, and
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
the loftiness of the buildings on each side, made
a noble appearance.</P>
<P>My wife had tea ready for him, which it is
well known he delighted to drink at all hours,
particularly when sitting up late, and of which
his able defence against Mr. <HI>Jonas Hanway</HI>
should have obtained him a magnificent reward
from the East-India Company. He shewed
much complacency, upon finding that the
mistress of the house was so attentive to his sin∣gular
habit; and as no man could be more po∣lite
when he chose to be so, his address to her
was most courteous and engaging; and his
conversation soon charmed her into a forgetful∣ness
of his external appearance.</P>
<P>I did not begin to keep a regular full journal
till some days after we had set out from Edin∣burgh;
but I have luckily preserved a good
many fragments of his <HI>Memorabilia</HI> from his
very first evening in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We had, a little before this, had a trial for
murder, in which the judges had allowed the
lapse of twenty years since its commission as a
plea in bar, in conformity with the doctrine of
prescription in the <HI>civil</HI> law, which <HI>Scotland</HI> and
several other countries in <HI>Europe</HI> have adopted.
He at first disapproved of this; but then he
thought there was something in it, if there had
been for twenty years a neglect to prosecute a
crime which was <HI>known.</HI> He would not allow
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
that a murder, by not being <HI>discovered</HI> for twenty
years, should escape punishment, We talked
of the ancient trial by duel. He did not think
it so absurd as is generally supposed; “For
(said he) it was only allowed when the ques∣tion
was <HI>in equilibrio,</HI> as when one affirmed
and another denied; and they had a notion
that Providence would interfere in favour of
him who was in the right. But as it was
found that in a duel, he who was in the right
had not a better chance than he who was in
the wrong, therefore society instituted the
present mode of trial, and gave the advantage
to him who is in the right.”</P>
<P>We sat till near two in the morning, having
chatted a good while after my wife left us. She
had insisted, that to shew all respect to the Sage,
she would give up our own bed-chamber to
him and take a worse. This I cannot but
gratefully mention, as one of a thousand obli∣gations
which I owe her, since the great obli∣gation
of her being pleased to accept of me as
her husband.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>15th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Scott came to breakfast, at which I in∣troduced
to Dr. Johnson, and him, my friend
Sir <HI>William Forbes,</HI> now of <HI>Pitsligo;</HI> a man of
whom too much good cannot be said, who,
with distinguished abilities, and application in
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
his profession of a Banker, is at once a good
companion, and a good christian; which I
think is saying enough. Yet it is but justice
to record, that once, when he was in a danger∣ous
illness, he was watched with the anxious
apprehension of a general calamity; day and
night his house was beset with affectionate in∣quiries;
and, upon his recovery, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was
the universal chorus from the <HI>hearts</HI> of his
countrymen.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson was pleased with my daughter
<HI>Veronica,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The saint's name of <HI>Veronica</HI> was introduced into our family through my great grandmother <HI>Veronica,</HI> Countess of <HI>Kincardine,</HI> a Dutch lady of the noble house of <HI>Sommelsdyck,</HI> of which there is a full account in <HI>Bayle's</HI> Dictionary. The family had once a princely right in <HI>Surinam.</HI> The governour of that island was appointed by the States General, the town of Amsterdam, and Sommelsdyck. The States General have acquired Sommelsdyck's right; but the family has still great dignity and opulence, and by intermarriages is connected with many other noble families. When I was at the <HI>Hague,</HI> I was received with all the affection of kindred. The present <HI>Som∣melsdyck</HI> has an important charge in the Republick, and is as worthy a man as lives. He has honoured me with his cor∣respondence for these twenty years. My great grandfather, the husband of Countess Veronica, was <HI>Alexander</HI> Earl of <HI>Kincardine,</HI> that eminent <HI>Royalist</HI> whose character is given by <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his History of his own Times. From him the blood of <HI>Bruce</HI> flows in my veins. Of such ancestry who would not be proud? And, as <HI>Nihll est nisi hoc sciat alter,</HI> is peculiarly true of genealogy, who would not be glad to seise a fair opportunity to let it be known?</NOTE> then a child of about four months old.
She had the appearance of listening to him.
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
His motions seemed to her to be intended for
her amusement; and when he stopped, she
fluttered and made a little infantine noise, and
a kind of signal for him to begin again. She
would be held close to him; which was a proof,
from simple nature, that his figure was not
horrid. Her fondness for him endeared her
still more to me, and I declared she should have
five hundred pounds of additional fortune.</P>
<P>We talked of the practice of the law. Sir
William Forbes said, he thought an honest
lawyer should never undertake a cause which
he was satisfied was not a just one. “Sir (said
Mr. Johnson) a lawyer has no business with the
justice or injustice of the cause which he under∣takes,
unless his client asks his opinion, and
then he is bound to give it honestly. The
justice or injustice of the cause is to be decided
by the judge. Consider, Sir, what is the pur∣pose
of courts of justice? It is, that every man
may have his cause fairly tried, by men ap∣pointed
to try causes. A lawyer is not to tell
what he knows to be a lie: he is not to produce
what he knows to be a false deed; but he is
not to usurp the province of the jury and of the
judge, and determine what shall be the effect
of evidence—what shall be the result of legal
argument. As it rarely happens that a man is
fit to plead his own cause, lawyers are a class
of the community, who, by study and experi∣ence,
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
have acquired the art and power of ar∣ranging
evidence, and of applying to the points
at issue what the law has settled. A lawyer is
to do for his client all that his client might
fairly do for himself, if he could. If, by a su∣periority
of attention, of knowledge, of skill,
and a better method of communication, he has
the advantage of his adversary, it is an advan∣tage
to which he is entitled. There must al∣ways
be some advantage, on one side or other;
and it is better that advantage should be had
by talents, then by chance. If lawyers were
to undertake no causes till they were sure they
were just, a man might be precluded altogether
from a trial of his claim, though, were it judi∣cially
examined, it might be found a very just
claim.”—This was sound practical doctrine,
and rationally repressed a too refined scrupulo∣sity
of conscience.</P>
<P>Emigration was at this time a common to∣pick
of discourse. Dr. Johnson regretted it as
hurtful to human happiness: “For (said he)
it spreads mankind, which weakens the defence
of a nation, and lessens the comfort of living.
Men, thinly scattered, make a shift, but a bad
shift, without many things. A smith is ten
miles off: they'll do without a nail or a staple.
A taylor is far from them: they'll botch their
own clothes. It is being concentrated which
produces high convenience.”</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25"/>
Sir William Forbes, Mr. Scott, and I, ac∣companied
Mr. Johnson to the chapel, founded
by Lord Chief Baron Smith, for the service of
the Church of England. The Reverend Mr.
Carre, the senior clergyman, preached from
these words, “Because the Lord reigneth, let
the earth be glad.”—I was sorry to think
Mr. Johnson did not attend to the sermon, Mr.
Carre's low voice not being strong enough to
reach his hearing. A selection of Mr. Carre's
sermons has, since his death, been published
by Sir William Forbes, and the world has ac∣knowledged
their uncommon merit. I am
well assured Lord Mansfield has pronounced
them to be excellent.</P>
<P>Here I obtained a promise from Lord Chief
Baron Orde, that he would dine at my house
next day. I presented Mr. Johnson to his
Lordship, who politely said to him, “I have
not the honour of knowing you; but I hope
for it, and to see you at my house. I am to
wait on you to-morrow.” This respectable
English judge will be long remembered in
Scotland, where he built an elegant house, and
lived in it magnificently. His own ample
fortune, with the addition of his salary, enabled
him to be splendidly hospitable. It may be
fortunate for an individual amongst ourselves to
be Lord Chief Baron; and a most worthy man
now has the office. But, in my opinion, it is
better for Scotland in general, that some of our
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
publick employments should be filled by gen∣tlemen
of distinction from the south side of the
Tweed, as we have the benefit of promotion in
England. Such an interchange would make a
beneficial mixture of manners, and render our
union more complete. Lord Chief Baron Orde
was on good terms with us all, in a narrow
country filled with jarring interests and keen
parties; and, though I well knew his opinion
to be the same with my own, he kept himself
aloof at a very critical period indeed, when the
<HI>Douglas cause</HI> shook the sacred security of <HI>birth∣right</HI>
in Scotland to its foundation; a cause,
which had it happened before the Union, when
there was no appeal to a British House of
Lords, would have left the great fortress of
honours and of property in ruins.</P>
<P>When we got home, Dr. Johnson desired
to see my books. He took down Ogden's Ser∣mons
on Prayer, on which I set a very high
value, having been much edified by them, and
he retired with them to his room. He did not
stay long, but soon joined us in the drawing∣room.
I presented to him Mr. Robert Ar∣buthnot,
a relation of the celebrated Dr. Ar∣buthnot,
and a man of literature and taste.
To him we were obliged for a previous recom∣mendation,
which secured us a very agreeable
reception at St. Andrew's, and which Dr. John∣son,
in his Journey, ascribes to “some invisible
friend.”</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27"/>
Of Dr. Beattie, Mr. Johnson said, “Sir, he
has written like a man conscious of the truth,
and feeling his own strength. Treating your
adversary with respect, is giving him an advan∣tage
to which he is not entitled. The greatest
part of men cannot judge of reasoning, and are
impressed by character; so that, if you allow your
adversary a respectable character, they will think,
that though you differ from him, you may be
in the wrong. Sir, treating your adversary with
respect, is striking soft in a battle. And as to
<HI>Hume</HI>—a man who has so much conceit as to
tell all mankind that they have been bubbled
for ages, and he is the wise man who sees better
than they—a man who has so little scrupulosity
as to venture to oppose those principles which
have been thought necessary to human happi∣ness
—is he to be surprised if another man comes
and laughs at him? If he is the great man he
thinks himself, all this cannot hurt him: it is
like throwing peas against a rock.” He added
“<HI>something much too rough,</HI>” both as to Mr.
Hume's head and heart, which I suppress.
Violence is, in my opinion, not suitable to the
Christian cause. Besides, I always lived on
good terms with Mr. Hume, though I have
frankly told him, I was not clear that it was
right in me to keep company with him. “But
(said I) how much better are you than your
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
books!” He was cheerful, obliging, and in∣structive;
he was charitable to the poor; and
many an agreeable hour have I passed with him.
I have preserved some entertaining and inte∣resting
memoirs of him, particularly when he
knew himself to be dying, which I may some
time or other communicate to the world. I
shall not, however, extol him so very highly as
Dr. <HI>Adam Smith</HI> does, who says, in a letter to
Mr. <HI>Strahan</HI> the Printer (not a confidential
letter to his friend, but a letter which is pub∣lished
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter, though shattered by the sharp shot of Dr. <HI>Horne</HI> of <HI>Oxford's</HI> wit, in the character of “One of the People called Christians,” is still prefixed to Mr. Hume's excellent His∣tory of England, like a poor invalid on the piquet guard, or like a list of quack medicines sold by the same bookseller, by whom a work of whatever nature is published; for it has no connection with his <HI>History,</HI> let it have what it may with what are called his <HI>Philosophical</HI> Works. A worthy friend of mine in London was lately consulted by a lady of quality, of most distinguished merit, what was the best History of England for her son to read. My friend recommended Hume's. But, upon recollecting that its usher was a superlative panegyrick on one, who endeavoured to sap the credit of our holy reli∣gion, he repented. I am really sorry for this ostentatious <HI>alliance;</HI> because I admire “The Theory of Moral Sentiments” and value the greatest part of “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.” Why should such a writer be so forgetful of human comfort, as to give any countenance to that dreary infidelity which would “make us poor indeed!”</NOTE> with all formality): “Upon the whole,
I have always considered him, both in his
life-time, and since his death, as approaching
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and
virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human
frailty will permit.” Let Dr. Smith consider:
Was not Mr. Hume blest with good health,
good spirits, good friends, a competent and
increasing fortune? And had he not also a
perpetual feast of fame? But, as a learned
friend has observed to me, “What trials did he
undergo, to prove the perfection of his virtue?”
Did he ever experience any great instance of
adversity?“—When I read this sentence, deli∣vered
by my old <HI>Professor of Moral Philosophy,</HI>
I could not help exclaiming with the <HI>Psalmist.</HI>
“Surely I have now more understanding than
my teachers!”</P>
<P>While we were talking, there came a note
to me from Dr. William Robertson.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have been expecting every day to hear
from you, of Dr. Johnson's arrival. Pray
what do you know about his motions? I
long to take him by the hand. I write this
from the college, where I have only this
scrap of paper. Ever your's,</P>
<CLOSER>Sunday.
<SIGNED>W. R.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>It pleased me to find Dr. Robertson thus
eager to meet Dr. Johnson. I was glad I could
answer, that he was come: and I begged Dr.
Robertson might be with us as soon as he
could.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30"/>
Sir William Forbes, Mr. Scott, Mr. Arbuth∣not,
and another gentleman, dined with us.
“Come, Dr. Johnson, (said I) it is commonly
thought that our veal in Scotland is not good.
But here is some which I believe you will
like.”—There was no catching him.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Why, Sir what is commonly thought, I
should take to be true. <HI>Your</HI> veal may be
good; but that will only be an exception to the
general opinion; not a proof against it.”</P>
<P>Dr. Robertson, according to the custom of
Edinburgh at that time, dined in the interval
between the forenoon and afternoon service,
which was then later than now; so we had not
the pleasure of his company till dinner was over,
when he came and drank wine with us. And
then began some animated dialogue, of which
here follows a pretty full note.</P>
<P>We talked of Mr. Burke.—Dr. Johnson
said, he had great variety of knowledge, store
of imagery, copiousness of language.—<HI>Ro∣bertson.</HI>
“He has wit too.”—<HI>Johnson,</HI> “No,
Sir; he never succeeds there. 'Tis low; 'tis
conceit. I used to say, Burke never once
made a good joke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This was one of the points upon which Dr. Johnson was strangely heterodox. For, surely, Mr. Burke, with his other remarkable qualities, is also distinguished for his wit, and for wit of all kinds too; not merely that power of lan∣guage which Pope chuses to denominate wit,
<Q><L>(True wit is Nature to advantage drest;</L>
<L>What oft was thought, but ne'er so well exprest.)</L></Q>
but surprising allusions, brilliant sallies of vivacity, and plea∣sant conceits. His speeches in parliament are strewed with them. Take, for instance, the variety which he has given in his wide range, yet exact detail, when exhibiting his Reform Bill. And his conversation abounds in wit. Let me put down a specimen.—I told him, I had seen, at a <HI>Blue-stocking</HI> assem∣bly, a number of ladies sitting round a worthy and tall friend of ours, listening to his literature. “Aye (said he) like maids round a May-pole.”—I told him, I had found out a perfect definition of human nature, as distinguished from the animal. An ancient philosopher said, Man was “a two∣legged animal without feathers”—upon which his rival Sage had a Cock plucked bare, and set him down in the school be∣fore all the disciples, as a “Philosophic Man.” Dr. Franklin said, Man was “a tool-making animal,” which is very well; for, no animal but man makes a thing, by means of which he can make another thing. But this applies to very few of the species. My definition of <HI>Man</HI> is, “a Cooking Animal.” The beasts have memory, judgement, and all the faculties and passions of our mind, in a certain degree; but no beast is a cook. The trick of the monkey using the cat's paw to roast a chestnut, is only a piece of shrewd malice in that <HI>turpissima bestia,</HI> which humbles us so sadly by its similarity to us. Man alone can dress a good dish; and every man whatever is more or less a cook, in seasoning what he himself eats.—Your defi∣nition is good, said Mr. Burke, and I now see the full force of the common proverb, “There is <HI>reason</HI> in roasting of eggs.”—When Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> in his days of tumultuous opposition, was bor'n upon the shoulders of the mob, Mr. Burke (as Mr. Wilkes told me himself, with classical admiration) applied to him what <HI>Horace</HI> says of <HI>Pindar,</HI></P>
<Q><L>—<HI>Numerisque</HI> fertur</L>
<L>LEGE <HI>solutis.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Sir Joshua Reynolds, who agrees with me entirely as to Mr. Burke's fertility of wit, said, that this was “dignifying a pun.” He also observed, that he has often heard Burke say, in the course of an evening, ten good things, each of which would have served a noted wit (whom he named) to live upon for a twelvementh.</P></NOTE>. What I most envy Burke
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
for, is, his being constantly the same. He is
never what we call hum-drum; never unwil∣ling
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
to begin to talk, nor in a haste to leave
off.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Yet he can listen.”—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“No; I cannot say he is good at that. So
desirous is he to talk, that, if one is speaking at
this end of the table, he'll speak to somebody
at the other end. Burke, Sir, is such a man,
that if you met him for the first time in a street
where you were stopped by a drove of oxen, and
you and he stepped aside to take shelter but for
five minutes, he'd talk to you in such a manner,
that, when you parted, you would say, this
is an extraordinary man. Now, you may
be long enough with me, without finding any
thing extraordinary.” He said, he believed
Burke was intended for the law; but either had
not money enough to follow it, or had not di∣ligence
enough. He said, he could not under∣stand
how a man could apply to one thing, and
not to another. <HI>Robertson</HI> said, one man had
more judgement, another more imagination.
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir; it is only one man has
more mind than another. He may direct it
differently; he may, by accident, see the suc∣cess
of one kind of study, and take a desire to
excel in it. I am persuaded that, had Sir Isaac
Newton applied to poetry, he would have made
a very fine epic poem. I could as easily apply
to law as to tragick poetry.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Yet,
Sir, you did apply to tragick poetry, not to
law.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Because, Sir, I had not mo∣ney
to study law. Sir, the man who has vigour
may walk to the east, just as well as to the west,
if he happens to turn his head that way.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But, Sir, 'tis like walking up and down
a hill; one man will naturally do the one better
than the other. A hare will run up a hill best,
from her legs being short; a dog down.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, Sir; that is from mechanical
powers. If you make mind mechanical, you
may argue in that manner. One mind is a vice,
and holds fast; there's a good memory. Ano∣ther
is a file; and he is a disputant, a contro∣versialist.
Another is a razor; and he is sar∣castical.”
—We talked of <HI>Whitefield.</HI> He said,
he was at the same college with him, and knew
him <HI>before he began to be better than other
people</HI> (smiling); that he believed he sincerely
meant well, but had a mixture of politicks and
ostentation: whereas <HI>Wesley</HI> thought of religion
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That cannot be said now, after the flagrant part which Mr. <HI>John Wesley</HI> took against our American bretheren, when, in his own name, he threw amongst his enthusiastick flock, the very individual combustibles of Dr. <HI>Johnson's</HI> “Taxation no Tyranny;” and after the intolerant spirit which he mani∣fested against our fellow christians of the Roman Catholick Communion, for which that able champion, Father <HI>O'Leary,</HI> has given him so hearty a drubbing. But I should think my∣self very unworthy, if I did not at the same time acknowledge Mr. John Wesley's merit, as a veteran “Soldier of Jesus Christ,” who has, I do believe, “turned many from dark∣ness into light, and from the power of <HI>Satan</HI> to the living GOD.”</NOTE>.—<HI>Robertson</HI> said, Whitefield had strong
natural eloquence, which, if cultivated, would
have done great things.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir,
I take it he was at the height of what his abili∣ties
could do, and was sensible of it. He had
the ordinary advantages of education; but he
chose to pursue that oratory which is for the
mob.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “He had great effect on the
passions.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir? I don't think
so. He could not represent a succession of pa∣thetick
images. He vociferated, and made an
impression. <HI>There,</HI> again, was a mind like a
hammer.”—Dr. Johnson now said, a certain
eminent political friend of our's was wrong, in
his maxim of sticking to a certain set of <HI>men</HI> on
all occasions. “I can see that a man may do
right to stick to a <HI>party</HI> (said he); that is to say,
he is a <HI>Whig,</HI> or he is a <HI>Tory,</HI> and he thinks one
of those parties upon the whole the best, and
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
that, to make it prevail, it must be generally
supported, though, in particulars, it may be
wrong. He takes its faggot of principles,
in which there are fewer rotten sticks than in
the other, though some rotten sticks to be sure;
and they cannot well be separated. But, to
bind one's self to one man, or one set of men,
(who may be right to-day and wrong to-morrow)
without any general preference of system, I
must disapprove<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If due attention were paid to this observation, there would be more virtue, even in politicks. What Dr. Johnson justly condemned, has, I am sorry to say, greatly increased in the present reign. At the distance of four years from this con∣versation, 21st February 1777, My Lord Archbishop of York, in his “sermon before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,” thus indignantly describes the then state of parties:</P>
<P>“Parties once had a <HI>principle</HI> belonging to them, absurd perhaps, and indefensible, but still carrying a notion of <HI>duty,</HI>” by which honest minds might easily be caught.</P>
<P>“But they are now <HI>combinations of individuals,</HI> who, in stead of being the sons and servants of the community, make a league for advancing their <HI>private interests.</HI> It is their business to hold high the notion of <HI>political honour.</HI> I believe and trust, it is not injurious to say, that such a bond is no better than that by which the lowest and wickedest combinations are held together; and that it denotes the last stage of political depravity.”</P>
<P>To find a thought, which just shewed itself to us from the mind of <HI>Johnson,</HI> thus appearing again at such a distance of time, and without any communication between them, enlarged to full growth in the mind of <HI>Markham,</HI> is a curious object of philosophical contemplation.—That two such great and lumi∣nous minds should have been so dark in one corner,—that <HI>they</HI> should have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld it to be “wicked Rebellion” in the British subjects established in America, to resist the abject condition of holding all their property at the mercy of British subjects remaining at home, while their allegiance to our common Lord the King was to be preserved inviolate,—is a striking proof to me, either that “He who sitteth in Heaven,” scorns the loftiness of human pride,—or that the evil spirit, whose personal existence I strongly believe, and even in this age am confirmed in that belief by a <HI>Fell,</HI> nay, by a <HI>Hurd,</HI> has more power than some choose to allow.</P></NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="36"/>
He told us of Cooke, who translated Hesiod,
and lived twenty years on a translation of
Plautus, for which he was always taking sub∣scriptions;
and that he presented Foote to a
Club, in the following singular manner:
“This is the nephew of the gentleman who
was lately hung in chains for murdering his
brother.”</P>
<P>In the evening I introduced to Mr. Johnson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be observed, that I sometimes call my great friend, <HI>Mr.</HI> Johnson, sometimes <HI>Dr.</HI> Johnson; though he had at this time a doctor's degree from Trinity College, Dublin. The University of Oxford afterwards conferred it upon him by a diploma, in very honourable terms. It was some time be∣fore I could bring myself to call him Doctor; but, as he has been long known by that title, I shall give it to him in the rest of this Journal.</NOTE>
two good friends of mine, Mr. William
Nairne, Advocate, and Mr. Hamilton of Sun∣drum,
my neighbour in the country, both of
whom supped with us. I have preserved no∣thing
of what passed, except that Dr. Johnson
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
displayed another of his heterodox opinions—a
contempt of tragick acting. He said, “the
action of all players in tragedy is bad. It
should be a man's study to repress those signs
of emotion and passion, as they are called.” He
was of a direct contrary opinion to that of
<HI>Fielding,</HI> in his <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> who makes <HI>Partridge</HI>
say, of <HI>Garrick,</HI> “why I could act as well as
he myself. I am sure, if I had seen a ghost,
I should have looked in the very same man∣ner,
and done just as he did.” For, when
I asked him, “Would not you, Sir, start
as Mr. Garrick does, if you saw a ghost?”
He answered, “I hope not. If I did, I should
frighten the ghost.”</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>16th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. William Robertson came to breakfast.
We talked of <HI>Ogden</HI> on Prayer. Dr. Johnson
said, “The same arguments which are used
against GOD'S hearing prayer, will serve against
his rewarding good, and punishing evil. He
has resolved, he has declared, in the former
case as in the latter.” He had last night looked
into Lord <HI>Hailes's</HI> “Remarks on the History of
Scotland.” Dr. Robertson and I said, it was
a pity Lord Hailes did not write greater things.
His lordship had not then published his “An∣nals
of Scotland.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I remember
I was once on a visit at the house of a lady for”
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
whom I had a high respect. There was a good
deal of company in the room. When they were
gone, I said to this lady, “What foolish talk∣ing
have we had!”—“Yes, (said she) but
while they talked, you said nothing.”—“I was
struck with the reproof. How much better is
the man who does any thing that is innocent,
than he who does nothing. Besides, I love
anecdotes. I fancy mankind may come, in
time, to write all aphoristically, except in nar∣rative;
grow weary of preparation, and con∣nection,
and illustration, and all those arts by
which a big book is made.—If a man is to wait
till he weaves anecdotes into a system, we may
be long in getting them, and get but few, in
comparison of what we might get.”</P>
<P>Dr. Robertson said, the notions of <HI>Euphant
Macallan,</HI> a fanatick woman, of whom Lord
Hailes gives a sketch, were still prevalent a∣mong
some of the Presbyterians; and therefore
it was right in Lord Hailes, a man of known
piety, to undeceive them.</P>
<P>We walked out, that Dr. Johnson might see
some of the things which we have to shew at
Edinburgh. We went to the <HI>Parliament House,</HI>
where the Parliament of Scotland sat, and
where the <HI>Ordinary Lords</HI> of Session hold their
courts; and to the <HI>New Session House</HI> adjoining
to it, where our Court of <HI>Fifteen</HI> (the fourteen
<HI>Ordinaries,</HI> with the Lord President at their
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
head) sit as a Court of Review. We went to
the <HI>Advocates Library,</HI> of which Dr. Johnson
took a cursory view, and then to what is called
the <HI>Laigh</HI> (or under) Parliament House, where
the records of Scotland, which has an universal
security by register, are deposited, till the great
Register Office be finished. I loved to behold
Dr. Samuel Johnson rolling about in this old
magazine of antiquities. There was, by this
time, a pretty numerous circle of us attending
upon him. Somebody talked of happy moments
for composition; and how a man can write at
one time, and not at another.—“Nay (said
Dr. Johnson) a man may write at any time, if
he will set himself doggedly to it.”</P>
<P>I here began to indulge <HI>old Scottish</HI> senti∣ments,
and to express a warm regret, that, by
our Union with <HI>England,</HI> we were no more;—
our independent kingdom was lost.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Sir, never talk of your independency, who
could let your Queen remain twenty years in
captivity, and then be put to death, without
even a pretence of justice, without your ever at∣tempting
to rescue her; and such a Queen too!
as every man of any gallantry of spirit would
have sacrificed his life for.”—<HI>Worthy Mr.
James Kerr, Keeper of the Records.</HI> “Half our
nation was bribed by <HI>English</HI> money.”—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“Sir, that is no defence. That makes
you worse.”—<HI>Good Mr. Brown, Keeper of the
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
Advocates Library.</HI> “We had better say nothing
about it.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “You would have been
glad, however, to have had us last war, Sir, to
fight your battles!”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “We should
have had you for the same price, though there
had been no union, as we might have had Swiss,
or other troops. No, no, I shall agree to a se∣paration.
You have only to <HI>go home.</HI>”—Just
as he had said this, I, to divert the subject,
shewed him the signed assurances of the three
successive Kings of the Hanover family, to
maintain the Presbyterian establishment in
Scotland.—“We'll give you that into the bar∣gain,”
said he.</P>
<P>We next went to the great church of St.
Giles, which has lost its original magnificence
in the inside, by being divided into four places
of Presbyterian worship. “Come (said Dr.
Johnson jocularly to Principal Robertson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have hitherto called him Dr. William Robertson, to distinguish him from Dr. James Robertson, who is soon to make his appearance. But <HI>Principal,</HI> from his being the head of our college, is his usual designation, and is shorter; so I shall use it in time coming.</NOTE>) let
me see what was once a church!” We entered
that division which was formerly called the <HI>New
Church,</HI> and of late the <HI>High Church,</HI> so well
known by the eloquence of Dr. <HI>Hugh Blair.</HI> It
is now very elegantly fitted up; but it was then
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
shamefully dirty. Dr. Johnson said nothing at
the time; but when we came to the great door
of the Royal Infirmary, where, upon a board,
was this inscription, “<HI>Clean your feet!</HI>” he
turned about slyly, and said, “There is no oc∣casion
for putting this at the doors of your
churches!”</P>
<P>We then conducted him down the Post-house
stairs, Parliament-close, and made him look up
from the Cow-gate to the highest building in
Edinburgh (from which he had just descended)
being thirteen floors or stories from the ground
upon the back elevation; the front wall being
built upon the edge of the hill, and the back wall
rising from the bottom of the hill several stories
before it comes to a level with the front wall.
We proceeded to the College, with the Princi∣pal
at our head. Dr. Adam Fergusson, whose
“Essay on the History of civil Society,” gives
him a respectable place in the ranks of litera∣ture,
was with us. As the College buildings
are indeed very mean, the Principal said to
Dr. Johnson, that he must give them the same
epithet that a Jesuit did when shewing a poor
college abroad: “<HI>hae miseriae nostrae.</HI>” Dr.
Johnson was, however, much pleased with the
library, and with the conversation of Dr. James
Robertson, Professor of Oriental Languages,
the Librarian. We talked of <HI>Kennicot's</HI> Tran∣slation
of the Bible, and hoped it would be
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
quite faithful.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I know not
any crime so great that a man could contrive
to commit, as poisoning the sources of eternal
truth.”</P>
<P>I pointed out to him where there formerly
stood an old wall enclosing part of the college,
which I remember bulged out in a threatening
manner, and of which there was a common
saying, as of <HI>Bacon's</HI> Study at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that it
would fall upon the most learned man. It had
some time before this been taken down, that
the street might be widened, and a more con∣venient
wall built. Mr. Johnson, glad of an
opportunity to have a pleasant hit at Scottish
learning, said, “they have been afraid it never
would fall.”</P>
<P>We shewed him the Royal Infirmary, for
which, and for every other exertion of generous
publick spirit in his power, that noble-minded
citizen of Edinburgh, <HI>George Drummond,</HI>
will be ever held in honourable remembrance.
And we were too proud not to carry him to
the Abbey of <HI>Holyrood-house,</HI> that beautiful
piece of architecture, but, alas! that deserted
mansion of royalty, which <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Bangour,</HI>
in one of his elegant poems, calls</P>
<Q><L>“A virtuous palace, where no monarch dwells.”</L></Q>
<P>I was much entertained while Principal
Robertson fluently harangued to Dr. Johnson,
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
upon the spot, concerning scenes of his cele∣brated
History of Scotland. We surveyed that
part of the palace appropriated to the Duke of
Hamilton, as Keeper, in which our beautiful
Queen Mary lived, and in which <HI>David Rizzio</HI>
was murdered; and also the State Rooms. Dr.
Johnson was a great reciter of all sorts of things
serious or comical. I over heard him repeat∣ing
here, in a kind of muttering tone, a line of
the old ballad, <HI>Johnny Armstrong's Last Good-Night:</HI></P>
<Q><L>“And ran him through the fair body!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>The stanza from which he took this line is,</L>
<L>“But then rose up all Edinburgh,</L>
<L>They rose up by thousands three;</L>
<L>A cowardly Scot came John behind,</L>
<L>And ran him through the fair body!”</L></Q></NOTE>”</L></Q>
<P>I suppose his thinking of the stabbing of <HI>Rizzio</HI>
had brought this into his mind, by association
of ideas.</P>
<P>We returned to my house, where there met
him, at dinner, the Duchess of Douglas, Sir
Adolphus Oughton, Lord Chief Baron, Sir Wil∣liam
Forbes, Principal Robertson, Mr. Cullen,
advocate. Before dinner, he told us of a cu∣rious
conversation between the famous <HI>George
Faulkner</HI> and him. George said that England
had drained Ireland of fifty thousand pounds in
specie, annually, for fifty years. “How so,
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
Sir! (said Dr. Johnson) you must have a very
great trade?” “No trade.”—“Very rich
mines?” “No mines.”—“From whence,
then, does all this money come?” “Come!
why out of the blood and bowels of the poor
people of Ireland!”</P>
<P>He seemed to me to have an unaccountable
prejudice against <HI>Swift;</HI> for I once took the
liberty to ask him, if Swift had personally of∣fended
him, and he told me, he had not. He
said to-day, Swift is clear, but he is shallow.
In coarse humour, he is inferiour to Arbuthnot;
in delicate humour, he is inferiour to Addison:
So he is inferiour to his contemporaries; without
putting him against the whole world. I doubt
if the “Tale of a Tub” was his; it has so much
more thinking, more knowledge, more power,
more colour, than any of the works which are
indisputably his. If it was his, I shall only
say, He was <HI>impar sibi.</HI>”</P>
<P>We gave him as good a dinner as we could.
Our Scots muir-fowl, or growse, were then
abundant, and quite in season; and, so far as
wisdom and wit can be aided by administering
agreeable sensations to the palate, my wife took
care that our great guest should not be defi∣cient.</P>
<P>Sir Adolphus Oughton, then our Deputy
Commander in Chief, who was not only an ex∣cellent
officer, but one of the most universal
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
scholars I ever knew, had learnt the Erse lan∣guage,
and expressed his belief in the authenti∣city
of Ossian's Poetry. Dr. Johnson took the
opposite side of that perplexed question; and I
was afraid the dispute would have run high
between them. But Sir Adolphus, who had a
charming sweet temper, changed the discourse,
grew playful, laughed at Lord <HI>Monboddo's</HI> no∣tion
of men having tails, and called him a
Judge <HI>à posteriori,</HI> which amused Dr. Johnson;
and thus hostilities were prevented.</P>
<P>At supper we had Dr. Cullen, his son the ad∣vocate,
Dr. Adam Fergusson, Mr. Crosbie, ad∣vocate.
Witchcraft was introduced. <HI>Crosbie</HI>
said, he thought it the greatest blasphemy to
suppose evil spirits counteracting the Deity,
and raising storms, for instance, to destroy his
creatures.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir, if moral evil
be consistent with the government of the Deity,
why may not physical evil be also consistent
with it? It is not more strange that there should
be evil spirits, than evil men; evil unembodied
spirits, than evil embodied spirits. And as to
storms, we know there are such things; and it
is no worse that evil spirits raise them, than
that they rise.”—<HI>Crosbie.</HI>“But it is not cre∣dible,
that such stories as we are told of witches
have happened.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir,” I am not de∣fending
their credibility. I am only saying,
that your arguments are not good, and will not
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
overturn the belief of witchcraft.—(Dr. Fer∣gusson
said to me, aside, “He is right.”)—
And then, Sir you have all mankind, rude and
civilised, agreeing in the belief of the agency
of preternatural powers. You must take evi∣dence:
you must consider, that wise and great
men have condemned witches to die.▪—
<HI>Crosbie.</HI> “But an act of parliament put an end
to witchcraft.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir! witch∣craft
had ceased; and therefore an act of par∣liament
was passed to prevent persecution for
what was not witchcraft. Why it ceased, we
cannot tell, as we cannot tell the reason of many
other things.”—Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI> to keep up the gra∣tification
of mysterious disquisition, with the
grave address for which he is remarkable in his
companionable as in his professional hours,
talked, in a very entertaining manner, of people
walking and conversing in their sleep. I am
very sorry I have no note of this. We talked
of the <HI>Ouran-Outang,</HI> and of Lord Monboddo's
thinking that he might be taught to speak.
Dr. Johnson treated this with ridicule. Mr.
<HI>Crosbie</HI> said, that Lord Monboddo believed the
existence of every thing possible; in short,
that all which is in <HI>posse</HI> might be found in <HI>esse.</HI>
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “But, Sir, it is as possible that the
<HI>Ouran Outang</HI> does not speak, as that he speaks.
However, I shall not contest the point. I
should have thought it not possible to find a
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
Monboddo; yet <HI>he</HI> exists.”—I again mentioned
the stage.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “The appearance of a
Player, with whom I have drank tea, counter-acts
the imagination that he is the character he
represents. Nay, you know nobody imagines
that he is the character he represents. They
say, “See <HI>Garrick!</HI> how he looks to-night!
See how he'll clutch the dagger!” That is
the buz of the theatre.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday <DATE>17th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Sir William Forbes came to breakfast, and
brought with him Dr. <HI>Blacklock,</HI> whom he in∣troduced
to Dr. Johnson, who received him
with a most humane complacency, “Dear Dr.
Blacklock, I am glad to see you!”—Blacklock
seemed to be much surprized, when Dr. John∣son
said, “it was easier to him to write poetry
than to compose his Dictionary. His mind was
less on the stretch in doing the one than the
other. Besides, composing a Dictionary re∣quires
books and a desk. You can make a
poem walking in the fields, or lying in bed.”—
Dr. <HI>Blacklock</HI> spoke of scepticism in morals and
religion, with apparent uneasiness, as if he
wished for more certainty. Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> who had
thought it all over, and whose vigorous under∣standing
was fortified by much experience, thus
encouraged the blind Bard to apply to higher
speculations, what we all willingly submit to in
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
common life. In short, he gave him more fa∣miliarly
the able and fair reasoning of <HI>Butler's
Analogy:</HI> “Why, Sir, the greatest concern we
have in this world, the choice of our profession,
must be determined without demonstrative
reasoning. Human life is not yet so well
known, as that we can have it. And take the
case of a man who is ill. I call two physicians:
they differ in opinion. I am not to lye down,
and die between them: I must do something.”
—The conversation then turned on Atheism;
on that horrible book <HI>Systéme de la Nature;</HI> and
on the supposition of an eternal necessity, with∣out
design, without a governing mind.—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“If it were so, why has it ceased? Why
don't we see men thus produced around us now?
Why, at least, does it not keep pace, in some
measure, with the progress of time? If it stops
because there is now no need of it, then it is
plain there is, and ever has been, an all-power∣ful
intelligence. But stay! (said he, with one of
his satyrick laughs). Ha! ha! ha! I shall
suppose Scotchmen made necessarily, and En∣glishmen
by choice.”</P>
<P>At dinner this day, we had Sir Alexander
Dick, whose amiable character, and ingenious
and cultivated mind, is so generally known
(he was then on the verge of seventy, and is
now eighty-one, with his faculties entire, his
heart warm, and his temper gay); Sir David
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
Dalrymple Lord Hailes; Mr. Maclaurin,
advocate; Dr. Gregory, who now worthily fills
his father's medical chair; and my uncle, Dr.
Boswell. This was one of Dr. Johnson's best
days. He was quite in his element. All was
literature and taste, without any interruption.
Lord <HI>Hailes,</HI> who is one of the best philologists
in Great-Britain, who has written papers in the
<HI>World,</HI> and a variety of other works in prose
and in verse, both Latin and English, pleased
him highly. He told him, he had discovered
the Life of <HI>Cheynel,</HI> in the <HI>Student,</HI> to be his.—
<HI>Johnson,</HI> “No one else knows it.”—Dr. Johnson
had, before this, dictated to me a law-paper,
upon a question purely in the law of Scotland,
concerning <HI>vicious intromission,</HI> that is to say, in∣termeddling
with the effects of a deceased person,
without a regular title, which formerly was
understood to subject the intermeddler in pay∣ment
of all the defunct's debts. The principle
has of late been relaxed. Dr. Johnson's argu∣ment
was, for a renewal of its strictness. The
paper was printed, with additions by me, and
given into the Court of Session. Lord Hailes
knew Dr. Johnson's part not to be mine, and
pointed out exactly where it began, and where
it ended. Dr. Johnson said, “It is much, now,
that his lordship can distinguish so.”</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"/>
In Dr. Johnson's “<HI>Vanity of Human Wishes,</HI>”
there is the following passage:</P>
<Q><L>“The teeming mother, anxious for her race,</L>
<L>Begs, for each birth, the fortune of a face:</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Vane</HI> could tell, what ills from Beauty spring;</L>
<L>And <HI>Sedley</HI> cursed the charms which pleased a king.”</L></Q>
<P>Lord Hailes told him he was mistaken, in
the instances he had given of unfortunate fair
ones; for neither <HI>Vane</HI> nor <HI>Sedley</HI> had a title to
that description. His lordship has since been
so obliging as to send me a note of this, for the
communication of which I am sure my readers
will thank me.</P>
<P>“The lines in the tenth Satire of Juvenal,
according to my alteration, should have run
thus:”</P>
<Q><L>“Yet <HI>Shore</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mistress of Edward IV.</NOTE> could tell.”</L>
<L>“And <HI>Valiere</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mistress of Louis XIV.</NOTE> cursed.”</L></Q>
<P>“The first was a penitent by compulsion, the
second by sentiment; though the truth is,
Mademoiselle de la Valiere threw herself (but
still from sentiment) in the King's way.”</P>
<P>“Our friend chose <HI>Vane,</HI> who was far from
being well-looked; and <HI>Sedley,</HI> who was so
ugly, that Charles II. said his brother had her
by way of penance.”</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"/>
Mr. Maclaurin's learning and talents enabled
him to do his part very well in Dr. Johnson's
company. He produced two epitaphs upon his
father, the celebrated mathematician. One in
English, of which Dr. Johnson did not change
one word. In the other, which was in Latin,
he made several alterations. In place of the
very words of <HI>Virgil, “Ubi luctus et pavor et
plurima mortis imago,</HI>” he wrote “<HI>Ubi luctus
regnant et pavor.</HI>” He introduced the word
<HI>prorsus</HI> into the line “<HI>Mortalibus prorsus non
absit solatium;</HI>” and after “<HI>Hujus enim scripto
evolve,</HI>” he added, “<HI>Mentemque tantarum rerum
capacem corpori caduco superstitem crede,</HI>” which
is quite applicable to Dr. Johnson himself.</P>
<P>Mr. Murray, advocate, who married a niece
of Lord Mansfield's, and is now one of the
Judges of Scotland, by the title of Lord <HI>Hen∣derland,</HI>
sat with us a part of the evening; but
did not venture to say any thing, that I re∣member,
which he certainly might have done,
had not an over anxiety prevented him.</P>
<P>At supper we had Dr. Alexander Webster,
who, though not learned, had such a know∣ledge
of mankind, such a fund of information
and entertainment, so clear a head and such ac∣commodating
manners, that Dr. Johnson
found him a very agreeable companion.</P>
<P>When Dr. Johnson and I were left by our∣selves,
I read to him my notes of the Opinions
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
of our Judges upon the Question of Literary
Property. He did not like them; and said,
“they make me think of your Judges not with
that respect which I should wish to do.” To
the argument of one of them, that there can be
no property in blasphemy or nonsense, he an∣swered,
“then your rotten sheep are mine!—
By that rule, when a man's house falls into de∣cay,
he must lose it.”—I mentioned an argu∣ment
of mine, that literary performances are
not taxed. As <HI>Churchill</HI> says,
<Q><L>“No statesman yet has thought it worth his pains</L>
<L>To tax our labours, or excise our brains.”</L></Q>
and therefore they are not property.—“Yet,
(said he) we hang a man for stealing a horse,
and, horse are not taxed.”—Mr. Pitt has since
put an end to that argument.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>18th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>On this day we set out from Edinburgh.
We should gladly have had Mr. Scott to go
with us; but he was obliged to return to En∣gland.
—I have given a sketch of Dr. Johnson.
My readers may wish to know a little of his
fellow-traveller. Think, then, of a gentleman
of ancient blood, the pride of which was his
predominant passion. He was then in his
thirty-third year, and had been about four
years happily married. His inclination was to
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
be a Soldier; but his father, a respectable Judge,
had pressed him into the profession of the law.
He had travelled a good deal, and seen many
varieties of human life. He had thought more
than any body supposed, and had a pretty good
stock of general learning and knowledge. He
had all Dr. Johnson's principles, with some de∣gree
of relaxation. He had rather too little,
than too much prudence; and, his imagination
being lively, he often said things of which the
effect was very different from the intention.
He resembled sometimes</P>
<Q><L>“The best good man, with the worst-natur'd muse.”</L></Q>
<P>He cannot deny himself the vanity of finishing
with the encomium of Dr. Johnfon, whose
friendly partiality to the companion of his Tour,
represents him as one “whose acuteness would
help my inquiry, and whose gaiety of conver∣sation,
and civility of manners, are sufficient
to counteract the inconveniencies of travel, in
countries less hospitable than we have passed.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnfon thought it unnecessary to put
himsef to the additional expence of bringing
with him <HI>Francis Barber,</HI> his faithful black ser∣vant;
so we were attended only by my man,
<HI>Joseph Ritter,</HI> a Bohemian; a fine stately fellow
above six feet high, who had been over a great
part of Europe, and spoke many languages.
He was the best servant I ever saw in my life.
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
Let not my readers disdain his introduction▪
For Dr. Johnson gave him this character:
“Sir, he is a civil man, and a wise man.”</P>
<P>From an erroneous apprehension of violence,
Dr. Johnson had provided a pair of pistols, some
gunpowder, and a quantity of bullets. But
upon being assured we should run no risk of
meeting any robbers, he left his arms and
ammunition in an open drawer, of which he gave
my wife the charge. He also left in that drawer
one volume of a pretty full and curious Diary of
his Life, of which I have a few fragments; but
the book has been destroyed. I wish female
curiosity had been strong enough to have had it
all transcribed, which might easily have been
done; and I should think the theft, being <HI>pro
bono publico,</HI> might have been forgiven. But I
may be wrong. My wife told me she never
once looked into it.—She did not seem quite
easy when we left her. But away we went!</P>
<P>Mr. Nairne, advocate, was to go with us as
far as St. Andrews. It gives me pleasure that,
by mentioning his <HI>name,</HI> I connect his title to
the just and handsome compliment paid him by
Dr. Johnson, in his book: “A gentleman who
could stay with us only long enough to make
us know how much we lost by his leaving us.”
When we came to Leith, I talked with perhaps
too boasting an air, how pretty the Frith of
Forth looked; as indeed, after the prospect
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
from Constantinople, of which I have been told,
and that from Naples, which I have seen, I be∣lieve
the view of that Frith and its environs,
from the Castle-hill of Edinburgh, is the finest
prospect in Europe. “Aye (said Mr. Johnson)
that is the state of the world. Water is the same
every where.”</P>
<Q>Una est injusti coerula forma maris.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovid. Epist.</NOTE></Q>
<P>I told him the port here was the mouth of
the river or water of <HI>Leith.</HI> “Not <HI>Lethe,</HI>” said
Mr. Nairne.—“Why, Sir (said Dr. Johnson)
when a Scotsman sets out from this port for
England, he forgets his native country.”—
<HI>Nairne.</HI> “I hope, Sir, you shall forget England
here.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 'twill be still more
<HI>Lethe.</HI>”—He observed of the Pier or Quay,
“you have no occasion for so large a one:
your trade does not require it: But you are
like a shopkeeper who takes a shop, not only
for what he has to put into it, but that it may
be believed he has a great deal to put into
it.” It is very true, that there is now, com∣paratively,
little trade upon the eastern coast of
Scotland. The riches of Glasgow shew how
much there is in the west; and perhaps we shall
find trade travel westwards, on a great scale, as
well as a small.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="56"/>
We talked of a man's drowning himself.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I should never think it time to make
away with myself.”—I put the case of <HI>Eustace
Budgel,</HI> who was accused of forging a bill, and
sunk himself in the Thames, before the trial of
its authenticity came on. “Suppose,” Sir,
(said I) that a man is absolutely sure, that, if
he lives a few days longer, he shall be detected
in a fraud, the consequence of which will be
utter disgrace and expulsion from society?—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Then, Sir, let him go abroad to
a distant country; let him go to some place
where he is <HI>not</HI> known. Don't let him go to
the devil where he <HI>is</HI> known!”</P>
<P>He then said, “I see a number of people
bare footed here. I suppose you all went so
before the Union. Boswell, your ancestors
went so, when they had as much land as your
family has now. Yet <HI>Auchinleck</HI> is the <HI>Field of
Stones.</HI> There would be bad going bare footed
there. The <HI>Lairds</HI> however did it.” I bought
some <HI>speldings,</HI> fish (generally whitings) salted
and dried in a particular manner, being dipped
in the sea and dried in the sun, and eat by the
Scots by way of a relish. He had never seen
them, though they are sold in London. I in∣sisted
on <HI>scottifying</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My friend, General Campbell, Governour of Madras, tells me, that they make <HI>speldings</HI> in the East-Indies, particu∣larly at Bombay, where they call them <HI>Bombaloes.</HI></NOTE> his palate; But he was
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
very reluctant. With difficulty I prevailed with
him to let a bit of one of those <HI>speldings</HI> lye in his
mouth. He did not like it.</P>
<P>In crossing the Frith, Dr. Johnson deter∣mined
that we should land upon Inch Keith.
On approaching it, we first observed a high
rocky shore. We coasted about, and put into
a little bay on the North-west. We clambered
up a very steep ascent, on which was very good
grass, but rather a profusion of thistles. There
were sixteen head of black cattle grazing upon
the island. Lord Hailes observed to me, that
<HI>Brantome</HI> calls it <HI>L'isle des Chevaux,</HI> and that it
was probably “a <HI>safer</HI> stable” than many others
in his time. The fort, with an inscription on
it, <HI>Maria Re</HI> 1564, is strongly built. Dr.
Johnson examined it with much attention. He
stalked like a giant among the luxuriant thistles
and nettles. There are three wells in the
island; but we could not find one in the fort.
There must probably have been one, though
now filled up, as a garrison could not subsist
without it. But I have dwelt too long on this
little spot. Dr. Johnson afterwards bid me try
to write a description of our discovering Inch
Keith, in the usual style of travellers, de∣scribing
fully every particular; how we con∣cluded
that it must have once been inhabited,
and introducing many sage reflections; and we
should see how a thing might be covered in
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
words, so as to induce people to come and see
it. All that was said might be true, and yet
in reality there might be nothing to see. He
said, “I'd have this island. I'd build a house,
make a good landing-place, have a garden,
and vines, and all sorts of trees. A rich man,
of a hospitable turn, here, would have many
visitors from Edinburgh.” When we had got
into our boat again, he called to me, “Come,
now, pay a classical compliment to the island
on quitting it.” I happened luckily, in allu∣sion
to the beautiful Queen Mary, whose name
is upon the fort, to think of what Virgil makes
Aeneas say, on leaving the country of his
charming <HI>Dido.</HI></P>

<P>“Very well hit off!” said he.</P>
<P>We dined at Kinghorn, and then got into a
post-chaise. Mr. Nairne and his servant, and
Joseph, rode by us. We stopped at Cupar,
and drank tea. We talked of parliament; and
I said, I supposed very few of the members
knew much of what was going on, as indeed
very few gentlemen know much of their own
private affairs.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir, if a man
is not of a sluggish mind, he may be his own
steward. If he will look into his affairs, he
will soon learn. So it is as to publick affairs.
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
There must always be a certain number of men
of business in parliament.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But
consider, <HI>sir,</HI> what is the House of Commons?
Is not a great proportion of it chosen by Peers?
Do you think, sir they ought to have such an
influence?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, sir. Influence
must ever be in proportion to property; and
it is right it should.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But is there
not reason to fear that the common people may
be oppressed?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir. Our
great fear is from want of power in government.
Such a storm of vulgar force has broke in,”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “It has only roared.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir,
it has roared, till the Judges in Westminster-Hall
have been afraid to pronounce sentence in
opposition to the popular cry. You are fright∣ened
by what is no longer dangerous, like
Presbyterians by Popery.”—He then repeated a
passage, I think, in Butler's <HI>Remains,</HI> which
ends, “and would cry, Fire! Fire! in
Noah's flood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The passage quoted by Dr. Johnson is in the <HI>Character of the Assembly-man,</HI> Butler's <HI>Remains,</HI> p. 232, edit. 1754. “He preaches, indeed, both in season and out of season; for he rails at Popery, when the land is almost lost in Presbytery; and would cry Fire! Fire! in Noah's flood.”</P>
<P>There is reason to believe that this piece was not written by Butler, but by Sir John Birkenhead; for Wood, in his <HI>Athenae Oxonienses,</HI> Vol. II. p. 640, enumerates it among that gentleman's works, and gives the following account of it:</P>
<P>“<HI>The Assembly-man</HI> (or the character of an Assembly-man) written 1647, <HI>Lond. 1662-3,</HI> in three sheets in qu. The copy of it was taken from the author by those who said they could not rob, because all was theirs; so excised what they liked not; and so mangled and reformed it, that it was no character of an Assembly, but of themselves. At length, after it had slept several years, the author published it, to avoid false copies. It is also reprinted in a book entit. <HI>Wit and Loyalty revived,</HI> in a collection of some smart satyrs in verse and prose on the late times. <HI>Lond.</HI> 1682, qu. said to be written by Abr. Cowley, Sir John Birkenhead, and Hudibras, alias Sam. Butler”—For this information I am indebted to Mr. Reed, of Staple Inn.</P></NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="60"/>
We had a dreary drive, in a dusky night, to
St. Andrew's where we arrived late. We
found a good supper at Glass's inn, and Dr.
Johnson revived agreeably. He said, the col∣lection
called “The Muses' Welcome to King
James,” (first of England, and sixth of Scotland,)
on his return to his native kingdom, shewed
that there was then abundance of learning in
Scotland; and that the conceits in that collec∣tion,
with which people find fault, were mere
mode. He said, we could not now entertain a
sovereign so; that Buchanan had spread the
spirit of learning amongst us, but we had lost
it during the civil wars. He did not allow the
Latin poetry of Pitcairne so much merit, as
has been usually attributed to it; though he
owned that one of his pieces which he men∣tioned,
but which I am sorry is not specified
in my notes, was “very well.” It is not im∣probable
that it was the poem which Prior has
so elegantly translated.</P>
<P>After supper, we made a <HI>procession</HI> to <HI>Saint
Leonard's College,</HI> the landlord walking before
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
us with a candle, and the waiter with a lantern.
That college had some time before been dis∣solved;
and Dr. Watson, a professor here, (the
historian of Philip II.) had purchased the
ground, and what buildings remained. When
we entered his court, it seemed quite academi∣cal;
and we found in his house very comfort∣able
and genteel accommodation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Journal, from this day inclusive, was read by Dr. Johnson.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>19th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We rose much refreshed. I had with me a
map of Scotland, a Bible, which was given me
by Lord Mountstuart when we were together
in Italy, and Ogden's Sermons on Prayer.
Mr. Nairne introduced us to Dr. Watson,
whom we found a well-informed man, of very
amiable manners. Dr. Johnson, after they
were acquainted, said, “I take great delight
in him.”—His daughter, a very pleasing young
lady, made breakfast. Dr. Watson observed,
that Glasgow University had fewer home stu∣dents,
since trade increased, as learning was
rather incompatible with it.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why,
sir, as trade is now carried on by subordinate
hands, men in trade have as much leisure as
others; and now learning itself is a trade. A
man goes to a bookseller, and gets what he
can. We have done with patronage. In the
infancy of learning, we find some great man
praised for it. This diffused it among others.
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
When it becomes general, an authour leaves
the great, and applies to the multitude.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “It is a shame that authours are not
now better patronized.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir.
If learning cannot support a man, if he must
sit with his hands across till somebody feeds
him, it is as to him a bad thing, and it is
better as it is. With patronage, what flattery!
what falsehood! While a man is in equilibrio,
he throws truth among the multitude, and
lets them take it as they please: in patronage,
he must say what pleases his patron, and it is an
equal chance whether that be truth or false∣hood.”
—<HI>Watson.</HI> “But is not the case now,
that, instead of flattering one person, we flatter
the age?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir. The world al∣ways
lets a man tell what he thinks, his own
way. I wonder however, that so many people
have written, who might have let it alone.
That people should endeavour to excel in con∣versation,
I do not wonder; because in conver∣sation
praise is instantly reverberated.”</P>
<P>We talked of change of manners. Dr. John∣son
observed, that our drinking less than our
ancestors was owing to the change from ale to
wine. “I remember (said he) when all the
<HI>decent</HI> people in Lichfield got drunk every night,”
and were not the worse thought of. Ale was
cheap, so you pressed strongly. When a man
must bring a bottle of wine, he is not in such
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
haste. Smoaking has gone out. To be sure,
it is a shocking thing, blowing smoak out of
our mouths into other peoples mouths, eyes,
and noses, and having the same thing done to
us. Yet I cannot account why a thing which
requires so little exertion, and yet preserves the
mind from total vacuity, should have gone out.
Every man has something by which he calms
himself: beating with his feet, or so<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Johnson used to practice this himself very much.</NOTE>. I re∣member
when people in England changed a
shirt only once a week: a Pandour, when he
gets a shirt, greases it to make it last. For∣merly,
good tradesmen had no fire but in the
kitchen; never in the parlour, except on Sun∣day.
My father, who was a magistrate of
Lichfield, lived thus. They never began to
have a fire in the parlour, but on leaving off
business, or some great revolution of their life.”
—Dr. <HI>Watson</HI> said, the hall was as a kitchen,
in old squires houses.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir.
The hall was for great occasions, and never was
used for domestick refection.”—We talked of
the Union, and what money it had brought
into Scotland. Dr. Watson observed, that a
little money formerly went as far as a great
deal now.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “In speculation, it seems
that a smaller quantity of money, equal in value
to a larger quantity, if equally divided, should
produce the same effect. But it is not so in
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
reality. Many more conveniences and elegan∣cies
are enjoyed where money is plenty, than
where it is scarce. Perhaps a great familiarity
with it, which arises from plenty, makes us
more easily part with it.”</P>
<P>After what Dr. Johnson has said of St. An∣drew's,
which he had long wished to see, as our
ancient university, and the seat of our Primate
in the days of episcopacy, I can say little.
Since the publication of Dr. Johnson's book, I
find that he has been censured for not seeing
here the ancient chapel of <HI>St. Rule,</HI> a curious
piece of sacred architecture. But this was
neither his fault nor mine. We were both of
us abundantly desirous of surveying such sort
of antiquities; but neither of us knew of this.
I am afraid the censure must fall on those who
did not tell us of it. In every place, where
there is any thing worthy of observation, there
should be a short printed directory for strangers,
such as we find in all the towns of Italy, and in
fome of the towns in England. I was told
that there is a manuscript account of St. An∣drew's,
by Martin, secretary to Archbishop
Sharp; and that one Douglas has published a
small account of it. I inquired at a booksel∣ler's,
but could not get it. Dr. Johnson's ve∣neration
for the Hierarchy is well known.
There is no wonder then, that he was affected
with a strong indignation, while he beheld the
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
ruins of religious magnificence. I happened
to ask where John Knox was buried. Dr. John∣son
burst out, “I hope in the high-way. I
have been looking at his reformations.”</P>
<P>It was a very fine day. Dr. Johnson seemed
quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the
scenes which were now presented to him. He
kept his hat off while he was upon any part of
the ground where the Cathedral had stood. He
said well, that “Knox had set on a mob, without
knowing where it would end; and that differ∣ing
from a man in doctrine was no reason why
you should pull his house about his ears.” As
we walked in the cloisters, there was a solemn
echo, while he talked loud of a proper retire∣ment
from the world. Mr. <HI>Nairne</HI> said, he had
an inclination to retire. I called Dr. Johnson's
attention to this, that I might hear his opinion
if it was right.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, when he has
done his duty to society.” In general, as every
man is obliged not only to “love GOD, but his
neighbour as himself,” he must bear his part in
active life; yet there are exceptions. Those
who are exceedingly scrupulous (which I do
not approve, for I am no friend to scruples) and
find their scrupulosity invincible, so that they
are quite in the dark, and know not what they
shall do—or those who cannot resist tempta∣tions,
and find they make themselves worse by
being in the world, without making it better,
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
may retire. I never read of a hermit, but in
imagination I kiss his feet; never of a monas∣tery,
but I could fall on my knees, and kiss the
pavement. But I think putting young people
there, who know nothing of life, nothing of
retirement, is dangerous and wicked. It is a
saying as old as Hesiod,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
That is a very noble line: not that young men
should not pray, or old men not give counsel,
but that every season of life has its proper du∣ties.
I have thought of retiring, and have
talked of it to a friend; but I find my vocation
is rather to active life.” I said <HI>some</HI> young
monks might be allowed, to shew that it is not
age alone that can retire to pious solitude;
but he thought this would only shew they could
not resist temptation.</P>
<P>He wanted to mount the steeples, but it
could not be done. There are no good in∣scriptions
here. Bad Roman characters he na∣turally
mistook for half Gothick, half Roman.
One of the steeples, which he was told was in
danger, he wished not to be taken down; “for,
said he, it may fall on some of the posterity of
John Knox; and no great matter!” Dinner
was mentioned.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Aye, aye; amidst
all these sorrowful scenes, I have no objection
to dinner.”</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="67"/>
We went and looked at the castle, where
Cardinal Beaton was murdered, and then vi∣sited
Principal Murison at his college, where
is a good library-room; but the Principal
was abundantly vain of it, for he seriously said
to Dr. Johnson, “you have not such a one in
England.”</P>
<P>The professors entertained us with a very
good dinner. Present: Murison, Shaw,
Cooke, Hill, Haddo, Watson, Flint,
Brown. I observed, that I wondered to see him
eat so well, after viewing so many sorrowful
scenes of ruined religious magnificence. “Why,
said he, I am not sorry, after seeing these gen∣tlemen;
for they are not sorry.”—<HI>Murison</HI> said,
all sorrow was bad, as it was murmuring against
the dispensations of Providence.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Sir, sorrow is inherent in humanity. As you
cannot judge two and two to be either five, or
three, but certainly four, so, when comparing
a worse present state with a better which is
past, you cannot but feel sorrow. It is
not cured by reason, but by the incursion
of present objects, which wear out the
past. You need not murmur, though you
are sorry.”—<HI>Murison.</HI> “But St. Paul says, “I
have learnt, in whatever state I am, therewith
to be content.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, that relates
to riches and poverty; for we see St. Paul, when
he had a thorn in the flesh, prayed earnestly to”
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
“have it removed; and then he could not be
content.”—Murison, thus refuted, tried to be
smart, and drank to Dr. Johnson, “Long may
you lecture!”—Dr. Johnson afterwards, speak∣ing
of his not drinking wine, said, “The Doc∣tor
spoke of <HI>lecturing</HI> (looking to him). I give
all these lectures on water.”</P>
<P>He defended requiring subscription in those
admitted to universities, thus: “As all who
come into the country must obey the king, so
all who come into an university must be of the
church.”</P>
<P>And here I must do Dr. Johnson the justice
to contradict a very absurd and ill-natured story,
as to what passed at St. Andrew's It has been
circulated, that, after grace was said in En∣glish,
in the usual manner, he with the greatest
marks of contempt, as if he had held it to be
no grace in an university, would not sit down
till he had said grace aloud in Latin. This
would have been an insult indeed to the gen∣tlemen
who wer entertaining us. But the
truth was precisely thus. In the course of con∣versation
at dinner, Dr. Johnson, in very good
humour, said, “I should have expected to
have heard a Latin grace, among so many
learned men: we had always a Latin grace
at Oxford. I believe I can repeat it.” Which
he did, as giving the learned men in one place
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
a specimen of what was done by the learned men
in another place.</P>
<P>We went and saw the church, in which is
Archbishop Sharp's monument. I was struck
with the same kind of feelings with which the
churches of Italy impressed me. I was pleased,
curiously pleased, to see Dr. Johnson actually
in St. Andrew's, of which we had talked so long.
Professor Haddo was with us this afternoon,
along with Dr. Watson. We looked at St. Sal∣vador's
College. The rooms for students seemed
very commodious, and Dr. Johnson said, the
chapel was the neatest place of worship he had
seen. The key of the library could not be
found; for it seems Professor Hill, who was out
of town had taken it with him. Dr. Johnson
told a joke he had heard of a monastery abroad,
where the key of the library could never be
found.</P>
<P>It was somewhat dispiriting, to see this an∣cient
archiepiscopal city now sadly deserted.
We saw in one of its strets a remarkable proof
of liberal toleration; a nonjuring clergyman,
with a jolly countenance and a round belly, like
a well-fed monk, strutting about in his canoni∣cals.</P>
<P>We observed two occupations united in the
same person, who had hung out two sign-posts.
Upon one was “James Hood, White Iron
Smith” (<HI>i. e.</HI> Tin-plate Worker). Upon
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
another “The Art of Fencing taught, by
James Hood.”—Upon this last were painted
some trees and two men fencing, one of whom
had hit the other in the eye, to shew his great
dexterity; so that the art was well taught.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Were I studying here, I should go
and take a lesson. I remember <HI>Hope,</HI> in his
book on this art, says,” “the Scotch are very
good fencers.”</P>
<P>We returned to the inn, where we had been
entertained at dinner, and drank tea in company
with some of the Professors, of whose civilities
I beg leave to add my humble and very grateful
acknowledgement to the honourable testimony
of Dr. Johnson, in his “Journey.”</P>
<P>We talked of composition, which was a fa∣vourite
topick of Dr. Watson's, who first distin∣guished
himself by lectures on rhetorick.—
<HI>Johnson,</HI> “I advised Chambers, and would ad∣vise
every young man beginning to compose, to
do it as fast as he can, to get a habit of having
his mind to start promptly; it is so much more
difficult to improve in speed than in accuracy.”
—<HI>Watson.</HI> “I own I am for much attention to
accuracy in composing, lest one should get bad
habits of doing it in a slovenly manner.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir, you are confounding <HI>do∣ing</HI>
inaccurately with the <HI>necessity</HI> of doing inac∣curately.
A man knows when his composition
is inaccurate, and when he thinks fit he'll cor∣rect”
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
“it. But, if a man is accustomed to com∣pose
slowly, and with difficulty, upon all occa∣sions,
there is danger that he may not compose
at all, as we do not like to do that which is not
done easily; and, at any rate, more time is
consumed in a small matter than ought to be.”
—<HI>Watson</HI> said, “Dr. Hugh Blair took a week
to compose a sermon.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Then, Sir,
that is for want of the habit of composing
quickly, which I am insisting one should ac∣quire.”
—<HI>Watson</HI> said, “Blair was not com∣posing
all the week, but only such hours as he
found himself disposed for composition.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, Sir, unless you tell me the time
he took, you tell me nothing. If I say I took
a week to walk a mile, and have had the gout
five days, and been ill otherwise another day, I
have taken but one day. I myself have com∣posed
about forty sermons. I have begun a
sermon after dinner, and sent it off by the post
that night. I wrote forty-eight of the printed
octavo pages of the Life of Savage at a sitting;
but then I sat up all night. I have also writ∣ten
six sheets in a day of translation from the
French.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “We have all observed
how one man dresses himself slowly, and another
fast.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, Sir; it is wonderful
how much time some people will consume in
dressing; taking up a thing and looking at it,
and laying it down, and taking it up again.
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
Every one should get the habit of doing it
quickly. I would say to a young divine,” “Here
is your text; let me see how soon you can
make a sermon.” Then I'd say, “Let me see
how much better you can make it.” Thus I
should see both his powers and his judgement.”</P>
<P>We all went to Dr. Watson's to supper.
Miss Sharp, great grandchild of Archbishop
Sharp, was there; as was Mr. Craig, the inge∣nious
architect of the new town of Edinburgh,
and nephew of Thomson, to whom Dr. Johnson
has since done so much justice, in his “Lives
of the Poets.”</P>
<P>We talked of memory, and its various
modes.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Memory will play strange
tricks. One sometimes loses a single word. I
once lost <HI>fugaces</HI> in the Ode <HI>Posthume, Posthume.</HI>”
I mentioned to him, that a worthy gentleman
of my acquaintance actually forgot his own
name.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, that was a morbid ob∣livion.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>20th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. Shaw, the professor of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nity, break∣fasted
with us. I took out my “Ogden on
Prayer,” and read some of it to the company
Dr. Johnson praised him. “Abernethy (said
he) allows only of a physical effect of prayer
upon the mind, which may be produced many
ways, as well as by prayer; for instance, by
meditation. Ogden goes farther. In truth,
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
we have the consent of all nations for the effi∣cacy
of prayer, whether offered up by indivi∣duals,
or by assémblies; and Revelation has
told us, it will be effectual.”—I said, “Leech∣man
seemed to incline to Abernethy's doctrine.”
—<HI>Watson</HI> observed, that Leechman meant to
shew, that, even admitting no effect to be pro∣duced
by prayer, respecting the Deity, it was
useful to our own minds. He had given only
a part of his system: Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> thought he
should have given the whole.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson enforced the strict observance
of Sunday. Said he, “It should be different
from another day. People may walk; but not
throw stones at birds. There may be relaxation,
but there should be no levity.”</P>
<P>We went and saw Colonel Nairne's garden
and grotto. Here was a fine old plane tree.
Unluckily the colonel said, there was but this
and another large tree in the county. This
was an excellent cue for Dr. Johnson, who
laughed enormously, calling to me to hear this.
He had expatiated to me on the nakedness of
that part of Scotland which he had seen. His
Journey has been violently abused, for what
he has said upon this subject. But let it be
considered, that, when Dr. Johnson talks of
trees, he means trees of good size, such as he
was accustomed to see in England; and of
these there are certainly very few upon the
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
<HI>eastern coast</HI> of Scotland. Besides, he said, that
he meant to give only a map of the road; and
let any traveller observe how many trees, which
deserve the name, he can see from the road
from Berwick to Aberdeen, Had Dr. Johnson
said “there are <HI>no</HI> trees” upon this line, he
would have said what is colloquially true; be∣cause,
by no trees, in common speech, we mean
few. When he is particular in counting, he
may be attacked. I know not how Colonel
Nairne came to say there were but <HI>two</HI> large
trees in the county of Fife. I did not perceive
that he smiled. There are not a great many
to be sure; but I could have shewn him more
than two at <HI>Balmuto,</HI> from whence my ancesto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
came.</P>
<P>In the grotto, we saw a wonderful large
lobster claw. In front of it were petrified
stocks of fir, plane, and some other tree. Dr.
Johnson said, “Scotland has no right to boast
of this grotto; it is owing to personal merit.
I never denied personal merit to many of you.”
—Professor Shaw said to me, as we walked,
“This is a wonderful man: he is master of
every subject he handles.”—Dr. Watson allowed
him a very strong understanding, but wondered
at his total inattention to established manners,
as he came from London.</P>
<P>I have not preserved, in my Journal, any of
the conversation which passed between Dr.
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
Johnson and Professor Shaw; but I recollect
Dr. Johnson said to me afterwards, “I took
much to Shaw.”</P>
<P>We left St. Andrew's about noon, and some
miles from it observing, at <HI>Leuchars,</HI> a church
with an old tower, we stopped to look at it.
The <HI>manse,</HI> as the parsonage-house is called in
Scotland, was close by. I waited on the mi∣nister,
mentioned our names, and begged he
would tell us what he knew about it. He was
a very civil old man; but could only inform
us, that it was supposed to have stood eight hun∣dred
years. He told us, there was a colony of
Danes in his parish; that they had landed at a
remote period of time, and still remained a di∣stinct
people. Dr. Johnson shrewdly inquired
if they had brought women with them. We
were not satisfied, as to this colony.</P>
<P>We saw, this day, Dundee and Aberbrothick,
the last of which Dr. Johnson has celebrated in
his “Journey.” Upon the road we talked of
the Roman Catholick faith. He mentioned
(I think) Tillotson's argument against transub∣stantiation:
“That we are as sure we see bread
and wine only, as that we read in the Bible the
text on which that false doctrine is founded.
We have only the evidence of our senses for
both.” “If (he added) GOD had never spoken
siguratively, we might hold that he speaks lite∣rally,
when he says,” “This is my body.”—
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But what do you say, Sir, to the an∣cient
and continued tradition of the church
upon this point?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Tradition, Sir,
has no place, where the Scriptures are plain;
and tradition cannot persuade a man into a be∣lief
of transubstantiation. Able men, indeed,
have <HI>said</HI> they believed it.”</P>
<P>This is an awful subject. I did not then
press Dr. Johnson upon it; nor shall I now
enter upon a disquisition concerning the import
of those words uttered by our Saviour, which
had such an effect upon many of his disciples,
that they “went back, and walked no more
with him.” The Catechism and solemn office
for Communion, in the Church of England,
maintain a mysterious belief in more than a
mere commemoration of the death of Christ,
by partaking of the elements of bread and
wine.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson put me in mind, that, at St. An∣drew's,
I had defended my profession very well,
when the question had again been started,
Whether a Lawyer might honestly engage with
the first side that offers him a fee? “Sir (said
I) it was with your arguments against Sir Wil∣liam
Forbes. But it was much that I could
wield the arms of Goliath.”</P>
<P>He said our judges had not gone deep in
literary property. I mentioned Lord Mon∣boddo's
opinion, that if a man could get a
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
work by heart, he might print it, as by such
an act the mind is exercised.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No,
Sir; a man's repeating it no more makes it his
property, than a man may sell a cow which he
drives home.”—I said, printing an abridge∣ment
of a work was allowed, which was only
cutting the horns and tail off the cow.—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“No, Sir; 'tis making the cow have a
calf.”</P>
<P>About eleven at night we arrived at Mont∣rose.
We found but a sorry inn, where I my∣self
saw another waiter put a lump of sugar with
his fingers into Dr. Johnson's lemonade, for
which he called him “Rascal!” It put me in
great glee that our landlord was an <HI>Englishman.</HI>
I rallied the Doctor upon this, and he grew quiet.
Both Sir John Hawkins's and Dr. Burney's
History of Musick had then been advertised.
I asked if this was not unlucky? Would not
they hurt one another?—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir.
They will do good to one another. Some will
buy the one, some the other, and compare
them; and so a talk is made about a thing, and
the books are sold.”</P>
<P>He was angry at me for proposing to carry
lemons with us to Sky, that he might be sure
to have his lemonade. “Sir (said he) I do not
wish to be thought that feeble man who cannot
do without any thing. Sir, it is very bad
manners to carry provisions to any man's house,”
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
“as if he could not entertain you. To an infe∣riour,
it is oppressive; to a superiour, it is in∣solent.”</P>
<P>Having taken the liberty, this evening, to
remark to Dr. Johnson, that he very often sat
quite silent for a long time, even when in com∣pany
with only a single friend, which I myself
had sometimes sadly experienced, he smiled and
said, “It is true, Sir. <HI>Tom Tyers</HI> (for so he
familiarly called our ingenious friend, who,
since his death, has paid a biographical tribute
to his memory) <HI>Tom Tyers</HI> described me the
best. He once said to me, “Sir, you are like
a ghost. You never speak till you are spoken
to.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>21st August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Neither the Rev. Mr. Nisbet, the established
minister, nor the Rev. Mr. Spooner, the epis∣copal
minister, were in town. Before breakfast,
we went and saw the town-hall, where is a good
dancing-room, and other rooms for tea-drinking.
The appearance of the town from it is very
well, only many of the houses are built with
their ends to the street, which looks aukward.
When we came down from it, I met Mr. Gleg,
the merchant here. He went with us to see
the English chapel. It is situated on a pretty
dry spot, and there is a fine walk to it. It is
really an elegant building, both within and
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
without. The organ is adorned with green and
gold. Dr. Johnson gave a shilling extraordi∣nary
to the clerk, saying, “He belongs to an
honest church.” I put him in mind, that epis∣copals
were but <HI>dissenters</HI> here; they were only
<HI>tolerated.</HI> “Sir (said he) we are here, as Chris∣tians
in Turkey.” Dr. Johnson went into an
apothecary's, and ordered some medicine for
himself, and wrote the prescription in technical
characters. The boy took him for a physician.</P>
<P>I doubted much which road to take, whether
to go by the coast, or by Laurence Kirk and
Monboddo. I knew Lord Monboddo and Dr.
Johnson did not love each other; yet I was
unwilling not to visit his lordship; and was
also curious to see them together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were several points of similarity between them; learning, clearness of head, precision of speech, and a love of research on many subjects which people in general do not investigate. <HI>Foote</HI> paid Lord Monboddo the compliment of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing, that he was “an Elzevir edition of Johnson.”</NOTE> I men∣tioned
it to Dr. Johnson, who said, “He
would go two miles out of his way to see Lord
Monboddo.” I therefore sent forward Joseph,
with the following note:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“My dear Lord,”</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Montrose, <DATE>21 August.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>“THUS far I am come with Mr. <HI>Samuel
Johnson.</HI> We must be at Aberdeen to-night.
I know you do not admire him so much as I
do; but I cannot be in this country without
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
making you a bow at your old place, as I do
not know if I may again have an opportunity
of seeing Monboddo. Besides, Mr. Johnson
says, he would go two miles out of his way to
see Lord Monboddo. I have sent forward my
servant, that we may know if your lordship be
at home. I am ever, my dear lord,</P>
<CLOSER>Most sincerely your's.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As we travelled onwards from Montrose, we
had the Grampion hills in our view, and some
good land around us, but clear of trees and
hedges. Dr. Johnson has said ludicrously, in
his “Journey,” that the <HI>hedges</HI> were of <HI>stone;</HI> for,
instead of the verdant <HI>thorn</HI> to refresh the eye,
we found the bare wall or <HI>dike</HI> intersecting the
prospect. He observed, that it was wonderful
to see a country so divested, so denuded of
trees.</P>
<P>We stopped at Laurence Kirk, where our
great grammarian, Ruddiman, was once
schoolmaster. We respectfully remembered
that excellent man and eminent scholar, by
whose labours a knowledge of the Latin lan∣guage
will be preserved in Scotland, if it shall
be preserved at all. Lord Gardenston, one of
our judges, collected money to raise a monu∣ment
to him at this place, which I hope will
be well executed. I know my father gave five
guineas towards it. Lord Gardenston is the
proprietor of Laurence Kirk, and has encou∣raged
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
the building of a manufacturing village,
of which he is exceedingly fond, and has
written a pamphlet upon it, as if he had
founded Thebes; in which, however, there are
many useful precepts strongly expressed. The
village seemed to be irregularly built, some of
the houses being of clay, some of brick, and
some of brick and stone. Dr. Johnson ob∣served,
they thatched well here.</P>
<P>I was a little acquainted with Mr. Forbes,
the minister of the parish. I sent to inform
him that a gentleman desired to see him. He
returned for answer, “that he would not come
to a stranger.” I then gave my name, and he
came. I remonstrated to him for not coming
to a stranger; and, by presenting him to Dr.
Johnson, proved to him what a stranger might
sometimes be. His Bible inculcates “he not
forgetful to entertain strangers,” and mentions
the same motive. He defended himself by say∣ing,
“He had once come to a stranger who
sent for him; and he found him” “a <HI>little-worth
person!</HI>”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson insisted on stopping at the inn,
as I told him that Lord Gardenston had fur∣nished
it with a collection of books, that travel∣lers
might have entertainment for the mind, as
well as the body. He praised the design, but
wished there had been more books, and those
better chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="82"/>
About a mile from Monboddo, where you
turn off the road, Joseph was waiting to tell us
my lord expected us to dinner. We drove over
a wild moor. It rained, and the scene was
somewhat dreary. Dr. Johnson repeated, with
solemn emphasis, Macbeth's speech on meeting
the witches. As we travelled on, he told me,
“Sir, you got into our club by doing what a
man can do. Several of the members wished
to keep you out. Burke told me, he doubted
if you was fit for it. But now you are in,
none of them are sorry. Burke says, that you
have so much good humour naturally, it is
scarce a virtue.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “They were
afraid of you Sir, as it was you who proposed
me.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, they knew, that if they
refused you, they'd probably never have got
in another. I'd have kept them. all out.
Beauclerk was very earnest for you.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“Beauclerk has a kenness of mind which is
very uncommon.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, Sir; and
every thing comes from him so easily. It ap∣pears
to me that I labour, when I say a good
thing.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “You are loud, Sir; but it
is not an effort of mind.”</P>
<P>Monboddo is a wretched place, wild and
naked, with a poor old house; though, if I re∣collect
right, there are two turrets which mark
an old baron's residence. Lord Monboddo re∣ceived
us at his gate most courteously; pointed
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
to the Douglas arms upon his house, and told
us that his great-grandmother was of that fa∣mily.
“In such houses (said he) our ancestors
lived, who were better men than we.”—“No,
no, my lord (said Dr. Johnson). We are as
strong as they, and a great deal wiser.”—This
was an assault upon one of Lord Monboddo's
capital dogmas, and I was afraid there would
have been a violent altercation in the very close.
before we got into the house. But his lordship
is distinguished not only for “ancient meta∣physicks,”
but for ancient <HI>politesse, “la vieille
eour,</HI>” and he made no reply.</P>
<P>His lordship was drest in a rustick suit, and
wore a little round hat; told us, we now saw
him as <HI>Farmer Burnett,</HI> and we should have his
family dinner, a farmer's dinner. He said,
“I should not have forgiven Mr. Boswell, had
he not brought you here, Dr. Johnson.” He
produced a very long stalk of corn, as a speci∣men
of his crop, and said “you see here the
<HI>laetas segetes,</HI>” and observed that <HI>Virgil</HI> seemed to
be as enthusiastick a farmer as he, and was
certainly a practical one.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It does
not always follow, my lord, that a man who
has written a good poem on an art, has prac∣tised
it. Philip Miller told me, that in Philips's
Cyder, a poem, all the precepts were just, and
indeed better than in books written for the pur∣pose
of instructing; yet Philips had never made
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yder.”</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="84"/>
I started the subject of emigrations.—<HI>Johnson</HI>
“To a man of mere animal life, you can urge
no argument against going to America, but
that it will be some time before he will get the
earth to produce. But a man of any intellec∣tual
enjoyment will not easily go and immerse
himselfe and his posterity for ages in barbarism.”</P>
<P>He and my lord spoke highly of Homer.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “He had all the learning of his age.
The shield of Achilles shews a nation in war, a
nation in peace; harvest sport, nay stealing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My note of this is much too short. <HI>Brevis esse laboro ob∣scurus fio.</HI> Yet, as I have resolved that <HI>the very Journal which Dr. Johnson read</HI> shall be presented to the publick. I will not expand the text in any considerable degree, though I may occasionally supply a word to compleat the sense, as I fill up the blanks of abbreviation in the writing; neither of which can be said to change the genuine Journal. One of the best criticks of our age conjectures that the imperfect passage above has probably been as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollows: “In his book we have an ac∣curate display of a nation in war, and a nation in peace; the peasant is delineated as accurately as the general; nay, even harvest sport, and the modes of ancient theft, are described.”</NOTE>.”
—<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “Aye, and what we (looking to
me) would call a parliament-house scene; a
cause pleaded.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “That is part of the
life of a nation in peace. And there are in
Homer such characters of heroes, and combi∣nations
of qualities of heroes, that the united
powers of mankind ever since have not pro∣duced
any but what are to be found there.”—
<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “Yet no character is described.”
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No; they all develope themselves.
Agamemnon is always a gentleman-like cha∣racter;
he has always <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. That the
ancients held so, is plain from this; that Euri∣pides,
in his Hecuba, makes him the person to
interpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Johnson modestly said, he had not read Homer so much as he wished he had done. But this conversation shews how well he was acquainted with the Moeonian bard; and he has shewn it still more in his criticism upon Pope's Homer, in his Life of that Poet. My excellent friend, Mr. Langton, told me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was once present at a dispute between Dr. Johnson and Mr. Burke, on the comparative merits of Homer and Virgil, which was carried on with extraordinary abilities on both sides. Dr. Johnson maintained the superiority of Homer.</NOTE>.”—<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “The history of man∣ners
is the most valuable.” I never set a high
value on any other history.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nor I;
and therefore I esteem biography, as giving us
what comes near to ourselves, what we can turn
to use.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> But in the course of general
history, we find manners. In wars, we see the
dispositions of people, their degrees of huma∣nity,
and other particulars.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes;
but then you must take all the facts to get this;
and it is but a little you get.”—<HI>Monboddo.</HI>
“And it is that little which makes history va∣luable.”
—Bravo! thought I; they agree like
two brothers.—<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “I am sorry, Dr.
Johnson, you was not longer at Edinburgh, to
receive the homage of our men of learning.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “My lord, I received great respect
and great kindness.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “He goes back
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
to Edinburgh after our tour.”—We talked of
the decrease of learning in Scotland, and of the
“Muses Welcome.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Learning is
much decreased in England, in my remem∣brance.”
—<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “You, Sir, have lived to
see its decrease in England, I its extinction in
Scotland.” However, I brought him to con∣fess
that the High School of Edinburgh did
well.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Learning has decreased in
England, because learning will not do so much
for a man as formerly. There are other ways of
getting preferment. Few bishops are now
made for their learning. To be a bishop, a
man must be learned in a learned age—factious
in a factious age; but always of eminence.
Warburton is an exception; though his learn∣ing
alone did not raise him. He was first an
antagonist to Pope, and helped Theobald to
publish his Shakspeare; but, seeing Pope the
rising man—when Crousaz attacked his Essay
on Man, for some faults which it has, and some
which it has not, Warburton defended it in the
Review of that time. This brought him ac∣quainted
with Pope, and he gained his friend∣ship.
Pope introduced him to Allen—Allen
married him to his niece: So, by Allen's inte∣rest
and his own, he was made a bishop. But
then his learning was the <HI>sine quà non:</HI> He
knew how to make the most of it; but I do not
find by any dishonest means.”—<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “He
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
is a great man.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes; he has great
knowledge—great power of mind. Hardly any
man brings greater variety of learning to bear
upon his point.”—<HI>Monboddo.</HI> “He is one of
the greatest lights of your church.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Why? we are not so sure of his being very
friendly to us. He blazes, if you will; but
that is not always the steadiest light. <HI>Lowth</HI> is
another bishop who has risen by his learning.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson examined young <HI>Arthur,</HI> Lord
Monboddo's son, in Latin. He answered very
well; upon which he said, with complacency,
“Get you gone! When King James comes
back, you shall be in the Muses Welcome!”
—My lord and Dr. Johnson disputed a little,
whether the Savage or the London Shopkeeper
had the best existence; his lordship, as usual,
preferring the Savage. My lord was as hos∣pitable
as I could have wished, and I saw both
Dr. Johnson and him liking each other better
every hour.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson having retired for a short time,
my lord spoke of his conversation as I could
have wished. Dr. Johnson had said, “I have
done greater feats with my knife than this;”
though he had taken a very hearty dinner.—
My lord, who affects or believes he follows an
abstemious system, seemed struck with Dr.
Johnson's manner of living. I had a particular
satisfaction in being under the roof of <HI>Monboddo,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
my lord being my father's old friend, and having
been always very good to me. We were cor∣dial
together. He asked Dr. Johnson and me
to stay all night. When I said we <HI>must</HI> be at
Aberdeen, he replied, “Well, I am like the Ro∣mans:
I shall say to you,” “Happy to come—
happy to depart!” He thanked Dr. Johnson
for his visit.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “ I little thought, when
I had the honour to meet your lordship in
London, that I should see you at Monboddo.”
—After dinner, as the ladies were going away,
Dr. Johnson would stand up. He insisted that
politeness was of great consequence in society.
“It is (said he) fictitious benevolence.” It
supplies the place of it amongst those who see
each other only in publick, or but little. Depend
upon it, the want of it never fails to produce
something disagreeable to one or other. I have
always applied to good breeding, what Addison
in his Cato says of Honour,</P>
<Q><L>“Honour's a sacred tie; the law of Kings;</L>
<L>The noble mind's distinguishing perfection,</L>
<L>That aids and strengthens Virtue where it meets her,</L>
<L>And imitates her actions where she is not.”</L></Q>
<P>When he took up his large oak stick, he
said, “My lord, that's <HI>homerick;”</HI> thus plea∣santly
alluding to his lordship's favourite writer.
<HI>Gory,</HI> my lord's black servant, was sent as our
guide so far. This was another point of simi∣larity
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
between Johnson and Monboddo. I ob∣served
how curious it was to see an African in
the north of Scotland, with little or no diffe∣rence
of manners from those of the natives.
Dr. Johnson laughed to see Gory and Joseph
riding together most cordially. “Those two
fellows, (said he) one from Africa, the other
from Bohemia, seem quite at home.”—He was
much pleased with Lord Monboddo to-day.
He said, he would have pardoned him for a few
paradoxes, when he found he had so much that
was good. But that, from his appearance in
London, he thought him all paradox, which
would not do.”—He observed, that his lordship
had talked no paradoxes to-day. “And as to
the savage and the London shopkeeper (said
he) I don't know but I might have taken the
side of the savage equally, had any body else
taken the side of the shopkeeper.”—He had
said to my lord, in opposition to the value of
the savage's courage, that it was owing to his
limited power of thinking, and repeated Pope's
verses, in which “Macedonia's mad-man” is
introduced, and the conclusion is,
<Q><L>“Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose.”</L></Q>
I objected to the last phrase, as being low.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, it is intended to be low: it is
satyr. The expression is debased, to debase the
character.”</P>
<P>When Gory was about to part from us, Dr.
Johnson called to him, “Mr. Gory, give me leave
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
to ask you a question!” “are you baptised?”
Gory told him he was—and confirmed by the
Bishop of Durham. He then gave him a shil∣ling.</P>
<P>We had tēdious driving this afternoon and
were a good deal drowsy. Last night I was
afraid Dr. Johnson was beginning to faint in
his resolution; for he said “If we must ride
much, we shall not go; and there's an end
on't.”—To-day, when he talked of <HI>Sky</HI> with
spirit, I said, “Why, Sir, you seemed to me
to despond yesterday. You are a delicate Lon∣doner
—You are a maccaroni! You can't ride.”
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I shall ride better than you. I
was only afraid I should not find a horse able
to carry me.”—I hoped then there would be no
fear of getting through our wild Tour! We
came to Aberdeen at half an hour past eleven.
The New Inn, we were told, was full. This was
comfortless. The waiter, however, asked if
one of our names was Boswell, and brought
me a letter left at the inn. It was from Mr.
Thrale, enclosing one to Dr. Johnson. Find∣ing
who I was, we were told they would con∣trive
to lodge us by putting us for a night into
a room with two beds. The waiter said to me
in the broad strong Aberdeenshire dialect, “I
thought I knew you, by your likeness to your
father.”—My father puts up at the New Inn,
when on his circuit. Little was said to-night.
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
I was to sleep in a little press bed in Dr. John∣sons
room. I had it wheeled out into the
dining-room, and there I lay very well.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>22d August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I sent a message to Professor Thomas Gor∣don,
who came and breakfasted with us. He
had secured seats for us at the English chapel.
We found a respectable congregation, and an
admirable organ, well played by Mr. Tait.</P>
<P>We walked down to the shore. Dr. John∣son
laughed to hear that Cromwell's soldiers
taught the Aberdeen people to make shoes and
stockings, and to plant cabbages. He asked,
if weaving the plaids was ever a domestick art
in the Highlands, like spinning or knitting.
He could not be informed here. But he con∣jectured
probably, that where people lived so
remote from each other it would be a domes∣tick
art, as we see it was among the ancients
from <HI>Penelope.</HI> I was sensible to day, to an ex∣traordinary
degree, of Dr. Johnson's excellent
English pronunciation. I cannot account for
its striking me more now than any other
day: But it was as if new to me; and I listen∣ed
to every sentence which he spoke, as to a
musical composition. Professor Gordon gave
him an account of the plan of education in his
college. Dr. Johnson said, it was similar to
that at Oxford.—Waller the poet's great grand∣son
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
was studying here. Dr. Johnson wondered
that a man should send his son so far off, when
there were so many good schools in England.
He said, “At a great school there is all the
splendour and illumination of many minds;
the radiance of all is concentrated in each, or
at least reflected upon each. But we must own
that neither a dull boy, nor an idle boy, will
do so well at a great school as at a private one.
For at a great school there are always boys
enough to do well easily, who are sufficient to
keep up the credit of the school; and after
whipping being tried to no purpose, the dull or
idle boys are left at the end of a class, having
the appearance of going through the course, but
learning nothing at all. Such boys may do
good at a private school, where constant atten∣tion
is paid to them, and they are watched.
So that the question of publick or private edu∣cation
is not properly a general one; but
whether one or the other is best for <HI>my son.</HI>”</P>
<P>We were told this Mr. Waller was a
plain country gentleman; and his son would be
such another. I observed a family could not
expect a poet but in a hundred generations.—
“Nay (said Dr. Johnson) not one family in a
hundred can expect a poet in a hundred gene∣rations.”
He then repeated Dryden's cele∣brated
lines,
<Q><L>Three poets in three distant ages born, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
and a part of a Latin translation of it done at
Oxford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><DATE>London, 2d May, 1778.</DATE>
<P>Dr. Johnson acknowledged that he was himself the author of the translation above alluded to, and dictated it to me as follows:</P>
<Q><L>Quos laudet vates Graius Romanus et Anglus</L>
<L>Tres tria temporibus secla dedere suis.</L>
<L>Sublime ingenium Graius; Romanus habebat</L>
<L>Carmen grande sonans; Anglus utrumque tulit.</L>
<L>Nil majus Natura capit: clarare priores</L>
<L>Quae potuere duos tertius unus habet.</L></Q></NOTE>: he did not then say by whom.</P>
<P>He received a card from Sir Alexander Gor∣don,
who had been his acquaintance twenty
years ago in London, and who, “if forgiven
for not answering a line from him,” would
come in the afternoon. Dr. Johnson rejoiced
to hear of him, and begged he would come and
dine with us. I was much pleased to see the
kindness with which Dr. Johnson received his
old friend Sir Alexander; a gentleman of good
family, <HI>Lismore,</HI> but who had not the estate.
The King's College here made him Professor of
Medicine, which affords him a decent sub∣sistence.
He told us Aberdeen exported stock∣ings
to the value of a hundred thousand pounds
in peace, and to one hundred and seventy in
war. Dr. Johnson asked, What made the dif∣ference?
Here we had a proof of the different
sagacity of the two professors. Sir Alexander
answered, “Because there is more occasion for
them in war.” Professor Thomas answered,
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
“Because the Germans, who are our great
rivals in the manufacture of stockings, are
otherwise employed in time of war.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Sir, you have given a very good solution.”</P>
<P>At dinner, Dr. Johnson eat several plate-fulls
of Scotch broth, with barley and peas in it, and
seemed very fond of the dish. I said, “You
never eat it before.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir; but
I don't care how soon I eat it again.”—My
cousin, Miss Dallas, formerly of Inverness, was
married to Mr. Riddoch, one of the ministers
of the English chapel here. He was ill, and
confined to his room; but she sent us a kind in∣vitation
to tea, which we all accepted She was
the same lively, sensible, cheerful woman, as
ever. Dr. Johnson here threw out some jokes
against Scotland. He said, “You go first to
Aberdeen; then to <HI>Enbru</HI> (the Scots pronuncia∣tion
of Edinburgh); then to Newcastle, to be
polished by the colliers; then to York; then
to London.” And he laid hold of a little girl,
Stuart Dallas, niece to Mrs. Riddoch, and, re∣presenting
himself as a giant, said, he would take
her with him! telling her, in a hollow voice,
that he lived in a cave, and had a bed in the
rock, and she should have a little bed cut op∣posite
to it!▪</P>
<P>He thus treated the point, as to prescrip∣tion
of murder in Scotland. “A jury in
England would make allowance for deficiencies
of evidence,” on account of lapse of time; but
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
a general rule that a crime should not be
punished, or tried for the purpose of punish∣ment,
after twenty years, is bad: It is
cant to talk of the King's advocate delaying a
prosecution from malice. How unlikely is it
the King's advocate should have malice against
people who commit murder, or should even
know them at all.—If the son of the
murdered man should kill the murderer who
got off merely by prescription, I would help
him to make his escape; though, were I upon
his jury, I would not acquit him. I would not
advise him to commit such an act. On the con∣trary,
I would bid him submit to the determi∣nation
of society, because a man is bound to
submit to the inconveniences of it, as he enjoys
the good: but the young man, though politi∣cally
wrong, would not be morally wrong. He
would have to say, “Here I am amongst bar∣barians,
who not only refuse to do justice, but
encourage the greatest of all crimes. I am
therefore in a state of nature: for, so far as
there is no law, it is a state of nature: and con∣sequently,
upon the eternal and immutable law
of justice, which requires that he who sheds
man's blood should have his blood shed, I will
stab the murderer of my father.”</P>
<P>We went to our inn, and sat▪ quietly. Dr.
Johnson borrowed, at Mr. Riddoch's, a volume
of <HI>Massillon's</HI> Discourses on the Psalms. But I
found he read little in it. Ogden too he some∣times
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
took up, and glanced at; but threw it
down again. I then entered upon religious
conversation. Never did I see him in a better
frame: calm, gentle, wise, holy.—I said,
“Would not the same objection hold against
the Trinity as against Transubstantiation?”—
“Yes, (said he) if you take three and one in the
same sense. If you do so, to be sure you cannot
believe it: but the three persons in the Godhead
are Three in one sense, and One in another.
We cannot tell how; and that is the mystery!”</P>
<P>I spoke of the satisfaction of Christ. He said
his notion was, that it did not attone for the
sins of the world; but, by satisfying divine
justice, by shewing that no less than the Son of
God suffered for sin, it shewed to men and in∣numerable
created beings, the heinousness of
it, and therefore rendered it unnecessary for
divine vengeance to be exercised against sinners,
as it otherwise must have been; that in this way
it might operate even in favour of those who
had never heard of it: as to those who did hear
of it, the effect it should produce would be re∣pentance
and piety, by impressing upon the
mind a just notion of sin; that original sin was
the propensity to evil, which no doubt was
occasioned by the fall. He presented this
solemn subject in a new light to me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My worthy, intelligent, and candid friend, Dr. <HI>Kippis,</HI> informs me, that several divines have thus explained the me∣diation of our Saviour. What Dr. Johnson now delivered, was but a temporary opinion; for he afterwards was fully convinced of the <HI>propitiatory sacrifice,</HI> as I shall shew at large in my future work, “THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, L. L. D.”</NOTE>, and ren∣dered
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
much more rational and clear the doctrine
of what our Saviour has done for us;—as it re∣moved
the notion of imputed righteousness in
co-operating, whereas by this view, Christ has
done all already that he had to do, or is ever
to do, for mankind, by making his great satis∣faction;
the consequences of which will affect
each individual according to the particular
conduct of each. I would illustrate this by
saying, that Christ's satisfaction resembles a
sun placed to shew light to men, so that it de∣pends
upon themselves whether they will walk
the right way or not, which they could not have
done without that sun, “<HI>the sun of righteousness.</HI>”
There is, however, more in it than merely
giving light—<HI>a light to lighten the Gentiles.</HI> For
we are told there is <HI>healing under his wings.</HI>
Dr. Johnson said to me, “Richard Baxter
commends a treatise by Grotius, <HI>De Satisfac∣tione
Christi.</HI> I have never read it: but I intend to
read it; and you may read it.” I remarked, upon
the principle now laid down, we might explain
the difficult and seemingly hard text, “They
that believe shall be saved; and they that be∣lieve
not shall be damned:” They that believe
shall have such an impression made upon their
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
minds, as will make them act so that they
shall be accepted by GOD.</P>
<P>We talked of one of our friends taking ill,
for a length of time, a hasty expression of
Dr. Johnson's to him, on his introducing, in a
mixed company, a religious subject so unsea∣sonably
as to provoke a rebuke.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“What is to come of society, if a friendship of
twenty years is to be broken off for such a
cause?” As Bacon says,</P>
<Q><L>“Who then to frail mortality shall trust,</L>
<L>But limns the water, or but writes in dust.”</L></Q>
<P>I said, he should write expressly in support of
Christianity; for that, although a reverence
for it shines through his works in several places,
that is not enough. “You know (said I)
what Grotius has done, and what Addison has
done.—You should do also.”—He replied, “I
hope I shall.”</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>23d August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Principal Campbell, Sir Alexander Gordon,
Professor Gordon, and Professor Ross, visited
us in the morning, as did Dr. Gerard, who had
come in six miles from the country on purpose.
We went and saw the Marischal College<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Beattie was so kindly entertained in England, that he had not yet returned home.</NOTE>, and
at one o'clock we waited on the magistrates in
the town-hall, as they had invited us in order to
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
present Dr. Johnson with the freedom of the
town, which Provost Jopp did with a very good
grace. Dr. Johnson was much pleased with
this mark of attention, and received it very
politely. There was a pretty numerous com∣pany
assembled. It was striking to hear all of
them drinking “Dr. Johnson!” Dr. Johnson!▪
in the town-hall of Aberdeen, and then to see
him with his burgess-ticket, or diploma<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Johnson's burgess-ticket was in these words:</P>
<P>“Abredoniae vigesimo tertio die mensis Augusti,” anno Do∣mini millefimo septingentesimo septuagesimo tertio, in presentia honora bilium virorum, Jacobi Jopp, armigeri, praepositi, Adami Duff, Gulielmi Young, Georgii Marr, et Gulielmi Forbes Bullivorum, Gulielmi Rainie, Decani Guildae, et Joannis Nicoll Thesaurii dicti Burgi.</P>
<P>“Quo die Vir generosus et Doctrina clarus, Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. receptus et admissus fuit in municipes et fratres Guildae praefati Burgi de Aberdeen. In deditissimi amoris et affectus ac exemiae observantice tesseram quibus dicti Magis∣tratus eum amplectuntur. Extractum per me,</P>
<Q>ALEX. CARNEGIE,”</Q></NOTE> in his
hat, which he wore as he walked along the
street, according to the usual custom.—It gave
me great satisfaction to observe the regard, and
indeed fondness too, which every body here
had for my father.</P>
<P>While Sir Alexander Gordon conducted
Dr. Johnson to old Aberdeen, Professor Gordon
and I called on Mr. Riddoch, whom I found
to be a grave worthy clergyman. He observed,
that, whatever might be said of Dr. Johnson
while he was alive, he would, after he was
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
dead, be looked upon by the world with regard
and astonishment, on account of his Dictionary.</P>
<P>Professor Gordon and I walked over to the
Old College, which Dr. Johnson had seen by
this time. I stepped into the chapel, and
looked at the tomb of the founder, Archbishop
Elphinston, of whom I shall have occasion to
write in my History of James IV. of Scotland,
the patron of my family.</P>
<P>We dined at Sir Alexander Gordon's. The
Provost, Professor Ross, Professor Dunbar, Pro∣fessor
Thomas Gordon, were there. After
dinner came in Dr. Gerard, Professor Leslie,
Professor Macleod. We had had little or no
conversation in the morning; now we were but
barren. The professors seemed afraid to speak.</P>
<P>Dr. Gerard told us that an eminent printer
was very intimate with Warburton.—“<HI>Johnson.</HI>
Why, Sir, he has printed some of his works,
and perhaps bought the property of some of
them. The intimacy is such as one of the
professors here may have with one of the car∣penters
who is repairing the college.”—“But
(said <HI>Gerard)</HI> I saw a letter from him to this
printer, in which he says, that the one half of
the clergy of the church of Scotland are fana∣ticks,
and the other half infidels.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Warburton has accustomed himself to write
letters just as he speaks, without thinking any
more of what he throws out. When I read
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
Warburton first, and observed his force, and
his contempt of mankind, I thought he had
driven the world before him; but I soon
found that was not the case; for Warburton,
by his extending his abuse, rendered it inef∣fectual.”</P>
<P>He told me, when we were by ourselves,
that he thought it very wrong in the printer,
to shew Warburton's letter, as it was raising a
body of enemies against him. He thought it
foolish in Warburton to write so to the printer;
and added, “Sir, the worst way of being inti∣mate,
is by scribbling.” He called Warbur∣ton's
“Essay on Grace” a poor performance▪
and so he said was Wesley's “Answer.” “War∣burton,
he observed, had laid himself very
open. In particular, he was weak enough to
say, that, in some disorders of the imagination,
people had spoken with tongues, had spoken
with languages which they never knew before;
a thing as absurd as to say, that, in some dis∣orders
of the imagination, people had been
known to fly.”</P>
<P>I talked of the difference of genius, to try if
I could engage Gerard in a disquisition with
Dr. Johnson; but I did not succeed. I men∣tioned,
as a curious fact, that Lock had written
verses.—<HI>Johnson,</HI> “I know of none, Sir, but a
kind of exercise prefixed to Dr. Sydenham's
Works, in which he has some conceits about
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
the dropsy; in which water and burning are
united: and how Dr. Sydenham removed fire
by drawing off water, contrary to the usual
practice, which is to extinguish fire by bringing
water upon it.—I am not sure that there is a
word of all this; but it is such kind of talk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All this, as Dr. Johnson suspected at the time, was the immediate invention of his own lively imagination; for there is not one word of it in Mr. Lock's complimentary per∣formance. My readers will, I have no doubt, like to be satisfied, by comparing them; and, at any rate, it may entertain to read verses composed by our great metaphysician, when a Bachelor in Physick.

<P><PB N="97" REF="103"/>
We spoke of Fingal. Dr. Johnson said
calmly, “If the poems were really translated,”
they were certainly first written down. Let
Mr. Macpherson deposit the manuscript in one
of the colleges at Aberdeen, where there are
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
people who can judge; and, if the professors
certify the authenticity, then there will be an
end of the controversy. If he does not take
this obvious and easy method, he gives the best
reason to doubt; considering too, how much is
against it <HI>à priori.</HI></P>
<P>We sauntered after dinner in Sir Alexander's
garden, and saw his little grotto, which is
hung with pieces of poetry written in a fair
hand. It was agreeable to observe the content∣ment
and kindness of this quiet, benevolent
man. Professor Macleod was brother to Mac∣leod
of Talisker, and brother-in-law to the
Laird of Coll. He gave me a letter to young
Coll. I was weary of this day, and began to
think wishfully of being again in motion. I
was uneasy to think myself too fastidious, whilst
I fancied Dr. Johnson quite satisfied. But he
owned to me that he was fatigued and teased,
by Sir Alexander's doing too much to entertain
him. I said, it was all kindness.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“True, Sir: but sensation is sensation.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “It is so: we feel pain equally from
the surgeon's probe, as from the sword of the
foe.”</P>
<P>We visited two booksellers' shops, and could
not find Arthur Johnston's Poems. We went
and sat near an hour at Mr. Riddoch's. He
could not tell distinctly how much education at
the college here costs, which disgusted Dr.
Johnson. I had pledged myself that we should
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
go to the inn, and not stay supper. They
pressed us, but he was resolute. I saw Mr.
Riddoch did not please him. He said to me,
afterwards, “Sir, he has no vigour in his talk.”
But my friend should have considered that he
himself was not in good humour; so that it
was not easy to talk to his satisfaction.—We
sat contentedly at our inn. He then became
merry, and observed how little we had either
heard or said at Aberdeen. That the Aberdo∣nians
had not started a single <HI>mawkin</HI> (the Scot∣tish
word for hare) for us to pursue.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>24th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We set out about eight in the morning,
and breakfasted at Ellon. The landlady said to
me, “Is not this the great Doctor that is going
about through the country?”—I said, “Yes.”
—“Aye, (said she) we heard of him, I made
an errand into the room on purpose to see him.
There's something great in his appearance. It
is a pleasure to have such a man in one's house;
a man who does so much good. If I had
thought of it, I would have shewn him a child
of mine who has had a lump on his throat for
some time.”—“But (said I) he is not a doctor of
physick.”—“Is he an oculist?” said the
landlord.—“No, (said I) he is only a
very learned man.”—<HI>Landlord.</HI> “They say
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
he is the greatest man in England, except
Lord Mansfield.”—Dr. Johnson was highly en∣tertained
with this, and I do think he was
pleased too. He said, “I like the exception:
to have called me the greatest man in England,
would have been an unmeaning compliment.
But the exception marked that the praise was in
earnest; and, in Scotland, the exception must
be <HI>Lord Mansfield,</HI> or—<HI>Sir John Pringle.</HI>”</P>
<P>He told me a good story of Dr. Goldsmith.
Graham, who wrote “Telemachus, a Masque,”
was sitting one night with him and Dr. John∣son,
and was half drunk. He rattled away
to Dr. Johnson: “You are a clever fellow, to
be sure; but you cannot write an essay like
Addison, or verses like the <HI>Rape of the Lock.</HI>”
At last he said, “<HI>Doctor,</HI> I should be happy to
see you at Eaton.”—“I shall be glad to wait on
you,” answered Goldsmith.—“No (said Gra∣ham)
'tis not you I meant, Dr. <HI>Minor;</HI> 'tis Dr.
<HI>Major,</HI> there.”—Goldsmith was excessively
hurt by this. He afterwards spoke of it him∣self.
“Graham (said he) is a fellow to make one
commit suicide.”</P>
<P>We had received a polite invitation to Slains
castle. We arrived there just at three o'clock,
as the bell for dinner was ringing. Though,
from its being just on the North-east Ocean, no
trees will grow here, Lord Errol has done all
that can be done. He has cultivated his fields
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
so as to bear rich crops of every kind, and he
has made an excellent kitchen-garden, with a
hot-house. I had never seen any of the family.
But there had been a card of invitation written
by the honourable Charles Boyd, the earl's
brother. We were conducted into the house,
and at the dining-room door were met by that
gentleman, whom both of us at first took to be
Lord Errol; but he soon corrected our mistake.
My lord was gone to dine in the neighbour∣hood,
at an entertainment given by Mr. Irvine
of Drum. Lady Errol received us politely,
and was very attentive to us during the time of
dinner. There was nobody at table but her
ladyship, Mr. Boyd, and some of the children,
their governor and governess. Mr. Boyd put
Dr. Johnson in mind of having dined with him
at Cummin the Quaker's, along with a Mr.
Hall and Miss Williams. This was a bond of
connection between them. For me, Mr. Boyd's
acquaintance with my father was enough. After
dinner, Lady Errol favoured us with a sight of
her young family, whom she made stand up in
a row. There were six daughters and two sons.
It was a very pleasing sight.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson proposed our setting out. Mr.
Boyd said, he hoped we should stay all night;
his brother would be at home in the evening,
and would be very sorry if he missed us. Mr.
Boyd was called out of the room. I was very
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
desirous to stay in so comfortable a house, and
I wished to see Lord Errol. Dr. Johnson, how∣ever,
was right in resolving to go, if we were
not asked again, as it is best to err on the safe
side in such cases, and to be sure that one is
quite welcome. To my great joy, when Mr.
Boyd returned, he told Dr. Johnson that it was
Lady Errol who had called him out, and said
that she would never let Dr. Johnson into the
house again, if he went away that night; and
that she had ordered the coach, to carry us to
view a great curiosity on the coast, after which
we should see the house. We cheerfully agreed.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyd was engaged, in 1745-6, on the
same side with many unfortunate mistaken no∣blemen
and gentlemen. He escaped, and lay
concealed for a year in the island of Arran, the
ancient territory of the Boyds. He then went
to France, and was about twenty years on the
continent. He married a French Lady, and
now lived very comfortably at Aberdeen, and
was much at Slains castle. He entertained us
with great civility. He had a pompousness or
formal plenitude in his conversation, which I
did not dislike. Dr. Johnson said, “there
was too much elaboration in his talk.” It gave
me pleasure to see him, a steady branch of the
family, setting forth all its advantages with much
zeal. He told us that Lady Errol was one of the
most pious and sensible women in the island;
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
had a good head, and as good a heart. He
said, she did not use force or fear in educating
her children—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, she is wrong; I
would rather have the rod to be the general
terror to all, to make them learn, than tell a
child, if you do thus or thus, you will be more
esteemed than your brothers or sisters. The rod
produces an effect which terminates in itself.
A child is afraid of being whipt, and gets his
task, and there's an end on't; whereas, by ex∣citing
emulation, and comparisons of superio∣rity,
you lay the foundation of lasting mischief;
you make brothers and sisters hate each other.”</P>
<P>During Mr. Boyd's stay in Arran, he had
found a chest of medical books, left by a sur∣geon
there, and had read them till he acquired
some skill in physick, in consequence of which
he is often consulted by the poor. There were
several here waiting for him as patients. We
walked round the house till stopped by a cut
made by the influx of the sea. The house is
built quite upon the shore; the windows look
upon the main ocean, and the King of Den∣mark
is Lord Errol's nearest neighbour on the
north-east.</P>
<P>We got immediately into the coach, and
drove to <HI>Dunbui,</HI> a rock near the shore, quite
covered with sea fowls; then to a circular bason
of large extent, surrounded with tremendous
rocks. On the quarter next the sea; there is a
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
high arch in the rock, which the force of the
tempest has driven out. This place is called
<HI>Buchan's Buller,</HI> or the <HI>Buller</HI> of <HI>Buchan,</HI> and
the country people call it the <HI>Pot.</HI> Mr. Boyd
said it was so called from the French <HI>Bouloir.</HI>
It may be more simply traced from <HI>Boiler</HI> in
our own language. We walked round this
monstrous cauldron. In some places, the rock
is very narrow; and on each side there is a
sea deep enough for a man of war to ride in;
so that it is somewhat horrid to move along.
However, there is earth and grass upon the
rock, and a kind of road marked out by the
print of feet; so that one makes it out pretty
safely: yet it alarmed me to see Dr. Johnson
striding irregularly along. He insisted on taking
a boat, and sailing into the Pot. We did so.
He was stout, and wonderfully alert. The
Buchan-men all shewing their teeth, and speak∣ing
with that strange sharp accent which distin∣guishes
them, was to me a matter of curiosity.
He was not sensible of the difference of pro∣nunciation
in the South, and North of Scot∣land,
which I wondered at.</P>
<P>As the entry into the <HI>Buller</HI> is so narrow that
oars cannot be used as you go in, the method
taken is, to row very hard when you come near
it, and give the boat such a rapidity of motion
that it glides in. Dr. Johnson observed what
an effect this scene would have had, were we
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
entering into an unknown place. There are
caves of considerable depth; I think, one on
each side. The boatmen had never entered
either far enough to know the size. Mr. Boyd
told us that it is customary for the company at
Peterhead well, to make parties, and come
and dine in one of the caves here.</P>
<P>He told us, that, as Slains is at a consider∣able
distance from Aberdeen, Lord Errol, who
has so large a family, resolved to have a surgeon
of his own. With this view he educated one of
his tenants' sons, who is now settled in a very
neat house and farm just by, which we saw
from the road. By the salary which the earl
allows him, and the practice which he has had,
he is in very easy circumstances. He had kept
an exact account of all that had been laid out
on his education, and he came to his lordship
one day, and told him that he had arrived at a
much higher situation than ever he expected;
that he was now able to repay what his lordship
had advanced, and begged he would accept of
it. The earl was pleased with the generous
gratitude and genteel offer of the man; but re∣fused
it.—Mr. Boyd also told us, Cumming the
Quaker first began to distinguish himself, by
writing against Dr. Leechman on Prayer, to
prove it unnecessary, as God knows best what
should be, and will order it without our ask∣ing:
—the old hackneyed objection.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112"/>
When we returned to the house we found
coffee and tea in the drawing room. Lady
Errol was not there, being, as I supposed, en∣gaged
with her young family. There is a bow-window
fronting the sea. Dr. Johnson repeated
the ode, <HI>Jam satis terris,</HI> while Mr. Boyd was
with his patients. He spoke well in favour of
entails, to preserve lives of men whom mankind
are accustomed to reverence. His opinion was,
that so much land should be entailed as that
families should never fall into contempt, and as
much left free as to give them all the advan∣tages
of property in case of any emergency.
“If (said he) the nobility are suffered to sink
into indigence, they of course become cor∣rupt;
they are ready to do whatever the king
chuses; therefore it is fit they should be kept
from becoming poor, unless it is fixed that
when they fall below a certain standard of
wealth they shall lose their peerages. We
know the House of Peers have made noble
stands, when the House of Commons durst
not. The two last years of a parliament they
dare not contradict the populace.”</P>
<P>This room is ornamented with a number of
fine prints, and with a whole length picture of
Lord Errol, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. This
led Dr. Johnson and me to talk of our amiable
and elegant friend, whose panegyrick he con∣cluded
by saying, “Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir,
is the most invulnerable man I know; the man
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith whom, if you should quarrel, you would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the most difficulty how to abuse.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson observed, the situation here was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> noblest he had ever seen,—better than
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lount Edgecumbe, reckoned the first in

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough there is there the grandeur of a fleet,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere is also the impression of there being a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock-yard, the circumstances of which are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot agreeable. At Slains is an excellent old
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse. The noble owner has built of brick,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong the square in the inside, a gallery both
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the first and second story, the house being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o highter; so that he has always a dry

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as no approach but through each other, have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow all separate entries from the gallery, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hung with Hogarth's works, and other prints.
We went and sat a while in the library. There
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a valuable and numerous collection. It was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiefly made by Mr. Falconer, husband to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Countess of Errol in her own right. This
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl has added a good many modern books.</P>
<P>About nine the earl came home. Captain
Gordon of Park was with him. His lordship

in London, along with Mr. Beauclerk. I
was exceedingly pleased with Lord Errol. His
signified person and agreeable countenance,
with the most unaffected affability, gave me high
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
satisfaction. From perhaps a weakness, or, a
I rather hope, more fancy and warmth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
feeling than is quite reasonable, I could, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the most perfect honesty, expatiate on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Errol's good qualities; but he stands in n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
need of my praise. His agreeable look an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
softness of address prevented that constrain
which the idea of his being Lord Hig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Constable of Scotland might otherwise hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
occasioned. He talked very easily and sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sibly
with his learned guest. I observe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that Dr. Johnson, though he shewed tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
respect to his lordship, which, from principle

came to argument, maintained that manlines<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

our superiors, is proper: to seem to yield to

Probably the noble lord had felt with some uneasiness what it was to encounter stronger abilities than his own. If a peer will engage at foils with his inferior in station, he must expect that his inferior in station will avail himself of every advantage; otherwise it is not a fair trial of strength and skill. The same will hold in a contest of reason, or of wit.—A certain king entered the lists of genius with <HI>Voltaire.</HI> The consequence was, that, though the king had great and brillian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> talents, Voltaire had such a superiority that his majesty could not bear it; and the poet was dismissed, or escaped, from tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> court.—In the reign of James I. of England, Crichton, Lord Sanquhar, a peer of Scotland, from a vain ambition to excel a fencing-master in his own art, played at rapier and dagger with him. The fencing-master, whose fame and bread were at stake, put out one of his lordship's eyes. Exasperated at this, Lord Sanquhar hired ruffians, and had the fencing-master assassinated; for which his lordship was capitally tried, condemned, and hanged. Not being a peer of England, he was tried by the name of Robert Crichton, Es{que} But he was admitted to be a baron of three hundred years standing.—See the State Trials; and Hume in his History, who applauds the impartial justice executed upon a man of high rank.</NOTE>.

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecency. He told us a story of a man who was
executed at Perth, some years ago, for mur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ering
a woman who was with child by him,
and a former child he had by her. His hand
was cut off: He was then pulled up; but the
rope broke, and he was forced to lie an hour
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the ground, till another rope was brought
from Perth, the execution being in a wood at
some distance,—at the place where the mur∣ders
were committed. “<HI>There</HI> (said my lord)
<HI>I see the hand of Providence.</HI>”—I was really happy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here. I saw in this nobleman the best dispositions

have urged drinking, as, I believe, he used
formerly to do; but he drank port and
water out of a large glass himself, and let us
do as we pleased. He went with us to our
rooms at night; said, he took the visit very

<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>25th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We got up between seven and eight, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
found Mr. Boyd in the dining-room, with te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and coffee before him, to give us breakfast
We were in an admirable humour. Lady
Errol had given each of us a copy of an ode by
Beattie, on the birth of her son, Lord Hay
Mr. Boyd asked Dr. Johnson how he liked it
Dr. Johnson, who did not admire it, got off very
well, by taking it out, and reading the two
second stanzas with much melody. This
without his saying a word, pleased Mr. Boyd▪
He observed, however, to Dr. Johnson, that
the expression as to the family of Errol,</P>
<Q><L>“A thousand years have seen it shine,”</L></Q>
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
<P>compared with what went before, was an anti∣climax,
and that it would have been better
<Q><L>Ages have seen, &amp;c.</L></Q>
Dr. Johnson said, “So great a number as a
thousand is better. <HI>Dolus latet in universalibus.</HI>
Ages might be only two ages.”—He talked of
the advantage of keeping up the connections of
relationship, which produce much kindness.
“Every man (said he) who comes into the
world, has need of friends. If he has to get
them for himself, half his life is spent, before
his merit is known. Relations are a man's
ready friends, who support him. When a man
is in real distress, he flies into the arms of his
relations. An old lawyer, who had much expe∣rience
in making wills, told me, that after
people had deliberated long, and thought of
many for their executors, they settled at last
by fixing on their relations. This shews the
universality of the principle.”</P>
<P>I regretted the decay of respect for men of
family, and that a Nabob now would carry an
election from them—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir, the
Nabob will carry it by means of his wealth, in
a country where money is highly valued, as it
must be where nothing can be had without
money; but if it comes to personal preference,
the man of family will always carry it. There
is generally a <HI>scoundrelism</HI> about a low man.”
—Mr. Boyd said, that was a good <HI>ism.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="118"/>
I said, I believed mankind were happier in
the ancient feudal state of subordination, than
when in the modern state of independency.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “To be sure, the <HI>Chief</HI> was. But we
must think of the number of individuals. That
<HI>they</HI> were less happy, seems plain; for that state
from which all escape as soon as they can, and
to which none return after they have left it,
must be less happy; and this is the case with
the state of dependance on a chief, or great
man.”</P>
<P>I mentioned the happiness of the French in
their subordination, by the reciprocal benevo∣lence
and attachment between the great and
those in lower ranks.—Mr. Boyd gave us an
instance of their gentlemanly spirit. An
old <HI>Chevalier de Malthe,</HI> of ancient <HI>noblesse,</HI> but
in low circumstances, was in a coffee-house at
Paris, where was <HI>Julien,</HI> the great manufacturer
at the Gobelins, of the fine tapestry, so much
distinguished both for the figures and the <HI>colours.</HI>
The chevalier's carriage was very old. Says
Julien, with a plebeian insolence, “I think,
Sir, you had better have your carriage new
painted.” The chevalier looked at him with
indignant contempt, and answered, “Well,
Sir, you may take it home and <HI>dye</HI> it!”—All
the coffee-house rejoiced at Julien's confusion.</P>
<P>We set out about nine. Dr. Johnson was
curious to see one of those structures which
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
northern antiquarians call a Druid's temple.
I had a recollection of one at Strichen, which
I had seen fifteen years ago; so we went four
miles out of our road, after passing Old Deer,
and went thither. Mr. Fraser, the proprietor,
was at home, and shewed it to us. But I had
augmented it in my mind; for all that remains
is two stones set up on end, with a long one
laid upon them, as was usual, and one stone
at a little distance from them. That stone was
the capital one of the circle which surrounded
what now remains. Mr. Fraser was very hospi∣table
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is the worthy son of a worthy father, the late Lord <HI>Strichen,</HI> one of our judges, to whose kind notice I was much obliged. Lord Strichen was a man not only honest, but highly generous; for, after his succession to the family estate, he paid a large sum of debts contracted by his predecessor, which he was not under any obligation to pay. Let me here, for the credit of <HI>Ayrshire,</HI> my own county, record a noble instance of liberal honesty in <HI>William Hutchison,</HI> drover, in Lanehead, <HI>Kyle,</HI> who formerly obtained a full discharge from his credi∣tors, upon a composition of his debts; but, upon being restored to good circumstances, invited his creditors last winter to a dinner, without telling the reason, and paid them their full sums, principal and interest. They presented him with a piece of plate, with an inscription to commemorate this extraordinary instance of true worth; which should make some people in Scotland blush, while, though mean themselves, they strut about under the protection of great alliance, conscious of the wretchedness of numbers who have lost by them, to whom they never think of making reparation, but indulge themselves and their families in most unsuitable expence.</NOTE>. There was a fair at Strichen; and he
had several of his neighbours from it at dinner.
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
One of them, Dr. Fraser, who had been in the
army, remembred to have seen Dr. Johnson at
a lecture on experimental philosophy, at Lich∣field.
The Doctor recollected being at the
lecture; and he was surprised to find here
somebody who knew him.</P>
<P>Mr. Fraser sent a servant to conduct us by a
short passage into the high road. I observed to
Dr. Johnson, that I had a most disagreeable no∣tion
of the life of country gentlemen: that
I left Mr. Fraser just now, as one leaves a pri∣soner
in a jail.—Dr. Johnson said, that I was
right in thinking them unhappy; for that they
had not enough to keep their minds in motion.</P>
<P>I started a thought this afternoon which
amused us a great part of the way. “If
(said I) our club should come and set up in
St. Andrew's, as a college, to teach all that
each of us can, in the several departments of
learning and taste, we should rebuild the city:
we should draw a wonderful concourse of stu∣dents.”
—Dr. Johnson entered fully into the
spirit of this project. We immediately fell to
distributing the offices. I was to teach civil
and Scotch law; Burke, politicks and elo∣quence;
Garrick, the art of public speaking;
Langton was to be our Grecian, Colman our
Latin professor; Nugent to teach physick;
Lord Charlemont, modern history; Beauclerk,
natural philosophy; Vesey, Irish antiquities,
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
or Celtick learning; Jones, Oriental learning;
Goldsmith, poetry and ancient history; Chamier,
commercial politicks; Reynolds, painting, and
the arts which have beauty for their object;
Chambers, the law of England. Dr. Johnson
at first said, “I'll trust theology to nobody but
myself.” But, upon due consideration, that
Percy is a clergyman, it was agreed that Percy
should teach practical divinity and British anti∣quities;
Dr. Johnson himself, logick, meta∣physicks,
and scholastick divinity. In this
manner did we amuse ourselves;—each suggest∣ing,
and each varying or adding, till the
whole was adjusted. Dr. Johnson said, we
only wanted a mathematician since Dyer died,
who was a very good one; but as to every
thing else, we should have a very capital uni∣versity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our club, formerly at the Turk's Head, Gerrard-street, then at Prince's, Sackville Street, now at Baxter's, Dover-street, which at Mr. Garrick's funeral got a <HI>name</HI> for the first time, and was called THE LITERARY CLUB, has, since 1773, been greatly augmented; and though Dr. Johnson with justice observed, that, by losing Goldsmith, Garrick, Nugent, Chamier, Beauclerk, we had lost what would make an eminent club, yet when I mention, as an accession, Mr. Fox, Dr. George Fordyce, Sir Charles Bunbury, Lord Ossory, Mr. Gibbon, Dr. Adam Smith, Mr. R.

We got at night to Banff. I sent Joseph on
to <HI>Duff-house;</HI> but Earl Fife was not at home,
which I regretted much, as we should have had
a very elegant reception from his lordship. We
found here but an indifferent inn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here, unluckily, the windows had no pullies; and Dr. Johnson, who was constantly eager for fresh air, had much struggling to get one of them kept open. Thus he had a no∣tion impressed upon him, that this wretched defect was general in Scotland. So he has erroneously enlarged upon it in his “Journey.” I regretted that he did not allow me to read over his book before it was printed. I should have changed very little; but I should have suggested an alteration in a few places where he has laid himself open to be attacked. I hope I should have prevailed with him to omit or soften his assertion, that “a Scotsman must be a sturdy moralist, who does not prefer Scotland to truth,”—for I really think it is not founded; and it is harshly said.</NOTE>. Dr. Johnson
wrote a long letter to Mrs. Thrale. I wondered
to see him write so much so easily. He verified
his own doctrine, that “a man may always write
when he will set himself <HI>doggedly</HI> to it.”</P>

<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>26th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We got a fresh chaise here, a very good one,
and very good horses. We breakfasted at
Cullen. They set down dried haddocks
broiled, along with our tea. I eat one; but
Dr. Johnson was disgusted by the sight of them,
so they were removed. Cullen has a comfort∣able
appearance, though but a very small town,
and the houses mostly poor buildings.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123"/>
I called on Mr. Robertson, who has the
charge of Lord Findlater's affairs, and was for∣merly
Lord Monboddo's clerk, was three times
in France with him, and translated Condamine's
Account of the Savage Girl, to which his lord∣ship
wrote a preface, containing several remarks
of his own. Robertson said, he did not believe
so much as his lordship did; that it was plain
to him, the girl confounded what she imagined
with what she remembered: that, besides, she
perceived Condamine and Lord Monboddo
forming theories, and she adapted her story to
them.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson said, “It is a pity to see Lord
Monboddo publish such notions as he has done;
a man of sense, and of so much elegant learn∣ing.
There would be little in a fool doing it;
we should only laugh; but when a wise man
does it, we are sorry. Other people have strange
notions; but they conceal them. If they have
tails, they hide them; but Monboddo is as jealous
of his tail as a squirrel.”—I shall here put down
some more remarks of Dr. Johnson's on Lord
Monboddo, which were not made exactly at this
time, but come in well from connection. He
said, he did not approve of a judge's calling
himself <HI>Farmer</HI> Burnett<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is the custom in Scotland for the judges of the Court of Session to have the title of <HI>lords,</HI> from their estates: thus Mr. <HI>Burnett</HI> is Lord <HI>Monboddo,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Home</HI> was Lord <HI>Kames.</HI> There is something a little aukward in this; for they are de∣nominated in deeds by their <HI>names,</HI> with the addition of “one of the Senators of the College of Justice;” and subscribe their christian and sur-name, as <HI>James Burnett, Henry Home,</HI> even in judicial acts.</NOTE>, and going about with
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
a little round hat. He laughed heartily at his
lordship's saying he was an <HI>enthusiastical</HI> farmer;
“for (said he) what can he do in farming by
his <HI>enthusiasm?</HI>” Here, however, I think Dr.
Johnson mistaken. He who wishes to be suc∣cessful,
or happy, ought to be enthusiastical,
that is to say, very keen in all the occupations
or diversions of life. An ordinary gentleman∣farmer
will be satisfied with looking at his
fields once or twice a day. An enthusiastical
farmer will be constantly employed on them;—
will have his mind earnestly engaged;—will
talk perpetually of them. But Dr. Johnson
has much of the <HI>nil admirari</HI> in smaller con∣cerns.
That survey of life which gave birth to
his <HI>Vanity of Human Wishes</HI> early sobered his
mind. Besides, so great a mind as his cannot
be moved by inferior objects. An elephant
does not run and skip like lesser animals.</P>
<P>Mr. Robertson sent a servant with us, to
shew us through Lord Findlater's wood, by
which our way was shortened, and we saw some
part of his domain, which is indeed admirably
laid out. Dr. Johnson did not chuse to walk
through it. He always said, that he was not
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
come to Scotland to see fine places, of which
there were enough in England; but wild ob∣jects,
—mountains,—water-falls,—peculiar
manners; in short, things which he had not seen
before. I have a notion that he at no time has
had much taste for rural beauties. I have my∣self
very little.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson said, there was nothing more
contemptible than a country gentleman living
beyond his income, and every year growing
poorer and poorer. He spoke strongly of the
influence which a man has by being rich. “A
man (said he) who keeps his money, has in
reality more use from it, than he can have by
spending it.” I observed that this looked very
like a paradox; but he explained it thus:
“If it were certain that a man would keep
his money locked up for ever, to be sure he
would have no influence; but, as so many
want money, and he has the power of giving
it, and they know not but by gaining his fa∣vour
they may obtain it, the rich man will al∣ways
have the greatest influence. He again
who lavishes his money, is laughed at as
foolish, and in a great degree with justice,
considering how much is spent from vanity.
Even those who partake of a man's hospitality,
have but a transient kindness for him. If he
has not the command of money, people know
he cannot help them, if he would; whereas
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
the rich man always can, if he will, and for
the chance of that, will have much weight.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But philosophers and satyrists have
all treated a miser as contemptible.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“He is so philosophically; but not in the
practice of life.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Let me see now:
—I do not know the instances of misers in
England, so as to examine into their influ∣ence.”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “We have had few misers in
England.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “There was Lowther.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir, Lowther, by keeping
his money, had the command of the county,
which the family has now lost, by spending it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not know what was at this time the state of the par∣liamentary interest of the ancient family of Lowther; a family before the Conquest. But all the nation knows it to be very extensive at present. A due mixture of severity and kindness, oeconomy and munificence, characterises its present Representative.</NOTE>.
I take it, he lent a great deal; and that is the
way to have influence, and yet preserve one's
wealth. A man may lend his money upon
very good security, and yet have his debtor
much under his power.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “No doubt,
Sir. He can always distress him for the money;
as no man borrows, who is able to pay on de∣mand
quite conveniently.”</P>
<P>We dined at Elgin, and saw the noble ruins
of the cathedral. Though it rained much, Dr.
Johnson examined them with a most patient
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
attention. He could not here feel any abhor∣rence
at the Scottish reformers, for he had
been told by Lord Hailes, that it was destroyed
before the Reformation, by the Lord of Bade∣noch

The bishop's house, and those of the other
clergy, which are still pretty entire, do not
seem to have been proportioned to the magni∣ficence
of the cathedral, which has been of
great extent, and had very fine carved work.
The ground within the walls of the cathedral is
employed as a burying-place. The family of
Gordon have their vault here; but it has no∣thing
grand.</P>
<P>We passed Gordon Castle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am not sure whether the duke was at home. But, not having the honour of being much known to his grace, I could not have presumed to enter his castle, though to introduce even so celebrated a stranger. We were at any rate in a hurry to get forward to the wildness which we came to see. Perhaps, if this noble family had still preserved that sequestered magni∣ficence which they maintained when catholicks, corresponding with the Grand Duke of Tuscany, we might have been in∣induced to have procured proper letters of introduction, and devoted some time to the contemplation of venerable supersti∣tious state.</NOTE> this forenoon,
which has a princely appearance. Fochabers, the
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
neighbouring village, is a poor place, many of
the houses being ruinous; but it is remarkable,
they have in general orchards well stored with
apple-trees. Elgin has what in England are
called piazzas, that run in many places on each
side of the street. It must have been a much
better place formerly. Probably it had piazzas
all along the town, as I have seen at Bologna.
I approved much of such structures in a town,
on account of their conveniency in wet weather.
Dr. Johnson disapproved of them, “because (said
he) it makes the under story of a house very dark,
which greatly over-balances the conveniency,
when it is considered how small a part of the
year it rains; how few are usually in the street
at such times; that many who are might as
well be at home; and the little that people
suffer, supposing them to be as much wet as
they commonly are in walking a street.”</P>
<P>We fared but ill at our inn here; and Dr.
Johnson said, this was the first time he had
seen a dinner in Scotland that he could not eat.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we drove over the very
heath where Macbeth met the witches, accord∣ing
to tradition. Dr. Johnson again solemnly
repeated—
<Q><L>How far is't called to Fores? What are these,</L>
<L>So wither'd, and so wild in their attire?</L>
<L>That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' earth,</L>
<L>And yet are on't?</L></Q>
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
He repeated a good deal more of Macbeth.
His recitation was grand and affecting, and,
as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed to me, had
no more tone than it should have. It was the
better for it. He then parodied the <HI>All-hail</HI>
of the witches to Macbeth, addressing himself
to me. I had purchased some land called
<HI>Dalblair;</HI> and, as in Scotland it is customary
to distinguish landed men by the name of their
estates, I had thus two titles, <HI>Dalblair</HI> and Young
<HI>Auchinleck.</HI> So my friend, in imitation of
<Q><L>All hail Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!</L></Q>
condescended to amuse himself with uttering
<Q><L>All hail Dalblair! hail to thee, Laird of Auchinleck!</L></Q></P>
<P>We got to Fores at night, and found an
admirable inn, in which Dr. Johnson was
pleased to meet with a landlord who styled him∣self
“Wine-Cooper, from LONDON.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>27th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was dark when we came to Fores last
night; so we did not see what is called King
Duncan's monument. I shall now mark some
gleanings of Dr. Johnson's conversation. I
spoke of <HI>Leonidas,</HI> and said there were some
good passages in it.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, you
must <HI>seek</HI> for them.”—He said, Paul White∣head's
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
<HI>Manners</HI> was a poor performance.—
Speaking of Derrick, he told me “he had a
kindness for him, and had often said, that if
his letters had been written by one of a more
established name, they would have been
thought very pretty letters.”</P>
<P>This morning I introduced the subject of
the origin of evil.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Moral evil is
occasioned by free will,” which implies choice
between good and evil. With all the evil
that there is, there is no man but would rather
be a free agent, than a mere machine without
the evil; and what is best for each individual,
must be best for the whole. If a man would
rather be the machine, I cannot argue with
him. He is a different being from me.—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “A man, as a machine, may have
agreeable sensations; for instance, he may have
pleasure in musick.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir, he
cannot have pleasure in musick, at least no
power of producing musick; for he who can
produce musick may let it alone: he who can
play upon a fiddle may break it; such a man is
not a machine.” This reasoning satisfied me.
It is certain, there cannot be a free agent, unless
there is the power of being evil as well as good.
We must take the inherent possibilities of
things into consideration, in our reasonings or
conjectures concerning the works of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131"/>
We came to Nairn to breakfast. Though a
county town and a royal burgh, it is a miser∣able
place. Over the room where we sat, a
girl was spinning wool with a great wheel, and
singing an Erse song. “I'll warrant you (said
Dr. Johnson) one of the songs of Ossian.” He
then repeated these lines:</P>
<Q><L>Verse sweetens toil, however rude the sound.</L>
<L>All at her work the village maiden sings;</L>
<L>Nor while she turns the giddy wheel around,</L>
<L>Revolves the sad vicissitude of things.</L></Q>
<P>I thought I had heard these lines before.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I fancy not, Sir; for they are in a
detached poem, the name of which I do not
remember, written by one Giffard, a parson.”</P>
<P>I expected Mr. Kenneth M'Aulay, the mini∣ster
of Calder, who published the History of
St. Kilda, a book which Dr. Johnson liked,
would have met us here, as I had written to
him from Aberdeen. But I received a letter
from him, telling me that he could not leave
home, as he was to administer the sacrament
the following Sunday, and earnestly requesting
to see us at his manse. “We'll go,” said
Dr. Johnson; which we accordingly did. Mrs.
M'Aulay received us, and told us her husband
was in the church distributing tokens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Scotland, there is a great deal of preparation before ad∣ministrating the sacrament. The minister of the parish exa∣mines the people as to their fitness, and to those of whom he approves gives little pieces of tin, stamped with the name of the parish, as <HI>tokens,</HI> which they must produce before receiving it. This is a species of priestly power, and sometimes may be abused. I remember a law-suit brought by a person against his parish minister, for refusing him admission to that sacred ordinance.</NOTE>. We
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
arrived between twelve and one o'clock, and
it was near three before he came to us.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson thanked him for his book, and
said “it was a very pretty piece of topography.”
M'Aulay did not seem much to mind the
compliment. From his conversation, Dr.
Johnson was persuaded that he had not written
the book which goes under his name. I myself
always suspected so; and I have been told it
was written by the learned Dr. John M'Pher∣son
of Sky, from the materials collected by
M'Aulay. Dr. Johnson said privately to me,
“There is a combination in it of which
M'Aulay is not capable.” However, he was
exceedingly hospitable; and, as he obligingly
promised us a route for our Tour through the
Western Isles, we agreed to stay with him all
night.</P>
<P>After dinner, we walked to the old castle of
Calder, (pronounced Cawder) the Thane of Caw∣dor's
seat. I was sorry that my friend, this
“prosperous gentleman,” was not there. The
old tower must be of great antiquity. There is a
draw-bridge,—what has been a moat,—and an
ancient court. There is a hawthorn-tree, which
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
rises like a wooden pillar through the rooms of
the castle, for, by a strange conceit, the walls
have been built round it. The thickness of the
walls, the small slaunting windows, and a great
iron door at the entrance on the second story
as you ascend the stairs, all indicate the rude
times in which this castle was erected. There
were here some large venerable trees.</P>
<P>I was afraid of a quarrel between Dr. Johnson
and Mr. M'Aulay, who talked slightingly of
the lower English clergy. The Doctor gave
him a frowning look, and said, “This is a day
of novelties: I have seen old trees in Scotland,
and I have heard the English clergy treated with
disrespect.”</P>
<P>I dreaded that a whole evening at Calder∣manse
would be heavy; however, Mr. Grant,
an intelligent and well-bred minister in the
neighbourhood, was there, and assisted us by
his conversation. Dr. Johnson, talking of he∣reditary
occupations in the Highlands, said,
“There is no harm in such a custom as this;
but it is wrong to enforce it, and oblige a
man to be a taylor or a smith, because his father
has been one.” This custom, however, is not
peculiar to our Highlands: it is well known
that in India a similar practice prevails.</P>
<P>Mr. M'Aulay began a rhapsody against
creeds and confessions. Dr. Johnson shewed
that “what he called <HI>imposition,</HI> was only a volun∣tary
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
declaration of agreement in certain articles
of faith, which a church has a right to require,
just as any other society can insist on certain
rules being observed by it's members. No∣body
is compelled to be of the church, as no∣body
is compelled to enter into a society.”—
This was a very clear and just view of the
subject. But, M'Aulay could not be driven
out of his track. Dr. Johnson said, “Sir, you
are a <HI>bigot to laxness.</HI>”</P>
<P>Mr. M'Aulay and I laid the map of Scotland
before us; and he pointed out a route for us
from Inverness, by Fort Augustus, to Glenelg,
Sky, Mull, Icolmkill, Lorn, and Inveraray,
which I wrote down. As my father was to
begin the northern circuit about the 18th of
September, it was necessary for us either to
make our tour with great expedition, so as to
get to Auchinleck before he set out, or to pro∣tract
it, so as not to be there till his return, which
would be about the 10th of October. By
M'Aulay's calculation, we were not to land in
Lorn till the 20th of September. I thought
that the interruptions by bad days, or by occa∣sional
excursions, might make it ten days later;
and I thought too, that we might perhaps go
to Benbecula, and visit Clanranald, which
would take a week of itself.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson went up with Mr. Grant to the
library, which consisted of a tolerable collection;
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
but the Doctor thought it rather a lady's li∣brary,
with some Latin books in it by chance,
than the library of a clergyman. It had only
two of the Latin fathers, and one of the Greek
ones in Latin. I doubted whether Dr. Johnson
would be present at a Presbyterian prayer. I
told M'Aulay so, and said that the Doctor
might sit in the library while we were at family
worship. M'Aulay said, he would omit it,
rather than give Dr. Johnson offence: But I
would by no means agree that an excess of po∣liteness,
even to so great a man, should prevent
what I esteem as one of the best pious regulations.
I know nothing more beneficial, more comfort∣able,
more agreeable, than that the little socie∣ties
of each family should regularly assemble,
and unite in praise and prayer to our heavenly
Father, from whom we daily receive so much
good, and may hope for more in a higher state
of existence. I mentioned to Dr. Johnson the
over-delicate scrupulosity of our host. He said
he had no objection to hear the prayer. This
was a pleasing surprise to me; for he refused to
go and hear Principal Robertson preach. “I
will hear him, (said he) if he will get up into a
tree and preach; but I will not give a sanction,
by my presence, to a Presbyterian assembly.”</P>
<P>Mr. Grant having prayed, Dr. Johnson
said, his prayer was a very good one; but
objected to his not having introduced the
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
Lord's Prayer. He told us, that an Italian of
some note in London said once to him, “We
have in our service a prayer called the <HI>Pater
Noster,</HI> which is a very fine composition. I
wonder who is the author of it.”—A singular
instance of ignorance in a man of some lite∣rature
and general inquiry!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>28th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. Johnson had brought a Sallust with him
in his pocket from Edinburgh. He gave it
last night to Mr. M'Aulay's son, a smart young
lad about eleven years old. Dr. Johnson had
given an account of the education at Oxford, in
all its gradations. The advantage of being a
servitor to a youth of little fortune struck Mrs.
M'Aulay much. I observed it aloud. Dr.
Johnson very handsomely and kindly said, that,
if they would send their boy to him, when he
was ready for the university, he would get him
made a servitor, and perhaps would do more
for him. He could not promise to do
more; but would undertake for the servitor∣ship
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Johnson did not neglect what he had undertaken. By his interest with the Rev. Dr. Adams, master of Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was educated for some time, he obtained a servitorship for young M'Aulay. But it seems he had other views; and I believe went abroad.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="137"/>
I should have mentioned that Mr. White, a
Welchman, who has been many years factor
<HI>(i. e.</HI> steward) on the estate of Calder, drank
tea with us last night, upon getting a note from
M'Aulay, and asked us to his house. We had
not time to accept of his invitation. He gave
us a letter of introduction to Mr. Ferne, master
of stores at Fort George. He shewed it to me.
It recommended “two celebrated gentlemen;
no less than Dr. Johnson, <HI>author of his Dictionary,</HI>
—and Mr. Boswell, known at Edinburgh by
the name of Paoli.”—He said, he hoped I had
no objection to what he had written; if I had,
he would alter it. I thought it was a pity to
check his effusions, and acquiesced; taking
care, however, to seal the letter, that it might
not appear that I had read it.</P>
<P>A conversation took place, about saying
grace at breakfast (as we do in Scotland) as well
as at dinner and supper; in which Dr. Johnson
said, “It is enough if we have stated seasons of
prayer; no matter when. A man may as well
pray when he mounts his horse, or a woman
when she milks her cow, (which Mr. Grant told
us is done in the Highlands) as at meals; and
custom is to be followed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He could not bear to have it thought that, in any instance whatever, the Scots are more pious than the English. I think grace as proper at breakfast as at any other meal. It is the pleasantest meal we have. Dr. Johnson has allowed the pecu∣liar merit of breakfast in Scotland.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="138"/>
We proceeded to Fort George. When we
came into the square, I sent a soldier with the
letter to Mr. Ferne. He came to us imme∣diately,
and along with him came Major
<HI>Brewse</HI> of the Engineers, pronounced <HI>Bruce.</HI>
He said he believed it was originally the same
Norman name with Bruce. That he had dined
at a house in London, where were three Bruces,
one of the Irish line, one of the Scottish line,
and himself of the English line. He said he
was shewn it in the Herald's office spelt four∣teen
different ways. I told him the different
spellings of my name. Dr. Johnson observed,
that there had been great disputes about the
spelling of Shakspeare's name; at last it was
thought it would be settled by looking at the
original copy of his will; but, upon examining
it, he was found to have written it himself no
less than three different ways.</P>
<P>Mr. Ferne and Major Brewse first carried us
to wait on Sir Eyre Coote, whose regiment,
the 37th, was lying here, and who then com∣manded
the fort. He asked us to dine with
him, which we agreed to do.</P>
<P>Before dinner we examined the fort. The
Major explained the fortification to us, and
Mr. Ferne gave us an account of the stores.
Dr. Johnson talked of the proportions of char∣coal
and salt-petre in making gunpowder, of
granulating it, and of giving it a gloss. He
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
made a very good figure upon these topicks.
He said to me afterward, that “he had talked
<HI>ostentatiously.</HI>”—We reposed ourselves a little in
Mr. Ferne's house. He had every thing in
neat order as in England; and a tolerable
collection of books. I looked into Pennant's
Tour in Scotland. He says little of this fort;
but that “the barracks, &amp;c. form several
streets.” This is aggrandising. Mr. Ferne ob∣served,
if he had said they form a square, with
a row of buildings before it, he would have
given a juster description. Dr. Johnson re∣marked,
“how seldom descriptions correspond
with realities; and the reason is, that people
do not write them till some time after, and
then their imagination has added circum∣stances.”</P>
<P>We talked of Sir Adolphus Oughton. The
Major said, he knew a great deal for a military
man.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, you will find few men,
of any profession, who know more. Sir Adol∣phus
is a very extraordinary man; a man of
boundless curiosity and unwearied diligence.”</P>
<P>I know not how the Major contrived to in∣troduce
the contest between Warburton and
Lowth.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Warburton kept his temper
all along, while Lowth was in a passion. Lowth
published some of Warburton's letters. War∣burton
drew <HI>him</HI> on to write some very abusive
letters, and then asked his leave to publish
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
them; which he knew Lowth could not refuse,
after what <HI>he</HI> had done. So that Warburton
contrived that he should publish, apparently
with Lowth's consent, what could not but shew
Lowth in a disadvantageous light<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here Dr. Johnson gave us part of a conversation held be∣tween a Great Personage and him, in the library at the Queen's Palace, in the course of which this contest was consi∣dered. I have been at great pains to get that conversation as perfectly preserved as possible. It will appear in Dr. Johnson's LIFE.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>At three the drum beat for dinner. I, for a
little while, fancied myself a military man, and
it pleased me. We went to Sir Eyre Coote's,
at the governor's house, and found him a most
gentleman-like man. His lady is a very
agreeable woman, with an uncommonly mild
and sweet tone of voice. There was a pretty
large company: Mr. Ferne, Major Brewse, and
several officers. Sir Eyre had come from the
East-Indies by land, through the Desarts of
Arabia. He told us, the Arabs could live five
days without victuals, and subsist for three
weeks on nothing else but the blood of their
camels, who could lose so much of it as would
suffice for that time, without being exhausted.
He highly praised the virtue of the Arabs;
their fidelity, if they undertook to conduct any
person; and said, they would sacrifice their lives
rather than let him be robbed. Dr. Johnson,
who is always for maintaining the superiority
of civilized over uncivilized men, said, “Why,
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
Sir, I can see no superior virtue in this. A
serjeant and twelve men, who are my guard,
will die, rather than that I shall be robbed.”—
Colonel Pennington, of the 37th regiment,
took up the argument with a good deal of spirit
and ingenuity.—<HI>Pennington.</HI> “But the soldiers
are compelled to this, by fear of punishment.”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Well, Sir, the Arabs are compelled
by the fear of infamy.”—<HI>Pennington.</HI> “The
soldiers have the same fear of infamy, and the
fear of punishment besides; so have less virtue,
because they act less voluntarily.”—Lady
Coote observed very well, that it ought to be
known if there was not, among the Arabs,
some punishment for not being faithful on such
occasions.</P>
<P>We talked of the stage. I observed, that we
had not now such a company of actors as in the
last age; Wilks, Booth, &amp;c. &amp;c.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “You
think so, because there is one who excels all
the rest so much: you compare them with
Garrick, and see the deficiency. Garrick's
great distinction is his universality. He can
represent all modes of life, but that of an easy
fine-bred gentleman.”—<HI>Pennington.</HI> “He should
give over playing young parts.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “He
does not take them now; but he does not leave
off those which he has been used to play, be∣cause
he does them better than any one else
can do them. If you had generations of actors,
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
if they swarmed like bees, the young ones
might drive off the old. Mrs, Cibber, I think,
got more reputation than she deserved, as she
had a great sameness; though her expression
was undoubtedly very fine. Mrs. Clive was
the best player I ever saw. Mrs. Pritchard was a
very good one; but she had something affected
in her manner: I imagine she had some
player of the former age in her eye, which oc∣casioned
it.”</P>
<P>Colonel Pennington said, Garrick sometimes
failed in emphasis; as for instance, in <HI>Hamlet,</HI>
<Q><L>I will speak <HI>daggers</HI> to her; but use <HI>none.</HI></L></Q>
instead of</P>
<Q><L>I will <HI>speak</HI> daggers to her; but <HI>use</HI> none.</L></Q>
<P>We had a dinner of two compleat courses,
variety of wines, and the regimental band of
musick playing in the square, before the win∣dows,
after it. I enjoyed this day much. We
were quite easy and cheerful. Dr. Johnson
said, “I shall always remember this fort with
gratitude.” I could not help being struck
with some admiration, at finding upon this
barren sandy point, such buildings,—such a
dinner,—such company. It was like enchant∣ment.
Dr. Johnson, on the other hand, said to
me more rationally, that “it did not strike
<HI>him</HI> as any thing extraordinary; because he
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
knew, here was a large sum of money expended
in building a fort; here was a regiment. If
there had been less than what we found, it
would have surprized him.” <HI>He</HI> looked coolly
and deliberately through all the gradations.
My warm imagination jumped from the barren
sands to the splendid dinner and brilliant com∣pany.
Like the hero in <HI>Love in a Hollow Tree,</HI></P>
<Q><L>“Without ands of ifs,</L>
<L>I leapt from off the sands upon the cliffs.”</L></Q>
<P>The whole scene gave me a strong impression of
the power and excellence of human art.</P>
<P>We left the fort between six and seven
o'clock. Sir Eyre Coote, Colonel Pennington,
and several more, accompanied us down stairs,
and saw us into our chaise. There could not
be greater attention paid to any visitors. Sir
Eyre spoke of the hardships which Dr. Johnson
had before him.—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Considering what
he has said of us, we must make him feel some∣thing
rough in Scotland.”—Sir Eyre said to
him, “You must change your name, Sir.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Aye, to Dr. M'Gregor.”</P>
<P>We got safely to Inverness, and put up at
Mackenzie's inn. Mr. Keith, the collector of
Excise here, my old acquaintance at Ayr, who
had seen us at the Fort, visited us in the evening,
and engaged us to dine with him next day,
promising to breakfast with us, and take us
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
to the English chapel; so that we were at once
commodiously arranged.</P>
<P>Not finding a letter here that I expected, I
felt a momentary impatience to be at home.
Transient clouds darkened my imagination,
and in those clouds I saw events from which I
shrunk; but a sentence or two of the <HI>Rambler's</HI>
conversation gave me firmness, and I con∣sidered
that I was upon an expedition for
which I had wished for years, and the recollec∣tion
of which would be a treasure to me for
life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>29th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Keith breakfasted with us. Dr. Johnson
expatiated rather too strongly upon the benefits
derived to Scotland from the Union, and the
bad state of our people before it. I am enter∣tained
with his copious exaggeration upon that
subject; but I am uneasy when people are by,
who do not know him as well as I do, and may
be apt to think him narrow-minded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that Dr. Johnson read this gentle re∣monstrance, and took no notice of it to me.</NOTE>. I there∣fore
diverted the subject.</P>
<P>The English chapel, to which we went this
morning, was but mean. The altar was a
bare fir table, with a coarse stool for kneeling
on, covered with a piece of thick sail-cloth
doubled, by way of cushion. The congrega∣tion
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
was small. Mr. Tait, the clergyman,
read prayers very well, though with much of
the Scotch accent. He preached on “<HI>Love
your Enemies.</HI>” It was remarkable that, when
talking of the connections amongst men, he
said, that some connected themselves with men
of distinguished talents, and since they could
not equal them, tried to deck themselves with
their merit, by being their companions. The
sentence was to this purpose. It had an odd
coincidence with what might be said of my
connecting myself with Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>After church, we walked down to the Quay.
We then went to Macbeth's castle. I had a
romantick satisfaction in seeing Dr. Johnson
actually in it. It perfectly corresponds with
Shakspeare's description, which Sir Joshua
Reynolds has so happily illustrated, in one of
his notes on our immortal poet:</P>
<Q><L>“This castle hath a pleasant seat: the air</L>
<L>Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself</L>
<L>Unto our gentle sense,” &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Just as we came out of it, a raven perched on
one of the chimney tops, and croaked. Then
I repeated</P>
<Q><L>—“The raven himself is hoarse,</L>
<L>That croaks the fatal enterance of Duncan</L>
<L>Under my battlements.”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="140" REF="146"/>
We dined at Mr. Keith's. Mrs. Keith was
rather too attentive to Dr. Johnson, asking him
many questions about his drinking only water.
He repressed that observation, by saying to
me, “You may remember that Lady Errol
took no notice of this.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson has the happy art (for which I
have heard my father praise the old Earl of
Aberdeen) of instructing himself, by making
every man he meets tell him something of
what he knows best. He led Keith to talk to
him of the Excise in Scotland, and, in the
course of conversation, mentioned that his
friend Mr. Thrale, the great brewer, paid
twenty thousand pounds a year to the revenue;
and that he had four casks, each of which holds
sixteen hundred barrels,—above a thousand
hogsheads.</P>
<P>After this there was little conversation that
deserves to be remembered. I shall therefore
here again glean what I have omitted on
former days. Dr. Gerrard, at Aberdeen, told
us, that when he was in Wales, he was shewn
a valley inhabited by Danes, who still retain
their own language, and are quite a distinct
people. Dr. Johnson thought it could not be
true, or all the kingdom must have heard of it.
He said to me, as we travelled, “these people,
Sir, that Gerrard talks of, may have somewhat
of a <HI>peregrinity</HI> in their dialect, which relation
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
has augmented to a different language.” I
asked him if <HI>peregrinity</HI> was an English word?
He laughed, and said, “No.” I told him
this was the second time that I had heard him
coin a word. When Foote broke his leg, I
observed that it would make him fitter for
taking off George Faulkner as Peter Paragraph,
poor George having a wooden leg. Dr. John∣son
at that time said, “George will rejoice at
the <HI>depeditation</HI> of Foote;” and when I chal∣lenged
that word, laughed, and owned he had
made it; and added that he had not made
above three or four in his Dictionary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When upon the subject of this <HI>peregrinity,</HI> he told me some particulars concerning the compilation of his Dictionary, and concerning his throwing off Lord Chesterfield's patronage, of which very erroneous accounts have been circulated. These particulars, with others which he afterwards gave me,—as also his celebrated letter to Lord Chesterfield, which he dictated to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,—I reserve for his “LIFE.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having conducted Dr. Johnson to our inn,
I begged permission to leave him for a little,
that I might run about and pay some short vi∣sits
to several good people of Inverness. He
said to me, “You have all the old-fashioned
principles, good and bad.”—I acknowledge I
have. That of attention to relations in the
remotest degree, or to worthy persons in every
state whom I have once known, I inherit from
my father. It gave me much satisfaction to
hear every body at Inverness speak of him with
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
uncommon regard.—Mr. Keith and Mr. Grant,
whom we had seen at Mr. M'Aulay's, supped
with us at the inn. We had roasted kid, which
Dr. Johnson had never tasted before. He re∣lished
it much.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>30th August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This day we were to begin our <HI>equitation,</HI> as
I said; for <HI>I</HI> would needs make a word too.
It is remarkable, that my noble, and to me most
constant friend, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> (who,
if there is too much ease on my part, will be
pleased to pardon what his benevolent, gay,
social intercourse, and lively correspondence,
have insensibly produced) has since hit upon
the very same word. The title of the first
edition of his lordship's very useful book was,
in simple terms, “A Method of breaking
Horses, and teaching Soldiers to ride.” The
title of the second edition is, “MILITARY
EQUITATION.”</P>
<P>We might have taken a chaise to Fort Au∣gustus;
but, had we not hired horses at Inver∣ness,
we should not have found them afterwards.
So we resolved to begin here to ride. We
had three horses, for Dr. Johnson, myself, and
Joseph, and one which carried our portman∣teaus,
and two Highlanders who walked along
with us, John Gray and Lauchlan Vass, whom
Dr. Johnson has remembered with credit in his
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
JOURNEY, though he has omitted their names.
Dr. Johnson rode very well.</P>
<P>About three miles beyond Inverness, we saw,
just by the road, a very compleat specimen of
what is called a Druid's temple. There was a
double circle, one of very large, the other of
smaller stones. Dr. Johnson justly observed, that,
“to go and see one druidical temple is only to see
that it is nothing, for there is neither art nor
power in it; and seeing one is quite enough.”</P>
<P>It was a delightful day. Lochness, and the
road upon the side of it, shaded with birch
trees, and the hills above it, pleased us much.
The scene was as sequestered and agreeably
wild as could be desired, and for a time en∣grossed
all our attention.</P>
<P>To see Dr. Johnson in any new situation is
always an interesting object to me; and, as I
saw him now for the first time on horse-back,
jaunting about at his ease in quest of pleasure
and novelty, the very different occupations of
his former laborious life, his admirable produc∣tions,
his <HI>London,</HI> his <HI>Rambler,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. im∣mediately
presented themselves to my mind,
and the contrast made a strong impression on
my imagination.</P>
<P>When we had advanced a good way by the
side of Lochness, I perceived a little hut, with
an old-looking woman at the door of it. I
thought here might be a scene that would
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
amuse Dr. Johnson; so I mentioned it to him.
“Let's go in,” said he. So we dismounted,
and we and our guides entered the hut. It
was a wretched little hovel of earth only, I
think, and for a window had only a small hole,
which was stopped with a piece of turf, that was
taken out occasionally to let in light. In the
middle of the room or space which we entered,
was a fire of peat, the smoke going out at a
hole in the roof. She had a pot upon it, with
goat's flesh, boiling. There was at one end
under the same roof, but divided by a kind
of partition made of wattles, a pen or fold in
which we saw a good many kids.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was curious to know where she
slept. I asked one of the guides, who ques∣tioned
her in Erse. She answered with a tone
of emotion, saying, (as he told us) she was
afraid we wanted to go to bed to her. This
<HI>coquetry,</HI> or whatever it may be called, of so
wretched a being, was truly ludicrous. Dr.
Johnson and I afterwards were merry upon it.
I said, it was he who alarmed the poor woman's
virtue.—“No, Sir, (said he) she'll say, “there
came a wicked young fellow, a wild dog,” who
I believe would have ravished me, had there
not been with him a grave old gentleman, who
repressed him: but when he gets out of the
sight of his tutor, I'll warrant you he'll spare
no woman he meets, young or old.”—“No,”
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
Sir, (I replied) she'll say, “There was a terrible
ruffian who would have forced me, had it not
been for a civil decent young man, who,
I take it, was an angel sent from heaven to
protect me.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson would not hurt her delicacy, by
insisting on “seeing her bed chamber,” like
<HI>Archer</HI> in the <HI>Beaux Stratagem.</HI> But my curi∣osity
was more ardent; I lighted a piece of
paper, and went into the place where the bed
was. There was a little partition of wicker,
rather more neatly done than the one for the
fold, and close by the wall was a kind of bed∣stead
of wood with heath upon it by way of
bed; at the foot of which I saw some sort of
blankets or covering rolled up in a heap. The
woman's name was Fraser; so was her hus∣band's.
He was a man of eighty. Mr. Fraser
of Balnain allows him to live in this hut, and
keep sixty goats, for taking care of his woods,
where he then was. They had five children, the
eldest only thirteen. Two were gone to In∣verness
to buy meal; the rest were looking
after the goats. This contented family had
four stacks of barley, twenty-four sheaves in
each. They had a few fowls. We were informed
that they lived all the spring without meal,
upon milk and curds and whey alone. What
they get for their goats, kids, and fowls, main∣tains
them during the rest of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152"/>
She asked us to sit down and take a dram.
I saw one chair. She said, she was as happy
as any woman in Scotland. She could hardly
speak any English, except a few detached
words. Dr. Johnson was pleased at seeing,
for the first time, such a state of human life.
She asked for snuff. It is her luxury, and she
uses a great deal. We had none; but gave her
sixpence a piece. She then brought out her
whisky bottle. I tasted it; as did Joseph
and our guides. So I gave her sixpence
more. She sent us away with many prayers in
Erse.</P>
<P>We dined at a little publick house called
the <HI>General's</HI> Hut, from General Wade, who
was lodged there when he commanded in the
North. Near it is the meanest parish <HI>Kirk</HI> I
ever saw. It is a shame it should be on a high
road. After dinner, we passed through a
good deal of mountainous country. I had
known Mr. Trapaud, the deputy governour of
Fort Augustus, twelve years ago, at a circuit
at Inverness, where my father was judge. I
sent forward one of our guides, and Joseph,
with a card to him, that he might know Dr.
Johnson and I were coming up, leaving it to
him to invite us or not. It was dark when we
arrived. The inn was wretched. Government
ought to build one, or give the resident gover∣nour
an additional salary; as, in the present state
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
of things, he must necessarily be put to a great
expence in entertaining travellers. Joseph
announced to us, when we alighted, that the
governour waited for us at the gate of the fort.
We walked to it. He met us, and with much
civility conducted us to his house. It was
comfortable to find ourselves in a well-built
little square, and a neatly furnished house, in
good company, and with a good supper before
us; in short, with all the conveniencies of civi∣lized
life in the midst of rude mountains. Mrs.
Trapaud, and the governour's daughter, and her
husband, Captain Newmarsh, were all most ob∣liging
and polite. The governour had excellent
animal spirits, the conversation of a soldier,
and somewhat of a Frenchman, to which his
extraction entitles him. He is brother to Ge∣neral
Cyrus Trapaud. We passed a very agree∣able
evening.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>31st August.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The governour has a very good garden. We
looked at it, and at all the rest of the fort, which
is but small, and may be commanded from a
variety of hills around. We also looked at the
galley or sloop belonging to the fort, which
fails upon the Loch, and brings what is wanted
for the garrison, Captains Urie and Darippe,
of the 15th regiment of foot, breakfasted with
us. They had served in America, and enter∣tained
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
Dr. Johnson much with an account of
the Indians. He said, he could make a very
pretty book out of them, were he to stay there.
Governor Trapaud was much struck with Dr.
Johnson. “I like to hear him, (said he) it is
so majestick. I should be glad to hear him
speak in your court.”—He pressed us to stay
dinner; but I considered that we had a rude
road before us, which we could more easily en∣counter
in the morning, and that it was hard to
say when we might get up, were we to sit down
to good entertainment, in good company: I
therefore begged the governour would excuse
us. Here, too, I had another very pleasing
proof how much my father is regarded. The
governour expressed the highest respect for him,
and bade me tell him, that, if he would come that
way on a circuit to Inverness, he would do him
all the honours of the garrison.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one we set out, and
travelled eleven miles, through a wild country,
till we came to a house in <HI>Glenmorison,</HI> called
<HI>Anoch,</HI> kept by a M'Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A</HI> M'Queen is a Highland mode of expression. An Eng∣lishman would say <HI>one</HI> M'Queen. But where there are <HI>clans</HI> or <HI>tribes</HI> of men, distinguished by <HI>patronymick</HI> surnames, the individulas of each are considered as if they were of different species, at least as much as nations are distinguished; so that a <HI>M'Queen,</HI> a <HI>M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald,</HI> a <HI>M'Lean,</HI> is said, as we say a Frenchman, an Italian, a Spania<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE> Our landlord
was a sensible fellow: he had learnt his gram∣mar,
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
and Dr. Johnson justly observed, that
“a man is the better for that as long as he
lives.” There were some books here: a Trea∣tise
against Drunkenness, translated from the
French; a volume of the Spectator; a volume
of Prideaux's Connection, and Cyrus's Travels.
M'Queen said he had more volumes; and his
pride seemed to be much piqued that we were
surprised at his having books.</P>
<P>Near to this place we had passed a party of
soldiers, under a serjeant's command, at work
upon the road. We gave them two shillings to
drink. They came to our inn, and made merry
in the barn. We went and paid them a visit,
Dr. Johnson saying, “Come, let's go and give
'em another shilling a-piece.” We did so;
and he was saluted “MY LORD” by all of
them. He is really generous, loves influence,
and has the way of gaining it. He said, “I
am quite feudal, Sir.” Here I agree with him.
I said, I regretted I was not the head of a clan;
however, though not possessed of such an here∣ditary
advantage, I would always endeavour to
make my tenants follow me. I could not be a
<HI>patriarchal</HI> chief, but I would be a <HI>feudal</HI> chief.</P>
<P>The poor soldiers got too much liquor. Some
of them fought, and left blood upon the spot,
and cursed whisky next morning. The house
here was built of thick turfs, and thatched with
thinner turfs and heath. It had three rooms in
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
length, and a little room which projected.
Where we sat, the side-walls were <HI>wainscotted,</HI>
as Dr. Johnson said, with wicker, very neatly
plaited. Our landlord had made the whole
with his own hands.</P>
<P>After dinner, M'Queen sat by us awhile,
and talked with us. He said, all the Laird of
Glenmorison's people would bleed for him, if
they were well used; but that seventy men had
gone out of the Glen to America. That he
himself intended to go next year; for that the
rent of his farm, which twenty years ago was
only five pounds, was now raised to twenty
pounds. That he could pay ten pounds, and
live; but no more.—Dr. Johnson said, he
wished M'Queen laird of Glenmorison, and the
laird to go to America. M'Queen very gene∣rously
answered, he should be sorry for it; for
the laird could not shift for himself in America
as he could do.</P>
<P>I talked of the officers whom we had left to∣day;
how much service they had seen, and
how little they got for it, even of fame.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, a soldier gets as little as any
man can get.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Goldsmith has ac∣quired
more same than all the officers last war,
who were not Generals.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir,
you will find ten thousand fit to do what they did,
before you find one who does what Goldsmith
has done. You must consider, that a thing is
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
valued according to its rarity. A pebble that
paves the street is in itself more useful than the
diamond upon a lady's finger.”—I wish our
friend Goldsmith had heard this.</P>
<P>I yesterday expressed my wonder that John
Hay, one of our guides, who had been pressed
aboard a man of war, did not chuse to continue
longer than nine months, after which time he
got off.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, Sir, no man will be
a sailor, who has contrivance enough to get him∣self
into a jail; for, being in a ship is being in
a jail, with the chance of being drowned.”</P>
<P>We had tea in the afternoon, and our land∣lord's
daughter, a modest civil girl, very neatly
drest, made it for us. She told us, she had been
a year at Inverness, and learnt reading and
writing, sewing, knotting, working lace, and
pastry. Dr. Johnson made her a present of a
book which he had bought at Inverness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This book has given rise to much inquiry, which has ended in ludicrous surprise. Several ladies, wishing to learn the kind of reading which the great and good Dr. Johnson esteemed most fit for a young woman, desired to know what book he had selected for this Highland nymph. “They never adverted (said he) that I had no <HI>choice</HI> in the matte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I have said that I presented her with a book which I <HI>happened</HI> to have about me.”—And what was this book?—My readers, prepare your features for merriment. It was <HI>Cocker's Arith∣metick!</HI>—Wherever this was mentioned, there was a loud laugh, at which Dr. Johnson, when present, used sometimes to be a little angry. One day, when we were dining at Ge∣neral Oglethorpe's, where we had many a valuable day, I ventured to interrogate him, “But, Sir, is it not somewhat singular that you should <HI>ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen</HI> to have <HI>Cocker's Arithmetick</HI> about you on your journey? What made you buy such a book at Inverness?”—He gave me a very sufficient answer. “Why, Sir, if you are to have but one book with you upon a journey, let it be a book of science. When you have read through a book of entertainment, you know it, and it can do no more for you; but a book of science is inexhaustible.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158"/>
The room had some deals laid across the
joists, as a kind of cieling. There were two
beds in the room, and a woman's grown was
hung on a rope to make a curtain of separation
between them. Joseph had sheets, which my
wife had sent with us, laid on them. We had
much hesitation, whether to undress, or lye
down with our clothes on. I said at last, “I'll
plunge in! There will be less harbour for vermin
about me, when I am stripped!”—Dr. John∣son
said, he was like one hesitating whether to
go into the cold bath. At last he resolved too.
I observed, he might serve a campaign.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I could do all that can be done by pa∣tience.
Whether I should have strength enough,
I know not.”—He was in excellent humour.
To see the Rambler as I saw him to-night, was
really an amusement. I yesterday told him, I
was thinking of writing a poetical letter to him,
<HI>on his return from Scotland,</HI> in the stile of Swift's
humorous epistle in the character of Mary Gul∣liver
to her husband, Captain Lemuel Gulliver,
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
on his return to England from the country of
the <HI>Houyhnhnms.</HI></P>
<Q><L>“At early morn I to the market haste,</L>
<L>Studious in ev'ry thing to please thy taste.</L>
<L>A curious <HI>fowl</HI> and <HI>sparagrass</HI> I chose;</L>
<L>(For I remember you were fond of those:)</L>
<L>Three shillings cost the first, the last sev'n groats;</L>
<L>Sullen you turn from both, and call for OATS.”</L></Q>
<P>He laughed, and asked in whose name I would
write it. I said, in Mrs. Thrale's. He was angry.
“Sir, if you have any sense of decency or de∣licacy,
you won't do that!”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Then
let it be in <HI>Cole's,</HI> the landlord of the <HI>Mitre
tavern;</HI> where we have so often sat together.”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Aye, that may do.”</P>
<P>After we had offered up our private devo∣tions,
and had chatted a little from our beds,
Dr. Johnson said, “GOD bless us both,
for Jesus Christ's sake! Good night!”—I pro∣nounced
“<HI>Amen.</HI>”—He fell asleep immediately.
I was not so fortunate for a long time▪ I fan∣cied
myself bit by innumerable vermin under
the clothes; and that a spider was travelling
from the <HI>wainscot</HI> towards my mouth. At last
I fell into insensibility.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>1st September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I awaked very early. I began to imagine
that the landlord, being about to emigrate,
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
might murder us to get our money, and lay it
upon the soldiers in the barn. Such groundless
fears will arise in the mind, before it has re∣sumed
its vigour after sleep! Dr. Johnson had
had the same kind of ideas; for he told me
afterwards, that he considered so many sol∣diers,
having seen us, would be witnesses,
should any harm be done, and that circum∣stance,
I suppose, he considered as a security.
When I got up, I found him sound asleep in
his miserable <HI>stye,</HI> I may call it, with a coloured
handkerchief tied round his head, With
difficulty could I awaken him. It reminded
me of Henry IV.'s fine soliloquy on sleep; for
there was here as <HI>uneasy a pallet</HI> as the poet's
imagination could possibly conceive.</P>
<P>A <HI>red-coat</HI> of the 15th regiment, whether of∣ficer,
or only serjeant, I could not be sure,
came to the house, in his way to the mountains
to shoot deer, which it seems the Laird of
Glenmorison does not hinder any body to do.
Few, indeed, can do them harm. We had him
to breakfast with us. We got away about
eight. M'Queen walked some miles to give
us a convoy. He had, in 1745, joined the
Highland army at Fort Augustus, and conti∣nued
in it till after the battle of Culloden. As
he narrated the particulars of that ill-advised,
but brave attempt, I several times burst
into tears. There is a certain association
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
of ideas in my mind upon that subject, by which
I am strongly affected. The very Highland
names, or the sound of a bagpipe, will stir my
blood, and fill me with a mixture of melancholy
and respect for courage; with pity for an un∣fortunate,
and superstitious regard for antiquity,
and thoughtless inclination for war; in short,
with a crowd of sensations with which sober
rationality has nothing to do.</P>
<P>We passed through Glensheal, with prodi∣gious
mountains on each side. We saw where
the battle was fought in the year 1719. Dr.
Johnson ownned he was now in a scene of as
wild nature as he could see; but he corrected
me sometimes in my inaccurate observations.—
“There, said I, is a mountain like a cone.”—
“<HI>Johnson.</HI> No, Sir. It would be called so in
a book; and when a man comes to look at it,
he sees it is not so. It is indeed pointed at the
top; but one side of it is larger than the other.”
—Another mountain I called immense—
“<HI>Johnson.</HI> No; it is no more than a consider∣able
protuberance.”</P>
<P>We came to a rich green valley, compara∣tively
speaking, and stopt a while to let our
horses rest and eat grass.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Johnson, in his <HI>Journey,</HI> thus beautifully describes his situation here:—“I sat down on a bank such as a writer of romance might have delighted to feign. I had, indeed, no trees to whisper over my head; but a clear rivulet streamed at my feet. The day was calm, the air soft, and all was rude∣ness, silence and solitude. Before me, and on either side, were high hills, which, by hindering the eye from ranging, forced the mind to find entertainment for itself. Whether I spent the hour well, I know not; for here I first conceived the thought of this narration.”—The <HI>Critical Reviewers.</HI> with a spirit and expression worthy of the subject, say,—“We congratulate the public on the event with which this quotation concludes, and are fully persuaded that the hour in which the entertaining traveller conceived this narrative will be considered, by every reader of taste, as a fortunate event in the annals of literature. Were it suitable to the task in which we are at present engaged, to judulge ouerselves in a poetical flight, we would invoke the winds of the Caledonian moun∣tains to blow for ever, with their softest breezes, on the bank where our author reclined, and request of Flora, that it migh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be perpetually adorned with the gayest and most fragrant productions of the year.”</NOTE> We soon after came
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
to Auchnasheal, a kind of rural village, a
number of cottages being built together, as we
saw all along in the Highlands. We passed
many miles this day without seeing a house, but
only little summer-huts, called <HI>shielings.</HI> Evan
Campbell, servant to Mr. Murchison, factor to
the Laird of Macleod in Glenelg, run along
with us to-day. He was a very obliging fel∣low.
At Auchnasheal, we sat down on a
green turf seat at the end of a house; they
brought us out two wooden dishes of milk,
which we tasted. One of them was frothed
like a syllabub. I saw a woman preparing it
with such a stick as is used for chocolate, and
in the same manner. We had a considerable
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
circle about us, men, women and children,
all M'Craas, Lord Seaforth's people. Not
one of them could speak English. I observed
to Dr. Johnson, it was much the same as being
with a tribe of Indians—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, Sir;
but not so terrifying.” I gave all who chose it,
snuff and tobacco. Governor Trapaud had
made us buy a quantity at Fort Augustus, and
put them up in small parcels. I also gave each
person a bit of wheat bread, which they had
never tasted before. I then gave a penny a
piece to each child. I told Dr. Johnson of
this; upon which he called to Joseph and our
guides, for change for a shilling, and declared
that he would distribute among he children.
Upon this being announced in Erse, there was
a great stir; not only did some children come
running down from neighbouring huts, but I
observed one black-haired man, who had been
with us all along, had gone off and returned,
bringing a very young child. My fellow-tra∣veller
then ordered the children to be drawn up
in a row; and he dealt about his copper, and
made them and their parents all happy. The
poor M'Craas, whatever may be their present

when there was a line in a song.</P>
<Q><L>And aw the brave M'Craas are coming<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The M'Craas, or Macraes, were since that time brought into the king's army, by the late Lord Seaforth. When they lay in Edinburgh castle in 1778, and were ordered to embark for Jersey, they, with a number of other men in the regiment, for different reasons, but especially an apprehension that they were to be sold to the East India Company, though enlisted not to be sent out of Great-Britain without their own consent, made a determined mutiny, and encamped upon the lofty moun∣tain, <HI>Arthur's seat</HI> where they remained three days and three nights bidding defiance to all the force in Scotland. At last they came down, and embarked peaceably, having obtained formal articles of capitulation, signed by Sir Adolphus Ough∣ton, commander in chief, General Skene, deputy commander, the Duke of Buccleugh, and the Earl of Dunmore, which quieted them. Since the secession of the Commons of Rome to the <HI>Mons Sacer,</HI> a more spirited exertion has not been made. <HI>I</HI> gave great attention to it from first to last, and have drawn up a particular account of it. Those brave fellows have since served their country effectually at Jersey, and also in the East-Indies, to which, after being better informed, they voluntarily agreed to go.</NOTE></L></Q>
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
<P>There was great diversity in the faces of the
circle around us: some were as black and wild
in their appearance as any American savages
whatever. One woman was as comely almost
as the figure of Sapho, as we see it painted.
We asked the old woman, the mistress of the
house where we had the milk, (which, by the
bye, Dr. Johnson told me, for I did not ob∣serve
it myself, was built not of turf, but of
stone,) what we should pay. She said, what
we pleased. One of our guides asked her, in
Erse, if a shilling was enough. She said,
“Yes.” But some of the men bid her ask
more. This vexed me; because it shewed a
desire to impose upon strangers, as they knew
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
that even a shilling was high payment. The
woman, however, honestly persisted in her first
price; so I gave her half a crown.—Thus we
had one good scene of life uncommon to us.
The people were very much pleased, gave us
many blessings, and said they had not had such
a day since the old Laird of M'Leod's time.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was much refreshed by this re∣past.
He was pleased when I told him he
would make a good Chief. He said, “Were
I a chief, I would dress my servants better
than myself, and knock a fellow down if he
looked saucy to a Macdonald in rags. But I
would not treat men as brutes. I would let
them know why all of my clan were to have
attention paid to them. I would tell my upper
servants why, and make them tell the others.”</P>
<P>We rode on well, till we came to the high
mountain called the <HI>Rattakin,</HI> by which time
both Dr. Johnson and the horses were a good
deal fatigued. It is a terrible steep to climb,
notwithstanding the road is made slanting along
it; however, we made it out. On the top of
it we met Captain M'Leod of Balmenoch (a
Dutch officer who had come from Sky) riding
with his sword slung across him. He asked,
“Is this Mr. Boswell?” which was a proof
that we were expected. Going down the hill
on the other side was no easy task. As Dr.
Johnson was a great weight, the two guides
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
agreed that he should ride the horses alternately.
Hay's were the two best, and the Doctor would
not ride but upon one or other of them, a black
or a brown. But, as Hay complained much, after
ascending the <HI>Rattakin,</HI> the Doctor was pre∣vailed
with to mount one of Vass's greys. As
he rode upon it dwon hill, it did not go well;
and he grumbled. I walked on a little before,
but was excessively entertained with the me∣thod
taken to keep him in good humour. Hay
led the horse's head, talking to Dr. Johnson an
much as he could; and (having heard him, in
the forenoon, express a pastoral pleasure on
seeing the goats browzing) just when the Doc∣tor
was uttering his displeasure, the fellow
cried, with a very Highland accent, “See such
pretty goats!” Then he whistled, <HI>whu!</HI> and made
them jump.—Little did he conceive what Doc∣tor
Johnson was. Here now was a common
ignorant Highland horse-hirer imagining that
he could divert, as one does a child,—<HI>Dr.
Samuel Johnson!</HI>—The ludicrousness, absurdity,
and extraordinary contrast between what the
fellow fancied, and the reality, was truly
comick.</P>
<P>It grew dusky; and we had a very tedious
ride for what was called five miles; but I am
sure would measure ten. We spoke none. I
was riding forward to the inn at Glenelg, on
the shore opposite to Sky, that I might
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
take proper measures, before Dr. Johnson,
who was now advancing in dreary silence, Hay
leading his horse, should arrive. He called me
back with tremendous shout, and was really
in a passion with me for leaving him. I told
him my intentions, but he was not satisfied, and
said, “Do you know, I should as soon have
thought of picking a pocket, as doing so.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “I am diverted with you, Sir.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I could never be diverted with
incivility. Doing such a thing, makes one lose
confidence in him who has done it, as one can∣not
tell what he may do next.”—His extraor∣dinary
warmth confounded me so much, that I
justified myself but lamely to him; yet my
intentions were not improper. I wished to get
on, to see how we were to be lodged, and how
we were to get a boat; all which I thought I
could best settle myself, without his having any
trouble. To apply his great mind to minute
particulars, is wrong. It is like taking an
immense balance, such as is kept on quays for
weighing cargoes of ships,—to weigh a guinea.
I knew I had neat little scales, which would do
better; and that his attention to every thing
which falls in his way, and his uncommon
desire to be always, in the right, would make
him weigh, if he knew of the particulars:
it was right therefore for me to weigh them,
and let him have them only in effect. I
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
however continued to ride by him finding he
wished I should do so.</P>
<P>As we passed the barracks at <HI>Bernéra,</HI> I looked
at them wishfully, as soldiers have always every
thing in the best order. But there was only a
serjeant and a few men there. We came on to
the inn at Glenelg. There was no provender for
our horses; so they were sent to grass, with a
man to watch them. A maid shewed us up
stairs into a room damp and dirty, with bare
walls, a variety of bad smells, a coarse black
greasly fir table, and forms of the same kind;
and out of a wretched bed started fellow from
his sleep, like Edgar in King Lear, “<HI>Poor
Tom's a cold.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is amusing to observe the different images which this being presented to Dr. Johnson and me. The Doctor, in his JOURNEY, compares him to a <HI>Cyclops.</HI></NOTE>”.</P>
<P>This inn was furnished with not a single
article that we could either eat or drink; but
Mr. Murchison, factor to the Laird of Mac∣leod
in Glenelg, sent us a bottle of rum and
some sugar, with a polite message, to acquaint
us, that he was very sorry that he did not hear
of us till we had passed his house, otherwise he
should have insisted on our passing the night
there; and that, if he were not obliged to set
out for Inverness early next morning, he would
have waited upon us.—Such extraordinary at∣tention
from this gentleman, to entire strangers,
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
deserves the most honourable commemora∣tion.</P>
<P>Our bad accommodation here made me un∣easy,
and almost fretful. Dr. Johnson was
calm. I said, he was so from vanity.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, Sir, it is from philosophy.”—It
pleased me to see that the <HI>Rambler</HI> could prac∣tice
so well his own lessons.</P>
<P>I resumed the subject of my leaving him on
the road, and endeavoured to defend it better.
He was still violent upon that head, and
said, “Sir, had you gone on, I was thinking
that I should have returned with you to Edin∣burgh,
and then have parted from you, and
never spoken to you more.”</P>
<P>I sent for fresh hay, with which we made
beds for ourselves, each in a room equally
miserable. Like Wolfe, we had a “<HI>choice of
difficulties.</HI>” Dr. Johnson made things easier
by comparison. At M'Queen's, last night, he
observed, that few were so well lodged in a
ship. To-night he said, we were better than
if we had been upon the hill. He lay down
buttoned up in his great coat. I had my
sheets spread on the hay, and my clothes and
great coat laid over me, by way of blankets.</P>

<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>2d September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I had slept ill. Dr. Johnson's anger had
affected me much. I considered that, without
any bad intention, I might suddenly forfeit his
friendship. I was impatient to see him this
morning. I told him how uneasy he had made
me, by what he had said, and reminded him
of his own remark at Aberdeen, upon old
friendships being hastily broken off. He
owned, he had spoken to me in passion; that
he would not have done what he threatened;
and that, if he had, he would have been ten
times worse than I; that forming intimacies,
would indeed be “limning the water,” were
they liable to such sudden dissolution; and
added, “Let's think no more on't.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“Well then, Sir, I shall be easy. Remember,
I am to have fair warning in case of any quar∣rel.
You are never to spring a mine upon me.
It was absurd in me to believe you.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“You deserved about as much, as to believe
me from night to morning.”</P>
<P>After breakfast, we got into a boat for Sky.
It rained much when we set off, but cleared up
as we advanced. One of the boatmen, who
spoke English, said, that a mile at land was
two miles at sea. I then observed, that from
Glenelg to Armidale in Sky, which was our
present course, and is called twelve, was only
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix miles. But this he could not understand.
“Well, (said Dr. Johnson) never talk to me
of the native good sense of the Highlanders.
Here is a fellow who calls one mile two, and
yet cannot comprehend that twelve such ima∣ginary
miles make in truth but six.”</P>
<P>We reached the shore of Armidale before
one o'clock. Sir Alexander M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald came
down to receive us. He and his lady (formerly
Miss Bosville of Yorkshire) were then in a
house built by a tenant at this place, which is
in the district of Slate, the family mansion here
having been burnt in Sir Donald Macdonald's
time.</P>
<P>Instead of finding the head of the Macdo∣nalds
surrounded with his clan, and a festive
entertainment, we had a small company, and
cannot boast of our cheer. The particulars are
minuted in my Journal, but I shall not trouble
the publick with them. I shall mention but
one characteristick circumstance. My shrewd
and hearty friend, Sir Thomas (Wentworth)
Blacket, Lady Macdonald's uncle, who had
preceded us in a visit to this chief, upon being
asked by him, if the punch bowl then upon
the table was not a very handsome one, replied,
“Yes,—if it were full.”</P>
<P>Sir Alexander Macdonald having been an
Eton Scholar, Dr. Johnson had formed an
opinion of him which was much diminished
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
when he beheld him in the isle of Sky, where
we heard heavy complaints of rents racked,
and the people driven to emigration. Dr.
Johnson said, “It grieves me to see the chief
of a great clan appear to such disadvantage.
This gentleman has talents, nay some learning;
but he is totally unfit for this situation. Sir,
the Highland chiefs should not be allowed to
go farther south than Aberdeen. A strong-minded
man, like his brother Sir James, may
be improved by an English education; but in
general, they will be tamed into insignificance.”</P>
<P>I meditated an escape from this house the
very next day; but Dr. Johnson resolved that
we should weather it out till Monday.</P>
<P>We found here Mr. Janes of Aberdeenshire,
a naturalist. Janes said he had been at Dr.
Johnson's, in London, with Ferguson the astro∣nomer.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It is strange that, in such
distant places, I should meet with any one who
knows me. I should have thought I might
hide myself in Sky.”</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>3d September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This day proving wet, we should have passed
our time very uncomfortably, had we not found
in the house two chests of books, which we
eagerly ransacked. After dinner, when I
alone was left at table with the few Highland
gentlemen who were of the company, having
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
talked with very high respect of Sir James
Macdonald, they were all so much affected as
to shed tears. One of them was Mr. Donald
Macdonald, who had been lieutenant of gre∣nadiers
in the Highland regiment, raised by
Colonel Montgomery, now Earl of Eglintoune,
in the war before last; one of those regiments
which the late Lord Chatham prided himself in
having brought “from the mountains of the
North:” by doing which he contributed to
extinguish in the Highlands the remains of
disaffection to the present Royal Family. From
this gentleman's conversation, I first learnt how
very popular his Colonel was among the High∣landers;
of which I had such continued proofs,
during the whole course of my Tour, that on
my return I could not help telling the noble
Earl himself, that I did not before know how
great a man he was.</P>
<P>We were advised by some persons here to
visit Rasay, in our way to Dunvegan, the seat
of the Laird of Macleod. Being informed that
the Rev. Mr. Donald M'Queen was the most
intelligent man in Sky, and having been fa∣voured
with a letter of introduction to him, by
the learned Sir James Foulis, I sent it to him by
an express, and requested he would meet us at
Rasay; and at the same time enclosed a letter
to the Laird of Macleod, informing him that
we intended in a few days to have the honour
of waiting on him at Dunvegan.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174"/>
Dr. Johnson this day endeavoured to obtain
some knowledge of the state of the country;
but complained that he could get no distinct
information about any thing, from those with
whom he conversed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>4th September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>My endeavours to rouse the English-bred
Chieftain, in whose house we were, to the
sedal and petriarchal feelings, proving in∣effectual,
Dr. Johnson this morning tried to
bring him to our way of thinking.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Were I in your place, sir, in seven years
I would make this an independant island. I
would roast oxen whole, and hang out a flag
as a signal to the Macdonalds to come and get
beef and whisky.”—Sir Alexander was still
starting difficulties.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, sir; if
you are born to object, I have done with you▪
Sir, I would have a magazine of arms.”—<HI>Sir
Alexander.</HI> “They would rust.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Let there be men to keep them clean. Your
ancestors did not use to let their arms rust.”</P>
<P>We attempted in vain to communicate to
him a portion of our enthusiasm. He bore
with so polite a good-nature our warm, and
what some might call Gothick, expostulations,
on this subject, that I should not forgive my∣self,
were I do record all that Dr. Johnson's
ardour led him to say.—This day was little
better than a blank.</P>

<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>5th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I walked to the parish church of Slate, which
is a very poor one. There are no church bells
in the island. I was told there were once some;
what has become of them, I could not learn.
The minister not being at home, there was no
service. I went into the church, and saw the
monument of Sir James Macdonald, which
was elegantly executed at Rome, and has the
following inscription, written by his friend,
George Lord Lyttleton:</P>

<P>“YESTERDAY's post brought me your answer to the first letter in which I acquainted you of my illness. Your tenderness and concern upon that account are the same I have always experienced, and to which I have often owed my life. Indeed it never was in so great danger as it has been lately; and though it would have been a very great comfort to me to have had you near me, yet perhaps I ought to rejoice, on your account, that you had not the pain of such a spectacle. I have been now a week in Rome, and wish I could continue to give you the same good accounts of my recovery as I did in my last: but I must own that, for three days past, I have been in a very weak and miserable state, which however seems to give no uneasiness to my physician. My stomach has been greatly out of order, without any visible cause; and the palpitation does not decrease. I am told that my stomach will soon recover its tone, and that the palpitation must cease in time. So I am willing to believe; and with this hope support the little remains of spirits which I can be supposed to have, on the forty-seventh day of such an illness. Do not imagine I have relapsed;—I only recover flower than I expected. If my letter is shorter than usual, the cause of it is a dose of physick, which has weakened me so much to day, that I am not able to write a long letter. I will make up for it next post, and remain always</P>

<P>He grew gradually worse; and on the night before his death he wrote as follows, from Frescati:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“MY DEAR MOTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“THOUGH I did not mean to deceive you in my last letter from Rome, yet certainly you would have very little reason to conclude of the very great and constant danger I have gone through ever since that time. My life, which is still almost entirely desperate, did not at that time appear to me so, otherwise I should have represented, in its true colours, a fact which acquires very little horror by that means, and comes with redoubled force by deception. There is no cir∣cumstance of danger and pain of which I have not had the experience, for a continued series of above a fortnight; during which time I have settled my affairs, after my death, with as much distinctness as the hurry and the nature of the thing could admit of. In case of the worst, the Abbé Grant will he my executor in this part of the world, and Mr. Mackenzie in Scotland, where my object has been to make you and my younger brother as independent of the eldest as possible.”</P>

<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
<P>Dr. Johnson said, the inscription should have
been in Latin, as every thing intended to be
universal and permanent, should be.</P>
<P>This being a beautiful day, my spirits were
cheered by the mere effect of climate. I had
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
felt a return of spleen during my stay at Armi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dale,
and had it not been that I had Dr▪ John∣son
to contemplate, I should have sunk into
dejection; but his firmness supported me. I
looked at him, as a man whose head is turning
giddy at sea looks at a rock, or any fixt object.
I wondered at his tranquillity. He said, “Sir,
when a man retires into an island, he is to turn
his thoughts intirely on another world. He
has done with this.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “It appears to
me, Sir, to be very difficult to unite a due
attention to this world, and that which is to
come; for, if we engage eagerly in the affairs
of life, we are apt to be totally forgetful of a
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
future state; and, on the other hand, a steady
contemplation of the awful concerns of eternity
renders all objects here so insignificant, as to
make us indifferent and negligent about them.”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, Dr. Cheyne has laid down a
rule to himself on this subject, which should
be imprinted on every mind:” “<HI>To neglect no∣thing
to secure my eternal peace, more than if I
had been certified I should die within the day:
nor to mind any thing that my secular obligatiions
and duties demanded of me, less than if I had
been ensured to live fifty years more.”</HI></P>
<P>I must here observe, that though Dr. Johnson
appeared now to be philosophically calm,
yet his genius did not shine forth as in compa∣nies,
where I have listened to him with admi∣ration.
The vigour of his mind was, however,
sufficiently manifested, by his discovering no
symptoms of feeble relaxation in the dull,
“weary, flat, and unprofitable” state in which
we now were placed.</P>
<P>I am inclined to think that it was on this day

<P>We set out, accompanied by Mr. Donald
M'Leod (late of Canna) as our guide. We
rode for some time along the district of Slate,
near the shore. The houses in general are
made of turf, convered with grass. The country
seemed well peopled. We came into the di∣strict
of Strath, and passed along a wild moorish
tract of land till we arrived at the shore.
There we found good verdure, and some cu∣rious
whin-rocks, or collections of stones like
the ruins of the foundations of old buildings.
We saw also theree <HI>Cairns</HI> of considerable size.
About a mile beyond Broadfoot, is Corriecha∣tachin,
a farm of Sir Alexander Macdonald's,
possessed by Mr. M'Kinnon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That my readers may have my narrative in the style of the country through which I am travelling, they will please to be informed, that the chief of a clan is denominated by his <HI>surname</HI> alone, as M'Leod, M'Kinnon, M'Intosh. To prefix <HI>Mr.</HI> to it would be a degradation from <HI>the</HI> M'Leod, &amp;c. My old friend, the Laird of M'Farlane, the great antiquary, took it highly amiss, when General Wade called him <HI>Mr.</HI> M'Far∣lane. Dr. Johnson said, he could not bring himself to use this mode of address; it seemed to him to be too familiar, as it is the way in which, in all other places, intimates or infe∣riors are addressed.

<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
with a hearty welcome, as did his wife, who
was what we call in Scotland a <HI>lady-like</HI> woman.
Mr. Pennant, in the course of his tour to the
Hebrides, passed two nights at this gentleman's
house. On its being mentioned, that a present
had here been made to him of a curious speci∣men
of Highland antiquity, Dr. Johnson said,
“Sir, it was more than he deserved. The dog
is a Whig.”</P>
<P>We here enjoyed the comfort of a table
plentifully furnished, the satisfaction of which
was heightened by a numerous and cheerful
company; and we for the first time had a speci∣men
of the joyous social manners of the inhabi∣tants
of the Highlands. They talked in their
own ancient language, with fluent vivacity, and
sung many Erse songs with such spirit, that,
though Dr. Johnson was treated with the
greatest respect and attention, there were moments
in which he seemed to be forgotten.
For myself, though but a <HI>Lowlander,</HI> having
picked up a few words of the language, I pre∣sumed
to mingle in their mirth, and joined in
the chorusses with as much glee as any of the
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
company. Dr. Johnson, being fatigued with
his journey, retired early to his chamber, where
he composed the following Ode, addressed to
Mrs. Thrale:</P>

<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>7th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. Johnson was much pleased with his
entertainment here. There were many good
books in the house: Hector Boethius in
Latin; Cave's Lives of the Fathers; Baker's
Chronicle; Jeremy Collier's Church History;
Dr. Johnson's small Dictionary; Craufurd's
Officers of State, and several more:—a mez∣zotinto
of Mrs. Brookes the actress (by some
strange chance in Sky); and also a print of
Macdonald of Clanranald, with a Latin in∣scription
about the cruelties after the battle of
Culloden, which will never be forgotten.</P>
<P>It was a very wet stormy day; so we were
obliged to remain here, it being impossible to
cross the sea to Rasay.</P>
<P>I employed a part of the forenoon in writing
this Journal. The rest of it was somewhat
dreary, from the gloominess of the weather,
and the uncertain state which we were in, as
we could not tell but it might clear up every
hour. Nothing is more uneasy to the mind
than a state of suspence, especially when it
depends upon the weather, concerning which
there can be so little calculation. As Dr.
Johnson said of our weariness on the Monday
at Aberdeen, “Sensation is sensation:” Corri∣chatachin,
which was last night a hospitable
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
house, was, in my mind, changed to-day into
a prison. After dinner, I read some of Dr.
Macpherson's Dissertations on the Ancient
Caledonians. I was disgusted by the unsa∣tisfactory
conjectures as to antiquity, before
the days of record. I was happy when tea
came. Such, I take it, is the state of those
who live in the country. Meals are wished for
from the cravings of vacuity of mind, as well
as from the desire of eating. I was hurt to find
even such a temporary feebleness, and that I
was so far from being that robust wise man
who is sufficient for his own happiness. I felt
a kind of lethargy of indolence. I did not
exert myself to get Dr. Johnson to talk, that I
might not have the labour of writing down his
conversation.—He enquired here, if there were
any remains of the second sight. Mr. M'Pher∣son,
minister of Slate, said, he was <HI>resolved</HI> not
to believe it, because it was founded on no
principle.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “There are many things
then, which we are sure are true, that you will
not believe. What principle is there, why a
loadstone attracts iron? why an egg produces a
chicken by heat? why a tree grows upwards,
when the natural tendency of all things is
downwards? Sir, it depends upon the degree
of evidence that you have.”—Young Mr.
M'Kinnon mentioned one M'Kenzie, who is
still alive, who had often fainted in his pre∣sence,
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
and when he recovered, mentioned vi∣sions
which had been presented to him. He
told Mr. M'Kinnon, that at such a place he
should meet a funeral, and that such and such
people would be the bearers, naming four;
and three weeks afterwards he saw what M'Ken∣zie
had predicted. The naming the very spot
in a country where a funeral comes a long way,
and the very people as bearers, when there are
so many out of whom a choice may be made,
seems extraordinary.—We would have sent for
M'Kenzie, had we not been informed that he
could speak no English. Besides, the facts
were not related with sufficient accuracy.</P>
<P>Mrs. M'Kinnon, who is a daughter of old
Kingsburgh, told us, that her father was one
day riding in Sky, and some women, who were
at work in a field on the side of the road, said
to him, they had heard two <HI>taiscks,</HI> (that is, two
voices of persons about to die,) and what was
remarkable, one of them was an <HI>English taisck,</HI>
which they never heard before. When he re∣turned,
he at that very place met two funerals,
and one of them was that of a woman who had
come from the main land, and could speak
only English. This, she remarked, made a great
impression upon her father.</P>
<P>How all the people here were lodged, I
know not. It was partly done by separating
man and wife, and putting a number of men
in one room, and of women in another.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>8th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>When I awaked, the rain was much heavier
than yesterday; but the wind had abated. By
breakfast, the day was better, and in a little
while it was calm and clear. I felt my spirits
much elated. The propriety of the expression,
“<HI>the sunshine of the breast,</HI>” now struck me with
peculiar force; for the brilliant rays penetrated
into my very soul. We were all in better hu∣mour
than before. Mrs. M'Kinnon, with
unaffected hospitality and politeness, expressed
her happiness in having such company in her
house, and appeared to understand and relish
Dr. Johnson's conversation, as indeed all the
company seemed to do. When I knew she
was old Kingsburgh's daughter, I did not
wonder at the good appearance which she
made.</P>
<P>She talked as if her husband and family
would emigrate, rather than be oppressed by
their landlord; and said, “how agreeable
would it be, if these gentlemen should come
in upon us when we are in America.”—Some∣body
observed that Sir Alexander Macdonald
was always frightened at sea.—<HI>Johnson. “He</HI> is
frightened at sea; and his tenants are fright∣ened
when he comes to land.”</P>
<P>We resolved to set out directly after break∣fast.
We had about two miles to ride to the
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
sea-side, and there we expected to get one of
the boats belonging to the fleet of bounty her∣ring-busses
then on the coast, or at least a good
country fishing-boat. But while we were pre∣paring
to set out, there arrived a man with the
following card from the Reverend Mr. Donald
M'Queen.</P>
<P>“Mr. M'Queen's compliments to Mr.
Boswell, and begs leave to acquaint him,
that, fearing the want of a proper boat, as
much as the rain of yesterday, might have
caused a stop, he is now at Skianwden with
Macgillichallum's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Highland expression for Laird of Rasay.</NOTE> carriage▪ to convey him
and Dr. Johnson to Rasay, where they will
meet with a most hearty welcome, and where
Macleod, being on a visit, now attends their
motions.”</P>
<P>“Wednesday forenoon.”</P>
<P>This card was most agreeable; it was a pro∣logue
to that hospitable and truly polite recep∣tion
which we found at Rasay. In a little while
arrived Mr. Donald M'Queen himself; a de∣cent
minister, an elderly man with his own
black hair, courteous, and rather slow of
speech, but candid, sensible and well informed,
nay learned. Along with him came, as our
pilot, a gentleman whom I had a great desire to
see, Mr. Malcolm Macleod, one of the Rasay
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
family, celebrated in the year 1745-6. He was
now sixty-two years of age, hale, and well pro∣portioned,
—with a manly countenance, tanned
by the weather, yet having a ruddiness in his
cheeks, over a great part of which his rough
beard extended;—a quick lively eye; not fierce
in his look, but at once firm and good
humoured. He wore a pair of brogues,—Tartan
hose which came up only near to his
knees, and left them bare,—a purple camblet
kilt,—a black waistcoat,—a short green cloth
coat bound with gold cord,—a yellowish bushy
wig,—a large blue bonnet with a gold thread
button. I never saw a figure that was more
perfectly a representative of a Highland gentle∣man.
I wished much to have a picture of him
just as he was. I found him frank and <HI>polite,</HI>
in the true sense of the word.</P>
<P>The good family at Corichatachin said, they
hoped to see us on our return. We rode down
to the shore; but Malcolm walked with grace∣ful
agility.</P>
<P>We got into Rasay's <HI>carriage,</HI> which was a
good strong open boat made in Norway. The
wind had now risen pretty high, and was against
us; but we had four stout rowers, particularly
a Macleod, a robust, black-haired fellow,
half naked, and bare-headed, something between
a wild Indian and an English tar. Dr. Johnson
sat high on the stern, like a magnificent Triton.
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
Malcolm sung an Erse song, the chorus of
which was “<HI>Hatyin foam foam eri,</HI>” with words
of his own. The tune resembled “<HI>Owr the
muir amang the heather.</HI>” The boatmen and
Mr. M'Queen chorused, and all went well.
At length Malcolm himself took an oar, and
rowed vigorously. We sailed along the coast
of Scalpa, a rugged island, about four miles in
length. Dr. Johnson proposed that he and I
should buy it, and found a good school, and
an episcopal church, (Malcolm said, he would
come to it,) and have a printing-press, where
he would print all the Erse that could be found.</P>
<P>Here I was strongly struck with our long-projected
scheme of visiting the Hebrides being
realized. I called to him, “We are contend∣ing
with seas;” which I think were the words
of one of his letters to me. “Not much,”
said he; and though the wind made the sea
lash considerably upon us, he was not discom∣posed.
After we were out of the shelter of
Scalpa, and in the sound between it and Rasay,
which extended about a league, the wind made
the sea very rough. I did not like it.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“This now is the Atlantick. If I should tell
at a tea-table in London, that I have crossed
the Atlantick in an open boat, how they'd
shudder, and what a fool they'd think me to
expose myself to such danger!” He then re∣peated
Horace's ode,</P>
<Q><PB N="185" REF="191"/>
<L>Otium Divos rogat in patenti</L>
<L>Prensus Aegaeo—.</L></Q>
<P>In the confusion and hurry of this boisterous
sail, Dr. Johnson's spurs, of which Joseph had
charge, were carried over-board into the sea,
and lost. This was the first misfortune that
has befallen us. Dr. Johnson was a little angry
at first, observing that “there was something
wild in letting a pair of spurs be carried into
the sea out of a boat;” but then he remarked,
“that, as Janes the naturalist had said upon
losing his pocket-book, it was rather an incon∣venience
than a loss.” He told us, he now recol∣lected
that he dreamt the night before, that he
put his staff into a river, and chanced to let it
go, and it was carried down the stream and
lost. “So now you see (said he) that I have
lost my spurs; and this story is better than
many of those which we have concerning
second sight and dreams.” Mr. M'Queen said
he did not believe the second sight; that he
never met with any well attested instances; and
if he should, he would impute them to chance;
because all who pretend to that quality often
fail in their predictions, though they take a
great scope, and sometimes interpret literally,
sometimes figuratively, so as to suit the events.
He told us, that, since he came to be minister
of the parish where he now is, the belief of
witchcraft, or charms, was very common, in∣somuch
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
that he had many prosecutions before
his <HI>session</HI> (the parochial ecclesiastical court)
against women, for having by these means
carried off the milk from people's cows. He
disregarded them; and there is not now the
least vestige of that superstition. He preached
against it; and in order to give a strong proof
to the people that there was nothing in it, he
said from the pulpit, that every woman in the
parish was welcome to take the milk from his
cows, provided she did not touch them.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson asked him as to Fingal. He
said he could repeat some passages in the ori∣ginal;
that he heard his grandfather had a copy
of it; but that he could not affirm that
Ossian composed all that poem as it is now pub∣lished.
This came pretty much to what Dr.
Johnson has maintained; though he goes far∣ther,
and contends that it is no better than
such an epick poem as he could make from the
song of Robin Hood; that is to say, that, except
a few passages, there is nothing truly ancient
but the names and some vague traditions. Mr.
M'Queen alledged that Homer was made up of
detached fragments. Dr. Johnson denied this;
observing, that it had been one work originally,
and that you could not put a book of the Iliad
out of its place; and he believed the same
might be said of the Odyssey.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="193"/>
The approach to Rasay was very pleasing.
We saw before us a beautiful bay, well de∣fended
by a rocky coast; a good family man∣sion;
a fine verdure about it,—with a consider∣able
number of trees;—and beyond it hills and
mountains in gradation of wildness. Our
boatmen sung with great spirit. Dr. Johnson
observed, that naval musick was very ancient.
As we came near the shore, the singing of our
rowers was succeeded by that of reapers, who
were busy at work, and who seemed to shout
as much as to sing, while they worked with a
bounding activity. Just as we landed, I ob∣served
a cross, or rather the ruins of one, upon
a rock, which had to me a pleasing vestige of
religion. I perceived a large company coming
out from the house. We met them as we
walked up. There were Rasay himself; his
brother Dr. Macleod; his nephew the Laird
of M'Kinnon; the Laird of Macleod; Colonel
Macleod of Talisker, an officer in the Dutch
service, a very genteel man, and a faithful
branch of the family; Mr. Macleod of Muira∣venside,
best known by the name of Sandie
Macleod, who was long in exile on account of
the part which he took in 1745; and several
other persons. We were welcomed upon the
green, and conducted into the house, where we
were introduced to Lady Rasay, who was sur∣rounded
by a numerous family, consisting of
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
three sons and ten daughters. The Laird of
Rasay is a sensible, polite, and most hospitable
gentleman. I was told that his island of Rasay,
and that of Rona, (from which the eldest son of
the family has his title,) and a considerable ex∣tent
of land which he has in Sky, do not alto∣gether
yield him a very large revenue: and yet
he lives in great splendour; and so far is he
from distressing his people, that, in the present
rage for emigration, not a man has left his
estate.</P>
<P>It was past six o'clock when we arrived.
Some excellent brandy was served round imme∣diately,
according to the custom of the High∣lands,
where a dram is generally taken every
day. They call it a <HI>scal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> On a side-board
was placed for us, who had come off the sea,
a substantial dinner, and a variety of wines.
Then we had coffee and tea. I observed in
the room several elegantly-bound books, and
other marks of improved life. Soon afterwards
a fidler appeared, and a little ball began.
Rasay himself danced with as much spirit as
any man, and Malcolm bounded like a roe.
Sandie Macleod, who has at times an excessive
flow of spirits, and had it now, was, in his
days of absconding, known by the name of
<HI>M'Cruslick,</HI> which it seems was the designation
of a kind of wild man in the Highlands, some∣thing
between Proteus and Don Quixotte; and
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
so he was called here. He made much jovial
noise. Dr. Johnson was so delighted with this
scene, that he said, “I know not how we shall
get away.” It entertained me to observe him
sitting by, while we danced, sometimes in deep
meditation,—sometimes smiling complacently,
—sometimes looking upon Hooke's Roman
History,—and sometimes talking a little,
amidst the noise of the ball, to Mr. Donald
M'Queen, who anxiously gathered knowledge
from him. He was pleased with M'Queen,
and said to me, “This is a critical man, Sir.
There must be great vigour of mind to make
him cultivate learning so much in the isle of
Sky, where he might do without it. It is won∣derful
how many of the new publications he
has. There must be a snatch of every oppor∣tunity.”
Mr. M'Queen told me that his bro∣ther
(who is the fourth generation of the family
following each other as ministers of the parish
of Snizort) and he joined together, and bought
from time to time such books as had reputation.
Soon after we came in, a black cock and grey
hen, which had been shot, were shewn, with
their feathers on, to Dr. Johnson, who had
never seen that species of bird before. We had
a company of thirty at supper; and all was
good humour and gaiety, without intempe∣rance.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>9th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>At breakfast this morning, among a profu∣sion
of other things, there were oat-cakes,
made of what is called <HI>graddaned</HI> meal, that is,
meal made of grain separated from the husks,
and toasted by fire, instead of being threshed
and kiln-dried. This seems to be bad ma∣nagement,
as so much fodder is consumed by
it. Mr. M'Queen however defended it, by
saying, that it is doing the thing much quicker,
as one operation serves what is otherwise done
by two. His chief reason however was, that
the servants in Sky are, according to him, a
faithless pack, and steal what they can; so that
much is saved by the corn passing but once
through their hands, as at each time they pilfer
some. It appears to me, that the gradaning is
a strong proof of the laziness of the Highlanders:
who will rather make fire act for them, at the
expence of fodder, than labour themselves.
There was also, what I cannot help disliking at
breakfast, cheese: it is the custom over all the
Highlands to have it; and it often smells very
strong, and poisons to a certain degree the ele∣gance
of an Indian repast. The day was
showery; however, Rasay and I took a walk,
and had some cordial conversation. I conceived
a more than ordinary regard for this worthy
gentleman. His family has possessed this
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
island above four hundred years. It is the re∣mains
of the estate of Macleod of Lewis, whom
he represents.—When we returned, Dr. Johnson
walked with us to see the old chapel. He was
in fine spirits. He said, “This is truly the
patriarchal life: this is what we came to find.”</P>
<P>After dinner, M'Cruslick, Malcolm, and I,
went out with guns, to try if we could find any
black-cock; but we had no sport, owing to a
heavy rain. I saw here what is called a Danish
fort. Our evening was passed as last night was.
One of our company, I was told, had hurt
himself by too much study, particularly of
infidel metaphysicians, of which he gave a
proof, on second sight being mentioned. He
immediately retailed some of the fallacious ar∣guments
of Voltaire and Hume against miracles
in general. Infidelity in a Highland gentle∣man
appeared to me peculiarly offensive. I
was sorry for him, as he had otherwise a good
character. I told Dr. Johnson that he had studied
himself into infidelity.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Then he
must study himself out of it again. That is
the way. Drinking largely will sober him
again.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>10th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Having resolved to explore the island of
Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I
the last night obtained my fellow traveller's
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
permission to leave him for a day, he being
unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr.
Malcolm M'Cleod, who had obligingly pro∣mised
to accompany me, was at my bedside
between five and six. I sprang up immediately,
and he and I, attended by two other gentle∣men,
traversed the country during the whole
of this day. Though we had passed over not
less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged
ground, and had a Highland dance on the top
of <HI>Dun Can,</HI> the highest mountain in the island,
we returned in the evening not at all fatigued,
and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at
the nightly ball by our less active friends, who
had remained at home.</P>
<P>My survey of Rasay did not furnish much
which can interest my readers; I shall therefore
put into as short a compass as I can, the obser∣vations
upon it, which I find registered in my
Journal. It is about fifteen English miles
long, and four broad. On the south side is
the laird's family seat, situated on a pleasing
low spot. The old tower of three stories,
mentioned by Martin, was taken down soon
after 1746, and a modern house supplies its
place. There are very good grass fields and
corn lands about it, well dressed. I observed,
however, hardly any inclosures, except a good
garden plentifully stocked with vegetables, and
strawberries, raspberries, currants, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199"/>
Of one of the rocks just where we landed,
which are not high, there is rudely carved
a square, with a crucifix in the middle. Here,
it is said, the Lairds of Rasay, in old times,
used to offer up their devotions. I could not
approach the spot, without a grateful recol∣lection
of the event commemorated by this
symbol.</P>
<P>A little from the shore, westward, is a kind
of subterraneous house. There has been a na∣tural
fissure, or separation of the rock, running
towards the sea, which has been roofed over
with long stones, and above them turf has been
laid. In that place the inhabitants used to
keep their oars. There are a number of trees
near the house, which grow well; some of
them of a pretty good size. They are mostly
plane and ash. A little to the west of the
house is an old ruinous chapel, unroofed, which
never has been very curious. We here saw
some human bones of an uncommon size.
There was a heel-bone, in particular, which
Dr. M'Leod said was such, that, if the foot
was in proportion, it must have been twenty-seven
inches long. Dr. Johnson would not
look at the bones. He started back from them
with a striking appearance of horrour. Mr.
M'Queen told us, it was formerly much the
custom, in these isles, to have human bones
lying above ground, especially in the windows
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
of churches. On the south of the chapel is
the family burying-place. Above the door, on
the east end of it, is a small bust or image of
the Virgin Mary, carved upon a stone which
makes part of the wall. There is no church
upon the island. It is annexed to one of the
parishes of Sky, and the minister comes and
preaches either in Rasay's house, or some other
house, on certain Sundays. I could not but
value the family seat more, for having even the
ruins of a chapel close to it. There was some∣thing
comfortable in the thought of being so
near a piece of consecrated ground. Dr. John∣son
said, “I look with reverence upon every
place that has been set apart for religion;” and
he kept off his hat while he was within the walls
of the chapel.</P>
<P>The eight crosses, which Martin mentions as
pyramids for deceased ladies, stood in a semi∣circular
line, which contained within it the
chapel. They marked out the boundaries of
the sacred territory within which an asylum
was to be had. One of them, which we ob∣served
upon our landing, made the first point
of the semicircle. There are few of them now
remaining. A good way farther north, there
is a row of buildings about four feet high:
they run from the shore on the east along the
top of a pretty high eminence, and so down to
the shore on the west, in much the same direc∣tion
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
with the crosses. Rasay took them to be
the marks for the asylum; but Malcolm
thought them to be false sentinels, a common
deception, of which instances occur in Martin,
to make invaders imagine an island better
guarded. Mr. Donald M'Queen, justly in my
opinion, supposed the crosses which form the
inner circle to be the church's land-marks.</P>
<P>The south end of the island is much covered
with large stones, or rocky strata. The laird
has enclosed and planted part of it with firs,
and he shewed me a considerable space marked
out for additional plantations.</P>
<P><HI>Dun Can</HI> is a mountain three computed miles
from the laird's house. The ascent to it is by
consecutive risings, if that expression may be
used when vallies intervene, so that there is
but a short rise at once; but it is certainly very
high above the sea. The palm of altitude is
disputed for by the people of Rasay and those
of Sky; the former contending for Dun Can,
the latter for the mountains in Sky, over-against
it. We went up the east side of Dun
Can pretty easily. It is mostly rocks all around,
the points of which hem the summit of it.
Sailors, to whom it is a good object as they
pass along, call it Rasay's cap. Before we
reached this mountain, we passed by two lakes.
Of the first, Malcolm told me a strange fabu∣lous
tradition. He said, there was a wild
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
beast in it, a sea-horse, which came and de∣voured
a man's daughter; upon which the
man lighted a great fire, and had a sow roasted
at it, the smell of which attracted the monster.
In the fire was put a spit. The man lay con∣cealed
behind a low wall of loose stones,
and he had an avenue formed for the monster,
with two rows of large flat stones, which
extended from the fire over the summit of
the hill, till it reached the side of the loch.
The monster came, and the man with the red∣hot
spit destroyed it. Malcolm shewed me the
little hiding place, and the rows of stones. He
did not laugh when he told this story. I recol∣lect
having seen in the Scots Magazine, several
years ago, a poem upon a similar tale, per∣haps
the same, translated from the Erse, or
Irish, called <HI>Albin and the Daughter of Mey.</HI></P>
<P>There is a large tract of land, possessed as a
common, in Rasay. They have no regulations
as to the number of cattle. Every man puts
upon it as many as he chooses. From Dun-Can
northward, till you reach the other end of the
island, there is much good natural pasture
unencumbered by stones. We passed over a
spot, which is appropriated for the exercising
ground. In 1745, a hundred fighting men
were reviewed here, as Malcolm told me, who
was one of the officers that led them to the
field. They returned home all but about four∣teen.
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
What a princely thing is it to be able
to furnish such a band! Rasay has the true
spirit of a chief. He is, without exaggeration,
a father to his people.</P>
<P>There is plenty of lime-stone in the island,
a great quarry of free-stone, and some natural
woods, but none of any age, as they cut the
trees for common country uses. The lakes, of
which there are many, are well stocked with
trout. Malcolm catched one of four-and-twenty
pounds weight in the loch next to Dun-Can,
which, by the way, is certainly a Danish
name, as most names of places in these islands
are.</P>
<P>The old castle, in which the family of Rasay
formerly resided, is situated upon a rock very
near the sea. The rock is not one mass of
stone, but a concretion of pebbles and earth,
so firm that it does not appear to have moul∣dered.
In this remnant of antiquity I found
nothing worthy of being noticed, except a
certain accommodation rarely to be found at
the modern houses of Scotland, and which Dr.
Johnson and I fought for in vain at the Laird
of Rasay's new-built mansion, where nothing
else was wanting. I took the liberty to tell
the Laird it was a shame there should be such
a deficiency in civilized times. He acknow∣ledged
the justice of the remark. But perhaps
some generations may pass before the want is
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
supplied. Dr. Johnson observed to me, how
quietly people will endure an evil, which they
might at any time very easily remedy; and
mentioned as an instance, that the present
family of Rasay had possessed the island for
more than four hundred years, and never made
a commodious landing place, though a few
men with pickaxes might have cut an ascent of
stairs out of any part of the rock in a week's
time.</P>
<P>The north end of Rasay is as rocky as the
south end. From it I saw the little isle of
Fladda, belonging to Rasay, all fine green
ground;—and Rona, which is of so rocky a
soil that it appears to be a pavement. I was
told however that it has a great deal of grass,
in the interstices. The Laird has it all in his
own hands. At this end of the island of Rasay, is
a cave in a striking situation. It is in a recess of
a great cleft, a good way up from the sea.
Before it the ocean roars, being dashed against
monstrous broken rocks; grand and aweful
<HI>propugnacula.</HI> On the right hand of it is a
longitudinal cave, very low at the entrance,
but higher as you advance. The sea having
scooped it out, it seems strange and unaccount∣able
that the interior part, where the water
must have operated with less force, should be
loftier than that which is more immediately
exposed to its violence. The roof of it is all
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
covered with a kind of petrifications formed by
drops, which perpetually distil from it. The
first cave have been a place of much safety.—I
find a great difficulty in describing visible ob∣jects.
I must own too that the old castle and
cave, like many other things, of which one
hears much, did not answer my expectations.
People are every where apt to magnify the cu∣riosities
of their country.</P>
<P>This island has abundance of black cattle,
sheep, and goats;—a good many horses, which
are used for plowing, carrying out dung, &amp;c.
I believe the people never ride. There are
indeed no roads through the island, unless a
few detached beaten tracks deserve that name.
Most of the houses are upon the shore; so that
all the people have little boats, and catch fish.
There is great plenty of potatoes here. There
are blackcock in extraordinary abundance, moor∣fowl,
plover, and wild pigeons, which seemed
to me to be the same as we have in pigeon-houses,
in their state of nature. Rasay has no
pigeon-house. There are no hares nor rabbits
in the island, nor was there ever known to be a
fox, till last year, when one was landed on it
by some malicious person, without whose aid
he could not have got thither, as that animal
is known to be a very bad swimmer. He has
done much mischief. There is a great deal of
fish caught in the sea around Rasay; it is a
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
place where one may live in plenty, and even
in luxury. There are no deer; but Rasay told
us he would get some.</P>
<P>They reckon it rains nine months in the
year in this island, owing to its being directly
opposite to the western coast of Sky, where
the watery clouds are broken by high moun∣tains.
The hills here, and indeed all the
heathy grounds in general, abound with the
sweet-smelling plant which the Highlanders call
<HI>gaul,</HI> and (I think) with dwarf juniper in many
places. There is enough of turf, which is their
fewel, and it is thought there is a mine of coal.
—Such are the observations which I made upon
the island of Rasay, upon comparing it with
the description given by Martin, whose book
we had with us.</P>
<P>There has been an ancient league between
the families of Macdonald and Rasay. When∣ever
the head of either family dies, his sword is
given to the head of the other. The present
Rasay has the late Sir James Macdonald's
sword. Old Rasay joined the Highland army
in 1745, but prudently guarded against a for∣feiture,
by previously conveying his estate to
the present gentleman, his eldest son. On that
occasion, Sir Alexander, father of the late Sir
James Macdonald, was very friendly to his
neighbour. “Don't be afraid, Rasay, said he;
I'll use all my interest to keep you safe; and if
<PB N="201" REF="207"/>
your estate should be taken, I'll buy it for the
family.”—And he would have done it.</P>
<P>Let me now gather some gold dust,—some
more fragments of Dr. Johnson's conversation,
without regard to order of time. He said, “he
thought very highly of Bentley; that no man
now went so far in the kinds of learning that he
cultivated; that the many attacks on him were
owing to envy, and to a desire of being known,
by being in competition with such a man; that
it was safe to attack him, because he never an∣swered
his opponents, but let them die away.
It was attacking a man who would not beat
them, because his beating them would make
them live the longer. And he was right not to
answer; for, in his hazardous method of writ∣ing,
he could not but be often enough wrong;
so it was better to leave things to their general
appearance, than own himself to have erred in
particulars.”—He said, “Mallet was the pret∣tiest
drest puppet about town, and always kept
good company. That, from his way of talking,
he saw, and always said, that he had not written
any part of the Life of the Duke of Marlbo∣rough,
though perhaps he intended to do it at
some time, in which case he was not culpable in
taking the pension. That he imagined the
Duchess furnished the materials for her Apo∣logy,
which Hooke wrote, and Hooke furnished
the words and the order, and all that in which
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
the art of writing consists. That the duchess
had not superior parts, but was a bold frontless
woman, who knew how to make the most of her
opportunities in life. That Hooke got a <HI>large</HI>
sum of money for writing her Apology. That
he wondered Hooke should have been weak
enough to insert so profligate a maxim, as that
to tell another's secret to one's friend, is no
breach of confidence; though perhaps Hooke,
who was a virtuous man, as his <HI>History</HI> shews,
and did not wish her well, though he wrote
her Apology, might see its ill tendency, and
yet insert it at her desire. He was acting
only ministerially.”—I apprehend, however,
that Hooke was bound to give his best advice.
I speak as a lawyer. Though I have had clients
whose causes I could not, as a private man,
approve; yet, if I undertook them, I would
not do any thing that might be prejudicial to
them, even at their desire, without warning
them of their danger.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>11th September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was a storm of wind and rain; so we could
not set out. I wrote some of this Journal, and
talked awhile with Dr. Johnson in his room,
and passed the day, I cannot well say how, but
very pleasantly. I was here amused to find
Mr. Cumberland's comedy of the <HI>West-Indian,</HI>
in which he has very well drawn a Highland cha∣racter,
Colin M'Cleod, of the same name with
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
the family under whose roof we now were.
Dr. Johnson was much pleased with the Laird
of Macleod, who is indeed a most promising
youth, and with a noble spirit struggles with
difficulties, and endeavours to preserve his
people. He has been left with an incumbrance
of forty thousand pounds debt, and annuities
to the amount of thirteen hundred pounds
a year. Dr. Johnson said, “If he gets the
better of all this, he'll be a hero; and I hope
he will. I have not met with a young man
who had more desire to learn, or who has learnt
more. I have seen nobody that I wish more to
do a kindness to than Macleod.”—Such was the
honourable elogium, on this young chieftain,
pronounced by an accurate observer, whose
praise was never lightly bestowed.</P>
<P>There is neither justice of peace, nor con∣stable,
in Rasay. Sky has Mr. M'Cleod of
Ulinish, who is the sheriff substitute, and no
other justice of peace. The want of the exe∣cution
of justice is much felt among the
islanders. Macleod very sensibly observed, that
taking away the heritable jurisdictions had not
been of such service in the islands as was ima∣gined.
They had not authority enough in lieu
of them. What could formerly have been
settled at once, must now either take much
time and trouble, or be neglected. Dr. John∣son
said, “A country is in a bad state, which
is governed only by laws; because a thousand
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
things occur for which laws cannot provide,
and where authority ought to interpose. Now
destroying the authority of the chiefs set the
people loose. It did not pretend to bring any
positive good, but only to cure some evil; and
I am not well enough acquainted with the
country to know what degree of evil the heri∣table
jurisdictions occasioned.”—I maintained
hardly any; because the chiefs generally acted
right, for their own sakes.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was now wishing to move.
There was not enough of intellectual entertain∣ment
for him, after he had satisfied his curio∣sity,
which he did, by asking questions, till he
had exhausted the island; and where there was
so numerous a company, mostly young people,
there was such a flow of familiar talk, so much
noise, and so much singing and dancing, that
little opportunity was left for his energetic con∣versation.
He seemed sensible of this; for
when I told him how happy they were at having
him there, he said, “Yet we have not been
able to entertain them much.”—I was fretted,
from irritability of nerves, by M'Cruslick's
too obstreporous mirth. I complained of it to
my friend, observing we should be better if
he was gone.—“No, Sir, said he. He puts
something into our society, and takes nothing
out of it.”—Dr. Johnson, however, had several
opportunities of instructing the company; but
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
I am sorry to say, that I did not pay sufficient
attention to what passed, as his discourse now
turned chiefly on mechanicks, agriculture, and
such subjects, rather than on science and wit.—
Last night Lady Rasay shewed him the opera∣tion
of <HI>wawking</HI> cloth, that is, thickening it in
the same manner as is done by a mill. Here it is
performed by women, who kneel upon the
ground, and rub it with both their hands, sing∣ing
an Erse song all the time. He was asking
questions while they were performing this ope∣ration,
and, amidst their loud and wild howl,
his voice was heard even in the room above.</P>
<P>They dance here every night. The queen
of our ball was the eldest miss Macleod, of
Rasay, an elegant well-bred woman, and cele∣brated
for her beauty over all those regions, by
the name of Miss Flora Rasay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She had been some time at Edinburgh, to which she again went, and was married to my worthy neighbour, Colonel Mure Campbell, now Earl of Loudoun; but she died soon afterwards, leaving one daughter.</NOTE> There seemed
to be no jealousy, no discontent among them,
and the gaiety of the scene was such, that I for
a moment doubted whether unhappiness had
any place in Rasay. But my delusion was soon
dispelled, by recollecting the following lines of
my fellow-traveller:</P>
<Q><L>“Yet hope not life from pain or danger free,</L>
<L>Or think the doom of man revers'd for thee!”</L></Q>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>12th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was a beautiful day, and although we did
not approve of travelling on Sunday, we resolved
to set out, as we were in an island, from whence
one must take occasion as it serves. Macleod
and Talisker sailed in a boat of Rasay's for
Sconser, to take the shortest way to Dunvegan.
M'Crus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick went with them to Sconser, from
whence he was to go to Slate, and so to the
main land. We were resolved to pay a visit at
Kingsburgh, and see the celebrated Miss Flor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Macdonald, who is married to the present Mr.
Macdonald of Kingsburgh; so took that road,
though not so near. All the family, but Lady
Rasay, walked down to the shore to see us de∣part.
Rasay himself went with us in a large
boat, with eight oars, built in his island; as
did Mr. Malcolm M'Cleod, Mr. Donald
M'Queen, Dr. Macleod, and some others.
We had a most pleasant sail between Rasay and
Sky; and passed by a cave, where Martin says
fowls were catched by lighting fire in the
mouth of it. Malcolm remembers this. But
it is not now practised, as few fowls come into
it.</P>
<P>We spoke of death. Dr. Johnson on this
subject observed, that the boastings of some
men, as to dying easily, were idle talk, pro∣ceeding
from partial views. I mentioned
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
Hawthornden's Cypress-grove, where it is said
that the world is a mere show; and that it is un∣reasonable
for a man to wish to continue in the
show-room, after he has seen it. Let him go
cheerfully out, and give place to other specta∣tors.
—<HI>Johnson,</HI> “Yes, Sir, if he is sure he is
to be well, after he goes out of it. But if he
is to grow blind after he goes out of the show∣room,
and never to see any thing again; or if
he does not know whither he is to go next, a
man will not go cheerfully out of a show-room.
No wise man will be contented to die, if he
thinks he is to go into a state of punishment.
Nay, no wise man will be contented to die, if
he thinks he is to fall into annihilation: for
however unhappy any man's existence may
be, he yet would rather have it, than not
exist at all. No; there is no rational principle
by which a man can die contented, but a trust
in the mercy of GOD, through the merits of
Jesus Christ.”—This short sermon, delivered
with an earnest tone, in a boat upon the sea,
which was perfectly calm, on a day appropriated
to religious worship, while every one listened
with an air of satisfaction, had a most pleasing
effect upon my mind.</P>
<P>Pursuing the same train of serious reflection,
he added, that it seemed certain that happiness
could not be found in this life, because so
many had tried to find it, in such a variety of
ways, and had not found it.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214"/>
We reached the harbour of Portree, in Sky,
which is a large and good one. There was ly∣ing
in it a vessel to carry off the emigrants,
called the <HI>Nestor.</HI> It made a short settlement of
the differences between a chief and his clan:</P>
<Q><L>—<HI>Nestor</HI> componere lites</L>
<L>Inter Peleiden festinat &amp; inter Atriden.</L></Q>
<P>We approached her, and she hoisted her co∣lours.
Dr. Johnson and Mr. M'Queen re∣mained
in the boat. Rasay and I, and the rest,
went on board of her. She was a very pretty
vessel, and, as we were told, the largest in
Clyde. Mr. Harrison, the captain, shewed her
to us. The cabin was commodious, and even
elegant. There was a little library, finely
bound. <HI>Portree</HI> has its name from King
James V. having landed there in his tour
through the Western Isles, <HI>Ree</HI> in Erse being
King, as <HI>Re</HI> is in Italian; so it is <HI>Port-royal.</HI>
There was here a tolerable inn. On our land∣ing,
I had the pleasure of finding a letter from
home; and there were also letters to Dr. John∣son
and me from Lord Elibank, which had
been sent after us from Edinburgh.—His lord∣ship's
letter to me was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Dear Boswell,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I flew to Edinburgh the moment I
heard of Mr. Johnson's arrival;” but so defec∣tive
was my intelligence, that I came too late.
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
“It is but justice to believe,” that I could
never forgive myself, nor deserve to be forgiven
by others, if I was to fail in any mark of respect
to that very great genius.—I hold him in the
highest veneration; for that very reason I was
resolved to take no share in the merit, perhaps
guilt, of enticing him to honour this country
with a visit.—I could not persuade myself there
was any thing in Scotland worthy to have a
summer of Samuel Johnson bestowed on it;
but since he has done us that compliment, for
heaven's sake inform me of your motions. I
will attend them most religiously; and though I
should regret to let Mr. Johnson go a mile out
of his way on my account, old as I am, I shall
be glad to go five hundred miles to enjoy a day
of his company. Have the charity to send a
council post<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A term in Scotland for a special messenger, such as was formerly sent with dispatches by the lords of the council.</NOTE> with intelligence; the post does
not suit us in the country.—At any rate write

<P>“I was to have kissed your hands at

<P>At Portree, Mr. Donald M'Queen went to
church and officiated in erse, and then came
to dinner. Dr. Johnson and I resolved that we
should treat the company; so I played the land∣lord,
or master of the feast, having previously
ordered Joseph to pay the bill.</P>
<P>Sir James Macdonald intended to have built
a village here, which would have done great
good. A village is like a heart to a country.
It produces a perpetual circulation, and gives
the people an opportunity to make profit of
many little articles, which would otherwise be
in a good measure lost. We had here a dinner,
<HI>et praeterea nihil.</HI> Dr. Johnson talked none.
When we were about to depart, we found that
Rasay had been before-hand with us, and that
all was paid; I would fain have contested this
matter with him; but seeing him resolved, I
declined it. We parted with cordial embraces
from him and worthy Malcolm. In the even∣ing
Dr. Johnson and I remounted our horses,
accompanied by Mr. M'Queen and Dr.
Macleod. It rained very hard. We rode
what they call six miles, upon Rasay's lands in
Sky, to Dr. Macleod's house. On the road Dr.
Johnson appeared to be somewhat out of spirits.
When I talked of our meeting Lord Elibank,
he said, “I cannot be with him much. I
long to be again in civilized life; but can stay
but a short while” (he meant at Edin∣burgh).
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
He said, “let us go to Dunvegan
to-morrow.”—“Yes, (said I,) if it is not a
deluge.”—“At any rate,” he replied—This
shewed a kind of fretful impatience; nor was it
to be wondered at, considering our disagree∣able
ride. I feared he would give up Mull
and Icolmhill, for he said something of his
apprehensions of being detained by bad wea∣ther
in going to Mull and <HI>Iona.</HI> However I
hoped well. We had a dish of tea at Dr.
Macleod's, who had a pretty good house,
where was his brother, a half-pay officer. His
lady was a polite, agreeable woman. Dr.
Johnson said, he was glad to see that he was
so well married, for he had an esteem for phy∣sicians.
The doctor accompanied us to Kings∣burgh,
which is called a mile farther; but the
computation of Sky has no connection what∣ever
with the real distance.</P>
<P>I was highly pleased to see Dr. Johnson safely
arrived at Kingsburgh, and received by the
hospitable Mr. Macdonald, who, with a most
respectful attention, supported him into the
house. Kingsburgh was compleatly the figure
of a gallant Highlander,—exhibiting “the
graceful mien, and manly looks,” which
our popular Scots song has justly attributed to
that character. He had his Tartan plaid
thrown about him, a large blue bonnet with a
knot of black ribband like a cockade, a brown
short coat of a kind of duffil, a Tartan waist∣coat
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
with gold buttons and gold button-holes,
a bluish philibeg, and Tartan hose. He had
jet black hair tied behind, and was a large
stately man, with a steady sensible countenance.</P>
<P>There was a comfortable parlour with a good
fire, and a dram went round. By and by sup∣per
was served, at which there appeared the
lady of the house, the celebrated Miss Flora
Macdonald. She is a little woman, of a gen∣teel
appearance, and uncommonly mild and
well-bred. To see Dr. Samuel Johnson, the
great champion of the English Tories, salute
Miss Flora Macdonald in the isle of Sky, was
a striking sight; for though somewhat conge∣nial
in their notions, it was very improbable
they should meet here.</P>
<P>Miss Flora Macdonald (for so I shall call
her) told me, she heard upon the main land,
as she was returning to Sky about a fortnight
before, that Mr. Boswell was coming to Sky,
and one Mr. Johnson, a young English buck,
with him. He was highly entertained with
this fancy. Giving an account of the afternoon
which we past at <HI>Anock,</HI> he said, “I, being a
<HI>buck,</HI> had miss in to make tea.”—He was rather
quiescent to-night, and went early to bed. I
was in a cordial humour, and promoted a
cheerful glass. The punch was super-excellent.
Honest Mr. M'Queen observed that I was in
high glee, “my <HI>governour</HI> being gone to bed.”
Yet in reality my heart was grieved, when I
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
recollected that Kingsburgh was embarrassed in
his affairs, and intended to go to America.
However, nothing but what was good was
present, and I pleased myself in thinking that
so spirited a man would be well every where.
I slept in the same room with Dr. Johnson.
Each had a neat bed, with Tartan curtains, in
an upper chamber.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>13th September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The room where we lay was a celebrated
one. Dr. Johnson's bed was the very bed in
which the grandson of the unfortunate King
James the Second<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not call him <HI>the Prince of Wales,</HI> or <HI>the Prince,</HI> because I am quite satisfied that the right which the <HI>House of Stuart</HI> had to the throne is extinguished. I do not call him <HI>the Pre∣tender,</HI> because it appears to me as an insult to one who is still alive, and, I suppose, thinks very differently. It may be a parliamentary expression; but it is not a gentlemanly expression. I <HI>know,</HI> and I exult in having it in my power to tell, that THE ONLY PERSON in the world who is entitled to be offended at this delicacy, “thinks and feels as I do;” and has liberality of mind and generosity of sentiment enough, to approve of my tenderness for what even <HI>has been</HI> Blood-Royal. That he is <HI>a prince</HI> by <HI>courtesy,</HI> cannot be denied; because his mother was the daughter of Sobieski, king of Poland. I shall, therefore, <HI>on that account alone,</HI> distinguish him by the name of <HI>Prince Charles Edward.</HI></NOTE> lay, on one of the nights
after the failure of his rash attempt in 1745-6,
while he was eluding the pursuit of the emissa∣ries
of government, which had offered thirty
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
thousand pounds as a reward for apprehending
him. To see Dr. Samuel Johnson lying in
that bed, in the isle of Sky, in the house of
Miss Flora Macdonald, struck me with such a
groupe of ideas as it is not easy for words to
describe, as they passed through the mind. He
smiled, and said, “I have had no ambitious
thoughts in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This, perhaps, was said in allusion to some lines ascribed to <HI>Pope,</HI> on his lying, at John Duke of Argyll's, at Adderbury, in the same bed in which Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, had slept:</P>
<Q><L>“With no poetick ardour fir'd,</L>
<L>I press the bed where Wilmot lay;</L>
<L>That here he liv'd, or here expir'd,</L>
<L>Begets no numbers, grave or gay.”</L></Q></NOTE>.”—The room was decorated with
a great variety of maps and prints. Among
others, was Hogarth's print of Wilkes grinning,
with the cap of liberty on a pole by him.
That too was a curious circumstance in the
scene this morning; such a contrast was
Wilkes to the above groupe. It reminded me
of Sir William Chambers's Account of Oriental
Gardening, in which we are told all odd,
strange, ugly, and even terrible objects, are
introduced, for the sake of variety: a wild ex∣travagance
of taste which is so well ridiculed
in the celebrated Epistle to him. The following
lines of that poem immediately occurred to me:</P>
<Q><L>“Here, too, O king of vengeance! in thy fane,</L>
<L>Tremendous Wilkes shall rattle his gold chain.”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223"/>
Upon the table in our room I found in the
morning a slip of paper, on which Dr. John∣son
had written with his pencil these words:</P>
<Q><L>“Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum.”</L></Q>
<P>What he meant by writing them I could not tell.
He had catched cold a day or two ago, and
the rain yesterday having made it worse, he
was become very deaf. At breakfast he said,
he would have given a good deal, rather than
not have lain in that bed. I owned he was the
lucky man; and observed, that without doubt
it had been contrived between Mrs. Macdonald
and him. She seemed to acquiesce; adding,
“You know young <HI>bucks</HI> are always favourites
of the ladies.” He spoke of Prince Charles
being here, and asked Mrs. Macdonald “<HI>Who</HI>
was with him? We were told, madam, in Eng∣land,
there was one Miss Flora Macdonald
with him.”—She said, “they were very
right;” and perceiving Dr. Johnson's curiosity,
though he had delicacy enough not to question
her, very obligingly entertained him with a
recital of the particulars which she herself knew
of that escape, which does so much honour to
the humanity, fidelity, and generosity, of the
Highlanders. Dr. Johnson listened to her
with placid attention, and said, “All this
should be written down.”</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="224"/>
From what she told us, and from what I was
told by others personally concerned, and from
a paper of information which Rasay was so
good as to send me, at my desire, I have com∣piled
the following abstract, which, as it con∣tains
some curious anecdotes, will, I imagine
not be uninteresting to my readers, and even,
perhaps, be of some use to future historians.</P>
<P>Prince Charles Edward, after the battle of
Culloden, was conveyed to what is called the
<HI>Long Island,</HI> where he lay for some time concealed.
But intelligence having been obtained where he
was, and a number of troops having come in
quest of him, it became absolutely necessary
for him to quit that country without delay.
Miss Flora Macdonald, then a young lady,
animated by what she thought the sacred prin∣ciple
of loyalty, offered, with the magnanimity
of a Heroine, to accompany him in an open
boat to Sky, though the coast they were to quit
was guarded by ships. He dressed himself in
women's clothes, and passed as her supposed
maid by the name of Betty Bourke, an Irish
girl. They got off undiscovered, though
several shots were fired to bring them to, and
landed at Mugstot, the seat of Sir Alexander
Macdonald. Sir Alexander was then at Fort
Augustus, with the Duke of Cumberland; but
his lady was at home. Prince Charles took his
post upon a hill near the house. Flora Mac∣donald
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
waited on Lady Margaret, and ac∣quainted
her of the enterprise in which she was
engaged. Her ladyship, whose active benevo∣lence
was ever seconded by superior talents,
shewed a perfect presence of mind, and readi∣ness
of invention, and at once settled that
Prince Charles should be conducted to old
Rasay, who was himself concealed with some
select friends. The plan was instantly com∣municated
to Kingsburgh, who was dispatched
to the hill to inform the Wanderer, and carry
him refreshments. When Kingsburgh ap∣proached,
he started up, and advanced, hold∣ing
a large knotted stick, and in appearance
ready to knock him down, till he said, “I am
Macdonald of Kingsburgh, come to serve
your highness.” The Wanderer answered,
“It is well,” and was satisfied with the plan.</P>
<P>Flora Macdonald dined with Lady Margaret,
at whose table there sat an officer of the army,
stationed here with a party of soldiers, to watch
for Prince Charles in case of his flying to the
isle of Sky. She afterwards often laughed in
good humour with this gentleman, on her
having so well deceived him.</P>
<P>After dinner, Flora Macdonald on horse-back,
and her supposed maid and Kingsburgh,
with a servant carrying some linnen, all on
foot, proceeded towards that gentleman's
house. Upon the road was a small rivulet
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
which they were obliged to cross. The Wan∣derer,
forgetting his assumed sex, that his
clothes might not be wet, held them up a great
deal too high. Kingsburgh mentioned this
to him, observing, it might make a discovery.
He said, he would be more careful for the fu∣ture.
He was as good as his word; for the
next brook they crossed, he did not hold up his
clothes at all, but let them float upon the
water. He was very aukward in his female
dress. His size was so large, and his strides so
great, that some women whom they met re∣ported
that they had seen a very big woman,
who looked like a man in women's clothes,
and that perhaps it was (as they expressed
themselves) the <HI>Prince,</HI> after whom so much
search was making.</P>
<P>At Kingsburgh he met with a most cordial
reception; seemed gay at supper, and after it
indulged himself in a cheerful glass with his
worthy host. As he had not had his clothes off
for a long time, the comfort of a good bed was
highly relished by him, and he slept soundly
till next day at one o'clock.</P>
<P>The mistress of Corrichatachin told me, that
in the forenoon she went into her father's room,
who was also in bed, and suggested to him her
apprehensions that a party of the military
might come up, and that his guest and he had
better not remain here too long. Her father
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
said, “Let the poor man repose himself after
his fatigues; and as for me, I care not, though
they take off this old grey head ten or eleven
years sooner than I should die in the course of
nature.” He then wrapped himself in the bed∣clothes,
and again fell fast asleep.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of that day, the Wanderer,
still in the same dress, set out for Portree, with
Flora Macdonald and a man servant. His
shoes being very bad, Kingsburgh provided him
with a new pair, and taking up the old ones,
said, “I will faithfully keep them till you are
safely settled at St. James's. I will then intro∣duce
myself, by shaking them at you, to put
you in mind of your night's entertainment and
protection under my roof.”—He smiled, and
said, “Be as good as your word!”—Kings∣burgh
kept the shoes as long as he lived. After
his death, a zealous Jacobite gentleman gave
twenty guineas for them.</P>
<P>Old Mrs. Macdonald, after her guest had
left the house, took the sheets in which he had
lain, folded them carefully, and charged her
daughter that they should be kept unwashed,
and that, when she died, her body should be
wrapped in them as a winding sheet. Her
will was religiously observed.</P>
<P>Upon the road to Portree, Prince Charles
changed his dress, and put on man's clothes
again; a tartan short coat and waistcoat, with
<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
philibeg and short hose, a plaid, and a wig
and bonnet.</P>
<P>Mr. Donald M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, called Donald Roy,
had been sent express to the present Rasay,
then the young laird, who was at that time at
his sister's house, about three miles from
Portree, attending his brother, Dr. Macleod,
who was recovering of a wound he had received
at the battle of Culloden. Mr. M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald
communicated to young Rasay the plan of con∣veying
the Wanderer to where old Rasay was;
but was told that old Rasay had fled to Knoi∣dart,
a part of Glengary's estate. There was
then a dilemma what should be done. Donald
Roy proposed that he should conduct the Wan∣derer
to the main land; but young Rasay
thought it too dangerous at that time, and said
it would be better to conceal him in the island
of Rasay, till old Rasay could be informed
where he was, and give his advice what was
best. But the difficulty was, how to get him
to Rasay. They could not trust a Portree
crew, and all the Rasay boats had been de∣stroyed,
or carried off by the military, except
two belonging to Malcolm M'Leod, which he
had concealed somewhere.</P>
<P>Dr. M'Leod being informed of this diffi∣culty,
said he would risk his life once more for
Prince Charles; and it having occurred, that
there was a little boat upon a fresh-water lake
<PB N="223" REF="229"/>
in the neighbourhood, the two brothers, with
the help of some women, brought it to
the sea, by extraordinary exertion, across a
Highland mile of land, one half of which was
bog, and the other a steep precipice.</P>
<P>These gallant brothers, with the assistance of
one little boy, rowed the small boat to Rasay,
where they were to endeavour to find Captain
Macleod, as Malcolm was then called, and
get one of his good boats, with which they
might return to Portree, and receive the Wan∣derer;
or, in case of not finding him, they
were to make the small boat serve, though the
danger was considerable.</P>
<P>Fortunately, on their first landing, they
found their cousin Malcolm, who, with the
utmost alacrity, got ready one of his boats,
with two sturdy men, John M'Kenzie, and
Donald M'Friar. Malcolm, being the oldest
man, and most cautious, said, that as young
Rasay had not hitherto appeared in the unfor∣tunate
business, he ought not to run any risk;
but that Dr. M'Leod and himself, who were
already publickly engaged, should go on this
expedition. Young Rasay answered, with an
oath, that he would go, at the risk of his life
and fortune.—“In GOD's name then (said
Malcolm) let us proceed.” The two boatmen,
however, now stopped short, till they should
be informed of their destination; and M'Kenzie
<PB N="224" REF="230"/>
declared he would not move an oar till he knew
where they were going. Upon which they
were both sworn to secresy; and the business
being imparted to them, they were keen for
putting off to sea without loss of time. The
boat soon landed about half a mile from the
inn at Portree.</P>
<P>All this was negotiated before the Wanderer
got forward to Portree. Malcolm M'Leod, and
M'Friar, were dispatched to look for him. In
a short time he appeared, and went into the
publick house. There Donald Roy, whom he
had seen at Mugstot, received him, and in∣formed
him of what had been concerted. Here
he wanted silver for a guinea. The landlord
had but thirteen shillings. He was going to
accept of this for his guinea; but Donald Roy
very judiciously observed, that it would dis∣cover
him to be some great man; so he de∣sisted.
He slipped out of the house, leaving
his fair protectress, whom he never again saw;
and Malcolm M'Leod was presented to him by
Donald Roy, as a captain in his army. Young
Rasay and Dr. M'Leod had waited, in impa∣tient
anxiety, in the boat. When he came,
their names were announced to him. He
would not permit the usual ceremonies of re∣spect,
but saluted them as his equals.</P>
<P>Donald Roy staid in Sky, to be in readiness
to get intelligence, and give an alarm in case
<PB N="225" REF="231"/>
the troops should discover the retreat to Rasay;
and Prince Charles was then conveyed in a
boat to that island in the night. He slept a
little upon the passage, and they landed about
day-break. There was some difficulty in ac∣commodating
him with a lodging, as almost
all the houses in the island had been burnt by
the soldiery. They repaired to a little hut,
which some shepherds had lately built, and
having prepared it as well as they could, and
made a bed of heath for the stranger, they
kindled a fire, and partook of some provisions
which had been sent with him from Kingsburgh.
It was observed, that he would not taste wheat∣bread,
or brandy, while oat-bread and whisky
lasted; “for these, said he, are my own
country bread and drink.”—This was very
engaging to the Highlanders.</P>
<P>Young Rasay being the only person of the
company that durst appear with safety, he went
in quest of something fresh for them to eat;
but though he was amidst his own cows,
sheep, and goats, he could not venture to take
any of them for fear of a discovery, but was
obliged to supply himself by stealth. He
therefore catched a kid, and brought it to the
hut in his plaid, and it was killed and drest,
and furnished them a meal which they relished
much. The distressed Wanderer, whose health
was now a good deal impaired by hunger, fa∣tigue,
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
and watching, slept a long time, but
seemed to be frequently disturbed. Malcolm
told me he would start from broken slumbers,
and speak to himself in different languages,
French, Italian, and English. I must how∣ever
acknowledge, that it is highly probable
that my worthy friend Malcolm did not know
precisely the difference between French and
Italian. One of his expressions in English was,
“O GOD! poor Scotland!”</P>
<P>While they were in the hut, M'Kenzie and
M'Friar, the two boatmen, were placed as
sentinels upon different eminences; and one
day an incident happened, which must not be
omitted. There was a man wandering about
the island, selling tobacco. Nobody knew
him, and he was suspected to be a spy. Mac∣kenzie
came running to the hut, and told that
this suspected person was approaching. Upon
which the three gentlemen, young Rasay, Dr.
M'Leod, and Malcolm, held a council of war
upon him, and were unanimously of opinion
that he should be instantly put to death. Prince
Charles, at once assuming a grave and even
severe countenance, said, “GOD forbid that
we should take away a man's life, who may be
innocent, while we can preserve our own.”
The gentlemen however persisted in their reso∣lution,
while he as strenuously continued to
take the merciful side. John M'Kenzie, who
<PB N="227" REF="233"/>
sat watching at the door of the hut, and over∣heard
the debate, said in Erse, “Well, well;
he must be shot. You are the king, but we
are the parliament, and will do what we
choose.”—Prince Charles, seeing the gen∣tlemen
smile, asked what the man had said,
and being told it in English, he observed that
he was a clever fellow, and, notwithstanding
the perilous situation in which he was, laughed
loud and heartily. Luckily the unknown per∣son
did not perceive that there were people in
the hut, at least did not come to it, but walked
on past it, unknowing of his risk. It was after∣wards
found out that he was one of the High∣land
army, who was himself in danger. Had
he come to them, they were resolved to dis∣patch
him; for, as Malcolm said to me, “We
could not keep him with us, and we durst not
let him go. In such a situation, I would have
shot my brother, if I had not been sure of
him.”—John M'Kenzie is alive. I saw him at
Rasay's house. About eighteen years ago, he
hurt one of his legs when dancing, and being
obliged to have it cut off, he now was going
about with a wooden leg. The story of his
being a <HI>member of parliament</HI> is not yet forgotten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I took him out a little way from the house,
gave him a shilling to drink Rasay's health,
and led him into a detail of the particulars
which I have just related.—With less founda∣tion,
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
some writers have traced the idea of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
parliament, and of the British constitution, in
rude and early times. I was curious to know
if he had really heard, or understood, any
thing of that subject, which, had he been a
greater man, would probably have been eagerly
maintained. “Why, John, said I, did you
think the king should be controuled by a par∣liament?”
—He answered, “I thought, Sir,
there were many voices against one.”</P>
<P>The conversation then turning on the times,
the Wanderer said, that, to be sure, the life he
had led of late was a very hard one; but he
would rather live in the way he now did, for
ten years, than fall into the hands of his ene∣mies.
The gentlemen asked him, what he
thought his enemies would do with him, should
he have the misfortune to fall into their hands.
He said, he did not believe they would dare to
take his life publickly, but he dreaded being
privately destroyed by poison or assassination.—
He was very particular in his inquiries about
the wound which Dr. M'Leod had received at
the battle of Culloden, from a ball, which en∣tered
at one shoulder, and went cross to the
other. The doctor happened still to have on
the coat which he wore on that occasion. He
mentioned, that he himself had his horse shot
under him at Culloden; that the ball hit the
horse about two inches from his knee, and
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
made him so unruly that he was obliged to
change him for another. He threw out some
reflections on the conduct of the disastrous af∣fair
at Culloden, saying, however, that perhaps
it was rash in him to do so.—I am now con∣vinced
that his suspicions were groundless;
for I have had a good deal of conversation
upon the subject with my very worthy and in∣genious
friend, Mr. Andrew Lumisden, who
was under secretary to Prince Charles, and
afterwards principal secretary to his father at
Rome, who, he assured me, was perfectly satis∣fied
both of the abilities and honour of the
generals who commanded the Highland army
on that occasion. Mr. Lumisden has written an
account of the three battles in 1745-6, at once
accurate and classical.—Talking of the different
Highland corps, the gentlemen who were pre∣sent
wished to have his opinion which were the
best soldiers. He said, he did not like compa∣risons
among those corps: they were all best.</P>
<P>He told his conductors, he did not think it
adviseable to remain long in any one place;
and that he expected a French ship to come for
him to Lochbroom, among the Mackenzies.
It then was proposed to carry him in one of
Malcolm's boats to Lochbroom, though the
distance was fifteen leagues coastwise. But he
thought this would be too dangerous, and
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
desired that at any rate they might first endeavour
to obtain intelligence. Upon which young
Rasay wrote to his friend, Mr. M'Kenzie of
Applecross, but received an answer, that there
was no appearance of any French ship.</P>
<P>It was therefore resolved that they should
return to Sky, which they did, and landed in
Strath, where they reposed in a cow-house be∣longing
to Mr. Niccolson of Scorbreck. The
sea was very rough, and the boat took in a
good deal of water. The Wanderer asked if
there was danger, as he was not used to such a
vessel. Upon being told there was not, he
sung an Erse song with much vivacity. He
had by this time acquired a good deal of the
Erse language</P>
<P>Young Rasay was now dispatched to where
Donald Roy was, that they might get all the
intelligence they could; and the Wanderer,
with much earnestness, charged Dr. M'Leod to
have a boat ready, at a certain place about
seven miles off, as he said he intended it should
carry him upon a matter of great consequence;
and gave the doctor a case, containing a silver
spoon, knife, and fork, saying, “keep you that
till I see you,” which the doctor understood to
be two days from that time. But all these or∣ders
were only blinds; for he had another plan
in his head, but wisely thought it safest to trust
his secrets to no more persons than was abso∣lutely
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
necessary. Having then desired Malcolm
to walk with him a little way from the house,
he soon opened his mind, saying, “I deliver
myself to you. Conduct me to the Laird of
M'Kinnon's country.”—Malcolm objected
that it was very dangerous, as so many parties
of soldiers were in motion. He answered,
“There is nothing now to be done without
danger.”—He then said, that Malcolm must
be the master, and he the servant; so he took
the bag, in which his linen was put up, and
carried it on his shoulder; and observing that
his waistcoat, which was of scarlet tartan, with
a gold twist button, was finer than Malcolm's,
which was of a plain ordinary tartan, he put on
Malcolm's waistcoat, and gave him his; re∣marking
at the same time, that it did not look
well that the servant should be better dressed
than the master.</P>
<P>Malcolm, though an excellent walker, found
himself excelled by Prince Charles, who told
him, he should not much mind the parties that
were looking for him, were he once but a mus∣ket-shot
from them; but that he was somewhat
afraid of the Highlanders who were against him.
He was well used to walking in Italy in pursuit
of game; and he was even now so keen a
sportsman, that, having observed some par∣tridges,
he was going to take a shot; but Mal∣colm
cautioned him against it, observing that
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
the firing might be heard by the tenders who
were hovering upon the coast.</P>
<P>As they proceeded through the mountains,
taking many a circuit to avoid any houses,
Malcolm, to try his resolution, asked him what
they should do, should they fall in with a party
of soldiers? He answered, “Fight, to be sure!”
—Having asked Malcolm if he should be
known in his present dress, and Malcolm having
replied he would, he said, “Then I'll blacken
my face with powder.”—“That, said Malcolm,
would discover you at once.”—“Then, said
he, I must be put in the greatest deshabille pos∣sible.”
So he pulled off his wig, tied a hand∣kerchief
round his head, and put his night-cap
over it, tore the ruffles from his shirt, took the
buckles out of his shoes, and made Malcolm
fasten them with strings; but still Malcolm
thought he would be known. “I have so odd
a face, said he, that no man ever saw me but
he would know me again.”</P>
<P>He seemed unwilling to give credit to the
horrid narrative of men being massacred in
cold blood, after victory had declared for the
army commanded by the Duke of Cumberland.
He could not allow himself to think that a
general could be so barbarous.</P>
<P>When they came within two miles of M'Kin∣non's
house, Malcolm asked if he chose to see
the laird. “No, said he, by no means. I
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
know M'Kinnon to be as good and as honest
a man as any in the world, but he is not fit
for my purpose at present. You must conduct
me to some other house; but let it be a gen∣tleman's
house.”—Malcolm then determined
that they should go to the house of his brother-in-law,
Mr. John M'Kinnon, and from thence
be conveyed to the main land of Scotland, and
claim the assistance of Macdonald of Scothouse.
The Wanderer at first objected to this, because
Scothouse was cousin to a person of whom he
had suspicions. But he acquiesced in Mal∣colm's
opinion.</P>
<P>When they were near Mr. John M'Kinnon's
house, they met a man of the name of Ross,
who had been a private soldier in the Highland
army. He fixed his eyes steadily on the Wan∣derer
in his disguise, and having at once re∣cognized
him, he clapped his hands, and ex∣claimed,
“Alas! is this the case?” Finding
that there was now a discovery, Malcolm
asked, “What's to be done?” “Swear him
to secresy,” answered Prince Charles. Upon
which Malcolm drew his durk, and on the
naked blade made him take a solemn oath,
that he would say nothing of his having seen
the Wanderer, till his escape should be made
publick.</P>
<P>Malcolm's sister, whose house they reached
pretty early in the morning, asked him who
<PB N="234" REF="240"/>
the person was that was along with him. He
said, it was one Lewis Caw, from Crieff, who
being a fugitive like himself for the same rea∣son,
he had engaged him as his servant, but
that he had fallen sick. “Poor man! said she,
I pity him. At the same time my heart warms
to a man of his appearance.”—Her husband
was gone a little way from home; but was ex∣pected
every minute to return. She set down
to her brother a plentiful Highland breakfast.
Prince Charles acted the servant very well,
sitting at a respectful distance, with his bonnet
off. Malcolm then said to him, “Mr. Caw,
you have as much need of this as I have;
there is enough for us both: you had better
draw nearer and share with me.”—Upon which
he rose, made a profound bow, sat down at
table with his supposed master, and eat very
heartily. After this there came in an old wo∣man,
who, after the mode of ancient hospita∣lity,
brought warm water, and washed Mal∣colm's
feet. He desired her to wash the feet
of the poor man who attended him. She at
first seemed averse to this, from pride, as
thinking him beneath her, and in the peri∣phrastick
language of the Highlanders and the
Irish, said warmly, “Though I wash your
father's son's feet, why should I wash his father's
son's feet?”—She was however persuaded to
do it.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="241"/>
They then went to bed, and slept for some
time; and when Malcolm awaked, he was told
that Mr. John M'Kinnon, his brother-in-law,
was in sight. He sprang out to talk to him
before he should see Prince Charles. After
saluting him, Malcolm, pointing to the sea,
said, “What, John, if the prince should be
prisoner on board one of those tenders?”—
“GOD forbid!” replied John.—“What if we
had him here?” said Malcolm.—“I wish we
had, answered John; we should take care of
him.”—Well, John, said Malcolm, he is in
your house.”—John, in a transport of joy,
wanted to run directly in, and pay his obeisance;
but Malcolm stopped him, saying, “Now is
your time to behave well, and do nothing that
can discover him.”—John composed himself,
and having sent away all his servants upon dif∣ferent
errands, he was introduced into the pre∣sence
of his guest, and was then desired to go
and get ready a boat lying near his house,
which, though but a small leaky one, they re∣solved
to take, rather than go to the Laird of
M'Kinnon. John M'Kinnon however thought
otherwise; and upon his return told them,
that his Chief and Lady M'Kinnon were com∣ing
in the laird's boat. Prince Charles said to
his trusty Malcolm, “I am sorry for this, but
must make the best of it.”—M'Kinnon then
walked up from the shore, and did homage to
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
the Wanderer. His lady waited in a cave, to
which they all repaired, and were entertained
with cold meat and wine.—Mr. Malcolm
M'Leod being now superseded by the Laird of
M'Kinnon, desired leave to return, which was
granted him, and Prince Charles wrote a short
note, which he subscribed <HI>James Thompson,</HI> in∣forming
his friends that he had got away from
Sky, and thanking them for their kindness;
and he desired this might be speedily conveyed
to young Rasay and Dr. M'Leod, that they
might not wait longer in expectation of seeing
him again. He bid a cordial adieu to Mal∣colm,
and insisted on his accepting of a silver
stock-buckle, and ten guineas from his purse,
though, as Malcolm told me, it did not appear
to contain above forty. Malcolm at first begged
to be excused, saying, that he had a few gui∣neas
at his service; but Prince Charles answered,
“You will have need of money. I shall get
enough when I come upon the main land.”</P>
<P>The Laird of M'Kinnon then conveyed him
to the opposite coast of Knoidart. Old Rasay,
to whom intelligence had been sent, was cros∣sing
at the same time to Sky; but as they did
not know of each other, and each had appre∣hensions,
the two boats kept aloof.</P>
<P>These are the particulars which I have col∣lected
concerning the extraordinary conceal∣ment
and escapes of Prince Charles, in the
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
Hebrides. He was often in imminent danger.
The troops traced him from the Long Island,
across Sky, to Portree, but there lost him.</P>
<P>Here I stop,—having received no farther
authentick information of his fatigues and perils
before he escaped to France.—Kings and sub∣jects
may both take a lesson of moderation from
the melancholy fate of the House of Stuart;
that the former may not suffer degradation and
exile, and the latter may not be harrassed by
the evils of a disputed succession.</P>
<P>Let me close the scene on that unfortunate
House with the elegant and pathetick reflec∣tions
of <HI>Voltaire,</HI> in his <HI>Histoire Generale.</HI>—
“Que les hommes privés (says that brilliant
writer, speaking of Prince Charles) qui se croy∣ent
malheureux jettent les yeux sur ce prince
et ses ancêtres.”</P>
<P>In another place he thus sums up the
sad story of the family in general:—“Il n'y
a aucun exemple dans l'histoire d'une maison
si longtems infortunée. Le premier des Rois
d'Ecosse, qui eut le nom de <HI>Jacques,</HI> apres
avoir êtê dix-huit ans prisonnier en Angleterre,
mourut assassiné, avec sa femme, par la main
de ses sujets. <HI>Jacques</HI> II. son fils, fut tué à
vingt-neuf ans en combattant contre les An∣glois.
<HI>Jacques</HI> III. mis en prison par son peu∣ple,
fut tué ensuite par les revoltés, dans une
battaille. <HI>Jacques</HI> IV. perit dans un combat
qui'l perdit. <HI>Marie Stuart,</HI> sa petite fille, chassèe,
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
de son trone, fugitivê en Angleterre, ayant langui
dix-huit ans en prison, se vit condamnée à
mort par des juges Anglais, et eut la téte
tranchée. <HI>Charles</HI> I. petit fils de <HI>Marie,</HI> Roi
d'Ecosse et d'Angleterre, vendu par les Ecos∣sois,
et jugé à mort par les Anglais, mourut
sur un échaffaut dans la place publique. <HI>Jaques,</HI>
son fils, septiéme du nom, et deuxieme en An∣gleterre,
fut chassé de ses trois royaumes; et
pour comble de malheur on contesta à son fils
sa naissance; le fils ne tenta de remonter sur
le trone de ses peres, que pour faire périr ses
amis par des bourreaux; et nous avons vu le
Prince <HI>Charles Edouard,</HI> reunissant en vain les
vertus de ses peres, et le courage du Roi <HI>Jean
Sobieski,</HI> son ayeul maternel, executer les ex∣ploits
et essuyer les malheurs les plus incroy∣ables.
Si quelque chose justifie ceux qui
croyent une fatalité à laquelle rien ne peut se
foustraire, c'est cette suite continuelle de mal∣heurs
qui a persecuté la maison de <HI>Stuart,</HI> pen∣dant
plus de trois-cent années.”</P>
<P>The gallant Malcolm was apprehended in
about ten days after they separated, put aboard
a ship, and carried prisoner to London. He
said, the prisoners in general were very ill
treated in their passage; but there were soldiers
on board who lived well, and sometimes invited
him to share with them: that he had the good
fortune not to be thrown into jail, but was
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
confined in the house of a messenger, of the
name of Dick. To his astonishment, only one
witness could be found against him, though he
had been so openly engaged; and therefore,
for want of sufficient evidence, he was set at
liberty. He added, that he thought himself in
such danger, that he would gladly have com∣pounded
for banishment. Yet, he said, “he
should never be so ready for death as he then
was.”—There is philosophical truth in this. A
man will meet death much more firmly at one
time than another. The enthusiasm even of a
mistaken principle warms the mind, and sets it
above the fear of death; which in our cooler
moments, if we really think of it, cannot but be
terrible, or at least very awful.</P>
<P>Miss Flora Macdonald being then also in
London, under the protection of Lady Prim∣rose,
that lady provided a post-chaise to convey
her to Scotland, and desired she might choose
any friend she pleased to accompany her. She
chose Malcolm. “So (said he, with a trium∣phant
air) I went to London to be hanged, and
returned in a post-chaise with Miss Flora Mac∣donald.”</P>
<P>Mr. M'Leod of Muiravenside, whom we
saw at Rasay, assured us that Prince Charles
was in London in 1759, and that there was
then a plan in agitation for restoring his family.
Dr. Johnson could scarcely credit this story,
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
and said, “There could be no probable plan
at that time. Such an attempt could not have
succeeded, unless the King of Prussia had
stopped the army in Germany; for both the
army and the Fleet would, even without or∣ders,
have fought for the King, to whom they
had engaged themselves.”</P>
<P>Having related so many particulars concern∣ing
the grandson of the unfortunate King
James the Second; having given due praise to
fidelity and generous attachment, which, how∣ever
erroneous the judgement may be, are ho∣nourable
for the heart; I must do the High∣landers
the justice to attest, that I found every
where amongst them a high opinion of the vir∣tues
of the King now upon the throne, and an
honest disposition to be faithful subjects to his
majesty, whose family has possessed the sove∣reignty
of this country so long, that a change,
even for the abdicated family, would now hurt
the best feelings of all his subjects.</P>
<P>The abstract point of <HI>right</HI> would involve us
in a discussion of remote and perplexed ques∣tions;
and after all, we should have no clear
principle of decision. That establishment,
which, from political necessity, took place in
1688, by a breach in the succession of our
kings; and which, whatever benefits may
have accrued from it, certainly gave a shock
to our m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>archy,—the able and constitutional
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
Blackstone wisely rests on the solid footing of
authority.—“Our ancestors having most indis∣putably
a competent jurisdiction to decide this
great and important question, and having, in
fact, decided it, it is now become our duty, at
this distance of time, to acquiesce in their de∣termination.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COMMENTARIES on the Laws of England, Book I. chap. 3.</NOTE>”</P>
<P>Mr. Paley, the present Archdeacon of Car∣lisle,
in his <HI>Principles of Moral and Politicàl Philo∣sophy,</HI>
having, with much clearness of argument,
shewn the duty of submission to civil govern∣ment
to be founded neither on an indefeasible
<HI>jus divinum,</HI> nor on <HI>compact,</HI> but on <HI>expediency,</HI>
lays down this rational position:—“Irregu∣larity
in the first foundation of a state, or sub∣sequent
violence, fraud, or injustice, in getting
possession of the supreme power, are not suffi∣cient
reasons for resistance, after the govern∣ment
is once peaceably settled. No subject of
the <HI>British</HI> empire conceives himself engaged to
vindicate the justice of the <HI>Norman</HI> claim or
conquest, or apprehends that his duty in any
manner depends upon that controversy. So
likewise, if the house of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> or even the
posterity of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> had been at this day
seated upon the throne of <HI>England,</HI> we should
<PB N="242" REF="248"/>
have beenas little concerned to enquire how the
founder of the family came there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since I have quoted Mr. Archdeacon Paley upon one subject, I cannot but transcribe, from his excellent work, a distinguished passage in support of the Christian Revelation.—After shewing, in decent but strong terms, the unfairness of the <HI>indirect</HI> attempts of modern infidels to unsettle and perplex religious principles, and particularly the irony, banter, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer, of one whom he politely calls “an eloquent historian,” the archdeacon thus expresses himself:</P>
<P>“Seriousness is not constraint of thought; nor levity, free∣dom. Every mind which wishes the advancement of truth and knowledge, in the most important of all human researches, must abhor this licentiousness, as violating no less the laws of reasoning than the rights of decency. There is but one de∣scription of men to whose principles it ought to be tolerable. I mean that class of reasoners who can see <HI>little</HI> in christianity, even supposing it to be true. To such adversaries we address this reflection.—Had <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> delivered no other declara∣tion than the following, “The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth,—they that have done well unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damna∣tion,” he had pronounced a message of inestimable import∣ance, and well worthy of that splendid apparatus of prophecy and miracles with which his mission was introduced and at∣tested:—a message in which the wisest of mankind would rejoice to find an answer to their doubts, and rest to their inquiries. It is idle to say that a future state had been disco∣vered already.—It had been discovered as the Copernican Sys∣tem was;—it was one guess amongst many. He alone disovers who <HI>proves;</HI> and no man can prove this point but the teacher who testifies by miracles that his doctrine comes from GOD.”—Book V. chap. 9.</P>
<P>If infidelity be disingenuously dispersed in every shape that is likely to allure, surprise, or beguile the imagination,—in a fable, a tale, a novel, a poem,—in books of travels, of phi∣losophy, of natural history,—as Mr. Paley has well observed,—I hope it is fair in me thus to meet such poison with an unexpected antidote, which I cannot doubt will be found “powerful.”</P></NOTE>.”—Book VI.
chap. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="249"/>
In conformity with this doctrine, I myself,
though fully persuaded that the House of <HI>Stuart</HI>
had originally no right to the crown of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
for that <HI>Baliol,</HI> and not <HI>Bruce,</HI> was the lawful
heir; should yet have thought it very culpable
to have rebelled, on that account, against
Charles I. or even a prince of that house much
nearer the time, in order to assert the claim of
the posterity of Baliol.</P>
<P>However convinced I am of the justice of
that principle which holds allegiance and pro∣tection
to be reciprocal, I do however acknow∣ledge,
that I am not satisfied with the cold sen∣timent
which would confine the exertions of
the subject within the strict line of duty. I
would have every breast animated with the
<HI>fervour</HI> of loyalty; with that generous attach∣ment
which delights in doing somewhat more
than is required, and makes “service perfect
freedom.” And, therefore, as our most gracious
Sovereign, on his accession to the throne,
gloried in being <HI>born a Briton;</HI> so, in my more
private sphere, <HI>Ego me nunc</HI> denique natum, <HI>gra∣tulor.</HI>
I am happy that a disputed succession no
longer distracts our minds; and that a mo∣narchy,
established by law, is now so sanctioned
by time, that we can fully indulge those feel∣ings
of loyalty which I am ambitious to excite.
They are feelings which have ever actuated
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
the inhabitants of the Highlands and the He∣brides.
The plant of loyalty is there in full
vigour, and the Brunswick graft now flourishes
like a native shoot. To that spirited race of
people I may with propriety apply the elegant
lines of a modern poet, on the “facile temper
of the beauteous sex:”</P>
<Q><L>“Like birds new-caught, who flutter for a time,</L>
<L>And struggle with captivity in vain;</L>
<L>But by-and-by they rest, they smooth their plumes,</L>
<L>And to <HI>new masters</HI> sing their former notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Agis,</HI> a tragedy, by John Home.</NOTE>.”</L></Q>
<P>Surely such notes are much better than the
querulous growlings of suspicious Whigs and
discontented Republicans.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Kingsburgh conducted us in his boat, across
one of the lochs, as they call them, or arms of
the sea, which flow in upon all the coasts of
Sky,—to a mile beyond a place called <HI>Grishinish.</HI>
Our horses had been sent round by land to
meet us. By this sail we saved eight miles of
bad riding. Dr. Johnson said, “When we
take into the computation what we have saved,
and what we have gained, by this agreeable
sail, it is a great deal.” He observed, “it is
very disagreeable riding in Sky. The way is
so narrow, one only at a time can travel, so it
is quite unsocial; and you cannot indulge in
meditation by yourself, because you must be
always attending to the steps which your horse
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
takes.”—This was a just and clear description
of its inconveniences.</P>
<P>The topick of emigration being again intro∣duced,
Dr. Johnson said, that “a rapacious Chief
would make a wilderness of his estate.” Mr.
Donald M'Queen told us, that the oppression,
which then made so much noise, was owing to
landlords listening to bad advice in the letting of
their lands; that interested and designing
people flattered them with golden dreams of
much higher rents than could reasonably be
paid; and that some of the gentlemen <HI>tacks∣men,</HI>
or upper tenants, were themselves in part
the occasion of the mischief, by over-rating the
farms of others. That many of the <HI>tacksmen,</HI>
rather than comply with exorbitant demands,
had gone off to America, and impoverished
the country, by draining it of its wealth; and
that their places were filled by a number of poor
people, who had lived under them, properly
speaking, as servants, paid by a certain pro∣portion
of the produce of the lands, though
called sub-tenants. I observed, that if the
men of substance were once banished from a
Highland estate, it might probably be greatly
reduced in its value; for one bad year might
ruin a set of poor tenants, and men of any
property would not settle in such a country,
unless from the temptation of getting land ex∣tremely
cheap; for an inhabitant of any good
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
county in Britain had better go to America
than to the Highlands or the Hebrides. Here
therefore was a consideration that ought to in∣duce
a Chief to act a more liberal part, from a
mere motive of interest, independent of the
lofty and honourable principle of keeping a
clan together, to be in readiness to serve his
king. I added, that I could not help thinking
a little arbitrary power in the sovereign to con∣troul
the bad policy and greediness of the Chiefs,
might sometimes be of service. In France a
Chief would not be permitted to force a number
of the king's subjects out of the country.—Dr.
Johnson concurred with me, observing, that
“were an oppressive chieftain a subject of the
French king, he would probably be admo∣nished
by a <HI>letter.</HI>”</P>
<P>During our sail, Dr. Johnson asked about
the use of the durk, with which he imagined
the Highlanders cut their meat. He was told,
they had a knife and fork besides, to eat with.
He asked, how did the women do? and was
answered, some of them had a knife and fork
too; but in general the men, when they had
cut their meat, handed their knives and forks
to the women, and they themselves eat with
their fingers. The old tutor of Macdonald
always eat fish with his fingers, alledging that
a knife and fork gave it a bad taste. I took
the liberty to observe to Dr. Johnson, that he
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
did so. “Yes, said he; but it is, because I
am short-sighted, and afraid of bones, for
which reason I am not fond of eating many
kinds of fish, because I must use my fingers.”</P>
<P>Dr. Pherson's <HI>Dissertations on Scottish Antiquities,</HI>
which he had looked at when at Corrichatachin,
being mentioned, he remarked, that “you
might read half an hour, and ask yourself what
you had been reading: there were so many
words to so little matter, that there was no
getting through the book.”</P>
<P>As soon as we reached the shore, we took
leave of Kingsburgh, and mounted our horses.
We passed through a wild moor, in many
places so wet that we were obliged to walk,
which was very fatiguing to Dr. Johnson.
Once he had advanced on horseback to a very
bad step. There was a steep declivity on his
left, to which he was so near, that there was
not room for him to dismount in the usual way.
He tried to alight on the other side, as if he had
been a <HI>young buck</HI> indeed, but in the attempt he
fell at his length upon the ground; from which,
however, he got up immediately without being
hurt. During this dreary ride, we were some∣times
relieved by a view of branches of the sea,
that universal medium of connection amongst
mankind. A guide, who had been sent with us
from Kingsburgh, explored the way (much in
the same manner as, I suppose, is pursued in
<PB N="248" REF="254"/>
the wilds of America) by observing certain
marks known only to the inhabitants. We
arrived at Dunvegan late in the afternoon.
The great size of the castle, which is partly old
and partly new, and is built upon a rock close
to the sea, while the land around it presents
nothing but wild, moorish, hilly and craggy
appearances, gave a rude magnificence to the
scene. Having dismounted, we ascended a
flight of steps which was made by the late
M'Leod, for the accommodation of persons
coming to him by land, there formerly being,
for security, no other access to the castle but
from the sea; so that visitors who came by the
land were under the accessity of getting into a
boat, and sailed round to the only place where
it could be approached. We were introduced
into a stately dining-room, and received by
Lady M'Leod, mother of the laird, who, with
his friend Talisker, having been detained on
the road, did not arrive till some time after us.</P>
<P>We found the lady of the house a very polite
and sensible woman, who had lived for some
time in London, and had there been in Dr.
Johnson's company. After we had dined, we
repaired to the drawing-room, where some of
the young ladies of the family, with their mo∣ther,
were at tea. This room had formerly
been the bed-chamber of Sir Roderick M'Leod,
one of the old lairds; and he chose it, because,
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
behind it, there was a considerable cascade,
the sound of which disposed him to sleep.
Above his bed was this inscription: “Sir
Rorie M'Leod of Dunvegan, Knight. GOD
send good rest!” Rorie is the contraction of
Roderick. He was called Rorie <HI>More,</HI> that is,
great Rorie, not from his size, but from his
spirit.—Our entertainment here was in so ele∣gant
a style, and reminded my fellow-traveller
so much of England, that he became quite
joyous. He laughed, and said, “Boswell,
we came in at the wrong end of this island.”
—“Sir, said I, it was best to keep this for the
last.”—He answered, “I would have it both
first and last.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>14th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. Johnson said in the morning, “Is not
this a fine lady?”—There was not a word now
of his “impatience to be in civilized life;”—
though indeed I should beg pardon,—he found
it here. We had slept well, and lain long.
After breakfast we surveyed the castle, and the
garden.—Mr. Bethune, the parish minister,—
Magnus M'Leod of Claggan, brother to
Talisker, and M'Leod of Bay, two substantial
gentlemen of the clan, dined with us. We
had admirable venison, generous wine; in a
word, all that a good table has. This was
really the hall of a chief. Lady M'Leod had
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
been much obliged to my father, who had
settled by arbitration a variety of perplexed
claims between her and her relation, the Laird
of Brodie, which she now repaid by particular
attention to me.—M'Leod started the subject
of making women do penance in the church
for fornication.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It is right, sir.
Infamy is attached to the crime, by universal
opinion, as soon as it is known. I would not
be the man who would discover it, if I alone
knew it, for a woman may reform; nor would I
commend a parson who divulges a woman's first
offence; but being once divulged, it ought to
be infamous. Consider, of what importance to
society the chastity of women is. Upon that
all the property in the world depends. We
hang a thief for stealing a sheep; but the un∣chastity
of a woman transfers sheep, and farm
and all, from the right owner. I have much
more reverence for a common prostitute than
for a woman who conceals her guilt. The
prostitute is known. She cannot deceive. She
cannot bring a strumpet into the arms of an
honest man, without his knowledge.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“There is, however, a great difference be∣tween
the licentiousness of a single woman,
and that of a married woman.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Yes, sir; there is a great difference between
stealing a shilling, and stealing a thousand
pounds; between simply taking a man's purse,
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
and murdering him first, and then taking it.
But when one begins to be vicious, it is easy to
go on. Where single women are licentious,
you rarely find faithful married women.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “And yet we are told that in some
nations in India, the distinction is strictly ob∣served.”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, don't give us India.
That puts me in mind of Montesquieu, who is
really a fellow of genius too in many respects;
whenever he wants to support a strange opinion,
he quotes you the practice of Japan or of some
other distant country, of which he knows no∣thing.
To support polygamy, he tells you of
the island of Formosa, where there are ten
women born for one man. He had but to
suppose another island, where there are ten men
born for one woman, and so make a marriage
between them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What my friend treated as so wild a supposition, has ac∣tually happened in the Western Islands of Scotland, if we may believe Martin, who tells it of the islands of Col and Tyr-yi, and that it is proved by the parish registers.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>At supper, Lady M'Leod mentioned Dr.
Cadogan's book on the gout.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It
is a good book in general, but a foolish one in
particulars. It is good in general, as recom∣mending
temperance and exercise, and cheer∣fulness.
In that respect it is only Dr. Cheyne's
book told in a new way; and there should
come out such a book every thirty years,
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
dressed in the mode of the times. It is foolish,
in maintaining that the gout is not hereditary,
and that one fit of it, when gone, is like a
fever when gone.”—Lady M'Leod objected
that the authour does not practice what he
teaches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a general reflection against Dr. Cadogan, when his very popular book was first published. It was said, that, whatever precepts he might give to others, he himself indulged freely in the bottle. But I have since had the plea∣sure of becoming acquainted with him, and, if his own testi∣mony may be believed, (and I have never heard it impeached,) his course of life has been conformable to his doctrine.</NOTE>.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I cannot help that,
madam. That does not make his book the
worse. People are influenced more by what a
man says, if his practice is suitable to it,—be∣cause
they are blockheads. The more intel∣lectual
people are, the readier will they attend
to what a man tells them. If it is just, they
will follow it, be his practice what it will. No
man practises so well as he writes. I have, all
my life long, been lying till noon; yet I tell
all young men, and tell them with great sin∣cerity,
that nobody who does not rise early will
ever do any good. Only consider! You read a
book; you are convinced by it; you do not
know the authour. Suppose you afterwards
know him, and find that he does not practice
what he teaches; are you to give up your
former conviction? At this rate you would be
kept in a state of equilibrium, when reading
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
every book, till you knew how the authour
practised.”—“But, said Lady M'Leod, you
would think better of Dr. Cadogan, if he acted
according to his principles.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why,
madam, to be sure, a man who acts in the
face of light, is worse than a man who does
not know so much; yet I think no man should
be the worse thought of for publishing
good principles. There is something noble in
publishing truth, though it condemns one's
self.”—I expressed some surprize at Cadogan's
recommending good humour, as if it were
quite in our own power to attain it.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Why, sir, a man grows better humoured as
he grows older. He improves by experience.
When young, he thinks himself of great con∣sequence,
and every thing of importance. As
he advances in life, he learns to think himself
of no consequence, and little things of little
importance; and so he becomes more patient,
and better pleased. All good-humour and
complaisance are acquired. Naturally a child
seizes directly what it sees, and thinks of pleas∣ing
itself only. By degrees, it is taught to
please others, and to prefer others; and that
this will ultimately produce the greatest hap∣piness.
If a man is not convinced of that, he
never will practice it. Common language
speaks the truth as to this: we say, a person
is well-<HI>bred.</HI> As it is said, that all material
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
motion is primarily in a right line, and is
never <HI>per circuitum,</HI> never in another form, un∣less
by some particular cause; so it may be said
intellectual motion is.”—Lady M'Leod asked,
if no man was naturally good?—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No,
madam, no more than a wolf.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Nor
no woman, sir.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir.”—Lady
M'Leod started at this, saying, low, “This is
worse than Swift.”</P>
<P>M'Leod of Ulinish had come in the after∣noon.
We were a jovial company at supper.
The laird, surrounded by so many of his clan,
was to me a pleasing sight. They listened with
wonder and pleasure, while Dr. Johnson ha∣rangued.
I am vexed that I cannot take down
his full strain of eloquence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>15th September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The gentlemen of the clan went away early
in the morning to the harbour of Lochbradale,
to take leave of some of their friends who were
going to America. It was a very wet day. We
looked at Rorie More's horn, which is a large
cow's horn, with the mouth of it ornamented
with silver curiously carved. It holds rather
more than a bottle and a half. Every Laird
of M'Leod, it is said, must, as a proof of his
manhood, drink it off full of claret, without
laying it down.—From Rorie More many of
the branches of the family are descended; in
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
particular, the Talisker branch; so that his
name is much talked of. We also saw his bow,
which hardly any man now can bend, and his
<HI>Glaymore,</HI> which was wielded with both hands,
and is of a prodigious size. We saw here some
old pieces of iron armour, immensely heavy.
The broad-sword now used, though called the
<HI>Glaymore, (i. e.</HI> the <HI>great sword)</HI> is much smaller
than that used in Rorie More's time. There
is hardly a target now to be found in the High∣lands.
After the disarming act, they made
them serve as covers to their butter-milk bar∣rels;
a kind of change, like beating spears
into pruning-hooks.</P>
<P>Sir George Mackenzie's Works (the folio
edition) happened to lie in a window in the
dining-room. I asked Dr. Johnson to look
at the <HI>Characteres Advocatorum.</HI> He allowed
him power of mind, and that he understood
very well what he tells; but said, that there
was too much declamation, and that the Latin
was not correct. He found fault with <HI>appro∣pinquabant,</HI>
in the character of Gilmour. I
tried him with the opposition between <HI>gloria</HI>
and <HI>palma,</HI> in the comparison between Gilmour
and Nisbet, which Lord Hailes, in his Cata∣logue
of the Lords of Session, thinks difficult
to be understood. The words are “<HI>penes illum
gloria, penes hunc palma.</HI>”—In a short Account
of the Kirk of Scotland, which I published
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
some years ago, I applied these words to the
two contending parties, and explained them
thus: “The popular party has most eloquence;
Dr. Robertson's party most influence.”—I was
very desirous to hear Dr. Johnson's explication.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I see no difficulty. Gilmour was
admired for his parts. Nisbet carried his cause
by his skill in law. <HI>Palma</HI> is victory.”—I ob∣served,
that the character of Nicholson, in this
book, resembled that of Burke: for it is said,
in one place, “<HI>In omnes lusos &amp; jocos se saepe resol∣vebat;</HI>”
and, in another, “<HI>sed accipitris more e
conspectu aliquando astantium sublimi se protrahens
volatu, in praedam miro impetu descendebat.”—
Johnson.</HI> “No, sir; I never heard Burke make
a good joke in my life.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But, sir,
you will allow he is a hawk.”—Dr. Johnson,
thinking that I meant this of his joking, said,
“No, sir, he is not the hawk there. He is
the beetle in the mire.”—I still adhered to my
metaphor,—“But he <HI>soars</HI> as the hawk.”—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“Yes, sir; but he catches nothing.”—
M'Leod asked, what is the particular excell∣ence
of Burke's eloquence?—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Copi∣ousness,
and fertility of allusion; a power of
diversifying his matter, by placing it in various
relations. Burke has great knowledge, and
great command of language; though, in my
opinion, it has not in every respect the highest
elegance.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Do you think, sir,
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
that Burke has read Cicero much?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“I don't believe it, sir. Burke has great
knowledge, great fluency of words, and great
promptness of ideas, so that he can speak with
great illustration on any subject that comes be∣fore
him. He is neither like Cicero, nor like
Demosthenes, nor like any one else, but speaks
as well as he can.”</P>
<P>In the 65th page of the first volume of Sir
George Mackenzie, Dr. Johnson pointed out a
paragraph beginning with <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and told
me there was an error in the text, which he bade
me try to discover. I was lucky enough to hit
it at once. As the passage is printed, it is said
that the devil answers <HI>even</HI> in <HI>engines.</HI> I cor∣rected
it to—<HI>ever</HI> in <HI>aenigmas.</HI> “Sir, said he,
you are a good critick. This would have been
a great thing to do in the text of an ancient
authour.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>16th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Last night much care was taken of Dr.
Johnson, who was still distressed by his cold.
He had hitherto most strangely slept without a
night-cap. Miss M'Leod made him a large
flannel one, and he was prevailed with to drink
a little brandy when he was going to bed. He
has great virtue, in not drinking wine or any
fermented liquor, because, as he acknowledged
to us, he could not do it in moderation.—Lady
<PB N="258" REF="264"/>
M'Leod would hardly believe him, and said,
“I am sure, sir, you would not carry it too
far.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, madam, it carried me.
I took the opportunity of a long illness to leave
it off. It was then prescribed to me not to
drink wine; and having broken off the habit, I
have never returned to it.”</P>
<P>In the argument on Tuesday night, about
natural goodness, Dr. Johnson denied that any
child was better than another, but by difference
of instruction; though, in consequence of
greater attention being paid to instruction by
one child than another, and of a variety of im∣perceptible
causes, such as instruction being
counteracted by servants, a notion was con∣ceived,
that of two children, equally well edu∣cated,
one was naturally much worse than ano∣ther.
He owned, this morning, that one
might have a greater aptitude to learn than
another, and that we inherit dispositions from
our parents. “I inherited, said he, a vile me∣lancholy
from my father, which has made me
mad all my life, at least not sober.”—Lady
M'Leod wondered he should tell this.—“Ma∣dam,
said I, he knows that with that madness
he is superior to other men.”</P>
<P>I have often been astonished with what ex∣actness
and perspicuity he will explain the pro∣cess
of any art. He this morning explained to
us all the operation of coining, and, at night,
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
all the operation of brewing, so very clearly,
that Mr. M'Queen said, when he heard the
first, he thought he had been bred in the Mint;
when he heard the second, that he had been
bred a brewer.</P>
<P>I was elated by the thought of having been
able to entice such a man to this remote part
of the world. A ludicrous, yet just, image
presented itself to my mind, which I expressed
to the company. I compared myself to a dog
who has got hold of a large piece of meat, and
runs away with it to a corner, where he may
devour it in peace, without any fear of others
taking it from him. “In London, Reynolds,
Beauclerk, and all of them, are contending
who shall enjoy Dr. Johnson's conversation.
We are feasting upon it, undisturbed, at Dun∣vegan.”</P>
<P>It was still a storm of wind and rain. Dr.
Johnson however walked out with M'Leod,
and saw Rorie More's cascade in full perfection.
Colonel M'Leod, instead of being all life and
gaiety, as I have seen him, was at present grave,
and somewhat depressed by his anxious concern
about M'Leod's affairs, and finding some gen∣tlemen
of the clan by no means disposed to act
a generous or affectionate part to their Chief
in his distress, but bargaining with him as with
a stranger. However, he was agreeable and
polite, and Dr. Johnson said, he was a very
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
pleasing man.—My fellow-traveller and I
talked of going to Sweden; and, while we were
settling our plan, I expressed a pleasure in the
prospect of seeing the king.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I
doubt, sir, if he would speak to us.”—Colonel
M'Leod said, “I am sure Mr. Boswell would
speak to <HI>him.</HI>” But, seeing me a little discon∣certed
by his remark, he politely added, “and
with great propriety.”—Here let me offer a
short defence of that propensity in my disposi∣tion
to which this gentleman alluded. It has
procured me much happiness. I hope it does
not deserve so hard a name as either forwardness
or impudence. If I know myself, it is nothing
more than an eagerness to share the society of
men distinguished either by their rank or their
talents, and a diligence to attain what I desire.
If a man is praised for seeking knowledge,
though mountains and seas are in his way, may
he not be pardoned, whose ardour, in the pur∣suit
of the same object, leads him to encounter
difficulties as great, though of a different kind?</P>
<P>After the ladies were gone from table, we
talked of the Highlanders not having sheets;
and this led us to consider the advantage of
wearing linen.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “All animal sub∣stances
are less cleanly than vegetables. Wool,
of which flannel is made, is an animal sub∣stance;
flannel therefore is not so cleanly as
linen. I remember I used to think tar dirty;
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
but when I knew it to be only a preparation of
the juice of the pine, I thought so no longer.
It is not disagreeable to have the gum that
oozes from a plumb-tree upon your fingers,
because it is vegetable; but if you have any
candle-grease, any tallow upon your fingers,
you are uneasy till you rub it off.—I have
often thought, that, if I kept a seraglio, the
ladies should all were linen gowns,—or cotton;
—I mean stuffs made of vegetable substances.
I would have no silk; you cannot tell when it
is clean: It will be very nasty before it is per∣ceived
to be so. Linen detects its own dirti∣ness.”</P>
<P>To hear the grave Dr. Samuel Johnson,
“that majestick teacher of moral and religious
wisdom,” while sitting solemn in an arm-chair
in the isle of Sky, talk, <HI>ex cathedra,</HI> of his
keeping a seraglio, and acknowledge that the
supposition had <HI>often</HI> been in his thoughts,
struck me so forcibly with ludicrous contrast,
that I could not but laugh immoderately, He
was too proud to submit, even for a moment,
to be the object of ridicule, and instantly re∣taliated
with such keen sarcastick wit, and
such a variety of degrading images, of every
one of which I was the object, that, though I
can bear such attacks as well as most men, I
yet found myself so much the sport of all the
company, that I would gladly expunge from
my mind every trace of this severe retort.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="268"/>
Talking of our friend Langton's house in
Lincolnshire, he said, “the old house of the
family was burnt. A temporary building was
erected in its room; and to this they have
been always adding as the family increased. It
is like a shirt made for a man when he was a
child, and enlarged always as he gro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s older.”</P>
<P>We talked to-night of Luther's allowing the
Landgrave of Hesse two wives, and that it was
with the consent of the wife to whom he was
first married.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “There was no harm
in this, so far as she was only concerned, be∣cause
<HI>volenti non fit injuria.</HI> But it was an of∣fence
against the general order of society, and
against the law of the Gospel, by which one
man and one woman are to be united. No
man can have two wives, but by preventing
somebody else having one.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>17th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After dinner yesterday, we had a conversa∣tion
upon cunning. M'Leod said that he was
not afraid of cunning people; but would let
them play their tricks about him like monkeys.
“But, said I, they'll scratch;” and Mr.
M'Queen added, “they'll invent new tricks,
as soon as you find out what they do.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Cunning has effect from the credulity of
others, rather than from the abilities of those
who are cunning. It requires no extraordinary
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
talents to lye and deceive.”—This led us to
consider whether it did not require great abili∣ties
to be very wicked.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It requires
great abilities to have the <HI>power</HI> of being very
wicked; but not to <HI>be</HI> very wicked. A man
who has the power, which great abilities pro∣cure
him, may use it well or ill; and it requires
more abilities to use it well, than to use it ill.
Wickedness is always easier than virtue; for it
takes the short cut to every thing. It is much
easier to steal a hundred pounds, than to get
it by labour, or any other way. Consider only
what act of wickedness requires great abilities
to commit it, when once the person who is to
do ti has the power; for <HI>there</HI> is the distinction.
It requires great abilities to conquer an army,
but none to massacre it after it is conquered.”</P>
<P>The weather this day was rather better than
any that we had since we came to Dunvegan.
Mr. M'Queen had often talked to me of a cu∣rious
piece of antiquity near this, which he
called a temple of the Goddess <HI>Anaitis.</HI> Having
often talked of going to see it, he and I set out
after breakfast, attended by his man, a fellow
quite like a savage. I must observe here, that
in Sky there seems to be much idleness; for
men and boys follow you, as colts follow
passengers upon a road. The usual figure of a
Sky-boy, is a <HI>lown</HI> with bare legs and feet, a
dirty <HI>kilt,</HI> ragged coat and waistcoat, a bare
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
head, and a stick in his hand, which I suppose
is partly to help the lazy rogue to walk, partly
to serve as a kind of a defensive weapon. We
walked what is called two miles, but is probably
four, from the castle, till we came to the sacred
place. The country around is a black dreary
moor on all sides, except to the sea-coast, to∣wards
which there is a view through a valley;
and the farm of <HI>Bay</HI> shews some good land.
The place itself is green ground, being well
drained, by means of a deep glen on each side,
in both of which there runs a rivulet with a
good quantity of water, forming several cas∣cades,
which make a considerable appearance
and sound. The first thing we came to was an
earthen mound, or dyke, extending from the
one precipice to the other. A little farther on,
was a strong stone wall, not high, but very
thick, extending in the same manner. On the
outside of it were the ruins of two houses, one
on each side of the entry or gate to it. The
wall is built all along of uncemented stones,
but of so large a size as to make a very firm
and durable rampart. It has been built all
about the consecrated ground, except where
the precipice is steep enough to form an en∣closure
of itself. The sacred spot contains
more than two acres. There are within it the
ruins of many houses, none of them large,—a
<HI>cairn,</HI>—and many graves marked by clusters of
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>
stones. Mr. M'Queen insisted that the ruin of
a small building, standing east and west, was
actually the temple of the Goddess <HI>Anaitis,</HI>
where her statue was kept, and from whence
processions were made to wash it in one of the
brooks. There is, it must be owned, a hollow
road visible for a good way from the entrance;
but Mr. M'Queen, with the keen eye of an an∣tiquary,
traced it much farther than I could
perceive it. There is not above a foot and a
half in height of the walls now remaining;
and the whole extent of the building was never,
I imagine, greater than an ordinary Highland
house. Mr. M'Queen has collected a great
deal of learning on the subject of the temple of
<HI>Anaitis;</HI> and I had endeavoured, in my Journal,
to state such particulars as might give some
idea of it, and of the surrounding scenery; but,
from the great difficulty of describing visible
objects, I found my account so unsatisfactory,
that my readers would probably have ex∣claimed
<Q><L>“And write about it, <HI>Goddess,</HI> and about it;”</L></Q>
and therefore I have omitted it.</P>
<P>When we got home, and were again at table
with Dr. Johnson, we first talked of portraits.
He agreed in thinking them valuable in fami∣lies.
I wished to know which he preferred,
fine portraits, or those of which the merit was
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
resemblance.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, their chief ex∣cellence
is in being like.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Are you
of that opinion, as to the portraits of ancestors
whom one has never seen?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It then
becomes of more consequence that they should
be like; and I would have them in the dress of
the times, which makes a piece of history.
One should like to see how <HI>Rorie More</HI> looked.
Truth, sir, is of the greatest value in these
things.”—Mr. M'Queen observed, that if you
think it of no consequence whether portraits
are like, if they are but well painted, you may
be indifferent whether a piece of history is true
or not, if well told.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson said at breakfast to-day, “that it
was but of late that historians bestowed pains
and attention in consulting records, to attain
to accuracy. Bacon, in writing his History of
Henry VII. does not seem to have consulted
any, but to have just taken what he found in
other histories, and blended it with what he
learnt by tradition.” He agreed with me that
there should be a chronicle kept in every con∣siderable
family, to preserve the characters and
transactions of successive generations.</P>
<P>After dinner I started the subject of the
temple of <HI>Anaitis.</HI> Mr. M'Queen had laid stress
on the name given to the place by the country
people, <HI>Ainnit,</HI> and added, “I knew not
what to make of this piece of antiquity, till I
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
met with the <HI>Anaitidis delubrum</HI> in Lydia, men∣tioned
by Pausanias and the elder Pliny.”—Dr.
Johnson, with his usual acuteness, examined
Mr. M'Queen as to the meaning of the word
<HI>Ainnit,</HI> in Erse; and it proved to be a <HI>water∣place,</HI>
or a place near water, “which, said Mr.
M'Queen, agrees with all the descriptions of
the temples of that goddess, which were situ∣ated
near rivers, that there might be water to
wash the statue.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, sir, the ar∣gument
from the name is gone. The name is
exhausted by what we see. We have no occa∣sion
to go to a distance, for what we can pick
up under our feet. Had it been an accidental
name, the similarity between it and <HI>Anaitis</HI>
might have had something in it; but it turns
out to be a mere physiological name.”—Mac∣leod
said, Mr. M'Queen's knowledge of ety∣mology
had destroyed his conjecture.—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“Yes, sir; Mr. M'Queen is like the eagle
mentioned by Waller, who was shot with an
arrow feathered from his own wing.”—Mr.
M'Queen would not, however, give up his con∣jecture.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “You have one possibility
for you, and all possibilities against you. It is
possible it may be the temple of <HI>Anaitis.</HI> But
it is also possible that it may be a fortification;
—or it may be a place of christian worship,
as the first Christians often chose remote and
wild places, to make an impression on the
mind;—or, if it was a heathen temple, it may
<PB N="268" REF="274"/>
have been built near a river, for the purpose of
lustration; and there is such a multitude of di∣vinities,
to whom it may have been dedicated,
that the chance of its being a temple of <HI>Anaitis</HI>
is hardly any thing. It is like throwing a grain
of sand upon the sea-shore to-day, and thinking
you may find it to-morrow. No, sir; this
temple, like many an ill-built edifice, tumbles
down before it is roofed in.”—In his triumph
over the reverend antiquarian, he indulged
himself in a <HI>conceit;</HI> for, some vestige of the
<HI>altar</HI> of the goddess being much insisted on in
support of the hypothesis, he said, “Mr.
M'Queen is fighting <HI>pro</HI> aris <HI>et focis.</HI>”</P>
<P>It was wonderful how well time passed in a
remote castle, and in dreary weather. After
supper, we talked of Pennant. It was objected
that he was superficial. Dr. Johnson defended
him warmly. He said, “Pennant has greater
variety of inquiry than almost any man, and
has told us more than perhaps one in ten thou∣sand
could have done, in the time that he took.
He has not said what he was to tell; so you
cannot find fault with him, for what he has not
told. If a man comes to look for fishes, you
cannot blame him if he does not attend to
fowls.”—“But, said Colonel M'Leod, he men∣tions
the unreasonable rise of rents in the
Highlands, and says, “the gentlemen are for
emptying the bag, without filling it;” for that
is the phrase he uses. Why does he not tell
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
how to fill it?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, there is no end
of negative criticism. He tells what he ob∣serves,
and as much as he chooses. If he tells
what is not true, you may find fault with him;
but though he tells that the land is not well
cultivated, he is not obliged to tell how it may
be well cultivated. If I tell that many of the
Highlanders go bare-footed, I am not obliged
to tell how they may get shoes. Pennant tells
a fact. He need go no farther, except he
pleases. He exhausts nothing; and no subject
whatever has yet been exhausted. But Pennant
has surely told a great deal. Here is a man six
feet high, and you are angry because he is not
seven.”—Notwithstanding this eloquent <HI>Oratio
pro Pennantio,</HI> which they who have read this
gentleman's <HI>Tours,</HI> and recollect the <HI>Savage</HI> and
the <HI>Shopkeeper</HI> at <HI>Monboddo,</HI> will probably im∣pute
to the spirit of contradiction, I still think
that he had better have given more attention to
fewer things, than have thrown together such
a number of imperfect accounts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>18th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Before breakfast, Dr. Johnson came up to
my room, to forbid me to mention that this
was his birth-day; but I told him I had done
it already; at which he was displeased; I sup∣pose
from wishing to have nothing particular
done on his account. Lady M'Leod and I
got into a warm dispute. She wanted to build
<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
a house upon a farm which she has taken, about
five miles from the castle, and to make gardens
and other ornaments there; all of which I ap∣proved
of; but insisted that the seat of the fa∣mily
should always be upon the rock of Dun∣vegan.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Aye, in time we'll build
all round this rock. You may make a very
good house at the farm; but it must not be
such as to tempt the Laird of M'Leod to go
thither to reside. Most of the great families of
England have a secondary residence, which is
called a jointure-house: let this be of that kind.”
—The lady insisted that the rock was very incon∣venient;
that there was no place near it where
a good garden could be made; that it must
always be a rude place; that it was a <HI>Herculean</HI>
labour to make a dinner here.—I was vexed to
find the alloy of modern refinement in a lady
who had so much old family spirit.—“Madam,
said I, if once you quit this rock, there is no
knowing where you may settle. You move
five miles first;—then to St. Andrew's, as the
late Laird did;—then to Edinburgh;—and so
on, till you end at Hampstead, or in France.
No, no; keep to the rock: it is the very Jewel
of the estate. It looks as if it had been let
down from heaven by the four corners, to be
the residence of a Chief. Have all the com∣forts
and conveniencies of life upon it, but
never leave Rorie More's cascade.”—“But
said she, is it not enough if we keep it? Must we
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
never have more convenience than Rorie More
had? He had his beef brought to dinner in
one basket, and his bread in another, Why
not as well be Rorie More all over, as live upon
his rock? And should not we tire, in looking
perpetually on this rock? It is very well for
you, who have a fine place, and every thing
easy, to talk thus, and think of chaining honest
folks to a rock. You would not live upon it
yourself.”—“Yes, madam, said I; I would live
upon it, were I Laird of M'Leod, and should
be unhappy if I were not upon it.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
(with a strong voice, and most determined
manner,) “Madam, rather than quit the old
rock, Boswell would live in the pit; he
would make his bed in the dungeon.”—I felt a
degree of elation, at finding my resolute feudal
enthusiasm thus confirmed by such a sanction.
The lady was puzzled a little. She still re∣turned
to her pretty farm,—rich ground,—fine
garden.—“Madam, said Dr. Johnson, were they
in Asia, I would not leave the rock.”—My
opinion on this subject is still the same. An
ancient family residence ought to be a primary
object; and though the situation of Dunvegan
be such that little can be done here in garden∣ing,
or pleasure-ground, yet, in addition to the
veneration acquired by the lapse of time, it has
many circumstances of natural grandeur suited
to the seat of a Highland Chief: it has the sea,
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
—islands,—rocks,—hills,—a noble cascade;
and when the family is again in opulence,
something may be done by art.</P>
<P>Mr. Donald M'Queen went away to-day, in
order to preach at Bracadale next day. We
were so comfortably situated at Dunvegan,
that Dr. Johnson could hardly be moved from
it. I proposed to him that we should leave
it on Monday. “No, sir, said he; I will not
go before Wednesday. I will have some more
of this good.”—However, as the weather was
at this season so bad, and so very uncertain,
and we had a great deal to do yet, Mr.
M'Queen and I prevailed with him to agree to
set out on Monday, if the day should be good.
Mr. M'Queen, though it was inconvenient for
him to be absent from his harvest, engaged to
wait on Monday at Ulinish for us. When he
was going away, Dr. Johnson said, “I shall
ever retain a great regard for you.” Then
asked him if he had the <HI>Rambler.</HI>—Mr.
M'Queen said, “No; but my brother has it.”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Have you the <HI>Idler?</HI>”—<HI>M'Queen.</HI>
“No, sir.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Then I will order one
for you at Edinburgh, which you will keep in
remembrance of me.”—Mr. M'Queen was
much pleased with this. He expressed to me,
in the strongest terms, his admiration of Dr.
Johnson's wonderful knowledge, and every
other quality for which he is distinguished. I
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
asked Mr. M'Queen, if he was satisfied with
being a minister in Sky. He said he was; but he
owned that his forefathers having been so long
there, and his having been born there, made
a chief ingredient in forming his contentment.
I should have mentioned, that, on our left
hand, between Portree and Dr. M'Leod's
house, Mr. M'Queen told me there had been
a college of the Knights Templars; that tra∣dition
said so; and that there was a ruin re∣maining
of their church which had been burnt:
but I confess Dr. Johnson has weakened my
belief in remote tradition. In the dispute
about <HI>Anaitis,</HI> Mr. M'Queen said, Asia Minor
was peopled by Scythians, and, as they were
the ancestors of the Celts, the same religion
might be in Asia Minor and Sky.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Alas!” sir, what can a nation that has not
letters tell of its original. I have always diffi∣culty
to be patient when I hear authours gravely
quoted, as giving accounts of savage nations,
which accounts they had from the savages
themselves. What can the <HI>M'Craas</HI> tell about
themselves a thousand years ago? There is no
tracing the connection of ancient nations, but
by language; and therefore I am always sorry
when any language is lost, because languages
are the pedigree of nations. If you find the
same language in distant countries, you may be
sure that the inhabitants of each have been the
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
same people; that is to say, if you find the
languages a good deal the same; for a word
here and there being the same, will not do.
Thus Butler, in his <HI>Hudibras,</HI> remembering
that <HI>Penguin,</HI> in the Straits of Magellan, signi∣fies
a bird with a white head, and that the same
word has, in Wales, the signification of a
white-headed wench, <HI>(pen</HI> head, and <HI>guin</HI>
white,) by way of ridicule, concludes that the
people of those Straits are Welch.</P>
<P>A young gentleman of the name of M'Lean,
nephew to the Laird of the isle of Muck, came
this morning; and, just as we sat down to din∣ner,
came the Laird of the isle of Muck him∣self,
his lady, sister to Talisker, two other ladies
their relations, and a daughter of the late
M'Leod of Hamer, who wrote a treatise on
the second sight, under the designation of
<HI>Theophilus Insulanus.</HI> It was somewhat droll to
hear this Laird called by his title. <HI>Muck</HI> would
have sounded ill; so he was called <HI>Isle of Muck,</HI>
which went off with great readiness. The
name, as now written, is unseemly, but is not
so bad in the original Erse, which is <HI>Mouach,</HI>
signifying the Sows' Island. Buchanan calls it
<HI>Insula Porcorum.</HI> It is so called from its form.
Some call it Isle of <HI>Monk.</HI> The Laird insists
that this is the proper name. It was formerly
church-land belonging to Icolmkill, and a
hermit lived in it. It is two miles long, and
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
about three quarters of a mile broad. The
Laird said he had seven score of souls upon it.
Last year he had eighty persons inoculated,
mostly children, but some of them eighteen
years of age. He agreed with a surgeon to
come and do it, at half a crown a head.—It is
very fertile in corn, of which they export some;
and its coasts abound in fish. A taylor comes
there six times in a year. They get a good
blacksmith from the isle of Egg.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>19th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was rather worse weather than any that
we had yet. At breakfast Dr. Johnson said,
“Some cunning men choose fools for their
wives, thinking to manage them, but they
always fail. There is a spaniel fool and a
mule fool. The spaniel fool may be made to
do by beating. The mule fool will neither do
by words nor blows; and the spaniel fool often
turns mule at last: and suppose a fool to be
made do pretty well, you must have the conti∣nual
trouble of making her do. Depend upon
it, no woman is the worse for sense and know∣ledge.”
—Whether afterwards he meant merely
to say a polite thing, or to give his opinion, I
could not be sure: but he added, “Men know
that women are an over-match for them, and
therefore they choose the weakest or most igno∣rant.
If they did not think so, they never
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
could be afraid of women knowing as much as
themselves.”—In justice to the sex, I think it
but candid to acknowledge, that, in a subse∣quent
conversation, he told me that he was
serious in what he had said.</P>
<P>He came to my room this morning before
breakfast, to read my Journal, which he has
done all along. He often before said, “I take
great delight in reading it.” To-day he said,
“You improve: it grows better and better.”—
I observed, there as a danger of my getting a
habit of writing in a slovenly manner.—“Sir,
said he, it is not written in a slovenly manner. It
might be printed, were the subject fit for print∣ing
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As I have faithfully recorded so many minute particulars, I hope I shall be pardoned for indulging my vanity in inserting so flattering an encomium on what is now offered to the publick.</NOTE>.”—While Mr. Beaton preached to us in
the dining-room, Dr. Johnson sat in his own
room, where I saw lying before him, a volume
of Lord Bacon's works, the <HI>Decay of Christian
Piety,</HI> Monboddo's <HI>Origin of Language,</HI> and
Sterne's Sermons.—He asked me to-day, how
we were so little together? I told him, my
Journal took up much time. Yet, on reflec∣tion,
it appeared strange to me, that although
I will run from one end of London to another,
to pass an hour with him, I should omit to seize
any spare time to be in his company, when I
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
am settled in the same house with him. But my
Journal is really a task of much time and la∣bour,
and he forbids me to contract it.</P>
<P>I omitted to mention, in its place, that Dr.
Johnson told Mr. M'Queen that he had found
the belief of the second sight universal in Sky,
except among the clergy, who seemed deter∣mined
against it. I took the liberty to observe
to Mr. M'Queen, that the clergy were actuated
by a kind of vanity. “The world (say they)
takes us to be credulous men in a remote cor∣ner.
We'll shew them that we are more en∣lightened
than they think.” The worthy man
said, that his disbelief of it was from his not
finding sufficient evidence; but I could per∣ceive
that he was prejudiced against it.</P>
<P>After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraor∣dinary
fact of Lady Grange's being sent to
St. Kilda, and confined there for several years,
without any means of relief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The true story of this lady, which happened in this cen∣tury, is as frightfully romantick as if it had been the fiction of a gloomy fancy. She was the wife of one of the Lords of Session is Scotland, a man of the very first blood of his coun∣try. For some mysterious reasons, which have never been discovered, she was seized and carried off in the dark, she knew not by whom, any nightly journies was conveyed to the Highland shores, from whence she was transported by sea to the remote rock of St. Kilda, where she remained, amongst its few wild inhabitants, a forlorn prisoner, but had a con∣stant supply of provisions, and a woman to wait on her. No inquiry was made after her, till she at at last found means to convey a letter to a confidential friend, by the daughter of a Catechist, who concealed it in a clue of yarn. Information being thus obtained at Edinburgh, a ship was sent to bring her off; but intelligence of this being received, she was con∣veyed to M'Leod's island of Herries, where she died.</P>
<P>In <HI>Carstares's State Papers,</HI> we find an authentick narrative of Connor, a catholick priest, who turned protestant, being seized by some of Lord Seaforth's people, and detained pri∣soner in the island of Herries several years; he was fed with bread and water, and lodged in a house where he was exposed to the rains and cold. Sir James Ogilvy writes, (June 18, 1667,) that the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Advocate, and himself, were to meet next day, to take effectual methods to have this redressed. Connor was then still detained. P. 310.—This shews what private oppression might in the last century be practised in the Hebrides.</P>
<P>In the same collection, the Earl of Argyll gives a pictu∣resque account of an embassy from <HI>the great M'Neil of Barra,</HI> as that insular Chief used to be denominated.—“I received a letter yesterday from M'Neil of Barra, who lives very far off, sent by a gentleman in all formality, offering his service, which had made you laugh to see his entry. His stile of his letter runs as if he were of another kingdom.”—P. 643.</P></NOTE>. Dr. Johnson
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>
said, if M'Leod would let it be known that he
had such a place for naughty ladies, he might
make it a very profitable island.—We had, in
the course of our tour, heard of St. Kilda poe∣try.
Dr. Johnson observed, “it must be very
poor, because they have very few images.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “There may be a poetical genius
shewn in combining these, and in making
poetry of them.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, a man can∣not
make fire but in proportion as he has fuel.
He cannot coin guineas but in proportion as
he has gold.”—At tea, he talked of his intend∣ing
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
to go to Italy in 1775. M'Leod said, he
would like Paris better.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir;
there is none of the French literati now alive,
to visit whom I would cross a sea. I can find
in Buffon's book all that he can say<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I doubt the justice of my fellow-traveller's remark con∣cerning the French literati, many of whom, I am told, have considerable merit in conversation, as well as in their writings. That of Monsieur de Buffon. in particular, I am well assured to highly instructive and entertaining.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>After supper he said, “I am sorry that prize-fighting
is gone out; every art should be pre∣served,
and the art of defence is surely im∣portant.
It is absurd that our soldiers should
have swords, and not be taught the use of
them. Prize-fighting made people accustomed
not to be alarmed at seeing their own blood,
or feeling a little pain from a wound. I think
the heavy <HI>glaymore</HI> was an ill-contrived wea∣pon.
A man could only strike once with it.
It employed both his hands, and he must of
course be soon fatigued with wielding it; so
that if his antagonist could only keep playing a
while, he was sure of him. I would fight with
a dirk against Rorie More's sword. I could
ward off a blow with a dirk, and then run in
upon my enemy. When within that heavy
sword, I have him; he is quite helpless, and
I could stab him at my leisure, like a calf.—It
is thought by sensible military men, that the
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
English do not enough avail themselves of
their superior strength of body against the
French; for that must always have a great
advantage in pushing with bayonets. I have
heard an officer say, that if women could be
made to stand, they would do as well as men
in a mere interchange of bullets from a dis∣tance;
but if a body of men should come
close up to them, then to be sure they must be
overcome; now, said he, in the same manner
the weaker-bodied French must be overcome
by our strong soldiers.”</P>
<P>The subject of duelling was introduced.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “There is no case in England where
one or other of the combatants <HI>must</HI> die; if you
have overcome your adversary by disarming
him, that is sufficient, though you should not
kill him; your honour, or the honour of your
family, is restored, as much as it can be by a
duel. It is cowardly to force your antagonist
to renew the combat, when you know that you
have the advantage of him by superior skill.
You might just as well go and cut his throat
while he is asleep in his bed. When a duel
begins, it is supposed there may be an equa∣lity;
because it is not always skill that prevails.
It depends much on presence of mind; nay on
accidents. The wind may be in a man's face.
He may fall. Many such things may decide
the superiority.—A man is sufficiently pu∣nished,
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
by being called out, and subjected to
the risk that is in a duel.”—But on my sug∣gesting
that the injured person is equally sub∣jected
to risk, he fairly owned he could not ex∣plain
the rationality of duelling.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>20th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>When I awaked, the storm was higher still.
It abated about nine, and the sun shone; but
it rained again very soon, and it was not a day
for travelling. At breakfast, Dr. Johnson told
us, that there was once a pretty good tavern in
Catharine-street in the Strand, where very good
company met in an evening, and each man
called for his own half-pint of wine, or gill, if
he pleased; they were frugal men, and nobody
paid but for what he himself drank. The
house furnished no supper; but a woman at∣tended
with mutton-pies, which any body
might purchase. He was introduced to this
company by Cumming the Quaker, and used
to go there sometimes when he drank wine.
He said, that in the last age, when his mother
lived in London, there were two sets of people,
those who gave the wall, and those who took
it; the peaceable and the quarrelsome. When
he returned to Lichfield, after having been in
London, his mother asked him, whether he
was one of those who gave the wall, or those
who took it? “Now, said he, it is fixed that
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
every man keeps to the right; or, if one is
taking the wall, another yields it, and it is
never a dispute.”—He was very severe on a
lady, whose name was mentioned. He said, he
would have her sent to St. Kilda. That she was
as bad as negative badness could be, and stood
in the way of what was good: that insipid
beauty would not go a great way; and that
such a woman might be cut out of a cabbage,
if there was a skilful artificer.</P>
<P>M'Leod was too late in coming to breakfast.
Dr. Johnson said, laziness was worse than the
tooth-ach.—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “I cannot agree with you,
sir; a bason of cold water, or a horse-whip,
will cure laziness.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir; it will
only put off the fit; it will not cure the disease.
I have been trying to cure my laziness all my
life, and could not do it.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But if a
man does in a shorter time what might be the
labour of a life, there is nothing to be said
against him.”—<HI>Johnson</HI> (perceiving at once that
I alluded to him and his Dictionary). “Suppose
that flattery to be true, the consequence would
be, that the world would have no right to cen∣sure
a man; but that will not justify him to
himself.”</P>
<P>After breakfast, he said to me, “A High∣land
Chief should now endeavour to do every
thing to raise his rents, by means of the industry
of his people. Formerly, it was right for him
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
to have his house full of idle fellows; they
were his defenders, his servants, his dependants,
his friends. Now they may be better employed.
The system of things is now so much altered,
that the family cannot have influence but by
riches, because it has no longer the power of
ancient feudal times. An individual of a fa∣mily
may have it; but it cannot now belong to
a family, unless you could have a perpetuity of
men with the same views. M'Leod has four
times the land that the Duke of Bedford has.
I think, with his spirit, he may in time make
himself the greatest man in the king's domi∣nions;
for land may always be improved to a
certain degree. I would never have any man
sell land, to throw money into the funds, as is
often done, or to try any other species of trade.
Depend upon it, this rage of trade will destroy
itself. You and I shall not see it; but the time
will come when there will be an end of it.
Trade is like gaming. If a whole company
are gamesters, play must cease; for there is no∣thing
to be won. When all nations are traders,
there is nothing to be gained by trade, and it
will stop first where it is brought to the greatest
perfection. Then the proprietors of land only
will be the great men.”—I observed, it was
hard that M'Leod should find ingratitude in so
many of this people.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, gratitude
is a fruit of great cultivation; you do not find
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
it among gross people.”—I doubt of this. Na∣ture
seems to have implanted gratitude in all
living creatures. The lion, mentioned by
Valerius Maximus, had it. It appears to me
that culture, which brings luxury and selfish∣ness
with it, has a tendency rather to weaken
then promote this affection.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson said this morning, when talking
of our setting out, that he was in the state in
which Lord Bacon represents kings. He desired
the end, but did not like the means. He wished
much to get home, but was unwilling to travel
in Sky.—“You are like kings too in this, sir,
said I, that you must act under the direction of
others.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>21st September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The uncertainty of our present situation
having prevented me from receiving any letters
from home for some time, I could not help
being uneasy. Dr. Johnson had an advantage
over me, in this respect, he having no wife or
child to occasion anxious apprehensions in his
mind.—It was a good morning; so we resolved
to set out. But, before quitting this castle,
where we have been so well entertained, let me
give a short description of it.</P>
<P>Along the edge of the rock, there are the
remains of a wall, which is now covered with
ivy. A square court is formed by buildings
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
of different ages, particularly some towers,
said to be of great antiquity; and at one place
there is a row of false cannon, of stone. There
is a very large unfinished pile, four stories high,
which we were told was here when <HI>Leod,</HI> the
first of this family, came from the Isle of Man,
married the heiress of the M'Crails, the ancient
possessors of Dunvegan, and afterwards ac∣quired
by conquest as much land as he had got
by marriage. He surpassed the house of
Austria; for he was <HI>felix</HI> both <HI>bella gerere</HI> et
<HI>nubere.</HI> John <HI>Breck</HI> M'Leod, the grandfather
of the late laird, began to repair the castle, or
rather to compleat it; but he did not live to
finish his undertaking. Not doubting, how∣ever,
that he should do it, he, like those who
have had their epitaphs written before they died,
ordered the following inscription, composed
by the minister of the parish, to be cut upon a
broad stone above one of the lower windows,
where it still remains to celebrate what was not
done, and to serve as a memento of the uncer∣tainty
of life, and the presumption of man:</P>
<P>“Joannes Macleod Beganoduni Dominus
gentis suae Philarchus Durinesiae Haraiae Va∣ternesiae,”
&amp;c. Baro D. Florae Macdonald matri∣moniali
vinculo conjugatus turrem hanc Be∣gadonunensem

aerae vulgaris MDCLXXXVI instauravit.</P>
<Q><L>“Quem stabilire juvat proavorum tecta vetusta,</L>
<L>Omne scelus fugiat, justitiamque colat.</L>
<L>Vertit in aerias turres magalia virtus,</L>
<L>Inque casas humiles tecta superba nefas.”</L></Q>
<P>M'Leod and Talisher accompanied us. We
passed by the parish church of <HI>Durinish.</HI> The
church-yard is not enclosed, but a pretty mur∣muring
brook runs along one side of it.
In it is a pyramid erected to the memory of
Thomas Lord Lovat, by his son Lord Simon,
who suffered on Tower-hill. It is of free-stone,
and, I suppose, about thirty feet high. There
is an inscription on a piece of white marble
inserted in it, which I suspect to have been the
composition of Lord Lovat himself, being much
in his pompous style:</P>
<P>“This pyramid was erected by SIMON
LORD FRASER of LOVAT, in honour of Lord
THOMAS his Father, a Peer of Scotland, and
Chief of the great and ancient Clan of the
FRASERS. Being attacked for his birthright
by the family of ATHOLL, then in power and
favour with KING WILLIAM, yet, by the valour
and fidelity of his clan, and the assistance of the
CAMPBELLS, the old friends and allies of his
family, he defended his birthright with such
greatness and fermety of soul, and such valour
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
and activity, that he was an honour to his
name, and a good pattern to all brave Chiefs
of cians. He died in the month of May, 1699,
in the 63d year of his age, in Dunvegan,
the house of the LAIRD of MAC LEOD, whose
sister he had married; by whom he had the
above SIMON LORD FRASER, and several other
children. And, for the great love he bore to
the family of MAC LEOD, he desired to be
buried near his wife's relations, in the place
where two of her uncles lay. And his son,
LORD SIMON, to shew to posterity his great
affection for his Mother's kindred, the brave
MAC LEODS, chooses rather to leave his father's
bones with them, than carry them to his own
burial-place, near Lovat.”</P>
<P>I have preserved this inscription, though of
no great value, thinking it characteristical of a
man who has made some noise in the world.
Dr. Johnson said, it was poor stuff, such as
Lord Lovat's butler might have written.</P>
<P>I observed, in this church-yard, a parcel of
people assembled at a funeral, before the grave
was dug. The coffin, with the corpse in it,
was placed on the ground, while the people
alternately assisted in making a grave. One
man, at a little distance, was busy cutting a
long turf for it, with the crooked spade which
is used in Sky-; a very aukward instrument.
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
The iron part of it is like a plow-coulter. It
has a rude tree for a handle, in which a wooden
pin is placed for the foot to press upon. A
traveller might, without farther inquiry, have
set this down as the mode of burying in Sky.
I was told, however, that the usual way is to
have a grave previously dug.</P>
<P>I observed to-day, that the common way of
carrying home their grain here is in loads on
horseback. They have also a few sleds, or
<HI>cars,</HI> as we call them in Ayrshire, clumsily
made, and rarely used.</P>
<P>We got to Ulinish about six o'clock, and
found a very good farm-house of two stories.
Mr. M'Leod of Ulinish, the sheriff-substitute
of the island, was a plain honest gentleman, a
good deal like an English justice of peace; not
much given to talk, but sufficently sagacious,
and somewhat droll. His daughter, though
she was never out of Sky, was a very well-bred
woman.—Our reverend friend, Mr. Donald
M'Queen, kept his appointment, and met us
here.</P>
<P>Talking of Phipps's voyage to the North
Pole, Dr. Johnson observed, that it “was conjec∣tured
that our former navigators have kept too
near land, and so have found the sea frozen far
north, because the land hinders the free motion
of the tide; but, in the wide ocean, where the
waves tumble at their full convenience, it is
imagined that the frost does not take effect.”</P>

<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>22d September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>In the morning I walked out, and saw a
ship, the Margaret of Clyde, pass by with a
number of emigrants on board. It was a me∣lancholy
sight.—After breakfast, we went to see
what was called a subterraneous house, about a
short mile off. It was upon the side of a rising-ground.
It was discovered by a fox's having
taken up his abode in it, and in chacing him,
they dug into it. It was very narrow and low,
and seemed about forty feet in length. Near
it, we found the foundations of several small
huts, built of stone.—Mr. M'Queen, who is
always for making every thing as ancient as
possible, boasted that it was the dwelling of
some of the first inhabitants of the island, and
observed, what a curiosity it was to find here a
specimen of the houses of the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> which
he believed could be found no where else; and
it was plain that they lived without fire.—Dr.
Johnson remarked, that they who made this
were not in the rudest state; for that it was
more difficult to make <HI>it</HI> than to build a house;
therefore certainly those who made it were in
possession of houses, and had this only as a
hiding-place.—It appeared to me, that the
vestiges of houses, just by it, confirmed Dr.
Johnson's opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="296"/>
From an old tower, near this place, is an
extensive view of Loch-Braccadil, and, at a
distance, of the isles of Barra and South Uist;
and on the land-side, the <HI>Cuillin,</HI> a prodigious
range of mountains, capped with rocky pin∣nacles
in a strange variety of shapes. They
resemble the mountains near Corté in Corsica,
of which there is a very good print. They make
part of a great range for deer, which, though
entirely devoid of trees, is in these countries
called a <HI>forest.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon, Ulinish carried us in his
boat to an island possessed by him, where we
saw an immense cave, much more deserving
the title of <HI>antrum immane</HI> than that of the Sybil
described by Virgil, which I likewise have
visited. It is one hundred and eighty feet long,
about thirty feet broad, and at least thirty feet
high. This cave, we were told, had a remark∣able
echo; but we found none. They said it
was owing to the great rains having made it
damp. Such are the excuses by which the
exaggeration of Highland narratives is pal∣liated.
—There is a plentiful garden at Ulinish,
(a great rarity in Sky) and several trees; and
near the house is a hill, which has an Erse
name, signifying “<HI>the hill of strife,</HI>” where,
Mr. M'Queen informed us, justice was of old
administered. It is like the <HI>mons placiti</HI> of
<HI>Scone,</HI> or those hills which are called <HI>laws,</HI> such
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
as Kelly <HI>law,</HI> North-Berwick <HI>law,</HI> and several
others. It is singular that this spot should
happen now to be the sheriff's residence.</P>
<P>We had a very cheerful evening, and Dr.
Johnson talked a good deal on the subject of
literature.—Speaking of the noble family of
Boyle, he said, that all the Lord Orrerys, till
the present, had been writers. The first wrote
several plays; the second was Bentley's anta∣gonist;
the third wrote the Life of Swift, and
several other things; his son Hamilton wrote
some papers in the <HI>Adventurer</HI> and <HI>World.</HI> He
told us, he was well acquainted with Swift's
Lord Orrery. He said, he was a feeble-minded
man; that, on the publication of Dr. De∣lany's
<HI>Remarks</HI> on his book, he was so much
alarmed that he was afraid to read them. Dr.
Johnson comforted him, by telling him they
were both in the right; that Delany had seen
most of the good side of Swift,—Lord Orrery
most of the bad.—M'Leod asked, if it was not
wrong in Orrery to expose the defects of a man
with whom he lived in intimacy.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why
no, sir, after the man is dead; for then it is done
historically.” He added, “If Lord Orrery had
been rich, he would have been a very liberal pa∣tron.
His conversation was like his writings, neat
and elegant, but without strength. He grasped
at more than his abilities could reach; tried
to pass for a better talker, a better writer, and
<PB N="292" REF="298"/>
a better thinker, than he was. There was a
quarrel between him and his father, in which
his father was to blame; because it arose from
the son's not allowing his wife to keep company
with his father's mistress. The old lord shewed
his resentment in his will,—leaving his library
from his son, and assigning, as his reason, that
he could not make use of it.”</P>
<P>I mentioned the affectation of Orrery, in
ending all his letters on the Life of Swift in
studied varieties of phrase, and never in the
common mode of “<HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c.” an observation
which I remember to have been made several
years ago by old Mr. Sheridan. This species
of affectation in writing, as a foreign lady of
distinguished talents once remarked to me, is
almost peculiar to the English. I took up a
volume of Dryden, containing the <HI>Conquest
of Granada,</HI> and several other plays, of which
all the dedications had such studied conclusions.
Dr. Johnson said, such conclusions were more
elegant, and, in addressing persons of high rank,
(as when Dryden dedicated to the Duke of
York, they were likewise more respectful. I
agreed that <HI>there</HI> it was much better: it was
making his escape from the Royal presence
with a genteel sudden timidity, in place of
having the resolution to stand still, and make a
formal bow.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="299"/>
Lord Orrery's unkind treatment of his son
in his will, led us to talk of the dispositions a
man should have when dying. I said, I did
not see why a man should act differently with
respect to those of whom he thought ill when in
health, merely because he was dying.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“I should not scruple to speak against a party,
when dying; but should not do it against an
individual.—It is told of Sixtus Quintus, that
on his death-bed, in the intervals of his last
pangs, he signed death-warrants.”—Mr.
M'Queen said, he should not do so: he would
have more tenderness of heart.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I
believe I should not either; but Mr. M'Queen
and I are cowards. It would not be from ten∣derness
of heart; for the heart is as tender
when a man is in health as when sick, though
his resolution may be stronger. Sixtus Quintus
was a sovereign as well as a priest; and, if the
criminals deserved death, he was doing his duty
to the last. You would not think a judge died
ill, who should be carried off by an apoplectick
fit while pronouncing sentence of death. Con∣sider
a class of men whose business it is to di∣stribute
death:—soldiers, who die scattering
bullets.—Nobody thinks they die ill on that
account.”</P>
<P>Talking of Biography, he said, he did not
think that the life of any literary man in Eng∣land
had been well written. Beside the com∣mon
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
incidents of life, it should tell us his
studies, his mode of living, the means by
which he attained to excellence, and his opinion
of his own works. He told us, he had sent
Derrick to Dryden's relations, to gather mate∣rials
for his Life; and he believed Derrick had
got all that he himself should have got; but it
was nothing. He added, he had a kindness for
Derrick, and was sorry he was dead.</P>
<P>His notion as to the poems published by
Mr. M'Pherson, as the works of Ossian, was
not shaken here. Mr. M'Queen always evaded
the point of authenticity, saying only that Mr.
M'Pherson's pieces fell far short of those he
knew in Erse, which were said to be Ossian's.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I hope they do. I am not dis∣puting
that you may have poetry of great
merit; but that M'Pherson's is not a transla∣tion
from ancient poetry. You do not believe
it. I say before you, you do not believe it,
though you are very willing that the world
should believe it.”—Mr. M'Queen made no
answer to this.—Dr. Johnson proceeded “I
look upon M'Pherson's <HI>Fingal</HI> to be as gross an
imposition as ever the world was troubled with.
Had it been really an ancient work, a true spe∣cimen
how men thought at that time, it would
have been a curiosity of the first rate. As a
modern production, it is nothing.”—He said,
he could never get the meaning of an <HI>Erse</HI> song
<PB N="295" REF="301"/>
explained to him. They told him, the chorus
was generally unmeaning. “I take it,” said he,
they are like a song which I remember: it was
composed in Queen Elizabeth's time, on the
Earl of Essex; and the burthen was</P>
<Q><L>“Radaratoo, radarate, radara tadara tandore.”</L></Q>
<P>“But surely, said Mr. M'Queen, there were
words to it, which had meaning.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Why yes, sir;” I recollect a stanza, and you
shall have it:</P>
<Q><L>“O! then bespoke the prentices all,</L>
<L>Living in London, both proper and tall,</L>
<L>For Essex's sake they would fight all.</L>
<L>Radaratoo, radarate, radara, tadara, tandore.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This droll quotation, I have since found, was from a song in honour of the Earl of Essex, called “<HI>Queen Eliza∣beth's Champion,</HI>” which is preserved in a collection of Old Ballads, in three volumes, published in London in different years, between 1720 and 1730. The full verse is as follows:
<L>“Oh! then bespoke the prentices all,</L>
<L>Living in London, both proper and tall,</L>
<L>In a kind letter sent strait to the Queen,</L>
<L>For Essex's sake they would fight all.</L>
<L>Raderer two, tandaro te,</L>
<L>Raderer, tandorer, tan do re.”</L></NOTE>”</L></Q>
<P>When Mr. M'Queen began again to expa∣tiate
on the beauty of Ossian's poetry, Dr.
Johnson entered into no further controversy,
but, with a pleasant smile, only cried, “Aye,
aye; <HI>Radaratoo radarate.</HI>”</P>

<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>23d September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I took <HI>Fingal</HI> down to the parlour in the
morning, and tried a test proposed by Mr. Ro∣derick
M'Leod, son to Ulinish. Mr. M'Queen
had said he had some of the poem in the origi∣nal.
I desired him to mention any passage in
the printed book, of which he could repeat the
original. He pointed out one in page 50 of
the quarto edition, and read the Erse, while
Mr. Roderick M'Leod and I looked on the
English;—and Mr. M'Leod said, that it was
pretty like what Mr. M'Queen had recited.
But when Mr. M'Queen read a description of
Cuchullin's sword in Erse, together with a
translation of it in English verse, by Sir James
Foulis, Mr. M'Leod said, that was much liker
than Mr. M'Pherson's translation of the former
passage. Mr. M'Queen then repeated in Erse
a description of one of the horses in Cuchullin's
car. Mr. M'Leod said, Mr. M'Pherson's Eng∣lish
was nothing like it.</P>
<P>When Dr. Johnson came down, I told him
that I had now obtained some evidence con∣cerning
Fingal; for that Mr. M'Queen had
repeated a passage in the original Erse, which
Mr. M'Pherson's translation was pretty like;
and reminded him, that he himself had once
said, he did not require Mr. M'Pherson's
Ossian to be liker the original than Pope's
<PB N="297" REF="303"/>
Homer.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Well, sir, this is just
what I always maintained. He has found
names, and stories, and phrases, nay passages
in old songs, and with them has blended his
own compositions, and so made what he gives
to the world as the translation of an ancient
poem.”—If this was the case, I observed, it
was wrong to publish it as a poem in six books.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Yes, sir; and to ascribe it to a
time too when the Highlanders knew nothing
of <HI>books,</HI> and nothing of <HI>six;</HI>—or perhaps were
got the length of counting six. We have been
told, by Condamine, of a nation that could
count no more than four. This should be told
to Monboddo; it would help him. There is
as much charity in helping a man down-hill as
in helping him up-hill.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “I don't
think there is as much charity.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Yes, sir, if his <HI>tendency</HI> be downwards. 'Till
he is at the bottom, he flounders; get him
once there, and he is quiet. Swift tells, that
Stella had a trick, which she learnt from
Addison, of encouraging a man in absurdity,
instead of endeavouring to extricate him.”</P>
<P>Mr. M'Queen's answers to the inquiries con∣cerning
Ossian were so unsatisfactory, that I
could not help observing, that, were he examined
in a court of justice, he would find himself un∣der
a necessity of being more explicit.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Sir, he has told Blair a little too much,
which is published; and he sticks to it. He
<PB N="298" REF="304"/>
is so much at the head of things here, that
he has never been accustomed to be closely
examined; and so he goes on quite smoothly.”
—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “He has never had any body to
work him.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir; and a man
is seldom disposed to work himself; though he
ought to work himself, to be sure.”—Mr.
M'Queen made no reply<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think it but justice to say, that I believe Dr. Johnson meant to ascribe Mr. M'Queen's conduct to inaccuracy and enthusiasm, and did not mean any severe imputation against him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having talked of the strictness with which
witnesses are examined in courts of justice, Dr.
Johnson told us, that Garrick, though ac∣customed
to face multitudes, when produced
as a witness in Westminster-hall, was so dis∣concerted
by a new mode of publick appear∣ance,
that he could not understand what was
asked. It was a cause where an actor claimed a
<HI>free benefit;</HI> that is to say, a benefit without
paying the expence of the house; but the
meaning of the term was disputed. Garrick
was asked, “Sir, have you a free benefit?”—
“Yes.”—“Upon what terms have you it?”—
“Upon—the terms—of—a free benefit.”—He
was dismissed as one from whom no information
could be obtained.—Dr. Johnson is often too
hard on our friend Mr. Garrick. When I
asked him, why he did not mention him in the
Preface to his Shakspeare, he said, “Garrick has
<PB N="299" REF="305"/>
been liberally paid for any thing he has done
for Shakspeare. If I should praise him, I
should much more praise the nation who paid
him. He has not made Shakspeare better
known. He cannot illustrate Shakspeare. So
I have reasons enough against mentioning him,
were reasons necessary. There should be rea∣sons
<HI>for</HI> it.”—I spoke of Mrs. Montague's very
high praises of Garrick.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, it is
fit she should say so much, and I should say
nothing. Reynolds is fond of her book, and I
wonder at it; for neither I, nor Beauclerk,
nor Mrs. Thrale, could get through it.”</P>
<P>Last night Dr. Johnson gave us an account
of the whole process of tanning,—and of the
nature of milk, and the various operations upon
it, as making whey, &amp;c. His variety of in∣formation
is surprising; and it gives one much
satisfaction to find such a man bestowing his
attention on the useful arts of life. Ulinish
was much struck with his knowledge; and,
said, “He is a great orator, sir: it is
musick to hear this man speak.”—A strange
thought struck me, to try if he knew any thing
of an art, or whatever it should be called,
which is no doubt very useful in life, but which
lies far out of the way of a philosopher and poet;
I mean the trade of a butcher. I enticed him
into the subject, by connecting it with the va∣rious
researches into the manners and customs
<PB N="300" REF="306"/>
of uncivilized nations, that have been made by
our late navigators to the South Seas.—I began
with observing, that Mr. (now Sir Joseph)
Banks tells us, that the art of slaughtering ani∣mals
was not known in Otaheite, for, instead
of bleeding to death their dogs, (a common
food with them,) they strangle them. This he
told me himself; and I supposed that their
hogs were killed in the same way. Dr. John∣son
said, “This must be owing to their not
having knives,—though they have sharp stones
with which they can cut a carcase in pieces
tolerably.” By degrees, he shewed that he knew
something even of butchery. “Different ani∣mals
(said he) are killed differently. An ox is
knocked down, and a calf stunned; but a
sheep has its throat cut, without any thing being
done to stupify it. The butchers have no view to
the ease of the animals, but only to make them
quiet, for their own safety and convenience.
A sheep can give them little trouble.—Hales
is of opinion, that every animal should be
blooded, without having any blow given to it,
because it bleeds better.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “That
would be cruel.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir; there
is not much pain, if the jugular vein be pro∣perly
cut.”—Pursuing the subject, he said,
the kennels of Southwark ran with blood two
or three days in the week; that he was afraid
there were slaughter-houses in more streets in
<PB N="301" REF="307"/>
London than one supposes; (speaking with a
kind of horrour of butchering;) and, yet he
added, “Any of us would kill a cow, rather
than not have beef.”—I said, we <HI>could</HI> not.—
“Yes, said he, any one may. The business of
a butcher is a trade indeed, that is to say,
there is an apprenticeship served to it; but it
may be learnt in a month.”</P>
<P>I mentioned a club in London, at the Boar's
Head in Eastcheap, the very tavern where
Falstaff and his joyous companions met; the
members of which all assume Shakspeare's
characters. One is Falstaff, another Prince
Henry, another Bardolph, and so on. <HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Don't be of it, sir. Now that you have a
name, you must be careful to avoid many
things, not bad in themselves, but which will
lessen your character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not see why I might not have been of this club with∣out lessening my character. But Dr. Johnson's caution against supposing one's self concealed in London, may be very useful to prevent some people from doing many things, not only foolish, but criminal.</NOTE>. This every man who
has a name must observe. A man who is not
publickly known may live in London as he
pleases, without any notice being taken of him;
but it is wonderful how a person of any conse∣quence
is watched. There was a member of
parliament, who wanted to prepare himself to
speak on a question that was to come on in the
House; and he and I were to talk it over toge∣ther.
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>
He did not wish it should be known
that he talked with me; so he would not let
me come to his house, but came to mine.
Some time after he had made his speech in the
house, Mrs. Cholmondeley, a very airy lady,
told me, “Well, you could make nothing of
him!” naming the gentleman; which was a
proof that he was watched.—I had once some
business to do for government, and I went to
Lord North's. Precaution was taken that it
should not be known. It was dark before I
went; yet a few days after I was told, “Well,
you have been with Lord North.” That the
door of the prime minister should be watched,
is not strange; but that a member of parlia∣ment
should be watched, or that my door
should be watched, is wonderful.”</P>
<P>We set out this morning, on our way to
Talisker, in Ulinish's boat, having taken leave
of him and his family. Mr. Donald M'Queen
still favoured us with his company, for which
we were much obliged to him. As we sailed
along, Dr. Johnson got into one of his fits of
railing at the Scots. He owned, that they had
been a very learned nation for a hundred years,
from about 1550 to about 1650; but that they
afforded the only instance of a people among
whom the arts of civil life did not advance in pro∣portion
with learning; that they had hardly any
trade, any money, or any elegance, before the
<PB N="303" REF="309"/>
Union; that it was strange that, with all the
advantages possessed by other nations, they had
not any of those conveniencies and embellish∣ments
which are the fruit of industry, till they
came in contact with a civilized people. “We
have taught you, said he; and we'll do the
same in time to all barbarous nations,—to the
Cherokees,—and at last to the Ouran-Outangs;”
laughing with as much glee as if Monboddo
had been present.—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “We had wine
before the Union.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir; you
had some weak stuff, the refuse of France,
which would not make you drunk.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“I assure you, sir, there was a great deal of
drunkenness.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir; there were
people who died of dropsies, which they con∣tracted
in trying to get drunk.”</P>
<P>I must here glean some of his conversation at
Ulinish, which I have omitted. He repeated
his remark, that a man in a ship was worse
than a man in a jail. “The man in a jail,
said he, has more room, better food, and
commonly better company, and is in safety.”
—“Aye; but, said Mr. M'Queen, the man
in the ship has the pleasing hope of getting to
shore.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I am not talking of a
man's getting to shore; but of a man while he
is in a ship: and then, I say, he is worse than
a man while he is in a jail. A man in a jail
<HI>may</HI> have the “<HI>pleasing hope</HI>” of getting out. A
<PB N="304" REF="310"/>
man confined for only a limited time, actually
<HI>has</HI> it.”—M'Leod mentioned his schemes for
carrying on fisheries with spirit, and that he
would wish to understand the construction of
boats. I suggested that he might go to a dock∣yard
and work, as Peter the Great did.—<HI>John∣son.</HI>
“Nay, sir, he need not work. Peter the
Great had not the sense to see that the mere
mechanical work may be done by any body,
and that there is the same art in constructing a
vessel, whether the boards are well or ill
wrought. Sir Christopher Wren might as well
have served his time to a bricklayer, and first,
indeed, to a brick-maker.”</P>
<P>There is a beautiful little island in the Loch
of Dunvegan, called <HI>Isa.</HI> M'Leod said, he
would give it to Dr. Johnson, on condition of
his residing on it three months in the year;
nay one month. Dr. Johnson was highly
amused with the fancy. I have seen him please
himself with little things, even with mere
ideas like the present. He talked a great deal
of this island;—how he would build a house
there,—how he would fortify it,—how he
would have cannon,—how he would plant,—how
he would sally out, and <HI>take</HI> the isle of
Muck;—and then he laughed with uncommon
glee, and could hardly leave off. I have seen
him do so at a small matter that struck him,
and was a sport to no one else. Mr. Langton
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
told me, that one night he did so while the
company were all grave about him:—only
Garrick, in his significant smart manner, dart∣ing
his eyes around, exclaimed, “<HI>Very</HI> jocose,
to be sure!”—M'Leod encouraged the fancy
of Dr. Johnson's becoming owner of an island;
told him, that it was the practice in this
country to name every man by his lands; and
begged leave to drink to him in that mode:
“<HI>Island Isa,</HI> your health!”—Ulinish, Talisker,
Mr. M'Queen, and I, all joined in our different
manners, while Dr. Johnson bowed to each,
with much good humour.</P>
<P>We had good weather, and a fine sail this
day. The shore was varied with hills, and rocks,
and corn-fields, and bushes, which are here dig∣nified
with the name of natural <HI>wood.</HI> We
landed near the house of Ferneley, a farm pos∣sessed
by another gentleman of the name of
M'Leod, who, expecting our arrival, was wait∣ing
on the shore, with a horse for Dr. Johnson.
The rest of us walked.—At dinner, I expressed
to M'Leod the joy which I had in seeing him
on such cordial terms with his clan. “Go∣vernment,
said he, has deprived us of our an∣cient
power; but it cannot deprive us of our
domestick satisfactions. I would rather drink
punch in one of their houses, (meaning the
houses of his people,) than be enabled, by their
hardships, to have claret in my own.”—This
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
should be the sentiment of every Chiestain.
All that he can get by raising his rents, is more
luxury in his own house. Is it not better to
share the profits of his estate, to a certain de∣gree,
with his kinsmen, and thus have both
social intercourse and patriarchal influence?</P>
<P>We had a very good ride, for about three
miles, to Talisker, where Colonel M'Leod in∣troduced
us to his lady. We found here Mr.
Donald M'Lean, the young Laird of <HI>Col,</HI>
(nephew to Talisker,) to whom I delivered the
letter with which I had been favoured by his
uncle, Professor M'Leod, at Aberdeen. He
was a little lively young man. We found he
had been a good deal in England, studying
farming, and was resolved to improve the value
of his father's lands, without oppressing his
tenants, or losing the ancient Highland fashions.</P>
<P>Talisker is a better place than one commonly
finds in Sky. It is situated in a rich bottom.
Before it is a wide expanse of sea, on each hand
of which are immense rocks; and, at some
distance in the sea, there are three columnal
rocks rising to sharp points. The billows
break with prodigious force and noise on the
coast of Talisker. There are here a good many
well-grown trees. Talisker is an extensive
farm. The possessor of it has, for several ge∣nerations,
been the next heir to M'Leod, as
there has been but one son always in that fa∣mily.
<PB N="307" REF="313"/>
The court before the house is most
injudiciously paved with the round blueish-grey
pebbles which are found upon the sea-shore;
so that you walk as if upon cannon-balls driven
into the ground.</P>
<P>After supper, I talked of the assiduity of the
Scottish clergy, in visiting and privately in∣structing
their parishioners, and observed how
much in this they excelled the English clergy.
Dr. Johnson would not let this pass. He tried
to turn it off, by saying, “there are different
ways of instructing. Our clergy pray and
preach.”—M'Leod and I pressed the subject,
upon which he grew warm, and broke forth:
“I do not believe your people are better in∣structed.
If they are, it is the blind leading
the blind; for your clergy are not instructed
themselves.” Thinking he had gone a little
too far, he checked himself, and added, “When
I talk of the ignorance of your clergy, I talk
of them as a body: I do not mean that there
are not individuals who are learned (looking at
Mr. M'Queen). I suppose there are such a∣mong
the clergy in Muscovy. The clergy of
England have produced the most valuable
books in support of religion, both in theory
and practice. What have your clergy done,
since you sunk into presbyterianism? Can you
name one book of any value, on a religious
subject, written by them?”—We were silent.
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>
—“I'll help you. Forbes wrote very well;
but I believe he wrote before episcopacy was
quite extinguished.”—And then pausing a lit∣tle,
he said, “Yes, you have Wishart AGAINST
Repentance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a dexterous mode of description, for the pur∣pose of his argument; for what he alluded to was, a Sermon published by the learned Dr. William Wishart, formerly prin∣cipal of the college at Edinburgh, to warm men <HI>against</HI> con∣fiding in a death-bed <HI>repentance,</HI> of the inefficacy of which he entertained notions very different from those of Dr. Johnson.</NOTE>.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But, sir, we are not
contending for the superior learning of our
clergy, but for their superior assiduity.”—He
bore us down again, with thundering against
their ignorance, and said to me, “I see you
have not been well taught; for, you have not
charity.”—He had been in some measure forced
into this warmth, by the exulting air which I
assumed; for, when he began, he said, “Since
you <HI>will</HI> drive the nail!”—He again thought
of good Mr. M'Queen, and, taking him by
the hand, said, “Sir, I did not mean any disre∣spect
to you.”</P>
<P>Here I must observe, that he conquered by
deserting his ground, and not meeting the ar∣gument
as I had put it. The assiduity of the
Scottish clergy is certainly greater than that of
the English. His taking up the topick of their
not having so much learning, was, though in∣genious,
yet a fallacy in logick. It was as if
there should be a dispute whether a man's hair
<PB N="309" REF="315"/>
is well dressed, and Dr. Johnson should say,
“Sir, his hair cannot be well dressed; for he
has a dirty shirt. No man who has not clean
linen, has his hair well dressed.”—When some
days afterwards he read this passage, he said,
“No, sir; I did not say that a man's hair
could not be well dressed because he has not
clean linen, but because he is bald.”</P>
<P>He used one argument against the Scottish
clergy being learned, which I doubt was not
good: “As we believe a man dead till we
know that he is alive; so we believe men ig∣norant
till we know that they are learned.”
Now our maxim in law is, to presume a man
alive, till we know he is dead. However, in∣deed,
it may be answered, that we must first
know he has lived; and that we have never
known the learning of the Scottish clergy.
Mr. M'Queen, though he was of opinion that
Dr. Johnson had deserted the point really in
dispute, was much pleased with what he said,
and owned to me, he thought it very just; and
Mrs. M'Leod was so much captivated by his
eloquence, that she told me “I was a good
advocate for a bad cause.”</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="310" REF="316"/>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>24th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This was a good day. Dr. Johnson told us,
at breakfast, that he rode harder at a fox-chace
than any body. “The English, said he, are
the only nation who ride hard a-hunting. A
Frenchman goes out upon a managed horse,
and capers in the field, and no more thinks of
leaping a hedge than of mounting a breach.
Lord Powiscourt laid a wager, in France, that
he would ride a great many miles in a certain
short time. The French academicians set to
work, and calculated that, from the resistance
of the air, it was impossible. His lordship
however performed it.”</P>
<P>Our money being nearly exhausted, we sent
a bill for thirty pounds, drawn on Sir William
Forbes and Co. to Lochbraccadale, but our
messenger found it very difficult to procure cash
for it; at length, however, he got us value from
the master of a vessel which was to carry away
some emigrants. There is a great scarcity of spe∣cie
in Sky. Mr. M'Queen said, he had the utmost
difficulty to pay his servants wages, or to pay
for any little thing which he has to buy. The
rents are paid in bills, which the drovers give.
The people consume a vast deal of snuff and
tobacco, for which they must pay ready money;
and pedlars, who come about selling goods, as
there is not a shop in the island, carry away the
<PB N="311" REF="317"/>
cash. If there were encouragement given to
fisheries and manufactures, there might be a
circulation of money introduced. I got one-and-twenty
shillings in silver at Portree, which
was thought a wonderful store.</P>
<P>Talisker, Mr. M'Queen, and I, walked out,
and looked at no less than fifteen different
water-falls near the house, in the space of about
a quarter of a mile. We also saw Cuchullin's
well, said to have been the favourite spring of
that ancient hero. I drank of it. The water
is admirable. On the shore are many stones
full of chrystallizations in the heart.</P>
<P>Though our obliging friend, Mr. M'Lean,
was but the young laird, he had the title of <HI>Col</HI>
constantly given him. After dinner, he and I
walked to the top of Prieshwell, a very high
rocky hill, from whence there is a view of
Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra,—the Long Island,—Bernera,—the Loch
of Dunvegan,—part of Rum,—part of Rasay,
and a vast deal of the Isle of Sky. Col, though
he had come into Sky with intention to be at
Dunvegan, and pass a considerable time in the
island, most politely resolved first to conduct us
to Mull, and then to return to Sky. This was
a very fortunate circumstance; for he planned
an expedition for us of more variety than
merely going to Mull. He proposed we should
see the islands of <HI>Egg, Muck, Col,</HI> and <HI>Tyr-yi.</HI>
In all of these islands he could shew us every
<PB N="312" REF="318"/>
thing worth seeing; and in Mull he said he
should be as if at home, his father having lands
there, and he a farm.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson did not talk much to-day, but
seemed intent in listening to the schemes of fu∣ture
excursion, planned by <HI>Col.</HI> Dr. Birch,
however, being mentioned, he said, he had
more anecdotes than any man. I said, Percy
had a great many; that he flowed with them,
like one of the brooks here.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “If
Percy is like one of the brooks here, Brich was
like the river Thames. Birch excelled Percy
in that, as much as Percy excels Goldsmith.”
—I mentioned Lord Hailes as a man of anec∣dote.
He was not pleased with him, for pub∣lishing
only such memorials and letters as were
unfavourable for the Stuart family. “If, said
he, a man fairly warns you, “I am to give all
the ill; do you find the good;” he may: but if
the object which he professes be to give a view
of a reign, let him tell all the truth. I would
tell truth of the two Georges, or of that scoun∣drel,
king William.—Granger's Biographical
History is full of curious anecdote, but
might have been better done. The dog is a
Whig. I do not like much to see a Whig in
any dress; but I hate to see a Whig in a par∣son's
gown.”</P>

<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>25th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was resolved that we should set out, in
order to return to Slate, to be in readiness to
take boat whenever there should be fair wind.
Dr. Johnson remained in his chamber writing
a letter, and it was long before we could get
him into motion. He did not come to break∣fast,
but had it sent to him. When he had
finished his letter, it was twelve o'clock, and
we should have set out at ten. When I went
up to him, he said to me, “Do you remember
a song which begins”
<Q><L>“Ev'ry island is a prison</L>
<L>Strongly guarded by the sea;</L>
<L>Kings and princes, for that reason,</L>
<L>Pris'ners are, as well as we.”</L></Q>
I suppose he had been thinking of our confined
situation. He would fain have gone in a boat
from hence, instead of riding back to Slate.
A scheme for it was proposed. He said,
“We'll not be driven tamely from it:”—but
it proved impracticable.</P>
<P>We took leave of M'Leod and Talisker,
from whom we parted with regret. Talisker,
having been bred to physick, had a tincture of
scholarship in his conversation, which pleased
Dr. Johnson, and he had some very good books;
and being a colonel in the Dutch service, he
and his lady, in consequence of having lived
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
abroad, had introduced the ease and politeness
of the continent into this rude region.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Col</HI> was now our leader. Mr.
M'Queen was to accompany us half a day
more. We stopped at a little hut, where we
saw an old woman grinding with the <HI>quern,</HI> the
ancient Highland instrument, which it is said
was used by the Romans, but which, being
very slow in its operation, is almost entirely
gone into disuse.</P>
<P>The walls of the cottages in Sky, instead of
being one compacted mass of stones, are often
formed by two exterior surfaces of stone, filled
up with earth in the middle, which makes
them very warm. The roof is generally bad.
They are thatched, sometimes with straw, some∣times
with heath, sometimes with ferns. The
thatch is secured by ropes of straw, or of health;
and, to fix the ropes, there is a stone tied to the
end of each. These stones hang round the
bottom of the roof, and make it look like a
lady's hair in papers; but I should think that,
when there is wind, they would come down,
and knock people on the head.</P>
<P>We dined at the inn at Sconser, where I had
the pleasure to find a letter from my wife.
Here we parted from our learned companion,
Mr. Donald M'Queen. Dr. Johnson took
leave of him very affectionately, saying, “Dear
sir, do not forget me!”—We settled, that he
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>
should write an account of the Isle of Sky,
which Dr. Johnson promised to revise. He
said, Mr. M'Queen should tell all that he
could; distinguishing what he himself knew,
what was traditional, and what conjectural.</P>
<P>We sent our horses round a point of land,
that we might shun some very bad road; and
resolved to go forward by sea. It was seven
o'clock when we got into our boat. We had
many showers, and it soon grew pretty dark.
Dr. Johnson sat silent and patient. Once he
said, as he looked on the black coast of Sky,—
black, as being composed of rocks seen in the
dusk,—“This is very solemn.” Our boatmen
were rude singers, and seemed so like wild
Indians,. that a very little imagination was
necessary to give one an impression of being
upon an American river. We landed at <HI>Stro∣limus,</HI>
from whence we got a guide to walk be∣fore
us, for two miles, to <HI>Corrichatachin.</HI> Not
being able to procure a horse for our baggage,
I took one portmanteau before me, and Joseph
another. We had but a single star to light us
on our way. It was about eleven when we
arrived. We were most hospitably received
by the master and mistress, who were just go∣ing
to bed, but, with unaffected ready kindness,
made a good fire, and at twelve o'clock at
night had supper on the table.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="322"/>
James Macdonald, of <HI>Knockow,</HI> Kingsburgh's
brother, whom we had seen at Kingsburgh, was
there. He shewed me a bond granted by the
late Sir James Macdonald, to old Kingsburgh,
the preamble of which does so much honour to
the feelings of that much-lamented gentleman,
that I thought it worth transcribing. It was
as follows:</P>
<P>“I, Sir James Macdonald, of Macdonald,
Baronet, now, after arriving at my perfect age,
from the friendship I bear to Alexander Mac∣donald
of Kingsburgh, and in return for the
long and faithful services done and performed
by him to my deceased father, and to myself
during my minority, when he was one of my
Tutors and Curators; being resolved, now
that the said Alexander Macdonald is advanced
in years, to contribute my endeavours for
making his old age placid and comfortable”—
therefore he grants him an annuity of fifty
pounds sterling.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson went to bed soon. When one
bowl of punch was finished, I rose, and was
near the door, in my way up stairs to bed; but
Corrichatachin said, it was the first time <HI>Col</HI>
had been in his house, and he should have his
bowl;—and would not I join in drinking it?
The heartiness of my honest landlord, and the
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>
desire of doing social honour to our very ob∣liging
conductor, induced me to sit down again.
<HI>Col's</HI> bowl was finished; and by that time we
were well warmed. A third bowl was soon
made, and that too was finished. We were
cordial, and merry to a high degree; but of
what passed I have no recollection, with any
accuracy. I remember calling <HI>Corrichatachin</HI>
by the familiar appellation of <HI>Corri,</HI> which his
friends do. A fourth bowl was made, by
which time <HI>Col,</HI> and young M'Kinnon, Corri∣chatachin's
son, slipped away to bed. I con∣tinued
a little with <HI>Corri</HI> and <HI>Knockow;</HI> but at
last I left them. It was near five in the morn∣ing
when I got to bed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>26th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I awaked at noon, with a severe head-ach.
I was much vexed that I should have been
guilty of such a riot, and afraid of a reproof
from Dr. Johnson. I thought it very in∣consistent
with that conduct which I ought to
maintain, while the companion of the <HI>Rambler.</HI>
About one he came into my room, and ac∣costed
me, “What, drunk yet!”—His tone
of voice was not that of severe upbraiding; so
I was relieved a little.—“Sir, said I, they
kept me up.”—He answered, “No, you kept
them up, you drunken dog.”—This he said
with good-humoured <HI>English</HI> pleasantry. Soon
<PB N="318" REF="324"/>
afterwards, Corrichatachin, Col, and other
friends, assembled round my bed. <HI>Corri</HI> had a
brandy-bottle and glass with him, and insisted
I should take a dram.—“Aye, said Dr. John∣son,
fill him drunk again. Do it in the morn∣ing
that we may laugh at him all day. It is a
poor thing for a fellow to get drunk at night,
and sculk to bed, and let his friends have no
sport.”—Finding him thus jocular, I became
quite easy; and when I offered to get up, he
very good-naturedly said, “You need be in
no such hurry now.”—I took my host's advice,
and drank some brandy, which I found an
effectual cure for my head-ach. When I rose,
I went into Dr. Johnson's room, and taking up
Mrs. M'Kinnon's Prayer-book, I opened it at
the twentieth Sunday after Trinity, in the
epistle for which I read, “And be not drunk
with wine, wherein there is excess.” Some
would have taken this as a divine interposition.</P>
<P>Mrs. M'Kinnon told us at dinner, that old
Kingsburgh, her father, was examined at Mug∣stot,
by General Campbell, as to the particu∣lars
of the dress of the person who had come to
his house in woman's clothes, along with Miss
Flora M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald; as by this time the General
had intelligence of that disguise. The parti∣culars
were taken down in writing, that it
might be seen how far they agreed with the
dress of the <HI>Irish girl</HI> who went with Miss
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>
Flora from the Long Island. Kingsburgh,
she said, had but one song, which he always
sung when he was merry over a glass. She
dictated the words to me, which are foolish
enough:</P>
<LG>
<L>Green sleeves and pudding pies,</L>
<L>Tell me where my mistress lies,</L>
<L>And I'll be with her before she rise,</L>
<L>Fiddle and aw' together.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May our affairs abroad succeed,</L>
<L>And may our king come home with speed,</L>
<L>And all pretenders shake for dread,</L>
<L>And let <HI>his</HI> health go round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To all our injured friends in need,</L>
<L>This side, and beyond the Tweed!—</L>
<L>Let all pretenders shake for dread,</L>
<L>And let <HI>his</HI> health go round.</L>
<L>Green sleeves, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>While the examination was going on, this
Talisker, who was there as one of M'Leod's
militia, could not resist the pleasantry of asking
Kingsburgh in allusion to his only song, “Had
she <HI>green sleeves?</HI>” Kingsburgh gave him no
answer. Lady Margaret M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald was very
angry at Talisker for joking on such a serious
occasion, as Kingsburgh was really in danger
of his life.—Mrs. M'Kinnon added that Lady
Margaret was quite adored in Sky. That when
she rode through the island, the people ran in
crowds before her, and took the stones off the
road, lest her horse should stumble and she be
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>
hurt. Her husband, Sir Alexander, is also re∣membered
with great regard. We were told
that every week a hogshead of claret was drunk
at his table.</P>
<P>This was another day of wind and rain; but
good cheer and good society helped to beguile
the time. I felt myself comfortable enough in
the afternoon. I then thought that my last
night's riot was no more than such a social ex∣cess
as may happen without much moral blame;
and recollected that some physicians main∣tained,
that a fever produced by it was, upon
the whole, good for health: so different are
our reflections on the same subject, at different
periods; and such the excuses with which we
palliate what we know to be wrong.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>27th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Donald M'Leod, our original guide,
who had parted from us at Dunvegan, joined
us again to-day. The weather was still so bad
that we could not travel. I found a closet
here, with a good many books, beside those
that were lying about. Dr. Johnson told me,
he found a library in his room at Talisker; and
observed, that it was one of the remarkable
things of Sky, that there were so many books
in it.</P>
<P>Though we had here great abundance of
provisions, it is remarkable that Corrichatichin
has literally no garden: not even a turnip, a
<PB N="321" REF="327"/>
carrot or a cabbage.—After dinner, we talked
of the crooked spade used in Sky, already de∣scribed,
and they maintained that it was better
than the usual garden-spade, and that there was
an art in tossing it, by which those who were
accustomed to it could work very easily with it.
—“Nay, said Dr. Johnson, it may be useful in
land where there are many stones to raise; but
it certainly is not a good instrument for dig∣ging
good land. A man may toss it, to be
sure; but he will toss a light spade much better:
its weight makes it an incumbrance. A man
<HI>may</HI> dig any land with it; but he has no occa∣sion
for such a weight in digging good land.
You may take a field-piece to shoot sparrows;
but all the sparrows you can bring home will
not be worth the charge.”—He was quite so∣cial
and easy amongst them; and, though he
drank no fermented liquor, toasted Highland
beauties with great readiness. His conviviality
engaged them so much, that they seemed eager
to shew their attention to him, and vied with
each other in crying out, with a strong Celtick
pronunciation, “Toctor Shonson, Toctor
Shonson, your health!”</P>
<P>This evening one of our married ladies, a
lively pretty little woman, good-humouredly
sat down upon Dr. Johnson's knee, and, being
encouraged by some of the company, put her
hands round his neck, and kissed him.—“Do
<PB N="322" REF="328"/>
it again, said he; and let us see who will tire
first.”—He kept her on his knee some time,
while he and she drank tea. He was now like a
<HI>buck</HI> indeed. All the company were much en∣tertained
to find him so easy and pleasant. To
me it was highly comick, to see the grave
philosopher,—the Rambler,—toying with a
Highland beauty!—But what could he do? He
must have been surly, and weak too, had he not
behaved as he did. He would have been
laughed at, and not more respected, though
less loved.</P>
<P>He read to-night, to himself, as he sat in
company, a great deal of my Journal, and said
to me, “The more I read of this, I think the
more highly of you.”—The gentlemen sat a
long time at their punch, after he and I had
retired to our chambers. The manner in which
they were attended struck me as singular:—
The bell being broken, a smart lad lay on a
table in the corner of the room, ready to spring
up and bring the kettle, whenever it was
wanted. They continued drinking, and sing∣ing
Erse songs, till near five in the morning,
when they all came into my room, where some
of them had beds. Unluckily for me, they
found a bottle of punch in a corner, which they
drank; and Corrichatachin went for another,
which they also drank. They made many apolo∣gies
for disturbing me. I told them, that, having
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
been kept awake by their mirth, I had once
thoughts of getting up, and joining them again.
Honest Corrichatachin said, “To have had
you done so, I would have given a cow.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>28th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The weather was worse than yesterday. I
felt as if imprisoned. Dr. Johnson said, it was
irksome to be detained thus: yet he seemed to
have less uneasiness, or more patience, than I
had. What made our situation worse here
was, that we had no rooms that we could
command; for the good people had no notion
that a man could have any occasion but for a
mere sleeping-place; so, during the day, the
bed-rooms were common to all the house.
Servants eat in Dr. Johnson's; and mine was a
kind of general rendezvous of all under the
roof, children and dogs not excepted. As the
gentlemen occupied the parlour, the ladies had
no place to sit in, during the day, but Dr. John∣son's
room. I had always some quiet time for
writing in it, before he was up; and, by degrees,
I accustomed the ladies to let me sit in it after
breakfast, at my Journal, without minding me.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was this morning for going to
see as many islands as we could; not recollecting
the uncertainty of the season, which might de∣tain
us in one place for many weeks. He said
to me, “I have more the spirit of adventure
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
than you.”—For my part, I was anxious to get
to Mull, from whence we might almost any day
reach the main land.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson mentioned, that the few ancient
Irish gentlemen yet remaining have the highest
pride of family; that Mr. Sandford, a friend of
his, whose mother was Irish, told him, that
O'Hara (who was true Irish, both by father
and mother) and he, and Mr. Ponsonby, son to
the Earl of Besborough, the greatest man of the
three, but of an English family, went to see
one of those ancient Irish, and that he distin∣guished
them thus: “O'Hara, you are wel∣come!
Mr. Sandford, your mother's son, is
welcome! Mr. Ponsonby, you may sit down.”</P>
<P>He talked both of threshing and thatching.
He said, it was very difficult to determine how
to agree with a thatcher. “If you pay him by
the day's wages, he will thresh no more than he
pleases; though, to be sure, the negligence of
a thresher is more easily detected than that of
most labourers, because he must always make a
sound while he works. If you pay him by the
piece, by the quantity of grain which he pro∣duces,
he will thresh only while the grain comes
freely, and, though he leaves a good deal in the
ear, it is not worth while to thresh the straw
over again; nor can you fix him to do it suf∣ficiently,
because it is so difficult to prove how
much less a man threshes than he ought to do.”
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
“Here then is a dilemma: but, for my part, I
would engage him by the day; I would rather
trust his idleness than his fraud.” He said, a
roof thatched with Lincolnshire reeds would
last seventy years, as he was informed when in
that county; and that he told this to a great
thatcher in London, who said, he believed it
might be true.—Such are the pains that Dr.
Johnson takes to get the best information on
every subject.</P>
<P>He proceeded: “It is difficult for a farmer
in England to find day-labourers, because the
lowest manufacturers can always get more than
a day-labourer. It is of no consequence how
high the wages of manufacturers are; but it
would be of very bad consequence to raise the
wages of those who procure the immediate ne∣cessaries
of life, for that would raise the price
of provisions. Here then is a problem for po∣liticians.
It is not reasonable that the most
useful body of men should be the worst paid;
yet it does not appear how it can be ordered
otherwise. It were to be wished, that a mode
for its being otherwise were found our. In the
mean time, it is better to give temporary as∣sistance
by charitable contributions to poor la∣bourers,
at times when provisions are high,
than to raise their wages; because, if wages
are once raised, they will never get down
again.”</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="332"/>
Happily the weather cleared up between one
and two o'clock, and we got ready to depart;
but our kind host and hostess would not let us
go without taking a <HI>snatch,</HI> as they called it;
which was in truth a very good dinner. While
the punch went round, Dr. Johnson kept a
close whispering conference with Mrs. M'Kin∣non,
which, however, was loud enough to let
us hear that the subject of it was the particulars
of Prince Charles's escape. The company
were entertained and pleased to observe it.
Upon that subject, there was something con∣genial
between the soul of Dr. Samuel Johnson
and that of an isle of Sky farmer's wife. It is
curious to see people, how far so ever removed
from each other in the general system of their
lives, come close together on a particular point
which is common to each. We were merry
with Corrichatachin, on Dr. Johnson's whis∣pering
with his wife. She, perceiving this,
humourously cried, “I am in love with him.
What is it to live and not to love?” Upon her
saying something, which I did not hear, or
cannot recollect, he seized her hand eagerly,
and kissed it.</P>
<P>As we were going, the Scottish phrase of
“<HI>honest man!</HI>” which is an expression of kindness
and regard, was often and often applied by the
company to Dr. Johnson. I was also treated
with much civility; and I must take some
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
merit from my assiduous attention to him,
and from my contriving that he shall be easy
wherever he goes, that he shall not be asked
twice to eat or drink any thing, (which always
disgusts him,) that he shall be provided with
water at his meals, and many such little things,
which, if not attended to, would fret him. I
also may be allowed to claim some merit in
leading the conversation; I do not mean lead∣ing,
as in an orchestra, by playing the first
fiddle; but leading as one does in examining a
witness,—starting topicks, and making him
pursue them. He appears to me like a great
mill, into which a subject is thrown to be
ground. It requires, indeed, fertile minds to
furnish materials for this mill. I regret when∣ever
I see it unemployed; but sometimes I feel
myself quite barren, and have nothing to
throw in.—I know not if this mill be a good
figure; though Pope makes his mind a mill for
turning verses.</P>
<P>We set out about four. Young Corrichata∣chin
went with us. We had a fine evening,
and arrived in good time at <HI>Ostig,</HI> the residence
of Mr. Martin M'Pherson, minister of Slate.
It is a pretty good house, built by his father,
upon a farm near the church. We were
received here with much kindness by
Mr. and Mrs. M'Pherson, and his sister,
Miss M'Pherson, who pleased Dr. Johnson
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
much, by singing Erse songs, and playing on
the guittar. He afterwards sent her a present
of his <HI>Rasselas.</HI> In his bedchamber was a
press stored with books, Greek, Latin, French
and English, most of which had belonged to
the father of our host, the learned Dr. M'Pher∣son;
who, though his <HI>Dissertations</HI> have been
mentioned in a former page as unsatisfactory,
was a man of distinguished talents. Dr. John∣son
looked at a Latin paraphrase of the song of
Moses, written by him, and published in the
<HI>Scots Magazine</HI> for 1747, and said, “It does
him honour; he has a great deal of Latin, and
good Latin.”—Dr. M'Pherson published also in
the same magazine, June 1739, an original
Latin ode, which he wrote from the isle of
Barra, where he was minister for some years.
It is very poetical, and exhibits a striking proof
how much all things depend upon comparison:
for Barra, it seems, appeared to him so much
worse than Sky, his <HI>natale solum,</HI> that he lan∣guished
for its “blessed mountains,” and
thought himself buried alive amongst barba∣rians
where he was.—My readers will probably
not be displeased to have a specimen of this
ode:
<Q><L>“Hei mihi! quantos patior dolores,</L>
<L>Dum procul specto juga ter beata;</L>
<L>Dum ferae Barrae steriles arenas</L>
<L>Solus oberro.”</L>
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
<L>“Ingemo, indignor, crucior, quod inter</L>
<L>Barbaros Thulen lateam colentes;</L>
<L>Torpeo languens, morior sepultus,</L>
<L>Carcere coeco.”</L></Q></P>
<P>After wishing for wings to fly over to his
dear country, which was in his view, from what
he calls <HI>Thule,</HI> as being the most western isle of
Scotland, except St. Kilda; after describing
the pleasures of society, and the miseries of
solitude, he at last, with becoming propriety,
has recourse to the only sure relief of thinking
men,—<HI>Sursum corda,</HI>—the hope of a better
world, and disposes his mind to resignation:
<Q><L>“Interim fiat, tua, rex, voluntas:</L>
<L>Erigor sursum quoties subit spes</L>
<L>Certa migrandi Solymam supernam,</L>
<L>Numinis aulam.”</L></Q></P>
<P>He concludes in a noble strain of orthodox
piety:
<Q><L>“Vita tum demum vocitada vita est,</L>
<L>Tum licet gratos socios habere,</L>
<L>Seraphim et sanctos TRIADEM verendam</L>
<L>Concelebrantes.”</L></Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>29th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After a very good sleep, I rose more refreshed
than I had been for some nights. We were
now at but a little distance from the shore, and
saw the sea from our windows, which made our
voyage seem nearer. Mr. M'Pherson's man∣ners
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>
and address pleased us much. He ap∣peared
to be a man of such intelligence and
taste as to be sensible of the extraordinary
powers of his illustrious guest. He said to me,
“Dr. Johnson is an honour to mankind; and,
if the expression may be used, is an honour to
religion.”</P>
<P>Col, who had gone yesterday to pay a visit at
Camuscross, joined us this morning at break∣fast.
Some other gentlemen also came to enjoy
the entertainment of Dr. Johnson's conversation.
—The day was windy and rainy, so that we
had just seized a happy interval for our journey
last night. We had good entertainment here,
better accommodation than at Corrichatachin,
and time enough to ourselves. The hours slipped
along imperceptibly. We talked of Shenstone.
Dr. Johnson said, he was a good layer-out of
land, but would not allow him to approach
excellence as a poet. He said, he believed he
had tried to read all his Love Pastorals, but
did not get through them. I repeated the
stanza,
<Q><L>She gazed as I slowly withdrew;</L>
<L>My path I could hardly discrn;</L>
<L>So sweetly she bade me adieu,</L>
<L>I thought that she bade me return.</L></Q>
He said, “that seems to be pretty.” I ob∣served
that Shenstone, from his short maxims
in prose, appeared to have some power of
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
thinking; but Dr. Johnson would not allow
him that merit. He agreed, however, with
Shenstone, that it was wrong in the brother of
one of his correspondents to burn his letters;
“for, said he, Shenstone was a man whose cor∣respondence
was an honour.”—He was this af∣ternoon
full of critical severity, and dealt about
his censures on all sides. He said, Hammond's
Love Elegies were poor things. He spoke
contemptuously of our lively and elegant,
though too licentious, Lyrick bard, Hanbury
Williams, and said, “he had no fame, but
from boys who drank with him.”</P>
<P>While he was in this mood, I was unfortu∣nate
enough, simply perhaps, but I could not
help thinking, undeservedly, to come within
“the whiff and wind of his fell sword.” I asked
him, if he had never been accustomed to wear
a night-cap. He said, “No.” I asked, if it
was best not to wear one.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I
had this custom by chance; and perhaps no
man shall ever know whether it is best to sleep
with or without a night-cap.”—Soon after∣wards
he was laughing at some deficiency in
the Highlands, and said, “One might as well
go without shoes and stockings.”—Thinking
to have a little hit at his own deficiency, I
ventured to add,—“or without a night cap,
sir.” But I had better have been silent; for
he retorted directly. “I do not see the
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
connection there (laughing). Nobody before
was ever foolish enough to ask whether it was
best to wear a night-cap or not. This comes
of being a little wrong-headed.”—He carried
the company along with him: and yet the
truth is, that if he had always worn a night-cap,
as is the common practice, and found the
Highlanders did not wear one, he would have
wondered at their barbarity; so that my hit was
fair enough.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>30th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>There was as great a storm of wind and rain
as I have almost ever seen, which necessarily
confined us to the house; but we were fully
compensated by Dr. Johnson's conversation.
He said, he did not grudge Burke's being the
first man in the House of Commons; for he
was the first man every where; but he grudged
that a fellow who makes no figure in company,
and has a mind as narrow as the neck of a vi∣negar
cruet, should make a figure in the House
of Commons, merely by having the knowledge
of a few forms, and being furnished with a
little occasional information<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He did not mention the name of any particular person; but those who are conversant with the political world will probably recollect more persons than one to whom this obser∣vation may be applied.</NOTE>. He told us,
the first time he saw Dr. Young was at the
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
house of Mr. Richardson, the author of <HI>Cla∣rissa.</HI>
He was sent for, that the doctor might
read to him his <HI>Conjectures on Original Composi∣tion,</HI>
which he did, and Dr. Johnson made his
remarks; and he was surprised to find Young
receive as novelties what he thought very com∣mon
maxims. He said he believed Young
was not a great scholar, nor had studied regu∣larly
the art of writing; that there were very
fine things in his <HI>Night Thoughts,</HI> though you
could not find twenty lines together without
some extravagance. He repeated two passages
from his <HI>Love of Fame,</HI>—the characters of
Brunetta and Stella, which he praised highly.
He said Young pressed him much to come to
Wellwyn. He always intended it; but never
went. He was sorry when Young died. The
cause of quarrel between Young and his son,
he told us, was, that his son insisted Young
should turn away a clergyman's widow, who
lived with him, and who, having acquired
great influence over the father, was saucy to
the son. Dr. Johnson said, she could not
conceal her resentment at him, for saying to
Young, that “an old man should not resign
himself to the management of any body.”—I
asked him, if there was any improper con∣nection
between them.—“No, sir, no more
than between two statues.—He was past four∣score,
and she a very coarse woman. She read
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
to him, and, I suppose, made his coffee, and
frothed his chocolate, and did such things as an
old man wishes to have done for him.”</P>
<P>Dr. Dodridge being mentioned, he observed
that “he was authour of one of the finest
epigrams in the English language. It is in
Orton's Life of him. The subject is his fa∣mily-motto,
—<HI>Dum vivimus, vivamus;</HI> which, in
its primary signification, is, to be sure, not
very suitable to a christian divine; but he pa∣raphrased
it thus:”</P>
<Q><L>“Live, while you live, the <HI>epicure</HI> would say,</L>
<L>And seize the pleasures of the present day.</L>
<L>Live, while you live, the sacred <HI>preacher</HI> cries,</L>
<L>And give to GOD each moment as it flies.</L>
<L>Lord, in my views let both united be;</L>
<L>I live in <HI>pleasure,</HI> when I live to <HI>thee.</HI>”</L></Q>
<P>I asked, if it was not strange that government
should permit so many infidel writings to pass
without censure.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, it is mighty
foolish. It is for want of knowing their own
power. The present family on the throne
came to the crown against the will of nine
tenths of the people. Whether these nine
tenths were right or wrong, it is not our busi∣ness
now to inquire. But such being the situa∣tion
of the Royal Family, they were glad to
encourage all who would be their friends.
Now you know every bad man is a Whig;
every man who has loose notions. The church
was all against this family. They, were as I
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
say, glad to encourage any friends; and there∣fore,
since their accession, there is no instance
of any man being kept back on account of his
bad principles; and hence this inundation of
impiety.” I observed that Mr. Hume, some of
whose writings were very unfavourable to reli∣gion,
was however a Tory.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir,
Hume is a Tory by chance, as being a Scotch∣man;
but not upon a principle of duty; for
he has no principle. If he is any thing, he is
a Hobbist.”</P>
<P>There was something not quite serene in his
humour to-night, after supper; for he spoke
of hastening away to London, without stopping
much at Edinburgh. I reminded him, that he
had General Oughton and many others to see.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, I shall neither go in jest,
nor stay in jest. I shall do what is fit.”—<HI>Bos∣well.</HI>
“Aye, sir; but all I desire is, that you
will let me tell you when it is fit.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Sir, I shall not consult you.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “If
you are to run away from us, as soon as you
get loose, we will keep you confined in an
island.”—He was, however, on the whole,
very good company. Mr. Donald M'Leod
expressed very well the gradual impression made
by Dr. Johnson on those who are so fortunate as
to obtain his acquaintance. “When you see
him first, you are struck with aweful reve∣rence;
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
—then you admire him;—and then you
love him cordially.”</P>
<P>I read this evening some part of Voltaire's
History of the War in 1741, and of Lord
Kames against Hereditary Indefeasible Right.
This is a very slight circumstance, with which
I should not trouble my reader, but for the
sake of observing, that every man should keep
minutes of whatever he reads. Every circum∣stance
of his studies should be recorded; what
books he has consulted; how much of them
he has read; at what times; how often the
same authors; and what opinions he formed of
them, at different periods of his life.—Such
an account would much illustrate the history
of his mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>1st October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I shewed to Dr. Johnson verses in a maga∣zine,
on his Dictionary, composed of uncommon
words taken from it:
<Q>“Little of <HI>Anthropopathy</HI> has he,” &amp;c.</Q>
He read a few of them, and said, “I am not
answerable for all the words in my Dictionary.”
—I told him, that Garrick kept a book of all
who had either praised or abused him.—On the
subject of his own reputation, he said, “Now
that I see it has been so current a topick, I wish
I had done so too; but it could not well be
done now, as so many things are scattered in
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>
news-papers.”—He said, he was angry at a
boy of Oxford, who wrote in his defence
against Kenrick; because it was doing him
hurt to answer Kenrick. He was told after∣wards,
the boy was to come to him to ask a
a favour. He first thought to treat him rudely,
on account of his meddling in that business;
but then he considered, he had meant to do
him all the service in his power; and he took
another resolution; he told him he would do
what he could for him, and did so; and the
boy was satisfied. He said, he did not know
how his pamphlet was done, as he had read very
little of it. The boy made a good figure at Ox∣ford,
but died. He remarked, that attacks on
authours did them much service. “A man who
tells me my play is very bad, is less my enemy
than he who lets it die in silence. A man,
whose business it is to be talked of, is much
helped by being attacked.”—Garrick, I ob∣served,
had been often so helped.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Yes, sir; though Garrick had more opportu∣nities
than almost any man, to keep the publick
in mind of him, by exhibiting himself to such
numbers, he would not have had so much repu∣tation,
had he not been so much attacked.
Every attack produces a defence; and so at∣tention
is engaged. There is no sport in mere
praise, when people are all of a mind.”—<HI>Bos∣well.</HI>
“Then Hume is not the worse for
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
Beattie's attack?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “He is, because
Beattie has confuted him. I do not say, but
that the may be some attacks which will
hurt an authour. Though Hume suffered from
Beattie, he was the better for other attacks.”
(He certainly could not include in that number
those of Dr. Adams, and Mr. Tytler.)—<HI>Bos∣well.</HI>
“Goldsmith is the better for attacks.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes,” sir; but he does not think so
yet. When Goldsmith and I published, each
of us something, at the same time, we were
given to understand that we might review each
other. Goldsmith was for accepting the offer.
I said, No; set Reviewers at defiance.—It
was said to old Bentley, upon the attacks
against him, “Why, they'll write you down.”
“No, sir, he replied; depend upon it, no man
was ever written down but by himself.” He
observed to me afterwards, that the advantages
authours derived from attacks, were chiefly in
subjects of taste, where you cannot confute, as
so much may be said on either side.—He told
me he did not know who was the authour of the
<HI>Adventures of a Guinea,</HI> but that the bookseller
had sent the first volume to him in manuscript,
to have his opinion if it should be printed;
and he thought it should.</P>
<P>The weather being now somewhat better,
Mr. James M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, factor to Sir Alexander
M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald in Slate, insisted that all the com∣pany
<PB N="339" REF="345"/>
at Ostig should go to the house at Armi∣dale,
which Sir Alexander had left, having
gone with his lady to Edinburgh, and be his
guests, till we had an opportunity of sailing to
Mull. We accordingly got there to dinner;
and passed our day very chearfully, being no
less than fourteen in number.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>2d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. Johnson said, “that a Chief and his Lady
should make their house like a court. They
should have a certain number of the gentlemen's
daughters to receive their education in the fa∣mily,
to learn pastry and such things from the
housekeeper, and manners from my lady.
That was the way in the great families in
Wales; at Lady Salisbury's, Mrs. Thrale's
grandmother, and at Lady Philips's. I di∣stinguish
the families by the ladies, as I
speak of what was properly their province.
There were always six young ladies at Sir John
Philips's: when one was married, her place
was filled up. There was a large school-room,
where they learnt needle-work and other
things.”—I observed, that, at some courts in
Germany, there were academies for the pages,
who are the sons of gentlemen, and receive their
education without any expence to their pa∣rents.
Dr. Johnson said, that manners were
best learnt at those courts. “You are admitted
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>
with great facility to the prince's company,
and yet must treat him with great respect. At
a great court, you are at such a distance that
you get no good.”—I said, “Very true: a
man sees the court of Versailles, as if he saw it
on a theatre.”—He said, “The best book that
ever was written upon good-breeding, <HI>Il Cor∣teggiano,</HI>
by Castiglione, grew up at the little
court of Urbino, and you should read it.”—I
am glad always to have his opinion of books. At
Mr. M'Pherson's, he commended <HI>Whitby's Com∣mentary,</HI>
and said, be had heard him called rather
lax; but he did not perceive it. He had looked
at a novel, called <HI>The Man of the World,</HI> at
Rasay, but thought there was nothing in it.
He said to-day, while reading my Journal,
“This will be a great treasure to us some
years hence.”</P>
<P>Talking of a very penurious gentleman of
our acquaintance, he observed, that he ex∣ceeded
<HI>L'Avare</HI> in the play. I concurred
with him, and remarked that he would do
well, if introduced in one of Foote's farces;
that the best way to get it done, would be to
bring Foote to be entertained at his house for a
a week, and then it would be <HI>facit indignatio.</HI>—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I wish he had him. I, who
have eat his bread, will not give him to him.
but I should be glad he came honestly by him.”</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="347"/>
He said, he was angry at Thrale, for sitting
at General Oglethorpe's without speaking.
He censured a man for degrading himself to
a non-entity. I observed, that Goldsmith was
on the other extreme; for he spoke at all ven∣tures.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, said he; Goldsmith,
rather than not speak will talk of what he
knows himself to be ignorant, which can only
end in exposing him”—“I wonder, said I,
if he feels that he exposes himself. If he was
with two taylors”—“Or with two founders,”
said Dr. Johnson, (interrupting me,) he would
fall a talking on the method of making can∣non,
though both of them would soon see that
he did not know what metal a cannon is made
of.”—We were very social and merry in his room
this forenoon. In the evening the company
danced as usual. We performed, with much ac∣tivity,
a dance which, I suppose, the emigration
from Sky has occasioned. They call it <HI>America.</HI>
Each of the couples, after the common <HI>involu∣tions</HI>
and <HI>evolutions,</HI> successively whirls round in
a circle, till all are in motion; and the dance
seems intended to shew how emigration catches,
till a whole neighbourhood is set afloat.—Mrs.
M'Kinnon told me, that last year when a ship
sailed from Portree for America, the people
on shore were almost distracted when they saw
their relations go off; they lay down on the
ground, tumbled, and tore the grass with
<PB N="342" REF="348"/>
their teeth.—This year there was not a tear
shed. The people on shore seemed to think
that they would soon follow. This indiffer∣ence
is a mortal sign for the country.</P>
<P>We danced to-night to the musick of the
bagpipe, which made us beat the ground with
prodigious force. I thought it better to en∣deavour
to conciliate the kindness of the
people of Sky, by joining heartily in their
amusements, than to play the abstract scholar.
I looked on this Tour to the Hebrides as a
copartnership between Dr. Johnson and me.
Each was to do all he could to promote its
success; and I have some reason to flatter myself,
that my gayer exertions were of service to us.
Dr. Johnson's immense fund of knowledge and
wit was a wonderful source of admiration and
delight to them; but they had it only at times;
and they required to have the intervals agree∣ably
filled up, and even little elucidations of
his learned text. I was also fortunate enough
frequently to draw him forth to talk, when he
would otherwise have been silent. The foun∣tain
was at times locked up, till I opened the
spring.—It was curious to hear the Hebridians,
when any dispute happened while he was out
of the room, saying, “Stay till Dr. Johnson
comes: say that to <HI>him!</HI>”</P>
<P>Yesterday Dr. Johnson said, “I cannot but
laugh, to think of myself roving among the”
<PB N="343" REF="349"/>
“Hebrides at sixty. I wonder where I shall rove
at fourscore!”—This evening he disputed the
truth of what is said, as to the people of St.
Kilda catching cold whenever strangers come.
“How can there, said he, be physical effect
without a physical cause?”—He added, laugh∣ing,
“the arrival of a ship full of strangers
would kill them; for if one stranger gives them
one cold, two strangers must give them two
colds; and so in proportion.”—I wondered to
hear him ridicule this, as he had praised
M'Aulay for putting it in his book; saying,
that it was manly in him to tell a fact, how∣ever
strange, if he himself believed it. He
said, the evidence was not adequate to the im∣probability
of the thing; that if a physician,
rather disposed to be incredulous, should go to
St. Kilda, and report the fact, then he would
begin to look about him. They said, it was
annually proved by M'Leod's steward, on
whose arrival all the inhabitants caught cold.
He jocularly remarked, “the steward always
comes to demand something from them; and
so they fall a coughing. I suppose the people
in Sky all take a cold, when—(naming a
certain person) comes.”—They said, he came
only in summer.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “That is out of ten∣derness
to you. Bad weather and he, at the
same time, would be too much.”</P>

<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>3d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Joseph reported that the wind was still
against us. Dr. Johnson said, “A wind, or
not a wind? that is the question;” for he can
amuse himself at times with a little play of
words, or rather of sentences. I remember
when he turned his cup at Aberbrothick, where
we drank tea, he muttered, <HI>Claudite jam rivos,
pueri.</HI> I must again and again apologize to
fastidious readers, for recording such minute
particulars. They prove the scrupulous fidelity
of my Journal. Dr. Johnson said it was a very
exact picture of a portion of his life.</P>
<P>While we were chatting in the indolent stile
of men who were to stay here all this day at
least, we were suddenly roused by being told
that the wind was fair, that a little fleet of
herring busses was passing by for Mull, and
that Mr. Simpson's vessel was about to sail,
Hugh M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, the skipper, came to us, and
was impatient that we should get ready, which
we soon did. Dr. Johnson, with composure
and solemnity, repeated the observation of
Epictetus, that, “as man has the voyage of
death before him,—whatever may be his em∣ployment,
he should be ready at the master's
call; and an old man should never be far from
the shore, lest he should not be able to get
himself ready.” He rode, and I and the other
<PB N="345" REF="351"/>
gentlemen walked, about an English mile to
the shore, where the vessel lay. Dr. Johnson
said, he should never forget Sky, and returned
thanks for all civilities. We were carried to
the vessel in a small boat which she had, and
we set sail very briskly about one o'clock. I
was much pleased with the motion for many
hours. Dr. Johnson grew sick, and retired
under cover, as it rained a good deal. I kept
above, that I might have fresh air, and finding
myself not affected by the motion of the vessel,
I exulted in being a stout seaman, while Dr.
Johnson was quite in a state of annihilation.
But I was soon humbled; for after imagining
that I could go with ease to America or the
East-Indies, I became very sick, but kept
above board, though it rained hard.</P>
<P>As we had been detained so long in Sky by
bad weather, we gave up the scheme that Col
had planned for us of visiting several islands,
and contented ourselves with the prospect of
seeing Mull, and Icolmkill, and Inchkenneth,
which lie near to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Simpson was sanguine in his hopes for
a while, the wind being fair for us. He said
he would land us at Icolmkill that night. But
when the wind failed, it was resolved we should
make for the Sound of Mull, and land in the
harbour of Tobermorie. We kept near the five
herring vessels for some time; but afterwards
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>
four of them got before us, and one little
wherry fell behind us. When we got in full
view of the point of Ardnamurchan, the wind
changed, and was directly against our getting
into the sound. We were then obliged to tack,
and get forward in that tedious manner. As
we advanced, the storm grew greater, and the
sea very rough. Col then began to talk of
making for Egg, or Canna, or his own island.
Our skipper said, he would get us into the
Sound. Having struggled for this a good
while in vain, he said, he would push forward
till we were near the land of Mull, where we
might cast anchor, and lie till the morning;
for although, before this, there had been a good
moon, and I had pretty distinctly seen not only
the land of Mull, but up the Sound, and the
country of Morven as at one end of it, the
night was now grown very dark. Our crew
consisted of one M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, our skipper, and
two sailors, one of whom had but one eye:
Mr. Simpson himself, Col, and Hugh M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald
his servant, all helped. Simpson said, he would
willingly go for Col, if young Col or his ser∣vant
would undertake to pilot us to a harbour;
but, as the island is low land, it was dangerous
to run upon it in the dark. Col and his ser∣vant
appeared a little dubious. The scheme
of running for Canna seemed then to be em∣braced;
but Canna was ten leagues off, all out
<PB N="347" REF="353"/>
of our way; and they were afraid to attempt
the harbour of Egg. All these different plans
were successively in agitation. The old skipper
still tried to make for the land of Mull; but
then it was considered that there was no place
there where we could anchor in safety. Much
time was lost in striving against the storm. At
last it became so rough, and threatened to be
so much worse, that Col and his servant took
more courage, and said they would undertake
to hit one of the harbours in Col.—“Then
let us run for it in GOD'S name,” said the
skipper; and instantly we turned towards it.
The little wherry which had fallen behind us,
had hard work. The master begged that, if
we made for Col, we should put out a light to
him. Accordingly one of the sailors waved a
glowing peat for some time. The various
difficulties that were started, gave me a good
deal of apprehension, from which I was re∣lieved,
when I found we were to run for a har∣bour
before the wind. But my relief was but
of short duration; for I soon heard that our
sails were very bad, and were in danger of
being torn in pieces, in which case we should
be driven upon the rocky shore of Col. It was
very dark indeed, and there was a heavy and in∣cessant
rain. The sparks of the burning peat flew
so much about, that I dreaded the vessel might
take fire. Then, as Col was a sportsman, and
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
had powder on board, I figured that we might
be blown up. Simpson and he both appeared a
little frightened, which made me more so;
and the perpetual talking, or rather shouting,
which was carried on in Erse, alarmed me still
more. A man is always suspicious of what is
saying in an unknown tongue; and if fear be
his passion at the time, he grows more afraid.
Our vessel often lay so much on one side, that
I trembled lest she should be overset; and in∣deed
they told me afterwards, that they had
run her sometimes to within an inch of the
water, so anxious were they to make what haste
they could before the night should be worse. I
now saw what I never saw before, a prodigious
sea, with immense billows coming upon a
vessel, so as that it seemed hardly possible to
escape. There was something grandly horrible
in the sight. I am glad I have seen it once.
Amidst all these terrifying circumstances, I
endeavoured to compose my mind. It was not
easy to do it; for all the stories that I had
heard of the dangerous sailing among the
Hebrides, which is proverbial, came full upon
my recollection. When I thought of those who
were dearest to me, and would suffer severely,
should I be lost, I upbraided myself, as not
having a sufficient cause for putting myself
in such danger. Piety afforded me comfort;
yet I was disturbed by the objections that have
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
been made against a particular providence, and
by the arguments of those who maintain that it
is in vain to hope that the petitions of an indi∣vidual,
or even of congregations, can have any
influence with the Deity; objections which
have been often made, and which Dr. Hawkes∣worth
has lately revived, in his Preface to the
Voyages to the South Seas; but Dr. Ogden's
excellent doctrine on the efficacy of interces∣sion,
prevailed.</P>
<P>It was half an hour after eleven before we
set ourselves in the course for Col. As I saw
them all busy doing something, I asked Col,
with much earnestness, what I could do. He,
with a happy readiness, put into my hand a
rope, which was fixed to the top of one of the
masts, and told me to hold it till he bid me
pull. If I had considered the matter, I might
have seen that this could not be of the least
service; but his object was to keep me out of
the way of those who were busy working the
vessel, and at the same time to divert my fear,
by employing me, and making me think that I
was of use. Thus did I stand firm to my post,
while the wind and rain beat upon me, always
expecting a call to pull my rope.</P>
<P>The man with one eye steered; old M<SUP>c</SUP>Do∣nald,
and Col and his servant, lay upon the
fore-castle, looking sharp out for the harbour.
It was necessary to carry much <HI>cloth,</HI> as they
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>
termed it, that is to say, much sail, in order to
keep the vessel off the shore of Col. This made
violent plunging in a rough sea. At last they
spied the harbour of Lochiern, and Col cried,
“Thank GOD, we are safe!” We run up till
we were opposite to it, and soon afterwards we
got into it, and cast anchor.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson had all this time been quiet and
unconcerned. He had lain down on one of
the beds, and having got free from sickness, was
satisfied. The truth is, he knew nothing all
this while of the danger we were in; but, fear∣less
and unconcerned, might have said, in the
words which he has chosen for the motto to his
<HI>Rambler,</HI>
<Q>Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.</Q>
Once, during the doubtful consultations, he
asked whither we were going; and upon being
told that it was not certain whether to Mull or
Col, he cried, “Col for my money!”—I now
went down, with Col and Mr. Simpson, to visit
him. He was lying in philosophick tranquil∣lity,
with a greyhound of Col's at his back,
keeping him warm. Col is quite the <HI>Juvenis
qui gaudet canibus,</HI> He had, when we left Ta∣lisker,
two greyhounds, two terriers, a pointer,
and a large Newfoundland water-dog. He lost
one of his terriers by the road, but had still
five dogs with him. I was very ill, and very
desirous to get to shore. When I was told
<PB N="351" REF="357"/>
that we could not land that night, as the storm
had now increased, I looked so miserably, as Col
afterwards informed me, that what Shakspeare
has made the Frenchman say of the English
soldiers, when scantily dieted, “<HI>Piteous they
will look, like drowned mice!”</HI> might, I believe,
have been well applied to me. There was in
the harbour, before us, a Campbelltown vessel,
the Betty, Kenneth Morison master, taking in
kelp, and bound for Ireland. We sent our
boat to beg beds for two gentlemen, and that
the master would send his boat, which was
larger than ours. He accordingly did so, and
Col and I were accommodated in his vessel till
the morning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>4th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>About eight o'clock we went in the boat to
Mr. Simpson's vessel, and took in Dr. Johnson.
He was quite well, though he had tasted no∣thing
but a dish of tea since Saturday night.
On our expressing some surprize at this, he
said, that, “when he lodged in the Temple,
and had no regular system of life, he had fasted
for two days at a time, during which he had
gone about visiting, though not at the hours of
dinner or supper; that he had drank tea, but
eat no bread; that this was no intentional fast∣ing,
but happened just in the course of a literary
life.”</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358"/>
There was a little miserable publick-house
close upon the shore, to which we should have
gone, had we landed last night: but this morn∣ing
Col resolved to take us directly to the house
of Captain Lauchlan M'Lean, a descendant of
his family, who had acquired a fortune in the
East-Indies, and taken a farm in Col. We had
about an English mile to go to it. Col and
Joseph, and some others, ran to some little
horses, called here <HI>Shelties,</HI> that were running
wild on a heath, and catched one of them. We
had a saddle with us, which was clapped upon
it, and a straw halter was put on its head. Dr.
Johnson was then mounted, and Joseph very
slowly and gravely led the horse. I said to
Dr. Johnson, “I wish, sir, <HI>the club</HI> saw you in
this attitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This curious exhibition may perhaps remind some of my readers of the ludicrous lines, made during Sir Robert Walpole's administration, on Mr. George (afterwards, Lord) Littleton, though the figures of the two personages must be allowed to be very different:
<Q><L>“But who is this astride the pony;</L>
<L>So long, so lean, so lank, so bony?—</L>
<L>Dat be de great orator, Littletony.”</L></Q></NOTE>”</P>
<P>It was a very heavy rain, and I was we to
the skin. Captain M'Lean had but a poor
temporary house, or rather hut; however, it
was a very good haven to us. There was a
blazing peat-fire, and Mrs. M'Lean, daughter
of the minister of the parish, got us tea. I felt
still the motion of the sea. Dr. Johnson said,
<PB N="353" REF="359"/>
it was not imagination, but a continuation of
motion in the fluids, like that of the sea itself
after the storm is over.</P>
<P>There were some books on the board which
served as a chimney-piece. Dr. Johnson took
up Burnett's <HI>History of his own Times.</HI> He said,
“The first part of it is one of the most enter∣taining
books in the English language; it is
quite dramatick: while he went about every
where, saw every where, and heard every where.
By the first part, I mean so far as it ap∣pears
that Burnet himself was actually en∣gaged
in what he has told; and this may be
easily distinguished.” Captain M'Lean censured
Burnet, for his high praise of Lauderdale in a
dedication, when he shews him in his history to
have been so bad a man.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I do not
myself think that a man should say in a dedica∣tion
what he could not say in a history. How∣ever,
allowance should be made; for there is a
great difference. The known style of a dedi∣cation
is flattery: it professes to flatter. There
is the same difference between what a man says
in a dedication, and what he says in a history,
as between a lawyer's pleading a cause and re∣porting
it.”</P>
<P>The day passed away pleasantly enough.
The wind became fair for Mull in the evening,
and Mr. Simpson resolved to sail next morning:
but, having been thrown into the island of Col,
<PB N="354" REF="360"/>
we were unwilling to leave it unexamined,
especially as we considered that the Campbel∣town
vessel would sail for Mull in a day or
two; and therefore we determined to stay.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>5th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I rose, and wrote my Journal till about nine;
and then went to Dr. Johnson, who sat up in
bed, and talked and laughed. I said, it was
curious to look back ten years, to the time
when we first thought of visiting the Hebrides.
How distant and improbable the scheme then
appeared! Yet here we were actually among
them.—“Sir,” said he, people may come to do
any thing almost, by talking of it. I really
believe, I could talk myself into building a
house upon island Isa, though I should probably
never come back again to see it. I could ea∣sily
persuade Reynolds to do it; and there
would be no great sin in persuading him to do
it. Sir, he would reason thus: “What will it
cost me to be there once in two or three sum∣mers?
—Why, perhaps, five hundred pounds;
and what is that, in comparison of having a
fine retreat, to which a man can go, or to
which he can send a friend?” He would never
find out that he may have this within twenty
miles of London.—Then I would tell him,
that he may marry one of the Miss M'Leods,
a lady of great family.—Sir, it is surprising
<PB N="355" REF="361"/>
how people will go to a distance for what they
may have at home. I knew a lady who came
up from Lincolnshire to Knightsbridge with
one of her daughters, and gave five guineas a
week for a lodging and a warm bath; that is,
mere warm water. <HI>That,</HI> you know, could not
be had in <HI>Lincolnshire!</HI> She said, it was made
either too hot or too cold there.”</P>
<P>After breakfast, Dr. Johnson and I, and Jo∣seph,
mounted horses, and Col and the captain
walked with us about a short mile across the
island. We paid a visit to the Reverend Mr.
Hector M'Lean. His parish consists of the
islands of Col and Tyr-yi. He was about se∣venty-seven
years of age, a decent ecclesiastick,
dressed in a full suit of black, and a black wig.
He appeared like a Dutch pastor, or one of the
assembly of divines at Westminster. Dr. John∣son
observed to me afterwards, that he was a
fine old man, and was as well-dressed, and had
as much dignity in his appearance as the dean
of a cathedral. We were told, that he had a
valuable library, though but poor accommo∣dation
for it, being obliged to keep his books
in large chests. It was curious to see him and
Dr. Johnson together. Neither of them heard
very distinctly; so each of them talked in his
own way, and at the same time. Mr. M'Lean
said, he had a Confutation of Bayle, by Leib∣nitz.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “A confutation of Bayle, sir!
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
What part of Bayle do you mean? The great∣est
part of his writings is not confutable: it is
historical and critical.”—Mr. M'Lean said,
“the irreligious part;”and proceeded to talk
of Leibnitz's controversy with Clarke, calling
Leibnitz a great man.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>“Why, sir,
Leibnitz persisted in affirming that Newton
called space <HI>sensorium numinis,</HI> notwithstanding
he was corrected, and desired to observe that
Newton's words were QUASI <HI>sensorium numinis.</HI>
No, sir; Leibnitz was as paltry a fellow as I
know. Out of respect to Queen Caroline, who
patronised him, Clarke treated him too well.”</P>
<P>During the time that Dr. Johnson was thus
going on, the old minister was standing with his
back to the fire, cresting up erect, pulling down
the front of his perriwig, and talking what a
great man Leibnitz was. To give an idea of
the scene, would require a page with two co∣lumns;
but it ought rather to be represented
by two good players. The old gentleman said,
Clarke was very wicked, for going so much
into the Arian system. “I will not say he was
wicked, said Dr. Johnson; he might be mis∣taken.”
—<HI>M'Lean.</HI> “He was wicked, to shut
his eyes against the Scriptures; and worthy
men in England have since confuted him to all
intents and purposes.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I know not
<HI>who</HI> has confuted him to <HI>all intents and purposes.</HI>”
—Here again there was a double talking, each
<PB N="357" REF="363"/>
continuing to maintain his own argument,
without hearing exactly what the other said.</P>
<P>I regretted that Dr. Johnson did not prac∣tice
the art of accommodating himself to dif∣ferent
sorts of people. Had he been softer
with this venerable old man, we might have
had more conversation; but his forcible spirit,
and impetuosity of manner, may be said to
spare neither sex nor age. I have seen even
Mrs. Thrale stunned; but I have often main∣tained,
that it is better he should retain his
own manner. Pliability of address I conceive
to be inconsistent with that majestick power of
mind which he possesses, and which produces
such noble effects. A lofty oak will not bend
like a supple willow.</P>
<P>He told me afterwards, he liked firmness in
an old man, and was pleased to see Mr. M'Lean
so orthodox. “At his age, it is too late for a
man to be asking himself questions as to his
belief.”</P>
<P>We rode to the northern part of the island,
where we saw the ruins of a church or chapel.
We then proceeded to a place called Grissipol,
or the rough Pool.</P>
<P>At Grissipol we found a good farm-house,
belonging to the Laird of Col, and possessed
by Mr. M'Sweyn. On the beach here there is
a singular variety of curious stones. I picked
up one very like a small cucumber. By the
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>
bye, Dr. Johnson told me, that Gay's line in
the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> “As men should serve a
cucumber, &amp;c.” has no waggish meaning, with
reference to men flinging away cucumbers as
too <HI>cooling,</HI> which some have thought; for it has
been a common saying of physicians in Eng∣land,
that a cucumber should be well sliced,
and dressed with pepper and vinegar, and then
thrown out, as good for nothing.—Mr.
M'Sweyn's predecessors had been in Sky from
a very remote period, upon the estate belong∣ing
to M'Leod; probably before M'Leod
had it. The name is certainly Norwegian,
from <HI>Sueno,</HI> King of Norway. This Mr.
M'Sweyn left Sky upon the late M'Leod's
raising his rents. He then got this farm from
Col.</P>
<P>He appeared to be near fourscore; but
looked as fresh, and was as strong, as a man
of fifty. His son Hugh looked older; and, as
Dr. Johnson observed, had more the manners
of an old man than he. I had often heard of
such instances, but never saw one before.
Mrs. M'Sweyn was a decent old gentlewoman.
She was dressed in tartan, and could speak no∣thing
but Erse. She said, she had taught Sir
James M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald Erse, and would teach me
soon. I could now sing a verse of the song,
<HI>Hatyin foam'eri,</HI> made in honour of Allan, the
famous Captain of Clanranald, who fell at
<PB N="359" REF="365"/>
Sherrif-muir, and of whom his servant, who
lay on the field watching his dead body, being
asked next day who that was, answered, “He
was a man yesterday.”</P>
<P>We were entertained here with a primitive
heartiness. Whisky was served round in a
shell, according to the ancient Highland cus∣tom.
Dr. Johnson would not partake of it;
but, being desirous to do honour to the modes
“of other times,” drank some water out of the
shell.</P>
<P>In the forenoon Dr. Johnson said, “it would
require great resignation to live in one of these
islands.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “I don't know, sir; I have
felt myself at times, in a state of almost mere
physical existence, satisfied to eat, drink and
sleep, and walk about, and enjoy my own
thoughts; and I can figure a continuation of
this.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>“Aye, sir; but if you were
shut up here, your own thoughts would tor∣ment
you: you would think of Edinburgh or
London, and that you could not be there.”</P>
<P>We set out after dinner for <HI>Breacacha,</HI> the
family seat of the Laird of Col, accompanied
by the young laird, who had now got a horse,
and by the younger Mr. M'Sweyn, whose wife
had gone thither before us, to prepare every
thing for our reception, the laird and his
family being absent at Aberdeen. It is called
<HI>Breacacha,</HI> or the Spotted Field; because in
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
summer it is enamelled with clover and daisies,
as young Col told me. We passed by a place
where there is a very large stone, I may call it
a <HI>rock;</HI>—“a vast weight for Ajax.” The
tradition is, that a giant threw such another
stone at his mistress up to the top of a hill at a
small distance; and that she, in return, threw
this mass down to him. It was all in sport.</P>
<Q>Malo me petit lasciva puella.</Q>
<P>As we advanced, we came to a large extent
of plain ground. I had not seen such a place
for a long time. Col and I took a gallop upon
it by way of race. It was very refreshing to
me, after having been so long taking short
steps in hilly countries. It was like stretching
a man's legs after being cramped in a short
bed. We also passed close by a large extent
of sand hills, near two miles square. Dr.
Johnson said, “he never had the image before.
It was horrible, if barrenness and danger could
be so.” I heard him, after we were in the
house of <HI>Breacacha,</HI> repeating to himself, as he
walked about the room,
<Q><L>“And, smother'd in the dusty whirlwind, dies.”</L></Q>
Probably he had been thinking of the whole
of the simile in <HI>Cato,</HI> of which that is the con∣cluding
line: the sandy desart had struck him
so strongly. The sand has of late been blown
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>
over a good deal of meadow; and the people
of the island say, that their fathers remembered
much of the space which is now covered with
sand, to have been under tillage. Col's house
is situated on a bay called <HI>Breacacha</HI> Bay. We
found here a neat new-built gentleman's house,
better than any we had been in since we were
at Lord Errol's. Dr. Johnson relished it much
at first, but soon remarked to me, that “there
was nothing becoming a Chief about it: it was
a mere tradesman's box.” He seemed quite at
home, and no longer found any difficulty in
using the Highland address; for as soon as we
arrived, he said, with a spirited familiarity,
“Now <HI>Col,</HI> if you could get us a dish of tea.”
—Dr. Johnson and I had each an excellent
bed-room. We had a dispute which of us had
the best curtains. His were rather the best,
being of linen; but I insisted that my bed had
the best posts, which was undeniable. “Well,
said he; if you <HI>have</HI> the best <HI>posts,</HI> we will have
you tied to them, and whipped.”—I mention
this slight circumstance, only to shew how
ready he is, even in mere trifles, to get the
better of his antagonist, by placing him in a
ludicrous view. I have known him sometimes
use the same art, when hard pressed, in serious
disputation. Goldsmith, I remember, to reta∣liate
for many a severe defeat which he has
suffered from him, applied to him a lively say∣ing
<PB N="362" REF="368"/>
in one of Cibber's comedies, which puts
this part of his character in a strong light.—
“There is no arguing with Johnson; for, <HI>if
his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the
but-end of it.</HI>”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>6th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After a suffiency of sleep, we assembled at
breakfast. We were just as if in barracks.
Every body was master. We went and viewed
the old castle of Col, which is not far from the
present house, near the shore, and founded
on a rock. It has never been a large feudal
residence, and has nothing about it that
requires a particular description. Like other
old inconvenient buildings of the same age, it
exemplified Gray's picturesque lines,
<Q><L>“Huge windows that exclude the light,</L>
<L>And passages that lead to nothing.”</L></Q></P>
<P>It may however be worth mentioning, that
on the second story we saw a vault, which was,
and still is, the family prison. There was a
woman put into it by the laird, for theft,
within these ten years; and any offender would
be confined there yet; for, from the necessity
of the thing, as the island is remote from any
power established by law, the laird must exer∣cise
his jurisdiction to a certain degree.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="369"/>
We were shewn, in a corner of this vault, a
hole, into which Col said greater criminals used
to be put. It was now filled up with rubbish
of different kinds. He said, it was of a great
depth. “Aye, (said Dr. Johnson, smiling,)
all such places, that <HI>are filled up,</HI> were of a great
depth.” He is very quick in shewing that he
does not give credit to careless or exaggerated
accounts of things. After seeing the castle,
we looked at a small hut near it. It is called
<HI>Teigh Franchich, i. e.</HI> the Frenchman's House.
Col could not tell us the history of it. A poor
man with a wife and children now lived in it.
We went into it, and Dr. Johnson gave them
some charity. There was but one bed for all
the family, and the hut was very smoky.
When he came out, he said to me, “<HI>Et hoc
secundum sententiam philosophorum est esse beatus.</HI>”
—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “The philosophers, when they
placed happiness in a cottage, supposed clean∣liness,
and no smoke.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, they
did not think about either.”</P>
<P>We walked a little in the laird's garden, in
which endeavours have been used to rear some
trees; but, as soon as they got above the sur∣rounding
wall, they died. Dr. Johnson re∣commended
sowing the seeds of hardy trees,
instead of planting.</P>
<P>Col and I rode out this morning, and viewed
a part of the island. In the course of our ride,
<PB N="364" REF="370"/>
we saw a turnip-field, which he had hoed with
his own hands. He first introduced this kind
of husbandry into the Western islands. We
also looked at an appearance of lead, which
seemed very promising. It has been long
known; for I found letters to the late laird
from Sir John Areskine and Sir Alexander
Murray, respecting it.</P>
<P>After dinner, came Mr. M'Lean, of Cor∣neck,
brother to Isle of Muck, who is a cadet
of the family of Col. He possesses the two
ends of Col which belong to the Duke of
Argyll. Corneck had lately taken a lease of
them at a very advanced rent, rather than let
the Campbells get a footing in the island, one
of whom had offered nearly as much as he. Dr.
Johnson well observed, that “landlords err much
when they calculate merely what their land
<HI>may</HI> yield. The rent must be in a propor∣tionate
ratio of what the land may yield, and
of the power of the tenant to make it yield.
A tenant cannot make by his land, but accord∣ing
to the corn and cattle which he has. Sup∣pose
you should give him twice as much land
as he has, it does him no good, unless he gets
also more stock. It is clear then, that the
Highland landlords, who let their substantial
tenants leave them, are infatuated; for the
poor small tenants cannot give them good
rents, from the very nature of things. They
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>
“have not the means of raising more from their
farms.” Corneck, Dr. Johnson said, was the
most distinct man that he had met with in these
isles; he did not shut his eyes, or put his fingers
in his ears, which he seemed to think was a
good deal the mode with most of the people
whom we have seen of late.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>7th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Captain M'Lean joined us this morning at
breakfast. There came on a dreadful storm of
wind and rain, which continued all day, and
rather increased at night. The wind was di∣rectly
against our getting to Mull. We were
in a strange state of abstraction from the world:
we could neither hear from our friends, nor
write to them. Col had brought Daille <HI>on the
Fathers,</HI> Lucas <HI>on Happiness,</HI> and More's <HI>Dia∣logues,</HI>
from the Reverend Mr. M'Lean's, and
Burnet's <HI>History of his own Times</HI> from Captain
M'Lean's; and he had of his own some books
of farming, and Gregory's <HI>Geometry.</HI> Dr.
Johnson read a good deal of Burnet, and of
Gregory, and I observed he made some geome∣trical
notes in the end of his pocket-book. I read
a little of Young's Six Weeks Tour through the
Southern Counties; and Ovid's Epistles, which
I had bought at Inverness, and which helped to
solace many a weary hour.</P>
<P>We were to have gone with Dr. Johnson this
morning to see the mine; but were prevented
<PB N="366" REF="372"/>
by the storm. While it was raging, he said,
“We may be glad we are not <HI>damnati ad me∣talla.</HI>”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>8th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. Johnson appeared to-day very weary of
our present confined situation. He said, “I
want to be on the main land, and go on with
existence. This is a waste of life.”</P>
<P>I shall here insert, without regard to chro∣nology,
some of his conversation at different
times.</P>
<P>“There was a man some time ago, who was
well received for two years,” among the gen∣tlemen
of Northamptonshire, by calling him∣self
my brother. At last he grew so impudent
as by his influence to get tenants turned out of
their farms. Allen the Printer, who is of that
county, came to me, asking, with much
appearance of doubtfulness, if I had a brother;
and upon being assured I had none alive, he
told me of the imposition, and immediately
wrote to the country, and the fellow was dis∣missed.
It pleased me to hear that so much
was got by using my name. It is not every
name that can carry double; do both for a
man's self and his brother (laughing.) I should
be glad to see the fellow. However, I could
have done nothing against him. A man can
have no redress for his name being used, or
<PB N="367" REF="373"/>
ridiculous stories being told of him in the
news-papers, except he can shew that he has
suffered damage.—Some years ago a foolish
piece were published, said to be written “<HI>by
S. Johnson.</HI>” Some of my friends wanted me
to be very angry about this. I said, it would
be in vain; for the answer would be, “<HI>S. Johnson</HI>
may be Simon Johnson, or Simeon, Johnson,
or Solomon Johnson;” and even if the full
name, Samuel Johnson, had been used, it
might be said, “It is not you; it is a much
cleverer fellow.”</P>
<P>“Beauclerk and I, and Langton, and Lady
Sydney Beauclerk, mother to our friend, were
one day driving in a coach by Cuper's Gardens,
which were then unoccupied. I, in sport,
proposed that Beauclerk and Langton, and my∣self,
should take them; and we amused our∣selves
with scheming how we should all do our
parts. Lady Sydney grew angry, and said,
“an old man should not put such things in
young people's heads.” She had no notion of
a joke, sir; had come late into life, and had a
mighty unpliable understanding.”</P>
<P>“Carte's <HI>Life of the Duke of Ormond</HI> is consi∣dered
as a book of authority; but it is ill-written.
The matter is diffused in too many
words; there is no animation, no compression,
no vigour. Two good volumes in duodecimo
might be made out of the two in folio.”</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="374"/>
Talking of our confinement here, I observed,
that our discontent and impatience could not
be considered as very unreasonable; for that
we were just in the state of which Seneca com∣plains
so grievously, while in exile in Corsica.
“Yes, said Dr. Johnson, and he was not farther
from home than we are.” The truth is, he was
much nearer.</P>
<P>There was a good deal of rain to-day, and
the wind was still contrary. Corneck attended
me, while I amused myself in examining a col∣lection
of papers belonging to the family of
Col. The first laird was a younger son of the
Chieftain M'Lean, and got the middle part of
Col for his patrimony. Dr. Johnson having
given a very particular account of the con∣nection
between this family and a branch of
the family of Camerons, called M'Lonich, I
shall only insert the following document,
(which I found in Col's cabinet,) as a proof of
its continuance, even to a late period:
<LETTER>

<OPENER><SALUTE>“Dear Sir,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“THE long-standing tract of firm
affectionate friendship 'twixt your worthy pre∣decessors

that we may have full relyance on your favour
and undoubted friendship, in recommending
the bearer, Ewen Cameron, our cousin, son to
the deceast Dugall M'Connill of Innermaillie,
sometimes in Glenpean, to your favour and con∣duct,
<PB N="369" REF="375"/>
who is a man of undoubted honesty
and discretion, only that he has the misfortune
of being alledged to have been accessory to the
killing of one of M'Martin's family about
fourteen years ago, upon which alledgeance
the M'Martin's are now so sanguine on re∣venging,
that they are fully resolved for the
deprivation of his life; to the preventing of
which you are relyed on by us, as, the only fit
instrument, and a most capable person. There∣fore
your favour and protection is expected
and intreated, during his good behaviour;
and failing of which behaviour, you'll please to
use him as a most insignificant person deserves.</P>

that he is not secure enough to stay

</LETTER></P>
<P>I found some uncouth lines on the death of
the present laird's father, intituled “Nature's
Elegy upon the Death of Donald Maclean of
Col.” They are not worth insertion. I shall
only give what is called his Epitaph, which
Dr. Johnson said, “was not so very bad.”</P>
<Q><L>“Nature's minion, Virtue's wonder,</L>
<L>Art's corrective, here lyes under.”</L></Q>
<P>I asked, what “Art's corrective” meant.
“Why, sir, said he, that the laird was so exqui∣site,
that he set Art right, when she was wrong.”</P>
<P>I found several letters to the late Col, from
my father's old companion at Paris, Sir Hector
M'Lean, one of which was written at the time
of settling the colony in Georgia. It dissuades
Col from letting people go there, and assures
him there will soon be an opportunity of em∣ploying
them better at home. Hence it ap∣pears
<PB N="372" REF="378"/>
that emigration from the Highlands,
though not in such numbers at a time as of
late, has always been practised. Dr. Johnson
observed, that, “instead of improving their
country, they diminished their people.”</P>
<P>There are several districts of sandy desart in
Col. There are forty-eight lochs of fresh
water; but many of them are very small,—
mere pools. About one half of them, how∣ever,
have trout and eel. There is a great
number of horses in the island, mostly of a small
size. Being over-stocked, they sell some in
Tir-yi, and on the main land. Their black
cattle, which are chiefly rough-harired, are
reckoned remarkably good. The climate
being very mild in winter, they never put
their beasts in any house. The lakes are
never frozen so as to bear a man; and snow
never lies above a few hours. They have a
good many sheep, which they eat mostly them∣selves,
and sell but a few. They have goats in
several places. There are no foxes; no serpents,
toads, or frogs, nor any venomous creature.
They have otters and mice here; but had no
rats, till lately that an American vessel
brought them. There is a rabbit-warren on
the north east of the island, belonging to the
Duke of Argyll. Young Col intends to get
some hares, of which there are none at present.
There are no black-cock, muir-fowl, nor par∣tridges;
<PB N="373" REF="379"/>
but there are snipe, wild-duck, wild∣geese,
and swans, in winter; wild pigeons, plo∣ver,
and great numbers of starlings; of which I
shot some, and found them pretty good eating.
Woodcocks come hither, though there is not a
tree upon the island. There are no rivers in
Col; but only some brooks, in which there is a
great variety of fish. In the whole isle there are
but three hills, and none of them considerable,
for a Highland country. The people are very
industrious. Every man can tan. They get oak,
and birch-bark, and lime, from the main land.
Some have pits; but they commonly use tubs.
I saw brogues very well tanned; and every man
can make them. They all make candles of
the tallow of their beasts, both moulded and
dipped; and they all make oil of the livers of
fish. The little fish called Cuddies produce a
great deal. They sell some oil out of the
island, and they use it much for light in their
houses, in little iron lamps, most of which they
have from England; but of late their own
blacksmith makes them. He is a good work∣man;
but he has no employment in shoeing
horses, for they all go unshod here, except some
of a better kind belonging to young Col,
which were now in Mull. There are two car∣penters
in Col; but most of the inhabitants
can do something as boat-carpenters. They
can all dye. Heath is used for yellow; and
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>
for red, a moss which grows on stones. They
make broad-cloth, and tartan and linen, of
their own wool and flax, sufficient for their
own use; as also stockings. Their bonnets
come from the main land. Hard-ware and
several small articles are brought annually from
Greenock, and sold in the only shop in the
island, which is kept near the house, or rather
hut, used for publick worship, there being no
church in the island.—The inhabitants of Col
have increased considerably within these thirty
years, as appears from the parish registers.
There are but three considerable tacksmen on
Col's part of the island: the rest is let to
small tenants, some of whom pay so low a rent
as four, three, or even two guineas. The
highest is seven pounds, paid by a farmer,
whose son goes yearly on foot to Aberdeen for
education, and in summer returns, and acts as
a school-master in Col. Dr. Johnson said,
“There is something noble in a young man's
walking two hundred miles and back again,
every year, for the sake of learning.”</P>
<P>This day a number of people came to Col,
with complaints of each other's trespasses.
Corneck, to prevent their being troublesome,
told them, that the lawyer from Edinburgh
was here, and, if they did not agree, he would
take them to task. They were alarmed at this;
said they had never been used to go to law,
<PB N="375" REF="381"/>
and hoped Col would settle matters himself.—
In the evening Corneck left us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>9th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>As, in our present confinement, any thing
that had even the name of curious was an ob∣ject
of attention, I proposed that Col should
show me the great stone, mentioned in a for∣mer
page, as having been thrown by a giant
to the top of a mountain. Dr. Johnson, who
did not like to be left alone, said he would
accompany us as far as riding was practicable.
We ascended a part of the hill on horseback,
and Col and I scrambled up the rest. A ser∣vant
held our horses, and Dr. Johnson placed
himself on the ground, with his back against a
large fragment of rock. The wind being high,
he let down the cocks of his hat, and tied it
with his handkerchief under his chin. While
we were employed in examining the stone,
which did not repay our trouble in getting to
it, he amused himself with reading Gataker <HI>on
Lots and on the Christian Watch,</HI> a very learned
book, of the last age, which had been found
in the garret of Col's house, and which he said
was a treasure here. When we descried him
from above, he had a most eremitical appear∣ance;
and on our return told, us, he had been
so much engaged by Gataker, that he had
never missed us. His avidity for a variety of
books, while we were in Col, was frequently
<PB N="376" REF="382"/>
expressed; and he often complained that so few
were within his reach. Upon which I observed
to him, that it was strange he should complain
of want of books, when he could at any time
make such good ones.</P>
<P>We next proceeded to the lead mine. In
our way we came to a strand of some extent,
where we were glad to take a gallop, in which
my learned friend joined with great alacrity.
Dr. Johnson, mounted on a large bay mare
without shoes, and followed by a foal, which
had some difficulty in keeping up with him,
was a singular spectacle.</P>
<P>After examining the mine, we returned
through a very uncouth district, full of sand
hills; down which, though apparent precipices,
our horses carried us with safety, the sand al∣ways
gently sliding away from their feet.
Vestiges of houses were pointed out to us,
which Col, and two others who had joined us,
asserted had been overwhelmed by sand blown
over them. But, on going close to one of
them, Dr. Johnson shewed the absurdity of the
notion, by remarking, that “it was evidently
only a house abandoned, the stones of which
had been taken away for other purposes; for
the large stones, which form the lower part
of the walls, were still standing higher than
the sand. If <HI>they</HI> were not blown over,
it was clear nothing higher than they could be
blown over.” This was quite convincing to
<PB N="377" REF="383"/>
me; but it made not the least impression on
Col and the others, who were not to be argued
out of a Highland tradition.</P>
<P>We did not sit down to dinner till between
six and seven. We lived plentifully here, and
had a true welcome. In such a season, good
firing was of no small importance. The peats
were excellent, and burnt cheerfully. Those
at Dunvegan, which were damp, Dr. Johnson
called “a sullen fuel.”</P>
<P>Blenheim being occasionally mentioned, he
told me he had never seen it: he had not gone
formerly; and he would not go now just as a
common spectator, for his money: he would
not put it in the power of some man about the
Duke of Marlborough to say, “Johnson was
here; I knew him, but I took no notice of
him.” He said, he would be very glad to see
it, if properly invited, which in all probability
would never be the case, as it was not worth
his while to seek for it.—I observed, that he
might be easily introduced there by a common
friend of ours, nearly related to the duke. He
answered, with an uncommon attention to de∣licacy
of feeling, “I doubt whether our friend
be on such a footing with the duke as to carry
any body there; and I would not give him the
uneasiness of seeing that I knew he was not, or
even of being himself reminded of it.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="378" REF="384"/>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>10th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>There was this day the most terrible storm
of wind and rain that I ever remember. It
made such an awful impression on us all, as to
produce, for some time, a kind of dismal quiet∣ness
in the house. The day was passed without
much conversation: only, upon my observing
that there must be something bad in a man's
mind, who does not like to give leases to his
tenants, but wishes to keep them in a perpe∣tual
wretched dependence on his will, Dr.
Johnson said, “You are right: it is a man's
duty to extend comfort and security among as
many people as he can. He should not wish to
have his tenanants mere <HI>Ephemerae,</HI>—mere be∣ings
of an hour.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But, sir, if they
have leases, is there not some danger that they
may grow insolent? I remember you yourself
once told me, an English tenant was so
independent, that, if provoked, he would <HI>throw</HI>
his rent at his landlord.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Depend
upon it,” sir, it is the landlord's own fault, if it
is thrown at him. A man may always keep
his tenants under dependence enough, though
they have leases. He must be a good tenant,
indeed, who will not fall behind in his rent, if
his landlord will let him; and if he does not
fall behind, his landlord has him at his mercy.
Indeed, the poor man is always much at the
<PB N="379" REF="385"/>
“mercy of the rich; no matter whether landlord
or tenant. If the tenant lets his landlord have
a little rent before-hand, or has lent him
money, then the landlord is in his power.
There cannot be a greater man than a tenant
who has lent money to his landlord; for he
has under subjection the very man to whom he
should be subjected.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>11th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We had some days ago engaged the Camp∣belltown
vessel to carry us to Mull, from the
harbour where she lay. The morning was fine,
and the wind fair and moderate; so we hoped
at length to get away.</P>
<P>Mrs. M'Sweyn, who officiated as our land∣lady
here, had never been on the main land.
On hearing this, Dr. Johnson said to me,
before her, “That is rather being behind-hand
with life. I would at least go and see Glenelg.”
—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “You yourself, sir, have never
seen, till now, any thing but your native
island.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “But, sir, by seeing
London, I have seen as much of life as the
world can shew.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “You have not
seen Pekin.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “What is Pekin? Ten
thousand Londoners would <HI>drive</HI> all the people
of Pekin: they would drive them like deer.”</P>
<P>We set out about eleven for the harbour;
but, before we reached it, so violent a storm
<PB N="380" REF="386"/>
came on, that we were obliged again to take
shelter in the house of Captain M'Lean, where
we dined, and passed the night.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>12th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After breakfast, we made a second attempt
to get to the harbour; but another storm soon
convinced us that it would be in vain. Cap∣tain
M'Lean's house being in some confusion,
on account of Mrs. M'Lean's being expected
to lie-in, we resolved to go to Mr. M'Sweyn's,
where we arrived very wet, fatigued, and
hungry. In this situation, we were somewhat
disconcerted by being told that we should
have no dinner till late in the evening; but
should have tea in the mean time. Dr. Johnson
opposed this arrangement; but they persisted,
and he took the tea very readily. He said to
me afterwards, “You must consider, sir, a
dinner here is a matter of great consequence.
It is a thing to be first planned, and then exe∣cuted.
I suppose the mutton was brought
some miles off, from some place where they
knew there was a sheep killed.”</P>
<P>Talking of the good people with whom we
were, he said, “Life has not got at all for∣ward
by a generation in M'Sweyn's family;
for the son is exactly formed upon the father.
What the father says, the son says; and what
the father looks, the son looks.”</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="387"/>
There being little conversation to-night, I
must endeavour to recollect what I may have
ommitted on former occasions.—When I boasted,
at Rasay, of my independency of spirit, and
that I could not be bribed, he said, “Yes, you
may be bribed by flattery.”—At the Reverend
Mr. M'Lean's, Dr. Johnson asked him, if the
people of Col had any superstitions. He said,
“No.” The cutting peats at the increase of
the moon was mentioned as one; but he would
not allow it, saying, it was not a superstition,
but a whim. Dr. Johnson would not admit the
distinction. There were many superstitions, he
maintained, not connected with religion; and
this was one of them.—On Monday we had a
dispute at the Captain's, whether sand-hills
could be fixed down by art. Dr. Johnson said,
“How <HI>the devil</HI> can you do it?” but instantly
corrected himself, “How can you do it?”—I
never before heard him use a phrase of that
nature.</P>
<P>He has particularities which it is impossible
to explain. He never wears a night-cap, as I
have already mentioned; but he puts a hand∣kerchief
on his head in the night.—The day
that we left Talisker, he bade us ride on. He
then turned the head of his horse back towards
Talisker, stopped for some time; then wheeled
round to the same direction with ours, and then
came briskly after us. He sets open a window
in the coldest day or night, and stands before it.
<PB N="382" REF="388"/>
It may do with his constitution; but most
people, amongst whom I am one, would say,
with the frogs in the fable, “This may be
sport to you; but it is death to us.”—It is
in vain to try to find a meaning in every one
of his particularities, which, I suppose, are mere
habits, contracted by chance; of which every
man has some that are more or less remark∣able.
His speaking to himself, or rather re∣peating,
is a common habit with studious men
accustomed to deep thinking; and, in conse∣quence
of their being thus rapt, they will even
laugh by themselves, if the subject which they
are musing on is a merry one. Dr. Johnson
is often uttering pious ejaculations, when he
appears to be talking to himself; for sometimes
his voice grows stronger, and parts of the
Lord's Prayer are heard. I have sat beside
him with more than ordinary reverence on such
occasions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that Dr. Johnson should have read this account of some of his own peculiar habits, without saying any thing on the subject, which I hoped he would have done.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In our Tour, I observed that he was disgusted
whenever he met with coarse manners. He
said to me, “I know not how it is,” but I can∣not
bear low life: and I find others, who have
as good a righ: as I to be fastidious, bear it
better, by having mixed more with different
sorts of men. You would think that I have
mixed pretty well too.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="389"/>
He read this day a good deal of my Journal,
written in a small book with which he had
supplied me, and was pleased, for he said, “I
wish thy books were twice as big.” He helped
me to fill up blanks which I had left in first
writing, it, when I was not quite sure of what
he had said, and he corrected any mistakes that
I had made. “They call me a scholar, said he,
and yet how very little literature is there in my
conversation.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “That, sir, must be
according to your company. You would not
give literature to those who cannot taste it.
Stay till we meet Lord Elibank.”</P>
<P>We had at last a good dinner, or rather
supper, and were very well satisfied with our
entertainment.</P>

<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>13th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Col called me up, with intelligence that it
was a good day for a passage to Mull; and just
as we rose, a sailor from the vessel arrived for
us. We got all ready with dispatch. Dr.
Johnson was displeased at my bustling, and
walking quickly up and down. He said, “It
does not hasten us a bit. It is getting on
horseback in a ship. All boys do it; and you
are longer a boy than others.” He himself has
no alertness, or whatever it may be called; so
he may dislike it, as <HI>Oderunt hilarem tristes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="390"/>
Before we reached the harbour, the wind
grew high again. However, the small boat
was waiting, and took us on board. We re∣mained
for some time in uncertainty what to
do: at last it was determined, that, as a good
part of the day was over, and it was dangerous
to be at sea at night, in such a vessel, and such
weather, we should not sail till the morning
tide, when the wind would probably be more
gentle. We resolved not to go ashore again,
but lie here in readiness. Dr. Johnson and I
had each a bed in the cabbin. Col sat at the
fire in the forecastle, with the captain, and
Joseph, and the rest. I eat some dry oatmeal,
of which I found a barrel in the cabbin. I had
not done this since I was a boy. Dr. Johnson
owned that he too was fond of it when a boy;
a circumstance which I was highly pleased to
hear from him, as it gave me an opportunity
of observing that, notwithstanding his joke on
the article of OATS, he was himself a proof
that this kind of <HI>food</HI> was not peculiar to the
people of Scotland.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>14th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>When Dr. Johnson awaked this morning,
he called, “<HI>Lanky!</HI>” having, I suppose, been
thinking of Langton; but corrected himself
instantly, and cried, “<HI>Bozzy!</HI>” He has a way
of contracting the names of his friends. Gold∣smith
<PB N="385" REF="391"/>
feels himself so important now, as to be
displeased at it. I remember one day, when
Tom Davies was telling that Dr. Johnson said,
“We are all in labour for a name to <HI>Goldy's</HI>
play,” Goldsmith cried, “I have often desired
him not to call me <HI>Goldy.</HI>”</P>
<P>Between six and seven we hauled our anchor,
and set sail with a fair breeze; and, after a
pleasant voyage, we got safely and agreeably
into the harbour of Tobermorie, before the
wind rose, which it always has done, for some
days, about noon.</P>
<P>Tobermorie is an excellent harbour. An island
lies before it, and it is surrounded by a hilly
theatre. The island is too low, otherwise this
would be quite a secure port; but, as the island
is not high enough, some storms blow very
hard here. Not long ago, fifteen vessels
were blown from their moorings. There are
sometimes sixty or seventy sail here: to-day
there were twelve or fourteen vessels. To see
such a fleet was the next thing to seeing a town.
The vessels were from different places; Clyde,
Campbelltown, Newcastle, &amp;c. One was return∣ing
to Lancaster from Hamburgh. After
having been shut up so long in Col, the sight
of such an assemblage of moving habitations,
containing such a variety of people, engaged in
different pursuits, gave me much gaiety of spi∣rit.
When we had landed, Dr. Johnson said,
<PB N="386" REF="392"/>
“Boswell is now all alive. He is like Antaeus;
he gets new vigour whenever he touches the
ground.”—I went to the top of a hill fronting
the harbour, from whence I had a good view
of it. We had here a tolerable inn. Dr. John∣son
had owned to me this morning, that he was
out or humour. Indeed, he shewed it a good
deal in the ship; for when I was expressing my
joy on the prospect of our landing in Mull, he
said, he had no joy, when he recollected that it
would be five days before he should get to the
main land. I was afraid he would now take a
sudden resolution to give up seeing Icolmkill.
A dish of tea, and some good bread and butter,
did him service, and his bad humour went off.
I told him, that I was diverted to hear all the
people whom we had visited in our Tour, say,
“<HI>Honest man!</HI> he's pleased with every thing;
he's always content!”—“Little do they know,”
said I. He laughed, and said, “You rogue!”</P>
<P>We sent to hire horses to carry us across the
island of Mull to the shore opposite to Inch∣kenneth,
the residence of Sir Allan M'Lean,
uncle to young Col, and Chief of the M'Leans,
to whose house we intended to go the next
morning. Our friend Col went to visit his
aunt, the wife of Dr. Alexander M'Lean, a
physician, who lives about a mile from Tober∣morie.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="393"/>
Dr. Johnson and I sat by ourselves at the inn,
and talked a good deal.—I told him, that I
had found, in Leandro Alberti's Description
of Italy, a good deal of what Addison has
given us in his <HI>Remarks.</HI> He said, “The
collection of passages from the Classicks has been
made by another Italian: it is, howeever, im∣possible
to detect a man as a plagiary in such a
case, because all who set about making such
a collection must find the same passages; but
if you find the same application in another
book, then Addison's learning in his <HI>Remarks</HI>
tumbles down. It is a tedious book; and, if
it were not attached to Addison's previous re∣putation,
one would not think much of it.
Had he written nothing else, his name would
not have lived. Addison does not seem to have
gone deep in Italian literature: he shews no∣thing
of it in his subsequent writings. He
shews a great deal of French learning.—There
is, perhaps, more knowledge circulated in the
French language than in any other. There is
more original knowledge in English.”—“But
the French (said I) have the art of accommo∣dating
literature.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, sir; we
have no such book as Moreri's Dictionary.”—
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “Their <HI>Ana</HI> are good.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “A
few of them are good; but we have one book
of that kind better than any of them; Selden's
<HI>Table-talk.</HI> As to original literature, the
<PB N="388" REF="394"/>
French have a couple of tragick poets who go
round the world, <HI>Racine</HI> and <HI>Corneille,</HI> and one
comick poet, <HI>Moliere.</HI>”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “They have
<HI>Fenelon.</HI>”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, sir, <HI>Telemachus</HI> is
pretty well.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “And <HI>Voltaire,</HI> sir.”—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “He has not stood his trial yet. And
what makes Voltaire chiefly circulate, is col∣lection;
such as his <HI>Universal History.</HI>”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“What do you say to the Bishop of <HI>Meaux?</HI>”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, nobody reads him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I take leave to enter my strongest protest against this judgement. <HI>Bessuet</HI> I hold to be one of the first luminaries of religion and literature. If there are who do not read him, it is full time they should begin.</NOTE>”.—He
would not allow <HI>Massillon</HI> and <HI>Bourdaloue</HI> to
go round the world. In general, however, he
gave the French much praise for their in∣dustry.</P>
<P>He asked me whether he had mentioned, in
any of the papers of the <HI>Rambler,</HI> the descrip∣tion
in Virgil of the entrance into Hell, with
an application to the press; “for (said he) I do
not much remember them.” I told him, “No.”
Upon which he repeated it:</P>
<Q><L>Vestibulum ante ipsum, primisque in faucibus orci,</L>
<L>Luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae;</L>
<L>Pallentesque habitant Morbi, tristisque Senectus,</L>
<L>Et Metus, et malasuada Fames, et turpis Egestas,</L>
<L>Terribiles visu formae; Lethumque, Laborque.</L></Q>
<P>“Now, (said he,) almost all these apply exactly
to an authour: all these are the concomitants of”
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
“a printing-house.” I proposed to him to dic∣tate
an essay on it, and offered to write it. He
said, he would not do it then, but perhaps
would write one at some future period.</P>
<P>The Sunday evening that we sat by ourselves
at Aberdeen, I asked him several particulars of
his life, from his early years, which he readily
told me; and I wrote them down before him.
This day I proceeded in my inquiries, also
writing them in his presence. I have them on
detached sheets. I shall collect authentick ma∣terials
for THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON,
LL. D.; and, if I survive him, I shall be one
who will most faithfully do honour to his me∣mory.
I have now a vast treasure of his con∣versation,
at different times, since the year 1762,
when I first obtained his acquaintance; and,
by assiduos inquiry, I can make up for not
knowing him sooner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is no small satisfaction to me to reflect, that Dr. Johnson read this, and, after being apprized of my intention, commu∣nicated to me, at subsequent periods, many particulars of his life, which probably could not otherwise have been preserved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A Newcastle ship-master, who happened to
be in the house, intruded himself upon us. He
was much in liquor, and talked nonsense about
his being a man for <HI>Wilkes and Liberty,</HI> and
against the ministry. Dr. Johnson was angry,
that “a fellow should come into <HI>our</HI> company,
who was fit for <HI>no</HI> company.” He left us soon.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="396"/>
Col returned from his aunt, and told us, she
insisted that we should come to her house that
night. He introduced to us Mr. Campbell,
the Duke of Argyle's factor in Tyr-yi. He
was a genteel, agreeable man. He was going
to Inveraray, and promised to put letters into
the post-office for us. I now found that Dr.
Johnson's desire to get on the main land, arose
from his anxiety to have an opportunity of
conveying letters to his friends.</P>
<P>After dinner, we proceeded to Dr. M'Lean's,
which was about a mile from our inn. He
was not at home, but we were received by his
lady and daughter, who entertained us so well,
that Dr. Johnson seemed quite happy. When
we had supped, he asked me to give him some
paper to write letters. I begged he would
write short ones, and not <HI>expatiate,</HI> as we should
set off early. He was irritated by this, and
said, “What must be done, must be done;
the thing is past a joke.”—“Nay, sir, said I,
write as much as you please; but do not blame
me, if we are kept six days before we get to the
main land. You was very impatient in the
morning; but no sooner do you find yourself
in good quarters, than you forget that you are
to move.” I got him paper enough, and we
parted in good humour.</P>
<P>Let me now recollect whatever particulars I
have omitted.—In the morning I said to him,
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
before we landed at Tobermorie, “We shall
see Dr. M'Lean, who has written the History
of the M'Leans.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “I have no great
patience to stay to hear the history of the
M'Leans. I would rather hear the History of
the Thrales.”—When on Mull, I said, “Well,
sir, this is the fourth of the Hebrides that we
have been upon.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, we cannot
boast of the number we have seen. We thought of
sailing about easily from island to island; and
so we should, had we come at a better season;
but we, being wise men, thought it would be
summer all the year where <HI>we</HI> were. However,
sir, we have seen enough to give us a pretty
good notion of the system of insular life.”—</P>
<P>Let me not forget, that he sometimes amused
himself with very slight reading; from which,
however, his conversation shewed that he con∣trived
to extract some benefit. At Captain
M'Lean's, he read a good deal in <HI>The Charmer,</HI>
a collection of songs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>15th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We this morning found that we could not
proceed, there being a violent storm of wind
and rain, and the rivers being impassable.
When I expressed my discontent at our con∣finement,
Dr. Johnson said, “Now that I
have had an opportunity of writing to the main
land, I am in no such haste.” I was amused
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>
with his being so easily satisfied; for the truth
was, that the gentleman who was to convey
our letters, as I was now informed, was not
to set out for Inveraray for some time; so that
it was probable we should be there as soon as
he: however, I did not undeceive my friend,
but suffered him to enjoy his fancy.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson asked, in the evening, to see
Dr. M'Lean's books. He took down Willis
<HI>de Anima Brutorum,</HI> and pored over it a good deal.</P>
<P>Miss M'Lean produced some Erse poems by
John M'Lean, who was a famous bard in
Mull, and had died only a few years ago. He
could neither read nor write. She read and
translated two of them; one, a kind of elegy
on Sir John M'Lean's being obliged to fly his
country in 1715; another, a dialogue between
two Roman Catholick young ladies, sisters,
whether it was better to be a nun or to marry.
I could not perceive much poetical imagery in
the translation. Yet all of our company who
understood Erse, seemed charmed with the
original. There may, perhaps, be some choice
of expression, and some excellence of arrange∣ment,
that cannot be shewn in translation.</P>
<P>After we had exhausted the Erse poems,
of which Dr. Johnson said nothing, Miss
M'Lean gave us several tunes on a spinnet,
which, though made so long ago, as in 1667,
was still very well toned. She sung along with
it. Dr. Johnson seemed pleased with the
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
musick, though he owns he neither likes it,
nor has hardly any perception of it. At Mr.
M'Pherson's, in Slate, he told us that “he knew
a drum from a trumpet, and a bagpipe from a
guittar, which was about the extent of his
knowledge of musick.” To-night he said, that,
“if he had learnt musick, he should have been
afraid he would have done nothing else than
play. It was a method of employing the mind,
without the labour of thinking at all, and with
some applause from a man's self.”</P>
<P>We had the musick of the bagpipe every
day, at Armidale, Dunvegan, and Col. Dr.
Johnson appeared fond of it, and used often to
stand for some time with his ear close to the
great drone.</P>
<P>The penurious gentleman of our acquaint∣ance,
formerly alluded to, afforded us a topick of
conversation to-night. Dr. Johnson said, I ought
to write down a collection of the instances of
his narrowness, as they almost exceeded belief.
Col told us, that O'Kane, the famous Irish
harper, was once at that gentleman's house.
He could not find in his heart to give him any
money, but gave him a key for a harp, which
was finely ornamented with gold and silver,
and with a precious stone, and was worth
eighty or a hundred guineas. He did not
know the value of it; and when he came to
know it, he would fain have had it back; but
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>
Okane took care that he should not.—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“They exaggerate the value; every body is
so desirous that he should be fleeced. I am very
willing it should be worth eighty or a hun∣dred
guineas; but I do not believe it.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“I do not think O'Kane was obliged to give it
back.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, sir. If a man with his
eyes open, and without any means used to
deceive him, gives me a thing, I am not to
let him have it again when he grows wiser. I
like to see how avarice defeats itself: how,
when avoiding to part with money, the miser
gives something more valuable.”—Col said,
the gentleman's relations were angry at his
giving away the harp-key, for it had been long
in the family.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, he values a
new guinea more than an old friend.”</P>
<P>Col also told us, that the same person having
come up with a serjeant and twenty men,
working on the high road, he entered into dis∣course
with the serjeant, and then gave him
sixpence for the men to drink. The serjeant
asked, “Who is this fellow?” Upon being
informed, he said, “If I had known who he was,
I should have thrown it in his face.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“There is much want of sense in all this.
He had no business to speak with the serjeant.
He might have been in haste, and trotted on.
He has not learnt to be a miser: I believe we
must take him apprentice.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “He
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>
would grudge giving half a guinea to be
taught.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, sir, you must teach
him <HI>gratis.</HI> You must give him an oppor∣tunity
to practice your precepts.”</P>
<P>Let me now go back, and glean <HI>Johnsoniana.</HI>
—The Saturday before we sailed from Slate, I
sat awhile in the afternoon with Dr. Johnson in
his room, in a quiet serious frame. I observed,
that hardly any man was accurately prepared
for dying; but almost every one left something
undone, something in confusion; that my
father, indeed, told me he knew one man,
(Carlisle of Limekilns,) after whose death all
his papers were found in exact order; and
nothing was omitted in his will.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir,
I had an uncle who died so; but such atten∣tion
requires great leisure, and great firmness of
mind. If one was to think constantly of death,
the business of life would stand still. I am no
friend to making religion appear too hard.
Many good people have done harm, by giving
severe notions of it. In the same way, as to
learning: I never frighten young people with
difficulties; on the contrary, I tell them that
they may very easily get as much as will do
very well. I do not indeed tell them that they
will be <HI>Bentleys.</HI>”</P>
<P>The night we rode to Col's house, I said,
“Lord Elibank is probably wondering what is
become of us.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “No, no; he is not
<PB N="396" REF="402"/>
thinking of us.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But recollect the
warmth with which he wrote. Are we not to
believe a man, when he says that he has a
great desire to see another? Don't you believe
that I was very impatient for your coming to
Scotland?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, sir; I believe,
you was; and I was impatient to come to you.
A young man feels so, but seldom an old
man.” I however convinced him that Lord
Elibank, who has much of the spirit of a young
man, might feel so.—He asked me if our jaunt
had answered expectation. I said it had much
exceeded it. I expected much difficulty with
him, and had not found it. “And (he added)
wherever we have come, we have been received
like princes in their progress.”</P>
<P>He said, he would not wish not to be disgusted
in the Highlands; for that would be to lose
the power of distinguishing, and a man might
then lie down in the middle of them. He
wished only to conceal his disgust.</P>
<P>At Captain M'Lean's, I mentioned Pope's
friend, Spence.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “He was a weak
conceited man.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “A good scholar,
sir?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, no, sir.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI>
“He was a pretty scholar.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “You
have about reached him.”</P>
<P>Last night at the inn, when the factor in
Tyr-yi spoke of his having heard that a roof
was put on some part of the buildings at
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
Icolmkill, I unluckily said, “It will be for∣tunate
if we find a cathedral with a roof on it.”
I said this from a foolish anxiety to engage Dr.
Johnson's curiosity more. He took me short
at once. “What, sir? how can you talk so?
If we shall <HI>find</HI> a cathedral roofed! as if we were
going to a <HI>terra incognita:</HI> when every thing
that is at Icolmkill is so well known. You are
like some New-England-men who came to the
mouth of the Thames. “Come, said they, let
us go up and see what sort of inhabitants there
are here.” They talked, sir, as if they had
been to go up the Susquehannah, or any other
American river.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>16th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This day there was a new moon, and the
weather changed for the better. Dr. Johnson
said of Miss M'Lean, “She is the most ac∣complished
lady that I have found in the High∣lands.
She knows French, musick, and draw∣ing,
sews neatly, makes shell-work, and can
milk cows; in short, she can do every thing.
She talks sensibly, and is the first person whom
I have found, that can translate Erse poetry lite∣rally.”
—We set out, mounted on little Mull
horses. Mull corresponded exactly with the
idea which I had always had of it; a hilly
country, diversified with heath and grass, and
many rivulets. Dr. Johnson was not in very
<PB N="398" REF="404"/>
good humour. He said, it was a dreary country,
much worse than Sky. I differed from him.
“O, sir, (said he,) a most dolorous country!”</P>
<P>We had a very hard journey to-day. I had
no bridle for my sheltie, but only a halter; and
Joseph rode without a saddle. At one place,
a loch having swelled over the road, we were
obliged to plunge through pretty deep water.
Dr. Johnson observed, how helpless a man
would be, were he travelling here alone, and
should meet with any accident; and said, “he
longed to get to <HI>a country of saddles and
bridles.</HI>” He was more out of humour to-day,
than he has been in the course of our Tour, be∣ing
fretted to find that his little horse could
scarcely support his weight;—and having suf∣fered
a loss, which, though small in itself, was
of some consequence to him, while travelling
the rugged steeps of Mull, where he was at
times obliged to walk. The loss that I allude
to was that of the large oak-stick, which, as I
formerly mentioned, he had brought with
him from London. It was of great use to him
in our wild peregrination; for, ever since his
last illness in 1766, he has had a weakness in his
knees, and not been able to walk easily. It
had too the properties of a measure; for one
nail was driven into it at the length of a foot;
another at that of a yard. In return for the
services it had done him, he said, this morning,
<PB N="399" REF="405"/>
he would make a present of it to some Museum;
but he little thought he was so soon to lose it.
As he preferred riding with a switch, it was en∣trusted
to a fellow to be delivered to our bag∣gage-man,
who followed us at some distance;
but we never saw it more. I could not per∣suade
him out of a suspicion that it had
been stolen. “No, no, my friend, (said he,)
it is not to be expected that any man in Mull,
who has got it, will part with it. Consider, sir,
the value of such a <HI>piece of timber</HI> here!”</P>
<P>As we travelled this forenoon, we met Dr.
M'Lean, who expressed much regret at his
having been so unfortunate as to be absent
while we were at his house.</P>
<P>We were in hopes to get to Sir Allan Mac∣lean's,
at Inchkenneth, to-night; but the eight
miles, of which our road was said to consist,
were so very long, that we did not reach the
opposite coast of Mull till seven at night,
though we had set out about eleven in the
forenoon; and when we did arrive there, we
found the wind strong against us. Col deter∣mined
that we should pass the night at
M'Quarrie's, in the island of Ulva, which lies
between Mull and Inchkenneth; and a servant
was sent forward to the ferry, to secure the boat
for us: but the boat was gone to the Ulva side,
and the wind was so high that the people could
not hear him call; and the night so dark that
<PB N="400" REF="406"/>
they could not see a signal. We should have
been in a very bad situation, had there not for∣tunately
been lying in the little sound of Ulva
an Irish vessel, the Bonnetta, of Londonderry,
Captain M'Lure, master. He himself was at
M'Quarrie's; but his men obligingly came
with their long-boat, and ferried us over.</P>
<P>M'Quarrie's house was mean; but we were
agreeably surprised with the appearance of the
master, whom we found to be intelligent, po∣lite,
and much a man of the world. Though
his clan is not numerous, he is a very ancient
Chief, and has a burial-place at Icolmkill. He
told us, his family had possessed Ulva for nine
hundred years; but I was distressed to hear that
it was soon to be sold for payment of his debts.</P>
<P>Captain M'Lure, whom we found here, was
of Scotch extraction, and properly a M'Leod,
being descended of some of the M'Leods who
went with Sir Normand of Bernera to the battle
of Worcester; and, after the defeat of the
royalists, fled to Ireland, and, to conceal them∣selves,
took a different name. He told me,
there was a great number of them about Lon∣donderry;
some of good property. I said, they
should now resume their real name. The Laird
of M'Leod should go over, and assemble them,
and make them all drink the large horn full,
and from that time they should be M'Leods.—
The captain informed us, he had named his ship
<PB N="401" REF="407"/>
the Bonnetta, out of gratitude to Providence;
for once, when he was sailing to America with
a good number of passengers, the ship in which
he then sailed was becalmed for five weeks, and
during all that time, numbers of the fish Bon∣netta
swam close to her, and were catched for
food; he resolved therefore that the ship he
should next get should be called the Bonnetta.</P>
<P>M'Quarrie told us a strong instance of the
second sight. He had gone to Edinburgh, and
taken a man-servant along with him. An old
woman, who was in the house, said one day,
“M'Quarrie will be at home to-morrow, and
will bring two gentlemen with him;” and she
said, she saw his servant return in red and green.
He did come home next day. He had two
gentlemen with him; and his servant had a
new red and green livery, which M'Quarrie
had bought for him at Edinburgh, upon a
sudden thought, not having had the least inten∣tion
when he left home to put his servant in
livery; so that the old woman could not have
heard any previous mention of it. This, he
assured us, was a true story.</P>
<P>M'Quarrie insisted that the <HI>Mercheta Mulie∣rum,</HI>
mentioned in our old charters, did really
mean the privilege which a lord of a manor, or a
baron, had, to have the first night of all his vas∣sals'
wives. Dr. Johnson said, the belief of such a
custom having existed was also held in England,
<PB N="402" REF="408"/>
where there is a tenure called <HI>Borough-English,</HI>
by which the eldest child does not inherit, from
a doubt of his being the son of the tenant.
M'Quarrie told us, that still, on the marriage
of each of his tenants, a sheep is due to him;
for which the composition is fixed at five shil∣lings.
I suppose, Ulva is the only place where
this custom remains.</P>
<P>Talking of the sale of an estate of an ancient
family, which was said to have been purchased
much under its value by the confidential lawyer
of that family, and it being mentioned that the
sale would probably be set aside by a suit in
equity, Dr. Johnson said, “I am very willing
that this sale should be set aside, but I doubt
much whether the suit will be successful; for
the argument for avoiding the sale is founded
on vague and indeterminate principles,—as that
the price was too low, and that there was a
great degree of confidence placed by the seller
in the person who became the purchaser. Now
how low should a price be? or what degree of
confidence should there be to make a bargain
be set aside? a bargain, which is a wager of
skill between man and man.—If, indeed, any
fraud can be proved, that will do.”</P>
<P>When Dr. Johnson and I were by ourselves
at night, I observed of our host, “<HI>aspectum ge∣nerosum
habet:”—“et generosum animum,</HI>” he
added.—For fear of being overheard in the
<PB N="403" REF="409"/>
small Highland houses, I often talked to him
in such Latin as I could speak, and with as
much of the English accent as I could assume,
so as not to be understood, in case our conver∣sation
should be too loud for the space.</P>
<P>We had each an elegant bed in the same
room; and here it was that a circumstance oc∣curred,
as to which he has been strangely misun∣derstood.
From his description of his chamber,
it has erroneously been supposed, that, his bed
being too short for him, his feet, during the
night, were in the mire; whereas he has only
said, that, when he undressed, he felt his feet in
the mire: that is, the clay-floor of the room,
on which he stood before he went into bed, was
wet, in consequence of the windows being
broken, which let in the rain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>17th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Being informed that there was nothing wor∣thy
of observation in Ulva, we took boat, and
proceeded to Inchkenneth, where we were in∣troduced
by our friend Col to Sir Allan Mac∣lean,
the Chief of his clan, and to two young
ladies, his daughters. Inchkenneth is a pretty
little island, a mile long, and about half a mile
broad, all good land.</P>
<P>As we walked up from the shore, Dr. John∣son's
heart was cheered by the sight of a road
marked with cart-wheels, as on the main land; a
<PB N="404" REF="410"/>
thing we had not seen for a long time. It
gave us a pleasure similar to that which a tra∣veller
feels, when, whilst wandering on what he
fears is a desart island, he perceives the print of
human feet.</P>
<P>Military men acquire excellent habits of
having all conveniencies about them. Sir
Allan M'Lean, who had been long in the
army, and had now a lease of this island, had
formed a commodious habitation, though it
consisted but of a few small buildings, only
one story high. He had, in his little apart∣ments,
more things than I could enumerate
in a page or two.</P>
<P>Among other agreeable circumstances, it
was not the least, to find here a parcel of the
<HI>Caledonian Mercury,</HI> published since we left
Edinburgh; which I read with that pleasure
which every man feels who has been for some
time secluded from the animated scenes of the
busy world.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson found books here. He bade me
buy Bishop Gastrell's <HI>Christian Institutes,</HI> which
was lying in the room. He said, “I do not
like to read any thing on a Sunday, but what
is theological; not that I would scrupulously
refuse to look at any thing which a friend
should shew me in a news-paper; but in gene∣ral,
I would read only what is theological.—I
read just now some of Drummond's Travels,
<PB N="405" REF="411"/>
before I perceived what books were here. I
then took up Derham's Physico-Theology.”</P>
<P>Ever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particular concerning this island hav∣ing
been so well described by Dr. Johnson, it
would be superfluous in me to present the pub∣lick
with the observations that I made upon it,
in my Journal.</P>
<P>I was quite easy with Sir Allan almost in∣stantaneously.
He knew the great intimacy
that had been between my father and his pre∣decessor,
Sir Hector, and was himself of a very
frank disposition.—After dinner, Sir Allan said
he had got Dr. Campbell about an hundred
subscribers to his <HI>Britannia Elucidata,</HI> (a work
since published under the title of <HI>A Political
Survey of Great-Britain,)</HI> of whom he believed
twenty were dead, the publication having been
so long delayed.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I imagine the
delay of publication is owing to this;—that,
after publication, there will be no more sub∣scribers,
and few will send the additional gui∣nea
to get their books: in which they will be
wrong; for there will be a great deal of in∣struction
in the work. I think highly of
Campbell. In the first place, he has very good
parts. In the second place, he has very exten∣sive
reading; not, perhaps, what is properly
called learning, but history, politicks, and, in
short, that popular knowledge which makes a
man very useful. In the third place, he has
<PB N="406" REF="412"/>
learnt much by what is called the <HI>vox viva.</HI> He
talks with a great many people.”</P>
<P>Speaking of this gentleman, at Rasay, he
told us, that he one day called on him, and
they talked of Tull's <HI>Husbandry.</HI> Dr. Campbell
said something. Dr. Johnson began to dispute
it. “Come, said Dr. Campbell, we do not
want to get the better of one another: we want
to increase each other's ideas.”—Dr. Johnson
took it in good part, and the conversation then
went on coolly and instructively.—His candour
in relating this anecdote does him much credit;
and his conduct on that occasion proves how
easily he could be persuaded to talk from a
better motive than “for victory.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson here shewed so much of the
spirit of a Highlander, that he won Sir Allan's
heart: indeed, he has shewn it during the
whole of our Tour.—One night, in Col, he
strutted about the room with a broad-sword and
target, and made a formidable appearance;
and, another night, I took the liberty to put a
large blue bonnet on his head. His age, his
size, and his bushy grey wig, with this covering
on it, presented the image of a venerable
<HI>Senachi;</HI> and, however unfavourable to the
Lowland Scots, he seemed much pleased to as∣sume
the appearance of an ancient Caledonian.
We only regretted that he could not be pre∣vailed
with to partake of the social glass. One
<PB N="407" REF="413"/>
of his arguments against drinking, appears to
me not convincing. He urged, that “in pro∣portion
as drinking makes a man different from
what he is before he has drunk, it is bad; be∣cause
it has so far affected his reason.”—But
may it not be answered, that a man may be al∣tered
by it <HI>for the better;</HI> that his spirits may
be exhilarated, without his reason being af∣fected?
On the general subject of drinking,
however, I do not mean positively to take the
other side. I am <HI>dubius, non improbus.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening, Sir Allan informed us that it
was the custom of his house to have prayers
every Sunday; and Miss M'Lean read the
evening service, in which we all joined. I
then read Ogden's second and ninth Sermons
on Prayer, which, with their other distinguished
excellence, have the merit of being short. Dr.
Johnson said, that it was the most agreeable
Sunday he had ever passed; and it made such
an impression on his mind, that he afterwards
wrote the following ode upon Inchkenneth:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>INSULA SANCTI KENNETHI.</HEAD>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>18th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We agreed to pass this day with Sir Allan,
and he engaged to have every thing in order
for our voyage to-morrow.</P>
<P>Being now soon to be separated from our
amiable friend young Col, his merits were
all remembered. At Ulva he had ap∣peared
in a new character, having given us a
good prescription for a cold. On my men∣tioning
him with warmth, Dr. Johnson said,
“Col does every thing for us: we will erect
a statue to Col.”—“Yes, said I, and we will
have him with his various attributes and cha∣racters,
like Mercury, or any other of the
heathen gods. We will have him as a pilot;
we will have him as a fisherman, as a hunter,
as a husbandman, as a physician.”</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="415"/>
I this morning took a spade, and dug a
little grave in the floor of a ruined chapel near
Sir Allan M'Lean's house, in which I buried
some human bones I found there. Dr. Johnson
praised me for what I had done, though he
owned, he could not have done it. He shewed
in the chapel at Rasay, his horrour at dead
mens' bones. He shewed it again at Col's
house. In the Charter-room there was a
remarkably large shin-bone, which was said to
have been a bone of <HI>John Garve,</HI> one of the
lairds. Dr. Johnson would not look at it; but
started away.</P>
<P>At breakfast, I asked, “What is the reason
that we are angry at a trader's having opu∣lence?”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, sir, the reason is,
(though I don't undertake to prove that there
is a reason,) we see no qualities in trade that
should entitle a man to superiority. We are
not angry at a soldier's getting riches, because
we see that he possesses qualities which we have
not. If a man returns from a battle, having
lost one hand, and with the other full of gold,
we feel that he deserves the gold; but we
cannot think that a fellow, by sitting all day
at a desk, is entitled to get above us.”—<HI>Bos∣well.</HI>
“But, sir, may we not suppose a mer∣chant
to be a man of an enlarged mind, such
as Addison in the <HI>Spectator</HI> describes Sir An∣drew
Freeport to have been?”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why,
<PB N="410" REF="416"/>
sir, we may suppose any fictitious character.
We may suppose a philosophi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al day-labourer,
who is happy in reflecting that, by his labour,
he contributes to the fertility of the earth, and
to the support of his fellow-creatures; but we
find no such philosophical day-labourer. A
merchant may, perhaps, be a man of an en∣larged
mind; but there is nothing in trade
connected with an enlarged mind.”</P>
<P>I mentioned that I had heard Dr. Solander
say he was a Swedish Laplander.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir,
I don't believe he is a Laplander. The Lap∣landers
are not much above four feet high.
He is as tall you; and he has not the copper
colour of a Laplander.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “But what
motive could he have to make himself a Lap∣lander?”
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, sir, he must
either mean the word Laplander in a very ex∣tensive
sense, or may mean a voluntary degra∣dation
of himself, “For all my being the
great man that you see me now, I was origi∣nally
a Barbarian;” as if Burke should say, “I
came over a wild Irishman,”—which he might
say in his present state of exaltation.”</P>
<P>Having expressed a desire to have an island
like Inchkenneth, Dr. Johnson set himself
to think what would be necessary for a man in
such a situation. “Sir, I should build me a
fortification, if I came to live here; for, if you
have it not, what should hinder a parcel of ruf∣fians
<PB N="411" REF="417"/>
to land in the night, and carry off every
thing you have in the house, which, in a remote
country, would be more valuable than cows
and sheep? add to all this the danger of hav∣ing
your throat cut.”—<HI>Boswell.</HI> “I would have
a large dog.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “So you may, sir;
but a large dog is of no use but to alarm.”—
He, however, I apprehend, thinks too lightly
of the power of that animal. I have heard him
say, that he is afraid of no dog. “He would
take him up by the hinder legs, which would
render him quite helpless,—and then knock his
head against a stone, and beat out his brains.”
—Topham Beauclerk told me, that at his house
in the country, two large ferocious dogs were
fighting. Dr. Johnson looked steadily at them
for a little while; and then, as one would se∣parate
two little boys who are foolishly hurting
each other, he ran up to them, and cuffed their
heads till he drove them asunder. But few
men have his intrepidity, Herculean strength,
or presence of mind. Most thieves or robbers
would be afraid to encounter a mastiff.</P>
<P>I observed, that, when young Col talked of the
lands belonging to his family, he always said,
“<HI>my</HI> lands.” For this he had a plausible pretence;
for he told me, there has been a custom in this
family, that the laird resigns the estate to the
eldest son when he comes of age, reserving to
himself only a certain life-rent. He said, it
<PB N="412" REF="418"/>
was a voluntary custom; but I think I found
an instance in the charter-room that there was
such an obligation in a contract of marriage.
If the custom was voluntary, it was only cu∣rious;
but if founded on obligation, it might
be dangerous: for I have been told, that in
Otaheité, whenever a child is born, (a son, I
think,) the father loses his right to the estate
and honours, and that this unnatural, or rather
absurd custom, occasions the murder of many
children.</P>
<P>Young Col told us he could run down a
greyhound; “for, said he, the dog runs him∣self
out of breath, by going too quick, and then
I get up with him.” I accounted for his advan∣tage
over the dog, by remarking that Col had
the faculty of reason, and knew how to mode∣rate
his pace, which the dog had not sense
enough to do. Dr. Johnson said, “He is a
noble animal. He is as complete an islander as
the mind can figure. He is a farmer, a sailor,
a hunter, a fisher: he will run you down a dog:
if any man has a <HI>tail,</HI> it is Col. He is hospi∣table;
and he has an intrepidity of talk, whe∣ther
he understands the subject or not. I regret
that he is not more intellectual.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson observed, that there was nothing
of which he would not undertake to persuade a
Frenchman in a foreign country. “I'll carry
a Frenchman to St. Paul's Church-yard, and
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>
I'll tell him, “by our law, you may walk half
round the church; but, if you walk round the
whole, you will be punished capitally:” and he
will believe me at once. Now, no Englishman
would readily swallow such a thing: he would
go and inquire of somebody else.”—The
Frenchman's credulity, I observed, must be
owing to his being accustomed to implicit sub∣mission;
whereas every Englishman reasons
upon the laws of his country, and instructs his
representatives who compose the legislature.</P>
<P>This day was passed in looking at a small
island adjoining Inchkenneth, which afforded
nothing worthy of observation; and in such
social and gay entertainments as our little so∣ciety
could furnish.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>19th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After breakfast we took leave of the young
ladies, and of our excellent companion Col, to
whom we had been so much obliged. He had
now put us under the care of his Chief; and
was to hasten back to Sky. We parted from
him with very strong feelings of kindness and
gratitude; and we hoped to have had some fu∣ture
opportunity of proving to him the sincerity
of what we felt; but in the following year he
was unfortunately lost in the Sound between
Ulva and Mull; and this imperfect memorial,
joined to the high honour of being tenderly
<PB N="414" REF="420"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd respectfully mentioned by Dr. Johnson, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the only return which the uncertainty of huma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
events has permitted us to make to this deserv∣ving
young man.</P>
<P>Sir Allan, who obligingly undertook to
accompany us to Icolmkill, had a strong good
boat, with four stout rowers. We coasted
along Mull till we reached <HI>Gribon,</HI> where is
what is called Mackinnon's cave, compared
with which that at Ulinish is inconsiderable.
It is in a rock of a great height close to the sea.
Upon the left of its entrance there is a cascade,
almost perpendicular from top to bottom of
the rock. There is a tradition that it was
conducted thither artificially, to supply the in∣habitants
of the cave with water. Dr. John∣son
gave no credit to this tradition. As, on
the one hand, his faith in the Christian religion
is firmly founded upon good grounds; so, on
the other, he is incredulous when there is no
sufficient reason for belief; being in this re∣spect
just the reverse of modern infidels, who,
however nice and scrupulous in weighing the
evidences of religion, are yet often so ready to
believe the most absurd and improbable tales of
another nature, that Lord Hailes well ob∣served,
a good essay might be written <HI>Sur la
credulité des Incredules.</HI></P>
<P>The height of this cave I cannot tell with
any tolerable exactness; but it seemed to be
<PB N="415" REF="421"/>
very lofty, and to be a pretty regular arch.
We penetrated, by candlelight, a great way;
by our measurement, no less than four hundred
and eighty-five feet. Tradition says, that a
piper and twelve men once advanced into this
cave, nobody can tell how far; and never re∣turned.
At the distance to which we pro∣ceeded
the air was quite pure; for the candle
burnt freely, without the least appearance of
the flame growing globular; but as we had
only one, we thought it dangerous to venture
further, lest, should it have been extinguished,
we should have had no means of ascertaining
whether we could remain without danger. Dr.
Johnson said, this was the greatest natural cu∣riosity
he had ever seen.</P>
<P>We saw the island of Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a, at no very great
distance, but could not land upon it, the surge
was so high on its rocky coast.</P>
<P>Sir Allan, anxious for the honour of Mull,
was still talking of its <HI>woods,</HI> and pointing them
out to Dr. Johnson, as appearing at a distance
on the skirts of that island, as we sailed along.
—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, I saw at Tobermorie what
they called a wood, which I unluckily took for
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath.</HI> If you shew me what I shall take for
<HI>furze,</HI> it will be something.”</P>
<P>In the afternoon we went ashore on the coast
of Mull, and partook of a cold repast, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e carried with us. We hoped to have pro∣cured
<PB N="416" REF="422"/>
some rum or brandy for our boatmen
and servants, from a publick-house near where
we landed; but unfortunately a funeral a few
days before had exhausted all their store. Mr.
Campbell however, one of the Duke of Argyle's
tacksmen, who lived in the neighbourhood, on
receiving a message from Sir Allan, sent us a
liberal supply.</P>
<P>We continued to coast along Mull, and
passed by Nuns' Island, which it is said be∣longed
to the nuns of Icolmkill, and from
which, we were told, the stone for the buildings
there was taken. As we sailed along by moon∣light,
in a sea somewhat rough, and often be∣tween
black and gloomy rocks, Dr. Johnson
said, “If this be not <HI>roving among the
Hebrides,</HI> nothing is.”—The repetition of
words which he had so often previously used,
made a strong impression on my imagination;
and, by a natural course of thinking, led me
to consider how our present adventures would
appear to me at a future period.</P>
<P>I have often experienced, that scenes through
which a man has passed, improve by lying in
the memory: they grow mellow. <HI>Acti labores
sunt jucundi.</HI> This may be owing to comparing
them with present listless ease. Even harsh
scenes acquire a softness by length of time;
and some are like very loud sounds, which do
not please, or at least do not please so much,
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>
till you are removed to a certain distance.
They may be compared to strong coarse pic∣tures,
which will not bear to be viewed near.
Even pleasing scenes improve by time, and
seem more exquisite in recollection, than when
they were present; if they have not faded to
dimness in the memory. Perhaps, there is so
much evil in every human enjoyment, when
present,—so much dross mixed with it, that it
requires to be refined by time; and yet I do
not see why time should not melt away the
good and the evil in equal proportions;—why
the shade should decay, and the light remain in
preservation.</P>
<P>After a tedious sail, which, by our following
various turnings of the coast of Mull, was ex∣tended
to about forty miles, it gave us no
small pleasure to perceive a light in the village
at Icolmkill, in which almost all the inhabitants
of the island live, close to where the ancient
buildings stood. As we approached the shore,
the tower of the cathedral, just discernible in
the air, was a picturesque object.</P>
<P>When we had landed upon this sacred place,
which, as long as I can remember, I had
thought on with veneration, Dr. Johnson and
Icordially embraced. We had long talked of
visiting I colmkill; and, from the lateness of the
season, were at times very doubtful whether we
should be able to effect our purpose. To have
seen it, even alone, would have given me great
<PB N="418" REF="424"/>
satisfaction; but the venerable scene was ren∣dered
much more pleasing by the company of
my great and pious friend, who was no less
affected by it than I was; and who has de∣scribed
the impressions it should make on the
mind, with such strength of thought, and ener∣gy
of language, that I shall quote his words,
as conveying my own sensations much more
forcibly than I am capable of doing:</P>
<P>“WE were now treading that illustrious
Island, which was once the luminary of the
Caledonian regions, whence savage clans and
roving barbarians derived the benefits of know∣ledge,
and the blessings of religion. To ab∣stract

Upon hearing that Sir Allan M'Lean was ar∣rived,
the inhabitants, who still consider them∣selves
as the people of M'Lean, to whom the
island formerly belonged, though the Duke of
Argyle has at present possession of it, ran ea∣gerly
to him.</P>
<P>We were accommodated this night in a large
barn, the island affording no lodging that we
should have liked so well. Some good hay was
strewed at one end of it, to form a bed for us,
upon which we lay with our clothes on; and we
were furnished with blankets from the village.
Each of us had a portmanteau for a pillow.
When I awaked in the morning, and looked
round me, I could not help smiling at the idea
of the Chief of the M'Leans, the great English
Moralist, and myself, lying thus extended in
such a situation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>20th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Early in the morning we surveyed the re∣mains
of antiquity at this place, accompanied
by an illiterate fellow, as <HI>Cicerone,</HI> who called
himself a descendant of a cousin of Saint Co∣lumba,
the founder of the religious establish∣ment
here. As I knew that many persons had
<PB N="420" REF="426"/>
already examined them, and as I saw Dr.
Johnson inspecting and measuring several of
the ruins of which he has since given so full an
account, my mind was quiescent; and I re∣solved
to stroll among them at my ease, to take
no trouble to investigate minutely, and only
receive the general impression of solemn anti∣quity,
and the particular ideas of such objects
as should of themselves strike my attention.</P>
<P>We walked from the Monastery of Nuns to
the great church or cathedral, as they call it,
along an old broken causeway. They told us,
that this had been a street; and that there were
good houses built on each side. Dr. Johnson
doubted if it was any thing more than a paved
road for the nuns. The Convent of Monks,
the great church, Oran's chapel, and four other
chapels, are still to be discerned. But I must
own that Icolmkill did not answer my expec∣tations;
for they were high, from what I had
read of it, and still more from what I had heard
and thought of it, from my earliest years. Dr.
Johnson said, it came up to his expectations,
because he had taken his impression from an
account of it subjoined to Sacheverel's History
of the Isle of Man, where it is said, there is
not much to be seen here. We were both dis∣appointed,
when we were shewn what are
called the monuments of the Kings of Scotland,
Ireland, and Denmark, and of a King of
<PB N="421" REF="427"/>
France. There are only some grave-stones
flat on the earth, and we could see no inscrip∣tions.
How far short was this of marble mo∣numents,
like those in Westminster-Abbey,
which I had imaged here! The grave-stones
of Sir Allan M'Lean's family, and of
that of M'Quarrie, had as good an appearance
as the royal ones; if they were royal, which
we doubted.</P>
<P>My easiness to give credit to what I heard
in the course of our Tour, was too great. Dr.
Johnson's peculiar accuracy of investigation
detected much traditional fiction, and many
gross mistakes. It is not to be wondered at,
that he was provoked by people carelessly telling
him, with the utmost readiness and confidence,
what he found, on questioning them a little
more, was erroneous. Of this there were in∣numerable
instances.</P>
<P>I left him and Sir Allan at breakfast in
our barn, and stole back again to the cathe∣dral,
to indulge in solitude and devout medi∣tation.
While contemplating the venerable
ruins, I reflected with much satisfaction, that
the solemn scenes of piety never lose their sanc∣tity
and influence, though the cares and follies
of life may prevent us from visiting them, or
may even make us fancy that their effects are
only “as yesterday, when it is past,” and never
again to be perceived. I hoped, that, ever after
having been in this holy place, I should main∣tain
<PB N="422" REF="428"/>
an exemplary conduct. One has a strange
propensity to fix upon some point of time from
whence a better course of life may begin.</P>
<P>Being desirous to visit the opposite shore of
the island, where Saint Columba is said to have
landed, I procured a horse from one M'Ginnis,
who ran along as my guide. The M'Ginnises
are said to be a branch of the clan of M'Lean.
Sir Allan had been told that this man had re∣fused
to send him some rum, at which the
knight was in great indignation. “You rascal!
(said he,) don't you know that I can hang you,
if I please?”—Not adverting to the Chieftain's
power over his clan, I imagined that Sir
Allan had known of some capital crime that
the fellow had committed, which he could dis∣cover,
and so get him condemned; and said,
“How so?”—“Why, (said Sir Allan,) are
they not all my people?”—Sensible of my in∣advertency,
and most willing to contribute what
I could towards the continuation of feudal au∣thority,
“Very true,” said I.—Sir Allan went
on: “Refuse to send rum to me, you rascal!
Don't you know that, if I order you to go and
cut a man's throat, you are to do it?”—“Yes,
an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t please your honour! and my own too, and
hang myself too.”—The poor fellow denied
that he had refused to send the rum. His
making these professions was not merely a pre∣tence
in presence of his Chief; for after he and
<PB N="423" REF="429"/>
I were out of Sir Allan's hearing, he told me,
“Had he sent his dog for the rum, I would
have given it: I would cut my bones for him.”
—It was very remarkable to find such an at∣tachment
to a Chief, though he had then no
connection with the island, and had not been
there for fourteen years.—Sir Allan, by way of
upbraiding the fellow, said, “I believe you
are a <HI>Campbell.</HI>”</P>
<P>The place which I went to see is about two
miles from the village. They call it <HI>Porta∣wherry,</HI>
from the wherry in which Columba
came; though, when they shew the length of
his vessel, as marked on the beach by two heaps
of stones, they say, “Here is the length of the
<HI>Currach,</HI>” using the Erse word.</P>
<P>Icolmkill is a fertile island. The inhabitants
export some cattle and grain; and, I was told,
they import nothing but iron and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt. They
are industrious, and make their own woollen
and linen cloth; and they brew a good deal of
beer, which we did not find in any of the other
islands.</P>
<P>We set sail again about mid-day, and in the
evening landed on Mull, near the house of the
Reverend Mr. Neil M'Leod, who, having been
informed of our coming, by a message from
Sir Allan, came out to meet us. We were this
night very agreeably entertained at his house.
Dr. Johnson observed to me, that he was the
<PB N="424" REF="430"/>
cleanest-headed man that he had met with in
the Western Islands. He seemed to be well
acquainted with Dr. Johnson's writings, and
courteously said, “I have been often obliged
to you, though I never had the pleasure of see∣ing
you before.”</P>
<P>He told us, he had lived for some time in
St. Kilda, under the tuition of the minister or
catechist there; and had there first read Horace
and Virgil. The scenes which they describe
must have been a strong contrast to the dreary
waste around him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>21st October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This morning the subject of politicks was
introduced.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Pulteney was as paltry
a fellow as could be. He was a Whig, who
pretended to be honest; and you know it is
ridiculous for a Whig to pretend to be honest.
He cannot hold it out.”—He called Mr. Pitt a
meteor: Sir Robert Walpole a fixed star.—He
said, “It is wonderful to think that all the
force of government was required to prevent
Wilkes from being chosen the chief magistrate
of London, though the liverymen knew he
would rob their shops,—knew he would de∣bauch
their daughters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I think it incumbent on me to make some observation on this strong satirical sally on my classical companion, Mr. Wilkes. Reporting it lately from memory, in his presence, I expressed it thus:—“They knew he would rob their shops, <HI>if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> durst;</HI> they knew he would debauch their daughters, <HI>if he could;</HI>” which, according to the French phrase, may be said <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ncherir</HI> on Dr. Johnson; but on looking into my Journal, I found it as above, and would by no means make any addi∣tion. Mr. Wilkes received both readings with a good hu∣mour that I cannot enough admire. Indeed both he and I (as, with respect to myself, the reader has more than once bad occasion to observe in the course of this Journal,) are too <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of a <HI>bon-mot,</HI> not to relish it, though we should be our∣selves the object of it.</P>
<P>Let me add, in justice to the gentleman here mentioned, that, at a subsequent period, he <HI>was</HI> elected chief magistrate of London, and discharged the duties of that high office with great honour to himself, and advantage to the city.—Some years before Dr. Johnson died, I was fortunate enough to bring him and Mr. Wilkes together: the consequence of which was, that they were ever afterwards on easy, and not unfriendly terms. The particulars I shall have great pleasure in relating at large in my LIFE OF DR. JOHNSON.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="431"/>
<HI>Boswell.</HI> “The History of England is so
strange, that, if it were not so well vouched as
it is, it would hardly be credible.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI>
“Sir, if it were told as shortly, and with as
little preparation for introducing the different
events, as the History of the Jewish Kings, it
would be equally liable to objections of impro∣bability.”
—Mr. M'Leod was much pleased
with the justice and novelty of the thought.—
Dr. Johnson illustrated what he had said, as fol∣lows:
“Take, as an instance, Charles the
First's concessions to his parliament, which were
greater and greater, in proportion as the par∣liament
grew more insolent, and less deserving
<PB N="426" REF="432"/>
of trust. Had these concessions been related
nakedly, without any detail of the circum∣stances
which gradually led to them, they
would not have been believed.”</P>
<P>Sir Allan M'Lean bragged, that Scotland had
the advantage of England, by its having more
water. <HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, we would not have your
water, to take the vile bogs which produce it.
You have too much! A man who is drowned
has more water than either of us;”—and then he
laughed.—(But this was surely robust sophistry;
for the people of taste in England, who have
seen Scotland, own that its variety of rivers and
lakes makes it naturally more beautiful than
England, in that respect.)—Pursuing his vic∣tory
over Sir Allan, he proceeded: “Your
country consists of two things, stone and water.
There is, indeed, a little earth above the stone
in some places, but a very little; and the stone
is always appearing. It is like a man in rags;
the naked skin is still peeping out.”</P>
<P>He took leave of Mr. M'Leod, saying, “Sir,
I thank you for your entertainment, and your
conversation.”</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell, who had been so polite yes∣terday,
came this morning on purpose to break∣fast
with us, and very obligingly furnished us
with horses to proceed on our journey to Mr.
M'Clean's of <HI>Lochbuy,</HI> where we were to
pass the night. We dined at the house of Dr.
<PB N="427" REF="433"/>
Alexander M'Lean, another physician in Mull,
who was so much struck with the uncommon
conversation of Dr. Johnson, that he observed
to me, “This man is just a <HI>hogshead</HI> of sense.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson said of the <HI>Turkish Spy,</HI> which
lay in the room, that it told nothing but what
every body might have known at that time;
and that what was good in it, did not pay you
for the trouble of reading to find it.</P>
<P>After a very tedious ride, through what
appeared to me the most gloomy and deso∣late
country I had ever beheld, we arrived,
between seven and eight o'clock, at <HI>Moy,</HI>
the seat of the Laird of <HI>Lochbuy.—Buy,</HI> in
Erse, signifies yellow, and I at first imagined
that the loch or branch of the sea here, was
thus denominated, in the same manner as the
<HI>Red Sea;</HI> but I afterwards learnt it derived its
name from a hill above it, which, being of a
yellowish hue, has the epithet of <HI>Buy.</HI></P>
<P>We had heard much of Lochbuy's being
a great roaring braggadocio, a kind of
Sir John Falstaff, both in size and m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nners;
but we found that they had swelled him up to
a fictitious size, and clothed him with imagi∣nary
qualities.—Col's idea of him was equally
extravagant, though very different: he told us,
he was quite a Don Quixote; and said, he
would give a great deal to see him and Dr.
Johnson together. The truth is, that Loch∣buy
<PB N="428" REF="434"/>
proved to be only a bluff, comely, noisy
old gentleman, proud of his hereditary conse∣quence,
and a very hearty and hospitable land∣lord.
Lady Lochbuy was sister to Sir Allan
M'Lean, but much older. He said to me,
“They are quite <HI>Antediluvians.</HI>” Being told that
Dr. Johnson did not hear well, Lochbuy bawled
out to him, “Are you of the Johnstons of
Glencro, or of Ardnamurchan?”—Dr. Johnson
gave him a significant look, but made no an∣swer;
and I told Lochbuy that he was not
Johnston, but Johnson, and that he was an Eng∣lishman.</P>
<P>Lochbuy some years ago tried to prove him∣self
a weak man, liable to imposition, or, as
we term it in Scotland, a <HI>facile</HI> man, in order
to set aside a lease which he had granted; but
failed in the attempt. On my mentioning
this circumstance to Dr. Johnson, he seemed
much surprized that such a suit was admitted
by the Scottish law, and observed, that “in
England no man is allowed to <HI>stultify</HI> himself.”</P>
<P>Sir Allan, Lochbuy, and I, had the conver∣sation
chiefly to ourselves to-night: Dr. John∣son,
being extremely weary, went to bed soon
after supper.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>22d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Before Dr. Johnson came to breakfast, Lady
Lochbuy said, “he was a <HI>dungeon</HI> of wit;”
<PB N="429" REF="435"/>
a very common phrase in Scotland to express a
profoundness of intellect, though he afterwards
told me, that he had never heard it. She pro∣posed
that he should have some cold sheep's-head
for breakfast. Sir Allan seemed dis∣pleased
at his sisters vulgarity, and wondered
how such a thought should come into her head.
From a mischievous love of sport, I took the
lady's part; and very gravely said, “I think
it is but fair to give him an offer of it. If he
does not choose it, he may let it alone.”—“I
think so,” said the lady, looking at her brother
with an air of victory. Sir Allan, finding the
matter desperate, strutted about the room, and
took snuff. When Dr. Johnson came in, she
called to him, “Do you choose any cold
sheep's-head, sir?”—“No, MADAM,” said he,
with a tone of surprise and anger.—“It is here,
sir,” said she, supposing he had refused it to
save the trouble of bringing it in. They thus
went on at cross purposes, till he confirmed his
refusal in a manner not to be misunderstood;
while I sat quietly by, and enjoyed my success.</P>
<P>After breakfast, we surveyed the old castle,
in the pit or dungeon of which Lochbuy had
some years before taken upon him to imprison
several persons; and though he had been fined
in a considerable sum by the Court of Justi∣ciary,
he was so little affected by it, that,
while we were examining the dungeon, he said
<PB N="430" REF="436"/>
to me, with a smile, “Your father knows
something of this;” (alluding to my father's
having sat as one of the judges on his trial.)
Sir Allan whispered me, that the laird could
not be persuaded, that he had lost his heri∣table
jurisdiction.</P>
<P>We then set out for the ferry, by which we
were to cross to the main land of Argyleshire.
Lochbuy and Sir Allan accompanied us. We
were told much of a war-saddle, on which this
reputed Don Quixote used to be mounted; but
we did not see it, for the young laird had ap∣plied
it to a less noble purpose, having taken it
to Falkirk fair <HI>with a drove of black cattle.</HI></P>
<P>We bade adieu to Lochbuy, and to our very
kind conductor Sir Allan M'Lean, on the shore
of Mull, and then got into the ferry-boat, the
bottom of which was strewed with branches of
trees or bushes, upon which we sat. We had a
good day, and a fine passage, and in the evening
landed at Oban, where we found a tolerable
inn. After having been so long confined at
different times in islands, from which it was
always uncertain when we could get away, it
was comfortable to be now on the main land,
and to know that, if in health, we might
get to any place in Scotland or England in a
certain number of days.</P>
<P>Here we discovered, from the conjectures
which were formed, that the people on the
<PB N="431" REF="437"/>
main land were entirely ignorant of our mo∣tions;
for in a Glasgow news-paper we found
a paragraph, which, as it contains a just and
well-turned compliment to my illustrious
friend, I shall here insert:</P>
<P>“We are well assured that Doctor Johnson
is confined by tempestuous weather to the
isle of Sky; it being unsafe to venture, in a
small boat, upon such a stormy surge as is
very common there at this time of the year.
Such a philosopher, detained on an almost
barren island, resembles a whale left upon the
strand. The latter will be welcome to every
body, on account of his oil, his bone, &amp;c.
and the other will charm his companions,
and the rude inhabitants, with his superior
knowledge and wisdom, calm resignation,
and unbounded benevolence.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>23d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After a good night's rest, we breakfasted at
our leisure. We talked of Goldsmith's <HI>Traveller,</HI>
of which Dr. Johnson spoke highly; and, while
I was helping him on with his great coat, he
repeated from it the character of the English
nation, which he did with such energy, that
the tear started into his eye.</P>
<P>We could get but one bridle here, which,
according to the maxim <HI>detur digniori,</HI> was ap∣propriated
to Dr. Johnson's sheltie. I and
<PB N="432" REF="438"/>
Joseph rode with halters. We crossed in a
ferry-boat a pretty wide lake, and on the fur∣ther
side of it, close by the shore, found a hut
for our inn. We were much wet. I changed
my clothes in part, and was at pains to get
myself well dried. Dr. Johnson resolutely kept
on all his clothes, wet as they were, letting
them steam before the smoky turf fire. I
thought him in the wrong; but his firmness
was, perhaps, a species of heroism.</P>
<P>I remember but little of our conversation.
I mentioned Shenstone's saying of Pope, that
he had the art of condensing sense more than
any body. Dr. Johnson said, “It is not true,
sir. There is more sense in a line of Cowley
than in a page (or a sentence, or ten lines,—I
am not quite certain of the very phrase) of
Pope.” He maintained, that Archibald, Duke
of Argyle, was a narrow man. I wondered at
this; and observed, that his building so great
a house at Inveraray was not like a narrow
man. “Sir, (said he,) when a narrow man
has resolved to build a house, he builds it like
another man. But Archibald, Duke of Ar∣gyle,
was narrow in his ordinary expences, in
his quotidian expences.”</P>
<P>The distinction is very just. It is in the
ordinary expences of life that a man's liberality
or narrowness is to be discovered.—I never
heard the word <HI>quotidian</HI> in this sense, and I
<PB N="433" REF="439"/>
imagined it to be a word of Dr. Johnson's own
fabrication; but I have since found it in Dr.
Young's <HI>Night Thoughts,</HI> (Night fifth,)
<Q><L>“Death's a destroyer of quotidian prey.”</L></Q>
and in my friend's Dictionary, supported by
the authorities of Charles I. and Dr. Donne.</P>
<P>It rained very hard as we journeyed on after
dinner. The roar of torrents from the moun∣tains,
as we passed along in the dusk, and the
other circumstances attending our ride this
evening, have been mentioned with so much
animation by Dr. Johnson, that I shall not at∣tempt
to say any thing on the subject.</P>
<P>We got at night to Inveraray, where we
found an excellent inn. Even here, Dr. Johnson
would not change his wet clothes.</P>
<P>The prospect of good accommodation
cheered us much. We supped well; and after
supper, Dr. Johnson, whom I had not seen taste
any fermented liquor during all our travels,
called for a gill of whisky. “Come, (said he,)
let me know what it is that makes a Scotsman
happy!” He drank it all but a drop, which I
begged leave to pour into my glass, that I
might say we had drank whisky together. I
proposed Mrs. Thrale should be our toast. He
would not have <HI>her</HI> drunk in whisky, but rather
“some insular lady;” so we drank one of
the ladies whom we had lately left.—He owned
<PB N="434" REF="440"/>
to-night, that he got as good a room and bed
as at an English inn.</P>
<P>I had here the pleasure of finding a letter
from home, which relieved me from the anxiety
I had suffered, in consequence of not having
received any account of my family for many
weeks. I also found a letter from Mr. Gar∣rick,
which was a regale as agreeable as a pine∣apple
would be in a desert. He had favoured
me with his correspondence for many years;
and when Dr. Johnson and I were at Inverness,
I had written to him as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“My dear sir,”</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Inverness,
<DATE>Sunday, 29 August, 1773.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>“HERE I am,” and Mr. Samuel Johnson
actually with me. We were a night at Fores,
in coming to which, in the dusk of the evening,
we passed over the bleak and blasted heath
where Macbeth met the witches. Your old
preceptor repeated, with much solemnity, the
speech—
<Q><L>“How far is't call'd to Fores? What are these,</L>
<L>So wither'd, and so wild in their attire,” &amp;c.</L></Q>
This day we visited the ruins of Macbeth's
castle at Inverness. I have had great roman∣tick
satisfaction in seeing Johnson upon the
classical scenes of Shakspeare in Scotland; which
I really looked upon as almost as improbable as
that “Birnam wood should come to Dunsinane.”
Indeed, as I have always been accustomed to
<PB N="435" REF="441"/>
view him as a permanent London object, it
would not be much more wonderful to me to
see St. Paul's church moving along where we
now are. As yet we have travelled in post∣chaises;
but to-morrow we are to mount on
horseback, and ascend into the mountains by
Fort Augustus, and so on to the ferry, where
we are to cross to Sky. We shall see that
Island fully, and then visit some more of the
Hebrides; after which we are to land in Ar∣gyleshire,
proceed by Glasgow to Auchinleck,
repose there a competent time, and then re∣turn
to Edinburgh, from whence the Rambler
will depart for old England again, as soon as
he finds it convenient. Hitherto, we have had

as it is, it must remain so till I see you again,

<P>“Your friend—threatens me much.”
I only wish that he would put his threats in

for some copies of his—, which I sub∣scribed
for, and that I desired him to call
again.—The truth is, that my wife was not at
home, and that for weeks together I have not
ten shillings in my pocket.—However, had it
been otherwise, it was not so great a crime to
draw his poetical vengeance upon me.—I de∣spise
all that he can do, and am glad that I can
so easily get rid of him and his ingratitude.—I

<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>24th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We passed the forenoon calmly and placidly.
I prevailed on Dr. Johnson to read aloud
Ogden's sixth Sermon on Prayer, which he did
with a distinct expression, and pleasing solem∣nity.
He praised my favourite preacher, his
elegant language and remarkable acuteness;
and said, he fought infidels with their own
weapons.</P>
<P>As a specimen of Ogden's manner, I insert the
following passage from the sermon which Dr.
Johnson now read. The preacher, after arguing
against that vain philosophy which main∣tains,
in conformity with the hard principle of
eternal necessity, or unchangeable predetermi∣nation,
that the only effect of prayer for others,
<PB N="439" REF="445"/>
although we are exhorted to pray for them, is to
produce good dispositions in ourselves towards
them; thus expresses himself:</P>
<P>“A plain man might be apt to ask, But if
this then, though enjoined in the holy scrip∣tures,
is to be my real aim and intention,
when I am taught to pray for other persons,
why is it that I do not plainly so express it?
Why is not the form of the petition brought
nearer to the meaning? Give them, say I to
our heavenly father, what is good. But
this, I am to understand, will be as it will
be, and is not for me to alter. What is it
then that I am doing? I am desiring to be∣come
charitable myself; and why may I not
plainly say so? Is there shame in it, or im∣piety?
The wish is laudable: why should I
form designs to hide it?”</P>
<P>“Or is it, perhaps, better to be brought
about by indirect means, and in this artful
manner? Alas! who is it that I would im∣pose
on? From whom can it be, in this
commerce, that I desire to hide any thing?
When, as my saviour commands me, I have
<HI>entered into my closet, and shut my door,</HI> there
are but two parties privy to my devotions,
GOD and my own heart; which of the two
am I deceiving?”</P>
<P>He wished to have more books, and, upon in∣quiring
if there were any in the house, was told
<PB N="440" REF="446"/>
that a waiter had some, which were brought
to him; but I recollect none of them,
except Hervey's <HI>Meditations.</HI> He thought
frightingly of this admired book. He treated
it with ridicule, and would not allow even the
scene of the dying Husband and Father to
be pathetick. I am not an impartial judge;
for Hervey's <HI>Meditations</HI> engaged my affec∣tions
in my early years.—He read a passage
concerning the moon, ludicrously, and shewed
how easily he could, in the same style, make
reflections on that planet, the very reverse of
Hervey's, representing her as treacherous to
mankind. He did this with much humour;
but I have not preserved the particulars. He
then indulged a playful fancy, in making a
<HI>Meditation on a pudding,</HI> of which I hastily
wrote down, in his presence, the following
note; which, though imperfect, may serve to
give my readers some idea of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MEDITATION ON A PUDDING.</HEAD>
<P>“LET us seriously reflect of what a pudding
is composed. It is composed of flour that once
waved in the golden grain, and drank the dews
of the morning; of milk pressed from the
swelling udder by the gentle hand of the beau∣teous
milk-maid, whose beauty and innocence
might have recommended a worse draught;
who, while she stroked the udder, indulged no
<PB N="441" REF="447"/>
ambitious thoughts of wandering in palaces,
formed no plans for the destruction of her
fellow-creatures: milk, which is drawn from
the cow, that useful animal, that eats the
grass of the field, and supplies us with that
which made the greatest part of the food of
mankind in the age which the poets have
agreed to call golden. It is made with an egg,
that miracle of nature, which the theoretical
Burnet has compared to creation. An egg
contains water within its beautiful smooth sur∣face;
and an unformed mass, by the incubation
of the parent, becomes a regular animal, fur∣nished
with bones and sinews, and covered with
feathers.—Let us consider; can there be more
wanting to complete the Meditation on a Pud∣ding?
If more is wanting, more may be found.
It contains salt, which keeps the sea from pu∣trefaction:
salt, which is made the image of
intellectual excellence, contributes to the for∣mation
of a pudding.”</P>
<P>In a magazine I found a saying of Dr.
Johnson's, something to this purpose; that the
happiest part of a man's life is what he passes
lying awake in bed in the morning. I read it
to him. He said, “I may, perhaps, have
said this; for nobody, at times, talks more
laxly than I do.” I ventured to suggest to
him, that this was dangerous from one of his
authority.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="448"/>
I spoke of living in the country, and upon
what footing one should be with neighbours. I
observed that some people were afraid of being
on too easy a footing with them, from an ap∣prehension
that their time would not be their
own. He made the obvious remark, that it de∣pended
much on what kind of neighbours one
has, whether it was desireable to be on an easy
footing with them, or not. I mentioned a
certain baronet, who told me, he never was
happy in the country, till he was not on speak∣ing
terms with his neighbours, which he con∣trived
in different ways to bring about.
“Lord—(said he) stuck long;
but at last the fellow pounded my pigs, and
then I got rid of him.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Nay, sir,
My Lord got rid of Sir John, and shewed how
little he valued him, by putting his pigs in
the pound.”</P>
<P>I told Dr. Johnson I was in some difficulty
how to act at Inveraray. I had reason to think
that the Duchess of Argyle disliked me, on ac∣count
of my zeal in the Douglas cause; but the
Duke of Argyle had always been pleased to
treat me with great civility. They were now
at the castle, which is a very short walk from
our inn; and the question was, whether I should
go and pay my respects there? Dr. Johnson,
to whom I had stated the case, was clear
that I ought; but, in his usual way, he was
<PB N="443" REF="449"/>
very shy of discovering a desire to be invited
there himself. Though, from a conviction of the
benefit of subordination to society, he has always
shewn great respect to persons of high rank,
when he happened to be in their company, yet
his pride of character has ever made him guard
against any appearance of courting the great.
Besides, he was impatient to get to Glasgow,
where he expected letters. At the same time
he was, I believe, secretly not unwilling to
have attention paid him by so great a Chieftain,
and so exalted a nobleman. He insisted I
should not go to the castle this day before din∣ner,
as it would look like seeking an invitation.
“But, said I, if the duke invites us to dine
with him to-morrow, shall we accept?”—
“Yes, sir,” I think he said, “ to be sure.”
But, he added, “He won't ask us!”—I men∣tioned,
that I was afraid my company might be
disagreeable to the duchess. He treated this
objection with a manly disdain: “ <HI>That,</HI>
sir, he must settle with his wife.”—We
dined well. I went to the castle just about the
time when I supposed the ladies would be retired
from dinner. I sent in my name; and, being
shewn in, found the amiable duke sitting at the
head of his table with several gentlemen. I was
most politely received, and gave his grace some
particulars of the curious journey which I had
been making with Dr. Johnson. When we rose
<PB N="444" REF="450"/>
from table, the duke said to me, “I hope you
and Dr. Johnson will dine with us to-morrow.”
I thanked his grace; but told him, my friend
was in a great hurry to get back to London,
The duke, with a kind complacency, said,
“ He will stay one day; and I will take care
he shall see this place to advantage.” I said, I
should be sure to let him know his grace's in∣vitation.
—As I was going away, the duke said,
“ Mr. Boswell, won't you have some tea?”—I
thought it best to get over the meeting with
the duchess this night; so respectfully agreed.
I was conducted to the drawing-room by the
duke, who announced my name; but the
duchess, who was sitting with her daughter,
Lady Betty Hamilton, and some other ladies,
took not the least notice of me. I should have
been mortified at being thus coldly re∣ceived
by a lady of whom I, with the rest of
the world, have always entertained a very high
admiration, had I not been consoled by the
obliging attention of the duke.</P>
<P>When I returned to the inn, I informed Dr.
Johnson of the Duke of Argyle's invitation,
with which he was much pleased, and readily
accepted of it.—We talked of a violent contest
which was then carrying on, with a view to the
next general election for Ayrshire; where one
of the candidates, in order to undermine the
old and established interest, had artfully held
<PB N="445" REF="451"/>
himself out as a champion for the independency
of the county against aristocratick influence,
and had persuaded several gentlemen into a re∣solution
to oppose every candidate who was
supported by peers.—“Foolish fellows! (said
Dr. Johnson,) don't they see that they are as
much dependent upon the peers one way as the
other. The peers have but to <HI>oppose</HI> a candi∣date,
to ensure him success. It is said, the
only way to make a pig go forward, is to pull
him back by the tail. These people must be
treated like pigs.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>25th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>My acquaintance, the Reverend Mr. John
M'Aulay, one of the ministers of Inveraray,
and brother to our good friend at Calder, came
to us this morning, and accompanied us to the
castle, where I presented Dr. Johnson to the
Duke of Argyle. We were shewn through the
house; and I never shall forget the impression
made upon my fancy by some of the ladies'
maids tripping about in neat morning dresses.
After seeing for a long time little but rusti∣city,
their lively manner, and gay inviting ap∣pearance,
pleased me so much, that I thought,
for the moment, I could have been a knight∣errant
for them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On reflection, at the distance of several years, I wonder that my venerable fellow-traveller should have read this passage without censuring my levity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="452"/>
We then got into a low one-horse chair,
ordered for us by the duke, in which we drove
about the place. Dr. Johnson was much
struck by the grandeur and elegance of this
princely seat. He said, “What I admire
here, is the total defiance of expence.” I had
a particular pride in shewing him a great num∣ber
of fine old trees, to compensate for the
nakedness which had made such an impression
on him on the eastern coast of Scotland.—He
thought the castle too low, and wished it had
been a story higher.</P>
<P>When we came in, before dinner, we found
the duke and some gentlemen in the hall. Dr.
Johnson took much notice of the large col∣lection
of arms, which are excellently disposed
there. I told what he had said to Sir Alex∣ander
M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, of his ancestors not suffering
their arms to rust. “Well, (said the doctor,)
but let us be glad we live in times when arms
<HI>may</HI> rust. We can sit to-day at his grace's
table, without any risk of being attacked, and
perhaps sitting down again wounded or
maimed.” The duke placed Dr. Johnson next
himself at table. I was in fine spirits; and
though sensible that I had the misfortune of not
being in favour with the duchess, I was not in
the least disconcerted, and offered her grace
some of the dish that was before me. It must
be owned that I was in the right to be quite
<PB N="447" REF="453"/>
unconcerned, if I could. I was the Duke of
Argyle's guest; and I had no reason to suppose
that he adopted the prejudices and resentments
of the Duchess of Hamilton.</P>
<P>I knew it was not the rule of modern high
life to drink to any body; but, that I might
have the satisfaction for once to look the
duchess in the face, with a glass in my hand, I
with a respectful air addressed her,—“My
Lady Duchess, I have the honour to drink
your grace's good health.”—I repeated the
words audibly, and with a steady countenance.
This was, perhaps, rather too much; but
some allowance must be made for human
feelings.</P>
<P>The duchess was very attentive to Dr. John∣son,
I know not how a <HI>middle state</HI> came to be
mentioned. Her grace wished to hear him on
that point. “Madam, (said he,) your own rela∣tion,
Mr. Archibald Campbell, can tell you
better about it than I can. He was a bishop of
the nonjuring communion, and wrote a book
upon the subject.”—He engaged to get it for
her grace. He afterwards gave a full history
of Mr. Archibald Campbell, which I am sorry
I do not recollect particularly. He said, Mr.
Campbell had been bred a violent Whig, but
afterwards, “kept <HI>better company,</HI> and became
a Tory.” He said this with a smile, in pleasant
allusion, as I thought, to the opposition between
<PB N="448" REF="454"/>
his own political principles and those of the
duke's clan. He added, that Mr. Campbell,
after the Revolution, was thrown into jail on
account of his tenets; but, on application by
letter to the old Lord Townshend, was released:
that he always spoke of his lordship with great
gratitude, saying, “though <HI>a Whig</HI> he had
humanity.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson and I passed some time together,
in June 1784, at Pembroke college, Oxford,
with the Reverend Dr. Adams, the master;
and I having expressed a regret that my note
relative to Mr. Archibald Campbell was imper∣fect,
he was then so good as to write with his
own hand, on the blank page of my Journal
opposite to that which contained what I have
now mentioned, the following paragraph;
which, however, is not quite so full as the
narrative he gave at Inveraray:</P>
<P>“ The Honourable Archibald Campbell was, I
believe, the nephew of the Marquis of Argyle.
He began life by engaging in Monmouth's rebellion,
and, to escape the law, lived some time in Surinam.
When be returned, he became zealous for episco∣pacy
and monarchy; and at the Revolution adhered
not only to the Nonjurors, but to those who refused
to communicate with the Church of England, or to
be present at any worship where the usurper was
mentioned as king. He was, I believe, more than
once apprehended in the reign of King William,
<PB N="449" REF="455"/>
and once at the accession of George. He was the
familiar friend of Hickes and Nelson; a man of
letters, but injudicious; and very curious and in∣quisitive,
but credulous. He lived in 1743, or 44,
about 75 years old.”</P>
<P>The subject of luxury was introduced. Dr.
Johnson defended it. “ We have now (said he,)
a splendid dinner before us; Which of all these
dishes is unwholesome?” The duke asserted,
that he had observed the grandees of Spain
diminished in their size by luxury. Dr. John∣son
politely refrained from opposing directly an
observation which the duke himself had made;
but said, “Man must be very different from
other animals, if he is diminished by good
living; for the size of all other animals is in∣creased
by it.” I made some remark that seemed
to imply a belief in <HI>second sight.</HI> The duchess
said, “I fancy you will be a <HI>Methodist.”</HI>—This
was the only sentence her grace deigned to utter
to me; and I take it for granted, she thought it
a good hit on my <HI>credulity</HI> in the Douglas cause.</P>
<P>A gentleman in company, after dinner, was
desired by the duke to go to another room, for
a specimen of curious marble, which his grace
wished to shew us. He brought a wrong
piece, upon which the duke sent him back
again. He could not refuse; but, to avoid any
appearance of servility, he whistled as he
<PB N="450" REF="456"/>
walked out of the room, to show his indepen∣dency.
On my mentioning this afterwards to
Dr. Johnson, he said, it was a nice trait of
character.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson talked a great deal, and was
so entertaining, that Lady Betty Hamilton,
after dinner, went and placed her chair close to
his, leaned upon the back of it, and listened
eagerly. It would have made a fine picture to
have drawn the Sage and her at this time in
their several attitudes. He did not know, all
the while, how much he was honoured. I told
him afterwards. I never saw him so gentle and
complaisant as this day.</P>
<P>We went to tea. The duke and I walked up
and down the drawing-room, conversing. The
duchess still continued to shew the same marked
coldness for me; for which, though I suffered
from it, I made every allowance, considering
the very warm part that I had taken for Doug∣las,
in the cause in which she thought her son so
deeply interested. Had not her grace discovered
some displeasure towards me, I should have sus∣pected
her of insensibility or dissimulation.</P>
<P>Her grace made Dr. Johnson come and sit by
her, and asked him why he made his journey
so late in the year. “Why, madam, (said he,)
you know Mr. Boswell must attend the Court of
Session, and it does not rise till the twelfth of
August.”—She said, with some sharpness, “ I
<PB N="451" REF="457"/>
<HI>know nothing</HI> of Mr. Boswell.” Poor Lady
Lucy Douglas, to whom I mentioned this,
observed, “She knew <HI>too much</HI> of Mr. Boswell.”
I shall make no remark on her grace's speech.
I indeed felt it as rather too severe; but when
I recollected that my punishment was inflicted
by so dignified a beauty, I had that kind of
consolation which a man would feel who is
strangled by a <HI>silken cord.</HI> Dr. Johnson was all
attention to her grace. He used afterwards a
droll expression, upon her enjoying the three
titles of Hamilton, Brandon, and Argyle. Bor∣rowing
an image from the Turkish empire, he
called her a <HI>Duchess</HI> with <HI>three tails.</HI></P>
<P>He was much pleased with our visit at the
castle of Inveraray. The Duke of Argyle was
exceedingly polite to him, and, upon his com∣plaining
of the shelties which he had hitherto
ridden being too small for him, his grace told
him he should be provided with a good horse to
carry him next day.</P>
<P>Mr. John M'Aulay passed the evening with
us at out inn. When Dr. Johnson spoke of
people whose principles were good, but whose
practice was faulty, Mr. M'Aulay said, he had
no notion of people being in earnest in their
good professions, whose practice was not suit∣able,
The Doctor grew warm, and said,
“ Sir, are you so grossly ignorant of human
nature, as not to know that a man may be very
sincere in good principles, without having good
practice?”</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="458"/>
Dr. Johnson was unquestionably in the right;
and whoever examines himself candidly, will be
satisfied of it, though the inconsistency between
principles and practice is greater in some men
than in others.</P>
<P>I recollect very little of this night's conversa∣tion.
I am sorry that indolence came upon me
towards the conclusion of our journey, so that
I did not write down what passed with the same
assiduity as during the greatest part of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>26th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. M'Aulay breakfasted with us, nothing
hurt or dismayed by his last night's correction.
Being a man of good sense, he had a just ad∣miration
of Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>Either yesterday morning, or this, I commu∣nicated
to Dr. Johnson, from Mr. M'Aulay's
information, the news that Dr. Beattie had got
a pension of two hundred pounds a year. He
sat up in his bed, clapped his hands, and cried,
“ O brave we!”—a peculiar exclamation of his
when he rejoices.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having mentioned, more than once, that my Journal was perused by Dr. Johnson, I think it proper to inform my readers that this is the last paragraph which he read.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As we sat over our tea, Mr. Home's Tragedy
of <HI>Douglas</HI> was mentioned. I put Dr. Johnson
in mind, that once, in a coffee-house at Oxford,
he called to old Mr. Sheridan, “ How came
you, sir, to give Home a gold medal for writing
that foolish play?” and defied Mr. Sheridan to
<PB N="453" REF="459"/>
shew ten good lines in it. He did not insist
they should be together; but that there were
not ten good lines in the whole play. He now
persisted in this. I endeavoured to defend that
pathetick and beautiful tragedy, and repeated
the following passage:
<Q><L>—“Sincerity,</L>
<L>Thou first of virtues! let no mortal leave</L>
<L>Thy onward path, although the earth should gape,</L>
<L>And from the gulph of hell destruction cry,</L>
<L>To take dissimulation's winding way.”</L></Q>
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “That will not do, sir. Nothing is
good but what is consistent with truth or pro∣bability,
which this is not. Juvenal, indeed,
gives us a noble picture of inflexible virtue:”
<Q><L>“Esto bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem</L>
<L>Integer: ambiguae si quando citabere testis,</L>
<L>Incertaeque rei, Phalaris licet imperet, ut sis</L>
<L>Falsus, et admoto dictet perjuria tauro,</L>
<L>Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,</L>
<L>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.”</L></Q></P>
<P>He repeated the lines with great force and
dignity; then added, “And, after this, comes
Johnny Home, with his <HI>earth gaping,</HI> and his
<HI>destruction crying:</HI>—Pooh!”</P>
<P>While we were lamenting the number of
ruined religious buildings which we had lately
seen, I spoke with peculiar feeling of the mi∣serable
neglect of the chapel belonging to the
palace of Holyrood house, in which are depo∣sited
the remains of many of the Kings of Scot∣land,
<PB N="454" REF="460"/>
and of many of our nobility. I said, it was
a disgrace to the country that it was not re∣paired;
and particularly complained that my
friend Douglas, the representative of a great
house, and proprietor of a vast estate, should
suffer the sacred spot where his mother lies in∣terred,
to be unroofed, and exposed to all the
inclemencies of the weather. Dr. Johnson,
who, I know not how, had formed an opinion
on the Hamilton side, in the Douglas cause, slily
answered, “Sir, sir, don't be too severe upon
the gentleman; don't accuse him of want of
filial piety! Lady Jane Douglas was not <HI>his</HI>
mother.”—He roused my zeal so much,
that I took the liberty to tell him he knew no∣thing
of the cause; which I do most seriously
believe was the case.</P>
<P>We were now “in a country of bridles and
saddles,” and set out fully equipped. The
Duke of Argyle was obliging enough to mount
Dr. Johnson on a stately steed from his grace's
stable. My friend was highly pleased, and
Joseph said, “He now looks like a bishop.”</P>
<P>We dined at the inn at Tarbat, and at night
came to Rosedow, the beautiful seat of Sir James
Colquhoun, on the banks of Lochlomond,
where I, and any friends whom I have intro∣duced,
have ever been received with kind and
elegant hospitality.</P>

<P>When I went into Dr. Johnson's room this

courteous he had been at Inveraray, and said,
“You was quite a fine gentleman, when with
the duchess.” He answered, in good humour,
“Sir, I look upon myself as a very polite
man:” and he was right, in a proper manly
sense of the word. As an immediate proof of
it, let me observe, that he would not send back

The duke was so attentive to his respectable
guest, that on the same day, he wrote him an
answer, which was received at Auchinleck:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Dr. JOHNSON, Auchinleck, Ayrshire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Sir,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I am glad to hear your journey from
this place was not unpleasant,” in regard to your
horse. I wish I could have supplied you with
good weather, which I am afraid you felt the
want of.</P>
<P>“The Duchess of Argyle desires her compli∣ments
to you,” and is much obliged to you for
remembering her commission. I am, sir,</P>
<CLOSER>“Your most obedient humble servant,
<SIGNED>ARGYLE.”</SIGNED>

</LETTER>
<P>I am happy to insert every memorial of the
honour done to my great friend. Indeed, I
was at all times desirous to preserve the letters
which he received from eminent persons, of
which, as of all other papers, he was very neg∣ligent;
and once proposed to him, that they
should be committed to my care, as his <HI>Custos
Rotulorum.</HI> I wish he had complied with my
request, as by that means many valuable writ∣ings
might have been preserved, that are now
lost<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As a remarkable instance of his negligence, I remember some years ago to have found lying loose in his study, and without the cover which contained the address, a letter to him from Lord Thurlow, to whom he had made an application, as Chancellor, in behalf of a poor literary friend. It was ex∣pressed in such terms of respect for Dr. Johnson, that, in my zeal for his reputation. I remonstrated warmly with him on his strange in attention, and obtained his permission to take a copy of it; by which it has probably been preserved, as the original I have reason to suppose is lost.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="463"/>
After breakfast, Dr. Johnson and I were
furnished with a boat, and sailed about upon
Lochlomond, and landed on some of the islands
which are interspersed. He was much pleased
with the scene, which is so well known by the
accounts of various travellers, that it is unne∣cessary
for me to attempt any description of it.</P>
<P>I recollect none of his conversation, except
that, when talking of dress, he said, “Sir, were
I to have any thing fine, it should be very fine.
Were I to wear a ring, it should not be a
bauble, but a stone of great value. Were I to
wear a laced or embroidered waistcoat, it
should be very rich. I had once a very rich
laced waistcoat, which I wore the first night of
my tragedy.”</P>
<P>Lady Helen Colquhoun being a very pious
woman, the conversation, after dinner, took a
religious turn. Her ladyship defended the
presbyterian mode of publick worship; upon
which Dr. Johnson delivered those excellent
arguments for a form of prayer which he has
introduced into his “Journey.” I am myself
fully convinced that a form of prayer for pub∣lick
<PB N="458" REF="464"/>
worship is in general most decent and
edifying. <HI>Solennia verba</HI> have a kind of pre∣scriptive
sanctity, and make a deeper impres∣sion
on the mind than extemporaneous effu∣sions,
in which, as we not know what they are
to be, we cannot readily acquiesce. Yet I
would allow also of a certain portion of extem∣pore
address, as occasion may require. This is
the practice of the French Protestant churches.
And although the office of forming supplica∣tions
to the throne of heaven is, in my mind,
too great a trust to be indiscriminately com∣mitted
to the discretion of every minister, I do
not mean to deny, that sincere devotion may
be experienced when joining in prayer with
those who use no Liturgy.</P>
<P>We were favoured with Sir James Colqu∣houn's
coach to convey us in the evening to
Cameron, the seat of Commissary Smollet.
Our satisfaction at finding ourselves again in a
comfortable carriage was very great. We had
a pleasing conviction of the commodiousness of
civilization, and heartily laughed at the
ravings of those absurd visionaries who have
attempted to persuade us of the superior ad∣vantages
of a <HI>state of nature.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Smollet was a man of considerable
learning, with abundance of animal spirits; so
that he was a very good companion for Dr.
Johnson, who said to me, “We have had
<PB N="459" REF="465"/>
more solid talk here than at any place where
we have been.”</P>
<P>I remember Dr. Johnson gave us this even∣ing
an able and eloquent discourse on the
<HI>Origin of Evil,</HI> and on the consistency of moral
evil with the power and goodness of GOD. He
shewed us how it arose from our free agency,
an extinction of which would be a still greater
evil than any we experience. I know not that
he said any thing absolutely new, but he said a
great deal wonderfully well; and perceiving us
to be delighted and satisfied, he concluded his
harangue with an air of benevolent triumph
over an objection which has distressed many
worthy minds: “This then is the answer to
the question, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>?”—Mrs. Smollet
whispered me, that it was the best sermon she
had ever heard. Much do I upbraid myself
for having neglected to preserve it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>28th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Smollet pleased Dr. Johnson, by pro∣ducing
a collection of news-papers in the time
of the Usurpation, from which it appeared that
all sorts of crimes were very frequent during that
horrible anarchy. By the side of the high road
to Glasgow, at some distance from his house,
he had erected a pillar to the memory of his
ingenious kinsman, Dr. Smollet; and he con∣sulted
Dr. Johnson as to an inscription for it.
<PB N="460" REF="466"/>
Lord Kames, who, though he had a great store
of knowledge, with much ingenuity, and un∣common
activity of mind, was no profound
scholar, had it seems recommended an English
inscription. Dr. Johnson treated this with
great contempt, saying, “An English inscrip∣tion
would be a disgrace to Dr. Smollet,” and,
in answer to what Lord Kames had urged, as
to the advantage of its being in English, be∣cause
it would be generally understood, I ob∣served,
that all to whom Dr. Smollet's merit
could be an object of respect and imitation,
would understand it as well in Latin; and that
surely it was not meant for the Highland dro∣vers,
or other such people, who pass and repass
that way.</P>
<P>We were then shewn a Latin inscription,
proposed for this monument. Dr. Johnson sat
down with an ardent and liberal earnestness to
revise it, and made such additions and variations
as to form it almost entirely anew. I unfortu∣nately
did not take a copy of it, as it originally
stood; but I have happily preserved every frag∣ment
of what Dr. Johnson wrote:
<Q><L>Quisquis ades, viator,</L>
<L>Vel mente felix, vel studiis cultus,</L>
<L>Immorare paululum memoriae</L>
<L>TOBIAE SMOLLET, M. D.</L>

<P>We had this morning a singular proof of Dr.
Johnson's quick and retentive memory. Hay's
translation of Martial was lying in a window. I
said, I thought it was pretty well done, and
shewed him a particular epigram of, I think
ten, but am certain of eight, lines. He read
it, and tossed away the book, saying—“No,
it is <HI>not</HI> pretty well.” As I persisted in my
opinion, he said, “Why, sir,” the original is
thus,—(and he repeated it;) and this man's
translation is thus:—and then he repeated that
also, exactly, though he had never seen it be∣fore,
and read it over only once, and that too,
without any intention of getting it by heart.</P>
<P>Here a post-chaise, which I had ordered
from Glasgow, came for us, and we drove on
in high spirits. We stopped at Dunbarton,
and though the approach to the castle there is
very steep, Dr. Johnson ascended it with ala∣crity,
<PB N="462" REF="468"/>
and surveyed all that was to be seen.
During the whole of our Tour he shewed un∣common
spirit, could not bear to be treated
like an old or infirm man, and was very un∣willing
to accept of any assistance, insomuch
that, at our landing on Icolmkill, when Sir
Allan M'Lean and I submitted to be carried
on men's shoulders from the boat to the shore,
as it could not be brought quite close to land,
he sprang into the sea, and waded vigorously
out.</P>
<P>On our arrival at the Saracen's Head Inn, at
Glasgow, I was made happy by good accounts
from home; and Dr. Johnson, who had not
received a single letter since we left Aberdeen,
found here a great many, the perusal of which
entertained him much. He enjoyed in ima∣gination
the comforts which we could now
command, and seemed to be in high glee. I
remember he put a leg up on each side of the
grate, and said, with a mock solemnity, by
way of soliloquy, but loud enough for me to
hear it, “Here am I, an ENGLISH man,
sitting by a <HI>coal</HI> fire!”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>29th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The professors of the university being in∣formed
of our arrival, Dr. Stevenson, Dr.
Reid, and Mr. Anderson, breakfasted with us.
Mr. Anderson accompanied us while Dr. Johnson
<PB N="463" REF="469"/>
Johnson viewed this beautiful city. He had
told me, that one day in London, when Dr.
Adam Smith was boasting of it, he turned to
him and said, “Pray sir, have you ever seen
Brentford?”—This was surely a strong instance
of his impatience, and spirit of contradiction.
I put him in mind of it to-day, while he ex∣pressed
his admiration of the elegant buildings,
and whispered him, “Don't you feel some re∣morse?”</P>
<P>We were received in the college by a num∣ber
of the professors, who shewed all due
respect to Dr. Johnson; and then we paid a
visit to the principal, Dr. Leechman, at his
own house, where Dr. Johnson had the satis∣faction
of being told that his name had been
gratefully celebrated in one of the parochial
congregations in the Highlands, as the person
to whose influence it was chiefly owing, that
the New Testament was allowed to be translated
into the Erse language. It seems some politi∣cal
members of the Society in Scotland for
propagating Christian knowledge, had opposed
this pious undertaking, as tending to preserve
the distinction between the Highlanders and
Lowlanders. Dr. Johnson wrote a long letter
upon the subject to a friend, which being
shewn to them, made them ashamed, and
afraid of being publickly exposed; so they
were forced to a compliance. It is now in my
<PB N="464" REF="470"/>
possession, and is perhaps, one of the best pro∣ductions
of his masterly pen.</P>
<P>Professors Reid and Anderson, and the two
Messieurs Foulis, the Elzevirs of Glasgow,
dined and drank tea with us at our inn, after
which the professors went away; and I, having
a letter to write, left my fellow-traveller with
Messieurs Foulis. Though good and ingenious
men, they had that unsettled speculative mode
of conversation which is offensive to a man
regularly taught at an English school and
university. I found that, instead of listening to
the dictates of the Sage, they had teized him
with questions and doubtful disputations. He
came in a flutter to me, and desired I might come
back again, for he could not bear these men.
“O ho! sir, (said I,) you are flying to me for
refuge!” He never, in any situation, was at
a loss for a ready repartee. He answered, with
quick vivacity, “It is of two evils choosing
the least.” I was delighted with this flash
bursting from the cloud which hung upon his
mind, closed my letter directly, and joined
the company.</P>
<P>We supped at professor Anderson's. The
general impression upon my memory is, that
we had not much conversation at Glasgow,
where the professors, like their bretheren at
Aberdeen, did not venture to expose them∣selves
much to the battery of cannon which
<PB N="465" REF="471"/>
they knew might play upon them. Dr. John∣son,
who was fully conscious of his own supe∣rior
powers, afterwards praised Principal
Robertson for his caution in this respect. He
said to me, “Robertson, sir, was in the right.
Robertson is a man of eminence, and the head
of a college at Edinburgh. He had a cha∣racter
to maintain, and did well not to risk its
being lessened.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>30th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We set out towards Ayrshire. I sent Joseph
on to <HI>Loudoun,</HI> with a message, that, if the earl
was at home; Dr. Johnson and I would have
the honour to dine with him. Joseph met us
on the road, and reported that the earl “<HI>jumped
for joy,</HI>” and said, “I shall be very happy
to see them.”—We were received with a most
pleasing courtesy by his lordship, and by the
countess his mother, who, in her ninety-fifth
year, had all her faculties quite unimpaired.
This was a very cheering sight to Dr. Johnson,
who had an extraordinary desire for long life.
Her ladyship was sensible and well-informed,
and had seen a great deal of the world. Her
lord had held several high offices, and she was
sister to the great Earl of Stair.</P>
<P>I cannot here refrain from paying a just tri∣bute
to the character of John Earl of Loudoun,
who did more service to the county of Ayr in
<PB N="466" REF="472"/>
general, as well as to individuals in it, than any
man we have ever had. It is painful to think
that he met with much ingratitude from per∣sons
both in high and low rank: but such was
his temper, such his knowledge of “base man∣kind
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The unwilling gratitude of base mankind. POPE.</NOTE>,” that, as if he had expected no other
return, his mind was never soured, and he
retained his good-humour and benevolence to
the last. The tenderness of his heart was
proved in 1745-6, when he had an important
command in the Highlands, and behaved with
a generous humanity to the unfortunate. I
cannot figure a more honest politician; for,
though his interest in our county was great,
and had been generally successful, he not only
did not deceive by fallacious promises, but was
anxious that people should not deceive them∣selves
by too sanguine expectations. His kind
and dutiful attention to his mother was unre∣mitted.
At his house was true hospitality; a
plain but a plentiful table; and every guest,
being left at perfect freedom, felt himself quite
easy and happy. While I live, I shall honour
the memory of this amiable man.</P>
<P>At night, we advanced a few miles farther,
to the house of Mr. Campbell of Treesbank,
who was married to one of my wife's sisters, and
were entertained very agreeably by a worthy
couple.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="467" REF="473"/>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>31st October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We reposed here in tranquillity. Dr. John∣son
was pleased to find a numerous and excel∣lent
collection of books, which had mostly
belonged to the Reverend Mr. John Campbell,
brother of our host. I was desirous to have
procured for my fellow-traveller, to-day, the
company of Sir John Cuninghame, of Capring∣ton,
whose castle was but two miles from us.
He was a very distinguished scholar, was long
abroad, and part of the time lived much with
the learned Cuninghame, the opponent of Bent∣ley
as a critick upon Horace. He wrote Latin
with great elegance, and, what is very remark∣able,
read Homer and Ariosto through, every
year. I wrote to him, to request he would
come to us; but unfortunately he was pre∣vented
by indisposition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>1st November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Though Dr. Johnson was lazy, and averse to
move, I insisted that he should go with me, and
pay a visit to the Countess of Eglintoune, mo∣ther
of the late and present earl. I assured
him, he would find himself amply recompensed
for the trouble; and he yielded to my solicita∣tions,
though with some unwillingness. We
were well mounted, and had not many miles
to ride. He talked of the attention that is
<PB N="468" REF="474"/>
necessary in order to distribute our charity
judiciously. “If thoughtlessly done, we may
neglect the most deserving objects; and, as
every man has but a certain proportion to give,
if it is lavished upon those who first present
themselves, there may be nothing left for such
as have a better claim. A man should first
relieve those who are nearly connected with
him, by whatever tie; and then, if he has any
thing to spare, may extend his bounty to a
wider circle.”</P>
<P>As we passed very near the castle of Dun∣donald,
which was one of the many residencies
of the kings of Scotland, and in which,
Robert the Third was born, Dr. Johnson
wished to survey it particularly. It stands on
a beautiful rising ground, which is seen at a
great distance on several quarters, and from
whence there is an extensive prospect of the
rich district of Cuninghame, the western sea,
and the Isle of Arran. It has long been un∣roofed;
and, though of considerable size, we
could not, by any power of imagination,
figure it as having been a suitable habitation
for majesty. Dr. Johnson, to irritate my <HI>old
Scottish</HI> enthusiasm, was very jocular on the
homely accommodation of “King <HI>Bob,</HI>” and
roared and laughed till the ruins echoed.</P>
<P>Lady Eglintoune, though she was now in
her eighty-fifth year, and had lived in the
<PB N="469" REF="475"/>
retirement of the country for almost half a
century, was still a very agreeable woman.
She was of the noble house of Kennedy, and
had all the elevation which the consciousness of
such birth inspires. Her figure was majestick,
her manners high-bred, her reading extensive,
and her conversation elegant. She had been
the admiration of the gay circles of life, and
the patroness of poets. Dr. Johnson was de∣lighted
with his reception here. Her princi∣ples
in church and state were congenial with
his. She knew all his merit, and had heard
much of him from her son, Earl Alexander,
who loved to cultivate the acquaintance of
men of talents, in every department.</P>
<P>All who knew his lordship, will allow that
his understanding and accomplishments were of
no ordinary rate. From the gay habits which
he had early acquired, he spent too much of his
time with men, and in pursuits, far beneath
such a mind as his. He afterwards became
sensible of it, and turned his thoughts to
objects of importance; but was cut off in the
prime of his life. I cannot speak, but with
emotions of the most affectionate regret, of one,
in whose company many of my early days
were passed, and to whose kindness I was
much indebted.</P>
<P>Often must I have occasion to upbraid my∣self,
that, soon after our return to the main
<PB N="470" REF="476"/>
land, I allowed indolence to prevail over me so
much, as to shrink from the labour of conti∣nuing
my Journal with the same minuteness as
before; sheltering myself in the thought, that
we had done with the <HI>Hebrides;</HI> and not consi∣dering,
that Dr. Johnson's <HI>Memorabilia</HI> were
likely to be the more valuable when we were
restored to a more polished society. Much
has thus been irrecoverably lost.</P>
<P>In the course of our conversation this day, it
came out, that Lady Eglintoune was married
the year before Dr. Johnson was born; upon
which she graciously said to him, that she
might have been his mother, and that she now
adopted him; and when we were going away,
she embraced him, saying, “My dear son,
farewell!”—My friend was much pleased with
this day's entertainment, and owned that I had
done well to force him out.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>2d November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We were now in a country not only “<HI>of
saddles and bridles,</HI>” but of post-chaises; and
having ordered one from Kilmarnock, we got
to Auchinleck before dinner.</P>
<P>My father was not quite a year and a half
older than Dr. Johnson; but his conscientious
discharge of his laborious duty as a judge in
Scotland, where the law proceedings are al∣most
all in writing,—a severe complaint which
<PB N="471" REF="477"/>
ended in his death,—and the loss of my mother,
a woman of almost unexampled piety and
goodness,—had before this time in some degree
affected his spirits, and rendered him less dis∣posed
to exert his faculties: for he had origi∣nally
a very strong mind, and cheerful temper.
He assured me he never had felt one moment of
what is called low spirits, or uneasiness without
a real cause. He had a great many good
stories, which he told uncommonly well, and he
was remarkable for “humour, <HI>incolumi gravitate,</HI>”
as Lord Monboddo used to characterise it.
His age, his office, and his character, had
long given him an acknowledged claim to
great attention, in whatever company he was;
and he could ill brook any diminution of it.
He was as sanguine a Whig and presbyterian,
as Dr. Johnson was a Tory, and church of
England man: and as he had not much leisure
to be informed of Dr. Johnson's great merits,
by reading his works, he had a partial and un∣favourable
notion of him, founded on his sup∣posed
political tenets; which were so discordant
to his own, that, instead of speaking of him
with that respect to which he was entitled, he
used to call him “a <HI>Jacobite fellow.</HI>” Know∣ing
all this, I should not have ventured to
bring them together, had not my father, out
of kindness to me, desired me to invite Dr.
Johnson to his house.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="478"/>
I was very anxious that all should be well;
and begged of my friend to avoid three topicks,
as to which they differed very widely; Whig∣gism,
Presbyterianism, and—Sir John Pringle.
He said courteously, “I shall certainly not
talk on subjects which I am told are disagree∣able
to a gentleman under whose roof I am;
especially, I shall not do so to <HI>your father.</HI>”</P>
<P>Our first day went off very smoothly. It
rained, and we could not get out; but my
father shewed Dr. Johnson his library, which,
in curious editions of the Greek and Roman
classicks is, I suppose, not excelled by any
private collection in Great Britain. My father
had studied at Leyden, and been very intimate
with the Gronovii, and other learned men
there. He was a sound scholar, and, in par∣ticular,
had collated manuscripts and different
editions of Anacreon, and others of the Greek
Lyrick poets, with great care; so that my
friend and he had much matter for conversation
without touching on the fatal topicks of differ∣ence.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson found here Baxter's <HI>Anacreon,</HI>
which he told me he had long inquired for in
vain, and began to suspect there was no such
book. Baxter was the keen antagonist of
Barnes. His Life is in the <HI>Biographia Britan∣nica.</HI>
My father has written many notes on
this book, and Dr. Johnson and I talked of
having it reprinted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="473" REF="479"/>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>3d November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It rained all day, and gave Dr. Johnson an
impression of that incommodiousness of climate
in the west, of which he has taken notice in
his “Journey;” but, being well accommodated,
and furnished with variety of books, he was not
dissatisfied.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen of the neighbourhood came
to visit my father; but there was little con∣versation.
One of them asked Dr. Johnson,
how he liked the Highlands. The question
seemed to irritate him, for he answered, “How,
sir, can you ask me what obliges me to speak
unfavourably of a country where I have been
hospitably entertained? Who <HI>can</HI> like the
Highlands?—I like the inhabitants very well.”
—The gentlemen asked no more questions.</P>
<P>Let me now make up for present neglect,
by again gleaning from the past. At Lord
Monboddo's, after the conversation upon the
decrease of learning in England, his lordship
mentioned <HI>Hermes</HI> by Mr. Harris of Salisbury,
as the work of a living authour, for whom he
had a great respect. Dr. Johnson said nothing
at the time; but when we were in our post∣chaise,
told me, he thought Harris “a coxcomb.”
This he said of him, not as a man, but as an
authour; and I give his opinions of men and
books, faithfully, whether they agree with my
<PB N="474" REF="480"/>
own, or not. I do admit, that there always
appeared to me something of affectation in
Mr. Harris's manner of writing; something of
a habit of clothing plain thoughts in analytick
and categorical formality. But all his writings
are imbued with learning; and all breathe
that philanthropy and amiable disposition,
which distinguished him as a man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, though devoted to the study of grammar and dia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecticks, was not so absorbed in it as to be without a sense of pleasantry, or to be offended at his favourite topicks being treated lightly. I one day met him in the street, as I was hastening to the House of Lords, and told him, I was sorry I could not stop, being rather too late to attend an appeal of the Duke of Hamilton against Douglas. “I thought (said he) their contest had been over long ago.” I answered, “The contest concerning Douglas's filiation was over long ago; but the contest now is, who shall have the estate.” Then, assuming the air of “an ancient sage philosopher,” I proceeded thus: “Were I to <HI>predicate</HI> concerning him, I should say, the contest formerly was, What <HI>is</HI> he? The contest now is, What <HI>has</HI> he?”—“Right, (replied Mr. Harris, smiling,) you have done with <HI>quality,</HI> and have got into <HI>quantity.</HI>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At another time, during our Tour, he drew
the character of a rapacious Highland Chief,
with the strength of Theophrastus or La Bruyere;
concluding with these words: “Sir, he has no
more the soul of a Chief, than an attorney who
has twenty houses in a street, and considers
how much he can make by them.”</P>
<P>He this day, when we were by ourselves,
observed, how common it was for people to
talk from books; to retail the sentiments of
<PB N="475" REF="481"/>
others, and not their own; in short, to converse
without any originality of thinking. He was

<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>4th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I was glad to have at length a very fine day,
on which I could shew Dr. Johnson the <HI>Place</HI> of
my family, which he has honoured with so
much attention in his “Journey.” He is,
however, mistaken in thinking that the Cel∣tick
name, <HI>Auchinleck,</HI> has no relation to the
natural appearance of it. I believe every Cel∣tick
name of a place will be found very de∣scriptive.
<HI>Auchinleck</HI> does not signify a <HI>stony
field,</HI> as he has said, but a <HI>field of flag-stones;</HI> and
this place has a number of rocks, which
abound in strata of that kind. The “sullen
dignity of the old castle,” as he has forcibly
expressed it, delighted him exceedingly. On
one side of the rock on which its ruins stand,
runs the river <HI>Lugar,</HI> which is here of consider∣able
breadth, and is bordered by other high
rocks, shaded, with wood. On the other side
runs a brook, skirted in the same manner, but
on a smaller scale. It is impossible to figure
a more romantick scene.</P>
<P>I felt myself elated here, and expatiated to
my illustrious Mentor on the antiquity and ho∣nourable
alliances of my family, and on the
<PB N="476" REF="482"/>
merits of its founder, Thomas Boswell, who
was highly favoured by his sovereign, James IV.
of Scotland, and fell with him at the battle of
Floddon-field; and, in the glow of what, I am
sensible, will, in a commercial age, be considered
as genealogical enthusiasm, did not omit to
mention, what I was sure my friend would not
think lightly of, my relation to the Royal Per∣sonage,
whose liberality, on his accession to the
throne, had given him comfort and indepen∣dence.
I have, in a former page, acknowledged
my pride of ancient blood, in which I was en∣couraged
by Dr. Johnson: my readers therefore
will not be surprized at my having indulged it
on this occasion.</P>
<P>Not far from the old castle is a spot of con∣secrated
earth, on which may be traced the
foundations of an ancient chapel, dedicated to
St. Vincent, and where, in old times, was the
“place of graves” for the family. It grieves
me to think that the remains of sanctity here,
which were considerable, were dragged away,
and employed in building a part of the house of
Auchinleck, of the middle age; which was the
family residence, till my father erected that
“elegant modern mansion,” of which Dr.
Johnson speaks so handsomely. Perhaps this
chapel may one day be restored.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was pleased, when I shewed him
some venerable old trees, under the shade of
<PB N="477" REF="483"/>
which my ancestors had walked. He exhorted
me to plant assiduously, as my father had done
to a great extent.</P>
<P>As I wandered with my revered friend in
the groves of Auchinleck, I told him, that, if
I survived him, it was my intention to erect a
monument to him here, among scenes which,
in my mind, were all classical; for in my
youth I had appropriated to them many of
the descriptions of the Roman poets. He could
not bear to have death presented to him in any
shape; for, his constitutional melancholy made
the king of terrors more frightful. He
turned off the subject, saying, “Sir, I hope to
see your grand-children.!”</P>
<P>This forenoon he observed some cattle with∣out
horns, of which he has taken notice in his
“Journey,” and seems undecided whether they
be of a particular race. My learned friend's
doubts appear to have had no foundation; for
my respectable neighbour, Mr. Fairlie, who,
with all his attention to agriculture, finds time
both for the classicks and his friends, assures
me they are a distinct species, and that, when
any of their calves have horns, a mixture of
breed can be traced. In confirmation of his
opinion, he pointed out to me the following
passage in Tacitus,—“<HI>Ne armentis quidem suus
honor, aut gloria frontis;</HI>” (De mor. Germ. § 5.)
which he wondered had escaped Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="484"/>
On the front of the house of Auchinleck is
this inscription:
<Q><L>—Quod petis, hic est;</L>
<L>Est Ulubris; animus si te non deficit aequus.</L></Q>
It is characteristick of the founder; but the
<HI>animus aequus</HI> is, alas! not inheritable, nor the
subject of devise. He always talked to me as
if it were in a man's own power to attain it;
but Dr. Johnson told me that he owned to him,
when they were alone, his persuasion that it was
in a great measure constitutional, or the effect
of causes which do not depend on ourselves,
and that Horace boasts too much, when he says,
<HI>aequum mi animum ipse parabo.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>5th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The Reverend Mr. Dun, our parish minister,
who had dined with us yesterday, with some
other company, insisted that Dr. Johnson and
I should dine with him to-day. This gave me
an opportunity to shew my friend the road to
the church, made by my father at a great ex∣pence,
for above three miles, through a range
of well enclosed farms, with a row of trees on
each side of it. He called it the <HI>Via sacra,</HI> and
was very fond of it. Mr. Dun, though a man
of sincere good principles, as a presbyterian
divine, discovered a narrowness of information
concerning the dignitaries of the church of
England, among whom may be found men
<PB N="479" REF="485"/>
of the greatest learning, virtue, and piety, and
of a truly apostolick character. He talked
before Dr. Johnson, of fat bishops and drowsy
deans; and, in short, seemed to believe the
illiberal and profane scoffings of professed saty∣rists,
or vulgar railers. Dr. Johnson was so
highly offended, that he said to him, “Sir,
you know no more of our church than a
Hottentot.”—I was sorry that he brought this
upon himself.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>6th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I cannot be certain, whether it was this
day, or a former, that Dr. Johnson and my
father came in collision. If I recollect right,
the contest began while my father was shewing
him his collection of medals; and Oliver
Cromwell's coin unfortunately introduced
Charles the First, and Toryism. They be∣came
exceedingly warm, and violent, and I
was very much distressed by being present at
such an altercation between two men, both of
whom I reverenced; yet I durst not interfere.
It would certainly be very unbecoming in me
to exhibit my honoured father, and my
respected friend, as intellectual gladiators, for
the entertainment of the publick; and there∣fore
I suppress what would, I dare say, make
an interesting scene in this dramatick sketch,—
<PB N="480" REF="486"/>
this account of the transit of Johnson over the
Caledonian Hemisphere.</P>
<P>Yet I think I may, without impropriety,
mention one circumstance, as an instance of
my father's address. Dr. Johnson challenged
him, as he did us all at Talisker, to point out
any theological works of merit written by Pres∣byterian
ministers in Scotland. My father,
whose studies did not lie much in that way,
owned to me afterwards, himself, that he was
somewhat at a loss how to answer, but that
luckily he recollected having read in catalogues
the title of <HI>Durham on the Galatians;</HI> upon
which he boldly said, “Pray, sir, have you
read Mr. Durham's excellent commentary on
the Galatians?”—“No, sir,” said Dr. John∣son.
By this lucky thought my father kept
him at bay, and for some time enjoyed his
triumph; but his antagonist soon made a re∣tort,
which I forbear to mention.</P>
<P>In the course of their altercation, Whiggism
and Presbyterianism, Toryism and Episco∣pacy,
were terribly buffeted. My worthy
hereditary friend, Sir John Pringle, never
having been mentioned, happily escaped with∣out
a bruise.</P>
<P>My father's opinion of Dr. Johnson may be
conjectured from the name he afterwards gave
him, which was URSA MAJOR. But it is not
true, as has been reported, that it was in con∣sequence
<PB N="481" REF="487"/>
of my saying that he was a <HI>constellation</HI>
of genius and literature. It was a sly abrupt
expression to one of his bretheren on the bench
of the Court of Session, in which Dr. Johnson
was then standing; but it was not said in his
hearing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>7th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>My father and I went to publick worship in
our parish-church, in which I regretted that
Dr. Johnson would not join us; for, though we
have there no form of prayer, nor magnificent
solemnity, yet, as GOD is worshipped in spirit
and in truth, and the same doctrines preached
as in the church of England, my friend would
certainly have shewn more liberality, had he
attended. I doubt not, however, but he em∣ployed
his time in private to very good pur∣pose.
His uniform and servant piety was ma∣nifested
on many occasions during our Tour,
which I have not mentioned.—His reason for
not joining in Presbyterian worship, has been
recorded in a former page<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>8th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding the altercation that had
passed, my father who had the dignified cour∣tesy
of an old Baron, was very civil to Dr.
Johnson, and politely attended him to the
post-chaise, which was to convey us to Edin∣burgh.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="488"/>
Thus they parted.—They are now in ano∣ther,
and a higher, state of existence: and as
they were both worthy christian men, I trust
they have met in happiness. But I must ob∣serve,
in justice to my friend's political princi∣ples,
and my own, that they have met in a
place where there is no room for <HI>Whiggism.</HI></P>
<P>We came at night to a good inn at Hamil∣ton.
—I recollect no more.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tuesday, <DATE>9th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I wished to have shewn Dr. Johnson the
Duke of Hamilton's house, commonly called
the <HI>Palace</HI> of Hamilton, which is close by the
town. It is an object which, having been
pointed out to me as a splendid edifice, from my
earliest years, in travelling between Auchinleck
and Edinburgh, has still great grandeur in my
imagination. My friend consented to stop, and
view the outside of it, but could not be per∣suaded
to go into it.</P>
<P>We arrived this night at Edinburgh, after
an absence of eighty-three days. For five
weeks together, of the tempestuous season,
there had been no account received of us. I
cannot express how happy I was on finding
myself again at home.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wednesday, <DATE>10th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Old Mr. Drummond, the bookseller, came
to breakfast. Dr. Johnson and he had not met
for ten years. There was respect on his side,
<PB N="483" REF="489"/>
and kindness on Dr. Johnson's. Soon afterwards
Lord Elibank came in, and was much pleased
at seeing Dr. Johnson in Scotland. His lord∣ship
said, “hardly any thing seemed to him
more improbable.” Dr. Johnson had a very
high opinion of him. Speaking of him to me,
he characterized him thus: “Lord Elibank
has read a great deal. It is true, I can find in
books all that he has read; but he has a
great deal of what is in books, proved by the
test of real life.”—Indeed, there have been few
men whose conversation discovered more know∣ledge
enlivened by fancy. He published se∣veral
small pieces of distinguished merit; and
has left some in manuscript, in particular an
account of the expedition against Carthagena,
in which he served as an officer in the army.
His writings deserve to be collected. He was
the early patron of Dr. Robertson, the historian,
and Mr. Home, the tragick poet; who, when
they were ministers of country parishes, lived
near his seat. He told me, “I saw these lads
had talents, and they were much with me.”—
I hope they will pay a grateful tribute to his
memory.</P>
<P>The morning was chiefly taken up by Dr.
Johnson's giving him an an account of our
Tour.—The subject of difference in political
principles was introduced.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “It is
much increased by opposition. There was a
<PB N="484" REF="490"/>
violent Whig, with whom I used to contend
with great eagerness. After his death I felt
my Toryism much abated.”—I suppose he
meant Mr. Walmsley, of Lichfield, whose
character he has drawn so well in his Life of
Edmund Smith.</P>
<P>Mr. Nairne came in, and he and I accompa∣nied
Dr. Johnson to Edinburgh castle, which he
owned was “a great place.” But I must
mention, as a striking instance of that spirit of
contradiction to which he had a strong pro∣pensity,
when Lord Elibank was some days
after talking of it with the natural elation of a
Scotchman, or of any man who is proud of a
stately fortress in his own country, Dr. Johnson
affected to despise it, observing, that “it would
make a good <HI>prison</HI> in ENGLAND.”</P>
<P>Lest it should be supposed that I have sup∣pressed
one of his sallies against my country,
it may not be improper here to correct a mis∣taken
account that has been circulated, as to
his conversation this day. It has been said,
that, being desired to attend to the noble pros∣pect
from the Castle-hill, he replied, “Sir, the
noblest prospect that a Scotchman ever sees, is
the high road that leads him to London.”—
This lively sarcasm was thrown out at a tavern
in London, in my presence, many years before.</P>
<P>We had with us to-day at dinner, at my
house, the Lady Dowager Colvill, and Lady
<PB N="485" REF="491"/>
Anne Erskine, sisters of the Earl of Kelly; the
Honourable Archibald Erskine, who has now
succeeded to that title; Lord Elibank; the
Reverend Dr. Blair; Mr. Tytler, the acute
vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots, and his
son, the advocate.</P>
<P><HI>Fingal</HI> being talked of, Dr. Johnson, who used
to boast that he had, from the first, resisted both
Ossian and the Giants of Patagonia, averred
his positive disbelief of its authenticity. Lord
Elibank said, “I am sure it is not M'Pherson's.
Mr. Johnson, I keep company a great deal with
you; it is known I do. I may borrow from
you better things than I can say myself, and
give them as my own; but, if I should, every
body will know whose they are.”—The Doctor
was not softened by this compliment. He de∣nied
merit to <HI>Fingal,</HI> supposing it to be the
production of a man who has had the advan∣tages
that the present age affords; and said,
“nothing is more easy than to write enough
in that style, if once you begin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I desire not to be understood as agreeing <HI>entirely</HI> with the opinions of Dr. Johnson, which I relate without any remark. The many imitations, however, of <HI>Fingal,</HI> that have been published, confirm this observation in a considerable degree.</NOTE>.”—Young
Mr. Tytler stepped briskly forward, and said,
“<HI>Fingal</HI> is certainly genuin; for I have heard
a great part of it repeated in the original.”—
<PB N="486" REF="492"/>
Dr. Johnson indignantly asked him, “Sir, do
you understand the original?”—<HI>Tytler.</HI> “No,
sir.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, then, we see to what
this testimony comes:—Thus it is.”—He af∣terwards
said to me, “Did you observe the
wonderful confidence with which young Tytler
advanced, with his front ready <HI>brased?</HI>”</P>
<P>I mention this as a remarkable proof how
liable the mind of man is to credulity, when
not guarded by such strict examination as that
which Dr. Johnson habitually practised. This
gentleman's talents and integrity are unques∣tionable;
yet, had not Dr. Johnson made
him advert to the consideration, that he who
does not understand a language, cannot know
that something which is recited to him is in
that language, he might have believed, and
reported to this hour, that he had “heard a
great part of <HI>Fingal</HI> repeated in the original.”</P>
<P>For the satisfaction of those on the north of
the Tweed, who may think Dr. Johnson's ac∣count
of Caledonian credulity and inaccuracy
too strong, it is but fair to add, that he
admitted the same kind of ready belief might
be found in his own country. “He would un∣dertake
(he said) to write an epick poem on
the story of <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> and half England, to
whom the names and places he should mention
in it are familiar, would believe and declare
they had heard it from their earliest years.”</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="493"/>
One of his objections to the authenticity of
<HI>Fingal,</HI> during the conversation at Ulinish, is
omitted in my Journal, but I perfectly recol∣lect
it.—“Why is not the original deposited in
some publick library, instead of exhibiting
attestations of its existence? Suppose there
were a question in a court of justice, whether a
man be dead or alive: You aver he is alive,
and you bring fifty witnesses to swear it: I
answer, Why do you not produce the man?”
—This is an argument founded on one of the
first principles of the <HI>law of evidence,</HI> which
<HI>Gilbert</HI> would have held to be irrefragable.</P>
<P>I do not think it incumbent on me to give
any precise decided opinion upon this question,
as to which I believe more than some, and less
than others. The subject appears to have now
become very uninteresting to the publick.
That <HI>Fingal</HI> is not from beginning to end a
translation from the Galick, but that <HI>some</HI> pas∣sages
have been supplied by the editor to connect
the whole, I have heard admitted by very warm
advocates for its authenticity. If this be the
case, why are not these distinctly ascertained?
Antiquaries, and admirers of the work, may
complain, that they are in a situation similar to
that of the unhappy gentleman whose wife in∣formed
him, on her death-bed, that one of
their reputed children was not his; and, when
he eagerly begged her to declare which of them
<PB N="488" REF="494"/>
it was, she answered, “<HI>That</HI> you shall never
know;” and expired, leaving him in irreme∣diable
doubt as to them all.</P>
<P>I beg leave now to say something upon
<HI>second sight,</HI> of which I have related two in∣stances,
as they impressed my mind at the time.
I own, I returned from the <HI>Hebrides</HI> with a con∣siderable
degree of faith in the many stories of
that kind which I heard with a too easy ac∣quiescence,
without any close examination of
the evidence: but, since that time, my belief
in those stories has been much weakened, by
reflecting on the careless inaccuracy of narra∣tive
in common matters, from which we may
certainly conclude that there may be the same
in what is more extraordinary.—It is but just,
however, to add, that the belief in second sight
is not peculiar to the Highlands and isles.</P>
<P>Some years after our Tour, a cause was
tried in the Court of Session, where the prin∣cipal
fact to be ascertained was, whether a
ship master, who used to frequent the Western
Highlands and Isles, was drowned in one par∣ticular
year, or in the year after. A great
number of witnesses from those parts were
examined on each side, and swore directly
contrary to each other, upon this simple ques∣tion.
One of them, a very respectable Chief∣tain,
who told me a story of second sight,
which I have not mentioned, but which I too
implicitly believed, had in this case, previous
<PB N="489" REF="495"/>
to his publick examination, not only said, but
attested under his hand, that he had seen the
ship-master in the year subsequent to that in
which the court was finally satisfied he was
drowned. When interrogated with the strict∣ness
of judicial inquiry, and under the awe of
an oath, he recollected himself better, and re∣tracted
what he had formerly asserted, apolo∣gising
for his inaccuracy, by telling the judges,
“A man will <HI>say</HI> what he will not <HI>swear.</HI>”—By
many he was much censured, and it was main∣tained
that every gentleman would be as at∣tentive
to truth without the sanction of an
oath, as with it. Dr. Johnson, though he
himself was distinguished at all times by a
scrupulous adherence to truth, controverted this
proposition; and, as a proof that this was not,
though it ought to be, the case, urged the very
different decisions of elections under Mr. Gren∣ville's
Act, from those formerly made. “Gen∣tlemen
will not pronounce upon oath, what they
would have said, and voted in the house, with∣out
that sanction.”</P>
<P>However difficult it may be for men who be∣lieve
in preternatural communications, in mo∣dern
times, to satisfy those who are of a different
opinion, they may easily refute the doctrine
of their opponents, who impute a belief in
<HI>second sight</HI> to <HI>superstition.</HI> To entertain a visio∣nary
notion that one sees a distant or future
event, may be called <HI>superstition;</HI> but the cor∣respondence
<PB N="490" REF="496"/>
of the fact or event with such an
impression on the fancy, though certainly very
wonderful, <HI>if proved,</HI> has no more connection
with superstition, than magnetism or electri∣city.</P>
<P>After dinner, various topicks were discussed;
but I recollect only one particular. Dr. Johnson
compared the different talents of Garrick and
Foote, as companions, and gave Garrick
greatly the preference for elegance, though he
allowed Foote extraordinary powers of enter∣tainment.
He said, “Garrick is restrained by
some principle; but Foote has the advantage of
an unlimited range. Garrick has some deli∣cacy
of feeling; it is possible to put him out;
you may get the better of him; but Foote is
the most incompressible fellow that I ever
knew: when you have driven him into a cor∣ner,
and think you are sure of him, he runs
through between your legs, or jumps over your
head, and makes his escape.”</P>
<P>Dr. Erskine and Mr. Robert Walker, two
very respectable ministers of Edinburgh, supped
with us, as did the Reverend Dr. Webster.
—The conversation turned on the Moravian
missions, and on the Methodists. Dr. Johnson
observed in general, that missionaries were too
sanguine in their accounts of their success a∣mong
savages, and that much of what they
tell is not to be believed. He owned that the
<PB N="491" REF="497"/>
Methodists had done good; had spread religious
impressions among the vulgar part of mankind:
but, he said, they had great bitterness against
other Christians, and that he never could get a
Methodist to explain in what he excelled others;
that it always ended in the indispensible neces∣sity
of hearing one of their preachers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thursday, <DATE>11th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Principal Robertson came to us as we sat at
breakfast: he advanced to Dr. Johnson, repeat∣ing
a line of Virgil, which I forget. I suppose
either
<Q><L>Post varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum,—
<HI>or</HI></L>
<L>—multum ille et terris jactatus, et alto.</L></Q>
Every body had addressed us with some studied
compliment on our return. Dr. Johnson said,
“I am really ashamed of the congratulations
which we receive. We are addressed as if we
had made a voyage to Nova Zembla, and suf∣fered
five persecutions in Japan.” And he af∣terwards
remarked, that, “to see a man come
up with a formal air, and a Latin line, when
we had had no fatigue and no danger, was pro∣voking.”
—I told him, he was not sensible of
the danger, having lain under cover in the boat
during the storm: he was like the chicken,
that hides its head under its wing, and then
thinks itself safe.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="498"/>
Lord Elibank came to us, as did Sir Wil∣liam
Forbes. The rash attempt in 1745 being
mentioned, I observed, that it would make a
fine piece of History. Dr. Johnson said it
would. Lord Elibank doubted whether any
man of this age could give it impartially.—
<HI>Johnson.</HI> “A man, by talking with those of
different sides, who were actors in it, and
putting down all that he hears, may in time
collect the materials of a good narrative. You
are to consider, all history was at first oral. I
suppose Voltaire was fifty years in collecting
his <HI>Louis XIV.</HI> which he did in the way that
I am proposing.—<HI>Robertson.</HI> “He did so. He
lived much with all the great people who were
concerned in that reign, and heard them talk
of every thing; and then either took Mr. Bos∣well's
way, of writing down what he heard, or,
which is as good, preserved it in his memory;
for he has a wonderful memory.”—With the
leave, however, of this elegant historian, no
man's memory can preserve facts or sayings
with such fidelity as may be done by writing
them down when they are recent.—Dr. Ro∣bertson
said, it was now full time to make such
a collection as Dr. Johnson suggested; for
many of the people who were then in arms,
were dropping off; and both Whigs and Jacobites
were now come to talk with moderation.”—
Lord Elibank said to him, “Mr. Robertson,
<PB N="493" REF="499"/>
the first thing that gave me a high opinion of
you, was your saying in the Select Society<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A society for debate in Edinburgh, consisting of the most eminent men.</NOTE>,
while parties ran high, soon after the year
1745, that you did not think worse of a man's
moral character for his having been in rebel∣lion.
This was venturing to utter a liberal
sentiment, while both sides had a detestation of
each other.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson observed, that being in rebel∣lion
from a notion of another's right, was not
connected with depravity; and that we had
this proof of it, that all mankind applauded
the pardoning of rebels; which they would not
do in the case of robbers and murderers. He
said, with a smile, that “he wondered that the
phrase of <HI>unnatural</HI> rebellion should be so much
used, for that all rebellion was natural to man.”</P>
<P>As I kept no Journal of any thing that passed
after this morning, I shall, from memory,
groupe together this and the other days, till
that on which Dr. Johnson departed for London.
They were in all nine days; on which he dined
at Lady Colvill's, Lord Hailes's, Sir Adolphus
Oughton's, Sir Alexander Dick's, Principal
Robertson's, Mr. M'Laurin's, and thrice at
Lord Elibank's seat in the country, where we
also passed two nights. He supped at the Ho∣nourable
<PB N="494" REF="500"/>
Alexander Gordon's, now one of our
judges, at Mr. Nairne's, Dr. Blair's, and Mr.
Tytler's; and at my house thrice,—one evening
with a numerous company, chiefly gentlemen
of the law; another with Mr. Menzies of Cul∣dares,
and Lord Monboddo, who disengaged
himself on purpose to meet him; and the even∣ing
on which we returned from Lord Elibank's,
he supped with my wife and me, by ourselves.</P>
<P>He breakfasted at Dr. Webster's, at old Mr.
Drummond's, and at Dr. Blacklock's; and
spent one forenoon at my uncle Dr. Boswell's,
who shewed him his curious museum; and, as
he was an elegant scholar, and a physician bred
in the school of Boerhaave, Dr. Johnson was
pleased with his company.</P>
<P>On the mornings when he breakfasted at my
house, he had, from ten o'clock till one or two,
a constant levee of various persons, of very dif∣ferent
characters and descriptions. I could not
attend him, being obliged to be in the Court of
Session; but my wife was so good as to devote
the greater part of the morning to the endless
task of pouring out tea for my friend and his
visitors.</P>
<P>Such was the disposition of his time at Edin∣burgh.
He said one evening to me, in a fit of
languor, “Sir, we have been harrassed by in∣vitations.”
I acquiesced. “Ay, sir, he replied;
<PB N="495" REF="501"/>
but how much worse would it have been, if we
had been neglected?”</P>
<P>From what has been recorded in this Journal,
it may well be supposed that a variety of ad∣mirable
conversation has been lost, by my
neglect to preserve it.—I shall endeavour to re∣collect
some of it, as well as I can.</P>
<P>At Lady Colvill's, to whom I am proud to
introduce any stranger of eminence, that he
may see what dignity and grace is to be found
in Scotland, an officer observed, that he had
heard Lord Mansfield was not a great English
lawyer.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Why, sir, supposing Lord
Mansfield not to have the splendid talents
which he possesses, he must be a great English
lawyer, from having been so long at the bar,
and having passed through so many of the
great offices of the law. Sir, you may as well
maintain that a carrier, who has driven a pack-horse
between Edinburgh and Berwick for
thirty years, does not know the road, as that
Lord Mansfield does not know the law of
England.”</P>
<P>At Mr. Nairne's, he drew the character of
Richardson, the authour of <HI>Glarissa,</HI> with a strong
yet delicate pencil. I lament much that I have
not preserved it: I only remember that he ex∣pressed
a high opinion of his talents and virtues;
but observed, that “his perpetual study was to
ward off petty inconveniencies, and procure petty
pleasures; that his love of continual superiority
<PB N="496" REF="502"/>
was such, that he took care to be always sur∣rounded
by women, who listened to him im∣plicitly,
and did not venture to controvert his
opinions; and that his desire of distinction was
so great, that he used to give large vails to
the Speaker Onslow's servants, that they might
treat him with respect.”</P>
<P>On the same evening, he would not allow
that the private life of a judge, in England,
was required to be so strictly decorous as I
supposed. “Why then, sir, (said I,) according
to your account, an English judge may just
live like a gentleman.”—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Yes, sir,—
if he <HI>can.</HI>”</P>
<P>At Mr. Tytler's, I happened to tell that one
evening, a great many years ago, when Dr.
Blair and I were sitting together in the pit of
Drury-lane play-house, in a wild freak of youth∣ful
extravagance, I entertained the audience
<HI>prodigiously,</HI> by imitating the lowing of a cow.
A little after I had told this story, I differed
from Dr. Johnson, I suppose too confidently,
upon some point, which I now forget. He did
not spare me. “Nay, sir, (said he,) if you
cannot talk better as a man, I'd have you bel∣low
like a cow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As I have been scrupulously exact in relating anecdotes concerning other persons, I shall not withhold any part of this story, however Tudicrous.—I was so successful in this boyish frolick, that the universal cry of the galleries was, “<HI>Encore</HI> the cow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Encore</HI> the cow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>” In the pride of my heart, I at∣tempted imitations of some other animals, but with very inferior effect. My reverend friend, anxious for my <HI>fame,</HI> with an air of the utmost gravity and earnestness, addressed me thus: “My dear sir, I would <HI>confine</HI> my self to the <HI>cow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>”</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="503"/>
At Dr. Webster's, he said, that he believed
hardly any man died without affectation. This
remark appears to me to be well-founded, and
will account for many of the celebrated death-bed
sayings which are recorded.</P>
<P>One of the evenings at my house, when he
told that Lord Lovat boasted to an English no∣bleman,
that though he had not his wealth, he
had two thousand men whom he could at any
time call into the field, the Honourable Alex∣ander
Gordon observed, that those two thousand
men brought him to the block.—“True, sir,
said Dr. Johnson; but you may just as well
argue, concerning a man who has fallen over a
precipice, to which he has walked too near,—
“His two legs brought him to that.” Is he not
the better for having two legs?”</P>
<P>At Dr. Blair's I left him, in order to attend
a consultation, during which he and his amiable
host were by themselves. I returned to supper,
at which were Principal Robertson, Mr. Nairne,
and some other gentlemen. Dr. Robertson and
Dr. Blair, I remember, talked well upon subor∣dination
and government; and, as my friend
and I were walking home, he said to me, “Sir,
these two doctors are good men, and wise men.”
<PB N="498" REF="504"/>
—I begged of Dr. Blair to recollect what he
could of the long conversation that passed be∣tween
Dr. Johnson and him alone, this evening,
and he obligingly wrote to me as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Dear sir,”</SALUTE>
<DATE>March 3, 1785.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“—As so many years have intervened,”
since I chanced to have that conversation with
Dr. Johnson in my house, to which you refer,
I have forgotten most of what then passed, but
remember that I was both instructed and en∣tertained
by it. Among other subjects, the
discourse happening to turn on modern Latin
poets, the Doctor expressed a very favourable
opinion of Buchanan, and instantly repeated,
from beginning to end, an ode of his, intituled
<HI>Calendae Maiae,</HI> (the eleventh in his <HI>Miscella∣neorum
Liber,)</HI> beginning with these words,
“<HI>Salvete sacris deliciis sacrae,</HI>” with which I had
formerly been unacquainted; but, upon pe∣rusing
it, the praise which he bestowed upon it,
as one of the happiest of Buchanan's poetical
compositions, appeared to me very just. He
also repeated to me a Latin ode he had com∣posed
in one of the Western Islands, from which
he had lately returned. We had much dis∣course
concerning his excursion to those islands,
with which he expressed himself as having been
highly pleased; talked in a favourable manner
of the hospitality of the inhabitants; and par∣ticularly
<PB N="499" REF="505"/>
spoke much of his happiness in having
you for his companion; and said, that the
longer he knew you, he loved and esteemed
you the more. This conversation passed in the
interval between tea and supper, when we were
by ourselves. You, and the rest of the com∣pany
who were with us at supper, have often
taken notice that he was uncommonly bland
and gay that evening, and gave much pleasure
to all who were present.—This is all that I can
recollect distinctly of that long conversation.</P>
<CLOSER>“Yours sincerely,
<SIGNED>HUGH BLAIR.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>At Lord Hailes's, we spent a most agree∣able
day; but again I must lament that I was
so indolent as to let almost all that passed eva∣porate
into oblivion. Dr. Johnson observed
there, that “it was wonderful how ignorant
many officers of the army are, considering how
much leisure they have for study, and the
acquisition of knowledge.” I hope he was
mistaken; for he maintained that many of
them were ignorant of things belonging im∣mediately
to their own profession; “for in∣stance,
many cannot tell how far a musket will
carry a bullet;” in proof of which, I suppose,
he mentioned some particular person, for
Lord Hailes, from whom I solicited what he
<PB N="500" REF="506"/>
could recollect of that day, writes to me as
follows:</P>
<P>“As to Dr. Johnson's observation about the
ignorance of officers in the length that a musket
will carry,” my brother, Colonel Dalrymple,
was present, and he thought that the doctor
was either mistaken, by putting the question
wrong, or that he had conversed on the subject
with some person out of service.</P>
<P>“Was it upon that occasion that he ex∣pressed
no curiosity to see the room at Dum∣fermline,
where Charles I. was born? “I know
that he was born, (said he;) no matter where.”
—Did he envy us the birth-place of the
king?”</P>
<P>Near the end of his “Journey,” Dr. John∣son
has given liberal praise to Mr. Braidwood's
academy for the deaf and dumb. When he
visited it, a circumstance occurred which was
truly characteristical of our great Lexicographer.
“Pray, (said he,) can they pronounce any <HI>long</HI>
words?”—Mr. Braidwood informed him they
could. Upon which Dr. Johnson wrote one of
his <HI>sequipedalia verba,</HI> which was pronounced by
the deaf and dumb, and he was satisfied.—My
readers may perhaps wish to know what the
word was; but I cannot gratify their curiosity.
Mr. Braidwood told me, it remained long in his
<PB N="501" REF="507"/>
school, but had been lost before I made my
inquiry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the best criticks of our age “does not wish to prevent the admirers of the incorrect and nerveless style, which generally prevailed for a century before Dr. Johnson's energetick writings were known, from enjoying the laugh that this story may produce, in which he is very ready to join them.” He, however, requests me to observe, “that my friend very properly chose a <HI>long</HI> word on this occasion, not, it is believed, from any predilection for polysyllables, (though he certainly had a due respect for them,) but in order to put Mr. Braid∣wood's skill to the strictest test, and to try the efficacy of his instruction by the most difficult exertion of the organs of his pupils.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson one day visited the Court
of Session. He thought the mode of pleading
there too vehement, and too much addressed to
the passions of the judges. “This (said he) is
not the Areopagus.”</P>
<P>At old Mr. Drummond's, Sir John Dal∣rymple
quaintly said, the two noblest animals
in the world were, a Scotch Highlander and an
English Sailor. “Why, sir, said Dr. Johnson,
I shall say nothing as to the Scotch Highlander;
but as to the English Sailor, I cannot agree
with you.”—Sir John said, he was generous in
giving away his money.—<HI>Johnson.</HI> “Sir, he
throws away his money, without thought, and
without merit. I do not call a tree generous,
that sheds its fruit at every breeze.”—Sir John
having affected to complain of the attacks
made upon his <HI>Memoirs,</HI> Dr. Johnson said,
<PB N="502" REF="508"/>
“Nay, sir, do not complain. It is advantageous
to an authour, that his book should be attacked
as well as praised. Fame is a shuttlecock. If
it be struck only at one end of the room, it will
soon fall to the ground. To keep it up, it
must be struck at both ends.”—Often have I
reflected on this since; and, instead of being
angry at many of those who have written
against me, have smiled to think that they
were unintentionally subservient to my fame,
by using a battledoor to make me <HI>virum volitare
per ora.</HI></P>
<P>At Sir Alexander Dick's, from that absence
of mind to which every man is at times subject,
I told, in a blundering manner, Lady Eglin∣toune's
complimentary adoption of Dr. Johnson
as her son; for I unfortunately stated that her
ladyship adopted him as her son, in consequence
of her having been married the year <HI>after</HI> he
was born. Dr. Johnson instantly corrected me.
“Sir, don't you perceive that you are defaming
the countess? For, supposing me to be her son,
and that she was not married till the year after
my birth, I must have been her <HI>natural</HI> son.”
A young lady of quality, who was present, very
handsomely said, “Might not the son have jus∣tified
the fault?”—My friend was much flat∣tered
by this compliment, which he never for∣got.
When in more than ordinary spirits, and
talking of his journey in Scotland, he has called
to me, “Boswell, what was in that the young
<PB N="503" REF="509"/>
lady of quality said of me at Sir Alexander
Dick's?” Nobody will doubt that I was happy
in repeating it.</P>
<P>My illustrious friend, being now desirous to
be again in the great theatre of life and ani∣mated
exertion, took a place in the coach,
which was to set out for London on Monday
the 22nd of November. Sir John Dalrymple
pressed him to come on the Saturday before,
to his house at Cranston, which, being twelve
miles from Edinburgh, upon the middle road
to Newcastle, (Dr. Johnson had come to
Edinburgh by Berwick, and along the naked
coast,) it would make his journey easier, as the
coach would take him up at a more seasonable
hour than that at which it sets out. Sior John,
I perceived, was ambitious of having such a
guest; but, as I was well assured, that at this
very time he had joined with some of his
prejudiced countrymen in railing at Dr.
Johnson, and had said, “he wondered how
any gentleman of Scotland could keep com∣pany
with him,” I thought he did not deserve
the honour: yet, as it might be a convenience to
Dr. Johnson, I contrived that he should accept
the invitation, and engaged to conduct him.
I resolved that, on our way to Sir John's, we
should make a little circuit by Rossin Castle
and Hawthornden, and wished to set out soon
after breakfast; but young Mr. Tytler came
to shew Dr. Johnson some essays which he had
<PB N="504" REF="510"/>
written; and my great friend, who was ex∣ceedingly
obliging when thus consulted, was
detained so long that it was, I believe, one
o'clock before we got into our post-chaise. I
found that we should be too late for dinner at Sir
John Dalrymple's, to which we were engaged;
but I would by no means lose the pleasure of
seeing my friend at Hawthornden,—of seeing
<HI>Sam Johnson</HI> at the very spot where <HI>Ben Jonson</HI>
visited the learned and poetical Drummond.</P>
<P>We surveyed Ros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in-castle, the romantick
scene around it, and the beautiful Gothick
chapel, and dined and drank tea at the inn;
after which we proceeded to Hawthornden,
and viewed the caves; and I all the while had
<HI>Rare Ben</HI> in my mind, and was pleased to think
that this place was now visited by another ce∣lebrated
wit of England.</P>
<P>By this time “the waining night was grow∣ing
old,” and we were yet several miles from
Sir John Dalrymple's. Dr. Johnson did not
seem much troubled at our having treated the
baronet with so little attention to politeness;
but when I talked of the grievous disappoint∣ment
it must have been to him that we did not
come to the <HI>feast</HI> that he had prepared for us,
(for he told us he had killed a seven-year-old
sheep on purpose,) my friend got into a merry
mood, and jocularly said, “I dare say, sir, he
has been very sadly distressed. Nay, we do not
know but the consequence may have been
<PB N="505" REF="511"/>
faral. Let me try to describe his situation in
his own historical style. I have as good a
right to make him think and talk, as he has to
tell us how people thought and talked a hun∣dred
years ago, of which he has no evidence.
All history, so far as it is not supported by
contemporary evidence, is romance.—Stay now.
—Let us consider!”—He then (heartily
laughing all the while) proceeded in his imita∣tion,
I am sure to the following effect, though
now, at the distance of almost twelve years, I
cannot pretend to recollect all the precise
words:</P>
<P>“Dinner being ready, he wondered that his
guests were not yet come. His wonder was
soon succeeded by impatience. He walked
about the room in anxious agitation; some∣times
he looked at his watch, sometimes he
looked out at the window with an eager gaze
of expectation, and revolved in his mind the
various accidents of human life. His family
beheld him with mute conern. “Surely
(said he, with a sigh,) they will not fail me.”
—The mind of man can bear a certain pres∣sure;
but there is a point when it can bear
no more. A rope was in his view, and he
died a Roman death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“Essex was at that time confined to the same chamber of the Tower from which his father Lord Capel had been led to death, and in which his wife's grandfather had inflicted a vo∣luntary death upon himself. When he saw his friend carried to what he reckoned certain fate, their common enemies en∣joying the spectacle, and reflected that it was he who had forced Loro Howard upon the confidence of Russel, he retired, and, by a <HI>Roman death,</HI> put an end to his misery.”</P>
<P>Dalrymple's Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol 1. p. 36.</P></NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="506" REF="512"/>
It was very late before we reached the seat
of Sir John Dalrymple, who, certainly with
some reason was not in very good humour.
Our conversation was not brilliant. We
supped, and went to bed in ancient rooms,
which would have better suited the climate of
Italy in summer, than that of Scotland in the
month of November.</P>
<P>I recollect no conversation of the next day,
worth preserving, except one saying of Dr.
Johnson, which will be a valuable text for
many decent old dowagers, and other good
company, in various circles, to descant upon.—
He said, “I am sorry I have not learnt to play
at cards. It is very useful in life: it generates
kindness, and consolidates society.”—He cer∣tainly
could not mean deep play.</P>
<P>My friend and I thought we should be more
comfortable at the inn at Blackshiels, tow
miles farther on. We therefore went thither
in the evening, and he was very entertaining;
but I have preserved nothing but the pleasing
remembrance, and his verses on George the
Second and Cibber, and his epitaph on Parnell,
<PB N="507" REF="513"/>
which he was then so good as to dictate to
me.</P>
<P>We breakfasted together next morning, and
then the coach came, and took him up. He
had, as one of his companions in it, as far as
Newcastle, the worthy and ingenious Dr.
Hope, botanical professor at Edinburgh. Both
Dr. Johnson and he used to speak of their good
fortune in thus accidentally meeting; for they
had much instructive conversation, which is al∣ways
a most valuable enjoyment, and, when
found where it is not expected, is peculiarly
relished.</P>
<P>I have now completed my account of our
Tour to the Hebrides. I have brought Dr.
Johnson down to Scotland, and seen him into
the coach which in a few hours carried him
back into England. He said to me often,
that the time he spent in this Tour was the
pleasantest part of his life, and asked me if I
would lose the recollection of it for five hun∣dred
pounds. I answered I would not; and
he applauded my setting such a value on an
accession of new images in my mind.</P>
<P>Had it not been for me, I am persuaded Dr.
Johnson never would have undertaken such a
journey; and I must be allowed to assume
some merit, from having been the cause that
our language has been enriched with such a
book as that which he published on his return;
a book which I never read but with the utmost
admiration, as I had such opportunities of
<PB N="508" REF="514"/>
knowing from what very meagre materials it
was composed.</P>
<P>But my praise may be supposed partial; and
therefore I shall insert two testimonies, not
liable to that objection, both written by gen∣tlemen
of Scotland, to whose opinions I am
confident the highest respect will be paid; Lord
Hailes, and Mr. Dempster.</P>

<P>“I cannot omit a moment to return
you may best thanks for the entertainment you
have furnished me,” my family, and guests, by
the perusal of Dr. Johnson's “Journey to the
Western Islands;”—and now for my sentiments
of it.—I was well entertained. His descrip∣tions
are accurate and vivid. He carried me
on the Tour along with him, I am pleased
with the justice he has done to your humour and
vivacity. “The noise of the wind being all
its own,” is a <HI>bon-mot,</HI> that it would have
been a pity to have omitted, and a robbery not
to have ascribed to its author.</P>
<P>“There is nothing in the book,” from be∣ginning
to end, that a Scotchman need to take
amiss. What he says of the country is true,
and his observations on the people are what
must naturally occur to a sensible, observing,
and reflecting inhabitant of a <HI>convenient</HI> Metro∣polis,
where a man on thirty pounds a year
may be better accommodated with all the
little wants of life, that <HI>Col</HI> or <HI>Sir Allan.</HI> He
reason candidly about the <HI>second sight;</HI> but I
wish he had enquired more before he ventured
to say he even doubted of the possibility of such
an unusual and useless deviation from all the”
<PB N="511" REF="517"/>
known laws of nature. The notion of the
second sight I consider as a remnant of super∣stitious
ignorance and credulity, which a phi∣losopher
will set down as such, till the contrary
is clearly proved, and then it will be classed
among the other certain, though unaccount∣able,
parts of our nature, like dreams, and—I
do not know what.</P>
<P>“In regard to the language,” it has the
merit of being all his own. Many words of
foreign extraction are used, where, I believe,
common ones would do as well, especially on
familiar occasion. Yet I believe he could not
express himself so forcibly in any other stile. I
am charmed with his researches concerning the
Erse language, and the antiquity of their ma∣nuscripts.
I am quite convinced; and I shall
rank <HI>Ossian,</HI> and his <HI>Fingals</HI> and <HI>Oscars,</HI> amongst
the Nursery Tales, not the true history of our
country, in all time to come.</P>
<P>“Upon the whole,” the book cannot dis∣please,
for it has no pretension. The author
neither says he is a Geographer, nor an Anti∣quarian,
nor very learned in the History of
Scotland, nor a Naturalist, nor a Fossilist. The
manners of the people, and the face of the
country, are all he attempts to describes, or seems
to have thought of. Much were it to be
wished, that they who have travelled into more
remote, and of course more curious, regions,
<PB N="512" REF="518"/>
had all possessed his good sense. Of the state
of learning, his observations on Glasgow uni∣versity
shew he has formed a very found judge∣ment.
He understands our climate too, and
he has accurately observed the changes, how∣ever
slow and imperceptible to us, which
Scotland has undergone, in consequence of the
blessings of liberty and internal peace. I
could have drawn my pen through the story of
the old woman at St. Andrews, being the only
silly thing in the book. He has taken the
opportunity of engrafting into the work several
good observations, which I dare say he had
made upon men and things, before he set foot
on Scotch ground, by which it is considerably
enriched<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Orme, one of the ablest historians of this age, is of the same opinion. He said to me, “There are in that book thoughts, which, by long revolution in the great mind of Johnson, have been formed and polished,—like pebble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rolled in the ocean!</NOTE>”. A long journey, like a tall May-pole,
though not very beautiful itself, yet is
pretty enough, when ornamented with flowers
and garlands: it furnishes a sort of cloak-pins
for hanging the furniture of your mind upon▪
and whoever sets out upon a journey, without
furnishing his mind previously with much study
and useful knowledge, erects a May-pole in
December, and puts up very useless cloak-pins.</P>

“I hope the book will induce many of his
countrymen to make the same jaunt,” and help
to intermix the more liberal part of them still
more with us, and perhaps abate somewhat of
that virulent antipathy which many of them
entertain against the Scotch; who certainly
would never have formed those <HI>combinations</HI>
which he takes notice of, more than their an∣cestors,
had they not been necessary for their
mutual safety, at least for their success, in a
country where they are treated as foreigners.
They would find us not deficient, at least in
point of hospitality, and they would be ashamed
ever after to abuse us in the mass.</P>
<P>“So much for the Tour.—I have now,” for
the first time in my life, passed a winter in the
country; and never did three months roll on
with more swiftness and satisfaction. I used
not only to wonder at, but pity, those whose lot
condemned them to winter any where but in
either of the capitals. But every place has its
charms to a cheerful mind. I am busy, planting
and taking measures for opening the summer-campaign
in farming; and I find I have an
excellent resource, when revolutions in poli∣ticks
perhaps, and revolutions of the sun for
certain, will make it decent for me to retreat
behind the ranks of the more forward in life.</P>
<P>“I am glad to hear the last was a very busy
week with you.” I see you as counsel in some
<PB N="514" REF="520"/>
causes which must have opened a charming
field for your humorous vein. As it is more
uncommon, so I verily believe it is more useful
than the more serious exercise of reason; and,
to a man who is to appear in publick, more
eclat is to be gained, sometimes more money
too, by a <HI>bon-mot,</HI> than a learned speech. It is
the fund of natural humour which Lord North
possesses, that makes him so much a favourite
of the house, and so able, because so amiable,
a leader of a party.</P>
<P>“I have now finished <HI>my</HI> Tour of <HI>Seven Pages.</HI>
In what remains, I beg leave to offer my com∣pliments,

<P>“I take this occasion of returning you
my most hearty thanks for the civilities shown
to my daughter by you and Mrs. Boswell.” Yet,
though she has informed me that I am under
this obligation, I would very probably have
deferred troubling you with making my ac∣knowledgements
at present, if I had not seen
Doctor Johnson's Journey to the Western Isles,
in which he has been pleased to make a very
friendly mention of my family, for which I am
surely obliged to him, as being more than an
equivalent for the reception you and he met
with. Yet there is one paragraph I should
have been glad he had omitted, which I am sure
was owing to misinformation; that is, that I
had acknowledged M'Leod to be my chief,
though my ancestors disputed the pre-eminence
for a long tract of time.</P>
<P>“I never had occasion to enter seriously on this
argument with the present laird or his grand∣father,”
nor could I have any temptation to such
a renunciation from either of them. I acknow∣ledge
the benefit of being chief of a clan is in
our days of very little significancy, and to
<PB N="516" REF="522"/>
trace out the progress of this honour to the
founder of a family, of any standing, would per∣haps
be a matter of some difficulty.</P>
<P>“The true state of the present case in this:”
the M'Leod family consists of two different
branches; the M'Leods of Lewis, of which I
am descended, and the M'Leods of Harris.
And though the former have lost a very exten∣sive
estate by forfeiture in King James the sixth's
time, there are still several respectable families
of it existing, who would justly blame me for
such an unmeaning cession, when they all ac∣knowledge
me head of that family; which
though in fact it be but an ideal point of ho∣nour,
is not hitherto so far disregarded in our
country, but it would determine some of my
friends to look on me as a much smaller man
than either they or myself judge me at present
to be. I will, therefore, ask it as a favour of
you to acquaint the Doctor with the difficulty
he has brought me to. In travelling among
rival clans such a silly tale as this might easily
be whispered into the ear of passing stranger;
but as it has no foundation in fact, I hope the
Doctor will be so good as to take his own way
in undeceiving the publick, I principally mean
my friends and connections, who will be first
angry at me, and next sorry to find such an in∣stance
of my littleness recorded in a book which
has a very fair chance of being much read. I
<PB N="517" REF="523"/>
expect you will let me know what he will write
you in return, and we here beg to make offer
to you and Mrs. Boswell of our most respectful
compliments. I am,</P>

<SALUTE>“Dear Sir,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“THE day before yesterday I had
the honour to receive your letter,” and I im∣mediately
communicated it to Dr. Johnson.
He said he loved your spirit, and was exceed∣ingly
sorry that he had been the cause of the
smallest uneasiness to you. There is not a more
candid man in the world than he is, when pro∣perly
addressed, as you will see from his letter
to you, which I now enclose. He has allowed
me to take a copy of it, and he says you may
read it to your clan, or publish it if you please.
Be assured, sir, that I shall take care of what
he has entrusted to me, which is to have an ac∣knowledgement
of his errour inserted in the
Edinburgh newspapers. You will, I dare say,
be fully satisfied with Dr. Johnson's behaviour.
He is desirous to know that you are; and
therefore when you have read his acknowledge∣ment
in the papers, I beg you may write to
<PB N="518" REF="524"/>
me; and if you choose it, I am persuaded a
letter from you to the Doctor also will be taken
kind. I shall be at Edinburgh the week after
next.</P>
<P>“Any civilities which my wife and I had it in
our power to shew to your daughter, Miss
M'Leod, were due to her own merit, and were
well repaid by her agreeable company. But
I am sure I should be a very unworthy man if I
did not wish to shew a grateful sense of the
hospitable and genteel manner in which you
was pleased to treat me. Be assured, my dear
sir, that I shall never forget your goodness,
and the happy hours which I spent in Rasay.</P>
<P>“You and Dr. M'Leod were both so obliging
as to promise me an account in writing,” of all
the particulars which each of you remember,
concerning the transactions of 1745-6. Pray
do not forget this, and be as minute and as full
as you can; put down every thing; I have a
great curiosity to know as much as I can, au∣thentically.</P>
<P>“I beg that you may present my best respects
to Lady Rasay,” my compliments to your young
family, and to Dr. M'Leod; and my hearty
good wishes to Malcolm, with whom I hope
again to shake hands cordially. I have the
honour to be,</P>

ADVERTISEMENT, written by Dr. Johnson,
and inserted by his desire in the Edinburgh
newspapers:—Referred to in the foregoing
letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original MS. in now in my possession.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“THE authour of <HI>The Journey to the Western
Islands,</HI> having related that the M'Leods of Rasay
acknowledge the chieftainship or superiority of the
M'Leods of Sky, finds that he has been misin∣formed
or mistaken. He means in a future
edition to correct his errour, and wishes to be told
of more, if more have been discovered.”</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson's letter was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE LAIRD OF RASAY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“MR. Boswell has this day shewn me
a letter,” in which you complain of a passage in
“the Journey to the Hebrides.” My meaning
is mistaken. I did not intend to say that you had
personally made any cession of the rights of
your house, or any acknowledgement of the
superiority of M'Leod of Dunvegan. I only
designed to express what I thought generally
admitted,—that the house of Rasay allowed the
superiority of the house of Dunvegan. Even
this I now find to be erroneous, and will there∣fore
omit or retract it in the next edition.</P>
<P>“Though what I had said had been true,” if
it had been disagreeable to you, I should have
<PB N="520" REF="526"/>
wished it unsaid; for it is not my business to
adjust precedence. As it is mistaken, I find
myself disposed to correct it, both by my re∣spect
for you, and my reverence for truth.</P>
<P>“As I know not when the book will be re∣printed,”
I have desired Mr. Boswell to antici∣pate
the correction in the Edinburgh papers.
This is all that can be done.</P>
<P>“I hope I may now venture to desire that
my compliments may be made,” and my grati∣tude
expressed, to Lady Rasay, Mr. Malcolm
M'Leod, Mr. Donald M'Queen, and all the gen∣tlemen
and all the ladies whom I saw in the island
of Rasay; a place which I remember with too
much pleasure and too much kindness, not to
be sorry that my ignorance, or hasty persuasion,
should, for a single moment, have violated its
tranquillity.</P>
<P>“I beg you all to forgive an undesigned and
involuntary injury,” and to consider me as,</P>
<CLOSER>“Sir, your most obliged,
And most humble servant,
<SIGNED>SAM. JOHNSON.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rasay was highly gratified, and afterwards visited and dined with Dr. Johnson, at his house in London.</NOTE>.”</SIGNED>

<P>It would be improper for me to boast of my
own labours; but I cannot refrain from pub∣lishing
such praise as I received from such a

the perusal of the original manuscript of my
Journal.</P>

<SALUTE>“My dear Sir,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I ought to have thanked your sooner,”
for your very obliging letter, and for the singu∣lar
confidence you are pleased to place in me,
when you trust me with such a curious and
valuable deposite as the papers you have sent
me. Be assured, I have a due sense of this
favour, and shall faithfully and carefully return
them to you. You may rely that I shall neither
copy and part, nor permit the papers to be
seen.</P>
<P>“They contain a curious picture of society,”
and from a journal on the most instructive plan
that can possibly be thought of; for I am not
sure that an ordinary observer would become
so well acquainted either with Dr. Johnson, or
with the manners of the Hebrides, by a personal
intercourse, as by a perusal of your Journal.</P>
<CLOSER>“I am very truly,
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
Your most obedient,

</LETTER>
<P>When I consider how many of the persons
mentioned in this Tour are now gone to “that
undiscovered country from whose bourne no
<PB N="522" REF="528"/>
traveller teturns,” I feel an impression at once
awful and tender.—<HI>Requiescant in pace!</HI></P>
<P>It may be objected by some persons, as it
has been by one of my friends, that he who has
the power of thus exhibiting an exact transcript
of conversations is not a desirable member of
society. I repeat the answer which I made to
that friend:—“Few, very few, need be afraid
that their sayings will be recorded. Can it be
imagined that I would take the trouble to ga∣ther
what grows on every hedge, because I
have collected such fruits as the <HI>Nonpareil</HI> and
the BON CHRETIEN?”</P>
<P>On the other hand, how useful is such a
faculty, if well exercised! To it we owe all
those interesting apothegms and <HI>memorabilia</HI> of
the ancients, which Plutarch, Xenophon, and
Valerius Maximus, have transmitted to us.
To it we owe all those instructive and enter∣taining
collections which the French have made
under the title of <HI>Ana,</HI> affixed to some cele∣brated
name. To it we owe the <HI>Table-Talk</HI> of
Selden, the <HI>Conversation</HI> between Ben Jonson
and Drummond of Hawthornden, Spence's
<HI>Anecdotes</HI> of Pope, and other valuable remains
in our own language. How delighted should
we have been, if thus introduced into the
company of Shakspeare and of Dryden, of
whom we know scarcely any thing but their
admirable writings! What pleasure would it
<PB N="523" REF="529"/>
have given us, to have known their petty ha∣bits,
their characteristick manners, their modes
of composition, and their genuine opinion of
preceding writers and of their contemporaries!
All these are now irrecoverable.—Considering
how many of the strongest and most brilliant
effusions of exalted intellect must have been lost,
how much is it to be regretted that all men of
distinguished wisdom and wit have not been
attended by friends of taste enough to relish,
and abilities enough to register, their conversa∣tion!</P>
<Q><L>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona</L>
<L>Multi, sed omnes illacrymabiles</L>
<L>Urgentur, ignotique longa</L>
<L>Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.</L></Q>
<P>They whose inferiour exertions are recorded,
as serving to explain or illustrate the sayings of
such men, may be proud of being thus asso∣ciated,
and having their names carried down to
posterity, by being appended to an illustrious
character.</P>
<P>Before I quit this subject, I think it proper to
say, that I have suppressed every thing that I
thought could really hurt any one now living.
With respect to what <HI>is</HI> related, I thought it
my duty to “extenuate nothing, nor set down
aught in malice,” and with those lighter strokes
of Dr. Johnson's satire, proceeding from a
warmth and quickness of imagination, not from
<PB N="524" REF="530"/>
any malevolence of heart, and which, on account
of their excellence, could not be omitted, I trust
that they who are the object of them have
good sense and good temper enough not to be
displeased.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I shall ever reflect
with great pleasure on a Tour which has been
the means of preserving so much of the enlight∣ened
and instructive conversation of one whose
virtues will, I hope, ever be an object of imi∣tation,
and whose powers of mind were so ex∣traordinary,
that ages may revolve before such
a man shall again appear.</P>

THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<P>MR. Boswell has been collecting materials for this
work for more than twenty years, during which he
was honoured with the intimate friendship of Dr. Johnson;
to whose memory he is ambitious to erect a literary monu∣ment,
worthy of so great an authour, and so excellent a
man. Dr. Johnson was well informed of his design, and
obligingly communicated to him several curious particu∣lars.
With these will be interwoven the most authentick
accounts that can be obtained from those who knew him
best; many sketches of his conversation on a multiplicity
of subjects, with various persons, some of them the most
eminent of the age; a great number of letters from him at
different periods, and several original pieces dictated by
him to Mr. Boswell, distinguished by that peculiar energy,
which marked every emanation of his mind.</P>
