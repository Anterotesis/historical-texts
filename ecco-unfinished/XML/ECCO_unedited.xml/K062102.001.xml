<HEAD>FOLLY I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Baron d'Urbin had attained that age, when, it is to be pre∣sumed, the stormy passions are hushed into a calm, or to speak less poetically, he had more than compleated his seventieth year; yet, accustomed from his earliest youth to every fashionable dissipation, his reflections on the various scenes of luxu∣rious pleasure, in which he had so fre∣quently
<PB N="14" REF="5"/>been engaged, awakened such pleasing sensations and so warmed his ima∣gination by recollection, that these lively ideas striking on the flint of his memory, and from thence dropping on a heart little better than tinder, brought a kind of fire in his eyes which might serve to remind the beholders of those mountains we read of, emitting flames from their summits, though every other part of them is incrusted with snow and ice. The Baron, however, though certainly old, did not in the least resemble the generality of men at his age. He was naturally good-tempered, lively, gay, entertaining and ever well received in the best and politest circles of Paris—he enjoyed a perfect state of health, except now and then an unwelcome visit from the gout made him call in the aid of his ivo∣ry-headed crutch and quilted sattin
<PB N="15" REF="6"/>shoe, but otherwise walked like a man of thirty; held himself as upright as possi∣ble, and spoke in a loud voice to prove his lungs unimpaired—he was likewise peculiarly happy in a valet-de-chambre, who, by his judicious and elegant man∣ner of dressing a large profusion of fair curls to resemble a fine head of hair, hid many of his wrinkles, took off several years from his appearance, and perfectly ingratiated himself into his master's esteem and affection. The Baron generally passed the morning at his toilette; and being dressed by noon, in the most perfect etiquette of the fashion, he proceed∣ed in his glittering vis-a-vis to pay a circle of visits to some of the most distinguished beauties; and his evenings were chiefly devoted to places of public diversion, where, both at the play and opera, he ogled, nodded and smiled on
<PB N="16" REF="7"/>the actresses without mercy. The women of fashion in general received his adorations with good humour, diverted themselves with his superannuated com∣pliments, and thought it an additional proof of their charms to subdue a lover who had been the delight and cecisbeo of their great-grandmothers; whilst the Ba∣ron imagined his antiquated affection could not fail of inspiring the most flat∣tering return of tenderness and love; and when they smiled at his extravagant rap∣tures, he fancied they approved his passi∣on—whilst, such was his vanity, that he was not in the least astonished at his good fortune; but considered it as the mere irresistable effects and impression of his all-conquering person and charms.</P>

<P>THE Baroness D'Urbin, who had journeyed through almost as many winters as the Baron, possessed the same propensity for gaiety and pleasure with himself; and being equally vain, and de∣sirous of appearing young and handsome, every art which could either adorn her person, or make her appear more amia∣ble and lovely, was constantly exerted. A tete <HI>built</HI> by the most celebrated hair-architect in all Paris, formed in curls and ringlets of Cupids and bleeding hearts, with a great quantity of rouge, and some well directed patches, gave her, according to her idea, the bloom and graces of fifteen; whilst a pair of tight stays, made by the most fashionable work∣man, drew her flat figure into a proper
<PB N="18" REF="9"/>roundness at the top, and smallness at the bottom; a true garrison hoop hid the pointed projection of her bony hips, and shewed the thin ancle to advantage: thus adorned and armed for conquest, she practised a thousand ridiculous airs, and in humble imitation of the god of love, her arrows, like his, were equally direct∣ed to the young and old, plain and hand∣some. Every fancied conquest equally gratified her vanity, and love of univer∣sal power; she smiled on one, affected an air of coldness and disdain to another; laughed and whispered with a third, whilst negligently reclined on an elegant sopha with a fourth, she amused herself with her guitar or knotting, to display the snowy whiteness of her hands and arms; and thus employed she would cir∣culate the scandal of the day, in an half∣lisp kind of whispering tone; every now
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>and then biting and pinching her lips to give them a more inviting redness. At length perceiving her conquests not quite so extensive, or her slaves so faithful as her vanity expected, she began to consi∣der what could possibly occasion such a falling off in her powers of attraction; but at length turning about, and seeing at some little distance her beautiful daugh∣ter of seventeen, in a circle of pretty fel∣lows, with a form and height, which, whilst it convicted her of her declining age, convinced her also, that her artificial charms had now the misfortune of being cruelly eclipsed by this bloom of elegance, youth, and beauty; and thus chagrined at so dreadful a truth, (which, however, she would not for the world have acknow∣ledged) she began for the first time to see the essential difference between herself

<PB N="20" REF="13"/>and Mademoiselle D'Urbin; and from that moment looked upon her with an envious and jealous eye, and was ever horribly out of temper when she was under the morti∣fying necessity of making her one of the party, either at home or abroad.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY III.</HEAD>
<P>IN imminent danger of being thus wholly neglected, the enraged Baron∣ess at length resolved on an expedient well known to most Parisian mothers, whose daughters are either grown tall enough, or handsome enough to claim a share in their conquests: she instantly therefore determined on a convent, in order to sequester those powerful charms which now began to cause her so much disquietude; this resolve, however, re∣quired some pause, and days considera∣tion, to carry into proper execution; not that she herself ever meant to become her frequent visitor, but wished this con∣vent to be one of the first in reputation, that the world might approve her con∣duct in the steps she was taking, when
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>they came to know Mademoiselle D'Urbin was placed there; and so great was her care and delicacy in this point, that it being one of those where young women of quality had been usually educated, and one celebrated for the piety and learning of its inhabitants, was not a sufficient re∣commendation; she rather wished it one of those, where some Princess resided at that time, or at least one of those, that had been an asylum for blood-royal. Nor was it long before the Baroness had the supreme happiness of hearing of one sui∣table to her present wishes; and no sooner had she made the important discovery, than she instantly conducted her daughter to this brilliant prison; and returned home, with the most perfect satisfaction at having thus at once relieved herself from so very troublesome a companion and rival.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Baron expressed little or no concern at the Baroness's return from the convent without Mademoiselle D'Urbin; having long resigned the reins and entire management of all domestic concerns, his own attention (as he thought) being more agreeably taken up and amu∣sed, than in the dull mechanic observance of the conduct of either his wife or daugh∣ter; and indeed the time of a man of gallantry, is too precious to be devoted to women so nearly related to him; he was likewise at this juncture, for the hundred and fifty-sixth time, most violently in love; and so great was his passion, that it entirely changed his natural disposi∣tion. The agitation of his mind was im∣printed on his very countenance; he be∣came
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>grave and thoughtful; sighed most profoundly; lost both sleep and appetite; and was never happy but when in com∣pany with the beloved object of his amo∣rous passion. The nymph who had now made a conquest so flattering to her va∣nity, was a beauty of eighteen, a perfect Euphrosyne, who lived only to laugh, dance, and sing; and so ungovernable was her mirth, that it frequently displayed itself on the most serious subjects: what then must be its effects on one so ridicu∣lous as her old lover, who constantly en∣gaged in all her whims and caprices, with the most eager and docile compli∣ance? Sometimes she would oblige him to run races with her, 'till he was nearly ex∣piring for want of breath; at other times she would make him dance, 'till in a most unbecoming perspiration; now and then, as if intending to confer a favour, she
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>would entangle her fingers in his hair, derange his false curls, beat out the marechale powder with her fan, and keep him in agonies lest his own few grey locks should be discovered; and whilst thus suffering little less than the torture, he was obliged to kiss the fingers which acted so maliciously; and often when he threw himself on his knees to implore her concession, she would suddenly ring her bell, that her servants might sur∣prize her gallant in so comic a situation, so unbecoming his years, and which must appear to them so truly ridiculous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY V.</HEAD>
<P>MADAME D'Urbin, in the midst of her affectation, was struck with the figure of an amiable Chevalier of twenty-two; from daily admiration she became partial, and at length carried her ideas so far as to suppose herself actually in love; in consequence of which she redoubled her coquettish airs and antiquated graces, and became, if possible, more ridiculous than before: the object of her affection was, however, far from believing himself to be the cause of these repeated oglings, and was, in reality, the approved lover of the laughing lady, at whose feet we left the Baron; they had obtained the consent of their friends on both sides, and waited with impatience the day fixed for
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>their happy union. The Baroness, in the mean time, astonished that her sighs and languishing looks made not any impres∣sion on the Chevalier, imputed, with the most perfect satisfaction, his inattention to a want of knowledge of the world, and a diffidence which would not permit him to aspire to a person of her rank and quality; she therefore resolved generously to declare her passion; and took an opportunity of slipping into his pocket, unobserved, a billet couched in the following tender words: <Q>Ungrateful man, do not my “frequent sighs and downcast eyes suf∣ficiently betray the secret of that heart which owns you for its con∣queror? Is it modesty, or indifference, which renders you thus blind to those sentiments you have inspired? I am anxious to know from what cause it can proceed; be therefore in the
<PB N="28" REF="21"/>King's garden at seven to-morrow evening, where I will endeavour to convince you that your felicity de∣pends on yourself, and is greater than you can entertain any idea of at pre∣sent.”</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier knew not what to con∣jecture from the contents of this note; he was equally astonished at the declara∣tion of love, and the manner of its being conveyed into his pocket from a prin∣ciple of constancy scarcely to be credited; his first emotion tempted him to sacri∣fice it to his beloved mistress, but like a true man of fashion he soon hushed this liberal idea asleep, and instantly formed in his mind so fair a picture of the beauty and tenderness of the writer, that he hurried before the appointed hour to the place of assignation, with the utmost
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>self-complacency and satisfaction. After taking several turns in different walks, with impatient eyes and hasty steps, he at length beheld the old Baroness ap∣proach; but fearful, lest her presence would prevent his enamoured charmer and correspondent from making her ap∣pearance, he endeavoured to avoid the Baroness; but every method was in vain; resolved to join him, she accosted him with an affected confusion, whilst the Chevalier, whose bosom beat high with expectation and sensations very different from those she could inspire, payed not the least attention to her seeming embarrass∣ment;—answered all her questions with monosyllables only; and unable to con∣quer or conceal his disquietude at being thus interrupted so <HI>mal à propos,</HI> was going to leave her abruptly, when the enraptured Baroness caught hold of his
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>hand—<Q>I know (said she) my dear “Chevalier, what motive brings you hi∣ther; it is to meet the most tender and faithful of her sex, who comes determined to lay aside her rank and dignity, and gratify your passion; and you behold in me the woman on whom your merit has made so deep an ”impression.</Q> Astonished—mortified, and confused at this unexpected decla∣ration, the Chevalier retired with preci∣pitation, and without power to make her any reply; but could not restrain from the loudest burst of laughter, which the Baroness heard with rage and indigna∣tion; yet returned home as perfectly sa∣tisfied with her own charms, as she was before she made so mortifying an experi∣ment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE expected assignation having thus ended in a manner so little conformable to the wishes of the Che∣valier, he determined to make a virtue of necessity, and went instantly to ac∣quaint his beloved mistress with his disco∣very: her sentiments not being suffici∣ently refined to be hurt by only an in∣tended infidelity, she rallied him on his conquest, and joined in laughing at the resemblance of their destiny, which had favoured them with such antiquated admi∣rers; after many mutual <HI>bon-mots,</HI> smart repartees, and sallies of pleasantry on the occasion, the fair one following the natural liveliness of her disposition, pro∣posed a scheme which the Chevalier, equally malicious, instantly acquiesced
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>in, and soon after parted seemingly on as good terms as ever; but how much were all their acquaintance astonished, when in a few days the lady became not only thoughtful and reserved with her lover, but was seen stealing glances at the Baron, and often permitted him (with the blush and downcast look of modes∣ty) to kiss her hands, with now and then an opportunity thrown carelessly in his way to urge the passion she had formerly made a jest of? But what heightened this situation still, and makes it more laughable, is, the Chevalier became at∣tached to the Baroness, and seemed charmed with her society; and this he carried so far, that when he could not contrive to play at the same table, he would place himself the whole evening behind her chair, converse with her in whispers, frequent only the families
<PB N="33" REF="26"/>where she visited; and in short, became so much her faithful and devoted cecisbeo, that he at last prevailed on her to once more give him a private interview at the house of a Lady whom they both visited. One day, when the old Baron came as usual to pay his court to the idol of his heart, she ran to meet him in the anti-chamber, <Q>Contrive (said she, in a whis∣pering “accent) to steal unperceived at this hour to-morrow to my cham∣ber, I have something of consequence ”to impart to you.</Q> The transported Baron was unable to answer, his whole frame shook as if electrified, his voice faltered, and he could only express his ecstacy by squeezing the fair hand he held in his: the wished for to-morrow at length arrived, and the impatient Ba∣ron appeared at the house of the charmer; two or three rooms being filled with
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>company, soon gave him the wished for opportunity to go unnoticed to the cham∣ber, which he entered on tip toe, and with the utmost precaution and gentle∣ness, shut the door; the shutters were half closed, the curtains entirely drawn down, and a kind of glimmering light seemed to inspire temerity in the lover, and spare the blushes of the lady. The obscurity redoubled the hopes of the Baron, who, on perceiving his mistress reclined on a sopha, approached; and, in defiance of gout, rheumatism, and tre∣mulous old age, threw himself on his knees before her. She sighed most pro∣foundly, yet intimidated (as he supposed) by the novelty of her situation with so enterprising a lover, she continued silent, whilst he in raptures at her condescen∣sion, took her hand and bestowed on it the most lively caresses; at length, re∣clining
<PB N="35" REF="28"/>her head upon his shoulder, <Q>Ah! “”(said she, in a low voice) beloved Che∣valier, I adore you.</Q> The Baron, asto∣nished and surprized, was almost anni∣hilated at this appellation; but recollect∣ing himself, was fearful her agitation of mind had somewhat disordered her in∣tellects. To sooth her terror, he fond∣ly took her in his arms, and was going to repeat his vows of everlasting love and fidelity, when the door flew open with a violent noise, a crowd of company rushed in, the shutters were opened, the curtains drawn up by an in∣visible hand, and discovered to the Baron, fondly encircled in his arms, his antiqua∣ted wife in an elegant dishabille, adorned with a profusion of rose coloured ribbon. Never did the head of Medusa produce a more instantaneous petrefaction, or form two more expressive statues of sur∣prise, than those of the husband and
<PB N="36" REF="29"/>wife, who found themselves so near when they believed themselves so very distant from each other. <Q>Behold, “Ladies and Gentlemen, (said a wit of the company) a rare though im∣prudent example of conjugal tender∣ness in a couple, who, though for many years united in the closest of all ties, yet still continue to love with such passion as to retire even at the house of a friend, renounce the charms of an elegant assembly, and find not any pleasure but in solitude, and the ”society of each other.</Q> The laugh was universal, except on the part of the unfortunate pair, at whose expence it was raised; and they retired in confusion amidst the jibes and jests of their ac∣quaintance, whose follies, were they equally held up, might perhaps be as laughable as those of the present objects of their mirth and ridicule.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="37" REF="30"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY VII.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now return to the convent, and see in what manner Mademoi∣selle D'Urbin passed her time, in a situa∣tion so entirely new to her, and the no∣velty by no means a pleasing one, as there cannot possibly be a greater misfor∣tune to a young female, just flattered into beauty, than to have none but her own sex the insipid witnesses to the improve∣ment of her charms; and the brightest eyes have not the least influence over black veils and white forehead cloths. Mademoiselle D'Urbin had the severe mortification of proving the truth of this assertion; and her usual spirits became so depressed by this total seclusion from the world, that she lost all chearfulness, health, and appetite, for several weeks;
<PB N="38" REF="31"/>but at length a desire of amusement and the love for mischief getting the better of her dejection, she formed a charitable design of diverting herself by tormenting the nuns, and instantly practised every device, art and imagination could sug∣gest; and being secure of the assistance of every boarder in the convent in this laudable undertaking, she committed perpetual thefts and depredations in the fruit garden, till at last her frequent plunders had reduced them to despair; the garden to a desart; and the holy di∣rectors of their conscience went sighing home without any prospect of their desert for their summer, or sweetmeats for their winter collation. In short, it would be tedious to enumerate half the whimsi∣cal tricks she played them; I shall therefore confine myself to one, as it was of a singular nature, and the poor
<PB N="39" REF="32"/>nuns considered it as so truly wicked and abominable, that they concluded it could only have been inspired by the very demon of mischief. Any person who has the least knowledge of the austerities im∣posed on the nuns who profess exemplary piety, cannot be a stranger to the well-known custom of their assembling once in the week, to give themselves the disci∣pline; and that the hour for this awful ceremory is in the night; the place a large hall; where they are no sooner met together than the lights are put out, and uncovering their shoulders, they wait in solemn silence and mental ejaculation the signal to begin a penance, so entirely repugnant to human nature. One night when they were met on this occasion, and the nuns were executing their pen∣nance with a most fervent and astonishing zeal, whilst the blows resounding through the vaulted roof filled the devout soul
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="39" REF="34"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="40" REF="35"/>with holy horror, and made the timid rejoice in darkness, lest the blood trick∣ling from their wounds should shock the eye of humanity; just in the midst of this dreadful scene (when the blows were the loudest, and sighs and growns issued from every sufferer's bosom) on a sudden, to the consternation of all present, several pieces of wax lights, forming a kind of chandelier, were let down at once through a sky light at the top of the hall, by which a mystery, never intended to be revealed, was discovered, and these devout enthusiasts, or rather impostors, were beheld striking the most terrible blows on the walls, pillars, and even on the seats which surrounded them; but their own shoulders untouched. A discovery this, the more distressing, as the secret had been hitherto safely kept, and the convent renowned for sanctity and devotion from its first institution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="41" REF="36"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY VIII.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus disposed of Ma∣demoiselle D'Urbin, the old Ba∣roness began to pass her time more plea∣santly, and thought herself so much more attended to by the men than when her rival daughter was present, that she sincerely regretted her residence at the convent could be only temporary; and that her fortune was too large for the Ba∣ron to consent to her ever taking the veil: as it was therefore impossible to hope she should ever seclude Mademoiselle D'Ur∣bin entirely from the world, she deter∣mined to marry her as soon as possible, to avoid the disagreeable necessity of her again becoming her companion at her re∣turn. A change of name would, she flattered herself, render their relationship
<PB N="42" REF="37"/>less conspicuous, as it was to be presum∣ed (being both well-bred women) they might then meet in the same parties without ever being suspected to be mo∣ther and daughter. Full of this idea, she began to look round on the young men of fashion for a proper husband for Mademoiselle D'Urbin; and hearing from a friend that the Marquis D'Illois in∣tended to marry, she contrived the very next day to have proposals made to him for her daughter. The Marquis having been long the favourite of all those fashionable women whose good graces are the pride of fools, and despised by men of sense, fancied himself wearied in the labyrinth of folly, and was resolved to exchange the flowery bands of love for the ada∣mantine fetters of Hymen: he was not a stranger to the fortune and connections of the Baron, and received these advan∣ces
<PB N="43" REF="38"/>with transport. Mademoiselle D'Ur∣bin was likewise, on her part, perfectly overjoyed when she was informed of the Baroness her mother's determination: she had so often talked with her young companions on marriage, that she longed very sincerely for the day that would at once set her at liberty from the convent, and render her mistress of her own actions. On the meeting of the Mar∣quis and the Baron, every thing seemed to concur to favour her wishes; the rent roll of the Marquis answered every paren∣tal expectation, and the demanded set∣tlement was most readily agreed to on his part; in short, this important affair was nearly brought to a conclusion be∣fore they ever recollected that one es∣sential point had been neglected, and that the future husband and wife had as yet never seen each other:
<PB N="44" REF="39"/>this, however, was a trifle easily rectified, as it was impossible either of them could form the least objection to so eli∣gible a plan; for any woman who had youth, beauty, fortune, and novelty, must be approved by the Marquis: and the Baroness well knew her daughter would marry any man for title, equipage, and liberty. It was therefore agreed, by both the Baron and Baroness, that it would be quite sufficient if for form sake the young people were introduced to each other the evening before they were to be united for life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="45" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marquis D'Illois, to whom the hand of Mademoiselle D'Urbin was destined, resembled, in the mere out∣lines of his character, most other young noblemen: his fashionable follies were his principal merit; and to ornament his person with taste and elegance, his con∣stant attention and daily study; he fre∣quented every place of public amuse∣ment as well as private assembly, and with an air of smiling self-satisfaction, ex∣hibited his dress, rings, snuff-box, and double repeaters, with all the fashionable graces of insignificance; he profest the art of dazzling the understanding by the volu∣bility of his conversation and rapidity of his eloquence; and though he every day re∣peated the same things on the same subjects,
<PB N="46" REF="41"/>yet they were uttered so gracefully, and in terms so varied, that those who heard them scarce observed they were but a re∣petition of what they had heard the day before; he was besides complete master of that rotation of unmeaning words, or fashionable jargon, which may properly be called the technical terms of po∣lite society; yet, in the midst of absur∣dities and inconsistency, the discerning eye accustomed to read the human heart, might have traced that this was not the real character of the Marquis, and that he was not formed by nature to be the contemptible being he thus strange∣ly affected, but had for his innate prin∣ciples so much honor, humanity, grati∣titude, and benevolence, that he was ashamed of his disposition: yet having been early initiated into life, these vulgarities were soon suppressed; and
<PB N="47" REF="42"/>at the time Mademoiselle D'Urbin was proposed to him, he was become such an adept in dissipation, that he had very few such struggles to combat with; he piqued himself (contradictory as it may appear) on taste and knowledge; but it was impossible to determine what was his peculiar talent; for such were the variety and mutability of his ideas, that the most opposite passions succeeded each other with such an asto∣nishing quickness, that his most intimate friends knew not what was his particular pursuit; each by turns was followed with the utmost eagerness of expectation, and continued till some new caprice influenced all his actions, which were again in turn neglected for others which appeared more new and captivating.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="48" REF="43"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY X.</HEAD>
<P>AMIDST these variety of passions, one of the first the Marquis in∣dulged, was for horses; his stables were filled with the finest that could be pro∣cured; and if the persons who bought them were deceived in their goodness, at least none cost more: for this he carried so far, that he would much rather mort∣gage an estate, or sell a farm, than be disappointed in the purchase of a set he took a fancy to: each colour became his favourite by turns; one while none but white were to be admitted into his stud, and then none but the roan; if either of those colours were brought him to pur∣chase, he would instantly determine to be drawn only by those of the most beautiful black: his carriages and har∣ness
<PB N="49" REF="44"/>for elegance, taste and lightness, were the wonder of all Paris; and the astonishing gazers, when they saw them bound along the streets, were lost in ad∣miration at the <HI>tout ensemble</HI> of his splen∣dor and magnificence; and so enrap∣tured was the Marquis with excelling in this particular, that he frequently in∣terrupted his most florid harangues, bright similies, and elegant comparisons, to cele∣brate the merit of his coach-maker, the neatness of his jockies, and the immense prices of his sadler.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY XI.</HEAD>
<P>DOGS (soon after) took place of horses in the Marquis's amuse∣ments: besides those destined for the sports of the field, the house was filled with numbers of every other kind, of all sizes, ages, breed, and colours; in short, he might be properly termed the protector and Maecenas of the canine race: but, to be worthy of admission, they must either have beauty, or be emi∣nently distinguished for some talents; they must either dance, play tricks, present a paw with a graceful air, or have been tutored by the most famous masters in dog education, and then they, in the Marquis's present opinion, surpassed in humour and entertainment the most cele∣brated
<PB N="51" REF="46"/>wits; and the owners who could procure him dogs not larger than a kit∣ten, with ears touching the ground, and eyes buried in a forest of long hair, might command any price of him; and if they barked in harmony, or knew how to growl a tolerable tenor, they were consi∣dered by him as invaluable.</P>

<P>THIS pursuit was soon succeeded by another, which now engaged the whole time and attention of the Marquis, and he employed himself in collecting and arranging a great number of butter∣flies, with the most unwearied assiduity; and, at a considerable expence, was so for∣tunate as to obtain a number sufficient to fill two large elegant glass cases, forming the sides of a cabinet in so pleasing a manner, that the curious eye wandered with pleasure over so beautiful an assem∣blage of colours. Here the delighted Marquis passed whole days in contem∣plating with rapture those wings which displayed all the different hues and lustre of the rainbow; he admired the wonder∣ful productions of nature, equally perfect
<PB N="53" REF="48"/>in her minutest work, and exact in the scale of insect as animal creation. I will not pretend to aver that these were ab∣solutely the reflections of the Marquis; but certain it is, he might have made these and many others, since he passed whole hours, and even days, shut up with his darling butterflies; and so strong were their influence on the force of his imagination, that he thought of nothing but butterflies—talked only on butter∣flies; and so partial was he, that he even found out likenesses between several of his most favourite friends and butter∣flies, and never, since he had been blessed with ideas, had the Marquis formed a more just comparison.</P>

Nothing can give an adequate idea of the richness and beauty of the apartments, unless the fancied habitations of the fairies and genii; every ornament, taste, luxury and

<P>THE hotel of the Marquis was scarce become the admiration and envy of all Paris, before it was entirely aban∣doned by him, and the furniture sold for a sixth of the value; yet this arose not from any pecuniary disappointment or derangement in his affairs, but he had altered his plan of life, and chose to live in the country. <Q>The beautiful object “of unadorned nature (said he) is the only one that can be long agreeable to a sensible mind: man, confined with∣in the walls of a city, can only be said to vegetate in a splendid prison, and scarcely enjoy the light of the sun. I am determined to quit this dissipated herd of unthinking mortals, and en∣joy in a pure and clear sky that calm
<PB N="58" REF="53"/>tranquility for which we were origi∣nally ”designed.</Q> With this intention he went immediately to one of his seats, a considerable distance from Paris, and passed a whole week in solitude; at length he with pleasure observed, how greatly his retreat might be embellished by taste; he employed a great number of workmen, and in a short time the <HI>par∣terre</HI> took a new form from a plan drawn by himself; forests were destroyed, and laid down into lawns; every day the rus∣ticks beheld the most astonishing revolu∣tions; mountains were transformed into dales, and vallies into rivers; after these were finished, the culture of his garden became his study; with a spade in his hand, he would endeavour to vie in strength with the most robust labourer, but the delicacy of his constitution was ill adapted to support fatigue; he
<PB N="59" REF="54"/>was soon obliged to give up the active part, and amufe himself with the culture of flowers; but the perfume of the rose, the fairness of the lily, the enamel of the pink, or modest sweetness of the jessa∣mine, had not any charms for him; he prized only tulips variegated to a fright∣ful degree, or other flowers of great price, which might be deemed monsters in na∣ture from their ugliness and scarcity, and were too costly to be gathered, and too void of scent and beauty to be worn.</P>

<P>THE approach of winter, or rather an alteration of sentiment, induced the Marquis to revisit Paris, which he had quitted so lately with such abhor∣rence; but the deprivation of pleasures had reconciled him to the enjoyment of them, and the rapid movement of his chaise wheels scarce kept time with his impatience. <Q>How melancholy (said “the Marquis) is the life of a human being in the country, without friends, without that social intercourse which alone can render time supportable— time, which in solitude is the greatest of all tyrants, since there, it seems im∣mortal without a possibility of killing it; but in Paris, whole days pass away unperceived, merely in the engaging
<PB N="61" REF="56"/>pleasure of seeing and being seen, whilst reflection is lost in the whirl of amusement, and we are spared the insufferable fatigue of thinking, which ”is intolerable.</Q> The Marquis con∣tinued his mental soliloquy, much in the same manner, till he found himself in one of the principal streets of Paris; he passed a great number of new elegant carriages, but was infinitely surprised when the coachmen, who drove them, nodded to him, with the familiarity of old acquaintance; at length one carriage more particularly attracted his eye from the brilliancy of its appearance and sin∣gularity of make; as it passed the cha∣rioteer addrest him with, <Q>Good mor∣row, “Marquis; where the devil have you been for these thousand years? You see I am become a very tolerable ”coachman; I —</Q> he would have
<PB N="62" REF="57"/>proceeded, but a stone caught the wheel and overturned the carriage: humanity prompted the Marquis to stop and en∣quire whether he was hurt, but how was he surprised to find on a nearer examina∣tion the coachman to be the Duke of ***, who by this accident had dislocated one of his limbs, and was covered with bruises; the Marquis gazed on him with astonishment, perfectly at a loss to com∣prehend the reason of this metamorphose; and as it may seem rather extraordinary to the reader, it will be necessary to pre∣mise, that during the six months volun∣tary exile of the Marquis, many had been the fashionable revolutions in carriages, and, amidst their absurdities, the young men had adopted that of coachmanship; for this purpose one of them invented a carriage, to which (by way of describing its excellence and singularity in one word)
<PB N="63" REF="58"/>he gave the name of a devil: in the body of this machine were generally two ser∣vants lolling at their ease, whilst the master drove on a seat placed in front. The Marquis was no sooner informed that so pleasing a science was become ne∣cessary to finish the education of a fine gentleman, than it became his wish to perfect himself in the art immediately; and lest the world should suppose him dwindled into a sober, dull country gen∣tleman, he instantly bespoke the most elegant devil that had been seen; took lessons from the most expert of his coachmen, and by dint of genius and assiduity, in less than a fortnight, drove the devil himself through all the streets in Paris; and it is ever to be lamented that the swiftness and velocity with which it passed, prevented a perfect sight of so graceful a coachman, for all must
<PB N="64" REF="59"/>have been charmed with the martial air with which he held the reins; two tall fellows, with variegated feathers in their hats, were seated in the back, whilst the Marquis in front with an amazing <HI>bouquet,</HI> drest in every particular like the perso∣nage he meant to represent, excited the speed of his horses by the crack of his whip, and the most coachman-like lan∣guage, proud of his appearance as a Roman Emperor in a triumphal proces∣cession. The great skill and wonderful address of the Marquis became the topic of general conversation, and talents so distinguished drove all the inferior phae∣tons to despair.</P>

<P>THIS general ardour for fame which seemed to threaten the entire expul∣sion of the ancient society of coachmen, subsided in a short time, and the young nobility once more permitted them to resume their seats unmolested, and only reserved to themselves the privilege of displacing on particular occasions: this cessation gave the Marquis leisure to dis∣cover an accomplishment he was before unconscious he possessed, which was great taste for antiquities of all kinds, but medals and statues in particular; he applauded himself on his discernment, and prepared to indulge this passion in the fullest extent, by the purchase of several of those old blocks of marble which pass under the denomination of mutilated sta∣tues;
<PB N="66" REF="61"/>and if he could procure those with∣out either arms, legs, or even head, he was easily persuaded to believe them trea∣sures formed by the chissel of the great masters of sculpture: he filled drawers with a vast quantity of medals collected at great expence, and spared not any cost to obtain scarce coins; but as the most laudable endeavours do not always ensure success, it frequently happened that those medals for which the Marquis had given large sums, proved on the inspection of the real virtuosi, to be nothing more than old brass and copper counters, which having been for years neglected and treat∣ed by their owners with contempt, were almost entirely defaced; and as they hard∣ly retained any impression, were supposed by the Marquis to have been struck in the reign of some of the first Emperors of Rome.</P>

<P>AMIDST such grave and wise re∣searches into the annals of anti∣quity, and honoured with the society of men of the most profound erudition, it is next to a miracle the Marquis had suf∣ficient leisure to form a design to marry; but though surrounded with monuments of antient grandeur (in all that magnifi∣cence of decay, which renders them so interesting to a man of taste) he found still something wanting to complete his happiness, therefore resolved to unite the blooming modern to the <HI>vért antique,</HI> and though personally a stranger to Made∣moiselle D'Urbin, he was transported with the idea of possessing a bride adorn∣ed both with beauty and the gifts of fortune; and so strongly was his imagi∣nation impressed with the felicity he should enjoy in the married state, that
<PB N="68" REF="63"/>the antient beauty, Poppea, soon lost her charms: he ceased to be the faithful platonic adorer of Julia, Plautina, and Cleopatra, and neglected all those Othos which had cost him so dear. A very un∣expected accident, however, prevented the completion of his wishes, owing to the old Baroness, who suddenly disco∣vered he was too amiable for a son in law, and who admired his fine taste in dress, his talent for repartee, and the graces of his figure, till she conceived the most violent passion for him; and the fear of losing the object of her ten∣derness so far prevailed, that she on diffe∣rent pretences delayed his introduction to her daughter, and even endeavoured to persuade the Marquis that Mademoi∣selle D'Urbin was too young to be a wife, though at other times, to disguise her own age, she strongly affirmed that herself was much younger when she be∣came a mother.</P>

<P>THE Marquis might well be asto∣nished when he heard the Baroness give this reason for declining a match first proposed at her own request; but Monsieur D'Illois, being tolerably con∣versant in the caprices of fine ladies, and judging the Baroness might be of a disposition variable as his own, he con∣cluded so absurd an objection would not be a lasting one, and therefore redoubled his assiduity and attention to the old lady, in hopes of regaining her favour. The Baroness, who saw him chearful under this delay, imputed it to an indifference to matrimony, or an attachment elsewhere, and though she would not have been dis∣pleased on being certain it was the first, yet she was fired with jealousy on the
<PB N="70" REF="65"/>supposition that it might be the second; she therefore placed spies on the conduct and actions of the Marquis, learnt all his engagements, and with whom; and as it so happened (just at that time) found it impossible to discover the least partiality to any particular object; from this, and the respect and politeness with which he treated her, she believed herself the object of his affection, and waited the declara∣tion of his passion with impatience, and generously determined not to drive such a lover to despair; in consequence of this resolution she one day when they were <HI>téte à téte,</HI> made him such extraordinary advances as could not be mistaken; and the Marquis being fond of a frolic, it is impossible to say how far his love of the marvellous might have induced him to proceed, had he not recollected that his complaisance for the mother would raise
<PB N="71" REF="66"/>an inseparable barrier to his alliance with the daughter; he therefore muttered a few incoherent words, and abruptly re∣tired in confusion, and left the Baroness in such a rage that she could have killed him; tears at length came to her relief, and the return of her reason made her see the necessity of concealing both her re∣sentment and the cause of it from the world.</P>

<P>THE Marquis still earnestly wishing the alliance to take place, ventured to present himself at the Baron's a few days after, hoping his abrupt departure was by that time either forgot or for∣given: Madam D'Urbin, who did not expect he would dare to appear before her, reddened, and turned pale alternately with anger and surprise; the Marquis would not seem to observe her emotion, but attempting to take her hand, "Lovely Baroness" (said he) <Q>how “cruel were you to put my constancy to so severe a trial, a temptation too great for any one to resist, unless his heart were guarded like mine with the idea of your beautiful daughter, whom my fancy delights to paint the exact
<PB N="73" REF="68"/>resemblance of yourself, and let me caution you against so dangerous a test for the future, as to see you and ”adore you are the same.</Q> This flat∣tery, far from producing the effect in∣tended by the Marquis, encreased the anger of the Baroness; "Cease, Sir," said she, <Q>from this moment, your un∣availing “pretensions to Mademoiselle D'Urbin, for be assured I never will give my consent to this union; spare yourself therefore unnecessary trouble: this is my final determination, and the last visit I will ever receive from ”you on this or any other subject.</Q> She then left him without deigning to listen to his entreaties, and the Marquis retired, fully convinced that he had not at present the least prospect of making his peace.</P>

<P>THE Marquis, to divert his chagrin, one day took up an old worm-eaten book, which was a dissertation on the art of making gold; and the whole process appeared to him so clearly illus∣trated, and the method so exactly ex∣plained, that being entirely satisfied in himself that the transmutation of metals might be by dint of application obtained, he resolved to become an alchymist, and therefore furnished a laboratory the follow∣ing week, filled it with crucibles, a furnace, &amp;c. and worked in it from morning to night with the most indefatigable indus∣try; he rose each morning with the dawn in full hopes that he should on that day accomplish his grand design, and though he retired to rest disappointed, yet con∣stantly
<PB N="75" REF="70"/>believed the succeeding one would certainly prove more fortunate to his wishes; but vain were his endeavours, for though he exactly kept up the fire to the due degree of heat, the lead (to his utter astonishment) far from becoming gold, remained mere lead, or what was still worse, was reduced to nothing: the Marquis did not however despair, but attributed his ill success to want of skill, and when so great an end was to be ob∣tained, determined not to be discouraged by a few disappointments; to reward his perseverance, at last, the long expected signs appeared, which proved incontesti∣bly that the vilest of all metals was on the point of becoming gold; trembling and agitated his heart palpitated with joy; he took the boiling liquor from the fire that it might condense in a proper manner, and watched it with the eyes of
<PB N="76" REF="71"/>eager attention and anxiety; but just as it was on the point of perfection, a servant came in hastily to acquaint him, a strang∣er requested with the utmost earnestness to speak to him immediately; the Mar∣quis, vexed to be interrupted in a mo∣ment of such consequence, turned about angrily to reprove the fellow for his in∣trusion, and with his elbow threw down the vase which contained his long wished for treasure: when he saw this precious liquor on the floor, who can describe his rage! he absolutely tore his hair, wrung his hands, and only recovered the use of speech to bestow curses and imprecations on the trembling cause of all this mis∣chief, who terrified by his menaces, re∣tired in hopes of escaping the fury of his incensed master.</P>

<P>THE loud anger and reproaches of the Marquis were overheard by the person whose desire of admission had been the cause of this misfortune, and who finding from this altercation he had lost all probability of being introduced in a proper manner, entered hastily without any introduction at all, and approaching the Marquis with great gravity; <Q>Con∣sole “yourself (said he) I come to re∣pair your loss; that treasure you are seeking with such labour and expence ”I already possess.</Q> At these words the Marquis grew more calm. <Q>Is it “then possible (said he to the philoso∣pher) that I really behold the happy master of so miraculous a science? I am, indeed, (returned the stranger)
<PB N="78" REF="73"/>the real possessor of those wonderful powers of chymistry, the philosophers stone, the water of immortality, and a thousand other secrets equally sur∣prising, such as the quadrature of the circle, the long sought for longitude, and the perpetual motion; all which I shall not scruple hereafter to discover to you, but shall at present confine myself to the object of your pursuit, the art of making gold, which the vulgar and prophane look upon as a chimera, but the more enlarged mind of the philosopher is conscious of its reality; enabled from study to develope the operations of nature, he knows that it is fabricated every hour in the bowels of the earth, and thus it is equally certain, that this precious me∣tal is composed of other metals, meta∣morphosed into gold by a simple
<PB N="79" REF="74"/>transmutation: let therefore a man but once become acquainted with the de∣gree of heat with which nature changes lead and iron into gold, and nothing can be easier or more simple than being master of the power of doing it when he pleases, and becoming pos∣sessed of the riches of the universe; and that I have made this discovery, I will now prove to you beyond a possi∣bility ”of doubt.</Q> Having ended this long harangue, of the truth of which the Marquis seemed perfectly convinced; (indeed, how could he possibly be other∣wise, after hearing it so clearly and phi∣losophically demonstrated?) the learned stranger took a small crucible, and put∣ting it on the furnace, he filled it with lead, and when that was melted, he put in a small quantity of yellow powder; <Q>“This powder (said he to the Marquis,
<PB N="80" REF="75"/>who surveyed him with the utmost at∣tention) is transmuted gold, one single grain of which to change all this lead to gold, since it is, as I may say, the first principle or seed of that precious metal, which by fermentation takes from iron and lead the grosser parti∣cles, purifies and dissolves the matter which encloses it, and prevents it ”from appearing what it really is.</Q> As he spoke he kept shaking the furnace, and soon after reversing the crucible on the coals, he ordered the Marquis to take it up; he obeyed with great alacrity, and found at the bottom an ingot of pure gold; he surveyed it accurately, and cer∣tain of its reality he fell at the feet of the alchymist; <Q>Great philosopher (said he) “I am lost in wonder! how great is the extent of your knowledge! the ”riches of all nature are your own!</Q>
<PB N="81" REF="76"/>The appearance of the stranger, how∣ever, but ill corresponded with so ex∣tensive a power; for his hair uncombed and unpowdered hung quite strait over his ears, whilst a thread-bare coat that had once been black, reached down in tatters to his heels. <Q>I am resolved “(said he to the Marquis, raising him with great gravity) to augment your for∣tune so considerably, that you shall enjoy every wish of your heart; live in a state of pleasure and magnifi∣cence, and be enabled to relieve every distressed object without suffering the least pecuniary inconvenience: for this purpose I will teach you the art of making this powder; but as it is composed of many scarce and valuable ingredients, which cannot be procured by any one but myself, (and happen∣ing through indolence to have neg∣lected
<PB N="82" REF="77"/>to supply myself with a sum sufficient) I must request you to ad∣vance fifty louis for the purchase of them, and I will be here early in the morning with every thing pro∣per for our purpose; but great secresy will be required in this affair, lest we excite the covetous disposition of men ”to envy our success.</Q> The Marquis, in the transport of his heart, pulled out his purse, and with the most boundless confidence gave him an hundred instead of fifty louis, and passed the whole sleep∣less night in reflecting on his imaginary riches; he rose with impatience at the break of day, and waited with the ut∣most anxiety the return of the philoso∣pher, who most probably, by the aid of the liberality of the Marquis, passed his time much more agreeably, and in∣deed so much to his satisfaction, that he
<PB N="83" REF="78"/>never returned any more, and Monsieur D'Illois was at length constrained to acknowledge, that he had been the dupe of a designing knave, who had imposed on his credulity by the mere common trick of a juggler, who had adroitly placed the gold under the crucible when he overturned it.</P>

They were astonished that Monsieur D'Illois <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one should be constantly present to her disturbed imagination, yet looked upon her anxiety, on his account, as the mere <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andering of fancy, joined to inquietude <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the absence of her future son-in-law; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hilst the Baron, who thought himself in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitely more sagacious, (whilst in fact he was infinitely more mistaken) wisely concluded that it proceeded from the

Monsieur D'Urbin received him with great politeness, and even ap∣peared extremely pleased that Mademoi∣selle D'Urbin was still the object of his wishes; he promised him their union should take place as soon as decency would permit the celebration of their nuptials; but the apparent sincerity of
<PB N="88" REF="83"/>these professions (which by no means were intended to be speedily performed) was only meant to silence the present importuni∣ty of the Marquis; for every moment of the Baron's time was at this period devoted to a beautiful widow, who engrossed his time so entirely, that he had neither leisure nor inclination to attend to the de∣sire the Marquis shewed to be introduced to his daughter; and Monsieur D'Illois, finding he was obliged to conform to this delay made under pretence of re∣spect to form and ceremony, was deter∣mined once more to wait with patience the result of the Baron's caprice.</P>

<PB N="94" REF="89"/>"Siege of Troy; he read it with great emphasis and action, accompanied with an air of self-applause, with a smile at the end of each metaphor, and a look di∣rected towards the Marquis, where he thought the passage demanded approba∣tion; yet, however great the inclination of the Marquis to appear attentive, at the end of the third scene of the first act he fell asleep, in spite of all his endeavours to pre∣vent it, but still waked at intervals, crying, "Bravo! bravo!" and then had the goodness to apologize for shutting his eyes, by saying <Q>He found that it strengthened “”his attention.</Q> He waked time enough just to hear the catastrophe, and addressing himself to the author, "I admire (said he) <Q>your tragedy, and it cannot fail of “being well received, for your scenes are well decorated, your characters are all kings and heroes, and must therefore
<PB N="95" REF="90"/>be magnificently dressed; there are a crowd of guards, a number of priests, a long procession, impassioned lovers, and striking attitudes, all these make up the sublimity and stage effect which constitutes the absolute perfection of modern tragedy; and I will pawn my ”honour on your success.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“ALAS! my Lord, (said the au∣thor with a sigh) such is the partiality and insolence of managers, and the general depravation of taste, that the merit of a piece is not suffici∣ent to ensure its reception at the thea∣tre; for unless it also meets with the approbation of the players, it is impos∣sible to get it played, however great the abilities of the author: in fine, my Lord, the stage can never arrive to any degree of perfection so long as it is to be influenced by so strong a par∣tiality; managers ought not to be per∣mitted to take their choice, and select public representations according to their own caprice; on the contrary, they ought to be under so wise a regu∣lation,
<PB N="97" REF="92"/>that they should be obliged to get up every piece presented to them, and let it be fairly judged of by an au∣dience, whose verdict is generally a just one; and if you will honour me with your protection so far as once to get it on the stage, I have not the least fear of meeting with favour and even applause from the awful senate of the people, who, I doubt not, will be extremely propitious to a tragedy ”like mine.</Q></P>

<P>FLATTERED by this application, the Marquis determined to write a letter of recommendation for the poet to the manager, desiring him as a favour to receive the piece: the defe∣rence and respect due to the rank of Monsieur D'Illois procured the tragedy an immediate reading, rehearsal, and re∣presentation, in preference to the pro∣ductions of some unfortunate authors, who had waited five or six seasons the event of the manager's promises; and no sooner was it known how very suc∣cessful the application of the Marquis had been, than eleven authors attended his levee in the course of the following week, with not less than two or three dramatic productions each, the merit, of which, doubtless, at least equalled that he had so openly patronized.</P>

Monsieur D'Illois returned home extremely mortified at the ill success of the tragedy, for he had con∣ceived that his having espoused the cause of the poet was sufficient, not only to have rescued the piece from condem∣nation, but have made it fashionable both to see and approve it: chagrined by this disappointment, he resolved never more to expose himself to so severe a mor∣tification, and instantly shut his doors against every member of his literary so∣ciety;
<PB N="100" REF="95"/>declared publickly that reading and writing gave him the head ach, and were too laborious for the nerves of a man of fashion; strictly commanded the Swiss not only positively never to admit the unfortunate author, but to deny him ab∣solutely to every shabby-looking man with an humble address and insinuating tone, whose pockets appeared to be full of paper; having thus given up every idea of writing either in verse or prose, he took such a dislike to his library that all those beautiful volumes which had so lately been purchased at such an immoderate expence, were sold for less than half price; an event which seldom happens, at least during the life of the purchaser.</P>

<P>IN the short period of time in which the Marquis was a <HI>bel esprit,</HI> he formed an intimacy with a young man of fashion called the Chevalier de Croud, his fortune was large, but his prodigality still greater, and he affected the character of being generous to a most extravagant degree; he piqued himself (like Mon∣sieur D'Illois) on being a genius, and an admirer of the arts and sciences: in short, a similarity of sentiment, passions, and follies rendered them in a short time in∣separable.</P>

<P>DURING the course of their intimacy, the Marquis was fre∣quently admitted to the elegant <HI>petits soupers</HI> given by the Chevalier to a few friends, and a mistress on whom he doat∣ed; the beauty who held him a willing captive in her chains, was the celebrated Madame De T***, more famous for the multiplicity of her lovers than her charms; she never was satisfied with less than the entire ruin of those who professed themselves attached to her; and so extremely expeditious was she in acce∣lerating it, that few financiers could af∣ford to keep her more than a month; yet so fashionable was it to possess her, for even a short time, that many young men purchased that honour with their whole fortune. One might be led to
<PB N="103" REF="98"/>suppose, from the folly of her admirers, that she had at least the short-lived per∣fection of being a finished beauty; but she had many personal defects: her eyes were much too small, and only attractive from their lustre; her mouth so large it would have been absolutely disgusting had it not been ornamented with a very beautiful set of teeth; she was large in her shape, and too fat to have the least pre∣tensions to grace, but had a freedom and boldness in her manner, which her ad∣mirers dignified with the name of vivacity; her complexion was fair, her hands and arms tolerably white, and so small as not to be in proportion to the rest of her figure, which formed a singular, (and, by no means, a pleasing) contrast with the thickness of her waist; her wit consisted in a few satirical comparisons, and a sufficient share of art to deceive
<PB N="104" REF="99"/>those who were credulous enough to place confidence in her. The accomplishments of this amiable female were limited to humming a few passionate songs; the most perfect comprehension of a <HI>double entendre,</HI> and in writing letters of tender∣ness or disdain as best suited her purpose and the disposition of the lover she meant to deceive.</P>

<P>THE Chevalier De Croud was ever eloquent in the praises of his be∣loved De T***. <Q>Love (said he to the “Marquis) is the source of my happi∣ness; I adore the charming Flora, and ”will never quit her whilst I have life.</Q> The Marquis answered not a word, but was pensive and confused: from the time he had been introduced to this Syren, he became melancholy and unhappy; the Chevalier observed some secret uneasi∣ness preyed upon his mind, and pressed him to disclose it, with all the earnest∣ness of friendship, but in vain, 'till at length overcome by repeated persuasion, and wearied by importunity, he confessed that he was enamoured with the beautiful Flora: the Chevalier surprized, now be∣came
<PB N="106" REF="101"/>came thoughtful in turn, and left the Marquis without saying a word. Three or four days elapsed without their meet∣ing at any of the places at which they were accustomed to see each other; and though Monsieur D'Illois had frequently, during that space of time, called on the Chevalier, he was never so fortunate as to meet with him at home. On the fourth morning he came to the Marquis, <Q>Forgive me, my dear friend, (said De “Croud) I have been much indisposed, and had given my Swiss general or∣ders to be denied to every one, yet never once supposed he could be so very stupid as to imagine those orders could possibly extend to you.

<PB N="107" REF="102"/>He was no sooner gone than the Marquis flew on the wings of love to execute this commission; when he had delivered the letter, the nymph who supposed it contained nothing more than vows of con∣stancy, and ane ulogium on her charms, broke the seal and read aloud the follow∣ing lines to the astonished Marquis:
<LETTER>

That I may no longer be an obstacle to the wishes of my friend, I release you from your engagement to me, re∣store you to yourself, and conjure you to listen to the terms the Marquis has to propose; and if his offers are not equal to your expectation, let me know, and I will make any addition that will prevail on you to bless him with the transports you have bestowed ”on the</Q></P>

<P>EQUALLY charmed with each other, the terms of the Marquis were quickly agreed to, and he had the satisfaction to find that this change of lovers was not only perfectly agreeable to the fair Flora, but received from her the most sacred assurances that she had long wished that such an event might take place, as he had, from the very first moment she saw him, inspired her with sensations she had never before experienced for any man. Overjoyed by this very unex∣pected declaration, he offered her a <HI>carte blanche</HI> of his whole fortune, which she would doubtless have been glad to ac∣cept, had she not (very fortunately for Monsieur d'Illois) thought it most pru∣dent, with so generous a lover, to play off
<PB N="111" REF="106"/>the masked batteries of sentimental love and disinterested affection; however, the present exigency of her affairs (much, she declared, against her inclination) obliged her to stipulate for a hundred louis next morning, and the same sum to be regu∣larly paid every month, without including jewels or other presents; the first month to be advanced with the hundred she was to receive the next day. These condi∣tions were chearfully assented to by the Marquis; and the lady's generosity and confidence in his honour was such, that she gave credit to his promise of paying the money the next morning, and per∣mitted him to pass the night in her apartment.</P>

<P>THE Marquis did not return home 'till noon, and then made a point of instantly discharging the debt he had contracted; he therefore gave two hun∣dred louis to the valet, whom he honoured with his confidence, and ordered him to carry them directly to Madame de T***. The person entrusted with this commission, was a tall, well-made young man of twenty-three, with all the ruddy graces of youth, and by no means a novice in gallantry; he had often seen this cele∣brated toast, and found her so much to his taste, that he had frequently envied those who could afford to purchase her good graces; but as there was not the least probability that he should ever be rich enough to obtain the smallest share
<PB N="113" REF="108"/>of her favour, he had hitherto very wisely kept his wishes a secret: opportunity now, however, seemed to smile upon him, and he resolved to execute a very bold design; he dressed his hair in the most fashionable and becoming stile, put on one of the Marquis's most elegant suits, and with the airs of a man of the first distinction, went in a chair to the house of the charmer, and was announced as a stranger of quality, who had a secret of importance to communicate to Ma∣dame De T***; the lady was too well used to such kind of confidential friends, not to readily guess what he wished to im∣part, and granted his Lordship an immedi∣ate audience; and the Valet de Chambre was introduced, who being really handsome, played the enraptured nobleman with so much art, offered the two hundred louis
<PB N="114" REF="109"/>with so much grace, and so very <HI>àpròpos,</HI> that few such ladies could have resisted the temptation. Flora confessed herself cap∣tivated at first sight by his personal at∣tractions, and the fortunate <HI>Jasmin</HI> had no longer reason to envy Monsieur D'Illois.</P>

<P>WHILST thus the Valet was at once enjoying the triumph of possessing his mistress, and deceiving his master, Flora was calculating that the two hundred louis she had thus un∣expectedly obtained, would make four when added to those the Marquis had promised to send her in a few hours: these were their different ideas, when her maid ran hastily into the room, and told her that Monsieur D'Illois was coming up the stairs. Never was any woman more embarrassed than the faithful Flora: how was it possible she could conduct herself with propriety in so critical a situation, between the two lovers? The stranger, from his magnificent present, was cer∣tainly
<PB N="116" REF="111"/>intitled to be treated with respect; and from the brilliant promises of the Marquis, she had every thing to hope; and if either convicted her of infidelity, she might lose both; she therefore ad∣dressed herself to his Lordship, and re∣quested, with the most earnest intreaties, he would deign to hide himself under the bed, lest he should be perceived by a jealous coxcomb, who tormented her with his caresses, but who had long been the object of her dislike, though she was for particular reasons obliged to disguise her hatred. The poor Valet, who wished to be hid from his master as much as she could possibly wish to conceal him, crept hastily under the bed, extremely glad that she had given him so fair an oppor∣tunity to escape the fury of the Marquis; and Flora, relieved from her fears, met
<PB N="117" REF="112"/>Monsieur D'Illois with the utmost gaiety, embraced him with every demonstra∣tion of the most ardent affection; and the happy Marquis had not the least doubt but his perfections had inspired the bosom of this celebrated beauty with real and disinterested love.</P>

<P>THE artful blandishments of Flora, encreased the passion of her cre∣dulous admirer; but unfortunately in the midst of their endearments, she pretend∣ed to fear she had more reason to attribute this visit to his punctuality in bringing the two hundred louis, rather than a proof of his affection. <Q>What! “(cried the astonished Marquis) can it be possible that you have not yet re∣ceived ”them?</Q> Flora imagined this denial to be a jest; but when she found that he still persisted that he had sent them directly on his return home, she changed colour, grew seriously angry, and accused him of making use of a poor pre∣tence to avoid paying it all. The Mar∣quis, fired with rage at being supposed
<PB N="119" REF="114"/>capable of so mean a subterfuge, rose from his seat, and traversed the chamber with an air of distraction. He at length conceived his servant must have robbed him; and whilst he resolved in his mind what method to take, he cast his eyes now towards the cieling, now on the floor, without observing any particular object, till at last he happened to fix them near the bed, and distinctly perceived the foot of a man, who wore a very fine buckle: at this sight he became immoveable, and his blood seemed to freeze in his veins with surprize.</P>

The person under the bed, is a foreign nobleman of great distinction, who came, I own, to make me a very advantageous proposal, which heaven knows my ardent affection for you would not suffer me to accept. Whilst he was endeavouring to per∣suade me to listen to him, I heard
<PB N="121" REF="116"/>you on the stairs, and requested him to conceal himself, lest the knowledge of the offer I have re∣fused should become a future tax on your generosity; fearing likewise that your jealousy might be awakened by such a <HI>tete à tete,</HI> and that you might think ill of a woman who ”adores you.</Q> The Marquis had seen too much of the world, to give credit to this harangue; a thousand fears were awakened in his mind and agitated his heart. <Q>Let “us see (said he, in a rage) this foreign∣er, that I may be able to judge if he is ”worthy to dispute your heart with me.</Q> At these words he drew the unfortunate feet from under the bed, and the still more unfortunate owner of them into the middle of the room, and instantly re∣cognized the terrified countenance of his Valet de Chambre. <Q>Rascal, (said the
<PB N="122" REF="117"/>“Marquis) what is the meaning I see you thus dressed in my clothes? Is it possible that a valet should dare to ”arrive at such an height of assurance?</Q> "A valet de chambre! ah, my God!" cried Madame de T***, and either faint∣ed, or pretended so to do. <Q>Wretch, “(said Monsieur D'Illois) tell me before I break every bone in your skin, what is the meaning of this metamorphose, and what you have done with my ”money?</Q> The poor devil, more dead than alive, fell on his knees and confessed all that had passed. The Marquis con∣tented himself with kicking him down stairs, and turned all his anger against his mistress, convinced of the perfidy and avarice of her whom a few hours before he had supposed so fondly attached to him.</P>

She still, however, continued in a state of insensi∣bility with the patience of a stoic, 'till the Marquis lifting up his arm to throw down a very beautiful pagoda into the general wreck, she jumped at once upon her feet, and conjured him to spare her

The good creatures heard this story with a firm be∣lief, and pious attention, and resolved to proclaim a fast to implore heaven for the protection of their convent, then they regained their cells, without daring to look behind them; and unable to sleep the remainder of the night for the phan∣toms raised by their imagination; and Mademoiselle D'Urbin, to heighten the ill-humour occasioned by her disappoint∣ment, was forced to offer half her bed to her troublesome neighbour, whose fears would not permit her to sleep alone.</P>

<PB N="158" REF="153"/>The old woman, indeed, proved herself to be a model of discretion, for she most religiously kept the secret for two long hours, and then it only escaped her to two of her most intimate friends who vowed never to disclose it, and they only acquainted four of their onfidantes, on whose fidelity they could rely, by whose means in less than six hours it was known to the the whole convent; and the Ba∣ron's daughter was the only person who remained ignorant that the whole trans∣action was no longer a secret.</P>

<P>THE Marquis D'Illois thought he had now allowed sufficient time for all the formality of sorrow, and there∣fore waited on the Baron to renew his proposal, and request the long promised introduction to his daughter. Having ever been on the most friendly terms, the Marquis assumed the privilege of a son∣in-law, rather prematurely, and entered whilst the Baron was at his toilette, who was so charmed to see him, that he flew eagerly to meet him; and Monsieur D'Illois finding himself so favourably received, hoped soon to obtain the height of his wishes, and most earnestly desired his permission to accomplish his marriage. <Q>“I am glad, my dear Marquis, (said the Baron) that this is the subject of your visit; I esteem your alliance an

When he perceived Mons.

<PB N="170" REF="165"/>silent a few moments, then turning "angrily to the Marquis, <Q>If you, “Sir, (said he) have not more politeness than to surprise persons whilst they are dressing, my daughter shall never marry any man who knows so little of ”etiquette.</Q> He then retired, and left Monsieur D'Illois in the utmost astonish∣ment.</P>

<P>FOrtunately for the Marquis, a few days after this fràcás, a little smug Abbé went to pay a visit to the old De∣votee at Mademoiselle D'Urbin's con∣vent; after a few common place compli∣ments, they began to expatiate on the wickedness of the world in general, the follies of young persons in particular, and both began most devoutly to censure all their acquaintance. As this was an everlasting subject for conversation, it continued a long time; at last the good lady could not help telling him how greatly she had frequently been a sufferer from the delicacies of her own conscience, and repeated how much she had very lately been hurt, and her christian cha∣rity perfectly distressed, between the wish
<PB N="172" REF="167"/>to disguise the failings of a friend and reli∣gious doubts, lest she should by hiding her fault become an accomplice in her guilt. She then related to him that a beautiful young girl of seventeen, daugh∣ter to the Baron D'Urbin had fallen vio∣lently in love with her geography master; that she had surprised her grant∣ing him a kiss through the grate, which had occasioned the master's dismission from the convent: she uttered this all with so much volubility, that any one but the Abbé would have found great difficulty in attending to the story; he, on the con∣trary, took care to remember every word of it: but in order to account for his listening so attentively to what may appear a matter so wholly indifferent to him, it is necessary to observe, that the Baron D'Urbin was his rival, and that the Abbé was extremely jealous of his
<PB N="173" REF="168"/>assiduities to the beautiful presidente (the widow before mentioned); he therefore lost not a single circumstance, and when she had finished her relation, he retired, and left her convinced of the piety of the conversation, and greatly edified by having thus disclosed the faults of a poor innocent girl.</P>

<PB N="175" REF="170"/>Baroness left only one daughter, ”a child at school;</Q> but the spiteful Abbé, immediately not only told the name of the convent where Mademoiselle D'Urbin was confined, but laughing, accused him of acting the part of <Q>an “unnatural father, in thus denying his ”own child.</Q> The unhappy Baron hearing this accusation brought so home to him in so peremptory a manner, re∣mained silent, scarce daring to lift up his eyes, so much was he ashamed at being convicted of being an old man.</P>

<P>THE malicious Abbé enjoyed his confusion, and endeavoured to re∣double it, by repeating all the devotee had told him; he related Mademoiselle D'Urbin's adventure with the geography master, in which the kiss was not for∣gotten, nor the name of the devotee who had surprised them. The Baron, who was himself an entire stranger to this part of his daughter's history, was shocked to death at the vulgarity of the amour, yet was at last constrained to acknowledge that it was true, that he <Q>had a daugh∣ter “in that convent, but that she was not in reality near as old as she ap∣peared ”to be;</Q> and the lovely widow
<PB N="177" REF="172"/>pitying his confusion, said with the greatest politeness, that, if <Q>Mademoi∣selle “D'Urbin was old enough to be married, the world must allow the Baron must have been a very young ”father.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN the Baron returned home he reflected on the very disagree∣able situation he had been brought into, by having a daughter so forward; he was extremely vexed, as he clearly per∣ceived the whole company had been en∣tertained at his expence, and that not one of them had cordially assented to the compliment paid him by the lady of his affections; and so chagrined was he, that he instantly formed two resolutions, the one to give up the pleasure of going any more to the presidenté assembly, lest the Abbé should have another anecdote in store for him, equally malicious; the other was to marry his daughter imme∣diately; accordingly he went the very next morning to Monsieur D'Illois, and
<PB N="179" REF="174"/>without taking notice of the very abrupt manner in which they had parted, told him, <Q>that he hoped his visit would “prove an agreeable one, as he called to fix the time for his marriage with ”Mademoiselle D'Urbin,</Q> but had the prudence carefully to conceal the motive which made him wish to accelerate their nuptials: indeed the real reasons for most alliances are seldom given or required on either side, (a fortunate circumstance), since many of them would be found nei∣ther better or wiser than the Baron's.</P>

<P>THE Marquis was rejoiced at this overture, and accepted with rap∣ture the offer made by the Baron to in∣troduce him that very evening to his daughter at the convent; and they mu∣tually agreed that the marriage should take place in a few days. Thus hastily was finally settled an affair on which the fu∣ture happiness of the two young people depended: and the Baron agreed to resign his child to a man to whose prin∣ciples, disposition, and temper he was almost a perfect stranger, with much less anxiety than he would have felt on being obliged to leave the choice of the colour of a birth-day suit to his taylor, or the size of a pair of new shoe buckles to his jeweller.</P>

<P>MAdemoiselle D'Urbin received the message from her father, to pre∣pare her for their reception with infinite pleasure; to say the truth, it was the first visit he had ever favoured her with since her residence at the convent. When he introduced the Marquis, he commanded her to look upon him as the man who was to become her husband, and inform∣her at the same time, that she should quit the convent, and be married in a few days. As their union was so soon to take place, Monsieur D'Illois made a de∣claration of his passion in form, which was received by Mademoiselle D'Urbin with so much modesty and diffidence, that he was entirely captivated: he staid with
<PB N="182" REF="177"/>her an hour, the longest time he could possibly spare that evening, having an assignation to meet a very beautiful wo∣man at the opera, but went away from her perfectly convinced from that single hour's conversation, that her understand∣ing, accomplishments, and turn of mind, were such as could not fail to make him the happiest of men.</P>

<PB N="184" REF="179"/>he would now have formed his own in direct opposition to that of Mr. Locke, and have concluded that his daughter must certainly have been born with these ideas of fashionable life, since it would have been next to an impossibility she could ever have attained them in the con∣vent, or in the very short acquaintance she had made with the world before she came thither.</P>

<P>THE news of Mademoiselle D'Ur∣bin's intended nuptials soon reached the unfortunate geography master; yet he could scarce give credit to the report, when he recollected the love she had pro∣fessed, and the vows of fidelity she had so lately made to him; but when he soon after heard it confirmed beyond a possibi∣lity of doubt, he was at first stupified with grief, and afterwards agitated by the most furious transports of rage: had he dared to have made his appear∣ance at the convent, he would have in∣stantly gone and overwhelmed her with reproaches of perfidy and ingratitude, but as he was circumstanced, he was forced to content himself with writing to her on this subject; and sent a letter containing
<PB N="187" REF="182"/>seven large sheets of paper, which he found not any difficulty in conveying to her, as she was now no longer under any restraint of that kind; but Made∣moiselle D'Urbin was so entirely employ∣ed in preparations for her wedding, that she deigned not to send any answer to this epistle, and had almost forgot that there existed in the world such a being as poor Cartinet, who, after waiting in vain three long days for an answer, found out at last an excellent contrivance to put an immediate end to his love and misfor∣tunes, by making a very serious determi∣nation to hang himself; and that his in∣sensible mistress might be convinced that her barbarity had cost him his life, and this instance of his courage should not remain unknown to posterity, he went (as soon as it was dark) to the gate of the convent, and putting one end of
<PB N="188" REF="183"/>a rope (which he brought in his pocket for this purpose) round his neck, he passed the other through the iron bars over the door at the entrance, and made an imprecation on the fair sex in general, Mademoiselle D'Urbin in particular, then swung into the air, and remained suspended.</P>

<P>IT was seven o'clock in a winter even∣ing when he had thus disposed of himself, and he hung in such a manner that no person could pass either in or out of the convent without observing him; he had not been many minutes in this situation before one of the boarders, who had dined with her friends was set down by them in a coach at the end of the street, and walked alone to the con∣vent, which was but a few yards distance; yet the night being dark, the street un∣frequented, and she unused to walk alone, she was rather alarmed, and went hastily to pull the bell, instead of which she laid hold on the dangling foot of the unfortunate Cartinet, and on feeling the shoe and stocking, she screamed as loud as she possibly could with terror and amazement.</P>

<P>ON hearing her cries the portress ran out with a light, but when she saw the figure of a man hanging on the gate of their holy house, her screams even exceeded those of the terrified boarder; their clamours soon reached the commu∣nity, and both nuns and boarders ran out altogether to enquire the cause of this unusual disturbance: Mademoiselle D'Ur∣bin, who came with the rest, was near fainting when she beheld the tragical ca∣tastrophe of her lover; yet as the dark∣ness of the night and the alteration in his features, occasioned by suffocation, pre∣vented
<PB N="191" REF="186"/>the spectators less interested than herself from recollecting him, she con∣cealed as much as possible her agitation, whilst the nuns, without offering him the least assistance, devoted him (from the manner of his death to perdition), and all joined in agreeing, that the cause of it must be love for some inhabitant of the convent; and as it could not rea∣sonably be supposed that he would ever return to life to contradict the assertion, each of them, old and young, candidly confessed, <Q>they had reason to fear that “they were in some degree the cause of this rash action, having very lately strictly forbid an unfortunate young man (whose name christian charity prevented their disclosing,) ever to think of an attachment to them so incompatible with their heavenly en∣gagement.”</Q>
<PB N="192" REF="187"/>As so many were exactly in the same predicament, the person to whom this lover belonged could not possi∣bly be discovered, but surely never did so many innocent persons join in ac∣cusing themselves of a crime of which none of them were in the least guil∣ty.</P>

When he was perfectly recovered, the young lady who had been the means of his preservation, was pointed out to him; gratitude to her (or revenge towards Mademoiselle D'Urbin) made him think her charming; and the swell∣ing of his face having subsided, and he known to be Cartinet, he went up to

<P>WHEN they arrived at the chateau where the relations on both sides were assembled, whilst the bridegroom was introducing his bride to his friends, a stop had nearly been put to the cere∣mony by an old Countess, sister to the Baron, who declared she never would consent <Q>that her niece should marry a “man who had given her so small a dia∣mond nosegay; that it was not half big enough; that the one the Count, her husband, had presented her with at their marriage, was four times the size, and of such a price, that hesold two ”farms and a lordship to purchase it.</Q> The company were in confusion; for, as the Baron had expectations from his sister, she was not to be disobliged, and as

For the first five days it was rapture and ado∣ration on the side of the bridegroom; condescending, sweetness, and complai∣sance on the part of the bride: but on the sixth day the Marchioness took it

<PB N="211" REF="206"/>rendered rouge useless, had not her rank and quality obliged her to wear it; a great quantity of fine glossy dark hair would have covered her neck and shoulders with natural ringlets, but that the present fa∣shion was to elevate them half a foot higher than the head; and though the Baron had so frequently asserted that she was remarkably tall for her age, yet, true it is, she was one of the least women that ever was seen: a beauty in miniature: her shape was elegantly formed, and the continual motion of her head, (already described (seemed to give her additional grace; her vivacity was such, that she scarce remained an instant in a place, and her whole composition seemed to be formed of fire and quick-silver: when she came into a circle, her step was some∣thing between walking and dancing, but infinitely graceful; as soon as she was

<P>THE magistrate first heard the de∣claration of the kidnapper, who pleaded, <Q>that he thought it his duty “to stop any improper person who wore a sword, (and a <HI>couteau de chasse,</HI> he observed, was exactly the same thing); that he had laid hold on the prisoner therefore as a proper, well made man, fit to serve the King, and insisted that he should either be obliged to ”enlist, or be sent directly to prison.</Q> The Marquis was entertained with this ad∣venture, and determined to see what kind of treatment a poor, friendless man might expect to meet with in a similar situation; he therefore addressed himself to the ma∣gistrate
<PB N="225" REF="220"/>in a very humble manner, who interrupted him with a supercilious air, surveyed him from head to foot, and de∣clared, <Q>that the enlisting such idle fel∣lows “was a service to the public in ge∣neral, and that as the rascal was well made, it was an additional reason why ”he should carry a musket.</Q> <Q>Come, “(said he) speak, sirrah, a cockade or a dungeon, without giving me any further ”trouble.</Q> This method of administering justice a good deal surprized Monsieur D'Illois, who in vain protested that hewas really an honest man, whose only crime was poverty; but all the representations of his innocence were ineffectual, and vain every endeavour to induce them to look on him with compassion; 'till at length he de∣clared his name and quality, and they then descended to use the most abject entreaties that he would forgive them

<P>One evening, after some hours de∣voted to riot and drinking with his usual set of libertine friends, it was proposed at the hour of separation, by Count D'Arbannes, that the Marquis should go with with him to spend a few hours with the beautiful Rosetta, who lived in one of those houses which are frequented by unhappy men of desolate and abandoned principles, who, being conscious that

The Marquis agreed rea∣dily to the frolick proposed, and both himself and the Count being in a disha∣bile as before-mentioned, they each put on a long sword instead of a coteau, and ordering their carriage to stop at the end of the street, they proceeded to the house, and knocking loudly at the door, rudely insisted on immediate admittance; the person who opened the door not liking their appearance, declared they could not be suffered to come in as the house was full of company, and the young ladies all engaged; these remonstances were vain, they still pressed forward, and the

<PB N="234" REF="229"/>twinkling tallow candle; the master of this place supplied them with a quan∣tity of spirituous liquors, little suspecting the quality of his guests under their mean appearance: the intoxicating draught which they swallowed, soon nearly deprived them of their senses, and they began to disturb the whole neigh∣bourhood with their bacchanalian revels, and discordant songs: from immoderate mirth they began to dispute on the beauty and chastity of their respective mistresses, they first drank their health, and then so violently insisted on the superiority of their perfections, that at last, enraged by con∣tradiction, one of them threw a bottle at the head of his friend, who instantly re∣turned the compliment with a large dish which contained the remains of a cold pye; the engagement now became gene∣ral; the table was overturned; bottles and
<PB N="235" REF="230"/>pint pots rolled upon the floor, and the streams of liquor mingled with the blood of the combatants; blows were given on all sides, whilst the miserable end of candle floated on the ground till it was utterly extinguished, and hid in the shades of oblivion and obscurity many glorious exploits of the enraged champions. The master of the house, and a ragged boy, (who was his only domestic) vainly endeavoured to part them, 'till at last wearied by blows given and received, they were glad to pay their reckoning, and get into a couple of hackney coaches; and the Marquis regained the hotel with an eye nearly beat out of his head, a dislo∣cated shoulder, and a face entirely disco∣loured with bruises; but what he chiefly regretted, were three teeth lost in the scuffle, and which were obliged to be replaced by a skilful dentist from the
<PB N="236" REF="231"/>mouth of a young chimney sweeper, be∣fore he could appear abroad; but he had, however, time sufficient for the opera∣tion, as it was six weeks before he was sufficiently recovered to join the party, who were by that time able to meet again as good friends as ever.</P>

<P>THEY soon after made a party to dine and spend the day in the wood of Boulogne, and after an excellent din∣ner and plenty of champaigne, went to enjoy the cool of the evening by ram∣bling in the walks: they had not pro∣ceeded far before they were surprized by the sound of a very fine voice, and on advancing nearer, perceived a very gen∣teel, elegant, but modest-looking Abbé, sitting under a tree, and entertaining himself by singing with great precision and judgment; the Marquis and his friends, who were disposed to be very merry, drew near the young man, who, seeing so many persons coming towards him, stopt abruptly, and rose to continue his walk; but they prevented him by
<PB N="238" REF="233"/>forming a circle round him, and desiring him in a very impertinent manner to con∣tinue his song for their amusement, which he politely declined; and, indeed, the manner in which the request was made excluded every possiblity of a compliance, and he therefore persisted in his refusal very steadily: they were piqued at what they deemed obstinacy, and shewed them∣selves determined to hear him, and at length provoked by his silence, one of them, the Count D'Arbannes, drew his sword, and pointing it close to the breast of the Abbé, swore he would instantly run him through the body, unless he sung immediately; the others drew their's likewise, and the Abbé, though a man of courage, yet being unarmed, saw him∣self in a very perilous situation, and in the absolute power of a set of men whom he had not the least doubt would put
<PB N="239" REF="234"/>their threats in execution; he was there∣fore obliged to comply without further hesitation; but as the voice is seldom in tune when the will is wanting, they found his singing by force so extremely ridicu∣lous that the woods resounded with peals of laughter; and after they had suffi∣ciently tormented him by obliging him to sing all the songs they could think of, they let him go, and remained extremely diverted by having so unexpectedly met with so entertaining an adventure.</P>

<P>IT happened, however, unfortunately for them, that this Abbé was a young man, who had been in the army, but by some transition of circumstances having met with friends better able to pro∣vide for him in the church, he had resigned the sword and hat and feather in favour of an habit which announced peace to all the world; and, being in ex∣pectation of a benefice, he lived a retired life in Paris, cultivating his taste for mu∣sic, having (as already observed) the ad∣vantage of a very fine voice.</P>

<P>THE Abbé could not so far divest himself of the idea of his former profession, but that he still retained a very nice sense of the honour of a gentleman, and felt the most poignant anguish at having been thus grossly insulted. Just after he had left the place he met with a labouring man, to whom he pointed out his persecutor Count D'Arbannes, and giving the man a direction where to meet with him, promised him a louis if he would watch the Count home, and bring him word who he was, and where he lived. Having taken this most probable method to procure the wished-for information, he returned to Paris so exceedingly shocked and ashamed of the treatment he had re∣ceived,
<PB N="242" REF="237"/>that he pulled his hat over his eyes, and scarce dared look any person whom he met in the face: his emissary came to him very late in the evening, and in∣formed him very accurately of the name, quality, and residence of his enemy; and the Abbé, who was overjoyed at having procured the wished-for intelligence, dis∣missed him with the promised reward, went to bed, and passed the night with the greatest tranquility. He rose very early, and having but lately laid aside his regi∣mentals, he had them still in his possession, and putting on a suit of them, he went instantly to the hotel of Count D'Arban∣nes, when being admitted, he informed him that he was the person whom he had in∣sulted in the wood the evening before, and that he was come to demand satisfaction; and therefore insisted on his accompanying him to the same place immediately: the
<PB N="243" REF="238"/>Count was but just risen, scarce awake, and hardly remembered the transaction of the night before, much less recollected the person of the metamorphosed Abbé; but being really a brave man, he made no scru∣ple to obey the summons, dressed himself in haste, put on his sword, got with him into an hackney coach, and soon ar∣rived at the tree where they had met the evening before. The Count drew his sword, and retreating a few paces, put himself in a posture of defence, but the Abbé instantly presenting a loaded pistol; <Q>“Stop, (said he), we are not as yet on an equal footing; you forced me to sing against my will, and you ”shall now dance to please me.</Q> In vain the Count expostulated that the sword was the only method to revenge the affront a gentleman had received, without any other retaliation whatever; the Abbé
<PB N="244" REF="239"/>calmly refused to listen to any solicitation, and told him cooly he would blow his brains out instantly if he did not com∣ply: the Count protested he never danced, that it was an exercise he never used; that he had sprained his ancle, and was incapable of dancing even if he wished it; but every entreaty or excuse were equally vain. With the pistol levelled at his head, the Abbé obliged him to begin and dance alternately the Minuet de la Cour, Gavote, Rigadoon, and Allemande, which the Count having complied with, the Abbé fired his pistol in the air, drew his sword, and declared he was now ready to give the Count satisfaction in the way he chose to demand it: vexed to the very soul at the treatment he had met with, he fought with more passion than pru∣dence, and was quickly disarmed by the Abbé, who instantly granted him his
<PB N="245" REF="240"/>life, in a manner which did honour both to his generosity and humanity. The Count could not but admire the bravery of his conduct, and the steadiness he had shewn to return the insult he had met with; but as the Count naturally con∣cluded this new method of teaching sing∣ing and dancing, would be a good deal talked of, he thought it prudent to make a journey into Italy for a few months 'till it was a little forgotten.</P>

<P>A FEW similar circumstances put a stop to the lively fancy, displayed so evidently in the frolicks of the Marquis and his companions; and he, in particular, re∣solved for the future, to confine his plea∣sure to the short lived triumph over venal beauty, the seduction of innocence, noctur∣nal riot, and other libertine adventures he might meet with, without deviating from the character of a gentleman; and in pursu∣ance of this resolution, the dress which had afforded him so much entertainment, being too shabby to merit the acceptance of any of the valets, descended so far as to equip one of the kitchen boys.</P>

<P>ONE day as Madame D'Illois was in her carriage for the benefit of air and exercise, with all the glasses close∣ly up, and reclined on eider down cushi∣ons, her ears were struck by the cries of a little dog; she looked out of the window and saw a poor ragged Savoyard who had got a cord round the neck of a very small spaniel, going to take it to∣wards the river; the Marchioness stopped her coach. <Q>Ah! (said she) what a beau∣tiful “creature, bring that charming dog hither to me, that I may kiss ”him.</Q> It happened however, that this charmer was a little nasty, mangy dog, so miserably old and troublesome, that
<PB N="249" REF="244"/>the owner had given the Savoyard a small sum, to be at the trouble of drowning him: the Marchioness admired and ca∣ressed him with transport; <Q>Friend (said “she) what will induce you to sell me ”this dog?</Q> The arch fellow took care not to tell her, on what errand he was going, but pretended he brought him to wash every morning; and assured the Marchioness, that the lady to whom he belonged, would not trust him with any other person in the world, as she was so fond of her dog she hardly suffered him out of her sight; adding, that if he had a mind to have sold him, he might have had any money for him, one of the prin∣cesses having taken a fancy to him but the last week:—Madame D'Illois was now determined to purchase him at any price, and eagerly asked, what sum would prevail on him to part with him; the
<PB N="250" REF="245"/>man, almost afraid to ask so unconscion∣able a price, was going to say a louis, when on his hesitation, she took out her purse, and putting five louis into his hand be∣fore he could answer her, ordered the coachman to drive on, and left the Savoy∣ard astonished at his good fortune; and she went on overjoyed at being in pos∣session of so beautiful an animal.</P>

<P>ON her return home one evening, she perceived she had lost one of her diamond ear-rings, worth fifteen thou∣sand livres; this was a large sum of money; she was unable to replace the loss out of her own purse, and was equally certain the Marquis would not assist her, (as she had sufficient reason to suppose he rather repented the money laid out on jewels for her before): to go without so essential an article of dress was impos∣sible: she was therefore inconsolable in her grief, and indefatigable in her endea∣vours to recover it; she sent to every place she had been to that evening; di∣stributed hand bills all over Paris, but in vain; several days elapsed and she heard not any news of the lost diamonds.</P>

<P>IN a week's time, finding it impossible ever to regain her loss, the Marchio∣ness consoled herself for her misfortune; and determined not to give herself any further concern about the matter: she resumed her usual vivacity, and declared, <Q>“It was so foolish to be the possessor of one ear-ring, that she wished with all ”her heart she had lost them both.</Q> A very distant relation fortuuately died in less than a fortnight after this adventure, and left her a legacy to a considerable amount, by which means Madame D'Il∣lois saw herself enabled to purchase ano∣ther ear-ring; but not contented with merely replacing the one, she determin∣ed to have a pair infinitely larger, hand∣somer,
<PB N="255" REF="250"/>and higher priced, than those she had lost; and pleased herself with the idea of the mortification it would be to her female acquaintance, who from envy had rejoiced in her misfortune, and who would now have the vexation to see her more richly adorned than before; and was delighted by the thought of the sur∣prize her first appearance would create: she was interrupted from this reverie, by being told a person desired to speak with her, who insisted on being admitted immediately, as he brought her good news; on her giving orders for him to come in, she saw a grave, plain-drest man, who informed her, <Q>he had found her ear∣ring “in the street, the very evening she had dropt it; but living a very retired life, and being much engaged in philo∣sophic studies, he had kept it carefully several days not knowing to whom it
<PB N="256" REF="251"/>belonged; but having that day been at the coffee house, he had learnt it was her's, and brought it im∣mediately.”</Q> Madame D'Illois no sooner heard his errand than she was al∣most ready to beat him, as it entirely deranged the scheme of finery she had been planning. <Q>It is a very strange “thing (said she, to the poor amazed man) that any one can take a delight in living so stupid a life as you must do, not to have heard what has for this week past been the talk of all Paris; and that you should shut your∣self up in such a manner as not to know I had lost my ear-ring? If you had brought it three days ago, I should have been obliged to you; now I would not give three sous for it; and, indeed, I had much rather it had never been ”found at all.</Q> The philospher was
<PB N="257" REF="252"/>almost petrified by this reception; he hastened to regain the door, without ut∣tering another syllable, and retired mut∣tering to himself; <Q>I have read (said “he) in a famous English author, that woman is an animal who delighteth in finery; how then can I reconcile this creature's indifference with the ideas I have ever entertained of the ruling disposition of one of her spe∣cies!”</Q></P>

<P>FOrtune having thus disappointed the vanity of the Marchioness, by the unexpected restoration of her jewels, she fat seriously down to consider how she should expend the sum she had destined for this purpose: she had long wished to have a carriage more superb than her own, and now determined to indulge herself since she had so fair an opportu∣nity; therefore sent to the coachmaker, gave orders for a most magnificent equi∣page, with a positive command not to attend to expence, as she was determined it should exceed any thing of the kind ever yet seen in Paris; and giving a loose to her very lively imagination, she herself
<PB N="259" REF="254"/>chose the subjects of the paintings, or∣dered the exact manner in which it should be gilt, the colour and form of the har∣ness, and that the most able and skilful workmen should be instantly employed, and not quit it 'till it was entirely finish∣ed. When this brilliant carriage was compleated and brought home, at the first sight of it the Marchioness was nearly fainting with pleasure and surprize: it was a vis-à-vis, most elegantly shaped; all the paintings were done by a cele∣brated artist, whose pictures were held by the connoisseurs in high estimation: on the one side-pannel, were a group of beautiful Cupids, forming garlands of flowers, and covering with roses and myrtles a sleeping Venus reclined on a mossy couch; on the other side was the god of love, kneeling disarmed at the feet of Psyché, and pointing to a palace
<PB N="260" REF="255"/>at a distance, which seemed to be rising (by the assistance of Sylphs and Geniis) from the earth for an habitation for his lovely bride: in front was painted Hebe, the goddess of youth, receiving the united homage of the gods; and on the back the birth of Venus, just risen from the waves in a triumphal car of mother of pearl, and attended in procession by all the divinities of the sea: a very high var∣nish contributed greatly to embellish these beautiful paintings; all the leather to which the springs were fastened were of red morocco, embroidered with gold; the edges and spokes of the wheels were gilt to the nave; and the cushion behind for the footman to stand upon, was likewise morocco, with fringes and acorns of gold; six English horses, the swiftest and small∣est that could be produced, drew this wonderful carriage, their heads ornament∣ed
<PB N="261" REF="256"/>with large plumes of white feathers, their harness covered with green silk, stud∣ded with stars of the most beautiful paste, and with buckles of the same, which reflecting the rays of the sun, seemed to sparkle with a thousand different coloured fires, and dazzled the eyes of all who were so fortunate as to behold this miracle of modern taste and workmanship.</P>

<P>THE first day Madame D'Illois made use of her new equipage, she or∣dered the coachman to drive very slow, that the beauty and magnificence of the car∣riage might be seen; her dress was equally brilliant, her head and neck was almost co∣vered with jewels, and she wore a robe de la cour, of a beautiful pattern both for richness and fancy, trimmed with the highest taste, and in so elegant a manner that the ornamental part cost three times the value of the silk. The Marchio∣ness elate with future triumph stepped into the vis-à-vis, secure of being the admiration and envy of all Paris; but scarcely had she passed through a few streets before she heard hisses from every side, attended with a loud cry of <Q>stop!
<PB N="263" REF="258"/>“”stop!</Q> The mob came running in crowds, and offered her a thousand in∣sults; at length a party of guards arrived, who seized the reins of the horses, obliged the coachman to turn about, and con∣ducted the fine carriage and beautiful owner of it to the house of the next ma∣gistrate.</P>

<P>ASTONISHED at the usage she received, Madame D'Illois wearied herself in expostulations with the guard, and repeated her assurances that they would severely repent this treatment of a woman of quality; they laughed at her anger, and despised her threats: the foot∣men who in vain undertook to defend her, received a shower of blows, were obliged to yield to superior numbers, and were dragged by the side of the carriage with their hands tied behind them. Resistance being vain, the Marchioness resolved to bear this insult patiently, assured that it would soon be in her power to punish the authors of it: when she came to the house of the magistrate; they obliged her to
<PB N="265" REF="260"/>alight, and she waited in the anti-cham∣ber, at least three quarters of an hour before she gained admittance to this su∣baltern officer of justice: enraged at being treated so cavalierly, she sent seve∣ral times to let him know, <Q>that she was “in haste, and had several engagements on her hands; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evening, was particularly obliged to be at a ball, where the whole company would wait ”for her with impatience.</Q> Wearied at last by her importunities, he condescended to order <Q><HI>that there</HI> woman to be ad∣mitted.“”</Q> Madame D'Illois entered with precipitation, fully convinced that her appearance would reduce him to the necessity of making a proper apology for the mistake his people had committed; but so far from it, he received her with a frown, and did not offer to rise from an arm chair in which he was seated with
<PB N="266" REF="261"/>great gravity. <Q>Ah! ah! Madam, (said “he) I am glad to see you here; you have made a fine piece of work of it, ”truly.</Q> The Marchioness was going to answer, but first meant to seat herself in an easy chair which stood behind her, when her conductors pulled her rudely by the arm, and obliged her to stand up.</P>

I wonder you are not ashamed to shew your face in such a fine coach; it is enough to make all the honest women in Paris hang them∣selves.”</Q> The Marchioness was so ex∣ceedingly astonished at this address, that she was almost deprived of the power of making an answer, but her vanity being piqued by the conclusion, she recovered herself sufficiently to reply with a counte∣nance full of disdain: <Q>I would have
<PB N="268" REF="263"/>“you to know, Sir, that a woman in my stile of life, may not only gratify herself in any expence she pleases, but likewise have interest enough to make you repent the audacity of this beha∣haviour.”</Q> <Q>I am not to learn at these “years (returned the magistrate) that ladies of your sort are very expensive; thanks to the young men who supply this extravagance, whilst their honest creditors are unpaid: but with all your affectation and airs you are not less despicable; yet, I think, at least, you should not carry your insolence so far, as to ape persons of quality in their equipage and liveries, which distin∣guish them from the vulgar; and your having footmen in livery in order to impose yourself on me and the world for a lady of distinction, is an aggravation of your crime, for which
<PB N="269" REF="264"/>you deserve to be made an example; but you are not the first fine lady, who, having been at great expence for her carriage, has been obliged to ride in it to the very place to which I shall send ”you.</Q> This stroke of pleasantry was highly applauded by the motley croud that surrounded the chair of the magis∣trate. <Q>I see, (said the Marchioness, “blushing with rage and indignation,) that there is some mistake in all this, and that you are ignorant that I am ”the Marchioness D'Illois:</Q> at these words the whole assembly set up a loud laugh; and the magistrate, forgetting the gravity of his station, laughed louder than the rest.</P>

<P>MADAME D'Illois could not conceive the reason of this treat∣ment, it appeared to her to be a dream; in vain she repeatedly declared herself the wife of the Marquis D'Illois, the laugh redoubled at every assurance of it: find∣ing they still refused to give credit to her protestations, she became almost frantic with rage, she stamped with her feet, wrung her hands, and even cried with vexation and dispair; and to encrease her mortification, she was obliged to adopt a suppliant tone, and entreat, as a favour, that the Marquis might be sent for, who would convince them of the truth of her assertion: the magistrate to shew his saga∣city gravely replied, <Q>I doubt not but
<PB N="271" REF="266"/>“the young nobleman you mention, may be of the number of those who honour you with their protection, and in com∣passion to your sex, I will comply with your entreaties, and send to desire him to come hither; we shall then see how ”he will treat his wife.</Q> When the Marchioness found she had gained this point, she became more composed, and the magistrate more polite, as he began to suspect she was the favourite of a man of such distinction; he permitted her there∣fore to sit down on a stool, whilst he re∣mained lolling almost at full length in his chair, and having sent a messenger to Monsieur D'Illois, waited his return with∣out any visible signs of impatience.</P>

<P>THE person dispatched on this com∣mission, luckily found the Marquis at home; and as he never believed the lady in custody to be more than an ac∣quaintance of Monsieur D'Illois, he de∣livered his message according to that idea, in these words:—<Q>A very fine lady, “(said he) who has been brought before my master, desires your lordship's pro∣tection, and that you will come to her immediately, and deliver her from her present embarrassment, as she has been obliged to say that she is your wife; that trick, however, would not pass
<PB N="237" REF="268"/>upon my master, he hears those things ”too often to mind them.</Q> The Mar∣quis was far from suspecting that the Marchioness had any part in this adven∣ture, and believed it to be some distressed damsel of his acquaintance, who had ra∣ther presumed on her imaginary right; the answers of the emissary confirmed him in this belief: he took down, how∣ever, the direction, and curious to know which of his nymphs it could be, ordered his carriage, and promised to follow the man in a few minutes: the diligent messen∣ger set out to prepare his master for the reception of his illustrious visitor, who did not, however, make the promised haste, for just as he was getting into his cha∣riot, he met with his talyor, who came to consult with him on a new fashion, which the Marquis meant to introduce; this being a business of importance, he turned

The ma∣gistrate smiled at this delay, which he
<PB N="276" REF="271"/>conceived justified his opinion of the Marchioness not being his wife, but he was a single man; had he been mar∣ried, he would not have required any other proof in her behalf, than the very delay which he now interpreted so unfavourably.</P>

<PB N="280" REF="275"/>the hospital if she refused; chance so ordered it, Madam, (continued he) that your beautiful vis-à-vis came out on to-day, therefore, I hope it will plead my excuse, then, though I shall ever deem myself to blame, for my want of discernment, in not at once distinguishing your beauty and appearance from that of a kept wo∣man.”</Q> This well turned compliment entirely pacified the Marchioness, and made the Marquis smile: the magistrate perceiving his eloquence thus graciously received, continued, <Q>Nothing could, “I think, possibly have influenced my conduct so far, as to behave with rude∣ness to such a lady, except the natu∣ral horror and antipathy I bare and ever have borne to those profligate women, whose name is a disgrace to their sex; they have ever seemed to
<PB N="281" REF="276"/>me worthy of the most exemplary pu∣nishment; I never have shewn them the least mercy, neither can I con∣ceive how a man who possesses com∣mon sense, can be for an instant de∣ceived ”by their dissembled caresses.</Q></P>

<P>THE talkative magistrate would possibly have continued his elo∣quence, in order to prove his innate love of virtue, but, to say the truth, his audi∣tors were tired, and took their leave, convinced no doubt of the austerity of his manners, if not charmed with his polite∣ness: but unfortunately the Marchioness had on a very large hoop, and in sailing out of the room in a fashionable manner, she threw down a large six leaved screen, which stood half drawn, and discovered behind it, seated on a couch, a young girl, whose disordered, tawdry dress, and pro∣fligate appearance, declared at first sight
<PB N="283" REF="278"/>the infamy of her profession. Monsieur and Madame D'Illois laughed most im∣moderately at this proof of the occasional severity of this disciple of virtue, whilst the disconcerted magistrate remained fixed as if rooted to the ground, with his head sunk on his breast, his mouth half open, his eyes fixed on the floor, and his arms hanging streight down his sides: the Marquis to augment his confusion, ad∣dressing him as soon as he could recover his speech, <Q>I am now (said he) an “eye-witness to your irregularities; you persecute these unfortunate creatures, in public declaim against them, yet privately make their misfortunes sub∣servient to the gratification of your ”own vices.</Q></P>

<P>OVerwhelmed with these reproaches, the magistrate stood almost stupi∣fied with fear and shame; at length he took courage, and affected to turn the whole affair into pleasantry, and evade the matter by giving it a ludicrous turn, and began to join in the laugh louder than the rest. <Q>Good God! (said he) “a very good joke, indeed,—a mere bagatelle! but there are secrets in all professions, which we are sorry to have revealed <HI>mal à propos;</HI> the truth is, this young lady is come to settle in my neighbourhood, and came here
<PB N="285" REF="280"/>to-day to beg my protection; it is then no more than justice that she should purchase it in the way of trade; we were just settling the preliminaries, when the arrival of the Marchioness obliged me to put her behind the screen, and I hope I shall not incur your displeasure for merely exercising ”the privileges of my office.</Q> This pleasantry had not the desired effect, the Marquis was disgusted by his familiarity, and the same vice which would have ap∣peared mere galantry in a man of fashion, seemed odious and disgusting in a ple∣bian; he, therefore, threatened to ex∣pose his behaviour to those who had a right to punish him in a proper manner, and Madame D'Illois protested she would entertain every company she went into with this adventure: they then left him with expressions of the utmost contempt,
<PB N="286" REF="281"/>and he remained exceedingly chagrined and terrified, whilst they on the contrary, far from exerting the promised revenge, forgot every part of the transaction before they turned the corner of the street.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXXV.</HEAD>
<P>BY an unusual excess of complai∣sance, the Marchioness permitted her husband to get into her vis-à-vis; he paid her many compliments on it's beauty, and the elegance of her taste, and being seated in a new carriage, op∣posite to so lovely a woman, drest in the highest stile, it had a good deal the air of adventure, and he could hardly believe but he was pursuing a new conquest; he, therefore, addressed her with the ut∣most tenderness, said a thousand flatter∣ing things of her beauty, sighed and pressed her hand with the utmost ten∣derness, and even declared a passion for her in the most ardent terms. The Mar∣chioness was astonished, she looked upon
<PB N="288" REF="283"/>this sudden admiration as a proof of the power of her charms, when they could even metamorphose an husband into a lover; she looked on the Marquis, and once more thought him an amiable man, therefore heard him with complaisance, and affected such an air of sensibility and modesty, that the Marquis was in raptues; earnestly did he endeavour to prevail on her to devote to his society the remainder of that day, but in vain; she had been engaged for some time to go to a ball at the Duke of —; she was drest for admiration, and did not chuse to give up what she had taken such pains to obtain, and her self-love was by no means sufficiently gratified with a triumph over her husband only; at length he grew more pressing from de∣nial, and entreated with all the eloquence he was master of, that she would permit
<PB N="289" REF="284"/>him to sup with her in her own apartment on her return <HI>tête-à-tête;</HI>—she hesitated —he insisted—and at last she gave the wished-for permission, to which he obliged her to add a promise to come home early; and he quitted her once more absolutely in love.</P>

<P>THE entertainment given by the Duke of —, was one of the most splendid that can be conceived; it was in honour of a foreign nobleman, the manners of whose country were so sim∣ple, and the court from which he came, so void of luxury, that it was not even in his power to judge of the magnificence with which he was received, or form the least idea of the liberality of the donor; he was to quit the kingdom the next morning, and that he might leave it with a proper impression of the grandeur of the French nation, the Duke treated him that night at the expence of half his yearly income; a concert, with which the stranger seemed absolutely wearied, began the evening;
<PB N="291" REF="286"/>the supper was a repast both sumptuous and delicate, but which neither being the food he was used to eat, nor dressed in the plain manner in which he was accustomed to have his victuals prepared for him, he could not partake of with pleasure; the latter part of the evening, the company as∣sembled in a large ball-room, where he was obliged to sit three hours to see dancing, the confused form of which he could not comprehend, and where the croud was so great, it was impossible for the dancers to move without the greatest difficulty; for which reason it became so fashionable to dance, that every one was ambitious of being engaged in the set.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>MADAME D'Illois' beauty and figure soon gained her admission amongst the dancers, and she danced with redoubled pleasure, as she heard en∣comiums on her grace and sprightliness echoed from every side by the men, tho' the women were so far of a contrary opi∣nion, that they declared her both auk∣ward and ill-dressed; but sufficiently gra∣tified by the praises of the male part of the assembly, she despised those of the females, whose criticism she looked upon as the mere result of envy and ill-nature. Her favoured lover, the Abbé, whose pro∣fession excluded him from dancing, was a witness of the admiration and pleasure she excited, and at the end of every
<PB N="293" REF="288"/>dance brought her refreshments with the most assiduous attention, and said at the same time a thousand flattering things on her superior excellence and beauty. The Marchioness captivated by pleasures and alive to every sensation of vanity, was so charmed by his assurances of en∣creasing and everlasting love, that she listened with delight, forgot her appointment with the Marquis, and had the weakness to consent to his entreaty of permitting him to follow her home, and spend that night, (as he had done many others) in her apartment: having thus far prevailed, he was content to mix with the croud that followed her to her carriage, and then to avoid suspicion, returned for half an hour to the ball-room.</P>

<P>THE Marchioness, (who returned tired and fatigued with dancing,) undressed and went to bed immediately; and having dismissed her women, (who knew too much of high life ever to enter her apartment, unless they were rung for), she remained with great tran∣quility, expecting the arrival of the Abbé, who had a key to the garden gate, and another of the door of a pair of back stairs which led from a terrace directly into the apartment of Madame D'Illois. The Marquis) who did not doubt but his wife would stay late at the ball, though she had promised to retire early,) had accepted a party made by some young noblemen to the <HI>petit souper</HI> of a courtizan, where he amused himself by
<PB N="295" REF="290"/>permitting the mistress of the house, and some of her friends to cheat him at cards of a very considerable sum of money; but when the clock struck three, concluding the Marchioness must be then returned, he left the joyous cir∣cle, and hastened home, where he made the best of his way to his lady's apartments: the servants, who were still in the anti-chamber, were astonished at this visit, but having a confused remem∣brance of his being Madame D'Illois' husband, they suffered him to pass, as they knew not the very particular reason she had at that time not to grant him ad∣mittance, yet, concluded she would be much surprised at the sight of so unex∣pected a visitor. The Marquis just en∣tered as the Abbé was sitting before the glass disposing of his curls to the best advantage, beneath a rose-coloured
<PB N="296" REF="291"/>sattin night cap, richly ornamented with with fine lace, which he conceived to be infinitely becoming; and being a man of professed galantry, and always uncertain where, or with whom he should sleep, he had long taken the precaution of carrying it constantly in his pocket. As soon as Mons. D'Illois appeared, the Marchioness recollected her unfortunate engagement to him, and was ready to expire with confusion; the Abbé rose from his toilette on this un∣expected intrusion, but had not time even to endeavour to conceal himself, whilst Monsieur D'Illois was transfixed with astonishment on finding the Abbé in the Marchioness' apartment so very un∣expectedly.</P>

<P>AN old fashioned, vulgar husband would have instantly ordered the Abbé to have been thrown out of the window, but to the well-bred Marquis this scene appeared so extremely comic, that he laughed most immoderately, and his extraordinary mirth so very unseason∣able, though an additional source of con∣fusion to the Abbé, gave the Mar∣chioness some time for recollection, who addressing herself to the Marquis with great gravity, <Q>Cease, Sir, (said she) “this unbecoming gaiety; learn, that the gentleman present is a very res∣pectable person, whose pious advice I have long followed in all religious matters, and, after having made an
<PB N="298" REF="293"/>assignation with you for this evening, it appeared to me to have so much the air of an intrigue, that it was not possible to reconcile it to the nice sensibility of a woman of virtue; I felt, therefore, infinite repugnance to comply with it, and as I had been very uneasy during the time of the ball, I called as I came from the Duke's on this pious man, to lay before him the scruples of my con∣science, and request his advice on so delicate a subject; he was gone to bed, and came down to me in haste, (concluding the business was urgent,) when, without giving him time to new dress his hair, I brought him hither immediately, where I could at leisure listen to his arguments, and that he might likewise have an opportunity to ”acquaint you with his decision.</Q></P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXXX.</HEAD>
<P>AT the conclusion of this fine speech, (which had not even the shadow of probability,) Monsieur D'Illois laughed yet louder than before; and the rose-co∣loured night cap giving great cause to suspect the severity of the Abbé's virtue, he called in the servants from the anti-chamber, and ordered them to treat this director of consciences with a good drub∣bing, and then to turn him into the street, <Q>That he may ever remember for “the future (said the Marquis), that it is a very great breach of politeness and respect to visit a lady in his night ”cap.</Q> The Abbé on hearing this sentence threw himself on his knees, and begged forgiveness in the most abject
<PB N="300" REF="295"/>manner, but in vain, for the Marchio∣ness, enraged at his cowardice and mean behaviour at this exigence, ordered them to bestow a few more blows on him on her account, to revenge (she said) his severe and frequent reprehen∣sions on her too great fondness for public diversions: the footmen, who enjoyed exceedingly the caning an Abbé with impunity, executed their orders with great alacrity, and then putting him out of the door, wished him good night.</P>

<P>THE Marquis remained with the Marchioness, and left her in the morning without the least reproof for her ill conduct, or ever once seeming to sus∣pect that any dishonour had been intend∣ed him; he then took leave of her with the greatest politeness, and went to drink chocolate with a celebrated tragic actress, whose person had pleased him in the last new piece, and whom he thought worthy to appear in the character of his favourite sultana. The gentleman was generous, and the lady complying, so that matters could not be long settling to their mutual satisfaction; the Marquis promised on his part five-and-twenty louis a month, the nymph, the fondest attachment and un∣shaken fidelity.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXXXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marquis generally changed his mistress every eight days at least, therefore, this kind of treaty suited him exactly, and he determined for the future to confine his amours to ladies easy of access; and as variety could be so cheaply obtained, he thought it would be a pleasant frolick to keep at the same time an actress of each theatre; there∣fore, having arranged matters with this disciple of Melpomene, he next paid his devoirs to the prettiest figurer at the opera, who, though she did not excel in the science she professed, was a fine, well-shaped girl of seventeen, whose bewitch∣ing eyes, joined to a kind of childish playfulness in her manner, gained her
<PB N="303" REF="298"/>many admirers, and she had the offer of jewels and settlements from many lovers at the same time; as yet, however, she affec∣ted exemplary modesty: her eyes were fixed to the ground, as if unable to support the ardent gaze of admiration, and the blush of innocence seemed still to glow upon her cheek. The Marquis resolved to triumph over a croud of contending ri∣vals, and every night he paid constant attendance to her behind the scenes, where, finding his assiduities graciously received, and that she listened to his flat∣tery with visible preference, he one even∣ing ventured to make proposals for bring∣ing the affair to a conclusion; <Q>Come, “(said he) my charming Adelaide, let me hope you mean to be mine, deign to fix your own terms, and be assured, whatever sum can purchase your com∣pliance, ”shall be your's.</Q> The fair one
<PB N="304" REF="299"/>looked grave, hesitated, and then replied, <Q>“You are very good, very generous, Sir —but this is an affair in which I am not at liberty to act for myself—it is a mat∣ter which must be entirely regulated ”by my mama.</Q> The Marquis pleaded with her, and used all the rhetoric he was master of, to prevail on her to speak her own terms; entreaties were vain, he could not obtain any other answer, than, <Q>that “her mama would be glad to see him at ”eleven the next day.</Q></P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marquis was too anxious to terminate this important affair, not to be exact to the hour she mentioned; and on being introduced to the pretended mama, she heard his proposals with at∣tention, and pondered on them in silence; at length, <Q>Sir, (said she to the Mar∣quis, “gravely,) we may, perhaps, set∣tle this affair, for it now draws near the time in which I wish to fix Made∣moiselle Adelaide in a proper situation; merit and person are not of conse∣quence in the favoured lover of the ladies of the opera, they are obliged to chuse those who can best repay the expence, in some degree which their
<PB N="306" REF="301"/>parents have been at in their educa∣tion, therefore my determination has long been fixed that she shall accept the most liberal lover, and have made her solemnly promise to submit every proposal to my wisdom and expe∣rience. This condition she has faithfully complied with, and I re∣gularly give audience every morning to hear the terms of different gentle∣men, register the names, quality, and offers of each, carefully in a book ”I keep for that purpose.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN the provident mama had said this, she rose, and unlock∣ing a table drawer, took out a book with a parchment cover, then putting on her spectacles turned over a great number of leaves with great earnestness and applica∣cation, making at the same time calcula∣tions on her fingers; the Marquis sat in silent astonishment, wondering what would be the event of all this; the old woman continued to mutter to herself, and would shake her head frequently for some time; at last she took off her spectacles, and addressing Monsieur D'Illois with great
<PB N="308" REF="303"/>gravity, <Q>I wish you joy, Sir, (said “she) Adelaide is your's; your offers are the most truly generous of any of her lovers; you deserve such a treasure, for never was there a more innocent heart; and I really think the surrender I make to you of so lovely a girl, de∣serves an hundred louis for a new gown for my-self, besides the fifty per month you are to pay her; but if you refuse to comply with this small gratuity to me, our treaty is at an end, if not, she is ”your own.</Q> The Marquis agreed to these conditions, and Adelaide being called, declared with blushes, that he, of all her lovers, had alone made suffi∣cient impression on her heart to induce her to wish that he might meet with the approbation of her mama; yet, such was the reserve and delicacy of her senti∣ments and behaviour, that it was near
<PB N="309" REF="304"/>three days before he could prevail on her to admit him as a favoured lover, though both mama and herself acknow∣ledged <Q>such was her predilection in “favour of the Marquis from the first moment she beheld him, that her heart must have been absolutely broken, had not the generosity of his offers been ”worthy her acceptance.</Q></P>

<P>SOON after his conquest over this vestal of the theatre, the Marquis paid his devoirs to the loveliest of the Italian singers: a fine figure, and a pair of large black eyes had obtained her the preference of the Marquis over the rest of her companions; but on his first lu∣crative proposition, the generous creature burst into tears: <Q>To what am I reduced “(said she, in a tone of indignation) that you should for a single moment suppose me capable of selling myself for interest? Can you love me, and yet wish me to become the object of so vile a passion? The heart of a lover like you is a sufficient prize; I
<PB N="311" REF="306"/>accept it with pleasure, yet disdain ”every sordid idea of gain.</Q> The Mar∣quis was surprized to the last degree to meet with a disinterested woman; he was charmed with the generosity of her mind, and used every art and every delicate at∣tention to gain the heart of this sentimen∣tal nymph, whose virtue was at length so far subdued as to grant him an assigna∣tion gratis.</P>
