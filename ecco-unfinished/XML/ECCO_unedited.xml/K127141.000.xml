<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THERE liv'd a King in the land of <HI>Britain,</HI> whose Name was <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The same was a bad Prince, and he did that which was Evil in the Sight of the Lord; he started aside lik a crooked Bow, and obey'd not the Commandments of his God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
III. But went a whoring after strange Gods, even the Works of Mens Hands; he set up Images in the Tabernacles, and bended his knee before them, defiling thereby the Temple of the most High.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Morover, he oppressed the People, he laid heavy Burdens upon their Backs, and prepar'd a Yoke to gaul the Necks of the Righteous.</P>
<P N="5">V. He had no Son to inherit the Land, but yielding to the Devices of <HI>JEZEBEL</HI> his Queen; he consented to all she did, and own'd a spurious Issue to be his Legitimate Heir, and call'd his Name <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. This provoked the anger of the Lord; and He stirr'd up a Prince against him, who shou'd spoil him of all his Lands.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Now it came to pass, that Prince <HI>WILLIAM</HI> having espous'd <HI>MARY,</HI> the eldest Daughter of <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. That the chief of the Nobility and Gentry sent unto him, and said,</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Rise up, we pray thee, and come a∣mong us: Save and deliver the People of the true God, and suffer them not to be in Thral∣dom for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. Whereupon he presently arose, and gather'd unto him certain of his Host, and said unto them;</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
XI. Let us help those who are in Distress, and shake of the Bonds of those who are in Captivity, and restore the true Worship of the Lord.</P>
<P N="12">XII And he pass'd over into the Land of <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> and came into the <HI>West</HI> Part thereof, and there were daily gathered unto him such as should be SAVED</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Moreover, he put forth a Decla∣ration, saying, <HI>I come not to conquer the Kingdom, but to restore the true Worship of the God of our Fore-fathers.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV And the People cast up their Hats, and shouted for Joy, and crying aloud, said,</P>
<P N="15">XV. <HI>This is a blessed Day, we will re∣joyce and be merry in it.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. NOW, when these Tidings were brought unto <HI>JAMES</HI> the King, who was then at Dinner;</P>
<P N="17">XVII. He arose from his Chair, and stand∣ing up, said unto those who were round a∣bout him, <HI>What shall we</HI> do?</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. And then he sat down again, and fill'd his Belly, and it is recorded he was a great Eater;</P>
<P N="19">XIX. And his chief Counsellors said un∣to him, <HI>Let us go forth unto Battle,</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. And he said, <HI>We will go forth;</HI> but his Heart fail'd him.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
XXI HOWBEIT, in a few Days, he call'd unto him certain of the Chieftains, and Men of War.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. And he spoke unto them saying,</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. <HI>Let us make ready for Battle, and go forth to meet those who shall oppose us.</HI></P>
<P N="24">XXIV. And they march'd towards the Plains of <HI>SALISBURY.</HI></P>
<P N="25">XXV. And, behold, as he slept, he saw a Vision; and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an old Man cloath'd in white Arrayment, appear'd before him, and said, <HI>Return, for the Lord is not with thee.</HI></P>
<P N="26">XXVI. <HI>From this Day the Kingdom is rent from thee, and given unto another: even unto a Prince thy Kinsman, who serveth the Lord in Spirit, and in Truth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. VVHen the King awoke, he was sore troubled in mind.</P>
<P N="2">II. And having Eaten and Drunken plen∣tifully, he said unto those who were near him,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>I have seen a Vision, and it pleas∣eth me not; I will, therefore, arise, and re∣turn unto the Place from whence I came, for I will tarry here no longer.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
IV: And he 'rose up, and returned unto his Palace.</P>
<P N="5">V, <HI>Now</HI> he tarried but a short Space be∣fore he sent away his Queen <HI>Jezebel,</HI> and his supposed Son <HI>James</HI> unto a Neighbouring King.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And he himself retired to another Part of his Dominions, called <HI>Hibernia.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Now it came to pass, That Prince <HI>William</HI> marched toward the Capital City of <HI>Britain;</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. And the chief Rulers and Elders of the Kingdom being assembled together, did Vote and Consent, that the Prince and his Spouse <HI>Mary</HI> should be King and Queen thereof.</P>
<P N="9">IX. And they were annointed by the High Priest in the midst of all the Cong∣regation, and the Oil ran down even unto the Skirts of their Cloathing.</P>
<P N="10">X. And they did that which was Righte∣ous in the Sight of the Lord, and turned out those who had defiled the Temple.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <HI>JAMES</HI> being come into the King∣dom of <HI>Hibernia,</HI> did gather unto him Thousands and Ten Thousands of such who had drank with him of the Cup of A∣bomination.</P>
<P N="2">II. And he trusted unto the Multitude of his Host, unto his Pike-men, and his Horse∣men, and divided them into Troops, and in∣to Companies, of Fifties, and of Hundreds, and placed Captains over them.</P>
<P N="3">III. And he said unto them, <HI>Go ye forth into the North∣part of the Kingdom, and destroy all those who shall stand before ye.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. And they did as their Master com∣manded them; For they spared neither Male nor Female, neither had they any Regard unto the Cries of the Widows and the Or∣phans.</P>
<P N="5">V. Now, when these things came unto the Ears of the Children of <HI>Inniskelling,</HI> they armed themselves, and said.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>We will fight the Battle of the Lord; It is better to fall by the Sword, than to fall into the Hands of the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. And howbeit, they were but an Handful, yet they annoyed the Camp of heir Enemies, and slew many of them.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
VIII. But the Number of the Wicked increased, and the Children of <HI>Inneskilling</HI> were put to Flight, and they fled unto the City of <HI>Derry,</HI> and entered in at the Gates thereof.</P>
<P N="9">IX. And the Host of the Wicked follow∣ed after them, and came and pitched their Tents before the Walls of the City.</P>
<P N="10">X. And they summoned them to surrender saying, <HI>Yield ye your selves Prisoners, while it is yet well with ye,</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. But they answered with one Accord, <HI>We will not yield.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. So the City was besieged, and every Thing was very dear therein, for there was a Famine among them.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Insomuch, that a Dog's Head was sold for half a Crown, and a Rat for six∣pence.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. And some of the People began to murmure. and cry, <HI>Let us open the Gates, and yield unto them who are encamped against us, for there is plenty of good things among them.</HI></P>
<P N="15">XV. Then stood up the Governour who was also one of the Priests of the Temple, and said,</P>
<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Men and Brethren, know ye not</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
<HI>that we have a Saying, which is handed down unto us from our Forefathers, who themselves received it from the Mouth of the Godly;</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. <HI>Blessed are they who hold out unto the end.</HI></P>
<P N="18">XVIII. <HI>Who is he, therefore, that will seek his own Destruction, and Despise the Coun∣sel of the Righteous?</HI></P>
<P N="19">XIX. And they Answered and said,</P>
<P N="20">XX. <HI>We will not dwell in the Tents of the Ungodly, neither will we have Communion with the Wicked</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. And from thence forward they liv'd together as Brethren, and trusted in the Lord their God to save them.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. NOW, when these Tidings were brought unto King <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> he said,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Let us go forth and Assistour Brethren, for they are of the Houshold of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. And he made himself ready, and pass'd over into the <HI>North-part</HI> of <HI>HIBERNIA,</HI> and Landed at a Town call'd <HI>CARICK∣FERGUS.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. But such was the Care and Vigilance
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
of the good King, that he sent before him a Ship well stor'd with all Things necessary for the Relief of the City of <HI>DERRY.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. And she sail'd into the Mouth of the River; but there was a Boom laid cross the same, so that she cou'd not come near.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And they, who were in the City, ima∣gin'd that the Ship did belong unto the E∣nemy, and that she was sent to Attack them by Sea:</P>
<P N="7">VII. Therefore, they fir'd their Cannon against her, and did Damage unto her;</P>
<P N="8">VIII. But at length they perceiv'd she was their Friend, and she broke the Boom, and came into the Harbour of the City;</P>
<P N="9">IX. And they rejoic'd exceedingly, and were glad; giving Thanks for such timely Succour.</P>
<P N="10">X. But when the Wicked had heard, what good Things had happen'd unto those who were in the City, they were astonish'd:</P>
<P N="11">XI. And they struck their Tents, and fled (like a Thief) in the Night, and hasten'd unto their Master <HI>JAMES.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. In the Morning, when they, who defended the City, intended to have salli'd forth.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. They perceiv'd that their Enemies were gone; and there was no more of them.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
XIV. They consulted, therefore, among themselves, what was most proper to be done</P>
<P N="15">XV. And they tarry'd a while in the City and repair'd the Breaches and Damages there of, and took Care of such as were Sick and Wounded.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. And they left a good Garison there in, and furnish'd it with all Things which were requisite for its Defence, and marched to join King <HI>WILLIAM.</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. And forasmuch as there had been many <HI>Londoners</HI> among them, and by Rea∣son that all who were therein, acquitted themselves like Men.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. The City was no longer call'd <HI>DERRY,</HI> but <HI>LONDON-DERRY.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. KING <HI>WILLIAM</HI> having paci∣fy'd the Troubles in the <HI>North-part</HI> of the Kingdom, march'd towards <HI>Dub∣lin,</HI> which was the head City thereof.</P>
<P N="2">II. But as he came near unto the Town of <HI>Drougheda,</HI> he perceiv'd that the Ene∣mies of the Lord were encamp'd on the o∣ther side of the River, which is call'd the <HI>BOYN.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
III. And having held a Council of WAR, it was resolv'd, that the Army shou'd cross over (if possible) and drive the Enemy from their Entrenchments.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Now it came to pass, that some of the Men had found a Place which was ford∣able.</P>
<P N="5">V. And as King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> was put∣ting his Men in ARRAY, the Enemy fir'd against him, and a Bullet graz'd upon his Shoulder;</P>
<P N="6">VI. Whereupon it was straitway rumour∣ed, the King was killed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. This alarm'd all the Host, insomuch that many of their Hearts fail'd them, and their Countenances fell.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. But the good King hearing there∣of, shew'd himself among them; and pulling off his Hat, said, <HI>I am but slightly wounded.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Then the Horsemen pass'd over the River, and drove the Enemy from their Trenches.</P>
<P N="10">X. As soon as <HI>JAMES</HI> saw what they were doing, he call'd his Men about him, and said.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>Behold the undaunted Spirit of Eng∣lish-Men, whose Bellies being fill'd with Beef, and their Stomachs with Pudding, will slay e∣very one of ye, except ye provide for your selves.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>Haste, therefore and run; Follow</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<HI>me, for I will tarry no longer here.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. And Fear came upon them all: And they fled, albeit, they were by Thous∣ands more in Number than the Servants of the Lord.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That Night <HI>JAMES</HI> lay in <HI>DUBLIN.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THere was an Evil Counsellor who was call'd <HI>TYRCONNEL,</HI> and he said unto <HI>JAMES,</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Let us, I pray thee remove from hence, and go into another Country;</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>But before we depart, we will set Fire to this City, and lock up the Gates thereof, and then burn all the</HI> Protestants <HI>therein.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The Wrath of <HI>JAMES</HI> was kindl'd at this, and he would not consent un∣to it, but said,</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>I have been too wicked already and vio∣lated my Oath, provoking thereby the Judg∣ment of Heaven;</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>And shall I add Murder to my Breach of Faith? Who is he that adviseth me so to do?</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Thus the City was sav'd, and <HI>JAMES</HI> fled unto the King of the <HI>GAULS,</HI> from whom he crav'd Assistance.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="17" REF="15"/>
VIII. Now tho' <HI>JAMES</HI> was fur∣nish'd with Men and Necessaries;</P>
<P N="9">IX. Yet he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d not to go along with them but sent them into the Kingdom of <HI>HIBER∣NIA,</HI> while he himself tarry'd with <HI>JEZE∣BEL,</HI> and her Bastard.</P>
<P N="10">X. For he was infatuated, and bewitch∣ed with her Sorceries, and could not get out of the Pit into which she had drawn him.</P>
<P N="11">XI. And by him the Scripture was fulfil∣led, saying, <HI>A Whore is a deep Ditch, and he who is abhorr'l of the Lord shall fall therein.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. Now King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> had re∣duced to Obedience the Major part of the Kingdom of <HI>HIBERNIA;</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. But the City of <HI>LIMMERICK</HI> held out against him, and it was besieg'd, and taken at last by Capitulation.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. He fought the Battle at <HI>AUGH∣RIM,</HI> in which the <HI>French</HI> General, who was called St. <HI>RUTH,</HI> was kill'd with a Can∣non Ball.</P>
<P N="15">XV. And he discomfited them, and put them to Flight; and leaving the Kingdom in Peace, appointed Governors over it; and returned to <HI>LONDON,</HI> which is the Me∣tropolis of <HI>GREAT-BRITAIN.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A War being proclaim'd between <HI>WIL∣LIAM,</HI> King of <HI>Britain;</HI> and <HI>LEWIS,</HI> King of the <HI>GAULS,</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>STATES</HI> of <HI>HOLLAND,</HI> and divers Princes and Potentates enter'd into a Confederacy against <HI>LEWIS,</HI> who aim'd at an universal Monarchy;</P>
<P N="3">III. And they drew their Armies forth, and the Seat of the War was in <HI>FLAN∣DERS.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. About this Time dy'd Queen <HI>MA∣RY;</HI> and there were Lamentations and Mournings for her in all Parts of the King∣dom, for she was belov'd of her Subjects, and had done that which was Righteous in the Sight of the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">V. However, the War was carry'd on, Battles were fought, and Towns were tak∣en; and they, who were slain, were many in Number.</P>
<P N="6">VI. At length, the King of the <HI>GAULS</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u'd for Peace, which was granted him; and it was call'd the Peace of <HI>RESWICK.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Not long after dy'd <HI>JAMES,</HI> who had been King of <HI>BRITAIN.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="19" REF="17"/>
VIII. Now <HI>LEWIS</HI> hoping to accom∣plish his Ends, prostituted the Faith he had made, and set up the suppos'd Son of <HI>James,</HI> to be King of <HI>Scotland, England,</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. This provok'd the Indignation of the Confederates, and their Spirits were mov'd thereat.</P>
<P N="10">X. Whereupon a second War broke out, and the Forces were assembl'd together, and they enter'd into the Plains, and many were killed on both Sides.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Every Winter, when the Weather was too cold to keep in open Fields,</P>
<P N="12">XII. King <HI>William</HI> return'd to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. And being well stricken in Years, the Toils and Fatigues of many Campaigns sat heavy upon him; for he had been a War∣rior from his Youth upwards:</P>
<P N="14">XIV. And He sicken'd, and kept his Bed, and perceiving that the Time of his Disso∣lution drew nigh, he sent for his next Suc∣cessor,</P>
<P N="15">XV. And he spent two Days in giving her wholesome Advice and Instructions, and in recommending wise Counsellors unto her: And having establish'd the true Worship of the most High, and settl'd the Nation in such Ease and Prosperity, as the People had
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
not seen for many Years; He gave up the Ghost, and died in a good old Age.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. All the Kingdom was griev'd for the Loss of him; they mourn'd and wept bitter∣ly, for he had been the Instrument under God, which had redeem'd them from Bon∣dage, and had restor'd unto them their Li∣berty.</P>

<HEAD>CAAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>QUeen <HI>Anne</HI> succeeded King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II: And coming to the Throne of her Ancestors, she proclaimed War against the King of the <HI>Gauls:</HI> forasmuch, as he had of∣fered an Indignity to her, in setting up a <HI>Pretender</HI> to her Realms,</P>
<P N="3">III Which Tidings being brought unto King <HI>Lewis,</HI> who was then at Dinner,</P>
<P N="4">IV. He looked up to Heaven, and crossing himself, said,</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Sweet Virgin, have Mercy upon me; it is manifest that I am now grown old, for even the Women do proclaim War against me,</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. And they prepared their Arms for Battle,</P>
<P N="7">VII. Now Queen <HI>Anne</HI> choose unto her self a Captain, whose Name was <HI>John,</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. The same was a great Warrior, and
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
a skilful Man, a Lover of his Countrey, and one who feared the Lord;</P>
<P N="9">IX. And he went forth, and fought the Queen's Battles: and slew Thousands, and Ten Thousands of her Enemies, and put the rest to Flight</P>
<P N="10">X. He took <HI>Tallard</HI> Prisoner, who was Captain of the Gauls, and their Ensigns and Trophies of War at <HI>Hockstet,</HI> and drove the rest of his Foes down to the River <HI>Danube,</HI> wherein many were drowned, and the Place is called <HI>Hockstet</HI> unto this Day,</P>
<P N="11">XI. Many more Battles were fought by him, the Particulars of which should I go a∣bout to relate, I fear I should not have room enough to contain them,</P>
<P N="12">XII. Moreover he laid Siege to their strong Towns, and to their Castles; and sacked every one of them,</P>
<P N="13">XIII. He undertook nothing in which he did not prosper, for the Lord was with him in all he did,</P>
<P N="14">XIV. About this Time <HI>Corah,</HI> one of the Priests of the Temple began to preach publickly,</P>
<P N="15">XV. He was a Stirrer up of Sedition, and a Mover of the People,</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The Father was set against the Son, and the Son envied the Father,</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Their Divisions were many, their
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
Breaches were wide: and there was no Chri∣stianity, no Brotherly Love among them,</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. They cried out, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord</HI> is in Danger.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. This did <HI>Corah,</HI> and all his Fol∣lowers, that they might set upon the Throne the supposed Son of <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. Now it came to pass, that Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was prevailed upon to change her Mi∣nistry.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. She turned out those who had ser∣ved her faithfully, and from that Time for∣ward her Affairs did not prosper,</P>
<P N="22">XXII. She placed in their Room Persons who deceived her; they imposed upon her, for she was but a Woman,</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. They sold their Country, they betray'd the Nation, they were paving the Way to bring in Idolatry, which is the A∣bomination of the Lord.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. They made a base, scandalous, and dishonourable Peace; they forsook their Friends, and suffer'd to be massacred the brave People of <HI>CATALONIA,</HI> who had fought for them.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. They had gotten the Power into their own Hands, they did what they list, and said among themselves, <HI>Who is he that can stand against us?</HI></P>
<P N="26"><PB N="23" REF="21"/>
XXVI. They were Confederates with the King of the <HI>GAULS,</HI> and he tempted them with Gold.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. They had not God in all their Thoughts, but were led away by the Wiles of Satan.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. But the Race is not always to the Swift, nor the Battle unto the Strong: For it is better to trust in the Lord, than put any Confidence in the Arm of Flesh,</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. Wherefore the Lord cut them short in the midst of their Career, and dis∣appointed them of all their Hopes.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. For Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> dy'd; and some of her evil Councellors fled into a strange Land, knowing the Evil which they had done, and others were put into Prison.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. She was bury'd in the Tomb of her Ancestors, and Good King <HI>GEORGE</HI> Reign'd in her Stead.</P>
