WAYS AND MEANS; OR, <HI>A TRIP TO DOVER.</HI></P>
<P>A COMEDY, IN THREE ACTS, As it is Performed at the <HI>THEATRE-ROYAL,</HI> HAY-MARKET.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Reader of the following Comedy is a reader of Newspapers in general, he will, probably, sit down to peruse it with some prejudice in it's disfavour. To do away this prejudice, it is recommended to begin where he would naturally finish; and read the <HI>Epilogue</HI> first. The grovelling <HI>Doer</HI> of daily Papers has, there, been disturbed in his occupation: and who that disturbs a Scavenger, while he is driving his dirty vehicle through the town, is expected to escape without being plentifully bespat∣tered?</P>
<P>That the present Piece has experienced this kind of nasty revenge, is obvious: and, in most of the publick prints, it has been</P>
<L>"Winnow'd with so rough a wind,</L>
<L>"That even its Corn has seem'd as light as Chaff,</L>
<L>"And good from bad found no partition!"</L>
<P>The soreness which the venal spinners of malicious paragraph have evinced, on this occasion, is an acknowledgment that they feel themselves closely described in the Epi∣logue. It is a cap, which, with some very few exceptions, (as fitly as "your barber's chair fits all"—very opposite ex∣tremities,) fits all their <HI>heads.</HI> The thick head, the soft head, the block-head, or any head.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
The few heads it does <HI>not</HI> fit—the im∣partial heads of Newspaper criticism—sacrcely, perhaps, exceeding the heads of Cerberus in number—cannot be wounded by the exposure of their community. They may laugh, indeed, like Falstaff, at the ap∣pearance of his ragged regiment, and cry—</P>
<P>'If I am not ashamed of my <HI>brethren,</HI> I am a souc'd gurnet! A hundred and fifty tatter'd prodigals, lately come from swine-keeping; from eating draffs and husks!" but they may, also, say, "for their <HI>malice,</HI> I know not where they had that, and for their <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ostitution—</HI>I am sure they never learnt that of <HI>Me."</HI></P>
<P>Men of candour and shrewd remark, pub∣lickly chronicled for unbiass'd opinion.—The Bees of Criticism, who are pleas'd in selecting the sweets of an Author, when he has any, and seldom sting till they are provoked; it would be wanton, and absurd to attack: but the <HI>Grubs—</HI>the canker∣worms—insects generated from corruption, and detrimental to the fair fruits of industry—every labourer in the Dramatick vine∣yard is doing good, when he treads on them. Pity it is the <HI>Grubs</HI> are so very nu∣merous! Pity, that the Canker-worms can prey upon more than the produce of scenick fiction! and that many respectable and flourishing branches of this kingdom are suf∣fer'd to be blighted by their pestilential pol∣lution!</P>
<P>The Calumny heap'd on individuals, in daily prints, generally convey'd with art
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
sufficient to elude the letter of the Law, is notorious, and calls aloud for reform. The liberty of the Press is profaned by the licen∣tiousness of the Newspapers. It becomes a sanctuary for the worst of all assassins—the assassins of private character—the man∣glers of reputation, and the dark murderers of the peace of families!</P>
<P>The trader in assassination is seldom with∣out a double calling: The Bravo finds fre∣quent practice in the capacity of Pander. In Newspapers, the qualifications for either are inseparable; and the ruffian, who stabs with slander and defamation, is seen grossly serving the purposes of employers, who will pay the price of his venality.—The ab∣ject tool of those who lust for fame, and condescend to hire a despicable animal to procure it!</P>
<P>It has been asserted, in the silly triumph of vapid Citicism, after considering <HI>Ways and Means</HI> as inferior to the Author's more early production, <HI>Inkle and Yarico,</HI> that little can be expected from the future efforts of a pen, which already manifests imbecillity, and promises annual declension. Direct praise never gratifies so effectually as unin∣tentional commendation: and when the Author declares Inkle and Yarico, though <HI>previously</HI> acted, to have been <HI>subsequently</HI> written, he cannot help smiling, more, per∣haps, with contempt than pleasure, at the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
undesigned compliment which pronounces his progressive improvement.</P>
<P>This Comedy, however, has completely answered his expectations; which were too limited to expose him to much disappoint∣ment. Not attempting to fix serious atten∣tion by his story, he sees it, with indifference, receive as little as he has bestow'd upon it. Laugh and whim were his objects; and the mirth and good humour of his audi∣ence, whatever malice or misrepresentation may affirm to the contrary, have convinced him that his design is accomplish'd.</P>

<LG>
<L>ARE all the Members here?—I miss some faces—</L>
<L>My Honourable Friends! pray keep your places.</L>
<L>To-night, with head and heart at your devotion,</L>
<L>A scheming Bard brings forward a new Motion:</L>
<L>Opens his Budget, in the following Scenes,</L>
<L>And to your Candour trusts his <HI>Ways and Means.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some testy Critic, with contemptuous sneer,</L>
<L>Exclaims—"a Poet, and a Financier!</L>
<L>In paths untrodden, rashly, dare advance,</L>
<L>And blend <HI>Poetic</HI> Numbers, with Finance!"</L>
<L>At first, the Censure may not seem untrue;</L>
<L>For what has Fiction with Finance to do?</L>
<L>Yet, since all Fashions have been learnt from France,</L>
<L>There's nothing now <HI>but</HI> fiction in Finance.</L>
<L>Be it my task, with triumph, to explain</L>
<L>The vast resources of the Poet's brain.</L>
<L>No earthly house has he, that needs repair,</L>
<L>He builds ideal castles—in the air!</L>
<L>Parnassus yields his Muse a soft retreat,</L>
<L>While rich Pactolus flows beneath his feet.</L>
<L>Yet in these days of Commerce, and plain Sense,</L>
<L>When Poetry is valued less than Pence,</L>
<L>Some hard, <HI>Prosaic</HI> Butcher, may refuse,</L>
<L>A Leg of Mutton to a hungry Muse:</L>
<L>Unfeeling Tapsters, cold to Fancy's beams,</L>
<L>Won't barter Porter, for Pactolian streams:</L>
<L>Not Homer's Verse, nor Orpheus' sounding Lyre,</L>
<L>Could buy one Peck of Coals, to feed their fire.</L>
<L>From others Woes, our Bard Experience gleans,</L>
<L>And turns his active Muse to "Ways and Means;"</L>
<L>Do you grant largely the Supplies; nor fear</L>
<L>A Tax too heavy for another year.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my thorough, clumsey, talkative innkeeper!—and now, my dear Scru∣ple, after our night's journey, welcome to Do∣ver. Here we are, you see—not with the old, stale intention of taking a voyage to the conti∣nent; but a voyage to the island of Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scruple.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose we should find neither wind nor tide in our favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then we shall be love bound here a little, that's all. But, hang it, why anticipate evils? If we are to be unlucky, the less we think of it the better—confound all thinking, say I.</P>

<P>Confound thinking, Mr. Random! I'm sure it's high time to think—and that very seriously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-day! Moralizing! "Confound thinking, Mr. Random!" Yes, Sir, confound thinking:—I'm sure thinking would confound us; and most confoundedly too, Mr. Scruple, at present.</P>

<P>Yet one can't help having one's doubts.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh! prithee don't doubt at all—doubt∣ing is mean and mechanical; and never enter'd the head or heart of a gentleman. Why, now, if you observe from our own daily experience, the people that doubted most were either our—taylors, or tavern-keepers, or shoe-makers; or some such pitiful puppies—Zounds, man, don't be faint-hearted now! we shall never win our fair ladies, at this rate—besides, haven't we all the reasonable hopes in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we are sure of <HI>their</HI> good wish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly—and as to any trifling ob∣stacies, such as father and mother, or so—chance must direct us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may not those trifling obstacles you mention—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! doubting again! why you are more of a Mandarin, on a chimney piece, than a man—there's no touching you but your head begins shaking. Consider, we attack'd 'em at Bath, where they were three weeks ago, on a visit to a female friend, without impertinent relations about 'em to give 'em advice—and made, I think, no inconsiderable progress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted; But they were then suddenly call'd home to their father's, the baronet's, near Dover, here; who hinted, in his letter, at no very distant match for both of 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>O never fear: if the girls are averse to it; and they, at our parting, like simple dam∣sels in romance, bewail'd their cruel fate, while we, like true knights errant, promis'd to rescue them from confinement. But you had more opportunities with your flame than I: why did not you marry her at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I lov'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that's some reason too—you would have made a damn'd unfashionable figure, I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me, I had too much honour to impose on my Harriet's amiable sim∣plicity; and have the utmost detestation for mar∣rying merely to make a fortune. In these in∣terested cases, if we keep up appearances, after marriage, the wife becomes a clog and incum∣brance; if we throw off the mask, we are mak∣ing a worthy woman, perhaps, miserable, who
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
has afforded the only means of making her hus∣band easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty romantick, truly! and charm∣ing policy for a fellow without a guinea!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>My policy was chosen from the Pro∣verb, Random; I thought honesty the best. I confessed to her my embarrass'd circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Told her I had nothing to boast of but my family; whom my imprudence had dis∣obliged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>And thus, by candidly acknowledging myself unworthy her affections, I, undesignedly, insur'd them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pugh! this may do well enough for the grave, sentimental, elder sister: but Kitty's the girl for my taste—young, wild, frank, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady to run into my arms, without the trouble of dying or sighing. Her mind full of fun, her eyes full of fire, her head full of novels, her heart full of love—aye, and her pocket full of mo∣ney, my boy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we must now find means to introduce ourselves to the family; I dread en∣count'ring the old folks too—people in the country here, are apt to be suspicious; they ask queer questions sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the mere effect of their situation; where they get more health than polish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet old country families—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>

<P>A decent young man, Sir—that cou'd dress wigs, write a running-hand, and preferr'd a sober, steady family. I shav'd my oldmaster, bottled off his wine, copied his papers, and kept the key of his cabinet and cellar—In short, Sir, I was his prime minister.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor any thing else. I have dangled after half the heirs in town, without an acknowledgment: making myself the imagi∣nary friend of their imaginary wants, merely to introduce 'em to you, as a man of honour, and secrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, if required.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted—It says so in the advertise∣ment—and did not they come to you, when, if it was not sor me, they wou'd have been accommo∣dated, at a genteel end of the town? instead of which, I trudg'd 'em thro' the Strand, towards the Bar, all winter long, with their boots, and high collars, for fear of sore throats, to chew your tough chops, in the back parlour. Then they'd clap you on the back, call you by your christian name, tell damn'd lies, and swear you were an honest fellow, to make you come down with the ready. And who was, then, the disin∣terested, moderate man, to settle a proper pre∣mium, between the parties? Why I, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is there a worse security in the world than your fellows of fashion? Your snug man of business, when he puts his name to a note, is always punctual in his payments; or else we lock him in limbo,—safe in the house of bon∣dage. Now your man of fashion always gets safe in another house; and if he can't duly pay, why he gets duly elected, and I have a false return for my money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's not the case here, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but it's as bad. A pretty wild goose chace we have had, here! Ram'd into a post chaise, with more expence than speed; gaping at hops, thro' a cursed small beer coun∣try, and after two youngsters, who by this time, I take it, have hopped over to Calais. That's
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
another genteel way of chousing an honest credi∣tor. The coast of France is edg'd with English insolvents. Calais is a King's bench, and Boulogne little more than a Marshalsea. A parcel of prodigal, web-footed spendthrifts, come here, and take water, like ducks:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but they are lame ducks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>While we, who have hatch'd 'em, like hens, in the shell of their dissipation, stand clucking complaints on the shore, without daring to follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, accidents will happen sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who brought this accident about, but the dapper Mr. Quirk? with your plaguy politick pate! a thick, Simmon's-Inn skull, only fit to peep thro' a pillory. You must be sending <HI>Me</HI> your two, fine, St. James's gentlemen. Dam'me, there's more poor rogues, I believe, in that parish than St. Giles's! all in a gang too.—Knaves of clubs everyone of them—and there my two youngsters coax'd me over with a pretty refreshing story of friends in the country, and rich old fathers with fine crazy constitutions. Charming church-yard coughs, and pretty touches of the rheumatism. Sweet bile, and delightful bad livers! It put one in spirits to hear them talk; and you, you booby, to back it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I had it from the best autho∣rity. However, young Random's father is abroad for his health; and every body says in a fine, fair way of dying; and then you'll be in a fair way of recovery. The report is current, my old lad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the son got current cash for it; and now he must go abroad, too; with a
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
cursed consumptive pocket, I warrant: and that other oily-tongued fellow, Mr. Scruple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why call me in question! Could not you see for yourself? Didn't they ask you to dine with 'em? and wer'n't you foolish enough to drink, and grow open hearted? and then when Random told you he'd take you to Shooters' Hill in his Phaeton—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! no such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't you chuckle, and whisper he was an honest fellow? and tho' I kept winking, and pulling your sleeve, did not you take notes which were due the day they set off, and give a draft for the three thousand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, it's enough to drive one mad to think on't! You got the warrant back'd by the Sheriff of Canterbury?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quirk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, by the <HI>Sub,</HI> and all may be re∣pair'd at last. We have trac'd 'em truly to this house, and if the tide hasn't serv'd, we may nab 'em yet. Come along, old Round. We'll pump the waiters, sound our host, and success, no doubt will crown our enquiries. Come along!</P>

<P>The young ladies, Sir David, are happy in their resemblance of so accomplish'd a mother.</P>

<P>An agreeable amusement! Gentle∣men's play-houses are much to be wish'd for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine fun, is'n't it? We had a touch of dramaticks once ourselves, at the hall here—gutted a kitchen, and filled it with fly-flaps—All gentlemen players, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>A kitchen! And how did your players perform?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Players! Pokers! Empty as pots; and as flat as the dresser.</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh, fie, Sir David! You know, Sir Simon Squab came from London on purpose; and every body said his Romeo was charm∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! gad, that's true: forgot Squab. True deary;—fine,—very fine, indeed, for a gentleman: his figure, to be sure, wasn't so cleverly cut out for the character. A fat fubsy phiz, sunk between a couple of round shoulders, and, damme, he croak'd like a toad in a hole. What do you say to a hop in the garden, eh? Look at the lawn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, at present, Sir David—</P>

<P>I've heard Sir David mention—</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quiet. Coming from Paul's one night, where I picked you up in an odd sort of a strange style—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was rather—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! Got into my coach—all alone, dull as hell, dark as the devil: so to amuse myself, fell fast asleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entertaining, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very—I know it. When the car∣riage came to the hill, rubb'd my eyes to wake, out of one corner, and saw Skurry stuck up in the other. I thought coachy had cramm'd in a corpse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did you behave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sat still: frighten'd out of my wits, till I got home; and John came out with a candle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did he explain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Easy enough. Got drunk upon business; going to town; pop'd into my carriage for the mail-coach, to secure a good place before the rest of the passengers; and as the hostler cross'd the yard in the dark, bid him shut the door, and be damn'd to him. Made us mon∣strous merry, didn't it, love?</P>

<P>Lard, Sir David, how you teize gentlemen to walk, who have scarcely recovered from the rattle of the road: your friends have no relish for pigs now; besides, it's so late, we shall hardly have time to dress for dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! gad that's true. No dinner without dressing.—Won't walk.—Well, do as you like: I leave you here with my dear Lady Dunder. <HI>(To Lady</HI> D.) Talk to 'em, deary, do; give 'em a sketch of the county: Some Dover scandal, and Canterbury tales, quite in your way, lovee. She knows all about you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I told all, just as I had it from Paul. Make her prattle to you, do you hear? Devilish deal of solid sense about her, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we are convinc'd of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll just take a turn, and abuse my people: see what's going on within and with∣out—house and garden; farm and fire-side: look at the plate and the pantry: gape at the geese, and the ducks, and the dogs, and the hogs, and the logs. Must go—damn'd sorry: must mind my little cutter of cabbages; an idle, eating, cheating dog; and wou'd sooner be damn'd than dig. He's of no more use in the garden than Adam: for he steals every apple he can find, and won't even take the pains of grafting a gooseberry bush.</P>

<P>It is not in my nature: bred up in the country, I have imbibed notions, which the re∣finement of a town education might term ro∣mantick; for I have preferr'd happiness to splen∣dor; nor have I blushed to own to you, the af∣fections of an honest, generous mind, have much more weight with me, than the allurements of pomp and fortune: appriz'd of these sentiments, tempt me no more, I beg, Sir; nor strive to take advantage of a partiality, which would be ill-placed on one who vou'd recommend to me so inconsiderate a behaviour.</P>

<P>Be quiet; I know it; married so myself, Hal. Shouldn't have had my dear lady Dunder if I had not been hasty. All agreed on before we met; coupled in a quarter of an hour after I saw her; come together as people dance minuets; I bow'd, she curtsey'd, and, egad, I had her by the left hand in a moment.</P>

<P>Hush! aye is this the return for

<P>Give! gad you'd have taken leave without asking—French leave if I had not been here; have smuggled my goods in the dark, trotted over the Tweed, and been hammer'd to∣gether by a bare-breech'd blacksmith. A fine Scotch union, egad! my two rich roses here tied to a pair of poor pitiful thistles! but zounds! I'll have satisfaction.</P>
</SP>

<P>For heaven's sake, my dear!—cool your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holer a little, Sir David.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quiet. What have I had a sword bobbing between my legs, at Dover hops, and quiet country meetings, for these twenty years; and now not rub off its rust, in the oily guts of a couple of whale catchers, for what I know to the contrary?</P>

<P>But that rascal, that rogue, Roundfee, I think they call him, he can, I be∣lieve. Here have I and poor Carney just been taken into custody for you at Dover; while you have been playing your pranks at large all over the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Dav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! be quiet—Cursed ungenteel though in you, if you are his father. Why, Zounds! you have us'd me worse than they! Get yourself lock'd up for your son here, with a plague to you! that he and his friend may have time to run off with my daughters.</P>

<P>Your unguarded kindness to strangers might have been attended with much more dis∣agreeable consequences. You took our charac∣ters from report, I see. Characters which we never thought of assuming.</P>

<P>Oh! Damn Paul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scrup.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“Our invitation was unsought: and

though our manner of requiting your favours appears unjustifiable, you may congratulate yourself, that instead of being practis'd upon by men, unworthy your countenance, you have met with gentlemen.”</Q></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir David.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“Here's two fine fellows! come into my house—going to carry off half on't on their shoulders—and then—I have met with gentlemen.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scruple.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our conduct, Sir David, is not so culpable as you imagine. A chance, like your present invitation, threw us in your daughters' way at Bath, and our continued affection (I think I may answer for my friend) may prove our mo∣tives are unguided by interest: as a further proof of it, we disclaim all views of their fortune.—Bestow but their hands, Sir David, and we shall be happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! Zounds! something noble in that too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><Q>“But to think of carrying away our two dear rosy girls here; handsomer than all” the pale chits of the county.</Q></P>

<P>Hush! handsomer! <Q>Ay, and richer “too! with pockets full of money: housewives stuff'd with bank notes; and work bags cramm'd with guineas.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I begin to think Dick is not such a sad dog as I took him for. Eh! Carncy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perfectly of your opinion, Mr. Random.</P>

<P>And what has the other gentleman to say for himself?</P>
<STAGE><HI>(To</HI> Random.)</STAGE>

<SP>

<P>Indeed, Mamma, we are not so much to blame, neither.</P>
</SP>

<P>Love, Madam, all powerful love, must plead my excuse; a passion which may

<P>Well, I vow the young man pleads so prettily in his defence that—</P>

<P>If your ladyship and my father could forget past occurrences, and join with me in my suit to Sir David for an union with his daugh∣ter—I hope my future conduct—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um!—Why, as things are so, Sir David; and my connections are pretty con∣siderable—my estate pretty well known—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carn.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good six thousand a year—I have known my good friend here some time; and have had his property under my eye, for these five years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his friend, I am happy to tell you, is as well connected as he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he? Well, as matters are—and as my Lord might find a flaw here—an ugly business, not much to his liking—I think we can but in honour be off—so to prevent cursed country scandal, gabbling girls, ugly old maids, and all that—I think we may as well—my Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you think proper, Sir David.—Harriet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are bound now, Madam, both by inclination and duty to follow your com∣mands.</P>

<P>Yes, Mamma, we are both bound.</P>

<P>And now, Kitty, I am your prisoner for life.</P>

<P>Remember, Roundfee, tho'—There you might have been a prisoner not much to your liking.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir David.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! a usurer! Dam'me, let's duck him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Rand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! he and his gentleman may be settled with at leisure. Their blunders have left them to our mercy, and they merit none, I promise you—Fellows whose business it is to prey upon the unthinking, extort from the needy, and live upon the distresses of mankind, deserve very little compassion, when they are distressed themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it.—But here, however, they shall have no distresses to prey upon—No moping melancholy looks now. All's well, I hope, at last, as it ought to be—and nothing ought to give any of us, here, so much pleasure as looking, to-night, on a set of very merry faces.</P>
