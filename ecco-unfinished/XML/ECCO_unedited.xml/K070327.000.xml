<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following lines were occasioned by the Author's having lately studied, with infinite attention, several fashionable productions in the <HI>Sentimental</HI> stile; in most of which, a misapplica∣tion, not a defect, of talents seems to have betrayed their Authors into some degree of false Taste. For example. A Noble Author has lately published his works, which consist of <HI>three</HI> compositions. <HI>One,</HI> an Ode upon the death of Mr. Gray: the <HI>two</HI> others, upon the death of his Lordship's <HI>Spaniel.</HI></P>
<P>But the reigning fashion in modern <HI>poesy</HI> is <HI>Senti∣mental Panegyrick</HI> on <HI>Married Beauties.</HI> This ap∣pears in a thousand various Shapes; from <HI>Bouts Rhimeès</HI> on the <HI>wou'd-be Sappho</HI> of Bath, up to <HI>Doggerel Epistles</HI> to the lovely <HI>Amoret.</HI></P>
<P>In attempting to ridicule this modish folly, it is scarcely necessary to apologize to the several Person∣ages of the <HI>Sentimental train,</HI> for introducing their names. When a Poet announces himself, and
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>publicly wears his Laurels, He is lawful game for the Critics: And it makes no difference, whether his works come from the Press, or, according to Sir <HI>Benjamin Backbite</HI>'s system, <HI>"circulate in Manu∣script."</HI> Besides, to canvass the <HI>slighter imperfections,</HI> either of stile or of conduct, seems to be the limit of poetical censure. It is only the desperate Saty∣rist, whose invenomed pen strikes at the character and honour of Individuals, that perverts and dis∣graces Poetry:—Such aspersions, if well founded, are too gross for the tribunal of the Muses; and if, (as is generally the case) they are utterly false, they recoil not only on the Author, but on the very art itself, which can so easily be perverted to so bad a Purpose.— But who can be hurt by a Critique on his <HI>Charades</HI> and <HI>Rebusses?</HI>—An imputation of false Taste may not be very pleasant, but it never can seriously offend Men of sense and good-breeding: Both which qualities, as the Author agrees with all the world in acknowledging <HI>his Personages</HI> to possess in the highest degree, so he requests that not only they, but the few others who may happen to read his Poem, will acquit him of any intention to give the slightest offence.</P>

<HEAD>THE WREATH of FASHION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first the Muse recorded Beauty's praise</L>
<L>In glowing numbers, and enraptur'd lays,</L>
<L>Sweet was the Poet's song; undeck'd by art;</L>
<L>For Love was Nature, and his theme the heart.</L>
<L>At Beauty's shrine how brightly Genius glow'd!</L>
<MILESTONE N="5"/>
<L>There, her wild wreaths luxuriant fancy strew'd;</L>
<L>Whose flowrets, wak'd by Love's enliv'ning ray,</L>
<L>Scatter'd with native sweets the artless lay.</L>
<L>Such were the strains th'enamour'd <HI>Ovid</HI> sung;</L>
<L>Such the fond lays that flow'd from <HI>Prior</HI>'s tongue:</L>
<MILESTONE N="10"/>
<L>Nor of its best reward was verse beguil'd,</L>
<L>When <HI>Julia</HI> own'd its pow'r, and <HI>Chloe</HI> smil'd.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<LG>
<L>Far other lays denote the modern Bard—</L>
<L>Nor love his theme—nor Beauty his reward:</L>
<L>His temp'rate verse a gentler homage pays,</L>
<MILESTONE N="15"/>
<L>And sighs serenely for unfeeling praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This purer taste, this philosophic art,</L>
<L>(If thou, O Sentiment! thy aid impart)</L>
<L>The Muse shall sing—attend ye glitt'ring train</L>
<L>Of sighing Beaux, nor scorn the votive strain;</L>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>
<L>Tho' harsh the verse, tho' rude the unpolish'd lay,</L>
<L>Soft is the tender science they display.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First, for true grounds of Sentimental lore,</L>
<L>The scenes of modern Comedy explore;</L>
<L>Dramatic Homilies! devout and sage,</L>
<MILESTONE N="25"/>
<L>Stor'd with wise maxims, "both for youth and age."</L>
<L>Maxims, that scorning their old homely dress,</L>
<L>Shift from plain proverbs to spruce sentences.</L>
<L>But chief, let <HI>Cumberland</HI> thy Muse direct;</L>
<L>High Priest of all the Tragic-comic sect!</L>
<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<L>Mid darts and flames his Lover <HI>cooly</HI> waits;</L>
<L>Calm as a Hero, cas'd in <HI>Hartley's plates;</HI></L>
<L>'Till damp'd, and chill'd by sentimental sighs,</L>
<L>Each stifled passion in a vapour dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence form thy taste, hence strew thy temp'rate lays</L>
<L>With moral raptures, and sententious praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus skill'd, with critic care thy subject choose;</L>
<L>A kindred theme, congenial to thy Muse.</L>
<L>No giddy Nymph, of youth and beauty vain,</L>
<L>But some fair Stoic, link'd in Hymen's chain:</L>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<L>Serene and cold; by wise Indiff'rence led</L>
<L>To a rich Title, and a—sep'rate bed.</L>
<L>Now, sick of vanity, with grandeur cloy'd,</L>
<L>She leans on Sentiment, to sooth the void:</L>
<L>Deep in Rousseau, her purer thoughts approve</L>
<MILESTONE N="45"/>
<L>The Metaphysics of Platonic Love.</L>
<L>Thine be the task, with quaint, fantastic phrase,</L>
<L>To variegate her unimpassion'd praise.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<LG>
<L>Poetic Compliments from Sonnets cull—</L>
<L>Harmonious quibbles, logically dull!</L>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<L>True to their gage of Paradox, they chime</L>
<L>Problems in verse, and sophistry in rhyme—</L>
<L>Yet, thro' these <HI>lymbecks,</HI> Cowley's patient Muse</L>
<L>From mimic sighs distill'd Castalian dews:</L>
<L>So Spencer toil'd, to sooth the Royal Maid;</L>
<MILESTONE N="55"/>
<L>So hapless Petrarch wept his Laura's shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But hence, tame Precept!—let example lead</L>
<L>The modish Poet to his glorious meed:</L>
<L>Haste, to the radiant shrine of Fashion, haste!</L>
<L>There, form thy genius, there, correct thy taste.</L>
<MILESTONE N="60"/>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lo! the glitt'ring Altar stands confest!</L>
<L>Loose o'er the Goddess floats her motley vest:</L>
<L>As Flora, gay, as Iris, wildly bright,</L>
<L>Its varying lustre strikes the dazzled sight.</L>
<L>Here, Vanity, with flow'rs and feathers crown'd,</L>
<MILESTONE N="65"/>
<L>Sports with the Seasons thro' their airy round.</L>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<L>Here, spurious Art and mimic Science pour</L>
<L>Whims of a day, and theories of an hour.</L>
<L>The Goddess smiles; for, lo! ev'n Poets trace</L>
<L>Her local charms, her temporary grace—</L>
<MILESTONE N="70"/>
<L>Above the rest, how fondly she regards</L>
<L>Her fav'rite train, the Sentimental Bards!</L>
</LG>

<L>On a spruce pedestal of <HI>Wedgwood ware,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Millar</HI> convenes her literary Rout)</L>
<MILESTONE N="80"/>
<L>With votive song, and tributary verse,</L>

<L>What soft poetic incense breaths around!</L>
<L>What soothing hymns from Adulation sound!</L>

<L>Soft flows the lay; as when, with tears, He paid</L>
<L>The last sad honours to his—Spaniel's shade!</L>
<L>And lo! he grasps the badge of wit, a wand;</L>
<L>He waves it thrice, and <HI>Storer</HI> is at hand;</L>
<MILESTONE N="90"/>
<L>Famish'd as pennance, as devotion pale,</L>

<L><HI>Fitzpatrick</HI>'s Muse waits for some lucky hit;</L>
<L>For, still the slave of Chance, He <HI>throws</HI> at wit.</L>
<L>While <HI>Townshend</HI> his pathetic bow displays,</L>
