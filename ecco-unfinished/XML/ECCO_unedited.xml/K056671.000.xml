<HEAD>REASONS AGAINST THE <HI>Succession,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT Strife is here among you all? And what a Noise about who shall or shall not be King, <HI>the Lord knows when?</HI> Is it not a strange thing we can't be quiet with the Queen we have, but we must all fall into Confusion and Combustions about who shall come after? Why, pray Folks, How Old is the Queen, and when is she to Die, that here is this Pother made about it? I have heard wise People say the Queen is not Fifty Years Old, that she has no Distemper but the Gout, that is a Long∣life Disease, which generally holds Peo∣ple out Twenty, or Thirty, or Forty Years; and let it go how it will, the Queen may well enough linger out Twenty or Thirty Years, and not be a Huge Old Wife nei∣ther.
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Now! What say the <HI>People,</HI> must we think of living Twenty or Thirty Years in this wrangling Condition we are now in? This would be a Torment worse than some of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Plagues, and would be intolerable to bear tho' for fewer Years than that. The Animosities of this Nation, should they go on, as it seems they go on now, would by time be come to such a Height, that all Charity, Society, and Mutual Agree∣ment among us, will be destroy'd. Christi∣ans shall we be call'd! No; Nothing of the People call'd Christians will be to be found among Us. Nothing of Christianity, or the Substance of Christianity, <HI>viz.</HI> Cha∣rity, will be found among Us! The Name Christian may be assum'd, but it will be all Hypocrisie and Delusion; the Being of Christianity must be lost in the Fog, and Smoke, and Stink, and Noise, and Rage, and Cruelty, of our Quarrel about a King. Is this Rational? Is it Agreeable to the true Interest of the Nation? What must become of Trade, of Religion, of Society, of Relation, of Families, of People? Why, hark ye, you Folk, that call yourselves Ra∣tional, and talk of having Souls, is this a Token of your having such things about you, or of thinking Rationally; if you have, pray what is it likely will become of you all? Why, the Strife is gotten into
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
your Kitchens, your Parlours, your Shops, your Counting-houses, nay, into your very Beds. You Gentlefolks, if you please to listen to your Cook-maids and Footmen in your Kitchens, you shall hear them scolding, and swearing, and scratching, and fighting, among themselves; and when you think the Noise is about the Beef and the Pudding, the Dish water, or the Kitchen-stuff, alas you are mistaken, the Feud is about the more mighty Affairs of the Government, and who is for the Protestant Succession, and who for the Pretender. Here the poor despicable Scullions learn to cry, <HI>High-Church, No Dutch Kings, No Hannover,</HI> that they may do it dexterously when they come into the next Mob. Here their An∣tagonists of the Dripping-pan practise the other Side Clamour, <HI>No French Peace, No Pretender, No Popery.</HI> The thing is the very same up one Pair of Stairs, in the Shops and Warehouses the Prentices stand some on one Side of the Shop, and some on the other, (having Trade little enough,) and there they throw <HI>High-Church</HI> and <HI>Low-Church</HI> at one another's Heads like Battledore and Shuttlecock; instead of Posting their Books, they are Fighting and Railing at the <HI>Pretender</HI> and the House of <HI>Hannover;</HI> it were better for us certainly that these Things had never been heard of. If we go
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
from the Shop one Story higher into our Family, the Ladies instead of their inno∣cent Sports and Diversions, they are all falling out one among another; the Daugh∣ters and the Mother, the Mothers and the Daughters; the Children and the Servants; nay, the very little Sisters one among another. If the Chamber-maid is a Slattern, and does not please, hang her, she is a Jade; or I war∣rant she is a High-Flier; or, <HI>on t'other Side,</HI> I warrant she is a Whig; I never knew one of that sort good for any thing in my Life. Nay, go up to your very Bed-Chambers, and even in Bed, the Man and Wife shall quarrel about it. People! Peo∣ple! What will become of you at this rate? If ye cannot set Man and Wife together, nor your Sons and Daughters together, nay, nor your Servants together, how will ye set your Horses together, think ye? And how shall they stand together Twenty or Thirty Years, think ye, if the Queen should live so long? Before that time comes if you are not reduc'd to your Wits, you will be stark Mad; so that unless you can find in your Hearts to agree about this Matter beforehand, the Condition you are in, and by that time will in all likelihood be in, will Ruin us all; and this is one sufficient Reason why we should say No∣thing, and do Nothing, about the Succes∣sion,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
but just let it rest where it is, and en∣deavour to be quiet; for it is impossible to live thus: Further, if <HI>Hannover</HI> should come while we are in such a Condition, we shall Ruin him, or he us, that is most certain. It re∣mains to enquire what will be the Issue of Things. Why, (1.) If ye will preserve the Succession, and keep it right, you must settle the Peace of the Nation; we are not in a Condition to stand by the Succession now, and if we go on we shall be worse able to do so; in his own Strength <HI>Hannover</HI> does not pretend to come, and if he did he must miscarry; if not in his own, in whose then but the People of <HI>Britain?</HI> And if the Peo∣ple be a weaken'd, divided and deluded, People, and see not your own Safety to lye in your Agreement among yourselves, how shall such weak Folk assist him, especially against a strong Enemy; so that it will be your Destruction to attempt to bring in the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> unless you can stand by and defend him when he is come; this will make you all like <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Men in the <HI>West,</HI> and you will find yourselves lifted up to Halters and Gibbets, not to Places and Preferments. Unless you reconcile your∣selves to one another, and bring things to some better Pass among the Common Peo∣ple, itwill be but to banter yourselves to talk of the Protestant Succession; for you
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
neither will be in a Condition to bring over your Protestant Successor, or to sup∣port him on the Throne when you have brought him; and it will not be denied, but to make the Attempt, and not succeed in it, is to ruin yourselves; and this I think a very good Reason against the Suc∣cession of the House of <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>Another Argument relates something to the Family of <HI>Hanover</HI> itself. Here the Folk are continually fighting and quarrel∣ling with one another to such a Degree as must infallibly weaken and disable the whole Body of the Nation, and expose them to any Enemy, Foreign or Domestick. What Prince, think you, will venture his Person with a Party or a Faction, and that a Party crush'd, and under the Power of their Enemy; a Party who have not been able to support themselves or their Cause, how shall they support and defend him when he comes? And if they cannot be in a Posture to Defend and Maintain him when they have him, how shall he be en∣couraged to venture himself among them? To come over and make the Attempt here according to his just Claim and the Laws of the Land would be indeed his Advantage, if there was a Probability that he should succeed, otherwise the Example of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> is sufficient to warn him against
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
venturing while the Nation is divided, and together by the Ears, as they are here. The whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> we see, could not defend King <HI>Augustus</HI> against the <HI>Swedes</HI> and their Pretender; but tho' he had the Majority, and was receiv'd as King over the whole Kingdom, yet it b ing a King∣dom divided into Factions and Parties, and those Parties raging with bitter Envy and Fury one against another, even just as ours do here, what came of it but the Ruin of King <HI>Augustus,</HI> who was as it were a Priso∣ner in his own Court, and was brought to the Necessity of Abdicating the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> and of acknowledging the Title of the Pretender to that Crown. Now what can the Elector of <HI>Hannover</HI> expect if he should make the Attempt here while we are in this divided factious Condition, while the Pretender, back'd by his Party at Home, shall also have the whole Power of <HI>France</HI> to support him, and place him upon the Throne?</P>
<P>Let us but look back to a Time when the very same Case almost fell out in this Na∣tion; the same many Ways it was, that is, in the Case of the Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. your Bloody Papist Persecuting Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and the Lady <HI>Jane Dudley,</HI> or <HI>Gray.</HI> The late King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. had settled the Protestant Suc∣cession upon the Lady <HI>Jane;</HI> it was receiv'd
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
universally as the Protestant Succession is now. The Reasons which moved the Peo∣ple to receive it were the same, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Safety of the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties and Properties of the People, all the Great Men of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Court and Council came readily into this Succession, and gave their Oaths, or what was in those Days (whatsoever it may be now) thought equal to an Oath, <HI>(viz.</HI> their Honour,) for the standing by the Successor in her taking Possession of her said just Right. <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> was the Pretender; her Mother was Abdicated, (so we call it in this Age,) Repudiated, they call'd it, or Divorc'd. Her Daughter was adjudg'd Illegitimate or Spurious, because the Marriage of her Mother was esteemed Unlawful; just as our Preteuder is by this Nation suggested Spurious, by Reason of the yet unfolded Mysteries of his Birth. Again, that Pretender had the whole Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was then the most dreaded of any in the World, and was just what the <HI>French</HI> are now, <HI>viz.</HI> the Terror of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> If Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was to have the Crown, it was allowed by all that <HI>England</HI> was to be governed by <HI>Spanish</HI> Councils and <HI>Spanish</HI> Maxims, <HI>Spanish</HI> Money and <HI>Spanish</HI> Cruelty. Just as we say now of the Pre∣tender, that if he was to come in we shall
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
be all govern'd by <HI>French</HI> Maxims, <HI>French</HI> Councils, <HI>French</HI> Money, and <HI>French</HI> Ty∣ranny. In these Things the Pretender <HI>(Mary)</HI> at that Time was the Parallel to our Pretender Now, and that with but very little Difference. Besides all this she was a Papist, which was directly contrary to the Pious Design of King <HI>Edward</HI> in pro∣pagating the Reformation. Exactly agree∣ing these Things were with our Succession, our Pretender, our King <HI>William,</HI> and his Design, by settling the Succession for the propagating the Revolution, which is the Reformation of this Day, as the Reforma∣tion was the Revolution of that Day. Af∣ter this formal settling of the Succession the King (as Kings and Queens must) dies, and the Lords of the Council, suppose Lords Justices, as our Law calls them, <HI>they were the same Thing,</HI> they Meet and Proclaim their Protestant Successor, as they were oblig'd to do; and what follow'd? Had they been unanimous, had they stuck to one another, had they not divided into Parties, High and Low, they had kept their Pro∣testant Successor in spight of all the Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> but they fell out with one ano∣ther; High Protestants against Low Prote∣stants; and what was the Consequence? One Side to ruin the other brought in the Pretender upon them, and so <HI>Spanish</HI> Power,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
as it was predicted, came in upon them, and devoured them all. Popery came in, as they fear'd, and all went to Ruin; and what came of the Protestant Successor; Truly they brought Her to Ruin. For first bringing her in, and then, by Reason of their own Strife and Divisions, not be∣ing able to maintain Her in the Possession of that Crown, which at their Request She had taken, She fell into Her Enemies Hand, was made a Sacrifice to their Fury, and brought to the Block. What can be a more lively Representation of our Case now be∣fore us? He must have small Sense of the State of our Case, I think, who in our pre∣sent Circumstances can desire the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succession should take Place. What! Would you bring over the Family of <HI>Hannover</HI> to have them Murther'd? No, no, those that have a true Value for the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> would by no Means desire them to come hi∣ther, or desire you to bring them on such Terms; first let the World see you are in a Condition to Support and Defend them, that the Pretender, and his Power and Alliances of any kind, shall not Disperse and Ruin him and you together; first unite and put yourselves into a Posture that you may defend the Succession, and then you may have it; but as it stands now, good Folks, consider with yourselves what Pince in
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<HI>Europe</HI> will venture among Us, and who that has any Respect or Value for the House of <HI>Hannover</HI> can desire them to come hither.</P>
<P>These are some good Reasons why the Succession of the House of <HI>Hannover</HI> should not be our present View. Another Reason may be taken from the Example of the good People in the Days of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. they were very Good Religious People, (that must be allow'd by all Sides,) and who had very great Zeal for the Protestant Re∣ligion and the Reformation, as it was then newly establish'd among them; and this Zeal of theirs appear'd plainly in a Degree we can scarce hope for among the Prote∣stants of this Age, <HI>viz.</HI> in their Burning for it afterwards; yet such was their Zeal for the Hereditary Right of their Royal Family, that they chose to fall into the Hands of <HI>Spanish</HI> Tyranny, and of <HI>Spanish</HI> Popery, and let the Protestant Religion and the Hopes of its Establishment go to the D—l, rather than not have the Right Line of their Princes kept up, and the Eldest Daughter of their late King <HI>Henry</HI> come to the Crown. Upon this Principle they forsook their good Reforming King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>'s Scheme, rejected the Protestant Succession, and they themselves, Protestants, sincere Protestants, such as afterwards died
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
at a Stake for their Religion, the Protestant Religion; yet they brought in the Preten∣der according to their Principles, and run the Risque of what could follow thereupon. Why should we think it strange then that Protestants now in this Age, and Church of <HI>England</HI> Protestants too, should be for a Papish Pretender? No doubt but they may be as good Protestants as the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Men in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time were, and if they are brought to it, will go as far, and die at a Stake for the Protestant Religion, and in doing this, no doubt, but it is their real Prospect to die at a Stake, <HI>or they would not do it to be sure.</HI> Now the Protestant Reli∣gion, the whole Work of Reformation, the Safety of the Nation, both as to their Li∣berties and Religion, the keeping out <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spanish</HI> Popery, the dying at a Stake, and the like, being always esteem'd Things of much less Value than the faith∣ful adhering to the Divine Rule of keeping the Crown in the Right Line. Let any trne Protestant tell me, how can we pre∣tend to be for the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succession? It is evident that the Divine Hereditary Right of our Crown is the Main Great Article now in Debate. You call such a Man the Pretender, but is he not the Son of our King? And if so, what is the Protestant Re∣ligion to us? Had we not much better be
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Papists than Traytors? Had we not much better deny our God, our Baptism, our Re∣ligion and our Lives, than deny our lawful Prince, our next Male in a Right Line? If Popery comes, Passive Obedience is still our Friend; we are Protestants; we can Die, we can Burn, we can do any Thing but Rebel; and this being our first Duty, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Recognize our Rightful Sovereign, are we not to do that first? And if Popery or Slavery follow we must act as becomes us. This being then Orthodox Doctrine, is equally a Substantial Reason why we should be against the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succession.</P>
<P>There may be sundry other Reasons given why we should not be for this New Establishment of the Succession, which tho' perhaps they may not seem so Cogent in themselves, have yet a due Force, as they stand related to other Circumstances, which this Nation is at present involved in, and therefore are only left to the Consideration of the People of these Times. No Que∣stion but every Honest <HI>Britain</HI> is for a peaceable Succession: Now if the Preten∣der comes, and is quickly establish'd on the Throne, why then you know there is an End of all our Fears of the Great and Formidable Power of <HI>France;</HI> we have no more need to fear an Invasion, or the Effects of leaving <HI>France</HI> in a Condition by the
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Peace to act against Us, and not the Pre∣tender upon us; and therefore Peace being of so much Consequence to this Nation, af∣ter so long and so cruel a War, none can think of entering upon a New War for the Succession without great Regreat and Horror. Now it cannot be doubted but the Succes∣sion of <HI>Hannover</HI> would necessarily involve us again in a War against <HI>France,</HI> and that perhaps when we may be in no good Case to undertake it for these Reasons. (1.) Perhaps some Princes and States in the World by that Time, seeing the great Encrease and Growth of <HI>French</HI> Power, may think fit to change their Sentiments, and rather come over to that Interest for want of being supported before, than be willing to Embark against <HI>France,</HI> and so it may not be possible to obtain a New Confederacy in the Degree and Extent of it, which we have seen it in, or in any Degree suitable to the Power of <HI>France;</HI> and if so, there may be but small Hopes of Success in Case of a new Rupture; and any War had better be let alone than be carried on to Loss, which often ends in the Overthrow of the Party or Nation who undertake it, and fails in the carrying it on. (2.) <HI>France</HI> itself, as well by the Acquisition of those Princes who may have chang'd Sides, as above, as by a Time for taking Breath after
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
the Losses they have receiv'd, may be rais'd to a Condition of Superiour Strength, and may be too much an Over-match for us to venture upon; and if he thinks fit to send us the Person we call the Pretender, and order us to take him for our King, and this when we are in no Condition to withstand him, Prudence will guide as to accept of him; for all People comply with what they cannot avoid; and if we are not in a Con∣dition to keep him out, there wants very little Consultation upon the Question, whe∣ther we shall take him in? Or no? Like this is a Man, who being condemn'd to be Hang'd, and is in Irons in the Dungeon at <HI>Newgate,</HI> when he sees all Possibility ei∣ther of Pardon from the Queen, or Escape out of Prison, what does he resolve upon next? What! Why he resolves to die. What should he resolve on? Every Body submits to what they cannot escape. Peo∣ple! People! If ye cannot resist the <HI>French</HI> King, ye must submit to a <HI>French</HI> Preten∣der. There is no more to be said about that. (3.) Then some Allies, who it might be thought would be able to lend you some Help in such a Case as this is, may pretend to be disgusted at former Usage, and say they were abandoned and forsaken in their Occasion by us, and they will not hazard for a Nation who disoblig'd them
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
so much before, and from whom they have not receiv'd suitable Returns for the Debt of the Revolution. And if these Nations should take Things so ill, as to refuse their Aid and Assistance in a Case of so much Necessity as that of the Succession, how shall we be able to maintain that Attempt? And (as before) an Attempt of that, or any other Kind like that, is better unmade than Ineffectually made. (4.) Others add a yet farther Reason of our probable Inability in such a Case, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Enemies of <HI>Britain</HI> have so misrepresented Things to some of the Neighbouring Nations, our good Friends and Allies, as if we <HI>Britains</HI> had betray'd the Protestant Interest, and not acted faithfully to our Confederacies and Alliances, in which our Reputation, it is pretended, has suffer'd so much, as not to merit to be trusted again in like Cases, or that it should be safe to depend upon our most Solemn Engagement. This, tho' it is Invidious and Harsh, yet if there may be any Truth in it, as we hope there is not, may be added as a very good Reason why, after this War is over, we may be in no good Case at all to Undertake or to Carry on a New War in Defence of the New Pro∣testant Succession, when it may come to be necessary so to do. Since then the Succes∣sion of <HI>Hannover</HI> will necessarily involve us
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
in a New War against <HI>France,</HI> and for the Reasons above, if they are allowed to be good Reasons, we may not be in a Con∣dition to carry on that War: Is not this a good Reason why we should not in our present Circumstances be for that Succession? <HI>Other</HI> Reasons may be taken from the present Occasion the Nation may lye under of preserving and securing the best Administration of Things that ever this Nation was under in many Ages; and if this be found to be inconsistent with the Succession of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as some feign, it is ho∣ped none will say but we ought to consider what we do: If the Succession of <HI>Hanover</HI> is not consistent with these Things, what Rea∣son have we to be for the said Succession, till that Posture of Things be arrived when that Inconsistency may be removed? And now, People of <HI>Britain!</HI> Be your own Judges upon what Terms you can think it Reasonable to insist any longer upon this Succession. I do not contend that it is not a Lawful Succession, a Reasonable Succession, an Established Succession, nay, a Sworn Succession; but if it be not a Pra∣cticable Succession, and cannot be a Peace∣able Succession; if Peace will not bring him in, and War cannot, what must we do? It were much better not to have
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
it at all, than to have it and ruin the Kingdom, and ruin those that claim it at the same Time.</P>
<P>But yet I have other Reasons than these, and more Cogent ones; Learned Men say, some Diseases in Nature are Cured by Antipathies, and some by Sympathies; that the Enemies of Nature are the best Preservatives of Nature; that Bodies are brought down by the Skill of the Physi∣cian that they may the better be brought up, made Sick to be made Well, and carried to the Brink of the Grave in order to be kept from the Grave; for these Reasons, and in order to these Things, Poisons are admini∣stred for Physick; or Amputations in Surgery, the Flesh is cut that it may heal; an Arm laid open that it may close with Safety; and these Methods of Cure are said to be the most certain as well as most necessary in those particular Cases, from whence it is become a Pro∣verbial Saying in Physick, <HI>Desperate Diseases must have Desperate Remedies.</HI> Now it is very proper to enquire in this Case whe∣ther the Nation is not in such a State of Health at this Time, that the Com∣ing of the Pretender may not be of absolute Necessity, by Way of Cure of such National Distempers which now
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
afflict us, and that an Effectual Cure can be wrought no other Way? If upon due Enquiry it should appear that we are not fit to receive such a Prince as the Succes∣sor of the House of <HI>Hanover</HI> is, that we should maltreat and abuse him if he were here, and that there is no Way for us to learn the true Value of a Protestant Suc∣cessor so well as by tasting a little what a Popish Pretender is, and feeling something of the great Advantages that may accrue to us by the Superiority of a Jacobite Party, if the Disease of Stupidity has so far seiz'd us that we are to be Cured only by Poi∣sons and Fermentations; if the Wound is Mortified, and nothing but Deep Incisions, Amputations, and Desperate Remedies, must be used; if it should be necessary thus to teach us the Worth of Things by the Want of them; and there is no other Way to bring the Nation to its Senses; why, what can be then said against the Pretender? Even let him come that we may see what Slavery means, and may enquire how the Chains of <HI>French</HI> Gallies hang about us, and how easie Wooden Shoes are to walk in; for no Experience teaches so well as that we buy Dearest, and pay for with the most Smart.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
I think this may pass for a very good Reason against the Protestant Succession: Nothing is surer than that the Manage∣ment of King <HI>Cha.</HI> II. and his late Brother, were the best Ways the Nation could ever have taken to bring to pass the Hap∣py Revolution; yet these Afflictions to the Island were not Joyous, but Grievous, for the Time they remain'd, and the Poor Kingdoms suffered great Convulsions; but what weighs that if these Convulsions are found to be necessary to a Cure? If the Physicians prescribe a Vomit for the Cure of any particular Distemper, will the Pati∣ent complain of being made Sick? No, no; when you begin to be Sick, then we say, Oh, that is Right, and then the Vomit be∣gins to work; and how shall the Island of <HI>Britain</HI> spue out all the Dregs and Filth the Publick Digesture has contracted, if it be not made Sick with some <HI>French</HI> Physick? If you give good Nourishing Food upon a foul Stomach, you cause that whol∣some Food to turn into Filth, and instead of Nourishing the Man, it Nourishes Dis∣eases in the Man, till those Diseases prove his Destruction, and bring him to the Grave. In like Manner if you will bring the Pro∣testant Successor into the Government be∣fore that Government have taken some
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
Physick to cleanse it from the ill Digesture it may have been under, how do we know but the Diseases which are already begun in the Constitution may not be nourished, and kept up, till they may hereafter break out in the Days of our Posterity, and prove Mortal to the Nation. Wherefore should we desire the Protestant Successor to come in upon a Foot of High flying Menage, and be beholding for their Esta∣blishment to those who are the Enemies of the Constitution? Would not this be to have in Time to come the Successors of that House be the same Thing as the A∣ges past have already been made Sick of, and made to spue out of the Government? Are not any of these Considerations e∣nough to make any of us averse to the Protestant Succession? No, no; let us take a <HI>French</HI> Vomit first, and make us Sick, that we may be well, and may afterwards more effectually have our Health esta∣blished.</P>
<P>The Pretender will no doubt bring us good Medicines, and Cure us of all our Hypochondria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Vapours that now make us so giddy But say some, he will bring Popery in upon us; Popery, say you! Alas! It is true, Popery is a sad Thing, and that say some Folk ought to have been
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
thought on before now; but suppose then this Thing called Popery! How will it come in? Why, say the Honest Folk, the Pretender is a Papist, and if a Popish Prince come upon the Throne we shall have Po∣pery come in upon us without fail: Well, well, and what Hurt will this be to you? May not Popery be very good in its Kind? What if this kopery, like the Vomit made of Poison, be the only Physick that can cure you? If this Vomit make you spue out your Filth, your Tory Filth, your Idolatrous Filth, your Tyrannick Filth, and restore you to your Health, shall it not be good for you? Where pray observe in the Allegory of Physick; you heard before when you take a Vomit, the Physick given you to vomit is always something contrary to Nature, something that if taken in Quan∣tity would destroy; but how does it ope∣rate? It attacks Nature, and puts her upon a Ferment to cast out what offends her: But remark it, I pray, when the Patient vomits, he always vomits up the Physick and the Filth together: So, if the Nation should take a Vomit of Popery, as when the Pretender comes most certain it is that this will be the Consequence, they will vomit up the Physick and the Filth together; the Popery and the Pretender
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
will come all up again, and all the Popish, Arbitrary, Tyrannical Filth, which has of∣fended the Stomach of the Nation so long, and ruined its Digesture, it will all come up together: One Vomit of Popery will do us all a great deal of Good, for the Sto∣mach of the Constitution is Marvellous Foul. Observe, People! This is no New Applica∣tion; the Nation has taken a Vomit of this Kind before now, as in Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. Time; the Reformation was not well chewed, and being taken down whole, did not rightly digest, but left too much Crudity in the Stomach, from whence proceeded ill Nourishment, bad Blood, and a very ill Habit of Body in the Constitution; Wit∣ness the Distemper which seized the Gos∣pellers in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who being struck with an Epilepsie or Dead Palsie in the better half of their Understanding, to wit, the Religious and Zealous Part, took up Arms for a Popish Pretender, against the Prote∣stant Successor, upon the wild headed Whim∣sie of the <HI>Right Line</HI> being <HI>Jure Divino:</HI> Well, what followed, I Pray? Why, they took a Vomit of Popery; the Potion indeed was given in a double Vehicle, <HI>(viz)</HI> of Faggots a little inflamed, and this work'd so effectually, that the Nation having vo∣mited, brought up all the Filth of the Sto∣mach, and the Foolish Notion of Heredita∣ry
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Right spued out Popery also along with it. Thus was Popery and Fire and Faggot the most effectual Remedy to cure the Nation of all its simple Diseases, and to settle and establish the Protestant Refor∣mation; and why then should we be so terrified with the Apprehensions of Popery? Nay, why should we not open our Eyes and see how much to our Advantage it may be in the next Reign to have Popery brought in, and to that End the Pretender set up, that he may help us to this most useful Dose of Physick? These are some other of my Reasons against the Protestant Sue∣cession; I think they cannot be mended: It may perhaps be thought hard of that we should thus seem to make light of so ter∣rible a Thing as Popery, and should jest with the Affair of the Protestants: No, People! No; this is no Jest, taking Physick is no Jest at all; for it is useful many Ways, and there is no keeping the Body in Health without it, for the Corruption of Politick Constitutions are as Gross and as Fatal as those of Human Bodies, and require as immediate Application of Medi∣cines. And why should you People of this Country be so alarmed, and seem so a∣fraid of this Thing called Popery, when it is spoken of in Intelligible Terms, since you are not afraid alternately to put to your Hands
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
to those Things which as naturally tend in themselves to bring it upon you, as Clouds tend to Rain, or Smoke to Fire; what does all your scandalous Divisions, your unchristian Quarrellings, your heaping up Reproaches, and loading each other with Infamy, and with abominable Forgeries, what do these tend to but to Popery? If it should be asked how have these any such Reference? The Question is most Na∣tural from the Premises: If Divisions weak∣en the Nation; if Whig and Tory, even united, are, and have been, weak enough to keep out Popery; surely then Widen∣ing the unnatural Breaches, and Enflaming Things between them to implacable and irreconcilable Breaches, must tend to over∣throw the Protestant Kingdom, which, as our Everblessed Saviour said, when <HI>divided against itself cannot stand.</HI> Besides, are not your Breaches come up to that Height already as to let any Impartial By-stander see that Popery must be the Consequences? Do not one Party say openly they had rather be Papists than Presbyterians, that they would rather go to Mass than to a Meeting∣house, and are they not to that Purpose, all of them who are of that Height, openly joined with the Jacobites in the Cause of Pope∣ry? On the other Hand, are not the Pres∣byterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> so exasperated at ha∣ving
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
the Abjuration Oath impos'd upon them, contrary, as they tell us, to their Principles, that they care not if he, or any else, would come now, and free them from that Yoke? What is all this but telling us plainly that the whole Nation is running into Popery and the Pretender? Why then, while you are Obliquely, and by Conse∣quences, joining your Hands to bring in Popery, why, O distracted Folk! should you think it amiss to have me talk of doing it Openly and Avowedly? Better is open Enmity than secret Guile; better is it to talk openly, and profess openly, for Popery, that you may see the Shape and real Pi∣cture of it, than pretend strong Opposition of it, and be all at the same Time putting your Hands to the Work, and pulling it down upon yourselves with all your Might.</P>
<P>But here comes an Objection in our Way, which, however weighty, we must endea∣vour to get over, and this is, What be∣comes of the Abjuration? If the Pretender comes in we are all perjured, and we ought to be all Unanimous for the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> because we are all perjured if we are for the Pretender: <HI>Perjur'd, say ye!</HI> Ha! Why, do not all these People say we are all perjur'd already? Nay, One, Two, Three, or Four Times? What signifie
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Oaths and Abjurations in a Nation where the Parliament can make an Oath to Day, and punish a Man for keeping it to Mor∣row! Besides, taking Oaths without Ex∣amination▪ and breaking them without Consideration, hath been so much a Pra∣ctice, and the Date of its Original is so far back, that none, or but very few, know where to look for it; nay, have we not been called in the Vulgar Dialect of Fo∣reign Countries the <HI>Swearing Nation?</HI> Note, we do not say the Forsworn Nation; for whatever other Countries say of us, it is not meet we should say so of ourselves: But as to Swearing and Forswearing, As∣sociating and Abjuring, there are very few without Sin to throw the first Stone, and therefore we may be the less Careful to answer in this Matter: It's evident that the Friends of the Pretender cannot blame us; for have not the most profest Jacobites all over the Nation taken this Abjuration? Nay, when even in their Hearts they have all the while resolved to be for the Pre∣tender? Not to instance in the Swearing in all Ages to and against Governments, just as they were, or were not, in Con∣dition to protect us, or keep others out of Possession: But we have a much better Way to come off this than that, and we doubt not to clear the Nation of Perjury,
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
by declaring the Design, true Intent and Meaning, of the Thing itself; for the Good or Evil of every Action is said to lye in the Intention; if then we can prove the bringing in the Pretender to be done with a Real Intention and Sincere Design to keep him out; or, as before, to spue him out; if we bring in Popery with an Intention and a Sincere Design to establish the Protestant Religion; if we bring in a Popish Prince with a single Design the firmer and better to fix and introduce the Protestant <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession; if I say these Things are the true Intent and Meaning, and are at the Bottom of all our Actions in this Matter, pray how shall we be said to be Perjured, or to break in upon the Abjuration, whose Meaning we keep whatever becomes of the Literal Part of it. Thus we are abundantly de∣fended from the Guilt of Perjury, because we preserve the Design and Intention up∣right and entire for the House of <HI>Hanover;</HI> tho' as the best Means to bring it to pass we think fit to bring in Popery and the Pretender; but yet farther, to justifie the Lawfulness and Usefulness of such Kind of Methods, we may go back to former Experiments of the same Case, or like Ca∣ses, for Nothing can illustrate such a Thing so aptly, as the Example of Eminent Men
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
who have practised the very same Things in the same or like Cases, and more espe∣cially when that Practice has been made use of by Honest Men in an Honest Cause, and the End been crowned with Success. This Eminent Example was first put in Pra∣ctice by the late Famous E. of <HI>Sunderland</HI> in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> II. and that too in the Case of bringing Popery into <HI>England,</HI> which is the very Individual Article before us: This Famous Politician, if Fame lyes not, turn'd Papist himself, went publickly to Mass, advised and directed all the for∣ward rash Steps that King <HI>James</HI> after∣wards took, towards the introducing of Po∣pery into the Nation: If he is not slander'd, it was he advised the Setting up of Popish Chapels and Mass-houses in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and in the several Principal Towns of this Nation; the Invading the Right of Corporations, Courts of Justice, Universi∣ties, and, at last, the Erecting the High Commission Court, to sap the Foundations of the Church; and many more of the Arbitrary Steps which that Monarch took for the Ruin of the Protestant Religion, as he thought, were brought about by this Politick Earl, purely with Design, and as the only effectual Means, to ruin the Popish Schemes, and bring about the Establishment of the Protestant Religion by the Revolu∣tion;
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
and, as Experience after made it good, he alone was in the Right, and it was the only Way left, the only Step that could be taken, tho' at first it made us all of the Opinion the Man was going the ready Way to ruin his Country, and that he was Selling us to Popery and <HI>Rome.</HI> This was exactly our Case; the Nation being Sick of a Deadly, and otherwise Incurable, Dis∣ease, this Wise Physician knew that no∣thing but a Medicine made up of Deadly Poison, that should put the whole Body into Convulsions, and make it cast up the Dregs of the Malady, would have any Ef∣fect; and so he applied himself accordingly to such a Cure; he brought on Popery to the very Door; he caused the Nation to swal∣low as much of it as he thought was e∣nough to make her as Sick as a Horse, and then he foresaw she would spue up the Disease and the Medicine together; the Po∣tion of Popery he saw would come up with it, and so it did: If this be our Case now, then it may be true that bringing the Preten∣der is the only Way to establish the Protestant Succession; and upon such Terms, and such only, I declare myself for the Pretender: If any Sort of People are against the Suc∣cession of the House of <HI>Hanover</HI> on any other Accounts, and for other Reasons, it may not be amiss to know some of them,
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
and a little to recommend them to those who have a Mind to be for him, but well know not wherefore or why they are so inclined. 1. Some being instructed to have an Aversion to all Foreign Princes or Fa∣milies, are against the Succession of the Prin∣ces of <HI>Hanover,</HI> because, as they are taught to say, they are <HI>Dutchmen;</HI> now tho' it might as well be said of the Pretender that he is a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> yet that having upon ma∣ny Accounts been made more familiar to them of late, and the Name of a <HI>Dutch</HI> King having a peculiar Odium left upon it, by the Grievances of the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, they can by no Means think of ano∣ther <HI>Dutch</HI> Succession without Abhorrence; nay the Aversion is so much greater than their Aversions to Popery, that they can with much more Satisfaction entertain the Notion of a Popish <HI>French</HI> Pretender than of the best Protestant in the World, if he hath any Thing belonging to him that sounds like a <HI>Dutchman:</HI> And this is some Peoples Reason against the <HI>Hanover</HI> Suc∣cession; a Reason which has produced vari∣ous Effects in the World since the Death of that Prince, even to creating National An∣tipathies in some People to the whole Peo∣ple of <HI>Holland,</HI> and to wish us involved in a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> without any Foun∣dation of a Quarrel with them, or any
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Reason for those Aversions; but these Things opening a Scene which relates to Things far∣ther back than the Subject we are now upon, we omit them here for Brevity Sake, and to keep more closely to the Thing in Hand at this Time. Others have Aversions to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession as it is the Ef∣fect of the Revolution, and as it may rea∣sonably be supposed to favour such Prin∣ciples as the Revolution was brought about by, and has been the Support of, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Principles of Liberty, Justice, Rights of Parliaments, the Beop'es Liberties, Free Possession of Property, and such like; these Doctrines a certain Party in this Nation have always to their utmost opposed, and have given us Reason to believe they hate and abhor them, and for this Reason they cannot be supposed to appear forward for the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession; to these Principles have been opposed the more Famous Do∣ctrines of Passive Obedience, Absolute Will, Indefeasible Right, the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of the Line of Princes, Hereditary Right, and such like; these, as preach'd up by that <HI>Eminent Divine,</HI> Dr. <HI>Henry Sacheverell,</HI> are so much preferrable to the Pretences of Liberty and Constitution, the Old Repub∣lican Notions of the Whigs, that they cannot but fill these People with Hatred against all those that would pretend to main∣tain
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
the Foundation we now stand upon, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Revolution; and this is their Reason against the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, which they know would endeavour to do so.</P>
<P>Come we in the Conclusion of this great Matter to one Great and Main Reason which they say prevails with a great Part of the Nation at this Time to be for the Pretender, and which many Subtle Heads and Industrious Hands are now busily em∣ployed all over the Kingdom to improve in the Minds of the Common People, this is the Opinion of the Legitimacy of the Birth of the Pretender; it seems, say these Men, that the Poor Commons of <HI>Britain</HI> have been all along impos'd upon to believe that the Person called the Pre∣tender was a Spurious Birth, a Child fo∣stered upon the Nation by the late King and Queen; this Delusion was carried on, say they, by the Whigs in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, and a mighty Stir was made of it to possess the Rabbles in Favour of the Revolution, but nothing was ever made of it: King <HI>William,</HI> say they, promised in his Declaration to have it referred to the De∣cision of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, but when he obtained the Crown he never did any Thing that Way more than encourage the People to spread the Delusion by Scur∣rilous
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
Pamphlets to amuse the poor Com∣mons; have them take a Thing for grant∣ed which could have no other Thing made of it; and so the judging of it in Parlia∣ment was made a Sham only; and the People drinking in the Delusion, as they who were in the plot desired, it has past ever since as if the Thing had been suffi∣ciently proved. Now upon a more se∣date Considering the Matter, say they, the Case is clear that this Person is the real Son of King <HI>James,</HI> and the Favour∣ers of the Revolution go now upon ano∣ther Foundation, <HI>(viz)</HI> the Powers of Parliaments to limit the Succession; and that Succession being limited upon King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication, which they call Volun∣tary: So that now, say they, the Question about the Legitimacy of the Person called the Pretender is over, and nothing now is to be said of it: That he is the Son of King <HI>James,</HI> there is, say they, no more Room to doubt, and therefore the Do∣ctrine of Hereditary Right taking Place, as the Ancient professed Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> there can be no Objection against his being our Lawful King; and it is contrary to the said Church of <HI>England</HI> Doctrine to deny it. This then is the present Reason which the poor ig∣norant People are taught to give why they
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
are against the Protestant Succession, and why they are easily persuaded to come in∣to the New Scheme of a Popish Preten∣der, tho' at the same Time they are all heartily against Popery as much as ever.</P>
<P>It becomes necessary now to explain this Case a little to the Understanding of the Common People, and let them know upon what Foundation the Right of these Two Parties is founded, and if this be done with Plainness and Clearness, as by the Rights and Laws of <HI>Englishmen</HI> and <HI>Britains</HI> appertaineth, the said Commons of <HI>Britain</HI> may soon discover whether the Succession of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> or the Claim of the Person called the Preten∣der, is founded best, and which they ought to adhere unto. The First Thing it seems to be made clear to the Com∣mon People is, Whether the Pretender was the Lawful Son of King <HI>James,</HI> Yea, or No? And why the contrary to this was not made appear, according to the Promi∣ses which, they say, tho' falsly, were made by the late King <HI>William?</HI> In the first Place is to be considered, that the Declaration of the said King, when P. of <HI>O</HI> putting the said Case in the modestest Manner possible, had this Expression, <HI>That there were violent Suspicions that the said Person was not Born of the Queen's Body, and that the Prince re∣solved</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
to leave the same to the Free Parliament, to which throughout the said Declaration the said Prince declared Himself ready to refer all the Grievances which he came over to redress. <HI>I shall give you this in the Words of a late Learned Author upon that Head.</HI></P>
<P>That before a Free Parliament could be obtained, King <HI>James</HI> withdrew himself, and carried away his Pretended Son into the Hands of the Ancient Enemies of this Nation, and of our Religion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> there to be Educated in the Principles of Enmity to this his Native Countrey.</P>
<P>By which Action he not only declined to refer the Legitimacy of his said Son to the Examination of the Parliament, as the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had offered in his said Declaration, but made such Examination altogether Ʋseless and Impracticable, he himself (King <HI>James)</HI> not owning it to be a Legal Parliament, and therefore not consenting to stand by such Ex∣amination.</P>
<P>By the said Abdication, and carrying away his said pretended Son into the Hands of the <HI>French</HI> to be Educated in Popery, &amp;c. he gave the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> abundant Reason for ever to exclude the said King <HI>James</HI> and his said Pretend∣ed Son from the Government of these Realms, or from the Succession to the same, and made
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
it absolutely Necessary for them to do so, if they would secure the Protestant Religion to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and their Posterity; and this with∣out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Regard to the Doubt, whether he was the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awful Son of King <HI>James,</HI> or no, since it is inconsistent with the Constitution of this Protestant Nation to be Governed by a Popish Prince.</P>
<P>The Proof of the Legitimacy being thus stated, and all the violent Suspici∣ons of his not being Born of the Queen being thus confirmed by the Abdication of King <HI>James,</HI> come we next to examine how far this Abdication could forfeit for this Pretender, supposing him to be the real Son of King <HI>James,</HI> this returns upon the Right of the Parliament to limit the Suc∣cession, supposing King <HI>James</HI> had had no Son at all; if the Abdication be granted a lawfully making the Throne vacant, it will be very hard to assign a Cause why the Parliament might not name a Successor while the Father was alive, whose Right had no violent Suspicions attending it, and not why they might not name a Successor tho' the Son was living: That the Father's Abdication forfeited for the Son is no Part of the Question before us; for the Father is not said to forfeit his
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
Right at all; no one ever questioned his Right to Reign, nor, had he thought fit to have staid, could the Parliament have named a Successor, unless, as in the Case of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, he had made a Voluntary Resignation or Renunciation of the Crown, and of his Peoples Allegiance; but the King having voluntarily abdicated the Throne, this was as Effectual a Re∣leasing his Subjects from their Allegiance to him, as if he had read an Instrument of Resignation, just as King <HI>Richard</HI> did; all the Articles of such a Resignation were naturally contained in the said Abdi∣cation, except the naming the Successor, as effectually as if they had been at large repeated; and since the Resigning the Crown has been formerly practiced in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and there is so eminent an Exam∣ple in our <HI>English</HI> History of the same, it will questionless be of Use to the Reader of these Sheets to have the Particulars of it before his Eyes, which for that Purpose is here set down at large, as it was done in the Presence of a great Number of <HI>English</HI> Peers, who attended the King for that Pur∣pose, and is as follows.</P>
<P>IN the Name of God, <HI>Amen.</HI> I <HI>Richard,</HI> by the Grace of God, King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Ireland,</HI> do hereby
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
acquit and discharge all Archbishops, Bishops, Dukes, Marquisses, and Earls, Barons, Lords, and all other my Subjects, both Spiritual and Secular, of what Degree soever, from their Oath of Fealty and Homage, and all other Bonds of Allegiance, to me due from them and their Heirs, and do hereby release them from the said Oath and Allegiance, so far as they concern my Person, for ever.</P>
<P>I also resign all my Kingly Majesty and Dignity, with all the Rights and Privileges thereunto belonging, and do renounce all the Title and Claim which I ever had, or have, to them. I also renounce the Government of the said Kingdom, and the Name and Royal Highness thereunto belonging, freely and wholly, and swearing upon the Evangelists that I will never oppose this my Voluntary Resigna∣tion, nor suffer it to be opposed, as judging myself not unworthily deposed from my Regal Dignity for my Deserts.</P>
<P>This Resignation being read again in Parliament, they grounded the Deposing King <HI>Richard</HI> upon it, and declared him accordingly Deposed, that is, declared the Throne Vacant; and immediately, by Ver∣tue of their own undoubted Right of Li∣miting the Succession, named the Successor. See the Form in the History of that Time thus.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41"/>
That the Throne was vacant by the Volun∣tary Cession and Just Deposition of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, and that therefore according to their undoubted Power and Right so to do, they ought forthwith to the Naming a Successor to fill the said Throne, which they forthwith did, by Na∣ming and Proclaiming <HI>Henry,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> to be King, &amp;c.</P>
<P>See the History of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> Vol. Fol. 287.</P>
<P>This was the same Thing with King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication, and King <HI>James</HI>'s Ab∣dication was no less or more than an Effe∣ctual Resignation in Form; now the Par∣liament, upon the Resignation of the Crown by the King, having a manifold and mani∣fest Right to supply the Throne so become vacant, had no Obligation to regard the Posterity of the Abdicated Prince, so far as any of them are concerned in or in∣volved by, the said Abdication, and there∣fore considered of Establishing and Limit∣ing the Succession, without mentioning the Reasons of the Descent, having the Reason in themselves: But suppose the Son of King <HI>James</HI> had been allowed Le∣gitimate, yet as the Father had involved him in the same Circumstances with him∣self, by first carrying him out of the King∣dom,
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
and afterwards educating him in the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion, he became abdicated also with his Father: Neither doth the being Voluntary or not Voluntary alter the Case in the least, since in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> a Father is allowed to be able to for∣feit for himself and for his Children, and much more may he make a Resignation for himself and his Children, as is daily practiced and allowed in Law in the Cut∣ting off Intails and Remainders, even when the Heir Intail is in Being, and under Age. The People of <HI>Britain</HI> ought not then to suffer themselves to be impos'd upon in such a Case; for tho' the Pre∣tender were to be own'd for the Lawful Son of King <HI>James,</HI> yet the Abdication of King <HI>James,</HI> his Father, and especially his own Passive Abdication, was as Ef∣fectual an Abdication in him as if he had been of Age, and done it Voluntarily himself, and shall be allowed to be as binding in all respects in Law as an Heir in Possession Cutting of an Heir Intail. If this is not so, then was the Settlement of the Crown upon King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> Unrighteous, and those Two Famous Princes must be recorded in Hi∣story for Parricides and Usurpers; nor will it end there, for the Black Charge must
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
reach our most Gracious Sovereign, who must be charg'd with the Horrible Crimes of Robbery and Usurpation; and not the Parliament or Convention of the E∣states at the Revolution only shall be charg∣ed as Rebels and Traytors to their Sove∣reign, and Breakers of the great Command, of rendring to <HI>Caesar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Caesar</HI>'s, but even every Parliament since, especially those who have had any Hand in placing the Intail of the Crown upon the Person of the Queen, and in confirm∣ing her Majesty's Possession thereof since her Happy Accession; and every Act of Parliament settling the Succession on the House of <HI>Hanover</HI> must have likewise been Guilty of Treason and Rebellion in a most unnatural Manner. This is a Heavy Charge upon her Majesty, and very In∣consistent with the great Zeal and Affecti∣on with which all the People of <HI>Britain</HI> at this Time pay their Duty and Allegi∣ance to her Majesty's Person, and ac∣knowledge her Happy Government: This may indeed be thought hard, but it is evi∣dent nothing less can be the Case, and therefore those People who are so forward to plead the Pretender's Cause, on Account of his being King <HI>James</HI>'s Lawful Son, can do it upon no other Terms than these,
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
<HI>(viz.)</HI> To declare that the Queen is herself an Illegal Governour, an Usurper of ano∣ther's Right, and therefore ought to be De∣posed: Or, that the Hereditary Right of Princes is no Indefeasible Thing, but is subjected to the Power of the Limitations by Parliament. Thus I think the great Difficulty of the Pretender's being the Right∣ful Son of the late King <HI>James</HI> is over, and at an End; that it is no Part of the needful Enquiry relating to the Successi∣on, since his Father involved him in the Fate of his Abdication, and many Ways rendered him incapable to Reign, and out of Condition to have any Claim; since the Power of limiting the Succession to the Crown is an Undoubted Right of the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> and of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> respectively. Moreover, his being E∣ducated a Papist in <HI>France,</HI> and continu∣ing so, was a Just Reason why the People of <HI>England</HI> rejected him, and why they ought to reject him, since according to that Famous Vote of the Commons in the Convention Parliament, so often Printed, and so often on many Accounts Quoted, it is declared, <HI>That it is Inconsistent with the Constitution of this Protestant Kingdom to be Govern'd by a Popish Prince.</HI> Vid. <HI>Votes of the Convention, Feb.</HI> 2. 1688. This Vote
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
was carried up by Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> to the House of Lords the same Day, as the Resolution of all the Commons of <HI>England.</HI> Now this Prince being Popish, not only so in his Infancy, but continuing so even now, when all the Acts of Parliament in <HI>Britain</HI> have been made to exclude him his Turning Protestant now, which his Emissaries pro∣mise for him, tho' perhaps without his Consent will not answer at all; for the Acts of Parliament, or some of them, ha∣ving been past while he, tho' of Age, re∣mained a Papist, and gave no Room to expect any other, his Turning Protestant cannot alter those Laws, suppose he should do so; nor is it reasonable that a Nation should alter an Established Succession to their Crown whenever he shall think fit to alter or change his Religion: If to en∣gage the People of <HI>Britain</HI> to settle the Succession upon him, and receive him as Heir, he had thought fit to turn Prote∣stant, why did he not declare himself ready to do so before the said Succession was settled by so many Laws, especially by that Irrevocable Law of the Union of the Two Kingdoms, and that Engage∣ment of the Abjuration, of which no Human Power can absolve us, no Act of Parliament can repeal it, nor no Man break it without Wilful Perjury.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46"/>
What then is the Signification to the People of <HI>Britain</HI> whether the Person cal∣led the Pretender be Legitimate, or no? The Son of King <HI>James,</HI> or the Son of a Cinder-woman? The Case is settled by the Queen, by the Legislative Authority, and we cannot go back from it; and those who go about as Emissaries to persuade the Commons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> of the Pre∣tender's having a Right, go about at the same Time trayterously to tell the Queen's good Subjects that her Majesty is not our Rightful Queen, but an Usurper.</P>
