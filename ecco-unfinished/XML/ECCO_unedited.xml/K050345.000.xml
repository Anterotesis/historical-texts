Whether a
LAW

DISSENTERS,
Would not be Inconsistent with the

And a Breach of the QUEEN'S PROMISE.</P>

<HEAD>A
SERIOUS INQUIRY
INTO THE
Unreasonableness of a LAW
AGAINST
Occasional Conformity, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THese Sheets having been wrote during the late
Agitation between the two Houses, relating to
a Law against Occasional Conformity; upon
the demise of that Law, had been buried in
the Grave with it, had not the restless endeavours, both
of the Press and the Pulpit been set on foot to revive it.</P>
<P>The end of this Paper is not so much in hopes to re∣claim
a Party, whose Malice is a constant Spurr to their
Heads, against Dissenters; as to let the Ignorant, and
Well-meaning among them, if any such are to be found,
see a little what they are a doing.</P>
<P>As for the Dissenters, tho' perhaps they have not
Power to prevent the Mischief, 'tis convenient to let the
World know, upon what Foot their Enemies Act; and
that tho' they may have the Misfortune to feel the Con∣sequences,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
they may not pass for Fools too; but as their
Enemies trample upon the Honour and Character of
their Sovereign, they may let them see they know it.</P>
<P>A Worthy Author of a Penny sheet, spread about
very industriously, and Entitled, <HI>Reasons for this Law,</HI>
would prove it ought to Pass, because of Her Majesty's
Promises of Maintaining the Church, and Encouraging
such as were most Zealous for Her Interest.</P>
<P>This I take to be a design of making Her Majesty's
Promises clash one against another, which they may
come off from, if they can.</P>
<P>It seems, That these Gentlemen mistook Her Maje∣sty's
Meaning, in the Promise she made, of <HI>Encouraging
the most Zealous Men of the Church of England;</HI> by sup∣posing
Her Majesty meant thereby▪ Such whose Zeal
run highest against the Dissenters: Whereas Her Maje∣sty,
by declaring Her self since, the great Promoter of
Peace and Union among Her Subjects; and by Repeat∣ing
to the Dissenters Her Resolution of Maintaining the
Toleration, has told them plainly what she meant.</P>
<P>It looks a little strange, That the Gentlemen, who
are so hot for this Law, should think the Dissenters so
blind, as not to see the Toleration struck at, in its most
Essential Parts; and, as if they would hoodwink them
with the Vapour of the <HI>Aenigma,</HI> all the Pamphlets and
Sermons at the same time, that they would stigmatize
Occasional Conformity, as the Badge of a Hypocrite;
joyn this shadow for a Covering, <HI>Let them enjoy
their Toleration on God's Name,</HI> and <HI>No-body meddles with
Toleration,</HI> New Association. p.—. Now if these
Gentlemen will tell us, how a Law against Occasional
Conformity can be pass'd, and yet the Toleration Main∣tain'd
entire, then I shall give up the Cause.</P>
<P>The best Argument that has been yet brought, to
prove the Reasonableness of a Law against Occasional
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Conformity, is, <HI>That the Dissenters have made use of it to
qualify themselves for Publick Employments.</HI></P>
<P>That the Dissenters think Occasional Communion
Lawful in it self, has been publickly declar'd, and
whether <HI>it be or not,</HI> does not seem any part of the
Dispute.</P>
<P>But the declar'd Design and Intention of those who
Contend for an Occasional Bill, <HI>as we call it,</HI> is more Ef∣fectually
to keep the Dissenters out of Offices, and Pub∣lick▪
Employments in the State.</P>
<P>Whether either of these be Lawful, whether a Dis∣senter
Occasionally may Conform to the Church of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
Or whether it be just, that a Dissenter, as such,
ought to be Excluded from the Publick Trust, and made
uncapable of Serving the Government, tho' they are
great Points, and well worth Consideration, are yet no
part of the Question in debate.</P>
<P>But whether it be reasonable, that the Dissenters <HI>shou'd
either way be forc'd,</HI> be Excluded from Communion with
the Church, or with their Private Congregations, under
the Penalty of avoiding all Publick Employments, being
rendred uncapable to Serve the Government, and of the
Advantage of their Fellow <HI>Englishmen,</HI> in the Service of
their Native Country; This is the Case before us.</P>
<P>If any Man is to scruple the Lawfulness of Conformi∣ty
to the Church, it is the Dissenter, and not the Church∣man;
the Conformist cannot pretend 'tis Unlawful to
Conform, he would then become a Dissenter himself.
But if the Dissenter not Agreeing in all things, can yet
Conform in some, why should he be obliged, as by
such a Law he would be, either to Conform wholly, or
not Conform at all, and this under a severe Penalty?</P>
<P>It may be answer'd, the Test was made to keep the
Whiggs out of Place, and they Defeat the end of that
Law, by taking the Sacrament; and 'tis absolutely ne∣cessary,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
not to Trust them with Employments in
the Government, and therefore this Law is absolutely
Necessary.</P>
<P>This would be the Natural way of expressing it, if
the High Churchmen would speak their Minds hearti∣ly;
and this may pass for a true Exposition of what
they have otherwise express'd, and as it may easily be
prov'd to be their end, so it may easily be prov'd.</P>
<Q><P><HI>First,</HI> That 'tis an Uunjust Design.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That 'tis an Unreasonable Method.</P></Q>
<P>I. 'Tis an Unjust Design to deprive the Dissenters of
Publick Employments, and Unqualify them for the Ser∣vice
of their Country, without any Offence Committed.
The Law Supposes every Man a good Man, till some∣thing
appears to the contrary; now Dissenting from the
Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>no Offence a∣gainst
the Law,</HI> but is, by a special Law, <HI>Permitted and
made Legal;</HI> no Man therefore can justly be made Un∣capable
of the Service of his Country, till he is found
Guilty of the Breach of some Law.</P>
<P>II. No Law can Justly be made to deprive a Man of
any Right, for an Action which is not unlawful, either
in it self or Circumstances. <HI>Laws made against Right</HI>
and <HI>Justice</HI> are Unjust Laws, Oppressions and Tyrannies
upon the People; and tho' we must submit when they
are made, because they are made by a Lawful Autho∣rity,
yet they are not the more Just in their own Na∣ture.</P>
<P>'Tis
therefore an Unjust Design to deprive us of our
Birth-right, as <HI>Englishmen,</HI> for our Disagreement in Mat∣ters
of Religion; especially while this Disagreement is
Legal, and made so by an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
But after all, if it were to be Granted, which yet no
Wise Man will Grant, that it is absolutely Necessary to
the Safety of the Government to keep the Dissenters
out of Places, a thing no Man could ever prove—yet
<HI>the Method,</HI> which is Profess'd by those Gentlemen,
who are of that Opinion, is very Unreasonable and Un∣just;
and <HI>this is the Argument I have undertaken to make
good.</HI></P>
<P>I have no Design hereby, to say any thing relating to
the Bill lately depending in the House; or to the De∣bates
between the Two Houses on that Head; nor shall I
Concern them in this Discourse any farther, than to
Quote Matter of Fact from them; which I hope may
be done without Offence.</P>
<P>But I have numberless Authors to bring upon the
Stage, to prove the thing I alledge, of which this is the
Abstract.</P>
<P>That the High Churchmen have, and for many Years
have had, a Design, if possible, to procure an Act of Par∣liament,
to prevent the Dissenters from Holding, Posses∣sing,
or Enjoying Places, Offices, or Employments in the Go∣vernment,
by obliging them to a Strict, Total, and Ab∣solute
Conformity to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' Occasional Communion is not hereby
Condemn'd or Defended; yet 'tis plain, that a Law to
Oblige the Dissenters to a Total Conformity, or else to
suffer such and such Penalties, is Unjust and Unreaso∣nable
in its own Nature.</P>
<P>1. All <HI>Force upon the Conscience is Ʋnchristian and Ʋn∣reasonable;</HI>
to Compell any one to Act against their Con∣sciences,
is Unreasonable and Unjust; because the Scri∣pture
fays 'tis most reasonable <HI>to obey God rather than
Man;</HI> I think 'tis a Matter so long ago decided, even
by the Church of <HI>England</HI> it self, <HI>That thc Laws of Man
have no Sovereignty over the Conscience,</HI> that it would be
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
a needless Vanity in me, to mention any thing of it;
and the Martyrs in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, are my Pre∣cedents
to back the Argument.</P>
<P>If then 'tis Unlawful to Compell me against my Con∣science
to Comply, 'tis Unlawful to Punish me for
not Complying; for it cannot be Lawful to Punish me,
for refusing what you have no Power to Command
me to do.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament which oblig'd the Dissenters
to qualify themselves, by taking the Sacrament, must
imply, that it was Lawful for them to take it, or else
it had been an Unlawful Act in its own Nature; for a
Law Commanding a Sin, is a Contradiction in its self,
and no Law, but a Libel: but say some, when we made
this Act, 'twas believ'd the Dissenters would not have
complied with it, and so have been kept out.</P>
<P>Very good; So that 'twas a Trick put upon them,
presuming upon their scrupulous Consciences; this may
be true, but 'twas never the honester in the Design; and
this is the occasion of the New Method now in hand,
and is a farther Proof of the Matter alledg'd, that 'tis
not Conformity, or Non-Conformity; 'tis not Constant
or Occasional Conformity is the Question, but the keep∣ing
the Dissenters out of Offices, <HI>that they may get in:</HI>
'Tis Supplanting their Neighbours, and Incapacitating
their Brethren; This is the Matter in hand.</P>
<P>Total Conformity then being a Sin, in the Opinion
of a Dissenter, to Compell him to it, is forcing him to
Sin, which is directly against the Scripture.</P>
<P>But, says the Objector, This is not Compelling them,
for they may let Places and Preferments alone, and then
they may let Conformity alone, and Welcome.</P>
<P>This is a Christianlike Argument indeed, and makes
it plain, that 'tis neither the Advantage of the Church,
which is sought, nor the Good of the Dissenter; not
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
the Advantage of the Church, by bringing over Prose∣lytes
to her Communion; nor the Good of the Dissen∣ters,
by bringing them off from their Mistakes; but 'tis
the Profits, the Honours, the Employments in the State,
which are the things;
<Q><L>And all the Strife is plainly to be seen,</L>
<L>To get some Men put out, and some put in.</L></Q>
And this is the handle to the second Head.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Yhat 'tis downright Persecution.</HI> To Punish on Ac∣count
of Conscience, is Persecution in the most Intense
degree.</P>
<P>Shall they tell us we are not Compell'd to Conform;
and that here is no force put on the Conscience, but
Punish us if we do not? Incapacitate us for the Service
of our Queen and Country; shut us out from a share in
the Favours of our Prince, and in the Rights and Pri∣vileges
of <HI>English</HI> Men? This is Punishment for Non∣conformity;
Punishment for Conscience sake, is Perscu∣tion
for Conscience sake; and it is allow'd without Con∣tradiction,
by all the Protestant Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> that
Persecution for Conscience sake, is Unchristian, and con∣sequently
Unreasonable and Unjust.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wisdom</HI> which is from <HI>on high,</HI> in some Transla∣tions
call'd the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> is described in Scripture
to be first, <HI>Pure,</HI> then <HI>Peaceable, Gentle,</HI> and <HI>easy</HI> to be
<HI>entreated;</HI> by the Spirit of God here, Commentators
agree, is meant, not the Holy Ghost, frequently in Scri∣pture,
call'd the Spirit of God, or God the Spirit; But
the Christian Temper, wrought by the Spirit of God;
and if this Temper be of the Spirit, a Temper of Cruel∣ty,
Force and Persecution, must not be of the same Spi∣rit,
and consequently Unjust and Unreasonable.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<HI>III.</HI> This is an Infraction upon the Act of Toleration, and
therefore an Ʋnreasonable Law; that Act being founded up∣on
the highest Reason in the World.</P>
<P>The Reasonableness of the Act of Toleration, is found∣ed
upon two Principal Articles.</P>
<P>1. Its being every Man's Native Right to enjoy the
Benefit and Liberty of Serving God, his Maker, in that
Way or Method, which in his Conscience he believes
to be most agreeable to his reveal'd Will, and which
he also finds to be most Beneficial to himself.</P>
<P>It has been a Controverted Point, whether it be
Lawful to Compel any Man to be a Christian, or to
serve God at all; I think 'tis needless to be concern'd
in this Dispute; for he who suffers, because he will
have no Religion at all, cannot be Persecuted for his
Religion, but his Atheism and Irreligion.</P>
<P>But that in Matters relating to the manner of Wor∣ship,
and the different ways of serving the same God;
St. <HI>Peter</HI> has left a Memorable, and most Decisive Pre∣cedent
in <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 29. when they Charg'd them, that
they should Preach no more in that Name, that was,
the Name of Christ; they so much the more Proclaim'd
the Gospel in all the Parts of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis remarkable in this Place, who it was Charged
them; 'twas the Elders, the High Priests, and the Rulers
of the</HI> Jews; <HI>the Great</HI> Sanhedrim: <HI>'Twas a Vote of their
Parliament, and their Answer was in short,</HI> “'Tis a shame
you should pretend to Countermand what God has Com∣manded;
no Human Power can pretend to be Obey'd in
such a Case: We desire you to put it to the Vote in
plain words, whet her we shall Obey God or You.”</P>
<P>On this Account the Act of Toleration is founded upon
the most Reasonable Consideration in the World; 'tis a
Concession of Natural Right; 'tis an Acknowledgement
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
that we ought to Obey the Dictates of Conscience, ra∣ther
than an Act of Parliament; 'tis a Law made, that
we may Obey God rather than Man, as it was our Na∣tive
as well as Christian Right to do before; 'tis in short
only an Act of Justice, not an Act of Grace; 'tis an Act,
by which the Church of <HI>England</HI> is clear'd from being
of a persecuting Spirit, which they were but too Guilty
of before.</P>
<P>2. The Reasonableness of this Act of Toleration
appears, as it is a Purchase of the Dissenters, and con∣sequently
their own, their due; 'tis a debt to the Ca∣pitulations,
made in the Name of the whole People of
<HI>England,</HI> with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which has been
sufficiently prov'd in another Place.</P>
<P>The Act of Toleration being then an Act of the high∣est
Justice to the Dissenters, and built on Foundations
of <HI>Reason and Right;</HI> any Subsequent Law made in Pre∣judice
of the Liberty, Granted by the Toleration, is high∣ly
Unjust and Unreasonable.</P>
<P>It remains to this Head, That a Law against Occasi∣onal
Conformity, be prov'd to be an Infraction of the
Toleration.</P>
<P>The Act of Toleration is a Liberty given by Act of
Parliament, That all such, whose Consciences will not
permit them to Conform to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
may Worship God, according to their several Judg∣ments
and Opinions, without Disturbance, and Exem∣pting
them from all Penalties and Punishments for the
same; for which we refer them to the Act it self.</P>
<P>Now as there are several kinds of Dissenters, as well
as several sorts of Conformists, some Dissent entirely
from the Church, and own neither her Doctrine nor
Worship; some can Conform to something, some to
none at all; it seems a Contradiction to Reason, and
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
reflects upon the Church-Mens Uunderstanding, as
well as Honesty, that they should make the Law to
Punish those who can Conform in part, and let those a∣lone
who will not Conform at all; this is far from a
Christian Endeavour, to bring the Dissenters home,
into the Bosom of the Church, and Unite the Flock
under one Shepherd; for it Encourages those who are
the farthest off, to continue where they are, and those
who are nearest, and in part brought in, and by Oc∣casional
Complying, are in a fair way to a total Con∣formity,
<HI>if not in themselves, in their Posterity without
fail;</HI> these are to be punish'd for what they do, and
either compelled to Conform farther than they can—Commanded
not to Conform at all, or Punish'd for
the middle way, their own Inclinations Dictate to them.</P>
<P>'Tis most Certain, the Nature of the thing, even
the meaning of the Word Toleration, <HI>viz. a Permission
for such as cannot Conform,</HI> Implies all sorts of Dissent∣ing;
and if any are to be thought Excluded in the
Meaning of the Act, it must be such as are widest in
their Scruples, and at the greatest distance from Con∣formity,
not such as Dissent but in a few small mat∣ters,
and can Conform in the main Points.</P>
<P>But this Law is prepared to Punish such as can Con∣form
in Part, and Encourage them and all others to a
farther and a total Non-Conformity; and is therefore ex∣presly
contrary to the Intent and Meaning of the
Act of Toleration, and in its self absurd and unrea∣sonable.</P>
<P>As the Act of Toleration is an Exempting the Dissen∣ters
from all Penalties and Punishments for Dissenting,
this lays a Forfeiture or Penalty on their Dissenting
again; and I know not for my Life, what to call that,
but a Repealing Part of the Toleration. I wish some
wiser Body, would find me out another Name for it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
IV. <HI>'Tis against the general Right of Christians;</HI>
for as the Sovereignty of Conscience has been suffi∣ciently
Afferted, and even the very Act of Toleration
acknowleges it to be Superior to Law, Independent of all
Human Power, and ought not to be either forc'd or
restrained, so it can no more be just, to compel me
not to Conform in part, than it can be to oblige me
to a total Conformity.</P>
<P>I call that Compelling, Forcing, and the like, which
however plausible, the pretence of leaving it in my
Choice, may be, makes a Depriving me of any thing
which I Enjoy'd before, and had a Right to Enjoy,
the penalty of my pursuing the Dictates of my Con∣science:
This is forcing me, as far as it is in the Pow∣er
of any Man to force another, for no Man can force
another any farther than by Inflicting a Punishment
for not Complying; The Law does not force a Man
not to Murther his Neighbour, only tells him he shall
be Hang'd if he does: If I am obliged totally to Con∣form,
or totally to Dissent, when my Conscience di∣rects
me to Dissent in some things, and <HI>to Conform in
all things I can,</HI> this is as much Imposing upon my
Conscience, as Compelling me to a total Conformity
would be; this is Force, and Force is Persecution, and
both are Unjust and Unreasonable.</P>
<P>V. <HI>'Tis against her Majesties Gracious Promises of
continuing the Toleration to the Dissenters.</HI> The Royal
Veracity of the Queen, more than once Repeated on
this Head, is a Satisfaction to the Dissenters, that they
shall Enjoy the full Benefit of the Act of Toleration;
her Majesty in her late Speeches to the Parliament, has
redoubl'd her Assurances on this Head, and it seems to
me, that the Safety of the Dissenters has a greater
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Dependance upon this Head, than upon the Act of
Toleration it self.</P>
<P>Acts of Parliament depend upon the Opinons of dif∣ferent
Men, whose Breath, like themselves, is Frail
and Uncertain; they are frequently chang'd, and fre∣quently
change their Opinions; one House often Re∣peals
what a former House Enacts, they very often al∣ter
and dissanull what they have Enacted themselves;
but if forty Houses attempt to alter or dissanull the
Toleration, so as to deprive the Dissenters of the Be∣nefit
of it, we are assur'd her Majesty will never pass
such a Law; for she has given us her Royal Pro∣mise,
that she will continue her Protection of the Dis∣senters
in their Enjoyment of the Toleration Esta∣blish'd.</P>
<P>Now for any People to desire to deprive the Dissent∣ers
of their Liberty of Conscience, to deprive them
of the Benefit of the Toleration, or of any part of
it, is it not to desire the Queen to break her Word?
is it not to desire Her Majesty to lessen the Liberty
given us before? and I wonder those Gentlemen who
are so Violent for such a thing, do not see, or at least
Consider what it is they are driving at.</P>
<P>Can they think that her Majesty can weaken or
limit the Toleration, and not see that 'tis an Assaul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon the Honour of her Parole; has She not told
them that they shall always find her have a Sacred
Regard to her Promises? have they not seen <HI>her Ma∣jesty
Profess a Spotless Veracity?</HI> can they find her Injur∣ing
her own Honour, or her Subjects Confidence in this
case? and why should they Imagin <HI>so Vilely</HI> of their
Sovereign? does it not seem a want of Manners, as well
as a want of their Confidence in the Queen?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
It is Objected, but this is not an Act against the
Toleration, but only Explanatory, to tell the World
what was, and was not meant by it; and it has always
been granted that the House of Commons are the
proper Expositors of Law.</P>
<P>In Doubtful Cases, 'ts true the House are the Explain∣ers
of their own Meaning, but <HI>Toleration is an Ex∣plicit
Term,</HI> wants no Explication of its Meaning, and
the Conditions of it are exactly Express'd in the Act of
Parliament, its Extent is limited to Protestant Dissen∣tors,
only to such and to all such.</P>
<P>Now the Design I am upon, is not an Exposition, but
a Limitation; and to Limit the Extent of the Tolera∣tion,
is to Repeal part of the Law; and consequently
to Intrench upon her Majesties Promise.</P>
<P>The Queen has not given her Word to the Dissen∣ters,
to preserve part of the Toleration, <HI>but the Tole∣ration,</HI>
which must be understood of the whole, or
else by the same Rule they may obtain the Repeal of
all or any the Enacting Clauses in the Bill, and yet
pretend the Promises of the Queen remain untouch'd.</P>
<P>This would be making her Majesty Equivocate
with her Subjects, which is below her Thoughts; and
as she has told us, we shall always find her a Re∣ligious
Observer of her Word; I cannot Imagin
her Majesty can ever assent to Limit the Tolerati∣on
without offering a horrid Affront to the Honour
of her Majesties Word, and making her a Deluder of
her Subjects.</P>
<P>Some People have taken upon them to State the
Matter of the Queen's Promise, and to Distinguish
Nicely between an Act of her Majesties Will, and a
Concession to an Act of Parliament; and tell us from
this Head, that her Majesty will not fail to be as
good as her Word, as far as Concerns her self, but that
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
if it be done by an Act of Parliament, that is a gene∣ral
thing, is the Act and Deed of the People of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
that 'tis their own doing, not hers; even the
Dissenters themselves do it, for they are properly said
to Act in their Representatives. Now tho' the Queen
did promise to maintain the Toleration, yet she did
not Promise to do it against the Dissenters Will, and
if they come and ask her to do it, she is by that
Request absolv'd from her Promise, and free to Grant
what they Desire.</P>
<P>This is a way, by which any Body may distinguish
themselves out of their Promises, but an Honest An∣swer
puts an End to it.</P>
<P>The Queen's Promise is not Negative, that she will
<HI>not take away</HI> the Toleration, but it is positive, that <HI>she
will preserve it,</HI> and Protect the Dissenters in the En∣joyment
of their Liberty.</P>
<P>As to <HI>the Parliament Desiring</HI> it to be taken away,
which is as if the Dissenters did it, their Represen∣tatives
being in Parliament; I Answer, this is a Sophism
in Argument; 'tis true the Dissenters are Represented
in Parliament, as <HI>English</HI> Men▪ But not as Dissenters;
and therefore the Case differs, had the Dissenters Chosen
a Representative of themselves, as Dissenters, and these
in the Name of the rest, had come and told her Ma∣jesty,
they desired the Toleration should be Repealed;
I Grant in such a Case, her Majesty was clear of her
Promise; but for a Parliament, they Represent the Dis∣senters
in their Civil, but not in their Religious Ca∣pacity;
this Promise is made to them as Dissenters;
<HI>as such,</HI> they are no where Represented, and therefore
cannot be supposed to Act in a Repeal of such a Law,
nor can the Actions of any House Disengage her Ma∣jesty
from her Promise.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
For if, a Subject may not Interpret the Queen's Pro∣mise,
yet a Subject may say, how he Understands it;
and when her Majesty Graciously says, we shall al∣ways
find her a Religious observer of her Word; If
I Understand, what we are to Believe her Majesties
Meaning to be, it is thus, that <HI>what ever her Majesty
Solemnly Promises to any of her People, they may Depend
upon it, shall be punctually Perform'd▪ and that it shall not
be in the Power of any Human Act, to make her forget,
or Disown it.</HI></P>
<P>I hope this Explication can be no Detriment to the
Honour or Veracity of the Queen; since no Body can
have the Impudence to say, she has yet done any
thing to Infringe this Sacred Assurance; nor can any
of her People, without having scandalous Thoughts
of their Sovereign, Imagin she will break her Word.</P>
<P>How then, can our Church of <HI>England</HI> Brethren,
look her Majesty in the Face, when they are every
Day exposing the Toleration, as a thing not fit to
be Continued?</P>
<P>The telling us, “That this is Complimenting the
Dissenters into our Church and Government, who are
a People that are sworn Enemies to both, to the hazard∣ing
our Eternal Safety, and giving up our Antient Faith,
Constitution and Form of Worshp:” <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Ser∣mon,
p. 59, 60. and again p. 49. “In order to break
down the Fence and Land Mark of the Church, all
its worst Enemies must be Tolerated.”</P>
<P>What is this, but branding Toleration, as scandalous
in it self, and dangerons to the Church, and conse∣quently
the Queen, with doing things which deserve
that reproachful Title.</P>
<P>When the same Author has describ'd the Dissenters,
in the best <HI>Oxford</HI> Rhetorick he could, he adds, p. 59.
<HI>Against whom every Man that wishes the Churches welfare,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
ought to Hang out the Bloody Flag and Banner of De∣fyance.</HI></P>
<P>To make a short Comment on this worthy Text.</P>
<P>Every Man, or <HI>every one,</HI> for the Queen is a Mascu∣line
in her Politick Capacity, every one that wishes the
Churches Welfare, Ought, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mark,</P>
<P>From hence I draw this Argument.</P>
<P>The Queen has not Hung out the Bloody Flag of
Defyance; what then, one of these two things follows.</P>
<P>I. Either the Queen does not do as she Ought to do;</P>
<P>II. Or the Queen does not Wish the Welfare of the
Church.</P>
<P>If any Man can make another, or more proper
Inference from the Words, he is welcome to do it;
for my Part I acknowlege I cannot.</P>
<P>If this be the Opinion, this Worthy Gentleman has
of her Majesties Conduct; If the Vice C—r of <HI>Ox∣ford</HI>
thinks to License such Language as this to be
Printed on the Queen; Never let the Pillory be E∣rected
for an Author, for Affronting her Majesty a∣gain.
If this be not the <HI>Shortest Way;</HI> If this be not
a Method by it self; If ever Queen was thus Bantred
before; Let them tell us the Time.</P>
<P>Her Majesty has Promised to Protect the Dissenters,
continue the Toleration, and bids them not be appre∣hensive
of any Danger; but here comes Mr. <HI>S—ll</HI>
with a Voucher from a whole University, and says, that if
her Majesty wishes well to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> She
must not Tolerate them, but hang out the Bloody
Flag and Banner of Defyance against them; that is, the
Queen, if She wishes well to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
must break her Promise with the Dissenters, and Con∣sent
to Demolish the Toleration-Act; Deprive them
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of their Liberty, and Proceed against them <HI>the Shortest
Way.</HI></P>
<P>In short, according to the best Judgment I can
make of this matter, This way of Treating the Dis∣senters,
is the grossest Abuse upon the Queen, as can
possibly be put upon her; and they must suppose her
Majesty to be something, that I have more Manners
than to mention, if She does not take some more than
ordinary Notice of it—.</P>
<P>I think, I may Challenge them all to shew one
Instance, when ever the Dissenters, <HI>those Spawn of
Rebels, and Vermin not fit to Live,</HI> as the Worthy
Dr. <HI>H—h</HI> calls them; when ever they offered any such
Affront to her Majesty.</P>
<P>But these Gentlemen, presuming upon her Goodness,
at the same time abuse either her Understanding, or
her Justice.</P>
<P>Either they abuse her Understanding; as if her Ma∣jesty
could not see when she was Bantred; or they Im∣pose
upon her Justice, as if her Majesty would allow
the same Insolence in a Church Clergy Man, which
in another Man shall be Punisht with the Pillory.</P>
<P>To Sum up all, It seems clear to me, that her Ma∣jesty
can pass no Law, that shall lessen the Dissenters
Liberty of Conforming, or not Conforming, as they
now Enjoy it, by Vertue of the late Act of Parliament,
without Intrenching upon her Royal Promise, more
than once made to the Dissenters, without lessening the
Opinion the World has entertained of her Royal Word,
and the Honesty of her Maintaining it.</P>
<P>And whereas Duty as well as Charity, obliges us
to believe, that her Majesty will not fail to Maintain
that Religious, Regard which she has told us she will
have to her Word, we may at the same time con∣clude,
'tis Impossible she should ever be brought to
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
Pass a Law, that in the least offers to Infringe, or
Intrench upon that Sacred Promise, she has made the
Dissenters, of Maintaining the Toleration.</P>
<P>'Tis Impossible her Majesty can Assent to any Act,
which shall lessen the Liberty given the Dissenters, by
the Act of Toleration; 'tis Impossible She can agree
to Limit the Term of that Act, for that would be to
Repeal part of the Act, and consequently break her
Promise.</P>
<P>However, since 'tis plain there is a Party in the Church,
who are so eager to pull down the Dissenters, who are
for <HI>Bloody Flags, and Banners of Defyance against them,</HI>
who have Beat <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s Ecclesiastick Drum, to Raise
the Mob against them, and who are willing to Mortgage
the Honesty of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>If I might be allow'd to give advice to the Dissenters,
it should be to throw themselves at her Majesties Royal
Feet, and Humbly ask her Protection, in Terms like these.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<OPENER>May it Please your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>YOur Most Dutiful and Obedient Subjects, the Protestant
Dissenters, who Quietly and Chearfully obey your Royal
Commands, willingly Submit to your Government, and
heartily Depend upon your Truth, fly to the Faith and Ho∣nour
of your Majesty, Graciously Express'd, and Solemnly En∣gag'd
to them in your Royal Promise, for the Continuing
to them the Toleration of their Religion, and the Liberty of
Serving God according to their Consciences, and the Divine
Command, humbly assuring themselves, that according to
the Express Resolution of your Majesty, signify'd in your
Most Gracious Speech, at the last Prorogation of the Par∣liament,
your Majesty will preserve the said Liberty entire,
and not Pass any Bill or Bills, which Retrench, Limit, or
Lessen it; they the mean while continuing in a Dutiful,
Quiet and Peaceable Behaviour to your Majesty, and your
Government.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Nor can the Dissenters be blam'd for taking her
Majesty at her Word; the Queen had certainly never
made such a promise to us, but that she Intended these
two things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Punctually to perform it</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. She Intended the Dissenters should believe, and
depend upon it.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Dissenters can never Acquit her Majesty of
this Promise; 'tis a Solemn Engagment to them, and
in Justice to their Posterity▪ they can never quit their
Claim to the Performance of it.</P>
<P>VI. I come now to Argue, that this way of limit∣ing
of Toleration, by a Law to prevent Occasional
Conformity, <HI>is against the Interest of the Church of</HI> Eng∣land.</P>
<P>'Tis
certainly the Interest of the Church, as a Church,
to bring back all her Children into her own Bosom,
that we should have all one Discipline, as well as
Doctrine; one Mode of Worship, as we have one Ob∣ject
of Worship; and therefore all Laws which tend
to drive People farther from the Communion of the
Church, are against her Interest.</P>
<P>They who are for Establishing the Church, by keep∣ing
all the Dissenters out of her Communion, are cer∣tainly
the most Impolitick People in the World; for</P>
<P>The Strength and Glory of a Church, as of a Go∣vernment,
is the Number of its Subjects, Proselytes and
Converts; and to make a Law that shall shut out of
her Protection, such as are Conforming to them, is
the most Impolitick thing in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
1. <HI>'Tis contrary to the General Practice of all Churches
in the World;</HI> All are for bringing over People to con∣form
to their Way of Worship; if they cannot conform
wholly, they are willing to have them conform as far as
they can, in hopes to bring them up to higher degrees
and at last to compleat Conformity.</P>
<P>Some Churches have used Violence, to bring People
to conform to their Way of Worship, and persecuted
them for not do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it; and where they could not force
a thorow Compliance, have accepted a Compliance for
a time, or in part; but the Church of <HI>England</HI> is the
only Church in the World that punish'd any because
they would not wholly conform, by a Forcing them
not to conform at all.</P>
<P>2. <HI>'Tis contrary to Humane Policy;</HI> for in all probability
the Posterity of those People, who now conform in
part, will be total Conformists; and to promote a strict
total Dissent, by rejecting a partial Conformity, is to
shut out the Posterity of those who are shut out now,
and consequently lessen all prospect of a General Union,
by fixing the <HI>Dissent</HI> of those who would conform, and
thereby strengthen the Party, by Encreasing their
Numbers.</P>
<P>It has been insinuated by some, that the present Lea∣ding
Party in the Church, do not desire the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
should conform, because they would strengthen the
<HI>Low-Church Party,</HI> and promote <HI>Moderation</HI> in the
Church. This is a Hellish Notion; 'tis a piece of In∣fernal
Polity; savours of the Spirit which reigns in that
dark Region, and subjects the Work of the Ministry to
a Scandal of <HI>State-Trick Priest-Craft,</HI> and all that's Vil∣lainous
and Base.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
As if any Christian Minister of the Church of <HI>England</HI>
could be so vile, to wish the <HI>Dissenters</HI> not to be United
if possible to the Church, to wish the Number of Or∣thodox
Catholick Christians not to encrease, or the
Peace and Union of these Nations in matters of Reli∣gion,
not to be brought to pass, and all upon a design
of State-policy.</P>
<P>And yet this certainly seems to be True, since these
Gentlemen push at a Law to bring them to a total
Conformity, or exclude them from any Conformity at
all.</P>
<P>For still I insist upon it, that divesting them of Pla∣ces,
unless they do totally conform, is forcing them to
a total Dissent, as far as Force is in the power of the
Parties we mean.</P>
<P>To this blessed Pass is Religion brought; <HI>when Priests
turn States-Men, 'tis always thus;</HI> the Policy of these
Gentlemen prevails over their Consciences, and they
are Now settling their Interest in the Government, at
the Expence of their Religion; in short, they are Listed
in a Religious Plot, and are a Party-making, not a
Christian-making. The Cure of Souls must give way
to the settling an Interest, and they suspend the Clergy-Men
to put on the States-Men; 'tis not the Dissenter
they would Covert, but 'tis the Whig they would Con∣vert;
If the Occasional Conformist would leave off
his Party in Politicks, they would Embrace him, they
could easily bear with his Conformity; but they cannot
bear with his being a Whig: Thus Religion is made the
Pimp of a Party; and the Sacred Institutions of Christ
Jesus, are Prostituted to serve for Marks of Distinction,
between Factions in the State.</P>
<P>If this be not the Case, 'tis Impossible for any Man
to assign me a Reason, why the Church of <HI>England</HI>
should not desire to bring all the Dissenters in to her Com∣munion,
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
and, as far as in her lies, to Encourage them to
come in.</P>
<P>It can never be Answer'd, why they should not ac∣cept
of some as well as of all and Encourage Confor∣mity
in all the Particulars; since they who can Con∣form
in part, may in time be brought to Conform in
the whole.</P>
<P>He that desires a Reformation, desires all the degrees
of Reformation; and it cannot consist with a true de∣sire
to bring over the Dissenters to the Church, not to
Encourage those who are in part brought over; since
if they had any Regard to Posterity, 'tis more than
probable, the Occasional Conformity of the present Dis∣senters,
is a great step towards Reconciling their Poste∣rity
Absolutely.</P>
<P>These Arguments would certainly be moving, were
not the whole a State Trick, a Machine of Govern∣ment,
to prevent a Union between the Low Church-Men
and the Dissenters, which the other Party Indu∣striously
avoid, lest such a Conjunction should prove
fatal to them, and they should by that means be out
Voted in Elections.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>New Association,</HI> a Pamphlet, suited
to the very bottom of this scandalous Design, has Ex∣plain'd
this in his worthy Scheme of depriving the
Dissenters of their Liberty, of Voting as Free Hol∣ders,
a step none of the Party had ever yet the Im∣pudence
to take; but tho' it was always in the design,
they carefully kept it as a Secret, till this Impolitick
Author thought the Case was Ripe for a Discovery,
and so Midwif'd it into the World before its time.</P>
<P>In his second Volume, he is wonderful Angry, at be∣ing
charg'd with having discover'd <HI>the Shortest Way,</HI>
and Ruffles the Author of the Explanation upon that
Head.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Alas, good Man, he would not be Guilty of such a
Bloody Doctrine, he only desires that the Dissenters
might be Unfranchis'd as <HI>English</HI> Men, and not only,
not be Magistrates, or Members of Parliament, but
have no Power to Vote for such as are.</P>
<P>What does this Gentleman think of the Dissenters,
that they should be so Blind, as not to see the <HI>Shortest
Way,</HI> thro' all this; but since such People must be
charg'd Home before they will Confess,</P>
<P>Let any Man but Examine, what in Reason must be
the Consequence, when all the Dissenters should be
thus Disarm'd of their Civil Rights, and such Men
chosen into all Places of Magistracy and Legislature,
as are suitable to the Temper of Mr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> and
of this Author; let even themselves tell us when this
is perfected, <HI>and the Bloody Flag Hung out,</HI> what ought
the Dissenters to expect?</P>
<P>Will they tell us, this may be done, and our Tole∣ration
not injur'd? Are we to sit still under it all, and
own this is no Persecution? Are we to caress the
Church, and say, Peace, Peace, are we to own they go
on with the Queen's <HI>Peace and Ʋnion?</HI></P>
<P>Are we under all this to say, That the Lenity and
Mercy of the Church is conspicuous, in granting us Leave
to go to our Meetings and serve God our own Way; and
grant, that Suffering the Loss of Civil Rites to obtain or
to maintain this, is no Suffering for Religion, nor in the
Imposer is no Oppression?</P>
<P>When we are thus passive, it must be own'd they do
us no Wrong, who tell us, we are of the Tribe of <HI>Issa∣char,</HI>
and give us for our Coat of Arms, an Ass Cou∣chant
under a Church Rampant.</P>
<P>The Dissenters may indeed have the Misfortune to be
oppress'd, and oblig'd to bear these things; but it shall ne∣ver
be said they did not foresee it, and complain of the
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Wrong; they shall not be taxt with Blindness, tho' they
may with Weakness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oxford</HI> Getleman they say, has again appear'd,
in the World to advance the Rites of the Church, in
Answer to a late Pamphlet, call'd <HI>The Rights of the Dis∣senters.</HI></P>
<P>As to his Arguments, I leave him for the present to
his proper Adversary.—So far as he treats me with ill
Language, I say nothing to him, for a Railing Accu∣sation
is the Part of the Devil, Bear-Garden Language
is his particular Talent; and they that would have a far∣ther
Character of him, are refer'd to a Certain Reverend
Bishop in <HI>England,</HI> who when he denyed him Orders,
not for his want of Learning, so much as his want of
<HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> gave him also the Title he De∣served,
by which he will be known to his Friends,
and to us, he is known in his Books, as a Pulpit Incen∣diary,
the Churches Bloody Standard Bearer, the Trum∣peter
sent out by High Church Authority, in spight of
the Queen and her Summons, <HI>to Preach against Ʋnion,</HI> to
Proclaim open <HI>War between Parties,</HI> to Hang out <HI>Flags
of Defyance,</HI> and to tell her Majesty, she cannot have a
true Zeal for the Church, unless she pleases <HI>to Break
her Word, and do so too.</HI></P>
<P>Now among the Rights of the Church, if they can
bring it out, and prove to us, the Church of <HI>England</HI>
has a right of <HI>Coertion</HI> upon Conscience, has a right to
persecute their Dissenting Brethren, they gain their
point.</P>
<P>If they have a right to Compel us to come in, and
to force our Consciences; then 'tis certain we can have
no right to the Toleration, and the Queen in her Promises
to maintain it, Invaded the rights of the Church; for
we can have no right to that Freedom, which they have
a right to Limit, or Prescribe, and the Queen cannot
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
promise to Maintain us, in that which they have a Right to
restrain and prevent,—Thus as the Dissenters are brought
in, Claiming a Liberty, they have no Right to, the Queen
is also brought in, Establishing and Promising us to Maintain
that Liberty, they have a Right to take away, and by conse∣quence
Invading the Rights of the Church.</P>
<P>And thus the Right of preventing Occasional Conformity,
will be presently decided; and I am free to Challenge, all the
Advocates for it, to enter into the Argument, of which this is
the Abstract.</P>
<Q><P><HI>If the Church has a Right to Persecute for Conscience;</HI> Then the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> have no Right to Toleration.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Church</HI> has a Right to <HI>Persecute;</HI> Ergo.</P></Q>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>ECONTRA.</HEAD>
<Q><P>If the <HI>Church</HI> has no Right to <HI>Persecute for Conscience Sake;</HI>
Then the <HI>Dissenters</HI> have a Right to the <HI>Liberty</HI> they now
Enjoy, by the <HI>Toleration;</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Church</HI> has no Right to <HI>Persecute,</HI> as it is prov'd
from the Apostles Words, <HI>whether it be Right to Obey God,
rather than Man, judge ye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI>—The <HI>Dissenters</HI> have a Right to <HI>Liberty of Con∣science,</HI>
and <HI>Toleration.</HI></P></Q>
<P>If the Church has a Right to Persecute, then the Queen can
have no Right to Tolerate; for two Contraries, cannot be E∣rected
upon one Foundation of Right.</P>
<P>If then the Queen had no Right to Tolerate the Dissenters,
by promising to do so, She promises to do what She cannot Le∣gally
perform; and that Promise ought not to be kept.</P>
<P>But if the Church has no Right to Persecute, then had the
Queen a Right to give them a Toleration; and what it is
Lawful to Grant, it must be Lawful to Continue; and there∣fore
Her Majesty's Gracious Promise, must be a Sacred Secu∣rity
to us, because She had an Undoubted Right to make
it.</P>
<P>So that the whole Argument must Turn upon this, whe∣ther
the Church, has a Right to force the Conscience, or in
plain <HI>English,</HI> to Persecute for Conscience Sake.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
If they can get over this, the Argument is at an End, and
we must Submit to any thing they please to Inflict; they having
an Undoubted Right to Inflict it.</P>
<P>All the Dissenters dependance therefore, and all their Moral
Security is plac'd, not in the Act of Toleration, for that may
be Mortal, but in Her Majesty's Sacred Promise.</P>
<P>And the Care Her Majesty has taken, to make us Easy on this
Head, is very Remarkable; and ought to Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>courage the
Party from the Attempt. We have a Promise, within a Promise;
The Queen, as if her Majesty had seen Occasion for more than
ordinary assurance, has given us first a Promise, that She will
preserve the Toleration, and Protect the Dissenters in their
Liberty of Conscience; and She has Clinch'd this En∣gagement,
by another as Solemn, wherein She Promises, to be
always a Religious Observer of her Word.</P>
<P>What hopes then can any Party of Men entertain, of ma∣king
the least attack upon the Dissenters Liberty, without
a barefac'd Presumption, that they shall obtain upon Her Ma∣jesty
to break her Word?</P>
<P>Upon this Account it is, I would have the Dissenters Easie;
those Endeavours which have been made use of to Ruine them,
have been in Vain; Her Majesty has kept her Promise hitherto,
and there is no need to fear, but She will keep it.</P>
<P>Some People perhaps pretend to say, when Her Majesty
made this Promise, She did not expect to be taken in so large
a Sence; I can say nothing to that, further than that I don't
believe them.</P>
<P>But I believe, before the Late King's Death, had we told those
Gentlemen, the Queen would have made such a Promise, they
would have said, <HI>we were mistaken,</HI> when She did make it, they
found <HI>themselves mistaken.</HI> If the Queen thinks they like it,
<HI>Her Majesty is mistaken,</HI> and if ever Her Majesty breaks it,
<HI>we shall be all mistaken.</HI></P>
