<HEAD>Proper for the Reader to be ac∣quainted with.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I first published the life of this beautiful Lady, which was in the year 1724, I sent one of the books, as a present, to my old friend and acquaintance Mr. Thomas Sou∣therne, author of the Tragedy of Oroonoko.</P>
<P>When he had read my book, he paid me a visit at my house in Isling∣ton; and, agreeable to his usual face∣tiousness, for he was an excellent companion, rallied me severely in my making the Lady, the Heroine of the work, so unnatural to her children in her disowning them; and added, that what I had related concerning
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
her circumstances, as to her poverty, in the latter part of her life, he knew to be false; for, on the contrary, he knew her not only to be rich, but very rich; and he was so free with me, as to tell me that I knew it also; and that, he imagined, I afflicted her, in that particular, for the sake of the moral only, that her wickedness, he said, as I was pleased to call it, might not go unpunished. He further ad∣ded, her deportment, elegance of manners, and graceful behaviour, were equal, if not superior, to the beauty of her features, and that he ever at∣tributed her successes to the former, as much as to the latter; yet, said he, her complexion and features were so happily, and so agreeably united, that when she was at the age of forty, no person whatever in her company could have believed she exceeded four-and-twenty; nay, he added, when he saw her in the fiftieth year of her age, had she not told him herself to the con∣trary, he should not have taken her to be much above thirty.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
He still further added, she was in the possession of two inestimable jew∣els; that is to say, a good head, and a good heart; the fruits of whom, her friends were sure always to be plen∣tifully provided at her table; the one from her agreeable conversation and politeness; the other from her gene∣rosity and liberality; as were likewise the poor, who had their share of the latter, and who were seldom or ever sent empty away. And though she fre∣quently in her reflections, calls her∣self a prostitute; a strumpet; yet, said he, in the true sense of the words, she was as chaste, with respect to the person whom she lived with, as the most virtuous wife could be to a husband.</P>
<P>In my excuse, for Mr. Southerne is an excellent judge of what is proper in history, as well as in poetry; I told him, as to that part concerning her children, I not only had it from her original papers, but also from the Lady herself, in the several conversa∣tions
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
that had passed between us, and those so lately as the year 1723, in which year she died; and the reasons she gave me were: she was, she said, terrified, in her thinking of her two eldest daughters, who survived her, and who are both married, to whom she gave ample fortunes; I say she was terrified, for fear they should ever come to the knowledge of the wicked course of life she had formerly led, both in England and in France.</P>
<P>But upon my Friend's saying so much to me, and he giving me some few hints, has occasioned me to re∣store the children, and alter the catas∣trophe, by rescuing her from that pretended poverty, though not from her remorse, which at the conclusion, I before had plunged her in.</P>
<P>The history of this extraordinary Lady, is to speak for itself. If it is not as beautiful as the lady herself was known to be; if it is not as diverting as the reader can de∣sire,
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
and much more than he can reasonably expect; and if all the most diverting parts of it are not adapted to the instruction and improvement of the Reader, it must be from the defect of my own performance; dres∣sing up the story worse than the Lady, whose words I relate, prepar∣ed it for the world.</P>
<P>Though she had in her history of her life, omitted the names, yet as I afterwards came to the knowledge of the persons whom she meant, and, what she had said of them, except∣ing of her husband, and his sister, being much to their credit, I have thought proper to insert them. She likewise went on with her history, from the beginning to the end, with∣out any obstruction: I have thought proper, for the ease of the reader, to throw it into chapters; that he, like a traveller on the road, when he espies a good inn, may put up his horse, and rest both himself and his beast; may also when tired, lay down
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
the book, at the several resting places, I before have appointed.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to say, that this story differs from most of the modern performances of this kind, though some of them have met with a very good reception in the world: I say, it differs from them in this great and essential article, namely, that the foundation of this is laid in truth of fact; and so the work is not a story, but a history.</P>
<P>I was particularly acquainted with this lady's first husband, Mr. Ba∣con, the Brewer, and with his bad cir∣cumstances; I knew his father also, and know that first part of the story to be truth.</P>
<P>This may, I hope, be a pledge for the credit of the rest; and though some part of her history lay abroad, and cannot so well be vouched as
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
the first; yet, as she told it to me herself, I have not the least reason to question the truth of that part also.</P>
<P>In the manner she has told the story, it is evident she does not insist upon her justification in any one part of it; much less does she re∣commend her conduct, or indeed, any part of it, except her re∣pentance to our imitation: On the contrary, she makes frequent excur∣sions, in a just censuring and con∣demning her own practice. How often does she reproach herself in the most passionate manner; and guide us to just reflections in the like cases?</P>
<P>It is true, she met with surprising success, in all her intrigues; but even in the highest elevations of her prosperity, she makes frequent ac∣knowledgments, that the pleasure of her wickedness was not worth the pain of the repentance; and that all
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
the satisfaction she had, all the joy in the view of her prosperity, no, nor all the wealth she rolled in; the gaiety of her appearance; the equi∣pages, and the honours, she was at∣tended with, could quiet her mind, abate the reproaches of her consci∣ence, or procure her an hour's sleep, when just reflections kept her wak∣ing.</P>
<P>The noble inferences that are drawn from this one part, are worth all the rest of the story; and abundantly justify, as they are the professed de∣sign of, the publication.</P>
<P>If there are any parts in her story, which being obliged to relate a wick∣ed action, seem to describe it too plainly; all imaginable care has been taken to keep clear of indecencies, and immodest expressions; and 'tis hoped you will find nothing to prompt a vicious mind, but every where much to discourage and expose it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13"/>
Scenes of crime can scarce be re∣presented in such a manner, but some may make a criminal use of them; but when vice is painted in its low∣prized colours, 'tis not to make peo∣ple in love with it, but to expose it; and if the reader makes a wrong use of the figures, the wickedness is his own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the advantages of the present work are so great, and the virtuous reader has room for so much improvement, that I make no question, the story will find a passage to his best hours; and be read both with profit and delight.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of Mademoiselle de Beleau; Or, ROXANA, The Fortunate Mistress: Afterwards Countess of Wintselsheim.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>A Wedding, and an Elopement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY Father, Mr. John de Beleau, was a merchant, in the city of Poictiers, in the province, or county of Poictou, in France; from whence I was brought to England by my parents, when I was about ten years of age, where my fa∣ther lived in very good circumstances, and died in about eleven years after he came to London; in which time, as I had accomplished myself for the sociable part of the world, so I had ac∣quainted myself with some of our English neigh∣bours, as is the custom in London; and as, while I was young, I had picked-up three or four play-fellows and companions, suitable to my years; so, as we grew bigger, we learnt to call one∣another intimates and friends; and this forwarded
<PB N="2" REF="16"/>
very much the finishing me for conversation, and the world.</P>
<P>I went to English schools, and being young, I learnt the English tongue perfectly well, with all the customs, of the English young Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; so that I re∣tained nothing of the French but the language; nor did I so much as keep any remains of the French accent in speaking, as most foreigners do, but spoke what we call natural English, as if I had been born here.</P>
<P>Being to give my own character, I must be ex∣cused to give it as impartially as possible, and as if I was speaking of another person; and the se∣quel will lead you to judge whether I flatter my∣self or no.</P>
<P>I was, unless I was flattered, at the age of four∣teen, tall, and extremely well shaped; being French born, I danced, as some say, naturally, loved it exceedingly, played on the harpsichord, and sung well also, and so well, that as you will hear, it was afterwards some advantage to me. With all these accomplishments, I wanted neither wit, beauty, or fortune. In this manner I set out into the world, having all the advantages that any young woman could desire, to recommend me to others, and form a prospect of happy living to myself.</P>
<P>One day, when my father returned from hunt∣ing, he brought home with him to dine, a Mr. Bacon, a brewer; I was then turned of fifteen. This person by frequently coming to our house, at length, made his addresses in form, and having my father's consent, he not only also obtained mine, but a portion of two thousand pounds besides.</P>
<P>With this precious thing called a husband, I lived eight years, and for some part of the time,
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
kept a coach, that is to say, a kind of mock-coach; for all the week the horses were kept at work in the dray-carts, but on Sunday I had the privilege to go abroad in it, either to church, or otherways, as my husband and I could agree; which, by the way, was not very often: but of that hereafter.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the history of the married part of my life, you must allow me to give as impartial an account of my husband, as I have done of myself. He was a jolly, handsome fel∣low, as any woman need wish for a companion; tall, and well made: he danced well, which, I think, was the first thing that brought us to∣gether: he had a father, who managed the bu∣siness carefully, so that he had little of that part lay on him, but now-and-then to appear, and show himself; and he took the advantage of it, for he troubled himself very little about it, but went abroad, kept company, hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.</P>
<P>After I have told you that he was a handsome man, and a good sportsman, I have, indeed, said all; and unhappy was I, like other young peo∣ple of our sex, I chose him, as I have said, for being handsome; for he was otherwise a weak, empty-headed, untaught creature, as ever any wo∣man could desire to be coupled with: and here I must take the liberty, whatever I have to reproach myself with in my after-conduct, to turn to my fellow-creatures, the young Ladies of this country, and speak to them by way of precaution. If you have any regard to your future happiness, any view of living comfortably with a husband, any hope of preserving your for∣tunes, or restoring them after any disaster; never, Ladies, marry a fool; any husband rather than a fool: with some other husbands you may be un∣happy,
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
but with a fool you will be miserable: with another husband you may, I say, be unhap∣py, but with a fool you must; nay, if he would, he cannot make you easy; every thing he does is so aukward, every thing he says is so empty, a woman of any sense cannot but be surfeited, and sick of him many times a-day: what is more shocking, than for a woman to bring a handsome comely fellow of a husband into company, and then be obliged to blush for him every time she hears him speak? To hear other Gentlemen talk sense, and he able to say nothing? and so look like a fool, or, which is worse, hear him talk non∣sense, and be laughed at for a fool.</P>
<P>In the next place, there are so many sorts of fools, such an infinite variety of fools, and so hard it is to know the worst of that kind, that I am obliged to say, no fool, Ladies, at all, no kind of fool; whether a mad fool, or a sober fool, a wise fool, or a silly fool; take any thing but a fool; nay, be any thing, be even an old-maid, the worst of nature's curses, rather than take up with a fool.</P>
<P>But to leave this a-while, for I shall have oc∣casion to speak of it again; my case was particu∣larly hard, for I had a variety of foolish things complicated in this unhappy match.</P>
<P>First, He was a conceited fool: he would have it, every thing he said, was right, was best, and was to the purpose, whoever was in company, and whatever was advanced by others, though with the greatest modesty imaginable; and yet when he came to defend what he had said, he would do it so weakly, so emptily, and so nothing to the purpose, that it was enough to make any-body that heard him, sick and ashamed of him.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19"/>
Secondly, He was positive and obstinate, and the most positive in the most simple and inconsistent things, such as were intolerable to bear.</P>
<P>These two articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a most unbearable creature for a husband; and so it may be supposed at first sight, what a kind of life I led with him: however, I did as well as I could, and held my tongue, which was the only victory I gained over him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling way with me, and I would not answer, or enter into discourse with him on the point he was upon, he would rise up in the greatest passion imaginable, and go away; which was the cheapest way I had to get rid of him.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here much, upon the method I took to make my life passable and easy with the most incorrigible temper in the world; but it is too long, and the articles too trifling: I shall mention some of them as the circumstances I am to relate, shall necessarily bring them in.</P>
<P>After I had been married about four years, my own father died, my mother having been dead before. He liked my match so ill, and saw so little room to be satisfied with the conduct of my husband, that though he left me five thousand livres, and more at his death, yet he left it in the hands of my elder brother, who running on too rashly in his adventures, as a merchant, failed, and lost not only what he had of his own, but what he had for me too; as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>Thus I lost the last gift of my father's bounty, by having a husband not fit to be trusted with it; there is one of the benefits of marrying a fool.</P>
<P>Within two years after my own father's death, my husband's father also died, and, as I thought,
<PB N="6" REF="20"/>
left him a considerable addition to his estate, the whole trade of the brewhouse, which was a very good one, being now his own.</P>
<P>But this addition to his stock was his ruin, for he had no genius to business; he had no knowledge of his accounts; he bustled a little about it indeed, at first, and put on a face of business, but he soon grew slack; it was below him to inspect his books, he committed all that to his clerk; and while he found money in cash to pay the maltster, and the excise, and put some in his pocket, he was perfectly easy and indolent, let the main chance go how it would.</P>
<P>I foresaw the consequence of this, and at∣tempted several times to persuade him to apply himself to business; I put him in mind how his customers complained of the neglect of his ser∣vants on the one hand, and how abundance broke in his debt, on the other, for want of the clerk's care to secure him: yet he thrust me by, either with hard words, or fraudulently, with represent∣ing the cases otherwise than they were.</P>
<P>However, to cut short a dull story, which ought not to be long, he began to find his trade sunk, his stock declined, and that, in short, he could not carry on his business, and twice his brewing utensils were extented for the excise; and the last time he was put to great extremities to clear them.</P>
<P>This alarmed him, and he resolved to lay down his trade; which, indeed, I was not sorry for; foreseeing that if he did not lay it down in time, he would be forced to do it another way, namely, as a bankrupt. Also I was willing he should draw out while he had something left, lest I should come to be stript at home, and be turned out of doors with my children; for I had now
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
five children by him; the only work, perhaps, that fools are good for.</P>
<P>I thought myself happy when he got another man to take his brewhouse clear off of his hands; for paying down a large sum of money, my husband found himself a clear man, all his debts paid, and with between two and three thou∣sand pounds in his pocket: and being now o∣bliged to remove from the brewhouse, we took a house at Kentish-town, a village about two miles from London; and happy I thought myself, all things considered, that I was got off clear, upon so good terms; and had my handsome fellow had but a few grains of wit, I had been still well enough.</P>
<P>I proposed to him either to buy some place with the money, or with part of it, and offered to join my part to it, which was then in being, and might have been secured; so we might have lived tolerably, at least, during his life. But as it is the part of a fool to be void of counsel, so he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his horses and men, rid every day out to the forest a hunting, and nothing was done all this while; but the money decreased apace, and I thought I saw my ruin hastening on, without any possible way to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was not wanting with all that persuasions and entreaties could perform, but it was all fruitless. Representing to him how fast our money wasted and what would be our condition when it was gone, made no impression on him; but, like one stupid, he went on, not valuing all that tears and lamentations could be supposed to do; nor did he abate his figure or equipage, his horses or
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
servants, even to the last; till he had not a hun∣dred pound left in the whole world.</P>
<P>It was not above three years that all the rea∣dy-money was thus spending off; yet he spent it, as I may say, foolishly too, for he kept no valuable company neither; but generally with huntsmen and horse-coarsers, and men meaner than himself, which is another consequence of a man's being a fool; such can never take de∣light in men more wise and capable than them∣selves; and that makes them converse with scoun∣drels, drink with porters, and keep company al∣ways below themselves.</P>
<P>This was my wretched state, when one morn∣ing my husband told me, he was sensible he was come to a miserable condition, and he would go and seek his fortune somewhere or other. He had said something to that purpose several times be∣fore that, upon my pressing him to consider his circumstances, and the circumstances of his family before it should be too late: but as I found he had no meaning in any thing of that kind, as indeed, he had not much in any thing he ever said; so I thought they were but words of course now. When he said he would be gone, I used to wish secretly, and even say in my thoughts, I wish you would, for if you go on thus, you will starve us all.</P>
<P>He stayed, however, at home all that day, and lay at home that night; early the next morning he gets out of bed, goes to a window which looked out towards the stables, and sounds his French-horn, as he called it; which was his usual signal to call his men to go out a hunting.</P>
<P>It was the latter-end of August, and so was light yet at five o'clock, and it was about that time that I heard him and his two men go out
<PB REF="23"/>
and shut the yard-gates after them. He said no∣thing to me more than as usual when he used to go out upon his sport; neither did I rise, or say any thing to him that was material, but went to-sleep again after he was gone.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>A Scene of Distress.—Fidelity of a Servant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT must be a little surprising to the reader to tell him at once, that after this, I never saw my husband more; but to go farther, I not only ne∣ver saw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of any or either of his two ser∣vants, or of the horses, either what became of them, where, or which way they went, or what they did, or intended to do, no more than if the ground had opened and swallowed them all up, and no-body had known it, for several years after.</P>
<P>I was not, for the first night or two, at all surprized, no nor very much the first week or two, believing that if any thing evil had befallen them, I should soon enough have heard of that; and also knowing that he had two servants and three horses with him, it would be the strangest thing in the world that any thing could befal them all, but that I must some time or other hear of them.</P>
<P>But you will easily allow, that as time run on a week, two weeks, a month, two months, and so on, I was dreadfully frighted at last, and the more when I looked into my own circumstances, and considered the condition in which I was left; with five children, and no subsistence for them, excepting about seventy pounds in money,
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>
and what few things of value I had about me, which, though considerable in themselves, were yet nothing to feed a family, and for a length of time too.</P>
<P>What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have recourse. To keep in the house where I was, I could not, the rent being too great; and to leave it without his order, if my husband should re∣turn, I could not think of that neither; so that I continued extremely perplexed, melancholy, and discouraged, to the last degree.</P>
<P>I remained in this dejected condition near a twelvemonth. My husband had two sisters, who were married, and lived very well, and some o∣ther near relations that I knew of, and I hoped would do something for me; and I frequently sent to these, to know if they could give me any account of my vagrant creature; but they all declared to me in answer, that they knew no∣thing about him; and after frequent sending, began to think me troublesome, and to let me know they thought so too, by their treating my maid with very slight and unhandsome returns to her inquiries.</P>
<P>This grated hard, and added to my affliction; but I had no recourse but to my tears, for I had not a friend of my own left me in the world: I should have observed, that it was about half a year before this elopement of my husband, that the disaster I mentioned above befel my bro∣ther; who broke, and that in such bad cir∣cumstances, that I had the mortification to hear not only that he was in prison, but that there would be little or nothing to be had by way of composition.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="25"/>
Misfortunes seldom come alone: this was the forerunner of my husband's flight; and as my expectations were cut off on that side, my hus∣band gone, and my family of children on my hands, and nothing to subsist them, my con∣dition was the most deplorable that words can express.</P>
<P>I had some plate and some jewels, as might be supposed, my fortune and former circum∣stances considered; and my husband, who had never stayed to be distressed, had not been put to the necessity of rifling me, as husbands usually do in such cases: but as I had seen an end of all the ready-money, during the long time I had lived in a state of expectation for my husband, so I began to make away one thing after another, till those few things of value which I had, be∣gan to lessen apace, and I saw nothing but misery and the utmost distress before me, even to have my children starve before my face. I leave any one that is a mother of children, and has lived in plenty and genteelly, to consider and reflect, what must be my condition. As to my husband, I had now no hope or expectation of seeing him any more: and, indeed, if I had, he was the man, of all the men in the world, the least able to help me, or to have turned his hand to the gaining one shilling towards lessening our distress; he neither had the capacity or the inclination; he could have been no clerk, for he scarce wrote a legible hand; he was so far from being able to write sense, that he could not make sense of what others wrote; he was so far from understanding good English, that he could not spell good English: to be out of all business was his de∣light;
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
and he would stand leaning against a post for half an hour together, with a pipe in his mouth, with all the tranquility in the world, smokeing, like Dryden's Clown, who
<Q>—whistled as he went for want of thought;</Q>
and this even when his family was as it were starving, that little he had wasting, and that we were all bleeding to death; he not knowing, and as little considering, where to get another shilling when the last was spent.</P>
<P>This being his temper, and the extent of his capacity, I confess I did not see so much loss in his parting with me, as at first I thought I did; though it was hard and cruel to the last degree in him, not giving me the least notice of his design; and, indeed, that which I was most astonished at, was, that seeing he must certainly have in∣tended this e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cursion some few moments at least, before he put it in practice, yet he did not come and take what little stock of money we had left; or at least, a share of it, to bear his expence for a little while: but he did not; and I am morally certain he had not five guineas with him in the world, when he went away: all that I could come to the knowledge of, about him, was, that he left his hunting-horn, which he called the French-horn in the stable, and his hunting-saddle, went away in a handsome furniture, as they call it, which he used sometimes to travel with; hav∣ing an embroidered housing, a case of pistols, and other things belonging to them; and one of his servants had another saddle with pistols, though plain; and the other a long gun; so that they did not go out as sportsmen, but ra∣ther as travellers: what part of the world they went to, I never heard for many years.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="27"/>
As I have said, I sent to his relations, but they sent me short and surly answers; nor did any one of them offer to come to see me, or to see the children, or so much as to enquire after them, well perceiving that I was in a condition that was likely to be soon troublesome: but it was no time now to dally with them, or with the world; I left off sending, and went myself among them; laid my circumstances open, told them my whole case, and the condition I was reduced to, begged they would advise me what course to take, laid myself as low as they could desire, and intreated them to consider that I was not in a condition to help myself, and that without some assistance, we must all inevitably perish: I told them, that if I had but one child, or two children, I would have done my endeavour to have worked for them with my needle, and should only have come to beg them to help me to some work, that I might get our bread by my la∣bour; but to think of one single woman not bred to work, and at a loss where to get em∣ployment, to get the bread for five children, that was not possible, some of my children being young too, and none of them big enough to help one another.</P>
<P>It was all one. I received not the least assist∣ance from any-body, was hardly asked to sit down at the two sisters houses, nor offered to eat or drink at two more near relations. The fifth, an ancient gentlewoman, a Mrs. Goodwill, aunt∣in-law to my husband, a widow, and the least able of any, did, indeed, ask me to sit down, gave me a dinner, and refreshed me with a kinder treatment than any of the rest; but added the melancholly part, viz. That she would have
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
helped me, but that, indeed, she was not able: which, however, I was satisfied was very true.</P>
<P>Here I relieved myself with the constant as∣sistant of the afflicted, I mean tears; for rela∣ting to her how I was received by the other of my husband's relations, it made me burst into tears, and I cried vehemently for a great while together, till I made the good old Lady cry too several times.</P>
<P>However, I came home from them all with∣out any relief, and went on at home till I was reduced to such inexpressible distress, that it is not to be described. I had been several times after this at the old aunt's; for I prevailed with her to promise me to go and talk with the other relations; at least, that, if possible, she could bring some of them to take my children, or to contribute something towards their mainte∣nance; and, to do her justice, she did use her endeavour with them, but all was to no pur∣pose, they would do nothing, at least that way: I think, with much entreaty, she obtained, by a kind of collection among them all, about eleven or twelve shillings; which, though it was a pre∣sent comfort, was not yet to be named as ca∣pable to deliver me from any part of the load that lay upon me.</P>
<P>There was a poor woman, a Mrs. Barton, that had been a kind of a dependant upon our family, and who I had often, among the rest of the relations, been very kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor woman, and to see whether she might not be able to help, in this dreadful case.</P>
<P>I must remember it here, to the praise of this poor girl, my maid, that though I was not able
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>
to give her any wages, and had told her so, yet she would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any money, when I had none, she would help me out of her own.</P>
<P>Amy, for that was her name, put it into my thoughts to send for this poor woman to come to me, for I was now in great distress, and I resolved to do so; but just the very morning that I intended it, the old aunt, with the poor woman in her company, came to see me: the good old Gentlewoman was, it seems, heartily concerned for me, and had been talking again among those people, to see what she could do for me; bur to very little purpose.</P>
<P>You shall judge a little of my present distress by the posture they found me in: I had five small children, the eldest was under ten years old, and I had not one shilling in the house to buy them victuals, but had sent Amy out with a small silver spoon, to sell it, and bring home something from the butcher's; and I was in a parlour, sitting on the ground, with a great heap of old linen rags, and other things about me, looking them over, to see if I had any thing among them that would sell or pawn for a little money, and had been crying ready to burst my∣self, to think what I should do next.</P>
<P>At this juncture they knocked at the door. I thought it had been Amy, so I did not rise up, but one of the children opened the door, and they came directly into the room where I was, and where they found me in that posture, and crying vehemently, as above. I was surprised at their coming, you may be sure, especially seeing the person I had just before resolved to send for: but when they saw me, how I looked, for my
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>
eyes were swelled with crying, and what a con∣dition I was in as to the house, and the heaps of things that were about me, and especially when I told them what I was doing, and on what occasion, they sat down, like Job's three comforters, and said not one word to me for a great while, but both of them cried as fast, and as heartily as I did.</P>
<P>The truth was, there was no need of much discourse in the case, the thing spoke itself. They saw me in want and misery, who but a little be∣fore lived in affluence and splendor; thin, dejected and pale, who was lately comely and beauti∣ful: the house, that was before handsomely fur∣nished with pictures and ornaments, cabinets, pier-glasses, and every thing suitable, was now stripped, and naked, most of the goods having been seized by the landlord for rent, or sold to buy necessaries; in a word, all was misery and distress; the face of ruin was every where to be seen; we had eaten up almost every thing, and little remained, unless, like one of the pitiful wo∣men of Jerusalem, I should eat up my very children themselves.</P>
<P>After these two good creatures had sat, as I say, in silence some time, and had then looked about them, my maid Amy came in, and brought with her a small breast of mutton, and two bunches of turnips, which she intended to stew for our dinner: as for me, my heart was so over∣whelmed at seeing these two friends, for such they were, though poor, and at their seeing me in such a condition, that I fell into another vi∣olent fit of crying; so that, in short, I could not speak to them again for a great while longer.</P>
<P>During my being in such an agony, they went to my maid Amy at another part of the same
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
room, and talked with her. Amy told them all my circumstances, and set them forth in such moving terms, that I could not, upon any ac∣count have done it like her myself; and in a word, affected them both with it in such a man∣ner, that the old aunt came to me, and though hardly able to speak for tears: <Q>“Look ye, Cou∣sin,”</Q> said she, <Q>“things must not stand thus; some course must be taken, and that directly; pray where were these children born?”</Q> I told her the parish where we lived before, that four of them were born there; and one in the house where I now was, where the Landlord, after having feised my goods for the rent past, not then knowing that I had five children, had now given me leave to live for a whole year without any rent, being moved with compassion; but that this year was now almost expired.</P>
<P>Upon hearing this account, they came to this resolution: that the children should be all car∣ried by them to the door of one of the relati∣ons mentioned above, and be set down there by Amy, and that I should remove for some days, shut up the doors, and be gone; that the people should be told, that if they did not think fit to take some care of the children, they might send for the churchwardens if they thought that better; for that they were born in that pa∣rish, and there they must be provided for. As for the other child, which was born in the pa∣rish, that was already taken care of by the pa∣rish officers; for, indeed, they were so sensible of the distress of the family, that they had, at first word, done what was their part to do.</P>
<P>This was what these good women proposed, and bade me leave the rest to them. I was at
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
first, sadly afflicted at the thoughts of parting with my children, and especially at that horrid thing, their being taken into the parish-keep∣ing; and then a hundred terrible things came into my thoughts; viz. of parish-children being starved at nurse; of their being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being taken care of; and this sunk my very heart within me.</P>
<P>But the misery of my own circumstances hard∣ened my heart against my own flesh and blood; and when I considered they must inevitably be starved, and I too, if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconciled to parting with them all, any how, and any where, that I might be freed from the dreadful necessity of see∣ing them all perish, and perishing with them my∣self: so I agreed to go away out of the house, and leave the management of the whole matter to Amy, and to them, and accordingly I did so; and the same afternoon they carried them all away to one of their aunts.</P>
<P>Amy, a resolute girl, knocked at the door, with the children all with her, and bade the eldest, as soon as the door was open, run in, and the rest after her. She set them all down at the door before she knocked, and when she knocked, she stayed till a maid-servant came to the door; <Q>'Sweetheart,' said she, “pray go in and tell your mistress, here are her little cousins come to see her:” at which the maid offered to go back.</Q> 'Here, child,' says Amy, <Q>“take one of them in” your hand, and I will bring the rest;”</Q> so she gives her the least, and the wench goes in mighty inno∣cently, with the little one in her hand, upon which
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
Amy turns the rest in after her, shuts the door softly, and hurried away as fast as she could.</P>
<P>Just in the interval of this, and even while the maid and her mistress were quarrelling, for the mistress raved and scolded at her like a mad-woman, and had ordered her to go and stop Amy, and turn all the children out of the doors again; but she had been at the door, and Amy was gone, and the wench was out of her wits, and the mistress too: I say, just at this juncture came the poor old woman, Mrs. Barton, not the aunt, but the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the door. The aunt did not go, because she had been an advocate for me, and they would have suspected her of some contri∣vance; but as for the other, they did not so much as know that she had kept up any correspondence with me.</P>
<P>Amy and she had concerted this between them, and it was well enough contrived that they did so. When she came into the house the mistress was fuming and raging like one distracted, and call∣ing the maid all the foolish jades and sluts that she could think of, and that she would take the children and turn them all out into the streets. The good poor woman seeing her in such a passion, turned about as if she would be gone again; and said, <Q>“Madam, I will come again another time, I see you are engaged.”</Q>—<Q>“No, no, Barton,”</Q> says the Mistress, <Q>“I am not much engaged, sit down: this senseless creature here, has brought in my fool of a brother's whole house of chil∣dren upon me, and tells me, that a wench brought them to the door, and thrust them in, and bade her carry them to me; but it shall be no disturbance to me, for I have ordered them
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>
to be set in the street, without the door, and so let the churchwardens take care of them, or else make this dull jade carry them back again; and let her that brought them into the world, look after them if she will; what does she send her brats to me for?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The last, indeed, had been the best of the two,' says Mrs. Barton, 'if it had been to be done; and that brings me to tell you my errand, and the occasion of my coming, for I came on purpose about this very business, and to have pre∣vented this being put upon you, if I could; but I see I am come too late.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“How do you mean too late,' says the Mis∣tress? 'what, have you been concerned in this affair then? what have you helped to bring this family-slur upon us?'—'I hope you do not think such a thing of me, Madam?</Q> says the poor woman; but I went this morning to see my old mistress and benefactress, for she had been very kind to me, and when I came to the door, I found all fast locked and bolted, and the house” looking as if no-body was at home.</P>
<P><Q>“I knocked at the door, but no-body came, till at last some of the neighbours servants called to me, and said,'—"There is no-body lives there Mistress, what do you knock for?"—'I seemed surprized at that:'—"What no-body live there!" 'said I,' "what do you mean! does not Mrs. Bacon live there?"—'The an∣swer was,—"No, she is gone;"—'At which I parlied with one of them, and asked her what was the matter?'—"Matter!" says she, "why it is matter enough; the poor Gentlewoman has livest there all alone, and without any thing
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
to subsist her, a long time, and this morning” the landlord turned her out of doors.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Out of doors!' says I, 'what with all her chil∣dren; poor lambs! what are become of them?' Why truly, nothing worse," 'said they,' can come to them than staying here, for they were almost starved with hunger; so the neighbours seeing the poor Lady in such distress, for she stood crying, and wringing her hands over her children like one distracted, sent for the churchwardens to take care of the children; and they, when they came, took the youngest, which was born in the parish, and have got it a very good nurse, and taken care of it; but as for the other four, they had sent them away to some of their father's relations, and who were very substantial people, and who besides” that, lived in the parish where they were born.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I was not so surprized at this, as not presently to foresee that this trouble would be brought upon you, Mrs. Cross, so I came immediately to bring you word of it, that you might be pre∣pared for it, and might not be surprized: but I see they have been too nimble for me, so that I know not what to advise: the poor woman, it seems, is turned out of doors into the street; and another of the neighbour's there told me, that when they took her children from her, she swooned away, and when they recovered her out of that, she run distracted, and is put into a mad-house by the parish; for there is no-body else to take any care of her.”</Q></P>
<P>This was all said by this good, kind, poor creature; for though her design was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not one word of it true in fact; for I was not turned out
<PB N="22" REF="36"/>
of doors by the landlord, nor gone distracted: it was true, indeed, that at parting with my poor children, I fainted, and was like one mad when I came to myself and found they were gone; but I remained in the house a good while after that; as you shall hear.</P>
<P>While the poor woman was telling this dismal story, in came Mr. Cross, the husband, and though her heart was hardened against all pity, who was really and nearly related to the children, for they were the children of her own brother; yet the good man was quite softened with the dis∣mal relation of the circumstances of the family; and when the poor woman had finished, he said to his wife, <Q>“This is a dismal case, my dear, in∣deed,' and something must be done</Q> His wife fell a raving at him, 'What,' says she, <Q>“do you want to have four children to keep? Have we not children of our own? would you have these brats come and eat up my children's bread? no, no, let them go to the parish, and let that take care of them, I will take care of my own.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Come, come, my dear,' says the husband, charity is a duty to the poor, and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord; let us lend our Heavenly Father a little of our childrens bread, as you call it, it will be the best security that our children shall never come to want charity, or be turned out of doors, as these poor innocent creatures are.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Don't tell me of security,' says the wife; it is a good security for our children to keep what we have together, and provide for them: it is time enough to help to keep other folks children; charity begins at home.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="23" REF="37"/>
“Well, well, my dear,' says he again, 'I only talk of putting out a little money to interest; our Maker is a good borrower, never fear making a bad debt there child; I will be be bound for it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Don't banter me with your charity, and your allegories,' says the wife angrily;' I tell you they are my relations, not yours, and they shall not rooft here, they shall go to the parish.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“All your relations are my relations now,' says the good Gentleman very calmly, 'and I will not see your relations in distress and not pity them, any more than I would my own; indeed, my dear, they shall not go to the parish. I assure you none of my wife's relations shall come to the parish, if I can help it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“What, will you take four children to keep?” says the wife.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“No, no, my dear,' says he; 'there is your sister, I will go and talk with her, and your uncle, I will send for him and the rest; I'll warrant you when we are all together we will find ways and means to keep four poor little children from beggary and starving, or else it will be very hard; we are none of us in so bad circumstances but we are able to spare a mite for the fatherless; don't shut up your bowels of compassion against your own flesh and blood: could you hear these innocent children cry at your door for hunger, and give them no bread?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Prythee what need they cry at our door,' says she; 'it is the business of the parish to provide for them: they shall not cry at our door, if they do,' I will give them nothing. 'Won't you,' says he, 'but I will; remember that dreadful scripture is directly against us, Prov. xxi. 13. Whoso
<PB N="24" REF="38"/>
stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, well,' says she, 'you must do what you will, because you pretend to be master; but if I had my will, I would send them where they ought to be sent, I would send them from whence they came.</Q></P>
<P>Then the poor woman put in, and said, <Q>“But, Madam, that is sending them to starve in∣deed; for the parish has no obligation to take care of them, and so they would lie and pe∣rish” in the street.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Or be sent back again,' says the husband, to our parish in a cripple-cart, by the Justice's warrant, and so expose us, and all the rela∣tions, to the last degree, among our neigh∣bours, and among those who knew the good old gentleman their grandfather, who lived and flourished in this parish so many years, and was so well-beloved among all people, and de∣served” it so well.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I don't value that one farthing, not I,” says the wife;</Q> 'I'll keep none of them.'</P>
<P><Q>“Well, my dear,' says her husband, 'but I value it, for I won't have such a blot lie upon the family, and upon your children. He was a worthy good man, and his name is respected among all his neighbours; it will be a re∣proach to you as his daughter, and to our chil∣dren, that are his grand-children, that we should let your brother's children perish, or come to be a charge to the publick, in the very place where your family once flourished: come, say no more, my dear, I'll see what” can be done.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="39"/>
Upon this he sends and gathers all the rela∣tions together at a tavern hard-by, and sent for the four little children, that they might see them; and they all, at first word, agreed to have them taken care of; and because his wife was so fu∣rious that she would not suffer one of them to be kept at home, they agreed to keep them all together for a while; so they committed them to the poor woman that had managed the af∣fair for them, and entered into obligations to one another to supply the needful sums for their maintenance; and not to have one separated from the rest, they sent for the youngest from the parish where it was taken in, and had them all brought up together.</P>
<P>It would take up too long a part of this story to give a particular account with what a chari∣table tenderness this good person, who was but uncle-in-law to them, managed that affair; how careful he was of them; went constantly to see them, and to see that they were well provided for, cloathed, put to School, and at last put out in the world for their advantage; but it is enough to say he acted more like a father to them, than an uncle-in-law, though all along much against his wife's consent, who was of a disposition not so tender and compassionate as her husband.</P>
<P>You may believe I heard this with the same pleasure which I now feel at the relating it again; for I was terribly frighted at the apprehensions of my children being brought to misery and dis∣tress, as those must be who have no friends, but are left to parish benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>An incident far from being unnatural.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Was now, however, entring on a new scene of life; I had a great house upon my hands, and some furniture left in it, but I was no more able to maintain myself and Amy in it, than I was my five children; nor had I any thing to subsist with, but what I might get by working, and that was not a town where much work was to be had.</P>
<P>My landlord had been very kind indeed, af∣ter he came to know my circumstances, and that I was left with five children; though before he was acquainted with that part, he had gone so far as to seize my goods, and to carry some of them off too.</P>
<P>And here it will not be improper to look back a little, to relate the fact that brought about this unexpected, and important, affair.</P>
<P>One morning, as i was surrounded by my chil∣dren in the parlour, in the greatest affliction, and in tears, having before sent out Amy with a small silver spoon to procure us a meal; I dis∣covered a man, of a genteel appearance, enter the room, and immediately I recollected him to be my landlord.</P>
<P><Q>“Do not be surprised, Mrs. Bacon,' said he, I am not come to ask you for any rent; but, pray, tell me, what is the matter with you,” that you seem thus afflicted?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Dear Sir, I should have imagined you to be the last person in the world to ask me the question; for, give me leave to say, it is chiefly
<PB N="27" REF="41"/>
owing to your severity, that I am, at present,” under this affliction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Owing to me! Mrs. Bacon; pray in what” manner?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Oh! Sir, your steward or agent, in your name, long ago, seized my goods for the rent, which has occasioned my being in the condi∣tion” you at present behold me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I assure you Mrs. Bacon, upon my honour, I am a stranger to what you have mentioned; 'tis true my general orders are to let none of my tenants run above a year, or a year and a half at most; but as to your particu∣lar case I was intirely ignorant; and now I am acquainted with it, it indeed disturbs me” much.</Q></P>
<P>After a long conversation of enquiries on his part, with the answers on mine, he rose from his seat, and coming to me, he put two gui∣neas into my hand, gave me a kiss, said he would see me again, and was preparing to leave me.</P>
<P><Q>“Oh! Sir, your kindness overcomes me; may you, for this single action, meet with every blessing you can wish in this life, and” everlasting happiness in the life to come.</Q></P>
<P>As I was attending him to the door, Amy returned with something in her hand for dinner: he took no notice of her, but bowed to me, and went away.</P>
<P>When I came in, I told Amy the whole of his discourse, and what he had given me. She instantly fell on her knees, with thanks to hea∣ven for the donor, it being a great relief to us; for we had drank nothing but water for many weeks before.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="42"/>
The next day he sent me my goods again, and in about a week after he came himself. Upon my making acknowledgments for his re∣turning my things, he stopt me, and kissed me twice, or thrice; which had such an effect upon my spirits, that I felt the warmth and glow of it upon my cheeks, for several minutes after.</P>
<P>At length he took a chair and sat down by me; but, as our conversation, while he stayed, is of little importance to my readers, I shall, for that reason, omit it, and acquaint them only, that he left me, as he did before, in better circumstances than he sound me.</P>
<P>Mr. Dazzle, for that was my Landlord's name, had not only several estates, but was a dealer in jewels. I had now lived three quarters of a year in his house after the seizure of my goods, and had paid him no rent, and, which was worse, if he had desired it, I was in no condition to pay him any. However, I observed, now, he came oftener to see me; his looks were the looks of affection, and his words were the words of friendship; particularly the last two or three times which he came, and the last time of all he was kinder still, for he told me he came to dine with me, and that I should give him leave to treat me, and asked me where my children were: upon which I informed him, as the reader has been already acquainted. He then called Amy, and sent her out to buy a joint of meat: he told her what she should buy, but naming two or three things, either of which she might take. The maid, a cunning wench, and faithful to me, as the skin to my back, did not buy any thing out-right, but brought the butcher along with her, with both the things that she had chosen,
<PB N="29" REF="43"/>
for him to please himself; the one was a loin of veal; the other a piece of roasting beef. He looked at them, and paid the butcher what they came to, and bade me take them both; the beef, he said, would serve another time.</P>
<P>I was surprised, you may be sure, at the bounty of a man that had before been my terror, and had taken the goods out of my house; but I considered that my distresses had mollified his temper, and that he had afterwards been so com∣passionate as to give me leave to live rent-free in the house a whole year.</P>
<P>But now he put on the face, not of a man of compassion only, but of a man of friendship and kindness, and this was so unexpected, that it surprised me: we discoursed together, and were, as I may call it, chearful, which was more than I could say I had been for three years before.</P>
<P>Here he desired me to give him leave to send for some wine; and when Amy was come with it, he bid her fill a glass to him, and with the glass in his hand, he came to me, and kissed me, which I was not now surprised at, but I was at what followed; for he told me, That as the sad condition which I was reduced to, had made him pity me, so my conduct in it, and the courage I bore it with, had given him a more than ordinary respect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my good; that he was resolved for the present to do something to relieve me, and to employ his thoughts in the mean time, to see if he could, for the future, put me into a way to support myself.</P>
<P>While he found me change colour, and look surprised at his discourse, for so I did to be sure,
<PB N="30" REF="44" MS="y"/>
he turns to Amy, and looking at her, he says to me; <Q>“I say all this Mrs. Bacon before your maid, because both she and you shall know that I have no ill design, and that I have, in mere kindness, resolved to do something for you, if I can; and as I have been a witness of the un∣common honesty and fidelity of Amy here, to you in all your distresses, I know she may be trusted with so honest a design as mine is; for I assure you I bear a proportioned regard to your maid too, for her affection to you.”</Q></P>
<P>Amy made him a curtsey, and the poor girl looked so confounded with joy, that she could not speak; but her colour came-and went, and every now and then she blushed, as red as scarlet, and the next minute looked as pale as death. Well, having said this, he sat down, made me sit down, and then drank to me, and made me drink two glasses of wine together; 'For,' says he, <Q>“you have need of it:” and so indeed I had.</Q> When he had done so, 'Come, Amy,' says he, with “your mistress's leave, you shall have a glass too:” so he made her drink two glasses also, and then rising up; 'And now, Amy,' says he, 'go and 'get dinner,' and in the mean time, he said, he would walk in the garden.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Amy looked as pleased as ever she did in her life. 'Dear Madam!' says she, what does this Gentleman mean?'</P>
<P><Q>“Nay, Amy,' says I, 'he means to do us good, you see, don't he? I know no other meaning he can have, for he can get nothing by me.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I warrant you, Madam,' says she, 'he'll ask you a favour bye-and-by.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“No, no, you are mistaken, Amy, I dare say,”</Q> said I; 'you heard what he said, did not you?'</P>
<P><Q><PB N="31" REF="45"/>
“Ay,' says Amy, it is no matter for that, you shall see what he will do after dinner.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, well, Amy,' says I, 'you have hard thoughts of him, I cannot be of your opinion; I don't see any thing in him yet that looks like it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As to that, Madam,' says Amy, 'I don't see any thing of it yet neither; but what should move a Gentleman to take pity of you as he does?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay,' says I, 'that is a hard thing too, that we should judge a man to be wicked because he is charitable; and vicious because he is kind.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“O Madam,' says Amy, 'there is abundance of charity begins in that vice, and he is not so unac∣quainted with things, as not to know, that poverty is the strongest incentive; a temptation, against which no virtue is powerful enough to stand out; he knows your condition as well as you do.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, and what then, Amy?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, then he knows too you are young and handsome, and he has the surest bait in the world, to take you with.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, Amy,' said I, 'but he may find him∣self mistaken, in such a thing as that.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, Madam,' says Amy, I hope you will not deny him, if he should offer it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“What do you mean, hussy,' said I? No, I would starve first.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I hope not, Madam, I hope you would be wiser; I am sure if he will set you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will starve if you do not consent, that is certain.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“What, consent to lie with him for bread?” Amy,' says I; 'how can you talk so?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay, Madam,' says Amy, 'I don't think you would for any thing else; it would not be lawful for any thing else, but for bread, Madam;
<PB N="32" REF="46"/>
why nobody can starve, there is no bearing that, I am sure.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Ay,' says I, 'but if he would give me an estate to live on, he should not lie with me, I assure you.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why look you, Madam, if he would but give you enough to live easy upon, he should lye with me for it with all my heart.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That is a token, Amy, of inimitable kindness to me,' said I, 'and I know how to value it; but there is more friendship than honesty in it, Amy.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“O Madam,' says Amy, 'I would do any any thing to get you out of this sad condition; as to honesty, I think honesty is out of the ques∣tion, when starving is the case; are not we al∣most” starved to death?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I am indeed,' said I, 'and thou art for my” sake; but to be a Jilt, Amy!' and there I stopped.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Dear Madam,' says Amy, 'if I will starve for your sake, I will be that, or any thing, for your sake; why I would die for you, if I were put to it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why that is an excess of affection, Amy,'</Q> said I, <Q>“I never met with before; I wish I may be ever in a condition to make you some re∣turns suitable: but, however, Amy, you shall not be such to him, to oblige him to be kind to me: no, Amy, nor I won't be a prostitute to him if he would give me much more than he is able to give me, or do for me.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, Madam,' says Amy, 'I don't say I will go and ask him; but I say, if he should promise to do so and so for you, and the condi∣tion was such, that he would not serve you un∣less
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>
I would let him lie with me, he should lie with me as often as he would, rather than you should not have his assistance; but this is but talk, Madam, I don't see any need of such dis∣course, and you are of opinion that there will be” no need of it too.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Indeed, so I am, Amy; but,' said I, 'if there was, I tell you again, I would rather die before I would consent; or before you should consent for my sake.”</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto I had not only preserved the virtue it∣self, but the virtuous inclination and resolution; and had I kept myself there, I had been happy, though I had perished of meer hunger; for, with∣out question, a woman ought rather to die, than to prostitute her virtue and honour, let the tempta∣tion be what he will.</P>
<P>But to return to my story: he walked about the garden; which was, indeed, all in disorder, and over-run with weeds, because I had not been able to hire a gardener to do any thing to it, no not so much as to dig up ground enough to sow a few turnips and carrots for family use. After he had viewed it, he came in, and sent Amy to fetch a poor man, a gardener, that used to help our man-servant, and carried him into the garden, and told him to do several things in it, to put it into a little order; and this took him up near an hour.</P>
<P>By this time, I had dressed me, as well as I could; for though my things were indifferent, I was tight and clean, and in better plight than he had seen me in a great while, and he looked ex∣tremely pleased to see me so; for he said, I looked so disconsolate, and so afflicted before, that it
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
grieved him to see me; and he bade me pluck up a good heart, for he hoped to put me in a condi∣tion to live in the world, and be beholden to no∣body.</P>
<P>I told him that was impossible, for I must be beholden to him for it, for all the friends I had in the world would not, or could nor, do so much for me as that he spoke of. 'Well, Widow,' says he; (for so he called me, and so indeed I was in the worst sense that desolate word could be used in) 'if you are beholden to me, you shall 'be beholden to nobody else.'</P>
<P>By this time dinner was near ready, and Amy came in to lay the cloth, with an apology for the want of necessaries to entertain him. However, he knew how things were, and bade me make no scruple about bringing out what I had; he hoped to see me in a better plight; he did not come, he said, to be entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me: thus he went on, speaking so chearfully to me, and such chearful things, that it was a cordial to my very soul, to hear him speak.</P>
<P>Here we went to dinner, and I am sure I had not eat so good a meal hardly in a twelvemonth, at least, not of such a joint of meat as the loin of veal was. I eat indeed very heartily, and so did he, and he made me drink three or four glasses of wine, so that, in short, my spirits were lifted up to a degree I had not been used to, and I was not only chearful, but merry, and so he pressed me to be.</P>
<P>I told him, I had a great deal of reason to be merry, seeing he had been so kind to me, and had given me hopes of recovering me from the worst circumstances that ever woman of any sort of
<PB N="35" REF="49"/>
fortune was sunk into; that he could not but believe that what he had said to me, was like life from the dead; that it was like recovering one sick from the brink of the grave. How I should ever make him a return any way suitable, was what I had not yet had time to think of; I could only say, that I should never forget it while I had life, and should be always ready to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>He said, that was all he desired of me; that his reward would be, the satisfaction of having rescued me from misery; that he found he was obliging one that knew what gratitude meant; that he would make it his business to make me com∣pleatly easy, first or last, if it lay in his power; and in the mean time, he bade me consider of any thing that I thought he might do for me, for my advantage, and in order to make me per∣fectly easy.</P>
<P>After we had talked thus, he bade me be chear∣ful: 'Come,' says he, 'lay aside these melan|'choly things, and let us be merry.' Amy waited at the table; and she smiled, and laughed, and was so joyous she could hardly contain it, for the girl loved me to such excess, hardly to be described; and it was such an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her mistress, that the wench was beside herself almost; and after dinner was over, Amy went up-stairs, and dressed herself too in the best she had.</P>
<P>We sat together talking of a thousand things, of what had been, and what was to be, all the rest of the day; and in the evening he took his leave of me, with many expressions of kind∣ness and tenderness, and true affection to me, but offered not the least of what Amy had suggested.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="50"/>
At his going away, he took me in his arms; protested an honest kindness to me; said several kind things, which I cannot now recollect, and after kissing me, put a guinea into my hand; which, he said, was for my present supply, and told me, that he would see me again, before it was out; also he gave Amy half-a-crown.</P>
<P>When he was gone; <Q>“Well, Amy,' said I, are you convinced now he is an honest as well as a true friend, and that there has been nothing, not the least appearance of any thing of what” you imagined, in his behaviour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Yes,' says Amy, 'I am; but I admire at it; he is such a friend as the world, sure, has not abundance of to show.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I am sure,' says I, 'he is such a friend as I have long wanted, and as I have as much need” of as any creature in the world has, or ever had.'</Q> And, in short, I was so overcome with the com∣fort of it, that I sat down and cried for joy a good while, as I had formerly cried for sorrow.</P>
<P>We heard no more of him for two days, but the third day he came again; then he told me, with the same kindness, that he had ordered me a supply of houshold goods for the furnishing the house. <Q>“And now,' says he, 'I will tell you what I have in my head for you, for your pre∣sent supply; and that is, that the house, being well furnished, you shall let out in lodgings, by which you will get a comfortable subsistence, es∣pecially seeing you shall pay me no rent for two years, nor after neither, unless you can afford it.”</Q></P>
<P>This was the first view I had of living comfort∣ably indeed, and it was a very probable way, I must confess: seeing we had very good conveni∣encies, six rooms on a floor, and three stories
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
high. While he was laying down a scheme of my management, came a cart to the door with a load of goods, and an upholsterer's man to put them up; with two fine cabinets, and some pier∣glasses, and several other valuable things.</P>
<P>He told me, he gave them me freely, as a sa∣tisfaction for the cruelty he had used me with before; and the furniture of one room being finished, and set up, he told me, he would fur∣nish one chamber for himself, and would come and be one of my lodgers, if I would give him leave.</P>
<P>I told him, he ought not to ask me leave, who had so much right to make himself welcome. So the house began to look in some tolerable figure, and clean; the garden also, in about a fortnight's work, began to look something less like a wilder∣ness than it used to do; and he ordered me to put up a bill for letting rooms, reserving one for him∣self, to come as he saw oocasion.</P>
<P>When all was done to his mind, as to placing the goods, he seemed very well pleased, and we dined together again of his own providing. After dinner he took me by the hand; <Q>“Come now, Mrs. Bacon,' says he, 'you must show me” your house:'</Q> for he had a mind to see every thing over again.</P>
<P><Q>“No, Sir,' says I, 'but I will go show you your house, if you please.”</Q></P>
<P>So we went up through all the rooms, and in the room which was appointed for himself, Amy was doing something.</P>
<P><Q>“Well, Amy,' says he, 'I intend to lie with you to-morrow night.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“To-night, if you please, Sir,' says Amy very innocently; 'your room is quite ready.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, Amy,' says he, 'I am glad you are so willing.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="38" REF="52"/>
“No,' says Amy, 'I mean your chamber is ready” to-night.'</Q> And away she run out of the room ashamed enough; for the girl meant no harm, whatever she had said to me in private.</P>
<P>However, he said no more then; but when Amy was gone, he walked about the room, and looked at every thing, and taking me by the hand; he kissed me, and spoke a great many kind, affec∣tionate things to me indeed; as of his measures for my advantage, and what he would do to raise me again in the world; told me, that my afflic∣tions, and the conduct I had shewn in bearing them to such an extremity, had so engaged him to me, that he valued me infinitely above all the women in the world; that though he was under such engagements that he could not marry me, [his wife and he had been parted, for some rea∣sons, which make too long a story to intermix with mine] yet that he would do every thing else that a woman could ask in a husband, and with that he kissed me again, and took me in his arms, but offered not the least uncivil action to me, and told me, he hoped I would not deny him all the favours he should ask, because he resolved to ask nothing of me but what it was fit for a woman of vertue and modesty, for such he knew me to be, to grant.</P>
<P>I confess, the terrible pressure of my former mi∣sery, the memory of which lay heavy upon my min, and the surprizing kindness with which he had delivered me, and withal, the expecta∣tion of what he might still do for me, were pow∣erful things, and made me have scarce the power to deny him any thing he would ask. However, I told him thus, with an air of tenderness too;
<PB N="39" REF="53"/>
that he had done so much for me, that I thought I ought to deny him nothing: only I hoped, and depended upon him, that he would not take the advantage of the infinite obligations I was under to him, to desire any thing of me, the yielding to which would lay me lower in his esteem than I desired to be; that as I took him to be a man of honour, so I knew he could not like me the better for doing any thing that was below a woman of honour and honesty to do.</P>
<P>He told me, that he had done all this for me, without so much as telling me what kindness or real affection he had for me; that I might not be under any necessity of yielding to him in any thing, for want of bread; and he would no more oppress my gratitude now, than he would my necessity before, nor ask any thing, supposing he would stop his favours, or withdraw his kind∣ness, if he was denied. It was true, he said, he might tell me more freely his mind now, than before, seeing I had let him know that I accepted his assistance, and saw that he was sincere in his design of serving me; that he had gone thus far to shew me that he was only kind to me; but that now he would tell me, that he loved me, and yet would demonstrate that his love was both ho∣nourable, and that what he should desire, was what he might honestly ask, and I might honest∣ly grant.</P>
<P>I answered, that within those two limitations, I was sure I ought to deny him nothing, and I should think myself not ungrateful only, but very unjust, if I should: so he said no more, but I ob∣served he kissed me more, and took me in his arms in a more familiar way, more than usual,
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
and which put me in mind of my maid Amy's words; and yet, I must acknowledge, I was so overcome with his goodness to me in these many kind things he had done, that I not only was easy at his kissing me, and made no ressistance, but was inclined to do the like myself, though I did not. But he went no farther than what I have said, nor did he offer so much as to sit-down on the bed-side with me, but took his leave, said he loved me tenderly, and would convince me of it by such demonstrations as should be to my satisfaction. I told him, I had a great deal of reason to believe him; that he was full mas∣ter of the whole house, and of me, as far as was within the bounds we had spoken of, which I believed he would not break; and asked him if he would not please to lodge there that night.</P>
<P>He said, he could not well stay that night, bu∣siness requiring him in London; but added, smiling, that he would come the next day, and take a night's lodging with me. I pressed him to stay that night, and told him, I should be glad a friend so valuable should be under the same roof with me; and, indeed, I began at that time not only to be much obliged to him, but to love him too, and that in a manner that I had not been ac∣quainted with myself.</P>
<P>Oh! let not any of my sex cast a reflection on a woman left destitute, with five children, but consider her generously delivered from trouble; and that she, in return, was furnished with prin∣ciples of gratitude, to an amiable man.</P>
<P>This Gentleman had freely and voluntarily de∣livered me from misery, from poverty, and distress; he had made me what I was, and put me into a way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to
<PB N="41" REF="55"/>
live happy and pleased, and on his bounty I de∣pended: what could I say to this worthy man when he pressed me to yield to him, and argued the lawfulness of it? But of that in its place.</P>
<P>I pressed him again to stay that night, and told him it was the first compleatly happy night that I had ever had in the house in my life, and I should be very sorry to have it be without his company, who was the cause and foundation of it all; that we would be innocently merry, but that it never could be without him; and, in short, I courted him so, that he said he could not deny me, but he would take his horse, and go to Lon∣don, do the business he had to do, and that he would come back in three hours at farthest, and sup with me, but bade me get nothing there, for since I was resolved to be merry, which was what he desired above all things, he would send me something from London. 'And we will make a wedding-supper of it, my dear,' says he; and with that word, took me in his arms, and kissed me so vehemently, that I made no question but he intended to do every thing else that Amy had talked of.</P>
<P>I started a little at the word Wedding. <Q>“What do you mean, Sir, to call it by such a name!</Q> says I; adding, <Q>“We will have a supper, but the other is impossible, as well on your side as mine. He laughed: 'Well,' says he, 'you shall call it what you will, but it may be the same thing, for I shall satisfy you, it is not so” impossible as you make it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I don't understand you, Sir, said I; have” not I husband, and you a wife?</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="42" REF="56"/>
“Well, well,' says he, 'we will talk of that” after supper:</Q> so he rose up, gave me another kiss, and took his horse for London.</P>
<P>This kind of discourse had fired my blood, I confess, and I knew not what to think of it. It was plain now that he intended to lie with me, if I would let him; but how he could reconcile it to a legal thing, like a marriage, that I could not imagine. We had both of us used Amy with so much intimacy, and trusted her with every thing, having such unexampled instances of her fidelity, that he made no scruple to kiss me, and say all these things to me before her; so that when he was gone: 'Well, Amy,' says I, <Q>“what will all this come to now? I am all in a sweat” at him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Come to, Madam, says Amy, 'I see what it will come to plain enough, I must put you to bed to-night together; for has he not told you his wife has left him, so that her office is be∣come vacant, and I can see he is so struck with your beauty, that he solicits you to supply and fill this vacancy; by which means, both you and your children, will be in a plentiful manner provided for; therefore, I say, I must put you to bed to-night together.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why you would not be so impudent, you Jade you,' says I, 'would you?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Yes, I would, says she, 'with all my heart, and think you both as honest as ever you were in your lives.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“What ails the slut to talk so? said I; 'ho∣nest!” how can it be honest?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, I will tell you, Madam,' says Amy; I sounded it as soon as I heard him speak, and it is very true too. He calls you widow, and
<PB N="43" REF="57"/>
such, indeed, you are; for as my master has left you so many years, he is dead to be sure; at least, he is dead to you. He is no husband, you are, and ought to be free to marry who you will; and his wife being gone from him, and re∣fuses to lie with him, then he is a single man again, as much as ever; and though you cannot bring the laws of the land to join you together, yet one refusing to do the office of a wife, and the other of a husband, you may certainly take” one another fairly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay, Amy,' says I; 'if I could take him fairly, you may be sure I would take him before all the men in the world; it turned the very heart within me, when I heard him say he loved me: how could it do otherwise? when you know what a condition I was in before; de∣spised, and trampled on by all the world; I could have took him in my arms, and kissed him as freely as he did me, if it had not been” for shame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Ay, and all the rest too,' says Amy, 'at the first word. I don't see how you can think of denying him any thing; has he not brought you out of the Devil's clutches; brought you out of the blackest misery that ever poor lady was reduced to? can a woman deny such a man” any thing?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay, I don't know what to do, Amy,' says I; I hope he won't desire any thing of that kind of me, I hope he will not attempt it; if he does, I” know not what to say to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Not ask you!' says Amy, 'depend upon it, he will ask you, and you will grant it too; I am sure my mistress is no fool: come, pray
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>
Madam, let me go air you a clean shift; don't let him find you in foul linnen the wed∣ding-night.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But that I know you to be a very honest girl, Amy,' says I, 'you would make me abbor you; why, you argue for the Devil, as if you” were one of his privy-counsellors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is no matter for that, Madam, I say no∣thing but what I think. You own you love this Gentleman, and he has given you sufficient testi∣mony of his affection to you. Your conditions are alike unhappy, and he is of opinion that he he may take another woman, his wife having broke her honour, and living from him, and that, though the laws of the land will not allow him to marry, yet he may take another woman into his arms, provided he keeps true to that o∣ther woman as a wife; nay, he says it is usual to do so, and allowed by the custom of the place, in several countries abroad; and I must own, I am of the same mind; else it is in the power of a wife, after she has jilted and abandoned her husband, to confine him from the pleasure as well as convenience of a woman all the days of his life, which would be very unreasonable; and as times go, not tolerable to all people and the” like on your side, Madam.</Q></P>
<P>Had I now had my senses about me, and had my reason not been overcome by the powerful attraction of so kind, so beneficent a friend; had I consulted conscience and virtue, I should have repelled this Amy, however faithful and honest to me in other things, as a viper, and engine of the Devil; I ought to have remembered that neither he, or I, either by the laws of God or man,
<PB N="45" REF="59"/>
could come together, upon any other terms than that of adultery: the ignorant jade's argument, That he had brought me out of the hands of the devil, by which she meant the devil of po∣verty and distress, should have been a powerful motive to me, not to plunge myself into the jaws of hell, and into the power of the real de∣vil, in recompence for that deliverance; I should have looked upon all the good this man had done for me, to have been the particular work of the goodness of heaven; and that good∣ness should have moved me to return of duty and humble obedience; I should have received the mercy thankfully, and applied it soberly to the praise and honour of my Maker; whereas by this wicked course, all the bounty and kindness of this Gentleman became a snare to me, was a meer bait to the devil's hook; I received his kindness at the dear expence of body and soul, mortgaging faith, religion, conscience, and mo∣desty, for, as I may call it, a morsel of bread; or, if you will, ruined my soul from a princi∣ple of gratitude, and gave myself up to the devil, to shew myself grateful to my benefactor: I must do the Gentleman that justice, as to say, I verily believe that he designed nothing but what was lawful; and I must do that justice upon myself, as to say, that if I consented, I should do, what my own conscience convinced me at the very time I did it, was horribly un∣lawful, scandalous, and abominable.</P>
<P>But poverty was my snare; dreadful poverty! The misery I had been in, was great, such as would make the heart tremble at the apprehensions of its return; and I might appeal to any that has had any experience of the world, whether one
<PB N="46" REF="60"/>
so entirely destitute as I was, of all manner of all helps, or Friends, either to support me, or to assist me to support myself, could withstand the proposal; not that I plead this as a justi∣fication of my conduct, but that it may move the pity, even of those that abhor the crime.</P>
<P>Besides this, I was young, handsome, and with all the mortifications I had met with, was in full health; and as it was a new thing, so it was a pleasant thing to be courted, caressed, em∣braced, and high professions of affection made to me by a man so agreeable, and so able to do me good.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if I had ventured to dis∣oblige him, I had no friend in the world to have recourse to; I had no prospect, no, not of a bit of bread; I had nothing before me, but to fall back into the same misery that I had been so lately relieved from.</P>
<P>Amy had but too much thetorick in this cause; she represented all those things in their proper colours; she argued them all with her utmost skill, and at last, the merry jade, when she came to dress me, <Q>“Look ye, Madam,' said she, 'if you won't consent, tell him you'll do as Ra∣chel did to Jacob, when she could have no children, put her maid to bed to him; tell him you cannot comply with him, but there's Amy, he may ask her the question, she has” promised me she will not deny you.</Q></P>
<P>'And wou'd you have me say so, Amy?' said I.</P>
<P><Q>“No, Madam, but I would really have you do so: besides, you are undone if you do not; and if my doing it would save you from be∣ing undone, as I said before, he shall if he
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>
will; if he asks me, I won't deny him, not” I, hang me if I do,' says Amy.</Q></P>
<P>'Oh! Amy, I know not what to do.'</P>
<P><Q>“Do!' says Amy, 'your choice is fair and plain. Here you may have a handsome, charm∣ing Gentleman, be rich, live pleasantly, and in plenty; or refuse him, and want a dinner, go in rags, live in tears; in short, beg and starve; you know this is the case, Madam; I wonder how you can say you know not what to do.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Amy,' says I, 'the case is as you say; and 'I think verily—but then,' said I, moved by conscience, 'don't talk any more of your cant, of its being lawful that I ought to marry again, and that he ought to marry again, and such stuff as that; it is all nonsense,' says I, 'Amy, there is nothing in it, let me hear no more of that; for if I should yield to him, 'tis in vain to mince the matter, shall I not be a prostitute? and shall I not be reflected upon, not only by my own sex, but despised and contemned by the other?”</Q></P>
<P>'I don't think so, Madam, by no means,' says Amy, 'I wonder how you can talk so;' and then she run on with her argument of the unreasonableness that a woman should be obliged to live single, or a man to live single in such cases, as before: <Q>“Well, Amy,' said I, 'come, let us dispute no more, for the longer I enter into that part, the greater my scruples will be; but if I let it alone, the necessity of my pre∣sent circumstances is such, that I believe—I know not what I believe—but I should be glad he would not importune me, and press me to yield, but leave me as I am,”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="62"/>
As to that, Madam, you may depend,' says Amy, <Q>“he expects to have you for his bed∣fellow to-night; I saw it plainly in his ma∣nagement all day, and at last he told you so too, as plain, I think, as he could.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Amy, said, I, 'I do not know what to say—I do not know what to think—and, yet, I do not well know how to resist such a man, that has done me so much, and has said so many kind and affectionate things to me.”</Q></P>
<P>'I do not know how you should, Madam,' says Amy.</P>
<P>Thus Amy and I canvassed the business be∣tween us; the jade prompted the crime, which, I am afraid, I had but too much inclination to commit; that is to say, not as a crime, for I had nothing of the vice in my constitution; but the kindness and good-humour of the man, and the dread of my own circumstances con∣curred to bring me to that which no woman, who has the least pretension to virtue, should ever think of parting from.</P>
<P>About two hours after he was gone, came a porter on horseback, with a basket, with an order to get supper ready by nine o'clock, which I prepared accordingly; and he gave me time enough, for he came before seven, so that Amy got every thing ready in time.</P>
<P>We sat down to supper about nine, and were indeed very merry. Amy made us some sport, for she was a girl of spirit and wit; and with her talk she made us laugh very often, and yet the jade managed her wit with all the good-manners imaginable.</P>
<P>After supper, he took me up into his chamber, where Amy had made a good fire, and there he
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
pulled out a great many papers, and spread them upon a little table, and then took me by the hand, and after kissing me, he entered into a discourse of his circumstances, and of mine, how they agreed in several things exactly; for ex∣ample, that I was abandoned of a husband in the prime of my youth and vigour, and he of a wife in his middle-age; how the end of mar∣riage was destroyed by the treatment we had ei∣ther of us received; and it would be very hard that we should be tied by the formality of the contract, where the essence of it was destroyed.</P>
<P>I interrupted him, and told him, There was a vast difference between our circumstances, and that in the most essential part; namely, that he was rich, and I was poor; that he was above the world, and I infinitely below it; that his circumstances were very easy, mine miserable, and this was an inequality the most essential that could be imagined.</P>
<P><Q>“As to that, my Dear,' says he, 'I have taken such measures as shall make an equa∣lity” still;'</Q> and with that, he shewed me a con∣tract in writing, wherein he engaged himself to me; to cohabit constantly with me; to provide for me in all respects as a wife, and to keep and provide for my children; and repeating, in the preamble, a long account of the nature and reason of our living together, and an obligation in the penalty of seven thousand pounds never to abandon me; and at last, shewed me a bond for five hundred pounds, to be paid to me, or to my assigns, within three months after his de∣cease, with one hundred pounds, also, for each of my children.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="64"/>
He read over all these things to me, and then in a most moving, affectionate manner, and in words not to be answered, he said, <Q>“Now, my dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object any thing against it? if not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this” matter no longer;</Q> with that he pulled out a purse which had threescore guineas in it, and threw them into my lap, and concluded all the rest of his discourse with kisses, and protestations of his love; of which, indeed, I had abundant proof.</P>
<P>Pity human frailty, you that read of a woman reduced in her youth and prime to the utmost misery and distress; and raised again, as above, by the unexpected and surprising bounty of a stranger; I say pity her, if she was not able, after all these things, to make any more re∣sistance.</P>
<P>However, I stood out still. I asked him, how he could expect that I could come into a proposal of such consequence, the very first time it was moved to me? and that I ought, if ever I consented to it, to capitulate with him, that he should never upbraid me with easiness, and consenting too soon: he said, no; but on the contrary, he would take it as a mark of the greatest kindness I could show him; then he went on to give reasons why there was no occasion to use the ordinary ceremony of delay; or to wait a reasonable time of courtship, which was only to avoid scandal; but, as this was pri∣vate, it had nothing of that nature in it; that he had been courting me some time, by the best of courtship, viz. doing acts of kindness to me; and that he had given testimonies of his
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
sincere affection to me, by deeds, not by flat∣tering trifles, and the usual courtship of words, which were often found to have very little mean∣ing; that he took me, not as a mistress, but, as his wife; and that he would not only be a husband to me, but a father to my children; and protested, it was clear to him he might law∣fully do it, and that I was perfectly at liberty; and assured me by all that it was possible for an honest man to say, that he would treat me as his wife as long as he lived; he protested he loved me above all the world, and begged I would for once believe him; that he had never de∣ceived me, and never would, but would make it his study to make my life comfortable and happy, and to make me forget the misery I had gone through.</P>
<P>I stood still a while, and did not speak, for he now had almost conquered the resistance I intended to make, but seeing him eager for my answer, I smiled, and, looking up at him; <Q>“And must I then,' says I, 'say yes at first asking? Must I depend upon your promise?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“By every thing that's sacred you may; and if I thought,' said he, 'I should ever prove false, lovely and beautiful as you are, I here declare by all my hopes, both here and here∣after, I would instantly desist my purpose, and urge no longer to possess those charms, but de∣prive myself of that blessing which I now so earnestly solicit, and have so often, and do at this instant, promise and vow to fulfil.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why then,' said I, upon the faith of that promise, and in the sense of that inexpressible kindness you have shewn me, you shall be obliged, and I will be wholly yours to the
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
”end of my life;'</Q> and with that I took him, with both my hands, and gave him the first kiss, which, from me, he had ever received.</P>
<P>And thus in gratitude for the favours I re∣ceived from a man, was all sense of religion and duty to God, all regard to virtue and honour, given up at once, and we were to call one ano∣ther man and wife, who, in the sense of the laws, both of God and our country, were no less than two adulterers; nor, as I have said above, was my conscience silent in it, though, it seems, his was; for I sinned with open eyes, and thereby had a double guilt upon me; as I always said his notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the opinion, or argued him∣self into it now, that we were both free, and might lawfully marry.</P>
<P>But I was quite of another opinion, nay, and my judgment was right, but my circumstances were my temptation. The terrors behind me looked blacker than the terrors before me; and the dreadful argument of wanting bread, and being run into the horrible distresses I was in before, master'd all my resolution, and I gave my∣self up to shame and infamy.</P>
<P>The rest of the evening we spent very agree∣ably. He was perfectly good-humoured and ex∣tremely cheerful; and I having consented, as above, to his proposal, we had not much more to do; he gave me my writings, and the bond for my maintenance during his life, and for the five hundred pounds for myself, with the one hundred pounds, as has been said, for each of my children, after his death; and so far was he from abating his fondness and affection to me, that two years after we were thus, as
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
he called it, married, he made his will greatly in favour of me and my children, as will be re∣lated hereafter.</P>
<P>Amy put us to bed, and my friend Mr. Dazzle, I cannot call him husband, was so well pleased with Amy, for her fidelity and kindness to me, that he paid her all the arrear of her wages that I owed her, and gave her five guineas besides; and surely Amy richly deserved what she had, for never was a servant so true to a mistress in such dreadful circumstances as I was in.</P>
<P>We lived, certainly, the most agreeable life, the grand exception only excepted, that ever two lived together; he was the most obliging, and the most tender men, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that ever woman gave herself up to; nor was there ever the least inter∣ruption to our mutual kindness, no, not to the last day of his life; and he would frequently say, for I confess I loved him, that he esteemed me as much his wife, as if we had been married from our youth, and had neither of us known any other; nay, he loved me, I believe, as en∣tirely, as if I had been the wife of his youth; and, he told me, it was true, in one sense, that he had two wives, but that I was the wife of his affection, the other the wife of his aversion.</P>
<P>I say, we lived as cheerfully, and as happily, as could be expected, considering our circum∣stances; I mean as to the pretended marriage, and as to that, Mr. Dazzle had not the least con∣cern about him for it: yet I could not help it; there was, and would be, hours of intervals, and of dark reflections, which came involuntarily in, and thrust in sighs into the middle of all my songs; and there would be, sometimes, a heavi∣ness of heart, which intermingled itself with all my joy, and which would often fetch a tear; and
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
let others pretend what they will, I believe it im∣possible to be otherwise with any-body; there can be no substantial satisfaction in a life of known wickedness: conscience will, and does, often break in upon them at particular times, let them do what they can to prevent it.</P>
<P>But I am not to preach, but to relate, and what∣ever loose reflections were, and how often soever those dark intervals came on, I did my utmost to conceal them from him; aye, and to suppress, and smother them too in myself; and to outward ap∣pearance we lived as cheerfully, and as agreeably, as it was possible for any couple in the world to live.</P>
<P>After I had thus lived with him something above two years, I found myself with child; Mr. Dazzle was mightily pleased at it, and nothing could be kinder than he was in the preparations he made for me, and for my lying-in, which was, however, very private, because I cared for as lit∣tle company as possible; nor had I kept up my neighbourly acquaintance; so that I had no-body to invite upon such an occasion.</P>
<P>I was brought to-bed of a daughter, but the child died at about six weeks old; and the next year I brought him a son, to his great satisfaction: it was a charming child, and did very well.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Mr. Dazzle came to me one evening, and told me, he had a very difficult thing happened to him, which he knew not what to do in, or how to resolve about, unless I would make him easy: this was, that his occasions re∣quired him to go over to France for about two months.</P>
<P><Q>“Well, my dear,' says I, 'and how shall I make you easy?”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="55" REF="69"/>
“Why, by consenting to let me go,' says he, upon which condition, I will tell you the occasi∣on of my going, that you may judge of the ne∣cessity” there is for it on my side.</Q> Then to make me easy in his going, he told me, he would make his will before he went, which should be to my full satisfaction.</P>
<P>I told him, the last part was so kind, that I could not decline the first part, unless he would give me leave to add, that if it was not for put∣ting him to an extraordinary expence, I would go over along with him.</P>
<P>He was so pleased with this offer, that he told me, he would give me full satisfaction for it, and accept of it too; so he took me to London with him the next day, and there he made his will, and shewed it to me, and sealed it before proper witnesses, and then gave it me to keep. In this will he gave a thousand pounds to a person that we both knew very well, in trust, to pay it, with the interest from the time of his decease, to me, or my assigns; then he willed the payment of my jointure, as he called it, viz. his bond as be∣fore-mentioned, to me and my children, after his death; he also gave me all the houshold-goods, plate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This was a most engaging thing for a man to do to one under my circumstances; and it would have been hard, as I told him, to deny him any thing, or to refuse to go with him any where; so we settled every thing as well as we could; left Amy in charge with the house and children, for now they were all come home; and for his other business, which was in jewels, he had two men he entrusted, who he had good security for,
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
and who managed for him, and corresponded with him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>A Journey to Paris.—Villainy undiscovered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THings being thus concerted, and so privately as his agents knew nothing of me, we went away to France, arrived safe at Calais, and by easy journies, came in eight days to Paris, where we lodged in the house of an English merchant of his acquaintance, as husband and wife, and were very courteously entertained.</P>
<P>Mr. Dazzle's business was with some persons of the first rank, and to whom he had sold some jewels of very good value, and received a great sum of money in specie, and, as he told me privately, he gained three thousand pistoles by the bargain, but would not suffer the most inti∣mate friend he had there, to know what he had received; for it is not so safe a thing in Paris, to have a great sum of money in keeping, as it might be in London.</P>
<P>We made this journey much longer than we intended; and he sent for one of his managers in London, to come over to us to Paris with some diamonds, and sent him back to London again, to fetch more; then other business sell into his hands so unexpectedly, that I began to think we should take up our constant residence there, which I was not very averse to, it being my native coun∣try, and I spoke the language perfectly well; so we took a house in Paris, and lived very genteely: Mr. Dazzle offered to keep me a coach, but I declined it, especially in Paris; but as they have those conveniencies by the day there, at a certain
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
rate, I had an equipage provided for me when∣ever I pleased, and I lived here in a very good fi∣gure, and might have lived higher if I pleased.</P>
<P>But in the middle of all this felicity, a dreadful disaster befel me, which entirely unhinged all my af∣fairs, and threw me back into the same state of life that I was in before; with this one happy exception however, that whereas before I was poor, even to mi∣sery, now I was not only provided for, but very rich.</P>
<P>Mr. Dazzle had the name in Paris for a very rich man, and indeed, he was so, though not so immensely rich as people imagined; but that which was fatal to him, was, that he generally carried a shagreen case in his pocket, especially when he went to court, or to the houses of any of the Princes of the blood, in which he had jewels of very great value.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that being to go to Ver∣failles, to wait upon the Prince of C—, he came up into my chamber in the morning, and laid out his jewel-case, because he was not going to show any jewels, but to get a foreign bill accepted, which he had received from Amsterd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; so when he gave me the case, he said, <Q>“My dear, I think I need not carry this with me, because, it may be, I may not come back t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll night, and it is too much to venture:' I returned, Then my dear, you shan't go.”</Q></P>
<P>'Why? my dear,' says he.</P>
<P><Q>“Because as they are too much for you, so you are too much for me to venture; and you shall not go, unless you will promise me not to stay so as” to come back in the night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I hope there is no danger,' said he, 'seeing I have nothing about me of any value; and,” therefore, left I should, take these too.'</Q> And
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
gives me his gold watch, and a rich diamond, which he had in a ring, and always wore on his finger.</P>
<P><Q>“Well but, my dear,' says I, 'you make me more uneasy now than before; for if you appre∣hend no danger, why do you use this caution? and if you apprehend there is danger, why do you go at all?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“There is no danger,' says he, 'if I do not stay late, and I do not design to do so.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, but promise me then, that you won't, says I, 'or else I cannot consent to your going.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I won't indeed, my dear,' says he, 'unless I am obliged to it; I assure you I do not in∣tend it; but if I should, I am not worth rob∣bing now; for I have nothing about me, but” about six pistoles in my purse, and this little ring.'</Q> Shewing me a small diamond ring, worth about ten or twelve pistoles, which he put upon his fin∣ger, in the room of the rich one.</P>
<P>I still pressed him not to stay late, and he said he would not. <Q>“But if I am kept late,' says he, beyond my expectation, I will stay all night, and come next morning.”</Q></P>
<P>This seemed a very good caution: but still my mind was very uneasy about him, and I told him so, and entreated him not to go. I told him, I did not know what might be the reason, but that I had a strange terror upon my mind about his going, and that, if he did go, I was persuaded some harm would attend him. He smiled, and returned; <Q>“Well, my dear, if it should be so, you are now richly provided for; all that” I have here, I give to you;'</Q> and with that, he takes up the casket; <Q>“Here,' says he, 'hold
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
your hand, there is a good estate for you in this case; if any thing happens to me, it is all your” own, I give it to you for yourself.'</Q> And with that, he put the casket, the fine ring, and his gold watch, all into my hands, and the key of his escritoir besides; adding, 'And in my escritoir 'there is some money: it is all your own.'</P>
<P>I stared at him, as if I was frighted, as indeed I was, for I thought his countenance changed, and he appeared terrified, and full of horror; but it all went off, and he looked as he usually did. Immediately I fell a crying, and hung about him. <Q>“My dear,' said I, 'I am frighted to death; you shall not go; depend upon it, some mischief will” befal you.'</Q> I did not tell him how my vaporish fancy had represented him to me, that I thought was not proper; besides, he would only have laughed at me, and would have gone away with a jest about it. But I pressed him seriously not to go that day; or if he did, to promise me to come home to Paris by day-light. He looked a little graver then, than he did before; told me, he was not apprehensive of the least danger; but if there was, he would either take care to come in the day, or, as he said before, would stay all night.</P>
<P>But all these promises came to nothing; for he was set upon in the open day, and robbed, by three men on horseback, masked, as he went; and one of them, who, it seems, rifled him, while the rest stood to stop the coach, stabbed him in the body with a sword, so that he died immediate∣ly. He had a footman behind the coach, who they knocked down, with the stock, or but-end of a carbine. They were supposed to kill him, because of the disappointment they met with, in
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
not getting his casket of diamonds, which they knew he carried about him; and this was supposed, because after they had killed him, they made the coachman drive out of the road, a long way over the heath, till they came to a convenient place, where they pulled him out of the coach, and searched his cloaths more narrowly than they could do while he was alive.</P>
<P>But they found nothing but his little ring, six pistoles, and the value of about seven livres in small monies.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful blow to me; though I cannot say I was so surprised as I should otherwise have been; for all the while he was gone, my mind was oppressed with the weight of my own thoughts; and I was as sure that I should never see him any more, that I think nothing could be like it; the impression was so strong, that, I think, nothing could make so deep a wound that was imaginary; and I was so dejected and disconsolate, that when I received the news of his disaster, there was no room for any extraordinary alteration in me: I had cried great part of the day, eat nothing, and only waited, as I might say, to receive the dismal news, which I had brought to me about five o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>I was in a strange country; and though I had a pretty many acquaintances, had but very few friends that I could consult on the occasion' All possible enquiry was made after the villains that had been thus babrarous, but nothing could be heard of them; nor was it possible that the footman could make any discovery of them, by his description; for they knocked him down im∣mediately, so that he knew nothing of what was done afterwards; the coachman was the only man
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
that could say any thing, and all his account a∣mounted to no more than this, that one of them had soldier's cloaths, but he could not remember the particulars of his mounting, so as to know what regiment he belonged to; and as to their faces, that he could know nothing of, because they had all of them masks on.</P>
<P>I had him buried as decently as the place would permit a protestant stranger to be buried, and made some of the scruples and difficulties on that account easy, by the help of money to a person, who went boldly to the curate of the parish of St. Sulpitius, in Paris, and told him, that the Gen∣tleman that was killed, was a catholic; that the thieves had taken from him a cross of gold, set with diamonds, worth six thousand livres; that his wi∣dow was a catholic, and had sent by him sixty crowns to the church, for masses to be said for the repose of his soul. Upon all which, though not one word of it was true, he was buried with all the ceremonies of the Roman Church.</P>
<P>I almost cried myself to death for him; for I abandoned myself to all the excesses of grief: and indeed, I loved him to a degree inexpressible; and considering what kindness he had shewn me at first, and how tenderly he had used me to the last, what could I do less?</P>
<P>Then, the matter of his death was terrible and frightful<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to me, and I was a good while as one stupid; however, after some time, I began to re∣cover, and look into my affairs. I had the satis∣fection not to be left in distress, or in danger of poverty; on the contrary, besides what he had put into my hands fairly, in his life-time, which a∣mounted to a very considerable value: I found above seven hundred pistoles in gold, in his escri∣toir, of which he had given me the key: and I
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
found foreign bills accepted, for about twelve thou∣sand livres; so that, in a word, I found myself possessed of almost ten thousand pounds sterling, in a very few days after this disaster.</P>
<P>The first thing I did upon this occasion, was, to send a letter to my maid Amy; with an in∣junction of secrecy, not to acquaint any one with it, not even my children; wherein I gave her the particulars of my disaster; how Mr. Dazzle was murdered. And as I did not know how his rela∣tions, or his wife's friends, might act upon that occasion, I ordered her to convey away all the plate, linen, and other things of value, and to secure them in person's hands that I directed her to, and then to sell and dispose of the furniture of the house, if she could; and so, without acquainting any-body with the reason of her going, withdraw; sending notice to the head-manager at London, that the house was quitted by the tenant, and they might come and take possession of it for the exe∣cutors. Amy was so dexterous, and did the work so nimbly, that she emptied the house, and sent the key to the said manager, almost as soon as he had notice of the misfortune that befel their master.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>An Incident agreeable to most Wives.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPON their receiving the surprising news of his death, the head-manager came over to Paris: I made no scruple of calling myself Ma∣dam Dazzle, the widow of Monsieur Dazzle, the English jeweller; and as I spoke French naturally, I did not let him know but that I was his wife, married in France, and that I had not heard that
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
he had any wife in England; but pretended to be surprised, and exclaim against him for so base an action; and that I had good friends in Poictou, where I was born, who would take care to have justice done me in England, out of his estate.</P>
<P>I should have observed, that as soon as the news was public of a man being murdered, and that he was a jeweller, fame did me the favour as to publish presently, that he was robbed of his casket of jewels, which he always carried about him. I confirmed this among my daily lamenta∣tions for his disaster, and added, that he had with him a fine diamond ring, which he was known to wear frequently about him, valued at a hundred pistoles, a gold watch, and a great quantity of diamonds of inestimable value, in his casket; which jewels he was carrying to the Prince of C—, to show some of them to him; and the Prince owned, that he had spoken to him to bring some such jewels, to let him see them. But I sorely repented this part afterwards, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>This rumour put an end to all enquiry after his jewels, his ring, or his watch; and as for the seven hundred pistoles, these I secured: for the bills which were in hand, I owned I had them; but that, as I said, I brought my husband thirty thousand livres portion, I claimed the said bills, which came to about twelve thousand livres, for my amende; and this, with the plate, and the houshold-goods was the principal of all his estate which they could come at. As to the foreign-bill, which he was going to Versailles to get accepted, it was really lost with him; but his manager, who had remitted the bill to him by way of Amsterdam, bringing over the second bill, the
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
money was saved, as they called it, which would, otherwise, have been also gone; the villains who robbed and murdered him, were, to be sure, afraid to send any-body to get the bill ac∣cepted; for that would undoubtedly have disco∣vered them.</P>
<P>By this time my maid Amy was arrived, and she gave me an account of her management, and how she had secured every thing, and that she had quitted the house, and sent the key to the head∣manager of his business; and let me know how much she had made of every thing, very punctu∣ally and honestly.</P>
<P>I should have observed in the account of his dwelling with me so long at Kentish-town, that he never passed for any thing there, but a lodger in the house; and though he was landlord, that did not alter the case; so that at his death, Amy coming to quit the house, and give them the key, there was no affinity between that, and the case of their master, who was newly killed.</P>
<P>I got good advice at Paris, from an eminent lawyer, a Counsellor of the Parliament there, and laying my case before him, he directed me to make a process in dower upon the estate, for making good my new fortune upon matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the manager went back to England, well satisfied, that he had gotten the unaccepted bills of ex∣change, which were for two thousand five hun∣dred pounds, with some other things, which toge∣ther, amounted to a very large sum; and thus I got rid of him.</P>
<P>I was visited with great civility on this sad occasion, of the loss of my husband, as they thought him, by a great many Ladies of quality;
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
and the Prince of C—, to whom it was reported he was carrying the jewels, sent his Gentleman with a very handsome compliment of condolance to me; and his Gentleman, whether with or without order, hinted, as if his Highness did in∣tend to have visited me himself, but that some ac∣cident, which he made a long story of, had pre∣vented him.</P>
<P>By the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncourse of ladies and others, that thus came to visit me, I began to be much known; and as I did not forget to set myself out with all possible advantage, considering the dress of a wi∣dow; I say, as I did thus from my own vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very handsome; I say, on this account, I was soon made very publick, and was known by the name of La Belle veufeu de Poictou; or, The pretty Widow of Poictou. As I was very well pleased to see my∣self thus handsomely used in my affliction, it soon dried up all my tears; and though I appeared as a widow, yet, as we say in England, it was a widow comforted: I took care to let the Ladies see, that I knew how to receive them; that I was not at a loss how to behave to any of them; and, in short, I began to be very popular there; but I had an occasion afterwards, which made me decline that kind of management, as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P>About four days after I had received the com∣pliments of condolance from the Prince of C—, the same gentleman he had sent before came to tell me, that his Highness was coming to give me a visit. I was, indeed, surprised at that. How∣ever, as there was no remedy, I prepared to re∣ceive him as well as I could. It was not many
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
minutes before his Highness came, introduced by his own Gentleman, and, by my woman, Amy.</P>
<P>He treated me with abundance of civility, and condoled politely the loss of my husband, and likewise the manner of it; he told me, he un∣derstood he was coming to Versailles, to himself, to shew him some jewels; that it was true, that he had discoursed with him about jewels, but could not imagine how any villains should hear of his coming at that time with them; that he had not ordered him to attend with them at Versailles, but told him that he would come to Paris by such a day, so that he was no way accessary to the disaster. I told him gravely, I knew very well that all his Highness had said of that part, was true; that these villains knew his profession, and knew, no doubt, that he always carried a casket of jewels about him, and that he always wore a diamond ring, on his finger worth a hundred pistoles, which report had magnified to five hun∣dred; and that if he had been going to any other place, it would have been the same thing. After this, his Highness rose up to go, and told me, he had resolved, however, to make me some re∣paration; and with these words, put a silk purse into my hand, with a hundred pistoles, and told me, he would make me a farther compliment of a small pension, which his gentleman would in∣form me of.</P>
<P>You may be sure I behaved with a due sense of so much goodness, and offered to kneel to kiss his hand; but he took me up, and saluted me, and sat down again, though before, he made as if he was going away, making me sit down by him.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="81"/>
He then began to talk with me more fami∣liarly; told me he hoped I was not left in bad circumstances; that Mr. Dazzle was reputed to be very rich, and that he had gained lately great sums by some jewels; and he hoped, he said, that I had still a fortune agreeable to the con∣dition I had lived in before.</P>
<P>I replied, with tears, That I believed if Mr. Dazzle had lived, we should have been far out of danger of want; but that it was impossible to estimate the loss which I had sustained, besides that of the life of my husband; that by the opi∣nion of those that knew something of his affairs, and of what value the jewels were which he in∣tended to have shewn to his Highness, he could not have less about him, than the value of a hundred thousand livres; that it was a fatal blow to me, and to his whole family, especially that they should be lost in such a manner.</P>
<P>His Highness returned, with an air of concern, that he was very sorry for it; but he hoped, if I settled in Paris, I might find ways to restore my fortune; at the same time he complimented me upon my being the finest woman, both in figure and features, that he had ever seen, and that I could not fail of admirers. I bowed, and hum∣bly thanked his Highness, but told him, I had no expectations of that kind; that I thought I should be obliged to go over to England, to look after my husband's effects there, which I was told were considerable; but that I did not know what justice a poor stranger would get among them; and as for Paris, my fortune be∣ing so impaired, I saw nothing before me, but to go back to Poictou, to my friends, where some of my relations, I hoped, might do some∣thing
<PB N="68" REF="82"/>
for me; and added, that one of my bro∣thers was an Abbot, near Poictiers.</P>
<P>He rose from his seat, and, taking me by the hand, led me to a large looking-glass, which made up the pier in the front of the parlour; <Q>“Look there, Madam,' said he, 'is it sit that” face, that shape, those eyes,'</Q> pointing to my figure in the glass, 'should go back to Poictou? <Q>'No, Madam,' says he, “stay, and make some person of quality happy, that may, in return, make you forget all your sorrows;”</Q> and with that, he took me in his arms, and kissing me twice, told me, he would see me again, but with less ceremony.</P>
<P>Some little time after this, his Gentleman came to me again, and with great ceremony and respect, delivered me a black box, tied with a scarlet ribband, and sealed with the Prince's coat of arms; there was in it a grant from his High∣ness, with a warrant to his Banker to pay me two thousand livres a year, during my stay in Paris, as the widow of Monsieur Dazzle, the Jeweller, mentioning the horrid murder of my late husband, as the occasion of it.</P>
<P>I received it with great submission, and ex∣pressions of being infinitely obliged to his master, and of my shewing myself on all occasions his Highness's most obedient servant; and after giv∣ing my most humble duty to his Highness, with the utmost acknowledgments of the obligation; I went to a little cabinet, and taking out some gold, offered to give him five pistoles.</P>
<P>He drew back, but with the greatest respect, and told me, he humbly thanked me, but that he durst not accept them; that his Highness would take it so ill of him, he was sure he would
<PB N="69" REF="83"/>
never see his face more; but that he would not fail to acquaint his Highness what respect I had offered; and added, <Q>“I assure you, Madam, you engross the thoughts of the Prince, my master, to a greater degree than you imagine; and, I be∣lieve,” you will hear more of him.'</Q> I told him, if his Highness did me the honour to see me again, I hoped he would not let me be so surprised as I was before; that I would be glad to have some little notice of it, and would be obliged to him, if he would procure it me. He replied, he was very sure, that when his Highness intended to visit me, he should be sent before, to give me notice of it; and that he would give me as much warning of it as possible.</P>
<P>The same person came several times after this about the settlement, the grant requiring several things yet to be done for making it payable, without going every time to the Prince again for a fresh warrant. The particulars of this part I did not understand; but as soon as it was finished, which was above two months, the Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n came one afternoon, and said, his Highness de∣signed to visit me in the evening; but desired to be admitted without ceremony.</P>
<P>Now I began to have suspicions, and resolved, if his Highness did come again, he should see me under no disadvantages if I could help it; there∣fore I prepared not my rooms only, but myself; and when he came in, there was no-body ap∣peared in the house but his Gentleman, and my maid Amy; and of her I bid the Gentleman ac∣quaint his Highness, that she was an English wo∣man, that she did not understand a word of French; and that she was one also that might be trusted.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="84"/>
When he came into my room, I fell down at his feet, and with words full of duty and respect, thanked him for his bounty and goodness to a poor desolate woman, oppressed under the weight of so terrible a disaster, and refused to rise till he would allow me the honour to kiss his hand.</P>
<P><Q><HI>“Leves vous done,'</HI> says the Prince, taking me in his arms, 'I design more favours for you, than this trifle; and,' he added, 'you shall, for the future, find a friend where you did not look for it; and I resolve to let you see how kind I can be to one, who is, to me, the most agreeable creature on earth.”</Q></P>
<P>I was in a kind of half-mourning, had turned off my weeds, and my head was so dressed, as failed not to set me out with advantage, for, now I began to understand his meaning; and the Prince professed, I was the most beautiful crea∣ture on earth; and 'Where have I lived?' says he; <Q>“and how ill have I been served, that I should never, till now, be shewed the finest woman in France?”</Q></P>
<P>This was the way, the most likely to break in upon my virtue, if I had been mistress of any, for I was now extremely vain, and particularly of my beauty; which, as other people admired, so I became every day more in love with myself than before.</P>
<P>He said some very kind things to me after this, and sat down with me for an hour, or more; when getting up, and calling his Gentleman by his name, he threw open the door, <HI>'Au boir,'</HI> says he; upon which, his Gentleman immediately brought up a little table, covered with a fine da∣mask cloth, the table no bigger than he could bring in his two hands; but upon it was set two
<PB N="71" REF="85"/>
decanters, one of champaigne, and the other of water, six silver plates, and a service of fine sweet-meats in fine china dishes, on a set of rings standing up about twenty inches high, one above another; below, were three roasted patridges, and a quail. As soon as the Gentleman had set all down, he ordered him to withdraw. 'Now,' says the Prince, 'I intend to sup with you.'</P>
<P>When he sent away his Gentleman, I stood up, and offered to wait on his Highness while he eat; but he positively refused, and told me. <Q>“No, to-morrow you shall be the widow of Monsieur Dazzle, the jeweller, but to-night you shall be my mistress; therefore sit here,' says he, 'and eat with me, or I will get up and serve.”</Q></P>
<P>I would then have called up my woman, Amy, but I thought that would not be proper neither; so I made my excuse, that since his Highness would not let his own servant wait, I would not presume to let my woman come up; but if he would please to let me wait, it would be my honour to fill his Highness's wine: but, as before, he would by no means allow me; so we sat and eat toge∣ther.</P>
<P><Q>“Now, Madam,' says the Prince, 'give me leave to lay aside my character; let us talk to∣gether with the freedom of equals. My quality sets me at a distance from you, and makes you ceremonious; your beauty exalts you to more than an equality; I must then treat you as lovers do their mistresses, but I cannot speak the lan∣guage; it is enough to tell you, how agreeable you are to me; how I am surprised at your beauty, and resolve to make you happy, and to be happy with you.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="86"/>
I blushed, and looking towards him, said, I was already made happy, in the favour of a per∣son of such rank; and had nothing to ask of his Highness, but that he would believe me infinitely obliged.</P>
<P>After he had done eating, he poured the sweet∣meats into my lap; and the wine being out, he called his Gentleman again, to take away the things, and laying another cloth, set the table on one side of the room, with a noble service of plate upon it; then having set the two decanters again upon the table, filled, as before, he withdrew; for I found the fellow understood his business very well, and his Lord's business too.</P>
<P>About half an hour after, the Prince told me, that I offered to wait a little before; that if I would now take the trouble, he would give me leave to give him some wine: so I went to the table, filled a glass of wine, and brought it to him, on a fine salver, which the glasses stood on, and brought a decanter of water in my other hand, to mix it as he thought fit.</P>
<P>He smiled, and bid me look on that salver; which I did, and admired it much, for it was a very fine one, indeed. <Q>“You may see,' says he, I resolve to have more of your company, for my” servant shall leave you that plate, for my use.'</Q> I told him, I believed his Highness would not take it ill, that I was not furnished fit to entertain a person of his rank; and that I would take great care of it, and value myself infinitely upon the honour of his Highness's visit.</P>
<P>It now began to grow late, and he began to take notice of it: 'But,' says he, <Q>“I cannot leave you; have you not a spare lodging, for one” night?'</Q> I told him, I had but a homely lodg∣ing
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
to entertain such a guest; he said something exceeding kind on that head, but needless to re∣peat; adding, that my company would make him amends.</P>
<P>About one in the morning, I begged leave to withdraw, supposing he would go to bed: but he said, 'I am not going to-bed yet; pray let me see 'you again.'</P>
<P>I took this time to undress me, and to come in a new dress, which was, in a manner, <HI>une disha∣bille,</HI> but so neat, and so agreeable, that he seemed surprised. 'I thought,' says he, <Q>“you could not have dressed to more advantage, than” you had done before; but now, I find—</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is only a loose habit, my Lord,' said I;” that I may the better wait on your Highness:</Q></P>
<P>'You are perfectly obliging,' says he: and with that he took me in his arms, and—</P>
<P><Q>“My Lord! my woman! my woman's com∣ing!” And will—</Q></P>
<P>The conclusion was, an appointment to sup with me the next evening.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this, to shew how unhappy women are ruined by great men; for though poverty is an irresistible temptation to the poor, vanity and splendor are as irresistible to the rich; to be courted by a Prince, who was first a bene∣factor, then an admirer; to be called handsome, the finest woman in France; are things, a woman must have no vanity, nay, no corruption in her, that is not overcome by it; and my case was such, that, I am afraid, I had too much of both.</P>
<P>Had I been mistress of any resolution; all had been safe: but my virtue was lost before, and the Devil, who had found the way to break in upon me by one temptation, easily mastered me now,
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
by another; and I gave myself up to a person, who was not only a man of high dignity, but was the most tempting and obliging man I had ever yet met with.</P>
<P>I had the same particular to insist upon here with the Prince, that I had with Mr. Dazzle before. I hesitated much at consenting, at first asking; but the Prince told me, Princes did not court like other men; that they brought more powerful arguments; and he very prettily added, that they were sooner repulsed that other men, and ought to be sooner complied with; intimating, though very genteely, that after a woman had posi∣tively refused him once, he could not, like other men, wait with importunities, and stratagems, and laying long sieges; but as such men as he stormed warmly, so, if repulsed, they made no se∣cond attacks. And indeed, it was but reasonable; for as it was below their rank, to be long battering a woman's constancy, so they run greater ha∣zards in being exposed in their amours, than other men did.</P>
<P>I took this for a satisfactory answer, and told his Highness, that I had the same thoughts, in re∣spect to the manner of his attacks, for that his person, and his arguments, were irresistible; that a person of his rank, and a munificence so un∣bounded, could not be withstood; that no virtue was proof against him, except such, as was able too to suffer martyrdom. That I thought it im∣possible I could be overcome; but that now I found it was impossible I should not be overcome. That so much goodness, joined with so much greatness, would have conquered any woman; and that I confessed he had the victory over me, by a merit infinitely superior to the conquest he had made.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="89"/>
He made me a most obliging answer; told me, abundance of fine things, which still flattered my vanity, till at last I began to have pride enough to believe him, and fancied myself a fit mistress for a Prince.</P>
<P>As he had thus, as I have said, obtained the last favour, and he had all the freedom with me that it was possible for me to grant, so he gave me leave to use as much freedom with him another way, and that was, to have every thing of him I thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask of him with an air of avarice as if I was greedily making a property of him; but I ma∣naged him with such art, that he generally antici∣pated my demands. He only requested of me, that I would not think of taking another house, as I had intimated to him, that I had intended, not thinking it good enough to receive his visits in; but, he said, my house was the most convenient that could possibly be found in all Paris for an a∣mour, especially for him; having a way out into three streets, and not overlooked by any neigh∣bours; so that he could pass and repass without observation: for one of the back-ways opened in∣to a narrow dark passage, which passage was a thorough-fare, out of one street into another; and any person that went in or out by the door, had no more to do, but to see there was no-body follow∣ed him in the passage, before he went in at the door. This request I knew was reasonable, and therefore, I assured him I would not change my dwelling, seeing his Highness did not think it too mean for me to receive him in.</P>
<P>He also desired me, that I would not take any more servants, or set up any equipage, at least,
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
for the present; for that it would then be imme∣diately concluded, I had been left very rich; and then I should be thronged with the impertinence of admirers, who would be attracted by the mo∣ney, as well as by the beauty of a young widow, and he should be frequently interrupted in his visits; or, that the world would conclude I was maintained by some body, and would be inde∣fatigable to find out the person; so that he should have spies peeping at him, every time he went out or in, which it would be impossible to disappoint; and that he should presently have it talked over all the toilets in Paris, that the Prince de C—had got the jeweller's widow for a mistress.</P>
<P>This was too just to oppose; and I made no scruple to tell his Highness, that since he had stooped so low as to make me his own, he ought to have all the satisfaction in the world that I was so; that I would take all the measures he should please to direct me, to avoid the im∣pertinent attacks of others; and that, if he thought fit, I would be wholly within doors, and have it given out, that I was obliged to go to England, to solicit my affairs there, after my hus∣band's misfortune; and that I was not expected there again for at least a year or two. This he liked very well, only, he said, that he would by no means have me confined; that it would injure my health; and that I should then take a coun∣try-house in some village, a good way off of the city, where it should not be known who I was; and that he should be there sometimes, to divert me.</P>
<P>I made no scruple of the confinement; and told his Highness, no place could be a confinement,
<PB N="77" REF="91"/>
where I had such a visiter; and so I put off the country-house, which would have been to re∣move myself farther from him, and have less of his company; and made the house be, as it were, shut up. Amy, indeed, appeared; and when any of the neighbours and servants enquired, she an∣swered in broken French, that I was gone to Eng∣land, to look after my affairs; which presently went current through the streets about us. For you are to observe, that the people of Paris, espe∣cially the women, are the most busy and im∣pertinent enquirers into the conduct of their neighbours, especially that of a single woman, that are in the world; though there are no greater intriguers in the universe than them∣selves; and perhaps that may be the reason of it; for it is an old but a sure rule; that</P>
<Q><L>When deep intrigues are close and shy,</L>
<L>The Guilty are the first that spy.</L></Q>
<P>Thus his Highness had the most easy, and yet the most undiscoverable access to me imaginable; and he seldom failed to come two or three nights in a week, and sometimes stayed two or three nights together. Once he told me, he was re∣solved I should be weary of his company, and that he would learn to know what it was to be a prisoner; so he gave out among his servants, that he was gone to one of his seats, where he often went a hunting, and that he should not return under a fortnight; and that fortnight he stayed wholly with me, and never went out of my doors.</P>
<P>Never woman, in such a station, lived a fort∣night in so compleat a fullness of human de∣light;
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
for to have the entire possession of one of the most accomplished Princes in the world, and of the politest best-bred man, to converse with; what could be more inexpressibly pleasing, and especially to a woman of such a vast deal of pride and vanity, as I had?</P>
<P>To finish the felicity of this part, I must not forget, that the Devil had played a new game with me, and prevailed with me to satisfy myself with this amour, as a lawful thing; that a Prince of such grandeur, and majesty, so infinitely supe∣rior to me, and one who had made such an intro∣duction by an unparalelled bounty, I could not re∣sist; and therefore, that it was very lawful for me to do it, being at that time perfectly single, and unengaged to any other man; as I was, most certainly, by the unaccountable absence of Mr. Bacon, my husband, and the murder of Mr. Dazzle, who went for my second.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that I was the easier to persuade myself of the truth of such a doctrine as this, when it was so much for my ease, and for the repose of my mind, to have it be so.</P>
<Q><L>In things we wish, 'tis easy to deceive;</L>
<L>What we would have, we willingly believe.</L></Q>
<P>I say, I satisfied myself with the surprising oc∣casion, that, as it was all irresistible, so it was all lawful; for that heaven would not suffer us to be punished for that which it was not possible for us to avoid; and with these absurdities I kept con∣science from giving me any considerable distur∣bance in all this matter; and I was as perfectly easy as to the lawfulness of it, as if I had been mar∣ried
<PB N="79" REF="93"/>
to the Prince, and had had no other husband: so possible is it for us to toll ourselves up in wick∣edness, till we grow invulnerable by conscience: and that centinel once dozed, sleeps fast, not to be awakened while the tide of pleasure continues to flow, or till something dark and dreadful brings us to ourselves again,</P>
<P>I have, I consess, wondered at the stupidity that my intellectual part was under all that while; what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethargick fumes dozed the soul; and how it was possible that I, who in the case before, where the temptation was many ways more forci∣ble, and the arguments stronger and more irre∣sistible, was yet under a continued inquietude on account of the wicked life I led, could now live in the most profound tranquility, and with an uninterrupted peace, nay, even rising up to sa∣tisfaction, and joy, and yet in a more palpable state of adultery than before; for before, Mr. Dazzle, who called me wife, had the pretence of his wise being parted from him, refusing to do the duty of her office as a wise to him: as for me, my circumstances were the same; but as for the Prince, as he had a fine and extraordinary Lady, or Princess of his own; so he had two or three mistresses more besides me, and made no scruple of it, even to me.</P>
<P>However, I say, as to my own part, I enjoyed myself in perfect tranquility; and as the Prince was the only deity I worshipped, so I was really his idol; and however it was with his Princess, I assure you, his other mistresses found a sensible difference; and though they could never find me out, yet I had good intelligence that they guessed very well, that their Lord had got some new favourite that robbed them of his company,
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
and perhaps, of some of his usual bounty too. And now I must mention the sacrifices he made to his idol; and they were not a few, I assure you.</P>
<P>As he loved like a Prince, so he rewarded like a Prince; for though he declined my making a figure, he let me see, that he was above doing it for the saving the expence of it, and so he told me, and that he would make it up in other things: first of all, he sent me a toilet, with all the appurtenances, of silver, even so much as the frame of the table; and then, for the house, he gave me the table, or sideboard of plate I men∣tioned before, with all things belonging to it of massy silver; so that, in short, I could not, for my life, study to ask him for any thing of plate which I had not.</P>
<P>He could then accommodate me in nothing more but jewels and cloaths, or money for cloaths. He sent his Gentleman to the mercer's, and bought me a suit of the finest brocaded silk, fi∣gured with gold, and another with silver, and another of crimson; so that I had three suits of cloaths, such as the Queen of France would not have disdained to have worn, Yet I went out no∣where; but as those were for me to put on, when I went out of mourning, I dressed myself in them, alternately, whenever his Highness came to see me.</P>
<P>I had no less than five several morning dresses besides these, so that I need never be seen twice in the same dress; to these, he added several par∣cels of fine linen, and of lace, that I had no room to ask for more, or indeed for so much.</P>
<P>I took the liberty once, in our freedoms, to tell him, he was too bountiful, and that I was
<PB N="81" REF="95"/>
too chargeable to him for a mistress, and that I would be his faithful servant, at less expence to him; and that he not only left me no room to ask him for any thing, but that he supplied me with such a profusion of good things, that I scarce could wear them, or use them; unless I kept a great equipage, which he knew was no way convenient for him, or for me. He smiled, and took me in his arms, and told me, he was resolved, while I was his, I should never be able to ask him for any thing; but that he would be daily asking new favours of me.</P>
<P>After we were up, for this conference was in bed, he desired I would dress me in the best suit of cloaths I had: it was a day or two after the three suits were made, and brought home. I told him, if he pleased, I would rather dress me in that suit which I knew he liked best. He asked me how I could know which he would like best, before he had seen them? I told him I would presume, for once, to guess at his fancy by my own; so I went and dressed me in the second suit, brocaded with silver, and returned in full dress, with a suit of Brussel's lace, which would have been worth in England, two hundred pounds sterling; and I was every way set out as well as Amy could dress me, who was a very genteel dresser: in this figure I came to him, out of my dressing-room, which opened with folding-doors into his bed-chamber.</P>
<P>He sat as one astonished, a good-while, look∣ing at me, without speaking a word, till I came quite up to him, kneeled on one knee to him, and almost whether he would or no, kissed his hand. He took me up, and stood up himself; but was surprised, when, taking me in his arms, he
<PB N="82" REF="96"/>
perceived tears to run down my cheeks. <Q>“My dear,”</Q> says he, <Q>“what mean these tears?”</Q> <Q>“My Lord,”</Q> said I, after some little check, for I could not speak presently, <Q>“I beseech you to be∣lieve me, they are not tears of sorrow, but tears of joy. It is impossible for me to see myself snatched from the misery I was fallen into, and at once to be in the arms of a Prince of such goodness, such immense bounty, and be treated” in such a manner; it is not possible, my Lord,” said I,</Q> <Q>“to contain the satisfaction of it; and it will break out in an excess in some measure proportioned to your immense bounty, and to the affection which your Highness treats me” with, who am so infinitely below you.”</Q></P>
<P>It would look a little too much like a romance here, to repeat all the kind things he said to me on that occasion, but I cannot omit one passage; as he saw the tears drop down my cheeks, he pulled out a fine cambrick handkerchief, and was going to wipe the tears off, but checked his hand, as if he was afraid to deface something; I say, he checked his hand, and tossed the hand∣kerchief to me to do it myself. I took the hint immediately, and with a kind of pleasant disdain, <Q>“How, my Lord!”</Q> said I, <Q>“have you kissed me so often, and don't know whether I am painted or not? Pray let your Highness satisfy your∣self, that you have no cheats put upon you; for once let me be vain enough to say, I have” not deceived you with false colours;”</Q> with this, I put a handkerchief into his hand, and taking his hand into mine, I made him wipe my face so hard, that he was unwilling to do it for fear of hurting me.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="97"/>
He appeared surprized more than ever, and swore, which was the first time that I had heard him swear from my first knowing him, that he could not have believed there was any such skin without paint in the world: 'Well, my Lord,' said I, <Q>“your Highness shall have a farther de∣monstration than this; as to that which you are pleased to accept for beauty, that it is the” meer work of Nature;'</Q> and with that I rung a bell for my woman Amy, and bade her bring me a cup full of hot water; and when it was come I desired his Highness to feel if it was warm, which he did; and I immediately washed my face all over with it before him. This was, indeed, more than satisfaction, that is to say, than believing, for it was an undeniable demonstration; and he kissed my cheeks and neck a thousand times, with expressions of the greatest surprize imaginable.</P>
<P>Nor was I an indifferent figure as to shape, though I had had two children by Mr. Dazzle, and five by my husband. I say, I was no desp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣eable shape; and, as my Prince, I must be allowed the vanity to call him so, was taking his view of me, as I walked from one end of the room to the other; he at last leads me to the darkest part of the room, and standing behind me, bade me hold up my head; when putting both his hands round my neck, as if he was spanning it, to see how small it was, for it was long and small, he held my neck so hard in his hand, that I complained he hurt me a little; what he did it for I knew not, nor had I the least suspicion but that he was span∣ning my neck; but when I said he hurt me, he seemed to let go, and in half a minute more led me to a pier-glass, and behold I saw my neck
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
clasped with a fine necklace of diamonds; whereas I felt no more what he was doing that if he had really done nothing at all, nor did I suspect it in the least. If I had an ounce of blood in me, that did not fly up into my face, neck, and breasts, it must be from some interruption in the vessels. I was all on fire with the sight, and began to wonder what it was that was coming to me.</P>
<P>However, to let him see that I was not unqua∣lified to receive benefits; I turned about, <Q>“My Lord,' says I, 'your Highness is resolved to conquer by your bounty the very gratitude of your servants; you will leave no room for any thing but thanks, and make those thanks useless too, by their bearing no proportion to the” occasion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I love. My Dear,' says he, 'to see every thing suitable. A fine gown and petticoat; a fine laced head; a fine face and neck, and no necklace, would not have made the object per∣pect:” But why that blush, my Dear?' says the Prince.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My Lord,' said I, 'all your gifts call for blushes; but, above all, I blush to receive what I am so ill able to merit, and may become so ill also.”</Q></P>
<P>Thus far I am a standing mark of the weak∣ness of great men, in their vice; that value not squandering away immense wealth, upon the most worthless creatures; or, to sum it up in a word, they raise the value of the object which they pretend to pitch upon, by their fancy; I say, raise the value of it, at their own expence; give vast presents for a ruinous favour, which is so far from being equal to the price, that nothing will, at last,
<PB N="85" REF="99"/>
prove more absurd, than the cost men are at to purchase their own destruction.</P>
<P>I could not, in the height of all these fine doings, I say, I could not be without some just reflection, though conscience was, as I said, dumb, as to any disturbance it gave me in my wickedness; my vanity was fed up to such a height, that I had no room to give way to such reflections.</P>
<P>But I could not but sometimes look back with astonishment at the folly of men of quality, who immense in their bounty, as in their wealth, give to a profusion, and without bounds, to the most scandalous of our sex, for granting them the liberty of amusing themselves, and ruining both.</P>
<P>I that knew what this carcase of mine had been but a few years before; how overwhelm'd with grief, drowned in tears, frighted with the pros∣pect of beggary, and surrounded with fatherless children; that was pawning and selling the cloaths that covered me for a dinner, and sat on the ground, despairing of hope, and expecting to be starved, till my children were snatched from me to be kept by the parish; I, that was after this, a strumpet for bread, and, abandoning conscience and virtue, lived with another woman's husband; I that was despised by all my relations, and my husband's too; I that was left so entirely desolate, friendless and helpless, that I knew not how to get the least help to keep me from starving; that I should be caressed by a prince, for the honour of having the scandalous use of my prostituted body, common before to his inferior: I say, I could not but reflect upon the brutality and blind∣ness of mankind; that because nature had given me a good skin, and agreeable features, should suffer that beauty to be such a bait to appetite,
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
as to do such sordid, unaccountable things, to obtain the possession of it.</P>
<P>It is for this reason that I have so largely set down the particulars of the caresses I was treated with by Mr. Dazzle, and also by this prince; not to make the story an incentive to the vice, which I am now such a sorrowful penitent for being guilty of, God forbid any should make so vile a use of so good a design, but to draw the just pic∣ture of a man enslaved to the rage of his vicious appetite; how he defaces the image of God in his soul; dethrones his reason; causes conscience to abdicate the possession, and exalts sense into the vacant throne; how he deposes the man and exalts the brute.</P>
<P>O! could we hear now the reproaches this great man afterwards loaded himself with, when he grew weary of this admired creature, and be∣came sick of his vice! how profitable would the report of them be to the reader of this story; but had he himself also known the dirty history of my actings upon the stage of life, that little time I had been in the world, how much more severe would those reproaches have been upon himself; but I shall come to this again.</P>
<P>I lived in this gay sort of retirement almost three years, in which time, no amour of such a kind, sure, was ever carried up so high; the Prince knew no bounds to his munificence; he could give me nothing, either for my wearing or using, or eating or drinking, more than he had done from the beginning.</P>
<P>His presents were very frequent, and large; often a hundred pistoles, never less than fifty at a time; and I must do myself the justice to say, that I seemed rather backward to receive, than craving
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
and encroaching; not that I had not an avaricious temper; nor was it that I did not foresee that this was my harvest, in which I was to gather up, and that it would not last long: but it was, that really his bounty always anticipated my expectations, and even my wishes; and he gave me money so fast, that he rather poured it in upon me, than left me room to ask it; so that, before I could spend fifty pistoles, I had always a supply of a hundred.</P>
<P>After I had been near a year and a half in his arms, I proved with child. I did not take any notice of it to him, till I was satisfied, that I was not deceived; when one morning early, when we were in bed together, I said to him, <Q>“My Lord, I doubt your Highness never gives yourself leave to think what the case should be, if I should” have the honour to be with child by you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, my dear,' said he, 'we are able to keep it, if such a thing should happen; I hope you” are not concerned about that.</Q></P>
<P>No, my Lord,' said I, <Q>“I should think myself very happy, if I could bring your Highness a son, I should hope to see him a lieutenant-general of the King's Armies, by the interest of his father,” and by his own merit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Assure yourself, child,' said he, 'if it should be so, I will not refuse owning him for my son, though it be, as they call it a natural son; and shall never slight or neglect him, for the sake of” his mother:</Q> Then he began to importune me, to know if it was so; but I positively denied it so long, till at last, I was able to give him the satisfaction of knowing it himself, by the motion of the child within me.</P>
<P>He professed himself overjoyed at the discovery, but told me, that now it was absolutely necessary
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
for me to quit the confinement, which, he said, I had suffered for his sake, and to take a house somewhere in the country, in order for health, as well as for privacy, against my lying-in. This was quite out of my way; but the Prince, who was a man of pleasure, had, it seems, several re∣treats of this kind, which he had made use of, I suppose, upon like occasions; and so leaving it, as it were, to his gentleman, he provided a very convenient house, about four miles south of Paris, at the village of Bray, where I had very agree∣able lodgings, good gardens, and all things very easy to my content; but one thing did not please me at all, viz. that an old woman was provided, and put into the house, to furnish every thing necessary to my lying-inn, and to assist me at my travail.</P>
<P>I did not like this old woman; she looked so like a spy upon me, or, as sometimes I was frighted to imagine, like one set privately to dispatch me out of the world, as might best suit with the cir∣cumstance of my lying-in; and when his High∣ness came the next time to see me, which was not many days, I expostulated a little on the subject of the old woman; and by the management of my tongue, as well as by the strength of reasoning, I convinced him, that it would not be at all con∣venient; that it would be the greatest risque on his side; and that first or last it would certainly expose him and me also. I assured him, that my servant being an English woman, never knew to that hour who his Highness was; that I always called him the Count de Clerac; and that she knew nothing else of him, nor ever should; that if he would give me leave to choose proper persons for my use, it should be so ordered, that not one
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
of them should know who he was, or perhaps ever see his face; and that for the reality of the child that should be born, his Highness who had alone been at the first of it should, if he pleased, be present in the room at the time, so that he would need no witnesses on that account.</P>
<P>This discourse fully satisfied him, so that he ordered his gentleman to dismiss the old woman, and to get me another, which was accordingly done; and I was very easy when she came, and the more so, because she brought with the mid∣wife a good motherly sort of a woman, who was to be her assistant, and would be very helpful on occasion; and bespoke a man-midwife at Paris too, if there should be any necessity for his help. Having thus made provision for every thing, the Count, for so we all called him in public, came as often to see me as I could expect, and con∣tinued exceeding kind as he had always been. One day conversing together upon the subject of my being with child, I told him how all things were in order, but that I had a strange appre∣hension that I should die with that child. He smiled.</P>
<P><Q>“So all the ladies say, my dear,' said he, when they are with child. 'Well, however, my Lord,' said I, 'it is but just that care should be taken, that what you have bestowed in your” excess of bounty upon me should not be lost;'</Q> and upon this I pulled a paper out of my bosom folded up but not sealed, and I read it to him; wherein I had left order, that all the plate and jewels, and fine furniture, which his Highness had given me, should be restored to him by my woman, and the keys be immediately delivered to his gen∣tleman, in case of disaster.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="104"/>
Then I recommended my woman Amy to his favour, on condition she gave the keys up, as above, to his gentleman, and his gentleman's re∣ceipt for the same. When he saw this, <Q>“My dear child,' said he, 'and took me in his arms, what, have you been making your will, and disposing of your effects.” Pray who do you make your he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</Q></P>
<P>So far as to do justice to your Highness, <Q>“in case of mortality, I have my Lord,' said I, and who should I dispose the valuable things to, which I have had from your hand, as pledges of your favour, and testimonies of your bounty, but to the giver of them? If the child should live, your Highness will, I do not question, act like yourself in that part, and I shall have the utmost satisfaction, that it will be well used by your direction.”</Q></P>
<P>I could see he took this very well: <Q>“I have for∣saken all the ladies in Paris,' said he, 'for you; and I have observed every day since I knew you, that you know how to merit all that a man of honour can do for you: Be easy, child, I hope you will not die; and all you have is your own, to do with it as you please.”</Q></P>
<P>I was then within two months of my reckon∣ing; and when I found my time was come, it fell out very happily that he was in the house, and I entreated he would continue in it till it was over, which he agreed to. They called his Highness to come into the room, if he pleased, as I had of∣fered, and as I desired him, and I sent word I would make as few complaints as possible, to pre∣vent disturbing him. He came into the room once, and called to me to be of good courage, it would soon be over. And then he withdrew again; and in about half an hour more, Amy carried him the
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>
news that I was delivered, and had brought him a charming boy. He gave her ten pistoles for her news, stayed till they had adjusted things about me, and then came into the room again; cheared me and spoke kindly to me, and looked on the child, then kissed me and withdrew; and came again the next day to visit me.</P>
<P>Since this, and when I have looked back upon these things with eyes unpossessed with crime, when the wicked part has appeared in its clearer light, and I have seen it in its own natural colours; when no more blinded with the glittering appear∣ances, which at that time deluded me, and as in like cases, if I may guess at others by myself, too much possessed the mind; I say, since this, I have often wondered with what pleasure or satisfaction the prince could look upon the poor innocent infant; which though his own, and that he might that way have some attachment in his affections to it, yet must always afterwards be a remem∣brancer to him of his most early crime; and which was worse, must bear upon itself, unmerit∣ed, an eternal mark of infamy, which should be spoken of upon all occasions to its reproach, from the folly of its father, and wickedness of its mother.</P>
<P>Great men are, indeed, delivered from the burthen of their natural children, as to their maintenance. This is the main affliction in other cases, where there is not substance sufficient, without breaking into the fortunes of the family; in those cases, either a man's legi∣timate children suffer, which is very unnatural; or the unfortunate mother of that illegitimate birth has a dreadful affliction, either of being turned off with her child, and be left to starve, or of seeing the poor infant packed off with a piece
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
of money, to some of those she-butchers, who take children off of their hands, as it is called; that is to say, starve them, and in a word, murder them.</P>
<P>Great men, I say, are delivered from this bur∣then, because they are always furnished to supply the expence of their out-of-the-way offspring, by making little assignments upon the bank of Lyons, or the town-house of Paris, and settling those sums, to be received for the maintenance of such expence as they see cause.</P>
<P>Thus, in the case of this child of mine, while he and I conversed, there was no need to make any appointment, as an appennage, or maintenance for the child, or its nurse; for he supplied me more than sufficiently for all those things; but afterward, when time, and a particular circum∣stance, put an end to our conversing together; as such things always meet with a period, and gene∣rally break off abruptly; I say, after that, I found he appointed the children a settled allowance, by an assignment of annual rent, upon the bank of Lyons, which was sufficient for bringing them handsomely, though privately, up in the world; and that not in a manner unworthy of their father's blood, though I might be sunk and for∣gotten in the case; nor did the children ever know any thing of their mother to this day, other, than as you may have an account hereafter.</P>
<P>But to look back to the particular observation I was making, which, I hope may be of use to those who read my story; I say, it was something wonderful to me to see this person so exceedingly delighted at the birth of this child, and to pleased with it; for he would sit and look at it, and with an air of seriousness sometimes, a great while to∣gether;
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
and particularly, I observed, he loved to look at it when it was asleep.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a lovely, charming child, and had a certain vivacity in its countenance, that is far from being common to all children so young; and he would often say to me, that he be∣lieved there was something extraordinary in the child, and he did not doubt, if he lived, but he would come to be a great man.</P>
<P>I could not hear him say so, but though secretly it pleased me, yet it so closely touched me another way, that I could not refrain sighing, and some∣times tears; and one time in particular, it so affected me, that I could not conceal it from him; but when he saw tears run down my face, there was no concealing the occasion from him; he was too importunate to be denied in a thing of that moment; so I frankly answered, <Q>“It sensibly affects me, my Lord,' said I; 'that whatever the merit of this little creature may be, he must always have a bend on his arms; the disaster of his birth will be always, not only a blot to his honour, but a bar to his fortunes in the world; our affection will be ever his affliction, and his mother's crime be the son's reproach; the blot can never be wiped out by the most glorious actions; nay, if he lives to raise a family, the infamy must descend even to his in∣nocent posterity.”</Q></P>
<P>He took the thought, and told me afterwards, that it made a deeper impression on him than he discovered to me at that time; but for the present, he put it off, with telling me, these things could not be helped; that they served for a spur to the spirits of brave men; inspired them with prin∣ciples of gallantry; and prompted them to brave
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
actions; that though it might be true, that the mention of illegitimacy might attend the name, yet that personal virtue placed a man of honour a∣bove the reproach of his birth; that as he had no share in the offence, he would have no concern at the blot; when having by his own merit placed himself out of the reach of scandal, his fame should drown the memory of his beginning.</P>
<P>That is was usual for men of quality to make such little escapes, so the number of their natu∣ral children were so great, that they generally took such good care of their education, that some of the greatest men in the world had a bend in their coats of arms, and that it was of no consequence to them, especially when their fame began to rise upon the basis of their acquired merit; and upon this, he began to reckon up to me some of the greatest families in France, and in England also.</P>
<P>This carried off our discourse for a time; but I went farther with him once; removing the discourse from the part attending our children, to the reproach which those children would be apt to throw upon us, their originals; and when speaking a little too feelingly on the subject, he began to receive the impression a little deeper than I wished he had done; at last he told me, I had almost acted the confessor to him; that I might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous doctrine to him, than we should either of us like, or than I was aware of: <Q>“For, my dear,' says he; 'if once we come to talk of repentance, we must talk of parting.”</Q></P>
<P>If tears were in my eyes before, they flowed too fast now to be restrained; and I gave him but too much satisfaction in my looks, that I had
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
yet no reflections upon my mind strong enough to go that length, and that I could no more think of parting, than he could.</P>
<P>He said a great many kind things, which were great, like himself, and extenuating our crime, intimated to me, that he could no more part with me, than I could with him; so we both, as I may say, even against our light, and against our conviction, concluded to sin on: indeed, his affec∣tion to the child, was one great tie to him, for he was extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>I think I may say now, that I lived indeed like a Queen; for no woman was ever more valued, or more caressed by a person of such quality, only in the station of a mistress. I had, indeed, one deficiency, which women in such circumstances seldom are chargeable with; namely, I craved no∣thing of him; I never asked him for any thing in my life; nor suffered myself to be made use of, as is too much the custom of mistresses, to ask fa∣vours for others: his bounty always prevented me in the first, and my strict concealing myself, in the last; which was no less to my convenience, than his.</P>
<P>The only favour I ever asked of him, was, for his Gentleman, who he had all along intrusted with the secret of our amour, and who had once so much offended him, that he found it very hard to make his peace; he came and laid his case be∣fore Amy, and begged her to speak to me, to inter∣cede for him; which I did, and on my account, he was pardoned; for which, the fellow requited me, by getting to-bed to his benefactress, at which I was very angry; but Amy generously acknow∣ledged, that it was her fault as much as his; and that she loved the fellow; I say, this pacified me,
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
and I only obtained of her, that she should not let him know, that I knew it.</P>
<P>I enquired of Amy, upon what terms they came to be so intimate; but Amy seemed backward to explain herself; till after some time, she told it me all freely, of her own accord, which amounted to this; as they had many leisure hours, while they waited respectively, when his Lord and I were to∣gether; he could hardly avoid the usual question, why might not they do the same below, that we did above?</P>
<P>It happened one day, that the Prince had a mind to give me some diversion, and to take the air with me; but that he might do it, and not be publickly known, and that I might be the more effectually concealed, he ordered me to be taken up at a mantua-maker's house, where he sometimes came, whether upon other amours, or not, was no busi∣ness of mine to enquire. I knew nothing whither he intended to carry me; but when he was in the coach with me, he told me, he would shew me some of the beau monde: I told him, I cared not where I went, while I had the honour to have him with me. So he carried me to the fine palace of Meudon.</P>
<P>While I was there, the King happened to come thither from Versailles, and making but a short stay, visited Madam the Dauphiness. The Prince was here incog. only because of his being with me; and therefore, when he heard that the King was in the gardens, he kept close within the lodgings; but the Gentleman, in whose lodgings we were, with his Lady, and several others, went out to see the King, and I had the honour to be asked to go with them.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="111"/>
After we had seen the King, who did not stay long in the gardens, we walked up the broad terrace, and crossing the hall, towards the great stair-case, I had a sight which confounded me, as, I doubt not, it would have done any woman in the world. The horse-guards, or what they call there the Gens de arms, had upon some occasion been either upon duty, or reviewed, or something was the matter, that occasioned their being there, I know not what; but walking in the guard∣chamber, and with his jack-boots on, and the whole habit of the troop; I say, there, to my inexpressible confusion, I saw Mr. Bacon, my hus∣band, the brewer.</P>
<P>I passed so near him, that I almost touched him with my cloaths, and looked him full in the face, but having my fan before mine, so that he could not know me: however, I knew him perfectly well, and I heard him speak, which was a second way of knowing him; besides, I turned about af∣ter I had passed him some steps, and pretending to ask the Lady who was with me some questions, I stood as if I had viewed the great-hall, the outer guard-chamber, and some other things; but I did it, to take a full view of his dress, that I might farther inform myself.</P>
<P>I then asked the Lady; 'Pray Madam, what are these troopers? are they the King's guards?'</P>
<P><Q>“No,' says she, 'they are the Gens de arms; a small detachment of them, I suppose, attend∣ed the King to-day, but they are not his Ma∣jesty's” ordinary guard.'</Q> Another Lady that was with her, said, <Q>“No, Madam, it seems that is not the case; for I heard them saying, the Gens de arms were here to-day by special order,
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
some of them being to march towards the Rhine, and these to attend for orders; but they go back to-morrow to Orleans, where they are expected.”</Q></P>
<P>This satisfied me in part, but I found means after this, to enquire whose particular troop it was that the Gentlemen that were here belonged to; and with that, I heard they would all be at Paris the week after.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>An Incident disagreeable to most Wives.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TWO days after this, we returned for Paris, when I took occasion to speak to my Lord, that I heard the Gens de arms were to be in the city the next week, and that I should like to see them march, if they came in a body. He was so obliging, that I need not but just name a thing, and it was done; so he ordered his Gentleman to get me a place in a certain house, where I might see them march.</P>
<P>As he did not appear with me on this occa∣sion, so I had the liberty of taking Amy with me; and stood where we were very well ac∣commodated for the observation I was to make. I told Amy what I had seen, and she was as forward to make the discovery, as I was to have her, and almost as much surprized at the thing itself; in a word the Gens de arms entered the city, as was expected, and made a most glorious show indeed, being new-cloathed and armed, and being to have their standards blessed by the Arch∣bishop of Paris. On this occasion, they indeed looked very gay; and as they marched very leisure∣ly, I had time to take as critical a view, and
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
make as nice a search among them as I pleased. Here, in a particular rank, I saw my husband a∣gain, and a very handsome jolly fellow he was, as any in the troop.</P>
<P>Amy, who thought she might, on many ac∣counts, venture with more safety to be particular, than I could, asked her Gentleman, how a par∣ticular man, who she saw there, among the Gens de arms, might be enquired after, and found out; she having seen an Englishman riding there, which was supposed to be dead in England for several years before she came out of London, and that his wife had married again. It was a question the Gentleman did not well understand how to an∣swer; but another person, that stood by, told her, if she would tell him the Gentleman's name, he would endeavour to find him out for her, and asked jestingly, if he was her lover? Amy put that off with a laugh, but still continued her enquiry, and in such a manner, as the Gentleman easi∣ly perceived she was in earnest; so he left ban∣tering, and asked her in what part of the troop he rode; she foolishly told him his name, which she should not have done; and pointing to the cornet that troop carried, which was not then quite out of sight, she let him easily know where∣abouts he rode, only she could not name the Cap∣tain; however, he gave her such directions af∣terwards, that, in short, Amy, who was an inde∣fatigable girl, found him out; it seems he had not changed his name, not supposing any enquiry would be made after him here; but, I say, Amy found him out, and went boldly to his quarters, asked for him, and he came out to her immedi∣ately.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="114"/>
I believe I was not more confounded at my first seeing him at Meudon, than he was at seeing Amy; he started and turned pale, and asked in English, with an admiration, 'What are you!'</P>
<P>Sir!' said she, 'do not you know me?'</P>
<P><Q>“Yes,' says he, 'I knew you when you were alive, but what you are now, whether ghost or” substance, I know not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Be not afraid Sir, of that. I am the same Amy that was in your service, and do not speak to you now for any hurt, but that I saw you acciden∣tally yesterday ride among the troopers. I thought you might be glad to hear from your” friends in London.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, Amy, how does every body do? What,” is your mistress here?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My mistress, Sir, alas! not the mistress you mean. Poor gentlewoman, you left her in a sad” condition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, that is true, Amy, but it could not be” helped; I was in a sad condition myself.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I believe so, Sir, or else you had not gone away as you did; for it was a very terrible con∣dition” you left them all in, that I must say.</Q></P>
<P>'What did they do after I was gone?'</P>
<P><Q>“Do, Sir! very miserably, you may be sure;” how could it be otherwise?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, that is true indeed; but you may tell me, Amy, what became of them; for though I went away, it was not because I did not love them, but because I could not bear to see the poverty that was coming upon them, and which” was not in my power to help; what could I do?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay, I believe so indeed, and I have heard my mistress say many times she did not doubt
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
but your affliction was as great as her's almost, wherever you were.”</Q></P>
<P>'Why, did she believe I was alive then?'.</P>
<P><Q>“Yes, Sir, she always said she believed you were alive; because she thought she should have heard something of you, if you had been dead.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Aye, aye, my perplexity was very great, indeed, or else I had never gone away.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It was very cruel though, Sir; she almost broke her heart for you at first, for sear of what might befall you, and at last, because she could not hear from you.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Alas, Amy! what could I do? things were driven to the last extremity before I went. I could have done nothing but help to have starved them all, if I had stayed; and besides, I could not bear to see it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“You know, Sir, I can say little to what passed before, but I am a melancholy witness to the sad distresses of my poor mistress, as long as I stayed with her, and which would grieve your heart too, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she tells my whole story, to the time that the parish took off one of my children, and which she perceived very much affected him; and he shook his head, and said some things very bitter, when he heard of the cruelty of his own relations to me.</NOTE> to hear them.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, Amy, I have heard enough so far; what did she do afterwards?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I cannot give you any farther account, Sir. My mistress would not let me stay with her any longer; she could neither pay me, or subsist me. I told her I would serve her without any wages, but I could not live without victuals; so I was forced to leave her, sore against my will; and I” heard afterwards, that she had been seen in the
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
city very shabby, and poor in cloaths; and it was thought she worked with her needle for her bread.”</Q></P>
<P>All this the jade said with so much cunning, and managed it so well, and wiped her eyes, and cried so artificially, that he took it all as it was intend∣ed he should, and she saw tears in his eyes too. He told her it was a moving melancholy story, and it had almost broke his heart at first; but that he was driven to the last extremity, and could do nothing but stay and see them all starve, which he could not bear the thoughts of; that he left his wife all the money he had, but 25l. which was as little as he could take with him, to seek his for∣tune in the world. He could not doubt but that his relations, seeing they were all rich, would have taken the poor children, and not let them come to the parish; and that his wife was young and hand∣some; and he thought might marry again to her advantage, and for that very reason he never wrote to her, or let her know he was alive, that she might, in a reasonable term of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears marry, and perhaps mend her fortune: That he resolved never to claim her, because he should rejoice to hear that she had settled to her mind.</P>
<P>Amy said she could say nothing to that; but this, that she was satisfied her mistress would marry no-body, unless she had certain intelligence that he had been dead, from somebody that saw him buried; <Q>“But alas!' says Amy, 'my mistress was reduced to such dismal circumstances, that nobody would be so foolish as to think of her, unless it had been somebody to go a-begging with her.”</Q></P>
<P>Amy then seeing him so perfectly deluded, made a long and lamentable outcry, how she herself
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
had been deluded away, to marry a poor footman; <Q>“for he is no better,' says she, 'though” he calls himself a lord's gentleman;'</Q> and here, says Amy, 'he has dragged me over into a strange country, to make a begger of me;' and then she falls a crying again; which by the way, was all hypocrisy, but so as perfectly deceived him, and he gave entire credit to every word of it.</P>
<P><Q>“Why, Amy,' said he, 'you are very well dressed, you do not look as if you were in dan∣ger of being a beggar.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Aye, hang him,' says Amy, 'they love to have fine cloaths here, if they have never a smock under them; besides, Sir, most of the cloaths I have, were given me in the last place I had, when I went away from my mistress.”</Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole of the discourse, Amy got out of him what condition he was in, and how he lived, upon her promise to him, that if ever she came to England, and should see her old mistress, she should not let her know that he was alive.</P>
<P><Q>“Alas! Sir, I may never come to see England again as long as I live; and if I should, it would be ten thousand to one, whether I shall see my mistress; for how should I know which way to look for her? or what part of England she may be in; not I, I do not so much as know how to enquire for her; and if I should ever be so happy as to see her, I would not do her so much mischief, as to tell her where you were, Sir, unless she was in a condition to help her∣self” and you too.</Q></P>
<P>This farther deluded him, and made him en∣tirely open in his conversation with her. As to his own circumstances, he told her she saw him in the highest preferment he had arrived to, of

was ever like to arrive to: For having no friends or acquaintance in France, and which was worse, no money, he never expected to rise; that he could have been made a lieutenant to a troop of light-horse but the week before, by the favour of an officer in the Gens d' arms, who was his friend; but that he must have found eight thou∣sand livres to have paid for it, to the gentleman who possessed it, and had leave given him to sell: “<Q>But where could I get eight thousand livres, that have never been master of five hundred livres, at a time, since I came into France?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“O dear, Sir, I am very sorry to hear you say so; I fancy if you once got up to some prefer∣ment, you would think of my mistress again, and do something for her; poor woman she wants it to be sure,'</Q> and then she falls a-crying again; “<Q>it is a sad thing indeed,' says she, 'that you should be so hard put to it, when you had got a friend to recommend you, and should lose it for want of money;'—'Aye, so it was, Amy, indeed, but what can a stranger do that has no money or friends?' Here Amy puts in again, well,' says she, 'my poor mistress has had the loss, though she knows nothing of it. O dear! how happy it would have been, to be sure, Sir,” you would have helped her all you could.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Aye, Amy, so I would with all my heart; and even as I am, I would send her some relief, only that the letting her know I was alive, might do her some prejudice, in case of her set∣tling, or marrying any-body.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Alas!' says Amy, 'marry!' who will marry” her, in the poor condition she is in?' And so their discourse ended for that time.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="119"/>
All this was meer talk on both sides, and words of course; for on farther enquiry, Amy found that he had no such offer of a lieutenant's com∣mission, or any thing like it.</P>
<P>I was once thinking to have sent him the eight thousand livres, to purchase the commission he had spoken of. But Amy soon came to a better under∣standing of him; for she presently learned that he had a most abandoned character; that he was a meer sharper; one that would stick at nothing to get money, and that there was no depending on any thing he said; they told her he had often made use of pretences to borrow money, and move gentlemen to pity him, in hopes to get him pre∣ferment; that he had reported that he had a wife and five children in England, who he maintained out of his pay; and by these shifts had run into debt in several places; and upon several complaints for such things, he had been threatened to be turned out of the Gens d' Arms; and that, in short, he was not to be believed in any thing he said, or trusted on any account.</P>
<P>Upon this information, Amy began to cool in her farther meddling with him; and told me, it was not safe for me to attempt doing him any good, unless I resolved to put him upon suspicions and enquiries, which might be to my ruin, in the condition I was now in.</P>
<P>I was soon confirmed in this part of his cha∣racter; for the next time that Amy came to talk with him, he discovered himself more effectually; for while she had put him in hopes of procuring one to advance the money for the lieutenant's com∣mission for him, upon easy conditions; he, by degrees, dropt the discourse, then pretended it was too late, and that he could not get it; and then
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
descended to ask Amy to lend him five hundred pistoles.</P>
<P>Amy pretended poverty; that her circumstances were but mean; and that she could not raise such a sum; and this she did to try him to the utmost. He descended to three hundred, then to one hun∣dred, then to fifty, and then to a single pistole, which she lent him, and he never intending to pay it, played out of her sight as much as he could: and thus being satisfied that he was the same worthless thing he had ever been, I threw off all thoughts of him; whereas, had he been a man of any sense, and of any principle of honour, I would have lived honestly with him: but as a fool is the worst of husbands to do a woman good, so a fool is the worst husband a woman can do good to. All that I had now to do, was to keep out of his sight, which was not very difficult to me, considering in what station he lived.</P>
<P>The journal of his life, for one week, which I had sent me, was the least significant of any thing of its kind, that was ever seen; as it had really nothing of earnest in it, so it would make no jest, to relate it; it was not important enough, so much as to make the reader merry withal; and for that reason I omit it.</P>
<P>Yet this nothing-doing wretch was I obliged to watch and guard against, as against the only thing that was capable of doing me hurt in the world. I was to shun him, as we would shun a spectre, or even the Devil, if he was actually in our way. Though this life he led, sometimes moved me to pity him; yet, at the same time, it gave me most contemptible thoughts of him, and made me often say, I was a warning for all the Ladies of Europe, against marrying of fools; a man of
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
sense fails in the world, and gets up again, and a woman has some chance for herself; but with a fool! once fall, and ever undone; once poor, and sure to starve.</P>
<P>But it is time to have done with him. Once I had nothing to hope for, but to see him again; now my only felicity was, if possible, never to see him, and, I above all, to keep him from seeing me; which, as above, I took effectual care of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>A Tour to Italy, and back again.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Was now returned to Paris. My little son of honour, as I called him, was left where my last country seat then was, and I came to Paris, at the Prince's request; thither he came to me as soon as I arrived, and told me, he came to give me joy of my return, and to make his acknow∣ledgments, for that I had given him a son. I thought indeed, he had been going to give me a present, and so he did the next day; but in what he said then, he only jested with me. He gave me his company all the evening; supped with me about midnight, and telling me in jest, that the best thanks for a son born, was giving the pledge for another.</P>
<P>But as I hinted, so it was: the next morning he laid down, on my toilet, a purse with three hundred pistoles. I saw him lay it down, and un∣derstood what he meant. But I took no notice of it, till I came to it, as it were casually; then I gave a great cry-out, and fell a scolding in my way; for he gave me all possible freedom of speech, on such occasions. I told him, he was unkind; that
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>
he would never give me an opportunity to ask him for any thing; and that he forced me to blush, by being too much obliged; all which I knew was very agreeable to him: for as he was bountiful, be∣yond measure, so he was infinitely obliged by my being so backward to ask any favours; and I was even with him, for I never asked him for any mo∣ney in my life.</P>
<P>Upon this rallying him, he told me, I had ei∣ther perfectly studied the art of humour, or else, what was the greatest difficulty to others, was natural to me; adding, that nothing could be more obliging to a man of honour, than not to be soliciting and craving.</P>
<P>I told him, nothing could be craving upon him; that he left no room for it; that I hoped he did not give, merely to avoid the trouble of being im∣portuned. I told him, he might depend upon it, that I should be reduced very low indeed, before I offered to disturb him that way.</P>
<P>He said, a man of honour ought always to know what he ought to do; and as he did nothing but what he knew was reasonable, he gave me leave to be free with him, if I wanted any thing; that he had too much value for me, to deny me any thing, if I asked; but that it was infinitely agree∣able to him to hear me say, that what he did, was to my satisfaction.</P>
<P>We strained compliments thus a great while, and as he had me in his arms most part of the time, so upon all my expressions of his bounty to me, he put a stop to me with his kisses, and would admit me to go on no farther.</P>
<P>I should in this place mention, that this Prince was not a subject of France, though at that time
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>
he resided at Paris, and was much at Court, where, I suppose, he had, or expected, some considerable em∣ployment: but I mention it on this account; that a few days after this, he came to me, and told me, he was come to bring me not the most welcome news that ever I heard from him in his life. I looked at him, a little surprized; but he returned, <Q>“Do not be uneasy, it is as unpleasant to me, as to you; but I come to consult with you a∣bout it, and see, if it cannot be made a little easy to us both.”</Q></P>
<P>I seemed still more concerned and surprized. At last he said, it was, that he believed he should be obliged to go into Italy; which though otherwise it was very agreeable to him, yet his parting with me, made it very dull but to think of.</P>
<P>I sat mute, as one thunder-struck, for a good∣while; and it presently occurred to me, that I was going to lose him, which, indeed, I could but ill bear the thoughts of; and, as he told me, I turned pale. 'What is the matter?' said he hastily; 'I have surprized you, indeed;' and stepping to the side-board, fills a glass of cordial-water, and comes to me. 'Be not surprized,' said he; 'I will go no-where without you:' adding se∣veral other things so kind, as nothing could ex∣ceed it.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, turn pale, for I was very much surprized at first, believing that this was, as is often happens in such cases, only a project to drop me, and break off an amour, which he had now carried on so long; and a thou∣sand thoughts whirled about my head in the few moments while I was kept in suspence; I say, I was indeed, surprized, and might, perhaps, look
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
pale; but I was not in any danger of fainting, that I knew of.</P>
<P>However, it not a little pleased me, to see him so concerned and anxious about me; but I stopped a little, when he put the cordial to my mouth, and taking the glass in my hand, I said, <Q>“My Lord, your words are infinitely more of a cordial to me, than this citron; for as nothing can be a greater affliction, than to lose you, so nothing can be a greater satisfaction than the assurance, that I shall not have that misfortune.”</Q></P>
<P>He made me sit down, and he sat down by me, and after saying a thousand kind things to me; he turns upon me with a smile, <Q>“Why, will you venture yourself to Italy with me?' I stopped a-while, and then answered, 'that I wondered he would ask me that question; for I would go any-where in the world, or all over the world, wherever he should desire me, and give me the” felicity of his company.</Q></P>
<P>Then he entered into a long account of the occasion of the journey; and how the king had engaged him to go; and some other circumstances which are not proper to enter into here.</P>
<P>But to cut short this part of the story, and the history of our journey, and stay abroad, which would almost fill up a volume of itself; I say, we spent all that evening in chearful consultations about the manner of our travelling; the equipage and figure he should go in; and in what manner I should go. Several ways were proposed, but none seemed feasible; till, at last, I told him, I thought it would be so troublesome, so expensive, and so publick, that it would be many ways in∣convenient to him; and though it was a kind of death to me to lose him, yet that rather than
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
so very much perplex his affairs, I would submit to any thing.</P>
<P>At the next visit I filled his head with the same difficulties, and then, at last, came over him with a proposal, that I would stay in Paris, or where else he should direct; and when I heard of his safe arrival, would come away by myself, and place myself as near him as I could.</P>
<P>This gave him no satisfaction, nor would he hear any more of it; but if I durst venture my∣self, as he called it, such a journey, he would not lose the satisfaction of my company; and as for the expence, that was not to be named, nei∣ther indeed was there room to name it; for I found that he travelled at the King's expence, as well for himself as for all his equipage; being upon a piece of secret service of the last impor∣tance.</P>
<P>But after several debates between ourselves, he came to this resolution, viz. that he would travel incog. and so he should avoid all publick notice, either of himself, or of who went with him; and that then he should not only carry me with him, but have a perfect leisure of enjoying my agree∣able company, as he was pleased to call it, all the way.</P>
<P>This was so obliging, that nothing could be more; so upon this footing, he immediately set to work to prepare for his journey; and by his di∣rections, so did I too. But now I had a terrible difficulty upon me, and which way to get over it, I knew not; and that was, in what manner to take care of what I had to leave behind me. I was rich, as I have said, very rich; and what to do with it I knew not, nor who to leave in trust, I knew not. I had no-body but Amy, and to
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
travel without Amy, was very uncomfortable; or to leave all I had in the world with her, and if she miscarried, be ruined at once, was a frightful thought; for Amy might die, and whose hands things might fall into, I knew not: This gave me great uneasiness, and I knew not what to do; for I could not mention it to the Prince, lest he should see that I was richer than he thought I was.</P>
<P>But the Prince made all this easy to me; for in concerting measures for our journey, he started the thing himself, and asked me merrily one even∣ing, who I would trust with all my wealth, in my abscence?</P>
<P><Q>“My wealth, my Lord!' said I, 'except what I owe to your goodness, is but small; but yet, that little I have, I confess, causes some thought∣fulness; because I have no acquaintance in Paris that I dare trust with it, nor any-body but my woman, to leave in the house; and how to do without her upon the road, I do not well know.”</Q></P>
<P>'As to the road, be not concerned,' says the Prince, <Q>“I will provide you servants to your mind; and as for your woman, if you can trust her, leave her here, and I will put you in a way how to secure things, as well as if you” were at home.'</Q> I bowed and told him, I could not be put into better hands than his own, and that therefore, I would govern all my measures by his directions; so we talked no more of it that night.</P>
<P>The next day he sent me in a great iron chest, so large, that it was as much as six lusty fellows could get up the steps, into the house; and in this I put, indeed, all my wealth; and for my safety, he ordered a good honest ancient man and his wife,
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
to be in the house with her, to keep her company; and a maid servant, and a boy; so that there was a good family, and Amy was madam, the mistress of the house.</P>
<P>Things being thus secured, we set out incog. as he called it; but we had two coaches and six horses; two chaises; and about eight men servants on horseback, all very well armed.</P>
<P>Never was woman better used, that went upon no other account than I did. I had three women servants to wait on me: one was an elderly woman, who thoroughly understood her business, and ma∣naged every thing, so I had no trouble. They had one coach to themselves, and the Prince and I the other; only that sometimes, where he knew it necessary, I went into their coach; and one par∣ticular gentleman of the retinue rode with him.</P>
<P>I shall say no more of the journey, than that when he came to those frightful mountains, the Alps, there was no travelling in our coaches; so he ordered a horse-litter, but carried by mules, to be provided for me, and himself went on horse∣back; the coaches went some other way back to Lvons; then we had coaches hired at Turin, which met us at Susa; so that we were accom∣modated again, and went by easy journies after∣wards to Rome, where his business called him to stay some time, and from thence to Venice.</P>
<P>He was as good as his word indeed; for I had the pleasure of his company, and in a word, en∣grossed his conversation almost all the way. He took delight in showing me every thing that was to be seen, and particularly in telling me some∣thing of the history of every thing he shewed me.</P>
<P>What valuable pains were here thrown away upon one, who he was sure, at last, to abandon
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
with regret! How below himself did a man of quality, and of a thousand accomplishments, be∣have in all this! It is one of my reasons for en∣tering into this part, which otherwise would not be worth relating. Had I been a daughter, or a wife, of whom it might be said, that he had a just concern in their instruction or improvement, it had been an admirable step; but all this to a mistress! to one who he carried with him upon no account that could be rationally agreeable; and none but to gratify the meanest of himan frailties: This was the wonder of it.</P>
<P>But such is the power of a vicious inclination. Intriguing was, in a word, his darling crime; the worst excursion he made; for he was otherwise, one of the most excellent persons in the world; no passions; no furious deviations; no ostentati∣ous pride: The most humble, courteous, affable, person living; not an oath; not an indecent word, or the least blemish in behaviour was to be seen in all his conversation, except as before excepted; and it has given me occasion for many dark re∣flections since, to look back and think, that I should be the snare of such a person's life; that I should influence him to so much wickedness; and that I should be the instrument in the hand of the devil, to do him so much prejudice.</P>
<P>We were near two years upon this grand tour, as it may be called, during most of which, I re∣sided at Rome, or at Venice, having only been twice at Florence, and once at Naples. I made some very diverting and useful observations in all these places, and particularly of the conduct of the ladies; for I had an opportunity to converse very much among them, by the help of the old wo∣man who travelled with us. She had been at
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>
Naples, and at Venice, and had lived in the for∣mer several years; where, as I found, she had lived but a loose life, as indeed the women of Naples generally do; and, in short, I found she was fully acquainted with all the intriguing arts of that part of the world.</P>
<P>Here my Lord bought me a little female Turkish slave, who being taken at sea by a Maltese man of war, was brought in there; and of her I learned the Turkish language; their way of dressing and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncing, and some Turkish or rather Moorish songs, of which I made use, to my advantage, on an extraordinary occasion, some years after, as you shall hear in its place I need not say I learned Italian too, for I got pretty well mistress of that, before I had been there a year; and as I had leisure enough, and loved the language, I read all the Italian books I could come at.</P>
<P>I began to be so in love with Italy, especially with Naples and Venice, that I could have been very well satisfied to have sent for Amy, and have taken up my residence there for life.</P>
<P>As to Rome, I did not like it at all; the swarms of ecclesiasticks of all kinds, on one side, and the scoundrel rabble of the common people, on the other, make Rome the unpleasantest place in the world, to live in.</P>
<P>But I have no mind to write the history of my travels on this side of the world; at least, not now; it would be too tedious.</P>
<P>I must not, however, omit, that the Prince con∣tinued in all this journey, the most kind, obliging person to me in the world, and so constant, that though we were in a country, where it is well known all manner of liberties are taken, I am
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
yet well assured, he neither took the liberty he knew he might have, or so much as desired it.</P>
<P>I have often thought of this noble person, on that account. Had he been but half so true, so faithful and constant to the best lady in the world, I mean his princess; how glorious a virtue had it been in him? and how free had he been from those just reflections which touched him, in her behalf, when it was too late.</P>
<P>We had some very agreeable conversations upon this subject; and once he told me, with a kind of more than ordinary concern upon his thoughts, that he was greatly beholden to me for taking this hazardous and difficult journey; for that I had kept him honest. I looked up in his face, and coloured as red as fire. 'Well, well,' says he, 'do not let that surprize you; I do say, you 'have kept me honest.'</P>
<P><Q>“My Lord,' said I, 'it is not for me to ex∣plain your words, but I wish I could turn them my own way: I hope,' says I, 'and believe, we are both as honest as we can be, in our cir∣cumstances.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Ay, ay,' says he, 'and honester than I should have been, if you had not been with me. I cannot say but if you had not been here, I should have wandered among the gay world, in Naples, and in Venice too; for it is not such a crime here, as it is in other places. But I pro∣test, I have not touched a woman in Italy, but yourself; and more than that, I have not so much as had any desire to it; so that, I say, you” have kept me honest.</Q></P>
<P>I was silent, and was glad that he interrupted me, or kept me from speaking, with kissing me. I was once going to say, that if his Lady, the Prin∣cess,
<PB N="117" REF="131"/>
had been with him, she would, doubtless, have had the same influence upon his virtue, with infi∣nitely more advantage to him: but I considered this might give him offence; and besides, such things might have been dangerous to the circum∣stance I stood in; so it passed off. But I must confess, I saw that he was quite another man, as to women, than I understood he had always been before; and it was a particular satisfaction to me, that I was thereby convinced that what he said was true, and that he was, as I may say, all my own.</P>
<P>I was with child again in this journey, and lay∣in at Venice, but was not so happy as before. I brought him another son, and a very fine boy it was; but it lived not above two months.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, my Lord told me, his busi∣ness began to close, and we would think of return∣ing to France; which I was very glad of, but principally on account of my treasure I had there. It is true, I had letters very frequently from Amy, with accounts, that every thing was very safe, and that was very much to my satisfaction. However, as the Prince's negociations were at an end, and he was obliged to teturn, I was very glad to go. So we returned from Venice to Turin; and in the way, I saw the famous city of Milan. From Turin, we went over the mountains again, and our coaches met us at Pont a Voisin, between Chamberry and Lyons; and, by easy journies, we arrived safely at Paris; having been absent two years, wanting eleven days.</P>
<P>I found the family, much as we left them; and Amy cried for joy when she saw me, and I did the same.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="132"/>
The Prince took his leave of me the night be∣fore; for as he told me he knew he should be met upon the road by several persons of qua∣lity, and perhaps by the Princess herself, so we lay at two different inns that night, lest some should come quite to the place, as indeed, it hap∣pened. After this, I saw him not for above twenty days, being taken up in his family, and also with business; but he sent me his Gentleman, to tell me the reason of it, and bid me not be uneasy; and that satisfied me effectually.</P>
<P>In all this affluence of my good fortune, I did not forget that I had been rich and poor once al∣ready, alternately; and that I ought to know, that the circumstances I was now in, were not to be expected to last always; that I had had two chil∣dren by him, and expected another; and if I bred often, it would something impair me in the great article that supported my interest, I mean, what he called beauty; that as that declined, I might ex∣pect the fire would abate, and the warmth with which I was now so caressed, would cool, and in time, like the other mistresses of great men, I might be dropt again; and that, therefore, it was my business to take care that I should fall as softly as I could.</P>
<P>I say, I did not forget, therefore, to make as good provision for myself, as if I had had nothing to have subsisted on, but what I now gained; whereas I had not less than ten thousand pounds, as I said before, which I had amassed, or secured rather, out of the ruins of my faithful friend, the jeweller; and which, he little thinking of what was so near him when he went out, told me, though in a kind of a jest, was all my own, if
<PB N="119" REF="133"/>
he never came back; and which, upon that title, I took care to preserve.</P>
<P>My greatest difficulty now, was, how to secure my wealth, and to keep what I had got; for I had greatly added to it, by the generous bounty of the Prince, and the more, by the private retired man∣ner of living, which he rather desired for privacy, than parsimony; for he supplied me with a more magnificent way of life than I desired, if it had been proper.</P>
<P>I shall cut short the history of this pros∣perous wickedness, with telling you I brought him a third son, within seven months after our return from Italy; that now I lived a little more openly, and went by a particular name which he gave me abroad; but which I must o∣mit: viz. the Countess de—, and had coaches, and servants, suitable to the quality he had given me the appearance of; and which is more than usually happens in such cases, this held seven years from the beginning; during which time, as I had been very faithful to him, so, I must say, that he was the same to me; that whereas he usually had two or three women, which he kept privately, he had not in all that time conversed with any of them, but that I had so perfectly engrossed him, that he left them all, not, per∣haps, that he saved much by it, for I was a very chargeable mistress to him; but it was all owing to his particular affection to me, not to my extrava∣gance; for, as I said, he never gave me leave to ask him for any thing, but poured in his favours and presents faster than I expected, and so fast, as I could not have the assurance to make the least mention of desiring more.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="134"/>
Nor do I speak this of my own guess, I mean, about his constancy to me, and his quitting all other women; but the old harradan, as I may call her, who he made the guide of our travel∣ing, and who was a strange old creature, told me a thousand stories of his gallantry, as she called it, that he had no less than three mistresses at one time, and, as I found, all of her procuring, he had of a sudden, dropt them all, and that he was entirely lost to them; that they did believe he had fallen into some new hands, but she could never hear who, or where, till he sent for her to go this journey; and then the old hag complimented me upon his choice; that she did not wonder I had so much engrossed him; so much beauty; such an elegant figure, &amp;c. and there she stopt,</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I found by her, what was, you may be sure, to my particular satisfaction, viz. that, as I said before, he was all my own.</P>
<P>But the highest tide has its ebb; and in all things of this kind, there is a reflux which sometimes also is more impetuously violent than the first aggression. The Prince was a man of a vast fortune, though no Sovereign, and therefore there was no probability that the expence of keeping a mistress could be injurious to him, as to his estate: he had also several employments, both out of France, as well as in it; for he was not a subject of France, though he lived in that Court. He had a Princess, a wife, with whom he had lived several years, and a woman, so the voice of fame reported, the most valuable of her sex; of birth equal to him, if not supe∣rior, and of fortune proportionable; but, in beauty, wit, and a thousand good qualities,
<PB N="121" REF="135"/>
superior not to most women, but even to all her sex; and as to her virtue, the character which was most justly her due, was that of, not only the best of Princesses, but even the best of women.</P>
<P>They lived in the utmost harmony, as with such a Princess it was impossible to be otherwise; but yet the Princess was not insensible that her Lord had his foibles; that he did make some ex∣cursions; and particularly, that he had one fa∣vourite mistress which sometimes engrossed him more than she could wish, or be easily satisfied with: however, she was so good, so generous, so truly kind a wife, that she never gave him any uneasiness upon that account; except so much as must arise from the sense of her bearing the af∣front of it with such patience, and such a pro∣found respect for him, as was in itself enough to have reformed him, and did sometimes shock his generous mind, so as to keep him at home, as I may call it, a great while together; and it was not long before I not only perceived it by his absence, but really got a knowledge of the reason of it, and he even acknowledged it to me.</P>
<P>It was a point that lay not in me to manage: I made a kind of motion, once or twice, to him, to leave me, and keep himself to her, as he ought by the laws and rites of matrimony to do, and argued the generosity of the Princess to him, to persuade him: but I was a hypocrite; for had I prevailed with him really to be honest, I had lost him, which I could not bear the thoughts of; and he might easily see I was not in earnest. One time in particular, when I took upon me to talk at this rate, I found when I argued so much

for the virtue and honour, the birth, and above all, the generous usage he found in the person of the Princess, with respect to his private amours, and how it should prevail upon him: I found it began to affect him, and he returned; <Q>“And do you indeed,”</Q> says he, <Q>“persuade me to leave you? would you have me think you sincere?”</Q> I looked up in his face, smiling; <Q>“Not for any other favourite, my Lord,”</Q> said I; <Q>“that would” break my heart;</Q> but for the Princess!—and then I could say no more, tears followed, and I sat silent a-while. <Q>“Well,”</Q> says he, <Q>“if ever I do leave you, it shall be on the virtuous account; it shall be for the Princess, I assure you it shall be for no other woman.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That is enough, my Lord,”</Q> said I; <Q>“there I ought to submit; and, while I am assured it shall be for no other mistress, I promise your High∣ness, I will not repine; or that, if I do, it shall be a silent grief, it shall not interrupt your felicity.”</Q></P>
<P>All this while I said I knew not what, and said what I was no more able to do, than he was able to leave me; which, at that time, he owned he could not do, no, not for the Princess herself.</P>
<P>But another turn of affairs determined this matter; for the Princess was taken very ill, and in the opinion of all her physicians, very dange∣rously so: in her sickness she desired to speak with her Lord, and to take her leave of him. At this grievous parting, she said so many passionate kind things to him; lamented that she had left him no children; she had had three, but they were dead; hinted to him, that it was one of the
<PB N="123" REF="137"/>
chief things which gave her satisfaction in death, as to this world; that she should leave him room to have heirs to his family, by some Princess that should supply her place; with all humility, but with a Christian earnestness, recommended to him to do justice to such Princess, whoever it should be, from whom, to be sure, he would ex∣pect justice; that is to say, to keep to her singly, according to the solemnest part of the marriage-covenant; humbly asked his Highness pardon, if she had any way offended him; and appealed to Heaven, before whose tribunal she was to ap∣pear, that she had never violated her honour, or her duty to him; and praying to the Almighty, that his Highness might reform, and repent of his follies; she in the most moving, and most pathe∣tic expressions of her affection to him, took her last leave of him, and died the next day.</P>
<P>This discourse from a Princess so valuable in her∣self, and so dear to him, and the loss of her fol∣lowing so immediately after, made such deep im∣pressions on him, that he looked back with de∣testation upon the former part of his life; grew melancholy and reserved; changed his society, and much of the general conduct of his life; resolved on a life regulated most strictly by the rules of virtue, and piety; and in a word, was quite another man.</P>
<P>The first part of his reformation, was a storm upon me; for, about ten days after the Princess's funeral, he sent a message to me by his Gentle∣man, intimating, though in very civil terms, and with a short preamble, that he desired I would not take it ill that he was obliged to let me know, that he could see me no more. His Gentleman
<PB N="124" REF="138"/>
told me a long story of the new regulation of life his Lord had taken up, and that he had been so afflicted for the loss of his Princess, that he thought it would either shorten his life, or he would re∣tire into some religious house, to end his days in solitude.</P>
<P>I need not direct any body to suppose, how I received this news. I was, indeed, exceedingly surprized at it, and had much a-do to support my∣self, when the first part of it was delivered; though the gentleman delivered his errand with great re∣spect, and with all the regard to me, that he was able, and with a great deal of ceremony; also telling me how much he was concerned to bring me such a message.</P>
<P>But when I heard the particulars of the story at large, and especially that of the lady's discourse to the Prince, a little before her death, I was fully satisfied; I knew very well he had done nothing but what any man must do, that had a true sense upon him of the justice of the Princess's discourse to him, and of the necessity there was of his alter∣ing his course of life, if he intended to be either a christian, or an honest man. I say, when I heard this, I was perfectly easy; I confess it was a cir∣cumstance that I might be reasonably expected should have wrought something also upon me: I that had so much to reflect upon more than the Prince; that had now no more temptation of poverty, or of the powerful motive, which Amy used with me, namely, 'Comply and live; deny 'and starve;' I say, 'I that had no poverty to in∣troduce vice, but was grown not only well sup∣plied, but rich, and not only rich, but was very rich; in a word, richer than I knew how to think of; for the truth of it was, that thinking of it some∣times
<PB N="125" REF="139"/>
almost distracted me, for fear of losing it all again by some cheat or trick, not knowing any body that I could commit the trust of it to.</P>
<P>Besides, I should add at the close of this affair, that the Prince did not, as I may say, turn me off rudely, and with disgust; but with all the decency and goodness peculiar to himself, and that could consist with a man reformed, and struck with the sense of his having abused so good a lady as his late Princess had been. Nor did he send me away empty, but did every thing like himself; and in particular, ordered his gentleman to pay the rent of the house, and all the expence of his two sons: and to tell me how they were taken care of, and where; and also, that I might at all times inspect the usage they had, and if I disliked any thing, it should be rectified; and having thus finished every thing, he retired into Lorrain, where he had an estate, and I never heard of him more, I mean, not as a mistress.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>The History of a Jew and a Merchant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW I was at liberty to go to any part of the world, and take care of my money myself. The first thing that I resolved to do, was to go directly to England, for there, I thought, being among my country folks, for I esteemed myself an English woman, though I was born in France, but there, I say, I thought I could better manage things, than in France; at least, that I would be in less danger of being deceived; but how to get away with such a treasure as I had with me, was a difficult point, and what I was greatly at a loss about.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="140"/>
There was a Dutch merchant in Paris, a Mr. Vandunc, that was a person of great reputation for a man of substance, and of honesty; but I had no manner of acquaintance with him, nor did I know how to get acquainted, so as to discover my cir∣cumstances to him.</P>
<P>In this case I had no remedy, but that I must trust somebody; so I sent Amy. He was a little surprized when Amy came to him, and talked to him of remitting a sum of twelve thousand pistoles to England, and began to think she came to put some cheat upon him; but when he found that Amy was but a servant, and that I came to him myself, the case was altered.</P>
<P>I presently saw such a plainness in his dealing, and such honesty in his countenance, that I made no scruple to tell him my whole story. That I was a widow; that I had some jewels to dispose of, and also some money, which I had a mind to send to England, and to follow there myself; but being a woman, and having no correspond∣ence in London, I knew not what to do, or how to secure my effects.</P>
<P>He dealt very candidly with me, and advised me, when he knew my case so particularly, to take bills upon Amsterdam, and to go that way to England; for that I might lodge my treasure in the bank there, in the most secure manner in the world; and that there he could recommend me to a man who perfectly understood jewels, and would deal faithfully with me in the disposing of them.</P>
<P>I thanked him, but scrupled very much the travelling so far into a strange country, and espe∣cially with such a treasure about me; that whether known, or concealed, I did not know how to
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>
venture with it: Then he told me, he would try to dispose of them there, at Paris, and convert them into money, and so get me bills for the whole; and in a few days he brought a Jew to me, who, he said, would buy the jewels.</P>
<P>As soon as the Jew saw the jewels, I saw my folly; and it was ten thousand to one but I had been ruined, and perhaps, put to death in as cruel a manner as possible. The case was thus.</P>
<P>As soon, I say, as the Jew saw the jewels, he fell a jabbering in Dutch, to the merchant, and I could presently perceive that they were in some great surprize, both of them; the Jew held up his hands, looked at me with some horror, and put himself into a thousand shapes, twisting his body, and wringing up his face this way, and that way, in his discourse; stamping with his feet, and throwing abroad his hands, as if he was not in a rage only, but in a meer fury; then he would turn and give a look at me, like the Devil; I thought I never saw any thing so frightful in my life.</P>
<P>At length I put in a word; 'Sir,' says I, 'to Mr. Vandunc, <Q>“what is all this discourse to my business? What is this gentleman in all these passions about? I wish, if he is to treat with me, he would speak that I may understand him; or if you have business of your own between you, that is to be done first, let me withdraw, and I will come again when you are at leisure.”</Q></P>
<P>'No, no, Madam,' says the Merchant, very kindly, <Q>“you must not go, all our discourse is about you, and your jewels; and you shall hear it pre∣sently: it concerns you very much, I assure you:”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="128" REF="142"/>
“Concern me!' says I; 'what can it concern me so much, as to put this gentleman into such agonies? And what makes him give me such looks as he does? Why, he looks as if he would devour me.”</Q></P>
<P>The Jew understood me presently, continuing in a kind of rage, and spoke in French, 'Yes, 'Madam, it does concern you much, very much 'very much,' repeating the words, shaking his head, and then turning to the merchant, 'Sir,' says he, 'pray tell her what is the case.' 'No,' says Mr. Vandunc, 'not yet, let us talk a little 'farther of it by ourselves;' upon which they withdrew into another room, where still they talked very high, but in a language I did not understand. I began to be a little surprized at what the Jew had said, and eager to know what he meant, and was very impatient till the mer∣chant came back, and that so impatient, that I called one of his servants to let him kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, I desired to speak with him. When Mr. Vandunc came in, I asked his pardon for being so impa∣tient, but told him, I could not be easy, till he had told me what the meaning of all this was.</P>
<P><Q>“Why, Madam,' says he, 'in short the mean∣ing is, what I am surprized at too: This man is a Jew, and understands jewels perfectly well; and that was the reason I sent for him, to dis∣pose of them to him, for you; but as soon as he saw them, he knew the jewels very distinctly, and flying out in a passion, as you see he did, told me, in short, that they were the very par∣cel of jewels which the English Jeweller had about him, who was robbed going to Versailles, about seven years ago, to show them the Prince de C—, and that it was for these very jewels,
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>
that the poor gentleman was murdered; and he is in all this agony to make me ask you, how you came by them; and he says, you ought to be charged with the robbery and murder, and put to the question, to discover who were the persons that did it, that they might be brought” to justice:'</Q> while he said this, the Jew came impudently back, into the room, without calling, which a little surprized me again.</P>
<P>Mr. Vandunc spoke pretty good English, and he knew that the Jew did not understand English at all; so he told me the latter part, when the Jew came into the room, in English; at which I smiled, which put the Jew into his mad fit again, and shaking his head, and making his devil's faces again, he seemed to threaten me for laughing; saying in French, this was an affair I should have little reason to laugh at; at this, I laughed again, letting him see that I scorned him; and turning to the merchant, 'Sir,' says I, <Q>“that those jewels were belonging to Mr. Dazzle, the English Jeweller; in that, says I, this person is right; but that I should be questioned how I came to have them, is a token of his ignorance; which, however, he might have managed with a little more good manners, till I had told him who I am; and both he, and you too, will be more easy in that part, when I should tell you, that I am the unhappy widow of that Mr Daz∣zle, who was so barbarously murdered going to Versailles; and that he was not robbed of those jewels, but of others; my husband, having left those behind him with me, lest he should be robbed; had I, Sir, come otherwise by them, I should not have been weak enough to have
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
exposed them to sale here, where the fact was” done, but have carried them farther off.</Q></P>
<P>This was an agreeable surprize to the merchant, who being an honest man himself, believed every thing I said, which indeed, being all really and literally true, except the deficiency of my marriage, I spoke with such an unconcern∣ed easiness, that it might plainly be seen, that I had no guilt upon me, as the Jew suggested.</P>
<P>The Jew was confounded when he heard that I was the jeweller's wife; but as I had raised his passion, with saying he looked at me with a devil's race, he studied mischief in his heart, and answer∣ed, 'That should not serve my turn;' so called Mr. Vandunc out again; when he told him, that he resolved to prosecute this matter farther.</P>
<P>There was one kind chance in this affair, which indeed, was my deliverance, and that was, that the fool could not restrain his passion, but must let it fly to the Dutch Merchant; to whom, when they withdrew a second time, he told, that he would bring a process against me for the murder; and that it should cost me dear, for using him at that rate; and away he went, desir∣ing the Merchant to tell him when I would be there again. Had he suspected that Mr. Van∣dunc would have communicated the particulars to me, he would never have been so foolish as to have mentioned that part to him.</P>
<P>But the malice of his thoughts anticipated him, and the Merchant was so good as to give me an account of his design, which indeed was wicked enough in its nature; but to me it would have been worse, than otherwise it would to ano∣ther; for upon examination, I could not have proved myself to be the wife of the Jeweller, so the
<PB N="131" REF="145"/>
suspicion might have been carried on with the better face; and then I should also have brought all his relations in England upon me; who find∣ing by the proceedings, that I was not his wife, but a mistress, would immediately have laid claim to the jewels, as I had owned them to be his.</P>
<P>This thought immediately rushed into my mind, as soon as the Merchant had told me what wicked things were in the head of that cursed Jew; and the villain convinced the Merchant that he was in earnest, by an expression which shewed the rest of his design, and that was, a plot to get the rest of the jewels into his hands.</P>
<P>When first he hinted to Mr. Vandunc, that the jewels were such a man's, meaning my husband's, he made wonderful explanations on account of their having been concealed so long; where must they have lain? and what was the woman that brought them? and that she, meaning me, ought to be immediately apprehended, and put into the hands of justice; and this was the time that, as I said, he made such horrible gestures, and looked at me so like a devil.</P>
<P>The merchant hearing him talk at that rate, and seeing him in earnest, said to him, <Q>“hold your tongue a little, this is a thing of conse∣quence; if it be so, let you and I go into the next room, and consider of it there; and so they withdrew, and left me.”</Q></P>
<P>Here, as before, I was uneasy, and called him out, and having heard how it was, gave him that answer, 'that I was his widow,' which the mali∣cious Jew said, should not serve my turn; and then it was, that the Merchant called him out again; and in this time of his withdrawing, the
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>
Merchant finding that he was really in earnest, counterfeited a little to be of his mind, and enter∣ed into proposals with him for the thing itself.</P>
<P>In this they agreed to go to an advocate, or counsel for directions how to proceed, and to meet again the next day; against which time the Mer∣chant was to appoint me to come again with the jewels, in order to sell them. 'No,' says the Merchant, <Q>“I will go farther with her than so; I will desire her to leave the jewels with me, to show to another person, in order to get a better price for them:' 'That is right,' says the Jew, and I will engage she shall never be mistress of” them again; they shall either be seized by us,'</Q> says he, <Q>“in the King's name, or she shall be glad to give them up to us, to prevent her being put to the torture.”</Q></P>
<P>The Merchant said yes to every thing he offer∣ed, and they agreed to meet the next morning about it, and I was to be persuaded to leave the jewels with him, and come to them the next day, at four o'clock, in order to make a good bar∣gain for them; and on these conditions they parted; but the honest Merchant, filled with in∣dignation at the barbarous design, came directly to me, and told me the whole story; 'and now, madam,' says he, 'you are to consider immedi|'ately what you have to do.'</P>
<P>I told him, if I was sure to have justice, I would not fear all that such a rogue could do to me; but how such things were carried on in France, I knew not. I told him the greatest difficulty would be to prove our marriage, for that it was done in England, and in a remote part of Eng∣land too, and which was worse, it would be hard
<PB N="133" REF="147"/>
to produce authentick vouchers of it, because we were married in private.</P>
<P><Q>“But as to the death of your husband, madam,” what can be said to that?' said he.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay, said I, 'what can they say to it? In England, 'added I, if they would offer such an injury to any one, they must prove the fact, or give just reason for their suspicion; that my hus∣band was murdered, that every one knows; but that he was robbed, of what, or how much, that none knows, no, not myself; and why was I not questioned for it then? I have lived in Paris ever since, excepting a tour I lately made to Italy, and no man had yet the impudence to suggest such a thing of me.”</Q></P>
<P>'I am fully satisfied of that,' says the Mer∣chant; <Q>“but as this is a man who may stick at nothing, what can we say? and who knows what he may swear? Suppose he should swear, that he knew your husband had those particular jewels with him the morning when he went out, and that he shewed them to him, to consider their value, and what price he should ask the Prince for them.”</Q></P>
<P>'Nay, by the same rule,' said I, 'he may swear that 'I murdered my husband, if he finds it for his turn:'</P>
<P><Q>“That is true,' said he; 'and if he should, I do not see what can save you;' but, added he, I have found out his more immediate design; his design is to have you carried to the Chatel∣lette, that the suspicion may appear just; and then to get the jewels out of your hands, if possi∣ble; then, at last, to drop the prosecution, on your consenting to quit the jewels to him; and how you will do to avoid this, is the question which I would have you consider of.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="134" REF="148"/>
“My misfortune, Sir', said I, 'is, that I have no time to consider, and I have no person to con∣sider with, or advise about it; I find, that inno∣cence may be oppressed by such an impudent fellow as this; he that does not value a perjury, has any person's life at his mercy. But Sir, said I, is the justice such here, that while I may be in the hands of the publick, and under prosecution, he may get hold of my effects, and get my jewels into his hands?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I do not know,' says he, 'what may be done in that case; but if not he, if the court of jus∣tice should get hold of them, I do not know but you may find it as difficult to get them out of their hands again; at least, it may cost you half as much as they are worth; so I think it would be a much better way, to prevent them coming at them at all.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But what course can I take to do that,' says I, now they have got notice that I have them? If they get me into their hands, they will oblige me to produce them, or perhaps, sentence me to pri∣son till I do.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Nay,' says he, 'as this brute says too, put you to the question; that is, to the torture, on pretence of making you confess who were the murderers of your husband.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Confess!' said I; 'how can I confess what I know nothing of?”</Q></P>
<P>'If they come to have you to the rack,' said he, <Q>“they will make you confess you did it your∣self, whether you did it or no, and then you are cast.”</Q></P>
<P>The very word rack frighted me to death almost, and I had no spirit left in me. 'Did it myself!' said I; 'that is impossible!'</P>
<P><Q><PB N="135" REF="149"/>
“No, Madam,' says he, 'it is far from im∣possible; the most innocent people in the world have been forced to confess themselves guilty of what they never heard of, much less, had any hand in.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“What then must I do?' said I; 'what would 'you advise me to?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why,' says he, 'I would advise you to be gone. You intended to go away in four or five days, and you may as well go in two days; and if you can do so, I can manage it, that he shall not suspect your being gone for several days af∣ter.”</Q></P>
<P>Then he told me, how the Jew would have me ordered to bring the jewels the next day for sale; and that then he would have me appre∣hended; that he had made the Jew believe he would join with him in his design; and that he would get the jewels into his hands.</P>
<P>Here I desired Mr. Vandunc to go home with me, that he might be assured that what I had said was truth. He complied with my request: and upon his enquiry, he was satisfied that I was really the wi∣dow of Mr. Dazzle, and that the jewels were law∣fully mine.</P>
<P>When we had returned back to his house; <Q>“Now,' says the Merchant, 'I will give you bills for the money you desired immediately, and such as shall not fail of being paid; take your jewels with you, and go this very evening to St. Germains; I will send a man thither with you, and from thence, he shall guide you to∣morrow to Roan, where there lies a ship of mine, just ready to sail for Rotterdam; you shall have your passage in that ship on my account, and I will send orders for him to
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
sail as soon as you are on board, and a letter to my friend at Rotterdam, to entertain and take care of you.”</Q></P>
<P>This was too kind an offer for me, not to be accepted, and be thankful for; and as to going away, I had prepared every thing for parting; so that I had little to do, but to go back, take my boxes and bundles, and my maid Amy, and be gone.</P>
<P>Then the Merchant told me the measures he had resolved to take to delude the Jew, while I made my escape, which were very well contrived. <Q>“First,' said he, 'when he comes to-morrow, I shall tell him, that I proposed to you, to leave the jewels with me, as we agreed: but that you said, you would come and bring them in the afternoon, so that we must stay for you till four o'clock; but then, at that time, I will show a letter from you, as if just come in, where∣in you shall excuse your not coming; for that some company came to visit you, and prevented you; but that you desire me to take care that the Gentleman be ready to buy your jewels; and that you will come to-morrow, at the same hour” without fail.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“When to-morrow is come, we shall wait at the time, but you not appearing, I shall seem much dissatisfied, and wonder what can be the reason; and so we shall agree to go the next day to get out a process against you; but the next day, in the morning, I will send to give him notice that you have been at my house, but he not being there, have made another appoint∣ment, and that I desire to speak with him. When he comes, I will tell him, you appear per∣fectly
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
blind as to your danger; and that you ap∣peared much disappointed that he did not come, though you could not meet the night before; and obliged me to have him here to-morrow at three o'clock. When to-morrow comes, you shall send word, that you are taken so ill, that you cannot come out; but that you will not fail the next day; and the next day you shall neither come or send; for by that time you shall be in Holland, if you please.”</Q></P>
<P>I could not but approve all his measures, seeing they were so well contrived, and in so friendly a manner, for my benefit; and as he seemed to be so very sincere, I resolved to put my life in his hands. Immediately I went to my lodgings, and sent away Amy with such bundles as I had pre∣pared for my travelling; and bringing the key of the lodgings with me, I came back to his house.</P>
<P>When I came to him, he had his bills ready, and we settled. Having secured my jewels he sent me away the same evening in a friend's coach, which he had procured for me, to St. Germains, and the next morning to Roan; he also sent a servant of of his own, on horseback, with me, who pro∣vided every thing for me, and who carried his orders to the Captain of the ship, which lay about three miles below Roan, in the river, and by his directions I went immediately on board. The day after I was on board, the ship went away, and we were out at sea the next day after that; and thus I took my leave of France, and got clear of an ugly business, which, had it gone on, might have ruined me, and sent me back as naked to England, as I was a little before I left it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>A Storm; and an Affair of another kind.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW Amy and I were at leisure to look upon the mischiefs that I had escaped; and had I had any religion, or any sense of a supreme power managing, directing, and governing both causes and events in this world, such a case as this would have given any-body room to have been very thankful to the power who had not only put such a treasure into my hand, but given me such an escape from the ruin that threatened me. But I had none of those things about me; I had indeed, a grateful sense upon my mind of the generous friendship of my deliverer, the Mer∣chant; by whom I was so faithfully served, and by whom, as far as relates to second causes, I was preserved from destruction.</P>
<P>I say, I had a grateful sense upon my mind, of his kindness and faithfulness to me, and I resolved to show him some testimony of it, as soon as I came to the end of my rambles, for I was yet but in a state of uncertainty, and sometimes that gave me a little uneasiness too: I had paper indeed for my money, and he had shewed him∣self very good to me, in conveying me away; but I had not seen the end of things yet; for unless the bills were paid, I might still be a great loser by Mr. Vandune, and he might, per∣haps, have contrived all the affair of the Jew, to put me into a fright, and get me to run away, and that, as if it were to save my life; that if the bills should be refused, I was cheated, with a witness. But these were but surmises, and indeed, were perfectly without cause; for the honest man
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
acted as honest men always do; with an upright and disinterested principle, and with a sincerity not often to he found in the world.</P>
<P>When I passed in the ship between Dover and Calais, and saw beloved England once more un∣der my view; England, which I counted my na∣tive country, being the place I was bred up in; a strange kind of joy possessed my mind, and I had such a longing desire to be there, that I would have given the Master of the ship twenty pistoles to have stood-over, and set me on shore in the Downs; and when he told me he could not do it, that is, that he durst not do it, if I would have given him an hundred pistoles, I secretly wished that a storm would rise, that might drive the ship over to the coast of England, whether they would or not, that I might be set on shore any where upon English ground.</P>
<P>This wicked wish had not been out of my thoughts above two or three hours, but the Mas∣ter steering away to the north, as was his course to do, we lost sight of land on that side, and only had the Flemish shore in view on our right∣hand, or, as the seamen call it, the starboard∣side; and then with the loss of the sight, the wish for landing in England abated; and I con∣sidered how foolish it was to wish myself out of the way of my business; that if I had been on shore in England, I must go back to Holland, on account of my bills, and I having no correspon∣dence there, that I could not have managed it without going myself. But we had not been out of sight of England many hours, before the wea∣ther began to change, the winds whistled, and made a noise, and the seamen said to one another, that it would blow hard at night. It was then a∣bout

two hours before sun-set, and we were passed by Dunkirk, and I think they said we were in sight of Ostend; but then the wind grew high, and the sea swelled, and all things looked terrible, especially to us, that understood nothing but just what we saw before us; in short, night came on, and very dark it was, the wind freshened, and blew harder and harder, and about two hours within night, it blew a terrible storm.</P>
<P>I was not quite a stranger to the sea, having come from Rochelle to England, when I was a child, and went to France afterward; but I began to be alarmed a little with the terrible clamour of the men over my head, for I had never been in a storm, and so had never seen the like, or heard it; and once, offering to look out of the door of the steerage, as they called it, it struck me with such horror, the darkness, the fierceness of the wind, the dreadful height of the waves, and the hurry the Dutch sailors were in, whose language I did not understand, neither when they cursed, or when they prayed; I say, all these things toge∣ther, filled me with terror; and, in short, I began to be very much frighted.</P>
<P>When I was come back into the great-cabin, there sat Amy. When Amy saw me come back, and sit down without speaking, for so I did, she looked two or three times up at me. At last she came running to me: <Q>“Dear Madam! what is the matter! what makes you look so pale? why,” you are not well; what is the matter?</Q> I said nothing still, but held up my hands two or three times. Amy doubled her importunities. Upon that, I said; 'Step to the steerage-door, and look out. So she went immediately, and looked too,
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
as I had bidden her; but the poor girl came back again in the greatest amazement and horror that ever I saw any poor creature in, wringing her hands, and crying she was undone! she was undone! she should be drowned! they were all lost! Thus she ran about the cabin like a mad thing, and so perfectly out of her senses, as any one in such a case could be sup∣posed to be.</P>
<P>I was frighted too: but when I saw the girl in such a terrible agony, it brought me a little to my∣self, and I began to talk to her, and put her in a little hope. I told her, there was many a ship in a storm, that was not cast-away; and I hoped we should not be drowned; that it was true, the storm was very dreadful, but I did not see that the seamen were so much concerned as we were; and so I talked to her as well as I could, though my heart was full enough of it, as well as Amy's, and death began to stare us in the face, aye, and something else too, that is to say, conscience, and my mind was very much disturbed; but I had no∣body to comfort me.</P>
<P>But Amy being in so much worse a condition, that is to say, so much more terrified at the storm than I was, I had something to do to com∣fort her; she was like one distracted, and went raving about the cabin, crying out, she was undone! undone! she should be drowned; and at last, the ship giving a jerk, by the force I suppose of some violent wave, it threw poor Amy quite down, for she was weak enough before with being sea-sick, and as it threw her forward, the poor girl struck her head against the bulk-head, as the sea∣men call it, of the cabin, and laid her as dead as
<PB N="142" REF="156"/>
a stone upon the floor, or deck, that is to say, she was so to all appearance.</P>
<P>I cried out for help; but it had been all one to have cried out on the top of a mountain, where no-body had been within five miles of me; for the seamen were so engaged, and made so much noise, that no-body heard me, or came near me. I opened the great cabbin-door, and looked into the steerage, to cry for help; but there, to en∣crease my fright, were two seamen on their knees, at prayers, and only one man who steered, and he made a groaning noise too, which I took to be saying his prayers, but it seems it was answering to those above, when they called to him, to tell him which way to steer.</P>
<P>Here was no help for me, or for poor Amy, who still lay in such a condition, that I did not know whether she was dead or alive. In this fright I went to her, and lifted her a little way up, setting her on the deck, with her back to the boards of the bulk-head. However, after a great while, she began to revive, and in about half an hour she came to herself, but remembered nothing at first of what had happened to her.</P>
<P>When she recovered, she asked me where she was? I told her, she was in the ship yet, but God knows how long it be might be. 'Why Madam,' says she, 'it not the storm over?'</P>
<P>'No, no,' says I, 'Amy.'</P>
<P><Q>“Why, Madam,' says she, 'it was calm just” now:' meaning when she was in the swooning fit, occasioned by her fall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Calm Amy!' says I, 'it is far from calm; it may be it will be calm by-and-by, when we are all drowned, and gone to Heaven.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="143" REF="157"/>
“Heaven! Madam,' says she; 'what makes you talk so? Heaven! I go to Heaven! No, no, if I am drown'd, I am damn'd! Don't you know what a wicked creature I have been? I have lived a wretched abominable life of vice and wickedness for several years. O Madam, you know it, and God knows it; and now I am to die; to be drowned; O? what will become of me? I am undone for ever! ay, Madam, for ever; to all eternity! O I am lost! I am lost! If I am drowned, I am lost for ever!”</Q></P>
<P>These words, you will suppose, must be so many stabs into the very soul of one in my own case; it immediately occurred to me, 'Poor Amy! 'what art thou, that I am not? what hast thou 'been that I have not been?' Then it came to my remembrance, that I had been worse than Amy, this repeated itself to my thoughts at that very moment; and every one of Amy's cries sounded thus in my ears; <Q>“if thou art lost for ever, what must I be? what must be my por∣tion, who have much more to answer for? and that as we had sinned together; so, now, we were likely to sink together.”</Q></P>
<P>It is true, this difference was between us, that I said all these things within myself, and sighed, and mourned inwardly; but Amy, as her temper was more violent, spoke aloud, and cried, and called out aloud, like one in an agony.</P>
<P>I had but small encouragement to give her, and indeed could say but very little; but I got her to compose herself, and not let any of the people of the ship understand what she meant, or what she said; but even in her greatest composure, she con∣tinued to express herself with the utmost dread and terror, on account of the wicked life she had
<PB N="144" REF="158"/>
lived; and crying out, she should be doomed to eternal punishment; which was very terrible to me, who knew what condition I was in myself.</P>
<P>Upon these serious considerations, I was very penitent too for my former sins, and cried out, though softly, 'Lord have mercy upon me;' to this, I added abundance of resolutions, of what a life I would live, if it should please God but to spare me this time; how I would live a virtuous life, and spend a great deal of what I had thus wickedly got, in acts of charity, and doing good.</P>
<P>Under these dreadful apprehensions, I looked back on the life I had led, with the utmost ab∣horrence; I blushed, and wondered at myself, how I could act thus; how I could divest myself of modesty and honour, and prostitute myself for gain; and I thought, if ever it should please God to spare me this time from death, it would not be possible that I should be the same creature again.</P>
<P>Amy went farther; she prayed, she resolved, she vowed to lead a new life, if God would spare her but this time: it now began to be day-light, for the storm held all night long, and it was some comfort to see the light of another day, which indeed none of us expected; but the sea went mountains high, and the noise of the wa∣ter was as frightful to us as the sight of the waves; nor was any land to be seen; at last, to our great joy, they made land, which was on the coast of Suffolk; and the ship being in the utmost distress, they ran for the shore, at all hazards, and, with great difficulty, got into Harwich, where they were safe, as to the danger of death; but the ship was so full of water, and so much damaged, that if they had not laid her on shore the same
<PB N="145" REF="159"/>
day, she would have sunk before night, according to the opinion of the seamen, and of the work∣men on shore too, who were hired to assist them in stopping their leaks.</P>
<P>Amy was revived as soon as she heard they had espied land, and went out upon the deck; but she soon came in again to me. 'O Madam,' says she, <Q>“there's the land indeed to be seen, it looks like a ridge of clouds, and may be all a cloud for ought I know, but if it be land, it is a great way off; and the sea is in such a commotion, we shall all perish before we can reach it; 'tis the dreadfullest sight to look at the waves, that ever was seen; why, they are as high as moun∣tains; we shall certainly be all swallowed up, for all the land is so near.”</Q></P>
<P>I had conceived some hope, that if they saw land, we should be delivered; and I told her, she did not understand things of that nature; that she might be sure, if they saw land, they would go directly towards it, and would make into some harbour; but it was, as Amy said, a frightful dis∣tance to it. The land looked like clouds, and the sea went as high as mountains, so that no hope appeared in the seeing the land; but we were in fear of foundering before we could reach it; this made Amy so desponding still: but as the wind, which blew from the Fast, drove us fu∣riously towards the land; so when, about half an hour after, I stepped to the steerage-door, and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked out, I saw the land much nearer than Amy represented it; then I went in, and encou∣raged Amy again, and indeed, was encouraged myself.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="160"/>
In about an hour we could see, to our infinite satisfaction, the open harbour of Harwich, and the vessel standing directly towards it, and in a few minutes more, the ship was in smooth water, to our inexpressible comfort; and thus I had, though against my will, and contrary to my true interest, what I wished for, to be driven away to England, though it was by a storm.</P>
<P>This incident did neither Amy or me much service; for the danger being over, the fears of death vanished with it; ay, and our fear of what was beyond death also: our sense of the life we had lived, went off, and with our return to life, our wicked taste of life returned, and we were both the same as before. So certain is it, that the repentance which is brought about by the meer apprehensions of death, wears off as those apprehensions wear off; and death-bed repent∣ance, or storm-repentance, which is much the same, is seldom sincere.</P>
<P>However, I do not tell you that this was all at once, neither; the fright we had at sea lasted a little while afterwards, at least, the impression was not quite blown off as soon as the storm; espe∣cially poor Amy, as soon as she set her foot on shore, she fell flat upon the ground, and kissed it, and gave God thanks for her deliverance from the sea; and turning to me when she got up, 'I 'hope, Madam, you will never go upon the sea 'again.'</P>
<P>I know not what ailed me; but Amy was much more penitent at sea, and much more sen∣sible of her deliverance when she landed, and was safe, than I was. I was in a kind of stupidity, I know not what well to call it; I had a mind full of horror in the time of the storm, and saw
<PB N="147" REF="161"/>
death before me as plainly as Amy, but my thoughts got no vent, as Amy's did; I had a silent sullen kind of grief, which could not break out either in words or tears, and which was, therefore, much the worse to bear.</P>
<P>I had a terror upon me for my wicked life past, and firmly believed I was going to the bot∣tom, launching into death, where I was to give an account of all my past actions; and in this state, and on that account, I locked back upon my wickedness with abhorrence. But I had no sense of repentance, from the true motive of re∣pentance; I saw nothing of the corruption of na∣ture, the sin of my life, as an offence against God; as a thing odious to the holiness of his being; as abusing his mercy, and despising his goodness. In short, I had no thorough effectual repentance; no sight of my sins in their proper shape; no view of a Redeemer, or hope in him: I had only such a repentance as a criminal has at the place of ex∣ecution, who is sorry, not that he has committed the crime, as it is a crime, but sorry that he is to suffer for it.</P>
<P>It is true, Amy's repentance wore off too, as well as mine, but not so soon: however, we were both very grave for a time.</P>
<P>As soon as we could get a boat from the town, we went on shore, and immediately went to a publick-house in the town of Harwich, where we were to consider seriously what was to be done, and whether we should go up to London, or stay till the ship was refitted, which, they said, would be a fortnight, and then go for Holland, as we in∣tended, and as business required.</P>
<P>Reason directed that I should go to Holland, for there I had all my money to receive, and there
<PB N="148" REF="162"/>
I had persons of good reputation and character to apply to, having letters to them from Mr. Vandunc, and they might, perhaps, give me a recommendation again to merchants in London, and so I should get acquaintance with some people of figure, which was what I loved; whereas now I knew not one creature in the whole city of London, or any-where else, that I could go and make myself known to. Upon these considerations, I resolved to go to Holland.</P>
<P>But Amy cried and trembled, and was ready to fall into fits, when I did but mention going upon the sea again, and begged of me not to go, or if I would go, that I would leave her behind, tho' I was to send her a begging. The people in the inn laughed at her, and jested with her; asked her if she had any sins to confess, that she was ashamed to be heard of? and that she was trou∣bled with an evil conscience; told her if she came to sea, and to be in a storm, if she had lain with her master, she would certainly tell her mistress of it; and that it was a common thing for girls to confess all the young men they had lain with; that there was one poor girl that went over with her mistress, whose husband was a mercer in Cheapside, who confessed, in the terror of a storm, that she had lain with her master so often, and in such and such places, that made the poor mistress, when she returned to London, fly at her husband, and make such a bustle, as was almost the ruin of the whole family.</P>
<P>I thought Amy's fear would have been over by that time the ship would be gotten ready, but I found the girl was rather worse and worse; and when I came to the point, that we must go on board, or lose the passage, Amy was so terrified,
<PB N="149" REF="163"/>
that she fell into fits; so the ship went away with∣out us.</P>
<P>But my going being absolutely necessary, I was obliged to go in the packet-boat some time after, and leave Amy behind at Harwich, but with di∣rections to go to my children, and stay with them, to receive letters and orders from me what to do: accordingly, I supplied her with a sufficient sum of money for all expences, and to pay whatever was owing.</P>
<P>Now I was become, from a woman given up to pleasures, a woman of business, and of great bu∣siness too, I assure you.</P>
<P>I got me a servant at Harwich, to go over with me, who had been at Rotterdam, knew the place, and spoke the language, which was a great help to me, and away I went. I had a very quick pas∣sage, and pleasant weather; and coming to Rotter∣dam, soon found out the merchant to whom I was recommended, who received me with extraordinary respect. And first he acknowledged the accepted bill for four thousand pistoles, which he afterwards paid punctual<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; other bills that I had also pay∣able at Amsterdam, he procured to be received for me; and whereas one of the bills for one thousand two hundred crowns was protested at Amsterdam, he paid it me himself, for the honour of the indor∣ser, as he called it, which was my friend Mr. Van∣dunc.</P>
<P>There I entered into a negotiation by his means, for my jewels, and he brought me several jewellers, to look on them, and particularly one to value them.</P>
<P>All this work took me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> half a year, and by managing my business <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus myself, and having large sums to do with, I became as expert in it, as
<PB N="150" REF="164"/>
any the-merchant of them all; I had credit in the bank for a large sum of money, and bills and notes for much more.</P>
<P>After I had been here about three months, my maid Amy writes me word, that she had received a letter from her friend, as she called him; that, by the way, was the Prince's gentleman, that had been Amy's extraordinary friend indeed; for Amy owned to me, that he had lain with her as often as he pleased, for the seven years which that affair lasted. This was what she called her friend, who she corresponded with upon this particular subject; and among other things, sent her this par∣ticular news, that my husband, Mr. Bacon, the Brewer, who rode in the Gens d' Arms, was dead; that he was killed in a rencounter, as they call it, or accidental scuffle among the troopers; and so the jade congratulated me upon my being now a free woman; <Q>“And now, Madam,' says she, at the end of her letter, 'you have nothing to do but to come hither, and set up a coach; and if beauty and a good fortune will not make” you a dutchess, nothing will.'</Q> But I had not fixed my measures yet; I had no inclination to be a wife again, I had had such bad luck with my first husband, I hated the thoughts of a second. I found that a wife is treated with indifference, a mistress with a strong passion. A wife is looked upon as but an upper servant, a mistress as a so∣vereign; a wife must give up all she has; have every reserve she makes for herself be thought hard of, and be upbraided with her very pin-mo∣ney; whereas a mistress makes the saying true, <Q>“that what the man has, is her's, and what she” has is her own.'</Q> The wife bears a thousand in∣sults, and is forced to sit still and bear it, or part
<PB N="151" REF="165"/>
and be undone. A mistress insulted, helps herself immediately, and takes another.</P>
<P>These were my wicked arguments for inconti∣nency, for I never set against them the difference another way, I may say, every other way; how that, first, a wife appears boldly and honourably with her husband; lives at home, and possesses his house, his servants, his eq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipages, and has a right to them all, and to call them her own; entertains his friends, owns his children, and has the return of duty and affection from them, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are here her own, and claims upon his estate, by the custom of England, if he dies, and leaves her a widow.</P>
<P>The prostitute seulks about in lodgings; is vi∣sited in the dark; disowned upon all occasions, be∣fore God and man; is maintained indeed, for a time, but is condemned to be abandoned at last, and left to the miseries of fate, and her own just disaster. If she has any children, her endeavour is to get rid of them, and not maintain them; and if she lives, she is certain to see them all hate her, and be ashamed of her. While the vice rages, and the man is in the devil's hand, she has him; and while she has him, she makes a prey of him: but if he happens to fall sick; if any disaster befals him, the cause of all lies upon her; he is sure to lay all his misfortunes at her door; and if once he comes to repentance, or makes but one step towards a reformation, he begins with her; leaves her; uses her as she deserves; hates her; abhors her; and sees her no more; and that with this never∣failing addition, namely, That the more sincere and unfeigned his repentance is, the more earnest∣ly he looks up; and the more effectually he looks in, the more his aversion to her, encreases; and he curses her from the bottom of his soul; nay, it
<PB N="152" REF="166"/>
must be from a kind of excess of charity, if he so much as wishes God may forgive her.</P>
<P>I was surprised one morning, when being at the merchant's house, who he had recommend me to, in Rotterdan, and being busy in his compting-house, managing my bills, and preparing to write a letter to him, to Paris, I heard a noise of horses at the door; which is not very common in a city, where every body passes by water; but he had, it seems, ferried over the Maez from Williamstadt, and so came to the very door; and I looking to∣wards the door, upon hearing the horses, saw a gentleman alight, and come in at the gate. I knew nothing, and expected nothing, to be sure, of the person; but, as I say, was surprised, and indeed, more than ordinarily surprised, when, com∣ing nearer to me, I saw it was my Merchant at Paris; my benefactor; and indeed, my deliverer, Mr. Vandunc.</P>
<P>I confess, it was an agreeable surprise to me, and I was exceeding glad to see him, who was so honourable and so kind to me, and who indeed had saved my life. As soon as he saw me, he run to me, took me in his arms, and kissed me, with a freedom that he never offered to take with me before. <Q>“Dear Mrs. Dazzle,' says he, 'I am glad to see you safe in this country; if you had stayed two days longer at Paris, you had been” undone.'</Q> I was so glad to see him, that I could not speak a good while, and I burst out into tears, without speaking a word for a minute; but I recovered that disorder, and said, 'The more, Sir, is my obligation to you, that saved my life;' and added, <Q>“I am glad to see you here, that I may consider how to ballance an account, in which I am so much your debtor.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="167"/>
'You and I will adjust that matter easily,' says he, 'now we are so near together. Pray where do 'lodge, Madam?'</P>
<P><Q>“In a very honest good house, Sir,' said I, 'where” that gentleman your friend recommended me;'</Q> pointing to the merchant in whose house we then were.</P>
<P>'And where you may lodge too, Sir,' says the Gentleman, 'if it suits with your business, and 'your other conveniency.'</P>
<P><Q>“With all my heart,' says he; 'then Madam, I shall be near you, and have time to tell you a story, which will be very long, and yet many ways very pleasant to you, how trouble∣some that fellow the Jew, has been to me, on your account; and what a snare he had laid for you, if he could have found you.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I shall have leisure too, Sir,' said I, 'to tell you all my adventures since that; which have not been a few, I assure you.”</Q></P>
<P>In short, he took up his lodgings in the same house where I lodged and the room he lay in, opened just opposite to mine; and I was not at all shy of him on that score, for I believed him per∣fectly honest, and so indeed he was; and if he had not, that article was at present no part of my concern.</P>
<P>First, I gave him a particular account of every thing that has been already related; and added, but that money, he might see, would make a wo∣man go any where.</P>
<P>He seemed to laugh at all our womanish fears, upon the occasion of the storm; telling me, it was nothing but what is very ordinary in those seas; but that they had harbours on every coast, so near, that they were seldom in danger of being
<PB N="154" REF="168"/>
lost; for if they cannot fetch one coast, they can always stand for another, and run afore it, as he called it, for one side or the other. But when I came to tell him, that when I looked out at the cabin-door, I saw the Dutchmen, one upon his knees here, and another there, at their prayers, then indeed, he acknowledged I had reason to be alarmed; but smiling, he added, <Q>“but you, Ma∣dam,' says he, 'are so good a lady, and so pious, you would but have gone to heaven a little the sooner, the difference had not been much to you.”</Q></P>
<P>I confess, when he said this, it made all the blood turn in my veins, and I thought I should have fainted. Poor Gentleman! thought I, you know little of me; what would I give to be really what you really think me to be! He perceived the disorder, but said nothing till I spoke; when shak∣ing my head, <Q>“O Sir!' said I, 'death in any shape has some terror in it; but in the frightful figure of a storm at sea, and a sinking ship, it comes with a double, a treble, and indeed, an inexpressible horror; and if I were that saint you think me to be, which, God knows, I am not, it is still very dismal. I desire to die in a calm, if” I can.'</Q> He said a great many goods things, and very prettily ordered his discourse, between serious reflection and compliment; but I had too much guilt to relish it as it was meant, so I turned it off to something else; and talked of the necessity I had on me to come to Holland; but I wished my∣self safe on shore in England again.</P>
<P>He told me, he was glad I had such an obliga∣tion upon me to come over into Holland how∣ever; but hinted, that he was so interested in my welfare, and besides, had such farther designs upon
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>
me, that if I had not so happily been found in Holland, he was resolved to have gone to England to see me; and that it was one of the principal rea∣sons of his leaving Paris.</P>
<P>I told him, I was extremely obliged to him for so far interesting himself in my affairs; but that I had been so far his debtor before, that I knew not how any thing could encrease the debt; for I owed my life to him already, and I could not be in debt for any thing more valuable than that.</P>
<P>He answered in the most obliging manner pos∣sible, that he would put it in my power to pay that debt, and all the obligations besides, that ever he had, or should be able to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I began to understand him now, and to see plainly, that he resolved to make love to me; but I would by no means seem to take the hint, and besides, I knew that he had a wife with him in Paris; and I had, just then, at least, no taste to any more intriguing; however, he surprised me into a sudden notice of the thing a little while after, by saying something in his discourse, that he did, as he said, in his wife's days; I started at that word; 'What mean you, Sir!' have you 'not a wife at Paris?'</P>
<P><Q>“No, Madam, 'indeed,' said he, 'my wife died the beginning of September last, which it seems was but a little after I came away.”</Q></P>
<P>We lived in the same house all this while; and as we lodged not far off of one another, opportu∣nities were not wanting of as near an acquaintance as we might desire; nor have such opportunities the least agency in vicious minds, to bring to pass even what they might not intend at first.</P>
<P>However, though he courted so much at a di∣stance, yet his pretensions were very honourable;
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>
and as I had before found him a most disinterested friend, and perfectly honest in his dealings, even when I trusted him with all I had; so now I found him strictly virtuous, till an opportunity offered, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>It was not long after our former discourse, when he repeated what he had insinuated before, name∣ly, that he had yet a design to lay before me, which, if I would agree to his proposals, would more than balance all accounts between us. I told him, I could not reasonably deny him any thing; and except one thing, which I hoped and believed he would not think of, I should think myself very ungrateful if I did not do every thing for him that lay in my power.</P>
<P>He told me what he should desire of me, would be fully in my power to grant, or else he should be very unfriendly to offer it, and still, all this while, he declined making the proposal, as he called it, and so, for that time, we ended our discourse, turning it off to other things; so that, in short, I began to think he might have met with some dis∣aster in his business, and might have come away from Paris in some discredit; or had had some blow on his affairs in general; and as really I had kindness enough to have parted with a great sum to have helped him, and was in gratitude bound to have done so, he having so effectually saved to me all I had; so I resolved to make him the offer the first time I had an opportunity, which, two or three days after, offered itself very much to my satisfaction.</P>
<P><Q>“Sir,' said I, 'it is but just, that what expence you have been obliged to be at, which was all on my account, should be repaid you; and there∣fore, let me see—”</Q> and there I paused, and be∣gan
<PB N="157" REF="171"/>
to reckon up what I had observed, from his own discourse, it had cost him in the several dis∣putes, and hearings, which he had with that fellow of a Jew, and I cast them up at about two thousand crowns; so I pulled out some bills which I had upon a merchant in Amsterdam, and a particular account in bank, and was look∣ing on them, in order to give them to him.</P>
<P>When he seeing evidently what I was going about, interrupted me with some warmth, and told me, he would have nothing of me on that ac∣count, and desired I would not pull out my bills and papers on that score; that he had not told me the story with any such view; that it had been his misfortune first to bring that rogue to me, which, though it was with a good design, yet he would punish himself with the expence he had been at, for his being so unlucky to me; that I could not think so hard of him, as to suppose he would take money of me, a widow, for serving me, and do∣ing acts of kindness to me in a strange country, and in distress too; but he said he would repeat what he had said before, that he kept me for a deeper reckoning, and that, as he had told me, he would put me into a way to even all that favour, as I called it, at once; so we should talk it over another time, and ballance all together.</P>
<P>Now I expected it would come out, but still he put it off, from whence I concluded, it could not be matter of love, for that those things are not usually delayed in such a manner, and therefore it must be matter of money; upon which thought I broke the silence, and told him, that as he knew I had, by obligation, more kindness for him, than to deny any favour to him that I could grant, and that he seemed backward to mention his case; I
<PB N="158" REF="172"/>
begged of him to give me leave to ask him, whether any thing lay upon his mind, with respect to his business and effects in the world? that if it did, he knew what I had, as well as I did; and that if he wanted money, I would let him have any sum for his occasion, and he should pay me as his own affairs would permit; and that, if he never paid me, I would assure him, that I would never give him any trouble for it.</P>
<P>He rose up with ceremony, and gave me thanks, in terms that sufficiently told me, he had been bred among people more polite, and more courte∣ous, than is esteemed the ordinary usage of the Dutch; and after his compliment was over, he came nearer to me, and told me, that he was o∣bliged to assure me, though with repeated acknow∣ledgments of my kind offer, that he was not in any want of money; that he had met with no uneasiness in any of his affairs, no not of any kind whatever, except that of the loss of his wife, and one of his children, which indeed, had troubled him much; but that this was no part of what he had to offer to me, and by granting which, I should ballance all obligations; but that, it was that seeing providence had taken his wise from him, I would make up the loss to him; and with that, he held me fast in his arms, and kissing me, would not give me leave to say no, and hardly to breathe.</P>
<P>At length, having got room to speak, I told him, that, as I had said before, I could deny him but one thing; I was very sorry he should propose that thing only that I could not grant.</P>
<P>He was long bringing it out; but when he had, he pursued it with such importunities, as would admit of no denial, at least he intended they should
<PB N="159" REF="173"/>
not; but I resisted them obstinately, and yet with expressions of the utmost kindness and respect for him that could be imagined; often telling him, there was nothing else I could deny him, and shew∣ing him all the respect, and upon all occasions treating him with intimacy and freedom, as if he had been my brother.</P>
<P>He tried all the ways imaginable to bring his design to pass, but I was inflexible. At last, as I imagine, he thought of a way, which, he flattered himself, would not fail; nor would he have been mistaken, perhaps, in any other woman but me; this was, as I say I imagine, to try if he could take me at an advantage, and get to-bed to me, and then, as was most rational to think, I should wil∣lingly enough marry him afterwards.</P>
<P>We were so intimate together, that nothing but man and wife could, or at least ought to be, more; but still our freedoms kept within the bounds of modesty and decency. But one evening, above all the rest, we were very merry, for I had been sing∣ing and playing on the harpsichord, and I fancied he designed to watch for his advantage.</P>
<P>About one o'clock in the morning, for so long we sat up together; I said, 'Mr. Vandunc it is 'very late, I must go to bed.'</P>
<P>'Well,' says he, 'I will go with you.'</P>
<P>'No, no, thank you Sir,' says I; 'go to your 'own chamber:' and wishing him a good night I lest him.</P>
<P>I had not been in bed two minutes, but he comes to my bed-chamber door, and opens it a little way, and says softly; 'What, are you really 'in bed?'</P>
<P>'Yes, yes,' says I; 'get you gone.' So he comes into the room, fastens the door, and immediately
<PB N="160" REF="174"/>
came to the bed-side, and took hold of one of my hands? I began to struggle, and with some warmth bid him leave me, and be gone; but, it signified nothing, he did not regard it; so he throws off his gown and slippers, opened the bed-clothes, and came into my bed to me, in an instant.</P>
<P>Here I must draw a shade, and, though I made some resistance, must confess the frailty of nature, for this night, and the two following.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>An Incident very uncommon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the third night, Mr. Vandunc began to be very grave and solemn. <Q>“Now, my dear, though I have carried this matter farther than ever I intended; or than, I believe, you expect∣ed from me, who never made any pretences to you but what were honourable; yet to heal it all up, and let you see how sincerely I meant at first, and how honest I will ever be to you, I am ready to marry you still, and desire you to let it be done to-morrow morning; and I will give you the same fair conditions of marriage as I” would have done before.</Q></P>
<P>This, it must be owned, was a testimony that he was very honest, and that he loved me sincere∣ly; but I construed it quite another way, name∣ly, that he aimed at my money. But how sur∣prised did he look! and how was he confounded, when he found me receive his proposal with cold∣ness and indifference! and still tell him, that it was the only thing I could not grant!</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="175"/>
He was astonished! <Q>“What! not take me now!”</Q> says he, <Q>“When I have been a-bed with you!”</Q> I answered coldly, though respectfully still, <Q>“It is true, to my shame,”</Q> says I; <Q>“that you have taken me by surprise; but I hope you will not take it ill that I cannot consent to marry, for all that; I hope you will not expose me, for my having exposed myself, but I cannot go any farther.”</Q> And at that point I stood, and would hear of no matrimony by any means.</P>
<P>Now because this may seem a little odd, I shall state the matter clearly, as I understood it my∣self. I knew that while I was a mistress, it is customary for the person kept, to receive from them that keep; but if I should be a wife, all I had then was given up to the husband, and I was thenceforth to be under his authority on∣ly; and as I had money enough, and was in no fear of being what they call a cast-off mistress, so I had no need to give him twenty thousand pounds to marry me, which had been buying my lodging too dear a great deal.</P>
<P>Thus his project of coming to-bed to me, was a trick upon himself, while he intended it for a trick upon me; and he was no nearer his aim of marrying me, than he was before; all his argu∣ments he could urge upon the subject of matri∣mony were at an end, for I positively declined marrying him; and as he had refused the two thousand crowns which I had offered him in com∣pensation for his expences and loss with the Jew, and had done it upon the hopes he had of mar∣rying me; so when he found his way difficult still, he was amazed, and, I had some rea∣son to believe, repented that he had refused the money.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="176"/>
But thus it is when men run into wicked mea∣sures, to bring their designs about. I that was in∣finitely obliged to him before, began to talk to him, as if I had ballanced accounts with him now; and that the favour of lying with me, was equal, not to the two thousand crowns only, but to all the debt I owed him, for saving my life, and all my effects.</P>
<P>But he drew himself into it, and though it was a dear bargain, yet it was a bargain of his own making. He could not say I had tricked him into it; but as he projected and drew me in to lie with him, depending that it was a sure game in order to a marriage, so I granted him the fa∣vour, as he called it, to ballance the account of favours received from him, and keep the two thousand crowns with a good grace.</P>
<P>He was extremely disappointed in this article, and, I dare say, if he had not expected to have made it an earnest for marrying me, he would never have attempted me the other way; so, I believed, if it had not been for the money, which he knew I had, he would never have desired to marry me after he had lain with me. For, where is the man that cares to marry a strumpet, though of his own making? And as I knew him to be no fool, so I did him no wrong, when I supposed that, but for the money, he would not have had any thoughts of me that way; espe∣cially after my yielding as I had done; in which it is to be remembered, that I made no capitula∣tion for marrying him, when I yielded to him, but let him do just what he pleased, without any previous bargain.</P>
<P>Hitherto we went upon guesses at one-another's designs; but as he continued to importune me
<PB N="163" REF="177"/>
still to marry, though he had lain with me, and still did lie with me as often as he pleased, and I continued to refuse to marry him, though I let him lie with me whenever he desired it; I say, as these two circumstances made up our conver∣sation, it could not continue long thus, but we must soon come to an explanation.</P>
<P>One morning, he sighed, and told me, he de∣sired my leave to ask me one question, and that I would give him an answer to it with the same ingenuous freedom and honesty, that I had used to treat him with. I told him I would. His question was; why I would not marry him, seeing I allowed him all the freedom of a husband? <Q>“Or,' says he, 'my dear, since you have been so kind as to take me to your bed, why will you not make me your own, and take me for good-and-all, that we may enjoy ourselves, without any reproach to one-another.”</Q></P>
<P>I told him, that as I consessed it was the only thing I could not comply with him in, so it was the only thing in all my actions, that I could not give him a reason for; but it was evident, and he might see it, that as I was sensible of the obli∣gation I was under to him, I could deny him no∣thing; and if I had had any greater favour to yield him, I should have done it, that of matri∣mony only excepted, and he could not but see that I loved him to an extraordinary degree, in every part of my behaviour to him; but that as to marrying, which was giving up my liberty, it was what once he knew I had done, and he had seen how it had hurried me up and down in the world, and what it had exposed me to; that I had an aversion to it, and desired he would not insist upon it; he might easily see I had no a∣version
<PB N="164" REF="178"/>
to him; and that if I was with child by him, he should see a testimony of my kindness to the father by my well providing for the child.</P>
<P>He was silent a good-whii<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. At last, says he, <Q>“Come, my dear, you are I believe the first wo∣man in the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that ever lay with a man, and then refused to marry him, and therefore there must be some other reason for your refusal; and I have therefore one other request, and that is, if I guess at the true reason, and remove the objecti∣on,” will you then yield to me?'</Q> I told him, if he removed the objection, I must needs comply, for I should certainly do every thing I had no ob∣jection against.</P>
<P><Q>“Why then, my dear, it must be, that either you are already engaged, and married to some o∣ther man, or you are not willing to dispose of your money to me, and expect to advance your∣self higher with your fortune; now, if it be the first of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, my mouth will be stopped, and I have no more to say; but if it be the last, I am prepared effectually to remove the objection, and answer all you can say on that subject.”</Q></P>
<P>I took him up short at the first of these; tel∣ling him, he must have base thoughts of me indeed, to think that I could yield to him in such a manner as I had done, and continue it with so much freedom, as he found I did, if I had a husband, or were engaged to any other man; and that he might depend upon it, that was not my case, nor any part of my case.</P>
<P><Q>“Why then,' said he, 'as to the other, I have an offer to make to you, that shall take off all the objection; that is, that I will not touch one shil∣ling of your estate, more, than shall be with your own voluntary consent; neither now,
<PB N="165" REF="179"/>
or at any other time, but you shall settle it as you please for your life, and upon who you please after your death; that I should see he was able to maintain me without it; and that it was not for my money, that he followed” me from Paris</Q></P>
<P>I was indeed, surprised at that part of his of∣fer, and he might easily perceive it; it was not only what I did not expect, but it was what I knew not what answer to make to. He had in∣deed removed my principal objection, nay, all my objections, and it was not possible for me to give any answer; for if upon so generous an offer I should agree with him, I then did as good as confess, that it was upon the ac∣count of my money that I refused him; and that though it was true, yet was really too gross for me to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I told him, I had, perhaps, different notions of matrimony, from what the received custom had given us of it; that I thought a woman was a free agent, as well as a man, and was born free, and could she manage herself suitably, might en∣joy that liberty to as much purpose as the men do; that the laws of matrimony were indeed otherwise, and mankind at that time, acted quite upon other principles; that the very nature of the marriage-contract was, in short, nothing but giving up liberty, estate, authority, and every thing to the man, and the woman was in∣deed, a mere woman ever after, that is to say, a slave.</P>
<P>He replied, that though in some respects it was as I had said, yet I ought to consider, that as an equivalent to this, the man had all the care
<PB N="166" REF="180"/>
of things devolved upon him; that the weight of business lay upon his shoulders, and as he had the trust, so he had the toil of life upon him, his was the labour, his the anxiety of living; that the woman had nothing to do but to sit still, and look round her; be waited on, and made much of; be served, and loved, and made easy; and that, in general, the labour of the man was appointed to make the woman live quiet and un∣concerned in the world; that they had the name of subjection, without the thing; for in general, the women had only the care of managing, that is, spending what their husbands get; and that a woman had the name of subjection indeed, but that they generally commanded not the men only, but all they had; managed all for themselves, and where the man did his duty, the woman's life was all ease and tranquility.</P>
<P>I returned, that while a woman was single, she had the full command of what she had, and the full direction of what she did; that she was con∣trouled by none, because accountable to none, and was in subjection to none; so I sung these two lines:</P>
<Q><L>O! 'tis pleasant to be free,</L>
<L>The sweetest Miss is Liberty.</L></Q>
<P>I added, that whatever the woman was, that had an estate, and would give it up to be the slave of a man, that woman was a fool, and must be fit for nothing but a beggar; that it was my opinion, a woman was as fit to govern and enjoy her own estate, without a man, as a man was without a woman.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="181"/>
All he could say, could not answer the force of this, as to argument; only this, that the other way was the ordinary method that the world was guided by; that he had reason to expect I should be content with that which all the world was con∣tented with; that he was of the opinion, that a sincere affection between a man and his wife, an∣swered all the objections that I had made about the being a slave; and where there was a mutual love, there could be no bondage; but that there was but one interest, one aim, one design, and all conspired to make them both happy.</P>
<P><Q>“Ay,' said I, 'that is the thing I complain of; the pretence of affection, takes from a wo∣man every thing that can be called herself; she is to have no interest, no aim, no view; but all is the interest, aim, and view, of the hus∣band. How often have I seen a woman living in all the splendor that a plentiful fortune ought to allow her? with her coaches and equipages; her family, and rich furniture; her attendants and friends; her visiters, and good company, all about her to-day; to-morrow surprized with a disafter; turned out of all by a commission of bankruptcy; stripped to the cloaths on her back; and she turned into the street, and left to live on the charity of her friends, if she has any, or follow her husband into a prison, and live there on the wreck of his fortunes; then she sees her children starve; herself mi∣serable; breaks her heart; and cries herself to death? This,' says I, 'is the state of many a woman that has had some thousand pounds to her portion.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="182"/>
He did not know how feelingly I spoke this; how near I was to the very last article, viz. crying myself to death; and how I really starved for al∣most two years together.</P>
<P>He shook his head, and said, where had I lived? and what dreadful families had I lived among, that had frighted me into such terrible apprehensions of things? that if I would embark with him, he had a fortune equal with mine; that together, we should have no occasion of engaging in business any more; but that in any part of the world where I had a mind to live, whether England, France, Holland, or where I would, we might settle, and lives as happily as the world could make any one live; that if I desired the management of our estate, when put together, if I would not trust him with mine, he would trust me with his; that we would be up∣on one bottom, and I should steer, 'Ay,' says I, 'you will allow me to steer, that is, hold the 'helm, but you will conn the ship, as they call 'it.' That is, as at sea, a boy serves to stand at the helm, but he that gives him the orders, is pilot.</P>
<P><Q>“He laughed at my simile: 'No,' says he, you shall be pilot then, you shall conn the ship.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Ay,' says I, 'as long as you please, but you can take the helm out of my hand when you please. It is not you,' says I, 'that I sus∣pect, but the laws of matrimony puts the power into your hands; bids you do it; com∣mands you to command; and binds me to o∣bey; you, that are now upon even terms with me, and I with you, are the next hour set up upon the throne, and the humble wife
<PB N="169" REF="183"/>
placed at your footstool; all the rest, all that you call oneness of interest, mutual affection, is cour∣tesy and kindness then, and a woman is indeed infinitely obliged where she meets with it; but” cannot help herself where it fails.</Q></P>
<P>Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to the serious part, and there he thought he should be too many for me. He first hinted, that mar∣riage was decreed by Heaven; that it was the fixed state of life, which God had appointed for man's felicity, and for establishing a legal poste∣rity; that there could be no legal claims of estates by inheritance, but by children born in wed∣lock; that all the rest were sunk under scandal and illegitimacy; and very well he talked upon that subject, indeed.</P>
<P>But it would not do: I took him short there. <Q>“Look you, Mr. Vandunc, said I, 'you have an advantage of me there indeed, in my par∣ticular case; but it would not be generous to make use of it. I readily grant, that it were better for me to have married you, than to ad∣mit you to the liberty I have given you: but as I could not reconcile my judgment to marriage, for the reasons above, and had kindness enough for you, and obligation too much on me to resist you, I suffered you to take indecent free∣doms, and gave up my virtue; but I have two things before me to heal up that breach of honour, without that desperate one of mar∣riage; and those are, repentance for what is past, and putting an end to it for the time” to come.</Q></P>
<P>He seemed to be concerned, to think that I should take him in that manner. He assured
<PB N="170" REF="184"/>
me that I misunderstood him; that he had more manners, as well as more kindness for me; and more justice, than to reproach me with what he had been the aggressor in, and had sur∣prised me into.</P>
<P>We strained some compliments upon those points, not worth repeating; and I added, I sup∣posed when he got to-bed to me, he thought himself sure of me; and indeed, in the ordinary course of things, he ought to think so; but that, upon the same foot of argument which I had dis∣coursed with him upon, it was just the contrary; and when a woman had been weak enough to yield up the last point before wedlock, it would be adding one weakness to another, to take the man afterwards; to pin down the shame of it upon herself all the days of her life, and bind her∣self to live all her time with the only man that could upbraid her with it; that in yielding at first, she must be a fool, but to take the man, is to be sure to be called fool; that to resist a man, is to act with courage and vigour, and to cast off the re∣proach, which, in the course of things, drops out of knowledge, and dies; the man goes one way, and the woman another, as fate, and the circumstances of things direct; and if they keep one another's counsel, the folly is heard no more of: <Q>“But to take the man,' says I, 'is the most preposterous thing in nature; and, to use a coarse expression, is to besoil one's-self, and” live always in the scent of it.</Q> No, no,' added I, <Q>“after a man has lain with me as a mistress, he ought never to lie with me as a wife; that is not only preserving the crime in memory, but it is recording it in the family. If the woman marries the man afterwards, she beats the re∣proach
<PB N="171" REF="185"/>
of it to the last hour; if her husband is not a man of a hundred thousand, he some time or other upbraids her with it; if he has children, they fail not, one way or other, to hear of it; if the children are virtuous, they do their mother the justice to hate her for it; if they are wicked, they give her the mortification of doing the like, and giving her for the ex∣ample: On the other hand, if the man and the woman part, there is an end of the crime, and an end of the clamour; time wears out the me∣mory of it; or a woman may remove but a few streets, and she soon outlives it, and hears” no more of it.</Q></P>
<P>He was confounded at this discourse, and told me, he could not say but I was right in the main; that as to that part relat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to managing estates, it was arguing <HI>a la cavalier;</HI> it was in some sense right, if the women were able to carry it on so, but that in general, the sex were not capable of it; their heads were not turned for it, and they had better choose a person capable, and honest, that knew how to do them justice, as women, as well as to love them; and that then the trouble was all taken off their hands.</P>
<P>I told him, it was a dear way of purchasing their ease; for very often when the trouble was taken off their hands, so was their money too; and that I thought it was far safer for the sex not to be afraid of the trouble, but to be really afraid of their money; that if nobody was trusted, no∣body would be deceived; and the staff in their own hands, was the best security.</P>
<P>He replied, that I had started a new thing in the world; that however I might support it by subtle reasoning, yet it was a way of arguing that
<PB N="172" REF="186"/>
was contrary to the general practice, and that he confessed he was much disappointed in it; that had he known I would have made such a use of it, he would never have attempted what he did, which he had no wicked design in, resolving to make me reparation, aad that he was very sorry he had been so unhappy; that he was very sure he should never upbraid me with it hereafter, and had so good an opinion of me, as to believe I did not suspect him; but seeing I was positive in refusing him, notwithstanding what had passed, he had nothing to do but to secure me from re∣proach, by going back again to Paris, that so, according to my own way of arguing, it might die out of memory, and I might never meet with it again to my disadvantage.</P>
<P>I was not pleased with this part, for I had no mind to let him go neither; and yet I had no mind to give him such hold of me as he would have had; and thus I was in a kind of suspence, ir∣resolute, and doubtful what course to take.</P>
<P>I was in the house with him, as I have observed, and I saw evidently that he was preparing to go; and particularly, I found he was remitting money to Paris; I found also, that I was with child, which was what I had not yet told him of; and sometimes I thought not to tell him of it; but I was in a strange place, and had no acquaintance, though I had a great deal of substance, which in∣deed, having no friends there, was the more dan∣gerous to me.</P>
<P>This obliged me to take him one morning, when I saw him, as I thought, a little anxious about his going, and irresolute; says I to him, <Q>“I fancy you can hardly find in your heart to” leave me now.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="173" REF="187"/>
“The more unkind is it in you,' said he, 'se∣verely unkind, to refuse a man that knows not how to part with you.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I am so far from being unkind to you,' said I, that I will go all over the world with you, if you desired me, except to Paris, where you know I cannot go, on account of that rogue the Jew.”</Q></P>
<P>'It is pity so much love,' said he, 'on both 'sides, should ever separate.'</P>
<P>'Why then,' said I, 'do you go away from me?'</P>
<P>'Because,' said he, 'you won't take me.'</P>
<P>'But if I won't take you,' said I, 'you may 'take me any where, but to Paris.'</P>
<P>He was very loth, he said, to go any where with∣out me; but he must go to Paris, or to the East-Indies.</P>
<P>I told him, I did not use to court, but I durst venture myself to the East-Indies with him, if there was a necessity of his going.</P>
<P>He told me, God be thanked, he was in no necessity of going any where, but that he had a tempting invitation to go to the Indies.</P>
<P>I answered, I would say nothing to that; but that I desired he would go any where but to Pa∣ris, because there he knew I must not go.</P>
<P>He said he had no remedy, but to go where I could not go; for he could not bear to see me if he must not have me.</P>
<P>I told him, that was the unkindest thing he could say of me, and that I ought to take it very ill, seeing I knew how very well to oblige him to stay, without yielding to what he knew I could not yield to.</P>
<P>This amazed him, and he said I was pleased to be mysterious; but that he was sure it was in nobody's power to hinder him going, if
<PB N="174" REF="188"/>
he resolved upon it, except me; who had influ∣ence enough upon him to make him do any thing.</P>
<P>Yes, I told him, I could hinder him, because I knew he could no more do an unkind thing by me, than he could do an unjust one; and to put him out of his pain, I told him I was with child.</P>
<P>He came to me, and taking me in his arms, and kissing me, said, why would I be so unkind, not to tell him that before?</P>
<P>I told him, 'twas hard, that, to have him stay, I should be forced to do as criminals do, plead my belly; and that I thought I had given him testi∣monies enough of an affection equal to that of a wife; if I had not only lain with bim; been with child by him; shewn myself unwilling to part with him; but offered to go the East-Indies with him; and except one thing that I could not grant, what could he ask more?</P>
<P>He stood silent a good while; but afterwards told me, he had a great deal more to say, if I could assure him, that I would not take ill what∣ever freedom he might use with me in his dis∣course.</P>
<P>I told him he might use any freedom he pleased with me; for a woman who had given leave to such freedoms as I had done, had left herself but little room to take any thing ill, let it be what it would.</P>
<P><Q>“Why then,' he said, 'I hope you believe I was born a Christian, and that I have some sense of sacred things upon my mind. When I first broke in upon my own virtue, and assaulted yours; when I first surprised, and, as it were, forced you to that which neither you intended,
<PB N="175" REF="189"/>
or I designed, but a few hours before, it was upon a presumption that you would certainly marry me, if once I could go that length with you; and it was with an honest resolution to” make you my wife.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But I have been surprised with such a denial, that no woman in such circumstances ever gave to a man; for certainly it was never known, that any woman refused to marry a man that had first lain with her, much less a man whom she is with child by; but you go upon diffe∣rent notions from all the world; and though you reason upon it so strongly, yet I must own, there is something in it shocking to nature, and something very unkind to yourself; but above all, it is unkind to the child that is yet unborn; who, if we marry, will come into the world with advantage, but if not, is ruined before it is born; must bear the eternal reproach of what it is not guilty of; must be branded from its cradle with a mark of infamy; be loaded with the crimes and follies of its parents, and suffer for sins that it never committed: this I take to be very hard, and indeed cruel to the the poor infant, who you cannot think of with any patience, if you have the common affec∣tion of a mother, and not do that for it, which should at once place it on a level with the rest of the world; and not leave it to curse its pa∣rents for what also we ought to be ashamed of; I cannot, therefore, but beg and intreat you, as you are a Christian and a mother, not to let the innocent lamb you go with, be ruined before it is born, and leave it to curse and reproach us” hereafter, for what may be so easily avoided.</Q></P>

'Then, my dear love,' said he, and em∣bracing me with a world of tenderness, and I thought I saw tears in his eyes, <Q>“allow me to repeat it, that I am a Christian, and conse∣quently I do not approve what I have rashly, and without due consideration, done; I say, I do not approve of it as lawful; and therefore though I did, with a view I have mentioned, one unjustifiable action, I cannot say, that I could satisfy myself to live in a continual prac∣tice of what, in judgment, we must both con∣demn; and though I love you above all the women in the world, and have done enough to convince you of it, by resolving to marry you after what has passed between us, and by offer∣ing to quit all pretensions to any part of your estate, so that I should, as it were, take a wife after I had lain with her, without any portion, which, as my circumstances are, I need not do; I say, notwithstanding my affection to you, which is inexpressible, yet I cannot give up my soul as well as body, the interest of this world, and the hopes of another; and, surely, you cannot call this my disrespect to you.”</Q></P>
<P>If ever any man in the world was truly valuable for the strictest honesty of intention, this was the man; and if ever woman in her senses rejected a man of merit, on so trivial and frivolous a pre∣tence, I was the woman; but surely it was the most preposterous thing that ever woman did. But infatuations are next to being possessed of the devil. I was inflexible, and pretended to argue upon the point of a woman's liberty, as before; but he took me short, and with more warmth than he had yet used with me, though with the utmost respect, replied, <Q>“Dear Madam, you ar∣gue
<PB N="177" REF="191"/>
for liberty at the same time that you restrain yourself from that liberty, which God and na∣ture has directed you to take; and to supply the deficiency, propose a vicious liberty, which is neither honourable or religious; will you pro∣pose liberty at the expence of modesty?”</Q></P>
<P>I replied, with warmth, that he mistook me; and though, by what had passed, he might well cen∣sure me, yet he should find, for the future, that I should freely converse with him without any in∣clination that way.</P>
<P>He told me, he could not promise that for him∣self, and thought he ought not to trust himself with the opportunity; for that, as he had sailed already, he was loth to lead himself into the temptation of offending again; and that this was the true reason of his resolving to go back to Pa∣ris; not that he could willingly leave me, and would be very far from wanting my invitation; but if he could not stay upon terms that became him, either as an honest man, or a Christian, what could he do? and he hoped I could not blame him, that he was unwilling any thing that was to call him father, should upbraid him with leaving him in the world, to be called a bastard; adding, that he was astonished to think how I could satisfy myself to be so cruel to an innocent infant, not yet born; professed he could neither bear the thoughts of it, much less bear to see it, and hoped I would not take it ill that he could not stay to see me delivered, for that very reason.</P>
<P>I saw he spoke this with a disturbed mind, and that it was with some difficulty that he restrained his passion; so I declined any farther discourse upon it; only said, I hoped he would consider of it.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="178" REF="192"/>
“O my dear!' says he, 'do not bid me con∣sider,” 'tis for you to consider;'</Q> and with that he went out of the room in a strange kind of confusion, as was easy to be seen in his counte∣nance, but returned again immediately.</P>
<P>I then told him, I would promise him that it should never come to him to upbraid him with its being illegitimate; that if it was a boy, I would breed it up like the son of a Gentleman, and use it well for his sake; and after a little more such talk, and seeing him resolved to go, I retired, but could not help letting him see the tears run down my cheeks. He came to me, and kissed me; entreated me; conjured me by the pledge of our misfor∣tunes, which I carried with me, and by all that the sincerest affection could propose to do, that I would not drive him away.</P>
<P>But it would not do. I was stupid and sense∣less, deaf to all his importunities, and continued so to the last; so we parted, only desiring me to promise that I would write him word when I was delivered, and how he might give me an an∣swer; and this I engaged my word I would do; and upon his desiring to be informed which way I intended to dispose of myself, I told him, I re∣solved to go directly to England, where I pro∣posed to lye-in; but since he resolved to leave me, I added, I supposed it would be of no conse∣quence to him, what became of me.</P>
<P>He lay in his lodgings that night, but went away early in the morning, leaving me a letter, in which he repeated all he had said; and concluded with moving me to reflect with the same regret as he did, on our follies we had committed together; asked me forgiveness for being the aggressor in the fact; and forgave me every thing, but the cruelty
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>
of refusing him, which he owned he could not for∣give me so heartily as he should do, because he was satisfied it was an injury to myself; and to remem∣ber, that, if my mind should alter, I had a fast friend at Paris, who would not upbraid me with the unkind things past, but would be always ready to return me good for evil.</P>
<P>This letter moved me much, and I cried for several hours after, almost without ceasing about it; and yet, even all this while, whatever it was that bewitched me, I had not one serious wish that I had taken him. I wished heartily indeed, that I could have kept him with me; but I had a mor∣tal aversion to marrying him, or indeed any body else; but formed a thousand wild notions in my head, that I was yet gay enough, and young and handsome enough to please a man of quality here∣after, if I should chuse to change my condition.</P>
<P>Thus, blinded by my own vanity, I threw away the opportunity I then had, to have effectually settled my fortunes, and secured them for this world; and I am a memorial to all that shall read my story, a standing monument of the madness and distraction which pride and infatuations from hell runs us into; how ill our passions guide us; and how dangerously we act, when we follow the dictates of an ambitious mind.</P>
<P>I was rich, beautiful, and as agreeable as ever; I had known something of the influence I had had upon the fancies of men, even of the highest rank. I knew I could make a figure at London, and how well I could grace that figure. But I go back to my immediate circumstances at this time.</P>
<P>I got over the absence of Mr. Vandunc but slowly at first, but it wore off gradually; and as I had a pretty deal of business for managing my ef∣fects,
<PB N="180" REF="194"/>
the hurry of that particular served to divert my thoughts, and, in part, to wear out the impres∣sions which had been made upon my mind.</P>
<P>I had sold my jewels, all but the fine diamond ring, as also the diamond necklace, which the Prince had given me, and a pair of extraordinary ear-rings. So that I had in ready money, and in account in the bank at Amsterdam, above one and twenty thousand pistoles, and how to get this treasure to England was my greatest concern.</P>
<P>Having thus spent nine months in Holland; re∣fused the best offer ever woman in my circumstances had; parted unkindly, and, indeed, barbarously with the best friend, and honestest man in the world; got all my money in my pocket, and a child within me; I took shipping at the Brill, in the packet-boat, and arrived safe at Harwich, where my woman Amy was come, by my directions, to meet me with a coach and four horses.</P>
<P>Here, after Amy giving me a pleasing account of my children, and how much they were grown, she told me she had obeyed my commands, in taking elegant lodgings in Pall-Mall; and had hired me two maids, and a footman, who she had put in livery, according to my orders. So having nothing to do at Harwich, I came away for Lon∣don, with Amy, to my lodgings, where I arrived in very good health, and where I passed for a French lady.</P>
<P>As Amy was the most faithful creature living to me, as the reader is well acquainted with, and knew all my secrets but one; I told her in my journey from Harwich to London, of that one also; viz. my intrigue with Mr. Vandunc, the Dutch Merchant, and what he had offered, and what condition I was in.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="181" REF="195"/>
“Amy,' says I, 'as soon as I conveniently can, I will send you to take lodgings for me at Hackney, where I will pass for a merchant's lady, who is lately come from Paris, and that you only shall attend me there, until I am up again; and the whole to be concealed, both from my children, and the servants; and, to account for so long an abscence, they shall be told that we are both going to York and Scar∣borough.”</Q></P>
<P>The next morning after I came to London, I went with Amy, unknown to my other servants, to see my children, and after many endearments on both sides, I could not refrain from weeping; but, I confess, they were tears of joy, for I could not help admiring the beauty of my eldest daugh∣ter, a woman grown, and as fine a figure as I had ever seen.</P>
<P>In about two months I sent my woman, Amy, to Hackney, concerning the business I have before mentioned, where I had a very convenient and neat first-floor; with respectful and polite usage from the mistress of the house, a young widow, a very fine woman, and extremely engaging, both in her person and manners; with this pleasant companion, I passed away many agreeable hours, during my continuance with her, which may be easily accounted for; I staying chiefly at home, and being not only her lodger, but her boarder also.</P>
<P>When I had been there about three weeks, I was brought to bed of a fine boy, and, according to my promise, sent an account of it to Mr. Van∣dunc, the father of it; and in my letter, told him how sorry I was for his going away, and did as good as intimate, that if he would come once more
<PB N="182" REF="196"/>
to see me, I should use him better than I had done. He gave me a very kind and obliging answer, but took not the least notice of what I had said of his coming over, which was as absolute a denial to me, as he was able to give; so I sat down, I can∣not say contented, but vexed heartily that I had ever made him the offer, for he had, as I may say, his full revenge of me, in scorning to answer, and to let me ask that of him, which he with so much importunity begged of me before.</P>
<P>When my month was expired, I acquainted my good-natured widow, the time was drawing nigh that I should do a violence to myself in the making preparations for my removal to London. This oc∣casioned many polite compliments to pass between us; and though such compliments were highly agreeable to ourselves at the time; yet they would, if related on paper, afford the reader but little sa∣tisfaction now; for which reason I shall take the liberty to omit them.</P>
<P>As I paid the widow to the extent of her expec∣tations, she very affectionately said, at our parting, <Q>“I hope, my lady, that though this is the first, it will not be the last time that I shall have the ho∣nour of your Ladyship's commands.' I answered, Your behaviour, Mrs. Willis, has been so extreme∣ly kind and engaging, that I shall be an enemy to my own happiness to forget it.”</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Here the Name of Roxana was acquired.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WAS now returned to my lodgings in Pall-Mall; and here I began to make a figure suit∣able to my estate; and I shall give you an account of my equipage in a few words, and of myself too.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="197"/>
I paid a hundred pound a year for my new apart∣ments. They were handsome lodgings indeed, and very richly furnished. My equipage was hand∣some, but not very great. I had a coach, a coach∣man, a footman, my woman Amy, who I now dressed and made her my companion, and three maids. I dressed to the height of every mode; went extremely rich in cloaths and jewels. I gave a very good livery laced with silver, and as rich as could be seen. And thus I appeared, leaving the world to guess who or what I was.</P>
<P>I walked sometimes in the Mall with my wo∣man, Amy; but I kept no company, and made no acquaintances, only made as gay a show as I was able to do, and that upon all occasions. I found, however, the world was not altogether so unconcerned about me, as I seemed to be about them. And first, I understood that the neighbours began to be mighty inquisitive about me; as who I was? and what my circumstances were?</P>
<P>Amy was the only person that could answer their curiosity, or give any account of me, and took care to do that with all the art that she was mistress of. She let them know, that I was the widow of a person of quality in France; that I was very rich; that I came over hither to look after an estate that fell to me by some of my rela∣tions who died here; that I was worth fifty thou∣sand pounds, all in my own hands.</P>
<P>I soon found myself thronged with admirers, and I received visits from some persons of very great figure, who always introduced themselves by the help of an old Lady or two, who were now become my intimates. These Ladies were too old to intrigue themselves; at least, I think they were too old for a brisk young fellow to in∣trigue
<PB N="184" REF="198"/>
with them, unless he was amply paid for it. And one of them, I understood afterwards, was set to work on purpose to get into my favour, in order to introduce what followed.</P>
<P>The conversation we had, was generally court∣ly, but civil; at length, some Gentlemen proposed to play, and made, what they called, a party. This it seems, was a contrivance of one of my female hangers-on, for, as I said, I had two of them, who thought this was the way to introduce people as often as she pleased, and so indeed it was. They played high, and stayed late, but begged my pardon, only asked leave to make an appointment for the next night. I was as gay, and as well pleased as any of them; and told my Lord Courtly, that seeing they were doing me the honour of diverting themselves at my apart∣ment, and desired to be there sometimes, I did not keep a gaming-table, but I would give them a little ball the next night, if they pleased; which, they accepted very willingly.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the evening the Gentlemen be∣gan to come, when I let them see, that I under∣stood very well what such things meant. I had a large dining-room in my apartments, with five other rooms on the same floor, all which I made drawing-rooms for the occasion; in three of these I had tables placed, covered with wine and sweet∣meats; the fourth had a table for play; and the fifth was my own room, where I sat, and where I received all the company that came to pay their compliments to me. I was dressed, you may be sure, to all the advantage possible, and had all the jewels on that I was mistress of. My Lord Courtly, to whom I made the invitation, sent me a set of fine music from the Opera-house, and
<PB N="185" REF="199"/>
the Ladies danced, and we began to be merry; when about eleven o'clock I had notice given me, that there were some Gentlemen coming in masquerade.</P>
<P>A-while after, the masks came in, and began with a dance <HI>a la comique,</HI> performing wonder∣fully indeed. While they were dancing, I with∣drew, and left a Lady to answer for me, that I would return immediately. In less than half an hour I returned, dressed in the habit of a Turkish Princess; the habit I got at Leghorn, when the Prince de C—bought me a Turkish slave, as I have said; the dress was extraordinary fine indeed; the robe was a fine Persian, or India damask; the ground white, and the flowers blue and gold, and the train held five yards. The dress under it, was a vest of the same, embroidered with gold, and set with some pearl in the work, and some tur∣quois stones. To the vest, was a girdle five or six inches wide, after the Turkish mode; and on both ends where it joined or hooked, it was set with diamonds.</P>
<P>The turban, or head-dress, had a pinacle on the top, but not above five inches, with a piece of loose sarcenet hanging from it; and on the front, just over the forehead, was a fine jewel, which I had added to it.</P>
<P>When I came down, the room was full of company: but I ordered the folding-doors to be shut for a minute or two, till I had received the compliments of the Ladies that were in the room, and had given them a full view of my dress.</P>
<P>But my Lord Courtly, who happened to be in the room, slipped out at another door, and
<PB N="186" REF="200"/>
brought back with him one of the masks, a tall well-shaped person, but who had no name, being all masked, nor would it have been allowed to ask any person's name on such an occasion. The per∣son spoke in French to me, that it was the finest dress he had ever seen; and asked me, if he should have the honour to dance with me? I bowed, as giving my consent; but said, as I had been a Mahometan, I could not dance after the manner of this country; I supposed their musick could not play <HI>a la Moresque.</HI> He answered mer∣rily, I had a Christian's face, and he would venture it, that I could dance like a Christian; adding, that so much beauty could not be Mahometan. Immediately the folding-doors were flung open, and he led me into the room. The company were under the greatest surprize imaginable; the very musicians stopped awhile to gaze; for the dress was indeed exceeding surprising, perfectly new, very agreeable, and wonderfully rich.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, led me only a courant, and then he led me to the drawing-room door, when he retired to the rest of the masks. When he left me at the drawing-room door, I did not go in, as he thought I would have done, but turned about and showed myself to the whole room; and calling my woman Amy to me, gave her some directions to the musick, by which the company presently un∣derstood that I would give them a dance by my∣self. Immediately all the house rose up, and paid me a kind of compliment, by removing back every way to make me room, for the place was exceeding full; and I danced by myself a figure which I learnt in France, when the Prince de C—desired I would dance for his diversion; it was in∣deed a very fine figure, invented by a famous
<PB N="187" REF="201"/>
master at Paris, for a Lady or a Gentleman to dance singly; and being perfectly new, it pleased the company exceedingly, and they all thought it had been Turkish.</P>
<P>At the finishing the dance the company clapped, and almost shouted; and one of the Gentlemen cryed out, 'Roxana! Roxana!' with an oath; upon which foolish accident I had the name of Roxana fixed upon me all over the town, as effec∣tually as if I had been christened Roxana. I had, it seems, the felicity of pleasing every body that night, to an extreme; and my ball, but especially my dress, was the chat of the town for that week, and so the name Roxana was the to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st at, and about the Court; no other health was to be named with it.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen masked went off about three o'clock in the morning; the other Gentlemen sat down to play; the musick held it out; and some of the Ladies were dancing at six in the morning.</P>
<P>But I was mighty eager to know who it was danced with me. Some of the Lords went so far as to tell me, I was very much honoured in my company; one of them spoke so broad, as almost to say it was the King; but to this hour I never knew positively who it was; and by his behaviour I thought he was too young; his Majesty being at that time in an age that might be discovered from a young person, even in his dancing.</P>
<P>Be that as it would, I had five hundred guineas sent me the next morning, and the messenger was ordered to tell me, that the persons who sent it, de∣sired a ball again at my lodgings on the next Tuesday, but that they would have my leave to
<PB N="188" REF="202"/>
give the entertainment themselves. I was mighty well pleased with this, but very inquisitive to know who the money came from. But the mes∣senger was silent as to that point; and bowing always at my enquiries, begged me to ask no questions which he could not give an obliging answer to.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that the Gentlemen that played, gave a hundred guineas to the box, and at the end of their play, they asked for my Gentlewoman of the bed-chamber, as they called her, Mrs. Amy, and gave it her; and gave twenty guineas more among the servants.</P>
<P>These magnificent doings equally both pleased and surprised me; but especially, the notion of the King being the person that danced with me, puffed me up to that degree, that I not only did not know any-body else, but indeed, was very far from knowing myself.</P>
<P>I had now the next Tuesday to provide for the like company; but alas! it was all taken out of my hand. Three Gentlemen, who yet were, it seems, but servants, came the next day, and bringing sufficient testimonies that they were right, for one was the same who brought the five hundred guineas; I say, three of them came, and afterwards they sent in all sorts of wines, and hampers of sweet-meats to such a quantity, it appeared they designed to hold the trade on more than once, and that they would furnish every thing to a profusion.</P>
<P>On Tuesday there came such an appearance of Quality, that my apartments were by no means able to receive them; and those who in paricular appeared as principals, gave order below, to let no
<PB N="189" REF="203"/>
more company come up. The street was full of coaches with coronets, and chairs; and in short, it was impossible to receive the company. I kept my little room, as before, and the dancers filled the great room; all the drawing-rooms also were filled, and three other rooms below-stairs, which were not mine.</P>
<P>That the King was at this assembly was out of question with me, by circumstances that I could not be deceived in; and particularly, that there were five persons who were not masked, three of them had blue garters, and they appeared not to me till I came out to dance.</P>
<P>This meeting was managed just as the first, though with much more magnificence, because of the company. I placed myself, exceedingly rich in cloaths and jewels, in the middle of my little room, as before, and made my com∣pliments to all the company as they passed me, as I did before. But my Lord Courtly, who had spoken openly to me the first night, came to me, and unmasking, told me the com∣pany had ordered him to tell me, they hoped they should see me in the dress I had appear∣ed in the first day, which had been so accep∣table, that it had been the occasion of this new meeting. <Q>“And Madam,' says he, 'there are some in this assembly, who it is worth your while to oblige.”</Q></P>
<P>I bowed to my Lord, and immediately with∣drew. While I was above dressing in my new habit, two Ladies, perfectly unknown to me, were conveyed into my apartment below, by the order of a noble person, who, with his family,
<PB N="190" REF="204"/>
had been in Persia; and here indeed, I thought I should have been excelled.</P>
<P>One of these Ladies was dressed most exqui∣sitely fine indeed, in the habit of a Virgin Lady of Quality of Georgia, and the other in the same habit of Armenia, with each of them a woman slave to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ladies had their petticoats short to their ancles, but plaited all round, and before them short aprons, but of the finest point that could be seen: their gowns were made with long antick sleeves hanging down behind, and a train let down: they had no jewels, but their heads and breasts were dressed up with flowers, and they both came in veiled.</P>
<P>Their slaves were bare-headed; but their long black hair was braided in locks hanging down be∣hind to their waists, and tied up with ribbands; they were dressed exceeding rich, and were as beautiful as their mistresses; for none of them had any masks on. They waited in my room till I came down, and all paid their respects to me after the Persian manner, and sat down on a safra, that is to say, almost cross-legged on a couch made up of cushions laid on the ground.</P>
<P>This was admirably fine, and I was, indeed, startled at it. They made their compliments to me in French, and I replied in the same lan∣guage. When the doors were opened, they walked into the dancing-room, and danced such a dance, as indeed nobody there had ever seen, and to an instrument like a guittar, with a small low-sound∣ing trumpet, which, indeed, was very fine, and which my Lord Courtly had provided.</P>
<P>They danced three times all alone, for nobody indeed could dance with them: the novelty
<PB N="191" REF="205"/>
pleased, truly, but yet there was something wild and bizarre in it, because they really acted to the life the barbarous country whence they came; but as mine had the French behaviour under the Mahometan dress, it was every way as new, and pleased much better.</P>
<P>As soon as they had shewn their Georgian and Armenian shapes, and danced, as I have said, three times, they withdrew, paid their compli∣ment to me, for I was Queen of the night, and went off to undress.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen then danced with Ladies all in masks, and when they stopped, nobody rose up to dance, but all called out 'Roxana, Roxana.' In the interval my Lord Courtly had brought another masked person into my room, who I knew not, only that I could discern it was not the same per∣son that led me out before. This noble person, who was the Duke of—, after a short compli∣ment, led me out into the middle of the room.</P>
<P>I was dressed in the same vest and girdle as be∣fore; but the robe had a mantle over it, which is usual in the Turkish habit, and it was of crimson and green; the green brocaded with gold; and my head-dress varied a little from that I had be∣fore, as it stood higher, and had some jewels about the rising part, which made it look like a turban crowned.</P>
<P>I had no mask, neither did I paint; and yet I had the day of all the Ladies that appeared at the ball, I mean, of those that appeared with faces on; as for those masked, nothing could be said of them, no doubt there might be many finer than I was. It must be confessed, that the habit was infinitely advantageous to me, and every
<PB N="192" REF="206"/>
body looked at me with a kind of pleasure, which gave me great advantage too.</P>
<P>After I had danced with that noble person, I did not offer to dance by myself, as I had be∣fore; but they all called out Roxana again; and two of the Gentlemen came into the drawing-room, to intreat me to give them the Turkish dance, which I readily yielded to; so I came out and danced, just as at first.</P>
<P>While I was dancing, I perceived five per∣sons standing all together, and among them, one only with a hat on; it was an immediate hint to me who it was, and had at first almost put me into some disorder; but I went on, received the applause of the house as before, and retired into my own room. When I was there, the five Gen∣tlemen came cross the room to my side, and coming in, followed by a throng of great perso∣nages; the person with his hat on, said, 'Ma|'dam Roxana, you perform to admiration;' and saluted me; so passing back again through the great room, went away.</P>
<P>About three o'clock in the morning the com∣pany began to decrease: the Ladies especially drew away by degrees, and the Gentlemen retired down stairs, where they unmasked and went to play.</P>
<P>Amy waited at the room where they played; sat up all night to attend them; and in the morn∣ing, when they broke up, they swept the box into her lap, when she counted out to me sixty-two guineas and a half, and the other servants got very well too. Amy came to me when they were all gone, 'La! Madam,' says Amy, with a long gaping cry, 'what shall I do with all this 'money?' And indeed the poor creature was half mad with joy.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="207"/>
There is a scene which came in here, which made my fortune almost boundless; so great, enough to satisfy any woman with more vanity, if possible, than myself.</P>
<P>A few evenings after the masquerade, his Grace the Duke of—came to me in private, and ac∣quainted me, a certain great personage, who had seen me dance, had honoured him with his com∣mands, which, he said, was to bring me to him; that if I would oblige him in going, it would be highly worth my acceptance.</P>
<P>With this personage I lived about three years retired, with the greatest harmony and content; at the end of which time, an accident happened which deprived me of this felicity; who, or what he was, my duty, and private vows, oblige me not to reveal.</P>
<P>In about a week after the commencement of this amour, I gave orders to my woman Amy, to pay, and quit the lodgings in Pall-mall directly; go to my children, and say I was gone to Paris upon extraordinary business, concerning some bills that were unpaid, to the amount of several thou∣sand pounds; and that she could not say when I should return; and, added, her orders were to follow me. This Amy did so faithfully, that it was never discovered where I was concealed; and they thought I was in Paris the whole time.</P>

<P>AFTER the end of this amour, and what I call my retreat, in which I accumulated a pro∣digious sum, for I had now an estate of almost

three thousand pounds a year; and as I was not in the least impaired in beauty, or figure, excepting I was a little lustier than I was formerly, and as the reader must know, without my telling, three years older too; yet I say I was for health, beauty, and figure, as desirable a woman, as any in the three kingdoms. But, supposing I had not had such an opinion of myself, which, to be free with you, I really had; yet, the sequel will shew, a person of very great honour, and a person of a very great estate too, made me such an ample offer, that I have many reasons to think that he thought so, as well as I did.</P>
<P>This nobleman visited me a long while, and, in short, courted me as closely and assiduously, as if he had been wooing me to matrimony. He made me several valuable presents, which I suffer∣ed myself to be prevailed with to accept, but not without great difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually I suffered also his other importunities, and when he made me a proposal of a compliment, or appointment to me for a settlement, he said, that though I was rich, yet there was not the less due from him, to acknowledge the favours he received; and that if I was to be his, I should not live at my own expence, cost what it would. I told him, I was far from being extravagant, and yet I did not live at the expence of less than one thousand pounds a year; that however I was not covetous of settled allowances, for I looked upon that as a kind of golden chain, something like matrimony; that though I knew how to be true to a man of ho∣nour, as I knew his Lordship to be, yet I had a kind of aversion to the bonds. And though I was not so rich as the world took me to be, yet I was
<PB N="195" REF="209"/>
not so poor as to bind myself to hardships for a pension.</P>
<P>He told me he expected to make my life per∣fectly easy, and intended it so; that he knew of no bondage there could be in a private engage∣ment between us; that the bonds of honour he knew I would be tied by, and think them no bur∣then; and for other obligations, he scorned to ex∣pect any thing from me, but what he knew, as a woman of honour, I could grant; then, as to maintenance, he told me, he would soon show me that he valued me infinitely above one thousand pounds a year; and upon this footing we began.</P>
<P>I seemed kinder to him after this discourse; and as time and private conversation made us very in∣timate, he acknowledged it as an infinite favour, that I would accept of the thousand pounds a year; and I, that thought it was too much, suffered myself to be mastered, or prevailed with, to yield, even on but a bare engagement upon parole.</P>
<P>When he had obtained his end, I told him my mind. <Q>“Now you see, my Lord,' said I, 'how weakly I have acted, namely, to yield to you without any capitulation, or any thing secured to me, but that which you may cease to allow, when you please; if I am the less valued for such a confidence, I shall be injured in a manner that I will endeavour not to deserve.”</Q></P>
<P>He told me he would make it evident to me, that he did not seek me by way of bargain, as such things were often done; that as I had treated him with a generous confidence, so I should find I was in the hands of a man of honour, and one that knew how to value the obligation; and upon this, he gave me a draught upon his banker for five hundred pounds directly, which, he said, he gave
<PB N="196" REF="210"/>
me as a pledge, that I should not be a loser by my not having made a bargain with him.</P>
<P>This was engaging indeed, and gave a good idea of our future correspondence; and in short, as I could not refrain treating him with more kindness than I had done before, so, one thing be∣getting another, I gave him several testimonies that I was entirely his own by inclination, as well as by the common obligation of a mistress; and this pleased him exceedingly.</P>
<P><Q>“Soon after this secret engagement, I said, my Lord, as I have the honour of your Lord∣ship's company, it would be more agreeable to me to live in private, as I am desirous of no other ac∣quaintance than your lordship's.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My dear love,' said he, and kissing me, 'you shall have it so; nor can you think how much this conduct of your's engages me.”</Q></P>
<P>In a week he found out a lodging for me in a very handsome house, where he was not known. I suppose he had employed somebody to find it out for him; and where he had a convenient way to come into the garden, by a door that opened into St. James's Park.</P>
<P>By this key he could come in at what time of the night or day he pleased; and as we had also a little door in the lower part of the house, which was always left upon a lock, and his was the mas∣ter-key, so if it was twelve, one, or two o'clock at night, he could come directly into my bed-cham∣ber.</P>
<P>It happened pleasantly enough one night. His Lordship had been out of town for several days, and I, not expecting him home, had taken Amy to bed with me, and when my Lord came into the chamber, we were both fast asleep. I think
<PB N="197" REF="211"/>
it was near three o'clock, he said, when he came in, and a little merry, but not at all fuddled, or what they call in drink; and he directly came in∣to my room.</P>
<P>Amy, when she awaked, was frightened out of her wits, and cried out. I said calmly, <Q>“Indeed my Lord I did not expect you to-night, and we have been a little frightened with the cry of fire.”</Q>—<Q>“O!”</Q> says he, <Q>“I see you have got a bedfellow with you.”</Q>—I began to make an apology.—<Q>“No, no,”</Q> says my Lord, <Q>“you need no excuse, it is not a man-bedfellow I see;”</Q> but then, talking merrily, he catched his words back;—<Q>“My dear,”</Q> says he, <Q>“now I think on it, how shall I be satisfied it is not a man-bedfellow?—O,”</Q> says I, <Q>“I dare say your Lordship is satis∣fied” it is none but Amy.</Q> 'Yes,' says he, laughing, <Q>“it is Amy;' but how do I know what Amy is? it may be Mr. Amy, for ought I know. I hope you will give me leave to be satisfied. '—' I said, 'Yes, my Lord, by all means, I” would have your Lordship satisfied;' but I sup∣posed at the time he knew who she was.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, he fell foul of poor Amy, and he would know whether Amy was Mr. Amy or Mrs. Amy, and so it seemed he did; for she told me so afterwards, and that he gave her a guinea; and then being satisfied in that doubtful case, he walked to the farther end of the room, and went into a little closet, and sat down.</P>
<P>In the mean time Amy and I got up, and I bid her run and prepare the bed in another chamber for my Lord, and I gave her sheets to put into it; which she did immediately, and I put my Lord to bed there; and when I had done, at his desire went to bed to him. I was backward at first, and
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
made my excuse, because I had been in bed with Amy, and had not shifted me, but he was past those niceties at that time; and as he was sure it was Mrs. Amy, he was very well satisfied, and so the jest passed over. But Amy appeared no more all that night, or the next day; and when she did, my Lord was so merry with her upon his eclaircissement, as he called it, that Amy did not know what to do with herself.</P>
<P>I held this scene of life near eight years, reckon∣ing from my first coming to Pall-Mall; and tho' my Lord found no fault, yet I found, without much examining, that any one who looked in my face, might see I was above thirty; and yet, with∣out flattering myself, I carried my age extremely well, which was, at the very time, bordering on fifty.</P>
<P>I may venture to say, that no woman ever lived a life like me, of four and twenty years of wicked∣ness, without the least signals of remorse; without any signs of repentance; or without so much as a wish to put an end to it. I had so long habituat∣ed myself to a life of vice, that really it appeared to be no vice to me. I went on smooth and pleasant; I wallowed in wealth, and it flowed in upon me at such a rate, having lived frugally; so that I had, at the end of the eight years, full three thousand pounds coming in yearly, of which I did not spend one penny, being maintained by my allow∣ance from my Lord—, and more than main∣tained, by above two hundred pounds per annum; for though he did not contract for a thousand pounds a year, yet he gave me money so often, and that in such large sums, that I had seldom so little, one year with another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>Better late than never.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YET, upon the account of some uneasinesses be∣tween us, my amour with my Lord began to draw to an end; and indeed, notwithstanding his money, it had lasted so long, that I was much more sick of his Lordship than he could be of me. He grew old, and fretful, and captious; and I must add, which made the vice itself begin to grow surfeiting and nauseous to me, he grew worse and wickeder the older he grew; and that to such a degree, as is not fit to write of; and made me so weary of him, that upon one of his capricious humours, which he often took occasion to trouble me with, I took occasion to be much less complaisant to him than I used to be; and as I knew him to be hasty, I first took care to put him into a little passion, and then to resent it, and this brought us to words; in which I told him, I thought he grew sick of me; and he answered, in a heat, that truly so he was. I replied, that I found his Lordship was endeavouring to make me sick too; that I had met with several such rubs from him of late; and that he did not use me as he used to do; and I begged his Lordship he would make himself easy. This I spoke with an air of coldness and indifference, such as I knew he could not bear; but I did not downright quarrel with him, and desire him to quit me, for I knew that would come of itself; besides, I had received a great deal of handsome usage from him, and I was loth to have the breach be on my side, that he might not be able to say I was ungrateful.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="214"/>
But he put the occasion into my hands, for he came no more to me for two months. Indeed I expected a fit of absence, for such I had had several times before, but not for above a fort∣night or three weeks at most. But after I had stayed a month, which was longer than ever he kept away yet, I took a new method with him; for I was resolved now it should be in my power to continue, or not, as I thought fit. At the end of a month therefore I removed, and took lodg∣ings in Kensington gravel-pits, and left nobody at my house but Amy and a footman; with pro∣per instructions how to behave, when his Lord∣ship, being come to himself, should think fit to come again, which I knew he would.</P>
<P>Here I will take the liberty to digress a little, and, instead of proceeding in my own story, relate an anecdote concerning my woman Amy. I think I have mentioned already in this history, that I made Amy my confidant in all my amours; she in return, for I believe, if she had committed a murder she would not have concealed it from me, told me, while I was retired at my lodgings at Kensington, my footman, whom I left with her in my house in town one night, by her leaving her bed-chamber door unfastened, which should be a caution to all women who have any regard to their character, never to be so negligent; this young fellow, he got to bed to her; and when he thought he had made the most he could of her, for she acknowledged he had had, at least, fifty guineas, which she had given him, and which she told him were all she had; though that, she said, was only a pre∣tence; the fellow, after an amour of near two
<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
months, had the ingratitude to leave her, and she never heard of him after. I take shame to myself for this action; for I was so far from be∣ing angry with her for her indiscretion, that, on the contrary, I was rather pleased, for the want of a thorough repentance for my own crimes, that I could find another as wicked as myself.</P>
<P>But to return to my own story. About the end of two months, his Lordship came in the dusk of the evening, as usual. The footman, for now I had another man, answered him, and told him, his Lady was not at home, but there was Mrs. Amy above. So he did not order her to be called down, but went up into the dining-room. When Amy came to him, he asked where I was? <Q>“My Lord, my Mistress has been re∣moved a good while from hence, and lives at Kensington.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Ay, Mrs. Amy! how came you to be here then?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My Lord, we are here till quarter-day, because the goods are not removed, and to give answers if any comes to ask for my Lady.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, and what answer are you to give to me?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Indeed, my Lord, I have no particular an∣swer to your Lordship; but to tell you, and every-body else, where my Lady lives, that they may not think she is run away.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“No, Mrs. Amy, I do not think she is run away; but indeed, I cannot go after her so far.”</Q></P>
<P>Amy said nothing to that; but made a cur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy, and said, she believed I would be there again for
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
a week or two, in a little time. 'How little 'time,' says my Lord.</P>
<P>'She comes next Tuesday, my Lord,' says Amy.</P>
<P>'Very well, I will call and see her then:' and so he went away.</P>
<P>Accordingly I came on the Tuesday, and stayed a fortnight, but he came not; so I went back to Kensington; and after that I had very few of his Lordship's visits, which I was very glad of; and in a little time after was more glad of it than I was at first, and upon a far better account too.</P>
<P>For now I began not to be sick of his Lordship only, but really I began to be sick of the vice; and as I had good leisure now to divert and en∣joy myself in the world, as much as it was pos∣sible for any woman to do, that ever lived in it; so I found that my judgment began to prevail up∣on me to fix my delight upon nobler objects than I had formerly done; and the very beginning of this brought some just reflections upon me rela∣ting to things past, and to the former manner of my living; and though there was not the least hint in all this, from what may be called religion or conscience, and far from any thing of repentance, or any thing that was a-kin to it, especially at first; yet the sense of things, and the knowledge I had of the world, and the vast variety of scenes that I had acted my part in, began to work up∣on my senses, and it came so very strong upon my mind one morning, when I had been lying awake some time in my bed, as if somebody had asked me the question, what was I a strumpet for now? It occurred naturally upon this enquiry, that at first I yielded to the importunity of my circum∣stances,
<PB N="203" REF="217"/>
the misery of which, the Devil dismal∣ly aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I confess I had strong natural aversions to the crime at first, partly owing to a virtuous educa∣tion, and partly to a sense of religion; but the Devil, and that greater Devil of poverty, pre∣vailed; and the person who laid siege to me, did it in such an obliging, and I may almost say, irre∣sistible manner, all still managed by the evil spi∣rit; for I must be allowed to believe, that he has a share in all such things, if not the whole ma∣nagement of them. But, I say, it was carried on by that person, in such an irresistible manner, that, as I said when I related the fact, there was no withstanding it. These circumstances, I say, the Devil managed, not only to bring me to comply, but he continued them as arguments to fortify my mind against all reflection, and to keep me in that horrid course I had engaged in, as if it were honest and lawful.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that now: this was a pre∣tence, and here was something to be said, though I acknowledge, it ought not to have been suffici∣ent to me at all; but, I say, to leave that, the Devil himself could not form one argument, or put one reason into my head now, that could serve for an answer to this question; why I should be a prostitute now?</P>
<P>It had for a-while been a little kind of excuse to me, that I was engaged with this old Lord, and that I could not in honour forsake him; but how foolish and absurd did it look, to repeat the word honour on so vile an occasion? As if a woman should prostitute her honour in point of honour; horrid inconsistency! Honour called upon me to detest the crime and the man too, and to have
<PB N="204" REF="218"/>
resisted all the attacks which from the beginning had been made upon my virtue; and honour, had it been confu'ted, would have preserved me honest from the beginning.</P>
<Q>For Honesty and Honour are the same.</Q>
<P>This, however, shews us with what faint ex∣cuses, and with what trifles we pretend to satisfy ourselves, and suppress the attempts of conscience in the pursuit of agreeable crime, and in the pos∣sessing those pleasures which we are loth to part with.</P>
<P>But this objection would now serve no lon∣ger; for my Lord had, in some sort, broke his engagements with me, and had so far slighted me, as fairly to justify my entire quitting of him now; and so, as the objection was fully answered, the question remained still unanswered, 'Why am I a 'prostitute now?' Nor indeed, had I any thing to say for myself, even to myself. I could not without blushing, as wicked as I was, answer, that I loved it for the sake of the vice, and that I delighted in being a strumpet; as such, I say, I could not say this even to myself, and alone, nor indeed, would it have been true; I was never able in justice, and with truth, to say I was so wicked as that: but as necessity first debauched me, and poverty made me a prostitute at the beginning; so excess of avarice for getting money, and excess of vanity, conti∣nued me in the crime, not being able to resist the flatteries of great persons; being called the finest woman both in France and in England; and being caressed by a Prince; these were my baits, these the chains by which the Devil held me bound; and by which I was indeed, too fast held, for any reasoning that I was mistress of to deliver me from.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="219"/>
But this was all over now; avarice could have no pretence. I was out of the reach of all that fate could be supposed to do to reduce me; now I was so far from poor, or the danger of it, that I had more wealth than I knew what to do with; when I ruminated on it all in my thoughts, as you may be sure I did often, added weight still to the question, as above, and it sounded continu∣ally in my head, 'What am I a strumpet for now?'</P>
<P>It is true, this was, as I may say, seldom out of my thoughts, but yet it made no impressions upon me of that kind, which might be expected from a reflection of so important a nature, and which had so much of substance and seriousness in it.</P>
<P>And surely I am an instance of the depravity of human nature, to an eminent degree. So soon after my late reflections upon the life which I had lived for upwards of twenty years, to fall into the snare again, seems such an abominable absurdity which can scarcely be reconciled; but such is the frailty of man, or, rather the frailty of woman. For happening, on a visit to a Lady, to be in the company of a young Gentleman, whom I had never seen before, I was so struck with his per∣son, on his first entrance into the room, and after∣wards with his behaviour and conversation, that I was fully convinced I had ever, till then, been a stranger to the passion of love; and, to heighten my imaginations, I perceived, in several instances, that I was not indifferent to him.</P>
<P>Flushed with the conquest which I thought I had made, or rather the conquest which he had made on me, I was determined, if I could, to see him again; to obtain which, I exerted all my powers to be as agreeable as possible; and taking an opportunity as we were standing at one of the windows together, I spoke to him in a low voice,
<PB N="206" REF="220"/>
that I should take it as a singular favour, if he would be so obliging as to be my partner in a dance, at my own lodgings, the next evening; at the same time giving him privately a card of my address. He gave me a bow of assent, and we took our seats again.</P>
<P>For about an hour, the conversation of the company was, as usual, brilliant and polite; but, as it was no ways conducive to the plan of this history, nor might it be agreeable if it was to be related, I shall, therefore, take the freedom to con∣ceal it, and keep it to myself. And immediately after took my leave, the Gentleman first taking me by the hand, and leading me to my coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, for that was his name, was my partner as desired; his motions, and steps, in the minuet, were admirable, and pleased me highly; and when the dance was finished, he conveyed me to a seat.</P>
<P>When we were seated, he very gracefully and politely complimented me, and said, he never met with a Lady who danced any thing like me, and wondered where I had acquired it, and who were my masters?</P>
<P>I told him, the rudiments I learned, when a child, in Paris; but that my chief study was here, in England; and, added, since I had the pleasure to merit the approbation of so good a judge, I assured him, that it would be the means of an additional vanity, and that I thought I had enough of it before.</P>
<P>Finding him pleased, I did all I could to in∣crease it; and my conversation with him was ex∣pressed in such terms, with an invitation, as I should be alone, for him to dine with me the
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
next day; that, to a man of his understanding, I left but little room for him to guess at my inclina∣tions.</P>
<P>Hitherto, every amour or intrigue, that I had ever been concerned in, was on the score of in∣terest only; but this, which I am going to relate, was of another kind.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was a handsome young fellow, not thirty. He was tall, genteel, and extremely well made; with an expression in his countenance which betokened sensibility; of little or no fortune, but a gentleman by birth.</P>
<P>And, that I may not keep you too long in su∣pense, agreeable to my invitation, he came—he dined—he supped—and to tell you a secret, my kind reader, he stayed—not by enchantment, not by magick, as some of the heroes in ancient story; but by powers more attractive, more agreeable, namely, by his own desires, his own inclinations; and so long and faithfully too, that you, or any one else, might have taken a voyage to the East-Indies and back again; I mean in respect to my∣self; my own behaviour to him. Whether he did so by me, is out of the question.</P>
<P>Perhaps, reader, you startle at the word faith∣fully. Why, I do assure you, with the greatest truth, and sincerity, that not only with him, but in every amour with others, I was ever as true and faith∣ful to my companion, as the most virtuous wife can be to a husband; nor was I ever suspected to the contrary; and I maintained him in as genteel and affluent a manner, though privately, as he could have maintained me, if I had been his wife, and he had been in possession of my whole fortune; I say privately, for now I kept little or no company, nor did I ever go abroad with him, nor, indeed, did
<PB N="208" REF="222"/>
I go abroad much with any others, excepting to see a play, which was not very often, and that was always in company with one of my own sex; and as I lived in lodgings and had the first-floor, so, to take off suspicion, he rented the second; by which means he went out when he pleased, and returned when he pleased, without any reflection upon me in the whole neighbourhood; nor was it absolutely known by any in the house, excepting my own maid Amy, in whom I could confide; though, perhaps, it might be generally guessed at by the rest of my servants; but that I never heard for certain.</P>
<P>I have said he went out when he pleased, as indeed he did very often; and he would sometimes be away, though seldom, for two or three days together, for I laid no injunction or restraint on his actions; and though I was extremely fond of his behaviour and conversation, for they were ever polite and engag∣ing; yet I never let him see, nor did he ever know, either by my expressions or countenance, that I wished him to stay at home, whenever he had an inclination to be abroad. My usual question to him was, with a smile, when I saw him preparing to leave me, by his taking his hat and sword, 'My Dear, what time do you think to return?' He, with the same affability, first giving me a kiss, would reply, 'Just as it may happen, my dear, 'either to dinner or supper.' Whichever he men∣tioned, I knew he would be as good as his word, for he was always extremely punctual. I mention this to shew that he was as engaging in his temper and manners, as he was in his person; and surely he had every perfection to an eminent degree that any woman can desire to make her happy; and if she cannot be happy and contented with such a
<PB N="209" REF="223"/>
man, I am at a loss to guess what will make her so.</P>
<P>But as all earthly felicities and enjoyments must terminate and close at last, a circumstance happen∣ed which put a period to my present happiness.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy had been absent two days, and the evening of the latter, I gave my maid Amy leave to go to the play. When she came home, she told me, a few minutes before the curtain drew up, she saw Mr. Worthy come with a beautiful young lady, most elegantly dressed, into one of the stage boxes; she added, <Q>“Do not be alarmed, Madam, for I do not look upon it in the light of an intrigue; I am rather inclinable to think it is an affair of courtship, Madam, for his be∣haviour to the lady was with a deal of politeness and respect.”</Q></P>
<P>My not giving an answer to what Amy had said, and she looking me full in the face; cried, <Q>“Lord! Madam, what is the matter with you?'—'Oh! Amy, I am undone!'—'Heavens forbid, Ma∣dam! I wish I had not told you of this unlucky affair.'—'I should have been very angry with you, if you had not, if I had known it from any other person hereafter; but, I am determined I will not take any notice to Mr. Worthy of what you have said, for I have that opinion of him he will acquaint me himself, when I see him, except it be an intrigue, and that to be sure I, and all the world would expect he should conceal.'—'You say, Amy, the lady is genteel; is she handsome too?'—'Both, Madam, though not to so great a degree with yourself; for with∣out flattery, I never saw a lady possessed of so much. This cannot be called flattery in me, for all who know you say so, and if they did
<PB N="210" REF="224"/>
not, I know your mind so well, Madam, that you yourself are of that opinion.”</Q></P>
<P>After Amy had undressed me, and I was gone to rest, or rather to-bed, for rest I could not get any; it revolved in my mind the tale I had been told. I considered that if it was, as Amy imagined, an affair of honour, he might have come home as usual; and in this perplexity of my mind, I con∣cluded it, he not coming, to be no other than an intrigue; and though generally people, who are under afflictions, are inclinable to imagine the worst; yet, I thought, if it was an intrigue, it was the lesser evil of the two; there might be an end of that; but if he could succeed with the lady in the other, by marriage, I knew to me he was lost for ever; he being a man not only of the strictest ho∣nour, but of conscience too, in every case, as well as in that of love.</P>
<P>Still I was uneasy: for though it might be as I imagined, it affected me in a double capacity. First in my person. And, to a woman of my feelings, I shall leave the ladies to guess. Next, it was at my expence too, for, to him, I was profuse in my boun∣ties, whom, I thought, so every way deserving, and, to do him justice, he was a charming fellow.</P>
<P>After he was absent five days, as I was sitting musing, and alone in my parlour, I was agree∣ably surprised with the sight of him who had so lately engrossed my thoughts, and immediately rising from my seat, 'My Dear Angel,' said he, saluting me, 'did not you imagine you had lost 'me?' I pressed him eagerly to me, and, sharing with him in the salute, I replied, <Q>“No, my Love, why should you think so now, more than at any other time?'—'Because,' said he, 'I never de∣prived
<PB N="211" REF="225"/>
myself of the happiness of your society so long before; nor should I have done it now, if I had not accidentally met with a friend, a Mr. Bennet, who took me to a lady of his acquain∣tance, a Merchant's daughter, a Miss Harpur, who was in company with another lady, a Merchant's daughter likewise, a Miss Stanley,” and we all four went to the play together.</Q></P>
<P>As I had never heard him mention this Mr. Bennet, nor ever heard of the names of these ladies before; it occured to me he had discovered Amy at the play, as well as she had him; that the whole was a mere pretence; and though, by my beha∣viour to him, he had not the least suspicion then, nor ever after, the uneasiness it gave to me, yet I was convinced, in my opinion, that there was an intrigue at the bottom.</P>
<P>I never before this, had the least jealousy of any man, nor did I ever give any man cause to be jealous of me; but, I must confess, I was at present a little tinctured with the disease, from the above suspicion only; not that Mr. Worthy had given me any cause to doubt of the veracity of his story, but from the story itself.</P>
<P>His behaviour, as I have already said, was always agreeable and engaging to me, as indeed I believe it was to every one he conversed with; and we lived together in the utmost harmony; and, as I had never heard any more concerning his friend Mr. Bennet, or of the ladies, I concluded, for it was now above six months since the affair of the play-house, that I had done him an injury in har∣bouring such a thought, and was determined to make him ample amends, by forgetting it.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="226"/>
I had not been long in this serenity of mind, before my maid Amy brought me the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>

</LETTER>
<P>When I had perused it, I pulled the bell for Amy; and when she came, 'There,' said I, pointing to the letter, 'read it.'</P>
<P>As I cannot sufficiently describe the anxieties which passed in my breast at that time, I must leave it to the minds of my readers to imagine, under the same circumstances, by what would have passed in their own.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="227"/>
I did not imagine it was possible for any wo∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to be so greatly affected for the loss of a man, as I was, for several weeks, for the loss of Mr. Worthy; and the many reflections which fre∣quently occurred to my mind, were reflections rather thrown upon my own conduct, than cast upon his; for I had not the least pretence to com∣plain of him, except I may be allowed to call it so, in his marrying a virtuous Lady, with a large fortune; and, where is the man to be found, who would not prefer an honourable engagement with a virtuous woman, and an independency; rather than rely on the favours of the capricious, and fan∣tastick humours of a prostitute?</P>
<P>Here I began again to reflect upon my manner of living. And one morning when Amy was in bed with me, and I had some of my dullest thoughts about me, Amy, hearing me sigh pretty often, asked me, if I was not well?</P>
<P><Q>“Yes, Amy, I am well enough; but my mind is oppressed with uneasy thoughts, and has been so a good while.”</Q></P>
<P>'Why so, Madam?' says Amy.</P>
<P><Q>“Why, prythee girl, what sober virtuous Lady, or what family of any character will visit or be acquainted with me?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, all that is true, Madam,' says she; 'but how can it be remedied now?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is true Amy, the thing cannot be remedied now, but the scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Truly,' says Amy, 'I do not see how, un∣less you will go abroad again, and live in some other nation, where nobody has known you, or seen you, so that they cannot say they ever saw you before.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="228"/>
That very thought of Amy put what follows into my head; and I returned, <Q>“Why, Amy, is it not possible for me to remove from this part of the town, and go and live in another part, or somewhere in the country, and be as entirely concealed as if I had never been known?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Yes,' says Amy, 'I believe it might; but then you must put off all your equipages, and servants, coaches, and horses; change your li∣veries, nay, your own cloaths, and if it was possible, your very face; for you have a face, Madam, that is not easily forgotten.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, and that is the way, Amy, and that I will do, and that shortly; for I am not able to live in this manner any longer.”</Q></P>
<P>Amy came into this with a kind of pleasure peculair to herself, that is to say, with an eager∣ness not to be resisted; for Amy was apt to be precipitant in her motions, and was for doing it immediately.</P>
<P><Q>“Well Amy, as soon as you will; but what course must we take to do it? we cannot put off servants, and coach and horses, and every thing; leave off house-keeping, and transform ourselves into a new shape, all in a moment. Servants must have warning, and the goods must be sold off, and a thousand” things.'</Q> And this began to perplex us, and in particular, took up two or three days consi∣deration.</P>
<P>At last, Amy, who was a clever manager in most cases, came to me with a scheme as she called it. <Q>“I have found it out, Madam. I have found a scheme how you shall, if you have a mind to it, begin, and finish a perfect entire change of your figure and circumstances, in one
<PB N="215" REF="229"/>
day; and shall be as much unknown, Madam, in twenty-four hours, as you would be in so many years.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Come Amy, let us hear it, for you please me mightily with the thought of it.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why then,' says she, 'let me go this af∣ternoon, and I will enquire out some honest, plain, sober family, where I will take lodgings for you, as for a country Lady that desires to be in London for about half a year, and to board yourself and a kinswoman, that is half a servant, half a companion, meaning myself; and so agree” with them by the month.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“To this lodging, if I get one to your mind, you may go to-morrow morning, in a hackney∣coach, with nobody but me, and leave such cloaths and linnen as you think fit; but to be sure the plainest you have, and then you are removed at once, you need never so much as set your foot in this house again, or see any body belonging to it. In the mean time, I will let the servants know, that you are going over to Hol∣land upon extraordinary business, and will leave off your equipages, and so I will give them warning, or, if they will accept of it, give them a month's wages; then I will sell off your fur∣niture as well as I can; only take care to let this lodging be in some remote part of the town, and you may be as perfectly unknown, as if you had never been in England in your life.”</Q></P>
<P>This was Amy's scheme; and away Amy went, and was gone five hours. But when she came back, I could see, by her countenance, that her suc∣cess had been suitable to her pains; for she came
<PB N="216" REF="230"/>
laughing. 'O Madam! I am sure it will do.' And with that, she tells me how she had fixed upon a house in a court in the Minories; that she was directed to it merely by accident; that it was a female family, the master of the house being gone to New-England; and that the wo∣man had four children, kept two maids, and lived very handsomely, but wanted company to divert her; and on that very account, she had agreed to take boarders.</P>
<P>Amy agreed for a handsome price, if I liked them, because she was resolved I should be used well; so she bargained to give her ten pound a month, and twelve pound, if we took a maid, and so in proportion for every servant, leaving that to my choice; and that we might be satisfied we should meet with nothing very gay, the Gentle∣woman, she said, being a Quaker.</P>
<P>I was so pleased, that I resolved to go with Amy the next day to see the lodgings, and to see the wo∣man of the house, and see how I liked them. But if I was pleased with the general, I was much more pleased with the particulars; for the Quaker was a most courteous, obliging, mannerly person; per∣fectly well-bred, and perfectly good humoured, and, in short, the most agreeable conversation that ever I met with; and, which was worth all, though grave, yet was pleasant and sociable, that it is scarce possible for me to express how I was pleased and delighted with her company; and particular∣ly, I was so pleased, that I would go away no more; so I even took up my lodging there the very first night,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>An unexpected Incident.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, though it took up Amy almost a month to put off all the appearances, of house-keeping, it need take me up but little time to re∣late it; it is enough to say, that Amy quitted all that part of the world, and came pack and package to me, and here we took up our abode.</P>
<P>I was now in a perfect retreat indeed; remote from the eyes of all that ever had seen me, and as much out of the way of being ever seen or heard of by any that used to follow me, as if I had been among the mountains in Lancashire; for when did a blue garter, or a coach and six come into a little narrow passage in the Minories? And as there was no fear of them, so really I had no desire to see them, or so much as to hear from them any more.</P>
<P>I lived here perfectly retired, and with a most pleasant and agreeable Lady; I must call her so, for though a Quaker, she had a full share of good breeding, sufficient for her, if she had been a Duchess; in a word, she was the most agreeable creature in her conversation, as I said before, that ever I met with.</P>
<P>I pretended, after I had been there some little time, to be extremely in love with the dress of the Quakers, and this pleased her so much, that she would needs dress me up one day in a suit of her own cloaths; but my real design was, to see whe∣ther it would pass upon me for a disguise.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="232"/>
Amy was struck with the novelty, though I had not mentioned my design to her; and when the Quaker was gone out of the room, says Amy, <Q>“I guess your meaning; it is a perfect disguise to you; why you look quite another body, I should not have known you myself; nay, Madam, more than that, it makes you look ten years younger than you did.”</Q></P>
<P>Nothing could please me better than that; and when Amy repeated it, I was so fond of it, that I asked my Quaker, I will not call her landlady, it is, indeed, too coarse a word for her, and she deserves a much better. I say, I asked her, who were here mercer and mantua-maker, for I was so fond of it, that I would have a suit made for me. <Q>“I can soon help thee to both, 'says she: 'for” they live but in the Minories.'</Q> In about a week after they were brought home finished, with every article suitable to wear with them.</P>
<P>When Amy had dressed me, I came down to my Quaker. The moment she saw me, says she, <Q>“Friend, now thou art one of us, and, I profess, had not I been at the purchase of thy garment, I doubt if I should have known thee; and if thy particular were to come, he would enquire of thee, after thyself; for, I believe, he would” not have the least knowledge of thee.'</Q> Upon this, I went to the glass, and to be sincere with you, I was of the same opinion, I was so meta∣morphosed; thaugh every thing I had on was the best that could be got.</P>
<P>This good, though unhappy Quaker, had the misfortune to have a bad husband, and he was gone beyond-sea. She had a good house, and
<PB N="219" REF="233"/>
well furnished, and had some jointure of her own estate, which supported her and her children, so that she did not want; but she was not at all above such a help, as my being there was to her; so she was as glad of me, as I was of her.</P>
<P>However, as I knew there was no way to fix this new acquaintance, like making myself a friend to her, I began with making her some handsome presents: and first, opening my bundles one day in my chamber, I heard her in another room, and called her in, with a kind of familiar way; there I showed her some of my rich cloaths, and having among the rest of my things, a piece of very fine new holland, I pulled it out: 'Here, Madam,' says I, 'I will make you a present, if you will accept 'of it.' And with that I laid the piece of holland in her lap.</P>
<P>I could see she was surprised, and that she could hardly speak. 'What dost thou mean?' says she; <Q>“indeed I cannot have the face to accept so fine a present as this;' adding, 'It is fit for” thy own use, but it is above my wear, indeed.</Q> I thought she had meant she must not wear it so fine, because she was a Quaker; so I returned, 'Why, do not you Quakers wear fine linen?'</P>
<P>'Yes,' says she, 'we wear fine linen when 'we can afford it, but this is too good for me.' However, I made her take it, and she was very thankful too: but my end was answered another way; for by this I engaged her so, that as I found her a woman of understanding, and of honesty too, I might upon any occasion, have a confi∣dence in her, which was indeed what I very much wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="234"/>
By accustoming myself to converse with her, I had not only learned to dress like a Quaker, but so used myself to Thee and Thou, that I talked like a Quaker too, as readily and naturally as if I had been born among them; and, in a word, I passed for a Quaker among all people that did not know me. I went but little abroad, but I had been so used to a coach, that I knew not how well to go without one; besides, I thought it would be a farther disguise to me, so I told my Quaker friend one day, that I thought I lived too close; that I wanted air. She proposed taking a hackney-coach sometimes, or a boat. But I told her, I had always had a coach of my own, till now, and I had a great inclination of having one again.</P>
<P>She seemed to think it strange at first, considering how private I lived, but had nothing to say when she found I did not value the expence; so in short, I resolved I would have a coach. When we came to talk of equipages; she extolled the having all things plain: I said so too. So I left it to her di∣rection, and a coach-maker was sent for, and he provided me a plain coach, lined with a light grey cloth, and my coachman had a coat of the same, and no lace on his hat.</P>
<P>When all was ready, I dressed myself, and said; <Q>“Come, I will be a Quaker to-day; and you and” I will go abroad.</Q> Which we did; and there was not a Quaker in town looked less like a coun∣terseit than I did. But all this was my particular plot to be the more compleatly concealed, and that I might depend upon being not known, and yet need not be confined like a prisoner, and be
<PB N="221" REF="235"/>
always in fear; so that all the rest was only pre∣tence.</P>
<P>We lived there very easy and quiet, and yet I cannot say I was so in my mind; I was like a fish out of water; I was as gay and as young in my disposition, as I was at five and twenty; and as I had always been courted, flattered, and used to love it, so I missed it in my conversation; and this put me many times upon looking back up∣on past things.</P>
<P>I had very few moments in my life, which, in their reflection, afforded me any thing but regret; and while I was surrounded with these melancholy ideas, a strange adventure happened to me, which I shall here relate. I had been abroad to take the air, as usual, with my Quaker, as far as Epping-forrest, and we were driving back to London. When on the road between Bow and Mile-end, two Gentlemen on horseback came riding by, having overtaken the coach, and passed it, and went forwards towards London.</P>
<P>They did not ride apace, though they passed the coach, for we went very softly, nor did they look into the coach at all, but rode side by side, earnestly talking to one another, and inclining their faces side-ways a little towards one another; he that went nearest the coach, with his face from it, and he that was farthest from the coach, with his face towards it, and passing in the very next tract to the coach, I could hear them talk Dutch very distinct∣ly: but it is impossible to describe the confusion I was in, when I plainly saw that the farthest of the two, him whose face looked towards the coach, was my friend, and old acquaintance, Mr. Van∣dunc.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="236"/>
If it had been possible to conceal my disor∣der from my friend the Quaker, I would have done it; but I fund she was too well acquaint∣ed with such things, not to take the blut. Upon this, she said, <Q>“Dost thou understand” Dutch?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why friend do you ask?” said I.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why,' says she; 'it is easy to suppose that thou art a little concerned at somewhat these men say. I imagine they are talking of thee.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Indeed, my good friend, thou art mistaken this time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but it is all about ships, and trading affairs.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well,' says she, 'then one of them is a man-friend of thine, or somewhat is the case; for though thy tongue will not confess it, thy face does.”</Q></P>
<P>I was going to tell a lye, and said, I knew no∣thing of them, but I found it was impossible to conceal it; so I said, <Q>“Indeed, I think I know the farthest of them; but I have neither spoken to him, or so much as seen him for above eleven years.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well then,' says she, 'thou hast seen him with more than common eyes, when thou didst see him; or else seeing him now would not be such a surprize to thee.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Indeed,' said I, 'it is true I am a little sur∣prized at seeing him now, for I thought he had been in quite another part of the world; and I can assure you, I never saw in him Eng∣land before.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well then, it is more like he is come now on purpose to seek thee.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="223" REF="237"/>
“No, no,' said I, 'knight-errantry is over; women are not so hard to come at, that men should not be able to please themselves without running from one kingdom to another.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, well,' says she, 'I would fain have him see thee for all that, as plainly as thou hast seen him.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“No, but he shall not,' says I, 'for I am sure he don't know me in this dress, and I will take” care he shall not see my face, if I can help it.'</Q> So I held up my fan before my face; and she saw me resolute in that, so she pressed me no farther.</P>
<P>But, at last, I confessed so much, that though I would not let him know who I was, or where I lived, I did not care if I knew where he lived, and how I might enquire about him.</P>
<P>She took the hint immediately, and her servant being behind the coach, she called him to the coach side, and bade him keep his eye on that Gentleman, describing him, and as soon as the coach came to White-chapel church, he should get down and follow him closely, so as to see where he put up his horse, and then to make what enquiry he could, who he was, and where be lived.</P>
<P>The fellow followed diligently to the gate of an inn, and seeing him go in, made no doubt but he had him fast; but was confounded, when, upon enquiry, he found the inn was a thoroughfare into another street, and that the two Gentlemen had only rode thorough the inn, as the way to the street where they were going, and so, in short, came back no wiser than he went.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="238"/>
My kind quaker was more vexed at the disap∣pointment, at least apparently so, than I was; and asking the fellow, if he was sure he should know the Gentleman again if he saw him; the fellow said, he had followed him so close, and took so much notice of him, that he was very sure he should know him again; and that besides, he was sure he should know his horse.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>An Interview unexpected.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DURING an interval of near five weeks, I suf∣fered a thousand perplexities of mind. I was thoroughly convinced I was right as to his person, that he was the man; I knew him so well, and saw him so plain, I could not be deceived. Under the pretence of air, I ordered my coach to be ready every afternoon, in hopes of seeing him again, sometimes going one road, sometimes another, but was never so fortunate as to meet with him; till at last I concluded he was gone back to Paris.</P>
<P>One saturday evening the quaker came to me in the parlour, in a little more hurry than usual, and joy in her countenance. <Q>“I have found out thy Dutch friend,' says the, 'and can tell thee how” to find him too.'</Q> Immediately I felt a glow in my face; <Q>“then thou hast dealt with the evil one, friend,' said I very gravely. 'No, no,' says she, I have no familiar; but I tell thee, I have found him for thee, that he is a Dutchman; that he came from Roan; that he lodges with a Mr.
<PB N="225" REF="239"/>
Cavell, on Lawrence Pountney's-hill, and that” his name is Vandunc.</Q></P>
<P>I was surprised, you may be sure, not being able to imagine how she could come to know all this. However, to remove my surprise, she told me she ordered her man to place himself at the corner of Whitechapel Church-Wall, every saturday in the afternoon, by which means the fellow discovered him. 'Pray let me see the man,' says I. After I had questioned him for some∣time, for the trouble and pains he had taken, I gave him a guinea.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <Q>“Well,' said I, 'my dear friend, thou art very kind, but this is not worth thy pains; for now I know it, 'tis only to sa∣tisfy my curiosity.' 'Be that as thou wilt: be∣sides,' added she, 'thou art in the right to say so to me; for, why should I be trusted with it? Though if I were, I assure you, I should not betray thee:' 'That is very kind,' said I, 'and I believe thee; and assure thyself, if I do send to him, thou shalt know it, and be trusted with it too.”</Q></P>
<P>Though now I had made the discovery, I was as far to seek what measures to take, as I was be∣fore; to send to him, or speak to him first, if I should see him, so as to know him, that I resolved not to do, if I died for it; to watch him about his lodgings, that was as much below my spirit as the other; so that, in a word, I was at a perfect loss how to act, or what to do as much as ever, as no human invention could bring me to the speech of him, in such a manner as would suit with my resolutions; and, after all, how did I know what
<PB N="226" REF="240"/>
his circumstances were? whether married or single? and if he had a wife, I knew he was so honest a man, he would not converse with me.</P>
<P>In the next place, as he had entirely neglected me, which, in short, is the worst way of slighting a woman, I did not know but he might be the same man still; so I resolved that I could do nothing in it, unless some fairer opportunity presented, which might make my way clearer to me; for I was determined he should have no room to put any more slights upon me.</P>
<P>In these thoughts I passed away near three months; at the end of which time, the following scene opened.</P>
<P>One afternoon, my friendly quaker and I sitting in her chamber up stairs, and very chearful, chat∣ting together, when somebody ringing hastily, and no servant just then in the way, she ran down herself, to the door; when a gentleman appears with a footman attending, and making some apo∣logies, whose voice I heard, and whose speech I knew, which she did not thoroughly understand, he speaking very bad English; he asked to speak with me, by the very same name that I went by in her house; which, by the way, was not the name that he had known me by.</P>
<P>She, with very civil language, in her way, brought him into a very handsome parlour below stairs, and said, she would go and see whether the person who lodged in her house owned that name, and he should hear farther.</P>
<P>I was frighted, and ready to die, when my qua∣ker came up all gay, and crowing; 'There,' says she, 'is thy Dutch French Merchant come to see
<PB N="227" REF="241"/>
'thee.' I could not speak one word to her, nor stir off of her chair, but sat as motionless as a sta∣tue. She said many pleasant things to me, but they made no impression on me; at last she pulled me, and teazed me, <Q>“Come, come,' says she, be thyself, and rouze up, I must go down again to him; what shall I say to him?'—'Say,' said I, that you have no such body in the house.'—'That I cannot do,' says she, 'because it is not the” truth.</Q> Besides, I have owned thou art above.'</P>
<P><Q>“Well,' says she, 'I'll go and tell him thou” wilt come quickly,' so without giving me time to answer her, away she goes.</Q></P>
<P>A number of thoughts circulated in my head, while she was gone, and what to do I could not tell. I saw no remedy but I must speak with him, but would have given any thing to have shunned it; yet, had I shunned it, perhaps then, I would have given any thing again, that I had seen him. Thus fluctuating and unconcluding were my thoughts; what I so earnestly desired, I declined when it offered itself.</P>
<P>While I was in this hurry, my friend, the qua∣ker, comes up again, and perceiving the confusion I was in, she runs to her closet, and fetched me a little pleasant cordial, but I would not taste it. <Q>“O!' says she, 'I understand thee, be not un∣easy, I'll give thee something shall take off all the smell; if he kisses thee a thousand times, he” shall be no wiser.'</Q> I thought with myself thou art perfectly acquainted with affairs of this nature, I think you must govern me now, so I began to incline to go down with her; upon that, I took the cordial, and she gave me a kind of spicey pre∣serve
<PB N="228" REF="242"/>
after it, whose flavour was so strong, and yet so deliciously pleasant, that it would cheat the nicest smelling, and it left not the least taint of the cordial on the breath.</P>
<P>After some little hesitation, I went down a pair of back-stairs with her, and into a dining-room, next to the parlour in which he was; but there I haited, and desired she would let me consider of it a little. 'Well, do so,' says she, and left me with more readiness than she did before; 'do consider, 'and I'll come to thee again.'</P>
<P>Though I hung back with an aukwardness that was really unfeigned, yet when she so readily left me, I thought it was not so kind, and I began to think she should have pressed me still on to it; so foolishly backward are we, to the thing which of all the world we most desire; mocking ourselves with a feigned reluctance, when the negative would be death to us; but she was too cunning for me, for while I, as it were, blamed her in my mind, for not carrying me to him, though at the same time I appeared backward to see him; on a sudden she unlocks the folding-doors, which looked into the next parlour, and throwing them open, 'There, friend,' says she, (ushering him in) 'is the person, who, I suppose, thou enquirest 'for;' and the same moment, with a kind decency she retired, and that so swift, that she would not give us leave, hardly, to know which way she went.</P>
<P>I stood up, but was confounded with a sudden enquiry in my thoughts, how I should receive him? and with a resolution as swift as lightning, in answer to it, said to myself, it shall be coldly;
<PB N="229" REF="243"/>
so, on a sudden, I put on an air of stiffness and ceremony, and held it for about two minutes; but it was with great difficulty.</P>
<P>He restrained himself too; on the other hand, came towards me gravely, and saluted me in form; but it was, it seems, upon his supposing the quaker was behind him, whereas she, as I said, under∣stood things too well, and had retired, as if she had vanished, that we might have full freedom. For, as she said afterwards, she supposed we had seen one another before, though it might have been a great while since.</P>
<P>Whatever stiffness I had put on my behaviour to him, I was surprised in my mind, and angry at his, and began to wonder what kind of a cere∣monious meeting it was to be. However, after he perceived the quaker was gone, he made a kind of a hesitation, looking a little round him; 'Indeed,' said he, 'I thought the lady was not withdrawn,' and with that he took me in his arms, and kissed me three or four times. But I that was prejudic∣ed to the last degree, with the coldness of his first salutes, when I did not know the cause of it, could not be thoroughly cleared of the prejudice, when I did know the cause; and thought that even his return, and taking me in his arms, did not seem to have the same ardour with which he used to receive me, and this made me behave to him awkwardly, and I know not how, for a good while.</P>
<P>He began with a kind of an extasy upon the subject of his finding me out; how it was possible that he should have been four years in England, and had used all the ways imaginable, and could
<PB N="230" REF="244"/>
never so much as have the least intimation of me, or of any one like me; and that it was now above two years that he had despaired of it, and had given over all enquiry; and that now he should light upon me, as it were, unlooked and unsought for.</P>
<P>I could easily have accounted for his not finding me, if I had but set down the detail of my real retirement; but I gave it a new, and indeed, a truly hypocritical turn. I told him, that any-one that knew the manner of life I led, might account for his not finding me; that the retreat I had taken up, would have rendered it a hundred thou∣sand to one, that he ever found me at-all; that as I had abandoned all conversation, and had taken up another name, it was no wonder he had not met with me; that even my dress would let him see, that I did not desire to be known by any body.</P>
<P>Then he asked if I had not received some let∣ters from him? I told him, No, he had not thought fit to give me the civility of an answer to the last I wrote to him; and he could not suppose I should expect a return, after a silence in a case where I had laid myself so low, and exposed my∣self in a manner I had never been used too; and that being so justly, as I thought, punished for my weakness, I had nothing to do, but to repent of being a fool, after I had strictly adhered to a just principle before: That however, as what I did was rather from motives of gratitude, than from real weakness, however it might be construed by him, I had the satisfaction in myself of having fully discharged the debt. I added, that I had not wanted occasions of all the seeming advance∣ments
<PB N="231" REF="245"/>
which the pretended felicity of a marriage∣life was usually set-off with, and might have been what I desired not to name; but that, however low I had stooped to him, I had maintained the dignity of female liberty, against all the attacks, either of pride or avarice; and that I had been in∣finitely obliged to him for giving me an opportu∣nity to discharge the only obligation that endan∣gered me, without subjecting me to the conse∣quence; and that I hoped he was satisfied I had paid the debt, by offering myself to be chained; but was infinitely debtor to him another way, for letting me remain free.</P>
<P>He was confounded at this, but recovering him∣self a little, he said, <Q>“I run out in a discourse he hoped was over and forgotten, and he did not” intend to revive it;</Q> that upon the repulse I had given him in a case so circumstanced as his was, and after such entreaties, and such offers as he had made me, he went away with a mind heartily grieved, and full of resentment; that he had look∣ed back on the crime he had committed, with some regret, but on the cruelty of my treatment of the poor infant I went with at that time, with the utmost detestation; and that this made him un∣able to send an agreeable answer to me; for which reason he had sent none at all for some time; but that in about six or seven months those resent∣ments wearing off by the return of his affection to me, and his concern in the poor child—there he stopped, and indeed, tears stood in his eyes, while in a parenthesis, he only added, and to this mi∣nute he did not know whether it was dead or alive. He then went on, That he had yet taken up his
<PB N="232" REF="246"/>
residence here, firmly believing, that one-time or other he should meet me, or hear of me, and that some kind chance would at last throw me in his way; that he had lived thus above four years, and though his hopes were vanished, yet he had not any thoughts of removing any more in the world, unless it should be at last, as it is with other old men, he might have some inclination to go home, to die in his own country; but that he had not thought of it yet; that if I would consider all these steps, I would find some reasons to forget his first resentments, and to think that penance, as he called it, which he had undergone in search of me, an honourable amends, in reparation of the affront given to the kindness of my letter of invitation; and that we might at last make ourselves some satisfaction on both sides, for the mortifications past.</P>
<P>I confess I could not hear all this without being moved very much, and yet I continued a little stiff and formal too, a good-while. I told him, that before I could give him any reply to the rest of his discourse, I ought to give him the satisfaction of telling him, that his son was alive; and that, in∣deed, since I saw him so concerned about it, and mentioned it with such affection, I was sorry that I had not found out some way or other to let him know it sooner; but that I thought, after his slighting the mother, he had summed up his affec∣tion to the child, in the letter he had wrote to me about providing for it; and that he had, as other fathers often do, looked upon it as a birth, which being out of the way, was to be forgotten, as its beginning was to be repented of; that in provid∣ing
<PB N="233" REF="247"/>
sufficiently for it, he had done more than all such fathers used to do, and might be well satis∣fied with it.</P>
<P>He answered me, that he should have been very glad if I had been so good but to have given him the satisfaction of knowing the poor unfortunate creature was yet alive, and he would have taken some care of it upon himself, and particularly, by owning it for a legitimate child, which, where no∣body had known to the contrary, would have taken off the infamy which would otherwise cleave to it; and so the child should not, itself, have known any thing of its own disafter; but that he feared it was now too late</P>
<P>He added, that I might see by all his conduct since that, what unhappy mistake drew him into the thing at first; and that he would have been very far from doing the injury to me, or being in∣strumental to add <HI>Une Miserable,</HI> that was his word, to the world, if he had not been drawn into it, by the hopes he had of making me his own; but that, if it was possible to rescue the child from the consequences of its unhappy birth, he hoped I would give him leave to do it, and he would let me see that he had both means and affection still to do it; and that, notwithstanding all the mis∣fortunes that had befallen him, nothing that be∣longed to him, especially by a mother he had such a concern for as he had for me, should ever want what he was in a condition to do for it.</P>
<P>I could not hear this without being sensibly touched with it. I was ashamed that he should show that he had more real affection for the child, though he had never seen it in his life, than I that
<PB N="234" REF="248"/>
bore it; for indeed, I did not love the child, not love to see it; and though I had provided for it, yet I did it by Amy's and had not seen it above twice in four years; being privatel resolved that when it grew up, it should not be able to call me mother.</P>
<P>However, I told him, the child was taken care of, and that he need not be anxious about it, un∣less he suspected, that I had lets affection for it than he had; that, I assured him, I had made my will, and that I had left it five thousand pounds, and the interest of it till he should come of age, if I died before that time; that I would still be as good as that to it; but if he had a mind to take it from me, into his government, I would not be against it; and to satisfy him that I would per∣form what I said, I would cause the child to be delivered to him, and the five thousand pounds also for its support; depending upon it, that he would show himself a father to it, by what I saw of his affection to it now.</P>
<P>I had observed that he had hinted two or three times, in his discourse, his having had misfortunes in he world, and I was a little surprised at the expression, especially at the repeating it so often; but I took no notice of that part yet.</P>
<P>He thanked me for my kindness to the child, with a tenderness which shewed the sincerity of all he had said before; and which encreased the re∣gret with which, as I said, I looked back on the little affection I had shewed to the poor child. He told me, he did not desire to take him from me, but so as to introduce him into the world as his own; which he could still do, having lived absent
<PB N="235" REF="249"/>
from his other children so long; for he had two sons and a daughter which were brought up at Nimmeguen in Holland, with a sister of his, that he might very well send another son of ten years old to be bred up with them; and suppose his mother to be dead or alive, as he found occasion; and that as I had resolved to do so handsomely for the child, he would add to it something considerable. Tho' having had some great disappointments, repeating the words, he could not do for it as he would otherwise have done.</P>
<P>I then thought myself obliged to take notice of his having so often mentioned his having met with disappointments. I told him, I was very sorry to hear he had met with any thing afflicting to him in the world; that I would not have any thing belonging to me, add to his loss, or weaken him in what he might do for his other children; and that I would not agree to his having the child away, though the proposal was infinitely to the child's advantage, unless he would promise me, that the whole expence should be mine; and that if he did not think five thousand pounds enough for the child, I would give it more.</P>
<P>We had so much discourse upon this, and the old affairs, that it took up all our time at his first visit. I was a little importunate with him, to tell me how he came to find me out, but he put it off for that time; and only obtaining my leave to visit me again, he went away; and indeed, my heart was so full with what he had said already, that I was glad when he went. Sometimes I was full of tenderness and affection for him, and espe∣cially when he expressed himself so earnestly and
<PB N="236" REF="250"/>
passionately about the child; other times I was crowded with doubts about his circumstances; sometimes I was terrified with apprehensions, lest, if I should come into a close correspondence with him, he should any way come to hear what kind of life I had led in Pall-Mail, and in other places, and it might make me miserable afterwards; from which last thought I concluded, that I had better repulse him again, than receive him. All these thoughts, and many more, crowded in so fast upon me, that I wanted to give vent to them, and get rid of him, and was very glad when he was gone.</P>
<P>We had several meetings after this, in which still we had so many preliminaries to go through, that we scarce ever bordered upon the main sub∣ject. Once indeed, he said something of it, and I put it off with a kind of a jest. <Q>“Alas!' says I, those things are out of the question now; 'tis almost an age since those things were talked be∣tween us; you see I am grown an old woman” since that.'</Q> Another time he gave a little hint at it again, and I laughed again:—<Q>“Why, what dost thou talk of,' said I, in a formal way. Dost thou not see I am turned quaker? I can∣not” speak of those things now.'</Q>—'Why,' says he, <Q>“Quakers marry as well as other people, and love one another as well; besides, the Quakers” dress does not ill become you,' and so jest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with me again, and so it went off for a third time;</Q> however, I began to be kinder to him in process of time, as they call it, and we grew very in∣timate.</P>
<P>About a month before this time, I received a dif∣ferent account of the death of my husband, the
<PB N="237" REF="251"/>
Brewer, that being commanded into the field, up∣on an occasion of some action in Flanders, he was wounded in battle, and died of his wounds in the hospital of the invalids.</P>
<P>Mr. Vandunc and I had entered into close con∣ferences upon the grand affair; and he having cleared up my doubts too, as to his circumstances, and the misfortunes he had spoken of, I had gone so far, that we had begun to consider where we should live, and in what figure; what equipage; and the like.</P>
<P>I had made some harangues upon the delight∣ful retirement of a country-life, and how we might enjoy ourselves so effectually, without the incum∣brances of business; but all this was affectation, and purely because I was afraid to make any pub∣lick appearance in the world, for fear some imper∣tinent person of quality should know me.</P>
<P>Mr. Vandunc, bred to business, and used to converse among men of business, could hardly tell how to live without it; at least, it appeared he should be like a fish out of water, uneasy and dy∣ing; but however, he joined with me, only argued that we might live as near London as we could; that he might sometimes come to change, and hear how the world should go abroad, and how it fared with his friends, and his children.</P>
<P>I answered, That if he chose still to embarrass himself with business, I supposed it would be more to his satisfaction to be in his own country, and where his family was so well known, and where his children also were.</P>
<P>He smiled at the thoughts of that, and let me know, that he should be very willing to embrace
<PB N="238" REF="252"/>
such an offer, but that he could not expect it of me, to whom England was, to be sure, so natu∣ralized now, as that it would be carrying me out of my native country, which he would not desire by any means, however agreeable it might be to him.</P>
<P>I told him, he was mistaken in me; that as I had told him so much of a married state being a captivity, and the family being a house of bondage; that when I married, I expected to be but an up∣per servant; so if I did, notwithstanding, submit to it, I hoped he should see I knew how to act the servant's part, and do every thing to oblige my master; that if I did not resolve to go with him wherever he desired to go, he might depend I would never have him; 'and did I not,' said I, 'offer 'myself to go with you to the East-Indies?'</P>
<P>All this while, this was indeed but a copy of my countenance; for as my circumstances would not admit my stay in London, at least, not so as to appear publickly; I resolved, if I took him, to live remote in the country, or go out of England with him.</P>
<P>I pretended that I wanted breath when I was in London; but that any where else I would be satisfied; and then I asked him, whether any sea∣port town in England would not suit him; be∣cause I knew, though he seemed to leave off, he would always love to be among business, and con∣versing with men of business; and I named several places; but I took care that we would resolve up∣on nothing; only by this it seemed to be certain, that we should live in England.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="253"/>
It was time now, to bring things to a con∣clusion, and so, in about six weeks time more, we settled all preliminaries.</P>
<P>First, I settled, by will, ten thousand pounds upon my two eldest daughters, for my other three children by my husband, Mr. Bacon, were dead; which, upon the decease of either, was to go to the survivor: so that this part of my wealth was given away from him. Secondly, I acquainted him with what I had done, that he should not have hereafter the least pretence to say I had deceived him in that point.</P>
<P>He replied, he was well satisfied, and, in so doing, as I had given a proof of one of my duties as a mother, he had no doubt but I should fill the rest as a wife.</P>
<P>Having, as I have said, settled all our prelimina∣naries, we were married the next morning.</P>
<P>Thus I thought myself secure, that there was an end to the intrigueing part of my life; a life full of prosperous wickedness; the reflections up∣on which, were so much more afflicting, as the time had been spent in the grossest crimes, which the more I looked back upon, the more black and horrid they appeared, effectually drinking up all the comfort and satisfaction which I might otherwise have taken in that part of life which was still before me.</P>
<P>The first satisfaction, however, that I took in the new condition I was in, was in reflecting, that at length the life of crime was over; and that I was like a passenger coming back from the In∣dies, who having, after many years fatigues and hurry in business, accumulated a good estate, with
<PB N="240" REF="254"/>
innumerable difficulties and hazards, is arrived safe at home with all his effects, and has the pleasure of saying, he shall never venture upon the seas any more.</P>
<P>When the ceremony was over, we came back immediately to my lodgings, for the Church was but just by, and we were so privately married, that none but Amy and my friend the Quaker, were acquainted with it. As soon as we came into the house, he took me in his arms, and kissing me, <Q>“Now you are my own,' says he; 'O! that you had been so good to have done this eleven years before.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Then,' said I, 'you, perhaps, would have been tired of me long ago. It is much better now; for now all our happy days are to come.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“O!' says he, 'I should not been tired of you; but I will make you pay for it all, now I have you.”</Q></P>
<P>I started at these words. <Q>“Ay,' said I, 'do you threaten already? Pray what do you mean,” my dear?'</Q> And began to look a little grave.</P>
<P><Q>“I will tell you,' says he, 'very plainly what I mean.' And still he held me fast in his arms. I intend from this time, never to trouble myself with any more business; so I shall never get one shilling for you, more than I have already; all that you shall lose one way. Next, I in∣tend not to perplex myself with any of the care or trouble of managing what either you have for me, or what I have to add to it; but you shall even take it all upon yourself, as the wives do in Holland, so you shall pay for it that way too; for all the drudgery shall be yours.
<PB N="241" REF="255"/>
Thirdly, I intend to condemn you to the constant bondage of my impertinent company, for I shall tie you like a pedlar's pack at my back, I shall scarce ever be from you; for, I am sure, I can take delight in nothing else in this world.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Very well,' says I, 'but I am pretty heavy; I hope you will set me down sometimes, when you are weary.”</Q></P>
<P>'As for that,' says he, 'tire me if you can.'</P>
<P>We were very merry the rest of the day; and at night, Amy and the Quaker put us to bed; the honest Quaker little thinking we had been a-bed together eleven years before; nay, that was a secret which, as it happened, Amy herself did not know, until I told her in our journey from Harwich. Amy grinned, and made saces, as if she had been pleased; but it came out in so many words, when he was not by: the sum of her mumbling and muttering was, that this should have been done ten or a dozen years before; that it would signify little now; that was to say, in short, that I was pretty near fifty, and too old to have any children. I child her. The Quaker laughed; complimented me upon my not being so old as Amy pretended; that I could not be forty, and might have a house full of children yet. But Amy, and I too, knew better than she how it was; for, in short, I was old enough to have done breeding, however I looked; but I bid her hold her tongue.</P>
<P>In the morning my Quaker came and visited us, before we were up, and brought us cakes and chocolate; and then left us again, and bid us take
<PB N="242" REF="256"/>
a nap upon it, which I believe we did; in short, she treated us so handsomely, and with such an agreeable chearfulness, as well as plenty, as made it appear to me, that Quakers may, and that this Quaker did, understand good-manners, as well as any other people. I say, she entertained us so ele∣gantly the whole week of our wedding, and with such a profusion of all sorts of delicacies, that in consideration of the extraordinary expence she had been at, knowing in this case, she making a point of it, she would not accept of any thing herself, that I made her four daughters a present of five guineas each.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>Benevolence a Virtue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE lived this week in all the innocent mirth imaginable; and our good-humoured Qua∣ker was so pleasant in her way, that it was particu∣larly entertaining to us. We had no musick or dancing; only I now and then sung a French song, to divert my husband, and an English one to divert my friend; and the privacy of our mirth, greatly added to the pleasure of it. I did not make any cloaths for my wedding, having a great many rich cloaths by me, which, with a little altering for the fashion, were perfectly new. The next day, he pressed me to dress, though we had no company. At last, jesting with him, I told him, I believed I was able to dress me so, in one
<PB N="243" REF="257"/>
kind of dress that I had by me, that he would not know his wife when he saw her, especially if any body else was by: No! he said, that was im∣possible; and he longed to see that dress. I told him I would dress me in it, if he would promise me never to desire me to appear in it before company. He promised he would not, but wanted to know why too; as husbands you know are inquisitive creatures, and love to enquire after any thing they think is kept from them; but I had an answer ready for him; 'Because,' said I, 'it is not a decent dress in 'this country, and would not look modest;' neither indeed, would it, for it was but one degree off from appearing in one's shift; but was the usual wear in the country where they were used. He was satisfied with my answer, and gave me his promise never to ask me to be seen in it before company. I then withdrew, taking only Amy and the Quaker with me; and Amy dressed me in my Turkish habit, which I danced in at the masquerade. The Quaker was charmed with the dress, and merrily said, That if such a dress should come to be worn here, she should be tempted, she believed, to try how she would look in it; 'That you may do now,' said I. 'No, no,' said she, 'that would be vanity indeed.'</P>
<P>When the dress was put on, I loaded it with jewels, and in particular, I placed the large breast-jewel, which he had given me, of a thou∣sand pistoles, upon the front of the head-dress; where it made a most glorious show indeed. I had my own diamond necklace on, and my
<PB N="244" REF="258"/>
hair was tout brilliant, all glittering with jew∣els.</P>
<P>His picture set with diamonds, I had placed, stitched to my vest, just, as might be supposed, upon my heart, which is the compliment in such cases among the Eastern people, and all being open at the breast, there was no room for any thing of a jewel there. In this figure, Amy holding the train of my robe, I came down to him. He was surprised, and perfectly astonished; he knew me, to be sure, because I had prepared him, and because there was nobody else there but the Quaker and Amy; but he by no means knew Amy, for she had dressed herself in the ha∣bit of a Turkish slave, being the garb of my little Turk, which I had at Naples. She had her neck and arms bare, was bare-headed, her hair braided in a long tassel hanging down her back; but the jade could neither hold her countenance, or her chattering tongue, so as to be concealed long.</P>
<P>He was so charmed with this dress, that he would have me sit and dine in it; but it was so thin, and so open before, and the weather being also sharp, that I was afraid of taking cold; how∣ever, the fire being enlarged, and the doors kept shut, I sat to oblige him; and he professed, he never saw so fine a dress in his life: I afterwards told him that my husband, so he called the jew∣eller that was killed, bought it for me, at Leg∣horn, with a young Turkish slave, which I parted with at Paris; and that it was by the help of that slave that I learned how to dress in it, and how every thing was to be worn, and many of the Turkish customs also, with some of their lan∣guage;
<PB N="245" REF="259"/>
this story agreeing with the fact, only changing the person, was very natural, and so it went off with him; but there was good reason why I should not receive any company in this dress, that is to say, not in England; I need not repeat it, as you may, probably, hear more of it.</P>
<P>But when I came abroad, I frequently put it on, and, upon two or three occasions, danced in it, but always at his request.</P>
<P>We continued at the Quaker's lodgings for above a year; for now making as though it was difficult to determine where to settle in England to his satisfaction, unless in London, which was not to mine, I pretended to make him an offer, that to oblige him, I began to incline to go and live abroad with him; that I knew nothing could be more agreeable to him, and that, as to me, every place was alike; that as I had lived abroad without a husband so many years, it could be no burthen to me to live abroad again, especially with him; and I could not but know that his native country, where his children were breeding up, must be most agreeable to him, and that if I was of such value to him, I would be there then, to enhance the rate of his satisfaction; that wherever he was, would be a home to me; and any place in the world would be England to me, if he was with me; and thus, I brought him to give me leave to oblige him with going to live abroad, when in truth, I could not have been perfectly easy at liv∣ing in England, unless I had kept constantly within doors; lest some time or other, the disso∣lute life I had lived here, should have come to be known, and all those wicked things have been
<PB N="246" REF="260"/>
known too, which I now began to be very much ashamed of.</P>
<P>When we closed up our wedding week, in which our Quaker had been so very handsome to us, I told him how much I thought we were obliged to her for her generous carriage to us; how she had acted the kindest part through the whole, and what a faithful friend she had been to me upon all occasions; and then letting him know a little of her family unhappinesses, I proposed, that I thought I not only ought to be grateful to her, but really to do something extraordinary for her, towards making her easy in her affairs; and I added, that I had no hangers-on, that should trouble him; that there was nobody belonging to me, but what was thoroughly provided for, and that if I did something for this honest woman, that was considerable, it should be the last gift I would give to any body in the world but Amy; and as for her, we were not going to part with, but whenever any thing offered for her, we would do as we saw cause; that Amy was not poor; that she had saved between seven and eight hundred pounds; by the way I did not tell him how, and by what means she had got it, but that she had it; and that was enough to let him know she would never be in want of us.</P>
<P>My husband was exceedingly pleased with my discourse about the Quaker, made a kind of speech to me upon the subject of gratitude; told me, it was one of the brightest parts of a Lady; that it was so twisted with honesty, nay, and even with religion too, that he questioned whether either of them could be found, where gratitude was not to
<PB N="247" REF="261"/>
be found; that in this act there was not only gra∣titude, but charity; and that to make charity still more Christian-like, the object too had real merit to attract it; he therefore agreed to my proposal with chearfulness, only would have had me let him pay it out of his effects.</P>
<P>I told him, as for that, I did not design, what∣ever I had said formerly, that we should have two pockets; and that though I had talked to him of being a free woman, and an independant, and he had offered and promised that I should keep all my own estate in my own hands; yet, that since I had taken him, I would even do as other ho∣nest wives did, where I thought fit to give myself, I should give what I had too; that if I reserved any thing, it should be only in case of mortality, and that I might divide it between his children and my own afterwards, as my own gift; and that, in short, if he thought fit to join stocks, we would see what strength we could both make up in the world, and bringing it all together, consider, before we resolved upon the place of removing, how we should dispose of what we had, as well as of ourselves. This discourse was too obliging, and he too much a man of sense, not to receive it as it was meant; he only answered, we would do in that as we should both agree; but the thing under our present care, was to shew not gratitude only, but charity and affection too, to our kind friend the Quaker; and would willingly have left it to me. But I told him I thought it would come better from himself, and whatever he approved of. I should approve. He then said, he would make her a present of a purse of a hundred guineas, as
<PB N="248" REF="262"/>
an earnest of his intentions, and settle upon her, but in such a manner, as not to be in the power of any person to reach, but herself, forty pounds per an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um for her life, secured any way as she should desire. This was a great kindness, and, indeed, shewed the generous principles of my husband, and for that reason I mention it.</P>
<P>In the evening, when we were just going to bed, he took my Quaker by the hand, and with a kiss, told her, that we had been very kindly treated by her from the beginning of this affair, and his wife before, as she had informed him; and that he thought himself bound to let her see, that she had obliged friends who knew how to be grateful; that for his part of the obligation, he de∣sired she would accept of that, for an acknow∣ledgment in part only, putting the purse into her hand, and that his wife would talk with her about what farther he had to say to her; and upon that, not giving her time to reply, away he went up stairs into our bedchamber, leaving her confused, and not knowing what to say.</P>
<P>When he was gone, she began to make to me very handsome and obliging representations of her good-will to us both, but that it was without expectation of reward; that I had given her several valuable presents before, and how she was obliged by me on many other occasions; that she was not in condition to show her gratitude any other way, not being able to make a suitable return; and that now we took from her all op∣portunity to ballance my former friendship, and left her more in debt than she was before: she spoke this in a very good kind of a manner, in
<PB N="24" REF="263"/>
her own way, but which was very agreeable in∣deed, and had as much apparent sincerity, and I verily believe as real, as was possible to be ex∣pressed; but I put a stop to it, and bid her say no more, but accept of what my husband had given her, which was but in part, as she had heard him say; and <Q>“Put it up,' says I, 'and come and sit down here, and give me leave to say something else to you on the same head, which Mr. Vandunc and I have settled between” ourselves, in your behalf.</Q></P>
<P>'What dost thee mean?' said she, and blush'd, and looked surprised, but did not stir; she was going to speak again, but I interrupted her, and told her, she should make no more apologies of any kind whatever, for I had better things than all this to talk to her of; so I went on, and told her, that as she had been so friendly and kind to us on every occasion; and that her house was the lucky place where we came together; and that she knew I was, from her own mouth, acquainted in part, with her circumstances, we were resolved she should be the better for us as long as she lived: Then I told her what we had resolved to do for her, and that she had nothing more to do, but to consult with me how it should be effectually se∣cured for her, distinct from any of the effects which were her husband's: and that if her hus∣band did so supply her, that she could live com∣fortably, and not want it for bread, or other ne∣cessaries, she should not make use of it, but lay up the income of it, and add it every year to the principal, so to encrease the annual payment, which in time, and perhaps before she might
<PB N="250" REF="264"/>
come to want it, might double itself; that we were very willing whatever she should so lay up, should be to herself, and whoever she thought fit after her; but that the forty pound a year, must re∣turn to our famly, after her life; which we both wished might be long and happy.</P>
<P>Let no reader wonder at my extraordinary concern for this poor woman; or at my giving my bounty to her a place in this account; it is not, I assure you, to make a pageantry of my charity, or to value myself upon the greatness of my soul, that should give in so profuse a manner; but there was another spring from whence all flow'd, and it is on that account I speak of it: Was it possible I could think of a poor desolate woman with four children, and her husband gone from her, and perhaps good for little if he had stayed; I say, was I, that had tasted so deep of the sorrows of such a kind of widowhood, able to look on her, and think of her circum∣stances, and not be touched in an uncommon manner? No, I never looked on her, and her fa∣mily, though she was not left so helpless and friendless as I had been, without remembring my own condition, as the reader already knows; nor could I look on her children, though not poor and perishing, like mine, without tears; reflect∣ing on the dreadful condition that mine were re∣duced to, when poor Amy sent them all to their aunt's, and ran away and left them there; these were the original springs, or fountain-head, from whence my affectionate thoughts were moved to assist this amiable woman.</P>
<P>This, I say, was, however, the spring of my concern for this honest, friendly and grateful
<PB N="251" REF="265"/>
Quaker, and as I had so plentiful a fortune in the world, I resolved she should taste the fruit of her kind usage to me, in a manner that she could not expect.</P>
<P>All the while I talked to her, I saw the dis∣order of her mind; the sudden joy was too much for her, and she coloured, trembled, changed, and at last grew pale, and was indeed near faint∣ing; when she hastily rung a little bell for her maid, who, coming in immediately, she beckoned to her, for speak she could not, to fill her a glass of wine, but she had no breath to take it in, and was almost choaked with that which she took in her mouth. I saw she was ill, and assisted her what I could, and with spirits and things to smell to, just kept her from fainting, When she beck∣oned to her maid to withdraw, and immediately burst out in crying, and that relieved her. When she recovered herself a little, she flew to me, and throwing her arms about my neck, 'O!' says she, 'thou hast almost killed me;' and there she hung, laying her head in my neck for several minutes, not able to speak, but sobbing like a child that had been whipped.</P>
<P>Nor did our kindness to the Quaker end with the forty pound a year, for we were always, while we stayed with her, giving her one good thing or another; and instead of lodging with her, she boarded with us, for I kept the house, and she and all her family eat and drank with us, and yet we paid her the rent of the house too; in short, I remembered my widowhood, and I made this widow's heart glad many a day the more, upon that account.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="266"/>
And now my husband and I began to think of going over to Holland, where I had proposed to him to live, and in order to settle all the pre∣liminaries of our future manner of living, I began to draw in my effects, so as to have them all at command, upon whatever occasion we thought fit; after which, one morning I called Mr. Vandune up to me; 'My dear,' said I to him, 'there they are, take all that I have got;' and threw them down upon the table, my several securities upon estates, which I had upon mort∣gages, with the rest of my writings which I had purchased! and when they were summed up, they amounted to above forty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>But let nobody conclude, from the strange suc∣cess I met with in all my wicked doings, and the vast estate which I had raised by it, that therefore I either was happy or easy: no, there was a dart struck into my liver; there was a secret hell within, even all the while, when our joy was at the highest; but more especially now, after it was all over, and when, according to all appearance, I was one of the happiest women upon earth; all this while, I say, I had such a constant terror upon my mind, as gave me frequently very terrible shocks, and which made me expect something very frightful upon every accident of life.</P>
<P>With this estate, settled as you have heard, and with the best husband in the world, I lest England again. I had not only in human pru∣dence, and by the nature of the thing, being now married and settled in so glorious a manner, I say I had not only abandoned all the gay and wicked course which I had gone through before,
<PB N="253" REF="267"/>
but I began to look back upon it with that hor∣ror, and that detestation, which is the certain companion, if not the forerunner of repentance.</P>
<P>Sometimes the wonders of my present circum∣stances would work upon me, and I should have some raptures upon my soul, upon the subject of my coming so smoothly out of the arms of Hell, that I was not ingulphed in ruin, as most who lead such lives are, first or last: but this was a flight too high for me; I was not come to that repentance that is raised from a sense of heaven's goodness; I repented of the crime, but it was of another and lower kind of repentance, and rather moved by my fears of vengeance, than from a sense of being spared from being punished, and landed safe after a storm. Now I have men∣tioned a storm, notwithstanding what Amy had before said, that she would never venture herself upon the seas again, yet, she would not leave me, and accordingly embarked with us for Holland.</P>
<P>The first thing of consequence which happened after our coming to the Hague, where we lodged for a while, was, that my husband saluted me one morning with the title of Countess, as he said he intended to do, by having the inheritance, to which the honour was annexed, made over to him. It is true, it was a reversion, but it soon fell, and, in the mean time, as all the brothers of a Count are called Counts, so I had the title by courtesy, a little before I had it in reality.</P>
<P>I was now in the height of my glory and pro∣sperity, and I was called the Countess de Wint∣selsheim, for I had obtained that unlooked for, which I secretly aimed at. I took now more
<PB N="254" REF="268"/>
servants lived in real magnificence; was called <HI>tour honour</HI> at every word, and had a coronet upon my coach; though at the same time I knew little or nothing of my new pedigree.</P>
<P>The first thing that my husband took upon him to manage, was to declare ourselves married eleven years before our arriving in Holland; and consequently to acknowledge our little son, who was yet in England, to be legitimate; order him to be brought over, and added to his family, and acknowledge him to be our own.</P>
<P>This was done by giving notice to his people at Nimmeguen, where his children, which were two sons and a daughter, were brought up, that he was come over from England, and that he was arrived at the Hague, with his wife, and should reside there some time; and that he would have his two sons brought down to see him, which accordingly was done, and where I entertained them with all the kindness and tenderness that they could expect from their mother-in-law; and who pretended to be so ever since they were two or three years old.</P>
<P>This, supposing us to have been so long mar∣ried, was not difficult at all, in a country where we had been seen together about that time, and where we had never been seen afterwards, till we now returned together? this being seen together, was also openly owned, and acknowledged of course, by our friend the merchant at Rotterdam; and also by the people in the house where we both lodged, in the same city, and where our first intimacies began, and who, as it happened, were all alive; and therefore to make it the more
<PB N="255" REF="269"/>
public, we made a tour to Rotterdam again, lodged in the same house, and were visited there by our friend the Merchant, and afterwards in∣vited frequently to his house, where he treated us very genteely.</P>
<P>This conduct of my spouse, and which he ma∣naged extremely well, was, indeed, a testimony of a wonderful degree of honesty and affection to our little son, for it was done purely for the sake of the child.</P>
<P>I call it honest affection, because it was from a principle of honesty that he so earnestly con∣cerned himself, to prevent the scandal which would otherwise have fallen upon the child, who was itself innocent; and as it was from this prin∣ciple of justice that he so earnestly solicited me, and conjured me by the natural affections of a mother, to marry him, when it was yet young within me, and unborn, that the child might not suffer for the sin of its father and mother; so tho' at the same time he really loved me, yet I had reason to believe, that it was from this principle of justice to the child, that he came to England again to seek me, with design to marry me, and, as he called it, save an innocent lamb from an in∣famy worse than death.</P>
<P>It is with a just reproach to myself, that I must repeat it again, that I had not the same concern for it, though it was the child of my own body; nor had I ever the hearty affectionate love to the child, that he had; what the reason of it was, I cannot tell; and indeed, I had shewn a general neglect of the child through all the gay years of my London revels, except that I sent Amy to
<PB N="256" REF="270"/>
look upon it now and then, and to pay for its nurs∣ing; as for me, I scarce saw it four times in the first four years of its life, and often wished it would go quietly out of the world; whereas a son which I had by Mr. Dazzle the jeweller, I took a different care of, and shewed a differ∣ent concern for, for I provided very well for him; had him put out genteely to school, and when he came to years fit for it, let him go over with a person of honesty and good business, to the Indies; and after he had lived there some time, and began to act for himself, sent him over the value of 2000l. at several times, with which he traded and grew rich.</P>
<P>My husband and I lived a very regular con∣templative life, and in itself certainly a life filled with all human felicity: but if I looked upon my present situation with satisfaction, as I cer∣tainly did, so in proportion I on all occasions looked back on former things with detestation, and with the utmost affliction; and now indeed, and not till now, those reflections began to prey upon my comforts, and lessen the sweets of my other enjoyments: they might be said to have gnawed a hole in my heart before, but now they made a hole quite through it; now they eat into all my pleasant things, made bitter every sweet, and mixed my sighs with every smile.</P>
<P>Not all the affluence of a plentiful fortune; not a hundred thousand pounds estate; for be∣tween us we had little less, not honour and titles, attendants and equipages; in a word, not all the things we call pleasure, could give me any relish, or sweeten the taste of things to me, at least, not
<PB N="257" REF="271"/>
so much, but I grew sad, heavy, pensive, and melancholly; eat little, and slept less; dreamed continually of the most frightful and terrible things imaginable, so that in the morning, when I should rise, and be refreshed with the blessing of rest, I was hagridden with frights, and terrible things, formed merely in the imagination; and was either tired and wanted sleep, or over-run with vapours, and not fit for conversing with my family, or any one else.</P>
<P>My husband, the tenderest creature in the world, and particularly so to me, was in great concern for me, and did every thing that lay in his power to comfort and restore me; strove to reason me out of it; then tried all the ways possible to divert me; but it was all to no purpose, or but to very little.</P>
<P>My only relief was, sometimes to unbosom my∣self to poor Amy, when she and I were alone; and she did all she could to comfort me, but all was to little effect there; for though Amy was the better penitent before, when we had been in the storm; Amy was just where she used to be, now a wild, gay, unthinking wretch, and not much the graver for her age; for Amy was between forty and fifty by this time too; though a very desirable woman still.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>Which concludes the History.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN less than nine months after our arrival in Holland, a terrible disaster happened to me. My husband was taken ill of a violent fever, and died in a few days; leaving me executrix to the whole of his effects, excepting ten thousand pounds to each of his three children by a former wife; but, before this misfortune, he had provided hand∣somely for our son, and sent him to Bengal, from which place I have lately heard from him.</P>
<P>When I had settled all my affairs in Holland, I returned again to England, with my two daugh∣ters, and my maid Amy, and took a very genteel house at Clapton; where, with another maid ser∣vant, a coachman, and footman, we all lived re∣tired, and happily together.</P>
<P>As soon as I came back to London, I went to see my friend the Quaker; with this agreeable companion, both at her house and mine, I spent many a chearful hour, nay many a chearful month, for we were seldom asunder; till at length, she having disposed of the three eldest of her daughters in marriage to worthy men, and her brother having no children, took the fourth to himself, I prevailed upon her to leave off house∣keeping, and retire to Clapton with me; here we lived together, a sociable and a rational life, generally employing curselves in innocent amuse∣ments at home, or in exercise abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="273"/>
I had not been at Clapton above a year and a half, when perceiving a Gentleman step out of a chariot opposite my house, occasioned by an acci∣dent which happened to one of the wheels; I sent a servant with my compliments to desire the Gen∣tleman to walk in, until the wheel was repaired. As soon as he made his appearance in the par∣lour, I gave a shriek, fell back in my chair, and fainted away.</P>
<P>When I came to myself, I perceived he had both my hands fast in his. 'How is it with you, <Q>“Madam?' says he; and exclaimed, 'good God? what happiness is this in being blessed with the sight of you again so unexpectedly.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Blessed indeed! said I; 'happy misfortune, to see you after so long a separation, for I never expected to behold you more.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Indeed, Madam,' said he, 'I am as much surprised as you can be, I thought you had been out of the kingdom.”</Q></P>
<P>Here he related to me the happiness he had enjoyed in the married state, but, as it had pleased Heaven to deprive him of what he then held most dear in taking his wife from him, if I was under no engagement to another, he should think it the greatest happiness to be allied to me.</P>
<P>By this time, I imagine, gentle reader, you are impatient to know who this extraordinary person was, and therefore, that I may not trespass too much on your good-nature, I will inform you, it was my dear friend, and companion, Mr. Wor∣thy, whom you have, in this history, been already acquainted with.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="274"/>
A little after his chariot was ready, he, first desiring me to admit him to see me again, saluting me, took his leave.</P>
<P>When he was gone, and I had returned to the parlour, my companion the Quaker, for she was with us great part of the time; 'Friend,' says she, <Q>“this affair of thine hath alarmed thee much, and greatly exceedeth thy meeting with thy for∣mer friend thy Dutch merchant; but, if it endeth as happily, thou wilt have cause to be very thankful for the event; and, surely, thee must have something greatly affecting in thy story.”</Q></P>
<P>I smiled, and said; <Q>“Indeed it hath greatly alarmed me; and, as I find you are inclined to hear it, I will be brief.”</Q></P>
<P>Here I acquainted her with some part of what the reader already knows, and by my concealing the criminal part, such was, and ever will be the effect, in our relating our own story, that it appeared to her, as a chaste and regular courtship.</P>
<P>The next day, as indeed I expected, Mr. Worthy come again, and after the tea equipage was removed, my friend the Quaker, rightly guessing a third person to be needless, left us to ourselves; and, though he stayed above two hours, it is immaterial to relate any part of our conversa∣tion, it being only upon common topics, not worthy of being recorded in this history; but, with this addition, I assure my reader, that nothing passed between us, that would have enabled a third person, nay even in my friend the Quaker, to have occasioned a blush.</P>
<P>While my Quaker and I were at supper, I perceived her to smile, and look very well
<PB N="261" REF="275"/>
pleased, and when the cloth was removed, says she; <Q>“Friend, I wonder thou art so pensive, I expected to have seen thee in gay spirits, and not so melancholy as thou seemest to be.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My dear friend,' said I, 'I am not melan∣choly; it is true, I am a little thoughtful, at my meeting with an old acquaintance, whom I had not the least expectation of seeing.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Truly, Friend,' says she, 'it cannot be a common acquaintance, for those who are indif∣ferent to us, seldom employ our thoughts, espe∣cially when absent, which, at present, thee know∣est is thy own case; but, come be chearful, thee wilt see him again I hope, if it will be for thy good.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I hope so too,' said I, 'for he promised me to dine here the day after to-morrow; and I know him to be a punctual observer of his en∣gagements. But pray, Friend, how do you like him? or, what do you think of him? Is not he handsome man?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Whatever may be my thoughts,' said she, concerning thy friend, I can perceive thou thinkest him so; and if thee hadst not said it, I could see plainly thou likedst him at thy first interview, when he came into the parlour yester∣day; but, thee wilt excuse the freedom I have taken, in giving my sentiments, as thou hast extorted them from me by thy questions.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My dear Friend,' says I, 'still you have not answered my questions; I asked you concern∣ing Mr. Worthy, not concerning myself, and you have given your opinion-relative to me only,
<PB N="262" REF="276"/>
and it was of him that I requested your senti∣ments.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why then,' said she, in very good temper, since thou wilt have me speak, I think that thou likest him, better than he liketh thee, or, in other words, thou appearest fonder of him, than thy friend doth of thee; and, that I may now come to thy question, my opinion is, thee art as handsome for a woman, as he is for a man; and now, I hope, I have answered thy request; though, perhaps, I may tell thee my mind more fully hereafter.”</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Worthy came according to his promise, and after he had taken his leave and was gone, my Quaker began. <Q>“A mighty agreeable sociable companion, is this, thy friend, I do not now wonder at thy partiality towards him, a man of such good morals, for I do not here speak of his person, though that is unexceptionable, al∣most any woman, unengaged, might lawfully give her hand and heart too; as, I doubt not, at a proper season, thou wouldst most willingly do it thyself.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“So then, Friend,' says I, 'if I understand you right, you would have no objection to him yourself, if you was an unmarried wo∣man.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have not told thee so,' says she, smiling; why wilt thou wrest, and extort my words to thy own meaning? what might to thee be a∣greeable, might not be so to me, I am not ena∣moured with thy friend, though I have my reasons to think that thou art.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="263" REF="277"/>
'Pray, my dear Friend,' said I, 'what may be your reasons in thinking so? I am in high spirits and should be glad to hear.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“First then,' said she, 'thee speakest but little thyself. Secondly, thou art very attentive to all thy friend sayeth. And thirdly, thou frequent∣ly rivettest thy eyes so stedfastly on his, that I must have been blind and deaf not to have dis∣covered thy motives; if these are not reasons sufficient for my suspicions, for thy love and affection to him, I know not what are.”</Q></P>
<P>I could not help smiling at my Quaker's de∣scription of the passion of love; and the next visit Mr. Worthy made me, I told him, before her, the whole of what she had said, and though she blushed exceedingly, it pleased him, and we all spent the evening very agreeably together.</P>
<P>Within a month after this, I acquainted her, Mr. Worthy had been very pressing for me to consent, as he was pleased to call it, to his happi∣ness; that as to my own fortune, he would leave it to me in what manner I should chuse to settle it, and, as I had two daughters, he said, it was ex∣tremely proper they should be provided for; with a great many kind expressions concerning myself: <Q>“And though they were pleasing to me, my dear Friend, would afford but little pleasure for you to hear; therefore, I shall omit them, and pro∣ceed” to acquaint you with my answer to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. Worthy, your generosity towards me, and my girls, demands my acknowledgments; and as we are upon a serious subject, you will” permit me to make as serious a reply.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="264" REF="278"/>
“Without entering into a detail of particulars on your part, I flatter myself, whatever you have said, and the many high compliments you have paid to my person, has proceeded from sincerity only; and to do you justice, Mr. Worthy, I assure you I have not the least doubt of your veracity in any one instance; yet, I am afraid, you know not what you request; I am not the woman I was, though, by your smiling, you seem to think I am. Here, my dear Friend, he made several protestations, and kissing me with great eagerness; I will leave you to imagine whether I was most offended or pleased at his behaviour.” But to proceed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As you have, I said, never enquired, Mr. Worthy, concerning my fortune, I must con∣clude you have a plentiful one of your own; however, be that as it may, I shall deal ingenu∣ously with you, I have already settled one third of mine, upon each of my daughters; and, if our affair does not take place, the whole that I may be possessed of, at my decease, excepting some few legacies, will be equally divided between” them.</Q></P>
<P>'My dear Love,' said he, taking me by the hand, with a great deal of tenderness, 'have you 'done?'</P>
<P>With the same tenderness, on my part, I re∣plied, I had.</P>
<P><Q>“Why then,' said he, 'my fortune, thank Heaven, is sufficient for us both, and whatever you intended for me, shall be settled upon your∣self, to dispose as you please; it is your dear person I aspire to, and that only; name the day, so it be but shortly, and I shall be happy.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="265" REF="279"/>
“His behaviour, my dear Friend, overcame me, and in the warmth of my love, I told him, yes, my fair Friend, I told him, for I could not conceal it any longer, I had still twenty thousand pounds left for him, and as he desired I would fix the day of our marriage, he should be master, both of that sum, and me, any time the following week, whenever he pleased; and Thurs∣day next is the day fixed upon, when, and where, I hope you will have no objection to be present” at the ceremony.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Objection!' said my Quaker, 'no truly; and I hope thee wilt not let me be idle, for thee must have a great many preparations to make a∣gainst” the time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Whatever they may be,' said I, 'you shall,” I promise you, be as busy as you please.</Q> And, indeed, she was of great service to me, and it was concluded so privately, that none, but my own family knew of any such transaction in agitation, until it was over.</P>
<P>When we were returned home from church, I immediately went up stairs to my dressing∣room; the Quaker following me said, <Q>“Thee remembereth how merry we were, when I put thee to bed, when thee wert married, to Mr. Vandunc, the Dutch Merchant; pray let us be as merry to-night, and I imagine we shall be so, for thy husband seemeth to be a very good-tempered” man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He is so indeed, my Friend,' said I, 'and you will be sensible of it before the week” be out.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="280"/>
Our Quaker, for I left it to her management, provided an elegant dinner, and we were all as rationally delighted as we could desire, the whole day, and evening also. About eleven o'clock, the Quaker and Amy put me to bed, when presently after in came Mr. Worthy; and after the usual ceremonies on such occasions, they smilingly wished us a good night, shut the door, and left us.</P>
<P>In a few days after, when we had dined, and the cloth was removed, my husband said to the Quaker, <Q>“What is the matter with you Madam? you are not so chearful as you usually are; you have lost your vivacity, do you wish for” another wedding?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“No Friend,' says she, 'I am thinking thou art, though undesignedly, the greatest enemy I have; for I perceive plainly, not only from thyself, but also from thy wife, that I am not likely to have much of her company when thee” art in the way.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well Friend,' said I, merrily, 'do not be cast down, and to make you amends, whenever I gossip abroad, you shall have his company at” home; will that content you?</Q> This put an end to our dialogue, for the present, and we were all, shortly, as chearful as usual.</P>
<P>Thus time glided away in the utmost harmony, for above eighteen months; when, a little incident had liked to have given me a great uneasiness.</P>
<P>One afternoon, as I entered my bed-chamber, who should I see before me, but my husband and my Quaker sitting closely together. Alarmed as I was, I had the presence of mind to say, smiling;
<PB N="267" REF="281"/>
'So, my dear, how do you like my friend?' And immediately went to my looking-glass, with seemingly a great deal of coolness.</P>
<P>Instead of he answering me, she replied: <Q>“Friend, do not thee be uneasy, our discourse is” only concerning thee.'</Q> Had I then considered the affair rightly, I should not have had any occa∣sion to be uneasy, the door being wide open; and both of them were as unconcerned upon my coming in, as if it had only been my lap-dog, who had entered the room; therefore, I say, had I consi∣dered the matter rightly, I had little reason to be alarmed, but, the circumstance of finding a female in the company of my husband, in my bed-cham∣ber, I confess, occasioned in me an idea of crimi∣nality. This I might have concealed from the reader, as neither my husband, or my Quaker, had ever the least surmize of my suspicion; and to do them both the justice they deserved, I con∣fess, it was highly wrong in me to harbour a thought so much to their prejudice.</P>
<P><Q>“Pray, Friend,' says I, laughing, 'what was your discourse concerning me?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, thy husband,' says she, 'has been telling me that thou art the best wife in the world; and I said, you was even with him, I was sure, for that you thought his equal could not be found; and now, I doubt not, but thou” wilt be vain from what he hath said.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, Friend,' said I, 'will you call it vanity, in my having a better opinion of myself, from the sentiments my husband has entertained of me? If so, vanity may belong to those only who are most worthy of praise; and she who,
<PB N="268" REF="282"/>
perhaps, may not be possessed of one virtue, may be free from that vice. However, if being pleased with my husband's encomiums be a fault, I am afraid, I shall be an offender to a high degree.”</Q></P>
<P>It may be wondered by the reader, why I have been so long silent concerning my two daugh∣ters, whom I had by my first husband; my other three children, which, as I said before, I had by him, were at this time dead. As they were both very likely girls, two Hamburgh Mer∣chants in the neighbourhood, soon after I came to Clapton, paid their addresses to them, both men of ample fortunes, to neither of whom could I make an objection; to these two Gentlemen, I gave my daughters in marriage, with each a portion of ten thousand pounds; and at Hamburgh they all reside. Susannah, my eldest, has lately been brought to bed of a son; and the other, Olivia, of a daughter; and in their letters they inform me they are both happy in their husbands.</P>
<P>The same remark, I am apprehensive, may be made, concerning my trusty and faithful wo∣man Amy, she who has so often been mentioned in this history. Some time since, said she to me, <Q>“Madam, I have a great favour to beg of you.”</Q></P>
<P>'What is it, Amy?' said I.</P>
<P><Q>“Why,' says she, 'as I would not do any thing of importance without your approbation, it is to know how I shall dispose of the money I have saved in your service.”</Q></P>
<P>'Why, what have you saved, Amy?'</P>
<P>'Near a thousand pounds, Madam.'</P>
<P><Q><PB N="269" REF="283"/>
“And so you want my advice in the disposal of it. Why, you simpleton, put your money out upon good securities, don't keep it by you” mouldering.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, that's as I have thought, Madam, there is one security I should be glad to part with it for.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“What security do you mean, Amy?”</Q> says I.</P>
<P><Q>“I am afraid to tell you, Madam, lest you should be angry, and yet I must tell you, if you should be so; there is Mr. James, my master's valet de chambre, Madam, has been very pressing for me to consent to marry him for these six months past. I think he is a very discreet, and a sober man, and I do not imagine I can be∣stow myself and my money better, than by hav∣ing him; do pray, Madam, let me prevail up∣on you to be of my opinion.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Well, Amy, as you tell me you are in love, I will speak to your master about Mr. James, concerning this distemper of yours, this fever of the mind.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Fever, Madam!”</Q> laughing; <Q>“I have not any fever, I am sure I am as well as ever I was in my life, as well as I was when I first came into your service.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“How long is that ago, Amy?”</Q>—<Q>“Dear Madam, Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y do not insist upon my answering that ques∣tion now, it may not be altogether so proper at this juncture.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I guess what you mean, Amy, but come how long is it since?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”How long is it since, Madam?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Why, it is turned of thirty years; we were both girls then, and though you were married
<PB N="270" REF="284"/>
to Mr. Bacon, the Brewer, you was scarce seventeen, and I remember, I was not sixteen then; and yet, thank God for it, we are both as healthy now as ever we were in our lives; and I protest, Madam, without the least flattery, you are as handsome as ever you were.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Your observations are just, Amy,”</Q> <Q>“I think we are as well in health as ever, nor can I perceive any alteration in you, and it has often been remarked to me, by others, and that very lately, what a likely woman you are; and so, indeed, I think you are, Amy, though you have been naught, as well as myself.”</Q></P>
<P>Upon the entrance of Mr. Worthy, Amy with∣drew, and I acquainted him, with what she had said concerning his Valet, with this addition, <Q>“My Dear,”</Q> says I, <Q>“it will be proper for you to question Mr. James, and if you find his engagements are similar with her's, let us give our consents to their marriage; she has been a trusty servant to me, and if they marry, I will give her, for her faithful services, a small freehold farm, which I purchased some years ago, where they may retire, and live comfort∣ably together.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Do so, my Dear,”</Q> says he, <Q>“and we will send for him in, and hear what he says.”</Q></P>
<P>Upon his entrance into the room my husband said, <Q>“James, have you any intention of altering your condition, or, in other words, have you any intention of marrying?”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Not without I have your consent, and my Lady's, Sir.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And, who is the object of your desire? says I.
<PB N="271" REF="285"/>
Your Ladyship's woman, Mrs. Amy, my Lady. She is the person I have settled my affections upon, and if I have not her, I will remain sin∣gle” as I have ever been.</Q> He then gave us so many satisfactory reasons why he prefered her to any other woman, that my husband ordered him to seek for Amy, and bring her in along with him.</P>
<P>When Amy came into the room, her face was like scarlet, and she could scarcely speak, but in a short time, recovering herself, her behaviour was such, that we gave our consents they might marry whenever they pleased, upon condition they would acquaint us with it, and that I would give them not only their wedding dinner, but I would also give them the freehold farm before mentioned.</P>
<P>This drew from James, a profusion of ac∣knowledgments for our kindnesses, as they did from poor Amy, a profusion of tears.</P>
<P>As Amy had passed for a widow, for several years, and as James did not know any thing to the contrary, nor, indeed, did any other, except∣ing myself. James easily prevailed upon her to have the wedding fixed for that day week, which ceremony was accordingly performed, and the day and evening concluded in mirth; the Quaker and I put her to-bed, and my husband was as merry as either of us.</P>
<P>I told the Quaker, for she has been a widow several months, I hope it will be your turn next.</P>
<P><Q>“Why doth thee hope so friend? I have no occasion for a male-companion, dost thee think” I have?</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="272" REF="286"/>
“Yes, yes, as much occasion as either of us. There is Mr. Trueman, our neighbour, I have observed him for some time past; I am sure he likes you, and if I am not greatly mistaken, he is not indifferent to a certain person, and if it is not” a match, I think the fault will be in yourself.</Q></P>
<P>After this, I do not know what encouragement she gave him. He came more frequently than usual, and in less than three months, matters were agreed on, and they became husband and wife, greatly to her advantage.</P>
<P>Five women in one family, each to get a good hus∣band, is a happiness seldom to be found, and what is more rare, myself, my two daughters, Amy, and the Quaker, each thinking she has the best, and indeed, they are all deserving men.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the manifold blessings which I have received, and the most endearing usage from the best of husbands, yet there is a something corroding at my heart, which gives me great un∣easiness; the life I had formerly led, for several years in adultery, disturbs me now in my serious moments; and I find by experience the splendor of this world, though it may lull and compose us for a time, will not in the end, without a thorough repentance, heal an unquiet and dis∣turbed mind.</P>
<P>It was in one of these solemn and important fits, my husband observed a tear steal down my cheek, and tenderly questioning me the occasion, I revealed to him that part of my corrupt and vicious life, with others, which, though the reader has been already acquainted with it, he, my husband, was an utter stranger to before.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="273" REF="287"/>
“My dear, do not possess your mind with ideas so afflictive; you have been an unexceptionable and a virtuous wife to me, which I doubt not will atone for follies past; and my love is so unbounded, so unlimited towards you, to see” you thus renders me miserable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Oh! my love, you are too good, too kind, to such a wretch as me; had I no other than the crime which, long since we ourselves together com∣mitted, I could not bear it now; and, though you never have reproached me with it, I have a monitor within me, that will not let me rest; and, fearful I am, I shall never know comfort” more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My dear, do not indulge such melancholy thoughts, let us chearfully return thanks to the Almighty for his goodness towards us; let us earnestly do unto others what we would have others do unto us; and we have an assurance from him, who never failed in his promise, of” our receiving a happy reward hereafter.</Q></P>
<P>Such were the cordial drops, my kind and loving husband ever endeavoured to relieve me, nor has he failed in his applications—My thoughts are more serene—I have not that tempest in my mind as heretofore—I rely on the father of all mercies, and he has given me ease—blessed be his name—now and for evermore—</P>
<P>Here the conclusion is left for me to relate, as I had it from Mr. Worthy himself. He told me, his dear and affectionate wife, for such he assured me she was to him, being sensibly touched with the remembrance of her former fol∣lies, and stedfastly relying, and frequently call∣ing
<PB N="274" REF="288"/>
upon her Redeemer, had for several months past been truly a penitent, had no sooner pro∣nounced the last sentence, than she, droping her pen, reclined her head upon his bosom, fainted, and expired.</P>
