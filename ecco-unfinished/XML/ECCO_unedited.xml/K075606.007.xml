<HEAD>A SELECT COLLECTION OF POEMS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING met with a few sportive sallies on subjects of national Satire, we have here thrown them together, not doubting but every liberal and in∣genuous Mind will consider them as mere creatures of fancy, and not be influenced a moment to form a se∣rious opinion of the People, who are the subjects of them, from these Caricatures, where every feature is distorted, and every blemish aggravated. On the con∣trary, he will consider these as professed misrepresenta∣tions, where no part of the subject is brought into view, but such as may produce burlesque, and excite ridicule. Under this qualification they may be safely laughed at, and we may be entertained with the wit or humour of the writers, without adopting their pre∣judices, or being influenced by their invectives.</P>

<P>From the dissolute turn of this poem, and the sarcasm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Republics, one can hardly believe that it was written by the famous republican Henry Neville, who had been one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Members of the Long Parliament, and was afterwards con∣cerned with Harrington in his Rota Scheme. Yet Anthony Wood-classes him with the noted Oliverian banterer Harry Marten, and mentions other pieces of drollery by Henry Neville, who lived to the year 1694, when he died in Lon∣don, aged 74. Nor, besides him, do we recollect any other poet of the name of Neville, or Nevell, during the reign of K. Charles II. when this piece was evidently written.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>A SATIRE ON THE ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH NATION IN THE ANCIENT SCOTTISH DIALECT <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As we have inserted below a poetical attack on our fellow-citizens beyond the Tweed by one of our Southern bards; it is but fair to confront it with some satirical reflections on the vanity of our own countrymen, by an ancient Scottish Satirist. This was procured from a Gentleman who extracted it from Ban∣natine's MS. of Scottish poems, preserved in the Advocates Library at Edinburgh, fo. 163. It is there intituled,
<Q>AN ANSWER TO ANE INGLISS RAILAR PRAYSING HIS AWIN GENALOGY.</Q>
Although the sarcasms, in this poem, seem now somewhat obsolete and pedant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, they were well applied at the time they were written; for whoever looks into the Chronicle of Harding, a professed antagonist of the Scots, and other con∣temporary writers, will find the Descent of the Britons (who were then confounded with the English), from Brutus much insisted on; and it is well known that K. Edward I. dated the origin of his claim to Sovereign Jurisdiction over the Kings of Scotland from the fabulous arrival of that Trojan Adventurer.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<Q>HOW THE FIRST HELAND-MAN, OF 'JOVE' WAS MAID OF A HORSS-TURD IN ARGYLE, AS IS SAID.</Q>
In the original the Interlocutors are "God and St. Peter;" which, being shockingly profane, have been every where al∣tered, as in the text. But the original shews the licentious spirit of the times, when it was written.</P>
<P>The Highlanders of old, like the ancient Heroes of Greece, considered their Depredations on their more laborious Neigh∣bours, as legitimate warlike spoils: and their Bards, no doubt, would with equal sarcasms, retort on the Lowlanders their dastardly spirit in being more addicted to agriculture, and the softer arts of peace, than themselves. This Character of some of the Highland Clans, and their fondness for plunder, is said to have continued down to our times; for the celebrated Laird of Lochiel, when he mustered his People before the young Pretender in 1745, is reported to have assured him, That his Clan should fight, or rob, with any in the world.</P>
<P>Happily the same high spirit, accompanied with jus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notions, has converted these little hostile independent tribes into honest and worthy subjects, who have afforded generous soldiers for our defence, and from being the disturbers have become the valiant protectors of the British Empire.</P></NOTE>

Vicar of Hinckley and Rector of Stoke in L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cestershire; who, with many of his Children, was a sufferer for the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se of K.

H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s eldest son John was born at Loughborough in the said county, as appears from the Register of that parish, where his baptism is entered June 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1613. Having been educated at Hinckley under the Rev. Richard Vines, (who was afterwards a celebrated preacher of the Presbyterian party) he was admitted of Christ's College, in Cambridge, September 4, 1627, and took the degree of B. A. in 1631. He thence removed to St. John's College in the same University, being elected Fellow, March 27, 1634, and became M. A. the following year, 1635. He continued for many years the delight and orname<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of that house, in which he was one of the Tutors, and, being excused from going into Holy orders, became their Rhetoric Reader, and was usually employed to draw up all Epistles and Addresses for that Society, being much admired for the purity and terseness of his Latin style. He also became celebrated for his occa∣sional Poems in English, especially on the breaking-out of the civil wars, when he is said to have been the first champion that appeared in verse for the royal cause <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Word's Athen. Oxon. <HI>2</HI>d Ed. II. f. <HI>274.</HI></NOTE>. Afterwards, when the opposite party prevailed, he retired to the king at Oxford, and was in his absence ejected from his Fellowship; April 8, 1644<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walker's Sufferings, &amp;c. pt.

This Petition (printed in his Works) is remarkable for the address with which the writer employs such moving topics as might neither do violence to his Conscience, nor betray his Cause, and yet be effectual to procure his enlargement. At length removing to Gray's Inn, London, he was there seized with an epidemical intermitting Fever, of which he died on Thurs∣day morning, April 29, 1658, in his chamber in Gray's Inn, whence his body was brought to Hunsdon House, and on Sa∣turday May 1, was interred in the parish church of St. Mi∣chael on College Hill, London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Worthies in Leicestershire.</NOTE>: his remains receiving the last honours, by the attendance of many persons eminent for their loyalty and learning, to whom his Funeral Sermon was preached by his intimate friend, the eminent Dr. Pearson, afterwards Bishop of Chester, and author of the celebrated Exposition of the Creed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dav.

<HEAD>A SATIRE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN HALL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This poet, who was born at Durham in August, 1627, after one year spent at St. John's College, Cam∣bridge, removed to Gray's Inn, London, where he was called to the Bar; but entering into the politics of the Times, and writing on subjects of that sort, he attracted the notice of parliament, who sent him into Scotland to attend Oliver Cromwell, and afterwards distinguished him by other marks of favour: but being too much addicted to pleasure, he fell a sacrifice to its indulgence, and returning to his native city of Durham, died there, Aug. 1, 1656. In 1646, (during his short residence at Cambridge) being then but 19 years of age, he published his "Horae Vacivae, or Essayes," a suf∣ficient proof of his abilities. His poems came out the same year. He published the first English version of Longinus, which he intituled "The Height of Eloquence, Lond. 1652," 8vo. This he translated from the Greek, as he also did "Hie∣rocles upon the Golden Verses of Pythagoras;" before which is an account of the ingenious translator and his works, by John Davis of Kidwelly, by whom it was published in 1657, 8vo. More of him and his writings may be seen in Wood's Athen. Oxon. 2d Ed. Vol. I. p. 534. The poems here re∣printed are taken from a little volume (thus intituled, "Po∣ems by John Hall, Cambridge, printed by Roger Daniel, Printer to the Universitie, 1646, for J. Rothwell at the Sun in Paul's Church Yard, to which in 1647 was added "The Second Booke of Divine Poems by J. H.") which is now be∣come exceedingly scarce. Recommendatory verses are pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xed to it by Jo. Pawson (his tutor), H. More, W. Dil∣ingham, W. Harrington, Ja. Windet, R. Marshall, T. Smithsby, and Edw. Holland. In the second part of Cleive∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and's Works, 8vo. 1687, (intituled "Cleiveland Revived;" which contains some pieces by Fletcher, Denham, Jasper Mayne, and Tho. Weaver, &amp;c. see Wood, II. p. 317.) are the following poems by J. Hall, who seems to have formed himself on Cleiveland's model, viz. On a little Gentleman, p. 297. On an ugly Woman, p. 298. On Parsons, the great Portes, p. 302. To Chloris. [rather Julia] p. 309. Upon Wood of Kent, p. 315. To his Mistress, p 334. On at Eunuch, p. 353. The Flight, p. 358. On a Burning Glass, p. 375. Not to Travel, p. 377.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A POETICAL PARLEY WITH A THREADBARE CLOAK.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THOMAS JORDAN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jordan was a performer belonging to the company at the Red Bull, and acted the part of Lepida in the tragedy of Messalina. He had the honour of reciting before King Charles the First a poem of his own, "at the Dedication of Mr. Tho. Bushel's Rock at Euston in Oxon, 1638, in the person of Calliope;" and was one of the few players and poets who lived to see the Restoration. In 1657 he published a co∣medy, intituled, "The Walks of Islington and Hogsdon, with the Humours of Woodstreet Compter," and a Masque called "Fancy's Festivals." He was also author of a vo∣lume, called "Wit in a Wildernesse of promiscuous Poesie," addressed, "To the liberall Lover, charitable Cherisher, and pious Preserver of Industry, Honesty, chaste Ingenuity, Science and Civility, the much honored George Lord Bishop of St. Ashaph." This volume is undated; but must have been published between 1660 and 1667, while Bp. Griffith filled the see of St. Asaph. In 1668 he published "Mo∣ney is an Ass," a comedy. On the death of John Tatham Mr. Jordan became poet to the city of London, and regularly composed their pageants from the year 1671 to 1684, when it may be presumed, he died, and was succeeded by Taubman. Another dramatic production by Mr. Jordan, called "Love hath found out his Eyes," was once in the possession of Mr. Warburton the Herald, but destroyed by the carelessness o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a servant. In the little volume of Jordan's poems are several to and from "his much honored Friend, Hen. Stonestreet, Gent. on London Bridge," the same, probably, whose poems are in my fifth volume, p. 73—81. There is also "an Epi∣taph on Thomas Milward, Gent. whose face (by general con∣ception) was very like that of K. Charles the First;" and a very good one on Sir Nath. Brent. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt. LL. D. who died in 1653. Jordan's "Encomium on R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Noses" has much hu∣mourous merit.

<Q>“Peu de livres ont eu le <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccès du 'Chef d'Oeuvre d'un Inconna.' La Preface de la premiere édition nous s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it comprendre que le commentaire du 'Chef d'Oeuvre' est imité d'après cette vaste compilation de notes qui fit naitre en 1712 le 'Pervigilium Veneris' sous la forme d'un gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s 'Variorum,' à la Haye chez Scheurler.

Peu de personnes savent que le plan de commentaire de Maître Matanase sur le 'Chef d'Oeuvre' se fit à table au commencement de l'année 1714, ent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cinq ou six amis, qui la plupart travailloient alors au premier Journal Literaire. M. Themiseuil fut chargé de l'execution, et reüssit admirablement. Ce que je viens de raporter peut expliquer ce qu'a dit l'Auteur de l' 'Etat de l'homme' dans le peché originel.' Cet Auteur a cru desho∣norer le 'Chef d'Oeuvre' en disant, 'que ce n'étoit qu'un fruit de vint et quatre heures conçu à table entre la poire et le fromage.' Un tel mépris ne sert qu'à mieux faire l'éloge de ce 'Chef d'Oeuvre', et de son Auteur.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Je dois remarquer encore à l'occasion du 'Chef d'Oeuvre' que le 'Spectateur' Anglois a taché de l'imiter par une chanson qu'il suppose deterrée dans quelque ancien Manu∣script, et qu'll accompagne de notes qui consistent unique∣ment en ces leçons connues chez les savans sous le nom de 'Variantes.' Vois 'Spectateur,' tom. V. 15 discours. Mais quelle différence entre l' imitation et l' original! La chanson et le commentaire de l'Anglois n'ont rien d'agre∣able et de piquant; et le froid de l'original est fidellement conservé dans la traduction qu'on nous a donnéc du 'Spec∣tateur.'

I doubt not but it will prove a pleasing amusement to the curious reader, to trace the first dawnings of genius in some of our first-rate poetic characters; and to compare them with the eminence they afterwards attained to, and the rank they at last held among their brethren of the laurel. Some early specimens of Dryden's genius have already been given, vol. I. p. 181; and vol. II. p. 90. Those of Cow∣ley, here printed, abound with strokes of wit, some true, but the far greater part false; which thoroughly characterise the wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, and may be justly pronounced to point out his genius and manner, in miniature. K. — This species of entertain∣ment the kind attention of Mr. Kynaston (the friend to whom I owe these remarks) enables me considerably to extend, by furnishing the earliest poetical productions of some writers who are now universally looked up to as excellent; none of which are to be found in any edition of their respective works. In such juvenile performances, it is well observed by an ad∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable critic,

<L>In private births hopes challenge the first place:</L>
<L>There 's certaintie at first in the King's race;</L>
<L>And we may say, Such will his glories be,</L>
<L>Such his great acts, and, yet not prophesie.</L>
<L>I see in him his father's boundlesse sprite,</L>
<L>Powerfull as flame, yet gentle as the light.</L>
<L>I see him through an adverse battel thrust.</L>
<L>Bedeck'd with noble sweat and comely dust.</L>
<L>I see the pietie of the day appeare,</L>
<L>Joyn'd with the heate and valour of the yeare,</L>
<L>Which happie Fate did to this birth allow:</L>
<L>I see all this; for sure 'tis present now.</L>
<L>Leave off then, London, to accuse the starres</L>
<L>For adding a worse terrour to the warres;</L>
<L>Nor quarrell with the heavens, 'cause they beginne</L>
<L>To send the worst effect and scourge of sinne,</L>
<L>That dreadfull plague, which, wheresoe're 't abide,</L>
<L>Devours both man and each disease beside.</L>
<L>For every life which from great Charles does flow,</L>
<L>And 's female self, weighs down a crowd of low</L>
<L>And vulgar souls: Fate rids of them the earth,</L>
<L>To make more room for a great Prince's birth.</L>
<L>So when the Sunne, after his watrie rest,</L>
<L>Comes dancing from his chamber of the east,</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="80"/>A thousand pettie lamps spread ore the skie,</L>
<L>Shrink in their doubtfull beams; then wink, and die:</L>
<L>Yet no man grieves; the very birds arise,</L>
<L>And sing glad notes in stead of elegies:</L>
<L>The leaves and painted flowers, which did erewhile</L>
<L>Tremble with mournfull drops, beginne to smile.</L>
<L>The losse of many why should they bemone,</L>
<L>Who for them more then many have in one?</L>
<L>How blest must thou thy self, bright Mary, be,</L>
<L>Who by thy wombe canst blesse our miserie?</L>
<L>May 't still be fruitfull! May your offspring too</L>
<L>Spread largely, as your fame and virtues do!</L>
<L>Fill every season thus: Time, which devours</L>
<L>It's own sonnes, will be glad and proud of yours.</L>

—The Publick will be pleased to find here some of the earliest poetical pieces of Edward King, of Christ's College, Cambridge, that excellent youth, whose un∣timely death (for "he was drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish seas") gave occasion to the admirable "Lycidas" of Milton.

This copy, notwithstanding the signature, is beyond a doubt the property of the facetious MATT Prior. — Hear my reasons. — It appears from a copy of Prior's admission, printed in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1779, p. 640, that Prior was admitted of Saint John's in Cambridge, April 2, 1683; and on the 3d of that month was appointed a SCHOLAR of the house, on the Dutchess of Somerset's foun∣dation, by her Grace's own nomination. — Now this year 1683 is the year of the Publication of the Cambridge Verses on the Marriage of the Prince of Denmark.—PRIOR's copy has the signature of a SCHOLAR of St. John's College. The reason of the mistake in the <HI>christian</HI> name I take to be this. — All our College Exercises are given up, signed only, by US, with our SURNAME. — The Dean of the College, to whom, in right of his office, Prior's Verses were delivered, not knowing, or mistaking Prior's name, who was then a Freshman, marked them with A. instead of M. when he gave them in to the UNIVERSITY INSPECTORS for their appro∣bation: or, probably, he might have made so aukward an M. that THEY MISTOOK it for an A. — For the Verses themselves, I have not, as I before observed, the least doubt but they are HONEST MATT's: and hope you will restore them to him. — They bear INTERNAL evidence of their being written by one, though a Freshman, <HI>used</HI> to <HI>write Latin Verse</HI>; and to write it too, in a <HI>Great School</HI>, under a Great Master —as was Prior's—Dr. Bosby. There is a classical terseness on the diction; and ease, and harmony in the Numbers. And the distant imitation of Martial's admirable lines on the HAPPY MARRIED PAIR — or rather the ALLUSION to that excellent little piece (for it can hardly be called a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> IMITATION of it) shews the TASTE of a MASTER, a the YEARS of a BOY, and is not unworthy the NAME or the FAME of PRIOR.

From thence he removed to Pembroke H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, Cambridge, of which he became a scholar, and afterwards to Peter House, where he was chosen a fellow. At this place, as in the former, he was distinguished for his Latin and Eng∣lish poetry. He took the degree of Master of Arts; but being soon after ejected from his fellowship for denying the cove∣nant, during the time of the civil wars, he was reduced to great indigence. At length he took the resolution of going beyond sea, and changed his religion, but without obtaining any advantage from it, as in 1646 he was discovered at Paris in a miserable condition by Cowley, who recommended him to Queen Henrietta, and by her means he obtained letters of recommendation to several persons in Italy, whither he soon went. On his arrival at Rome he became secretary to a car∣dinal there, and in the end one of the canons or chaplains of the church of Loretto, where he died in 1650. Mr. Pope's character of him may be seen in the 26th Letter to Mr. Cromwell. R.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<Q>“Strenae Natalitiae Academiae Oxoniensis i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> celsissimum Principem. Oxonii, è Theatro Sheldoniano. ”An. Dom. 1688.</Q>
—The uncommon excellence of Edmund Smith's productions must ensure them a favourable reception; especially when it is considered that at the time of their com∣position he was only one remove from a school-boy. Had Dr. Johnson seen the first of these publications, he would not have been at a loss to determine, in the excellent life he has given the world of Smith, whether the latter was admitted in the university in the year 1689, as he would thence have been enabled to pronounce with certainty that he was in 1688 a Member of Christ Church. I take this to have been the year of Smith's admission; and that he was then just come off from West∣minster, in time to signalise his abilities by writing on the Birth of the Prince of Wales, when a FRESHMAN (according to the university phrase) and before he was appointed to a Stu∣dentship; for his name is subscribed to that Copy of Verses, with the addition of COMMONER. The great superiority of genius that is displayed in this first — School-boy's—produc∣tion of Smith, beyond what Addison has discovered in his first performance — the Pastoral on the Inauguration of King William and Queen Mary — sufficiently serves to account for Smith's being, as Dr. Johnson observes,
<Q>“one of the murmurers at fortune; and wondering, why he was suf∣fered to be poor, when Addison was caressed and pre∣”ferred.</Q>
Smith could not but be conscious of the greater degree of literary merit he himself possessed even in the very department to which Addison owed the earlier part of his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, THE WRITING OF LATIN VERSE; — and on com∣paring their juvenile performances, it is evident that Smith had reason enough for that consciousness.—Addison first re∣commended himself to notice by his dedication of the <HI>Masae Anglicanae</HI> to Lord Halifax, and by the poems of his own therein inserted. But what are HIS poems in comparison of SMITH'S? See the note in vol. IV. p. 62. K.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Joseph Trapp, born at Cherington in Gloucester∣shire, in 1669, was educated at Wadham College, where he took the degree of M. A. May 13, 1702. In 1708 he was chosen the first professor of poetry, soon after the foundation of that professorship by Dr. Birkhead, and published his lec∣tures under the title of "Praelectiones Poeticae;" the first vo∣lume of which is dedicated to Mr. Secretary St. John; to whose father, in the early part of his life, he had been chap∣lain. His church preferments were, the rectory of Harlington in Middlesex, of Christ-church in Newgate-street, and St. Leonard, Fosterlane; with the Lectureships of St. Lawrence Jewry, and St. Martin in the Fields. He was created D. D. by diploma, Feb. 1, 1727; was long esteemed as an agreeable and pathetic preacher; and died Nov. 22, 1747. Four vo∣lumes of his Sermons are in print; as are his controversial treatises against the Papists and Methodists, which have much merit. He published a translation of Virgil, in blank verse, in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fferently executed; and another of "Paradise Lost" in Lati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, still worse. He was also the author of "Abramule," a tragedy, in 1704: and of several occasional Miscellanies. He was chaplain to the lord chancellor of Ireland in 1711; and pub∣lished in that year "A Character of the present Set of Whigs;" which Swift, who conveyed it to the printer, calls "a very s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urvy piece;" see the Journal to Stella, May 14, 1711. In a short time after, he printed at Dublin a poem on the duke of Ormond, which was re-printed at London, "and the printer sold just eleven of them:" see Journal, Aug. 24, 1711. Having mentioned to Stella, that Trapp and Sacheverell had been to visit him; Swift adds, "Trapp is a coxcomb, and the other is not very deep; and their judgement in things of wit and sense is miraculous."

<HEAD>TO LORD CARTERET<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Afterwards. Earl Granville. N.</NOTE>, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY: DR. GEORGE SEWELL <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, who was universally esteemed for his amiable disposition, is better known as an elegant writer and an excellent poet than in his own profession. He was born at Windsor, where his father was treasurer and chapter-clerk of the college. He received his education at Eton-school, and at Peter-house, Cambridge; where having taken the de∣gree of B. M. he went to Leyden, to study under Boerhaave, and on his return practised physic in the metropolis with re∣putation. In the latter part of life he retired to Hampstead, where he pursued his profession with some degree of success untill three other physicians came to settle at the same place, when his practice so far declined as to yield him very little advantage. He kept no house, but was a boarder. He was much esteemed, and so frequently invited to the tables of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, that he had seldom occa∣sion to dine at home. He died the 8th of February, 1726; and was supposed to be very indigent at the time of his death, as he was interred on the 12th of the same month in the meanest manner, his coffin being little better than those al∣lotted by the parish to the poor who are buried from the workhouse; neither did a single friend or relation attend him to the grave. No memorial was placed over his remains: but they lie just under a hollow tree which formed a part of a hedge-row that was once the boundary of the church yard. Besides seven controversial pampblets, he wrote, 1.
<Q>“The Life of John Philips;”</Q>
2.
<Q>“A Vindication of the English Stage, exemplified in the Cato of Mr. Addison. 1716;”</Q>
3.
<Q>“Sir Walter Raleigh, a Tragedy, acted at Lincoln-Inn Fields. 1719,”</Q>
and part of another play intended to be called "Richard the First," the fragments of which were pub∣lished in 1728 with
<Q>“Two moral Essays on the Government of the Thoughts, and on Death,”</Q>
and a c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llection of

The follow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g single poems of his are enumerated by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Cibber (by both of whom those here selected are unnoticed): 1.
<Q>“On Conscience, Beauty, the Force of Music, Song of T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lus, &amp;c.”</Q>
dedicated to the duke of Newcastle. 2.
<Q>“To his Grace the Duke of Marlborough, on his going into Germany, 1712.”</Q>
3. "Upon his Majesty's Accession."
4.
<Q>“Verses to her Royal Highness the Princess, on the Death of the young Prince.”</Q>
5.
<Q>“A Description of the Field of Battle, after Caesar was Conqueror at Pharsalia, from the Seventh Book of Lucan.”</Q>
6.
<Q>“Walpole, or the Pa∣triot.”</Q>
7.
<Q>“Translations from Lucan, occasioned by the Tragedy of Cato.”</Q>
8.
<Q>“The Fifth Elegy of the First Book of Tibullus, translated, and addressed to Delia.”</Q>
9.
<Q>“An Apology for loving a Widow.”</Q>
10.
<Q>“The Fifth Psalm paraphrased.”</Q>
11.
<Q>“A Poetical Epistle, written from Hampstead, to Mr. Thornhill, upon Mr. Addison's Cato.”</Q>
12.
<Q>“An Epistle to Mr. Addison, on the Death of the Earl of Halifax.”</Q>
13.
<Q>“Cupid's Proclamation, or a Defence of Women; a Poem from Chaucer.”</Q>

<Q>“The Second Book of Quillet's Callipaedia.”</Q>
Dr. Sewell was an oc∣casional assistant to Harrison in the fifth volume of

<HEAD>A SPEECH TO WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. SEWELL OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF MR. ADDISON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of this sketch wanted no inclination, and was prompted by many reasons to pay his little tribute to the ashes of that excellent man; but seeing another poem on the same subject [by Mr. Tickell, probably,] he left it unfinished; and it now comes forth, rather as a testimony of his grati∣tude and esteem, than as a design equal to the merit of the deceased. The reader will see easily that the scheme is at least new to an English taste, and what a scope there was to have given it length, if not worth sufficient. The An∣cients delighted much in this solemn kind of poetry; and indeed if we speak with a true warmth of affection, it seems the most natural and best sort of Elegy. If the reader has a mind to see a noble specimen of this way of writing, let him read the great Dr. Bentley's "Allocutio ad Sepulchrum, on the Death of Prince George," which is by far the most excellent and finished piece of this sort that ever was pro∣duced.

<HEAD>TO HENRY WRIGHT, OF MOBBERLEY, ESQ. ON BUYING THE PICTURE OF F. MALEBRANCHE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN BYROM <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ingenious poet, a younger son of Mr. Edward By∣rom, of Kersall in Lancashire, was born in Manchester, 1601. He was educated, first in his native town, and after∣wards at Merchant Taylors school in London, whence he was admitted a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, under the famous Mr. Baker, July 6, 1708. He first distin∣guished himself in the world of letters in 1714 by the cele∣brated pastoral, "My time, O ye Muses, was happily spent," in the eighth volume of "The Spectator," and by two hu∣morous letters on dreams in that volume. In the same year 1714, being then B. A. and having by his genius and regularity attracted the particular notice of Dr. Bentley, he was elected fellow of his college. Not chusing to enter into orders, he vacated his fellowship in 1716, and went to Montpellier; where, applying himself closely to the study of physic, he acquired the appellation of Doctor. On his return to London, he became violently enamoured with a lady who was the second daughter of a rich uncle, which terminated in a match so disagreeable to their relations that they were reduced to great necessity. The Doctor, however, had re∣course to an invention he had made whilst at Cambridge, of a curious method of writing short-hand; and, by passing the winter season in London, and the summer at Manchester, ob∣tained from it a tolerable support for an increasing family. By the death of an elder brother the family estate devolved to him; and the business of short-hand being no longer necessary, he retired to a domestic life, and indulged himself in baga∣telles till his death, which happened at Manchester, in the seventy-second year of his age, Sept 26, 1763. Two volumes of his poetical productions were published at Manchester, in 1773, 8vo. By these he appears to have been a Behmenist. As it was his manner to commit his sentiments of every kind to verse; he is the author of many poems on subjects on which no one but himself would ever have invoked the Muses. His lighter verses he committed to the flames, and among them probably some of his best, if we may judge from this and his "Pastoral Ballad," compared with his
<Q>“two vo∣lumes.”</Q>
One of his Poetical Dissertations is made famous by Mr. Pegge's animadversions on it in the fifth volume of the "Archaeologia." N.</NOTE>, M. A. F. R. S. NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL, dear Mr. Wright, I must send you a line;</L>
<L>The purchase is made, Father Malebranche is mine.</L>
<L>The adventure is past, which I long'd to atchieve,</L>
<L>And I 'm so overjoy'd, you will hardly believe.</L>
<L><PB N="157" REF="162"/>If you will but have patience, I 'll tell you, dear friend,</L>
<L>The whole history out from beginning to end.</L>
<L>Excuse the long tale; I could talk, Mr. Wright,</L>
<L>About this same picture from morning till night.</L>
<L>The morning it lower'd like the morning in Cato,</L>
<L>And brought on, methought, as important a day too;</L>
<L>But about ten o' clock it began to be clear;</L>
<L>And the fate of our capital piece drawing near,</L>
<L>Having supp'd off to breakfast some common decoction,</L>
<L>Away trudges I in all haste to the auction;</L>
<L>Should have call'd upon you, but the weaver committee</L>
<L>Forbad me that pleasure; — the more was the pity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The clock struck eleven as I enter'd the room,</L>
<L>Where Rembrant and Guido stood waiting their doom,</L>
<L>With Holbein and Rubens, Van Dyck, Tintoret,</L>
<L>Jordano, Poussin, Carlo Dolci, et caet.</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="163"/>When at length in the corner perceiving the Pere,</L>
<L>Ha, quoth I to his face, my old friend, are you there?</L>
<L>And methought the face smil'd, just as tho' it would say,</L>
<L>What, you 're come, Mr. Byrom, to fetch me away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now before I had time to return it an answer,</L>
<L>Comes a short-hander by, Jemmy O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d was the man, sir,</L>
<L>So, Doctor, good morrow: so, Jemmy, bon jour:</L>
<L>Some rare pictures here;—so there are to be sure:</L>
<L>Shall we look at some of 'em? with all my heart, Jemmy;</L>
<L>So I walk'd up and down, and my old pupil wi' me.</L>
<L>Making still such remarks as our wisdoms thought proper,</L>
<L>Where things were hit off in wood, canvas, or copper.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When at length about noon Mr. Auctioneer Cox,</L>
<L>With his book and his hammer, mounts into his box;</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="164"/>Lot the first—number one—then advanc'd his upholder</L>
<L>With Malebranche: so Atlas bore Heaven on his shoulder.</L>
<L>Then my heart, sir, it went pit-a-pat, in good sooth,</L>
<L>To see the sweet face of the searcher of truth:</L>
<L>Ha. thought I to myself, if it cost me a million,</L>
<L>This right honest head then shall grace my pavillion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus stood lot the first both in number and worth,</L>
<L>If pictures were priz'd for the men they set forth:</L>
<L>I 'm sure to my thinking, compar'd to this number</L>
<L>Most lots in the room seem'd to be but meer lumber,</L>
<L>The head then appearing, Cox left us to see 't,</L>
<L>And fell to discoursing concerning the feet,</L>
<L>"So long, and so broad—'tis a very fine head—</L>
<L>Please to enter it, gentlemen"—was all that he said.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Had I been in his place, not a stroke of an hammer</L>
<L>Till the force had been tried both of rhetorick and grammar;</L>
<L>"A very fine head!" — had thy head been as fine,</L>
<L>All the heads in the house had veil'd bonnets to thine:</L>
<L>Not a word whose it was—but in short 'twas an head—</L>
<L>"Put it up what you please"—and so somebody said,</L>
<L>Half a piece—and so on—for three pounds and a crown,</L>
<L>To sum up my good fortune, I fetch'd him me down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There were three or four bidders, I cannot tell whe∣ther,</L>
<L>But they never could come two upon me together;</L>
<L>For as soon as one spoke, then immediately pop</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advanc'd something more, fear the hammer should drop.</L>
<L><PB N="160" REF="165"/>I consider'd, should Cox take a whim of a sudden,</L>
<L>What a hurry it would put a man's Lancashire blood in▪</L>
<L>Once—twice—three pound five—so, Nemine con.</L>
<L>Came an absolute rap—and thrice happy was John.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Who bought it?" quoth Cox. "Here's the money," quoth I.</L>
<L>Still willing to make the securest reply:</L>
<L>And the safest receipt that a body can trust</L>
<L>For preventing disputes is—down with your dust!</L>
<L>So I bought it, and paid for't, and boldly I say,</L>
<L>'Twas the best purchase made at Cadogan's that day;</L>
<L>The works the man wrote are the finest in nature,</L>
<L>And a most clever piece is his genuine portraiture.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For the rest of the pictures, and how they were sold,</L>
<L>To others there present, I leave to be told:</L>
<L>They seem'd to go off, as at most other sales,</L>
<L>Just as folks' money, judgment, or fancy prevails;</L>
<L>Some cheap, and some dear; such an image as this</L>
<L>Comes a trifle to me: and an odd wooden Swiss</L>
<L>Wench's head, God knows who—forty-eight guineas — if her</L>
<L>Grace of Marlborough likes it—so fancy will differ.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the business was over, and the crowd somewhat gone,</L>
<L>Whip into a coach I convey number one.</L>
<L>Drive along, honest friend, fast as e'er you can pin;</L>
<L>So he did, and 'tis now safe and sound at Grays'-Inn:</L>
<L>Done at Paris, it says, from the life by one Gery,</L>
<L>Who that was I can't tell, but I wish his heart merry;</L>
<L>In the year ninety-eight; sixty just from the birth</L>
<L>Of the greatest divine, that e'er liv'd upon earth.</L>

<L>And now, if some evening, when you are at leisure,</L>

<L>Let us mix metaphysicks and short-hand and port,</L>
<L>We 'll talk of his book, or what else you 've a mind,</L>
<L>Take a glass, read or write, as we see we 're inclin'd:</L>

I since find that he lived some time at Hackney in rather distressed circumstances; but was no re∣lation to the Newcomes that keep the famous school there. Dr. Young was his friend. Besides the several poems I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere preserved, the long poem on the Last Judgement, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose I have before pointed out, he wrote, 1.
<Q>“The Manners of the Times, in seven Satires,”</Q>
after Dr. Young had published his Satires; 2. "An Ode to the Queen, on the happy Accession of their Majesties, to the Crown, 1727:" 3. "An Ode to the Right Honourable the Earl of Orford, on Retirement, 1742;" 4. "A Collection of Odes and Epigrams, &amp;c. occasioned by the Success of the British and Consederate Arms in Germany, 1743;" 5. "An Ode inscribed to the Memory of the late Earl of Orford, 1747;" 6. "Two Odes to his Royal Highness the Duke of Cum∣berland; on his Return from Scotland, and on his Voy∣age to Holland, 1746;" 7. "A Paraphrase on some Select Psalms;" 8. "The Consummation, a Sacred Ode on the fi∣nal Dissolution of the World, inscribed to his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, 1752;" 4to. 9.

"The Retired Penitent. Being a poetical Version of one of the Rev. Dr. Young's moral Contempla∣tions.

<Q>“Versions of two of Hervey's Meditations”</Q>

I have also reason to think that he was the author of "A Supplement to a late excellent Poem, intituled, <HI>Are these Things so?</HI> 1740;" and of "Praeexistence and Transmigration; or the new Metamorphosis, a Philosophical Essay on the Na∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re and Progress of the Soul; a Poem, something between a Panegyric and a Satire, 1743."

<L>Your glory like the sun's—whose sudden ray</L>

<L>Whose titles by each other still surpass'd,</L>

<HEAD>A POEM, SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF EDMUND SHEFFIELD, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, DUKE AND MARQUIS OF NORMANBY, EARL OF MULGRAVE, AND BARON OF BUTTERWICK.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN BOYLE <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John Boyle, earl of Corke and Orrery, was the only son of Charles the fourth earl of Orrery, of whom an account has already been given, vol. IV. p. 70. He was born the second of January, 1706-7, and was early put under the tuition of Mr. Fenton the poet, who instructed him from the age of seven to thirteen years. After passing through West∣minster School, he was admitted as a nobleman of Christ Church, Oxford, and soon distinguished himself by his poe∣tical abilities. In 1732 he took his seat in the House of Lords, and generally voted against the ministry in the great national questions which were at that period agitating; but, not relishing the bustle of a public life, he soon retreated from the busy world to the enjoyment of his friends, and the cul∣tivation of letters. In this state he produced many agreeable and entertaining performances both in prose and verse, which will ever reflect credit on his abilities as a writer. He was twice married, and left children by each wife. On the third of December, 1753, he succeeded to the title of Corke, and died November 16, 1762, aged fifty-six years. His character, by Mr. Duncombe, is inserted in the Biographia Britannica. R.</NOTE>, EARL OF ORRERY.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A HASTY PROLOGUE TO ALL FOR LOVE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am indebted for this <HI>unique</HI> of bishop Hoadly's compo∣sition to Mr. Duncombe's elegant publication of
<Q>“Letters by several eminent Persons.”</Q>
Both the poem and its history were communicated to Mr. Duncombe by the late Mr. Chan∣cellor Hoadly, the Bishop's youngest son. N.</NOTE>, ACTED AT BLENHEIM-HOUSE IN THE SUMMER 1718<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the summer of the year 1718, the bishop of Bangor, with Dr. Samuel Clarke, and Sir Richard Steele, made a visit of some days at Blenheim-house, by invitation, where he found that the ladies and gentlemen of the family, and a few of the neighbourhood, had got up the tragedy of
<Q>“All for Love,”</Q>
to entertain the duke of Marlborough, who had shewn, before this, some symptoms of that paralytic disorder which impaired his senses, and at length terminated in a total decay, and his dissolution. Lady Bateman (one of his grace's grand-daughters by the earl of Sunderland), who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>layed the part of Cleopatra, had in vain applied to Sir Richard Steele for a prologue on that extraordinary occasion, and seemed chagrined at the disappointment. At night, when the family retired, the bishop desired pen, ink, and paper, might be brought to his chamber, and, the next morn∣ing, at breakfast, presented to lady Bateman this prologue; which she spoke, the same evening, to the duke and dutchess, his grace shedding tears at the unexpected compliment from a favourite grand-child. In the course of the play, Sir Rich∣ard, who sat next to the bishop, often observed how well and feelingly captain Fishe performed the part of Anthony. This gentleman, who had been the duke's page, had distinguished himself in the army, and, as I have been informed, died a lieutenant-colonel. In one of the scenes where Fishe was very sweet upon his Cleopatra, Sir Richard whispered the bishop, "I doubt this <HI>Fishe</HI> is <HI>Flesh</HI>, my lord."—I must men∣tion another incident: at their going away, Sir Richard said to the bishop,
<Q>“Does your lordship give money to all these fellows in laced coats and ruffles?”</Q>
"No doubt," replied the bishop. "I have not enough," said the knight; and when he passed by them in the hall, he accosted them in a speech, telling them,
<Q>“that he had found them <HI>men of taste</HI>, and as such invited them all to Drury-lane theatre, to whatever play they should please to bespeak,”</Q>
he then having a share in the patent. D.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<Q>“The long re∣tardation of the Life of the duke of Marlborough shews, with strong conviction, how little confidence can be placed in posthumous renown. When he died, it was soon determi∣ned that his story should be delivered to posterity; and the papers supposed to contain the necessary information were delivered to lord Molesworth, who had been his favourite in Flanders. When Molesworth died, the same papers were transferred, with the same design, to Sir Richard Steele, who in some of his exigencies put them in pawn. They then remained with the old dutchess, who in her will assigned the task to Glover and Mallet, with a reward of a thousand ponnds, and a prohibition to insert any verses. Glover rejected, I suppose, with disdain the legacy, and devolved the whole work upon Mallet; who had from the late duke of Marlborough a pension to promote his in∣dustry, and who talked of the discoveries which he made; but left not, when he died, any historical labours behind him.”</Q>

<BYLINE>BY ROBERT LLOYD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. Pierson Lloyd, second master of Westminster school, where, and at Trinity college, Cambridge, he distin∣guished himself by his poetical genuis, and also (sorry I am to add) by his irregularities. To the former we are indebted for his "Actor," and several other ingenious pieces. To the latter he owed his imprisonment in the Fleet, and in some measure his immature death there, Dec. 15, 1764, though that was accelerated by the pang he felt for the loss of his friend Churchill, whose generosity he had so often experien∣ced. D.—H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s character has been thus excellently pourtrayed by Mr. Wilkes:
<Q>“He was mild and affable in private life, of gentle manners, and very engaging in conversation. He was an excellent scholar, and an easy, natural poet. His peculiar excellence was the dressing up an old thought in a new, neat, and trim manner. He was contented to scamper round the foot of Parnassus on his little Welch poney, which seems never to have tired. He left the fury of the winged steed, and the daring heights of the mountain, to the sublime genius of his friend Churchill.”</Q>

<BYLINE>BY MR. (AFTERWARDS DR.) DODD <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This unfortunate author, eldest son of the Rev. W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Dodd, M.A. many years vicar of Bourne in Lincolnshire, was born May 29, 1729. He was sent, at the age of 16, to the university of Cambridge, and admitted in the year 1745 a szar of Clare-Hall. In 1749-50 he took the degree of B. A. with great honour, being upon that occasion placed in the list of wranglers. Leaving the university, he imprudently married a miss Mary Perkins, of Frith-street, Soho, in 1751; was or∣dained a deacon the same year, and a priest in 1753, and soon became a popular preacher. His first preferment was the lectureship of West-Ham in 1752. In 1753 he was chosen lecturer of St. James's Garlickhithe, which he resigned in 1754 for that of St. Olave's Hart-street, and in 1758 took the degree of M. A. at Cambridge. On the foundation of the Magdalen Hospital in 1758, he was a strenuous supporter of that charity, and soon after became preacher at the chapel of it. By the favour of bishop Squire, to whom he was chap∣lain, he in 1763 obtained a prebend of Brecon, and by the same interest had the education of Mr. Stanhope, now earl of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sterfield, entrusted to his care. In 1765, by the interest of some city friends, he was appointed one of the king's chap∣lains. In 1766 he went to Cambridge, and took the degree of LL. D. Two new polite chapels were now the scenes of his ministry, and he obtained the rectory of Hockcliffe in Bed∣fordshire by purchase. At this period the estimation he was held in by the world was sufficient to give him expectations of preferment, and hopes of riches and honours; and these he might probably have acquired, had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e possessed a common por∣tion of prudence and discretion. On the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving of St. George Hanover-square becoming vacant in 1774, he wrote an ano∣nymous letter to the lord chancellor's lady, offering 3000 guineas if by her assistance he was promoted to it. This being traced to him, complaint was immediately made to the king; and Dr. Dodd was dismissed with disgrace from his post of chaplain. From this period, though he obtained the vicarage of Winge in Bucks from his noble pupil, he lived neglected, if not despised; and his extravagance still continuing, he be∣came involved in difficulties, which tempted him to for, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Feb. 4, 1777, a bond from his late pupil lord Chesterfield for £.4200. which he actually received; but, being detected was tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and, in spite o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every application for mercy, received sentence of death; and was executed at Tyburn, June 27, 1777. He was a volu¦minous writer, and possessed, with little judgment and muc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vanity, considerable abilities: but the advantages of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were totally lost to him by habits of dissipation, which se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have affected both his life and writings.

<L>Excels whatever learning can acquire;</L>
<L>In poetry this observation 's true,</L>
<L>Without some genius fame will ne'er ensue:</L>
<L>Such for a while may climb against the hill,</L>

<L>Come then, my friends, who like with me to rove</L>
<L>The flowery mountain, and the laurel grove,</L>
<L>Where god Apollo guards the limpid fount,</L>
<L>And the glad Muses climb the vocal mount:</L>
<L>You whom the voice invites to taste their charms,</L>

<L>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore you press the Sirens to your heart,</L>
<L>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end a while the precepts I impart.</L>
<L>First let your judgement for your fancy chuse</L>
<L>Of all the Nine the most unblemish'd Muse:</L>
<L>Soft yet sublime, in love yet strictly coy,</L>
<L>Prone to be grave, yet not averse to joy;</L>
<L>Where taste and candour, wit and manners meet,</L>
<L>Bold without bombast, daring but discreet;</L>
<L>Correct with spirit, musical with sense,</L>
<L>Not apt to give, nor slow to take offence;</L>
<L>First to commend when others thoughts are shown.</L>
<L>But always last delighted with her own.</L>
<L>When this is done, let Nature be your guide;</L>
<L>Rise in the spring, or in the river glide;</L>
<L>In every line consult her as you run,</L>
<L>And let her Naiads roll the river on:</L>
<L>Unless, to please our nice corrupted sense,</L>
<L>Art be call'd in, and join'd with vast expence;</L>
<L>Then rivers wander through the vale no more,</L>
<L>But boil in pipes, or spout through figur'd ore;</L>
<L>The neighbouring brooks their empty channel mourn,</L>
<L>That now enrich some artificial urn▪</L>
<L><PB N="270" REF="275"/>Thus ever suit your numbers to your theme,</L>
<L>And tune their cadence to the falling stream;</L>
<L>Or should the falling stream incline to love,</L>
<L>Let the words slide, and like its murmurs move:</L>
<L>Poor were the praise to paint a purling rill,</L>
<L>To make it music is the Muse's skill;</L>
<L>Without her voice the spring runs silent by,</L>
<L>Dumb are the waters, and the verses dry;</L>
<L>While chill'd with ice the cool waves creep along,</L>
<L>And all the fountain freezes in the song.</L>
<L>But if a storm must rattle through the strain,</L>
<L>Then let your lines grow black with gathering rain;</L>
<L>Through Jove's aërial hall loud thunders sound,</L>
<L>And the big bolt roars through the dark profound:</L>
<L>But should the welkin brighten to the view,</L>
<L>The sun breaks out, and gilds the style anew;</L>
<L>Colour your clouds with a vermilion dye,</L>
<L>And let warm blushes streak the western sky;</L>
<L>Till evening shuts in sober suited gray,</L>
<L>And draws her dappled curtains o'er the day.</L>
<L>Let Vesper then pursue the purple light,</L>
<L>And lead the twinkling glories of the night;</L>
<L>The moon must rise in silver o'er the shades,</L>
<L>Stream through your pen, and glance along the meads:</L>
<L>While Zephyr softly whispers in the lines,</L>
<L>And pearly dew in bright description shines;</L>
<L>The little warblers to the trees repair,</L>
<L>Sing in their sleep, and dream away their care;</L>
<L>While closing flowrets nod their painted heads,</L>
<L>And fold themselves to rest upon their rosy beds.</L>
<L><PB N="271" REF="276"/>But if Aurora's fingers stain the lay,</L>
<L>Let fancy waken with the rising day;</L>
<L>Let Sol's fierce coursers whirl the fiery team,</L>

<L>Be sultry noon in brighter yellow drest,</L>
<L>And bend a rainbow on her burning breast;</L>
<L>Let the rich dyes in changing colours flow,</L>
<L>And lose themselves in one poetic glow.</L>
<L>So the fair Indian crown its gloss assumes,</L>
<L>Dispos'd in tufts of party-colour'd plumes;</L>
<L>The transient tincture drinks the neighbouring hue,</L>
<L>As if from each th' alternate colours grew,</L>
<L>Where every beauty 's by a former made,</L>
<L>And lends a lustre to the following shade.</L>
<L>Thus may a simile come in with grace,</L>
<L>And add new splendors to the showery piece;</L>
<L>Paint the proud arch so lively to the sight,</L>
<L>That every line reflects a watery light.</L>
<L>Hence to the garden should your fancy fly,</L>
<L>Let the tall tulip with your Iris vie;</L>

<HEAD>TO A YOUNG LADY, WITH FENTON'S <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With this amiable and elegant Poet, Mr. Harte had the happiness of being closely connected in Friendship. N.</NOTE> MISCELLANIES.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WALTER HARTE <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Son of the Rev. Walter Harte, who died at Kentbury in Bucks, Feb. 10, 1736, aged 85, and who had been fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bend of Wells, and canon of Bristol, but resigned at the Revolution. The son first distin∣guished himself by a volume of
<Q>“Poems on several Occasions, 1727,”</Q>
8vo. inscribed to the earl of Peterborough, and written before he was nineteen. These were followed by his "Essay on Reason, 1727," folio, a very fine poem, which was much laboured, and went through Mr. Pope's hands. In a letter to Mr. Pattison (printed in the Memoirs of that writer, prefixed to his Poems, 1728) Mr. Harte very frankly gives his sentiments on a projected new version of Ovid's Epistles, and says,
<Q>“I have studied his manner much, and have often endeavoured to make a sort of mixed writing from him and Statius.”</Q>
He took the degree of M. A. January 20, 1730; and published that year
<Q>“An Essay on Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, particularly the Dunciad,”</Q>
8vo. He published also two Sermons, one called
<Q>“The Union and Harmony of Reason, Morality, and Revealed Religion,”</Q>
preached at St. Mary's Oxford, Feb. 27, 1736-7, which went through at least five editions; the other, a Fast Sermon, preached at the same place, Jan. 9, 1739-40. He was afterwards vice-principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, a tutor of great repu∣tation there; and was much patronised by Mr. Pope and Mr. Lyttelton, who recommended him to Lord Chesterfield as a fit praece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor to his natural son Mr. Stanhope, with whom he travelled from 1746 till 1750. Mr. Harte is descri∣bed by the noble lord as "a man of consummate erudition;" b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was ill qualified to polish the manners of his pupil. He was awkward in his person and address, had an unhappy im∣pediment in his speech, and a total want of ear; yet he so well performed his office, that Lord Chesterfield rewarded him with a canonry of Windsor,
<Q>“procured with great diffi∣culty;”</Q>
a difficulty which certainly arose from his college connections; as St. Mary Hall, of which Dr. King was principal, was at that time noted for Jacobitism. The ma∣terials of his "History of Gustavus Adolphus, 1759," two volumes 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, are excellent; but he has marred his book by a strange affected style,
<Q>“full of Latinisms, Gallicisms, Germanicisms, and all <HI>isms</HI> but Anglicisms.”</Q>
He dedicated it to his patron, who says,
<Q>“I was forced to prune the luxu∣riant praises bestowed upon me, and yet have left enough to satisfy a reasonable man.”</Q>
The success of the history being unequal to his hopes, his health was sensibly affected by it. He published however an improved edition of it in 8vo. in 1763; but continued at Bath dejected and dispirited, between real and imaginary distempers, till in November 1766 he had a stroke of the palsy, which deprived him of the use of his right leg, affected his speech, and in some degree his head. In October 1768 he had entirely lost the use of his left side; and in that melancholy condition lived till 1773. He pub∣lished a treatise on Agriculture in 1764,
<Q>“in good and ele∣gant English, and scattered such grace upon his subject, that in prose he came very near Virgil's Georgics in verse.”</Q>
I wish I could have found room in this collection for his "Essay on Painting," his "Essay on Reason," or for his "Vision of Death," which appeared in
<Q>“The Amaranth, 1767,”</Q>
the "great poetical work" alluded to by Lord Chesterfield in his "Letters to his Son," Lett. 341, 377.
He knew many anecdotes of Pope, Swift, Pulteney, Chester∣field, Fenton, &amp;c. N.</NOTE>, M. A.</BYLINE>

<L>Within a charming spot of land,</L>
<L>Adorn'd by Nature's bounteous hand,</L>
<L>With every flower that 's fair and bright,</L>
<L>To please the sense, or charm the sight,</L>

<L>Supremely rear'd her stately crest:</L>
<L>One while her lovely self she view'd</L>
<L>And lost in admiration stood;—</L>
<L>Then, glancing quick her eyes aside,</L>
<L>She saw, with heart surcharg'd with pride.</L>
<L><PB N="337" REF="342"/>A numerous tribe of flowers in bloom;</L>
<L>She saw, and smelt their sweet perfume:—</L>
<L>This was a mortifying sight:—</L>

<L>"Than one in Nature's richest livery dight?</L>

<L>Which envy, hate, and spleen devour,</L>
<L>In basest terms of infamy.—</L>
<L>The modest Laurel saw with scorn</L>

<L>Admonishing and smiling.—</L>
<L>Phoebus at length, who heard the fray,</L>

<L>The black clouds wore a watery frown,</L>

I am however credibly informed that it is the production of Dr. Croxall.

N.</NOTE>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>N IMITATION OF SPENSER'S STYLE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. SAMUEL CROXALL <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Son of Samuel Croxall, rector of Hanworth in Middle∣sex, and Vicar of Walton upon Thames in Surrey; in the last of which places our author was born. He received his early education at Eton school, and from thence was admitted into St. John's College, Cambridge, after which he entered into holy orders. Having a strong attachment to the whig inte∣rest, he employed his pen in favour of that party during the latter end of queen Anne's reign. After he quitted the uni∣versity, he was instituted to the living of Hampton in Mid∣dlesex, and then to the united parishes of St. Mary, Somerset, and St. Mary, Mounthaw, in the city of London, both which he held to his death. He was also chancellor, pre∣bendary, canon residentiary, and portionist, of the church of Hereford; and in the year 1732 was made archdeacon of Sa∣lop, and chaplain in ordinary to the king. Dr. Croxall, who principally governed the church during the old age of the Bishop, pulled down an old stone building of which the Antiquary Society had made a print, and with the materials built part of a house for his brother Mr. Rodney Croxall. He obtained the living of Sellark, in Herefordshive, in February 1734; and died, at a very advanced age, Feb. 13, 1752. He was au∣thor of "The Fair Circassian, 1720," 4to; of which his first specimen is in the fourth volume of this collection, p. 120; and of many excellent poems, which I hope at some future period to find leisure to collect into a volume. He published a collection of
<Q>“Fables of Aesop and others, translated into English, 1722,”</Q>
12mo. and wrote all the dedications prefixed to the "Select Novels," printed for Watts, 1729. Dr. Croxall was also author of
<Q>“Scrip∣ture Politicks; being a View of the original Constitu∣tion, and subsequent Revolutions, in the Government, Religious and Civil, of that People, out of whom the Saviour of the World was to arise; as it is contained in the Bible, 1725”</Q>

He was educa∣ted at Shrewsbury, and in 1705 sent to Christ Church, Oxford, to study the law, which he practised on his settling in Lon∣don; but, coming early to an estate of about 800 l. a year, he exchanged the bar for more pleasurable pursuits. He w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from principle a strenuous Nonjuror; but soon relinquis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those opinions from conviction. In the latter end of King William's reign, he was made a commissioner of the customs, through the interest of the Duke of Somerset; and afterwards, by lord Godolphin, was appointed auditor of the imprest. He had an amour with Mrs. Oldfield, by whom he had a son of both his names, who married in 1739 Miss Pyne, a lady of fortune (who survived him till 1780), and died a captain in Harrison's regiment at the siege of Carthagena in 1741. The captain lest an only daughter, an accomplished young lady, who has been dead some years. Mr. Maynwaring took an ac∣tive part against Dr. Sacheverell; published some little tracts on that occasion; and was the author of several poetical and politi∣cal pieces, most of which are either inserted or specified in his "Life and Posthumous Works," published by Oldmixon (who had assisted considerably in "The Medley") in 1715. He died Nov. 13, 1712. Amongst other poetical productions of Mr. Maynwaring was a version of the first book of Homer's Iliad. "Pope" says Dr. Johnson," once intended to print

<HEAD>ON DR. YOUNG'S TRANSLATION OF PART OF JOB.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. COBDEN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edward Cobden, D. D. chaplain in ordinary to King George the Second, was early in life chaplain to Bp. Gibson, to whose patronage he was indebted for the following prefer∣ments; viz. the united rectories of St. Austin and St. Faith in London, with that of Acton in Middlesex, a prebend of St. Paul's, another at Lincoln, and the archdeaconry of Lon∣don, in which last he succeeded Dr. Tyrwhit in July 1742. He published a famous Sermon, preached before the King at St. James's, Dec. 11, 1748, intituled, "A Persuasive to Chastity." In an advertisement, the Doctor observes, "that, it having given occasion to some unjust censures, he thought it proper to publish it, hoping that nothing in the sentiment or expression will be found unworthy of the sacred function of a preacher of the Gospel, or of the serious attention of a Christian assembly." The last time he preached before the King was Dec. 8, 1751. He resigned his warrant for chaplain Nov. 23, 1752; after having delivered into his Majesty's hands his reasons in writing for so doing. In 1755 he published a pamphlet, intituled, "An Essay tending to promote Reli∣gion," 8vo. in the title-page of which he styles himself "late∣ly Chaplain above twenty-two years to his Majesty;" and in 1756 "A Poem sacred to the memory of Queen Anne, for her Bounty to the Clergy," 4to. His whole works were col∣lected by himself, in 1757, in two volumes, 4to. He died April 22, 1764, aged more than 80. N.</NOTE>,</BYLINE>

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Daughter of Sir Roger Manley, author of the first volume of "The Turkish Spy." She received an education suitable to her birth; and gave early discoveries of a genius superior to what is usually found among her sex. In her infancy she lost her mother; and early in life was cheated into marriage with a near relation, of her own name, who had at the same time a former wise living. Deserted by her husband, she wore away three wretched years in solitude till she by accident be∣came patronised by the dutchess of Cleveland, a mistress of Charles II; but the dutchess, being of a fickle temper, grew tired of Mrs. Manley in six months, and discharged her, on pretence that she intrigued with her son. Retiring again in∣to solitude, she wrote her first tragedy, "The Royal Mis∣chief." This play being acted at the Theatre Royal in 1696, with great success; she received such unbounded incense from the witty and the gay as in the end proved fatal to her virtue. In the same year, she also produced a comedy inti∣tuled, "The Lost Lover, or Jealous Husband," which was performed without any success. Her third Dramatic piece was "Almyna, or The Arabian Vow, a Tragedy, 1707." In her retired hours, she wrote her four volumes of the "Me∣moirs of the New Atalantis," in which she was not only very free with her own sex, in her wanton description of love-adventures, but also with the characters of many high and distinguished personages. Her father had always been attach∣ed to the cause of Charles I. and she herself had a confirmed aversion to the Whig ministry; so that the representations of many characters in her Atalantis are nothing but satires upon those who had brought about the Revolution. Upon this, a warrant was granted from the secretary of state's office, to seize the printer and publisher of those volumes. Mrs. Manley had too much generosity to let innocent persons suf∣fer on her account; and therefore voluntarily acknowledged herself the author of the work in question. When she was examined before lord Sunderland, who was then secretary, he was curious to know, from whom she got information of some particulars, which he imagined to be above her own intelligence. She replied, with great humility, that she had no design in writing, farther than her own amusement and diversion in the country, without intending particular reflec∣tions and characters, and did assure him, that nobody was concerned with her. When this was not believed, and the contrary urged against her by several circumstances, she said
<Q>“then it must be by inspiration, because knowing her own innocence she could account for it no other way.”</Q>
The secretary replied, that
<Q>“inspiration used to be upon a good account; but that her writings were stark-naught.”</Q>
She acknowledged
<Q>“that his lordship's observation might be true; but, as there were evil angels as well as good, what she had written might still be by inspiration.”</Q>
The conse∣quence of this examination was, that Mrs. Manley was close shut up in a messenger's house, without being allowed pen▪ ink, and paper. However, her council sued out her Habeas Corpus, and she was admitted to bail. Whether those in power were ashamed to bring a woman to trial for writing a few amorous trifles, or whether the laws could not reach her, she was discharged, after several times exposing herself in person to cross the court before the bench of judges, with her three attendants, the printer and two publishers. Not long after, a total change of the ministry ensued; she then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame into great favour with their successors, and was employed in defending the Four last Years of the Queen. The pam∣phlets which she wrote at this period are numerous, and some of them such as would not disgrace the best pen that ove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrote in the defence of government. After Dean Swift re∣linquished "The Examiner," she continued it with great spirit for a considerable time, and frequently finished pieces begun by that excellent writer, who also often used to furnish her with hints for those of her own composition. At this time, or soon afterwards, she became connected with Alderman Bar∣ber, who was then the favourite Tory printer, and with him she resided until the time of her death, which happened on the 11th of July 1724, at his house on Lambeth Hill. She was buried in the middle aisle of the church of St. Bennet, Paul's Wharf, where a marble grave stone was erected to her memory. A second edition of a volume of her Letters was published in 1713. "Lucius," a well-received tragedy, written by her, and acted in 1717, was dedicated to Sir Ri∣chard Steele, whom she had abused in her "Atalantis;" but who was then on such friendly terms with her, that he wrote the prologue to this play, as Mr. Prior did the epilogue. Mr. Steele's prologue is printed in this collection vol. IV. p. 19. Some account of her life has been published by herself, under the title of "Memoirs of Rivella." N.</NOTE>
