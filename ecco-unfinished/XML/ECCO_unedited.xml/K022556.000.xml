<P>HE who hopes to increase his reputa∣tion, (if he have any already) as a Writer, by sketching a mere vehicle for Sing-song, and Shew,—is a Block∣head. He who indites an elaborate Criticism, on such a vehicle,—is a Block∣head;—or, he is worse:—a malignant fellow, pretending to mistake a Dra∣matist's Jerkin, for his best 'Coat, that he may pick a hole in it.</P>
<P>Be it known to you, <HI>Messieurs!</HI> that this same scribbling <HI>in a jerkin,</HI>—but, by the way, it must not be ragged,—is best suited to some occasions; and not at all disrespectful to the Company.—To have aim'd at writing in <HI>full dress,</HI> in the pre∣sent instance, would have been a waste of wardrobe;—and, as idle, and ex∣travagant, as riding on horse-back, in Hyde Park, in a bag-wig and sword.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>The same motives which induced me to construct the Romance of <HI>Blue-Beard,</HI> and the uncommon favour it has ex∣perienced from the Town, tempted me to fabricate <HI>Feudal Times:</HI>—and my en∣deavours to amuse the good Holiday-folks, of London, and to serve the in∣terests of the Theatre, have again suc∣ceeded.</P>
<P>My Coadjutors, in this <HI>Spectacle,</HI> are the same as in <HI>Blue-Beard;</HI> and I have now, as full a tribute of praise, and thanks, to render to the Composer of the Musick, to the Machinist, and to the Scene-Painter, as I had to offer when they exerted their talents for me, last year.</P>
<P>To all the Performers, in the Piece, I make my best acknowledgments.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>In the Scene of the Banquet-Gallery, I owe something to a foreign Dramatist. If any one should have curiosity, or leisure enough, to inquire how much, or how little, I am obliged to him, let him peruse <HI>Tarare,</HI> written by <HI>Mons. Beaumarchais.</HI></P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I had almost overlook'd the Black-Letter Gentlemen; who may cavil at the term, <HI>Banquet-Gallery.</HI> I could defend it, stoutly, under the cir∣cumstances in which I have used it:— <HI>mais le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle.</HI> I leave the discussion to Antiquaries, and Nomenclators;—whose attention (with∣out
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
meaning the slightest offence to a learned, and indefatigable body of men) has often been sedulously em∣ployed upon a subject of as little im∣portance.</P>

the distresses of his people, 'tis meet we fight lusti∣ly in his cause. Poor fellows fight with double zeal for a man in command when his humanity goes hand in hand with his power.</P>

<P>Look yonder comes a boat from the Castle. We shall hear all, anon.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>A boat puts off from the Castle. All the men in the boat are dress'd in the Uniform of Baron Fitzallan. Andrew sits at the stern, with a trumpet, and a flag. The boat proceeds from the Castle, and at last reaches the shore of the Village. The boat and men appear small at first, and larger as they ap∣proach, to keep up the perspective. Musick from the boat, all the way—at first gentle, then increa∣sing, gradually, in force, as the distance is diminish∣ed.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER><HI>Andrew.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A true emblem; for it has put me clean out of breath:—and, War will, sometimes, so take away a man's breath that he can never af∣ter recover it.—Hem!—All ye Northern men, and Vassals of the good Baron Fitzallan! Re∣pair, straight, to the Castle of the Lake. There to take arms, in the cause of your Liege-Lord. Maintain his Honour—for his Honour maintains You. Support the just, oppose the wicked, thump his enemies, assert his rights, and revenge his wrongs. Huzza! Bless the Crier!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4<HI>th. Vil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We fight on the old ground, if I mistake not, Andrew? The ancient enmity 'twixt our Lord, here, and the Baron Ruthen∣wolf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Andrew.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Partly so.—'Tis a fresh sprout, from the old root.—'Tis wonderful to see how un∣neighbourly a neighbour can be in this world!— Truly, our Baron has good cause of complaint.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Old Man.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! the fair daughter of old Sir Philip Portingale?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Old Man.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Heaven bless him! He is the pride of his house, and the joy of all our village. I do think, truly, of all our Baron's goodly sons, young master Edmund is the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2<HI>d. Vil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But how, I prithee, Andrew, is Lady Claribel the cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Andrew.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that viperly Baron—Ruthen∣wolf—has carried her forcibly away, from her father's;—just as her marriage, with young Ed∣mund, was about to be solemnized.—Thus, Sir Philip has lost a daughter; the Lady has lost her lover; Edmund has lost a wife; the Parson his marriage fee; and you have lost an ox, roasted, with his horns on, and three hog sheads of old October.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Vil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We'll spill the last drop of our blood for the house of Fitzallan.</P>

<P>No.—I am his confidant, you know, as well as his butler: and, last night, as I drew a bottle of canary, for him from the cellar, when

<P>Ah, my Martin! You have a kindly soul!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rach.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, how to contrive this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thus—and you, perhaps, may help me in the contrivance.—Lord Ruthenwolf has lifted his prisoner from darkness to light; from the dungeon of horror, to the chamber of feast∣ing.—He thinks, now, this will best help forward his suit with her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rach.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come with me to my master's.—We will arrange matters with your father, here, as we pass.—and, I will, from his house, write a letter to my preserver, to repair secretly to Ru∣thenwolf Castle, as I shall direct him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rach.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But if this should fail, Martin—</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!—It shall go hard if, with our assistance, he do not soon rescue his love.— Away!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rach.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I would follow you, Martin, all over the word:—and now I have a double cause to
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
follow you.—We must be cautious, though, for your sake, in passing the village.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mar.</HI></SPEAKER>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE THE LAST.</HI> On the right of the Stage, is the exterior of Ruthen∣wolf Castle. The Chief Entrance is represented in a side view; consisting of a Gateway, between two Turrets;—the Bridge drawn up. The Cast∣le is partially moated;—the water losing itself un∣der a low arch, beneath the battlements, before it has completely encircled the building:—But the

Battlements are continued beyond the place where the moat is lost; and at the base of these is a Sally Port, close to the ground. Above them, a black round Tower.<LB/>From a window in the round Tower, and, also, from a window in one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the turrets, are flights of steps, which communicate with the ramparts.<LB/>On the left of the Stage, are high tufted Trees: At the back, Mountains, in perspective, and the Sun rising above them.<LB/>Fitzallan, Henry, and Orlando are drawn up on the left, with Soldiery and Cannon, &amp;c. &amp;c. Pio∣neers at work upon a Mine, at the mouth of the Sally Port; beneath the Round Tower. The moment the Scene is disclosed, a loud Shout, and a heavy can∣nonade, from Fitzallan's party;—with a shower of Arrows—which is return'd by Ruthenwolf's Soldiery, who are thickly placed on the Turrets.</HEAD>
