<HEAD>A
Friendly Epistle
By Way of
REPROOF
From one of the PEOPLE called
QUAKERS,
TO
Thomas Bradbury, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><HI>Friend</HI> Thomas Bradbury,</OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have deemed thee sundry
Times to be worthy of Re∣buke;
nevertheless I have for∣born
to speak unto thee pub∣lickly,
desiring rather that
thou shouldest Reform those Things where∣in
thou hast done foolishly. In Times past
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
thou wer't called a Preacher of Righteous∣ness,
and many of the People flocked unto
thee, being delighted with thy Words:
Howbeit, <HI>Thomas,</HI> thy deficiency was even
then known to many: But when the Wrath
of Men waxed hot against each other, and
the Love of Brethren began openly to de∣cay,
Friends hoped thou wouldest have
shewn thy self the true Disciple of him, who
left thee both his Pattern and Precept for
thy Guidance in the right Way, wherein
if thou had'st walk'd carefully, thou should'st
have obtain'd the Name, and perchance
the Blessing annexed in the Word, unto the
<HI>Peace-maker.</HI></P>
<P>But contrary-wise, thou hast taken part
with Evil-doers, and hast been busie in the
Antichristian ungodly Work of Strife:
Thou hast fallen upon the Innocent, with
Words of Bitterness, engendring Malice and
Envy, whereby thou hast been Occasi∣on
of much Evil-doing, and hast brought
forth Wrath among thy Brethren.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>Thomas,</HI> for in this thou hast done
foolishly, and forasmuch as thou oughtest
to be Rebuked, I shall speak plain Words
unto thee, wherewith thou shalt not be able
to contend, seeing Truth shall be contain∣ed
therein, and seeing thou hast grieved me
sorely in this that thou hast done; the Evi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whereof I am dubious whether thou under<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
standest it or not.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4"/>
There are, who sow Contention
among Brethren, but their End is Foolish∣ness.
I fear, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that thou hast been
of this Number; for I find among thy
publick Works, that thou hast preached,
That Men should take Arms, and fight a∣gainst
one another, because of Tyrants. It
seemeth that thou hadst not any just Rea∣son
to preach such Things among thy Peo∣ple;
forasmuch as the Queen, under whom
thou then livest, was not deemed worthy
of the Name of a Tyrant; neither do I un∣derstand,
that thou or thy People were any
way oppressed by Her, or that thou didst
alledge any act of Tyranny to be commit∣ted
by Her at that Time: But on the con∣trary,
Thou, and also thy People, were
at full Liberty, if so it had seemed good
unto thee to have lived under her <HI>peaceable
and quiet Lives in all Godliness and Hone∣sty.</HI>
So that, PLAINLY, <HI>Thomas,</HI> Thou
hadst no just Reason to proceed in this thy
Preaching, wherein thou excitest thy Hear∣ers
to make War, and givest occasion to
Men to speak hard Words of thee, as that
thou wast a Preacher of Sedition, an In∣cendiary,
and one that moved to Wrath
and to shedding of Blood. Nay, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
but these Things are not of good Report,
neither are they found to be agreeable to
the Character given in the Word, to such
as thou sayest thou art. Thou art Com∣manded
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
to be <HI>sober,</HI> and not a <HI>Brawler,</HI> as
thou plainly settest forth thyself to be.</P>
<P>I find likewise, that sithence thou could∣est
not bring thy purpose to pass in the
Days of the Reign of the said Queen, and
that rather by the shortness of the Conti∣nuance
of that Ruler, thou could'st not
prevail to cause the People to fight, and to
shed Blood, thou hast continued thy evil
Design in the Days of the King, and bear∣est
thy Testimony loudly for shedding of
Blood, by the way which thou callest
Justice, pointing out unto the Rulers of the
People such Persons as thou bearest an
evil Mind towards, without Cause; and
it seemeth, that not in thy <HI>Preaching-Bench</HI>
only, but in thy Communication with angry
Men, thou art found animating them un∣to
Wrath, and unto that Wickedness which
is forbidden by the Lord; and which, al∣beit
that thou thinkest meet to call Justice,
Men think otherwise thereof, and that it
deserveth no other Name than that of <HI>Re∣venge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas,
Thomas,</HI> I warn thee, deal no
more in these Things; there is, to whom
Vengeance belongeth, and who hath for∣bidden
thee and me to intermeddle there∣with.
Moreover, I Counsel thee to advise
with the Writers of ancient Times, where∣in
thou may'st learn, that Execution of Justice
is the most difficult Thing in which the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
Sons of Men are at all Concerned, and that
Men are not able at all Times to know
what is Justice, or how the same should
be distributed unto each other, forasmuch
as that often seemeth to be just in the Eyes
of Men, which is Oppression and Injurious
in the Sight of God. And thou well know∣est,
that such is the Iniquity of the Days
wherein we live, that oftentimes, what is
called Justice in one Day, is called Tyran∣ny
and Oppression in another Day; and
Men, <HI>especially, Thomas, Preaching-Men,
as thou art,</HI> ought much rather to
move their People and their Brethren to
forbear and forgive one another, than to
move and excite them to Severities, and to
executing Revenge upon one another, least
the Day come, when that which they call
Justice, may be doomed Injustice, as I told
thee but now.</P>
<P>Thou art not ignorant, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that
many Years agone, on the Thirtieth Day
of the First Month, the same in which I
write unto thee, some of thy People, <HI>Preach∣ers
as thou art,</HI> used the same Speech, and
excited the People of this Land to Blood,
even to Murther, and that of their Right∣ful
Ruler and KING; and thou art not
Ignorant, that in doing thereof, they made
use of the same Words which thou lettest
fall lately in one of thy Tavern Assemblies,
wherein thou art too frequent; <HI>to wit,</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
doing JUSTICE: I have heard, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
and I suppose that thou thyself hast heard
also, that many Preachers in those Days,
excited the People to cry in a Tumultuous
and unseemly manner, for <HI>Justice, Justice;</HI>
the same Voice which is heard from thee
at this Time; And how knowest thou, O
Man, that the Voices which only call for
<HI>Justice</HI> at this time, may not encourage
those to whom they cry, to do what is not
Just, and to shed Innocent Blood, as it was
in that Day? Verily, <HI>Thomas,</HI> I fear thou
knowest not what thou art employld about;
when ungodly Men, and Men of no Prin∣ciples,
<HI>for such are among the People,</HI> take
upon themselves the Executing their own
Revenge, under the specious assumed Co∣lour
of doing Justice upon Offenders; <HI>know∣est
thou</HI> where such Men will stop? And
having Power to interpret Laws, or strain
and extend the Ordinances of the Land to
their own Purposes, knowest thou what
they will call Law! And what Justice!
What Right, and what Wrong? Knowest
thou not, that <HI>the Wrath of Men worketh
not the Righteousness of God;</HI> and that
these Things tend unto Blood, forasmuch
as ye <HI>know not what Spirit ye are of?</HI> These
Things are well worthy of thy Considera∣tion,
and that before it be too late; for
Rashness and Zeal without Knowledge, are
not in Matters of Blood, as they are in o∣ther
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
Things: They cannot retrieve by Re∣pentance,
the Mischief which they being
to pass in the Land, neither can they make
Reparation for Blood, when it is like Water
<HI>spilt upon the Ground, and cannot be gather∣ed
up.</HI> I Counsel thee therefore, that thou
forbear to excite thy Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> to do
wickedly; but rather that thou preach to
them that they REPENT, <HI>for the King∣dom
of Heaven is at Hand;</HI> which I meekly
advertise thee is the proper Duty of thy Em∣ployment,
whereas the other is the Work
of Darkness, and tendeth to Blood.</P>
<P>Thou wilt, <HI>or it's much,</HI> be provoked to
Anger at my Words, and say, I am plead∣ing
for <HI>Baal;</HI> but thy own Ways shall re∣prove
thee herein; for <HI>know, O Man,</HI> that
I am of those Friends, who rejoice, in that
it hath pleased the <HI>King</HI> to take unto him
wise Counsellors, and hath not put his
Trust in those who have deceived the Peo∣ple;
likewise I desire, that the Evil Pro∣ceedings
which endanger'd the King's Pos∣sessing
the Crown, may be discover'd; and
if it shall appear to the King, that any of
the King's Worthies have laid a Confedera∣cy,
and have shaken Hands with <HI>the Stran∣ger,</HI>
that those their Evil Doings may be
punish'd, therefore, forasmuch as <HI>this is an
Iniquity to be punish'd by the Judge:</HI> And
moreover, because those Men had affirm∣ed
before the whole Congregation, and
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
lifted up their Hands to the Lord, that they
did freely and heartily Renounce the said
<HI>Stranger,</HI> &amp;c. and having therefore Lyed
unto the Lord, they ought to be expelled
the Society of the Faithful: But alass!
<HI>Thomas,</HI> this will not serve thy Turn, nor
satisfie the Thirst after Blood, which the
People whom thou hast enflamed are di∣stemper'd
with; for ye are seeking after
Evil Things, and striving to involve the In∣nocent
in the Errors of the Guilty, that
you may entitle them also unto like Punish∣ment.</P>
<P>Likewise
it seemeth to me, that thou and
many of thy People are Deceivers of your
selves, in the Things wherein thou thus
boldly intermedlest, and that the Thirst
after Blood will appear the more hainous in
thee and them; for that passing by the
more open and flagitious Crime of shaking
Hands with the <HI>Stranger,</HI> and setting him,
<HI>whom the Lord hath rejected,</HI> upon the
Throne of the King, which I have told
thee, deserves, that those who are guilty
thereof, should <HI>dye the Death.</HI> I say, setting
this aside, as a thing whereof thou seemest
to doubt, that thou shalt not bring Witnesses
to prove them guilty; it seemeth that thou
wouldest with Earnestness prevail upon
thy People to call that Treason, whereof the
People of the Land Rejoice and are exceed∣ing
glad; <HI>to wit,</HI> that an End is put to that
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
evil Thing call'd War, and that the Nations
of the Earth, and the Princes thereof, have
joyn'd to make Peace. Whatever the migh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Men of Valour who drew Sword (and of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom their Enemies say, that they delighted
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Blood,) may say of this Thing, yet sure∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
thou who art a Preacher shouldst not be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrowful that the Nations are in Peace,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch less should'st thou joyn with those,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, That this Peace is not of the Lord;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> oughtest to know, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace could not have been obtain'd, if the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd had not inclin'd the Heart of the Queen
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make it, to whom he had, from Heaven,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven the only lawful Power to do it; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, who has the Hearts of Kings in his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nds, so powerfully inclin'd the Heart of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Queen, as I have lately heard he did,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en so much that Sleep went from her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, as once from <HI>Ahasuerus the King, for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Salvation of the Lord's People of that Day;</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that she could have no rest Night or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, till she put an end to the Day of Blood
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Desolation, which then overspread the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. If this be a Truth, <HI>Thomas,</HI> and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Work was of God, I counsel thee to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alone, lest haply thou be'st found to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against God.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>beit the Conditions whereon this Peace
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain'd please thee not, yet if it pleas'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, that this Peace, and on these
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itions, should be made, Wilt thou shut
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
thine Eyes and stop thine Ears against th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Voice of supernatural Power, and fallin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on the Instruments only▪ deny thereby th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Instrumentality of Providence, in a Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of such a mighty Nature? I advise thee <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>beware</HI> how thou behave in this Point, lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
it bring Shame to thee and to thy Friends<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
when peradventure ye shall fail also in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Evil ye have invented against innocent Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sons,
and the injur'd Men shall cry un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the Lord against the Oppression, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
have design'd for them to ruin and oppre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
them, and he shall hear and save them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of your Hands; for be it known unto the
<HI>Thomas,</HI> that all those who have been, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
still are, Friends to the Peace, are not wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
Persons as thou speakest, neither ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
they betrayed the Land and the King; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
there are among us, who believe that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Peace was of the Lord, and that the Inst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments,
whether those who had Evil <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

whether to the Good or to the Hurt of

<P><HI>Beware then,</HI> that thou and the Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Spirits thou hast moved to avenge th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Servants had lawful Right to perform,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therein to obey her Voice.</P>
<P>I refrain from Words with thee, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ncerning Things wherein we differ, <HI>to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the Unlawfulness of War in all Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects,
of which I see, thou, who art a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong
the Men of Blood in high Esteem,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ouldest be vain in contending with me;
out thou mayst contend in this with me,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou thinkest it meet; that whether it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lawful to make Peace or not, was not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uestion'd since the World began; no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore canst thou question whether by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aws of the People, the Queen had not a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>egal Power to make Peace, without ask∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g
the Consent of any of the People of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and.</P>
<P>Likewise, it will admit very little Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oversy,
albeit thou wilt endeavour to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vert
it with me, whether the Queen
having such an unquestion'd Right of ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
Peace, any of her Servants can be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unished for their obeying the Voice of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Queen therein.</P>
<P>These Things thou art at Liberty, <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
to answer, if thou likest thereof, and
to publish thy Answers in the Ears of the
People; but <HI>beware</HI> thou deludest not the
People with false Interpretations, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thou slanderest none, neither takest upon
thee Satan's. Ways, <HI>to wit,</HI> of bringing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>railing Accusation</HI> against thy Brethren, lest
<HI>the Lord rebuke thee.</HI></P>
<P>Having spoken these Things to thee in
Meekness and Soberness, as well, <HI>and even
much more</HI> for the Reproof of the Children
of thy People, than thy own; I must ad∣monish
thee, <HI>Thomas,</HI> of thy Duty, wherein
thou hast been deficient, and warn thee to
be more faithful in the Discharge thereof▪
forasmuch as that the Iniquities of the Time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
call loudly upon thee, and upon all who
fear the Lord, and are mov'd by the Spirit
of Truth to bear Testimony against them▪
and <HI>shew the House of Jacob their Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Thou hast assumed the Place of a publick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Reprover of some, as well as thou wast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
also a publick Instructor of others; and
particularly, <HI>Thomas,</HI> Thou hast been loud<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and overmuch busy in thy Exclamations
against the Men of the Time who are now
displac'd, and not only didst reprove their
Offences, but as Men say, search'd for Of∣fences
in their Behaviour, even where they
could not be found: But it seemeth that
thou thinkest, or wouldest that we should
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
think, that the Men of these Times, who
are Exalted by the King, in the Room of
those who have been Debased, are Men
Blameless, and deserving no Rebuke; whe∣ther
it be so in Truth, Yea, or Nay, thou
and I must Commune a little. Verily, <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI>
it appeareth unto me, That the Ini∣quity
of the People aboundeth, even of their
Rulers, in a much greater Manner, than it
did in the Days wherein thou wer't ag∣grieved
thereat; and therefore, I must en∣quire
of thee, How it cometh to pass, That
thou, <HI>Watchman,</HI> art silent, in the Day, when
the Cry of our National Offences, like the
Sin of <HI>Sodom,</HI> reacheth up to Heaven? Is
it that thy Partiality is so great, as that it
causeth thee to shut thy Eyes; and that
being blinded by thy Respect of Persons,
thou seest not the Flood of Wickedness
which is breaking in upon the Land of thy
Nativity? Or, Art thou afraid to discharge
thy Duty, and speak plainly to Great Men?
There was an <HI>Elijah,</HI> who durst say, even
to the King, <HI>Thou art he that troubleth Isra∣el.</HI>
There was a <HI>Nathan,</HI> who durst say,
even to the King, <HI>Thou art the Man:</HI> But,
Thou, O Man, art silent, tho' the Persons
concern'd are Meaner than the King.</P>
<P>What thinkest thou, <HI>Thomas,</HI> of the Pie∣ty,
the Religion, the Godliness of the Men
in Power? Are they, who are made under
the King, Rulers of the People; Are they,
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
<HI>I say,</HI> Men fearing God, and <HI>hating Cove∣tousness?</HI>
Are they such as <HI>seek the Prosperi∣ty
of Zion,</HI> and that <HI>stand in the Gap,</HI> when
the Judgments of God threaten the Land
for the Sin of the Inhabitants? Search thou
the Characters of these Men; and if thou
darest to be Honest, speak from thy Con∣science
in their behalf; for as God himself
will not be mock'd, neither is this the
Time for thee to Mock thy Brethren.</P>
<P>It was told me, <HI>Thomas,</HI> That in one of
thy late Preachings, thou did'st, indeed, move
the Rulers of the Land to choose Magi∣strates,
such as were <HI>Men fearing God;</HI> but
that thou did'st omit, that other Qualifica∣tion
mention'd in the Words, from whence
that same Expression is quoted; <HI>to wit,
hating Covetousness.</HI> They Report of thee,
That either thou wert forgetful of the
Text, or that something much worse than
forgetfulness, was the occasion of the O∣mission
thereof; and those, who say these
Things, Report thee to be a <HI>Time-server,</HI>
and Partial to thy Friends. But I will Ad∣monish
thee to beware of giving just Occa∣sion
to Evil Men, to think thee worthy of
Blame; and if thou art dispos'd to accept
of thy Friend's Counsel, I will advise thee,
how thou shalt deliver thy self from all
that Reproach, which Evil Tongues shall
devise against thee, concerning this Thing;
and my Advice to thee is, that according to
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
thy Duty, Thou now <HI>lift up thy Voice like a
Trumpet;</HI> that thou Cry aloud, <HI>and spare
not;</HI> spare not thy self, and spare not thy
wicked Friends; but fearing not their
Wrath, any more than thou didst the
Wrath of the Queen, whom thou unjustly
misus'd; speak plainly to them, and tell
them their Sin and their Duty; how far
they are contributing to the Ruin of the
Land of their Nativity, and how far it is
their Duty, not only to Reform themselves,
but likewise to Discourage and Chastise the
Wickedness of the People.</P>
<P><HI>Verily, Thomas,</HI> I am sorely grieved at
thee, to think how thou can'st keep Silent;
seest thou not the Elders of thy People, and
the Princes, the Heads of Tribes, the Cap∣tains
of Thousands; the wise Men, and the
Counsellors, following after Vanity? What
mean the Bleating of these kind of Cattle?
The Priests of <HI>Baal</HI> will upbraid thee, and
upbraid thy Friends with Hypocrisie; see∣ing
that they are stept up into Power, and
are regardless of the Morrals of the Peo∣ple;
and not only so, but it seemeth unto
us, that even these assist to Debauch the
People by their Example.</P>
<P>Cast thine Eye, <HI>Thomas,</HI> to the Great
Ones of the Land; enquire of the Privy
Counsellors and Senators, and tell thy Peo∣ple,
whence it cometh to pass, that Play-Houses
abound, and new Societies of wick∣ed
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>
Ones, whom they call Comedians and
Actors, are erected; more Plays acted, and
Play-Houses built, than ever were in Use
in the Lacivious Reign of the vilest among
the Kings; go thy ways, and examine the
costly Edifices which are dedicated to that
Idol <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Baal</HI> of this Day, which is
worshipped more than the Living God; and
see, <HI>Thomas,</HI> If these are the Works of the
Reformers of thy People.</P>
<P>These Things are done, and thou keep∣est
Silence; whereas, thou liftest up thy
Voice on high against our late Queen, and a∣gainst
her Servants; and cryest in the Gates
of the City, against the Priests of her House,
as against the Worshippers of <HI>Baal;</HI> saying,
Ye do Evil, and ye are Deceivers, leading
aside the People of the Lord: But, Whe∣ther
are these thy Friends leading the Peo∣ple?
Are they not leading them the broad
Way to Destruction, even through those
Gates of Death, the Houses and Sinks of
Vileness, wherewith they entice simple
Ones <HI>to love Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Fools to hate
Knowledge?</HI> Verily, <HI>Thomas,</HI> thou art Faul∣ty
in this Thing, forasmuch as thou can'st
not gainsay the Verity of what I lay to thy
Charge, and can'st not Answer in the be∣half
of those, who thou art lifting up in
the Eyes of the People; but must acknow∣ledge
that they do very Wickedly, even
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
more Wickedly than all those that have
gone before them.</P>
<P>Neither think thou so within thy Heart,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hat these Men are on <HI>God's side;</HI> for that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey have been Healers of the Breaches of

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ord according to all the mighty Things
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hich he hath done for them; for, surely
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Hearts are lifted up, and they have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rgotten <HI>the Years of the Right Hand of the

Lord hath made, we will be glad and Rejoice
therein,</HI> for they are <HI>sacrificing to their Sword,
and to their Bow;</HI> they are <HI>following the De∣vices
and Desires of their own Hearts.</HI> Nay,
<HI>Thomas,</HI> it seemeth that these Men are render∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g
their Thanksgiving to the Devil, for those
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eliverances which God hath wrought for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em; and saying, to the People, be ye
Wicked, because the Lord hath been very
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ood unto them.</P>
<P>If thou passest through the House of the
Mighty, and seest the Habitation of the
Princes, say, if thy Heart does not Reproach
thee, <HI>Are these,</HI> Thomas, <HI>the Men fearing
God?</HI> Where is the Name of the Lord call'd
upon among them? Yea, rather are they
not calling upon Satan every Hour? How
are the Days spent in Wickedness, and the

the Example of their Rulers, <HI>to Eat and to
Drink, and to rise up to Play?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas, Thomas,</HI> Remembrest thou the
Days of our Queen? Verily, she was a
Woman fearing God, and walking in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Truth, howbeit some about her were Son<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of <HI>Belial,</HI> and that she was Deceived there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

of her Heart she did those Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
for she serv'd the Lord Day and Nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

therefore was she hated of thee, and of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

neither can it be said of her, that sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

the Inhabitants of the Land: She <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P><HI>Verily, Thomas,</HI> Thou hast wrongfully ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>used

to the Wicked: Moreover, in this, she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ath been wrongfully dealt withal; That
Men rejoice over her as over a wicked One,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd speak Evil of her, not knowing the
Truth; in this they do very wickedly;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd if thou hast joined Hands with them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erein, I Counsel thee to Repent, and to
all to Mind the manner of the People,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hom thou now Exaltest above her, in

the Works of God among us, <HI>Yea,</HI> or
<HI>Nay:</HI> For surely, <HI>Thomas,</HI> If the leading
the People, by the Hand, into open Wick∣edness,
be the Work of the Lord, then are

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nisguided and deceived.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="21"/>
Furthermore, <HI>Thomas,</HI> I advise thee to
Consider what Progress the Power of Sa∣tan
hath made among the People of the
Land, to Debauch, and to stir up the Peo∣ple
to Vanity, even in the few Days, which
have pass'd since the Queen <HI>was gathered un∣to
to her People;</HI> and that thou mayest know
from thence, what shall be in the latter
Days of this Age, when the People shal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
take leave, from this beginning of Wick∣edness,
to go on and Sin against the Lord
with a high Hand.</P>
<P>If our Princes, who ride in Chariots, go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
daily in Solemn Procession to the Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

by Reason of the encrease of those, who
by their Example, delight in Vanity, seve∣ral
new Ones are providing, and new So∣cieties,
by the Licence of the Rulers, are
forming in the City of thy People; How
long, think'st thou, it may be before the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Cities of the Land shall all be thronged
with Schools of Wickedness, and the Youth
of our Land led away to Destruction, even
by the Voice of Authority? How shall
the <HI>high Places</HI> of Lewdness and Abomina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion,
which in the Time of the Queen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
whose Name thou hast loaden with Re∣proach,
were pull'd down; and by reason
of her hatred of all Wickedness, were for∣bidden
to be built up and restored, and
the Names of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> and <HI>May</HI> Fairs be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
given to them, as of Old? And how shall
travelling Wickedness prevail in the open
Assemblies of the Land, even as Markets
and Fairs, and Play-Houses be erected, to
the Offence of those who fear the Lord,
and <HI>who pray for the Peace of Jerusa∣lem?</HI></P>
<P>Verily,
it hath been told me, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
and I rejoice thereat, that certain wicked
and abominable Persons have already so
far shewed themselves in their Interludes
and Plays, as that they have displeased <HI>the
King,</HI> and that he hath been pleased to cause
some Restraint to be laid on them; there∣fore
blessed be the King, and blessed be the
God of the King, who hath put it in his
Heart to do so. But surely it will be thy
Duty, and the Duty of all those who love
the Land of their Nativity, to endeavour
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o let the King understand, that not only a
Restraint, but a total Dissolution of these
Corporations of <HI>Sathan,</HI> is required at his
Hands; and that unless it be done, Judg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent
and Wrath will be upon his People,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd upon the Land.</P>
<P>I am given to understand, <HI>Friend Thomas,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at if our King were rightly informed of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Things, he would cause it to be other∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise
in the Land; and would not suffer
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il Examples in his own Houshold to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eive
and to draw aside the People com∣mitted
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>
to his Charge; for <HI>I wot,</HI> that our
Lord the King meaneth well, and desireth
with his Heart to do the Things which are
praise-worthy: But it is not unknown unto
us, that he is yet a Stranger in the Land
which he is set to govern; and it may be,
that he knoweth not fully, as yet, the
Wickedness of the Imagination of the Hearts
of his People; how willing and forward
they are, to embrace the Works of Darkness,
and to run blindly upon their own De∣struction.
If the King were plainly and
uprightly dealt withal concerning this Mat∣ter,
he would not suffer such Evils to pre∣vail,
for that his Heart is Right after the
Laws of God, albeit the Country from
whence he came, has not been governed
after this manner.</P>
<P>It is then requir'd at thy Hands, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
and at the Hands of those thy Friends, who
thou callest the GUIDES of the People, that
ye should deal truly with the King, and
that ye should tell the King, or those who
are about him; charging them that they
deal faithfully with the King herein: That
unless speedy Care be taken by them, to
put a Stop to the Growth of Prophaness and
all manner of Wickedness, which is gon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
out among the People of the Land, ever
since the Death of our good Queen, Wrath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
will be upon them, and upon this People
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>
from the Lord, and <HI>we shall be destroy'd,
both we and our King.</HI></P>
<P>And how cometh it to pass, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that
thy Mouth hath been stopp'd thus long,
and that thou hast not spoken in the Ears of
the People of these Things: Hast thou not
seen, yea, hast thou not known, that the
Great Ones act unrighteously, and walk
not in the Paths of Truth? Hast thou not
seen, that Prophaness abounds, and that
they have broken out, even with Violence,
in the Ways of Wickedness, as I told thee,
more than all that have been before them?
Is not this to justifie what hath been laid to
their Charge, in a late Book publish'd, as
Men say, with evil Intent against the King,
wherein it is said, <HI>that not one of the Princes
of the Land who stand before the King at
this Time, have any Fear of God before their
Eyes.</HI> Verily, <HI>Thomas,</HI> this is a Lamenta∣tion,
and the whole Land hath Cause to
mourn therefore; and yet where are the
People, even among those whom thou
callest the <HI>People of the Lord,</HI> who taketh
any notice thereof? But ye cover the Ini∣quities
of those, who give their Hands to
carry on the Work of the King; as if their
Sins were not to be Reproved, or which is
yet worse, as if the King's Throne was not
to be Established by Righteousness: Woe
unto them who call Evil Good, and Good
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
Evil: The Offences of these from whom we
look for Salvation to the Land, are more
grievous to Righteous Men, than the wick∣edness
of the Wicked; forasmuch as this
gives Occasion to the Enemy to Blaspheme,
and likewise because it causeth the Delive∣rance
which we looked for, to fail.</P>
<P>Thinkest thou, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that the People
of the Lord in this Land, did not expect,
that the King was exalted on the Throne,
to deliver us from Wickedness, and from
the ungodly Government of these Men, who
had not the Fear of God before their Eyes
as well as from the Enemies of the publick'
Peace, and from the Tyrannous Oppressions
of the <HI>Stranger?</HI> Wherefore are we called
upon to give Thanks unto the Lord for our
Deliverance, if we are yet in the Bonds of
Iniquity? <HI>Nay, Thomas,</HI> But the Reforma∣tion
of the People of the Land is the Work
of the King, for this hath God highly exalt∣ed
him to the Throne, and for this our Ex∣pectations
are towards him, which if he
should not endeavour to accomplish, the
Land will have Cause to mourn, as much
as now it seemeth that we should rejoice.
Neither is our Lord the King ignorant here∣of,
as I understand; but it may be, that he
is yet Ignorant of the Behaviour of his
Nobles and Servants, who, as far as lieth in
them, are pulling down the Work which
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
the King hath built, and causing the Joy
which we have shewed on the Occasion of
the Coming of the King, to be turned into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ourning, forasmuch as we have Reason to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar a Curse, and not a Blessing, shall at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd
these Things: For we shall be ill saved
from Oppression, if we are suffer'd, nay,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>courag'd and led by Example, to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ickeder than we were before, even by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose our Rulers, who should be the terror
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Evil Doers, and a Praise <HI>to those that do
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll.</HI></P>
<P>How is it, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that thou art silent,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay, at all those Things, seeing thou canst
not gain-say the Truth hereof? Is it that
thou art not willing to bring these thy
Friends into Contempt? Be not sollicitous
over-much on that account, for be assured,
that if they thus forsake the Paths of Ver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,
he that <HI>poureth Contempt upon Princes,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll bring them to Shame, and they shall

and present Admirers; for that those who
<HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nour God</HI> only, are the Men <HI>that he will
Honour.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Thomas,</HI> I am moved against
thee, for that thou hast Preached the Do∣ctrine
of Devils; I say unto thee, thou hast
verily preached the Doctrine of Devils, for
thou hast said, that Men should return
Evil for Evil; whereas the Word teacheth

thou art not in the Place of <HI>Samuel,</HI> that

Wherefore thou hast preached the Doctrine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which the Lord abhors, and hast moved<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thy People to Vengeance, which he hath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
taken out of thy Hand, and said it belong∣eth
to God.</P>
<P>What aileth thee, O Man, that tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ragest
in Spirit after this ungodly manner<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
May it not suffice thee that Evil Men may
be question'd, in the due Course of the Law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the Land, but thou must push thy Peo∣ple
upon making them <HI>Victims</HI> to their un∣godly
Wrath? I counsel thee to leave these<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Things to the Assembly of the Nation, and
to preach Righteousness and Truth unto
the People, Instructing them in the Fear of
the Lord, and to avoid the Evil Exam∣ples
which are set before them, by the El∣ders
and great Men of the Land, that they
may not be led by Evil Examples to pro∣mote
Debauchery in the Land: This <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI>
is thy Work and Mine; and not to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
pursue the Wicked Designs of angry Men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
much less to teach the People to do abomi∣nable
Things, and to <HI>render Evil for Evil,
and to do to others as they would have don<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to us,</HI> albeit they did it not neither.</P>
<P>It may be, thou wilt be wroth with me,
for thus choosing thee out from the many
of thy Tribe, and Reproving thee in this
sort: I shall therefore render thee a Reason
for this also: Know, therefore, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>
that whereas it seemed good unto thee to
become the publick Reprover of others, and
to get thee a Name for thy much speaking
against the Men in Power, during the
Life of <HI>ANNE</HI> the Queen; and more∣over,
that whereas some of the Wise Men
reproved thee for the same, <HI>saying,</HI> Where∣fore
did'st thou do so? Thou did'st defend
thyself against them, by saying, that it was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hy Duty to bear thy Testimony against all
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngodliness and unrighteousness of Men:</HI> And
again, when it was said unto thee, that thy
Words were not spoken in Season, thou
answered'st, that thou wer't Commanded
<HI>to Reprove and Exhort, in Season and out
of Season.</HI> Likewise when it was said un∣to
thee, that it was not the proper Design
of thy <HI>Speaking-Bench,</HI> to enter into the
Disputations of Matters relating to Govern∣ment,
and to the Princes of thy People,
thou did'st allege the Prophets, who were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent to Reprove Kings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These things. I do not say to thee on my
own Affirmation, <HI>Thomas,</HI> howbeit I have
been informed thereof, and am persuaded
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Thoughts that thou did'st give such
Answers, or Answers to that Effect, or the
like, unto Men who question'd with thee
concerning these Things; which causes
me to wonder greatly, why thou shouldest
decline the Performance of these Things at
<PB N="34" REF="31"/>
this Time, when thou thoughtest it to be
thy Duty at the Time before mention'd,
and which thou couldest not refrain from,
as thou sayest, without being blame wor∣thy.
Plainly, <HI>Thomas,</HI> thou deservest Re∣buke
in this Matter, and dost openly shew
unto the World, that thou art a Time-ser∣ver,
and a Respecter of Persons; and I am
moved in Spirit to use harsher Words unto
thee, but I restrain myself in that, possibly
thou may'st amend; and I therefore give
thee an Occasion to testify thy Repentance,
by a better and more upright Practice,
which I wish thee to go speedily about.</P>
<P>It behoveth thee, <HI>Thomas,</HI> much rather
to do thus, than to enquire after the Truth
of what I have herein asserted, <HI>to wit,</HI> that
the Great Ones, the Princes, and Heads of
the People, are leading the Ignorant astray
into Wickedness, more than did those who
went before them.</P>
<P>Howbeit, least thou shouldest endeavour
to palliate and extenuate, in behalf of those
who are thy Darlings in other respects, I
must lead thee by the Hand, <HI>not by the
Nose,</HI> Thomas, <HI>others have done thee that
Office already,</HI> that thou may'st be Convin∣ced,
yea, even Confounded, for those
whom thou hast with so great Confidence
taken on thee to recommend as good Men,
and Men fearing God: I do <HI>thee Justice,
<PB N="35" REF="32"/>
Thomas,</HI> and therefore observe in thy be∣half,
that thy Modesty would not permit
thee to say, <HI>They were Men hating Coverous∣ness.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been usual with thee, tho' it ap∣peareth
to me, that it was not beseeming
thy Person; I say, it hath been usual with
thee, to Salute the Servants of thy Queen;
such as Lord—, and Lord—, Lord—,
and Lord—, with Rude▪ and
Prophane Titles, and Filthy Words; such as
<HI>R</HI>—<HI>B</HI>—, De—ees, Who—ers,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd many such unseemly Speeches, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may not Repeat; for these I would meek∣ly
Reprove thee, <HI>Thomas;</HI> howbeit, I should
not have spoken thereof on this Occasion;
But that thou may'st enquire into the
Lives and Conversations of thy Friends,
who are call'd Lord—, Lord—, Lord
—, Lord—, Lord—, and many
more; and that thou should'st write the
History of their Lives, and also of their
Conversations, That the People of the Land
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay be assured, they are more Holy, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore Righteous Persons; more fearing God,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd hating Covetousness; more free from
those Things, whereof the other were ac∣cused,
than those who went immediately
before them; and if thou can'st not make
the Truth thereof appear, then, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
thou must give them the like Appellations,
<PB N="36" REF="33"/>
or wipe them off from the Characters of
those who went before them.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Thomas,</HI> I must Commun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
with thee, yet a while, about the growth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of Publick Wickedness, of which I have
spoken, which, perhaps, thou wilt find ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
some Quibble to avoid; for thou art a cun∣ning
Shaver, and knowest right well how
to wash those <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> which tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would'st should appear Whiter than others
and thou wilt be ready to say, That my
Accusation reacheth to no other Offences
then that of seeing Plays, and such like <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>
bominations, which albeit, thou dost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
approve; yet thou may'st think, deserv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
not to be esteemed a Debauching the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple,
and leading them to Destruction, se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing
that those Things were publickly pra∣ctic'd
by the Great Ones; not in the Day<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of <HI>Anne</HI> the Queen only, but in all Times
even in the Days of the Years of <HI>Willia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
and of <HI>Mary,</HI> the King and Queen, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
were worthily esteem'd among the best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
those, who have sat on the Throne of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Lands.</P>
<P>But know, O Man! That this is n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing
so, and there are who may prove <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
thee, That <HI>Mary</HI> the Queen, of whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
may'st speak, during her whole Time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sitting on the Throne, was seldom seen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
go into those Houses of Filthiness and A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bomination,
No, not within their Doors<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

and that being desired by some of the In∣struments
of Satan, for such are always bu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sie

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>let thee know I have been inform'd, <HI>That
she would not give such an Example unto the
People of the Land;</HI> neither, <HI>Thomas,</HI> can'st
thou say, that the King, whose Name was
<HI>William,</HI> was seen during his abode here,
above once, (and then apparently to his
Dislike) at any of those accursed Houses.</P>
<P>But, having said enough of these Things,
and to Silence thee in the pretence of my
having nothing of Moment but this, of the
<HI>Play-Houses,</HI> to make my Complaints a∣gainst;
<HI>Come thou hither, and I will shew thee
greater Abominations than these.</HI></P>
<P>The Great Ones not Content with Play-Houses,
and New Societies of these Chil∣dren
of Hell, called <HI>Comedians,</HI> are now set∣ting
up, and are preparing to set up <HI>Weekly</HI>
Masquerades, <HI>Circular</HI> Balls, <HI>Nights</HI> for
Gaming and Musick <HI>Meetings</HI> in divers Parts
of this great City, and thou may'st meet
with the Advertisements of these Things
in the Publick Papers, called News, as if
there were no Offence given thereby, ei∣ther
unto God, or unto Good People.</P>
<P>And, What thinkest thou of these Things,
<HI>Thomas Bradbury?</HI> Are these <HI>the Ways</HI> by
which the People of this Land are to be
Reformed? And by which the Honour
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>
and Interest of Holy Religion is to be main∣tained?
Are these the Steps of thy New<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Deliverers? If thou speak not <HI>Now;</HI> If <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
thou lift not up thy Voice like a Trumpet
the Blood, or Loss of the Souls of thy Peo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple

to them all, and they all shall be Guilty, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
having been Watchmen in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and
not having done the Duty of Watchmen:
And after God shall have stop'd thy Mouth▪
who refuseth to speak when his Honour▪
and his Interest, and Kingdom, is thus Impi∣ously
invaded, he shall deliver his Churches,
and his People from the Floods that are o∣ver-whelming
them, and thine Eyes <HI>shall
not see it.</HI></P>
<P>But, if thou do'st thy Duty, if thou giv∣est
warning to the Princes of thy People;
if thou speakest boldly, and callest upon
Men every where to Repent; if thou cry∣est
aloud, and sparest not, sparest not the
Great, the Powerful, the Fierce, the Furi∣ous;
if thou sparest not; thy self, neither
fearest the Face of Man, the Blessing of a
Nation, ready to Perish, shall come upon
thee; the Portion of a Righteous Man shall
be thy Reward. God shall own thee and
thy Work, and that in the Face of his and
thy Enemies. Thou shalt be a Wall of Fire
