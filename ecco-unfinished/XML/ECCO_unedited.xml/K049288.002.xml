<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Ferdinand Count Fathom.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="36" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is smitten with the charms of a female adven∣turer,
whose allurements subject him to a new
vicissitude of fortune.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG those who were distinguished
by his gallantry, was the young wife of
an old citizen of London, who had
granted her permission to reside at the Hot-well
for the benefit of her health, under the eye and
inspection of his own sister, who was a maiden
of fifty years. The pupil, whose name was Mrs.
Trapwell, though low in stature, was sinely
shaped, her countenance engaging, though her
complexion was brown, her hair in colour ri∣valled
the raven's back, and her eyes emulated
the lustre of the diamond. Fathom had been
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
struck with her first appearance; but found it
impracticable to elude the vigilance of her du∣enna,
so as to make a declaration of his flame;
until she herself guessing the situation of his
thoughts, and not displeased with the discovery,
thought proper to furnish him with the oppor∣tunity
he wanted, by counterfeiting an indispo∣sition,
for the cure of which, she knew his ad∣vice
would be implored. This was the begin∣ning
of an acquaintance, which was soon im∣proved
to his wish; and so well did she manage
her attractions, as in some measure to fix the
inconstancy of his disposition; for, at the end
of the season, his passion was not sated; and
they concerted the means of continuing their
commerce, even after their return to London.</P>
<P>This intercourse effectually answered the pur∣pose
of the husband, who had been decoyed into
matrimony, by the cunning of his spouse, whom
he had privately kept as a concubine before
marriage. Conscious of her own precarious situa∣tion,
she had resolved to impose upon the infir∣mities
of Trapwell, and feigning herself preg∣nant,
gave him to understand she could no lon∣ger
conceal her condition from the knowledge
of her brother, who was an officer in the army,
and of such violent passions, that should he once
discover her backsliding, he would undoubtedly
wipe away the stains of his family-dishonour
with her own blood, as well as that of her
keeper. The citizen, to prevent such a catas∣trophe,
took her to wife; but soon after perceiv∣ing
the trick which had been played upon him,
set his invention at work, and at length contriv∣ed
a scheme which he thought would enable
him, not only to retrieve his liberty, but also in∣demnify
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
himself for the mortification he had un∣dergone.</P>
<P>Far from creating any domestic disturbance,
by upbraiding her with her finesse, he seemed
perfectly well pleased with his acquisition; and as
he knew her void of any principle, and extremely
addicted to pleasure, he chose proper occasions
to insinuate, that she might gratify her own in∣clination,
and at the same time turn her beauty
to good account. She joyfully listened to these
remonstrances, and in consequence of their mu∣tual
agreement, she repaired to Bristol-spring,
on pretence of an ill state of health accom∣panied
by her sister-in-law, whom they did not
think proper to intrust with the real motive of
her journey. Fathom's person was agreeable,
and his finances supposed to be in flourishing
order; therefore, she selected him from the
herd of gallants, as a proper sacrifice to the
powers which she adored; and on her arrival in
London, made her husband acquainted with the
importance of her conquest.</P>
<P>Trapwell overwhelmed her with caresses and
praise for her discreet and dutiful conduct, and
faithfully promised that she should pocket in her
own privy purse, one half of the spoils that
should be gathered from her gallant, whom she
therefore undertook to betray, after he had
swore in the most solemn manner, that his in∣tention
was not to bring the affair to a public
trial, which would redound to his own disgrace,
but to extort a round sum of money from the
count, by way of composition. Confiding in
this protestation, she in a few days, gave him
intelligence of an assignation she had made with
our adventurer, at a certain bagnio near Covent∣garden;
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
upon which he secured the assistance of
a particular friend and his own journeyman,
with whom, and a constable, he repaired to the
place of rendezvous, where he waited in an ad∣joining
room according to the directions of his
virtuous spouse, until she made the preconcerted
signal of hemming three times aloud, when he
and his associates rushed into the chamber and
surprised our hero in bed with his inamorata.</P>
<P>The lady, on this occasion, acted her part to
a miracle; she screamed at their approach; and
after an exclamation of “ruined and undone!”
fainted away in the arms of her spouse, who had
by this time seized her by the shoulders, and be∣gun
to upbraid her, with her infidelity and guilt.
As for Fathom, his affliction was unutterable,
when he sound himself discovered in that situa∣tion,
and made prisoner by the two assistants,
who had pinioned him in such a manner, that
he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ir, much less accomplish an escape.
All his ingenuity and presence of mind, seemed
to forsake him in this emergency. The horrors
of an English jury overspread his imagination:
for he at once perceived that the toil into which
he had fallen, was laid for the purpose; conse∣quently
he took it for granted, that there would
be no deficiency in point of evidence. Soon as
he recollected himself, he begged that no violence
might be offered to his person, and intreated the
husband to favour him with a conference, in
which the affair might be compromised, without
prejudice to the reputation of either.</P>
<P>At first, Trapwell breathed nothing but im∣placable
revenge, but by the persuasion of his
friends, after he had sent home his wife in a
chair, he was prevailed upon to hear the propo∣sals
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
of the delinquent, who having assured him,
by way of apology, that he had always believed
the lady was a widow, made him an offer of
five hundred pounds, as an atonement for the
injury he had sustained. This being a sum no
ways adequate to the expectation of the citizen,
who looked upon the count as possessor of an
immense estate, he rejected the terms with dis∣dain,
and made instant application to a judge,
from whom he obtained a warrant for securing
his person till the day of trial. Indeed, in this
case, money was but a secondary consideration
with Trapwell, whose chief aim was to be le∣gally
divorced from a woman he detested. There∣fore,
there was no remedy for the unhappy
count, who in vain offered to double the sum:
he found himself reduced to the bitter alternative
of procuring immediate bail, or going directly to
Newgate.</P>
<P>In this dilemma he sent a messenger to his
friend Ratchkali, whose countenance sell when
he understood the count's condition; nor would
he open his mouth in the stile of consolation,
until he had consulted a certain sollicitor of his
acquaintance, who assured him the law abound∣ed
with such resources, as would infallibly screen
the defendant, had the fact been still more pal∣pable
than it was. He said there was great pre∣sumption
to believe the count had fallen a sacri∣fice
to a conspiracy, which by some means or
other would be detected; and in that case, the
plaintiff might obtain one shilling in lieu of da∣mages.
If that dependance should fail, he hint∣ed
that, in all probability, the witnesses were not
incorruptible; or should they prove to be so,
one man's oath was as good as another's, and
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
thank Heaven, there was no dearth of evidence,
provided money could be found to answer the
necessary occasions.</P>
<P>Ratchkali comforted by these insinuations,
and dreading the resentment of our adventurer,
who in his despair, might punish him severely for
his want of friendship, by some precipitate ex∣planation
of the commerce they had carried on;
moved, I say, by these considerations, and more∣over
tempted with the prospect of continuing to
reap the advantages resulting from their conjunc∣tion,
he and another person of credit with whom
he largely dealt in jewels, condescended to be∣come
sureties for the appearance of Fathom,
who was accordingly admitted to bail. Not but
that the Tyroleze knew Ferdinand too well, to
confide in his parole: he depended chiefly upon
his ideas of self-interest, which he thought,
would persuade him to risk the uncertain issue of
a trial, rather than quit the field before the har∣vest
was half over; and he resolved to make
his own retreat without ceremony, should our
hero be unwise enough to abandon his bail.</P>
<P>Such an adventure could not long lie con∣cealed
from the notice of the public, even if
both parties had been at pains to suppress the
circumstances: but the plaintiff, far from seeking
to cover, affected to complain loudly of his
misfortune, that he might interest his neighbours
in his behalf, and raise a spirit of rancour and
animosity, to influence the jury against this inso∣lent
foreigner, who had come over into England
to debauch our wives and deflower our daugh∣ters;
while he employed a formidable band of
lawyers to support the indictment, which he said
for ten thousand pounds damages.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Mean while, Fathom and his associate did not
fail to take all proper measures for his defence;
they retained a powerful bar of council, and the
sollicitor was supplied with one hundred pounds
after another, to answer the expence of secret
service; still assuring his clients that every thing
was in an excellent train, and that his adversary
would gain nothing but shame and confusion of
face. Nevertheless, there was a necessity for
postponing the trial, on account of a material
evidence, who, though he wavered, was not
yet quite brought over; and the attorney found
means to put off the decision from term to term,
until there was no quibble left for further delay.
While this suit was depending, our hero conti∣nued
to move in his usual sphere; nor did the
report of his situation at all operate to his disad∣vantage,
in the polite world: on the contrary,
it added a fresh plume to his character, in the
eyes of all those who were not before acquaint∣ed
with the triumphs of his gallantry. Not∣withstanding
this countenance of his friends, he
himself considered the affair in a very serious light;
and perceiving that at any rate he must be a consi∣derable
loser, he resolved to double his assiduity in
trade, that he might be the more able to afford
the extraordinary expence to which he was
subjected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fresh cause for exerting his equanimity and for∣titude.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader may have observed, that Fa∣thom
with all his circumspection, had a
weak side, which exposed him to sundry mis∣chances:
this was his covetousness, which on
some occasions became too hard for his discre∣tion:
at this period of time, it was by the cir∣cumstances
of his situation, inflamed to a degree
of rapacity. He was now prevailed upon to
take a hand at whist, or piquet, and even to
wield the hazard-box; though he had hitherto
declared himself an irreconcileable enemy to all
forts of play; and so uncommon was his success
and dexterity at these exercises, as to surprize
his acquaintance, and arrouse the suspicion of
some people, who repined at his prosperity.</P>
<P>But in nothing was his conduct more inexcus∣able,
than in giving way to the dangerous teme∣rity
of Ratchkali, which he had been always at
pains to restrain, and permitting him to practise
the same fraud upon an English nobleman, which
had been executed upon himself at Franckfort.
In other words, the Tyroleze by the canal of
Ferdinand's finger and recommendation, sold a
pebble for a real brilliant, and in a few days the
cheat was discovered, to the infinite confusion of
our adventurer, who nevertheless assumed the
guise of innocence, with so much art, and ex∣pressed
such indignation against the villain, who
had i mposed upon his judgment and unsuspecting
gener osity, that his lordship acquitted him of any
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
share in the deceit, and contented himself with
the restitution, which he insisted upon making
out of his own pocket, until he should be able
to apprehend the rogue, who had thought pro∣per
to abscond for his own safety. In spite of
all this exculpation, his character did not fail to
retain a sort of stigma, which indeed the plain∣est
proofs of innocence are hardly able to efface;
and his connexion with such a palpable knave
as the Tyroleze appeared to be, had an effect to
his prejudice, in the minds of all those who
were privy to the occurrence.</P>
<P>When a man's reputation is once brought in
question, every trifle is by the malevolence of
mankind, magnified into a strong presumption
against the culprit: a few whispers communi∣cated
by the envious mouth of slander, which
he can have no opportunity to answer and re∣fute,
shall, in the opinion of the world, convict
him of the most horrid crimes; and for one hy∣pocrite
who is decked with the honours of vir∣tue,
there are twenty good men who suffer the
ignominy of vice; so well disposed are indivi∣duals
to trample upon the fame of their fellow∣creatures.
If the most unblemished merit is not
protected from this injustice, it will not be won∣dered
at, that no quarter was given to the cha∣racter
of an adventurer like Fathom, who a∣mong
other unlucky occurrences, had the mis∣fortune
to be recognized about this time, by his
two Parisian friends Sir Stentor Stiles and Sir
Giles Squirrel.</P>
<P>These worthy knights-errant had returned to
their own country, after having made a very
prosperous campaign in France, at the end of
which, however, they very narrowly escaped
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
the gallies; and seeing the Polish count seated
at the head of taste and politeness, they imme∣diately
circulated the story of his defeat at Paris,
with many ludicrous circumstances of their own
invention, and did not scruple to affirm that he
was a rank impostor. When the laugh is raised
upon a great man, he never fails to dwindle
into contempt. Ferdinand began to per∣ceive
a change in the countenance of his friends.
His company was no longer sollicited with that
eagerness which they had formerly expressed in
his behalf: even his entertainments were neg∣lected;
when he appeared at any private or pub∣lic
assembly, the ladies, instead of glowing with
pleasure, as formerly, now tittered or regarded
him with looks of disdain; and a certain pert,
little, forward coquette, with a view to put him
out of countenance by raising the laugh at his ex∣pence,
asked him one night, at a drum, when
he had heard from his relations in Poland? She
succeeded in her design upon the mirth of the
audience, but was disappointed in the other
part of her aim; for, our hero replied without
the least mark of discomposure, “They are all
in good health at your service, madam; I wish
I knew in what part of the world your rela∣tions
reside, that I might return the compliment.”
By this answer, which was the more severe, as
the young lady was of very doubtful extrac∣tion,
he retorted the laugh upon the aggressor,
though he likewise failed in his attempt upon her
temper: for, she was perhaps the only person pre∣sent,
who equall'd himself instability of countenance.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this appearance of uncon∣cern,
he was deeply touched with these mark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of alienation, in the behaviour of his friends
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
and foreseeing in his own disgrace, the total
shipwreck of his fortune, he entered into a me∣lancholy
deliberation with himself, about the
means of retrieving his importance in the beau∣monde,
or of turning his address into some other
channel, where he could stand upon a less slip∣pery
foundation. In this exercise of his thoughts,
no scheme occured more feasible, than that of
securing the booty he had made, and retiring
with his associate, who was also blown, into some
other country, where, their names and charac∣ters
being unknown, they might pursue their
old plan of commerce without molestation. He
imparted this suggestion to the Tyroleze, who
approved the proposal of decamping, though he
combated with all his might our hero's inclina∣tion
to withdraw himself before the trial, by
repeating the assurances of the sollicitor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who told
him he might depend upon being reimbursed by the
sentence of the court, for great part of the sums
he had expended in the course of the prosecution.</P>
<P>Fathom suffered himself to be persuaded by
these arguments, supported with the desire of
making an honourable retreat, and waiting pati∣ently
for the day of trouble, discharged his sure∣ties,
by a personal appearance in court. Yet
this was not the only score he discharged that
morning; the sollicitor presented his own bill
before they set out for Westminster-hall, and
gave the count to understand that it was the
custom, from time immemorial, for the client to
clear with his attorney before trial. Ferdinand
had nothing to object against this established
rule, though he looked upon it as a bad omen,
in spite of all the sollicitor's confidence and pro∣testations;
and he was not a little confounded,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
when looking into the contents, he found him∣self
charged with 350 attendances. He knew
it was not his interest to disoblige his lawyer at
such a juncture; nevertheless, he could not help
expostulating with him on this article, which
seemed to be so falsly stated with regard to the
number; when his questions drew on an expla∣nation,
by which he found he had incurred the
penalty of three shillings and four-pence for
every time he chanced to meet the conscienti∣ous
attorney, either in the park, the coffee-house
or the street, provided they had exchanged the
common salutation: and he had great reason to
believe the sollicitor had often thrown himself in
his way, with a view to swell this item of his
account.</P>
<P>With this extortion our adventurer was fain
to comply, because he lay at the mercy of the
caitiff; accordingly, he with a good grace paid
the demand, which including his former dis∣bursements,
amounted to three hundred and
sixty-five pounds eleven shillings three-pence
three farthings, and then presenting himself be∣fore
the judge, quietly submitted to the laws of
the realm. His council behaved like men of
consummate abilities in their profession; they ex∣erted
themselves with equal industry, eloquence
and erudition, in their endeavours to perplex the
truth, browbeat the evidence, puzzle the judge,
and mislead the jury: but the defendant found
himself woefully disappointed in the deposition
of Trapwell's journeyman, whom the sollicitor
pretended to have converted to his interest:
this witness, as the attorney afterwards declared,
played booty, and the facts came out so clear,
that Ferdinand Count Fathom was convicted of
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
criminal conversation with the plaintiff's wife,
and cast in fifteen hundred pounds, under the de∣nomination
of damages.</P>
<P>He was not so much surprized as afflicted at
this decision, because he saw it gradually approach∣ing
from the examination of the first evidence:
his thoughts were now employed in casting about
for some method of deliverance, from the snare
in which he found himself intangled. To escape
he foresaw it would be impracticable, as Trap∣well
would undoubtedly be prepared for arresting
him before he could quit Westminster-hall; he
was too well acquainted with Ratchkali's prin∣ciples,
to expect any assistance from that quarter,
in money matters; and he was utterly averse
to the payment of the sum awarded against him,
which would have exhausted his whole fortune.
He therefore resolved to try the friendship of
some persons of fashion, with whom he had
maintained an intimacy of correspondence: should
they fail him in the day of his necessity, he pro∣posed
to have recourse to his former sureties,
one of whom he meant to bilk, while the
other might accompany him in his retreat: or,
should both these expedients miscarry, he deter∣mined,
rather than part with his effects, to
undergo the most disagreeable confinement, in
hope of obtaining the jailor's connivance at his
escape.</P>
<P>These resolutions being taken, he met his fate
with great fortitude and equanimity, and calm∣ly
suffered himself to be conveved to the house
of a sheriff's officer, who, as he made his exit
from the hall, according to his own expectation,
executed a writ against him, at the suit of Trap∣well,
for a debt of two thousand pounds. To
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
this place he was followed by his sollicitor, who
was allured by the prospect of another job, and
who with great demonstrations of satisfaction,
congratulated him upon the happy issue of the
trial; arrogating to himself, the merit of having
saved him eight thousand pounds, in the article
of damages, by the previous steps he had taken,
and the noble defence that he and his friends the
council had made for their client: he even hinted
an expectation of receiving a gratuity for his ex∣traordinary
care and discretion.</P>
<P>Fathom, galled as he was with his misfortune,
and enraged at the effrontery of this pettisogger,
maintained a serenity of countenance, and sent
the attorney with a message to the plaintiff,
importing, that as he was a foreigner, and could
not be supposed to have so much cash about him,
as to spare fifteen hundred pounds from the funds
of his ordinary expence, he would grant him a
bond payable in two months, during which pe∣riod,
he should be able to procure a proper re∣mittance
from his own estate. While the solli∣citor
was employed in this negociation, he dis∣patched
his valet de chambre to one nobleman,
and Maurice to another, with billets, signifying
the nature of the verdict which his adversary
had obtained, and desiring that each would lend
him a thousand pounds upon his parole, until he
could negociate bills upon the continent.</P>
<P>His three messengers returned almost at the
same instant of time, and these were the answers
they brought back.</P>
<P>Trapwell absolutely rejected his personal se∣curity;
and threatned him with all the horrors
of a goal, unless he would immediately discharge
the debt, or procure sufficient bondsmen; and
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
one of his quality-friends, favoured him with this
reply to his request.</P>

<P>Ferdinand was not such a novice in the world
as to be disappointed at these repulses; especially
as he had laid very little stress upon the applica∣tion,
which was made by way of an experiment
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
upon the gratitude or caprice of those two no∣blemen,
whom he had actually more than once
obliged with the same fort of assistance which he
now sollicited, though not to such a considerable
amount.</P>
<P>Having nothing further to expect from the
fashionable world, he sent the Tyroleze to the
person who had been bail for his appearance,
with full instructions to explain his present occa∣sion
in the most favourable light, and desire he
would reinforce the credit of the count with his
security; but, that gentleman, though he placed
the most perfect confidence on the honour of
our hero, and would have willingly entered into
bonds again for his personal appearance, was not
quite so well satisfied of his circumstances, as
to become liable for the payment of two thousand
pounds, an expence, which in his opinion, the
finances of no foreign count were able to de∣fray:
he therefore, lent a deaf ear to the most
pressing remonstrances of the ambassador, who
had recourse to several other merchants, with
the same bad success; so that the prisoner de∣spairing
of bail, endeavoured to persuade Ratch∣kali,
that it would be his interest to contribute a
thousand pounds towards his discharge, that he
might be enabled to quit England with a good
grace, and execute his part of the plan they
had projected.</P>
<P>So powerful was his eloquence on the occasion,
and such strength of argument did he use, that
even the Tyroleze seemed convinced, though
reluctantly, and agreed to advance the necessary
sum upon the bond and judgment of our adven∣turer,
who being disabled from transacting his

faithful Maurice and the sollicitor, whose fide∣lity
he bespoke with the promise of an ample
recompence.</P>

<P>YET, he had no sooner committed his ef∣fects
to the care of this triumvirate, than
his fancy was visited with direful warnings, which
produced cold sweats and palpitations, and threw
him into such agonies of apprehension as he
had never known before. He remembred the
former desertion of the Tyroleze, the recent
villainy of the sollicitor, and recollected the re∣marks
he had made upon the disposition and cha∣racter
of his valet, which evinced him a fit com∣panion
for the other two.</P>
<P>Alarmed at these reflections, he intreated the
bailiff to indulge him with a visit to his own
lodgings, and even offered one hundred guineas
as a gratification for his compliance. But, the
officer, who had formerly lost a considerable sum
by the escape of a prisoner, would not run any
risque in an affair of such consequence, and our
hero was obliged to submit to the tortures of his
own presaging fears. After he had waited five
hours in the most racking impatience, he saw
the attorney enter with all the marks of hurry,
fatigue and consternation, and heard him ex∣claim,
“Good God, have you seen the gentle∣man?”</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
Fathom found his fears realized in this inter∣rogation,
to which he answered in a tone of
horror and dismay, “What gentleman? I sup∣pose
I am robbed: speak and keep me no longer
in suspence.” “Robbed! cried the attorney, the
Lord forbid! I hope you can depend upon the
person you impowered to receive your jewels
and cash. I must own his proceedings are a lit∣tle
extraordinary: for after he had rummaged
your scrutore, from which in presence of me
and your servant, he took one hundred and fifty
guineas, a parcel of diamond rings and buckles
according to this here inventory, which I wrote
with my own hand, and East-India bonds to the
tune of five hundred more, we adjourned to
Garraway's, where he left me alone, under pre∣tence
of going to a broker of his acquaintance
who lived in the neighbourhood, while the va∣let,
as I imagined, waited for us in the alley.
Well, Sir, he stayed so long, that I began to be
uneasy, and at length resolved to send the ser∣vant
in quest of him, but when I went out for
that purpose, deuce a servant was to be found.
Though I in person inquired for him, at every
alehouse within half a mile of the place. I
then dispatched no less than five ticket porters
upon the scent after them, and I myself by a
direction from the bar-keeper, went to signor
Ratchkali's lodgings, where, as they told me,
he had not been seen since nine o'clock in the
morning. Upon this intimation, I came directly
hither, to give you timely notice, that you
may without delay, take measures for your own
security. The best thing you can do, is to take
out writs for apprehending him, in the counties
of Middlesex, Surry, Kent and Essex, and I
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
shall put them in the hands of trusty and dili∣gent
officers, who will soon ferret him out of his
lurking-place, provided he sculks within ten
miles of the bills of mortality: to be sure the
job will be expensive; and all these runners must
be paid before-hand. But, what then? the
defendant is worth powder, and if we can once
secure him, I'll warrant the prosecution will quit
cost.”</P>
<P>Fathom was almost choaked with concern and
resentment, at the news of this mischance, so
that he could not utter one word until this nar∣rative
was finished. Nor was his suspicion con∣fined
to the Tyroleze and his own lacquey; he
considered the sollicitor as their accomplice and
director, and was so much provoked at the latter
part of his harangue, that his discretion seemed
to vanish, and collaring the attorney, “Vil∣lain!
said he, you yourself have been a principal
actor in this robbery;” Then turning to the by∣standers,
“and I desire in the king's name, that
he may be secured, until I can make oath before
a magistrate, in support of the charge. If you
refuse your assistance in detaining him, I will
make immediate application to one of the secre∣taries
of state who is my particular friend, and
he will see justice done to all parties.”</P>
<P>At mention of this formidable name, the
bailiff and his whole family were in commotion,
to obstruct the retreat of the lawyer, who stood
aghast, and trembled under the grasp of our ad∣venturer:
but, soon as he found himself deli∣vered
from this embrace, by the interposition
of the spectators, and collected his spirits, which
had been suddenly dissipated by Fathom's unex∣pected
assault, he began to display one art of his
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
occupation, which he always reserved for extra∣ordinary
occasions: this was the talent of abuse,
which he poured forth with such fluency of op∣probrious
language, that our hero smarting as
he was, and almost desperate with his loss, de∣viated
from that temperance of behaviour which
he had hitherto preserved, and snatching up the
poker, with one stroke opened a deep trench
upon the attorney's skull, that extended from the
hind head, almost to the upper part of the nose,
upon each side of which, it discharged a sanguine
stream. Notwithstanding the pain of this appli∣cation,
the sollicitor was transported with joy at
the sense of the smart, and inwardly congratu∣lated
himself upon the appearance of his own
blood, which he no sooner perceived, than he
exclaimed, “I'm a dead man,” and fell upon
the floor at full length.</P>
<P>Immediate recourse was had to a surgeon in
the neighbourhood, who having examined the
wound, declared there was a dangerous depres∣sion
of the first table of the skull, and that if
he could save the patient's life, without the ap∣plication
of the trepan, it would be one of the
greatest cures that ever were performed. By
this time, Fathom's first transport being over∣blown,
he summoned up his whole resolution,
and reflected upon his own ruin, with that forti∣tude
which had never failed him in the emergen∣cies
of his fate: little disturbed at the prognostic
of the surgeon, which he considered in the right
point of view; “Sir,” said he, “I am not so
unacquainted with the resistance of an attorney's
skull, as to believe the chastisement I have be∣stowed
on him, will at all endanger his life,
which is in much greater jeopardy from the
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
hands of the common executioner: for, not∣withstanding
this accident, I am determined to
prosecute the rascal for robbery, with the utmost
severity of the law; and that I may have a suf∣ficient
fund left for that prosecution, I shall not
at present throw away one farthing in unneces∣sary
expence, but insist upon being conveyed to
prison without farther delay.”</P>
<P>This declaration was equally unwelcome to
the bailiff, surgeon and sollicitor, who upon the
supposition that the count was a person of for∣tune,
and would rather part with an immense
sum, than incur the ignominy of a goal, or in∣volve
himself in another disgraceful law-suit, had
resolved to fleece him to the utmost of their
power. But, now the attorney finding him de∣termined
to set his fate at defiance, and to retort
upon him a prosecution which he had no mind
to undergo, began to repent heartily of the pro∣vocation
he had given, and to think seriously
on some method to overcome the obstinacy of
the incensed foreigner. With this view, while
the bailiff conducted him to bed, in another
apartment, he desired the catchpole to act the
part of mediator between him and the count,
and furnished him with proper instructions for
that purpose. Accordingly, the landlord on his
return, told Fathom that he was sure the solli∣citor
was not a man for this world; for that he
had left him deprived of his senses, and praying
to God with great devotion, for mercy to his
murderer: he then exhorted him with may pro∣testations
of friendship, to compromise the un∣happy
affair by exchanging releases with the at∣torney
before his delirium should be known,
otherwise he would bring himself into a most
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
dangerous premunire, whether the plaintiff should
die of his wound, or live to prosecute him for
the assault: “and with regard to your charge of
robbery against him, said he, as it is no more
than a bare suspicion, unsupported by the least
shadow of evidence, the bill would be thrown
out, and then he might sue you for damages. I
therefore, out of pure friendship and good na∣ture
advise you to compromise the affair, and if
you think proper, will endeavour to bring about
a mutual release.”</P>
<P>Our hero, whose passion was by this time
pretty well cooled, saw reason for assenting to
the proposal; upon which the deed was imme∣diately
executed, the mediator's bill was dis∣charged;
and Ferdinand conveyed in an hack∣ney
coach to prison, after he had impowered
his own landlord to discharge his servants, and
convert his effects into ready money. Thus, he
saw himself, in the course of a few hours, de∣prived
of his reputation, rank, liberty and friends;
and his fortune reduced from two thousand
pounds, to something less than two hundred,
fifty of which he had carried to goal in his
pocket.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our adventurer is made acquainted with a new
scene of life.</HEAD>
<P>JUST as he entered these mansions of misery,
his ears were invaded with an hoarse and
dreadful voice, exclaiming, “You, Bess Beetle,
score a couple of fresh eggs, a pennyworth of
butter, and half a pint of mountain to the king;
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
stop credit till the bill is paid; he is now debtor for
fifteen shillings and sixpence, and damn me if I
trust him one farthing more, if he was the best
king in Christendom: and d'ye hear, send ragg∣ed
head with five pounds of potatoes for major
Macleaver's supper, and let him have what drink
he wants; the fat widow gentlewoman from
Pimlico has promised to quit his score. Sir
Mungo Barebones may have some hasty pudding
and small beer, though I don't expect to see
his coin, no more than to receive the eighteen
pence I laid out for a pair of breeches to his
backside. What then? he's a quiet sort of a
body, and a great scholar, and it was a scandal
to the place, to see him going about in that
naked condition: as for the mad Frenchman
with the beard, if you give him so much as a
cheese-paring, you b—ch, I'll send you back to
the hole, among your old companions; an im∣pudent
dog! I'll teach him to draw his sword
upon the governor of an English county goal,
What! I suppose he thought he had to do with
a French hang-tang-dang, rabbit him! he shall
eat his white feather before I give him credit
for a morsel of bread.”</P>
<P>Although our adventurer was very little dis∣posed,
at this juncture, to make observations fo∣reign
to his own affairs, he could not help taking
notice of these extraordinary injunctions; espe∣cially
those concerning the person who was in∣titled
king, whom, however, he supposed to be
some prisoner elected as the magistrate by the
joint suffrage of his fellows. Having taken
possession of his chamber, which he rented at
five shillings a week, and being ill at ease in
his own thoughts, he forthwith secured his door,
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
undressed and went to bed, in which, though it
was none of the most elegant or inviting couches,
he enjoyed profound repose after the accumulated
fatigues and mortifications of the day. Next
morning after breakfast, the keeper entered his
apartment, and gave him to understand, that the
gentlemen under his care, having heard of the
count's arrival, had deputed one of their num∣ber
to wait upon him with the compliments of
condolance, suitable to the occasion, and invite
him to become a member of their society. Our
hero could not politely dispense with this instance
of civility, and their ambassador being instantly
introduced by the name of captain Minikin, saluted
him with great solemnity.</P>
<P>This was a person equally remarkable for his
extraordinary figure and address; his age seemed
to border upon forty, his stature amounted to
five feet, his visage was long, meagre and wea∣ther-beaten,
and his aspect, though not quite rue∣ful,
exhibited a certain formality, which was the
result of care and conscious importance. He was
very little encumbred with flesh and blood; yet,
what body he had, was well proportioned, his
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbs were elegantly turned, and by his carriage
he was well intitled to that compliment which
we pay to any person, when we say he has
very much the air of a gentleman. There was
also an evident singularity in his dress, which tho'
intended as an improvement, appeared to be an
extravagant exaggeration of the mode, and at
once evinced him an original to the discerning
eyes of our adventurer, who received him with
his usual complaisance, and made a very eloquent
acknowledgment of the honour and satisfaction
he received from the visit of the representative,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
and the hospitality of his constituents. The
captain's peculiarities were not confined to his
external appearance; for his voice resembled the
sound of a bassoon, or the aggregate hum of a
whole bee-hive, and his discourse was almost no∣thing
else than a series of quotations from the Eng∣lish
poets, interlarded with French phrases, which
he retained for their significance, on the recom∣mendation
of his friends, being himself unac∣quainted
with that or any other outlandish
tongue.</P>
<P>Fathom finding this gentleman of a very com∣municative
disposition, thought he could not
have a fairer opportunity of learning the history
of his fellow-prisoners; and turning the conver∣sation
on that subject, was not disappointed in
his expectation. “I don't doubt, Sir,” said he,
with the utmost solemnity of declamation, “but
you look with horror upon every object that sur∣rounds
you in this uncomfortable place; but ne∣vertheless
here are some, who, as my friendShake∣spear
has it, <HI>have seen better days, and have with
holy bell been knolled to church; and sat at good
men's feasts, and wiped their eyes of drops that sa∣cred
pity hath engendered.</HI> You must know, Sir,
that exclusive of the <HI>Canaille,</HI> or the <HI>profanum
Vulgus,</HI> as they are stiled by Horace, there are
several small communities in the goal, consisting
of people who are attracted by the manners and
dispositions of each other: for this place, Sir,
is quite a <HI>microcosm,</HI> and as the great world, so
is this a <HI>Stage, and all the men and women meerly
players.</HI> For my own part, Sir, I have always
made it a maxim to associate with the best com∣pany
I can find: not that I pretend to boast of
my family or extraction; because you know, as
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
the poet says, <HI>Vix ea nostra voco.</HI> My father,
'tis true, was a man that piqued himself upon
his pedigree, as well as upon his politesse and
personal merit; for he had been a very old offi∣cer
in the army, and I myself may say, I was
born with a spontoon in my hand. Sir, I have
had the honour to serve his majesty these twenty
years, and have been bandied about in the course
of duty, through all the British plantations, and
you see the recompence of all my service. But
this is a disagreeable subject, and therefore I shall
wave it: however, as Butler observes,</P>
<Q><L>“My only comfort is that now,</L>
<L>My dubbolt fortune is so low,</L>
<L>That either it must quickly end,</L>
<L>Or turn about again and mend.”</L></Q>
<P>And now to return from this digression, you
will perhaps be surprized to hear that the head
or chairman of our club is really a sovereign
prince. No less I'll assure you than the cele∣brated
Theodore king of C-rf-ca, who lies in
prison for a debt of a few hundred pounds. <HI>Heu!
quantum mutatus ab illo.</HI> It is not my business
to censure the conduct of my superiors: but I
always speak my mind in a cavalier manner,
and, as according to the Spectator, talking to a
friend is no more than thinking aloud, <HI>entre nous,</HI>
his Corfican majesty has been scurvily treated by
a certain administration: be that as it will, he
is a personage of a very portly appearance, and
is quite master of the <HI>beinseance.</HI> Besides, they
will find it their interest to have recourse again
to his alliance; and in that case, some of us may
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
expect to profit by his restoration: but few words
are best.</P>
<P>He that maintains the second rank in our as∣sembly,
is one major Macleaver, an Irish gentle∣man,
who has served abroad: a soldier of for∣tune,
Sir, a man of unquestionable honour and
courage; but a little over-bearing, in conse∣quence
of his knowledge and experience. He
is a person of a good address to be sure, and
quite free of the <HI>mauvaise honte;</HI> and he may
have seen a good deal of service; but what then?
other people may be as good as he, though they
have not had such opportunities: if he speaks
five or six languages, he does not pretend to any
taste in the liberal arts, which are the criterion
of an accomplished gentleman. The next is
Sir Mungo Barebones, the representative of a
very ancient family in the North; his affairs are
very much <HI>derangeé,</HI> but he is a gentleman of
great probity and learning, and at present engag'd
in a very grand scheme, which, if he can bring
it to bear, will render him famous to all poste∣rity:
no less than the conversion of the Jews and
the Gentiles. The project, I own, looks chi∣merical
to one who has not conversed with the
author; but, in my opinion, he has clearly de∣monstrated
from an anagrammatical analysis of a
certain Hebrew word, that his present majesty,
whom God preserve, is the person pointed at
in scripture, as the temporal Messiah of the Jews;
and if he could once raise by subscription, such a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
trifling sum as twelve hundred thousand pounds,
I make no doubt but he would accomplish his
aim, vast and romantic as it seems to be.</P>
<P>Besides these, we have another messmate,
who is a French chevalier, an odd sort of a man,
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
a kind of Lazarillo de Tormes, a Caricatura;
he wears a long beard, pretends to be a great
poet, and makes a damned <HI>Fracas</HI> with his
verses. The king has been obliged to exert his
authority over him more than once, by order∣ing
him into close confinement, for which he
was so rash as to send his majesty a challenge;
but, he afterwards made his submission and was
again taken into favour: the truth is, I believe
his brain is a little disordered, and he being a
stranger we overlook his extravagancies.</P>
<P>Sir, we shall think ourselves happy in your
accession to our society: you will be under no
sort of restraint: for though we dine at one
table, every individual calls and pays for his own
mess. Our conversation, such as it is, will not,
I hope be disagreeable; and though we have
not opportunities of breathing the pure Arca∣dian
air, and cannot “under the shade of me∣lancholy
boughs, lose and neglect the creeping
hours of time;” we may enjoy ourselves over
a glass of punch or a dish of tea: nor are we
destitute of friends who visit us in these shades
of distress. The major has a numerous ac∣quaintance
of both sexes, among others, a first
cousin of good fortune, who with her daughters
often chear our solitude; she is a very sensible
lady-like gentlewoman, and the young ladies
have a certain <HI>degagée</HI> air, that plainly shews they
have seen the best company: besides, I will ven∣ture
to recommend Mrs. Minikin, as a woman
of tolerable breeding and capacity, who I hope,
will not be found altogether deficient in the
accomplishments of the sex. So that we find
means to make little parties, in which the time
glides away insensibly. Then I have a small col∣lection
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
of books, which are at your service.
You may amuse yourself with Shakespear, or
Milton, or Don Quixote, or any of our modern
authors that are worth reading, such as the ad∣ventures
of Loveill, Lady Frail, George Ed∣wards,
Joe Thompson, Bampfylde More Ca∣rew,
Young Scarron, and Miss Betsy Thought∣less:
and if you have a taste for drawing, I can
entertain you with a parcel of prints by the best
masters.”</P>
<P>A man of our hero's politeness, could not
help expressing himself in the warmest terms of
gratitude for this courteous declaration. He
thanked the captain in particular for his obliging
offers, and begged he would be so good as to
present his respects to the society of which he
longed to be a member. It was determined
therefore, that Minikin should return in an
hour, when the count would be dressed, in order
to conduct him into the presence of his majesty;
and he had already taken his leave for the pre∣sent,
when all of a sudden he came back, and
taking hold of a waistcoat that lay upon a chair,
“Sir,” said he, “give me leave to look at that
fringe; I think it is the most elegant knitting
I ever saw: but pray Sir, are not these quite
out of fashion: I thought plain silk, such as
this that I wear, had been the mode; with the
pockets very low.” Before Fathom had time
to make any sort of reply, he took notice of
his hat and pumps; the first of which he said
was too narrow in the brims, and the last an
inch too low in the heels; indeed they formed
a remarkable contrast with his own: for, ex∣clusive
of the fashion of the cock, which resem∣bled
the form of a Roman galley, the brim of
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
his hat, if properly spread, would have projected
a shade sufficient to shelter a whole file of mus∣queteers
from the heat of a summer's sun; and
the heels of his shoes were so high as to raise
his feet three inches at least, from the surface of
the earth.</P>
<P>Having made these observations for the credit
of his taste, he retired, and returning at the
time appointed, accompanied Ferdinand to the
apartment of the king, at the door of which,
their ears were invaded with a strange sound, be∣ing
that of an human voice imitating the noise of a
drum. The captain hearing this alarm, made a
full stop, and giving the count to understand that
his majesty was busy, begged he would not take
it amiss, if the introduction should be delayed
for a few moments. Fathom curious to know
the meaning of what he had heard, applied to
his guide for information, and learned that the
king and the major, whom he had nominated to
the post of his general in chief, were employed
in landing troops upon the Genoese territory:
that is, that they were settling before-hand, the
manner of their disembarkation.</P>
<P>He then, by the direction of his conductor,
reconnoitred them through the key-hole, and
perceived the sovereign and his minister sitting
on opposite sides of a deal board table, covered
with a large chart or map, upon which he saw
a great number of muscle and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster-shells,
ranged in a certain order, and at a little distance,
several regular squares and columns made of
cards cut in small pieces. The prince himself,
whose eyes were reinforced by spectacles, sur∣veyed
this armament with great attention, while
the general put the whole in action, and con∣ducted
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
their motions by beat of drum. The
muscle-shells, according to Minikin's explanation,
represented the transports, the oyster-shells were
considered as the men of war that covered the
troops in landing, and the pieces of card exhi∣bited
the different bodies into which the army
was formed upon its disembarkation.</P>
<P>As an affair of such consequence could not
be transacted without opposition, they had pro∣vided
divers ambuscades, consisting of the enemy,
whom they represented by grey pease; and ac∣cordingly,
general Macleaver perceiving the said
grey pease marching along shore, to attack his
forces before they could be drawn up in battalia,
thus addressed himself to the oyster-shells in an
audible voice: “You men of war, don't you
see the front of the enemy advancing, and the
rest of the detachment following out of sight?
Arrah! the Devil burn you, why don't you
come ashore and open your batteries?” So say∣ing,
he pushed the shells towards the breach,
performed the cannonading with his voice, the
grey pease were soon put in confusion, the ge∣neral
was beat, the cards marched forwards
in order of battle, and the enemy having
retreated with great precipitation, they took
possession of their ground without farther dif∣culty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He contemplates majesty and its satellites in
eclipse.</HEAD>
<P>THIS expedition being happily finished, ge∣neral
Macleaver put the whole army,
navy, transports and scene of action into a can∣vas
bag, the prince unsaddled his nose, and cap∣tain
Minikin being admitted, our hero was
introduced in form. Very gracious was the re∣ception
he met with from his majesty, who with
a most princely demeanour, welcomed him to
court, and even seated him on his right hand,
in token of particular regard. True it is, this
presence-chamber was not so superb, nor the ap∣pearance
of the king so magnificent as to render
such an honour intoxicating to any person of our
hero's coolness and discretion: in lieu of tapes∣try
the apartment was hung with half-penny
ballads, a truckle-bed without curtains, supplied
the place of a canopy, and instead of a crown,
his majesty wore a woolen night-cap. Yet, in
spite of these disadvantages, there was an air of
dignity in his deportment, and a nice physiog∣nonist
would have perceived something majestic
in the features of his countenance.</P>
<P>He was certainly a personage of a very pre∣possessing
mien, his manners were engaging;
his conversation agreeable, and any man whose
heart was subject to the meltings of humanity,
would have deplored his distress, and looked
upon him as a most pathetic instance of that
miserable reverse, to which all human grandeur
is exposed. His fall was even greater than that
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
of Belisarius, who after having obtained many
glorious victories over the enemies of his coun∣try,
is said to have been reduced to such extre∣mity
of indigence, that in his old age, when he
was deprived of his eye-sight, he sat upon the
high-way like a common mendicant, imploring
the charity of passengers, in the piteous excla∣mation
of <HI>Date obolum Belisario;</HI> that is, “Spare
a farthing to your poor old soldier Belisarius.” I
say, this general's disgrace was not so remark∣able
as that of Theodore, because he was the
servant of Justinian, consequently his fortune
depended upon the nod of that emperor; whereas
the other actually possessed the throne of sove∣reignty
by the best of all titles, namely, the
unanimous election of the people over whom he
reigned; and attracted the eyes of all Europe,
by the efforts he made in breaking the bands of
oppression, and vindicating that liberty which is
the birthright of man.</P>
<P>The English of former days, alike renowned
for generosity and valour, treated those hostile
princes whose fate it was to wear their chains,
with such delicacy of benevolence, as even dis∣pelled
the horrors of captivity; but, their poste∣rity
of this refined age, feel no compunction at
seeing an unfortunate monarch, their former
friend, ally and partizan, languish amidst the
miseries of a loathsome gaol, for a paultry debt
contracted in their own service. But moralizing
apart, our hero had not long conversed with this
extraordinary debtor, who in his present condi∣tion,
assumed no other title than that of Baron,
than he perceived in him a spirit of Quixotism,
which all his experience, together with the vicis∣situdes
of his fortune, had not been able to over∣come,
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
not that his ideas soared to such a pitch
of extravagant hope as that which took possession
of his mess-mates, who frequently quarrelled
one with another, about the degrees of favour
to which they should be intitled after the king's
restoration; but he firmly believed that affairs
would speedily take such a turn in Italy, as
would point out to the English court, the expe∣diency
of employing him again; and this persua∣sion
seemed to support him against every species
of poverty and mortification.</P>
<P>While they were busy in trimming the balance
of power on the other side of the Alps, their
deliberations were interrupted by the arrival of a
scullion, who came to receive their orders touch∣ing
the bill of fare for dinner, and his majesty
sound much more difficulty in settling this im∣portant
concern, than in compromising all the
differences between the emperor and the queen
of Spain. At length, however, General Mac∣leaver
undertook the office of purveyor for his
prince; captain Minikin insisted upon treating
the count, and in a little time the table was co∣vered
with a cloth, which for the sake of my
delicate readers, I shall not attempt to de∣scribe.</P>
<P>At this period, they were joined by Sir Mungo
Barebones, who having found means to pur∣chase
a couple of mutton chops, had cooked a
mess of broth, which he now brought in a sauce∣pan
to the general rendezvous: this was the
most remarkable object which had hitherto pre∣sented
itself to the eyes of Fathom: being natu∣rally
of a meagre habit, he was by indigence
and hard study wore almost to the bone, and so
bended towards the earth, that in walking, his
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
body described at least 150 degrees of a circle.
The want of stockings and shoes he supplied
with a jockey straight boot and an half jack.
His thighs and middle were cased in a monstrous
pair of brown trunk breeches, which the keeper
bought for his use, from the executor of a Dutch
seamen who had lately died in the jail: his shirt
retained no signs of its original colour, his body
was shrouded in an old greasy tattered plaid night∣gown;
a blue and white handkerchief sur∣rounded
his head, and his looks betokened that
immense load of care, which he had voluntarily
incurred for the eternal salvation of sinners. Yet
this figure, uncouth as it was, made his com∣pliments
to our adventurer in terms of the most
elegant address, and in the course of conversa∣tion,
disclosed a great fund of valuable know∣ledge.
He had appeared in the great world,
and bore divers offices of dignity and trust, with
universal applause: his courage was undoubted,
his morals were unimpeached, and his person
held in great veneration and esteem; when his
evil genius engaged him in the study of Hebrew,
and the mysteries of the Jewish religion, which
fairly disordered his brain, and rendered him in∣capable
of managing his temporal affairs. When
he ought to have been employed in the functions
of his post, he was always rapt in visionary
conferences with Moses on the Mount; rather
than regulate the oeconomy of his houshold,
he chose to exert his endeavours in settling the pre∣cise
meaning of the word <HI>Elohim;</HI> and having dis∣covered
that now the period was come, when the
Jews and Gentiles would be converted, he post∣poned
every other consideration, in order to fa∣cilitate
that great and glorious event.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
By this time, Ferdinand had seen every
member of the club, except the French cheva∣lier,
who seemed to be quite neglected by the
society; for his name was not once mentioned
during this communication, and they sat down
to dinner, without asking whether he was dead
or alive. The king regaled himself with a plate
of ox-cheek; the major, who complained that
his appetite had forsaken him, amused himself
with some forty hard eggs, malaxed with salt but∣ter;
the knight indulged upon his soup and
bouillé, and the captain entertained our adven∣turer
with a neck of veal ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted, with potatoes;
but before Fathom could make use of his knife
and fork, he was summoned to the door, where
he found the chevalier in great agitation, his
eyes sparkling like coals of fire.</P>
<P>Our hero was not a little surprized at this
apparition, who having asked pardon for the
freedom he had used, observed, that understand∣ing
the count was a foreigner, he could not dis∣pense
with appealing to him, concerning an
outrage he had suffered from the keeper, who,
without any regard to his rank or misfortunes,
had been base enough to refuse him credit for a
few necessaries, until he could have a remittance
from his steward in France; he therefore con∣jured
count Fathom, as a stranger and noble∣man
like himself, to be the messenger of defi∣ance,
which he resolved to send to that brutal
gaoler, that for the future he might learn to
make proper distinctions in the exercise of his
function.</P>
<P>Fathom, who had no inclination to offend this
choleric Frenchman, assured him that he might
depend upon his friendship; and in the mean
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
time, prevaised upon him to accept of a small
supply, in consequence of which, he procured a
pound of sausages, and joined the rest of the
company without delay; making a very suitable
addition to such an assemblage of rarities. Tho'
his age did not exceed thirty years, his beard,
which was of a brindled hue, flowed down, like
Aaron's, to his middle: upon his legs he wore
red stockings rolled up over the joint of the knee,
his breeches were of blue drab with vellum
button-holes, and garters of gold lace, his waist∣coat
of scarlet, his coat of rusty black cloath,
his hair twisted into a ramellie, hung down to
his rump, of the colour of jet, and his hat was
adorned with a white feather.</P>
<P>This original had formed many ingenious
schemes to increase the glory and grandeur of
France, but was discouraged by cardinal Fleury,
who, in all appearance, jealous of his great ta∣lents,
not only rejected his projects, but even sent
him to prison, on pretence of being offended at
his impertinence. Perceiving that, like the
prophet, he had no honour in his own country,
he no sooner obtained his release, than he re∣tired
to England, where he was prompted by
his philanthropy, to propose an expedient to our
ministry, which would have saved a vast effu∣sion
of blood and treasure; this was an agree∣ment
between the queen of Hungary and the
late emperor, to decide their pretensions by a
single combat; in which case he offered him∣self
as the Bavarian champion; but in this en∣deavour
he also proved unsuccessful: then turn∣ing
his attention to the delights of poetry, he
became so enamoured of the muse, that he neg∣lected
every other consideration, and she as usual,
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
gradually conducted him to the author's never∣failing
goal; a place of rest appointed for all
those sinners, whom the profane love of poesy
hath led astray.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">One quarrel is compromised; and another decided
by unusual arms.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG other topics of conversation that
were discussed at this genial meeting, Sir
Mungo's scheme was brought upon the carpet,
by his majesty, who was graciously pleased to
ask how his subscription filled? To this interroga∣tion,
the knight answered, that he met with
great opposition from a spirit of levity and self∣conceit,
which seemed to prevail in this genera∣tion;
but, that no difficulties should discourage
him, from persevering in his duty; and he trust∣ed
in God, that in a very little time he should
be able to confute and overthrow the false phi∣losophy
of the moderns, and to restore the
writings of Moses to that pre-heminence and ve∣neration,
which is due to an inspired author.
He spoke of the immortal Newton with infinite
contempt, and undertook to extract from the
Pentateuch, a system of chronology, which
would ascertain the progress of time since the
fourth day of the creation to the present hour
with such exactness, that not one vibration of a
pendulum should be lost! nay, he affirmed that
the perfection of all arts and sciences might be
attained by studying those sacred memoirs; and
that he himself did not despair off earning from
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
them the art of transmuting baser metals into
gold.</P>
<P>The chevalier, though he did not pretend to
contradict these assertions, was too much attach∣ed
to his own religion to acquiesce in the knight's
project of converting the Jews and the Gentiles
to the protestant heresy, which, he said, God
Almighty would never suffer to triumph over the
interests of his own holy catholic church. This
objection produced abundance of altercation be∣tween
two very unequal disputants, and the
Frenchman fin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing himself puzzled by the learn∣ing
of his antagonist, had recourse to the <HI>Argu∣mentum
ad hominem,</HI> by laying his hand upon his
sword, and declaring that he was ready to lose
the last drop of his blood in opposition to such
a damnable scheme.</P>
<P>Sir Mungo, though in all appearance, reduced
to the last stage of animal existence, no sooner
heard this epithet applied to his plan, than his
eyes gleamed like lightning; he sprung from his
seat, with the agility of a grass-hopper, and
darting himself out at the door, like an arrow
from a bow, re-appeared in a moment with a
long rusty weapon, which might have been shewn
among a collection of rarities, as the sword of
Guy ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Warwick. This implement he
brandished over the chevalier's head, with the
dexterity of an old prize-fighter, exclaiming in
the French language, “Thou art a prophane
wretch marked out for the vengeance of Hea∣ven,
whose unworthy minister I am; and here
thou shalt fall by the sword of the Lord and of
Gideon.”</P>
<P>The chevalier, unterrified by this dreadful sa∣lutation,
desired he would accompany him to a
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
more convenient place; and the world might
have been deprived of one or both these knights-errant,
had not general Macleaver, at the desire
of his majesty, interposed, and sound means to
bring matters to an accommodation.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the society was visited by
the major's cousin and her daughters, who no
sooner appeared, than they were recognized by
our adventurer; and his acquaintance with them
renewed in such a manner as alarmed the deli∣cacy
of captain Minikin, who in the evening,
repaired to the count's apartment, and with a
very formal physiognomy, accosted him in these
words. “Sir, I beg pardon for this intrusion;
but, I come to consult you about an affair in
which my honour is concerned: and a soldier
without honour, you know is no better than a
body without a soul. I have always admired
that speech of Hotspur, in the first part of
Henry the fourth.</P>
<LG>
<L>“By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,</L>
<L>To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd
moon;</L>
<L>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</L>
<L>Wherefathom line could never touch the ground,</L>
<L>And pluck up drowned honour by the locks.—”</L>
</LG>
<P>There is a boldness and ease in the expression,
and the images are very pictoresque. But, with∣out
any further preamble; pray Sir, give me
leave to ask how long you have been acquainted
with those ladies, who drank tea with us this
afternoon? You'll forgive the question Sir,
when I tell you that major Macleaver intro∣duced
Mrs. Minikin to them, as to ladies of
character; and I don't know how Sir, I have a
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
sort of <HI>presentiment</HI> that my wife has been impos∣ed
upon. Perhaps I may be mistaken, and
God grant I may. But there was a <HI>je ne s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai quoy</HI>
in their behaviour to-day, which begins to alarm
my suspicion. Sir, I have nothing but my repu∣tation
to depend upon; and I hope you will ex∣cuse
me, when I earnestly beg to know what
rank they maintain in life.”</P>
<P>Fathom, without minding the consequence,
told him with a simper, that he knew them to
be very good-natured ladies, who devoted them∣selves
to the happiness of mankind. This ex∣planation
had no sooner escaped from his lips,
than the captain's face began to glow with in∣dignation,
his eyes seemed bursting from their
spheres, he swelled to twice his natural dimen∣sions,
and raising himself on his tiptoes, pro∣nounced
in a strain that emulated thunder.
“Blood! Sir, you seem to make very light of
the matter; but it is no joke to me, I'll assure
you: and Macleaver shall see that I am not to
be affronted with impunity. Sir, I shall take it
as a singular favour, if you will be the bearer of
a billet to him, which I shall write in three
words: nay, Sir, you must give me leave to
insist upon it, as you are the only gentleman of
our mess, whom I can intrust with an affair of
this nature.”</P>
<P>Fathom, rather than run the risque of disob∣liging
such a punctilious warrior, after having
in vain attempted to dissuade him from his pur∣pose,
undertook to carry the challenge, which
was immediately penned in these words.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This morçeau being sealed and directed, was
forthwith carried by our adventurer to the lodg∣ings
of the major, who had by this time, re∣tired
to rest, but hearing the count's voice, he got
up and opened the door in <HI>cuerpo,</HI> to the asto∣nishment
of Ferdinand, who had never before
seen such an Herculean figure. He made an
apology for receiving the count in his birth-day
suit, to which, he said, he was reduced by the
heat of his constitution, though he might have
assigned a more adequate cause, by owning that
his shirt was in the hands of his washerwoman;
then shrouding himself in a blanket, desired to
know what had procured him the honour of
such an extraordinary visit. He read the letter
with great composure, like a man accustomed to
such intercourse; then addressing himself to the
bearer, “I will be after diverting the gentleman,
said he, in any manner he shall think proper:
but by Jesus! this is no place for such amuse∣ments;
because, as you well know, my dear
count, if both should be killed by the chance of
war, neither of us will be able to escape, and
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
after the breath is out of his body, he will make
but a sorry excuse to his family and friends. But,
that is no concern of mine, and therefore I am
ready to please him in his own way.”</P>
<P>Fathom approved of his remarks, which he
reinforced with sundry considerations to the same
purpose, and begged the assistance of the major's
advice, in finding some expedient to terminate
the affair without bloodshed, that no trouble∣some
consequences might ensue either to him or
to his antagonist, who in spite of this over-strain∣ed
formality, seemed to be a person of worth
and good-nature. “With all my heart, said
the generous Hibernian, I have a great regard
for the little man, and my own character is not
to seek at this time of day. I have served a long
apprenticeship to fighting, as this same carcass
can testify, and if he compels me to run him
through the body, by my shoul I shall do it in
a friendly manner.”</P>
<P>So saying, he threw aside the blanket, and
displayed scars and seams innumerable upon his
body, which appeared like an old patched leathern
doublet. “I remember, proceeded this cham∣pion,
when I was a slave at Algiers, Murphy
Macmorris and I happened to have some diffe∣rence
in the bagnio; upon which he bad me
turn out. Arra, for what? said I, here
are no weapons that a gentleman can use, and
you would not be such a negro as to box like
an English carman. After he had puzzled him∣self
for some time, he proposed that we should
retire into a corner, and funk one another with
brimstone, 'till one of us should give out. Ac∣cordingly
we crammed half a dozen of tobacco∣pipes
with sulphur, and setting foot to foot, be∣gan
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
to smoke, and kept a constant fire, until
Macmorris dropped down; then I threw away
my pipe, and taking poor Murphy in my arms,
“What are you dead,” said I, “if you are dead,
speak.” “No by Jesus! cried he, I an't dead,
but I'm speechless.” So he owned, I had ob∣tained
the victory, and we were as good friends
as ever. Now if Mr. Minikin thinks proper to
put the affair upon the same issue, I will smoke
a pipe of brimstone with him to-morrow morn∣ing,
and if I cry out first, I will be after asking
pardon for this supposed affront.”</P>
<P>Fathom could not help laughing at the propo∣sal,
to which, however, he objected on account
of Minikin's delicate constitution, which might
suffer more detriment from breathing in an at∣mosphere
of sulphur, than from the discharge of
a pistol, or the thrust of a small sword. He
therefore suggested another expedient in lieu of
the sulphur, namely, the gum called <HI>Assa foetida,</HI>
which though abundantly nauseous, could have
no dangerous effect upon the infirm texture of
the lieutenant's lungs. This hint being relished
by the major, our adventurer returned to his
principal, and having repeated the other's argu∣ments
against the use of mortal instruments, de∣scribed
the succedaneum, which he had concerted
with Macleaver. The captain at first believed
this scheme was calculated for subjecting him to
the ridicule of his fellow-prisoners, and began
to storm with great violence; but by the assu∣rances
and address of Fathom, he was at length
reconciled to the plan, and preparations were
made on each side for this duel, which was actu∣ally
smoaked next day, about noon, in a small
closet, detached from the challenger's apartment,
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
and within hearing of his majesty and all his
court, assembled as witnesses and umpires of the
contest.</P>
<P>The combatants being locked up together,
began to ply their engines with great fury, and
it was not long before captain Minikin perceived
he had a manifest advantage over his antagonist.
For his organs were familiarized to the effluvia
of this drug, which he had frequently used in the
course of an hypochondriac disorder; whereas
Macleaver, who was a stranger to all sorts of me∣dicine,
by his wry faces and attempts to puke,
expressed the utmost abhorrence of the smell that
invaded his nostrils. Nevertheless, resolved to
hold out to the last extremity, he continued in
action, until the closet was filled with such an
intolerable vapour as discomposed the whole
oeconomy of his intrails, and compelled him to
disgorge his breakfast in the face of his opponent,
whose nerves were so disconcerted by this dis∣agreeable
and unforeseen discharge, that he fell
back into his chair in a swoon, and the major
bellowed aloud for assistance. The door being
opened, he ran directly to a window, to inhale
the fresh air, while the captain recovering from
his fit, complained of Macleaver's unfair pro∣ceedings,
and demanded justice of the arbitrators,
who decided in his favour; and the major being
prevailed upon to ask pardon for having intro∣duced
Mrs. Minikin to women of rotten repu∣tation,
the parties were reconciled to each other,
and peace and concord re-established in the mess.</P>
<P>Fathom acquired universal applause for his
discreet and humane conduct upon this occasion;
and that same afternoon had an opportunity of
seeing the lady in whose cause he had exerted
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
himself. He was presented to her as the husband's
particular friend, and when she understood how
much she was indebted to his care and concern
for the captain's safety, she treated him with
uncommon marks of distinction; and he found
her a genteel well-bred woman, not without a
good share of personal charms, and a well culti∣vated
understanding.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An unexpected rencounter, and an happy revolution
in the affairs of our adventurer.</HEAD>
<P>AS she did not lodge within the precincts of
this garrison, she was one day, after tea,
conducted to the gate by the captain and the
count, and just as they approached the turnkey's
lodge, our hero's eyes were struck with the ap∣parition
of his old companion Renaldo, son of
his benefactor and patron the count de Melvile.
What were the emotions of his soul, when he
saw that young gentleman enter the prison, and
advance towards him, after having spoke to the
gaoler! He never doubted that being informed
of his confinement, he was come to upbraid
him with his villainy and ingratitude, and he
in vain endeavoured to recollect himself from
that terror and guilty confusion which his ap∣pearance
had inspired; when the stranger lifting
up his eyes, started back with signs of extreme
amazement, and after a considerable pause, ex∣claimed,
“Heaven and earth! Sure my eyes do
not deceive me! is not your name Fathom? it is,
it must be my old friend and companion, the loss
of whom I have so long regreted!” With
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
these words, he ran towards our adventurer, and
while he clasped him in his arms, with all the
eagerness of affection, protested that this was
one of the happiest days he had ever seen.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, who from this salutation, con∣cluded
himself still in possession of Renaldo's
good opinion, was not deficient in expressions
of tenderness and joy; he returned his embraces
with equal ardour, the tears trickled down his
cheeks, and that perturbation which proceeded
from conscious perfidy and fear, was mistaken
by the unsuspecting Hungarian for the sheer ef∣fects
of love, gratitude and surprize. These
first transports having subsided, they adjourned
to the lodgings of Fathom, who soon recollected
his spirits and invention so well as to amuse the
other with a feigned tale of his having been taken
by the French, sent prisoner into Champaigne,
from whence he had written many letters to
count Melvile and his son, of whom he could
hear no tidings; of his having contracted an
intimacy with a young nobleman of France,
who died in the flower of his age, after having
in token of friendship, bequeathed to him a
considerable legacy; by this he had been ena∣bled
to visit the land of his forefathers in the
character of a gentleman, which he had sup∣ported
with some figure, until he was betrayed
into a misfortune that exhausted his funds, and
drove him to the spot where he was now found:
and he solemnly declared, that far from forget∣ing
the obligation he owed to count Melvile, or
renouncing the friendship of Renaldo, he had
actually resolved to set out for Germany on
his return to the house of his patron in the be∣ginning
of the week, posterior to that in which
he had been arrested.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>
Young Melvil, whose own heart had never
known the instigations of fraud, implicitely be∣lieved
the story and protestations of Fathom; and
tho' he would not justify that part of his conduct
by which the term of his good fortune was
abridged, he could not help excusing an indiscre∣tion
into which he had been hurried by the pre∣cipitancy
of youth, and the allurements of an art∣ful
woman: nay, with the utmost warmth of
friendship, he undertook to wait upon Trapwell,
and endeavour to soften him into some reasonable
terms of composition.</P>
<P>Fathom seemed to be quite overwhelmed with
a deep sense of all this goodness, and affected the
most eager impatience to know the particulars of
Renaldo's fate, since their unhappy separation,
more especially his errand to this uncomfortable
place which he should henceforth revere as the
providential scene of their reunion: nor did he
forget to enquire, in the most affectionate and
dutiful manner, about the situation of his noble
parents and amiable sister.</P>
<P>At mention of these names, Renaldo, fetching
a deep sigh, “Alas! my friend, (said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) the
Count is no more; and what aggravates my af∣fliction
for the loss of such a father, it was my
misfortune to be under his displeasure at the time
of his death. Had I been present on that melan∣choly
occasion. so well I knew his generosity and
paternal tenderness, that sure I am, he would in
his last moments have forgiven an only son whose
life had been a continual effort to render himself
worthy of such a parent, and whose crime was
no other than an honourable passion for the most
meritorious of her sex. But I was removed at a
fatal distance from him, and doubtless my conduct
<PB REF="51"/>
must have been invidiously misrepresented. Be
that as it will, my mother has again given her
hand in wedlock to Count Trevasi; by whom
I have the mortification to be informed that I am
totally excluded from my father's succession; and
I learn from other quarters, that my sister is bar∣barously
treated by this inhuman father-in-law.
Grant, Heaven, I may soon have an opportunity of
expostulating with the tyrant upon that subject.”</P>
<P>So saying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes
lightened with resentment. Then he thus pro∣ceeded.</P>
<P>“My coming hither to-day, was with a view
to visit a poor female relation, from whom I yes∣terday
received a letter describing her most deplo∣rable
situation, and solliciting my assistance: but
the turnkey affirms, that there is no such person
in the jail; and I was on my way to consult the
keeper, when I was agreeably surprised with the
sight of my dear Fathom.”</P>
<P>Our adventurer having wiped from his eyes the
tears which were produced by the news of his
worthy patron's death, desired to know the name
of that afflicted prisoner in whose behalf he inte∣rested
himself so much, and Renaldo produced the
letter, subscribed your unfortunate cousin Helen
Melvil. This pretended relation, after having ex∣plained
the degree of consanguinity which she and
the Count stood in to each other, and occasionally
mentioned some anecdotes of the family in Scot∣land,
gave him to understand, that she had married
a merchant of London, who, by repeated losses in
trade, had been reduced to indigence, and after∣wards
confined in prison, where he then lay a
breathless coarse, having left her in the utmost
extremity of wretchedness and want, with two
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
young children in the small-pox, and an incura∣ble
cancer in one of her own breasts. Indeed,
the picture she drew was so moving, and her ex∣pressions
so sensibly pathetic, that no person whose
heart was not altogether callous, could peruse it
without emotion. Renaldo had sent two guineas
by the messenger whom she had represented as a
trusty servant, whose fidelity had been proof a∣gainst
all the distress of her mistress: and he was
now arrived, in order to reinforce his bounty.</P>
<P>Fathom, in the consciousness of his own prac∣tices,
immediately comprehended the scheme of
this letter, and considently assured him, that no
such person resided in the prison, or in any other
place: and when his friend applied for informa∣tion
to the keeper, these assurances were con∣firmed;
and that stern janitor told him, he had
been imposed upon by a stale trick which was
often practised upon strangers, by a set of sharp∣ers,
who make it their business to pick up hints
of intelligence relating to private families, upon
which they build such superstructures of fraud and
imposition.</P>
<P>However piqued the young Hungarian might
be to find himself duped in this manner, he re∣joiced
at the occasion which had thrown Fathom
in his way; and, after having made him a tender
of his purse, took his leave, on purpose to wait
upon Trapwell, who was not quite so untractable
as an enraged cuckold commonly is; for, by this
time, he had accomplished the best part of his
aim, which was to be divorced from his wife,
and was fully convinced that the defendant was
no more than a needy adventurer, who in all pro∣bability
would be released by an act of parlia∣ment
for the benefit of insolvent debtors; in
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
which case, he (the plaintiff) would reap no
solid advantage from his imprisonment.</P>
<P>He therefore listened to the remonstrances of
the mediator, and after much canvassing agreed
to discharge the defendant in consideration of two
hundred pounds, which were immediately paid
by Count Melvil, who by this deduction was re∣duced
to somewhat less than thirty.</P>
<P>Nevertheless he chearfully beggared himself in
behalf of his friend, for whose release he forth∣with
obtained an order: and next day our adven∣turer
having bid a formal adieu to his fellows in
distress, and in particular to his majesty, for
whose restoration his prayers were preferred, he
quitted the jail, and accompanied his deliverer,
with all the outward marks of unutterable grati∣tude
and esteem.</P>
<P>Surely, if his heart had been made of <HI>penetra∣ble
stuff,</HI> it would have been touched by the cir∣cumstances
of this redemption: but, had not his
soul been invincible to all such attacks, these me∣moirs
would, possibly, never have seen the light.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Renaldo's lodgings, that
young gentleman honoured him with other proofs
of confidence and friendship, by giving him a cir∣cumstantial
detail of all the adventures in which
he had been engaged after Fathom's desertion
from the imperial camp. He told him, that
immediately after the war was finished, his father
had pressed him to a very advantageous match,
with which he would have complied, though his
heart was not at all concerned, had not he been
inflamed with the desire of seeing the world be∣fore
he could take any step towards a settlement
for life: that he had signfied his sentiments on
this head to the Count, who opposed them with
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
unusual obstinacy, as productive of a delay which
might be fatal to his proposal: for which reason
he had retired <HI>inc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ito</HI> from his family, and tra∣velled
thro' sundry states and countries in a dis∣guise
by which he eluded the inquiries of his pa∣rents.</P>
<P>That in the course of these peregrinations he
was captivated by the irresistible charms of a young
lady on whose heart he had the good fortune to
make a tender impression: that their mutual love
had subjected both to many dangers and difficul∣ties,
during which they suffered a cruel separa∣tion;
after the torments of which, he had hap∣pily
found her in England, where she now lived
entirely cut off from her native country and con∣nexions,
and destitute of every other resource but
his honour, love, and protection: and, finally,
that he was determined to combat his own de∣sires,
how violent soever they might be, until he
should have made some suitable provision for the
consequences of a stricter union with the mistress
of his soul, that he might not by a precipitate
marriage ruin the person whom he adored.</P>
<P>This end he proposed to attain, by an applica¦tion
to the court of Vienna, which, he did not
doubt, would have some regard to his own ser∣vice
and that of his father; and thither he re∣solved
to repair with the first opportunity, now
that he had found a friend with whom he could
intrust the inestimable jewel of his heart.</P>
<P>He likewise gave our hero to understand, that
he had been eight months in England, during
which he had lived in a frugal manner, that he
might not unnecessarily exhaust the money he had
been able to raise upon his own credit; that hi∣therto
he had been obliged to defer his departure
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
for Germany, on account of his attendance upon
the mother of his mistress, who was lately dead
of sorrow and chagrin; and that since he resided
in London, he had often heard of the celebrated
Count Fathom, tho' he never imagined that his
friend Ferdinand could be distinguished by that
appellation.</P>

<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Fathom justifies the proverb, “What's bred in the
bone will never come out of the flesh.”</HEAD>
<P>SOme circumstances of this conversation made
a deep impression upon the mind of our adven∣turer,
who nevertheless concealed his emotions
from the knowledge of his friend, and was next
day introduced to that hidden treasure of which
Renaldo had spoke with such rapture and adora∣tion.
It was not without reason he had expa∣tiated
upon the personal attractions of this young
lady, whom (for the present) we shall call Moni∣mia,
a name that implies her orphan situation.
When she entered the room, even Fathom,
whose eyes had been sated with beauty, was
struck dumb with admiration, and could scarce
recollect himself so far as to perform the cere∣mony
of his introduction.</P>
<P>She seemed to be about the age of eighteen:
her stature was tail; her motion graceful; a
knot of artificial flowers restrained the luxu∣riancy
of her fine black hair that flowed in shin∣ing
ringlets a-down her snowy neck. The con∣tour
of her face was oval; her forehead remark∣ably
high; her complexion clean and delicate,
tho' not florid; and her eyes were so piercing as
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
to strike the soul of every beholder: yet, upon
this occasion, one half of their vivacity was eclip∣sed
by a languishing air of melancholy concern;
which, while it in a manner sheathed the edge
of her beauty, added a most engaging sweetness
to her looks: in short, every feature was elegant∣ly
perfect; and the harmony of the whole ravish∣ing
and delightful.</P>
<P>It was easy to perceive the mutual sentiments
of the two lovers, at meeting, by the pleasure
that sensibly diffused itself in the countenances
of both. Fathom was received by her as the in∣timate
friend of her admirer, whom she had often
heard of in terms of the most sincere affection;
and the conversation was carried on in the Italian
language, because she was a foreigner who had
not as yet made great proficiency in the know∣ledge
of the English tongue. Her understanding
was such, as, instead of diminishing, reinforced
the prepossession which was inspired by her ap∣pearance;
and if the sum total of her charms
could not melt the heart, it at least excited the
appetite of Fathom to such a degree, that he
gazed upon her with such violence of desire, as
had never transported him before; and instant∣ly
began to harbour thoughts not only destructive
to the peace of his generous patron, but also to
the prudential maxims he had adopted on his first
entrance into life.</P>
<P>We have already recorded divers instances of
his conduct, to prove that there was an intempe∣rance
in his blood, which often interfered with
his caution: and although he had found means to
render this heat sometimes subservient to his in∣terest;
yet, in all probability, Heaven mingled
the ingredient in his constitution, on purpose to
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
counteract his consummate craft, defeat the vil∣lany
of his intention, and, at last, expose him to
the justice of the law, and the contempt of his
fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Stimulated as he was by the beauty of the in∣comparable
Monimia, he foresaw that the con∣quest
of her heart would cost him a thousand
times more labour and address than all the victo∣ries
he had ever atchieved: for, besides her supe∣rior
understanding, her sentiments of honour,
virtue, gratitude, religion, and pride of birth,
her heart was already engaged by the tenderest
ties of love and obligation, to a man whose per∣son
and acquired accomplishments at least equalled
his own; and whose connexion with him was of
such a nature, as raised an almost insurmountable
bar to his design: because, with what face could
he commence rival to the person whose family
had raised him from want and servility, and whose
own generosity had rescued him from the miseries
of a dreary jail?</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these reflections, he would not
lay aside an idea which so agreeably flattered his
imagination. He, like every other projector in
the same circumstances, was so partial to his own
qualifications, as to think the lady would soon per∣ceive
a difference between him and Renaldo that
could not fail to turn to his advantage in her opi∣nion.
He depended a good deal on the levity and
inconstancy of the sex; and did not doubt, that,
in the course of their acquaintance, he should
profit by that languor which often creeps upon
and flattens the intercourse of lovers cloyed with
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and conversation of each other.</P>
<P>This way of arguing was very natural to a
man who had never known other motives than
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
those of sensuality and convenience; and perhaps,
upon these maxims, he might have succeeded with
nine tenths of the fair sex: but, for once, he
erred in his calculation. Monimia's soul was
perfect: her virtue impregnable. His first ap∣proaches
were, as usual, performed by the me∣thod
of insinuation, which succeeded so well, that
in a few days, he actually acquired a very distin∣guished
share of her favour and esteem: to this
he had been recommended in the warmest strain
of exaggerating friendship, by her dear Renaldo;
so that placing the most unreserved confidence
in his honour and integrity, and being almost
quite destitute of acquaintance, she made no
seruple of owning herself pleased with his com∣pany
and conversation; and therefore he was
never abridg'd in point of opportunity. She had
too much discernment to overlook his uncommon
talents and agreeable address, and too much sus∣ceptibility
to observe them with indifference. She
not only regarded him as the confident of her
lover, but admired him as a person whose attach∣ment
did honour to Count Melvil's choice: she
found his discourse remarkably entertaining, his
politeness dignified with an air of uncommon sin∣cerity;
and she was ravished with his skill in mu∣sick,
an art of which she was deeply enamoured.</P>
<P>While he thus ingratiated himself with the fair
Monimia, Renaldo rejoiced at their intimacy,
being extremely happy in the thought of having
found a friend who could amuse and protect the
dear creature in his absence. That she might be the
better prepared for the temporary separation which
he meditated, he began to be less frequent in his
visits, or rather to interrupt by gradual intermis∣sions
the constant attendance he had bestowed upon
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
her since her mother's death. This alteration she
was enabled to bear by the assiduities of Fathom,
when she understood that her lover was indispen∣sibly
employed in negotiating a sum of money for
the purposes of his intended voyage. This was
really the case: for, as the reader hath been al∣ready
informed, the provision he had made for
that emergency was expeded in behalf of our ad∣venturer;
and the persons of whom he had bor∣rowed
it, far from approving of the use to which
it was put, and accommodating him with a fresh
supply, reproached him with his benevolence as
an act of dishonesty to them, and, instead of fa∣vouring
this second application, threatened to dis∣tress
him for what he had already received.
While he endeavoured to surmount these diffi∣culties,
his small reversion was quite exhausted,
and he saw himself on the brink of wanting the
common necessaries of life.</P>
<P>There was no difficulty which he could not
have encountered with fortitude, had he alone
been concerned: but his affection and regard for
Monimia were of such a delicate nature, that, far
from being able to bear the prospect of her want∣ing
the least convenience, he could not endure
that she should suspect her situation cost him
a moment's perplexity; because he foresaw it
would wring her gentle heart with unspeakable
anguish and vexation. This therefore he endea∣voured
to anticipate by expressions of confidence
in the emperor's equity, and frequent declara∣tions
touching the goodness and security of that
credit from which he derived his present sub∣sistence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Anecdotes of poverty, and experiments for the benefit
of those whom it may concern.</HEAD>
<P>HIS affairs being thus circumstanced, it is
not to be supposed that he passed his time
in tranquillity. Every day ushered in new de∣mands
and fresh anxiety: for, though his oeco∣nomy
was frugal, it could not be supported with∣out
money; and now not only his funds were
drained, but also his private friends tired of re∣lieving
his domestic necessities: nay, they began
to relinquish his company, which formerly they
had coveted; and those who still favoured him
with their company, embittered that favour with
disagreeable advice mingled with impertinent re∣proof.
They loudly exclaimed against the last
instance of his friendship for Fathom as a piece
of wrong-headed extravagance, which neither his
fortune could afford, nor his conscience excuse;
and alledged, that such specimens of generosity
are vicious in any man, let his finances be never
so opulent, if he has any relations of his own
who need his assistance; but altogether scandalous,
not to say unjust, in a person who depends for
his own support upon the favour of his friends.</P>
<P>These expostulations did not even respect the
beauteous, the accomplished, the gentle-hearted,
the orphan Monimia. Although they owned her
perfections, and did not deny that it would be
highly meritorious in any man of fortune to make
her happy, they disapproved of Renaldo's attach∣ment
to the fair beggar, made light of that inti∣mate
union of hearts which subsisted between the
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
two lovers, and which no human consideration
could dissolve; and some among them, in the
consummation of their prudence, ventured to hint
a proposal of providing for her in the service of
some lady of fashion.</P>
<P>Any reader of sensibility will easily conceive
how these admonitions were relished by a young
gentleman whose pride was indomitable, whose
notions of honour were scrupulously rigid and ro∣mantic,
whose temper was warm, and whose
love was intense. Every such suggestion was as
a dagger to his soul; and what rendered the ror∣ture
more exquisite, he lay under obligations to
those very persons, whose selfish and fordid senti∣ments
he disdained: so that he was restricted by
gratitude from giving vent to his indignation; and
his forlorn circumstances would not permit him
to renounce their acquaintance. While he strug∣gled
with these mortifications, his wants grew
more and importunate, and his creditors became
clamorous.</P>
<P>Fathom, to whom all his grievances were dis∣closed,
lamented his hard hap with all the demon∣strations
of sympathy which he could expect to
find in such a zealous adherent; he upbraided him∣self
incessantly as the cause of his patron's distress;
took God to witness, that he would rather have
perished in jail, than have enjoyed his liberty, had
he known it would have cost his dearest friend
and benefactor one tenth part of the anguish he
now saw him suffer; and in conclusion, the fer∣vency
of his affection glowed to such a degree,
that he offered to beg, steal, or plunder on the
high way, for Renaldo's assistance.</P>
<P>Certain it is, he might have recollected a less
disagreeable expedient than any of these, to alle∣viate
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
the pangs of this unhappy lover: for, at that
very period, he was possessed of money and move∣ables
to the amount of a much greater sum than that
which was necessary to remove the severest pangs
of the Count's misfortune. But, whether he did
not reflect upon this resource, or was willing to
let Melvil be better acquainted with adversity,
which is the great school of life, I shall leave
the reader to determine: yet, so far was he from
supplying the wants of the young Hungarian,
that he did not scruple to receive a share of the
miserable pittance which that gentleman made
shift to extort from the complaisance of a few
companions, whose countenance he still enjoyed.</P>
<P>Renaldo's life was now become a sacrifice to
the most poignant distress: almost his whole time
was engrossed by a double scheme comprehending
his efforts to render his departure practicable, and
his expedients for raising the means of daily bread.
With regard to the first, he exerted himself among
a set of merchants, some of whom knew his fa∣mily
and expectations; and, for the last, he was
fain to depend upon the assistance of a few inti∣mates,
who were not in condition to furnish him
with sums of consequence. These, however,
gradually dropped off, on pretence of friendly re∣sentment
for his indiscreet conduct; so that he
found himself naked and deserted by all his former
companions, except one gentleman, with whom
he had lived in the most unreserved correspondence,
as with a person of the warmest friendship, and
the most unbounded benevolence: nay, he had
actually experienced repeated proofs of his gene∣rosity;
and such were the Count's sentiments of
the gratitude, love and esteem which were due
to the author of these obligations, that he would
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
have willingly laid down his own life for his in∣terest
or advantage. He had already been at dif∣ferent
times accommodated by this benefactor,
with occasional supplies, amounting in the whole
to about forty or fifty pounds; and so fearful was
he of taking any step by which he might forfeit
the good-will of this gentleman, that he struggled
with unparalelled difficulty and vexation, before
he could prevail upon himself to put his liberality
to another proof.</P>
<P>What maxims of delicacy will not the dire
calls of necessity infringe! Reduced to the al∣ternative
of applying once more to that benefi∣cence
which had never failed him, or of seeing
Monimia starve, he chose the first, as of two evils
the least, and intrusted Fathom with a letter ex∣plaining
the bitterness of his case. It was not
without trepidation that he received in the even∣ing,
from his messenger, an answer to this billet:
but what were his pangs when he learned the
contents? The gentleman, after having professed
himself Melvil's sincere well-wisher, gave him to
understand, that he was resolved for the future to
detach himself from every correspondence which
would be inconvenient for him to maintain; that
he considered his intimacy with the Count in that
light: yet, nevertheless, if his distress was really
as great as he had-described it, he would still con∣tribute
something towards his relief; and accord∣ingly
had sent by the bearer five guineas for that
purpose: but desired him to take notice, that, in
so doing, he laid himself under some difficulty.</P>
<P>Renaldo's grief and mortification at this disap∣pointment
were unspeakable: he now saw demo∣lished
the last screen betwixt him and the extre∣mity
of indigence and woe; he beheld the mistress
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
of his soul abandoned to the bleakest scenes of
poverty and want; and he deeply resented the
lofty strain of the letter, by which he conceived
himself treated as a worthless spendthrift, and im∣portunate
beggar. Tho' his purse was exhausted
to the last shilling; tho' he was surrounded with
necessities and demands, and knew not how to
provide another meal for his fair dependant, he,
in opposition to all the suggestions and eloquence
of Fathom, dispatched him with the money and
another billet, intimating in the most respectful
terms, that he approved of his friend's new
adopted maxim, which, for the future, he should
always take care to remember; and that he had
sent back the last instance of his bounty, as a proof
how little he was disposed to incommode his be∣nefactor.</P>
<P>This letter, tho' sincerely meant, and written
in a very serious mood, the gentleman considered
as an ungrateful piece of irony, and in that opi∣nion
complained to several persons of the Count's
acquaintance, who unanimously exclaimed against
him, as a sordid, unthankful, and profligate knave
that abused and reviled those very people who had
generously befriended him, whenever they found
it inconvenient to nourish his extravagance with
further supplies. Notwithstanding these accumu∣lated
oppressions, he still persevered with fortitude
in his endeavours to disentangle himself from this
maze of misery. To these he was encouraged
by a letter which about this time he received from
his sister, importing, that she had good reason to
believe the real will of her father had been sup∣pressed
for certain finister views; and desiring
him to hasten his departure for Hungary, where
he would still find some friends who were both
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
able and willing to support his cause. He had
some trinkets left; the pawn-broker's shop was
still open; and hitherto he made shift to conceal
from Monimia the extent of his affiiction.</P>
<P>The money-broker whom he employed, after
having amused him with a variety of schemes,
which served no other purpose than that of pro∣tracting
his own job, at length undertook to make
him acquainted with a set of monied men who
had been very adventurous in lending sums
upon personal security; he was therefore in∣troduced
to their club, in the most favourable
manner, after the broker had endeavoured to pre∣possess
them separately, with magnificent ideas of
his family and fortune. By means of this antici∣pation,
he was received with a manifest relaxation
of that severity, which people of this class mingle
in their aspects to the world in general; and they
even vied with each other in their demonstrations
of hospitality and respect; for every one in parti∣cular
looked upon him as a young heir, who would
bleed freely, and mortgage at cent, per cent.</P>
<P>Renaldo, buoyed up with these exterior civi∣lities,
began to flatter himself with hopes of suc∣cess,
which, however, were soon checked by the
nature of the conversation; during which the
chair-man upbraided one of the members in open
club, for having once lent forty pounds upon
slight security: the person accused alledged in his
own defence, that the borrower was his own
kinsman, whose funds he knew to be sufficient;
that he had granted his bond, and been at the
expence of insuring his life for the money; and,
in conclusion, had discharged it to the day with
great punctuality. These allegations were not
deemed exculpatory by the rest of the assembly,
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
who with one voice pronounced him guilty of un∣warrantable
rashness and indiscretion, which, in
time coming, must undoubtedly operate to the
prejudice of his character and credit.</P>
<P>This was a bitter declaration to the young
Count, who, nevertheless, endeavoured to im∣prove
the footing he had gained among them,
by courting their company, conforming to their
manners, and attentively listening to their dis∣course.
When he had cultivated them with
great assiduity, for the space of some weeks, dined
at their houses upon pressing invitations, and re∣ceived
repeated offers of service and friendship,
believing that things were now ripe for the pur∣pose,
he one day, at a tavern to which he had
invited him to dinner, ventured to disclose his
situation to him, whose countenance was the least
unpromising; and as he introduced the business
with a proposal of borrowing money, he per∣ceived
his eyes sparkle with a visible alacrity,
from which he drew an happy presage. But, alas!
this was no more than a transient gleam of sun∣shine,
which was suddenly obumbrated by the se∣quel
of his explanation; insomuch, that, when
the merchant understood the nature of the secu∣rity,
his visage was involved in a most disagree∣able
gloom, and his eyes distorted into a most hi∣deous
obliquity of vision: indeed, he squinted so
horribly, that Renaldo was amazed and almost
affrighted at his looks, until he perceived that
this distortion proceeded from concern for a silver
tobacco-box which he had laid down by him on
the table, after having filled his pipe: as the youth
proceeded to unfold his necessities, the other be∣came
gradually alarmed for this utensil, to which
he darted his eyes askance in this praeternatural
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
direction, until he had slily secured it in his
pocket.</P>
<P>Having made this successful conveyance, he
shifted his eyes alternately from the young gen∣tleman
to the broker, for a considerable pause,
during which he in silence reproached the last for
introducing such a beggarly varlet to his acquaint∣ance;
then taking the pipe from his mouth,
“Sir, (said he, addressing himself to the Count)
if I had all the inclination in the world to com∣ply
with your proposal, it is really not in my
power: my correspondents abroad have remitted
such a number of bad bills of late, that all my
running cash hath been exhausted in supporting
their credit. Mr. Ferret, sure I am, you was not
ignorant of my situation; and I'm not a little sur∣prized,
that you should bring the gentleman to
me, on business of this kind: but, as the Wise
Man observes, <HI>Bray a fool in a mortar, and he'll
never be wise.</HI>” So saying, with a most emphatic
glance directed to the broker, he rung the bell,
and called for the reckoning; when, finding that
he was to be the guest of Renaldo, he thanked
him drily for his good chear, and in an abrupt
manner took himself away.</P>
<P>Tho' baffled in this quarter, the young gen∣tleman
would not despair; but forthwith em∣ployed
Mr. Ferret in an application to another
of the society; who, after having heard the terms
of his commission, desired him to tell his princi∣pal,
that he could do nothing, without the con∣currence
of his partner, who happened to be at
that time in one of our American plantations: a
third being sollicited, excused himself on account
of an oath which he had lately taken, on the back
of a considerable loss: a fourth being tried, made
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
answer, that it was not in his way: and a fifth
candidly owned, that he never lent money with∣out
proper security.</P>
<P>Thus the sorlorn Renaldo tried every experi∣ment
without success, and now saw the last ray
of hope extinguished. Well nigh destitute of
present support, and encompassed with unrelent∣ing
duns, he was obliged to keep within doors,
and seek some comfort in the conversation of his
charming mistress, and his faithful friend: yet,
even there, he experienced the extremest rigour
of adverse fate. Every rap at the door alarmed
him with the expectation of some noisy tradesman
demanding payment, when he endeavoured to a∣muse
himself with drawing, some unlucky feature
of the occasional portrait, recalled the image of
an obdurate creditor, and made him tremble at
the work of his own hands. When he fled for
shelter to the flattering creation of fancy, some
abhorred idea always started up amidst the gay
vision, and dissolved the pleasing enchantment.
Even the seraphic voice of Monimia had no longer
power to compose the anxious tumults of his mind:
every song she warbled, every tune she played,
recalled to his remembrance some scene of love
and happiness elapsed; and overwhelmed his soul
with the woful comparison of past and present
fate. He saw all that was amiable and perfect in
woman, all that he held most dear and sacred
upon earth, tottering on the brink of misery,
without knowing the danger of her situation, and
found himself unable to prevent her fall, or even
to forewarn her of the peril: for, as we have al∣ready
observed, his soul could not brook the
thought of communicating the tidings of distress
to the tender-hearted Monimia.</P>

<P>SUch aggravated misfortune could not fail to

he could unperceived give a loose to the transports
of his sorrow, and in silence meditate some means
to lighten the burden of his woe. His heart was
sometimes so savaged with despair, which repre∣sented
mankind as his inveterate enemies, that he
entertained thoughts of denouncing war against
the whole community, and supplying his own
wants with the spoils he should win: at other
times, he was tempted with the desire of putting
an end to his miseries and life together: yet these
were but the transitory suggestions of temporary
madness, that soon yielded to the dictates of rea∣son.
From the execution of the first, he was
restrained by his own notions of honour and mo∣rality;
and from using the other expedient, he was
deterred by his love for Monimia, together with
the motives of philosophy and religion.</P>
<P>While in this manner he secretly nursed the
worm of grief that preyed upon his vitals, the
alteration in his countenance and conduct did not
escape the eye of that discerning young lady. She
was alarmed at the change, yet afraid to inquire
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
into the source of it; for, being ignorant of his
distress, she could impute it to no cause in which
her happiness was not deeply interested. She had
observed his strained complaisance, and extraor∣dinary
emotion: she had detected him in repeated
attempts to avoid her company, and taken notice
of his regular excursions in the dark. These were
alarming symptoms to a lover of her delicacy and
pride: she strove in vain to put the most favour∣able
construction on what she saw; and finally,
imputed the effects of his despondence to the alie∣nation
of his heart. Made miserable beyond ex∣pression
by these suspicions, she imparted them
to Fathom, who by this time was in full possession
of her confidence and esteem, and implored his
advice touching her conduct in such a nice con∣juncture.</P>
<P>This artful politician, who rejoiced at the ef∣fect
of her penetration, no sooner heard himself
questioned on the subject, than he gave tokens of
surprize and confusion, signifying his concern to
find she had discovered what (for the honour of his
friend) he wished had never come to light. His
behaviour on this occasion confirmed her fatal
conjecture; and she conjured him in the most pa∣thetic
manner, to tell her if he thought Renaldo's
heart had contracted any new engagement. At
this question, he started with signs of extreme a∣gitation,
and stifling an artificial sigh, “Sure,
madam, said he, you cannot doubt the Count's
constancy—I am confident—he is certainly—
I protest, madam, I am so shocked”—</P>
<P>Here he made a full pause, as if the conflict
between his integrity and his friendship would not
allow him to proceed, and summoned the moisture
into either eye—“Then are my doubts
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
removed, cried the afflicted Monimia: I see your
candour in the midst of your attachment to Re∣naldo;
and will no longer torment you with im∣pertinent
interrogations and vain complaints.”
With these words, a flood of tears gushed from
her enchanting eyes, and she instantly withdrew
into her own apartment, where she indulged her
sorrow to excess. Nor was her grief unanimated
with resentment. She was by birth, nature and
education inspired with that dignity of pride which
ennobles the human heart; and this, by the cir∣cumstance
of her present dependence, was ren∣dered
extremely jealous and susceptible: insomuch
that she could not brook the least shadow of in∣difference,
much less an injury of such a nature,
from the man whom she had honoured with her
affections, and for whom she had disobliged and
deserted her family and friends.</P>
<P>Though her love was so unalterably fixed on
this unhappy youth, that, without the continua∣tion
of reciprocal regard, her life would have be∣come
an unsupportable burden, even amidst all
the splendour of affluence and pomp; and altho'
she foresaw, that when his protection should cease,
she must be left a wretched orphan in a foreign
land, exposed to all the miseries of want: yet,
such was the loftiness of her displeasure, that she
disdained to complain, or even demand an ex∣planation
from the supposed author of her wrongs.</P>
<P>While she continued undetermined in her pur∣pose,
and fluctuating on this sea of torture, Fa∣thom,
believing that now was the season for
working upon her passions, while they were all in
commotion, became, if possible, more assiduous
than ever about the fair mourner, modelled his
features into a melancholy cast, pretended to share
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
her distress with the most emphatic sympathy,
and endeavoured to keep her resentment glowing
by cunning insinuations, which, tho' apparently
designed to apologize for his friend, served only
to aggravate the guilt of his perfidy and dishonour.
This pretext of friendly concern, is the most ef∣fectual
vehicle for the conveyance of malice and
slander; and a man's reputation is never so mor∣tally
stabbed, as when the assassin begins with
the preamble of, “For my own part, I can
safely say, that no man upon earth has a greater
regard for him than I have; and it is with the
utmost anguish and concern that I see him mis∣behave
in such a manner.” Then he proceeds
to mangle his character, and the good-natured
hearers concluding he is even blacker than he
is represented, on the supposition that the most
attrocious circumstances are softened or suppressed
by the tenderness or friendship of the accuser, ex∣claim,
“Good lack! what a wretch he must be,
when his best friends will no longer attempt to
defend him!” Nay, sometimes these well-wishers
undertake his defence, and treacherously betray
the cause they have espoused, by omitting the
reasons that may be urged in his vindication.</P>
<P>Both these methods were practised by the wily
Ferdinand, according to the predominant passion
of Monimia: when her indignation prevailed, he
expatiated upon his love and sincere regard for
Renaldo, which, he said, had grown up from the
cradle, to such a degree of fervour, that he would
willingly part with life for his advantage. He
shed tears for his apostacy; but every drop made
an indelible stain upon his character; and, in the
bitterness of his grief, swore, notwithstanding his
fondness for Renaldo, which had become a part
<PB REF="73"/>
of his constitution, that the young Hungarian de∣served
the most infamous destiny, for having in∣jured
such perfection. At other times, when he
found her melted into silent sorrow, he affected to
excuse the conduct of his friend. He informed
her, that the young gentleman's temper had been
uneven from his infancy; that frailty was natural
to man; that he might in time be reclaimed by
self-conviction; he even hinted, that she might
have probably ascribed to inconstancy, what was
really the effect of some chagrin which he indu∣striously
concealed from his participation: but,
when he found her disposed to listen to this last
suggestion, he destroyed the force of it, by recol∣lecting
the circumstances of his nocturnal rambles,
which, he owned, would admit of no favourable
construction.</P>
<P>By these means he blew the coals of her
jealousy, and inhanced the value of his own cha∣racter,
at the same time; for she looked upon
him as a mirror of faith and integrity, and the
mind being overcharged with woe, naturally seeks
some confident, upon whose sympathy it can re∣pose<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
itself: indeed, his great aim was, to make
himself necessary to her affliction, and settle a
gossiping correspondence, in the familiarity of
which he hoped his purpose would certainly be
answered.</P>
<P>Yet the exertion of these talents was not li∣mited
to her alone. While he laid these trains
for the hapless young lady, he was preparing
snares of another kind for her unsuspecting lover,
who (for the completion of his misery) about this
time began to perceive marks of disquiet and dis∣pleasure
in the countenance and deportment of
his adored Monimia: for, that young lady, in the
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
midst of her grief, remembered her origin, and
over her vexation affected to throw a veil of
tranquillity, which served only to give an air of
disgust to her internal disturbance.</P>
<P>Renaldo, whose patience and philosophy were
barely sufficient to bear the load of his other
evils, would have been quite overwhelmed with
the additional burthen of Monimia's woe, if it
had not assumed this appearance of disesteem,
which, as he knew he had not deserved it,
brought his resentment to his assistance: Yet
this was but a wretched cordial to support him
against the baleful reflections that assaulted him
from every quarter; it operated like those desperate
remedies, which while they stimulate exhausted
nature, help to destroy the very fundamentals of
the constitution. He reviewed his own conduct
with the utmost severity, and could not recol∣lect
one circumstance which could justly of∣fend
the idol of his soul. The more blameless
he appeared to himself in this examination, the
less excusable did her behaviour appear: He
tasked his penetration to discover the cause of this
alteration; he burned with impatience to know
it; his discernment failed him, and he was a∣fraid
(tho' he knew not why) to demand an ex∣planation.
His thoughts were so circumstanced,
that he durst not even unbosom himself to Fa∣thom,
tho' his own virtue and friendship resisted
those sentiments that began to intrude upon his
mind, with suggestions to the prejudice of our
adventurer's fidelity.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, unable to endure the torments
of such interesting suspense, he, at length, made
an effort to expostulate with the fair orphan; and
in an abrupt address, the effect of his fear and
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
confusion, begged to know if he had inadvert∣ently
done any thing to incur her displeasure.
Monimia hearing herself bluntly accosted in this
unusual strain, after repeated instances of his re∣serve
and supposed inconstancy, considered the
question as a fresh insult, and summoning her
whole pride to her assistance, replied with af∣fected
tranquillity, or rather with an air of scorn,
that she had no title to judge, neither did she
pretend to condemn his conduct. This answer,
so wide of that tenderness and concern which
had hitherto manifested itself in the disposition
of his amiable mistress, deprived him of all power
to carry on the conversation, and he retired
with a low bow, fully convinced of his having
irretrievably lost the place he had possessed in
her affection; for, to his imagination, warped
and blinded by his misfortunes, her demeanour
seemed fraught, not with a transient gleam of
anger, which a respectful lover would soon have
appeased, but with that contempt and indiffer∣ence
which denote a total absence of affection
and esteem. She, on the other hand, miscon∣strued
his sudden retreat; and now they beheld
the actions of each other thro' the false medium
of prejudice and resentment. To such fatal mis∣understandings,
the peace and happiness of whole
families often fall a sacrifice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our adventurer becomes absolute in his power over
the passions of his friend; and effects one half
of his aim.</HEAD>
<P>INfluenced by this dire mistake, the breasts of
those unhappy lovers began to be invaded
with the horrors of jealousy: the tender-hearted
Monimia endeavoured to devour her griess in si∣lence;
she in secret bemoaned her forlorn fate,
without ceasing; her tears flowed without inter∣mission
from night to morn, and from morn to
night: She sought not to know the object for
which she was forsaken; she meant not to up∣braid
her undoer; her aim was to find a seques∣tered
corner, in which she could indulge her
sorrow; where she could brood over the melan∣choly
remembrance of her former selicity, where
she could recollect those happy scenes she had
enjoyed under the wings of her indulgent pa∣rents,
when her whole life was a revolution of
pleasures, and she was surrounded with affluence,
pomp and admiration; where she could, unmo∣lested,
dwell upon the wretched comparison be∣tween
her past and present condition, and paint
every circumstance of her misery in the most
aggravating colours, that they might make the
deeper impression upon her mind, and the more
speedily contribute to that dissolution for which
she ardently wished, as a total release from
woe.</P>
<P>Amidst these pinings, she began to loath all
sustenance; her cheeks grew wan, her bright
eyes lost their splendor, the roses vanished from
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
her lips, and her delicate limbs could hardly sup∣port
their burthen; in a word, her sole consola∣tion
was limited to the prospect of depositing her
sorrows in the grave; and her only wish was to
procure a retreat in which she might wait with
resignation for that happy period. Yet this me∣lancholy
comfort she could not obtain without
the advice and mediation of Fathom, whom she
therefore still continued to see and consult.
While these consultations were held, Renaldo's
bosom was ravaged with tempests of rage and di∣straction.
He believed himself superseded in the
affection of his mistress, by some favoured ri∣val,
whose success rankled at his soul; and
tho' he scarce durst communicate the suspicion
to his own heart, his observation continually
whispered to him, that he was supplanted by his
friend Fathom; for Monimia was totally detach∣ed
from the conversation of every other man,
and he had of late noted their intercourse with
distempered eyes.</P>
<P>These considerations sometimes transported
him to such a degree of frenzy, that he was
tempted to sacrifice them both as traitors to gra∣titude,
friendship, and love; but such deliriums
soon vanished before his honour and humanity.
He would not allow himself to think amiss of
Ferdinand, until some undoubted mark of his
guilt should appear; and this was so far from
being the case, that hitherto there was scarce a
presumption. On the contrary (said he to him∣self)
I am hourly receiving proofs of his sympa∣thy
and attachment: Not but that he may be the
innocent cause of my mishap. His superior qua∣lifications
may have attracted the eye, and en∣gaged
the heart of that inconstant fair, without
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
his being sensible of the victory he has won; or,
perhaps, shocked at the conquest he hath unwil∣lingly
made, he discourages her advances, tries
to reason down her unjustisiable passion, and in
the mean time, conceals from me the particulars,
out of regard to my happiness and quiet.</P>
<P>Under cover of these favourable conjectures,
our adventurer securely prosecuted his scheme
upon the unfortunate Monimia. He dedicated
himself wholly to her service and conversation,
except at those times when his company was re∣quested
by Renaldo, who now very seldom ex∣acted
his attendance: In his ministry about the
person of the beauteous orphan, this cunning in∣cendiary
mingled such awful regard, such melt∣ing
compassion, as effectually screened him from
the suspicion of treachery, while he widened the
fatal breach between her and her lover, by the
most diabolical insinuations. He represented his
friend as a voluptuary, who gratified his own
appetite without the least regard to honour or
conscience; and with a shew of infinite reluct∣ance
imparted some anecdotes of his sensuality,
which he had feigned for the purpose; then he
would exclaim in an affected transport, “Graci∣ous
heaven! is it possible for any man who has
the least title to perception or humanity to injure
such innocence and perfection! for my own part,
had I been so undeservedly happy—heaven
and earth! Forgive my transports, madam, I can∣not
help seeing and admiring such divine attrac∣tions.
I cannot help resenting your wrongs;
it is the cause of virtue I espouse; it ought to be
the cause of every honest man.”</P>
<P>He had often repeated such apostrophes as
these, which she ascribed to nothing else than
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
sheer benevolence and virtuous indignation, and
actually began to think he had made some im∣pression
upon her heart; not that he now en∣tertained
the hope of an immediate triumph
over her chastity. The more he contemplated
her character, the more difficult the conquest
seemed to be; he therefore altered his plan, and
resolved to carry on his operations, under the
shelter of honourable proposals, foreseeing that
a wife of her qualifications, if properly managed,
would turn greatly to the account of the hus∣band;
or if her virtue should prove refractory,
that he could, at any time, rid himself of the
incumbrance, by decamping without beat of
drum, after he should be cloyed with possession.</P>
<P>Elevated by these expectations, he, one day,
in the midst of a preconcerted rhapsody, import∣ing,
that he could no longer conceal the fire
that preyed upon his heart, threw himself on
his knees before the lovely mourner, and im∣printed
a kiss on her fair hand: Tho' he did
not presume to take this liberty, till after such
preparation as he thought had altogether extin∣guished
her regard for Melvil, and paved the way
for his own reception in room of that discarded
lover; he had so far overshot his mark, that
Monimia, instead of favouring his declaration,
started up and retired in silence, her cheeks
glowing with shame, and her eyes gleaming
with indignation.</P>
<P>Ferdinand no sooner recovered from the con∣fusion
produced by this unexpected repulse, than
he saw the necessity of coming to a speedy de∣termination,
left the offended fair one should ap∣peal
to Renaldo, in which case they might be
mutually undeceived, to his utter shame and con∣sion;
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
he therefore resolved to depreciate her
anger, by humble supplications, and by protest∣ing,
that whatever tortures he might suffer by
suppressing his sentiments, she should never again
be offended with a declaration of his passion.</P>
<P>Having thus appeased the gentle Monimia,
and discovered, that in spite of her resentment,
his friend still kept possession of her heart, he de∣termined
to work an effectual separation, so
as that the young lady being utterly deserted by
Melvil, should be left altogether in his power.
With this christian intention he began to sadden
his visage with a double shade of pensive me∣lancholy,
in the presence of Renaldo, to stisle a
succession of involuntary sighs, to answer from
the purpose, to be incoherent in his discourse,
and in a word, to act the part of a person
wrapt up in sorrowful cogitation.</P>
<P>Count Melvil, soon as he perceived these
symptoms, very kindly enquired into the cause
of them, and was not a little alarmed to hear
the artful and evasive answers of Ferdmand, who
without disclosing the source of his disquiet,
earnestly begg'd leave to retire into some other
corner of the world. Roased by this intreaty,
the Hungarian's jealousy awoke, and with vio∣lent
agitation he exclaimed: “Then are my
fears too true! my dear Fathom, I comprehend
the meaning of your request. I have for some
time perceived an host of horrors approaching
from that quarter. I know your worth and ho∣nour.
I depend upon your friendship, and con∣jure
you by all the ties of it, to free me at once
from the most miserable suspense, by owning
you have involuntarily captivated the heart of
that unhappy maiden.”</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81"/>
To this solemn interrogation he made no
reply; but shedding a flood of tears (of which
he had always a magazine at command) he re∣peated
his desire of withdrawing, and took God
to witness, that what he proposed was solely for
the quiet of his honoured patron and beloved
friend. “Enough (cried the unfortunate Re∣naldo)
the measure of my woes is now filled up.”
So saying, he fell backwards in a swoon, from
which he was with difficulty recovered to the
sensation of the most exquisite torments. Dur∣ing
this paroxysm, our adventurer nursed him
with infinite care and tenderness; he exhorted
him to summon all his fortitude to his assistance;
to remember his fore-fathers. and exert himself
in the imitation of their virtues; to fly from those
bewitching charms which had enslaved his better
part, to retrieve his peace of mind, by reflect∣ing
on the inconstancy and ingratitude of woman,
and amuse his imagination in the pursuit of ho∣nour
and glory.</P>
<P>After these admonitions, he abused his ears
with a forged detail of the gradual advances made
to him by Monimia, and the steps he had taken
to discourage her addresses, and re-establish her
virtue; poisoning the mind of that credulous
youth to such a degree, that in all probability he
would have put a fatal period to his own exist∣ence,
had not Fathom found means to allay the
rage of his extasy, by the cunning arrangement
of opposite considerations. He set his pride a∣gainst
his love, he opposed his resentment to his
sorrow, and his ambition to his despair. Not∣withstanding
the ballance of power, so settled
among these antagonists, so violent were the
shocks of their successive conflicts, that his bo∣som
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
fared like a wretched province harrassed,
depopulated, and laid waste, by two fierce con∣tending
armies. From this moment, his life was
nothing but an alternation of starts and reveries;
he wept and raved by turns, according to the
prevailing gust of passion; food became a stranger
to his lips, and sleep to his eye-lids; he could
not support the presence of Monimia; her ab∣sence
increased the torture of his pangs; and
when he met her by accident, he started back
with horror, like a traveller who chances to
tread upon a snake.</P>
<P>The poor afflicted orphan, worn to a shadow
with self-consuming anguish, eager to find some
lowly retreat, where she could breathe out her
soul in peace, and terrified at the frantic behavi∣our
of Renaldo, communicated to Fathom her
desire of removing, and begged that he would
take a small picture of her father, decorated with
diamonds, and convert them into money for the
expence of her subsistence. This was the last
pledge of her family, which she had received
from her mother, who had preserved it in the
midst of numberless distresses; and no other spe∣cies
of misery, but that which she groaned un∣der,
could have prevailed upon the daughter to
part with it: But exclusive of other motives, the
very image itself, by recalling to her mind the
honours of her name, upbraided her with living
in dependence upon a man, who had treated her
with such indignity and ingratitude; besides, she
flattered herself with the hope that she should
not long survive the loss of this testimonial.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, with many professions of sor∣row
and mortification at his own want of capa∣city,
to prevent such an alienation, undertook
<PB N="52" REF="83"/>
to dispose of it to the best advantage, and to pro∣vide
her with a cheap and retired apartment, to
which he would conduct her in safety, tho' at
the hazard of his life. In the mean time, how∣ever,
he repaired to his friend Renaldo; and af∣ter
having admonished him to arm his soul with
patience and philosophy, declared that Moni∣mia's
guilty passion for himself, could no longer
be kept within bounds: that she had conjured
him, in the most pressing manner, to assist her
in escaping from an house which she considered
as the worst of dungeons, because she was in it
daily exposed to the sight and company of
a man whom she detested; and that she had
bribed him to compliance with her request, not
only with repeated promises of eternal love and
submission, but also with the picture of her fa∣ther
set with diamonds, which she had hitherto
reserved as the last and greatest testimony of her
affection and esteem</P>
<P>With these words, he presented the fatal
pledge to the eyes of the astonished youth, upon
whom it operated like the poisonous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of the
basilisk; for, in an instant, the whole passions of
his soul were in the most violent agitation.
“What! (cried he, in an extasy of rage) is she
so abandoned to persidy, so lost to shame, so
damned to constancy, to gratitude and virtuous
love, as to meditate the means of leaving me
without decency, without remorse! to forsake
me in my adversity, when my hapless fortune
can no longer flatter the pride and vanity of her
expectation! O woman! woman! woman!
what simile shall I find to illustrate the character
of the sex; but I will not have recourse to
vain complaints and feeble exclamations. By
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
heaven! she shall not scape; she shall not tri∣umph
in her levity—she shall not exult in my di∣stress:
No! I will rather sacrifice her to my just
resentment, to the injured powers of love and
friendship. I will act the avenging minister of
heaven! I will mangle that fair bosom which
contains so false an heart! I will tear her to
pieces, and scatter those beauteous limbs, as a
prey to the beasts of the field, and the sowls of
the air!”</P>
<P>Fathom, who expected this storm, far from
attempting to oppose its progress, waited with
patience until its first violence was overblown,
then assuming an air of condolance, animated
with that resolution which a friend ought to
maintain on such occasions: “My dear count
(said he) I am not at all surprized at your emo∣tion,
because I know what an heart, susceptible
as yours, must feel, from the apostacy of one who
has reigned so long the object of your love, ad∣miration,
and esteem. Your endeavours to
drive her from your thoughts, must create an
agony much more severe, than that which
divorces the soul from the body. Nevertheless, I
am so confident of your virtue and your man∣hood,
as to foresee that you will allow the frail
Monimia to execute that resolution which she
hath so unwisely taken to withdraw herself from
your love and protection. Believe me, my best
friend and benefactor, this is a stop, in conse∣quence
of which you will infallibly retrieve your
peace of mind. It may cost you many bitter
pangs, it may probe your wounds to the quick;
but those pangs will be soothed by the gentle and
salutary wing of time, and that probing will rouse
you to a due sense of your own dignity and im∣portance,
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
which will enable you to convert your
attention to objects far more worthy of your
contemplation. All the hopes of happiness you
had cherished in the possession of Monimia, are
now irrecoverably blasted; her heart is now de∣based
beneath your consideration; her love is,
without all doubt, extinguished, and her honour
irretrievably lost; insomuch, that were she to
prosess sorrow for her indiscretion, and implore
your forgiveness, with the most solemn promises
of regarding you for the future with unalterable
fidelity and affection, you ought not to restore
her to that place in your heart which she hath so
meanly forfeited; because you could not at the
same time reinstate her in the possession of that
delicate esteem without which there is no harmo∣ny,
no rapture, no true enjoyment in love. No,
my dear Renaldo, expel the unworthy tenant
from your bosom; allow her to fill up the mea∣sure
of her ingratitude, by deserting her lover,
friend and benefactor. Your glory demands her
dismission; the would will applaud your genero∣sity,
and your own heart approve of your con∣duct:
So disincumbered, let us exert ourselves
once more in promoting your departure from
this island, that you may revisit your father's house,
do justice to your self and amiable sister, and
take vengeance on the author of your wrongs;
then dedicate yourself to glory, in imitation of
your renowned ancestors, and flourish in the fa∣vour
of your imperial patron.”</P>
<P>These remonstrances had such effect upon the
Hungarian, that his face was lighted up with a
transient gleam of satisfaction; he embraced
Ferdinand with great ardour, calling him his
pride, his Mentor, his good genius, and intreated
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
him to gratify the inclination of that fickle crea∣ture,
so far as to convey her to another lodging,
without loss of time, while he would, by absent∣ing
himself, favour their retreat.</P>
<P>Our hero having obtained this permission, went
immediately to the skirts of the town, where he
had previously bespoke a small, tho' neat apart∣ment,
at the house of an old woman, widow of a
French refugee: he had already reconnoitred the
ground, by founding his landlady, from whose
poverty and complaisance he found reason to ex∣pect
all sorts of freedom and opportunity for the
accomplishment of his aim upon Monimia's per∣son.
The room being prepared for her recepti∣on,
he returned to that disconsolate beauty, to
whom he presented ten guineas, which he pre∣tended
to have raised by pledging the picture;
though he himself acted as the pawn-broker on
this occasion, for a very plain and ovious reason.</P>
<P>The fair orphan was overjoyed to find her wish
so speedily accomplished: she forthwith packed
up her necessaries in a trunk; and an hackney∣coach
was called in the dusk of the evening, in
which she imbarked with her baggage and con∣ductor.</P>
<P>Yet she did not leave the habitation of Renaldo
without regret. In the instant of parting, the
idea of that unfortunate youth was associated with
every well known object that presented itself to
her eyes; not as an inconstant, ungenerous and
perjured swain, but as the accomplished, the vir∣tuous,
the melting lover, who had captivated her
virgin heart. As Fathom led her to the door,
she was met by Renaldo's dog, which had long
been her favourite, and the poor animal fawning
upon her as she passed, her heart was over∣whelmed
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
with such a gush of tenderness, that a
flood of tears streamed down her cheeks, and she
had well nigh sunk upon the floor.</P>
<P>Ferdinand considering this emotion as the last
tribute she would pay to Renaldo, hurried her
into the coach, where she soon recovered her
composure; and in a little time he ushered her in∣to
the house of madam la Mer, by whom she was
received with great cordiality, and conducted to
her apartment, with which she found no other
fault, but that of its being too good for one in
her forlorn situation: here, while the tear of gra∣titude
started in either eye, she thanked our ad∣venturer
for his benevolence and kind concern,
assuring him, that she would not fail daily to be∣seech
the Most High to shower down blessings
upon him, as the orphan's friend and protector.</P>
<P>Fathom was not deficient in those expressions
that were best adapted to her present turn of
mind: he observed, that what he had done, was
in obedience to the dictates of common humani∣ty,
which would have prompted him to assist
any fellow-creature in distress; but that her pe∣culiar
virtue and qualifications were such as chal∣lenged
the utmost exertion of his faculties in her
service: he said, that surely Heaven had not
created such perfection in vain; that she was des∣tined
to receive as well as to communicate hap∣piness;
and that the Providence which she so
piously adored, would not fail, in due season, to
raise her from distress and affliction, to that ho∣nour
and felicity for which she was certainly or∣dained:
in the mean time he intreated her to de∣pend
upon his service and fidelity, and the article
of her board being settled, he left her to the com∣pany
and consolation of her discreet hostess, who
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
soon insinuated herself into the good opinion of
her beauteous lodger.</P>
<P>While our hero was employed in this transac∣tion,
Renaldo sallied forth in a sort of intoxica∣tion,
which Fathom's admonitions had inspired;
and repairing to a certain noted coffee-house, en∣gaged
at chess with an old French refugee, that
his attention, by being otherwise employed, might
not stray towards that fatal object which he ar∣dently
wished to forget. But, unluckily for him,
he had scarce performed three moves of the game,
when his ears were exposed to a dialogue between
two young gentlemen; one of whom asked the
other if he would go and see the orphan acted at
one of the theatres; observing, as a farther in∣ducement,
that the part of Monimia would be
performed by a young gentlewoman who had ne∣ver
appeared on the stage. At mention of that
name Renaldo started: for, tho' it did not pro∣perly
belong to his orphan, it was the appellation
by which she had been distinguished ever since her
separation from her father's house; and therefore,
it recalled her to his imagination in the most in∣teresting
point of view. Though he endeavoured
to expel the image, by a closer application to his
play, every now and then it intruded upon his
fancy, and at each return made a stronger im∣pression;
so that he found himself in the situation
of an unfortunate bark stranded upon some hidden
rock, which, when the wind begins to blow, feels
every succeeding wave more boisterous than the
former, until, with irresistible fury, they surmount
her decks, sweep every thing before them, and
dash her all to pieces.</P>
<P>The refugee had observed his first emotion,
which he attributed to an unforeseen advantage he
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
himself had gained over the Hungarian: but see∣ing
him, in the sequel, bite his lip, roll his eyes,
groan, writhe his body, ejaculate incoherent
curses, and neglect his game, the Huguenot con∣cluded,
that he was mad; and, being seized
with terror and dismay, got up and scampered off
without ceremony or hesitation.</P>
<P>Melvil, thus left to the horrors of his own
thought, which tortured him with the apprehen∣sion
of losing Monimia for ever, could no longer
combat that suggestion, but ran homewards with
all the speed he could exert, in order to prevent
her retreat. When he crossed the threshold, he
was struck with such a damp of presaging fear,
that he durst not in person approach her apart∣ment,
nor even, by questioning the servant, in∣form
himself of the particulars he wanted to
know: yet his suspence becoming more in∣supportable
than his fear, he rushed from room
to room in quest of that which was not to be
found; and, seeing Monimia's chamber-door
open, entered the deserted temple in a state of
distraction, calling aloud upon her name. All
was silent, solitary, and wosul, “She is gone—(he
cried, shedding a flood of tears)—she is for
ever lost; and all my hopes of happiness are fled!”</P>
<P>So saying, he sunk upon that couch on which
Monimia had oft reposed, and abandoned himself
to all the excess of grief and despondence. In
this deplorable condition he was found by our ad∣venturer,
who gently chid him for his want of
resolution, and again repelled his sorrow, by
arousing his resentment against the innocent cause
of his disquiet, having before hand forged the par∣ticulars
of provocation. “Is it possible,” said
he, “that Renaldo can still retain the least sen∣timent
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
of regard for a sickle woman, by whom
he has been so ungratefully forsaken and so unjustly
scorned? Is it possible he can be so disturbed by
the loss of a creature who is herself lost to all
virtue and decorum?—Time and reflection, my
worthy friend, will cure you of that inglorious
malady: and the future misconduct of that im∣prudent
damsel will, doubtless, contribute to the
recovery of your peace. Her behaviour at leaving
the house where she had received so many marks of
the most delicate affection, was in all respects so op∣posite
to honour and decency, that I could scarce
refrain from telling her I was shocked at her de∣portment,
even while she loaded me with protes∣tations
of love. When a woman's heart is once
depraved, she bids adieu to all restraint;—she
preserves no measures. It was not simply con∣tempt
which she expressed for Renaldo; she
seems to resent his being able to live under her
disdain; and that resentment stoops to objects un∣worthy
of indignation. Even your dog was not
exempted from the effects of her displeasure: for,
in her passage to the door, she kicked the poor
animal as one of your dependants; and in our
way to the apartment I had provided for her, she
entertained me with a ludicrous comment upon
the manner in which you first made her acquaint∣ed
with your passion. All that modesty of car∣riage,
all that chastity of conversation, all that
dignity of grief, which she knew so well how to
affect, is now entirely laid aside, and when I
quitted her, she seemed the most gay, giddy and
impertinent of her sex.”</P>
<P>“Gracious powers! (exclaimed Renaldo,
starting from the couch) am I under the delusion
of a dream; or are these things really so, as my
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
friend has represented them? Such a total and
sudden degeneracy is amazing! is monstrous and
unnatural!”——“Such, my dear Count,” re∣plied
our hero, “is the caprice of a female heart,
fickle as the wind, uncertain as a calm at sea,
fixed to no principle, but swayed by every san∣tastic
gust of passion, or of whim. Congratu∣late
yourself, therefore, my friend, upon your
happy deliverance from such a domestic plague—
upon the voluntary exile of a traitor from your
bosom:—recollect the dictates of your duty, your
discretion, and your glory, and think upon the
honours and elevated enjoyment for which you
are certainly ordained. To night, let us over a
chearful bottle anticipate your success; and to∣morrow
I will accompany you to the house of an
usurer, who, I am informed, fears no risk, pro∣vided
twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> be given, and the bor∣rower's
life insured.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The art of borrowing further explained; and an
account of a strange phoenomenon.</HEAD>
<P>IN this manner did the artful incendiary work
upon the passions of the credulous unsuspect∣ing
Hungarian, who pressed him to his breast
with the most cordial expressions of friendship,
calling him his guardian, his saviour, his second
father, and gave himself up wholly to his ad∣vice.</P>
<P>Next morning, according to the plan they had
laid over night, they repaired to a tavern in the
neighbourhood of the person to whom our adven∣turer
had been directed, and were fortunate
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
enough to find him in the house, transacting a
money affair with a young gentleman who treat∣ed
him with his morning's whet.</P>
<P>That affair being negotiated, he adjourned in∣to
another room with Renaldo and his compani∣on,
who were not a little surprised to see this
minister of Plutus in the shape of a young sprightly
beau, trimmed up in all the foppery of the fashion;
for they had hitherto always associated with the
idea of an usurer, old age and rusty apparel.
After divers modish congees, he begged to know
to what he should attribute the honour of their
message; when Ferdinand, who acted the ora∣tor,
told him, that his friend Count Melvil, hav∣ing
occasion for a sum of money, had been directed
to a gentleman of his name, “and I suppose,”
added he, “you are the son of the person with
whom the affair is to be negotiated.”</P>
<P>“Sir,” said this <HI>petit maitre,</HI> with a smile,
I perceive you are surprised to see one of my
profession in the appearance of a gentleman; and
perhaps your wonder will not cease, when I tell
you, that my education was liberal, and that I
once had the honour to bear a commission in the
British army. I was indeed a first lieutenant of
marines, and will venture to say, that no officer
in the service was more delicate than myself, in
observing all the punctilios of honour. I en∣tertained
the utmost contempt for all the trading
part of the nation, and suffered myself to be run
through the body in a duel, rather than roll with
a brother-lieutenant who was a broker's son: but,
thank Heaven! I have long ago conquered all
those ridiculous prejudices. I soon observed, that
without money there was no respect, honour, or
convenience to be acquired in life; that wealth
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
amply supplied the want of wit, merit and pedi∣gree,
having influence and pleasure ever at com∣mand;
and that the world never failed to wor∣ship
the flood of affluence, without examining the
dirty channels thro' which it commonly flowed.</P>
<P>At the end of the war, finding my appoint∣ments
reduced to two shillings and four-pence
<HI>per</HI> day, and being addicted to pleasures which I
could not possibly purchase from such a fund, I
sold my half-pay for two hundred pounds, which
I lent upon bond to a young officer of the same
regiment, on condition that he should insure his
life, and restore one fourth pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the sum by
way of premium. I happened to be lucky in
this first estay: for the borrower, having in six
weeks expended the money, made an excursion
on the high-way, was apprehended, tried, con∣victed
of felony, and cut his own throat, to prevent
the shame of a public execution; so that his bond
was discharged by the insurers.</P>
<P>In short, gentlemen, when I engaged in this
business, I determined to carry it on with such
spirit, as would either make my fortune, or en∣tirely
ruin me in a little time; and hitherto my
endeavours have been tolerably successful: nor
do I think my proceedings a whit more criminal
or unjust, than those of other merchants, who
strive to turn their money to the best account.
The commodity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deal in is cash; and it is my
business to sell it to the best advantage. A Lon∣don
factor sends a cargo of goods to market, and
if he gets two hundred <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the sale,
he is commended for his industry and address.
If I sell money for one fourth part of that pro∣fit,
certain persons will be so unjust, as to cry,
Shame upon me, for taking such advantage of my
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
neighbour's distress: not considering, that the
trader took four times the same advantage of those
people who bought his cargo, tho' his risque was
not half so great as mine; and although the mo∣ney
I sold, perhaps retrieved the borrower from
the very jaws of destruction: for example, it was
but yesterday I saved a worthy man from being
arrested for a sum of money, for which he had
bailed a friend who treacherously lest him in the
lurch: as he did not forsee what would happen,
he had made no provision for the demand, and
his sphere of life secluding him from all sorts of
money'd intercourse, he could not raise the cash
by his credit in the usual way of borrowing; so
that, without my assistance, he must have gone
to jail; a disgrace which would have proved fatal to
the peace of his family, and utterly ruined his re∣putation.
—Nay, that very young gentleman from
whom I just now parted, will, in all probability,
be indebted to me for a very genteel livelihood.
He had obtained the absolute promise of being
provided for, by a great man, who fits at the
helm of affairs in a neighbouring kingdom; but
being destitute of all other resources, he could
not have equipped himself for the voyage, in or∣der
to profit by his lordship's intention, unless I
had enabled him to pursue his good fortune.”</P>
<P>Renaldo was not a little pleased to hear this
harrangue, to which Fathom replied with many
florid encomiums upon the usurer's good sense
and humane disposition: then he explained the
errand of his friend, which was to borrow three
hundred pounds, in order to retrieve his inheri∣tance,
of which he had been defrauded in his ab∣sence.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95"/>
“Sir, (said the lender, addressing himself to
Count Melvil), I pretend to have acquired by
experience some skill in physiognomy; and tho'
there are some faces so deeply disguised as to baffle
all the penetration of our art, there are others,
in which the heart appears with such nakedness
of integrity, as at once to recommend it to our
good will.—I own your countenance prepossesses
me in your savour; and you shall be accommo∣dated,
upon those terms from which I never de∣viate,
provided you can find proper security, that
you shall not quit the British dominions, for that,
with me, is a condition <HI>sine qua non.</HI>”</P>
<P>This was a very disagreeable declaration to Re∣naldo,
who candidly owned, that as his concerns
lay upon the continent, his purpose was to leave
England without delay. The usurer professed
himself sorry that it was not in his power to ob∣lige
him; and, in order to prevent any farther
opportunity, assured them, he had laid it down
as a maxim, from which he would never swerve,
to avoid all dealings with people whom (if need
should be) he could not sue by the laws of this
realm.</P>
<P>Thus the intervention of one unlucky and un∣foreseen
circumstance blasted, in an instant, the
budding hopes of Melvile, who, while his visage
exhibited the most sorrowful disappointment, beg∣ged
to know, if there was any person of his ac∣quaintance,
who might be less scrupulous in that
particular.</P>
<P>The young gentleman directed them to ano∣ther
member of his profession, and wishing them
success, took his leave with great form and com∣plaisance.
This instance of politeness was, how∣ever,
no more than a shift to disingage himself
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
the more easily from their intreaties: for, when
the case was opened to the second usurer, he
blessed himself from such customers, and dismissed
them with the most mortifying and boorish refu∣sal.
Notwithstanding these repulses, Renaldo
resolved to make one desperate push; and, with∣out
allowing himself the least respite, sollicited,
one by one, not fewer than fifteen persons who
dealt in this kind of traffic, and his proposals
were rejected by each. At last, fatigued by the
toil, and exasperated at the ill success of his expe∣dition;
and half mad with the recollection of his
finances, which were now drained to half a crown,
“Since we have nothing to expect,” cried he,
“from the favour of christians, let us have re∣course
to the descendants of Judah. Tho' they
lie under the general reproach of nations, as a
people dead to virtue and benevolence, and wholly
devoted to avarice, fraud, and extortion, the most
savage of their tribe cannot treat me with more
barbarity of indifference, than I have experi∣enced
among those who are the authors of their
reproach.”</P>
<P>Although Fathom looked upon this proposal as
an extravagant symptom of despair, he affected
to approve of the scheme, and encouraged Re∣naldo
with the hope of succeeding in another
quarter, even if this expedition should fail: for,
by this time, our adventurer was half resolved to
export him at his own change, rather than he
should be much longer restricted in his designs
upon Monimia.</P>
<P>Mean while, being resolved to try the experi∣ment
upon the children of Israel, they betook
themselves to the house of a rich Jew, whose
wealth they considered as a proof of his rapacious∣ness;
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
and, being admitted into his compting-house,
they found him, in the midst of half a
dozen clerks, when Renaldo, in his imagination,
likened him unto a minister of darkness sur∣rounded
by his familiars, and planning schemes
of misery to be executed upon the hapless sons of
men. In spite of these suggestions, which were
not at all mitigated by the forbidding aspect of
the Hebrew, he demanded a private audience;
and, being ushered into another apartment, he ex∣plained
his business with manifest marks of disor∣der
and affliction. Indeed his confusion was in
some measure owing to the looks of the Jew, who
in the midst of his exordium pulled down his eye∣brows,
which were surprisingly black and bushy,
so as, in appearance, totally to extinguish his
vision, tho' he was all the time observing our youth
from behind those almost impenetrable thickets.</P>
<P>Melvil having signified his request, “Young
gentleman, (said the Israelite, with a most dis∣cordant
voice), what in the name of goodness,
could induce you to come to me, upon such an
errand? Did you ever hear that I lent money to
strangers, without security?” “No,” replied
Renaldo; “nor did I believe I should profit by my
application: but my affairs are desperate; and my
proposals having been rejected by every Christian
to whom they were offered, I was resolved to try
my sate among the Jews, who are reckoned ano∣ther
species of men.”</P>
<P>Fathom, alarmed at this abrupt reply, which
he supposed could not fail to disgust the merchant,
interposed in the conversation, by making an apo∣logy
for the plain dealing of his friend, who, he
said, was soured and ruffled by his misfortunes:
then exerting that power of eloquence which he
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
had at command, he expostulated upon Renaldo's
claim and expectations, described the wrongs he
had suffered, extolled his virtue, and drew a most
pathetic picture of his distress.</P>
<P>The Jew listened attentively for some time;
then his eye-brows began to rise and fall alter∣nately;
he cough'd, sneez'd, and winking hard,
“I'm plagued,” said he, “with a salt rheum
that trickles from my eyes without intermission.”
So saying, he wiped the moisture from his face,
and proceeded in these words: “Sir, your story
is plausible; and your friend is a good advocate:
but, before I give an answer to your demand, I
must beg leave to ask if you can produce unde∣niable
evidence of your being the identical person
you really assume. If you are really the Count
de Melvil, you will excuse my caution: we can∣not
be too much on our guard against fraud;
tho' I must own you have not the air of an im∣postor.”</P>
<P>Renaldo's eyes began to sparkle at this preli∣minary
question; to which he replied, that he
could procure the testimony of the Emperor's mi∣nister,
to whom he had occasionally paid his re∣spects
since his first arrival in England.</P>
<P>“If that be the case,” said the Jew, “take
the trouble to call here to-morrow morning at
eight o'clock, and I will carry you in my own
coach to the house of his excellency, with whom
I have the honour to be acquainted; and, if he
has nothing to object against your character, or
pretensions, I will contribute my assistance to∣wards
your obtaining justice at the imperial
court.”</P>
<P>The Hungarian was so much confounded at
this unexpected reception, that he had not power
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
to thank the merchant for his promised favour,
but stood motionless and silent, while the streams
of gratitude ran down his cheeks. This genuine
emotion of the heart was of more weight with
the Jew, than the eloquent acknowledgment
which Ferdinand took the opportunity of making
for his friend; and he was fain to dismiss them a
little abruptly, in order to prevent a second dis∣charge
of that same rheum of which he had al∣ready
complained.</P>
<P>Melvil recollected all that had happened as a
dream, which had no foundation in truth, and was
all day long in a sort of delirium, produced by the
alternate gusts of hope and fear that still agitated
his bosom: for he was not yet without apprehen∣sion
of being again disappointed by some unlucky
occurrence.</P>
<P>He did not, however, fail to be punctual to
the hour of his appointment, when the Jew told
him, there would be no occasion for visiting the
ambassador, because Renaldo had been, the pre∣ceding
day, recognised by one of the clerks who
had been employed as a purveyor in the impe∣rial
army; and who, knowing his family, con∣firmed
every thing he had alledged. “After
breakfast,” continued this benevolent Israelite,
“I will give you an order upon my banker for
five hundred pounds, that you may be enabled to
appear at Vienna, as the son and representative
of Count Melvil; and you shall also be furnished
with a letter of recommendation to a person of
some influence at that court, whose friendship and
countenance may be of some service to your suit:
for I am now heartily engaged in your interest,
in consequence of the fair and unblemished cha∣racter
which I find you have hitherto maintained.”</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100"/>
The reader must appeal to his own heart, to
acquire a just idea of Renaldo's feelings, when
every tittle of these promises was fulfilled, and the
merchant refused to take one farthing by way of
premium, contenting himself with the slender se∣curity
of a personal bond. He was, in truth,
overwhelmed with the obligation, and certainly
disposed to believe, that his benefactor was some∣thing
more than human. As for Fathom, his
sentiments took a different turn; and he scrupled
not to impute all this kindness to some deep-laid
interested scheme, the scope of which he could
not at present comprehend.</P>
<P>After the tumults of the young gentleman's joy
had subsided, and he found himself eased of that
burthensome poverty, under which he had groaned
so long; his thoughts, which before were dissi∣pated
upon the various circumstances of distress,
began to collect themselves in a body, and to re∣sume
their deliberations upon a subject which they
had been long accustomed to consider; this was
no other than the forlorn Monimia, whose idea
now emerged in his bosom, being disencumbered
of one part of the load by which it had been de∣pressed.
He mentioned her name to Fathom,
with marks of the most melting compassion, de∣plored
her apostasy; and, while he protested that
he had divorced her for ever from his heart, ex∣pressed
an inclination to see her once more, be∣fore
his departure, that he might in person ex∣hort
her to penitence and reformation.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, who dreaded such an inter∣view
as the infallible means of his own ruin, re∣sisted
the proposal with the whole power of his
elocution. He affirmed, that Renaldo's desire
was a manifest proof that he still retained part of
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
the fatal poison which that inchantress had spread
within his veins, and that the sight of her, softened
by his reproaches into tears and affected contri∣tion,
would dispel his resentment, disable his man∣hood,
and blow the embers of his former passion
to such a rage, as would hurry him on to a re∣conciliation,
which would debase his honour, and
ruin his future peace. In a word, Ferdinand de∣scribed
the danger that would attend the meeting,
in such emphatic terms, that the Hungarian started
with horror at the picture which he drew, and in
this particular conformed with the admonition of
his friend.</P>
<P>One hundred pounds of the Jew's money was
immediately appropriated for the payment of his
most urgent debts; the like sum he presented to his
friend Fathom, with a solemn promise of sharing
with him whatever good fortune might await him
in Germany: and tho' Monimia had forfeited all
title to his regard, so ill could he bear the prospect
of her distress, that he entrusted his dear compa∣nion
with the half of what remained, to be ex∣pended
for her use, fully resolving to screen her
from the shocks and temptations of want, as the
circumstances of his future fate would allow.</P>
<P>Fathom, far from opposing, applauded his ge∣nerosity
with marks of extreme wonder and ad∣miration,
assuring him, that she should be put in
possession of his bounty, immediately after his de∣parture,
he being unwilling to make her acquaint∣ed
with her good fortune before that period, lest
finding his affairs in a fair way of being retrieved,
she should be base enough to worship his returning
prosperity, and, by false professions, and artful
blandishments, seek to ensnare his heart anew.</P>

<P>EVery necessary preparation being made, Re∣naldo,
accompanied by our adventurer, took
the road to Dover, where he embarked in a pac∣ket
boat for Calais, after having settled a corre∣spondence
with his dear Ferdinand, from whom
he did not part without tears. He had before
sollicited him to be his fellow-traveller, that he might personally enjoy the benefit of his conver∣sation,
and superior sagacity; but these intreaties
he strenuously opposed, on pretence of his being
determined to push his fortune in England, which
he considered as his native country, and as the
land in which (of all others) a man of merit has
the best encouragement. Such were the reasons
he alledged, for refusing to attend his benefactor,
who was himself eagerly desirous of attaining a
settlement in the island of Great Britain: but our
hero's real motives for staying were of a very
different complexion.—The reader is already in∣formed
of his aim upon the fair orphan, which,
at present, was the chief spring of his conduct:
he may also recollect such passages of his life, as
were sufficient to deter him from re-appearing at
Presburg or Vienna: but, besides these reflexions,
he was detained by a full persuasion that Renaldo
would sink under the power and influence of his
antagonist, consequently be rendered incapable to
provide for his friends; and that he himself,
fraught with wiles and experience, as he was,
could not fail to make himself amends for what
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
he had suffered among a people equally rich and
unthinking.</P>
<P>Melvil having embraced our adventurer, and
with a deep sigh bid him take care of the unfor∣tunate
Monimia, committed himself to the sea,
and, by the assistance of a favourable gale, was,
in four hours, safely landed on the French shore;
while Fathom took post-horses for London, where
he arrived that same night, and next day, in the
forenoon, went to visit the beauteous mourner,
who had as yet received no intimation of Renal∣do's
departure or design. He found her in the
attitude of writing a letter to her inconstant lover,
the contents of which the reader will be acquainted
with in due time. Her countenance, notwith∣standing
the veil of melancholy by which it was
overcast, seemed altogether serene and composed;
she was the picture of pious resignation, <HI>and sat
like</HI> PATIENCE <HI>on a monument, smiling at grief.</HI>
After having paid the compliment of the morn∣ing,
Fathom begged pardon for having omitted to
visit her during three days, in which, he said, his
time had been wholly engrossed in procuring a
proper equipage for Count Melvil, who had at
last bid an eternal adieu to the island of Great
Britain.</P>
<P>At this information the hapless Monimia fell
back in her chair, and continued some minutes
in a swoon; from which being recovered, “Ex∣cuse
me, Mr. Fathom (cried she, with a deep
sigh); this, I hope, is the last agony I shall feel
from my unhappy passion.”—Then wiping the
tears from her lovely eyes, she retrieved her tran∣quillity,
and desired to know by what means Re∣naldo
had been enabled to undertake his journey
into the empire. Our hero, upon this occasion,
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
assumed the whole merit of having promoted the
interest of his friend, by giving her to under∣stand,
that he, in consequence of an unforeseen
windfall had defrayed the expence of the Count's
equipment; though he observed, that it was not
without reluctance he saw Renaldo make a wrong
use of his friendship.</P>
<P>“Although I was happy (proceeded this artful
traitor) in being able to discharge my obligations
to the house of Melvil, I could not help feeling
the most sensible chagrin, when I saw my assist∣ance
rendered subservient to the triumphs of the
youth's baseness and infidelity; for he chose, as
the companion of his travels, the abandoned wo∣man,
for whom he had forsaken the all-perfect
Monimia, whose virtue and accomplishments did
not preserve her sacred from his ungrateful sar∣casms
and unmannerly ridicule. Believe me,
madam, I was so shocked at his conversation on
that subject, and so much incensed at his want of
delicacy, that my temper was scarce sufficient for
the ceremony of parting: and now that my debt
to his family is overpaid, I have solemnly re∣nounced
his correspondence.”</P>
<P>When she heard that, instead of betraying the
least symptom of regret or compassion for her
unhappy fate, the perfidious youth had exulted
over her fall, and even made her a subject for his
mirth, the blood revisited her faded cheeks, and
resentment restored to her eyes that poignancy
which sorrow had before overcome. Yet she
scorn'd to give speech to her indignation; but,
forcing a smile, “Why should I repine,” said
she, “at the mortifications of a life which I de∣spise,
and from which, I hope, Heaven will
speedily set me free!”</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105"/>
Fathom, fired by her emotion, which had re∣called
all the graces of her beauty, exclaimed in
a rapture, “<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alk not so contemptuously of this
life, which hath still a fund of happiness in store
for the amiable, the divine Monimia. Though
one admirer hath proved an apostate to his vows,
your candour will not suffer you to condemn the
whole sex. Some there are, whose bosoms glow
with passion equally pure, unalterable and intense.
For my own part, I have sacrificed to a rigid
punctilio of honour the dearest ideas of my heart.
I beheld your unrivalled charms, and deeply felt
their power: yet, while a possibility of Melvil's
reformation remained, and while I was restrained
by my niggard fortune, from making a tender
worthy of your acceptance, I combated with my
inclinations, and bore without repining the pangs
of hopeless love. But, now that my honour is
disengaged, and my fortune rendered independ∣ent,
by the last will of a worthy nobleman,
whose friendship I was favoured with in France,
I presume to lay myself at the feet of the adora∣ble
Monimia, as the most faithful of admirers,
whose happiness or misery wholly depends upon
her nod. Believe me, Madam, these are not
the professions of idle gallantry—I speak the ge∣nuine,
though imperfect, language of my heart:
words even the most pathetic cannot do justice
to my love. I gaze upon your beauty with ra∣vishment;
but, I contemplate the graces of your
soul with such awful veneration, that I tremble
while I approach you, as if my vows were ad∣dressed
to some superior being.”</P>
<P>During this declaration, which was pronounced
in the most emphatic manner, Monimia was suc∣cessively
agitated with shame, anger and grief;
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
nevertheless, she summoned her whole philoso∣phy
to her aid, and with a tranquil, though de∣termined
air, begged he would not diminish the
obligations he had already conferred, by disturb∣ing
with such unseasonable addresses, a poor un∣happy
maid, who had detached all her thoughts
from earthly objects, and waited impatiently for
that dissolution which alone could put a period to
her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Fathom, imagining that these were no other
than the suggestions of a temporary disappoint∣ment
and despondence, which it was his business
to oppose with all his eloquence and art, renewed
his theme with redoubled ardour, and at last be∣came
so importunate in his desires, that Moni∣mia,
provoked beyond the power of concealing
her resentment, said, she was heartily sorry to
find herself under the necessity of telling him,
that, in the midst of her misfortunes, she could
not help remembering what she had been. Then
rising from her seat with all the dignity of dis∣pleasure,
“Perhaps,” added she, “you have
forgot who was the father of the once happy
Monimia.”</P>
<P>With these words she retired into another
chamber, leaving our adventurer confounded by
the repulse he had sustained. Not that he was
discouraged from prosecuting his aim: on the
contrary, this rebuff seemed to add fresh vigour
to his operations. He now thought it high time
to bring over Madam la Mer to his interest;
and, to facilitate her conversion, took an oppor∣tunity
of bribing her with some inconsiderable
presents, after having amused her with a plausi∣ble
tale of his passion for Monimia, with whom
she undertook the office of his mediatrix, on the
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
supposition that his intentions were honourable
and highly advantageous to her lodger.</P>
<P>She was, first of all, invested with the office
of obtaining pardon for the offence he had given;
and in this negotiation she succeeded so well, as
to become an advocate for his suit: accordingly,
she took all occasions of magnifying his praise.
His agreeable person was often the subject of her
discourse to the fair mourner: her admiration
dwelt upon his politeness, good sense and winning
deportment: and she every day retailed little
stories of his benevolence and greatness of soul.
The defect in his birth she represented as a cir∣cumstance
altogether foreign from the considera∣tion
of his merit; especially in a nation where
such distinctions are as little respected as they will
be in a future state. She mentioned several per∣sons
of note, who basked in the sun-shine of
power and fortune, without having enjoyed the
least hereditary assistance from their fore-fathers.
One, she said, sprung from the loins of an ob∣scure
attorney, another was the grandson of a
valet de chambre, a third was the issue of an ac∣comptant,
and a fourth the off-pring of an
woolen-draper: all these were the children of
their own good works, and had raised themselves
upon their personal virtues and address; a foun∣dation
certainly more solid and honourable, than
a vague inheritance derived from ancestors, in
whose deserts they could not be supposed to have
bore the least share.</P>
<P>Monimia listened to all these arguments with
great patience aud affability, though she at once
dived into the source from which all such insi∣nuations
flowed: she joined in the commenda∣tions
of Fathom, and owned herself a particular
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
instance of that benevolence which the old lady
had so justly extolled; but, once for all, to pre∣vent
the supplication which Madam la Mer was
about to make, she solemnly protested, that her
heart was altogether shut against any other earth∣ly
engagement; and that her thoughts were alto∣gether
employed upon her eternal salvation.</P>
<P>The assiduous landlady perceiving the steadiness of
her disposition, thought proper to alter her method
of proceeding, and, for the present suspended that
theme by which she found her fair lodger disoblig∣ed.
Resolved to reconcile Monimia to life, before
she would again recommend Ferdinand to her
love, she endeavoured to amuse her imagination,
by recounting the occasional incidents of the day,
hoping gradually to decoy her attention to those
sublunary objects from which it had been industri∣ously
weaned: she seasoned her conversation with
agreeable sallies; enlarged upon the different
scenes of pleasure and diversion appertaining to
this great metropolis; practised upon her palate,
with the delicacies of eating; endeavoured to
shake her temperance with repeated proffers and
recommendations of certain cordials and resto∣ratives
which she alledged were necessary for the
recovery of her health; and pressed her to make
little excursions into the fields that skirt the town,
for the benefit of air and exercise.</P>
<P>While this auxiliary plied the disconsolate Moni∣mia
on one hand, Fathom was not remiss on the
other: he now seemed to have sacrificed his passion
to her quiet; his discourse turned upon more in∣different
subjects; he endeavoured to dispel her
melancholy with arguments drawn from philosophy
and religion: on some occasions, he displayed all his
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
fund of good humour, with a view to beguile her
sorrow; he importuned her to give him the plea∣sure
of 'squiring her to some place of innocent
entertainment; and, finally, insisted upon her ac∣cepting
a pecuniary reinforcement to her finances,
which he knew to be in a most consumptive con∣dition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="49" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Monimia's honour is protected by the interposition of
Heaven.</HEAD>
<P>WITH that complacency and fortitude
which were peculiar to herself, this hap∣less
stranger resisted all those artful temptations.
Her sustenance was barely such as exempted her
from the guilt of being accessory to her own
death; her drink was the simple element: she
encouraged no discourse but that which turned
upon the concerns of her immortal part; she ne∣ver
went abroad except in visits to a French
chapel in the neighbourhood; she refused the
proffered assistance of our adventurer with equal
obstinacy and politeness, and with pleasure saw
herself wasting towards that period of mortality
which was the consummation of her wish. Yet
her charms, far from melting away with her
constitution, seemed to triumph over the decays
of nature: her shape and features still retained
that harmony for which they had always been
distinguished: a mixture of majesty and sweetness
diffused itself in her looks, and her feebleness ad∣ded
to that soft and feminine grace which attracts
the sympathy, and engages the protection of every
humane beholder. The associates, thus baffled
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
in their attempts to excite her ideas of pleasure,
again shifted their plan, and resolved to attack
this forlorn beauty, on the side of fear and mor∣tification.</P>
<P>Our adventurer became less frequent in his vi∣sits,
and more indifferent in his language and de∣portment;
while Madam la Mer gradually re∣laxed
in that complacency and respect with which
she had hitherto behaved towards her fair lodger.
She even began to drop hints of disapprobation
and reproach against this pattern of innocence
and beauty, and at length grew bold enough to
tell her, that her misfortunes could be attributed
to nothing but her own obstinacy and pride; that
she had been at great pains to disoblige the only
person who was able and willing to raise her above
dependance, and that if his protection should be
withdrawn, she must be exposed to the utmost
extremity of distress.</P>
<P>These insinuations, instead of producing the
desired effect, inflamed the indignation of Moni∣nimia,
who, in a most dignified stile of rebuke,
chid her for her indelicacy and presumption, ob∣serving,
that she could have no title to take such
freedoms with lodgers, whose punctuality and re∣gular
deportment left her no room to complain.
Notwithstanding this animated reply, she under∣went
the most deplorable anguish, when she re∣flected
upon the insolence of this woman, from
whose barbarity she had no resource; and seeing
no other possibility of redress, than that of appeal∣ing
to the good offices of Fathom, she conquered
her reluctance so far, as to complain to him of
Madam la Mer's incivility.</P>
<P>Pleased with this application, he gave her to
understand, with very little ceremony or pream∣ble,
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
that it wholly depended upon herself, whe∣ther
she should continue to be wretched, or be
delivered at once from all her cares and perplexi∣ty;
that, notwithstanding the disdain with which
she had treated his addresses, he was still ready to
lay himself and his fortune at her feet; and that
if she should again reject the disinterested propo∣sal,
the whole world, and her own conscience,
would charge upon herself, whatever calamities
she might be subjected to in the sequel. Interpret∣ing
into a favourable hesitation her silence, which
was the result of wrath and amazement, he pro∣ceeded
to throw himself at her feet, and utter a
romantic rhapsody, in the course of which,
laying aside all that restraint which he had hither∣to
preserved, he seized her delicate hand, and
pressed it to his lips; nay, so far did he forget
himself on this occasion, that he caught the fair
creature in his arms, and rudely ravished a kiss
from those lips which he had before contemplated
with the most distant reverence of desire.</P>
<P>Having thus broken down the fences of deco∣rum,
and being heated with transport, he, in all
probability, would have acted the part of young
Tarquin, and violated, by force, that sacred
shrine of honour, beauty, and unblemished truth,
had not the wrath kindled by such an unexpected
outrage, inspired her with strength and spirits suf∣ficient
to protect her virtue, and intimidate the
ruffian who could offer violence to such perfection.
She broke from his detested embrace, with sur∣prising
agility, and called aloud to her landlady
for assistance; but that discreet mation was re∣solved
to hear nothing, and Fathom's appetite
being whetted to a most brutal degree of eager∣ness,
“Madam, (said he) all opposition is vain:
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
what you have refused to my intreaties, you shall
yield to my power; and I am determined to force
you to your own advantage.”</P>
<P>So saying, he sprung towards her, with the
most savage and impious intent, when this amia∣ble
heroine snatching up his sword, which lay
upon a by-table, and unsheathing it instanta∣neously,
presented the point to his breast, and
while her eyes glanced with intolerable keenness,
“Villain! (cried she) the spirit of my father
animates my bosom, and the vengeance of heaven
shall not be frustrated.” He was not so much
affected by his bodily danger, as awe-struck at
the manner of her address, and the appearance of
her aspect, which seemed to shine with something
supernatural, and actually disordered his whole
faculties, insomuch that he retreated without at∣tempting
to make the least reply; and she having
secured the door after his departure, sat down to
ponder upon this shocking event.</P>
<P>Words are wanting to describe the accumu∣lated
horrors that took possession of her mind,
when she thus beheld all her presaging fears rea∣lized,
and found herself at the mercy of two
wretches, who had now pulled off the mask, after
having lost all sentiments of humanity. Common
affliction was an agreeable reverie to what she
suffered, deprived of her parents, exiled from her
friends and country, reduced to the brink of
wanting the most indispensable nec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssaries of life,
in a foreign land, where she knew not one per∣son
to whose protection she could have recourse,
from the inexpressible woes that environed her:
she complained to heaven, that her life was pro∣tracted
for the augmentation of that misery which
was already too severe to be endured; for she
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
shuddered at the prospect of being utterly aban∣doned
in the last stage of mortality, without one
friend to close her eyes, or do the last offices of
humanity to her breathless coarse. These were
dreadful reflections to a young lady who had been
born to affluence and splendor, trained up in all
the elegance of education, by nature fraught with
that sensibility which refines the sentiment and
taste, and so tenderly cherished by her indulgent
parents, that <HI>they suffered not the winds of heaven
to visit her face too roughly.</HI></P>
<P>Having passed the night in such agony, she
rose at day-break, and hearing the chapel bell toll
for morning prayers, resolved to go to this place
of worship, in order to implore the assistance of
heaven: she no sooner opened her chamber door,
with this intent, than she was met by Madam
la Mer, who after having professed her concern
for what had happened over night, and imputed
Mr. Fathom's rudeness to the spirit of intoxica∣tion,
by which she had never before seen him
possessed, she endeavoured to dissuade Monimia
from her purpose, by observing, that her health
would be prejudiced by the cold morning air; but
finding her determined, she insisted upon accom∣panying
her to chapel, on pretence of respect,
though, in reality, with a view to prevent the
escape of her beauteous lodger. Thus attended,
the hapless mourner entered the place, and ac∣cording
to the laudable hospitality of England,
which is the only country in Christendom, where
a stranger is not made welcome to the house of
God; this amiable creature, emaciated and en∣feebled
as she was, must have stood in a common
passage, during the whole service, had not she
been perceived by a humane gentlewoman, who,
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
struck with her beauty and dignified air, and
melted with sympathy, at the ineffable sorrow
which was visible in her countenance, opened the
pew in which she sat, and accommodated Moni∣mia
and her attendant: if she was captivated by
her first appearance, she was not less affected by
the deportment of her fair guest, which was the
pattern of genuine devotion.</P>
<P>In a word, this good lady, who was a mer∣chant's
widow in opulent circumstances, was in∣flamed
with a longing desire to know and be∣friend
the amiable stranger, who, after service,
turning about to thank her for her civility, Ma∣dam
Clement, with that frankness which is the
result of true benevolence, told her, she was too
much prepossessed in her favour, to let slip this
opportunity of craving her acquaintance, and of
expressing her inclination to alleviate (if possible)
that affliction which was manifest in her looks.</P>
<P>Monimia, overwhelmed with gratitude and
surprize, at this unexpected address, gazed upon
the lady in silence, and when she repeated her
tenders of service, could make no other reply to
her goodness, than by bursting into a flood of
tears: this was a species of eloquence, which did
not pass unregarded by Madam Clement, who,
while her own eyes were bedewed with the drops
of sympathy and compassion, took the lovely or∣phan
by the hand, and led her, without further
ceremony, to her own coach, that stood waiting
at the door, whither they were followed by Mrs.
La Mer, who was so much confounded at the ad∣venture,
that she made no objections to the pro∣posal
of the lady who handed her lodger into the
carriage; but retired, with all possible dispatch,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
to make Fathom acquainted with this unforeseen
event.</P>
<P>Mean while, the agitation of Monimia, at
this providential deliverance, was such as had well
nigh destroyed her tender frame: the blood flush∣ed
and forsook her cheeks by turns; she trem∣bled
from head to foot, notwithstanding the con∣solatory
assurances of Madam Clement, and,
without being able to utter one word, was con∣ducted
to the house of that kind benefactress,
where the violence of her transports overpowered
her constitution, and she sunk down upon a coach
in a swoon, from which she was not easily reco∣vered.
This affecting circumstance augmented
the pity, and interested the curiosity of Madam
Clement, who concluded there was something
very extraordinary in the case of the stranger, to
produce these agonies; and grew impatient to
hear the particulars of her story.</P>
<P>Monimia no sooner retrieved the use of her fa∣culties,
than looking around, and observing with
what humane concern her new hostess was em∣ployed
in effecting her recovery, “Is this (said
she) a flattering illusion of the brain? or am I
really under the protection of some beneficent
being, whom heaven hath inspired with generosi∣ty,
to rescue an hapless stranger from the most
forlorn state of misery and woe?” Her voice
was, at all times, ravishingly sweet; and this ex∣clamation
was pronounced with such pathetic fer∣vour,
that Madam Clement clasped her in her
arms, and kissing her with all the eagerness of
maternal affection, “Yes, (cried she) fair crea∣ture,
heaven hath bestowed upon me an heart to
compassionate, and power, I hope, to lighten the
burthen of your sorrows.”</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116"/>
She then prevailed upon her to take some nou∣rishment,
and afterwards to recount the particu∣lars
of her fate; a task she performed with such
accuracy and candour, that Madam Clement,
far from suspecting her sincerity, saw truth and
conviction in every circumstance of her tale;
and having condoled her misfortunes, entreated
her to forget them, or, at least, look upon herself
as one sheltered under the care and tuition of a
person, whose study it would be to supply her
want of natural parents. This would have been
an happy vicissitude of fortune, had it not arrived
too late; but such a sudden and unlooked-for
transition, not only disordered the faculties of
poor Monimia's mind, but also overp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wered the
organs of her body, already fatigued and enfee∣bled
by the distresses she had undergone; so that
she was taken ill of a fever that same night, and
became delirious before morning, when a physi∣cian
was called to her assistance.</P>
<P>While this gentleman was in the house, Ma∣dam
Clement was visited by Fathom, who after
having complained, in the most insinuating man∣ner,
that she had encouraged his wife to abandon
her duty, told her a plausible story of his first ac∣quaintance
with Monimia, and his marriage at
the Fleet, which, he said, he was ready to prove,
by the evidence of the clergyman who joined
them, and that of Mrs. la Mer, who was present
at the ceremony. The good lady, although a
little staggered at the genteel appearance, and en∣gaging
address of this stranger, could not prevail
upon herself to believe that she had been imposed
upon by her fair lodger, who, by this time, had
given too convincing a proof of her sincerity
nevertheless, in order to prevent any dispute th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
might be prejudicial to the health or recovery of
Monimia, she gave him to understand, that she
would not, at present, enter upon the merits of
the cause, but only assure him, that the young
lady was actually bereft of her senses, and in im∣minent
danger of her life: for the truth of which
assertions she would appeal to his own observa∣tion,
and the opinion of the physician, who was
then employ'd in writing a prescription for the
cure of her disease.</P>
<P>So saying, she conducted him into the cham∣ber,
where he beheld the hapless virgin stretched
upon a sick bed, panting under the violence of a
distemper too mighty for her weakly frame, her
hair dishevelled, and discomposure in her looks;
all the roses of her youth were faded, yet all the
graces of her beauty were not fled: she retained
that sweetness and symmetry, which death itself
could not destroy; and though her discourse was
incoherent, her voice was still musical, resembling
those feathered songsters who <HI>warble their native
wood-notes wild.</HI></P>
<P>Fathom, as upon all other occasions, so on
this, did behave like an inimitable actor; he ran
to the bed-side, with all the trepidation of a di∣stracted
lover; he fell upon his knees, and while
the tears rolled down his cheeks, imprinted a thou∣sand
kisses on the soft hand of Monimia, who re∣garding
him with a lack lustre, and undistinguish∣ing
eye, “Alas! Renaldo, (said she) we were
born to be unhappy.” “Would to heaven!
(cried Ferdinand, in a transport of grief) the
wretch Renaldo had never been born! that is the
villain who seduced the affection of this unfortu∣nate
woman. I admitted the traitor into my
friendship and confidence, relieved him in his
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
necessities; and, like the ungrateful viper, he
hath stung the very bosom that cherished him in
his distress. Then he proceeded to inform Ma∣dam
Clement, how he had delivered that same
Renaldo from prison, maintained him afterwards
at a great expence, and, at length, furnished him
with a sum of money, and proper credentials to
support his interest at the court of Vienna.</P>
<P>Having finished this detail, he asked the physi∣cian's
sentiments of his wife's distemper, and be∣ing
told, that her life was in extreme jeopardy,
begged he would use his utmost endeavours in her
behalf, and even made him a tender of an extra∣ordinary
fee; which was refused: he also thanked
Madam Clement for her charity and benevolence
towards a stranger, and took his leave, with many
polite professions of gratitude and esteem. He
had no sooner quitted the house, than the physi∣cian,
who was a humane man, and a foreigner,
began to caution the lady against his insinuations,
observing, that some circumstances of the story
concerning Renaldo, were, to his particular know∣ledge,
contrary to truth: for that he himself had
been applied to, for letters of recommendation,
in behalf of count Melvil, by a Jew merchant
of his acquaintance, who had supplied the young
gentleman with money sufficient for his occasions,
in consequence of a minute inquiry he had made
into the character of Renaldo, who was, by all
reports, a youth of strict honour, and untainted
morals.</P>
<P>Madam Clement, thus cautioned, entered into
deliberation with her own thoughts, and com∣paring
the particulars of this account with those
of Monimia's own story, she concluded, that Fa∣thom
was the very traitor he himself had described;
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
and that he had, by abusing the confidence of
both, effected a fatal breach between two inno∣cent
and deserving lovers. She accordingly looked
upon him with horror and detestation; but, ne∣vertheless
resolved to treat him with civility in the
mean time, that the poor young lady might not
be disturbed in her last moments; for she had
now lost all hopes of her recovery. Yet the se∣ver
abated, and in two days she retrieved the
use of her reason: though the distemper had af∣fected
her lungs, and she was in all appearance
doomed to linger a few weeks longer in a con∣sumption.</P>
<P>Fathom was punctual in his visitation, though
never admitted into her presence after the deli∣rium
vanished; and he had the opportunity of
seeing her conveyed in a chariot to Kensington
Gravel-pits, a place which may be termed the
last stage of many a mortal peregrination. He
now implicitely believed, that death would in a
few days baffle all his designs upon the unfortu∣nate
Monimia; and foreseeing, that, as he had
owned himself her husband, he might be obliged
to defray the expence incurred by her sickness and
burial, he very prudently intermitted in his visits,
and had recourse to the intelligence of his auxi∣liary.</P>
<P>As for Monimia, she approached the goal of
life; not simply with resignation, but with rap∣ture:
she enjoyed, in tranquillity, the conversa∣tion
of her kind benefactress, who never stirred
from her apartment; she was blessed with the
spiritual consolation of a worthy clergyman, who
removed all her religious scruples; and she con∣gratulated

At length Mrs. la Mer gave notice to our ad∣venturer
of this amiable young lady's decease, and
the time fixed for the interment: upon which
these two virtuous associates took possession of a
place, from whence they could, unperceived, be∣hold
the funeral. He must have a hard heart,
who, without an emotion of pity, can see the
last offices performed to a young creature cut off
in the flower of youth and beauty, even tho' he
knows not her name, and is an utter stranger to
her virtues.—How callous then must the soul of
that wretch have been, who, without a symptom
of remorse or concern, saw the sable hearse
adorned with white plumes, as emblems of Mo∣nimia's
purity, pass before him, while her incom∣parable
merit stood full in his remembrance, and
he knew himself the wicked cause of her untimely
fate!</P>
<P>Perfidious wretch! thy crimes turn out so at∣trocious,
that I half repent me of having under∣taken
to record thy memoirs: yet such monsters
ought to be exhibited to public view, that man∣kind
may be upon their guard against imposture;
that the world may see how fraud is apt to over∣shoot
itself: and that, as virtue, though it may
suffer for a while, will triumph in the end; so
iniquity, though it may prosper for a season, will
at last be overtaken by that punishment and dis∣grace
which are its due.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fathom shifts the scene, and appears in a new
character.</HEAD>
<P>FATHOM's expectations, with respect to the
fair orphan, having thus proved abortive, he
lost no time in bewailing his miscarriage, but had
immediate recourse to other means of improving
his small fortune, which, at this period, amounted
to near two hundred pounds. Whatever incli∣nation
he had to resume the character he had
formerly bore in the polite world, he durst not
venture to launch out again into the expence ne∣cessary
to maintain that station, because his for∣mer
resources were now stopt, and all the people
of fashion, by this time, convinced of his being
a needy adventurer. Nevertheless, he resolved
to sound the sentiments of his old friends at a
distance, and judge, from the reception he should
meet with, how far he might presume upon their
countenance and favour: for he rightly supposed,
that, if he could in any shape contribute to their
interest or amusement, they would easily forgive
his former pretensions to quality, arrogant as they
were, and still entertain him on the footing of a
necessary acquaintance.</P>
<P>With this view, he one day presented himself
at court in a very gay suit of cloaths, and bow∣ed,
at a distance, to many of his old fashionable
friends of both sexes, not one of whom favoured
him with any other notice, than that of a quar∣ter
curt'sy, or slight inclination of the head: for,
by this time, the few that remembered him knew
from what retirement he now emerged, and
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
avoided him accordingly as the jail infection: but
the greater part of those who had cultivated him
in the zenith of his fortune, were now utter
strangers to his person, which they had actually
forgot, amidst the succession of novelties that
surrounded them; or, if they did recollect his
name, it was remembered as an old fashion
which had been many months out of date.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these mortifying discourage∣ments,
our hero, that same evening, effected a
lodgement in a certain gaming-house not far
from St. James's; and, as he played pretty high,
and made a parade of his ready money, he was soon
recognized by divers persons of consequence, who
cordially welcomed him to England, on pretence
of believing he had been abroad, and with great
complacency, repeated their former professions of
friendship. Though this was a certain way of
retaining the favour of those worthies, while his
finances continued to flourish, and his payments
were prompt, he knew the weakness of his funds
too well, to think they could bear the vicissitudes
of play; and the remembrance of the two Bri∣tish
Knights who had spoiled him at Paris, hung
over his imagination with the most frightful pre∣sages:
besides, he perceived that gaming was
now managed in such a manner, as rendered skill
and dexterity of no advantage: for the spirit of
play having overspread the land, like a pestilence,
raged to such a degree of madness and despera∣tion,
that the unhappy people who were in∣fected,
laid aside all thoughts of amusement,
oeconomy or caution, and risqued their fortunes
upon issues equally extravagant, childish, and
absurd.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123"/>
The whole mystery of the art was reduced to
the simple exercise of tossing up a guinea, and
the lust of laying wagers, which they indulged
to a surprising pitch of ridiculous intemperance.
In one corner of the room might be heard a pair
of lordlings running their grandmothers against
each other, that is, betting sums on the longest
liver; in another, the success of the wager de∣pended
upon the sex of the landlady's next child;
and one of the waiters happening to drop down
in an apoplectic fit, a certain noble peer exclaim∣ed,
“Dead for a thousand pounds.” The chal∣lenge
was immediately accepted; and when the
master of the house sent for a surgeon to attempt
the cure, the nobleman who set the price upon
the patient's head, insisted upon his being left to
the efforts of nature alone, otherwise the wager
should be void: nay, when the landlord harped
upon the loss he should sustain by the death of
a trusty servant, his lordship obviated the objecti∣on,
by desiring that the fellow might be charged
in the bill.</P>
<P>In short, the rage of gaming seemed to have
devoured all their other faculties, and to have
equalled the rash enthusiasm of the inhabitants
of Malacca in the East-Indies, who are so pos∣sessed
with that pernicious spirit, that they sacrifice
to it not only their fortunes, but also their wives
and children; and then letting their hair down
upon their shoulders, in imitation of the ancient
Lacedemonians when they devoted themselves to
death, those wretches unsheath their daggers and
murder every living creature in their way. In
this, however, they differ from the gamesters of
our country, who never find their senses, until
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
they have lost their fortune, and beggared their
families; whereas, the the Malayse never <HI>run
a muck,</HI> but in consequence of misery and de∣spair.</P>
<P>Such are the amusements, or rather, such is
the continual employment of those hopeful youths
who are destined by birth to be the judges of our
property, and pillars of our constitution: such
are the heirs and representatives of those patriots
who planned, and those heroes who maintained
the laws and freedom of their country; who
were the patrons of merit, the fathers of the
poor, the terror of vice and immorality, and, at
once, the ornaments and support of an happy
nation.</P>
<P>Our adventurer considered all these circum∣stances
with his wonted sagacity, and seeing up∣on
what precarious sooting he must stand, should
he rank himself with such society, he wisely came
to the resolution of descending one step in the de∣grees
of life, and of taking upon him the title of
physician, under which he did not despair of in∣sinuating
himself into the pockets of his patients,
and into the secrets of private families, so as to
acquire a comfortable share of practice, or capti∣vate
the heart of some heiress or rich widow,
whose fortune would, at once, render him inde∣pendent
and happy.</P>
<P>After this determination, his next care was, to
concert measures for his first appearance in this
new character; well knowing, that the success
of a physician, in a great measure, depends up∣on
the external equipage in which he first de∣clares
himself an adept in the healing art. He
first of all procured a few books on the subject
of medicine, which he studied with great atten∣tion,
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
during the remaining part of the winter and
spring, and repaired to Tunbridge with the first
of the season, where he appeared in the uniform
of Aesculapius, namely, a plain suit full trimm'd,
with a voluminous tye perriwig; believing that,
in this place, he might glide, as it were, imper∣ceptibly,
into the functions of his new employ∣ment,
and gradually accustom himself to the me∣thod
and form of prescription.</P>
<P>A man so well known in the gay world could
not be supposed to effect such a transformation,
without being observed; and therefore, in order
to anticipate the censure and ridicule of those
who might be tempted to make themselves merry
at his expence, he, on his arrival at the wells, re∣paired
to the shop of an apothecary, and, calling
for pen, ink and paper, wrote a prescription,
which he desired might be immediately made up.
While this was doing by the servant, he was in∣vited
into a parlour by the master, with whom
he entered into conversation, touching the pro∣perties
of the Tunbridge-water, which seemed
to have been his particular study: and indeed he
had perused Rouzee's treatise on that subject,
with indefatigable assiduity. From this theme,
he made digressions into other parts of medicine,
upon which he spoke with such plausible elocution,
that the apothecary, whose knowledge in that art
was not very profound, looked upon him as a
physician of great learning and experience, and
hinted a desire of knowing his name and situ∣ation.</P>
<P>Fathom accordingly gave him to understand,
that he had studied physic, and had taken his de∣grees
at Padua, rather for his amusement, than
with any view of exercising medicine, as he then
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
could not possibly foresee the misfortunes which
had since happened to his family, and by which
he was now compelled to have recourse to a pro∣fession
that was very much beneath the expec∣tations
of his birth. Yet he bore his disappoint∣ments
with resignation, and even good humour,
and blessed his stars for having inclined him to
the study of any branch of knowledge by which
he might be enabled to laugh at the vicissitudes
of fortune. He then observed, that he had prac∣tised
with some applause at the hot-well, near
Bristol, before he thought he should be ever re∣duced
to the necessity of taking a fee; and that,
in all probability, his metamorphosis, when known,
would furnish matter of surprise and merriment
to some of his old acquaintance.</P>
<P>The apothecary was equally struck with his
polite address, and pleased with his agreeable dis∣course:
he consoled him for the misfortunes of
his family, by assuring him, that, in England,
nothing could be more honourable, or indeed pro∣fitable,
than the character of a physician, pro∣vided
he could once wriggle himself into prac∣tice;
and insinuated, that, although he was re∣stricted
by certain engagements with other per∣sons
of the faculty, he should be glad of an op∣portunity
to shew his regard for doctor Fathom.
This was a very effectual method which our hero
took to intimate his new character to the the public.
By the industry and communicative disposition of
the apothecary, it was criculated in half a day thro'
every family in the place; and next morning,
when Ferdinand appeared, the company forth∣with
assembled in separate groups, and from
each knot he heard his name reverberated in a
whisper.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127"/>
Having thus announced himself to all whom
it might concern, and allowed the ladies two days
to discuss the merit of his transfiguration, toge∣ther
with the novelty of the case, he ventured to
salute, at a distance, a lady and her daughter,
who had been his patients at the hot-well; and
although they honoured his bow with the return
of a slight curtsy, they gave him not the least en∣couragement
to make a nearer approach. Not∣withstanding
this rebuff, he concluded, that,
should the health of either come in question,
they would renew their application to his skill,
and what was refused by their pride, would be
granted by their apprehension. Here, however,
he happened to be mistaken in his conjecture.</P>
<P>The young lady being seized with a violent
head-ach and palpitation, her mother desired the
apothecary to recommend a physician; and the
person, with whom he was contracted, being at
that time absent, he proposed doctor Fathom as
a man of great ability and discretion: but the
good lady rejected the proposal with disdain, be∣cause
she had formerly known him in the charac∣ter
of a Count; though that very character was
the chief reason that had then induced her to crave
his advice.</P>
<P>Such is the caprice of the world in general,
that whatever bears the face of novelty captivates,
or rather bewitches the imagination, and con∣founds
the ideas of reason and common sense.
If, for example, a scullion from the clinking of
pewter should conceive a taste for the clinking
of rhime, and make shift to bring together twenty
syllables, so as that the tenth and last shall have
the like ending; the composition is immediately
extolled as a miracle; and what appeals to the
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
admiration, is not the wit, the elegance or
poetry of the work, but the uncultivated talen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and humble station of the author. A reader does
not exclaim, “What a delicate sentiment! what
a beautiful simile! what easy and musical versifi∣cation!”
but cries in rapture, “Heavens! what
a prodigy! a poet from the scullery! a muse in
livery! or, Apollo with a trowel!”—The public
is astonished into liberality—the scullion eats from
those trenchers he scoured before—the footman is
admitted into the coach, behind which he was
wont to stand; and the bricklayer, instead of
plaistering walls, bedaubs his <HI>illustrious part'ner</HI>
with the mortar of his praise. Thus, lifted into
an higher sphere, their talents receive cultivation;
they become professed bards; and tho' their sub∣sequent
works bear evident marks of improve∣ment,
they are neglected among the rest of their
brethren; because that novelty, which recom∣mended
them in the beginning, no longer re∣mains.</P>
<P>So it fared with our adventurer in his new oc∣cupation.
There was something so extraordinary
in a nobleman's understanding medicine; and so
uncommon in a physician's prescribing gratis,
that the curiosity and admiration of the company
at Bristol were engaged, and they followed his
advice, as the direction of some supernatural in∣telligence:
but, now that he professed himself one
of the faculty, and might be supposed to have re∣freshed
his memory, and reinforced his know∣ledge
for the occasion, he was as much over∣looked
as any other physician unsupported by in∣terest
or cabal; or, at least, the notice he at∣tracted
was not at all to the advantage of his
character, because it wholly regarded the decline
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
of his fortune, which is a never-failing fund of
disgrace.</P>
<P>These mortifications did not overcome the
patience and perseverance of Fathom, who fore∣saw
that the soothing hand of time would cast a
veil of oblivion over those scenes which were re∣membered
to his prejudice; and that in the
mean time, though he was excluded from the
private parties of the fair sex, in which his main
hope of success was placed, he should be able to
insinuate himself into some degree of favour and
practice among the male patients; and some lucky
cure, properly displayed, might be the means of
propagating his fame, and banishing that reserve
which at present interfered with his purpose.
Accordingly, it was not long before he found
means to break that spell of universal prejudice
that hedged him in. At the ordinary which he
frequented, his polite carriage, facetious remarks,
and agreeable stories, soon conciliated the regard
of his fellow guests, among whom he sometimes
rallied his own transformation with singular good
humour and success: he was even witty upon his
want of employment; and used to observe, that
a physician, without practice, had one comfort
to which his brethren were strangers, namely,
that the seldomer he had occasion to prescribe,
the less he had upon his conscience on account
of being accessory to the death of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>Nothing so effectually blunts the shafts of ridi∣cule,
and defeats the aims of slander, as this me∣thod
of anticipation. In spite of the arrows that
were levelled against his reputation from every
tea-table at Tunbridge, he made his party good
among almost all the gay young gentlemen that
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
frequented the place: far from avoiding his
company, they began to court his conversation,
and he was commonly seen in the walks, sur∣rounded
with a group of admirers.</P>
<P>Having thus paved the way for a total removal
of the invidious prepossession that obstructed his
views, he, one night, while every person was
lulled in the arms of repose, and universal silence
prevailed, tuned his violin, and began to play
some masterly airs, in a tone so uncommonly ex∣pressive,
and with such ravishing dexterity of exe∣cution,
that a certain lady who lodged in the
same house, being waked by the music, and ig∣norant
of the source from which it flowed, list∣ened
with rapture, as to the harp of an angel,
and wrapping herself in a loose gown, rose and
opened her chamber-door, in order to discover
in what apartment the musician resided. She
no sooner entered the passage, than she found
her fellow-lodgers already assembled on the same
occasion; and there they remained during the
best part of the night, transported by the harmo∣ny
which our hero produced.</P>
<P>Doctor Fathom was immediately known to be
the author of this entertainment; and thus re∣trieved
the benefit of that admiration which he
had forfeited by appearing in the shape of a phy∣sician.
For, as people had formerly wondered
to see a Count skilled in medicine; they were
now amazed to find a physician such a master in
music.</P>
<P>The good effects of this stratagem were almost
instantaneous. His performance became the to∣pic
of discourse among all the fashionable com∣pany:
his male friends complimented him from
the information of the other sex; and that lady
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
whom he had regaled, instead of that shyness and
disdain with which she used to receive his salu∣tation,
at their very next meeting in the thorough∣fare,
returned his bow with marks of profound
respect. Nay, at midnight, she, with the rest,
took post in the same place where they had been
stationed before; and by frequent tittering, and
repeated whispers, gave intimation to Fathom,
that they would be glad of a second serenade.
But he was too well acquainted with the human
passions to indulge this their desire: it was his
interest to inflame their impatience, rather than
to gratify their expectation: and therefore he
tantalized them for some hours, by tuning his
violin, and playing some flourishes, which,
however, produced nothing to fulfil their
wishes.</P>
<P>At the ordinary, he was accosted by a gentle∣man
a lodger in the same house, who assured
him, that the ladies would take it as a great
favour, if he would let them know when he
intended to amuse himself again with his in∣strument,
that they might not, by falling asleep
before-hand, deprive themselves of the pleasure
of hearing his music. To this message he re∣plied
with an air of consequence and reserve,
that, though music was not the art he professed,
he should be always complaisant enough to en∣tertain
the ladies to the utmost of his power,
when their commands were signified to him in
a manner suited to his character; but that he
would never put himself on the footing of an
itinerant harper, whose music is tolerated thro'
the medium of a board partition. The gentleman
having reported this answer to his constituents,
they empowered him to invite doctor Fathom to
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
breakfast, and he was next morning introduced
with the usual ceremony, and treated with un∣common
regard by all the females of the house,
assembled for his reception.</P>
<P>Having thus broke the ice of their aversion, in
one part, so as that the beams of his personal
accomplishment had room to operate, he soon
effected a general thaw in his favour, and found
himself growing once more into request among
the most amiable part of the creation. His com∣pany
was coveted, and his taste consulted in their
balls, concerts, and private assemblies; and he
recompenced the regard they paid to him, with
an incessant exertion of his agreeable talents,
politeness and good humour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Triumphs over a medical rival.</HEAD>
<P>YET, in the midst of all this attention, his
medical capacity seemed to be quite forgot.
They respected his good breeding; were charmed
with his voice, and admired the fine touches of
his hand upon the violin; but, in cultivating the
fidler, they utterly neglected the physician; and
in vain did he attempt to divide their regard, by
taking all opportunities to turn the conversation
into a more interesting channel. It was to little
purpose he endeavoured to arrouse the wonder of
his audience with frequent descriptions of porten∣tuous
maladies and amazing cures he had seen
and performed in the course of his study and prac∣tice
abroad: and to no effect did he publickly
busy himself in making experiments on the mine∣ral
water, in which he pretended to have made
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
several new and important discoveries. These
efforts did not make a lasting impression upon the
minds of the company; because they saw nothing
surprizing in a physician's being acquainted with
all the mysteries of his art; and, as their custom
was already bespoke for others of the profession,
whom it was their interest to employ, our adven∣turer
might have starved amidst the caresses of his
acquaintance, had not he derived considerable
advantage from a lucky accident in the course of
his expectancy.</P>
<P>A gentlewoman's daughter, of a weakly con∣stitution,
by drinking the waters, had so far re∣covered
her health and complexion, as to allure
the affection of a young squire in the neighbour∣hood,
who amused her for some time with his
addresses, until his heart was seduced by the
charms of another young lady lately arrived at the
wells. The forsaken nymph, shocked at this dis∣grace
and mortification, relapsed into her former
languishing disorder, and was by her mother put
under the management and prescription of a phy∣sician,
who had been an industrious enemy of Fa∣thom,
from his first appearance at Tunbridge.
The patient, tho' violently chagrined at the levi∣ty
of her quondam admirer, was not altogether
without hope, that the very same inconstancy
which had prompted him to leave her, might in
time induce him to return, after the novelty of
his new passion should be wore off; and this
hope served to support her under the sorrow and
disgrace of her disappointment. At length, how∣ever,
the squire and his new mistress disappear∣ed,
and some busy body was officious enough to
communicate this piece of news to the forlorn
shepherdess, with this additional circumstance, that
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
they were gone to a neighbouring parish, to be
joined in the bands of wedlock.</P>
<P>These fatal tidings were no sooner imparted to
the abandoned Phillis, than she was seized with
an hysteric fit; and, what rendered the accident
more unfortunate, her physician had been called
to the country, and was not expected at Tun∣bridge
'till next day. The apothecary was im∣mediately
summoned; and, being either puzzled
by the symptoms, or afraid of encroaching upon
the province of his superiors, advised the old lady
to send for doctor Fathom without delay. She
had no other objection to this expedient, but the
enmity which she knew subsisted between the two
leeches: yet hearing that her own doctor would
not consult with Fathom upon his return, but,
perhaps, renounce the patient, by which means
her daughter's health might be endangered, she
would not sollicit our hero's assistance, until the
young lady had remained seven hours speechless
and insensible; when her fear prevailing over
every other consideration, she implored the ad∣vice
of our adventurer, who having made the
necessary interrogations, and felt the patient's
pulse, which was regular and distinct, found
reason to conclude, that the fit would not last
much longer; and, after having observed, that
she was in a very dangerous way, prescribed
some medicines for external application; and,
to enhance their opinion of his diligence and
humanity, resolved to stay in the room, and ob∣serve
their effect.</P>
<P>His judgment did not fail him on this occasi∣on.
In less than half an hour after his embro∣cations
had been applied, she recovered the use of
her tongue, opened her eyes, and having in deli∣rious
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
exclamations, upbraided her perfidious lo∣ver,
became quite sensible and composed; though
she continued extremely low and dejected: to re∣medy
these sinkings, certain cordials were imme∣diately
administered, according to the prescription
of doctor Fathom, upon whom extraordinary en∣comiums
were bestowed by all present, who be∣lieved
he had actually rescued her from the jaws
of death; and as he was, by this time, let into
the secrets of the family, he found himself in a
fair way of being an egregious favourite of the
old gentlewoman; when, unluckly, his brother
having dismissed his country patient with uncom∣mon
dispatch, entered the apartment, and eyed
his rival with looks of inexpressible rage; then
surveying the patient, and the vials that stood
upon the table, by turns, “What, in the name
of God! (cried he) is the meaning of all this
trash?”</P>
<P>“Really, doctor, (replied the mother, a little
counfounded at being thus taken by surprize)
Biddy has been taken dangerously ill, and lain
seven or eight hours in a severe fit, from which,
I am confident, she would never have recovered,
without the help of a physician; and as you were
absent, we had recourse to this gentleman, whose
prescription hath had an happy and surprising ef∣fect.”
“Effect! (cried this offended member
of the faculty) pshaw! stuff, who made you judge
of effects or causes? (then advancing to the pa∣tient)
what has been the matter, miss Biddy, that
you could not wait till my return?”</P>
<P>Here Fathom interposing, “Sir, (said he) if
you will step into the next room, I will commu∣nicate
my sentiments of the case, together with
the method upon which I have proceeded, that
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
we may deliberate upon the next step that is to be
taken.” Instead of complying with this proposal,
he seated himself in a chair, with his back to our
adventurer, and while he examined miss Biddy's
pulse, gave him to understand, that he should not
consult with him about the matter.</P>
<P>Fathom, not in the least disconcerted at this
uncivil answer, walked round his antagonist, and
placing himself in his front, desired to know his
reason for treating him with such supercilious con∣tempt.
“I am resolved (said the other) never
to consult with any physician who has not taken
his degrees at either of the English universities.”
“Upon the supposition (replied our adventurer)
that no person can be properly educated for the
profession at any other school.” “You are in
the right: (answered doctor Looby) that is one
of many reasons I have to decline the consulta∣tion.”</P>
<P>“How far you are in the right, (retorted Fa∣thom)
I leave the world to judge, after I have
observed, that in your English universities, there
is no opportunity of studying the art; no, not so
much as a lecture given on the subject: nor is
there one physician of note, in this kingdom,
who has not derived the greatest part of his me∣dical
knowledge, from the instructions of fo∣reigners.”</P>
<P>Looby, incensed at this asseveration, which he
was not prepared to refute, exclaimed in a most
infuriate accent, “Who are you? whence came
you? where was you bred? you are one of those,
I believe, who graduate themselves, and com∣mence
doctors, the Lord knows how: an inter∣loper,
who, without license or authority, come
hither to take the bread out of the mouths of gen∣tlemen,
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
who have been trained to the business in
a regular manner, and bestowed great pains and
expence to qualify themselves for the profession:
for my own part, my education cost me fifteen
hundred pounds.”</P>
<P>“Never was money laid out to less purpose:
(said Ferdinand) for it does not appear, that you
have learned so much as the basis of medical ac∣quirements,
namely, that decorum and urbanity
which ought to distinguish the deportment of eve∣ry
physician: you have even debased the noblest
and most beneficial art that ever engaged the stu∣dy
of mankind, which cannot be too much culti∣vated,
and too little restrained, in seeking to li∣mit
the practice of it, to a set of narrow-minded
illiberal wretches, who, like the lowest handi∣craftsmen,
claim the exclusive privileges of a cor∣poration:
had you doubted my ability, you ought
to have satisfied yourself in a manner consistent
with decency and candour: but your behaviour,
on this occasion, is such a malicious outrage upon
good manners and humanity, that, were it not
for my regard to these ladies, I would chastise
you for your insolence, on the spot. Mean while,
madam, (addressing himself to the mother) you
must give me leave to insist upon your dismissing
either that gentleman, or me, without hesita∣tion.”</P>
<P>This peremptory language had an instantaneous
effect upon the hearers. Looby's face grew pale,
and his nether lip began to tremble: the patient
was dismayed, and the old gentlewoman con∣cerned
and perplexed: she earnestly besought the
gentlemen to be-reconciled to each other, and
enter into a friendly consultation upon her daugh∣ter's
distemper: but, finding both equally averse
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
to accommodation, and Fathom becoming more
and more importunate in his demand, she pre∣sented
him with a double fee; and giving him to
understand, that doctor Looby had long attended
the family, and was intimately acquainted with
her own and Biddy's constitution, said, she hoped
he would not take it amiss, if she retained her
old physician.</P>
<P>Though our hero was much mortified at this
triumph of his rival, he made a virtue of necessi∣ty,
and retired with great complaisance, wishing,
that Miss Biddy might never again be the subject
of such a disagreeable dispute. Whether the pa∣tient
was frighted at this altercation, or displeased
with her mother's decision against an agreeable
young fellow, who had, as it were, recalled her
from the grave, and made himself master of the
secret that rankled at her heart; or the disease
had wound up her nerves for another paroxysm;
certain it is, she, all of a sudden, broke forth in∣to
a violent peal of laughter, which was succeed∣ed
by the most doleful cries, and other expressions
of grief; then she relapsed into a fit, attended
with strong convulsions, to the unspeakable terror
of the old gentlewoman, who intreated doctor
Looby to be expeditious in his prescription: ac∣cordingly,
he seized the pen with great confi∣dence,
and a whole magazine of anti-hysteric
medicines were, in different forms, externally
and internally applied.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, either nature was disturbed, in
her own efforts, by these applications, or the
patient was resolved to disgrace the doctor:
for the more remedies that were administered,
her convulsions became the more violent; and in
spite of all his endeavours, he could not over∣come
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
the obstinacy of the distemper. Such a
miscarriage upon the back of his rival's success,
could not fail to overwhelm him with confusion;
especially as the mother baited him with repeated
intreaties, to do something for the recovery of her
daughter: at length, after having exercised her
patience in vain, for several hours, this affectio∣nate
parent could no longer suppress the sug∣gestions
of her concern, but, in an incoherent
strain, told him, that her duty would not suffer
her to be longer silent in an affair on which de∣pended
the life of her dear child: that she had
seen enough, to believe he had mistaken the case
of poor Biddy, and he could not justly blame her
for recalling doctor Fathom, whose prescription
had operated in a miraculous manner.</P>
<P>Looby, shocked at this proposal, protested
against it with great vehemence, as an expedient
highly injurious to himself. “My remedies
(said he) are just beginning to take effect, and,
in all probability, the fit will not last much longer;
so that by calling in another person, at this junc∣ture,
you will defraud me of that credit which is
my due, and deck my adversary with trophies, to
which he has no pretension.” She was prevailed
upon, by this remonstrance, to wait another half
hour, when perceiving, as yet, no alteration for
the better, and being distracted with her fears,
which reproached her with want of natural affec∣tion,
she sent a message to doctor Fathom, de∣siring
to see him with all possible dispatch.</P>
<P>He was not slow in obeying the call, but ha∣stening
to the scene of action, was not a little
surprised to find Looby still in the apartment.
This gentleman, since better might not be, re∣solved
to sacrifice his pride to his interest, and,
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
rather than lose his patient altogether, and run
the risque of forfeiting his reputation at the same
time, staid with intention to compromise his dif∣ference
with Fathom, that he might not be whol∣ly
excluded from the honour of the cure, in case
it could be effected: but he had reckoned with∣out
his host, in his calculation of the count's pla∣cability;
for when he put on his capitulating
face, and after a slight apology for his late beha∣viour,
proposed that all animosity should subside
in favour of the young lady, whose life was at
stake, our hero rejected his advances with infinite
disdain, and assured the mother, in a very solemn
tone, that, far from consulting with a man who
had treated him so unworthily, he would not stay
another minute in the house, unless he should see
him discarded: a satisfaction barely sufficient to
attone for the affront he himself had suffered by
the unjust preference she had before given to his
rival.</P>
<P>There was no remedy: Looby was obliged to
retreat in his turn; then our adventurer approach∣ing
the bed-side, reconnoitered the patient, exa∣mined
the medicines which had been administered,
and lifting up his eyes in expressive silence, de∣tached
the footman with a new order to the apo∣thecary.
It was well the messenger used expedi∣tion,
otherwise doctor Fathom would have been
anticipated by the operation of nature; for, the
fit having almost run its carreer, miss Biddy was
on the point of retrieving her senses, when the
frontal prescribed by Fathom was applied; to the
efficacy of this, therefore, was ascribed her reco∣very,
when she opened her eyes, and began to
pour forth unconnected ejaculations; and in a
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
few moments after, she was persuaded to swallow
a draught prepared for the purpose, her percep∣tion
returned, and Ferdinand gained the reputa∣tion
of having performed a second miracle.</P>
<P>But he was furnished with a piece of intelli∣gence,
of much more energy than all she had ta∣ken,
and so soon as he concluded she was capable
to bear the news, without any dangerous emo∣tion,
he, among other articles of chit-chat, culled
for her amusement, took the opportunity of tel∣ling
the company, that 'squire Stub (the cause of
miss Biddy's disorder) had, in his way to matri∣mony,
been robbed of his bride, by a gentleman
to whom she had been formerly engaged. He
had waited for her, on purpose, at an inn on the
road, where he found means to appease her dis∣pleasure,
which he had, it seems, incurred, and
to supersede her new lover, whom she quitted
without ceremony; upon which the 'squire had
returned to Tunbridge, cursing her levity, yet
blessing his good stars for having so seasonably
prevented his ruin, which would have infallibly
been the consequence of his marrying such an ad∣venturer.</P>
<P>It would be fupersluous to observe, that these
tidings operated, like an admirable specifick, on
the spirits of the young lady, who, while she af∣fected
to pity the 'squire, was so much overjoyed
at his disappointment, that her eyes began to
sparkle with uncommon vivacity, and in less than
two hours after the last of those terrible attacks,
she was restored to a better state of health than
she had enjoyed for many weeks. Fathom was
not forgot amidst the rejoicings of the family:
besides an handsome gratuity for the effects of his
extraordinary skill, the old lady favoured him with
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
a general invitation to her house, and the daugh∣ter
not only considered him as the restorer of her
health, and angel of her good fortune, but also
began to discover an uncommon relish for his
conversation; so that he was struck with the pro∣spect
of succeeding 'squire Stub in her affection:
a conquest, which, if sanctioned by the approba∣tion
of the mother, would console him for all the
disappointments he had sustained; for Miss Biddy
was intitled to a fortune of ten thousand pounds,
provided she should marry with the consent of
her parent, who was the sole executrix of the sa∣ther's
will.</P>
<P>Animated with the hope of such an advanta∣geous
match, our adventurer missed no opportu∣nity
of improving the lodgement he had made;
while the two ladies failed not to extol his medical
capacity, among all their female acquaintance.
By means of this circulation, his advice was de∣manded
in several other cases, which he managed
with such an imposing air of sagacity and im∣portance,
that his fame began to spread, and be∣fore
the end of the season, he had ravished more
than one half of the business from his competi∣tor.
Notwithstanding these fortunate events, he
foresaw, that he should find great difficulty in
transplanting his reputation, so as to take root in
London, which was the only soil in which he
could propose to rise to any degree of prosperity
and independance; and this reflection was ground∣ed
upon a maxim which universally prevails among
the English people, namely, to overlook and
wholly neglect, on their return to the metropolis,
all the connexions they may have chanced to ac∣quire
during their residence at any of the medical
wells: and this social disposition is so scrupulously
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
maintained, that two persons who lived in the
most intimate correspondence at Bath or Tun∣bridge,
shall, in four and twenty hours, so totally
forget their friendship, as to meet in St. James's
park, without betraying the least token of recog∣nition;
so that one would imagine those mineral
waters were so many streams issuing from the ri∣ver
<HI>Lethe,</HI> so famed of old, for washing away all
traces of memory and recollection.</P>
<P>Aware of this oblivious principle, doctor Fa∣thom
collected all his qualifications, in order to
make such an impression upon the heart of Miss
Biddy, as would resist all her endeavours to shake
him from her remembrance; and his efforts suc∣ceeded
so well, that 'squire Stub's advances to a
reconciliation, were treated with manifest indif∣ference.
In all probability, our hero would have
made a very advantageous campaign, had not his
good fortune been retarded by an obstruction,
which (as he did not perceive it) he could not
possibly surmount: in displaying his accomplish∣ments
to captivate the daughter, he had unwit∣tingly
made an absolute conquest of the mother,
who superintended the conduct of Miss Biddy,
with such jealous vigilance, that he could find no
opportunity of profiting by the progress he had
made in her heart; for the careful matron would
never lose sight of her, no, not for one mo∣ment.</P>
<P>Had the old lady given the least intimation to
our adventurer, of the sentiments she entertained
in his behalf, his complaisance was of such a plia∣ble
texture, that he would have quitted his other
pursuit, and made her the sole object of his atten∣tion:
but she either depended upon the effect of
his own good taste and discernment, or was too
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
Proud to disclose a passion which he had hitherto
overlooked.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="52" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Repairs to the Metropolis, and enrols himself among
the sons of Paean.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE this affair could be brought to a
proper explanation, the season being almost
ended, the ladies departed from Tunbridge, and
in a little time doctor Fathom followed them to
London, having previously obtained permission to
visit them in that metropolis. He had sollicited
the same favour of some other families, in which
he hoped to take root, though he knew they were
pre-engaged to different physicians; and resolving
to make his first medical appearance in London,
with some <HI>eclat,</HI> he not only purchased an old
chariot, which was new painted for the purpose,
but likewise hired a footman, whom he cloathed
in laced livery, in order to distinguish himself
from the common run of his brethren.</P>
<P>This equipage, though much more expensive
than his finances could bear, he found absolutely
necessary, to give him a chance for employment;
as every shabby retainer to physic, in this capi∣tal,
had provided himself with a vehicle, which
was altogether used by way of a travelling sign
post, to draw in customers; so that a walking
physician was considered as an obscure pedlar,
trudging from street to street, with his pack of
knowledge on his shoulders, and selling his rem∣nants
of advice by retail. A chariot was not
now set up for the convenience of a man sinking
under the fatigue of extensive practice, but as a
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
piece of furniture every way as necessary as a
large periwig with three tails; and a physician,
let his merit, in other respects, be never so con∣spicuous,
can no more expect to become con∣siderable
in business, without the assistance of this
implement, than he can hope to live without food,
or breathe without a windpipe.</P>
<P>This requisite is so well understood, that, ex∣clusive
of those who profess themselves doctors,
every raw surgeon, every idle apothecary, who
can make interest with some foolhardy coach∣maker,
may be seen dancing the hays in all places
of public resort, and grinning to one another from
their respective carriages. Hence proceed many
of those cruel accidents which are recorded in the
daily papers. An apothecary's horses take fright,
and run away with his chariot, which is heard of
no more: an eminent surgeon being overturned,
is so terrified at the thoughts of mutilation, that
he resolves to walk on foot all the days of his life;
and the coachman of a physician of great practice,
having the misfortune to be disabled by a fall from
the box, his master can never find another to sup∣ply
his place.</P>
<P>None of these observations escaped the pene∣trating
eye of Fathom, who, before he pretended
to seat himself in his machine, had made proper
inquiry into all the other methods practised, with
a view to keep the wheels in motion. In his re∣searches,
he found that the great world was whol∣ly
engrossed by a few practitioners who had ar∣rived
at the summit of reputation, consequently,
were no longer obliged to cultivate those arts
by which they rose; and that the rest of the busi∣ness
was parcelled out into small inclosures, oc∣cupied
by different groupes of personages, male
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
and female, who stood in rings, and tossed the
ball from one to another, there being in each de∣partment
two sets, the individuals of which re∣lieved
one another occasionaliy. Every knot was
composed of a waiting-woman, nurse, apothe∣cary,
surgeon and physician, and, sometimes, a
midwife was admitted into the partie; and in this
manner the farce was commonly performed.</P>
<P>A fine lady, fatigued with idleness, complains
of the vapours, is deprived of her rest, tho' not
so sick as to have recourse to medicine: her fa∣vourite
maid, tired with giving her attendance in
the night, thinks proper, for the benefit of her
own repose, to complain of a violent head-ach,
and recommends to her mistress a nurse of ap∣proved
tenderness and discretion; at whose house
(in all likelihood) the said chamber-maid hath oft
given the rendezvous to a male friend. The
nurse, well skilled in the mysteries of her occu∣pation,
persuades the patient, that her malady,
far from being slight or chimerical, may proceed
to a very dangerous degree of the hysterical affec∣tion,
unless it be nipt in the bud by some very
effectual remedy: then she recounts a surprising
cure performed by a certain apothecary, and ap∣peals
to the testimony of the waiting woman, who
being the gossip of his wife, confirms the evidence,
and corroborates the proposal. The apothecary
being summoned, finds her ladyship in such a de∣licate
situation, that he declines prescribing, and
advises her to send for a physician without delay.
The nomination, of course, falls to him, and the
doctor being called, declares the necessity of im∣mediate
venaesection, which is accordingly per∣formed
by the surgeon of the association.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147"/>
This is one way of beginning the game: tho'
the commencement often varies, and sometimes
the apothecary, and sometimes the physician opens
the scene; but, be that as it will, they always ap∣pear
in a string, like a flight of wild geese, and
each confederacy maintains a correspondence with
one particular undertaker. Fathom, upon these
considerations, set up his rest in the first floor of
an apothecary in the neighbourhood of Charing∣cross,
to whom he was introduced by a letter
from a friend at Tunbridge, and who being made
acquainted with his ability and scheme, promised
to let slip no opportunity of serving him; and,
indeed, seemed to espouse his interest with great
alacrity. He introduced him to some of his pa∣tients,
on the strength of a gratis visit, sound∣ed
forth his praise among all the good women of
his acquaintance; and even prevailed upon him
to publish advertisements, importing, that he
would, every day, at a certain time and place,
give his advice to the poor for nothing; hoping,
that, by means of some lucky cure, his fame
might be extended, and his practice grow into
request.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his chariot rolled along thro'
all the most frequented streets, during the whole
forenoon, and, at the usual hour, he never failed
to make his appearance at the medical coffee-house,
with all that solemnity of feature and ad∣dress,
by which the modern sons of <HI>Paean</HI> are
distinguished; not but that he was often puzzled
about the decision of his diurnal route: for the
method of driving up one street, and down ano∣ther,
without halting, was become such a stale
expedient, that the very 'prentices used to stand
at the shop doors, and ridicule the vain parade.
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
At length, however, he perused the map of Lon∣don
with great diligence, and having acquired a
distinct idea of its topography, used to alight at
the end of long narrow thorough-fares, and paved
courts, where the chariot was ordered to wait till
his return; and walking with great gravity thro'
the different turnings of these alleys, regain his
carriage by another passage, and resume his seat
with an air of vast importance. With a view to
protract the time of his supposed visits, he would,
at one place, turn aside to the wall; at another,
cheapen an urinal; at a third corner, read a
quack advertisement, or lounge a few minutes in
some bookseller's shop; and, lastly, glide into
some obscure coffeehouse, and treat himself with
a dram of usquebaugh.</P>
<P>The other means used to force a trade, such as
ordering himself to be called from church, alarm∣ing
the neighbourhood with knocking at his door
in the night, receiving sudden messages in places
of resort, and inserting his cures by way of news
in the daily papers, had been so injudiciously
hackneyed by every desperate sculler in physick,
that they had lost their effect upon the publick,
and therefore were excluded from the plan of our
adventurer, whose scheme, for the present, was
to exert himself in winning the favour of those
sage Sybils, who keep, as it were, the temple of
medicine, and admit the young priest to the ser∣vice
of the altar; but this he considered as a tem∣porary
project only, until he should have acquired
interest enough to erect an hospital, lock, or in∣firmary,
by the voluntary subscription of his
friends; a scheme which had succeeded to a mi∣racle,
with many of the profession, who had raised
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
themselves into notice, upon the carcases of the
poor.</P>
<P>Yet, even this branch was already over-stock∣ed,
insomuch that almost every street was fur∣nished
with one of these charitable receptacles,
which, instead of diminishing the taxes for the
maintenance of the poor, encouraged the vulgar
to be idle and dissolute, by opening an asylum to
them, and their families, from the diseases of po∣verty
and intemperance: for it remains to be
proved, that the parish rates are decreased, the
bills of mortality lessened, the people more nu∣merous,
or the streets less infested with beggars,
notwithstanding the immense sums yearly granted
by individuals for the relief of the indigent.</P>
<P>But, waving these reflections, doctor Fathom
hoped, that his landlord would be a most useful
implement for extending his influence, and, for
that reason, admitted him into a degree of part∣nership,
after being fully convinced, that he was
not under articles to any other physician. Never∣theless,
he was very much mistaken in reckoning
on the importance of this new ally, who was, like
himself, a needy adventurer, settled upon credit,
and altogether unemployed, except among the ve∣ry
refuse of the people, whom no other person
would take the trouble to attend: so that our
hero got little else than experience and trouble,
excepting a few guineas, which he made shift to
glean among sojourners, with whom he became
occasionally acquainted, or young people, who
had been unfortunate in their amours.</P>
<P>In the midst of these endeavours, he did not
omit his duty to the old gentlewoman, whose
daughter he had cured at Tunbridge; and was
always received with particular complacency,
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
which, perhaps, he, in some measure, owed to
his genteel equipage, that gave credit to every
door before which it was seen; yet Miss Biddy
was as inaccessible as ever, while the mother be∣came
more and more warm in her civilities, 'till
at length, after having prepared him with some
extraordinary compliments, she gave him to un∣derstand,
that Biddy was no better than a giddy-headed
girl, far from being unexceptionable in her
moral character, and particularly deficient in duty
and gratitude to her, who had been always a ten∣der
and indulgent parent; she was therefore de∣termined
to punish the young minx, for her levi∣ty,
and want of natural affection, by altering her
own condition, could she find a worthy and
agreeable man, on whom she could bestow her
hand and fortune without a blush.</P>
<P>The film was instantly removed from Fathom's
eyes by this declaration, which she uttered with
such a significancy of look, as thrilled to his soul
with joyful presage, while he replied, it would,
indeed, be a difficult task to find a man who me∣rited
such happiness and honour; but, surely,
some there were, who would task their faculties
to the uttermost, in manifesting their gratitude,
and desire of rendering themselves worthy of such
distinction. Though this answer was pronounced
in such a manner, as gave her to understand he
had taken the hint, she would not cheapen her
condescension so much as to explain herself fur∣ther
at that juncture, and he was very well con∣tented
to wooe her on her own terms; accord∣ingly
he began to season his behaviour with a spice
of gallantry, when he had opportunities of being
particular with this new inamorata, and, in pro∣portion
to the returns she made, he gradually de∣tached
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
himself from Miss Biddy, by intermitting,
and, at last, discontinuing those ardent expressions
of love and admiration, which he had made shift
to convey in private looks and stolen whispers,
during the rancorous inspection of her mother.</P>
<P>Such alteration could not long escape the jea∣lous
eyes of the young lady, no more than the
cause of this alienation, which, in a moment,
converted all her love into irreconcilable hate,
and filled her whole soul with the most eager de∣sire
of vengeance: for she now not only consi∣dered
him as a mercenary wretch, who had slight∣ed
her attractions for the sordid gratifications of
avarice, but also as an interloper, who wanted
to intercept her fortune, in the odious character
of a father-in-law. But, before she could bring
her aim to any ripeness of contrivance, her mo∣ther
having caught cold at church, was seized
with a rheumatic fever, became delirious in less
than three days, and, notwithstanding all the
prescriptions and care of her admirer, gave up the
ghost, without having retrieved the use of her
senses, or been able to manifest, by will, the sen∣timents
she entertained in favour of her physician,
who (as the reader will easily perceive) had more
reasons than one, to be mortally chagrined at this
event.</P>
<P>Miss Biddy being thus put in possession of the
whole inheritance, not only renounced all cor∣respondence
with doctor Fathom, by forbidding
him the house, but likewise took all opportuni∣ties
of prejudicing his character, by hinting, that
her dear mamma had fallen a sacrifice to his ig∣norance
and presumption.</P>

<P>THESE ill offices, however, far from an∣swering
her purpose, had a quite contrary
effect: for, in consequence of her invectives, he
was, in a few days, called to the wife of a mer∣chant,
who piously hoped, that his practice would
not give Miss Biddy the lie. The patient had long
lingered under a complication of distempers, and
being in no immediate danger of her life, doctor
Fathom was in no hurry to strike a decisive
stroke; till the husband growing impatient of
delay, and so explicite in his hints, that it was
impossible to misapprehend his meaning, our ad∣venturer
resolved to do something effectual for
his satisfaction, and prescribed a medicine of such
rough operation, as he thought, must either oblige
his employer, or produce a change in the lady's
constitution, that would make a noise in the
world, and bring a new accession to his fame.</P>
<P>Proceeding upon these maxims, he could not
be disappointed: the remedy played its part with
such violence, as reduced the patient to extremi∣ty,
and the merchant had actually bespoke an
undertaker; when, after a series of swoonings
and convulsions, nature so far prevailed, as to
expel, at once, the prescription and the disease;
yet the good-natured husband was so much affect∣ed
with the agonies to which he saw the wife of
his bosom exposed by this specific, that, although
the effect of it was her perfect recovery, he ne∣ver
could bear the sight of Fathom, for the fu∣ture,
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
nor even hear his name mentioned, with∣out
giving signs of horror and indignation: nay,
he did not scruple to affirm, that had our adven∣turer
been endowed with the least tincture of hu∣manity,
he would have suffered the poor woman
to depart in peace, rather than restore her to
health, at the expence of such anxiety and tor∣ture.</P>
<P>On the other hand, this extraordinary cure was
blazoned abroad by the good lady, and her gos∣sips,
with such exaggerations as roused the asto∣nishment
of the publick, and concurred with the
report of his last miscarriage, to bring him upon
the carpet, as the universal subject of discourse.
When a physician becomes the town talk, he ge∣nerally
concludes his business more than half
done, even though his fame should wholly turn
upon his mal-practice; insomuch that some
members of the faculty have been heard to com∣plain,
that they never had the good fortune to be
publickly accused of homicide; and it is well
known, that a certain famous empyrick, of our
day, never flourished to any degree of wealth and
reputation, till after he had been attacked in print,
and fairly convicted of having destroyed a good
number of the human species. Success raised
upon such a foundation, would, by a disciple of
Plato, and some modern moralists, be ascribed
to the innate virtue and generosity of the human
heart, which naturally espouses the cause that
needs protection: but I, whose notions of human
excellence are not quite so sublime, am apt to be∣lieve
it is owing to that spirit of self-conceit and
contradiction, which is, at least, as universal, if
not as natural, as the moral sense so warmly con∣tended
for by those ideal philosophers.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154"/>
The most infamous wretch often finds his ac∣count
in these principles of malevolence and self-love:
for wheresoever his character falls under
discussion, there is generally some person present,
who, either from an affectation of singularity, or
envy to the accusers, undertakes his defence, and
endeavours to invalidate the articles of his im∣peachment,
until he is heated by altercation, and
hurried into more effectual measures for his ad∣vantage.
If such benefits accrue to those who
have no real merit to depend upon; surely, our
hero could not but reap something extraordinary
from the debates to which he now gave rise; as
by the miraculous cure he had effected, all his
patient's friends, all the enemies of her husband,
all those who envied his other adversary, were in∣terested
in his behalf, exclusive of such admirers
as surprize and curiosity might engage in his
cause.</P>
<P>Thus wafted upon the wings of applause, his
fame soon diffused itself into all the corners of this
great capital: the news-papers teemed with his
praise; and in order to keep up the attention of
the publick, his emissaries, male and female, se∣parated
into different coffee-houses, companies,
and clubs, where they did not fail to comment
upon these articles of intelligence. Such a fa∣vourable
incident is, of itself, sufficient to float
the bark of a man's fortune: he was, in a few
days; called to another lady, labouring under the
same disorder he had so successfully dispelled, and
she thought herself benefited by his advice. His
acquaintance naturally extended itself among the
visitants and allies of his patients; he was recom∣mended
from family to family: the fees began to
multiply; a variety of footmen appeared every
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
day at his door; he discontinued his sham circuit,
and looking upon the present conjuncture, as
that tide in his affairs, which (according to Shake∣spear)
when taken at the full, leads on to for∣tune,
he resolved, that the opportunity should
not be lost, and applied himself with such assidui∣ty
to his practice, that, in all likelihood, he would
have carried the palm from all his cotemporaries,
had not he split upon the same rock which had
shipwrecked his hopes before.</P>
<P>We have formerly descanted upon that vene∣real
appetite, which glowed in the constitution
of our adventurer, and which all his philosophy
and caution could hardly keep within bounds:
the reader, therefore, will not be much surprised,
to learn, that, in the exercise of his profession,
he contracted an intimacy with a clergyman's
wife, whom he attended as a physician, and
whose conjugal virtue he subdued by a long and
diligent exertion of his delusive arts, while her
mind was enervated by sickness, and her hus∣band
abroad upon his necessary occasions. This
unhappy patient, who was a woman of an agree∣able
person, and lively conversation, fell a sacri∣fice
to her own security and self-conceit: her
want of health had confined her to a sedentary
life, and her imagination being active and rest∣less,
she had spent those hours in reading, which
other young women devote to company and di∣version:
but, as her studies were not superintend∣ed
by any person of taste, she had indulged her
own fancy without method or propriety. The
Spectator taught her to be a critick and philoso∣pher;
from plays she learned poetry and wit; and
derived her knowledge of life from books of
history and adventures. Fraught with these ac∣quisitions,
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
and furnished by nature with uncom∣mon
vivacity, she despised her own sex, and
courted the society of men, among whom she
thought her talents might be more honourably
displayed; fully confident of her own virtue and
sagacity, which enabled her to set all their arts at
defiance.</P>
<P>Thus qualified, she, in an evil hour, had re∣course
to the advice of our adventurer, for some
ailment under which she had long laboured; and
sound such relief from his skill, as very much
prepossessed her in his favour: she was no less
pleased with his obliging manners, than with his
physick; and found much entertainment in his
conversation, so that the acquaintance proceeded
to a degree of intimacy; during which, he per∣ceived
her weak side, and being enamoured of
her person, flattered her out of all her caution:
The privilege of his character furnished him with
opportunities to lay snares for her virtue, and
taking advantage of that listlessness, languor, and
indolence of the spirits, by which all the vigilance
of the soul is relaxed, he, after a long course of
attention and perseverance, found means to make
shipwreck of her peace.</P>
<P>Though he mastered her chastity, he could
not quiet her conscience, which incessantly up∣braided
her with breach of the marriage vow;
nor did her undoer escape without a share of the
reproaches suggested by her penitence and re∣morse.
This internal anxiety co-operating with
her disease, and, perhaps, with the medicines he
prescribed, reduced her to the brink of the grave;
when her husband returned from a neighbouring
kingdom, in consequence of her earnest request,
joined to the information of her friends, who had
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
written to him an account of the extremity in
which she was. The good man was afflicted be∣yond
measure, when he saw himself upon the
verge of losing a wife whom he had always ten∣derly
loved: but, what were his emotions, when
she, taking the first opportunity of his being alone
with her, accosted him to this effect: “I am
now hastening towards that dissolution, from
which no mortal is exempted; and though the
prospect of futurity is altogether clouded and un∣certain,
my conscience will not allow me to
plunge into eternity, without unburthening my
mind, and by an ingenuous confession, making
all the atonement in my power, for the ingrati∣tude
I have been guilty of, and the wrongs I have
committed against a virtuous husband, who never
gave me cause of complaint. You stand amazed
at this preamble; but, alas! how will you be
shocked when I own that I have betrayed you in
your absence; that I have trespassed against God
and my marriage-vow, and fallen from the pride
and confidence of virtue, to the most abject state
of vice: yes, I have been unfaithful to your bed,
having fallen a victim to the infernal insinuations
of a villain, who took advantage of my weak and
unguarded moments. Fathom is the wretch who
hath thus injured your honour, and ruined my
unsuspecting innocence. I have nothing to plead
in alleviation of my crime, but the most sincere
contrition of heart; and though, at any other
juncture, I could not expect your forgiveness,
yet, as I now touch the goal of life, I trust in
your humanity and benevolence, for that pardon
which will lighten the sorrows of my soul, and
those prayers which I hope will entitle me to fa∣vour
at the throne of grace.”</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158"/>
The poor husband was so much overwhelmed
with grief and confusion, at this unexpected ad∣dress,
that he could not recollect himself till after
a pause of several minutes, when uttering a hol∣low
groan, “I will not (said he) aggravate your
sufferings, by reproaching you with my wrongs;
though your conduct hath been but an ill return
for all my tenderness and esteem. I look upon it
as a trial of my christian patience, and bear my
misfortune with resignation: mean while, I for∣give
you from my heart, and fervently pray, that
your repentance may be acceptable to the father
of mercy.” So saying, he approached her bed∣side,
and embraced her in token of his sincerity.
Whether this generous condescension diffused such
a composure upon her spirits, as tended to the
ease and refreshment of nature, which had been
almost exhausted by disease and vexation; cer∣tain
it is, that, from this day, she began to strug∣gle
with her malady in surprising efforts; and
hourly gained ground, until her health was pretty
well re-established.</P>
<P>This recovery was so far beyond the husband's
expectation, that he began to make very serious
reflections on the event, and even to wish he had
not been quite so precipitate in pardoning the
backslidings of his wife: for, though he could
not withhold his compassion from a dying peni∣tent,
he did not at all relish the thoughts of co∣habiting,
as usual, with a wife, self-convicted of
the violation of the matrimonial contract: he
therefore considered his declaration as no more
than a provisional pardon, to take place on con∣dition
of her immediate death; and, in a little
time, not only communicated to her his senti∣ments
on this subject; but also separated himself
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
from her company, secured the evidence of her
maid, who had been confidante in her amour
with Fathom, and immediately set on foot a pro∣secution
against our adventurer, whose behaviour
to his wife, he did not fail to promulgate, with
all its aggravating circumstances. By these means
the doctor's name became so notorious, that every
man was afraid of admitting him into his house,
and every woman ashamed of solliciting his ad∣vice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His eclipse, and gradual declination.</HEAD>
<P>MISFORTUNES seldom come single: upon
the back of this hue and cry, he unlucki∣ly
prescribed phlebotomy to a gentleman of some
rank, who chanced to expire during the opera∣tion;
and quarrelled with his landlord the apo∣thecary,
who charged him with having forgot the
good offices he had done him in the beginning of
his career; and desired he would provide himself
with another lodging.</P>
<P>All these mishaps treading upon the heels of
one another, had a very mortifying effect upon
his practice. At every tea-table, his name was oc∣casionally
put to the torture, with that of the vile
creature whom he had seduced; though it was
generally taken for granted, by all those female
casuists, that she must have made the first ad∣vances;
for it could not be supposed, that any
man would take much trouble in laying schemes
for the ruin of a person whose attractions were so
slender, especially considering the ill state of her
health, a circumstance that seldom adds to a
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
woman's beauty or good humour; besides, she
was always a pert minx, that affected singularity,
and a masculine manner of speaking; and many
of them had foreseen, that she would, some time
or other, bring herself into such a praemunire. At
all gossipings, where the apothecary or his wife
assisted, Fathom's pride, ingratitude, and mal∣practice
were canvassed; in all clubs of married
men, he was mentioned with marks of abhor∣rence
and detestation; and every medical coffee-house
rung with his reproach. Instances of his
ignorance and presumption were quoted, and ma∣ny
particulars feigned for the purpose of defama∣tion;
so that our hero was exactly in the situa∣tion;
of a horseman, who, in riding at full speed
for the plate, is thrown from the saddle in the
middle of the race, and left without sense or mo∣tion
upon the plain. His progress, though rapid,
had been so short, that he could not be supposed
to have laid up store against such a day of trou∣ble;
and as he still cherished hopes of surmounting
those obstacles which had so suddenly started up
in his way, he would not resign his equipage, nor
retrench his expences; but appeared, as usual, in
all public places, with that serenity and confi∣dence
of feature which he had never deposited;
and maintained his external pomp, upon the little
he had reserved in the days of his prosperity, and
the credit he had acquired by the punctuality of
his former payments. Both these funds, how∣ever,
failed in a very little time: his law-suit was
a gulph that swallowed up all his ready money;
and the gleanings of his practice were scarce suffi∣cient
to answer his pocket expences, which now
increased in proportion to the decrease of busi∣ness;
for as he had more idle time, and was less
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
admitted into private families, so he thought he
had more occasion to enlarge his acquaintance
among his own sex, who alone were able to sup∣port
him in his disgrace with the other. He ac∣cordingly
listed himself in several clubs, and en∣deavoured
to monopolize the venereal branch of
trade: tho' this was but an indifferent resource;
for almost all his patients of this class, were such
as either could not, or would not properly recom∣pence
the physician.</P>
<P>For some time, he lingered in this situation,
without going upwards or downwards, floating
like a wisp of straw, at the turning of the tide,
until he could no longer amuse the person of
whom he had hired his coach horses, or postpone
the other demands, which multiplied upon him
every day. Then was his chariot overturned with
a hideous crash, and his face so much wounded
with the shivers of the glass, which went to pieces
in the fall, that he appeared in the coffeehouse
with half a dozen black patches upon his counte∣nance,
gave a most circumstantial detail of the
risque he had run, and declared, that he did not
believe he should ever hazard himself again in any
sort of wheel carriage.</P>
<P>Soon after this accident, he took an opportuni∣ty
of telling his friends, in the same public place,
that he had turned away his footman, on account
of his drunkenness, and was resolved, for the fu∣ture,
to keep none but maids in his service, be∣cause
the men servants are generally impudent,
lazy, debauched, or dishonest; and, after all,
neither so neat, handy, or agreeable as the other
sex. In the rear of this resolution, he shifted
his lodgings into a private court, being distracted
with the din of carriages, that disturb the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
who live towards the open street; and gave
his acquaintance to understand, that he had a
medical work upon the anvil, which he could not
finish without being indulged in silence and tran∣quillity.
In effect, he gradually put on the ex∣teriors
of an author: his watch, with an hori∣zontal
movement by Graham, which he had often
mentioned, and shewn as a very curious piece of
workmanship, began, about this time, to be very
much out of order, and was committed to the
care of a mender, who was in no hurry to re∣store
it. His tye-wig degenerated into a major;
he sometimes appeared without a sword, and was
even observed in public with a second day's shirt:
at last, his cloaths became rusty, and when he
walked about the streets, his head turned round
in a surprising manner, by an involuntary motion
in his neck, which he had contracted hy an habit
of reconnoitering the ground, that he might
avoid all dangerous or disagreeable encounters.</P>
<P>Fathom, finding himself descending the hill of
fortune, with an acquired gravitation, strove to
catch at every twig, in order to stop or retard his
descent. He now regretted the opportunities he
had neglected, of marrying one of several women
of moderate fortune, who had made advances to
him, in the zenith of his reputation; and endea∣voured,
by forcing himself into a lower path of
life than any he had hitherto trod, to keep him∣self
afloat, with the portion of some tradesman's
daughter, whom he meant to espouse. While he
exerted himself in this pursuit, he happened, in
returning from a place about thirty miles from
London, to become acquainted, in the stage
coach, with a young woman, of a very homely
appearance, whom, from the driver's informa∣tion,
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
he understood to be the niece of a country
justice, and daughter of a soap-boiler, who had
lived and died in London, and left her, in her
infancy, sole heiress of his effects, which amount∣ed
to four thousand pounds. The uncle, who
was her guardian, had kept her sacred from the
knowledge of the world, resolving to effect a
match betwixt her and his own son; and it was
with much difficulty he had consented to this
journey, which she had undertaken as a visit to
her own mother, who had married a second hus∣band
in town.</P>
<P>Fraught with these anecdotes, Fathom began
to put forth his gallantry and good humour, and,
in a word, was admitted by the lady, to the pri∣vilege
of an acquaintance, in which capacity he
visited her during the term of her residence in
London; and as there was no time to be lost, de∣clared
his honourable intentions: he had such a
manifest advantage, in point of personal accom∣plishments,
over the young gentleman who was
destined for her husband, that she did not disdain
his proposals, and before she set out for the coun∣try,
he had made such progress in her heart, that
the day was actually fixed for their nuptials, on
which he faithfully promised to carry her off in a
coach and six. How to raise money for this ex∣pedition,
was all the difficulty that remained:
for, by this time, his finances were utterly dried
up, and his credit altogether exhausted. Upon
a very pressing occasion, he had formerly applied
himself to a certain wealthy quack, who had re∣lieved
his necessities by lending him a small sum
of money, in return for having communicated to
him a secret medicine, which he affirmed to be
the most admirable specifick that ever was in∣vented.
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
The nostrum had been used, and luckily
for him, succeeded in the trial; so that the em∣pyrick,
in the midst of his satisfaction, began to
reflect, that this same Fathom, who pretended to
be in possession of a great many remedies, equally
efficacious, would certainly become a formidable
rival to him, in his business, should he ever be
able to extricate himself from his present difficul∣ties.</P>
<P>In consequence of these suggestions, he re∣solved
to keep our adventurer's head under wa∣ter,
by maintaining him in the most abject de∣pendance;
accordingly he had, from time to
time, accommodated him with small trifles, which
barely served to support his existence, and even
for these had taken notes of hand, that he might
have a scourge over head, in case he should prove
insolent or refractory. To this benefactor, Fa∣thom
applied for a reinforcement of twenty gui∣neas,
which he sollicited with the more confi∣dence,
as that sum would certainly enable him to
repay all other obligations. The quack would
advance the money upon no other condition,
than that of knowing the scheme, which being
explained, he complied with Ferdinand's re∣quest;
but, at the same time, privately dispatch∣ed
an express to the young lady's uncle, with a
full account of the whole conspiracy; so that
when the doctor arrived at the inn, according to
appointment, he was received by his worship, in
person, who gave him to understand, that his
niece had changed her mind, and gone fifty miles
farther into the country to visit a relation. This
was a grievous disappointment to Fathom, who
really believed his mistress had forsaken him thro'
mere levity and caprice, and was not undeceived
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
till several months after her marriage with her
cousin, when, at an accidental meeting in Lon∣don,
she explained the story of the secret intelli∣gence,
and excused her marriage, as the effect of
rigorous usage and compulsion.</P>
<P>Had our hero been really enamoured of her
person, he might have, probably, accomplished
his wishes, notwithstanding the steps she had ta∣ken:
but this was not the case; his passion was
of a different nature, and the object of it effec∣tually
without his reach. With regard to his ap∣petite
for women, as it was an infirmity of his
constitution, which he could not overcome, and as
he was in no condition to gratify it at a great ex∣pence,
he had of late chosen an housekeeper from
the hundreds of Drury, and to avoid scandal, al∣lowed
her to assume his name. As to the inti∣mation
which had been sent to the country justice,
he immediately imputed it to the true author,
whom he marked for his vengeance accordingly,
but, in the mean time, suppressed his resentment,
because he, in some measure, depended upon him
for subsistence. On the other hand, the quack,
dreading the forwardness and plausibility of our
hero, which might, one time or other, render
him independent, put a stop to those supplies, on
pretence of finding them inconvenient; but, out
of his friendship and good will to Fathom, under∣took
to procure for him such letters of recom∣mendation,
as would infallibly make his fortune in
the West-Indies, and even to fit him out in a
genteel manner for the voyage. Ferdinand per∣ceived
his drift, and thanked him for his generous
offer, which he would not fail to consider with
all due deliberation: though he was determined
against the proposal, but obliged to temporize,
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
that he might not incur the displeasure of this
man, at whose mercy he lay. Mean while the
prosecution against him, in Doctors Commons,
drew near a period, and the lawyers were clamor∣ous
for money, without which he foresaw he
should lose the advantage which his cause had
lately acquired by the death of his antagonist's
chief evidence: he therefore, seeing every other
channel shut up, began to doubt, whether the
risque of being apprehended or slain in the cha∣racter
of an highwayman, was not over-ballanced
by the prospect of being acquitted of a charge
which had ruined his reputation and fortune, and
actually entertained thoughts of taking the air on
Hounslow Heath, when he was diverted from this
expedient by a very singular adventure.</P>

<DIV2 N="55" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">After divers unsuccessful efforts, he has recourse to
the matrimonial noose.</HEAD>
<P>CHANCING to meet with one of his ac∣quaintance
at a certain coffeehouse, the
discourse turned upon the characters of mankind,
when, among other oddities, his friend brought
upon the carpet a certain old gentlewoman of
such a rapacious disposition, that, like a jack-daw,
she never beheld any metalline substance without
an inclination, and even an effort to secrete it for
her own use and contemplation: nor was this in∣firmity
originally produced from indigence, in∣asmuch
as her circumstances had been always af∣fluent,
and she was now possessed of a considerable
sum of money in the funds; notwithstanding
which, the avarice of her nature tempted her to
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
let lodgings, though few people could live under
the same roof with such an original, who, rather
than be idle, had often filched pieces of her own
plate, and charged her servants with the theft, or
hinted suspicion of her lodgers. Fathom, struck
with the description, soon perceived how this wo∣man's
disease might be converted to his advan∣tage;
and after having obtained sufficient intelli∣gence,
on pretence of satisfying his curiosity, he
visited the widow, in consequence of a bill at
her door, and actually hired an apartment in her
house, whither he forthwith repaired with his
inamorata. It was not long before he perceived,
that his landlady's character had not been misre∣presented;
he fed her distemper with divers in∣considerable
trinkets, such as copper medals, cork
screws, odd buckles, and a paultry seal set in sil∣ver,
which were, at different times, laid as baits
for her infirmity, and always convey'd away with
remarkable eagerness, which he and his Dulcinea
took pleasure in observing from an unsuspected
place. Thus confirmed in his opinion, he, at
length, took an opportunity of exposing a metal
watch that belonged to his mistress, and saw it
seized, with great satisfaction, in the absence of
his help-mate, who had gone abroad on purpose.
According to instruction, she soon returned, and
began to raise a terrible clamour about the loss of
her watch; upon which she was condoled by her
landlady, who seemed to doubt the integrity of
the maid, and even proposed, that Mrs. Fathom
should apply to some justice of the peace, for a
warrant to search the servant's trunk. The lady
thanked her for the good advice, in compliance
with which, she had immediate recourse to a ma∣gistrate,
who granted a search warrant, not a∣gainst
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
the maid, but the mistress: and she, in a
little time, returned with the constable at her
back.</P>
<P>These precautions being taken, doctor Fa∣thom
desired a private conference with the old
gentlewoman, in which he gave her to under∣stand,
that he had undoubted proofs of her having
secreted, not only the watch, but also several other
odd things, of less consequence, which he had lost
since his residence in her house: he then shewed
the warrant he had obtained against her, and ask∣ed,
if she had any thing to offer, why the con∣stable
should not do his duty. Inexpressible were
the anguish and confusion of the defendant, when
she found herself thus entrapped, and reflected,
that she was on the point of being detected of fe∣lony;
for she at once concluded, that the snare
was laid for her, and knew, that the officer of
justice would certainly find the unlucky watch in
one of the drawers of her scrutore.</P>
<P>Tortured with these suggestions, afraid of pub∣lic
disgrace, and dreading the consequence of le∣gal
conviction, she fell on her knees before the
injured Fathom, and, after having imputed her
crime to the temptations of necessity, implored
his compassion, promised to restore the watch,
and every thing she had taken, and begged he
would dismiss the constable, that her reputation
might not suffer in the eye of the world.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, with a severity of countenance pur∣posely
assumed, observed, that were she really in∣digent,
he had charity enough to forgive what she
had done; but, as he knew her circumstances
were opulent, he looked upon this excuse as an
aggravation of her guilt, which was certainly the
effect of a vicious inclination; and he was there∣fore
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
determined to prosecute her with the utmost
severity of the law, as an example and terror to
others, who might be infected with the same evil
disposition. Finding him deaf to all her tears and
intreaties, she changed the note, and offered him
one hundred guineas, if he would compromise the
affair, and drop the prosecution, so as that her
character should sustain no damage: after much
argumentation, he consented to accept of double
the sum, which being instantly paid in East-India
bonds, doctor Fathom told the constable, that the
watch was found; and for once her reputation
was patched up. This seasonable supply enabled
our hero to stand trial with his adversary, who was
nonsuited, and also to mend his external appear∣ance,
which of late had not been extremely mag∣nificent.</P>
<P>Soon after this gleam of good fortune, a trades∣man,
to whom he was considerably indebted, see∣ing
no other probable means to recover his mo∣ney,
introduced Fathom to the acquaintance of a
young widow who lodged at his house, and was
said to be in possession of a considerable fortune,
Considering the steps that were taken, it would
have been almost impossible for him to miscarry
in his addresses: the lady had been bred in the
country, was unacquainted with the world, and
of a very sanguine disposition, which her short
trial of matrimony had not served to cool. Our
adventurer was instructed to call at the trades∣man's
house, as if by accident, at an appointed
time, when the widow was drinking tea with her
landlady: on these occasions he always behaved
to admiration. She liked his person, and praised
his politeness, good humour, and good sense: his
confederates extolled him as a prodigy of learn∣ing,
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
taste, and good nature: they likewise repre∣sented
him as a person on the eve of eclipsing all
his competitors in physick: an acquaintance and
intimacy soon ensued, nor was he restricted in
point of opportunity. In a word, he succeeded
in his endeavours, and one evening, on pretence
of attending her to the play, he accompanied her
to the Fleet, where they were married, in presence
of the tradesman and his wife, who were of the party.</P>
<P>This grand affair being accomplished to his
satisfaction, he, next day, visited her brother,
who was a counsellor of the Temple, to make
him acquainted with the step his sister had taken;
and though the lawyer was not a little mortified,
to find she had made such a clandestine match, he
behaved civilly to his new brother-in-law, and
gave him to understand, that his wife's fortune
consisted of a jointure of one hundred and fifty
pounds a year, and fifteen hundred pounds be∣queathed
to her during her widowhood, by her
own father, who had taken the precaution of set∣tling
it in the hands of trustees, in such a manner
as that any husband she might afterwards espouse,
should be restricted from encroaching upon the
capital, which was reserved for the benefit of her
heirs. This intimation was far from being agree∣ble
to our hero, who had been informed, that
this sum was absolutely at the lady's disposal, and
had actually destined the greatest part of it for the
pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment of his debts, for defraying the expence
of furnishing an elegant house, and setting up a
new equipage.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this disappointment, he re∣solved
to carry on his plan, upon the credit
of his marriage, which was published in a very
pompous article of the news papers; a cha∣riot
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
was bespoke, a ready furnished house imme∣diately
taken, and doctor Fathom began to re∣appear
in all his former splendor.</P>
<P>His good friend the empirick, alarmed at this
event, which not only raised our adventurer into
the sphere of a dangerous rival, but also furnished
him with means to revenge the ill office he had
sustained at his hands, on the adventure of the
former match; for, by this time, Fathom had
given him some hints, importing, that he was not
ignorant of his treacherous behaviour: roused, I
say, by these considerations, he employed one of
his emissaries, who had some knowledge of Fa∣thom's
brother-in-law, to prejudice him against
our adventurer, whom he represented as a needy
sharper, not only overwhelmed with debt and
disgrace, but likewise previously married to a poor
woman, who was prevented by nothing but want,
from seeking redress at law. To confirm these
assertions, he gave him a detail of Fathom's in∣cumbrances,
which he had learned for the pur∣pose,
and even brought the counsellor in company
with the person who had lived with our hero be∣fore
marriage, and who was so much incensed at
her abrupt dismission, that she did not scruple to
corroborate these allegations of the informer.</P>
<P>The lawyer, startled at this intelligence, set
on foot a minute inquiry into the life and con∣versation
of the doctor, which turned out so little
to the advantage of his character and circum∣stances,
that he resolved, if possible, to disunite
him from his family, and as a previous step, re∣peated
to his sister, all that he had heard to the
prejudice of her husband, not forgetting to pro∣duce
the evidence of his mistress, who laid claim
to him by a prior title, which, she pretended,
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
could be proved by the testimony of the clergy∣man
who joined them. Such an explanation could
not fail to inflame the resentment of the injured
wife, who, at the very first opportunity, giving
a loose to the impetuosity of her temper, upbraid∣ed
our hero with the most bitter invectives for his
perfidious dealing.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, conscious of his own innocence,
which he had not always to plead, far from at∣tempting
to sooth her indignation, assumed the
authority and prerogative of an husband, and
sharply reprehended her for her credulity and in∣decent
warmth. This rebuke, instead of silencing,
gave new spirit and volubility to her reproaches,
in the course of which, she plainly taxed him
with want of honesty and affection, and said, that
though his pretence was love, his aim was no
other than a base design upon her fortune.</P>
<P>Fathom, stung with these accusations, which
he really did not deserve, replied with uncommon
heat, and charged her, in his turn, with want of
sincerity and candour, in the false account she had
given of that same fortune, before marriage: he
even magnified his own condescension, in sur∣rendering
his liberty to a woman, who had so
little to recommend her to the addresses of the
other sex; a reflection which provoked this mild
creature to such a degree of animosity, that, for∣getting
her duty and allegiance, she lent him a
box on the ear, with such energy as made his
eyes water; and he, for the honour of his man∣hood
and sovereignty, having washed her face
with a dish of tea, withdrew abruptly, to a coffee∣house
in the neighbourhood, where he had not
long remained, when his passion subsided, and
he then saw the expediency of an immediate re∣conciliation,
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
which he resolved to purchase, even
at the expence of a submission.</P>
<P>It was pity that such a salutary resolution had
not been sooner taken: for when he returned to
his own house, he understood, that Mrs. Fathom
had gone abroad in an hackney coach; and upon
examining her apartment, in lieu of her cloaths
and trinkets, which she had removed with admira∣ble
dexterity and dispatch, he found this billet in
one of the drawers of her buroe. “Sir, being
convinced that you are a cheat and an impostor,
I have withdrawn myself from your cruelty and
machinations, with a view to sollicit the pro∣tection
of the law; and I doubt not but I shall
soon be able to prove, that you have no just title
to, or demand upon the person or effects of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfortunate Sarah Muddy.”</P>
<P>The time had been when Mr. Fathom would
have allowed Mrs. Muddy to refine at her leisure,
and blessed God for his happy deliverance; but at
present the case was quite altered. Smarting as
he was, from the expence of law suits, he dreaded
a prosecution for bigamy, which (though he had
justice on his side) he knew he could not of him∣self
support: besides, all his other schemes of life
were frustrated by this unlucky elopement: he
therefore speedily determined to anticipate, as
much as in him lay, the malice of his enemies,
and to obtain, without delay, authentic documents
of his marriage. With this view he hastened to
the house of the tradesman, who, with his wife,
had been witness to the ceremony and consum∣mation;
and, in order to interest them the more
warmly in his cause, made a pathetic recital of
this unhappy breach, in which he had suffered
such injury and insult: but all his rhetoric would
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
not avail; Mrs. Muddy had been beforehand
with him, and proved the better orator of the
two; for she had assailed this honest couple with
such tropes and figures of eloquence, as were alto∣gether
irresistible. Nevertheless, they heard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
hero, to an end, with great patience: then the
wife, who was the common mouth, upon all such
occasions, contracting her features into a very
formal disposition, “I'll assure you, said she,
doctor Fathom, my husband and I have been in
a very great terrification and numbplush, to hear
such bad things of a person, whom, as one may
say, we thought a worthy gentleman, and were
ready to serve at all times, by day and by night, as
the saying is; and besides, for all that, you know,
and God knows, as we are dustrious people, and
work hard for what we get, and we have served
gentlemen to our own harm, whereby my husband
was last tuesday served with a siserary, being that
he was bound for an officer that ran away: and I
said to my husband, Timothy, says I, 'tis a very
hard thing for one to ruin one's self for stranger
people. There's doctor Fathom, says I, his ac∣count
comes to nine and forty pounds seven
shillings and four-pence half-penny; and you
know, doctor, that was before your last bill be∣gan:
but, howsomever, little did I think, as how
a gentleman of your learning, would go to de∣ceive
a poor gentlewoman, when you had another
wife alive.”</P>
<P>In vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindi∣cate
himself from this aspersion; the good wo∣man,
like a great many modern disputants, pro∣ceeded
with her declamation, without seeming to
hear what was said on the other side of the question;
and the husband was altogether neutral.
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
At length, Ferdinand finding all his protestations
ineffectual, “Well, said he, though you are re∣solved,
I see, to discredit all that I can say in op∣position
to that scandalous slander, of which I
can easily acquit myself in a court of justice, sure∣ly
you will not refuse to grant me a certificate,
signifying, that you were present at the ceremony
of my marriage with this unhappy woman.”
“You shall excuse us; (replied the female ora∣tor)
people cannot be too wary in signing their
names, in this wicked world; many a one has
been brought to ruination by signing his name,
and my husband shall not, with my good will,
draw himself into such a primmineery.”</P>
<P>Fathom, alarm'd at this refusal, earnestly argued
against the inhumanity and injustice of it, appeal∣ing
to their own consciences for the reasonable∣ness
of his proposal; but, from the evasive an∣swers
of the wife, he had reason to believe, that,
long before the time of trial, they would take
care to have forgotten the whole transaction.</P>
<P>Though he was equally confounded and in∣censed
at this instance of their perfidy, he durst
not manifest his indignation, conscious of the ad∣vantage
they had over him in divers respects;
but repaired, without loss of time, to the lodging
of the clergyman who had noosed him, resolved
to consult his register, and secure his evidence.
Here too his evil genius had got the start of him,
for the worthy ecclesiastic not only could not re∣collect
his features, or find his name in the register;
but, when importuned by his pressing remon∣strances,
took umbrage at the freedom of his be∣haviour,
and threatened, if he would not imme∣diately
take himself away, to raise the posse of the
Fleet, for the safety of his own person.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>
Rather than put the pastor to the trouble of alarm∣ing
his flock, he retreated with a heavy heart, and
went in quest of his mistress, whom he had dismissed
at his marriage, in hopes of effecting a reconciliati∣on,
and preventing her from joining in the conspira∣cy
against him; but, alas, he met with such a re∣ception,
as he had reason to expect from a slighted
woman, who had never felt any real attachment
for his person. She did not upbraid him with his
cruelty, in leaving her as a mistress, but, with a
species of effrontery, never enough to be admir∣ed,
reproached him with his villainy, in aban∣doning
her, who was his true and lawful wise,
to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by whose
fortune he had been allured.</P>
<P>When he attempted to expostulate with this
virago, upon the barbarity of this assertion, she
very prudently declined engaging in private con∣versation
with such an artful and wicked man,
and calling up the people of the house, insisted
upon his being conducted to the door.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="56" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which his fortune is effectually strangled.</HEAD>
<P>THE last resource, and that upon which he
least depended, was the advice and assist∣ance
of his old friend the empirick, with whom
he still maintained a slight correspondence; and
to whose house he steered his course, in great
perplexity and tribulation. That gentleman, in∣stead
of consoling him with assurances of friend∣ship
and protection, faithfully recapitulated all the
instances of his indiscretion and misconduct, taxed
him with want of sincerity in the West-India
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
affair, as well as with want of honesty in this last
marriage, while his former wife was alive; and
finally, reminded him of his notes, which he de∣sired
might be immediately taken up, as he (the
quack) had present occasion for a sum of money.</P>
<P>Ferdinand seeing it would be impracticable to
derive any succour from this quarter, sneaked
homewards, in order to hold a consultation with
his own thoughts; and the first object that pre∣sented
itself to his eyes, when he entered his apart∣ment,
was a letter from the tradesman, with his
account inclosed, amounting to fifty-five pounds,
which the writer desired might be paid without
delay. Before he had time to peruse the articles,
he received a summons, in consequence of a bill
of indictment for bigamy, found against him in
Hicks's-hall, by Sarah Muddy, widow; and while
he was revolving measures to avert these storms,
another billet arrived from a certain attorney,
giving him to understand, that he had orders from
doctor Buffalo, the quack, to sue him for the pay∣ment
of several notes, unless he would take them
up in three days from the date of this letter.</P>
<P>Such a concurrence of sinister events, made a
deep impression upon the mind of our adventurer:
all his fortitude was insufficient to bear him up
against this torrent of misfortunes; his resources
were all dried up, his invention failed, and his
reflection began to take a new turn. “To what
purpose (said he to himself) have I deserted the
paths of integrity and truth, and exhausted a fruit∣ful
imagination, in contriving schemes to betray
my fellow-creatures; if, instead of acquiring a
splendid fortune, which was my aim, I have suf∣fered
such a series of mortifications, and at last
brought myself to the brink of inevitable destruc∣tion?
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
By a virtuous exertion of those talents I
inherit from nature and education, I might, long
before this time, have rendered myself indepen∣dent,
and, perhaps, conspicuous in life: I might
have grown up like a young oak, which being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mly rooted in its kindred soil, gradually raises
up its lofty head, expands its leafy arms, projects
a noble shade, and towers the glory of the plain:
I should have paid the debt of gratitude to my be∣nefactors,
and made their hearts sing with joy for
the happy effects of their benevolence; I should
have been a bulwark to my friends, a shelter to
my neighbours in distress; I should have run the
race of honour, seen my same diffused like a
sweet-smelling odour, and felt the ineffable plea∣sure
of doing good: whereas I am, after a vicis∣situde
of disappointments, dangers and fatigues,
reduced to misery and shame, aggravated by a
conscience loaded with treachery and guilt. I
have abused the confidence and generosity of my
patron; I have defrauded his family, under the
mask of sincerity and attachment; I have taken
the most cruel and base advantages of virtue in
distress; I have seduced unsuspecting innocence
to ruin and despair; I have violated the most sa∣cred
trust reposed in me by my friend and bene∣factor;
I have betrayed his love, torn his noble
heart asunder, by means of the most perfidious
slander and false insinuations; and finally, brought
to an untimely grave the fairest pattern of hu∣man
beauty and perfection. Shall the author of
these crimes pass with impunity? Shall he hope
to prosper in the midst of such enormous guilt?
It were an imputation upon providence to suppose
it—Ah, no! I begin to feel myself overtaken by
the eternal justice o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heaven! I totter on the edge
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
of wretchedness and woe, without one friendly
hand to save me from the terrible abyss.”</P>
<P>These reflections, which, perhaps, the misery of
his fellow creatures would never have inspired, had
he himself remained without the verge of misfor∣tune,
were now produced from the sensation of
his own calamities; and, for the first time, his
cheeks were bedewed with the drops of penitence
and sorrow. Contraries, saith Plato, are produc∣tive
of each other. Reformation is oftentimes
generated from unsuccessful vice; and our ad∣venturer
was, at this juncture, very well disposed
to turn over a new leaf, in consequence of those
salutary suggestions; though he was far from be∣ing
cured beyond the possibility of a relapse: on
the contrary, all the faculties of his soul were so
well adapted, and had been so long habituated to
deceit, that in order to extricate himself from the
evils that environed him, he would not, in all pro∣bability,
have scrupled to practise it upon his own
father, had a convenient opportunity occurred.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, he certainly, after a te∣dious
and fruitless exercise of his invention, re∣solved
to effect a clandestine retreat from that con∣federacy
of enemies which he could not withstand,
and once more join his fortune to that of Renaldo,
whom he proposed to serve, for the future, with
fidelity and affection, thereby endeavouring to at∣tone
for the treachery of his former conduct.
Thus determined, he packed up his necessaries in
a portmanteau, attempted to amuse his creditors
with promise of speedy payment, and ventur∣ing
to come forth in the dark, took a place
in the Canterbury stage coach, after having
converted his superfluities into ready money.
These steps were not taken with such priva∣cy,
as to elude the vigilance of his adversa∣ries;
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
for although he had been cautious enough
to transport himself and his baggage to the inn,
on sunday evening, and never doubted, that the
vehicle, which set out at four o'clock on monday
morning, would convey him out of the reach of
his creditors, before they could possibly obtain a
writ for securing his person; they had actually ta∣ken
such precautions as frustrated all his finesse;
and the coach being stopt in the Borough of South∣wark,
doctor Fathom was seized by virtue of a
warrant obtained on a criminal indictment, and
was forthwith conducted to the prison of the King's
Bench; yet not before he had, by his pathetic
remonstrances, excited the compassion, and even
drawn tears from the eyes of his fellow passengers.</P>
<P>He no sooner recollected himself from the
shock which must have been occasioned by this
sinister incident, than he dispatched a letter to
his brother-in-law the counsellor, requesting an
immediate conference, in which he promised to
make such a proposal, as would save him all the
expence of a law-suit and trial, and at the same
time effectually answer all the purposes of both.
He was accordingly favoured with a visit from the
lawyer, to whom, after the most solemn protesta∣tions
of his own innocence, he declared, that,
finding himself unable to wage war against such
powerful antagonists, he had resolved even to a∣bandon
his indubitable right, and retire into ano∣ther
country, in order to screen himself from per∣secution,
and remove all cause of disquiet from the
prosecutrix, when he was unfortunately prevented
by the warrant which had been executed against
him. He said he was still willing, for the sake of
his liberty, to sign a formal renunciation of his
pretensions to Mrs. Fathom and her fortune, pro∣vided
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
the deeds could be executed, and the watant
withdrawn, before he should be detained b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his other creditors; and lastly, he conjured the
barrister to spare himself the guilt and the charge
of suborning evidence for the destruction of an
unhappy man, whose misfortune was his only fault.</P>
<P>The lawyer felt the force of his expostulations,
and though he would by no means suppose him
innocent of the charge of bigamy, yet, under the
pretext of humanity and commiseration, he un∣dertook
to persuade his sister to accept of a proper
release, which he observed would not be binding,
if executed during the confinement of Fathom;
he therefore took his leave in order to prepare the
papers, withdraw the action, and take such other
measures as would hinder the prisoner from giving
him the slip. Next day he returned with an or∣der
to release our hero, who being formally dis∣charged,
was conducted, by the lawyer, to a ta∣vern
in the neighbourhood, where the releases
were exchanged, and every thing concluded with
amity and concord. This business being happily
transacted, Fathom stept into an hackney coach
with his baggage, and was followed by a bail<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff,
who told him, with great composure▪ that he was
again a prisoner at the suit of doctor Buffalo, and
desired the coachman to reconduct him to the
lodging he had so lately discharged.</P>
<P>Fathom, whose fortitude had been hitherto of
the pagan temper, was now fain to reinforce it with
the philosophy of christian resignation, tho' he had
not as yet arrived to such a pitch of self-denial, as
to forgive the counsellor, to whose double dealing
he imputed this new calamity. After having re∣ceived
the compliments of the jailor on his re∣commitment,
he took pen, ink, and paper, and
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
composed an artful and affecting epistle to the
empirick, imploring his mercy, flattering his
weakness, and demonstrating the bad policy of
cooping up an unhappy man in a jail, where he
could never have an opportunity of doing justice to
his creditors; nor did he forget to declare his in∣tention
of retiring into another country, where he
might have some chance of earning a subsistence,
which he had so long toiled for to no purpose in
England. This last declaration he made in con∣sequence
of the jealous disposition of the quack,
who, he knew, had long looked upon him in the
odious light of an interloping rival. However, he
reaped no benefit from this supplication, which
served only to gratify the pride of Buffalo, who
produced the extravagant encomiums which Fa∣thom
had bestowed upon him, as so many testi∣monials
of his foe's bearing witness to his virtue.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fathom being safely housed, the reader is entertained
with a retrospect.</HEAD>
<P>BUT now it is high time to leave our ad∣venturer
to chew the cud of reflexion and
remorse in this solitary mansion, that we may
trace Ronaldo in the several steps he took to as∣sert
his right, and do justice to his family. Never
man indulged a more melancholy train of ideas
than that which accompanied him in his journey
to the Imperial court: for, notwithstanding the
manifold reasons he had to expect an happy issue
to his aim, his imagination was incessantly infect∣ed
with something that chilled his nerves, and
saddened his heart, recurring, with quick succes∣sion,
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
like the unwearied wave that beats upon the
bleak, inhospitable Greenland shore. This, the
reader will easily suppose, was no other than the
remembrance of the forlorn Monimia, whose image
appeared to his fancy in different attitudes, accord∣ing
to the prevalence of the passions, which raged
in his bosom. Sometimes he viewed her in the
light of apostacy, and then his soul was maddened
with indignation and despair: but these transitory
blasts were not able to efface the impressions she
had formerly made upon his heart; impressions
which he had so often and so long contemplated
with inconceivable rapture. These pictures still
remained, representing her fair as the most per∣fect
idea of beauty, soft and tender as an angel of
mercy and compassion, warmed with every virtue
of the heart, and adorned with every accomplish∣ment
of human nature: yet the alarming contrast
came still in the rear of this recollection; so that
his soul was by turns agitated by the tempests of
horror, and overwhelmed by the floods of grief.</P>
<P>He recalled the moment on which he first beheld
her, with that pleasing regret which attends the
memory of a dear deceased friend; then he bit∣terly
cursed it, as the source of all his misfortunes
and affliction: he thanked heaven for having bles∣sed
him with a friend to detect her perfidy and in∣gratitude;
then ardently wished he had still con∣tinued
under the influence of her delusion. In a
word, the loneliness of his situation aggravated
every horror of his reflection; for, as he found
himself without company, his imagination was
never sollicited, or his attention diverted from
these subjects of woe; and he travelled to Brus∣sels
in a reverie, fraught with such torments as
must have entirely wrecked his reason, had not
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
providence interposed in his behalf. He was, by
his postilion, conducted to one of the best inns of
the place, where he understood the cloth was al∣ready
laid for supper, and as the ordinary is open
to strangers, in all those houses of entertainment,
he introduced himself into the company, with a
view to alleviate, in some measure, his sorrow
and chagrin, by the conversation of his fellow
guests: yet he was so ill prepared to obtain the
relief which he courted, that he entered the apart∣ment,
and sat down to table, without distinguish∣ing
either the number or countenances of those
who were present: though he himself did not re∣main
so unregarded. His mein and deportment
produced a prepossession in his favour; and the
air of affliction, so remarkable in his visage, did
not fail to attract their sympathy and observation.</P>
<P>Among the rest, was an Irish officer in the Au∣strian
service, who having eyed Renaldo atten∣tively,
“Sir, (said he, rising) if my eyes and
memory do not deceive me, you are the count de
Melvile, with whom I had the honour to serve up∣on
the Rhine, during the last war.” The youth
hearing his own name mentioned, lifted up his
eyes, and at once recognizing the other to be a
gentleman who had been a captain in his father's re∣giment,
ran forwards, and embraced him with great
affection.</P>
<P>This was, in divers respects, a fortunate ren∣counter
for young Melvile; as the officer was
not only perfectly well acquainted with the situa∣tion
of the count's family, but also resolved, in
a few days, to set out for Vienna, whither he pro∣mised
to accompany Renaldo, as soon as he un∣derstood
his route lay the same way. Before the
day fixed for their departure arrived, this gen∣tleman
found means to insinuate himself so far in∣to
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
to the confidence of the count, as to learn the
cause of that distress which he had observed in his
features at their first meeting; and being a gen∣tleman
of uncommon vivacity, as well as sincere∣ly
attached to the family of Melvile, to which he
had owed his promotion; he exerted all his good
humour and good sense, in amusing the fancy,
and reasoning down the mortification of the afflict∣ed
Hungarian. He, in particular, endeavoured to
wean his attention from the lost Monimia, by
engaging it upon his domestic affairs, and upon
the wrongs of his mother and sister, who, he gave
him to understand, were languishing under the
tyranny of his father-in-law.</P>
<P>This was a note that effectually roused him from
the lethargy of his sorrow; and the desire of taking
vengeance on the oppressor, who had ruined his
fortune, and made his nearest relations miserable,
so intirely engrossed his thoughts, as to leave no
room for other considerations. During their jour∣ney
to Austria, major Farrel (that was the name
of his fellow-traveller) informed him of many
circumstances touching his father's house, to which
himself was an utter stranger.</P>
<P>“The conduct of your mother, said he, in mar∣rying
count Trebasi, was not at all agreeable either
to the friends of the count de Melvile, or to her own
relations, who knew her second husband to be a
man of a violent temper, and rapacious disposition,
which the nature of his education and employment,
had served rather to inflame than allay; for you
well know he was a partizan during the whole
course of the late war. They were, moreover, e∣qually
surprized and chagrined, when they found she
took no step to prevent his seizing upon that in∣heritance
which of right belonged to you, and
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
which, by the laws of Hungary, is unalienable
from the heir of blood: nevertheless, they are
now fully convinced, that she hath more than suf∣ciently
attoned for her indiscretion, by the barba∣rity
of her husband, who hath not only secluded
her from all communication with her friends and
acquaintance, but even confined her to the west
tower of your father's house, where she is said to
be kept close prisoner, and subjected to all sorts of
inconvenience and mortification. This severity
she is believed to have incurred, in consequence of
having expostulated with him upon his unjust be∣haviour
to you and mademoiselle, whom he hath
actually shut up in some convent in Vienna, which
your relations have not as yet been able to disco∣ver:
but the memory of your noble father is so
dear to all those who were favoured with his friend∣ship;
and the sufferings of the countess and made∣moiselle
have raised such a spirit of resentment a∣gainst
her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but
your presence, to begin the prosecution, and give
a sanction to the measures of your friends, which
will, in a little time, restore your family to the
fruition of its rights and fortune: for my own
part, my dear count, I consider myself as one
wholly indebted to your house, for the rank and
expectation I now enjoy, and my finances, inte∣rest,
and person, such as they are, I dedicate to
your service.”</P>
<P>Renaldo was not slow in making his acknow∣ledgments
to this generous Hibernian, whom he
informed of his scheme, recounting to him his
uncommon transaction with the benevolent Jew,
and communicating the letters of recommenda∣tion
he had received by his means, to some of the
first noblemen at the Imperial court. Mean while,
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
he burned with impatience, to chastise count Tre∣basi
for his persidious conduct to the widow and
the fatherless, and would have taken the road to
Presburg, without touching at Vienna, in order to
call him to a severe account, had not he been stre∣nuously
opposed by major Farrel, who represented
the imprudence of taking such a step before he
had secured a proper protection from the conse∣quences
with which it might be attended.</P>
<P>“It is not,” said he, “your own life and for∣tune
only which depend upon your behaviour in
this emergency, but also the quiet and happiness
of those who are most dear to your affection:
not you alone, but likewise your mother and sister
would infallibly suffer by your temerity and preci∣pitation.
First of all, deliver your credentials at
court, and let us join our endeavours to raise an
interest strong enough to counterbalance that of
Trebasi. If we succeed, there will be no neces∣sity
for having recourse to personal measures: he
will be compelled to yield up your inheritance
which he unjustly detains, and to restore your
sister to your arms; and if he afterwards refuses
to do justice to the countess, you will always
have it in your power to evince yourself the son
of the brave count de Melvile.”</P>
<P>These just and salutary representations had a
due effect upon Renaldo, who no sooner arrived
at the capital of Austria, than he waited upon a
certain prince of distinction, to whose patronage
he was commended; and from whom he met
with a very cordial reception, not only on ac∣count
of his credentials, but also for the sake of
his father, who was well known to his highness.
He heard his complaints with great patience and
affability, assured him of his assistance and pro∣tection,
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
and even undertook to introduce him to
the empress queen, who would not suffer the
weakest of her subjects to be oppressed, much
less disregard the cause of an injured young no∣bleman
who by his own services and those of his
family was peculiarly intitled to her favour.</P>
<P>Nor was he the only person whose counte∣nance
and patronage Melvile sollicited upon this
occasion; he visited all the friends of his father,
and all his mother's relations, who were easily in∣terested
in his behalf; while major Farrel contri∣buted
all his efforts in strengthening the associa∣tion.
So that a law-suit was immediately com∣menced
against count Trebasi, who on his side
was not idle, but prepared with incredible in∣dustry
for the assault, resolving to maintain with
his whole power the acquisition he had made.</P>
<P>The laws of Hungary, like those of some other
countries I could name, afford so many subter∣fuges
for the purposes of perfidy and fraud, that
it is no wonder our youth began to complain of
the slow progress of his affair; especially as he
glowed with the most eager desire of redressing
the grievances of his parent and sister, whose suf∣ferings
he did not doubt were doubled since the
institution of his process against their tormentor.
He imparted his sentiments on this head to his
friend; and, as his apprehension every moment
increased, plainly told him he could no longer
live without making some effort to see those with
whom he was so nearly connected in point of
blood and affection: he therefore resolved to re∣pair
immediately to Presburg, and according to
the intelligence he should procure, essay to see
and converse with his mother, tho' at the hazard
of his life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Renaldo abridges the proceedings at law, and ap∣proves
himself the son of his father.</HEAD>
<P>THE major finding him determined, insisted
upon attending him in his expedition, and
they set out together for Presburg, where they
privately arrived in the dark, resolving to keep
themselves concealed at the house of a friend, un∣til
they should have formed some plan for their
future operations. Here they were informed that
count Trebasi's castle was altogether inaccessible;
that all the servants who were supposed to have
the least veneration or compassion for the coun∣tess,
were dismissed; and that since Renaldo was
known to be in Germany, the vigilance and cau∣tion
of that cruel husband were redoubled to such
a degree, that no body knew whether his un∣fortunate
lady was actually alive or dead.</P>
<P>Farrel perceiving Melvile exceedingly affected
with this intimation, and hearing him declare
that he would never quit Presburg until he should
have entered the house, and removed his doubts
on that interesting subject; not only argued with
great vehemence against such an attempt, as equal∣ly
dangerous and indiscreet, but solemnly swore
he would prevent his purpose, by discovering his
design to the family, unless he would promise to
listen to a more moderate and feasible expedient.
He then proposed that he himself should appear
in the equipage of one of those travelling Savoy∣ards
who stroll about Europe, amusing ignorant
people with the effects of a magic lanthorn, and
in that disguise endeavour to obtain admittance
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
from the servants of Trebasi, among whom he
might make such inquiries, as would deliver Mel∣vile
from his present uneasy suspence.</P>
<P>This proposal was embraced, tho' reluctantly
by Renaldo, who was unwilling to expose his
friend to the least danger or disgrace; and the
major being next day provided with the habit and
implements of his new profession, together with
a ragged attendant who preceded him, extorting
music from a paultry viole, approached the castle∣gate,
and proclaimed his shew so naturally in a
yell partaking of the scream of Savoy and the
howl of Ireland, that one would have imagined he
had been conductor to madam Catherina from his
cradle. So far his stratagem succeeded: he had
not long stood in waiting, before he was invited
into the court-yard, where the servants formed a
ring, and danced to the efforts of his companion's
skill; then he was conducted into the buttery,
where he exhibited his figures on the wall and his
princess on the floor; and while they regaled him
in this manner with scraps and sour wine, he took
occasion to inquire about the old lady and her
daughter, before whom he said he had performed
in his last peregrination. Tho' this question was
asked with all that air of simplicity which is pe∣culiar
to these people, one of the domestics took
the alarm, being infected with the suspicions of
his master, and plainly taxed the major with be∣ing
a spy, threatening at the same time that he
should be stripped and searched.</P>
<P>This would have been a very dangerous expe∣riment
for the Hibernian, who had actually in his
pocket a letter to the countess from her son,
which he hoped fortune might have furnished him
with an opportunity to deliver. When he there∣fore
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
found himself in this dilemma, he was not at
all easy in his own mind: however, instead of
protesting his innocence in an humble and be∣seeching
strain, in order to acquit himself of the
charge, he resolved to elude the suspicion by pro∣voking
the wrath of his accuser, and putting on
the air of vulgar integrity affronted, began to re∣proach
the servant in very insolent terms for his
unfair supposition, and undressing himself in a mo∣ment
to the skin, threw his tattered garments in
the face of his adversary, telling him he would
find nothing there which he would not be very
glad to part with; at the same time raising his
voice, he, in the gibberish of the clan he repre∣sented,
scolded and cursed with great fluency:
so that the whole house resounded with the noise.
The valet's jealousy, like a smaller fire, was in a
trice swallowed up in the greater flame of his rage
enkindled by this abrupt address: in consequence
of which, Farrel was kicked out at the gate,
naked as he was to the waist, after his lanthorn
had been broke to pieces on his head; and there
he was joined by his domestic, who had not been
able to recover his apparel and effect a retreat,
without incurring marks of the same sort of dis∣tinction.</P>
<P>The major, considering the risk he must have
run in being detected, thought himself cheaply
quit for this moderate discipline, though he was
really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who un∣derstanding
the particulars of the adventure, de∣termined,
as the last effort, to ride round the
castle in the open day, on pretence of taking the
air, when, peradventure, the countess would see
him from the place of her confinement, and fa∣vour
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
him with some mark or token of her being
alive.</P>
<P>Though his companion did not much relish this
plan, which he foresa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would expose him to the
insults of Trebasi; yet, as he could not contrive
a better, he acquiesced in Renaldo's invention,
with the proviso, that he would defer the execu∣tion
of it until his father-in-law should be absent
in the chase, which was a diversion he every day
enjoyed.</P>
<P>Accordingly they set a proper watch, and lay
concealed until they were informed of Trebasi's
having gone forth; when they mounted their
horses, and rode into the neighbourhood of the
tastle. Having made a small excursion in the ad∣joining
fields, they drew nearer the walls, and
at an easy pace had twice circled them, when
Farrel descried at the top of a tower, a white
handkerchief waved by a woman's hand thro' the
iron bars that secured the window. This signal
being pointed out to Renaldo, his heart began to
throb with great violence; he made a respectful
obeissance towards the part in which it appeared,
and perceiving the hand beckoning him to ap∣proach,
advanced to the very buttress of the tur∣ret;
upon which, seeing something drop, he
alighted with great expedition, and took up a pic∣ture
of his father in miniature, the features of
which he no sooner distinguished, than the tears
ran down his cheeks; he pressed the little image
to his lips with the most filial fervour; then con∣veying
it to his bosom, looked up to the hand,
which waved in such a manner, as gave him to
understand it was high time to retire. Being by
this time highly persuaded that his kind monitor
was no other than the countess herself, he pointed
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
to his heart, in token of his filial affection, and
laying his hand on his sword, to denote his reso∣lution
of doing her justice, he took his leave with
another profound bow, and suffered himself to
be reconducted to his lodging.</P>
<P>Every circumstance of this transaction was ob∣served
by the servants of count Trebasi, who im∣mediately
dispatched a messenger to their lord,
with an account of what had happened. Alarm∣ed
at this information, from which he immediate∣ly
concluded that the stranger was young Mel∣vile,
he forthwith quitted the chace, and return∣ing
to the castle by a private postern, ordered his
horse to be kept ready saddled, in hope that his
son-in-law would repeat the visit to his mother.
This precaution would have been to no purpose,
had Renaldo followed the advice of Farrel, who
represented the danger of returning to a place
where the alarm was undoubtedly given by his
first appearance; and exhorted him to return to
Vienna for the prosecution of his suit, now that
he was satisfied of his mother's being alive: in
order to strengthen this admonition, he bad him
recollect the signal for withdrawing, which was
doubtless the effect of maternal concern, inspired
by the knowledge of the count's vigilance and vin∣dictive
disposition.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these suggestions, Melvile per∣sisted
in his resolution of appearing once more be∣low
the tower, on the supposition that his mo∣ther,
in expectation of his return, had prepared
a billet for his acceptance, from which he might
obtain important intelligence. The major seeing
him lend a deaf ear to his remonstrances, was
contented to attend him in this second <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
he pressed him to undertake that sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
afternoon, as Trebasi had taken care to circu∣late
a report of his having gone to dine at the
seat of a nobleman in the neighbourhood. Our
knight-errant and his squire, deceived by this
finesse, presented themselves again under the pri∣son
of the countess, who no sooner beheld her
son return, than she earnestly intreated him to
be gone, by the same sign which she had before
used; and he taking it for granted that she was
debarred the use of pen, ink and paper, and that
he had nothing more to expect, consented to
retire, and had already moved to some distance
from the house, when, in crossing a small plan∣tation
that belonged to the castle, they were met
by count Trebasi and another person on horse∣back.</P>
<P>At sight of this apparition, the blood mounted
into Renaldo's cheeks, and his eyes began to
lighten with eagerness and indignation; which
was not at all diminished by the ferocious ad∣dress
of the count, who, advancing to Melvile,
with a menacing air, “Before you proceed,”
said he, “I must know with what view you
have been twice to-day patroling round my in∣closures,
and reconnoitring the different avenues
of my house: you likewise carry on a clandestine
correspondence with some person in the family,
of which my honour obliges me to demand an ex∣planation.”</P>
<P>“Had your actions been always regulated by
the dictates of honour; replied Renaldo, I should
never have been questioned for riding round that
castle which you know is my rightful inheritance;
or excluded from the sight of a parent who suffers
under your tyranny and oppression. It is my part,
therefore, to expostulate; and, since fortune hath
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
favoured me with an opportunity of revenging our
wrongs in person, we shall not part until you have
learned that the family of the count de Melvile is
not to be injured with impunity. Here is no ad∣vantage
on either side, in point of arms or num∣ber,
you are better mounted than I am, and shall
have the choice of the ground on which our
difference ought to be brought to a speedy deter∣mination.”</P>
<P>Trebasi, whose courage was not of the senti∣mental
kind, but purely owing to his natural in∣sensibility
of danger, instead of concerting mea∣sures
coolly for the engagement, or making any
verbal reply to this defiance, drew a pistol with∣out
the least hesitation, and fired it at the face of
Renaldo, part of whose left eye brow was carried
off by the ball. Melvile was not slow in return∣ing
the compliment, which, as it was deliberate,
proved the more decisive: for the shot entering
the count's right breast, made its way to the back
bone with such a shock, as struck him to the
ground; upon which the other alighted, in or∣der
to improve the advantage he had gained.</P>
<P>During this transaction, Farrel had well nigh
lost his life by the savage behaviour of Trebasi's
attendant, who had been a hussar officer, and
who thinking it was his duty to imitate the ex∣ample
of his patron on this occasion, discharged
a pistol at the major before he had the least in∣timation
of his design. The Hibernian's horse
being a common hireling, and unaccustomed to
stand fire, no sooner saw the flash of Trebasi's
pistol, than starting aside, he happened to plunge
into a hole, and was overturned at the very in∣stant
when the hussar's piece went off, so that no
damage ensued to his rider, who pitching on his
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
feet, flew with great nimbleness to his adversary,
then laying hold on one leg, dismounted him in a
twinkling, and seizing his throat as he lay, would
have soon dispatched him without the use of fire∣arms,
had he not been prevented by his friend
Renaldo, who desired him to desist, observing
that his vengeance was already satisfied, as the
count seemed to be in the agonies of death. The
major was loth to quit his prey, as he thought
his aggressor had acted in a treacherous manner;
but recollecting that there was no time to lose,
because, in all probability, the firing had alarmed
the castle, he took his leave of the vanquished hus∣sar,
with a couple of hearty kicks, and mounting
his horse, followed Melvile to the house of a gen∣tleman
in the neighbourhood, who was kinsman
to the countess, and very well disposed to grant
him a secure retreat, until the troublesome con∣sequences
of this rencounter should be over∣blown.</P>
<P>Trebasi, though to the young gentleman he
seemed speechless and insensible, had neither lost
the use of his reason, nor of his tongue, but af∣fected
that extremity, in order to avoid any fur∣ther
conversation with the victor. He was one
of those people who never think of death until he
knocks at the door, and then earnestly intreat
him to excuse them for the present, and be so
good as to call another time. The count had so
often escaped unhurt, in the course of his cam∣paigns,
that he looked upon himself as invulne∣rable,
and set all danger at defiance. Though
he had hitherto taken no care of the concerns of
his soul, he had a large fund of superstition at
bottom; and when the surgeon who examined
his wound, declared it was mortal, all the terrors
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
of futurity took hold on his imagination, and all
the misdemeanours of his life presented themselves
in aggravated colours to his recollection.</P>
<P>He implored the spiritual assistance of a good
priest in the neighbourhood, who, in the dis∣charge
of his own conscience, gave him to under∣stand,
that he had little mercy to expect, unless
he would, as much as lay in his power, redress
the injuries he had done to his fellow-creatures.
As nothing lay heavier upon his soul than the
cruelty and fraud he had practised upon the fami∣ly
of count Melvile, he earnestly besought this
charitable clergyman to mediate his pardon with
the countess, and at the same time desired to see
Renaldo before his death, that he might put him
in possession of his paternal estate, and sollicit his
forgiveness for the offence he had given.</P>
<P>His lady, far from waiting for the priest's in∣tercession,
no sooner understood the lamentable
situation of her husband, and found herself at li∣berty,
than she hastened to his apartment, ex∣pressed
the utmost concern for his misfortune, and
tended him with truly conjugal tenderness and
fidelity. Her son gladly obeyed the summons,
and was received with great civility and satisfac∣tion
by his father-in-law, who, in presence of the
judge and divers gentlemen assembled for that pur∣pose,
renounced all right and title to the fortune
he had so unjustly usurped; disclosed the name
of the convent to which mademoiselle de Mel∣vile
he had been conveyed, dismissed all the agents of
his iniquity, and being reconciled to his son-in-law,
began to prepare himself in tranquillity for
his latter end.</P>
<P>The countess was overwhelmed with an ex∣cess
of joy, while she embraced her long lost son,
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
who had proved himself so worthy of his father.
Yet this joy was imbittered, by reflecting that she
was made a widow by the hands of that darling
son: for, though she knew his honour demanded
the sacrifice, she could not lay aside that regard
and veneration which is attached to the name of
husband; and therefore resolved to retire into a
monastry, where she could spend the remainder
of her life in devotion, without being exposed to
any intercourse which might interfere with the
delicacy of her sentiments on that subject.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is the messenger of happiness to his sister, who
removes the film which had long obstructed his
penetration, with regard to count Fathom.</HEAD>
<P>AS the most endearing affection had always
subsisted between Renaldo and his sister,
he would not one moment deny himself the plea∣sure
of slying to her embrace, and of being the
glad messenger of her deliverance. Soon, there∣fore,
as he understood the place of her retreat,
and had obtained a proper order to the abbess,
signed by count Trebasi, he set out post for
Vienna, still accompanied by his faithful Hiber∣nian,
and arriving at the convent, found the ab∣bess
and the whole house so engrossed in mak∣ing
preparations for the ceremony of giving the
veil next day to a young woman who had fulfil∣led
the term of her probation, that he could not
possibly see his sister with that leisure and satisfac∣tion
which he had flattered himself with enjoying
at this meeting; and therefore he was fain to
bridle his impatience for two days, and keep his
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
credentials until the hurry should be over, that
mademoiselle might have no intimation of her
good fortune, except from his own mouth.</P>
<P>In order to fill up this tedious interval, he vi∣sited
his friends at court, who were rejoiced to
hear the happy issue of his excursion to Presburg;
the prince who was his particular patron desired he
would make himself perfectly easy with regard to
the death of count Trebasi, for he would take
care to represent him in such a light to the em∣press
queen, as would screen him from any dan∣ger
or prosecution on that account. His High∣ness,
moreover, appointed the following day for
performing the promise he had made of present∣ing
him to that august princess, and in the mean
time prepossessed her so much in his favour, that
when he approached her presence, and was an∣nounced
by his noble introductor, she eyed him
with a look of peculiar complacency, saying,
“I am glad to see you returned to my domi∣nions.
Your father was a gallant officer, who
served our house with equal courage and fidelity;
and as I understand you tread in his foot-steps,
you may depend upon my favour and protec∣tion.”</P>
<P>He was so much overwhelmed with this graci∣ous
reception, that, while he bowed in silence,
the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes;
and her imperial majesty was so well pleased with
this manifestation of his heart, that she immedi∣ately
gave directions for promoting him to the
command of a troop of horse.—Thus fortune
seemed willing and indeed eager to discharge the
debt she owed him for the different calamities he
had undergone. And as he looked upon the ge∣nerous
Hebrew to be the sole source of his suc∣cess,
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
he did not fail to make him acquainted with
the happy effects of his recommendation and
friendship, and to express, in the warmest terms,
the deep sense he had of his uncommon benevo∣lence,
which, by the bye, was still greater with
regard to Renaldo, than the reader as yet ima∣gines;
for he not only furnished him with money
for his present occasions, but also given him an
unlimited credit on a banker in Vienna to whom
one of his letters was directed.</P>
<P>The ceremony of the nun's admission being
now performed, and the convent restored to its
former quiet, Melvile hasted thither on the wings
of brotherly affection, and presented his letter to
the abbess, who having perused the contents, by
which she learned that the family disquiets of
count Trebasi no longer subsisted, and that the
bearer was the brother of mademoiselle, she re∣ceived
him with great politeness, congratulated
him on this happy event, and begging he would
excuse her staying with him in the parlour, on
pretence of business, withdrew, saying, she would
immediately send in a young lady who would con∣sole
him for her absence. In a few minutes he
was joined by his sister, who, expecting nothing
less than to see Renaldo, no sooner distinguished
his features, than she shriek'd aloud with surprize,
and would have sunk upon the floor, had not he
supported her in his embrace.</P>
<P>Such a sudden apparition of her brother at any
time, or in any place, after their long separation,
would have strongly affected this sensible young
lady: but to find him so abruptly in a place
where she thought herself buried from the know∣ledge
of all her relations, occasioned such com∣motion
in her spirits as had well nigh endangered
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
her reason: for it was not 'till after a considera∣ble
pause, that she could talk to him with con∣nexion
or coherence. However, as those trans∣ports
subsided, they entered into a more delibe∣rate
and agreeable conversation; in the course of
which, he gradually informed her of what had
passed at the castle; and inexpressible was the
pleasure she felt in learning that her mother was
released from captivity, herself restored to free∣dom,
and her brother to the possession of his
lawful inheritance, by the only means to which
she had always prayed these blessings might be
owing.</P>
<P>As she had been treated with uncommon hu∣manity
by the abbess, she would not consent to
leave the convent until he should be ready to set
out for Presburg; so that they dined together with
that good lady, and passed the afternoon in that
mutual communication with which a brother and
sster may be supposed to entertain themselves on
such an occasion. She gave him a detail of the
insults and mortifications she had suffered from the
brutality of her father-in-law, and told him, that
her confinement in this monastry was owing to
Trebasi's having intercepted a letter to her from
Renaldo, signifying his intention to return to the
empire, in order to assert his own right and redress
her grievances. Then turning the discourse upon
the incidents of his peregrinations, she in a par∣ticular
manner inquired about that exquisite beau∣ty
who had been the innocent source of all his
distresses, and upon whose perfections he had often,
in his letters to his sister, expatiated with in∣dications
of rapture and delight.</P>
<P>This inquiry in a moment blew up that scorch∣ing
flame which had been well nigh stifled by
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
other necessary avocations. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s eyes gleamed,
his cheeks glowed and grew pale alternately, and
his whole frame underwent an immediate agita∣tion;
which being perceived by mademoiselle,
she concluded that some new calamity was an∣nexed
to the name of Monimia, and dreading to
rip up a wound which she saw was so ineffectu∣ally
closed, she for the present suppressed her cu∣riosity
and concern, and industriously endeavour∣ed
to introduce some less affecting subject of con∣versation.
He saw her aim, approved of her
discretion, and joining her endeavours, expressed
his surprize at her having omitted to signify the
least remembrance of her old favourite Fathom,
whom he had left in England. He had no
sooner pronounced this name than she suffered
some confusion in her turn; from which, how∣ever,
recollecting herself, “Brother,” said she,
“you must endeavour to forget that wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch, who
is altogether unworthy of retaining the smallest
share of your regard.”</P>
<P>Astonished and indeed angry at this expression,
which he considered as the effect of malicious
misrepresentation, he gently chid her for her cre∣dulity
in believing the envious aspersion of some
person who repined at the superior virtue of
Fathom, whom he affirmed to be an honour to
the human species.</P>
<P>“Nothing is more easy,” replied the young
lady, “than to impose upon a person, who, be∣ing
himself unconscious of guile, suspects no de∣ceit.
You have been a dupe, dear brother, not
to the finesse of Fathom, but to the sincerity of
your own heart. For my own part, I assume no
honour to my own penetration in having compre∣hended
the villainy of that impostor, which was
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
discovered in more than one instance by acci∣dents
I could not possibly foresee.</P>
<P>You must know that Teresa, who attended
me from my childhood, and in whose honesty I
reposed such confidence, having disobliged some
of the inferior servants, was so narrowly watched
in all her transactions, as to be at last detected
in the very act of conveying a piece of plate,
which was actually found concealed among her
cloaths.</P>
<P>You may guess how much I was astonished
when I understood this circumstance; I could
not trust to the evidence of my own senses,
and should have still believed her innocent, in
spite of ocular demonstration, had not she, in
the terrors of being tried for felony, promised to
make a very material discovery to the countess,
provided she would take such measures as would
save her life.</P>
<P>This request being complied with, she, in my
hearing, opened up such an amazing scene of ini∣quity,
baseness and ingratitude, which had been
acted by her and Fathom, in order to defraud the
family to which they were so much indebted, that
I could not have believed the human mind capa∣ble
of such degeneracy, or that traitor endowed
with such pernicious cunning and dissimulation,
had not her tale been congruous, consistent and
distinct, and fraught with circumstances that left
no room to doubt the least article of her confes∣sion:
on consideration of which, she was per∣mitted
to go into voluntary exile.”</P>
<P>She then explained their combination in all the
particulars, as we have already recounted them
in their proper place; and, finally, observed, that
the opinion she had hence conceived of Fathom's
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
character, was confirmed by what she had since
learned of his perfidious conduct towards that
very nun who had lately taken the veil.</P>
<P>Perceiving her brother struck dumb with asto∣nishment,
and gaping with the most eager atten∣tion,
she proceeded to relate the incidents of his
double intrigue with the jeweller's wife and
daughter, as they were communicated to her by
the nun, who was no other than the individual
Wilhelmina. After those rivals had been for∣saken
by their gallant, their mutual animosities
and chagrin served to whet the attention and in∣vention
of each; so that in a little time the whole
mystery stood disclosed to both. The mother had
discovered the daughter's correspondence with
Fathom, as we have formerly observed, by means
of that unfortunate letter which he unwittingly
committed to the charge of the old beldame; and
as soon as she understood he was without the
reach of all sollicitation or prosecution, imparted
this billet to her husband, whose fury was so un∣governable,
that he had almost sacrificed Wilhel∣mina
with his own hands, especially when terrified
by his threats and imprecations, she owned that
she had bestowed the chain on this perfidious
lover. However, his dreadful purpose was pre∣vented,
partly by the interposition of his wife,
whose aim was not the death but immurement
of his daughter, and partly by the tears and
supplication of the young gentlewoman herself,
who protested, that, although the ceremony of
the church had not been performed, she was con∣tracted
to Fathom by the most solemn vows, to
witness which, he invoked all the faints in Hea∣ven.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205"/>
The jeweller, upon cooler consideration, was
unwilling to lose the least spark of hope that glit∣tered
among the ruins of his despair, and resisted
all the importunities of his wife, who pressed him
to consult the welfare of his daughter's soul, in
the fond expectation of finding some expedient to
lure back the chain and it's possessor. In the
mean time Wilhelmina was daily and hourly ex∣posed
to the mortifying animadversions of her
mamma, who, with all the insolence of virtue,
incessantly upbraided her with the backslidings of
her vicious life, and exhorted her to reformation
and repentance. This continual triumph lasted
for many months, 'till at length a quarrel hap∣pening
between the mother and the gossip at
whose house she used to give the rendezvous to
her admirers, that incensed confidante, in the
precipitation of her anger, promulgated the his∣tory
of those secret meetings, and, among the
rest, her interviews with Fathom were brought
to light.</P>
<P>The first people who hear news of this sort,
are generally those to whom they are most un∣welcome.
The German was soon apprised of his
wife's frailty, and considered the two females of
his house as a couple of devils incarnate, sent
from hell to exercise his patience: yet, in the
midst of his displeasure he found matter of con∣solation,
in being furnished with a sufficient rea∣son
for parting with his help-mate, who had for
many years kept his family in disquiet. He there∣fore,
without hazarding a personal conference,
sent proposals to her by a friend, which she did
not think proper to reject: and seeing himself re∣stored
to the dominion of his own house, exerted
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
his sway so tyrannically, that Wilhelmina became
weary of her life, and had recourse to the com∣forts
of religion, of which she soon became ena∣moured,
and begged her father's permission to
dedicate the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of her life to the duties of de∣votion.
She was accordingly received in this con∣vent;
the regulations of which were so much to
her liking, that she performed the task of proba∣tion
with pleasure, and voluntarily excluded her∣self
from the vanities of this life. It was here
she had contracted an acquaintance with made∣moiselle
de Melvile, to whom she communicated
her complaints of Fathom, on the supposition
that he was related to the count, as he himself
had often declared.</P>
<P>While the young lady rehearsed the particu∣lars
of this detail, Renaldo sustained a strange
vicissitude of different passions. Surprize, sorrow,
fear, hope and indignation raised a most tumul∣tuous
conflict in his bosom. Monimia rushed
upon his imagination in the character of inno∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence
betrayed by the insinuations of treachery.
He with horror viewed her at the mercy of a
villain, who had broken all the ties of gratitude
and honour.</P>
<P>Affrighted at the prospect, he started from his
seat, exclaiming in the unconnected strain of dis∣traction
and despair: “Have I then nourished
a serpent in my bosom! Have I listened to the
voice of a traitor who hath murdered my peace!
who hath tore my heart-strings asunder, and
perhaps ruined the pattern of all earthly perfec∣tion.
It cannot be. Heaven would not suffer
such infernal artifice to take effect. The thun∣der
would be levelled against the head of the ac∣cursed
projector.”</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207"/>
From this transport, compared with his agita∣tion
when she mentioned Monimia, his sister
judged that Fathom had been the occasion of a
breach between the two lovers; and this conjec∣ture
being confirmed by the disjointed answers he
made to her interrogations upon the affair, she
endeavoured to calm his apprehensions, by repre∣senting
that he would soon have an opportunity of
returning to England, where the misunderstand∣ing
might be easily cleared up; and that, in the
mean time, he had nothing to fear on account of
the person of his mistress, in a country where in∣dividuals
were so well protected by the laws and
constitution of the realm. At length he suffered
himself to be flattered with the fond hope of see∣ing
Monimia's character triumph in the inquiry;
of retrieving that lost jewel, and of renewing
that ravishing intercourse and exalted expectation
which had been so cruelly cut off. He now
wished to find Fathom as black as he had been
exhibited, that Monimia's apostacy might be
numbered among the misrepresentations of his
treachery and fraud.</P>
<P>His love, which was alike generous and ar∣dent,
espoused the cause, and he no longer
doubted her constancy and virtue: but when he
reflected how her tender heart must have been
wrung with anguish at his unkindness and cruel∣ty,
in leaving her destitute in a foreign land; how
her sensibility must have been tortured in find∣ing
herself altogether dependent upon a ruffian,
who certainly harboured the most baleful designs
upon her honour; how her life must be endan∣gered
both by his barbarity and her own despair:
I say, when he reflected on these circumstances,
he shuddered with horrour and dismay; and that
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
very night dispatched a letter to his friend the
Jew, intreating him, in the most pressing man∣ner,
to employ all his intelligence in learning the
situation of the fair orphan, that she might be
protected from the villany of Fathom, until his
return to England.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="60" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He recompenses the attachment of his friend: and
receives a letter that reduces him to the verge of
death and distraction.</HEAD>
<P>THIS step being taken, his mind in some
measure retrieved its former tranquillity:
he soothed himself with the prospect of an happy
reconciliation with the divine Monimia, and his
fancy was decoyed from every disagreeable pre∣sage
by the entertaining conversation of his sister,
with whom in two days he set out for Presburg,
attended by his friend the major, who had ne∣ver
quitted him since their meeting at Brussels.
Here they found count Trebasi entirely rid of the
fever which had been occasioned by his wound,
and in a fair way of doing well; a circumstance
that afforded unspeakable pleasure to Melvile,
whose manner of thinking was such, as would
have made him unhappy, could he have charged
himself with the death of his mother's husband,
howsoever criminal he might have been.</P>
<P>The count's ferocity did not return with his
health: his eyes were opened by the danger he
had incurred, and his sentiments turned in a new
channel: he heartily asked pardon of mademoi∣selle
for the rigorous usage she had suffered from
the violence of his temper; thanked Renaldo for
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
the seasonable lesson he had administered to him;
and not only insisted upon being removed from
the castle to an house of his own in Presburg, but
proffered to make immediate restitution of all the
rents which he had unjustly converted to his own
use.</P>
<P>These things being settled in the most amica∣ble
manner, to the entire satisfaction of the par∣ties
concerned, as well as of the neighbouring
noblesse, among whom the house of Melvile was
in universal esteem, Renaldo resolved to sollicit
leave at the Imperial court to return to England,
in order to investigate that affair of Monimia,
which was more interesting than all the points he
had hitherto adjusted: but, before he quitted
Presburg, his friend Farrel taking him aside one
day, “Count,” said he, “will you give me
leave to ask, if, by my zeal and attachment for
you, I have had the good fortune to acquire your
esteem?” “To doubt that esteem,” replied
Renaldo, “were to suspect my gratitude and
honour, of which I must be utterly destitute be∣fore
I lose the sense of those obligations I owe to
your gallantry and friendship: obligations which
I long for a proper occasion to repay.”</P>
<P>“Well then,” resumed the major, “I will
deal with you like a downright Swiss, and point
out a method by which you may shift the load
of obligation from your own shoulders to mine.
You know my birth, rank and expectations in
the service: but perhaps you do not know, that,
as my expence hath always unavoidably exceeded
my income, I find myself a little out at elbows
in my circumstances, and want to piece them up
by matrimony. Of those ladies with whom I
think I have any chance of succeeding, made∣moiselle
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
de Melvile seems the best qualified to
render my situation happy in all respects. Her
fortune is more than sufficient to disembarrass my
affairs; her good sense will be a seasonable check
upon my vivacity; her agreeable accomplishments
will engage a continuation of affection and re∣gard:
I know my own disposition well enough to
think I shall become a most du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ful and tractable
husband; and shall deem myself highly honoured
in being more closely united to my dear count de
Melvile, the son and representative of that worthy
officer under whom my youth was formed: if
you will therefore sanction my claim, I will
forthwith begin my approaches, and doubt not,
under your auspices, to bring the place to a ca∣pitulation.”</P>
<P>Renaldo was pleased with the frankness of this
declaration, approved of his demand, and desired
him to depend upon his good offices with his si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er,
whom he sounded, that same evening, upon the
subject, recommending the major to her favour,
as a gentleman well worthy of her choice. Ma∣demoiselle,
who had never been exercised in the
coquetries of her sex, and was now arrived at
those years, when the vanity of youth ought to
yield to discretion, considered, the proposal as a
philosopher, and after due deliberation, candidly
owned she had no objection to the match. Far∣rel
was accordingly introduced in the character of
a lover, after the permission of the countess had
been obtained; and he carried on his addresses in
the usual form, so much to the satisfaction of all
concerned in the event, that a day was appointed
for the celebration of his nuptials, when he en∣tered
into peaceable possession of his prize.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211"/>
A few days after this joyful occasion, while
Renaldo was at Vienna, where he had been in∣dulged
with leave of absence for six months, and
employed in making preparations for his journey
to Britain, he was one evening presented, by his
servant, with a pacquet from London, which he
no sooner opened, than he found inclosed a letter
directed to him, in the hand-writing of Monimia.
He was so much affected at sight of those well-known
characters, that he stood motionless as a
statue, eager to know the contents, yet afraid to
peruse the billet. While he hesitated in this sus∣pence,
he chanced to cast his eye on the inside of
the cover, and perceived the name of his Jewish
friend at the bottom of a few lines, importing,
that the inclosed was delivered to him by a physi∣cian
of his acquaintance, who had recommended
it in a particular manner to his care. This inti∣mation
served only to encrease the mystery, and
whet his impatience; and as he had the explana∣tion
in his hand, he summoned all his resolution
to his aid, and breaking the seal, began to read
these words, “Renaldo will not suppose, that
this address proceeds from interested motives,
when he learns, that, before it can be presented
to his view, the unfortunate Monimia will be no
more.”</P>
<P>Here the light forsook Renaldo's eyes, his
knees knocked together, and he fell at full length
insensible on the floor: his valet hearing the
noise, ran into the apartment, lifted him upon a
couch, and dispatched a messenger for proper as∣sistance,
while he himself endeavoured to recal his
spirits by such applications as chance afforded:
but before the count exhibited any signs of life,
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
his brother-in-law entered his chamber by acci∣dent,
and as soon as he recollected himself from
the extreme confusion and concern produced by
this melancholy spectacle, he perceived the fatal
epistle which Melvile, though insensible, still kept
within his grasp; justly suspecting this to be the
cause of that severe paroxysm, he drew near the
couch, and with difficulty read what is above re∣hearsed,
and the sequel, to this effect.</P>
<P>“Yes, I have taken such measures as will pre∣vent
it from falling into your hands, until after I
shall have been released from a being imbittered
with inexpressible misery and anguish. It is
not my intention, once loved, and ah! still too
fondly remembered youth, to upbraid you as the
source of that unceasing woe, which hath been so
long the sole inhabitant of my lonely bosom. I
will not call you inconstant or unkind. I dare
not think you base or dishonourable; yet I was
abruptly sacrificed to a triumphant rival, before I
had learned to bear such mortification; before I
had overcome the prejudices which I had imbibed
in my father's house. I was all at once abandon∣ed
to despair, to indigence and distress, to the vile
practices of a villain, who, I fear, hath betrayed
us both. What have not I suffered from the in∣sults
and vicious designs of that wretch, whom you
cherished in your bosom! yet to these I owe this
near approach to that goal of peace, where the
canker-worm of sorrow will expire. Beware of
that artful traitor; and, oh! endeavour to over∣come
that levity of disposition, which, if indulged,
will not only stain your reputation, but also de∣bauch
the good qualities of your heart. I release
you, in the sight of heaven, from all obligations:
if I have been injured, let not my wrongs be vi∣sited
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
on the head of Renaldo, for whom shall be
offered up the last servent prayers of the hapless
Monimia.”</P>
<P>This letter was a clue to the labyrinth of Mel∣vile's
distress: though the major had never heard
him mention the name of this beauty, he had re∣ceived
such hints from his own wife, as enabled
him to comprehend the whole of the count's dis∣aster.
By the administration of stimulating me∣dicines,
Renaldo recovered his perception: but
this was a cruel alternative, considering the situa∣tion
of his thoughts. The first word he pronounced
was Monimia, with all the emphasis of the most
violent despair: he perused the letter, and poured
forth incoherent execrations against Fathom and
himself. He exclaimed in a frantic tone, “she is
lost for ever! murthered by my unkindness! we
are both undone by the infernal arts of Fathom!
execrable monster! Restore her to my arms. If
thou art not a fiend in reality, I will tear out thy
false heart!”</P>
<P>So saying, he sprung upon his valet, who would
have fallen a sacrifice to his undistinguishing fury,
had not he been saved by the interposition of Farrel
and the family, who disengaged him from his ma∣ster's
gripe by dint of force; yet, notwithstanding
their joint endeavours, he broke from this re∣straint,
leaped upon the floor, and seizing his
sword, attempted to plunge it in his own breast.
When he was once more overcome by numbers,
he cursed himself, and all those who withheld him;
swore he would not survive the fair victim who
had perished by his credulity and indiscretion; and
the agitation of his spirits increased to such a de∣gree,
that he was seized with strong convulsions,
which nature was scarce able to sustain: every
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
medical expedient was used to quiet this perturba∣tion,
which at length yielded so far as to subside
into a continual sever, and confirmed delirium,
during which he ceased not to pour forth the most
pathetic complaints touching his ruined love, and
to rave about the ill-starred Monimia. The ma∣jor,
half distracted by the calamity of his friend,
would have concealed it from the knowledge of
his family, had not the physician, by despairing
of his life, laid him under the necessity of making
them acquainted with his condition.</P>
<P>The countess and mrs. Farrel were no sooner
informed of his case, than they hasted to the me∣lancholy
scene, where they found Renaldo de∣prived
of his senses, panting under the rage of an
exasperated disease. They saw his face distorted,
and his eyes glaring with frenzy: they heard him
invoke the name of Monimia, with a tenderness
of accent, which even the impulse of madness
could not destroy. Then with a sudden transi∣tion
of tone and gesture, he denounced vengeance
against her betrayer, and called upon the north
wind to cool the fervour of his brain. His hair
hung in dishevelled parcels, his cheeks were wan,
his looks ghastly, his vigour was fled, and all the
glory of his youth faded: the physician hung his
head in silence, the attendants wrung their hands
in despair, and the countenance of his friend was
bathed in tears.</P>
<P>Such a picture would have moved the most ob∣durate
heart: what impression then must it have
made upon a parent and sister, melting with all the
enthusiasm of affection! The mother was struck
dumb, and stupified with grief: the sister threw
herself on the bed, in a transport of sorrow,
caught her loved Renaldo in her arms, and was,
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
with great difficulty, tore from his embrace. Such
was the dismal reverse that overtook the late so
happy family of Melvile: such was the extremity
to which the treachery of Fathom had reduced
his best benefactor!</P>
<P>Three days did nature struggle with surprising
efforts, and then the constitution seemed to sink
under the victorious sever; yet, as his strength
diminished, his delirium abated, and on the fifth
morning he looked round, and recognized his
weeping friends. Though now exhausted to the
lowest ebb of life, he retained the perfect use of
speech, and his reason being quite unclouded,
spoke to each with equal kindness and composure:
he congratulated himself upon the sight of shore,
after the horrors of such a tempest; called upon
the countess and his sister, who were not permited
to see him at such a conjuncture, and being ap∣prized
by the major, of his reason for excluding
them from her presence, he applauded his con∣cern,
bequeathed them to his future care, and
took leave of that gentleman with a cordial em∣brace.
Then he desired to be left in private with
a certain clergyman, who regulated the concerns
of his soul; and he being dismissed, turned his
face from the light, in expectation of his final
discharge: in a few minutes all was still and
dreary; he was no longer heard to breathe, no
more the stream of life was perceived to circu∣late;
he was supposed to be absolved from all his
cares, and an universal groan from the by-standers
anounced the decease of the gallant, generous,
and tender-hearted Renaldo.</P>
<P>“Come hither ye whom the pride of youth and
health, of birth and affluence inflames, who tread
the flowery maze of pleasure, trusting to the
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
fruition of ever-circling joys: ye who glory in
your accomplishments, who indulge the views of
ambition, and lay schemes for future happiness
and grandeur; contemplate here the vanity of
life: behold how low this excellent young man is
laid! mowed down even in the blossom of his
youth, when fortune seemed to open all her trea∣sures
to his worth!”</P>
<P>Such were the reflections of the generous Far∣rel,
who, while he performed the last office of
friendship, in closing the eyes of the much-lamented
Melvile, perceived a warmth on the skin, which
the hand of death seldom leaves unextinguished:
this uncommon sensation he reported to the phy∣sician,
who, though he could feel no pulsation in
the heart or arteries, conjectured, that life still
lingered in some of its interior haunts, and imme∣diately
ordered such applications to the extremi∣ties
and surface of the body, as might help to con∣centrate
and reinforce the natural heat.</P>
<P>By these prescriptions, which, for some time,
produced no sensible effect, the embers were, in
all probability, kept glowing, and the vital power
revived; for, after a considerable pause, respira∣tion
was gradually renewed at long intervals, a
languid motion was perceived at the heart, a few
feeble and irregular pulsations were felt at the
wrist; the clay-coloured livery of death began to
vanish from his face; the circulation acquired
new force, and he opened his eyes with a sigh,
which proclaimed his return from the shades of
death.</P>
<P>When he recovered the faculty of swallowing,
a cordial was administered; and whether the fe∣ver
abated, in consequence of the blood's being
cooled and condensed during the recess of action
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
in the solids, or nature, in that agony, had pre∣pared
a proper channel for the expulsion of the
disease; certain it is, he was, from this moment,
rid of all bodily pain, he retrieved the animal
functions, and nothing remained of his malady
but an extreme weakness and languor, the effect
of nature's being fatigued in the battle she had
won.</P>
<P>Unutterable was the joy that took possession of
his mother and sister, when Farrel flew into their
apartment, to intimate this happy turn. Scarce
could they be restrained from pouring forth their
transports in the presence of Renaldo, who was
still too feeble to endure such communication:
indeed he was extremely mortified and dejected
at this event, which had diffused such pleasure and
satisfaction among his friends; for though his di∣stemper
was mastered, the fatal cause of it still
rankled at his heart, and he considered this re∣spite
from death as a protraction of his misery.</P>
<P>When he was congratulated by the major, on
the triumph of his constitution, he replied, with a
groan, “I would to heaven it had been other∣wise;
for I am reserved for all the horrors of the
most poignant sorrow and remorse. O Moni∣mia!
Monimia! I hoped, by this time, to have
convinced thy gentle shade, that I was, at least
intentionally, innocent of that ruthless barbarity
which hath brought thee to an untimely grave.
Heaven and earth! do I still survive the con∣sciousness
of that dire catastrophe! and lives the
atrocious villain who hath blasted all our hopes!”</P>
<P>With these last words, the fire darted from his
eyes, and his brother, snatching this occasional
handle for reconciling him to life, joined in his
exclamations against the treacherous Fathom, and
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
observed, that he should not, in point of honour,
wish to die, until he should have sacrificed that
traitor to the manes of the beauteous Monimia.
This incitement acted as a spur upon exhausted
nature, causing the blood to circulate with fresh
vigour, and encouraging him to take such suste∣nance
as would recruit his strength, and repair
the damage which his health had sustained.</P>
<P>His sister assiduously attended him in his reco∣very,
flattering his appetite, and amusing his sor∣row
at the same time; the clergyman assailed his
despondence with religious weapons, as well as
with arguments drawn from philosophy; and the
fury of his passions being already expended, he
became so tractable as to listen to his remon∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ances:
but notwithstanding the joint endea∣vours
of all his friends, a deep-fixed melancholy
remained, after every consequence of his disease
had vanished: in vain they assayed to elude his
grief by g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iety and diversions; in vain they
tried to decoy his heart into some new engage∣ment.</P>
<P>These kind attempts served only to feed and
nourish that melancholy which-pined within his
bosom. Monimia still haunted him in the midst
of these amusements, while his reflection whisper∣ed
to him, “Pleasures like these I might have
relished with her participation.” That darling
idea mingled in all the female assemblies at which
he was present, eclipsing their attractions, and
inhancing the bitterness of his loss; for absence,
enthusiasm, and even his despair had heightened
the charms of the fair orphan into something su∣pernatural
and divine.</P>
<P>Time, that commonly weakens <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he traces of
remembrance, seemed to deepen its impressions
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
in his breast: nightly, in his dreams, did he con∣verse
with his dear Monimia: sometimes on the
verdant bank of a delightful stream, where he
breathed, in soft murmurs, the dictates of his love
and admiration: sometimes reclined within the
tufted grove, his arm encircled and sustained her
snowy neck, whilst she, with looks of love ineffa∣ble,
gazed on his face, invoking heaven to bless
her husband and her lord: yet, even in these illu∣sions,
was his fancy oft alarmed for the ill-fated
fair: sometimes he viewed her tottering on the
brink of a steep precipice, far distant from his
helping hand: at other times she seemed to sail
along the boisterous tide, imploring his assistance:
then would he start with horror from his sleep,
and feel his sorrows more than realized: he de∣serted
his couch: he avoided the society of man∣kind:
he courted sequestered shades, where he
could indulge his melancholy; there his mind
brooded over his calamity, until his imagination
became familiar with all the ravages of death: it
contemplated the gradual decline of Monimia's
health; her tears, her distress, her despair at his
imagined cruelty; he saw thro' that perspective,
every blossom of her beauty wither, every spar∣kle
vanish from her eyes: he beheld her faded
lips, her pale cheek, and her inanimated features,
the symmetry of which, not death itself was able
to destroy. His fancy conveyed her breathless
corse to the cold grave, o'er which, perhaps, no
tear humane was shed, where her delicate limbs
were consigned to dust, where she was dished out
a delicious banquet to the unsparing worm.</P>
<P>O'er these pictures he dwelt with a sort of
pleasing anguish, until he became so enamoured
of her tomb, that he could no longer resist the
<PB N="219" REF="220"/>
desire which compelled him to make a pilgrimage
to the dear hallowed spot, where all his once gay
hopes lay buried; that he might nightly visit the
silent habitation of his ruined love, embrace the
sacred earth with which she was now compound∣ed,
moisten it with his tears, and bid the turf lie
easy on her breast. Besides the prospect of this
gloomy enjoyment, he was urged to return to
England, by an eager desire of taking vengeance
on the perfidious Fathom, as well as of acquitting
himself of the obligations he owed in that king∣dom,
to those who had assisted him in his distress.
He therefore communicated his intention to Far∣rel,
who would have insisted upon attending him
in the journey, had not he been conjured to stay
and manage Renaldo's affairs in his absence. E∣very
previous step being taken, he took leave of
the countess and his sister, who had, with all
their interest and elocution, opposed his design,
the execution of which, they justly feared, would,
instead of dissipating, augment his chagrin; and
now, seeing him determined, they shed a flood of
tears at his departure, and he set out from Vienna
in a post-chaise, accompanied by a trusty valet de
chambre on horseback.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="61" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Renaldo meets with a living monument of justice,
and encounters a personage of some note in these
memoirs.</HEAD>
<P>AS this domestic was very well qualified for
making all the proper dispositions, and ad∣justing
every necessary article on the road, Renal∣do
totally abstracted himself from earthly conside∣rations,
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
and mused without ceasing on that theme
which was the constant subject of his contempla∣tion.
He was blind to the objects that surrounded
him; he scarce ever felt the importunities of na∣ture;
and had not they been reinforced by the
pressing entreaties of his attendant, he would
have proceeded without refreshment or repose.
In this absence of mind did he traverse a great
part of Germany, in his way to the Austrian Ne∣therlands,
and arrived at the fortress of Luxem∣burg,
where he was obliged to tarry a whole day
on account of an accident which had happened to
his chaise. Here he went to view the fortifica∣tions;
and as he walked along the ramparts, his
ears were saluted with these words, “H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aven
bless the noble count de Melvile! will not he turn
the eyes of compassion upon an old fellow-soldier
reduced to misfortune and disgrace?”</P>
<P>Surprised at this address, which was attended
with the clanking of chains, Renaldo lifted up
his eyes, and perceived the person who spoke, to
be one of two malefactors shackled together, who
had been sentenced for some crime to work as
labourers on the fortifications: his face was so
covered with hair, and his whole appearance so
disguised by the squalid habit which he wore, that
the count could not recollect his features, until he
gave him to understand that his name was Ratch∣kali.
Melvile immediately recognized his fellow
student at Vienna and his brother volunteer upon
the Rhine, and expressed equal surprize and con∣cern
at seeing him in such a deplorable situa∣tion.</P>
<P>Nothing renders the soul, so callous and insensi∣ble
as the fearing brands of infamy and disgrace.
Without betraying the least symptoms of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or
confusion, “Count,” says he, “this is the
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
fate of war, at least of the war in which I have
been engaged, ever since I took leave of the im∣perial
army, and retreated with your old compa∣nion
Fathom. Long life to that original genius!
If he is not unhapplily eclipsed by some unfortu∣nate
interposition, before his terrence parts are
purified, I foresee that he will shine a star of the
first magnitude in the world of adventure.”</P>
<P>At mention of this detested name, Renaldo's
heart began to throb wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h indignation; yet he
suppressed the emotion, and desired to know the
meaning of that splendid encomium which he
had bestowed upon his confederate. “It would be
quite unnecessary,” replied Ratchkali, “for a
man in my present situation to equivocate or dis∣guise
the truth: the nature of my disgrace is per∣fectly
well known. I am condemned to hard la∣bour
for life; and unless some lucky accident
(which I cannot now foresee) shall intervene, all
I can expect is some alleviation of my hard lot
from the generosity of such gentlemen as you who
compassionate the sufferings of your fellow crea∣tures.
In order to engage this benevolence the
more in my behalf, I shall (if you will give me
the hearing) faithfully inform you of some parti∣culars,
which it may import you to know, con∣cerning
my old acquaintance Ferdinand Count
Fathom, whose real character hath perhaps hi∣therto
escaped your notice.”</P>
<P>Then he proceeded to give a regular detail of
all the strokes of finesse which he, in conjunction
with our adventurer, had practised upon Melvile
and others, during their residence at Vienna, and
the campaigns they had made upon the Rhine:
he explained the nature of the robbery which
was supposed to have been done by the count's
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
valet, together with the manner of their deser∣tion:
he described his separation from Fathom,
their meeting at London, the traffic they carried
on in copartnership; and the misfortune that re∣duced
Ferdinand to the condition in which he was
found by Melvile.</P>
<P>“After having gratified the honest lawyer,”
said he, “with a share of the unfortunate Fa∣thom's
spoils, and packed up all my own valuable
effects, my new auxiliary Maurice and I posted
to Harwich, embarked in the pacquet-boat, and
next day arrived at Helveotsluys; from thence
we repaired to the Hague, in order to mingle in
the gaities of the place, and exercise our talents
at play, which is there cultivated with universal
eagerness: but, chancing to meet with an old ac∣quaintance,
whom I did not at all desire to see,
I found it convenient to withdraw softly to Rot∣terdam;
from whence we set out for Antwerp;
and having made a tour of the Austrian Nether∣lands,
set up our rest at Brussels, and concerted
a plan for laying the Flemings under contribu∣tion.</P>
<P>From our appearance we procured admission
into the most polite assemblies, and succeeded to a
wonder in all our operations; until our career
was unfortunately checked by the indiscretion of
my ally, who, being detected in the very act of
conveying a card, was immediately introduced
to a magistrate; and this minister of justice was
so curious, inquisitive, and clear-sighted, that
count Maurice, finding it impossible to elude his
penetration, was sain to stipulate for his own
safety, by giving up his friend to the cognizance of
the law. I was accordingly apprehended, before
I knew the cause of my arrest; and being unhap∣pily
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
known by some soldiers of the prince's guard,
my character turned out so little to the approba∣tion
of the inquisitors, that all my effects were
confiscated for the benefit of the state, and I was
by a formal sentence condemned to labour on the
fortifications all the days of my life; while Mau∣rice
escaped at the expence of five hundred stripes,
which he received in public from the hands of the
common executioner.</P>
<P>Thus have I, without evasion or mental re∣servation,
given a faithful account of the steps by
which I have arrived at this barrier, which is like∣ly
to be the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of my peregrinations,
unless the generous count de Melvile will deign
to interpose his interest in behalf of an old fellow-soldier,
who may yet live to justify his media∣tion.”</P>
<P>Renaldo had no reason to doubt the truth of
this story, every circumstance of which tend∣ed
to corroborate the intelligence he had already
received touching the character of Fathom,
whom he now considered with a double portion
of abhorrence, as the most abandoned miscreant
that nature had ever produced. Tho' Ratchkali
did not possess a much higher place in his opini∣on,
he favoured him with marks of his bounty,
and exhorted him, if possible, to reform his heart;
but he would by no means promise to interpose his
credit in favour of a wretch self-convicted of such
enormous villany and fraud. He could not help
moralizing upon this rencounter, which inspired
him with great contempt for human nature: and
next day he proceeded on his journey with a
heavy heart, ruminating on the perfidy of man∣kind,
and, between whiles, transported with the
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
prospect of revenging all his calamities upon the
accursed author.</P>
<P>While he was wrapped up in these reveries,
his carriage rolled along, and had already entered
a wood between Mons and Tournay, when his
dream was suddenly interrupted by the explosion
of several pistols that were fired among the thic∣kets
at a little distance from the road. Roused
at this alarm, he snatched his sword that stood by
him, and springing from the chaise, ran directly
towards the spot, being close followed by his va∣let,
who had alighted and armed himself with a
pistol in each hand. About forty yards from the
high way they arrived in a little glade or open∣ing,
where they saw a single man standing at bay
against five banditti, after having killed one of
their companions, and lost his own horse that lay
dead upon the ground.</P>
<P>Melvile seeing this odds, and immediately
guessing their design, rushed among them without
hesitation, and in an instant ran his sword thro'
the heart of one whose hand was raised to smite
the gentleman behind, while he was engaged with
the rest in front. At the same time the valet
disabled another by a shot in the shoulder; so that
the number being now equal on both sides, a fu∣rious
combat ensued, every man being paired
with an antagonist, and each having recourse to
swords, as all their pieces had been discharged.
Renaldo's adversary finding himself pressed with
equal fury and skill, retreated gradually among
the trees, until he vanished altogether into the
thickest of the wood; and his two companions
followed his example with great ease, the valet
de chambre being hurt in the leg, and the stranger
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
so much exhausted by the wounds he had received
before Renaldo's interposition, that when the
young gentleman approached to congratulate him
on the defeat of the robbers, he, in advancing to
embrace his deliverer, dropt down motionless on
the grass.</P>
<P>The count, with that warmth of sympathy and
benevolence which was natural to his heart, lifted
up the wounded cavalier in his arms, and carried
him to the chaise, in which he was deposited,
while the valet de chambre reloaded his pistols,
and prepared for a second attack, as they did not
doubt that the banditti would return with a rein∣forcement.
However, before they re-appeared, Re∣naldo's
driver disengaged him from the wood, and
in less than a quarter of an hour they arrived at
a village, where they halted for assistance to the
stranger, who, tho' still alive, had not recovered
the use of his senses.</P>
<P>After he was undressed and laid in a warm bed,
a surgeon examined his body, and found a wound
in his neck by a sword, and another in his right
side occasioned by a pistol-shot; so that his prog∣nostic
was very dubious: mean while, he applied
proper dressings to both; and, in half an hour
after this administration, the gen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leman gave some
tokens of perception. He looked around him
with a wildness of fury in his aspect, as if he had
thought himself in the hands of the robbers by
whom he had been attacked: but, when he saw
the assiduity with which the by standers exerted
themselves in his behalf; one raising his head from
the pillow, while another exhorted him to swal∣low
a little wine which was warmed for the pur∣pose;
when he beheld the sympathising looks of
all present, and heard himself accosted in the
<PB N="226" REF="227"/>
most cordial terms by the person whom he recol∣lected
as his deliverer; all the severity vanished
from his countenance; he took Renaldo's hand
and pressed it to his lips; and while the tears
gushed from his eyes, “Praised be God,” said
he, “that virtue and generosity are still to be
found among the sons of men.”</P>
<P>Every body in the apartment was affected by
this exclamation; and Melvile, above all the rest,
felt such emotions as he could scarcely restrain.
He intreated the gentleman to believe himself
in the midst of such friends as would effectually
secure him from all violence and mortification;
he conjured him to compose the perturbation of
his spirits, and quiet the apprehensions of his
mind with that reflection; and protested, that he
himself would not quit the house while his at∣tendance
should be deemed necessary for the
stranger's cure, or his conversation conducive to
his amusement.</P>
<P>These assurances, considered with the heroic
part which the young Hungarian had already acted
in his behalf, inspired the cavalier with such a sub∣lime
idea of Melvile, that he gazed upon him with
silent astonishment, as an angel sent from heaven
for his succour; and in the transport of his gra∣titude,
could not help exclaiming, “Sure Pro∣vidence
hath still something in reserve for this
unfortunate wretch, in whose favour such a
miracle of courage and generosity hath inter∣posed!”</P>
<P>Being accommodated with proper care and at∣tendance,
his constitution in a little time over∣came
the fever; and at the third dressing, the
surgeon declared him out of all danger from his
wounds. Then was Renaldo indulged with op∣portunities
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
of conversing with the patient, and of
inquiring into the particulars of his fortune and
designs in life, with a view to manifest the incli∣nation
he felt to serve him in his future occa∣sions.</P>
<P>The more this stranger contemplated the cha∣racter
of the count, the more his amazement in∣creased,
on account of his extraordinary benevo∣lence
in favour of a person whose merit he could
not possibly know; he even expressed his surprize
on this subject to Renaldo, who at length told
him, that, altho' his best offices should always
be ready for the occasions of any gentleman in
distress, his particular attachment and regard to
him was improved by an additional considera∣tion:
“I am no stranger,” said he, “to the
virtues and honour of the gallant Don Diego de
Zelos.”</P>
<P>“Heaven and earth!” cried the stranger,
starting from his seat with extreme emotion, “do
I then live to hear myself addressed by that long
lost appellation! my heart glows at the expressi∣on!
my spirits are kindled with a flame that
thrills thro' every nerve! Say, young gentleman,
if you are really an inhabitant of earth, by what
means are you acquainted with the unhappy name
of Zelos?”</P>
<P>In answer to this eager interrogation, Renaldo
gave him to understand, that in the course of his
travels, he had resided a short time at Seville,
where he had frequently seen Don Diego, and
often heard his character mentioned with uncom∣mon
esteem and veneration. “Alas!” replied the
Castilian, “that justice is no longer done to the
wretched Zelos; his honours are blasted, and his
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
reputation canker-bitten by the venomous tooth
of flander.”</P>
<P>He then proceeded to unfold his misfortunes,
as they have already been explained in the first
volume of these memoirs; at the recapitulation of
which, the heart of Melvile being intendered
by his own calamities, was so deeply affected,
that he re-echoed the groans of don Diego,
and wept over his sufferings with the most filial
sympathy. When he repeated the story of that
cruel fraud, which was practised upon him by the
faithless Fadini, Melvile, whose mind and imagi∣nation
teemed with the villanies of Fathom, was
immediately struck with the conjecture of his be∣ing
the knave; because, indeed, he could not be∣lieve,
that any other person was so abandoned, by
principle and humanity, as to take such a bar∣barous
advantage of a gentleman in distress.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="62" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His return to England, and midnight pilgrimage to
Monimia's tomb.</HEAD>
<P>HE considered the date of that unparalelled
transaction, which agreed with his con∣jecture,
and from the inquiries he made concern∣ing
the person of the traitor, gathered reasons suf∣ficient
to confirm his supposition. Thus certified,
“That is the villain, cried the count, whose in∣fernal
arts have overwhelmed me with such mi∣sery
as heaven itself hath no remedy to dispel! To
revenge my wrongs on that perfidious miscreant,
is one of the chief reasons for which I deign
to drag about an hateful being. O don Diego!
what is life, when all its enjoyments are so easily
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
poisoned by the machinations of such a worm!”
So saying, he smote his breast in all the agony of
woe, and besought the Spaniard to relate the steps
he took in consequence of this disaster.</P>
<P>The Castilian's cheeks reddened at this in∣formation,
which reinforced his own resentment,
and casting up his eyes to heaven, “Sacred pow∣ers!
(cried he) let him not perish, before you
bring him within my reach. You ask me, noble
cavalier, what measures I took in this abyss of mi∣sery.
For the first day, I was tortured with ap∣prehensions
for the friendly Fadini, fearing that
he had been robbed and murthered for the jewels
which he had, perhaps, too unwarily exposed to
sale: but this terror soon vanished before the true
presages of my fate; when, on the morrow, I
found the whole family in tears and confusion,
and heard my landlord pour forth the most bitter
imprecations against the fugitive who had deflow∣ered
his daughter, and even robbed the house.
You will ask, which of the passions of my heart
were interested on this occasion; they were shame
and indignation: all my grief flowed in another
channel: I blushed to find my judgment de∣ceived:
I scorned to complain; but in my heart
denounced vengeance against my base betrayer.
I silently retired to my apartment, in order to
commune with my own thoughts.</P>
<P>I had bore greater calamities, without being
driven to despair: I summoned all my fortitude to
my assistance, and resolved to live in spite of af∣fliction.
Thus determined, I betook myself to the
house of a general officer, whose character was
fair in the world; and having obtained admission
in consequence of my oriental appearance; “To
a man of honour, said I, the unfortunate need
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
no introduction: my habit proclaims me a Per∣sian;
this passport from the States of Holland will
confirm that supposition. I have been robbed of
jewels, to a considerable value, by a wretch whom
I favoured with my confidence; and now, re∣duced
to extreme indigence, I come to offer my∣self
as a soldier in the armies of France. I have
health and strength sufficient to discharge that du∣ty:
nor am I unacquainted with a military life,
which was once my glory and occupation. I
therefore sue for your protection, that I may be
received, though in the lowest order of them that
serve the king; and that your future favour may
depend upon my behaviour in that capacity.”</P>
<P>The general, surprized at my declaration, sur∣veyed
me with uncommon attention; he perused
my certificate, asked divers questions concerning
the art of war, to which I returned such answers
as convinced him that I was not wholly ignorant
in that particular. In short, I was inlisted as a
volunteer in his own regiment, and soon after
promoted to the rank of a subaltern, and the office
of equerry to his own son, who, at that time, had
attained to the degree of colonel, though his age
did not exceed eighteen years.</P>
<P>This young man was naturally of a ferocious
disposition, which had been rendered quite un∣tractable
by the pride of birth and fortune, toge∣ther
with the licence of his education. As he did
not know the respect due to a gentleman, so
he could not possibly pay it to those who were
unfortunately under his command. Divers mor∣tifications
I sustained with that fortitude which
became a Castilian who lay under obligations to
the father; till at length, laying aside all deco∣rum,
he smote me. Sacred heaven! he smote
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
don Diego de Zelos, in presence of his whole
houshold.</P>
<P>Had my sword been endowed with sensation,
it would of itself have started from the scabbard,
at this indignity offered to its master. I un∣sheathed
it without deliberation, saying, “Know,
insolent boy, he is a gentleman whom thou hast
thus outraged; and thou hast cancelled the ties
which have hitherto restrained my indignation.”
His servants would have interposed, but he com∣manded
them to retire; and flushed with that
confidence which the impetuosity of his temper
inspired, he drew, in his turn, and attacked me
with redoubled rage; but his dexterity being very
unequal to his courage, he was soon disarmed
and overthrown; when pointing my sword to his
breast, “In consideration of thy youth and ig∣norance,
said I, I spare that life which thou hast
forfeited by thy ungenerous presumption.”</P>
<P>With these words I put up my weapon, retired
through the midst of his domestics, who seeing
their master safe, did not think proper to oppose
my passage, and mounting my horse, in less than
two hours entered the Austrian dominions, re∣solving
to proceed as far as Holland, that I might
embark in the first ship for Spain, in order to
wash away, with my own blood, or that of my
enemies, the cruel stain which hath so long defiled
my reputation.</P>
<P>This was the grievance that still corroded my
heart, and rendered ineffectual the inhuman sa∣crifice
I had made to my injured honour. This
was the consideration that incessantly prompted,
and still importunes me to run every risque of life
and fortune, rather than leave my fame under
such an ignominious aspersion. I purpose to obey
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
this internal call. I am apt to believe it is the
voice of heaven; of that providence which ma∣nifested
its care by sending such a generous auxi∣liary
to my aid, when I was overpowered by ban∣ditti,
on the very first day of my expedition.”</P>
<P>Having in this manner gratified the curiosity
of his deliverer, he expressed a desire of knowing
the quality of him to whom he was so signally
obliged; and Renaldo did not scruple to make the
Castilian acquainted with his name and family:
he likewise communicated the story of his unfor∣tunate
love, with all the symptoms of unutterable
woe, which drew tears from the noble-hearted
Spaniard, while with a groan that announced the
load which overwhelmed his soul, “I had a
daughter, said he, such as you describe the peer∣less
Monimia, had heaven decreed her for the
arms of such a lover, I, who am now the most
wretched, should have been the most happy pa∣rent
upon earth.”</P>
<P>Thus did these new friends alternately indulge
their mutual sorrow, and concert measures for
their future operations. Melvile earnestly solli∣cited
the Castilian to favour him with his compa∣ny
to England, where, in all probability, both
would enjoy the gloomy satisfaction of being re∣venged
upon their common betrayer Fathom;
and as a farther inducement, he assured him, that
as soon as he should have accomplished the me∣lancholy
purposes of his voyage, he would ac∣company
don Diego to Spain, and employ his
whole interest and fortune in his service. The
Spaniard, thunderstruck at the extravagant gene∣rosity
of this proposal, could scarce believe the
evidence of his own senses, and after some pause,
replied, “My duty would teach me to obey any
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
command you should think proper to impose;
but here my inclination and interest are so agree∣ably
flattered, that I should be equally ungrateful
and unwise, in pretending to comply with re∣luctance.”</P>
<P>This point being settled, they moved forwards
to Mons, as soon as don Diego was in a condition
to bear the shock of such a removal; and there
remaining until his wounds were perfectly cured,
they hired a post-chaise for Ostend, embarked in
a vessel at that port, reached the opposite shore
of England, after a short and easy passage, and
arrived in London without having met with any
sinister accident on the road.</P>
<P>As they approached this capital, Renaldo's
grief seemed to regurgitate with redoubled vio∣lence.
His memory was waked to the most minute
and painful exertion of its faculties; his imagina∣tion
teemed with the most afflicting images, and
his impatience became so ardent, that never lo∣ver
panted more eagerly for the consummation of
his wishes, than Melvile for an opportunity of
stretching himself upon the grave of the lost Mo∣nimia.
The Castilian was astonished, as well as
affected at the poignancy of his grief, which, as
a proof of his susceptibility and virtue, endeared
him still more to his affection; and though his
own misfortunes had rendered him very unfit for
the office of a comforter, he endeavoured, by
soothing discourse, to moderate the excess of his
friend's affliction.</P>
<P>Though it was dark when they alighted at the
inn, Melvile ordered a coach to be called, and
being attended by the Spaniard, who would not
be persuaded to quit him upon such an occasion,
he repaired to the house of the generous Jew,
<PB N="234" REF="235"/>
whose rheum distilled very plentifully at his ap∣proach.
The count had already acquitted him∣self
in point of pecuniary obligations to this bene∣volent
Hebrew; and now, after having made
such acknowledgments as might be expected from
a youth of his disposition, he begged to know by
what channel he had received that letter, which
he had been so kind as to forward to Vienna.</P>
<P>Joshua, who was ignorant of the contents of
that epistle, and saw the young gentleman ex∣tremely
moved, would have eluded his enquiry,
by pretending he had forgot the circumstance;
but when he understood the nature of the case,
which was not explained without the manifesta∣tion
of the utmost inquietude, he heartily con∣doled
the desponding lover, telling him he had in
vain employed all his intelligence about that un∣fortunate
beauty, in consequence of Melvile's
letter to him on that subject; and then directed
him to the house of that physician, who had
brought the fatal billet which had made him mi∣serable.</P>
<P>No sooner did he receive this information than
he took his leave abruptly, with promise of re∣turning
next day, and hied him to the lodgings of
that gentleman, whom he was lucky enough to
find at home. Being savoured with a private au∣dience,
“When I tell you, said he, that my
name is Renaldo count de Melvile, you will
know me to be the most unfortunate of men. By
that letter, which you committed to the charge of
my worthy friend Joshua, the fatal veil was re∣moved
from my eyes, which had been so long
darkened by the artifices of incredible deceit, and
my own incurable misery fully presented to my
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
view. If you were acquainted with the unhappy fair,
who hath fallen a victim to my mistake, you will
have some idea of the insufferable pangs which I
now feel in recollecting her fate. If you have
compassion for these pangs, you will not refuse to
conduct me to the spot where the dear remains of
Monimia are deposited; there let me enjoy a full
banquet of woe; there let me feast that worm of
sorrow that pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s upon my heart: for such enter∣tainment
have I revisited this (to me) ill-omened
isle: for this satisfaction I intrude upon your con∣descension
at these unseasonable hours; for to such
a degree of impatience is my affliction whetted,
that no slumber shall assail mine eyelids, no peace
reside within my bosom, until I shall have adored
that earthy shrine where my Monimia lies! Yet
would I know the circumstances of her fate. Did
heaven ordain no angel to minister to her distress?
were her last moments comfortless? ha! was not
she abandoned to indigence, to insults; left in
the power of that inhuman villain who betrayed
us both! Sacred heaven! why did providence
wink at the triumph of such consummate per∣sidy?”</P>
<P>The physician having listened with complacen∣cy
to this effusion, replied, “It is my profession,
it is my nature to sympathize with the afflicted. I
am a judge of your feelings, because I know the
value of your loss. I attended the incomparable
Monimia in her last illness, and am well errough
acquainted with her story, to conclude, that she
fell a sacrifice to an unhappy misunderstanding,
effected and somented by that traitor who abused
your mutual confidence.”</P>
<P>He then proceeded to inform him of all the
particulars which we have already recorded, touch∣ing
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
the destiny of the beauteous orphan, and con∣cluded
with telling him he was ready to yield him
any other satisfaction which it was in his power to
grant. The circumstances of the tale had put
Renaldo's spirits into such commotion, that he
could utter nothing but interjections and uncon∣nected
words. When Fathom's behaviour was
described, he trembled with fierce agitation, start∣ed
from his chair, pronouncing, “Monster!
fiend! but we shall one day meet.”</P>
<P>When he was made acquainted with the bene∣volence
of the French lady, he exclaimed, “O
heaven-born charity and compassion! sure that
must be some spirit of grace sent hither to miti∣gate
the tortures of life! where shall I find her,
to offer up my thanks and adoration?” Having
heard the conclusion of the detail, he embraced
the relater, as the kind benefactor of Monimia,
shed a flood of tears in his bosom, and pressed
him to crown the obligation, by conducting him
to the solitary place where now she rested from
all her cares.</P>
<P>The gentleman perceiving the transports of his
grief were such as could not be opposed, com∣plied
with his request, attended him in the vehi∣cle,
and directed the coachman to drive to a se∣questered
field, at some distance from the city,
where stood the church, within whose awful isle
this scene was to be acted. The sexton being
summoned from his bed, produced the keys, in
consequence of a gratification, after the physician
had communed with him apart, and explained
the intention of Renaldo's visit.</P>
<P>During this pause, the soul of Melvile was
wound up to the highest pitch of enthusiastic sor∣row.
The uncommon darkness of the night, the
<PB N="237" REF="238"/>
solemn silence, and lonely situation of the place,
conspired with the occasion of his coming, and
the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real
rapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole
world would not have persuaded him to disap∣point.
The clock struck twelve, the owl screech∣ed
from the ruined battlement, the door was o∣pened
by the sexton, who, by the light of a glim∣mering
taper, conducted the despairing lover to a
dreary isle, and stamped upon the ground with
his foot, saying, “Here the young lady lies in∣terred.”</P>
<P>Melvile no sooner received this intimation,
than falling on his knees, and pressing his lips to
the hallowed earth: “Peace, cried he, to the
gentle tenant of this silent habitation.” Then
turning to the bystanders, with a bloodshot eye,
said, “Leave me to the full enjoyment of this
occasion: my grief is too delicate to admit the
company even of my friends: the rites to be per∣formed
require privacy: adieu then, here must I
pass the night alone.”</P>
<P>The doctor, alarmed at this declaration, which
he was afraid imported some resolution fatal to his
own life, began to repent of having been access∣ary
to the visit, attempted to dissuade him from
his purpose, and finding him obstinately deter∣mined,
called in the assistance of the sexton and
coachman, and sollicited the aid of don Diego,
to force Renaldo from the execution of his de∣sign.</P>
<P>The Castilian, knowing his friend was then ve∣ry
unfit for common altercation, interposed in the
dispute, saying, “You need not be afraid that
he will obey the dictates of despair: his religion,
his honour will baffle such temptations: he hath
<PB N="238" REF="239"/>
promised to reserve his life for the occasions of his
friend; and he shall not be disappointed in his pre∣sent
aim.” In order to corroborate this peremp∣tory
address, which was delivered in the French
language, he unsheathed his sword, and the others
retreating at sight of his weapon, “Count, said
he, enjoy your grief in full transports I will
screen you from interruption, though at the ha∣zard
of my life; and while you give a loose to
sorrow, within that ghastly vault, I will watch till
morning in the porch, and meditate upon the ruin
of my own family and peace.”</P>
<P>He accordingly prevailed upon the physician to
retire, after he had satisfied the sexton, and or∣dered
the coachman to return by break of day.</P>
<P>Renaldo thus left alone, prostrated himself up∣on
the grave, and poured forth such lamentations
as would have drawn tears from the most savage
hearer. He called aloud upon Monimia's name,
“Are these the nuptial joys to which our fate
hath doomed us? Is this the fruit of those endear∣ing
hopes, that intercourse divine, that raptured
admiration, in which so many hours insensibly e∣lapsed!
where now are those attractions, to which
I yielded up my captive heart? quenched are
those genial eyes that gladdened each beholder,
and shone the planets of my happiness and peace!
cold! cold and withered are those lips that swell∣ed
with love, and far out-blushed the damask
rose! and ah! for ever silenced is that tongue,
whose eloquence had power to lull the pangs of
misery and care! no more shall my attention be
ravished with the music of that voice, which used
to thrill in soft vibrations to my soul! O sainted
spirit! O unspotted shade of her whom I adored;
of her whose memory I shall still revere with
<PB N="239" REF="240"/>
ever-bleeding sorrow and regret; of her whose
image will be the last idea that forsakes this hap∣less
bosom! now art thou conscious of my inte∣grity
and love; now dost thou behold the anguish
that I feel. If the pure essence of thy nature will
permit, wilt thou, ah! wilt thou indulge this
wretched youth with some kind signal of thy no∣tice,
with some token of thy approbation? wilt
thou assume a medium of embodied air, in sem∣blance
of that lovely form, which now lies
mouldering in this dreary tomb, and speak the
words of peace to my distempered soul! Return,
Monimia! appear, though but for one short mo∣ment,
to my longing eyes! vouchsafe one smile;
Renaldo will be satisfied; Renaldo's heart will be
at rest; his grief no more will overflow its banks,
but glide with equal current to his latest hour!
Alas! these are the raving of my delirious sorrow!
Monimia hears not my complaints; her soul,
sublimed far, far above all sublunary cares, en∣joys
that felicity, of which she was debarred on
earth. In vain I stretch these eyes, environed
with darkness undistinguishing and void: no ob∣ject
meets my view; no sound salutes mine ear,
except the noisy wind that whistles through these
vaulted caves of death.”</P>
<P>In this kind of exclamation did Renaldo pass
the night, not without a certain species of woful
enjoyment, which the soul is often able to conjure
up from the depths of distress; insomuch, that
when the morning intruded on his privacy, he
could scarce believe it was the light of day, so fast
had fleeted the minutes of his devotion.</P>
<P>His heart being thus disburthened, and his impa∣tience
gratified, he became so calm and composed,
that don Diego was equally pleased and astonished
<PB N="240" REF="241"/>
at the air of serenity with which he came forth,
and embraced him with warm acknowledgments
of his goodness and attachment: he frankly own∣ed,
that his mind was now more at ease than he
had ever found it, since he first received the fatal
intimation of his loss; that a few such feasts
would entirely moderate the keen appetite of his
sorrow, which he would afterwards feed with less
precipitation.</P>
<P>He also imparted to the Castilian, the plan
of a monument, which he had designed for the
incomparable Monimia; and don Diego was so
much struck with the description, that he soli∣cited
his advice in projecting another, of a diffe∣rent
nature, to be erected to the memory of his
own ill-fated wife and daughter, should he ever
be able to re-establish himself in Spain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="63" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He renews the rites of sorrow, and is entranced.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE they amused themselves with
this sort of conversation, the physician
returned with the coach, and accompanied them
back to their inn, where he left them to their re∣pose,
after having promised to call again at noon,
and conduct Renaldo to the house of madame
Clement, the benefactress of Monimia, to whom
he eagerly desired to be introduced.</P>
<P>The appointment was observed with all ima∣ginable
punctuality on both sides. Melvile had
arrayed himself in a suit of deep mourning, and
he found the good lady in the like habit, assumed
upon the same occasion: the goodness of her heart
was manifest in her countenance; the sensibility
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
of the youth discovered itself in a flood of tears,
which he shed at her appearance. His sensations
were too full for utterance; nor was she for some
time, able to give him welcome: while she led
him by the hand to a seat, the drops of sympathy
rushed into either eye; and at length she broke
silence, saying, “Count, we must acquiesce in
the dispensations of providence; and quiet the
transports of our grief, with a full assurance that
Monimia is happy.”</P>
<P>This name was the key that unlocked the fa∣culty
of his speech. “I must strive, said he, to
ease the anguish of my heart with that consola∣tion.
But say, humane, benevolent lady, to whose
compassion and generosity that hapless orphan was
indebted for the last peaceful moment she enjoyed
upon earth; say, in all your acquaintance with
human nature, in all your intercourse with the
daughters of men, in all the exercise of your cha∣rity
and beneficence, did you ever observe such
sweetness, purity, and truth; such beauty, sense,
and perfection, as that which was the inheritance
of her whose fate I shall for ever deplore? “She
was indeed, replied the lady, the best and fairest
of our sex.”</P>
<P>This was the beginning of a conversation touch∣ing
that lovely victim, in the course of which, he
explained those wicked arts which Fathom prac∣tised
to alienate his affections from the adorable
Monimia; and she described the cunning hints
and false insinuations by which that traitor had
aspersed the unsuspecting lover, and soiled his
character in the opinion of the virtuous or∣phan.
The intelligence he obtained, on this
occasion, added indignation to his grief: the
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
whole mystery of Monimia's behaviour, which
he could not before explain, now stood dis∣closed
before him: he saw the gradual progress of
that infernal plan, which had been laid for their
mutual ruin; and his soul was inflamed with such
desire of vengeance, that he would have taken his
leave abruptly, in order to set on foot an imme∣diate
enquiry about the perfidious author of his
wrongs, that he might exterminate such a monster
of iniquity from the face of the earth; but he
was restrained by madame Clement, who gave
him to understand, that Fathom was already over∣taken
by the vengeance of heaven: for she had
traced him in all the course of his fortune, from
his first appearance in the medical sphere to his to∣tal
eclipse. She represented the villain as a wretch
altogether unworthy of his attention; she said, he
was so covered with infamy, that no person could
enter the lists against him, without bearing away
some stain of dishonour; that he was, at present,
peculiarly protected by the law, and sheltered
from the resentment of Renaldo, in the cavern of
his disgrace.</P>
<P>Melvile, glowing with rage, replied, that he
was a venomous serpent, which it was incumbent
on every foot to crush; that it was the duty of
every man to contribute his whole power in free∣ing
society from such a pernicious hypocrite; and
that if such instances of perfidy and ingratitude
were suffered to pass with impunity, virtue and
plain-dealing would soon be expelled from the ha∣bitations
of men. “Over and above these mo∣tives,
said he, I own myself so vitiated with the
allay of human passion and infirmity, that I de∣sire,
I eagerly pant for an occasion of meeting
him hand to hand, where I may upbraid him
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
with his treachery, and shower down vengeance
and destruction on his perfidious head.”</P>
<P>Then he recounted the anecdotes of our ad∣venturer,
which he had learned in Germany and
Flanders, and concluded with declaring his unal∣terable
resolution of releasing him from jail, that
he might have an opportunity of sacrificing him,
with his own hand, to the manes of Monimia.
The discreet lady, perceiving the perturbation of
his mind, would not further combat the impetuo∣sity
of his passion; contenting herself with exact∣ing
a promise, that he would not execute his pur∣pose,
until he should have deliberated three days
upon the consequences by which a step of that
kind might be attended: before the expiration
of that term, she thought measures might be ta∣ken
to prevent the young gentleman from ex∣posing
his life or reputation to unnecessary ha∣zard.</P>
<P>Having complied with her request in this par∣ticular,
he took his leave, after he had, by re∣peated
entreaties, prevailed upon her to accept a
jewel, in token of his veneration for the kind be∣nefactress
of his deceased Monimia: nor could his
generous heart be satisfied, until he had forced a
considerable present on the humane physician, who
had attended her in her last moments, and now
discovered a particular sympathy and concern for
her desponding lover. This gentleman attended
him to the house of the benevolent Joshua, where
they dined, and where don Diego was recom∣mended,
in the most fervid terms of friendship,
to the good offices of their host. Not that this
duty was performed in presence of the stranger,
Renaldo's delicacy would not expose his friend to
such a situation: while the physician, before din∣ner,
<PB N="244" REF="245"/>
entertained that stranger in one apartment,
Melvile withdrew into another, with the Jew, to
whom he disclosed the affair of the Castilian, with
certain circumstances, which shall, in due time,
be revealed.</P>
<P>Joshua's curiosity being whetted by this informa∣tion,
he could not help eying the Spaniard at table,
with such a particular stare, that don Diego per∣ceived
his attention, and took umbrage at the free∣dom
of his regard. Being unable to conceal his
displeasure, he addressed himself to the Hebrew,
with great solemnity, in the Spanish tongue, say∣ing,
“Signior, is there any singularity in my
appearance? or, do you recollect the features of
don Diego de Zelos?”</P>
<P>“Signior don Diego, replied the other in pure
Castilian, I crave your pardon for the rudeness of
my curiosity, which prompted me to survey a no∣bleman,
whose character I revere, and to whose
misfortunes I am no stranger; indeed, were cu∣riosity
alone concerned, I should be without ex∣cuse,
but as I am heartily inclined to serve you,
as far as my weak abilities extend, I hope your
generosity will not impute any little involuntary
trespass of punctilio to my want of cordiality or
esteem.”</P>
<P>The Spaniard was not only appeased by this
apology, but also affected with the compliment,
and the language in which it was conveyed. He
thanked the Jew for his kind declaration, intreat∣ed
him to bear with the peevishness of a disposi∣tion,
sore with the galling hand of affliction; and
turning up his eyes to heaven, “Were it possi∣ble,
cried he, for fate to reconcile contradictions,
and recal the irremeable current of events, I
would now believe, that there was happiness still
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
reserve for the forlorn Zelos: now that I tread
the land of freedom and humanity; now that I
find myself befriended by the most generous of
men. Alas! I ask not happiness! if by the kind
endeavours of the gallant count de Melvile, to
whom I am already indebted for my life; and by
the efforts of his friends, the honour of my name
shall be purified and cleared from the poisonous
stains of malice, by which it is at present spotted;
I shall then enjoy all that satisfaction, which de∣stiny
can bestow upon a wretch whose woes are
incurable.”</P>
<P>Renaldo comforted him with the assurance of
his being on the eve of triumphing over his adver∣saries;
and Joshua confirmed the consolation, by
giving him to understand, that he had correspon∣dents
in Spain, of some influence in the state;
that he had already written to them on the sub∣ject
of don Diego, in consequence of a letter
which he had received from Melvile, while he
tarried at Mons, and that he, every post, expect∣ed
a favourable answer on that subject.</P>
<P>After dinner, the physician took his leave,
though not before he had promised to meet Re∣naldo
at night, and accompany him in the repe∣tition
of his midnight visit to Monimia's tomb:
for this pilgrimage the unfortunate youth re∣solved
nightly to perform, during the whole time
of his residence in England: it was, indeed, a
sort of pleasure, the prospect of which enabled
him to bear the toil of living through the day;
though his patience was almost quite exhausted
before the hour of assignation arrived.</P>
<P>When the doctor appeared with the coach, he
leaped into it with great eagerness, after he had,
with much difficulty, prevailed with don Diego to
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
stay at home, on account of his health, which
was not yet perfectly established. The Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilian,
however, would not comply with his request, un∣til
he had obtained the count's promise, that he
should be permitted to accompany him next night,
and take that duty alternately with the physician.</P>
<P>About midnight they reached the place, where
they found the sexton in waiting, according to the
orders he had received: the door was opened, the
mourner conducted to the tomb, and left, as be∣fore,
to the gloom of his own meditations. A∣gain
he laid himself on the cold ground; again he
renewed his lamentable strain; his imagination
began to be heated into an extasy of enthusiasm,
during which, he again fervently invoked the spi∣rit
of his deceased Monimia.</P>
<P>In the midst of these invocations, his ear was
suddenly invaded with the sound of some few so∣lemn
notes, issuing from the organ, which seem∣ed
to feel the impulse of an invisible hand.</P>
<P>At this awful salutation, Melvile was roused to
the keenest sense of surprize and attention: reason
shrunk before the thronging ideas of his fancy,
which represented this musick as the prelude to
something strange and supernatural; and while he
waited for the sequel, the place was suddenly illu∣minated,
and each surrounding object brought un∣der
the cognizance of his eye.</P>
<P>What passed within his mind on this occasion,
is not easy to be described: all his faculties were
swallowed up by those of seeing and of hearing:
he had mechanically raised himself upon one
knee, with his body advancing forwards; and in
this attitude he gazed with a look, through which
his soul seemed eager to escape. To his view,
thus strained upon vacant space, in a few minutes
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
appeared the figure of a woman arrayed in white,
with a veil that covered her face, and flowed down
upon her back and shoulders: The phantome ap∣proached
him with an easy step, and, lifting up
her veil, discovered (believe it, O reader!) the
individual countenance of Monimia.</P>
<P>At sight of these well-known features, seeming∣ly
improved with new celestial graces, the youth
became a statue, expressing amazement, love,
and awful adoration. He saw the apparition smile
with meek benevolence, divine compassion, warm∣ed
and intendered by that fond, pure flame, which
death could not extinguish: he heard the voice
of his Monimia call Renaldo! Thrice he essayed
to answer; as oft his tongue denied its office:
his hair stood upright, and a cold vapour seemed
to thrill through every nerve. This was not fear,
but the infirmity of human nature, oppressed by
the presence of a superior being.</P>
<P>At length his agony was overcome; he recol∣lected
all his resolution, and in a strain of awe∣struck
rapture, thus addressed the heavenly visi∣tant.
“Hast thou then heard, pure spirit! the
wailings of my grief? hast thou descended from
the realms of bliss, in pity to my woe? and art
thou come to speak the words of peace to my de∣sponding
soul? To bid the wretched smile; to lift
the load of misery and care from the afflicted
breast; to fill thy lover's heart with joy and plea∣sing
hope, was still the darling task of my Moni∣mia,
e're yet refined to that perfection, which
mortality can never attain: no wonder then,
blest shade, that now, when reunited to thy na∣tive
heaven, thou art still kind, propitious, and
beneficent to us, who groan in this inhospitable
vale of sorrow thou hast left: tell me, ah! tell
<PB N="248" REF="249"/>
me, dost thou still remember those fond hours we
passed together? Doth that enlightened bosom
feel a pang of soft regret, when thou recallest
our fatal separation? Sure that meekened glance
bespeaks thy sympathy! Ah! how that tender look
o'erpowers me! Sacred heaven! the pearly drops
of pity trickle down thy ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks! Such are the
tears that angels shed o'er man's distress! Turn
not away: thou beckonest me to follow: yes, I
will follow thee, aetherial spirit, as far as these
weak limbs, encumbered with mortality, will
bear my weight; and, would to heaven! I could,
with ease, put off these vile, corporeal shackles,
and attend thy flight.”</P>
<P>So saying, he started from the ground, and in
a transport of eager expectation, at awful distance,
traced the footsteps of the apparition, which en∣tering
a detached apartment, sunk down upon a
chair, and with a sigh exclaimed, “Indeed, this
is too much!” What was the disorder of Renal∣do's
mind, when he perceived this phaenomenon!
Before reflection could perform its office, moved
by a sudden impulse, he sprung forwards, crying,
“If it be death to touch thee, let me die!” and
caught in his arms, not the shadow, but the
warm substance of the all-accomplished Monimia.
“Mysterious powers of providence! this is no
phantome! this is no shade! this is the life! the
panting bosom of her whom I have so long, so
bitterly deplored! I sold her in my arms! I press
her glowing breast to mine! I see her blush with
virtuous pleasure and ingenuous love! she smiles
upon me with inchanting tenderness! O let me
gaze on that transcendent beauty, which the more
I view it, ravishes the more! These charms are
too intense; I sicken while I gaze! Merciful
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
heaven! is not this a mere illusion of the brain?
Was she not fled for ever? Had not the cold
hand of death divorced her from my hope? This
must be some flattering vision of my distempered
fancy! perhaps some soothing dream: if such it
be, grant, O ye heavenly powers! that I may ne∣ver
wake.”</P>
<P>“O gentle youth! (replied the beauteous or∣phan,
still clasped in his embrace) what joy now
fills the bosom of Monimia, at this triumph of thy
virtue and thy love? When I see these transports
of thy affection, when I find thee restored to that
place in my esteem and admiration, which thou
hadst lost by the arts of calumny and malice! this
is a meeting which my most sanguine hopes durst
not presage!”</P>
<P>So entirely were the faculties of Renaldo en∣grossed
in the contemplation of his restored Mo∣nimia,
that he saw not the rest of the company,
who wept with transport over this affecting scene:
he was therefore amazed at the interposition of
madame Clement, who, while the shower of sym∣pathetic
pleasure bedewed her cheeks, congratu∣lated
the lovers upon this happy event, crying,
“These are the joys which virtue calls her own.”
They also received the compliments of a reve∣rend
clergyman, who told Monimia, she had reap∣ed,
at last, the fruits of that pious resignation to
the will of heaven, which she had so devoutly
practised during the term of her affliction: and,
lastly, they were accosted by the physician, who
was not quite so hackneyed in the ways of death,
or so callous to the finer sensations of the soul, but
that he blubbered plentifully, while he petitioned
heaven in behalf of such an accomplished and de∣serving
pair.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="251"/>
Monimia taking madame Clement by the
hand, “Whatever joy, said she, Renaldo de∣rives
from this occasion, is owing to the bounty,
the compassion, and maternal care of this incom∣parable
lady, together with the kind admonitions
and humanity of these two worthy gentlemen.”</P>
<P>Melvile, whose passions were still in agitation,
and whose mind could not yet digest the incidents
that occurred, embraced them all by turns, but,
like the faithful needle, which though shaken, for
an instant, from its poize, immediately regains its
true direction and points invariably to the pole, he
soon returned to his Monimia; again he held her
in his arms; again he drank inchantment from
her eyes, and thus poured forth the effusions of
his soul. “Can I then trust the evidence of
sense? And art thou really to my wish restored?
Never, O never did thy beauty shine with such
bewitching grace, as that which now confounds
and captivates my view! sure there is something
more than mortal in thy looks! where hast thou
lived? where borrowed this perfection? whence
art thou now descended? Oh! I am all amaze∣ment,
joy and fear! thou wilt not leave me! no!
we must not part again: by this warm kiss! a
thousand times more sweet than all the fragrance
of the east! we never more will part. O this is
rapture, extasy, and what no language can ex∣plain!”</P>
<P>In the midst of these ejaculations, he ravished
a banquet from her glowing lips, that kindled in
his heart a flame, which rushed thro' every vein,
and glided to his marrow: this was a privilege he
had never claimed before, and now permitted as a
recompence for all the penance he had suffered;
nevertheless, the cheeks of Monimia, who was
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
altogether unaccustomed to such familiarities, un∣derwent
a total suffusion; and madame Clement
discreetly relieved her from the anxiety of her si∣tuation,
by interfering in the discourse, and rally∣ing
the count, upon his endeavours to monopo∣lize
such a branch of happiness.</P>
<P>“O my dear lady! (replied Renaldo, who by
this time had, in some measure, recovered his re∣collection)
forgive the wild transports of a fond
lover, who hath so unexpectedly retrieved the
jewel of his soul! yet, far from wishing to hoard
up his treasure, he means to communicate and
diffuse his happiness to all his friends. O my
Monimia! how will the pleasure of this hour be
propagated! As yet thou knowest not all the bliss
that is reserved for thy enjoyment: mean while,
I long to learn, by what contrivance this happy
interview hath been effected: still am I ignorant,
how I was transported into this apartment, from
the lonely vault, in which I mourned over my
supposed misfortune!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="64" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The mystery unfolded. Another recognition, which,
it is to be hoped, the reader could not foresee.</HEAD>
<P>THE French lady then explained the whole
mystery of Monimia's death, as a strata∣gem
she had concerted with the clergyman and
doctor, in order to defeat the pernicious designs
of Fathom, who seemed determined to support
his false pretensions, by dint of perjury and fraud,
which they would have found it very difficult to
clude. She observed, that the physician had
actually despaired of Monimia's life, and it was
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
not till after she herself was made acquainted with
the prognostick, that she wrote the letter to Re∣naldo,
which she committed to the care of ma∣dame
Clement, with an earnest intreaty, that it
should not be sent till after her decease: but that
lady believing the count had been certainly abused
by his treacherous confident, dispatched the billet
without the knowledge of Monimia, whose health
was restored by the indefatigable care of the phy∣sician,
and the sage exhortations of the clergy∣man,
by which she was reconciled to life. In a
word, the villainy of Fathom had inspired her
with some faint hope that Renaldo might still be
innocent; and that notion contributed not a lit∣tle
to her cure.</P>
<P>The letter having so effectually answered their
warmest hopes, in bringing back Renaldo such a
pattern of constancy and love; the confederates,
in consequence of his enthusiastic sorrow, had
planned this meeting, as the most interesting way
of restoring two virtuous lovers to the arms of
each other; for which purpose the good clergy∣man
had pitched upon his own church, and in∣dulged
them with the use of the vestry, in which
they now were presented with a small but elegant
collation.</P>
<P>Melvile heard this succinct detail with equal
joy and admiration: he poured forth the dictates
of his gratitude to the preservers of his happiness:
“This church, said he, shall henceforth possess
a double share of my veneration; this holy man
will, I hope, finish the charitable work he has
begun, by tying those bands of our happiness,
which nought but death shall have power to un∣bind.”
Then turning to that object which was
the star of his regard, “Do I not over-rate, said
<PB N="253" REF="254"/>
he, my interest with the fair Monimia?” She
made no verbal reply; but answered by an em∣phatic
glance, more eloquent than all the power
of rhetorick and speech. This language, which is
universal in the world of love, he perfectly well
understood, and in token of that faculty, sealed
the assent which she had smiled, with a kiss im∣printed
on her polished forehead.</P>
<P>In order to dissipate those interesting ideas,
which, by being too long indulged, might have
endangered his reason, madame Clement intreat∣ed
him to entertain the company with a detail of
what had happened to him in his last journey to
the empire, and Monimia expressed a desire of
knowing, in particular, the issue of his contest
with count Trebasi, who, she knew, had usurped
the succession of his father.</P>
<P>Thus sollicited, he could not refuse to gratify
their curiosity and concern: he explained his ob∣ligations
to the benevolent Jew; related the steps
he had taken at Vienna for the recovery of his
inheritance; informed them of his happy ren∣counter
with his father-in-law; of his sister's de∣liverance
and marriage; of the danger into which
his life had been precipitated by the news of Mo∣nimia's
death; and, lastly, of his adventure with
the banditti, in favour of a gentleman, who (he
afterwards understood) had been robbed in the
most base and barbarous manner by Fathom. He
likewise, to the astonishment of all present, and
of his mistress in particular, communicated some
circumstances, which shall appear in due season.</P>
<P>Monimia's tender frame being quite fatigued
with the scene she had acted, and her mind over∣whelmed
with the prosperous tidings she had heard,
after having joined the congratulations of the
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
company, on the good fortune of her Renaldo,
begged leave to retire, that she might by repose
recruit her exhausted spirits; and the night being
pretty far spent, she was conducted by her lover
to madame Clement's coach, that stood in wait∣ing,
in which also the rest of the company made
shift to embark, and were carriëd to the house of
that good lady, where after they were invited to
dine, and Melvile intreated to bring don Diego
and the Jew along with them, they took leave
of one another, and retired to their respective
lodgings in a transport of joy and satisfaction.</P>
<P>As for Renaldo, his rapture was still mixed
with apprehension, that all he had seen and heard
was no more than an unsubstantial vision, raised
by some gay delirium of a disordered imagination.
While his breast underwent those violent, though
blissful emotions of joy and admiration, his friend
the Castilian spent the night in ruminating over
his own calamities, and in a serious and severe
review of his own conduct. He compared his
own behaviour with that of the young Hunga∣rian,
and found himself so light in the scale, that
he smote his breast with violence, exclaiming in
an agony of remorse;</P>
<P>“Count Melvile has reason to grieve; don
Diego to despair: his misfortunes flow from the
villainy of mankind; mine are the fruit of my
own madness: he laments the loss of a mistress,
who fell a sacrifice to the perfidious arts of a craf∣ty
traitor: she was beautiful, virtuous, accom∣plished,
and affectionate; he was fraught with
sensibility and love: doubtless, his heart must
have deeply suffered; his behaviour denotes the
keenness of his woe; his eyes are ever-flowing
fountains of tears; his bosom the habitation of
<PB N="255" REF="256"/>
sighs; five hundred leagues hath he measured in
a pilgrimage to her tomb; nightly he visits the
dreary vault where she now lies at rest; her solita∣ry
grave is his couch; he converses with darkness
and the dead, until each lonely isle re-echoes his
distress. What would be his penance, had he my
cause? were he conscious of having murthered a
beloved wife and darling daughter! ah wretch!
ah cruel homicide! what had those dear victims
done to merit such a fate? Were they not ever
gentle and obedient, ever aiming to give thee sa∣tisfaction
and delight! Say, that Serafina was en∣amoured
of a peasant; say, that she had degene∣rated
from the honour of her race: the inclina∣tions
are involuntary; perhaps that stranger was
her equal in pedigree and worth. Had they been
fairly questioned, they might have justified,
at least excused that conduct which appeared so
criminal; or had they owned the offence, and
supplicated pardon: oh barbarous monster that I
am! was all the husband; was all the father ex∣tinguished
in my heart? how shall my own errors
be forgiven, if I refused to pardon the frailties of
my own blood; of those who are most dear to
my affection! Yet nature pleaded strongly in their
behalf! my heart was bursting while I dismissed
them to the shades of death: I was maddened
with revenge! I was guided by that savage prin∣ciple
which falsely we call honour: accursed
phantome! that assumes the specious title, and
misleads our wretched nation! is it then honoura∣ble
to sculk like an assassin, and plunge the secret
dagger in the heart of some unhappy man, who
hath incurred my groundless jealousy or suspicion,
without indulging him with that opportunity
which the worst criminal enjoys? or is it ho∣nourable
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
to poison two defenceless women, a
tender wife, an amiable daughter, whom even a
frown would almost have destroyed! O! this is
cowardice, brutality, hell-born fury and revenge!
heaven hath not mercy to forgive such execrable
guilt. Who gave thee power, abandoned ruffian!
o'er the lives of those whom God hath stationed
as thy fellows of probation; o'er those whom he
had sent to comfort and assist thee; to sweeten all
thy cares, and smooth the rough uneven paths of
life? O! I am doomed to never-ceasing horror
and remorse! if misery can atone for such enor∣mous
guilt, I have felt it in the extreme: like an
undying vulture it preys upon my heart; to sor∣row
I am wedded; I hug that teeming consort
to my soul; never, ah never shall we part; for
soon as my fame shall shine unclouded by the
charge of treason that now hangs over it, I will
devote myself to penitence and woe: a cold,
damp pavement shall be my bed; my raiment
shall be sackcloth; the fields shall furnish herbage
for my food; the stream shall quench my thirst;
the minutes shall be numbered by my groans; the
night be privy to my strains of sorrow, till hea∣ven,
in pity to my sufferings, release me from the
penance I endure. Perhaps the saints whom I
have murdered, will intercede for my remis∣sion.”</P>
<P>Such was the exercise of grief, in which the
hapless Castilian consumed the night; he had not
yet consigned himself to rest, when Renaldo en∣tering
his chamber, displayed such a gleam of
wildness and rapture in his countenance, as over∣whelmed
him with amazement; for, till that mo∣ment,
he had never seen his visage unobscured
with woe. “Pardon this abrupt intrusion, my
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
friend, cried Melvile, I could no longer with∣hold
from your participation, the great, the un∣expected
turn, which hath this night dispelled all
my sorrows, and restored me to the fruition of
ineffable joy. Monimia lives! the fair, the ten∣der,
the virtuous Monimia lives, and smiles upon
my vows! This night I retrieved her from the
grave: I held her in these arms; I pressed her
warm, delicious lips to mine! O! I am giddy
with intolerable pleasure!”</P>
<P>Don Diego was confounded at this declara∣tion,
which he considered as the effect of a dis∣ordered
brain: he never doubted that Renaldo's
grief had at length overpowered his reason, and
that his words were the effect of mere frenzy.
While he mused on this melancholy subject, the
count composed his features, and, in a succinct
and well-connected detail, explained the whole
mystery of his happiness, to the inexpressible asto∣nishment
of the Spaniard, who shed tears of sa∣tisfaction,
and straining the Hungarian to his
breast, “O my son! said he, you see what re∣compence
heaven hath in store for those who pur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
the paths of real virtue; those paths from
which I myself have been fatally misled by a faith∣less
vapour, which hath seduced my steps, and left
me darkling in the abyss of wretchedness. Such
as you describe this happy fair, was once my Se∣rafina,
rich in every grace of mind and body,
which nature could bestow. Had it pleased heaven
to bless her with a lover like Renaldo! but no
more, the irrevocable shaft is fled: I will not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint your enjoyment with my unavailing sighs!”</P>
<P>Melvile assured this disconsolate father, that no
pleasure, no avocation should ever so entirely in∣gross
his mind, but that he should still find an
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
hour for sympathy and friendship: he communi∣cated
the invitation of madame Clement, and in∣sisted
upon his compliance, that he might have
an opportunity of seeing and approving the
object of his passion. “I can refuse nothing to
the request of count de Melvile, replied the Spa∣niard,
and it were ungrateful in me to decline
the honour you propose. I own myself inflamed
with a desire of beholding a young lady, whose
perfections I have seen reflected in your sorrow;
my curiosity is, moreover, interested on account
of that humane gentlewoman, whose uncommon
generosity sheltered such virtue in distress; but
my disposition is infectious, and will, I am afraid,
hang like a damp upon the general festivity of
your friends.”</P>
<P>Melvile would take no denial, and having ob∣tained
his consent, repaired to the house of
Joshua, whose countenance seemed to unbend
gradually, into a total expression of joy and sur∣prize,
as he learned the circumstances of this
amazing event: he faithfully promised to attend
the count at the appointed hour, and in the mean
time earnestly exhorted him to take some repose,
in order to quiet the agitation of his spirits, which
must have been violently hurried on this occasion.
The advice was salutary, and Renaldo resolved to
follow it.</P>
<P>He returned to his lodgings, and laid himself
down; but, notwithstanding the fatigue he had
undergone, sleep refused to visit his eyelids, all
his faculties being kept in motion by the ideas
that crouded so fast upon his imagination: never∣theless,
though his mind continued in agitation,
his body was refreshed, and he arose in the fore∣noon,
with more serenity and vigour than he had
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
enjoyed for many months: every moment his
heart throbbed with new rapture, when he found
himself on the brink of possessing all that his soul
held dear and amiable; he put on his gayest looks
and apparel; insisted upon the Castilian's doing
the same honour to the occasion; and the altera∣tion
of dress produced such an advantageous
change in the appearance of don Diego, that when
Joshua arrived at the appointed hour, he could
scarce recognize his features, and complimented
him very politely on the improvement of his looks.</P>
<P>True it is, the Spaniard was a personage of a
very prepossessing mein, and noble deportment;
and had not grief, by increasing his native gravi∣ty,
in some measure discomposed the symmetry of
his countenance, he would have passed for a man
of a very amiable and engaging physiognomy.
They set out in the Jew's coach for the house of
madame Clement, and were ushered into an apart∣ment,
where they found the clergyman and phy∣sician
with that lady, to whom don Diego and the
Hebrew were by Melvile introduced.</P>
<P>Before they had seated themseves, Renaldo en∣quired
about the health of Monimia, and was di∣rected
to the next room by madame Clement,
who permited him to go thither, and conduct her
to the company. He was not slow in availing
himself of this permission: he disappeared in an
instant, and, during his short absence, don Diego
was strangely disturbed: the blood flushed, and
forsook his cheeks by turns; a cold vapour seem∣ed
to shiver through his nerves; and at his breast
he felt uncommon palpitation. Madame Cle∣ment
observed his discomposure, and kindly en∣quired
into the cause; when he replied, “I have
such an interest in what concerns the count de
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
Melvile, and my imagination is so much preposses∣sed
with the perfections of Monimia, that I am, as
it were, agonized with expectation; yet never
did my curiosity before raise such tumults as those
that now agitate my bosom!”</P>
<P>He had scarce pronounced these words, when
the door re-opening, Renaldo led in this mirror of
elegance and beauty, at sight of whom the Is∣raelite's
countenance was distorted into a stare of
admiration. But if such was the astonishment of
Joshua, what were the emotions of the Castilian,
when, in the beauteous orphan, he beheld the in∣dividual
features of his long lost Serafina!</P>
<P>His feelings are not to be described: the sond
parent, whose affection shoots even to a sense of
pain, feels not half such transport, when he un∣expectedly
retrieves a darling child from the en∣gulphing
billows or devouring flame. The hope
of Zelos had been totally extinguished: his heart
had been incessantly torn with anguish and re∣morse,
upbraiding him as the murtherer of Sera∣fina.
His therefore were the additional transports
of a father disburthened of the guilt of such enor∣mous
homicide. His nerves were too much over∣powered
by this sudden recognition, to manifest
the sensation of his soul by external signs. He
started not, nor did he list an hand in token of
surprize: he moved not from the spot on which
he stood, but, rivetting his eyes to those of the
lovely phantome, remained without motion, un∣til
she, approaching with her lover, fell at his
feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed, “May
yet call you father?”</P>
<P>This powerful shock arrouzed his faculties; a
cold sweat bedewed his forehead; his knees be∣gan
to tot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er; he dropped upon the floor, and
<PB N="261" REF="262"/>
throwing his arms around her, cried, “O
nature! O Serafina! merciful providence! thy
ways are past finding out” So saying, he fell
upon her neck, and wept aloud: the tears of
sympathetic joy trickled down her snowy bosom,
that heaved with rapture inexpressible. Renaldo's
eyes poured forth the briny stream: the cheeks of
madame Clement were not dry in this conjunc∣ture:
she kneeled by Serafina, kissed her with all
the eagerness of maternal affection, and with up∣lifted
hands adored the power that pre-ordained
this blessed event: the clergyman and doctor in∣timately
shared the general transport; and as for
Joshua, the drops of true benevolence flowed from
his eyes, like the oil on Aaron's beard, while he
skipped about the room in an aukward extacy,
and in a voice resembling the hoarse notes of the
long-eared tribe, cried, “O father Abraham!
such a moving scene hath not been acted since
Joseph disclosed himself unto his brethren in
Aegypt!”</P>
<P>Don Diego having found utterance to his pas∣sion,
procceded in this strain, “O! my dear
child! to find thee thus again, after our last un∣happy
parting, is wonderful! miraculous! Blessed
be the all-good, almighty power, that saved thee
for this hour of joy! Yet while my heart yearns
towards thee; while I pant with inconceivable
affection, and thus review these living features,
which were so long my study and delight, I dare
not ask by what mysterious means this meeting is
effected; lest, in the fond enquiry, I find my pre∣sent
bliss unreal, and awake to misery again!”</P>
<P>“O ever honoured father! she replied, if to
see your Serafina at your feet, melting with filial
love and veneration, can impart a gleam of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tisfaction
<PB N="262" REF="263"/>
tisfaction to your breast, enjoy that pleasure, and
behold her now restored to your protection and
paternal will, which she never more will disobey.
Alas! had heaven thought proper to reserve ano∣ther
parent for this interview, our joys had been
compleat; but she hath already paid her debt to
nature, and from the feats of bliss looks down
well pleased on this interesting scene.”</P>
<P>“Ah, my Antonia! cried the father, inter∣rupting
her, she is then at rest. Peace be to her
unspotted soul; to have found her here, had been
too much: how my Serafina hath survived my
blindfold rage, I know not; but sure the guilt of
fair Antonia's death, still hangs upon my soul.”</P>
<P>“Dismiss that fatal thought, said Serafina, my
mother quietly bade adieu to life in England; she
peaceably expired within these arms, and with
her latest breath prayed for her hapless husband.”
“Her mind was ever godlike, he resumed, she
was a saint in virtue, ill bestowed on such a
wretch as me; yet thy words have raised a dread∣ful
burthen from my conscience: I am not then
the dire assassin, who sacrificed his wife and daugh∣ter
to an infernal motive, falsely titled honour?
tho' I am more and more involved in a mystery,
which I long to hear explained.”</P>
<P>“That shall be my task, cried Renaldo, but
first permit me to implore your sanction to my
passion for the incomparable Serafina. You al∣ready
know our mutual sentiments; and though
I own the possession of such inestimable worth and
beauty, would be a recompence that infinitely
transcends the merit I can plead, yet as it hath
been my good fortune to inspire her with a mu∣tual
flame, I hope to reap from your indulgence,
what I could not expect from my own desert;
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
and here we present ourselves, in hope of your
paternal assent and benediction.”</P>
<P>“Were she more fair, and good, and gentle
than she is, answered the Castilian, (and to my
partial observation, nought e'er appeared on earth,
more beauteous and engaging) I would approve
your title to her heart, and recommend you to
her smiles, with all a father's influence and pow∣er:
yes, my daughter! my joy on this occasion
is infinitely augmented by the knowledge of those
tender ties of love that bind thee to this amiable
youth: a youth! to whose uncommon courage
and generosity I owe my life and my subsistance,
together with the inexpressible delight that now
revels in my bosom. Enjoy, my children, the
happy fruits of your reciprocal attachment. May
heaven, which hath graciously conducted you
through a labyrinth of perplexity and woe, to this
transporting view of bli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sful days, indulge you
with that uninterrupted stream of pure felicity,
which is the hope, and ought to be the boon of
virtue, such as yours.”</P>
<P>So saying, he joined their hands, and em∣braced
them with the most cordial love and sa∣tisfaction,
which diffused itself to every individual
of the company, who fervently invoked the Al∣mighty
Power, in behalf of this enraptured
pair. The tumult of these emotions having a lit∣tle
subsided, and the Castilian being seated be∣twixt
Renaldo and his beauteous bride, he politely
bespoke the indulgence of madame Clement,
begging she would permit him to demand the
performance of the count's promise, that he might
be forthwith made acquainted with those circum∣stances
of his own fate, which he was so impa∣tient
to learn.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="265"/>
The lady having assured him, that she and all
the company would take pleasure in hearing the
recapitulation, the Spaniard, addressing himself to
Melvile, “In the name of heaven! said he, how
could you supplant that rival, who fell a sacrifice
to my resentment, after he had bewitched the
heart of Serafina? for, sure, the affection he had
kindled in her breast, must have long survived
his death.” “That rival, replied the count,
who incurred your displeasure, was no other than
Renaldo.” With these words, he applied to one eye
a patch of black silk provided for the purpose, and
turning his face towards don Diego, that gentle∣man
started with astonishment, crying, “Good
heaven! the very countenance of Orlando, whom
I slew! this is still more amazing!”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="65" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A retrospective link, necessary for the concatenation
of these memoirs.</HEAD>
<P>“INdulge me with a patient hearing, proceeded
the Hungarian, and all these riddles soon will
be explained. Inflamed with the desire of seeing
foreign countries, I disobeyed the will of an in∣dulgent
father, from whose house withdrawing
privately, I set out for Italy, in disguise, by the
way of Tyrol, visited Venice, Rome, Florence,
and embarking at Naples, in an English ship,
arrived at St. Lucar, from whence I repaired to
Seville; there, in a few days, was my curiosity
engaged by the same of the fair Serafina, who was
justly deemed the most accomplished beauty in
that part of Spain. Nay, blush not, gentle crea∣ture!
for, by my hopes of heaven! thy charms
<PB N="265" REF="266"/>
were even injured by the cold applause of that
report: nevertheless, I was warmly interested by
the uncommon character, and cagerly longed to
see this pattern of perfection. As don Diego did
not train her up in that restraint to which the
Spanish ladies are subjected, I soon found an op∣portunity
of seeing her at church; and no person
here present will, I presume, doubt that I was
instantly captivated by her beauty and deportment.
Had I thought that don Diego's favour was un∣engaged,
perhaps I should have followed the dic∣tates
of vanity and inexperience, and presented
myself in my own character, among the croud
of her professed admirers. I knew her father had
been an officer of distinguished rank and reputa∣tion,
and did not doubt that he would have re∣garded
a young soldier of unexceptionable pedi∣gree,
and I will even add, of unattainted fame:
nor did I suppose my own father could have ob∣jected
against such an advantageous match; but,
by dint of industrious enquiry, I learned, that the
divine Serafina was already betrothed to don Ma∣nuel
de Mendoza, and this information over∣whelmed
me with despair.</P>
<P>After having revolved a thousand projects for
retarding and preventing that detested union, I
resolved to avail myself of my talent for drawing,
and professed myself a master of that science, in
hope of being employed by the father of Serafina,
who, I knew, let slip no opportunity of improv∣ing
his daughter's education. Accordingly I had
the good fortune to attract his notice, was invited
to his house, honoured with his approbation, and
furnished with unrestricted opportunities of con∣versing
with the dear object of my love. The
passion which her beauty had kindled, was, by
<PB N="266" REF="267"/>
the perfections of her mind, inflamed to such a
degree of transport, as could not be concealed
from her penetration. She chanced to relish my
conversation; I gradually acquired her friendship;
pity was the next passion that she entertained in
my favour. I then ventured to disclose myself,
and the dear charmer did not disapprove of my
presumption. She and her mother had been per∣plexed
with some religious scruples, concerning
which they appealed to my opinion; and I was
happy enough to set their minds at ease.</P>
<P>This sort of intercourse naturally created a
mutual confidence among us; and, in a word, I
was blessed with the daughter's love and mother's
approbation. Don Diego will pardon those clan∣destine
measures which we took, from a full per∣suasion,
that it was impossible to render him pro∣pitious
to the views in which our hearts and hands
were so deeply interested: I did not then know
how little he was addicted to superstition.</P>
<P>Without entering into a detail of the schemes
we projected to delay the happiness of Mendoza,
I shall only observe, that knowing the fatal day
was, at length, unalterably fixed, we determined
to elude the purpose of don Diego by flight, and
every thing was actually prepared for our escape.
When the hour of appointment arrived, I repair∣ed
to the place at which I had proposed to enter
the house, and stumbled, in the dark, over the
body of a man still warm and bleeding. Alarmed
at this occurrence, I darted myself through the
window, and rushing to the apartment of the
ladies, (immortal powers!) beheld the peerless
Serafina, and her virtuous mother, stretched
on a couch, and in all appearance deprived of
life.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268"/>
The company will easily conceive what ago∣nies
I felt at such a spectacle. I ran towards the
spot in a transport of horror! I clasped my lovely
mistress in my arms, and finding her still breath∣ing,
endeavoured, but in vain, to wake her from
the trance: Antonia was overwhelmed with the
same lethargic power. My fancy was imme∣diately
struck with the apprehension of their be∣ing
poisoned. Regardless of my own situation, I
alarmed the family, called for assistance, and re∣quested
the servants to summon don Diego to the
dismal scene. I was informed, that their master
had rode forth in manifest confusion; and while
I pondered on this surprising excursion, an apo∣thecary
in the neighbourhood entered the cham∣ber,
and having examined the pulses of the ladies,
declared, that their lives were in no danger, and
advised that they should be undressed and conveyed
to bed. While their women were busied in this
employment, I went into the court-yard, attend∣ed
by some of the servants with lights, in order
to view the body of the man, which I had found
at my arrival. His apparel was mean, his coun∣tenance
ferocious, a long spado was buckled to his
thigh, and in his belt were stuck a brace of loaded
pistols; so that we concluded he was some thief,
who had waited for an opportunity, and seeing
the casement open, intended to rob the house, but
was prevented and slain by don Diego himself,
whose retreat, however, did not a little confound
our conjecture. For my own part, I remained
all night in the house, tortured with fear, vexa∣tion,
and suspence.</P>
<P>My hope was altogether disappointed by this
unhappy accident, and I shuddered at the pro∣spect
of losing Serafina for ever, either by this
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
mysterious malady, or by her marriage with Men∣doza,
which I now despaired of being able to de∣feat.
The major-domo having waited several
hours for his lord's return, without seeing him
appear, thought proper to dispatch a messenger to
don Manuel, with an account of what had hap∣pened;
and that nobleman arriving in the morn∣ing,
took possession of the house. About four
o'clock in the afternoon, Serafina began to stir,
and at five, she and her mother were perfectly
awake.</P>
<P>They no sooner recovered the use of reflection,
than they gave signs of equal sorrow and amaze∣ment,
and earnestly called for Isabella, who was
privy to our design, and who, after a very minute
enquiry, was found in a lone and solitary cham∣ber,
where she had been confined. Such was the
confusion of the house, that no person ever dream∣ed
of asking how I had entered, each domestick,
in all probability, supposing that I had been in∣troduced
by his fellow: so that I tarried unques∣tioned,
on pretence of concern for the distress of
a family, in which I had been so generously en∣tertained;
and by Isabella sent my respects and
duty to her ladies: she was therefore not a little
surprized, when, after every other servant had
withdrawn, she heard the lovely Serafina exclaim,
with all the violence of grief, “Ah! Isabella,
Orlando is no more!” but their astonishment
was still greater, when she assured them of my
being alive, and in the house. They recounted
to her the adventure of last night, which she ex∣plained
by informing them of the letters which
don Diego had intercepted: and they immediate∣ly
concluded, that he had, in the precipitation of
his wrath, killed, by mistake, the person who
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
was found dead in the court-yard. This conjec∣ture
alarming them on my account, they, by the
medium of Isabella, conjured me to leave the
house, lest don Diego should return, and accom∣plish
his resentment; and I was persuaded to
withdraw, after I had settled the channel of a
correspondence with the confidante.</P>
<P>Being now obliged to alter our measures, be∣cause
our former intention was discovered by don
Diego, I secured a retreat for Serafina and her
mother, at the house of the English consul in Se∣ville,
who was my particular friend; and next
day understanding, from Isabella, that her lord
had not yet re-appeared, and that don Manuel
was very urgent in his addresses, we concerted
an assignation in the garden, and that same even∣ing
I was fortunate enough to convey my prize
to the asylum I had prepared for their reception.
Inexpressible was the rage of Mendoza, when
he heard of their elopement: he raved like one
deprived of reason, swore he would put all the
servants of the family to the rack, and in conse∣quence
of the intelligence he obtained by threats
and promises, set on foot a very strict enquiry,
in order to apprehend the fugitives and Orlando,
who had, by some means or other, incurred his
suspicion.</P>
<P>We eluded his search by the vigilance and cau∣tion
of our kind host; and while we remained in
concealment, were extremely astonished to hear,
that the unfortunate don Diego was proclaimed a
traitor, and a price set upon his head. This in∣formation
overwhelmed us all with the utmost
affliction: Antonia lamented, without ceasing, the
disgrace of her beloved lord, from whom she ne∣ver
would have withdrawn herself, but with the
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>
lively hope of a reconciliation, after the first
transports of his ire should have subsided, and the
real character of Orlando should have appeared:
it was not long before we had reason to believe,
that Mendoza was the accuser of don Diego.—</P>
<P>Nay, start not, Signior; Manuel was actually
that traitor: this was the turn of his revenge;
when he found himself disappointed in the hope
of possessing the incomparable Serafina, he took a
base advantage of your absence and retreat. He
posted to Madrid, impeached you to the secreta∣ry
of state, of having maintained a criminal cor∣respondence
with the enemies of Spain, included
me in his accusation, as a spy for the house of
Austria, and framed such a plausible tale from the
circumstances of your distress, that don Diego was
outlawed, and Mendoza gratified with a grant of
his estate.</P>
<P>These melancholy incidents made a deep im∣pression
upon the mind of the virtuous Antonia,
who, waving every other consideration, would
have personally appeared for the vindication of
her husband's honour, had not we dissuaded her
from such a rash undertaking, by demonstrating
her inability to contend with such a powerful an∣tagonist,
and representing, that her appearance
would be infallibly attended with the ruin of
Serafina, who would certainly fall into the hands
of the villain to whom she had been contracted.
We exhorted her to wait patiently for some happy
revolution of fortune, and encouraged her with
the hope of don Diego's exerting himself effec∣tually
in his own defence.</P>
<P>Mean while, our worthy landlord was suddenly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off by death; and his widow being resolv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to retire into her own country, we secretly em∣barked
<PB N="271" REF="272"/>
in the same ship, and arrived in England
about eighteen months ago. Antonia still continued
to pine over the ruin of her house; as she could
hear no tidings of Don Diego, she concluded he
was dead, and mourned with unabating sorrow.
In vain I assured her that soon as my own affairs
should be adjusted, I would exert my whole en∣deavours
to find and succour him. She could
not imagine that a man of his spirit and disposition
would live so long in obscurity; and her afflic∣tion
derived new force from the death of the
consul's widow, with whom she had lived in the
most unbounded intimacy and friendship. From
that day her health evidently declined: she fore∣saw
her dissolution and comforted herself with the
hope of seeing her husband and her friend, in
a place where no treachery is felt, and no sor∣row
is known; confident of my integrity, and the
purity of my love, she in the most pathetic
terms recommended Serafina to my care.—</P>
<P>Ha! weepest thou, fair excellence, at the re∣membrance
of that tender scene, when the good
Antonia, on the bed of death, joined thy soft hand
to mine, and said, “Renaldo, I bequeath this
orphan to your love; it is a sacred pledge which
if you cherish with due honour and regard,
internal peace and happiness will ever smile with∣in
your bosom: but if you treat it with indiffe∣rence,
dishonour or neglect, just heaven will
punish your breach of trust with everlasting dis∣appointments
and disquiet.”</P>
<P>Signior Don Diego, I see you are moved, and
therefore will not dwell on such distressful cir∣cumstances.
The excellent Antonia exchanged
this life for a more happy state; and so exquisite
was the sorrow of the tender-hearted Serafina, as
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
to torture me with the apprehension that she
would not long survive her pious mother. How
I obeyed the injunctions of that departing saint,
Monimia (for that name she now assumed) can
testify, until that artful serpent Fathom glided
into our mutual confidence, abused our ears, poi∣soned
our unsuspecting faith, and effected that
fatal breach, productive of all the misery and vexa∣tion
which we have suffered, and which is now
so happily expelled.”</P>
<P>“Heaven, said the Castilian, hath visited me
for the sins and errors of my youth; yet, such
mercy hath been mingled with its chastisements,
I dare not murmur or repine. The tears of pe∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence
and sorrow shall water my Antonia's
grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice at his treachery,
by which the obligation of my promise is cancelled,
and my honour fully acquitted. He shall not
triumph in his guilt: my services, my character
and innocence shall soon confront his perfidy, and
I hope, deseat his interest: The king is just and
gracious, nor is my family and name unknown.”</P>
<P>Here the Jew interposing, presented to him a
letter from a person of consequence at Madrid,
whom Joshua had interested in the cause of don
Diego; that nobleman had already found means
to represent the case of Zelos to his majesty,
who had actually ordered don Manuel to be
confined, until the injured person should appear
to justify himself, and prosecute his accuser ac∣cording
to the terms of law: at the same time
don Diego was summoned to present himself
before the king within a limited time, to answer
to the charge which Mendoza had brought a∣gainst him.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274"/>
The Spaniard's heart overflow'd with gratitude
and joy, when he read this intimation; he em∣braced
the Jew, who, before Zelos could give
utterance to his thoughts, told him that the Spa∣nish
Ambassador at London, having been pre∣possessed
in his favour, craved the honour of seeing
don Diego; and that he, Joshua, was ready to
conduct them to the house.</P>
<P>“Then is my heart at rest! (cried the Casti∣lian)
the house of Zelos once more shall lift up
its head. I shall again revisit my native coun∣try
with honour, and abase the villain who
hath soiled my fame! O my children! this day
is replete with such joy and satisfaction, as I did
not think had been in the power of heaven to
grant, without the interposition of a miracle!
To you Renaldo, to you illustrious lady, and to
these worthy gentlemen, am I indebted for the re∣storation
of that for which alone I wish to live,
and when my heart ceases to retain the obligation,
may I forfeit the name of a Castilian, and
scorn and dishonour be my portion.”</P>
<P>Perhaps all Europe could not produce another
company so happy as that which now sat down
to dinner in the house of madame Clement,
whose own benevolent heart was peculiarly adapt∣ed
for such enjoyment. The lovers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easted
their eyes more than their appetite, by a tender
intercourse of glances, which needed not the
slow interpretation of speech; while the Spa∣niard
regarded them alternately with looks of
wonder and paternal joy, and every individual
surveyed the all-deserving pair with admiration
and esteem.</P>
<P>Serafina taking the advantage of this general
satisfaction, when the heart softened into com∣placency,
<PB N="274" REF="275"/>
deposits every violent thought: “I
must now, (said she) try my interest with Renaldo:
the good company shall bear witness to my tri∣umph
or repulse. I do not ask you to forgive,
but to withold your vengeance from the wretched
Fathom. His fraud, ingratitude and villainy are,
I believe, unrivalled: yet his base designs have
been defeated; and heaven perhaps hath made
him the involuntary instrument for bringing our
constancy and virtue to the test; besides, his per∣fidy
is already punished with the last degree of
human misery and disgrace: the Doctor, who has
traced him in all his conduct and vicissitudes of
fortune, will draw a picture of his present wretch∣edness,
which, I doubt not, will move your com∣passion,
as it hath already excited mine.”</P>
<P>The generous hostess was ready to enforce this
charitable proposal, with all her eloquence,
when Melvile with a look that well expressed
his magnanimity of love, replied, “Such a boon
becomes the gentle Serafina. O! every moment
furnishes me with fresh matter to admire the vir∣tues
of thy soul: if thou, whose tender heart hath
been so rent with misery and anguish, canst in∣tercede
for thy tormentor, who now suffers in
his turn, shall I refuse to pardon the miserable
wretch! no, let me glory in imitating the great
example, and sollicit Don Diego in behalf of the
same miscreant whose perfidious barbarity cost
him such intolerable woe.” Enough, cried the
Castilian, I have disclaimed the vindictive prin∣ciples
of a Spaniard; and leave the miserable ob∣ject
to the sting of his own conscience, which
soon or late, will not fail to avenge the wrongs
we have sustained from his deceit.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The History draws near a Period.</HEAD>
<P>UNiversal was the applause which they ac∣quired
by this noble sacrifice of their re∣sentment:
the afternoon was spent in the utmost
harmony and good humour; and at the earnest
solicitation of Renaldo, whose fancy still har∣boured
the apprehensions of another separation,
don Diego consented that the indissoluble knot
should be tied between that young gentleman
and Serafina in two days, and the place ap∣pointed
for the ceremony, was the very church
where they had been restored to the arms of
each other.</P>
<P>The lovely bride, with a silent blush that set
her lover's heart on fire, submitted to this deter∣mination,
in consequence of which, the com∣pany
was bespoke for that auspicious hour, and
the evening being pretty far advanced, they took
leave of the ladies, and retired to their respective
homes; don Diego and his future son in law
being reconducted to their lodgings, in the coach
of the Jew, who taking an opportunity of being
alone with Melvile, observed that it would be
necessary on this occasion to supply the Castilian
with a sum of money, in order to support his
dignity and independence, in furnishing Serafina
with every thing suitable to her rank and merit;
and that he would willingly accommodate him,
provided he knew how to propose it so as to give
no offence to his punctilious disposition.</P>
<P>Renaldo thanking him for this generous anti∣cipation,
advised him to sollicit the Spaniard's
<PB N="276" REF="277"/>
correspondence in the way of business, and to
put the whole on the footing of his own in∣terest;
by which means don Diego's delicacy
could sustain no affront. Fraught with this in∣struction,
the Israelite desired a private audience
of the Castilian, in which after an apology for
the freedom of his demand, “Signior don Diego,
(said he) as your fortune hath been so long em∣bezzled
by your adversary in Spain, and your
correspondence with that country intirely cut
off, it is not to be supposed that your finances
are at present in such a condition, as to main∣tain
the splendour of your family. Count de
Melvile's whole fortune is at your command;
and had not he been afraid of giving umbrage
to the peculiar delicacy of your sentiments,
he would have pressed you to use it for your
convenience. For my own part, over and a∣bove
the inclination I have to serve don Diego,
I consult my own private advantage in desiring
you to accept my service on this occasion.
Money is the chief commodity in which I deal,
and if you honour me with your commands,
I shall be a gainer by my obedience.”</P>
<P>Don Diego replied with a smile that denoted
how well he understood the meaning of this ad∣dress;
“Surely, Signior, I am bound by the
strongest ties, to exert my utmost endeavours
for your advantage; and I pray God this your
proposal may have that issue: I am well ac∣quainted
with the Count's generosity and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined
notions of honour; and too much obliged
by him already, to hesitate with punctilious re∣serve
in accepting his future assistance: never∣theless,
since you have contrived a scheme for
removing all scruples of that sort, I shall execute
<PB N="277" REF="278"/>
t with pleasure; and in the form of business,
you shall have all the security I can give for
what shall be necessary to answer my present
occasions.”</P>
<P>The preliminaries being thus settled, Joshua
advanced for his use a thousand pounds, for which
he would take neither bond, note nor receipt,
desiring only that the Castilian would mark it
in his own pocket book, that the debt might ap∣pear,
in case any accident should befal the bor∣rower.
Although the Spaniard had been ac∣customed
to the uncommon generosity of Mel∣vile,
he could not help wondering at this noble∣ness
of behaviour, so little to be expected from
any merchant, much less from a Jewish broker.</P>
<P>While this affair was on the anvil, Renaldo
who could no longer withhold the communication
of his happiness from his sister and relations in
Germany, took up the pen, and in a letter to
his brother in law, recounted all the circumstan∣ces
of the surprizing turn of fate which he had
experienced since his arrival in England: he
likewise related the story of don Diego, informed
them of the day appointed for his nuptials, and
intreated the major to make a journey to Lon∣don
with his wife; or if that should be imprac∣ticable,
to come as far as Brussels, where they
should be met by him and his Serafina. There
was now but one day between him and the
accomplishment of his dearest wish, and that was
spent in procuring a license, and adjusting the
preparations for the grand festival. Don Diego
in the forenoon visited madame Clement, to
whom he repeated his warm acknowledgments
of her bounty and maternal affection to his daugh∣ter,
and presented to Serafina, bank notes to
<PB N="278" REF="279"/>
the amount of five hundred pounds, to defray
the necessary expence of her wedding orna∣ments.</P>
<P>All the previous steps being taken for the
solemnization of this interesting event, and the
hour of appointment arrived, the bridegroom,
accompanied by his father in law, hastened to
the place of rendezvous, which was the vestry
room of the church we have already described;
where they were received by the good clergy∣man
in his canonicals; and here they had not
waited many minutes, when they were joined
by madame Clement and the amiable bride, es∣corted
by the friendly physician, who had all
along bore such a share in their concerns. Sera∣fina
was dressed in a sack of white sattin, and
the ornaments of her head were adjusted in
the Spanish fashion, which gave a peculiar air
to her appearance, and an additional spirit to
those attractions which engaged the heart of each
beholder. There was nothing remarkable in
the habit of Renaldo, who had copied the plain∣ness
and elegance of his mistress; but when
she entered the place, his features were animat∣ed
with a double proportion of vivacity, and
their eyes meeting, seemed to kindle a blaze
which diffused warmth and joy thro' the coun∣tenances
of all present.</P>
<P>After a short pause her father led her to the
altar, and gave her away to the transported
Renaldo, before the priest who performed the
ceremony, and bestowed the nuptial benediction
on this enraptured pair. The sanction of the
church being thus obtained, they withdrew into
the vestry, where Melvile sealed his title on her
rosy lips, and presented his wife to the company,
<PB N="279" REF="280"/>
who embraced her in their turns, with fervent
wishes for their mutual happiness.</P>
<P>Tho' the scene of this transaction was remote
from any inhabited neighbourhood, the church
was surrounded by a crowd of people, who with
uncommon demonstrations of surprize and ad∣miration,
petitioned heaven to bless so fair a
couple. Such indeed was their eagerness to see
them, that some lives were endangered by the
pressure of the crowd, which attended them with
loud acclamation to the coach, after the brim∣groom
had deposited in the hands of the minister,
one hundred pounds for the benefit of the poor
of that parish, and thrown several handfuls of
money among the multitude. Serafina reim∣barked
in madame Clement's convenience, with
that good lady and don Diego, while Renaldo
with the clergyman and doctor followed in
Joshua's coach, to a pleasant country house upon
the Thames, at the distance of a few miles from
London. This the Jew had borrowed from
the owner, for a few days, and there they were
received by that honest Hebrew, who had pro∣vided
a very elegant entertainment for the occa∣sion:
he had also bespoke a small but excellent
band of musick, which regaled their ears while
they sat at dinner; aud the afternoon being calm
and serene, he prevailed on them to take the
air on the river, in a barge which he had pre∣pared
for the purpose.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding this diversity of amuse∣ment,
Renaldo would have found it the longest
day he had ever passed, had not his imagina∣tion
been diverted by an incident which em∣ployed
his attention during the remaining part
of the evening. They had drank tea, and en∣gaged
<PB N="280" REF="281"/>
in a party at whist, when they were sur∣prized
with a noise of contention from a pub∣lick
house, that fronted the windows of the a∣partment
in which they sat. Alarmed at this
uproar, they forsook their cards, and throwing
up the casements, beheld a hearse surrounded
by four men on horseback, who had stopped the
carriage and violently pulled the driver from his
seat. This uncommon arrest had engaged the
curiosity of the publican's family, who stood at
the door to observe the consequence, when all
of a sudden, appeared a person in canonicals, well
mounted, who riding up to those who maltreated
the driver, bestowed upon one of them, such a
blow with the but-end of his whip, as laid him
sprawling on the ground, and springing from his
saddle upon the box, took the reins into his
own hand, swearing with great vehemence, that
he would murther every man who should at∣tempt
to obstruct the hearse.</P>
<P>The good priest who had married Renaldo,
was not a little scandalized at this ferocious be∣haviour
in a clergyman, and could not help
saying aloud, he was a disgrace to the cloth;
when the horseman looking up to the window,
replied, “Sir, may I be d—n'd if any man
in England has a greater respect for the cloth
than I have; but at present I am quite distract∣ed.”
So saying, he whipped up the horses,
and had actually disentangled the hearse from
those who surrounded it; when he was opposed
by another troop, one of whom alighted with
great expedition, and cut the harness so as that
he could not possibly proceed: finding himself
thus driven to bay, he leaped upon the ground,
and exercised his weapon with such amazing
<PB N="281" REF="282"/>
strength and agility, that several of his antago∣nists
were left motionless on the field, before he
was overpowered and disarmed by dint of num∣bers,
who assailed him on all sides.</P>
<P>The mad parson being thus taken prisoner, an
elderly person of a very prepossessing appearance,
went up to the hearse, and unbolting the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor,
a young lady sprung out, and shri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king, ran di∣rectly
to the public house, to the infinite astonish∣ment
and affright of the whole family, who be∣lieved
it was the spirit of the deceased person,
whose body lay in the carriage. Renaldo, who
was with difficulty restrained from interposing in
behalf of the clergyman against such odds, no
sooner perceived this apparition, than supposing
her to be some distressed damsel, his Quixotism
awoke, he descended in an instant, and rushed
into the house, among those who pursued the fair
phantome. Don Diego and the physician took
the same road, while the real clergyman and Jo∣shua
tarried with the ladies, who were, by this
time, very much interested in the event.</P>
<P>Melvile found the young lady in the hands of the
old gentleman, who had released her from the hearse,
and who now bitterly upbraided her for her folly,
and disobedience: while she protested, with great
vivacity, that whatever she might suffer from his
severity, she would never submit to the hateful
match he had proposed, nor break the promise
she had already made to the gentleman who had
now attempted to rescue her from the tyranny of
a cruel father. This declaration was followed
by a plentiful shower of tears, which the father
could not behold with unmoistened eyes, altho'
he reviled her with marks of uncommon dis∣pleasure,
and turning to the count, “I appeal to
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>
you, Sir, said he, whether I have not reason to
curse the undutiful obstinacy of that pert baggage,
and renounce her for ever as an alien to my
blood. She has, for some months, been sollicited
in marriage by an honest citizen, a thirty thou∣sand
pound man; and instead of listening to such
an advantageous proposal, she hath bestowed her
heart upon a young fellow, not worth a groat.
Ah! you degenerate hussy, this comes of your
plays and romances: if thy mother were not a
woman of an unexceptionable life and conversa∣tion,
I should verily believe thou art no child of
mine: run away with a beggar! for shame!”</P>
<P>“I suppose, replied Renaldo, the person to
whom your daughter's affection inclines, is that
clergyman who exerted himself so manfully at the
door.” “Clergyman! cried the other, adad!
he has more of the devil than the church about
him. A ruffian! he has, for ought I know,
murthered the worthy gentleman whom I intend∣ed
for my son-in-law; and the rogue, if I had
not kept out of his way, would, I suppose, have
served me with the same sauce: me! who have
been his master for many years, and had resolved
to make a man of him. Sir, he was my own
clerk, and this is the return I have met with
from the serpent which I cherished in my bo∣som.”</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by the arrival of
the citizen for whom he had expressed such con∣cern:
that gentleman had received a contusion
upon one eye, by which the sight was altogether
obstructed; so that he concluded he should never
retrieve the use of that organ, and with great
clamour took all the spectators to witness the in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury
he had sustained; he entered the room with
<PB N="283" REF="284"/>
manifest perturbation, demanded satisfaction of
the father, and peremptorily declared it should
not be a lost eye to him, if there was law in Eng∣land.
This unseasonable demand, and the boi∣sterous
manner in which it was made, did not at
all suit the present humour of the old gentleman,
who told him peevishly he owed him no eye, and
bade him go and ask reparation of the person who
had done him wrong.</P>
<P>The young lady snatching this favourable oc∣casion,
earnestly entreated Melvile and his com∣pany
to intercede with her father in behalf of her
lover, who, she assured them, was a young gen∣tleman
of a good family, and uncommon merit;
and, in compliance with her request, they in∣vited
him and his daughter to the house in which
they lodged, where they would be disincumbered
of the croud which this dispute had gathered to∣gether,
and more at leisure to consult about the
measures necessary to be taken. The old gentle∣man
thanked them for their courtesy, which he
did not think proper to refuse, and while he led,
or rather hauled mademoiselle over the way, un∣der
the auspices of the Castilian, Renaldo set the
lover at liberty, made him a tender of his good
offices, and advised him to wait at the public house
for an happy issue of their negotiation.</P>
<P>The pseudo-parson was very much affected by
this generous proffer, for which he made suitable
acknowledgments, and protested before God, he
would die a thousand deaths, rather than part
with his dear Charlotte. Her father no sooner
entered the apartment, than he was known by
Joshua to be a considerable trader in the city of
London, and the merchant was glad to find him∣self
among his acquaintance. He was so full of
<PB N="284" REF="285"/>
the story which had brought him thither, that he
had scarce sat down, when he began to complain
of his hard sate, in having an only child, who
was so mean, stubborn and contumacious; and
every sentence was concluded with an apostrophe
of reproaches to the delinquent.</P>
<P>The Jew having allowed him to ring out his
alarm, condoled his misfortune, and gravely coun∣selled
the young lady to wean her affections from
such an unworthy object: for he supposed her fa∣vourite
was a man of no principle, or liberal en∣dowments,
otherwise her father would not ex∣claim
so bitterly against her conduct. Charlotte,
who wanted neither beauty nor understanding,
assured him, that her lover's character was, in all
respects, unblemished; for the truth of which
assertion she appealed to her papa, who owned,
with reluctance, that the young man was a gen∣tleman
by birth, that he had served him with re∣markable
diligence and integrity, and that his ac∣complishments
were far superior to his station in
life. “But then, said he, the fellow has not a
shilling of his own, and would you have me give
away my daughter to a beggar?”</P>
<P>“God forbid! cried the Jew, I always un∣derstood
you possessed an ample fortune, and am
sorry to find it otherwise.” “Otherwise! re∣plied
the citizen, with some acrimony, take care
what you say, Sir, a merchant's credit is not to
be tampered with.” “I beg your pardon, an∣swered
the Hebrew, I concluded that your cir∣cumstances
were bad, because you objected to
the poverty of the young man, after you had
owned he was possessed of every other qualifica∣tion
to make your daughter happy: for it is not
to be imagined, that you would thwart her in∣clinations,
<PB N="285" REF="286"/>
or seek to render an only child misera∣ble,
on account of an obs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acle which you yourself
could easily remove. Let us suppose you can
afford to give with your daughter ten thousand
pounds, which would enable this young man to
live with credit and reputation, and engage ad∣vantageously
in trade, for which you say he is well
qualified: The alternative then will be, whe∣ther
you would rather see her in the arms of a
deserving youth, whom she loves, enjoying all
the comforts of life, with a moderate fortune,
which it will always be in your own power to
improve; or tied for life to a monied man, whom
she detests, cursing her hard sate, and despising
that superfluity of wealth, in spite of which she
finds herself so truly wretched.”</P>
<P>The old gentleman seemed to be startled at
this observation, which was reinforced by Renal∣do's
saying, that he would, moreover, enjoy the
unutterable pleasure of giving happiness to a wor∣thy
man, whose gratitude would co-operate with
his love, in approving himself a dutiful son, as
well as an affectionate husband. He then repre∣sented
the family disquiets, and dismal tragedies,
produced from such mercenary and compulsive
matches; and in conclusion related the story of don
Diego and his daughter, which when the merchant
heard, he started up with marks of terror in his
countenance, and throwing up the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sement,
called upon Valentine with great vociferation;
this was the name of his daughter's admirer, who
no sooner heard the summons, than he flew to
the spot from whence it came, and the merchant,
without any further preamble, seizing his hand,
joined it with that of Charlotte, saying, with
great trepidation, “Here take her, in the name
<PB N="286" REF="287"/>
of God, and thank this honourable company for
your good fortune.”</P>
<P>The lovers were transported with exquisite joy
at this sudden determination in their favour. Va∣lentine
having kissed the hand of his mistress, with
all the eagerness of rapture, and acknowledged
the merchant's generosity, paid his respects to the
ladies with a very polite address, and with de∣monstrations
of uncommon gratitude and sensibi∣lity,
thanked the gentlemen, and the count in
particular, for their good offices, to which he at∣tributed
the happiness he now enjoyed. While
Serafina and madame Clement caressed the amia∣ble
Charlotte, the rest of the company congratu∣lated
her admirer upon his choice and success;
though the clergyman could not help reprehend∣ing
him for profaning the sacerdotal habit.</P>
<P>Valentine heartily asked pardon for having gi∣ven
such cause of offence, and hoped he should
be forgiven, as it was a disguise which he thought
absolutely necessary for the execution of a scheme
upon which his happiness altogether depended.
He then, at the request of Renaldo, unfolded the
mystery of the hearse, by giving them to under∣stand,
that Charlotte's father having got inkling
of their mutual passion, had dismissed his clerk,
and conveyed his daughter to a country house in
the neighbourhood of London, in order to cut
off their correspondence: notwithstanding these
precautions, they had found means to communi∣cate
with each other by letters, which were ma∣naged
by a third person, and his rival being very
importunate in his sollicitations, they had con∣certed
the expedient of the hearse, which he pro∣vided
and conducted through a road contiguous to
the end of the merchant's garden, where Char∣lotte
<PB N="287" REF="288"/>
being apprized of the design, waited for its
approach, and embarked in it without hesitation.
Valentine thought himself sufficiently screened
from discovery by his disguise, but he was unfor∣tunately
met by a servant of the family, who re∣collected
his features, and immediately gave the
alarm, upon which the father and his friends took
horse, and pursued them by two different roads,
until they were overtaken at this place.</P>
<P>He had scarce finished this short relation, when
his rival bluntly entering the apartment, with an
handkerchief tied round his eye, committed Va∣lentine
to the charge of a constable, who attended
him, by a warrant from a justice of the peace in
that neighbourhood; and threatened to prosecute
the merchant on an action of damages for the loss
of an eye, which he said he had sustained in his
service. The company endeavoured to appease
this citizen, by representing, that his misfortune
was no other than a common inflammation; nor
was it owing to malice aforethought, but entirely
to the precipitate passion of an incensed young
man, who, by the bye, acted in his own defence.
At the same time the merchant promised to make
any reasonable satisfaction; upon which the other
demanded an obligation, importing, that he
would, in ten days from the date, bestow upon
him his daughter in marriage, with a portion of
fifteen thousand pounds, or, in case of failure,
pay him double the sum.</P>
<P>The merchant, exasperated at this extrava∣gant
demand, told him flatly, he had already
disposed of his daughter to Valentine, who he be∣lieved
was a much more deserving man; and
that he was ready to wait upon the magistrate
who had granted the warrant, in order to give
<PB N="288" REF="289"/>
bail for his future son-in-law. This was a mor∣tifying
declaration to the plaintiff, though he con∣doled
himself with the hope of being a gainer by
the loss of his eye; and now the pain was over,
would have been very sorry to find his sight re∣trieved.
The old gentleman, Joshua, and Re∣naldo
accompanied the prisoner to the house of
the justice, where he was immediately admitted
to bail: upon their return, Valentine shifted his
dress, and they supped together with great cor∣diality
and mirth, maintained at the expence of
the discarded lover.</P>
<P>After supper, don Diego walked a minuet with
madame Clement, for whom, by this time, he had
contracted an extraordinary degree of affection.
Valentine had the honour to dance with the in∣comparable
Serafina, whose beauty and attractions
dazzled the eyes of the new comers, and struck
her bashful partner with awe and confusion; and
Melvile presented his hand to the agreeable Char∣lotte,
who performed so much to the satisfaction of
her father, that he could not help expressing his
joy and pride: he praised God for throwing him
in the way of our company, and engaged the
clergyman to unite the young couple; after hav∣ing
appointed a day for the ceremony, and in∣vited
all present to the wedding. The evening hav∣ing
been insensibly consumed in these avocations,
and the night pretty far advanced, the ladies with∣drew
without ceremony; and the retreat of Se∣rafina
filled Renaldo's breast with tumult and
emotion: his blood began to flow in impetuous
tides, his heart to beat with redoubled vigour and
velocity, while his eye seemed to flash with more
than human splendor: now his imagination be∣gan
to anticipate with the enthusiastic rage of an
<PB N="289" REF="290"/>
inspired Sybil; he was instantaneously transport∣ed
from the conversation, and every nerve was
braced to such a degree of impatience, that hu∣man
nature could not long endure the ten∣sion.</P>
<P>He therefore, having withstood the impulse
about a quarter of an hour, at length gave way
to his impetuosity, and springing from his friends,
found himself in a dark passage, at the farther end
of which, he perceived madame Clement coming
out of a chamber with a light, which at sight of
him she set down, and vanished in a moment.
This was the star that pointed to his paradise:
he hailed the signal, entered the apartment, and
like a lion rushing on his prey, approached the
nuptial bed, where Serafina, surrounded by all the
graces of beauty, softness, sentiment, and truth,
lay trembling as a victim at the altar, and strove
to hide her blushes from his view; the door was
shut, the light extinguished: he owned his lot
was more than mortal man could claim.</P>
<P>Here let me draw the decent veil, that ought
to shade the sacred mysteries of Hymen: away
unhallowed scoffers, who profane with idle plea∣santry,
or immodest hint, these holy rites; and
leave those happy lovers to enjoy, in one another's
arms, unutterable bliss, the well-earned palm of
virtue and of constancy, which had undergone
the most severe refinement: a more deserving
pair night's curtain shrouds not in its dark ex∣tent.</P>
<P>The thoughts of Renaldo's felicity threw a
damp on the spirits of Valentine, who saw the
term of his probation protracted a few days long∣er,
and could not help wishing in his heart, that
he had atchieved the adventure which would have
<PB N="290" REF="291"/>
abridged his expectation, though at the expence
of the old gentleman's displeasure. He filled a
bumper to the health of the bride and bridegroom,
and throwing up his eyes, with marks of admira∣tion,
exclaimed, “How happy is the count! alas!
five days longer must I rein my impatience!”
“It is but reasonable, you rogue, that your bet∣ters
should have the start of you,” said the mer∣chant,
who did him justice in the glass, and coun∣selled
him to drown his impatience with good cla∣ret.
The youth followed his advice, and it was
late before the company retired to rest.</P>
<P>These citizens, however, resolved to seize an
opportunity of rallying the new married couple,
according to custom, and with that view arose
early in the morning, on the supposition of find∣ing
them still asleep; but they were not a little
surprized, when they entered the breakfasting
room, to see Renaldo, and his amiable bedfellow,
already dressed, and waiting to do the honours of
the house. The old gentleman would fain have
cracked a joke upon their extraordinary dispatch,
but he was so much over-awed by the dignity,
and tamed by the sweetness of Serafina's carriage,
that he durst not give utterance to his conception;
and Valentine stood silent and abashed, as in the
presence of a superior being. After breakfast,
these gentlemen and Charlotte again expressed
their sense of the obligations they owed to this
happy family, repeated their invitation, and tak∣ing
leave, returned to London in a coach that
was provided over night.</P>
<P>Our friends being thus left to themselves, don
Diego turning towards Melvile, “Now, said
he, that I have yielded to the impatience of your
love, as well as to the eagerness of my own desire
<PB N="291" REF="292"/>
to make you happy, I must beg leave to interrupt,
for a little while, the stream of your mutual plea∣sure,
and propose a melancholy excursion, which,
however, will not be wholly void of enjoyment.
I have too long delayed the performance of my
duty at Antonia's grave: let us spend the fore∣noon
in that pious pilgrimage: I will drop a few
tears to the memory of that excellent woman,
and never afterwards shall my friends be troubled
with my grief.”</P>
<P>The proposal being universally approved, they
set out for the place, which had oft been visited
by the gentle Serafina, who conducted her father
to a black marble stone, which Renaldo had or∣dered
to be laid over the grave, and as he kneeled
to kiss the monument, he perceived this plain in∣scription
in the Spanish Tongue: <HI>Antonia de Ze∣los
primera en todo lo que es ser bueno, y sin segundo
en todo lo que fué ser desdichado, quedad con Dios!</HI>
that is, <HI>Antonia de Zeios, unmatched in virtue, and
unequalled in misfortune, adieu!</HI> “O faithful
record! (cried the Castilian, smiting his breast,
while his tears distilled upon the marble) thy
goodness was the gift of heaven, but thy misfor∣tunes
were derived from the guilt of don Diego;
yet his sorrow shall expiate his offence, and his
penitence find favour in the sight of heaven: rest,
rest, ill-fated virtue! eternal peace shall guard
thy tomb, and angels minister to thy unspotted
shade; nor shall thine ashes lie in dark obscurity:
here will I raise a monument, more suited to thy
excellence and name.” Serafina melted with filial
tenderness, nor were the rest unmoved at this
affecting scene, which don Diego did not quit
without reluctance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="67" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The longest and the last.</HEAD>
<P>THE nature of this visit had softened every
heart, and saddened every countenance;
and they walked in solemn silence to the other
side of the church-yard, in order to regain their
carriages; when, at the turning of the stile, they
saw a young woman, in wretched attire, running
out of a poor habitation, wringing her hands in
all the agony of despair. Notwithstanding the
distraction in her countenance, and the meanness
of her apparel, she discovered a regularity of fea∣tures,
and a delicacy of air, which did not at all
correspond with the misery of her equipage. These
exhibitions of extreme distress, soon attracted the
notice and compassion of our company, and Mel∣vile's
beauteous help-mate, accosting this forlorn
damsel with a pity-breathing aspect, asked the
cause of her disorder.</P>
<P>“Alas! dear lady, cried the other, with all
the emphasis of woe, an unhappy gentleman now
breathes his last, within this inhospitable hovel,
amidst such excess of misery, as would melt the
most flinty bosom: what then must I feel, who
am connected with him by the strongest ties of
love and conjugal affection!” “Who is the
unfortunate object? said the physician.” “He
was once well known in the gay world: (replied
the young woman) his name is Fathom.” Every
individual of the company started at mention of
that detested name. Serafina began to tremble
with emotion; and Renaldo, after a short pause,
declared he would go in, not with a view to exult
<PB N="293" REF="294"/>
over his misery, but in order to contemplate the
catastrophe of such a wicked life, that the moral
might be the more deeply engraved on his re∣membrance.
The young countess, whose tender
heart could not bear the shock of such a spectacle,
retired to the coach with madame Clement and
the Jew, while Renaldo, accompanied by the rest,
entered a dismal apartment, altogether void of
furniture and convenience, where they beheld the
wretched hero of these memoirs, stretched almost
naked upon straw, insensible, convulsed, and seem∣ingly
in the grasp of death. He was wore to the
bone either by famine or distemper; his face was
overshadowed with hair and filth; his eyes were
sunk, glazed and distorted; his nostrils dilated;
his lips covered with a black slough, and his com∣plexion
faded into a pale clay-colour, tending to
a yellow hue: in a word, the extremity of indi∣gence,
squalor and distress, could not be more
feelingly represented.</P>
<P>While Melvile perused this melancholy lesson,
and groaning, cried, “Behold the fate of man,”
he perceived a letter in the right hand of the un∣fortunate
Fathom, which lay fast clinched across
his breast. Curious to know the contents of this
paper, which the young woman said he had kept
in that position for several days, he drew nearer
the wretched couch, and was not a little surprized
to see it addressed to the right honourable Renaldo
count de Melvile, to the care of Mr. Joshua Ma∣nasseh,
merchant in London. When he attempted
to disengage this billet from the author's hand,
the sorrowing female fell on her knees, entreating
him to desist, and telling him, she had promised,
upon oath, to communicate the contents to no
person upon earth, but to carry the letter, upon
<PB N="294" REF="295"/>
her husband's decease, to the gentleman to whose
care it was directed.</P>
<P>Renaldo assured her upon his honour, that he
was the very Renaldo count de Melvile for
whom it was intended; and the young crea∣ture
was so much confounded at this informa∣tion,
that before she could recollect herself,
Melvile had opened the billet and read these
words. “If this paper should fall into the hands
of the noble Renaldo, he will understand that
Fathom was the most execrable traitor that ever
imposed upon unsuspecting benevolence, or at∣tempted
to betray a generous benefactor. His
whole life was a series of fraud, perfidy and
the most abominable ingratitude: but of all the
crimes that lay heavy upon his soul, his being
accessory to the death of the incomparable Sera∣fina,
whose father he had also robbed, was that,
for which he despaired of heaven's forgiveness,
notwithstanding the dreadful compunction and
remorse which have long preyed upon his heart,
together with the incredible misery and deplo∣rable
death which by this time he hath under∣gone.
Tho' these sufferings and sorrows can∣not
attone for his enormous guilt, perhaps they
will excite the compassion of the humane count
de Melvile: at least, this confession which my
conscience dictates under all the terrors of death
and futurity, may be a warning for him to
avoid henceforth a smiling villain, like the ex∣ecrable
Fathom, upon whose miserable soul
almighty God have mercy.”</P>
<P>Renaldo was deeply affected with the contents
of this scroll, which denoted such horror and
despair. He saw there could be no dissimula∣tion
or finister design in this profession of peni∣tence:
<PB N="295" REF="296"/>
he beheld the condition of the writer,
which put all his humane passions in commo∣tion;
so that he remembered nothing of Fathom
but his present distress. He could sc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e con∣tain
those indications which might have been
justly deemed the effect of weakness and in∣firmity;
and having desired the physician and
clergyman to contribute their assistance for the
benefit of that wretch's soul and body, he ran
to the coach, and communicated the letter to
the ladies; at the same time drawing a picture
of the object he had seen, which brought tears
into the eyes of the gentle Serafina, who ear∣nestly
intreated her lord to use his endeavours
for the relief and recovery of the unhappy man;
that he might, if possible, live to enjoy the
benefit of mature repentance, and not die in
that dreadful despair which he manifested in
the letter.</P>
<P>Renaldo returning to the house, found the
pious clergyman reading prayers with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣vency;
while don Diego stood with his right
hand upon his breast, looking stedfastly upon
the agonizing Fathom, and the young woman
kneeled with her streaming eyes lifted up to
heaven, in an extasy of grief and devotion: the
physician had run to an apothecary's shop in
the neighbourhood, from whence he soon return∣ed
with an assistant, who applied a large blister
to the back of the miserable patient, while the
female, by the doctor's direction, moistened his
mouth with a cordial which he had prescribed.</P>
<P>These charitable steps being taken, Count de
Melvile intreated the apothecary's servant to
procure a tent bed for the accommodation of
the sick person, with all imaginable dispatch;
<PB N="296" REF="297"/>
and in less than an hour, one was actually pitch∣ed,
and Fathom lifted into it, after he had
been shifted and in some measure purified from
the dregs of his indigence. During this trans∣action
the ladies were conducted to a tavern
not far off, where dinner was bespoke, that
they might be at hand to see the effect of their
charity; which was not confined to what we
have already described, but extended so far,
that in a little time, the apartment was comfort∣ably
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnished, and the young creature provided
with change of apparel, and money to procure
the necessaries of subsistance.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all their care, the wretched
Fathom still remained insensible, and the doctor
pronounced a very unfavourable prognostic,
while he ordered a pair of additional vesicatories
to be laid upon his arms, and other proper
medicines to be administred. After dinner, the
ladies ventur'd to visit the place, and when Se∣rafina
crossed the threshold, the weeping female
fell at her feet, and kissing her robe, ex∣claimed,
“Sure you are an angel from heaven!”</P>
<P>The alteration in her dress had made a very
agreeable change in her appearance, so that the
countess could now look upon her, without
shuddering at her distress: and as Fathom was
not in a condition to be disturbed, she took
this opportunity of inquiring by what steps that
unfortunate wretch was conveyed from the
prison, in which she knew he had been confined,
to the place where he now lay in such extre∣mity;
and by what occurrence he had found a
wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in such an abyss of misfortune. Here the
other's tears began to flow afresh. “I am a∣shamed
(said she) to reveal my own folly;
<PB N="297" REF="298"/>
yet I dare not refuse a satisfaction of this kind,
to a person who has laid me under such signal
obligations.”</P>
<P>She then proceeded to relate her story, by
which it appeared, she was no other than the
fair and unhappy Elinor, whom the artful
Fathom had debauched upon his first arrival in
town, in the manner already described in these
memoirs. “Heaven, continued she, was pleased
to restore the use of my reason which I had lost,
when I found myself abandoned by the count;
but, all my connexion with my own family be∣ing
entirely cut off, and every door shut against
a poor creature who could procure no recom∣mendation,
except the certificate signed by the
physician of bedlam, which instead of introduc∣ing
me to service, was an unsurmountable ob∣jection
to my character; I found myself destitute
of all means of subsisting, unless I would con∣descend
to live the infamous and wretched life of
a courtezan, an expedient rendered palatable
by the terrors of want cooperating with the
reflection of the irretrievable loss I had already
sustained. I ask pardon for offending your chaste
ears with this impure confession of my guilt,
which heaven knows, I then did, and now do
look upon with abhorrence and detestation. I
had already forfeited my innocence, and wanted
resolution to encounter misery and death. Ne∣vertheless,
before I could determine to embrace
the condition of a prostitute, I was one day
accosted in the park by an elderly gentleman
who sat down by me upon a bench, and taking
notice of the despondence which was evident in
my countenance, pressed me to make him ac∣quainted
with the nature of my misfortune. So
<PB N="298" REF="299"/>
much sympathy and good sense appeared in his
deportment and conversation, that I gratified his
request, and he, in return for my confidence,
saved me from the most horrible part of my
prospect, by taking me into his protection, and
reserving me for his own appetite. In this situ∣ation
I lived a whole year, until I was deprived
of my keeper by an apoplectic fit, and turned
out of doors by his relations, who did not, how∣ever,
strip me of the cloaths and moveables,
which I owed to his bounty. Far from being
as yet reconciled to a vitious life, I resolved to
renounce the paths of shame, and converting my
effects into ready money, hired a small shop,
and furnished it with haberdashery ware, in∣tending
to earn an honest livelihood by the sale
of these commodities, together with the plain∣work
in which I hoped to be employed, so soon
as my talents should be known. But this scheme
did not answer my expectation. The goods
spoiled upon my hands, and as I was a stranger
in the neighbourhood, no body would intrust
me with any other business: so that notwith∣standing
the most parsimonious oeconomy, I ran
in debt to my landlord, who seized my effects;
and an hosier from whom I had received some
parcels upon credit, took out a writ against me,
by virtue of which, I was arrested and imprisoned
in the Marshalsea, where I found my first sedu∣cer.
Good heaven! what did I feel at this un∣expected
meeting, overwhelmed as I was before,
with my own distress! I with a loud scream
fainted away, and when I recovered, found my∣self
in the arms of Mr. Fathom, who wept over
me with great affliction. All his prospects of
<PB N="299" REF="300"/>
gaiety had now vanished, and his heart was
softened by his own misfortunes, to a feeling of
another's woe, as well as to a due sense of his
own guilt. He expressed the deepest sorrow
for having been the occasion of my ruin, en∣deavour'd
to comfort me with promise of as∣sistance,
and indeed, by practising medicine a∣mong
the prisoners, made shift to keep us both
from starving. But surely, no sinner under∣went
such severe remorse as that which he suf∣fered
during his imprisoment. From the day of
our meeting. I never once saw him smile; a
melancholy cloud continually overhung his coun∣tenance.
He numbered the minutes by h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s groans,
he used to start with horrour from his sleep, and
striking his breast, would exclaim, “O Elinor!
I am the worst of villains!” Sometimes he seemed
disordered in his brain, and raved about Renaldo
and Monimia: in a word, his mind was in a
dreadful situation, and all his agonies were com∣municated
to me, whom by this time he had
married, in order to make some attonement for
my wrongs. Wretched as he then was, I re∣membered
the accomplished youth who had cap∣tivated
my virgin heart, the old impressions still
remained, I saw his penitence, pitied his mis∣fortune;
and his wife being dead, consented to
join his fate, the ceremony having been per∣formed
by a fellow prisoner, who was in or∣ders.
Though his hard-hearted creditor had no
other chance of being payed, than that of set∣ting
him at liberty, he lent a deaf ear to all our
supplications; and this cruelty conspiring with the
anguish of my husband's own reflection, affected
his health and spirits to such a degree, that he
<PB N="300" REF="301"/>
could no longer earn the miserable pittance
which had hitherto supported our lives. Then
our calamities began to multiply. Indigence and
famine stared us in the face; and it was with the
utmost difficulty that we resisted their attacks,
by selling or pledging our wearing apparel, un∣til
we were left almost quite naked, when we
found ourselves discharged by an act passed for
the relief of insolvent debtors. This charitable
law, which was intended for a consolation to the
wretched, proved to us the most severe dis∣aster:
for, we were turned out into the streets,
utterly destitute of food, raiment and lodging;
at a time when Mr. Fathom was so weakened
by his distemper, that he could not stand alone.
I supported him from door to door, imploring
the compassion of charitable christians, and was
at length permitted to shelter him in this mise∣rable
place, where his disease gaining ground,
he lay three days in that deplorable condition,
from which he hath now been rescued (tho' I
fear too late) by your humanity and benevo∣lence.”</P>
<P>She shed a flood of tears at the conclusion of
this mournful tale which did not fail to affect the
whole audience, especially Serafina, who assured
her, that whatever should happen to her hus∣band,
she might depend upon finding favour and
protection, provided her conduct should cor∣respond
with her professions. While this grate∣ful
creature kissed the hand of her kind be∣nesactress,
Fathom uttered a groan, began
to stir in the bed, and with a languid voice
called upon Elinor, who instantly withdrawing
the curtain, presented the whole company to
<PB N="301" REF="302"/>
his view. He had now retrieved the use of his
perception, by the operation of the blisters which
began to torture him severely; he looked around
him with amazement and affright, and distin∣guishing
the three persons against whom the
chief arrows of his sraud and treachery had been
levelled, he concluded that he was now arrived
at the land of departed souls, and that the shades
of those whom he had so grievously injured,
were come to see him tormented according to
his demerits.</P>
<P>Fraught with this notion, which was con∣firmed
by the bodily pain which he felt, and
the appearance of the clergyman and Joshua
whom he mistook for the ministers of vengeance,
he cried in a tone replete with horrour, “Is
there no mercy then for penitence! is there no
pity due to the miseries I suffered upon earth!
save me, O bountiful heaven! from the terrors of
everlasting woe; hide me from these dreadful
executioners, whose looks are torture: forgive
me, generous Castilian. O Renaldo! thou hadst
once a tender heart. I dare not lift my eyes
to Serafina! that pattern of human excellence
who fell a victim to my atrocious guilt; yet,
her aspect is all mildness and compassion. Ha!
are not these the drops of pity? yes, they are
tears of mercy: they fall like refreshing showers
upon my drooping soul! ah murthered inno∣cence!
wilt thou not intercede for thy betrayer
at the throne of grace!”</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by Melvile, who with
a grave and solemn air, pronounced, “Great
hath been thy guilt, unhappy Ferdinand, and
great have been thy sufferings. Yet, we come
<PB N="302" REF="303"/>
not to insult, but to alleviate thy distress. Pro∣vidence
hath kindly defeated thy dire intentions,
which we therefore now forgive and transmit to
oblivion▪ whether it be thy lot to yield up thy
spirit immediately, or to survive the dangerous
malady with which thou art at present over∣whelmed.
Suffer not thyself to despair; for,
the mercy of heaven is infinite; and submit to
the directions of this worthy gentleman who will
employ his skill for thy recovery, while we shall
take care to furnish thee with necessary at∣tendance:
as too much speaking may be pre∣judicial
to thy health, I dispense with a reply,
and exhort thee to compose thy self to rest.”
So saying, he drew the curtain, and the com∣pany
retired, leaving Fathom intranced with
wonder.</P>
<P>The next step which Renaldo took for the
benefit of this wretched penitent, was to send
for the apothecary with whom he left a sum
of money to be expended for the convenience
of Fathom and his wife; then he laid injunc∣tions
upon the physician to repeat his visits;
and that gentleman, together with the clergyman
and Joshua, taking leave of the others till next
day, the count set out with the ladies and his
father in law, to the house where they had lodg∣ed
the preceding night.</P>
<P>The reader may well imagine the conversa∣tion
of the evening turned wholly upon the
strange occurrence of the day, which seemed
to have been concerted by supernatural pre∣science,
in order to satisfy the vengeance, and
afford matter of triumph to the generosity of
those who had been so grievously injured by the
<PB N="303" REF="304"/>
guilty Fathom. Tho' not one of them would
say that such a miscreant ought to live; yet all
concurred in approving the offices of humanity
which had been performed, and even endea∣voured
to find specious pretexts for vindicating
their compassion. Don Diego said it would ill
become a transgressor like him, to with-hold his
forgiveness from a sinner who had wrong'd
him: Madame Clement appealed to the appro∣bation
of heaven, which had undoubtedly directed
them that way, for the purpose they had ful∣filled:
Serasina observed that the crimes of the
delinquent were obliterated by his sorrow, mi∣sery
and repentance: Renaldo honestly owned
that, exclusive of other reasons, he could not
deny himself the luxurious enjoyment of com∣municating
happiness to his fellow creatures in
distress; and each fervently prayed that their
charity might not be disappointed by the death
of the object.</P>
<P>While they amused themselves in these dis∣cussions,
Fathom, after having lain some hours
silent, in consequence of Renaldo's advice, could
no longer suppress the astonishment of his mind,
but, addressing himself to his wife, “O Elinor!
(said he) my delirium is now past: tho' I still
remember the phantasies of my distemper'd brain:
among other reveries, my imagination was re∣galed
with a vision so perfect and distinct, as
to emulate truth and reality. Methought count
de Melvile, don Diego de Zelos, and the di∣vine
Serafina, the very persons who are now
crying before the throne of heaven for venge∣ance
against the guilty Fathom, stood by my
bedside, with looks of pity and forgiveness; and
<PB N="304" REF="305"/>
that Renaldo spoke peace to my despairing soul.
I heard the words distinctly: I retain them in
my memory. I saw the tears trickle from Se∣rafina's
eyes: I heard her father utter a com∣passionate
sigh; and should actually believe that
they were personally present, had not I long
ago seen with my own eyes, the funeral pro∣cession
of that young lady whose wrongs God
pardon; and were I not convinced that such a
meeting could not be effected without the im∣mediate
and miraculous interposition of heaven.
Yet every thing I now see, corresponds with the
words of Renaldo, which still sound in my ears.
When my perception forsook me, I lay in the
most abject misery, among straw; and thou,
poor injured innocence, wast naked and forlorn.
Now, I find myself reposed in a warm easy
comfortable bed: I see around me the marks
of human charity and care, and the favourable
change in thy appearance, glads my poor de∣jected
heart. Say, whence this happy altera∣tion?
Do I really wake from that dream of
misery in which we have continued so long?
or do I still utter the extravagant ravings of a
distemper'd brain?”</P>
<P>Elinor was afraid of imparting at once all
the particulars of the happy change he had un∣dergone,
lest they might leave a dangerous im∣pression
upon his fancy, which was not yet duly
composed: she contented herself, therefore, with
telling him that he had been obliged to the hu∣manity
of a gentleman and lady, who chanced
to pass that way by accident, and who under∣standing
his deplorable case, had furnished him
with the conveniencies which he now enjoyed:
<PB N="305" REF="306"/>
she then presented to him, what the doctor had
directed her to administer, and admonishing him
to commit his head to the pillow, he was fa∣voured
with a breathing sweat, fell fast asleep,
and in a few hours waked again altogether cool
and undisturbed.</P>
<P>It was upon this occasion that his wife ex∣plained
the circumstances of that visit which had
redeemed him from extremity of wretchedness
and the jaws of death; upon which, he started
up and throwing himself upon his knees, ex∣claimed,
“All gracious power! this was the
work of thy own bounteous hand; the voice of
my sorrow and repentance hath been heard. Thou
hast inspired my benefactors with more than mor∣tal
goodness, in my behalf; how shall I praise
thy name! how shall I requite their generosity!
O I am bankrupt to both! yet, let me not perish
until I shall have convinced them of my refor∣mation,
and seen them enjoying that felicity
which ought to be reserved for such consummate
virtue.”</P>
<P>Next day in the forenoon, he was visited by
the physician, whom he now recollected to have
seen at the house of madame Clement; and
after having thanked that gentleman for his hu∣manity
and care, he earnestly begged to know
by what means Serafina had been preserved.
When he was satisfied in this particular, and
given to understand that she was now happy
in the arms of Renaldo, “Blessed be God! (he
cried) for having defeated the villany of him who
sought to part such lovers. Dear sir, will you
add one circumstance to your charity, and bear
to that happy couple and the noble don Diego,
the respects and the remorse of a sincere penitent,
<PB N="306" REF="307"/>
whom their compassion hath raised to life. I
have been such a traitor to them, that my
words deserve no regard. I will not therefore
use professions. I dare not hope to be admit∣ted
into their presence. I am indeed, ashamed
to see the light of the sun: how then could I
bear the looks of that injured family! ah, no!
let me hide myself in some obscure retreat, where
I may work out my salvation with fear and trem∣bling,
and pray incessantly to heaven for their
prosperity.”</P>
<P>The physician promised to represent his con∣trition
to the count and his lady, and accord∣ingly
proceeded to their habitation, where he
repeated these expressions, and pronounced his
patient out of danger: so that their thoughts
were now employed in concerting a scheme for
his future subsistence, that he might not be ex∣posed
by indigence to a relapse in point of mo∣rals.
Renaldo being still averse to any personal
intercourse with such a wretch, until he should
give some undoubted proofs of amendment, and
as yet afraid of intrusting him with any office
that required integrity, resolved, with the appro∣bation
of all present, to settle him in a cheap
country in the north of England, where he and
his wife could live comfortably on an annuity of
sixty pounds, until his behaviour should intitle
him to a better provision.</P>
<P>This resolution was just taken, when Joshua
arrived with a gentleman whom he introduced to
don Diego as the secretary of the Spanish am∣bassador.
After the first compliments, this stran∣ger
told the Castilian, that he waited upon him
at the desire of his excellency, who would have
<PB N="307" REF="308"/>
come in person, had he not been confined by
the gout; then he put into his hand, a letter
from the court of Madrid, written by a noble∣man
of Diego's acquaintance, who informed him
that don Manuel de Mendoza having made away
with himself by poison, in order to avoid the
disgrace of a legal conviction, his catholic ma∣jesty
was now convinced of don Diego's inno∣cence,
and granted him leave to return and
take possession of his honours and estate. This
information was confirmed by the secretary, who
assured him that the ambassador had orders to
make him acquainted with this favourable de∣cision
of the king. The Castilian having first
acquitted himself in the most polite terms to the
secretary and the Jew who, he said, had always
been a messenger of glad tidings, communi∣cated
his happiness to the company; and this
evening concluded the third day of their re∣joicing.</P>
<P>Next morning, don Diego went to visit the
ambassador, accompanied by Joshua and the
secretary; while the physician repairing to the
habitation of Fathom, signified, by Renaldo's
direction, the resolution which had been taken
in his behalf; and the patient no sooner heard
his doom, than lifting up his hands, he cried,
“I am unworthy of such tenderness and bene∣volence:”
while Elinor shed a flood of tears in
silence, unable to give utterance to her grateful
thought: Melvile's bounty having so far tran∣scended
her most sanguine hope.</P>
<P>The Spaniard having paid his devoirs to his
excellency, returned before dinner; and, in the
afternoon, desiring a private conference with Se∣rafina,
<PB N="308" REF="309"/>
they retired into another apartment, and
he expressed himself to this effect. “You have
contracted, my dear child, an habit of calling
madame Clement your mother, and doubtless,
by her maternal tenderness and regard, she hath
acquired a just title to the appellation: yet, I
own, I would fain strengthen it by a legal claim.
I no sooner retrieved my daughter, than I gave
her away to the most deserving youth that ever
sighed with love. I rejoice in the gift which se∣cured
your happiness: but I left myself in a soli∣tary
situation which even the return of my good
fortune cannot render easy and supportable. When
I revisit the castle of Zelos, every well known
object will recal the memory of my Antonia, and I
shall want a companion to fill her place, and to
sympathize with me in that sorrow which will be
derived from my remembrance. Who is there
so worthy to succeed your mother in the affec∣tion
of Don Diego, as she who interests her love
for Serafina, and resembles her so strongly in every
virtue of the sex? similar attractions will produce
similar effects. My heart is already attached to
that good lady; and, provided Serafina shall ap∣prove
of my choice, I will lay myself and for∣tune
at her feet.”</P>
<P>The fair countess replied with an enchanting
smile, that, before this declaration, she had with
pleasure perceived the progress which madame
Clement had made in his heart; and that she did
not believe there was a person upon earth better
qualified to repair the loss he had sustained; tho'
she foresaw one obstacle to his happiness, which
she was afraid would not be easily surmounted.
“You mean,” answered the Castilian, “the
<PB N="309" REF="310"/>
difference of religion, which I am resolved to re∣move
by adopting the protestant faith; though I
am fully satisfied that real goodness is of no par∣ticular
persuasion, and that salvation cannot de∣pend
upon belief, over which the will has no in∣fluence.
I invest you therefore with the charge
of declaring my passion and proposal, and im∣power
you to satisfy her scruples with regard to
the religion which I now profess; and which I
shall not openly relinquish, until I shall have se∣cured
in this country, effects sufficient to screen
me from the ill consequences of my king's dis∣pleasure.”</P>
<P>Serafina undertook this office with pleasure,
because she had reason to think his addresses
would not be disagreeable to madame Clement;
and that same night made the count acquainted
with the nature of her commission. Nor was her
expectation disappointed: the French lady, with
that frankness which is peculiar to virtue and
good breeding, confessed that don Diego was not
indifferent to her choice, and did not hesitate in
receiving him upon the footing of a lover. As
we have already dwelt circumstantially on the
passion of love, so as perhaps even to have tired
our readers, we shall not repeat the dialogue that
passed, when the Spaniard was indulged with an
opportunity to explain his sentiments. Suffice it
to observe, that the lady's days of coquetry were
now over, and that she was too wise to trifle with
the time which every moment became more and
more precious. It was agreed then, that don
Diego should settle his affairs in Spain, and return
to England, in order to espouse madame Cle∣ment,
with a view to fix his residence in this
<PB N="310" REF="311"/>
island, where Renaldo likewise proposed to enjoy
the sweets of his fortune, provided he could draw
hither his interests and connexions.</P>
<P>Mean while, having for some days enjoyed his
bliss with all the fulness of rapture, amidst this
small but agreeable society, he shifted the scene,
and conducted his dear partner to a ready furnish∣ed
house in town, which, together with an occa∣sional
equipage, his friend Joshua had hired for
the accommodation of him and his father-in-law,
who during his stay in England, failed not
to cultivate the mistress of his heart, with the
most punctual assiduity. Hitherto Serafina had
been as a precious jewel locked up in a casket,
which the owner alone has an opportunity to
contemplate: but now the count, who was proud
of such a prize, resolved to let her shine forth to
the admiration of the whole world. With this
view, he bespoke such ornaments as befitted her
quality, and while the mantua-makers were em∣ployed
in her service, made a tour among his
former acquaintance, and discharged the obliga∣tions
under which he lay to some who had assisted
him in his distress. He did not, however, introduce
them to his charming Serafina; because not one
of them had formerly treated her with that deli∣cacy
of regard which he thought her due; and
some of them were much mortified at their neg∣lect,
when they saw what a dazzling figure she
made in the beau monde.</P>
<P>She was visited by the Spanish and Imperial
ambassadors, and divers other foreigners of dis∣tinction,
to whom Melvile had letters of recom∣mendation:
but her first public appearance was
in a box at the opera, accompanied by madame
<PB N="311" REF="312"/>
Clement, the count and don Diego: the enter∣tainment
was already begun, so that her entrance
had the greater effect upon the audience, whose
attention was soon detached from the perform∣ance,
and rivetted upon this amiable apparition,
which seemed to be some bright being of another
world dropt from the clouds among them. Then
did the spirit of curiosity play its part: a thousand
whispers circulated; as many glasses were exalt∣ed
to reconnoitre this box of foreigners; for such
they concluded them to be from their appearance.
Every male spectator acknowledged Serafina to be
the paragon of beauty; and every female confes∣sed,
that Melvile was the model of a fine gentle∣man.
The charms of the young countess did
not escape the eye and approbation of royalty it∣self;
and when her rank was known, from the
information of the ambassadors and other people of
condition who were seen saluting her at a distance,
that same evening a thousand bumpers were
swallowed in honour of the countess de Melvile.
The fame of her beauty was immediately extend∣ed
over this immense metropolis, and different
schemes were concerted for bringing her into
life. These, however, she resisted with un∣wearied
obstinacy. Her happiness centered in
Renaldo, and the cultivation of a few friends with∣in
the shade of domestic quiet: she did not even
forget the concerns of the wretched Fathom and
his faithful Elinor, who daily enjoyed fresh in∣stances
of her humanity and care: when his fever
forsook him, he was supplied with nourishing
food for the recovery of his health; and soon as
he found himself in a condition to travel, he gave
notice to his benefactor, who desired Joshua to
<PB N="312" REF="313"/>
settle with him the manner in which he was to
receive his allowance, and to pay the first half
year's salary per advance.</P>
<P>This affair being adjusted, and the place of his
retreat signified, the Jew told Elinor, that she
might wait upon the countess before their depar∣ture;
and she did not fail to make use of this per∣mission.
After they had made the necessary pre∣parations
for their journey, and taken places in the
York stage-coach, Mrs. Fathom, cloathing her∣self
in decent apparel, went to the house of count
Melvile, and was immediately admitted to the
presence of Serafina, who received her with her
usual complacency, enriched her with salutary ad∣vice,
comforted her with hope of better things, pro∣vided
her conduct and that of her husband should
henceforth be found irreproachable; and wishing
her peace and happiness, presented her with a
box of linen, and twenty guineas in a purse.
Such excessive goodness overpowered this sensible
young woman to such a degree, that she stood
before her in speechless awe and veneration; and
the countess, in order to relieve her from the con∣fusion
under which she suffered, quitted the room,
leaving her to the care of her woman. It was
not long, however, before her gratitude broke
out in loud exclamations and a violent passion
of tears, which all her efforts could not, for a
good while, overcome. By this time the coach
was brought up to the gate, for the reception of
Serafina, who took an airing every day at the
same hour; when Renaldo, leading her to the
vehicle, beheld a man plainly dressed standing
within the court, with his head and body bent
<PB N="313" REF="314"/>
towards the earth, so that his countenance could
not be perceived.</P>
<P>Melvile, who supposed him to be some unfor∣tunate
man come to implore his charity, turned
towards him, and asked, with a humane accent, if
he wanted to speak with any person in the house?
To this interrogation the stranger replied, without
lifting up his head, “Overwhelmed as I am with
count Melvile's generosity, together with a con∣sciousness
of my own unworthiness, it ill becomes
a wretch like me to importune him for further
favour; yet I could not bear the thought of with∣drawing
(perhaps for ever) from the presence of
my benefactor, without solliciting his permission
to see his face in mercy, to acknowledge my at∣trocious
crimes, to hear my pardon confirmed by
his voice, and that of his accomplished countess,
whom I dare not even at a distance behold;
and to express my fervent wish for their prospe∣rity.”</P>
<P>Melvile, whose heart was but too tender,
could not hear this address without emotion:
he recognized the companion of his infancy and
youth; he remembred the happy scenes he had
enjoyed with Fathom, whose voice had always such
an effect upon his ear, as to excite the ideas of
friendship and esteem; and he was disturbed by
this unexpected meeting, which also discomposed
the beauteous Serafina. Renaldo having paused a
little, “It is with pain,” said he, “I recollect
any thing to the prejudice of Fathom, whose fu∣ture
behaviour will, I hope, eraze the memory
of his offences, and justify what other steps I may
take in his favour. Mean while I heartily for∣give
what is past; and, in token of my sinceri∣ty,
<PB N="314" REF="315"/>
present my hand;” which our adventurer
bathed with his tears. The countess, whose
mind was unison with her husband, repeated her
assurances of pardon and protection; at which
the penitent rejoiced in silence, while he raised
his head and took a parting view of those charms
which had formerly enslaved his heart.</P>
<P>Having thus obeyed the dictates of his duty and
inclination, he next morning embarked in the
stage-coach, with his faithful Elinor, and in six
days arrived at the place of his retreat, which he
found extremely well adapted to the circumstances
of his mind and fortune: for all his vice and am∣bition
was now quite mortified within him, and
his whole attention engrossed in atoning for his
former crimes, by a sober and penitent life, by
which alone he could deserve the uncommon ge∣nerosity
of his patrons.</P>
<P>While he thus accommodated himself to his
new system, Renaldo received letters of congra∣tulation
from his sister, who with the major had
come to Brussels, in order to meet her brother
and Serafina, according to his proposal. This
intimation being communicated to don Diego,
he resolved to accompany them to Flanders, in his
way to Spain. Preparations were made for their
departure; the clergyman and physician were
honoured with valuable marks of friendship and
esteem from the countess, Renaldo, and the Cas∣tilian,
who were convoyed to Deal by madame
Clement, to whom, at parting, don Diego pre∣sented
a diamond ring, as a pledge of his inviolable
love.</P>
<P>Here the travellers hired a vessel for Ostend,
which they reached in a few hours; in two days
<PB N="315" REF="316"/>
more they arrived at Brussels, where mrs. Farrel
and her husband were struck with admiration at
the surprizing beauty and accomplishment of their
sister-in-law, whom they caressed with equal ten∣derness
and joy.—In a word, all parties were as
happy as good fortune could make them; and
don Diego set out for Spain, after they had
agreed to reside in the Low Countries 'till his
return.</P>
