<HEAD>THE Judgment of <HI>Hercules,</HI> A POEM. <HI>To Mr.</HI> LYTTELTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE blooming Spring descends from genial Skies,</L>
<L>By whose mild Influence instant Wonders rise;</L>
<L>From whose soft Breath <HI>Elysian</HI> Beauties flow;</L>
<L>The Sweets of HAGLEY, or the Pride of STOWE;</L>
<L>Will LYTTELTON the rural Landskip range,</L>
<L>Leave noisy Fame, and not regret the Change?</L>
<L>Pleas'd will He tread the Garden's early Scenes,</L>
<L>And learn a <HI>Moral</HI> from the rising Greens?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
There, warm'd alike by <HI>Sol</HI>'s enliv'ning Pow'r,</L>
<L>The Weed, aspiring, emulates the Flow'r:</L>
<L>The drooping Flow'r, its fairer Charms display'd,</L>
<L>Invites, from grateful Hands, their gen'rous Aid:</L>
<L>Soon, if none check th' <HI>invasive Foe</HI>'s Designs,</L>
<L>The lively Lustre of these Scenes declines!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis thus, the <HI>Spring</HI> of Youth, the <HI>Morn</HI> of Life,</L>
<L>Rears in our Minds the rival Seeds of Strife.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Passion</HI> riots, <HI>Reason</HI> then contends;</L>
<L>And, on the Conquest, ev'ry Bliss depends:</L>
<L>Life, from the nice Decision, takes its Hue:</L>
<L>And blest those Judges who decide like You!</L>
<L>On Worth like theirs shall ev'ry Bliss attend:</L>
<L>The World their Fav'rite, and the World their Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There <HI>are,</HI> who blind to Thought's fatiguing Ray,</L>
<L>As <HI>Fortune</HI> gives Examples, urge their Way:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Not <HI>Virtue</HI>'s Foes, tho' they her Paths decline,</L>
<L>And scarce her Friends, tho' with her Friends they join;</L>
<L>In Her's, or <HI>Vice</HI>'s casual Road advance</L>
<L>Thoughtless, the Sinners or the Saints of Chance!</L>
<L>Yet some more nobly scorn the vulgar Voice;</L>
<L>With Judgment fix, with Zeal pursue their Choice,</L>
<L>When ripen'd Thought, when <HI>Reason</HI> born to reign,</L>
<L>Checks the wild Tumults of the youthful Vein;</L>
<L>While <HI>Passion</HI>'s lawless Tides, at <HI>their</HI> Command,</L>
<L>Glide thro' more useful Tracts, and bless the Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Happiest of <HI>These</HI> is HE whose matchless Mind,</L>
<L>By Learning strengthen'd, and by Taste refin'd,</L>
<L>In <HI>Virtue</HI>'s Cause essay'd its earliest Pow'rs;</L>
<L>Chose <HI>Virtue</HI>'s Paths, and strew'd her Paths with Flow'rs.</L>
<L>The first alarm'd, if <HI>Freedom</HI> waves her Wings:</L>
<L>The fittest to adorn each Art <HI>she</HI> brings:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Lov'd by that Prince whom ev'ry Virtue fires:</L>
<L>Prais'd by that Bard whom ev'ry Muse inspires:</L>
<L>Blest in the tuneful Art, the social Flame;</L>
<L>In all that wins, in all that merits Fame!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas Youth's perplexing Stage his Doubts in∣spir'd,</L>
<L>When great <HI>Alcides</HI> to a Grove retir'd.</L>
<L>Thro' the lone Windings of a devious Glade,</L>
<L>Resign'd to Thought, with ling'ring Steps He stray'd;</L>
<L>Blest with a Mind to taste sincerer Joys:</L>
<L>Arm'd with a Heart each false one to despise.</L>
<L>Dubious He stray'd, with wav'ring Thoughts possest</L>
<L>Alternate Passions struggling shar'd his Breast;</L>
<L>The various Arts which human Cares divide,</L>
<L>In deep Attention all his Mind employ'd:</L>
<L>Anxious, if <HI>Fame</HI> an equal Bliss secur'd;</L>
<L>Or silent <HI>Ease</HI> with softer Charms allur'd.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
The silvan Choir whose Numbers sweetly flow'd,</L>
<L>The Fount that murmur'd, and the Flow'rs that blow'd;</L>
<L>The silver <HI>Flood</HI> that in Meanders led</L>
<L>His glitt'ring Streams along th' enliven'd Mead;</L>
<L>The soothing Breeze, and all those Beauties join'd,</L>
<L>Which, whilst they please, effeminate the Mind.</L>
<L>In vain! while distant, on a Summit rais'd,</L>
<L>Th' imperial Tow'rs of <HI>Fame</HI> attractive blaz'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus He trac'd thro' Fancy's puzzling Maze</L>
<L>The sep'rate Sweets of Pleasure, and of Praise;</L>
<L>Sudden the Wind a fragrant Gale convey'd,</L>
<L>And a new Lustre gain'd upon the Shade.</L>
<L>At once, before his wond'ring Eyes were seen</L>
<L>Two female <HI>Forms,</HI> of more than mortal Mien.</L>
<L>Various their Charms; and, in their Dress and Face,</L>
<L>Each seem'd to vie with with some <HI>peculiar</HI> Grace.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HI>This,</HI> whose Attire less clogg'd with Art appear'd,</L>
<L>The simple Sweets of Innocence endear'd.</L>
<L>Her sprightly Bloom, her quick sagacious Eye,</L>
<L>Shew'd native Merit mix'd with Modesty.</L>
<L>Her Air diffus'd a mild yet awful Ray,</L>
<L>Severely sweet, and innocently gay:</L>
<L>Such the chaste Image of the <HI>martial Maid,</HI></L>
<L>In artless Folds of virgin White array'd!</L>
<L>She let no borrow'd Rose her Cheeks adorn,</L>
<L>Her blushing Cheeks, that sham'd the purple Morn.</L>
<L>Her Charms nor <HI>had,</HI> nor <HI>wanted</HI> artful Foils,</L>
<L>Or study'd Gestures, or well-practis'd Smiles.</L>
<L>She scorn'd the Toys which render Beauty less;</L>
<L>She prov'd th'engaging Chastity of Dress;</L>
<L>And while She chose in native Charms to shine,</L>
<L>Ev'n thus She seem'd, nay more than seem'd, divine.</L>
<L>One modest Em'rald clasp'd the Robe She wore,</L>
<L>And, in her Hand, th' <HI>imperial Sword</HI> She bore.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Sublime her Height, majestic was her Pace,</L>
<L>And match'd the awful Honours of her Face.</L>
<L>The Shrubs, the Flow'rs, that deck'd the verdan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ground,</L>
<L>Seem'd, where She trod, with rising Lustre crown'd.</L>
<L>Still her Approach with stronger Influence warm'd;</L>
<L>She <HI>pleas'd,</HI> while distant, but, when near, She <HI>charm'd,</HI></L>
<L>So strikes the Gazer's Eye, the silver Gleam</L>
<L>That glitt'ring quivers o'er a distant Stream:</L>
<L>But from its Banks we see new Beauties rise,</L>
<L>And, in its crystal Bosom, trace the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With other Charms the Rival Vision glow'd;</L>
<L>And from her Dress <HI>her</HI> tinsel Beauties flow'd.</L>
<L>A flutt'ring Robe her pamper'd Shape conceal'd,</L>
<L>And seem'd to shade the Charms it <HI>best</HI> reveal'd.</L>
<L>Its Form, contriv'd her faulty Size to grace;</L>
<L>Its Hue, to give fresh Lustre to her Face.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Her plaited Hair disguis'd with <HI>Brilliants</HI> glar'd;</L>
<L>Her Cheeks the <HI>Ruby</HI>'s neighb'ring Lustre shar'd;</L>
<L>The gawdy <HI>Topaz</HI> lent its gay Supplies,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Gem that strikes less curious Eyes;</L>
<L>Expos'd her Breast with <HI>foreign</HI> Sweets perfum'd;</L>
<L>And, round her Brow, a roseate Garland bloom'd.</L>
<L>Soft-smiling, blushing Lips conceal'd her Wiles;</L>
<L>Yet ah! the Blushes <HI>artful</HI> as the Smiles.</L>
<L>Oft-gazing on her Shade, th' enraptur'd Fair</L>
<L>Decreed the <HI>Substance</HI> well deserv'd her Care:</L>
<L>Her Thoughts, to other's Charms malignly blind,</L>
<L>Center'd in <HI>that,</HI> and were to <HI>that</HI> confin'd;</L>
<L>And if on other's Eyes a Glance were thrown,</L>
<L>'Twas but to watch the Influence of her own.</L>
<L>Much like her <HI>Guardian,</HI> fair <HI>Cythera</HI>'s Queen,</L>
<L>When for her <HI>Warrior</HI> she refines her Mien;</L>
<L>Or when, to bless her <HI>Delian Fav'rite</HI>'s Arms,</L>
<L>The radiant Fair invigorates her Charms.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Much like her Pupil, <HI>Egypt</HI>'s sportive Dame,</L>
<L>Her Dress expressive, and her Air the same,</L>
<L>When her gay Bark o'er silver <HI>Cydnos</HI> roll'd,</L>
<L>And all th' emblazon'd Streamers wav'd in Gold.</L>
<L>Such shone the Vision; nor forbore, to move,</L>
<L>The fond contagious Airs of lawless Love.</L>
<L>Each wanton Eye deluding Glances fir'd,</L>
<L>And am'rous Dimples on each Cheek conspir'd.</L>
<L>Lifeless her Gait, and slow, with seeming Pain,</L>
<L>She dragg'd her loitering Limbs along the Plain;</L>
<L>Yet made some faint Efforts, and first approach'd the Swain.</L>
<L>So glaring <HI>Draughts,</HI> with tawdry Lustre bright,</L>
<L>Spring to the View, and rush upon the Sight:</L>
<L>More slowly charms a <HI>Raphael</HI>'s chaster Air,</L>
<L>Waits the calm Search, and pays the Searcher's Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wrapt in a pleas'd Suspense, the Youth survey'd</L>
<L>The various Charms of each attractive Maid:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Alternate each He view'd, and each admir'd,</L>
<L>And found, alternate, varying Flames inspir'd.</L>
<L>Quick o'er their Forms his Eyes with Pleasure ran,</L>
<L>When She, who first approach'd him, first began.</L>

<LG>
<L>"Hither, dear Boy, direct thy wand'ring Eyes;</L>
<L>'Tis here the lovely Vale of <HI>Pleasure</HI> lies.</L>
<L>Debate no more, to Me thy Life resign;</L>

<L>For me the Nymph diversifies her Pow'r,</L>
<L>Springs in a Tree, or blossoms in a Flow'r;</L>
<L>To please my Ear, she tunes the Linnet's Strains;</L>
<L>To please my Eye, with Lilies paints the Plains;</L>
<L>To form my Couch, in mossy Beds She grows;</L>
<L>To gratify my Smell, perfumes the Rose;</L>

<L>Their beauteous Cheeks a fairer Rose shall wear,</L>

Whilst, with each Accent, sweetest Odours flow;</L>

<L>Indulgent <HI>Bacchus</HI> loads his lab'ring Tree,</L>
