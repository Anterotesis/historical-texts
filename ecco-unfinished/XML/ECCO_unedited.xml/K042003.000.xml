<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE, GEORGE EARL of <HI>CARDIGAN</HI>, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ENcourag'd by Your Lordship's Permission, I presume to in∣scribe Your Name to the fol∣lowing Sheets. The Author of them, Sir <HI>Richard Bulstrode</HI>, was descended from a very ancient Family, to an Heiress of which one of Your Lord∣ship's Ancestors was marry'd, and the <HI>Bulstrodes</HI> now living have Reason to
<PB REF="3"/>
acknowledge it, as they do, to be no small Honour to them, that the Earl of CARDIGAN quarters their Arms.</P>
<P>My Lord, it would be next to im∣pertinent to tell the World what they sufficiently know already; that Your Lordship derives Your Descent from a Race truly Noble, as well for the Length of their Duration, as for the Honours our Kings, in Reward of their Services, at several times conferr'd on them. They have for many Ages been Great in Title, and Good a∣bove Greatness. Their Inclinations and Endeavours were the general Good of Mankind: They delighted in obliging others, and were pleas'd to see them pleas'd with their Bounty: They have been renown'd for relie∣ving Merit in Want, and for succou∣ring Vertue in Distress.</P>
<P>These and many other Vertues seem an Inheritance in Your Lordship, and deriv'd from Your Ancestors with Your Blood. My Lord, I cannot be
<PB REF="4"/>
guilty of Flattery if I would, nor needs there any Trial of Skill to shew how I can praise: Nature has done it to my Hands, and represented fai∣rer Ideas than I can describe: She has endow'd You with all her Blessings; with a Gracefulness of Person, Ex∣cellence of Understanding, Largeness of Heart, with Integrity, and Justice of Principles, with Humanity, Affa∣bility, and many other Qualities, far above my Description, and that would secure me from the Censure of Flat∣tery, even though I should launch into a Panegyrick.</P>
<P>Fortune too, my Lord, in your Regard, has been more wise than u∣sual: for she frequently honours and enriches others to her own Disgrace; but she participates in the Praise, and commends her own Wisdom, in what she has bestow'd on Your Lordship: Wealth is of some Value in Your Hands; and so good an Use is made of Your great Estate, that even Envy
<PB REF="5"/>
does not wish it less. Be pleas'd, my Lord, to give me leave to speak to You in the Words of <HI>Horace</HI>, which are so justly applicable to Your Lordship.</P>
<Q><L>Non Tu Corpus eras sine Pectore: Dii Tibi Formam,</L>
<L><HI>Dii Tibi Divitias dederunt</HI>, artemque fruendi.</L></Q>
<P>But I come to beg Protection, not to give Praise: And my greatest Am∣bition, which I beseech Your Lord∣ship to pardon, is, to subscribe my self, with the most profound Sub∣mission and Respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your Lordship's most humble, and most obedient Servant</HI>, E. BYSSHE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE most of the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have been engag'd in Wars, how dif∣ficult it has been to come at the true Knowledge of publick Occurrences, is evident from the different Relations, that have been given us of them; one would al∣most think, that we had not only engag'd in Leagues and Confederacies against one ano∣ther, but that all of us in general were en∣ter'd into one Grand Alliance, and had una∣nimously declar'd War against the Truth of History: So artfully disingenuous have we shewn our selves in extenuating, disguising, and concealing our own Losses, and in mag∣nifying, misrepresenting, and publishing those of the adverse Party. Had the Common Ene∣my been seven Years ago brought to that low Condition, to which it was then industriously given out that he was, when it was even
<PB REF="7"/>
made a Mark of Disaffection to suggest or believe the contrary, we should not at this Day be thus divided in Opinion concerning a safe and honourable Peace, nor perplex'd with the Uncertainty, whether it were best to en∣ter into a Treaty upon the Preliminaries now offer'd us.</P>
<P>But this Misrepresentation of the true Po∣sture of Affairs may be so far indulg'd and excus'd, in that it may in some Measure pro∣ceed from a political Reason of State; eve∣ry Potentate concern'd being desirous, nay, deeming it of absolute Necessity, to keep up the almost dejected Hearts of their dispirited Vassals, and to inspire them with fresh Cou∣rage, by giving them every Year repeated Hopes of a speedy End of this bloody, expen∣sive, and consequently destructive War. This, perhaps, may have been the chief Reason, for I can discover no other, that may have induc'd some of the Princes, who are now engag'd in Arms, to connive at the great number of scurrilous lying Pamphlets, as well News-Papers as others, and to permit them to be publish'd and spread abroad through∣out all their Dominions, impunibly and with∣out the least Controul. I have observ'd, and any one who has read the Relations they have given us, with the least, that is, with more Attention than they deserve, may have done so too, that all the Actions, which, du∣ring
<PB REF="8"/>
the whole Course of this War, have hap∣pen'd between the Armies abroad, have been related in the same manner, nay, almost in the same Words. So miserably are these pi∣tiful. Scriblers put to their shifts for new Words, and a fresh manner of Lying, to fill up the length of their Papers. With them, the beaten Party is very modest if he lay not Claim to the Victory, or at least to a drawn Battel; for, excepting in the Battels of <HI>Landen</HI> and <HI>Turin</HI>, where, the Advantages were so great as to strike the Eyes of the most Incredulous, and to leave scarce any Room for Disguise, he has always kill'd as many of the Enemies, as he lost of his own Troops; or else he came off with little Loss, and made his Retreat in good Order: Be∣sides, were his Loss ever so great, he has daily found it to be less than it was at first reported, by reason of the great Number of Soldiers that had been given over for kill'd or taken, but were continually coming back to the Camp. On the other Hand, he, who got the better of the Day, has never failed to magnify his Advantages proportionably: He has routed his Enemies to that Degree, that, as we were told, we had reason to believe, they would never be able to recruit their Armies, nor ever more shew their Fa∣ces in a Camp. To this wretched Plight have our Enemies been reduc'd at the end of
<PB REF="9"/>
several Campaigns; and yet the succeeding Spring has beheld this <HI>Hydra</HI>, with two Heads sprouted out in the room of one that was cut off; and we have met in the Field a more terrible Monster to encounter. Their Narratives of other Matters of Fact are of the like Stamp, and I appeal to any impar∣tial Person what Credit is to be given to them. The Governments themselves have, no doubt, had more authentick Advices; tho', as I hinted before, they have, for certain Rea∣sons of State, suffer'd these Impositions to be <HI>Post-Man'd</HI> and <HI>Post-Boy'd</HI> upon the Pub∣lick. And with this Encouragement these im∣perfect and lying Relations are bungled and patch'd up together, and pass currently with some, for what they falsely and scandalously call themselves, <HI>The Annals of the Reigns of our Sovereigns</HI>. But these impudent News-Writers stop not here, for they presume to intrude into the Councils and Cabinets of Princes, and give the World an Account of what passes, and is resolv'd on there, as well in regard to our own Affairs as those of Fo∣reign States. An Insolence without Exam∣ple, 'till of late Days.</P>
<P>Now, that the following Letters may not be thought to deserve as little Credit as the Relations of which I have been speaking; and that too the rather, because they treat of Affairs of the same Nature; it will be
<PB REF="10"/>
necessary to premise, in a few Words, what they contain, and by whom, as well as to whom they were written.</P>
<P>First then, They were written in the Year <HI>1674</HI>, all of them, except two to Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI>, to the Earl of <HI>Arlington</HI>, then Secretary of State, by Sir <HI>Richard Bulstrode</HI>, who then resided at the Court of <HI>Bruxelles</HI>, as Agent for King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and they contain the History of all the remarkable Transactions in the Low Countries, in <HI>Al∣satia</HI> and <HI>Burgundy</HI>, during the Campaign of that Year, when the <HI>Imperialists, Spaniards</HI>, and <HI>Dutch</HI> were engag'd in War against the <HI>French</HI>. This was that Campaign in which was fought the memorable Battel of <HI>Seneff</HI>, between the Confederates under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, and the Army of <HI>France</HI> commanded by the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> which I chuse particularly to mention, that the Reader may take notice, that it is no new Custom for both Sides to ascribe to themselves the Honour of the Victory; for they did so even then, and made Rejoicings too every where for it. These Letters evidently shew to which side it inclin'd, and whoever reads them will, I believe, be of Opinion, that this Relation of that Battel is the only impartial and true Account of it, that is yet any where extant. We may affirm the same too of the other Oc∣currences that are here related; as of the
<PB REF="11"/>
Account of the Battel that happen'd the same Year on the Banks of the <HI>Neckar</HI>, between the <HI>Imperialists</HI> and the <HI>French;</HI> the first of them commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, the last by Marshal <HI>Turenne;</HI> and also of the several Sieges, and other military Exploits of that Campaign; together, with all the secret Cabals and Intrigues of the then Court of <HI>Brussels;</HI> all which is the Subject of these Letters, which are written with such an Air of Candour, Integrity, and Impartiality, as plainly evinces them to be authentick, and would in a manner command our Belief, e∣ven tho' we were ignorant of the Author.</P>
<P>As for the Style in which they are written, it is purely Epistolatory, such as one Gentleman writes off-hand to another, and such as best becomes Composures of this Nature, when they are written as they ought to be: For they require not elaborate Elegancies, but should have only a native Clearness and Bre∣vity; they should not consist of fulsome Com∣pliments, but should have a respectful kind of Plainness and Familiarity, to affect only the Humour of those to whom they are inten∣ded. In Letters like these, the Souls of Men should appear undress'd, and in a negli∣gent Habit, not trick'd up with artful Gaw∣deries, or the study'd Ornaments of Rheto∣rick; and such I dare affirm the following Letters to be.</P>
<P><PB REF="12"/>As for the submissive Expressions the Au∣thor uses in the Conclusion of his Letters, as that of <HI>Laying my self low at your Lord∣ship's Feet with all Zeal and Humility</HI>, it was a Compliment us'd by Gentlemen of the best Quality, one towards another in those Times, tho' now laid aside; nay, I cou'd give Instances of Subscriptions more humble and abject in the Letters of several Envoys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> some of whom are now living, than are to be found any where in our Author.</P>
<P>It will be necessary, in the next Place, to give some Account of our Author, that may serve rather for the Information of his Rea∣ders, than for the Increase of his Fame, which stands not in need of any such Helps to establish it.</P>
<P>He was descended of the ancient Family of <HI>Bulstrode</HI>, in the County of <HI>Bucks</HI>. Their first Name was <HI>Shobbington</HI>, and came to be chang'd into that of <HI>Bulstrode</HI> by this re∣markable Adventure, which I have learn'd from some of the Family themselves. The Story, as they report it, runs thus. When <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror had subdu'd this Kingdom to his Obedience, he granted the E∣state of the <HI>Shobbington</HI>'s, whose capital Seat, now likewise call'd <HI>Bulstrode</HI>'s, was situa∣ted in the middle of a fine Park, by <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Cross near <HI>Beaconsfield</HI>, and had been in their Family for several Ages before, to a certain
<PB REF="13"/>
<HI>Norman</HI> Lord who came over with him: of which the <HI>Shobbington</HI>, who then enjoy'd it, having notice, he resolv'd rather to die upon the Spot, than tamely to suffer himself to be turn'd out of Possession of that Inheritance, which had descended to him from his Ance∣stors. In this Resolution he arm'd his Ser∣vants and his Tenants, whose Number was very considerable. Upon which the <HI>Norman</HI> Lord, who had Advice of it, obtain'd of the King a thousand of his Regular Troops, to help him to take Possession of the Estate by Force: whereupon <HI>Shobbington</HI> apply'd him∣self to his Relations and Neighbours to assist him; and the two ancient Families of the <HI>Hambden</HI>'s and <HI>Penn</HI>'s took Arms, together with their Servants and Tenants, and came to his Relief. When they were all joyn'd, they cast up Works, whose Remains appear to this Day, in the Place where the Park now is; and the <HI>Norman</HI> Lord, with his Forces, came and encamp'd before their Intrench∣ments. Now whether it were that they wanted Horses, or not, is uncertain; but the Story goes, That having manag'd a par∣cel of Bulls, they mounted them, and sally∣ing out of their Intrenchments in the Night, surpriz'd the <HI>Normans</HI> in their Camp, kill'd many of them, and put the rest to Flight. The King having Intelligence of it, and not thinking it safe for him, while his
<PB REF="14"/>
Power was yet new and unsettled, to drive a daring and obstinate People to Despair, sent a Herald to them, to know what they would have, and promis'd <HI>Shobbington</HI> a Safe Con∣duct, if he would come to Court; which <HI>Shobbington</HI> accordingly did, riding thither upon a Bull. Being introduc'd into the Royal Presence, the King ask'd him his Demands, and why he alone dar'd to resist, when the rest of the Kingdom had submitted to his Go∣vernment, and own'd him for their Sove∣reign? <HI>Shobbington</HI> answer'd, That he and his Ancestors had long been Inhabitants of this Island, and had enjoy'd that Estate for many Years; that if the King would permit him to keep it, he would become his Subject, and be faithful to him, as he had been to his Predecessors. The King gave him his Royal Word, that he would, and immediately grant∣ed him the free Enjoyment of his Estate: Upon which the Family was from thence call'd <HI>Shobbington, aliàs Bulstrode;</HI> but in Process of Time the first Name was discon∣tinued, and that of <HI>Bulstrode</HI> only has re∣main'd to them. The Truth of this Story is not only confirm'd by long Tradition in the Family, but by several Memoirs which they have still remaining, and by the Ruins of the Works, that are to this Day seen in the Park of <HI>Bulstrodes</HI>, as well as by the Crest of their Arms, which is, <HI>a Bull's Head caboss'd
<PB REF="15"/>
Gules, attir'd Or, between two Wings Sa∣ble</HI>. The Estate of <HI>Bulstrodes</HI> remain'd in, and continu'd to be, the Seat of the Family, till about forty Years ago, when it was first sold, and has since pass'd through several Hands. The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> now enjoys it by Inheritance from his Father, who was the last that purchas'd it. But to return to our Author.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Bulstrode</HI> was born in the Year of our Lord <HI>1610</HI>. He was the el∣dest Son of <HI>Edward Bulstrode</HI> of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a very learned Lawyer, as ap∣pears by his Book <HI>of Reports</HI>, a Work in great Esteem to this Day. The first Years of his Youth were, as usual, spent at School; whence he was remov'd to <HI>Pembroke</HI> Hall in <HI>Cambridge</HI>, where he continu'd his Stu∣dies for several Years. In <HI>1633</HI>, being then about twenty three Years of Age, he writ a Poem on the Birth of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>, which is still extant in the Collections of the Poems of that University. From <HI>Cambridge</HI> he went to the Inns of Court, and was en∣ter'd in the same House with his Father. He became a Barrister at Law, and pra∣ctis'd as such till the breaking out of the Civil Wars, when his Affection to the King's Cause made him quit the Gown, and drew him to the Army; where he behav'd himself with so much Prudence, Bravery, and Con∣duct,
<PB REF="16"/>
that King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>1<SUP>st</SUP></HI> soon made him Adjutant General of his Army, and af∣terwards Quarter-Master General; in which Post he continued to serve till the disbanding of the King's Forces at <HI>Truro</HI>.</P>
<P>When that unnatural Rebellion was ended, and King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2<SUP>d</SUP></HI> happily restor'd, our Author after some Years Atten∣dance on the Court, and being now above sixty years of Age, was at length, in Reward of his long and faithful Services to the Crown, sent to reside at <HI>Brussels</HI> in Quality of Agent for that Prince; and from thence he writ these Letters, with which we here present the Publick.</P>
<P>In the Year <HI>1675.</HI> he return'd to <HI>England</HI> to give the King an Account of his Negotia∣tions, with which his Majesty was so well sa∣tisfy'd, that he conferr'd on him the Honour of Knighthood, and in a few Months sent him back again to that Court with the Cha∣racter of his Resident there. This is confirm'd by the Credential Letters, which the King writ in his behalf to the Duke <HI>de Villa Her∣mosa</HI>, then Governour General of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI>, and which are as follows.</P>

<PB REF="21"/>
being a hundred and one Years old and two Months.</P>
<P>He was twice marry'd: His first Wife was Daughter of <HI>Edward Dineley</HI> of <HI>Charl∣ton</HI>, near <HI>Evesham</HI>, in the County of <HI>Worce∣ster</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>, and Sister to Sir <HI>Edward Dineley</HI> lately deceas'd: By her he had two Sons, who are both living. <HI>Whitlock Bulstrode</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the youngest of them, a Barrister at Law, is now one of the Commissioners of Excise. And this honourable Gentleman gives me leave to assure the Publick, that he has seen the Ori∣ginals of these Letters, and knows them to be his Father Sir <HI>Richard Bulstrode</HI>'s own Hand-writing: which ought to be Satisfa∣ction enough to the World that they are genu∣ine, and render it needless to give any Ac∣count how we came by them.</P>
<P>His second Wife was Daughter of M. <HI>Stam∣ford</HI>, who was Envoy to the Court of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI>, now Ele∣ctor <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI>. By her he has left behind him three Sons and four Daugh∣ters, several of whom are under twenty years of Age; but his eldest Son now living, whom he had by his former Wife, is Sixty one and upwards.</P>
<P>He enjoy'd a wonderful Firmness of Mind and Strength of Body to the very last. After he was fourscore Years old and more, he would often walk twelve Miles in a Morning,
<PB REF="22"/>
and study as many Hours in a Day. And tho' it may seem a Paradox, old tho' he was, it cannot strictly be said, that he dy'd of old Age: The Disease that carry'd him off, was a Stoppage at his Stomach, caus'd by an In∣digestion: Nevertheless had proper Remedies been apply'd, he might, in all probability, have worn out several Years longer: But his Physician, who understood his Constitution, being out of the way, those that were sent for to his Relief, durst not, by reason of his Age, give him a Vomit; the want of which, 'tis thought, hasten'd his End.</P>
<P>He was accomplsh'd with all manner of Abilities for the greatest Business: He per∣fectly understood the Interests of Princes, and the Arts and Intriegues of Courts, and often transacted Affairs of the utmost Importance: In all which he ever behav'd himself with in∣defatigable Integrity, and unsuspected Secrecy. And certainly his Conduct must have been ve∣ry unblameable, which had been try'd in Bu∣siness of the highest Consequence, and pra∣ctis'd in the hazardous Secrets of Courts and Cabinets, and yet nothing disgraceful was ever alledg'd against it.</P>
<P>He was throughly acquainted with the an∣cient and the modern Languages, and had been very conversant in the Lecture of the best Authors; which he not only retain'd in

his Memory, but had digested likewise in his Judgment. With these Advantages he left behind him several Treatises of his own com∣posing; as the Lives of his three Masters, King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>1<SUP>st</SUP></HI>, King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2<SUP>d</SUP></HI>, and King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2<SUP>d</SUP></HI>, and Essays on seve∣ral Subjects; with all which we hope to oblige the Publick in a short time; none of them having yet seen the Light, except the Life of King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2<SUP>d</SUP></HI>, which has been lately printed at <HI>Rome</HI>. His Essays are ve∣ry much commended by judicious Persons to whom he had shewn them in his Life-time: He design'd them for the Press, and we ex∣pect that they will e'er long be transmitted hither for that purpose.</P>
<P>When he was above eighty Years of Age he compos'd in Latin Verse <HI>185</HI>, as well Ele∣gies as Epigrams, all of them on divine Sub∣jects. Those likewise he intended to be prin∣ted, and some time before his Death, sent them over to his Son, <HI>Whitlock Bulstrode</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for that purpose: But this worthy Gentleman, reflecting with good Reason, that a Book of Divine Poems would perhaps agree but ill with the Temper of the present Age, which seems to delight more in War, than in Piety, has hitherto kept them to himself, and reserves them for a more favourable Opportu∣nity. However to give the World a Taste of
<PB REF="24"/>
them, as well as of his Essays, we have here, till they are publish'd together in one Volume, subjoin'd some of those Poems, together with a Letter, which, a few Years ago, he writ to his above-mention'd Son, on the Subject of Retirement: And thus we conclude this short Account of our Author.</P>

<HEAD>An <HI>EXTRACT</HI> of a <HI>Letter</HI> to his Son concerning <HI>RETIREMENT</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>AS to what you have thought upon, and desire my Advice in, it is indeed one of the most difficult things a Man can do; for this solitary Entertainment of our selves, is either one of the best, or the worst things we can undertake. He that will withdraw himself must first prepare to receive himself. It is not Wisdom to o∣verdrive Nature, which is to draw a Blemish upon our Judgment. Men that retire should first examine the Difficulty of the Enterprize; for without this prelimi∣nary Prudence a Man may overburthen his Shoulders, and soon wade out of depth; and it is to many better in Prospect than in Possession. It is indeed no such ea∣sy matter as many Men believe, to make a safe Retreat from the World, to truss up our Baggage, and bid our Company farewel; this is a Burthen which few Men can take up handsomely. For a Man to leave off all Bu∣siness, to anticipate the Accidents of Fortune, to deprive himself of his present Advantages, to place himself up∣on the lowest Step in this World, thereby to secure himself from falling, is an Action of extream Difficulty, as well as of an extraordinary Vertue. Neither is it enough only to separate our selves from the Converse of Peo∣ple, for tho' we have freed our selves from Business, from the Court, from <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall, yet we are not thereby free from the principal Torments of our Life: And as <HI>Socrates</HI> being ask'd by one who had b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en long abroad, why he had not more improv'd him∣self
<PB REF="48"/>
by Travel, answered well, because he had not left himself behind him, when he went to travel. So be∣fore a Man leaves the World, if he do not first dis∣charge both himself and his mind from the burthen that presses her, retiring will but star it the more, and press it the harder; as a sick Man suffers more hurt than good by changing place: It is but setling an Evil instead of removing it; and if we cast but a kind look upon what we have left behind, we still carry our Fetters along with us, and are not at liberty; we ought therefore at first to recover our selves from our selves, for without managing our superiour part, all the pains taken about the inferiour is to no purpose.</P>
<P>It is certainly a rare thing, that every Man should sufficiently stand in awe of himself, <HI>Ut satis se quis∣que vereatur</HI>, That we should win so much upon our selves, as to be able to dwell and delight in our selves. We must not so tie up our selves to the things of this World, that our felicity depend upon them, but reserve a Store-house to our selves, (what need soever happen) wherein we may secure and establish our true content∣ment and principal retreat. This World is a Comedy wherein every Man acts that part which Providence hath assign'd him; and as it is esteem'd more noble to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k on than to act, so there is no securer B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x from which to behold it, than a safe retreat, it being easier to feel than express the pleasure you will take with that your own Family, in standing aloof off, and in con∣templating the reelings and busslings of the multitude upon this Stage of the World.</P>
<P>There is no Counsel more proper for Men, than <HI>Te∣cum habita</HI>, to dwell at home, and not suffer any thing to steal us from our selves; there is neither profit nor pleasure worth so much, that we should go abroad to sick it. Even many of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect, (who propos'd to themselves no other end but their content∣ment)
<PB REF="49" MS="y"/>
did bereave themselves of all sensual delights, and contemn'd the pomp of all worldly Greatness for the only pleasure of Contemplation.</P>
<P>But you that are a wise Christian, and have well provided for your self and Family, and that may within your own heart enjoy both Vertue and God himself, have much higher advantages, and much more reason to keep within your own home, looking upon things without with an indifferent eye. That Man forgets his origin, who puts his soul <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of possession of her self, by continually running after business, and plodding to <HI>Westminster</HI> full of embarrass; whereas he should abandon, and bid adieu to all manner of business, that may any way im∣peach the tranquillity of mind or body. He that thus re∣tires, draws no man's envy upon him; he reigns by himself over his family, and all the pomp which great∣ness draws after it, is not comparable to that which you will enjoy in secret by thus retiring; which is in∣deed to shut up the prospect of this world, that we may take the better view of the other, by a prudent precaution, to untwist our affections, and slide off from the World, before the World slips from us; whereas they that continue in the throng of business, their minds lose their rest; and many times after a man hath lost his rest he loseth his labour also.</P>
<P>We have never greater cause to consult our best wits, what we are to do, and how to carry our selves, than when preferment, or publick employments are offered us. He that hath strength and wisdom to manage such places, may receive them; but he that hath enough for himself and family, ought not to entangle himself again with more than he can well manage, and make his whole life a burthen to him. And those wisely retire who being harassed with the fatigues of a publick life, foreseeing ill weather, are willing to put into port, when keeping out at Sea might endanger the vessel.</P>
<P><PB REF="50"/>When God intended to converse with <HI>Moses</HI>, he call'd him from the populous City to the top of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>, and Christ did not disclose the Glories of his transfigu∣ration at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>, but upon the Mount of Olives; and when God did disciple his beloved but rebellious People of <HI>Israel</HI>, he chose first the Wilderness, and then the two Captivities to be his School.</P>
<P>You should consider the notable Answer given by <HI>Cy∣neas</HI> the Philsopher to <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>, who told him, <HI>he would conquer</HI> Greece, <HI>then</HI> Rome, <HI>and so all the World. Cyneas</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Why he would give him∣self so much trouble?</HI> To which <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> told him, <HI>He would do it, that he might afterwards live hap∣pily and merrily with his Friends</HI>. But <HI>Cyneas</HI> sharply reply'd, <HI>He might do so presently, and not take so much pains for it:</HI> And so you may do now with your Family. Indeed Men that are still busied in publick Affairs, whose mercurial Genius inclines them to a restless Life, they (like <HI>Moses</HI> on <HI>Pisgah)</HI> see Re∣tirement their Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> afar off, but without hopes of enjoyment. And I have known some good Men in the last Age, who would never leave Employments till outed of them; like Whales that never come on shoar till they are wounded. And certainly those who after possessing great Places have been unexpectedly dis∣grac'd, are more really convinc'd of its slipperyness than those that never found the Effects of such Revolution. Nay those very Men who seek greedily after Employ∣ments pretend thereby a design for Retirement. The Merchants who seek abroad so much for Riches, is on∣ly to gain so much as may afford the conveniency of a Retirement; and Soldiers do sweeten the bitterness of their life by the remote prospect of a good Garrison and Winter-quarter. And <HI>Caesar</HI> himself said, <HI>Ali∣quando mihi licebit mini vivere</HI>, he desired his spare
<PB REF="51"/>
Hours, esteeming that part of his life to belong to others which he spent for other Men.</P>
<P>I know and have seen some Men retire from the World, who have yet look'd back at it, and oftentimes have kept their hearts in it. Thus many of the Phi∣losophers left the World in effect, but not in affection; for they had only their arms and legs out of the throng, their minds were still engaged. These Men did not take the right way; they thought they had wholly ta∣ken leave of all business, that they might live at more leisure and greater ease, but they mistook them∣selves; for tho' they had shaken off the Court, and pub∣lick Employments, they had not taken leave of the principal vexations of life, nor discharged their minds of the burthens which oppressed them: They had not order'd their contentment to depend wholly upon them∣selves, and that they could live alone in good earnest, and at ease.</P>
<P>However Men may converse with the World, and yet leave it; we may pass thro' a crowd, and not mingle with it. Every Ship that sails must needs have some part of the Ship under water; every Man that lives in this World, must needs have some of his labours spent upon the World; but as that part of the Ship by which a Man sails is above the water, so that part of us, which is above the earth, we must re∣move it from the World. Thus some Men (in which number I hope you are) have attain'd to that sublimity of mind as to be above all worldly cares; and tho' they meddle with the World as being in the World, yet they do it so safely, that they cleave not to it, nor are astonish'd to leave it.</P>
<P>It is a great misery for a Man never to be his own; too much business makes us strangers to our selves; the content we expect by our conversation is lost by too much conversation; and the advantages we get by our
<PB REF="52"/>
Employments abroad, are not to be compared with the satisfaction we receive in Retirement, (which I have found by long experience in the multiplicity of business of greatest consequence, during the many Years I was in publick Employment:) For as Bees must retire to the honey after they have gather'd the matter from flowers, so is it necessary that we retire into our selves to ga∣ther the fruit of our experience; otherwise we shall be but ill Husbands of the wealth we have gotten.</P>
<P>To retire for quiet and thinking is very recommen∣dable; Business and Conversation are thieves that steal away a great part of our time, and usually stuffs our memory with rubbish; Retirement is a great relief in such a case, and wise Men are glad to get clear of the crowd, for fresh air and breathing; and a life led in sweet tranquillity (which is the work of reason) is much preferable to the great advantages which the World admires. In Retirement we taste the sweetness of a quiet repose, and entertain our selves with free∣dom; nay, we live more in two days of retreat, than in two years full of business and trouble. And in this you may trust me, who have gone thro' more business military and civil, than perhaps any Man now li∣ving; and yet I have seen greater things in my re∣tired life, than ever I saw abroad. For what do we see great in the World. but Armies, Sieges of Towns, Courts of Princes, which seem great at first sight? But in Retirement, we look upon the different works of Nature, the Sun rising and setting, a still Night, and those Planets which so majestically rowl over our heads, which we continually admire. I could say much more to you upon this Subject, having found great advantages since my removal from the throng of business, and shall conclude with what <HI>Similis</HI> a great General to the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> did, who after his Honours, Victories, and Preferments, retired into the
<PB REF="53"/>
Country to his own house for seven years before he died, and desired the substance of this Epitaph to be engraved only upon his Tomb stone. <HI>Here lyes Ge∣neral</HI> Similis <HI>of a very great Age, who yet lived but seven years</HI>, relating only to the time of his Re∣tirement.</P>
<P>I hope you will excuse this long Letter; but I can never leave talking with you till I come to the bot∣tom, especially upon so good a Subject, and upon your own desire; and I doubt not but you will chuse what shall be most conducing to your own contentment. I have nothing else to add, but to assure you that I de∣sire nothing more in this World but once to have the satisfaction of embracing you, and giving you my last Blessing, with several Collections and Writings of my own, which may be satisfactory to you, and preserve my memory. Besides I have such a Collection of Let∣ters of the most eminent Persons of this last Age as are not any where else, and all digested into order, which I would most willingly put into your hands be∣fore I die. To which end I would very willingly meet you at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, or any other place within the Allies Dominions, believing my Lord <HI>Marleborough</HI> would easily grant me a Pass, from whom I have re∣ceived great Civilities during this War, which I do not find is now like to end so s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on as I thought: Adieu, and believe me over most intirely Yours.</P>

<P>UPON the Arrival of <HI>Don Bernardo Sali∣nas</HI>, the Master de Camp General was sent for from <HI>Flanders</HI>, who return'd hither on Sunday Morning. In his Pas∣sage between <HI>Bruges</HI> and <HI>Gaunt</HI>, having with him a good Convoy of Horse, they took a small Party of <HI>French</HI> Foot, who had before ta∣ken some Prisoners upon the River, and were convoying them to their Garrison of <HI>Pouke</HI>, a League and an half from the River; the <HI>French</HI> Par∣ty were all taken, and brought hither Prisoners on Sunday Night. The same Evening his Excellency was long in Council with his General Officers, where <HI>Don Bernardo Salinas</HI> was admitted; and there it was resolved, That the Master de Camp General should go with <HI>Don Bernardo</HI> to the <HI>Hague</HI>, to adjust all Matters with his Highness in
<PB N="2" REF="55"/>
relation to the Campaign, and they depart hence either on Thursday or Friday at farthest. In the mean time the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> continues at <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI>, for the receiving and dis∣posing of some Regiments that are marching thi∣ther from <HI>Holland</HI>. It seems the excessive Snow has made so great an Inundation between <HI>Gaunt</HI> and <HI>Bruges</HI>, that the Dike of the Passage River is broken on both Sides, and all that Country is like a Sea, there being no Passage either for Boats or Waggons; the Boats are forced to go to the <HI>Sas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI>, and so by the way of <HI>Sluce</HI>. The High Way where the Dike is broken, on the North side the River, lies fourteen Foot deep in Water, but many Hands are at Work to repair it.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> continues our Governor here, where he was Yesterday very busy in draw∣ing together our Forces both of Horse and Foot, who were all in Arms in the Market-Place, and the Sabloon, the Ports of the Town, being all kept shut for the more solemn Execution of <HI>Vant∣lo</HI> the Burgher: He was hanged in the Market Place, and afterwards his Body carry'd out and hung upon a Gibbet by the Fort, which he had designed to betray. After the Execution his Ex∣cellency declared publickly, That the Plot was so well laid, that had it not been prevented by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain's Discovery, it would infalli∣bly have succeeded, and the Fort, and consequent¦ly the Town, would have been taken. Befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Execution, he confessed the Sentence agains<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him was just, that he had received for fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Months past 100 Crowns a Month, Pension from <HI>France</HI>, and 100 Pistoles upon his first Agreement Some others, that are in Prison upon the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Account, have not yet been put to the Question
<PB N="3" REF="56"/>
As for his Wife and Sister, he declar'd them in∣nocent of the Plot, and that they knew not what was in the Letters they burnt, which was by his Command.</P>
<P>On Saturday Morning I waited upon <HI>D.B. Salinas</HI>, who told me, amongst other Discourses, that our Ambassadors at <HI>Cologn</HI> would not return for <HI>En∣gland</HI> so soon as was believ'd, there being great Appearance that one of them would go to <HI>Vienna</HI> and the other to the <HI>Hague</HI>, in order to His Ma∣jesty's Mediation for a General Peace; but with∣out <HI>France</HI> quitted all that was taken since the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty with <HI>Lorrain</HI>, and the Imperial Towns in <HI>Alsace</HI>, there would be no Peace; and said farther, though His Majesty had declar'd a Neutrality, yet 'twas visible by their Proceedings, that the Court of <HI>England</HI> was at this time as much <HI>French</HI> as before. I thought not fit to con∣test with him, and so only gave him a calm hearing.</P>
<P>Last Night being in Conversation with a prin∣cipal Person of this Court, who is privy to their most intimate Councils, a Discourse being raised concerning our present War, and His Majesty's making the late Peace, and quitting <HI>France</HI>; that Gentleman thereupon took an Occasion to say, That it was the Opinion of the wisest Men about his Excellency, that His Majesty had made this Peace with the full Consent of the King of <HI>France</HI>, which would in the end prove more to that King's Advantage than their Conjunction, and that it was a great Mistake in those, that thought this Peace was made by Constraint of the Parlia∣ment, which he had made rather by his own Ele∣ction; and that the Reasons inducing them here to be of this Opinion, were, That His Majesty
<PB N="4" REF="57"/>
finding so strong an Union against <HI>France</HI>, that it was like to be a general War in these parts of <HI>Europe</HI>, and that there was no disinteressed Prince sufficiently puissant to become Mediator; His Majesty therefore by quitting <HI>France</HI>, and decla∣ring a Neutrality, was the only Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> able to balance, and consequently to be a Media∣tor, which he had resolv'd upon, and was at this time proposing; and that if the <HI>French</HI> King could but maintain the War this Summer, His Majesty of <HI>England</HI> would get so great Advantages by car∣rying away all the Trade, and would be so en∣rich'd by that and the Retrenchment of his Army, that he would the next Year be able, without the Assistance of Parliament, to carry on a War against those that should refuse a reasonable Peace. And that this was so much their Belief here and in <HI>Hol∣and</HI>, (confirm'd now to them by <HI>D. B. S.)</HI> that in case they could take His Majesty at an Advantage, upon a sufficient and visible Breach of this Peace by his succouring of <HI>France</HI>, that they would then prevent his Mediation by declaring against him. He said farther, That they feared either the Mar∣quess <HI>de Fresno</HI> had not taken that due Caution as he should, in relation to that Article of not giving Succours to the <HI>French</HI>, or else that he does not take sufficient notice of some Actions since the Peace, which have raised great Jealousies both in <HI>Holland</HI> and here, as to the Sincerity of His Ma∣jesty's Proceedings herein; and said, That it was apparent these were His Majesty's Intentions in clapping up the Peace, since he continued his Ambassadors still at <HI>Cologn</HI>, tho' the Work was done to their Hands, whose stay there is only in Order to His Majesty's Mediation, that from be∣ing Parties they may turn Mediators. In fine, he
<PB N="5" REF="58"/>
concluded, That the weight of all depended upon the Success of this Campaign, and that if the <HI>French</HI> could bear out this Summer against so powerful Opposition without any great Shock, we must then be necessitated here to come to a Treaty in the Winter; and believ'd the Result of all would be, <HI>France</HI> to quit all their Conquests in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>, except <HI>Lisle</HI> and <HI>Doway</HI>, which he was confident they would never part with; <HI>Ma∣stricht</HI> to be given to us, and <HI>Ayre</HI> and <HI>St. Omers</HI> to the <HI>French</HI>, with the Restitution of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, and an Accommodement of the Differences in <HI>Al∣sace</HI>, and that a Peace upon Terms something near this would be the end of this War, notwith∣standing all our great Demands.</P>
<P>This being a Discourse from a Person very con∣siderable in their Councils, by which something of their present Temper may be judged, I thought fit to represent it to your Lordship, humbly be∣seeching your Honour to take my free Relation of these Particulars in good part; since I am of no Faction, nor have any End or Interest, but faithfully to perform that Duty I owe to his Sa∣cred Majesty, and that Service which I shall al∣ways pay to your Lordship with great Zeal and Observance, being in all Humility,</P>

<P>I am afraid I tire both your self and his Lord∣ship with the long Account I usually give; if so, I beg you will give me a little Caution, and I will be sure to govern my self according∣ly. Our last Letters from <HI>England</HI>, which were of the 30<SUP>th</SUP> past, and brought Orders for their Excellencies Returns, came too late to go by the Post, and so went not till Yesterday, and will not be with them 'till to morrow Morning; but his Excellency writes me Word by his of the 10<SUP>th</SUP> instant, that they are preparing for their Return though they had not then receiv'd their Orders, finding the Emperor's Ambassador begin to demes∣nage; and says he will send me the precise Time and Day of their Departure, desiring that I would give them a meeting in <HI>Holland</HI>, in their Passage, it being absolutely necessary in relation to some Affairs they have there, and that it will not take me up above five or six Days at most; in which time I will take Care the Wheel shall go in my Absence; and I beseech you to assure his Lord∣ship, that I will return with all imaginable Dili∣gence to my Station <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re. It will be the latter end of the next Week, I presume, before I can have an Assurance from his Excellency upon what Day they will depart: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that I shall scarce go from hence till Monday sennight, and shall be sure to give you a precise Account when I go, and when I shall return. I am in great want of Monsieur <HI>Theu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>, who has been absent above a Fortnight: I had much Light from him, he being daily with his Excellency. When I was at <HI>Antwerp</HI> I made
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
inquiry after him where he lodged; but from thence he went to an <HI>Irish</HI> Pastor in <HI>Flanders</HI>, and I have never since heard of him, nor know not where to send to him, to hasten him back; for if he were here in my Absence, I could well di∣rect how you should have a good Account. I intend writing to him to morrow by an <HI>English</HI> Je∣suit here, who tells me he will direct my Letters to him; and I hope he will be back before my going for <HI>Holland</HI>, and I will so contrive it, that I will not be absent above two Posts.</P>
<P>My whole Dependence is upon you, as to what Allowance his Lordship will please to give me, and I should be glad to be at a Certainty, that I might the better know how to govern my self. I can assure you my Charges are very great, all things growing dearer than ordinary, by reason of the Placaert for all House-keepers to store them∣selves with Provisions for two Months. I am necessitated to keep two Horses, the Charges of which are great, and my Journies to and again upon Occasions, with postage of Letters, not on∣ly from <HI>England</HI> but from other Places where I have a constant Correspondence, costs me much; besides, the Pains I take is more than ordinary, having only Sunday in the whole Week free to my self; but I confess when their Excellencies are re∣mov'd from <HI>Cologn</HI> it will not be so much. I humbly submit all to your Management, desiring you will please to manage it so tenderly, that his Lordship may not think I would not refer it wholly to his Generosity; but however, I beg you will get such Directions from him, that Mr. <HI>Thompson</HI> may have a general Order from you to furnish me with such a Proportion Monthly as may supply my present Occasions, that I may
<PB N="8" REF="61"/>
not run in debt, and lose my Credit, for then I shall be able do his Lordship no Service. Mr. <HI>Ni∣pho</HI> had an Allowance of 20 <HI>s.</HI> a Day, and yet kept no Horse, and had all extraordinary Char∣ges paid, of sending Letters and Expresses; and I am sure I shall do as much Service as ever he did. I give you this Account more particularly, that you may the better know how to discourse it with his Lordship; but in the interim, I beg you will please to send a Letter to Mr. <HI>Thompson</HI>, that he may give me some Credit upon Occasion, for there may some Accident happen that may require my sudden co∣ming my self to give an Account of it. But I must beg your Pardon that I give you so great a Trouble in my Concerns, which your own Gene∣rosity and Kindness to me has brought upon you.</P>
<P>The Baron, I perceive by his Letter this Day, stays his Journey to accompany the Ambassadors. I must humbly beg you will give my hearty Service to Mr. <HI>Knatchbull</HI>, with my Excuse for not answer∣ing his kind Letter, and be pleas'd to accept of my humble Acknowledgment for the Favour you did in satisfying him for his Nagg. Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> writes me Word, that if the Prince <HI>Barbanson</HI> went over before the Convoy, he would send my Ladies things in the Yatch, which I hope are come to her Ladiship by this; and I believe I shall have a Pair of very fine Servers to send over with the Ambassador's things from <HI>Antwerp</HI>, if not, to carry with me into <HI>Hol∣land</HI>, and so send them over by them.</P>

<P>ON Friday Morning before his Excellency's De∣parture for <HI>Antwerp</HI>, he gave a Visit to the Condestabless of <HI>Colonna</HI> in the <HI>English</HI> Cloister, and there promis'd her if she would return to the Castle of <HI>Antwerp</HI>, she should not only have the liberty of it, but also sometimes to take a Turn in the City at the <HI>Tour la Mode</HI>, provided she should not alight from her Coach, but that some∣times in the Fields she should have liberty to walk; to which she willingly consented, and on Saturday Morning was convoy'd to <HI>Antwerp</HI>. 'Tis said his Excellency has receiv'd Orders from <HI>Rome</HI> for giving her this Liberty, upon Complaints sent thither of her strict Confinement, and like∣wise of the great Disturbance and Offence the Guard of Soldiers gave to the Religious.

<P>We hear his Excellency finds but little ground for the Imprisonment of those Persons at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, that the Scout has been some Days since released, and the rest are like to be suddenly discharged; but I presume your Lordship will receive a more particular Account of that Affair from Mr. <HI>Nipho</HI> who is upon the Place. His Excellency returns not hither till towards the end of the Week, ha∣ving sent Yesterday for his Secretaries thither to make the Dispatches for <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>We hear there has been some tampering by the <HI>French</HI> at our Garrison at <HI>Lieuue</HI> to have had a Half-Moon deliver'd up, but it was discover'd and
<PB N="10" REF="63"/>
prevented. The Deputy-Governour is secured, and sent away to <HI>Tilmont</HI>, to which Place he is con∣fin'd at present; but whether he were guilty of Treachery is not said. On Saturday eleven <HI>Spanish</HI> Companies of the Regiment of <HI>Velasco</HI> were drawn out of <HI>Lieune</HI>, and sent to <HI>Namur</HI> for the far∣ther strengthning that Place, upon intimation that the <HI>French</HI> design either upon that Place or <HI>Mons</HI> in these Parts, or <HI>Ypres</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI>.</P>
<P>Last Night the Marquis <HI>d' Assenlart</HI> came hither by his Excellency's Command, having given him an Account of his Negotiation at the <HI>Hague</HI>. He assures us the <HI>Holland</HI> Troops are now marching, and that in fifteen Days Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> will be here with Seventeen thousand Foot and Eight thousand Horse. Great Preparations are making for the Lodgment of Ten thousand Men about this City, which we intend to have all this Campaign here, and Baracks are preparing round the Town accordingly, and the Fortifications are hastning with all imaginable Diligence. His Excellency's Resolutions are to have all his Garrisons well pro∣vided with Men and Ammunition, and with a Flying Army to attend the <HI>French</HI> Motions; and if they shall besiege any Place, he will be able to draw an Army of near Fifty thousand Men into the Field to raise their Siege. In the Interim we are resolv'd that the <HI>French</HI> Bravadoes shall not anger us into a Battel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor their Violence force us to fight, but upon great Advantage, being resol∣ved to take all, but to give no Advantage. I wish the Success of this Campaign may answer our Ex∣pectation; but usually when Men lay too great weight upon such Props, they are apt to break: The truth is, we are much encourag'd by all the Encounters we have lately had with the <HI>French</HI>,
<PB N="11" REF="64"/>
wherein we have still succeeded, and that is a good Omen to begin a Campaign with, all their De∣signs having hitherto been broken.</P>
<P>This Afternoon an Express is come from the Duke <HI>de Bournovile</HI>, which tells us, that Monsieur <HI>Bovessey</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Major-General, and an old <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> Officer with Six hundred Horse, most of them Reform'd Officers and Gentlemen, plac'd himself in Ambuscado to have fallen upon a Quarter of the Duke's; but he having timely notice where and when they intended their Ambuscado, drew out Parties several ways, and so fell upon them, kill'd Two hundred upon the Place, and eighty Prisoners taken, most Officers and Gentlemen, and Monsieur <HI>Bovessey</HI> himself shot through the Body.</P>
<P>We have receiv'd certain Advice from <HI>Flushing</HI> that Two thousand <HI>Spaniards</HI> are arrived there, one entire Regiment of a thousand Men, the o∣ther thousand in distinct Companies for recruiting the old Regiments here: His Excellency sent them Orders to fail to <HI>Ostend</HI>, where we believe by this time they are safely arrived.</P>
<P>We hear also that Monsieur <HI>Rapenhaut</HI> that com∣mands Six hundred <HI>Hollanders</HI> against the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI>, hath taken <HI>Newheuson</HI> in <HI>Westphalia</HI>, wherein were Five hundred Men: That eight Re∣giments of <HI>French</HI> are sent by Monsieur <HI>Belleford</HI> for the Assistance of the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI>, but that the Bishop is like to be attacked on all sides.</P>
<P>From <HI>Burgundy</HI> we can hear no News yet of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Advance thither, which gives us much trouble, that after all the Moneys he has receiv'd, and the Promises he has made of mar∣ching with such a considerable Army thither, he should now fail us when we most needed him;
<PB N="12" REF="65"/>
for which we are not backward in speaking very harshly of him.</P>
<P>This is all the News which at present occurs here worth your Lordship's Notice; and I must humbly presume upon your Lordship's Favour, to pardon my absence for two or three Posts, whilst I make a step to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to meet their Excel∣lencies, which they most earnestly desire, both to convoy some things to them from <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and to adjust some Matters with their Excellencies there: But I shall take such Care here in my ab∣sence, that whatever of moment passes, your Lord∣ship shall have an Account of it by Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI>, to whom I have order'd a Friend at Court here to write. In the interim I humbly throw my self at your Honour's Feet, being with all Zeal and Humility,</P>

<P>AFter four Days being at Sea betwixt <HI>Rotter∣dam</HI> and this Place, I arriv'd here but last Night late, and so could not reach <HI>Brussels</HI> this Day time enough to write by the Post, and there∣fore thought best to give your Lordship an Account from hence, though not so full as I might have
<PB N="13" REF="66"/>
done had I been at <HI>Brussels</HI>, whither I shall hasten to morrow Morning.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding our vigorous Preparations here, and that all the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army is now in these Parts to the number of Thirty thousand, yet the <HI>French</HI> have adventur'd to besiege the Fort of <HI>Navagne</HI>, which stands upon the River betwixt <HI>Maestricht</HI> and <HI>Visel</HI>, a small Fort of four Bastions, but of great consequence, it being the only Fort and Pass we have upon that River for keeping our Correspondency with <HI>Limbourgh</HI>. The <HI>French</HI> have rais'd three Batteries against it of twelve Pieces each; and I heard the <HI>Rhinegrave</HI> this Day say, that unless it were relieved in fix Days it would be yielded.</P>
<P>His Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is gone from his Quarters at <HI>Duffle</HI>, near <HI>Malines</HI>, this Morning, to confer with his Excellency at <HI>Brussels</HI>, that their Armies may be put in some better Posture than they are at present, the Country suffering extreme∣ly by them, and no Order nor Discipline amongst them, which makes the most sober People much doubt the Success of our Campaign: And 'tis more than whisper'd that there are great Discon∣tents and Divisions amongst our great Officers at <HI>Brussels</HI>, which has taken wind amongst the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers, who speak of it with much regret.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>French</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Navagne</HI> they took the Castle of <HI>Argenteau</HI>, betwixt <HI>Visel</HI> and <HI>Leige</HI>, a small Castle, but thought impregnable, being upon a high Rock and a deep Graff round, and the coming to it almost inaccessible; there were taken in it a Company of Foot, and the <HI>French</HI> are now undermining of it with intentions to blow it up. It's believ'd that when <HI>Navagne</HI> is taken they will besiege <HI>Limburgh:</HI> This unexpected
<PB N="14" REF="67"/>
Action of the <HI>French</HI> does much surprize us; for we thought they durst not have attempted any thing, but only stood upon their Defence: But we are like to find the contrary, for the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is said to be at <HI>Binch</HI> attending our Motion, that if we stir that way he is ready to follow us with a considerable Army; and the truth is we are not as yet in a condition to march, our Army not being yet modelled as it should be, and the <HI>Holland</HI> Army are so unruly and ill govern'd that we know not what to do with them, most of the Officers coming into this Place and other Towns neglecting the Care of their Companies and Troops. His Highness returns again this Night to his Quarters, and 'tis thought the Army will draw to a general rendezvous on Thursday, in order to attempt something upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI> is sent to <HI>Ruremond</HI> to command there, and to take care that considerable Place be put into a good Posture, there being in it near Two thousand Men Horse and Foot.</P>
<P>By the next I shall be able from <HI>Brussels</HI> to give your Lordship a more particular Account: In the interim I humbly beg leave to throw my self at your Lordship's Feet, and to subscribe my self with all imaginable Zeal and Duty,</P>

<P>I Have had so bad a Passage from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> hi∣ther, that Sir <HI>Thomas Sandys</HI> and my self have been four Days in coming hither, and arri∣ved last Night but a quarter of an Hour before so dreadful a Tempest happen'd, that had we been in it we had been in great danger of being lost. I was so ill and weary with my Voyage, that I could not possibly reach <HI>Brussels</HI> this Day time e∣nough to write by the Post, and therefore have given his Lordship a short Account from hence; and to morrow Morning I intend early for <HI>Brus∣sels</HI>, from whence you shall hear from me more at large by the next.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have taken <HI>Argenteau</HI>, a small Castle standing upon an inaccessible Place in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Territories on the other side the <HI>Maese</HI>, betwixt <HI>Visel</HI> and <HI>Liege</HI>, wherein were a, Company of Foot; the <HI>French</HI> are undermining it to blow it up.</P>
<P>The Fort of <HI>Navagne</HI> standing upon the same River, which was the only Bridle to <HI>Maestricht</HI> is besieged, and by some said to be taken; but if it be not reliev'd within six Days, of which we yet see no likelihood, 'twill certainly be lost:</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is with a considerable Army about <HI>Binch</HI> waiting our Motions, that if we stir towards raising the Siege of <HI>Navagne</HI> he will be ready to follow us.</P>
<P>This Day the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is gone to <HI>Brus∣sels</HI> to confer with his Excellency about drawing the Army to a general rendezvous, but it is veri∣ly believ'd <HI>Navagne</HI> will be lost before we can be
<PB N="16" REF="69"/>
in Condition to relieve it, which will be an ill Beginning of the Campaign, and a great disheart∣ning to the Army. I must beg your Patience till the next, and then I shall give you a better Ac∣count. I am with much Respect, and great Truth,</P>

<P>SINCE the taking <HI>Navagne</HI>, we have this Ac∣count from <HI>Leige</HI>, That there was but one Man killed within the Fort, and but thirty <HI>French</HI> without; that Preparations are making for blow∣ing it up, which is not yet done; that the Prince is march'd back towards <HI>Charleroy</HI>; that on <HI>Friday</HI> his Army encamped between <HI>Tongres</HI> and <HI>Leige</HI>, and on <HI>Saturday</HI> the Van Guard of his Army came to <HI>Perwy</HI>, not far from <HI>Gemblours</HI>, taking the way of the Grand <HI>Chaussey</HI>. 'Tis thought his Inten∣tions are to cover his Garrisons in <HI>Flanders</HI>, and to be ready upon the Defensive, either to march towards the Sea-Coast if the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet attempt any thing on that Side, or else to oppose any Design we may have upon the conquer'd Places; and we talk as if we should attempt <HI>Courtray</HI>, and by that means secure the River <HI>Lis</HI>, and so
<PB N="17" REF="70"/>
proceed to <HI>Armentiers</HI> and <HI>Lisle</HI>. But these are only Conjectures.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> Night we had News from the Duke <HI>de Bournouile</HI>, that some of the Imperial Recruits were come to him, that the <HI>Munster</HI> Troops were upon their March with all Diligence, that the 24<SUP>th</SUP> in∣stant General <HI>Souches</HI> was expected at <HI>Bonn</HI>, and that by the 26<SUP>th</SUP> it was hoped he would be with the Army near <HI>Limbourg</HI>, that upon his Arrival the Duke <HI>de Bournouile</HI> goes back to command the imperial Army in the <HI>Palatinate</HI>; in the interim, his Excellency has sent Orders to the Duke <HI>de Bournouile</HI> to advance this way with his Troops, and that the Recruits should follow; and ac∣ordingly we hear that the Van of his Army ar∣rived the last Night not far from <HI>Namur</HI>.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning Monsieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> was sent by his Excellency to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to see in what forwardness the Prince's Army was, and with him went the Quarter-master General to give them an Enlargement of Quarters. At their Return 'twas told his Excellency, That there was more <HI>English</HI> than <HI>Dutch</HI> spoken at his Highness's Table, and that they fear the <HI>English</HI> Court has too great an Influence upon his Highness's Coun∣cils, and a small Matter is enough to raise a great Jealousy amongst us here. All Persons admire our flow Progress, and our Military Men begin to speak loud against it, being generally much discontented; neither does the Prince escape their Censure, believing him not to be so throughly stanch in our Concerns as we expected. We com∣plain that his Army is not yet ready, and he re∣torts the same upon us, and that not without Cause, since in Truth we are neither of us ready; all our Forces not being yet come together, nei∣ther
<PB N="18" REF="71"/>
are the <HI>Friezeland</HI> Troops come up to the Prince; besides, his Train of Artillery, consisting of thirty six Pieces, were but disembarked on <HI>Sun∣day</HI> at <HI>Malines</HI>, and are not yet mounted, neither has he as yet Horses sufficient for his Train of Ar∣tillery and Carriages. Yesterday his Highness changed his Quarters, and advanced nearer <HI>Lou∣vain</HI>, having fourteen or fifteen fresh Villages ap∣pointed for his Army, those he hath hitherto had be∣ing quite eaten up. His Army commits so great Disorders, that the Boors are feign to quit their Habitations, and come hither to complain; and notwithstanding his Highness has publish'd strict Orders for the better Regulation of his Army, yet it is altogether ineffectual, the Soldiers saying in their Defence, <HI>they do not so much Harm here, as our Auxiliaries did to them in</HI> Holland; which cau∣ses many to say, <HI>They come rather to revenge than help</HI>. I wish we may find good Success by their Assistance, but I much fear the Continuance of our good Correspondence, and that we shall eve∣ry Day see greater Differences than other.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>, with four thousand Horse and Dragoons, has been for three or four Days in the Campaign, betwixt this and <HI>Vilvord</HI>, along the <HI>Rivage</HI>; the rest of our Army are up∣on their March from several Places; and part of our Train of Artillery, consisting of twelve Field-pieces, and near an hundred Waggons, are drawn up in the Park under the Court, ready to be spann'd at an Hours warning; and we say that our own particular Army, which shall march into the Cam∣paign, will be about eighteen thousand Men, of which seven thousand are Horse, one thousand five hundred Dragoons, and betwixt nine and ten thou∣sand Foot; and we are told the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s
<PB N="19" REF="72"/>
Army will be thirty five thousand effective Men, and the Imperial Army near as many. But with all these Armies there is nothing yet done but ruining the Country; and we now too late see the fatal oversight we committed in suffering the Conjunction of the Prince and <HI>Bellefond</HI>, which will put us to the playing an After-Game, where∣in we are like to run great Hazard; whereas we might easily have ruined both those Armies apart, with whom we shall now find enough to do. Yesternight we had News from the Prince of <HI>Con∣de</HI>'s Camp, which was then not far from <HI>Perwy</HI>, towards <HI>Charleroy</HI>, that they gave several Vollies of Shot throughout their Army, and three Peal of Ordnance; the Cause of which we knew not, 'till early this Morning that we have received the surprizing News of the Loss of the Citadel of <HI>Besançon</HI>, and consequently of that whole Pro∣vince; that the King of <HI>France</HI> is marching this way with his Houshold, and Court, and Body of his Army, having nothing more to do in <HI>Burgun∣dy</HI> but the reducing some Forts and Castles, which a small Force will easily do. This Account his Excellency received in the Night, and in the Mor∣ning about five went in Person to visit the Princess of <HI>Vaudemont</HI>, who had also several Letters. 'Tis said the Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI> was used with great Civility by the King, who sent an Escort to con∣vey him and his Followers to his Father's Army. This News has made so great an Alteration in our Councils, that we scarce know what Measures to take, and now find to our Cost the ill Consequen∣ces of not granting a Neutrality to <HI>Burgundy</HI>.</P>
<P>Before these Letters came we were puffed up with the Thoughts of what great things we would do upon our Conjunction with the <HI>German</HI> Troops,
<PB N="20" REF="73"/>
and now we are all so out of Countenance that we know not how to look upon each other; nei∣ther has his Excellency appear'd in publick this Day, though the Rhinegrave, and many <HI>Holland</HI> Officers were at Court; and now we speak not a Word of Marching, which before we were full of.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI> is gotten into <HI>Stevenswert</HI> with five hundred <HI>Germans</HI>, for the Security of that Place, being a Fort upon the <HI>Meuse</HI>, betwixt <HI>Ruremond</HI> and <HI>Maseyk</HI>, which he did by Com∣mand from his Excellency; but now the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is marched this way 'tis said he will be recalled from thence.</P>
<P>I was Yesterday to wait upon Count <HI>Egmond</HI> with whom our Master de Camp General had been two Hours in private. After his Departure, I found the Count much discontented, who told me in Confidence, that his Excellency would feign engage him to stay here this Campaign, and to undertake the Care of this Place, by reason of his great Interest with the Nobility, Gentry, and Citizens, and with the Country in general; to which the Count has given an absolute Refusal, unless he may have such a considerable Body of Horse and Foot with him, that he may not lose his Reputation by a seeming Defence, when he is not in a Condition to make it good. He also told the Master de Camp General how he had often represented his Condition to the Court of <HI>Spain</HI>, and also to his Excellency, that all his E∣state was confiscated in the <HI>French</HI> Dominions, his Woods to a hundred thousand Guilders cut down and sold, that he was unable longer to subsist, or bear up that Port that became his Quality, that no Care had been hitherto taken of him, nor the
<PB N="21" REF="74"/>
least Compensation given him, that at present he was resolved to go into this Campaign with two Valets de Chambres, two Grooms, and two Foot∣men, not having Horses to draw his Waggons, nor Money to provide them; that however he would serve the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in Condition of a private Trooper, rather than stay here in the Condition his Excellency proposed. This Passage I thought fit to relate to your Lordship, having it from the Count's own Mouth, which I heard with much Sorrow and Regret, to see a Person of that great Nobility, Honour and Merit, reduced to such Extremities, whilst other inconsiderable Per∣sons have what they please.</P>
<P>I have no farther Trouble to give your Lord∣ship, but humbly to throw my self at your Ho∣nour's Feet, being with all Zeal and Duty ima∣ginable,</P>

<P>ON <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night arrived here the Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI>; he came post from <HI>Besançon</HI> with the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Passeport, whose Civi∣lity to him he much extolls. He was received
<PB N="22" REF="75"/>
very kindly by his Excellency, whom he has ass∣ur'd, that the whole <HI>Franche County</HI> may now be gi∣ven for lost. He says the Governor of the Coun∣try, <HI>Don Alvedo</HI>, has put himself into the Castle of St. <HI>Anne</HI>, expecting only honourable Conditi∣ons; and 'tis thought by this time <HI>Dole</HI> is surren∣dred, and that the several Castles and Forts yet remaining, will be soon reduced, since there is no Hopes of Relief. He says that never such Exe∣cution was done with Canon as against that Cit∣tadel, it being made quite level, four hundred and odd kill'd in seven Days time with Cannon-Shot, eighteen thousand and odd hundred great Shot being made against it; that the Dexterity of their Canoneers was such, that no Musqueteer could shoot with greater Exactness, five several Centinels being kill'd upon the same Ground suc∣cessively in an Hours Time with the same piece of Canon. We have lost several Persons of Quality, besides Soldiers; the Prince has a slight Wound in his Face by a Stone struck up with a Canon Ball, and when he found the desperate Condition they were in, he caused all the Horse that were there to be turn'd out into the Counterscarp, that they might be useless to the <HI>French</HI>, being most of them kill'd between both Parties; they had no other Conditions but to come out with white Sticks in their Hands. His Majesty has put into it a Garrison of <HI>Switzers</HI>, with a <HI>Swiss</HI> Gover∣nor, which gives the <HI>Cantens</HI> great Satisfaction; his Majesty having thereby assur'd them, That he only seeks the Defence of his own Territories, and no Increachment upon theirs.</P>
<P>The Prince says the Duke <HI>d'Enguien</HI> is march∣ing hither with ten thousand Men, four thousand Horse, and six thousand Foot, to join his Father's
<PB N="23" REF="76"/>
Army; that His Majesty, he believes, is gone back to <HI>Paris</HI>, having left a sufficient Army to reduce the rest of those Places, and to secure his Conquest there; which is look'd upon here to be more con∣siderable than all the Conquests he made in <HI>Hol∣land</HI>, this being a real Security to his own Country, which before lay open that way.</P>
<P>We have now given over all Discourse of the D. of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, his Army being very inconsiderable, and Marshal <HI>Turene</HI> so posted, that if the Duke were stronger he could do nothing. We are much in∣raged against the <HI>Switzers</HI>, at whose Door we lay the Loss of <HI>Burgundy</HI>, and threaten more Revenge against them than we shall be ever able to take.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Mackully</HI>, a Captain in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Re∣giment here, who put himself voluntarily into <HI>Navagne</HI> with thirty Men, just as it was besieged, came hither Yesterday by his Excellency's Order, to give him an Account of the Condition and Rendition of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who says there was but fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in it, and the most of those free Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s who signifie very little; that there was not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ms sufficient for the Soldiers, being in great want of Musquets, and so ill provided for a Siege in relation to Provision, that the Soldiers were forced to drink Water those few Days they were besieged; which was such a Negligence as is scarce to be credited, since they have been in daily Expectation of a Siege ever since the War was declared. He says farther, That if they had not surrendered when they did they must have lost it upon the Attack, and that it was a Batallion of my Lord <HI>Douglas</HI>'s Regiment that were entred the Trenches to have attacked them, who first entred and took Possession of the Fort. He says <HI>Arg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>au</HI> is razed, and that the Soldiers had been
<PB N="24" REF="77"/>
two Hours at work in demolishing <HI>Navagne</HI>; but then came fresh Orders from the Prince to hold up, and repair the Breaches, which they are now doing, and have plac'd a considerable Garrison in it.</P>
<P>Yesterday his Excellency accompanied with Marquis <HI>d' Assenlaer</HI> and Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI> went to meet the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> at Dinner at <HI>Foun∣tain</HI>, near <HI>Vilvord</HI>, and return'd in the Evening. 'Tis said, and that by good Hands, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> expresses great Dissatisfaction at our Pro∣ceedings, and taxes his Excellency not to have per∣form'd his Promise in having Twenty five thousand Men ready to take the Field when his Highness's Army should be ready; instead whereof, he says, he knows well his Excellency cannot draw above Ten thousand into the Field▪ and leave his Garri∣sons provided; whereas his Highness says he has over perform'd his Promise, having at this instant within these Territories Thirty thousand effective Foot, Eight thousand Horse, and Two thousand Drag ons: And this I heard Monsieur <HI>Fario</HI> affirm Yesterday <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Dinner. To this 'tis said his Excel∣lency answers▪ that he intended a considerable Bo∣dy of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llanders</HI> to be put into our Garrisons, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> to be drawn out; and that he likewise reckon'd upon the <HI>German</HI> Recruits who are not yet come up. How these Differences will he reconciled I cannot say; but this is certain that there is great Confusion in our Councils. All this Morning his Excellency has been in Council with the General Officers of his Army; but what Resolutions are taken as to the Campaign are not yet publick. In all appearance we shall not take the Field so soon as was expected, for our Troops that were come with Lieutenan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="25" REF="78"/>
General <HI>Agourto</HI> from <HI>Cambray</HI> as far as <HI>Valenci∣ennes</HI> in order to join our Army here, are com∣manded back again; and our Troops that were coming from <HI>Flanders</HI> hither are also counterman∣ded. The Horses for our Train of Artillery and Carriages being very numerous, having eaten up all the Grass on that side the Town towards <HI>Vilvord</HI>, are now remov'd on the other side betwixt the <HI>Hall</HI> and the <HI>Flanders</HI> Ports; and when those Mea∣dows are destroy'd, I know no other remove but into the <HI>French</HI> Quarters. The truth is, all sober People are amazed at our Conduct, and cannot imagine what end we propose; for 'tis not to be believ'd that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> will fit still, when the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> is join'd, and in the interim we ruin our Country and do nothing. The Prince at present lies encamped with his Army a League on this side <HI>Charleroy</HI>, where they have plenty of all sorts of Provisions, having amassed a vast quan∣tity at <HI>Binch</HI> and those Quarters, that their Army cannot want. From <HI>Bouchain</HI> Letters say, that in <HI>Kenway</HI> and <HI>Landrecy</HI> great store of Provisions is made, and vast quantities of Ammunition-bread baked, that all the Mills in the Towns and Coun∣try round have Orders to grind Corn incessantly, which makes them judge the Prince will draw that way.</P>
<P>We know no more as yet of the Imperialists than what I wrote in my last, only this, we hear they begin already to demand Pay, without which they will not only plunder the Country, which they do already sufficiently, but they will quick∣ly moulder away; and however we flatter our selves, yet we are told, they will not advance much farther from their Borders than they are al∣ready, being not at all desirous of a conjunction
<PB N="26" REF="79"/>
with us; so that upon the whole matter, the Opi∣nion of the most prudent Men is, that we shall be necessitated in few Months to make a Peace, and that not upon so good Terms as we might have done before the Campaign. For the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (finding he is principally engaged in this War for our Assistance, and that we are in no condition of doing what he expected and we promised) seems not so eagerly to press it as we imagin'd; and unless some extraordinary Success at Sea should give him farther Encouragement, we believe he will proceed but very coldly; for some of his principal Officers say, if any Advan∣tage be gotten at Land, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Imperia∣lists</HI> will have it, and that their Army is like only to be weaken'd; and therefore we begin to be ap∣prehensive that when our Country is wasted, and no more Subsistance for his Army, he will then retire as he did the Winter-Campaign.</P>
<P>'Tis said that Orders are sent after <HI>de Ruiter</HI> to proceed very warily and not hazard much; but we are here so confident of his Success, that it was hotly reported on <HI>Tuesday</HI>-night late, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was besieg'd and no Men in it to make Defence, and on <HI>Wednesday Calais</HI> was taken; and so every Day a Sea-Port is taken with us.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI> writes from <HI>Stevenswert</HI> of the 30<SUP>th</SUP> past, that he was there with Count <HI>Mansfe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> and Five hundred <HI>Germans</HI> believing the <HI>French</HI> would have attack'd that Place; that accor∣dingly he was putting all things there in the best Posture he could for their Defence, which his Ex∣cellency had order'd him to make to the utmost, assuring him of Relief in case it should be besie∣ged; but that Fear being now over. I presume his Lordship will be suddenly recall'd from that hole.

<P>I Am forced to write with great Uncertainty to your Honour, since our Councils here are so ill founded, that what is resolved one day is set aside the next; for notwithstanding the Resolution taken on <HI>Friday</HI> last for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Ar∣my to pass the <HI>Canal</HI>, and to incamp on this side, as I then told your Lordship, yet the Prince, upon farther Consultation with his General Officers, and upon the Account the <HI>French</HI> Marquis gave him of the Place, that it lay very open to be attack'd, thought it not convenient to remove his Army, unless ours was also ready to march with him; and so his Highness still continues his Quarters, and has only changed some Towns for Refreshment of his Army.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> being out with his Regiment brought in near thirty Prisoners, and One hundred and twenty Horses belonging to Carriages and Baggage, which he took about three Leagues from <HI>Charleroy</HI>. The same Night a Party
<PB N="28" REF="81"/>
of fifty Horse went out again, expecting another Booty, but had the Misfortune to fall in with a Party of Five hundred <HI>French</HI> Horse, by whom they were all taken Prisoners or kill'd; the same time the <HI>French</HI> pillaged and burnt the Village of <HI>Borche</HI> three Leagues from hence.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> at Noon a Peasant of <HI>Burgundy</HI> came hither with an Express to his Excellency from the Governour there; he passed both the <HI>French</HI> Ar∣mies, and yet escap'd searching: The Contents of his Letters were kept very private, and none suf∣fer'd to discourse with him, whereby we judge his News was not very pleasing.</P>
<P>His Excellency is in daily expectation of an ex∣traordinary Currier from <HI>Spain</HI>, with a Commis∣sion for the Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> to be General of the Strangers here, and command all the Horse as Lieutenant-General under the Duke <HI>de Villa Her∣mosa</HI>, and that all other Lieutenant-Generals and Serjeant-Generals of Battel shall obey him; and it is intended that he shall command our Army of Horse this Campaign, if the Duke <HI>de Villa Her∣mosa</HI> can be prevail'd with to stay and command here, which his Excellency much labours in. However, 'tis thought this new Command will make great Divisions in the Army, and that the two Lieutenant-Generals <HI>Agourto</HI> and <HI>de Velasco</HI> will quit their Employments upon it, though 'tis cer∣tain there is no Man here so fit for that Employ∣ment as the Prince.</P>
<P>The Disgusts between his Highness and Excellen∣cy rather increase than lessen, and are like to be∣get greater Difficulties in our Army, than any Op∣position from the <HI>French</HI>, his Highness continuing much dissatisfied with the Weakness of our Army, and is resolv'd, as 'tis said, not to divide his.
<PB N="29" REF="82"/>
The Nobility in general seem extremely sensible of our ill Condition, and of the imprudent Manage∣ment of Affairs, it being impossible for us to draw together any more of our <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces, than what we have here already, neither will the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> put his Army to any hazard, till ours be in condition to march with him.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Army still continues en∣camp'd near <HI>Charleroy</HI>, and he is in Person diver∣ting himself at the pleasant Seat of the Count <HI>Buc∣quoy</HI>'s at <HI>Farcine</HI>. All our Hopes are, that he will lay Siege to some Place, whereby we may draw our Forces together out of the several Garrisons, wherein our Army at Present lies dispersed; or else, that part of his Army will be commanded away, and then we shall be strong enough to take the Field, and march into his Quarters: But the Prince so well knowing the present strait we are in, will scarce be induc'd to give us that Advan∣tage we desire.</P>
<P>His Excellency has sent a very considerable Sum of Money to the <HI>German</HI> Troops; and we are told that Three thousand which have been raised in <HI>Germany</HI> by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador, are marching this way towards our Army, and are to pass by <HI>Ruremond</HI>, where my Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI>, 'tis said, shall stay till their Arrival, and then march hither with them. His Lordship being again comman∣ded from <HI>Stevenswert</HI> to <HI>Ruremond</HI>.</P>
<P>Last Night at Six his Excellency, accompanied with Monsieur <HI>Louvignies</HI>, went to his Highness's Quarters at <HI>Duffle</HI> to confer about taking some pre∣sent Resolution concerning the Armies, and this Morning at two he return'd, and immediately af∣ter dispatched an Express in great Diligence to General <HI>Souches</HI>, directed to him at <HI>Duitz</HI> over a∣gainst

<HI>Cologne</HI>. This Day likewise several of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Train-Horses are gone to <HI>Malines</HI> to fetch some great Pieces of Artillery from the Magazine there.</P>
<P>From <HI>Limburg</HI> we hear that the Imperial Army is marching back towards <HI>Treves</HI> to besiege that Place, hoping by that means to divert the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> to look that way, that so we may draw our Army together; which as yet we cannot do without endangering the Places they are in, and likewise endangering the Troops being cut off in their Passage.</P>
<P>We say that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> has already sent away Four thousand Horse to join Marshal <HI>Turene</HI>; and that the Imperial Army in the <HI>Palati∣nate</HI> being join'd with the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> have besieg'd <HI>Philipsburg</HI>, which will cause the King to send his Forces from <HI>Burgundy</HI> thither, before he has quite compleated his Conquest there.</P>
<P>This Day at Court it was hotly reported, that the Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI> has this Post receiv'd Ad∣vertisement from <HI>Paris</HI> that the Duke <HI>de St. Ger∣mans</HI> has obtain'd a considerable Victory against the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Catalonia</HI>; but this, we presume, is invented to divert the common Discourses of our Affairs here, the Management of which is sharply inveigh'd against, and such bitter Comments made of it, that his Excellency by a severe Placaert has strictly forbidden all Discourses of News, or of the Armies, or their Actions, or Generals, under a very great Penalty, so that no Man dares ask publickly any News.</P>
<P>I am told this Day from a good Hand, that his Excellency by this last Post from <HI>England</HI> receiv'd a Letter from the Marquis <HI>de Fresnoe</HI>, wherein he roundly told his Excellency how much his Repu∣tation
<PB N="31" REF="84"/>
was lessen'd abroad, by suffering <HI>Navagne</HI> to be so pitifully lost, and very smartly taxed the ill reported Conduct of his Affairs; and that he for his own part was out of Countenance at these unexpected Proceedings, having been all along blown up by his Excellency with a Belief in what good Posture things were here, and what great Actions would be done, which were all come to nothing.</P>

<P>ON <HI>Tuesday</HI> Evening Lieutenant-General <HI>Don Marco de Valasco</HI> receiv'd Orders from the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> to draw out the Troops for his Excellency's View, which the Lieutenant Ge∣neral did; but understanding his Excellency's In∣tention was to give the Command of the Horse to Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>, he absented himself. His Ex∣cellency coming to the Head of the Troops, and missing the Lieutenant-General, sent two several Adjutants for him; but he having no mind to ap∣pear,
<PB N="32" REF="85"/>
would not be found. Whereupon his Ex∣cellency in great Anger declar'd to all the Officers (since he had not found the Lieutenant-General at the Head of the Troops according to his Duty) that they should no more own him as Lieutenant-General, nor give any Obedience to him: And then farther signified his Pleasure, That Prince <HI>Vaude∣mont</HI> (whom he stiled General of the Horse in <HI>Burgundy)</HI> should be own'd and obey'd by them as Governour of all the Cavalry, and to command them in chief next to the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>, and his Excellency did then put him in Possession of that Charge.</P>
<P>The next Morning the Lieutenant-General came to the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>, and declar'd his Rea∣sons why he did not attend. And that as to the Affront his Excellency had put upon him, by en∣deavouring to take away his Charge, he expected no better from him; but that it was given him by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>, and was not in his Excellency's Power to take from him. And that it might appear he would not retard his Majesty's Service in this Conjuncture, he was resolv'd still to continue his Charge, and obey Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> till his Com∣plaint should be heard at the Court of <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>He farther told the Duke that his Excellency had put a double Injury upon him, first in not putting the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Orders in Execution, wherein all Serjeant-Generals of Battel were com∣manded to obey the two Lieutenant-Generals, and now in imposing a General to command them, who had been a private Colonel only under them; and this not only without any Orders from <HI>Spain</HI>, but directly contrary to the Tenor of the King's Patent to them, wherein they are ordered to obey no General but the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="86"/>The same Morning the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI> wrote to his Excellency, taking notice that his Excellency having made a new General of the Cavalry, who had lately in this Service (as being a younger Col∣lonel) been under his Command, he thereupon thought fit to acquaint his Excellency, that it was not for a Person of his Post and Quality to be commanded by him who was so lately under his Command; and that therefore his Excellency might dispose of his Regiment, for he would serve no longer in that Quality, but would accompany the Army this Campaign as a Voluntier. His Ex∣cellency has hereupon sent to the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI>, and employ'd all that have Interest in him to ac∣cept of his Charge again, and that he will ingage to have him made a Serjeant-General of Battel; but the Prince absolutely refused, and last Night sent to his Excellency for his Discharge, which was this Day given him.</P>
<P>This has occasion'd various Discourses in Court, and no small murmuring in the Army, which is like to be more increased by the Disposal of the Regiment to a Reformed Major of Horse, (which 'tis said his Excellency has promised) for then four of the best Lieutenant-Colonels in the Army will quit their Employments <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Duke of <HI>Hol∣stein</HI>, the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI>, the Marquis <HI>Morebeck</HI>, and Baron <HI>Cunier</HI>; the Marquis <HI>de Leda</HI> likewise pretends for the Regiment, but his Excellency has not yet declar'd himself therein.</P>
<P>On Wednesday Morning at Three the Marquis <HI>d' Assenlart</HI> went privately from hence to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Quarters, where the Generals were most part of that Day in Council; and Yesterday the Marquis and Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> went together to meet with General <HI>Souches</HI> about <HI>Juliers</HI>, his Ar∣my
<PB N="34" REF="87"/>
being at present quarter'd about <HI>Duren</HI>, and with him they are to adjust all Matters relating to this Campaign; and till their Return all things here are at a stand, which makes all People talk at random, the very <HI>Holland</HI> Pamphlets not for∣bearing to jeer us. It's verily believ'd the <HI>Impe∣rialists</HI> will march directly for <HI>Lorrain</HI> after taking of <HI>Treves</HI>, which they think will not hold them many Days when once besieg'd; and from <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> they make account of entring into <HI>Burgundy</HI>, and recovering all our Losses before this Campaign be ended; but according as we proceed there is lit∣tle sign of doing what we pretend.</P>
<P>It is whisper'd here that there are some bad In∣struments about the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, who do very ill Offices in hindring, at least weak'ning that intire good Correspondence, which ought to be betwixt his Highness and his Excellency, and we are not like∣wise without Disgusts amongst our great Officers.

<P>On Tuesday Night Two thousand <HI>French</HI> Horse came towards this Place as far as <HI>Waterloo</HI>, and from thence sent Four hundred Horse very near the Town, who sent a Party of thirty Horse to a little Village without <HI>Namur</HI>-Port, adjoining to our Counterscarp; it being Seven in the Morning our Horse Guards were gone, and so they took away some Gentlemen's Horses in the Village, and some Forragers, and return'd before our Horse could follow them. In their Retreat the Peasants in∣trapped a Lieutenant and two Troopers; but the <HI>French</HI> in Revenge plunder'd that Village, and carried away two or three of their Peasants, whom as we hear since) they hang'd in the Highway.</P>
<P>Wednesday in the Morning Captain <HI>Palermo</HI> of the Marquis <HI>Wargnie</HI>'s Regiment (who was Com∣mandant of the Castle of <HI>Argenteau</HI>, and surren∣der'd it) was seiz'd at the Court-Gate, disarm'd, and put in Irons, and then sent to the Steen-Port, and Orders presently sent to the Surintendant to make his Process; and 'tis thought he will lose his Life for yielding a Place so inaccessible, that after Agreement to surrender (the Draw-bridge being by Accident burn'd) the <HI>French</HI> without and they within, were Twenty four Hours after all Diligence used on both sides before the <HI>French</HI> could get in or they out.

into it after it was besieg'd, was by Order from his Excellency Yesterday examin'd by the Sur∣intendant, to give an Account of that Siege and the Rendition of it, that the Governour may be either farther question'd or clear'd.</P>
<P>On Wednesday the Duke <HI>d' Enguien</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Charleroy</HI>; some say with Five thousand Horse, others more, and some less; the certain Number we know not, having but slender Intelligence from those Quarters notwithstanding they are so near us. But this Morning we are told that Yester-Evening the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> decamped, and is mar∣ched betwixt <HI>Binch</HI> and <HI>Mons</HI>, upon what Design we are yet to seek.</P>
<P>And what was said in the last of the Prince's sending Four thousand Horse towards Mareschal <HI>Turene</HI> is now contradicted.</P>
<P>Letters came this Day from <HI>Burgundy</HI> of the last of <HI>May</HI>, which say the King invested <HI>Dole</HI> the 26<SUP>th</SUP>; that the 27<SUP>th</SUP> a Battery was rais'd on that side towards the River, being the weakest Part: That the King had sent the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> with Four thousand Horse to invest <HI>Salines</HI>, to prevent their making Excursions whilst he was en∣gag'd in the Siege of <HI>Dole</HI>.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Spanish</HI> Letters came this Morning, but bring nothing extraordinary; but we are much raised with an Express come from <HI>Paris</HI>, as 'tis said, wherein is a Confirmation, with the Parti∣culars of the Victory of the Duke <HI>de St. Germans</HI> against Mareschal <HI>Schonberg</HI>, who is said to be wounded and taken Prisoner, and all his Cannon and Baggage lost.</P>
<P>The News of the Election of the Crown-Ge∣neral to be King of <HI>Poland</HI> sounds very harsh in our Ears, the Confirmation of which is this Day

<P>We are told that Four thousand <HI>Germans</HI> which were raised upon the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Account, and embarked at <HI>Hamburgh</HI>, are arrived in <HI>Holland</HI>, and from thence are coming to <HI>Antwerp</HI>; which if true, will be a good Recruit to our Army.</P>

<P>ON Saturday, being betwixt the two Posts, I took a Turn to <HI>Antwerp</HI> through the <HI>Holland</HI> Quarters to see in what Condition they were, and found them as likely Men to fight as I ever saw, both Horse and Foot. The Country betwixt this and <HI>Antwerp</HI> is miserably wasted, all Provisions both for Horse and Man destroy'd. In my Passage I saw thirty, forty, and fifty Soldiers in a poor Boor's House, and all upon free Quarter both for Horse and Man; so that most of the Boors being quite ruin'd have lest their Habitations. Yesterday the Prince began to march with his Army: All those Troops that were quarter'd near <HI>Antwerp</HI>, are pas∣sed over the <HI>Scheld</HI> to <HI>Willtbrook</HI>, and the Villages thereabout along the <HI>Canal</HI>, but some Regiments of Horse something higher into the Country, His Highness quarter'd the last Night at the Castle of Monsieur <HI>Vandernott</HI> at <HI>Sems</HI>, half an Hour from <HI>Malines</HI> towards <HI>Wellbrook</HI>. This Day the Army did not march; and in my Return hither this Mor∣ning on Horse-back, I saw several of their Regi∣ments exercising as I came along, his Highness not permitting any Days intermission without exerci∣sing, but when they are upon their March. The <HI>Ertez<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land</HI> Troops are coming up to his Highness▪ Army, being three Regiments of Horse, but what Foot I know not.

Bridge over the <HI>Scheld</HI> at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and Boats and Timber are preparing accordingly.</P>
<P>Yesterday, the Nephew to the <HI>Conde de Molina</HI> who is design'd Ambassador from <HI>Spain</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI>, parted hence with his Lady and Family for <HI>Holland</HI>, from whence he is to imbark in a States Man of War.</P>
<P>On Sunday about Two in the Morning Marquis <HI>d' Assenlaer</HI> return'd hither, having first been with Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> to give his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> an Account of their Negotiation with Ge∣neral <HI>Souches</HI> at <HI>Ruremond</HI>, where they met him on Friday last, and all three sign'd a Paper, wherein all things relating to this Campaign were unani∣mously concluded between them, for the carrying on the War with their several Armies as being all but one in Interest. The <HI>Imperialists</HI> are to pass the <HI>Meuse</HI>, and march this way, and Orders were given for making the Bridge before the Generals parted, and Yesterday General <HI>Souches</HI> intended to begin his March. Great Preparations are making about <HI>Diest</HI> and <HI>Louvain</HI>, and all those Quarters, for baking Bread for that Army, who 'tis said will be about <HI>Diest</HI> in few Days, and from thence are design'd to pass towards <HI>Namur</HI>, and so on towards <HI>Guise</HI> being all an open Cam∣paign, and that way to enter <HI>France</HI>, and give a Diversion to the <HI>French</HI> Armies, whilst we come on upon this side.</P>
<P>His Excellency having notice on Sunday-night, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away Six thou∣sand Horse towards <HI>Lille</HI>, in order as 'twas thought to march towards <HI>Ypre</HI>; he thereupon commanded Yesterday-morning the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> with Two thousand Horse to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, and to march on with all Diligence towards <HI>Ypre</HI> for Security of
<PB N="40" REF="93"/>
that Garrison. His Excellency likewise sent Mon∣sieur <HI>Richards</HI> the <HI>Burgoignian</HI> Collonel, being an old experienc'd Soldier, to go into <HI>Ypre</HI> for the Assistance of the Baron <HI>de Rock</HI> the Governour. But last Night his Excellency was assur'd, that those Six thousand Horse were not gone that way, but wheel'd about on the other side of <HI>Mons</HI>, and that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is with his whole Army very near it, and has taken up Posts at <HI>Roelx</HI>, and <HI>Chatteau d' Havre</HI>, and all round the Town; and has commanded all the Peasants both of <HI>Artois</HI> and <HI>Hannau</HI> to bring in Faggots to his Camp, as tho' he intended to besiege it, which much amazes us; because we cannot imagine he designs the besieging of that important Place, so strongly fortified, so well mann'd and victuall'd, that there is want of nothing. There is in it the Regiments of <HI>Vaude∣ment, Belle-Rose, Sermiento, Wargnies</HI>, and the <HI>Irish</HI>, besides many free Companies of Foot, with six Companies of Dragoons, and two Regiments of Horse; and therefore cannot conceive he intends to besiege it, but only hovers there upon some other Design, unless the King himself should come in Person.

<P>ON Saturday the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> was dis∣patched by his Excellency to General <HI>Souches</HI> to hasten his March, and to advertise him where the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Army was. The same Day our
<PB N="42" REF="95"/>
Master de Camp General, Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>, Count <HI>Waldec</HI>, Marquess <HI>Mompelian</HI>, and Monsieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> went with an <HI>Escorte</HI> of two thousand Horse to find a convenient Place for incamping our Armies, where they unfortunately missed of surprizing seven hundred Horse who were on the other side of <HI>Hall</HI>, as our Generals were on this side; and by their Scouts having timely discover'd our Body of Horse, they retired too soon to be engaged, their Retreat being through an inclosed Country, and towards their Army, where they might have Ambuscades laid. Our Generals all agreed to incamp our Armies at <HI>Tubise</HI>, a Vil∣lage a League from <HI>Hall</HI> towards <HI>Mons</HI>, as being very advantageous for the Security of our Camp. On Sunday Morning a thousand <HI>French</HI> Horse, with some principal Officers, came to view the same Place where we had been the Day before, having, it seems, receiv'd notice of our Intentions, which may now he probably alter'd, since his Ex∣cellency was this Day advertiz'd, that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> decamped this Morning at two a Clock, and is march'd with his Array towards <HI>Tournay</HI>, and a great Body of Horse towards <HI>Aeth</HI>, to co∣ver his March; and if this prove true, 'tis like∣ly our Motion will follow his.</P>
<P>Yesterday his Excellency received an Express from General <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uches</HI> that he began his March from <HI>Duren</HI> on Friday, and the same Night in∣camped near <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI>, with Intentions to march on with all Diligence, by the way of <HI>Condrot</HI> towards <HI>Namur</HI>▪ to which Place his Excellency has sent Commissaries to provide fifty thousand Rations of Bread tor that Army, and has also sent Orders for great Quantities of Bread to be baked in all the adjacent Parts. It's designed the Impe∣rial
<PB N="43" REF="96"/>
Army shall pass the <HI>Meuse</HI> betwixt <HI>Namur</HI> and <HI>Huy</HI> at <HI>Anden</HI>, where a Bridge is preparing; and 'tis believ'd the Army will pass there to mor∣row, or on <HI>Thursday</HI> at farthest. The Discourse still holds that they shall march betwixt the <HI>Sam∣bre</HI> and <HI>Meuse</HI>, and that way enter <HI>France</HI>, whilst our Army and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s shall advance towards the new Conquests in <HI>Flanders</HI>; but this as yet is only surmize. Yesterday after Dinner his Excellency accompanyed with the Master de Camp General, Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI>, and Mon∣sieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> went to <HI>Fountain</HI> to meet his High∣ness and his Generals, where they were in Coun∣cil till nine at Night, and have finally agreed, as we hear, without any more Conferences, for the marching of both Armies. Our Train of Artille∣ry, with our Ammunition Waggons, and twenty Waggons loaded with Pontoons, are all ready; and to morrow we expect four hundred Waggons, with three Horses in each, which are summon'd in from <HI>Alost, Dermond</HI>, and the <HI>Pais de Waes</HI>; so soon as they are all come we judge our Army will move; the Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> assuring an Of∣ficer of Quality this Morning, that before the end of this Week our Armies would be marched from hence, expecting before our March the Arrival of the I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rialist at <HI>Namur</HI>, and an Interview be∣twix<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Excellency and General <HI>Souches</HI>. It is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certainly known whether his Excellency goes i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Person into the Campaign; we see yet no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sible Preparations made for his own Train, which makes us judge that he will stay here. The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> is still in <HI>Flanders</HI> with two thousand Horse, at present betwixt <HI>Gaunt</HI> and <HI>Der<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> for the Refreshment of his Troops, from whence no can quickly join our Army upon its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="97"/>His Excellency has sent into <HI>Guelderland</HI> for our old Troops that are there to march hither in all Diligence, which are a Regiment of <HI>Croats</HI>, the Regiment that was the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI>'s, and Baron <HI>de Yong</HI>'s Regiment of <HI>German</HI> Foot. 'Tis thought my Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI> will have Or∣ders to come with them, which his Lordship much desires, being of no use where he is; and if he continues there, it may be concluded he is kept out of the way that he may not be privy to their Councils here.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> has taken lately a Review of his Army, which are said to be thirty two Re∣giments of Foot, besides the two Marine Regi∣ments which are here at <HI>Brussels</HI>, and those in <HI>Flanders</HI>, and an hundred forty four Troops of Horse, and two thousand Dragoons; so that he will be in the Field effectively between thirty and thirty five thousand Men. What our own Army will be, we cannot yet make any Judgment of, because they are dispersed, and 'tis not yet decla∣red publickly what Regiments shall march.</P>
<P>The Boors in those Parts where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are quartered (being infinitely oppressed by them) have taken their Opportunities of killing several of them, who have been found murdred in the Woods; whereupon great search has been made, and Soldiers Cloaths found in some Boors Hou∣ses, upon which his Highness has caused four or five Boors to be executed.</P>
<P>We hear that all the Prisons of <HI>Mons</HI> are full of <HI>French</HI> Soldiers, that the Duke <HI>d' Arschott</HI> caus'd a general Muster to be taken within the Town or all Persons able to bear Arms, which amount∣ed to near thirty thousand Men. We cannot learn the certainty of what Force the <HI>French</HI> Ar∣my
<PB N="45" REF="98"/>
is; all the Prisoners we take, and Deserters which come from them, report them sixty thou∣sand, which is more than a third part greater than we will give Credit to. But a Lieutenant of Horse of ours that was taken near <HI>Mons</HI>, and is sent back hither, who saw their Army all drawn up, judges them about forty thousand Men, and those as good Troops as he ever saw</P>
<P>It has been whispered here since our last Or∣der from <HI>Spain</HI>, that his Excellency had recei∣ved some Check for permitting Monsieur <HI>la Motte</HI> and <HI>Samur</HI> (being only Pen-Men) to intermeddle in the Councils of War, and for intrusting them more particularly in those Affairs than his Gene∣rals and great Officers, much to their Dissatisfa∣ction. And that which gives more Occasion to believe it, is, that Monsieur <HI>la Motte</HI> since that time has not been so frequent in Councils as be∣fore; and that his Excellency, to take him off from martial Affairs, has made him President of the Chamner of Commerce, and has sent Monsieur <HI>Samur</HI> to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, to be an Assistant to Count <HI>Rhe∣nenburg</HI>, who commands there in chief.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Ruremond</HI> of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> say, That the <HI>Cologn</HI> Troops which lately revolted, after ha∣ving killed most of their Officers, and broken fifteen Standards, have dispersed themselves.</P>
<P>Last Night Master <HI>de</HI> Camp <HI>Scot</HI> came hither with the sixty <HI>Scotch</HI> Men that were taken at Sea by the <HI>Ostend</HI> Caper. They were immediately mustred, and his Excellency gave Orders for cloathing them, and giving them a Months Pay, and so the Collonel to march with them to his Quarters at <HI>Leuwe</HI>.

<P>WE continue here in the same Posture we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The Imperialists are not yet advan∣ced any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rther than they were, being still about <HI>Liege</HI>, and have been endeavouring to induce that Government to receive an imperial Garrison into their Citadel, which we would fain persuade our selves here that they are inclinable to. It seems General <HI>Souches</HI> is resolv'd not to come much farther into these Quarters, till he is assu∣red his Army shall want no Provisions; and we now say they will not advance till the Corn is nearer ripe, it being otherwise impossible to find sufficient Subsistence for all our Armies▪ In the mean time the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> continues still a∣bout <HI>Mons</HI>, so miserably harassing all that Coun∣try, that there will be nothing left either for Man or Horse. He has sent Orders to the Chattel∣lany <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y</HI> to send to his Camp eight hun∣dred
<PB N="47" REF="100"/>
Waggon-Horses, and three hundred Cows for his Army, and all other Places are to provide proportionably. It is scarce credible how much his Army deserts; not a Day passes here without considerable Numbers coming in; so that we have it from good Hands, that his Army is lessened four thousand Men since his encamping about <HI>Mons</HI>.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army continues still where it was, and daily increases by taking in all Deserters, which his Excellency here will not permit. On Saturday I was at his Highness's Quarters at <HI>Semps</HI>, where there was no Appear∣ance of marching, but an hourly Expectation for his Highness and Excellency to go personally to confer with General <HI>Souches</HI>, which upon some Consideration is as yet delay'd. I had a long Discourse with Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI>, who seems of the same Opinion with General <HI>Souches</HI>, that there is not here a sufficient Store of Provisions for their Armies, and that it would be ruinous for them to make any great Advance 'till the Corn be ripe. He was very inquisitive to know really what Force his Excellency could spare to join with them, as∣suring me that his Highness would part with none of his Men to put into our Garrisons; and that if his Excellency could send four thousand Horse, six thousand Foot, and two thousand Dragoons, they would expect no more; and doubted not, but with that Addition to do great things before the end of the Campaign. And we shall now cer∣tainly be able to draw into the Field ten or twelve thousand Men, our Troops being come from <HI>Guel∣derland</HI>, and our Recruits from <HI>Germany</HI> being upon their March. I have understood from very good Hands, that his Excellency has a great in∣clination
<PB N="48" REF="101"/>
to besiege <HI>Arras</HI>, as a Place of the grea∣test Consequence towards regaining our lost Towns in these Provinces, and it is not unlikely but that may be the first Design we go upon.</P>
<P>On Sunday Night the Marquess <HI>Mortaign</HI>, late Governour of <HI>Dole</HI>, came hither, who was very kindly receiv'd by his Excellency for so well de∣fending that Place. He gave his Excellency an Account that one of our Regiments that was there, consisting of six hundred Men, had all taken Ser∣vice with the <HI>French</HI>, both Lieutenant Collonel, Major, and six Captains, with their Officers and entire Companies.</P>
<P>Yesterday Morning our <HI>German</HI> Letters gave us an Account of a long and sharp Engagement be∣twixt Marshal <HI>Turene</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, who had with him Count <HI>Caprara</HI>, with some <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops. The Relation is differently repor∣ted, but by a Letter of the 17<SUP>th</SUP> from the Duke of <HI>Bournovile</HI> to his Secretary here, which I had the Favour to see. It is thus written in general Terms, That the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being inform'd that Marshal <HI>Turene</HI>'s Army and his were much about an equal Number, was resolved to pass the <HI>Neckar</HI>, and to fight him if he oppos'd his Pas∣sage. That he had passed the River before the <HI>French</HI> came up, and being posted upon an advan∣tageous Ground endured several Attacks, and could not be forced from it; but Marshall <HI>Turenne</HI> having fourteen thousand Men, and the Duke but eight thousand, the <HI>French</HI> having Canon, and the Duke none, he was after many Charges, and four Hours dispute, forced to quit that Post; but retreated in so good Order, still bringing up the Rear himself, that he saved all his Bag∣gage, and still fought as he retired; the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="102"/>
pressing very hard upon him, insomuch that there was no Regiment there that charged not twice or thrice that Day; that towards the Evening he re∣treated to a great Wood, where the Marshal <HI>Tu∣renne</HI> thought best to leave him for fear of an Ambuscade: And so concludes, that the Engage∣ment ceased more favourably to the <HI>French</HI> than the Duke, that many Officers of Quality were kill'd on the Duke's Side, and so he believ'd on the <HI>French</HI>, and that the Loss was judged near e∣qual, and that then he had no farther Particulars but that he was then drawing his Troops toge∣ther, and going in Person to <HI>Heidelberg</HI>, and that being joined with the Duke, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> Troops, he doubted not of being quickly even with Marshal <HI>Turenne</HI>; which was the whole Substance of his Letter. There is another relation from <HI>Co∣logn</HI>, dated the 18<SUP>th</SUP> instant, which is more parti∣cular and long, and much to the Honour of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> in making so brave a Retreat, being over-powered by a much greater Number, and says there was about two thousand kill'd on both Sides. The Particulars will be at large in the <HI>Brussels</HI> Gazette, and therefore I forbear repeating them to your Lordship. But notwithstanding both these Accounts, the Prince de <HI>Vaudemont</HI> is said to have receiv'd an Express of a later Date, wherein the Duke is said to be victorious, and to have gained fifteen Standards, which is here re∣ported with great Confidence; and last Night were great Fire-Works at the Prince's House, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of the Victory, and his Excellency was there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imself, with the Prince. Whether this be true <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r not, your Lordship knows better from <HI>France</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an we can here. But the most sober People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere judge these Fire-Works to be in Imitation of

<P>We are in great Expectation to hear what th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fleet has done for these two or three Days; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have had a warm Report that they have take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Blaye</HI> upon the River of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI>; but finding no Confirmation of it, that Report begins to cool.</P>
<P>When I was at the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Quarters Sir <HI>Gabriel Silvius</HI> told me of a sad Accident th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hapned the Day before to Captain <HI>Mazine</HI>'s So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who lately come from <HI>England</HI>, being sitting up on a Bank upon the River side to wash his Fee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ground sail'd, and he fell in, where he w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> most unhappily drown'd.

<P>YEsterday the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> decamp'd from near <HI>Mons</HI>, and is march'd with his Army towards <HI>Tournay</HI> and <HI>Aeth</HI>.

<P>BY Letters from <HI>Cologn</HI> of the 29<SUP>th</SUP> past, we are told, that after Marshal <HI>Turene</HI> had reti∣red to <HI>Philipsburgh</HI>, to refresh his Army after the late Battle, he there crossed the <HI>Rhyne</HI>, and un∣derstanding the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> had withdrawn most of the Garrison from <HI>Newstad</HI>, he march'd thither, took it, and put a Garrison of four hun∣dred Men into it; and took also another small Place, which he burnt to the Ground, there be∣ing a Castle which had a Garrison in it, which he could not force. It's written also, that his Army is much increased since the Battle, by a Recruit of two thousand five hundred Dragoons, besides Monsieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI>'s Troops who are joyn'd with him; that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Army was about eight thousand, besides the Forces of the <HI>Circle of Franconia</HI>, and the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, and in the whole would be about twenty thousand Men; that he was marching from <HI>Ladenburgh</HI> towards <HI>Manheim</HI>, where he intended passing the <HI>Rhine</HI>, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng resolv'd to provoke Monsieur <HI>Turene</HI> to a Battle if he would accept it. The same Letter says, that the 28<SUP>th</SUP> past, one thousand five hun∣dred Foot, five hundred Horse, and five hundred Dragoons of the <HI>Munster</HI> Troops passed the <HI>Rhine</HI> near <HI>Mulheim</HI>, in order to their marching after the Imperial Army in these Parts.</P>
<P>General <HI>Souches</HI>, with the Body of the Imperial Army, lies encamped on the other side o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use</HI> near <HI>Arden</HI>, where they are to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which he forbears till his whole Army be com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="56" REF="109"/>
having been forced to file off several ways to pass through the rugged Country of <HI>Condrot</HI>; besides, all the <HI>Munster</HI> Troops are not yet come up to him, which, 'tis thought, he will expect there, before the Body of his Army passes the River. His Army consists of six Regiments and an half of Infantry, sixteen Companies in each Regiment, and one hundred and fifty Men in each Company▪ The Right Wing of their Infantry is commanded by the Prince <HI>Pio</HI>, the Left Wing by <HI>Vertmultez</HI>, who was General in <HI>Candia</HI>. They have ten Re∣giments of Cavalry, twelve Troops in each Re∣giment▪ and eighty Soldiers in each Troop, which are commanded by the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and Ge∣neral <HI>Spark</HI>, as Lieutenant Generals. Marquess of <HI>Bade</HI> is General of the Ordnance, and they have fifty eight Pieces in their Train of Artillery; they have also the <HI>Munster</HI> Troops which they reckon at six thousand Men, and in the whole they esteem their Army thirty thousand effective Men. But I shall have a most exact Account of their Army, and all their principal Officers, from their Adjutant General, which I hope to send your Lordship by the next Order.</P>
<P>We are told by some of their Officers, that the Army is very unruly, and notwithstanding the General uses great Severity of Discipline, not a Day passing without some Execution, yet it is impossible to keep them in order, they declaring▪ That if every Tree in the Country were a Gibbet it should not hinder them from taking whatever they find, which is Man's Meat, whether dead o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive. And therefore the General sent to his Ex∣cellency her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that notice might be given to the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Cattle might be brought in for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Army, with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut which it would be impossible t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="57" REF="110"/>
keep them from ravaging the Country. And 'tis much feared, the Liberty which this <HI>German</HI> Army takes will quite spoil the Discipline of ours and the Prince's Army, if they shall be near each other; to prevent which, his Excellency is publishing more strict Placaerts than have been formerly for governing the Army. And his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> uses very strict Discipline in his Army, the least Fault not escaping Punishment, which makes them begin to live more regularly.</P>
<P>On Saturday Night his Excellency's Guards of Horse marched hence, having Orders to carry with them four Days Provisions for themselves and Horses, and with them went his Excellency's Led Horses, his Servants and Retinue, with his Waggons of Provisions, and went that Night to <HI>Louvain</HI>, whither on Sunday Morning his Excel∣lency follow'd, with Marquess <HI>Assenlaet</HI> and Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI>, and arrived at the Cloyster of St. <HI>Gertrude</HI> in <HI>Louvain</HI>. About two in the Afternoon the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, accompanied with Count <HI>Waldec</HI>, and many other principal Officers, pas∣sed through <HI>Louvain</HI> with his Guards of Horse, and made no stay, but marched on to <HI>Tirlemont</HI>, where his Excellency overtook him, and that Night, it was said, they were to meet Gene∣ral <HI>Souches</HI> at a small Village not far from <HI>Tit∣lemont</HI>, in the way to <HI>Namur</HI>. His Excel∣lency had caused all manner of Provisions to be carried for their Entertainment, and had two thousand of his Horse, besides his Guards and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s for their Security, and One thousand <HI>Curiassiers</HI> were to come with Gene∣ral <HI>Souches</HI>. Their Intentions were to return this Night, for so I was told on Sunday at the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Quarters by Sir <HI>Gab. Silvius</HI>, who
<PB N="58" REF="111"/>
went with his Highness, and likewise by Sir <HI>Wal∣ter Vane</HI>, who stay'd behind by the Prince's Com∣mand to take care of the Army. But we hear this Day, that they are gone forward to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army to see it encamped, so that we believe that neither his Highness nor Excellency will return till to morrow. Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI> told me, after this Conference they should suddenly enter upon A∣ction, and their Army would march so soon as his Highness return'd; so that I hope by the next I may give your Lordship an Account what Resolu∣tions were taken in this Conference.</P>
<P>On Saturday also went away from hence all the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>'s Equipage for this Cam¦paign, he being resolv'd not to come hither til<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Campaign be ended. All the Hand-mills tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can be found or made, are order'd to be bough<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up to carry with the Army for grinding Corn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all imaginable Preparations are making fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Provisions and Forrage for the Army, and it is th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> general Belief it will not be many Days before ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Armies shall move.</P>
<P>We are assur'd the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Army con¦tinues still about <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure</HI> and those Parts, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he has had considerable Recruits come to him but to what number we cannot, at least are no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> willing to say; for we still continue that Humou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of undervaluing our Enemies, and will not believ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them half the number that general Report make<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. There is a Convoy of Three thousand an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> odd hundred Waggons (of which the Country o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Arra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> furnished Two thousand two hundred) com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all safe to the Army, and the Garrisons near i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The whole C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untry has been charged to send i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great Quantities of Cattel for the Army; and w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are told the Contribution Land of <HI>Kennaway</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

given Two thousand Cows in Specie, which is to be rebated out of their Contribution, according to the Value set upon the Cattel by Persons ap∣pointed at the Delivery of them; so that now they have plenty of all sorts of Provisions, and we do not find that the Deserters come so fast to us as they did.</P>
<P>His Excellency the Count <HI>Monterey</HI> has lately a∣greed with the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> for Eight thousand Men, who are to come hither for a Sup∣ply of our Army, his Excellency having now sent Money and all necessary Orders for them; and we are assured they are already upon their March, and will be here in six Weeks time at farthest; and though a good part of the Summer is past, yet we reckon we shall keep the Campaign for four Months intirely to come.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> last there having passed some angry Words between Count <HI>Egmond</HI> and Count <HI>Me∣rode</HI>, which came to his Excellency's Knowledge, he thereupon commanded them both in Arrest, the first to his House, the other to his Chamber, till they are reconciled.</P>
<P>The Bridge which his Excellency ordered to be made over the <HI>Scheld</HI> at <HI>Antwerp</HI> is finished, the principal Occasion of it being for the more spee∣dy and safe Passage of Convoys with Provisions from the Pay <HI>de Waes</HI>, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Parts of <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> for the Subsistence of the Army.</P>

<P>SInce my last the Troops of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army that were quarter'd about <HI>Diest</HI> and <HI>Arschot</HI>, are advanced towards <HI>Malines</HI> in order to their going to a general rendezvous, which is now every D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y expected, their Army as well as our having Orders to be in readiness to march with Bag and Baggage at the first notice.</P>
<P>On Saturday Morning his Excellency went to confer with his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and after his Return at Nine the same Night Monsieur <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uvignies</HI> was dispatched in great Di¦ligence to General <HI>Souches</HI>, to whom Yesterday hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Excellency sent four Curriers with Expresses be¦tween Eight in the Morning and Three in the Af¦ternoon; and about Five in the Evening a Gentle¦man of his Excellency's Chamber went Express t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eral <HI>Souches</HI>, and this Morning about Fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monsieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> return'd.

attend the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>. But I am told by a great Confident of Monsieur <HI>Louvignie</HI>'s, that his Excellency with Six thousand Horse and Dragoons, four Regiments of <HI>Spanish</HI> Infantry, two of <HI>Ger∣mans</HI>, and two of <HI>Walloons</HI>, will march to join General <HI>Souches</HI> before he makes any farther Ad∣vance, and so endeavour jointly to give Battel to the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>, whilst the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with his Army shall besiege <HI>Charleroy</HI>; and that General <HI>Souches</HI> makes a Halt with his Army till the Corn be nearer ripe, and that our Army draws to him. Whether this be our real Design I can∣not yet say, but a few Days will give us more light; in the interim this is the best Account I am able to give. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army is pre∣paring to march, and will certainly decamp on Thursday or Friday at farthest, if for no other Design, yet (as I am inform'd by some of their principal Officers) Necessity will force them, for they have no Forage left, their Horses for five or six Days past eating green Oats and Barley; and when that is done, they must turn their Horses in∣to the Rye, which-will kill them all: Their new Quarters are appointed towards <HI>Alost</HI>; his High∣ness's Quarters will be in that Town, or near it. I intend to see them at their general rendezvous; but as yet we know not where it will be.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> continues still his Quarters near <HI>Aeth</HI>, and his Army is encamp'd thereabouts, which we much wonder at, since he cannot but know the Strength of our Armies here, especially <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree we are told that his most Christian Majesty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s coming in Person to his Army, which is look'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon here as a Romance, believing he will come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where he is sure to conquer, as in <HI>Burgundy</HI>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not in <HI>Flanders</HI>, where we make sure he is to

<P>From <HI>Guelderland</HI> we hear that <HI>Grave</HI> is neithe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blocked up nor besieged, but that they are very strong in Garrison, and make daily Incursions: and that <HI>Maestricht</HI> and <HI>Maseyk</HI> do the like, ha∣ving in those three Garrisons, with those that were at <HI>Navagne</HI> which is now demolished, at leas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ten thousand Men, and that the Garrison o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ruremond</HI> is not without Apprehension of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attempting something upon them, unless <HI>Grave</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suddenly besieged by the <HI>Hollanders</HI>.</P>

<P>OUR last Letters from <HI>Germany</HI> tell us, that Mareschal <HI>Turenne</HI> being reinforced with a considerable number of old Troops from <HI>Alsace</HI> and <HI>Lorrain</HI>, had advanced upon the Army in the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, and forced them to retire from <HI>Laden∣burgh</HI>, which he had possess'd; and that he was marched with his Army, consisting of above Twen∣ty thousand effective Men of old Troops towards <HI>Manheim</HI>, in order, as 'twas thought, to besiege it. Which Account does well agree with what the Duke of <HI>Bournovile</HI> has lately written hither to a private Friend, wherein he complains of his ill Usage in being sent from the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army, which he had modelled with great Care and Difficulty, to command the Fragments of an Army composed of many Parts, which cannot be got together; and much blames the Management of Affairs a∣mongst the Confederate Princes, in not sending their allotted Supplies, whereby he is inforced to retire with the loss of his Reputation, and with Danger to the <HI>Palatinate</HI>. This Account gives the Assurance of Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI>'s Victory in the late Battel, which we would by no means believe, ha∣ving from time to time been deluded by the suc∣cessive Relations we have received of the flourish∣ing Condition of the Confederate Armies, magni∣fying the <HI>Imperialists</HI> Power there, and vilifying that of Mareschal <HI>Turenne</HI>'s; which has so fill'd our gravest Heads here with vain and impertinent Hopes, that we will not yet believe what the Con∣sequences make evident.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="117"/>After Monsieur <HI>Louvignie</HI>'s Return from Gene∣ral <HI>Souches</HI>, and that he had given his Excellency an Account of the Advance of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army near <HI>Dinant</HI>, and of their present Posture and Re∣solutions, he went to give his Highness the like, and return'd the same Night with this Account from his Highness, that there was an indispensible Necessity for his Army suddenly to leave those Quarters, since the whole Country was eaten up▪ and that all their Horse were forced to feed upon green Corn which would destroy them.</P>
<P>Yesterday Monsieur <HI>Louvignie</HI> was again sent to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with Resolutions, as 'twas thought, concerning their March towards <HI>Alost</HI>▪ which Quarters have been some Days past allot¦ted for them, and the Castle of <HI>Grimberg</HI> appoin∣ted for his Highness's own Quarters, but upon what account it has been deferred is not said▪ but the Conjectures are, because Monsieur <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prince still continues his Quarters about <HI>Aeth</HI>, from whence we expected he should have retired upon the Advance of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> for the Defence o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own Territories; and if the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army should advance on this side the River, they would lie so loose and open, that they would ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a great risk of being beaten up in their Quarter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the <HI>French</HI> Troops. Besides, the Troops that ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to form our Army are not come up hither, nor th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> General Officers yet arriv'd which his Excellency has sent for.</P>
<P>Several Reflections are made here upon thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our reiterated Delays, and all the World wonder<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at our backwardness, that nothing is done eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Sea or Land before this time; whereas th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet might have given them a strong an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considerable Diversion on the other side, whill

the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army had made a vigorous Inroad up∣on this, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s and our Army at the same time advanced into their new Con∣quests of <HI>Flanders</HI>; and if we shall still let slip all these Advantages which we might have made by so happy a Conjuncture, it will make our Weak∣ness more than ordinarily conspicuous. But the real Truth of our not moving sooner, is, that all our Generals have declared it absolutely impracti∣cable to march with such powerful Armies into an Enemy's Country till the Corn be ripe; which now drawing on apace, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> are advan∣cing, having decamped on Wednesday Morning at Three a clock; but whether they will pass the <HI>Maese</HI> at <HI>Givet</HI>, is not publickly known; the more received Opinion here is, that they will march by the way of <HI>Bastoign</HI>, and so to <HI>Treves</HI>, or else by <HI>Arton</HI>, and so towards <HI>Lorrain</HI>; and it's believ'd one of these two last is their Intention: By the next I shall be able to give your Lordship a more particular Account, of what at present we only speak by Conjectures.</P>
<P>Those of greatest Judgment amongst our Gene∣rals have propos'd, as I hear, to fall upon some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the King of <HI>France</HI>'s most considerable Towns, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Benefit of which we may be able to pass <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and upon a solid Foundation maintain the War afterwards, and not to put our selves into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Enemies Country, without first taking some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace for Retreat in case of Disaster. But others <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e rather for making an Incursion, and over-run∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng the Country, upon Presumption that at our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st appearance there will be a Revolt, persua∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng our selves that with these powerful Armies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shall do whatsoever we desire, believing nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t what agrees with our own Imaginitions, and

concluding before the end of this Campaign we shall have a great Part of <HI>France</HI> in our Hands, which I am afraid will prove but a false Re∣flection, and that we shall be mistaken in the Opinion we conceive of this Juncture to ruin <HI>France</HI>.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Imperialists</HI> marched, there was Mo∣ney allotted them by his Highness and his Excel∣lency together for a Month's Pay, which was ve∣ry welcome to those that had the good Fortune to receive it, who, 'tis thought, will convert most of it to their own use.

<P>SInce my last, Monsieur le Prince decamped with his Army from about <HI>Aeth</HI>, and marched with it by <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> on Friday in the Afternoon, bending his Course towards the <HI>Meuse</HI> to watch the Mo∣tions of the <HI>Imperialists</HI>. His Head-Quarters at present is at the Abby of <HI>Bonne Esperance</HI>, near the <HI>Sambre</HI>, and the Rere-guard of his Army is posted at <HI>Mauvaige</HI> not far from <HI>Binch</HI>. We have an Account from those who are well able to judge, who saw his Army at the rendezvous, and upon their march, that there are sixty Battallions of Foot, and One hundred and twenty Squadrons of Horse, which we reckon about Forty thousand. But on Friday Night he sent away seven or eight thousand Men towards <HI>Rocroy</HI>, and those Parts, for Reinforcement of such Garrisons he suspects may be in most danger.</P>
<P>Upon the first notice of his March that way, we were much alarm'd, fearing lest he might get some Advantage of the <HI>Imperialists</HI>, having so per∣fect Knowledge of that Country; and therefore his Excellency dispatched three several Expresses on Saturday Morning in great Diligence to give General <HI>Souches</HI> notice of it, and afterwards his Excellency went to confer with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>; and after a Consultation had there, the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>negrave</HI> was sent to General <HI>Souches</HI> to let him know what new Resolutions were taken. It seems this sudden Motion of Monsieur le Prince, and the unexpected Success of Mareschal <HI>Turenne</HI> has much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lter'd our Measures. For General <HI>Souhes</HI> (as we
<PB N="69" REF="122"/>
hear) is necessitated to send the third Part of his Troops to assist the Confederate Armies in the <HI>Pa∣lumate</HI>, and has thereupon made a Halt with his Army about <HI>Dinant</HI> and <HI>Chiney</HI>, till he is reinfor∣ced by a Conjunction with, or a large Supply from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s and our Army, who are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w designed that way, we beginning to be settled in point of Reputation; which being much lessen'd already by our so long lying still, will be absolutely lost, if with so much Preparation and with so great Forces we should consume unprofi∣tably a whole Campaign, which at first did seem to promise so much Advantage and Glory to <HI>Spain</HI>, and threaten so much Destruction and Ruin to <HI>France</HI>. And therefore after various Consultations, it is resolved that all ways shall be tried to force the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> to a Battel, and according to the Event of that to proceed afterwards to other Resolutions; and with this Design both the Prince of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange</HI>'s and our Army are advancing directly towards the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>, not doubting but to engage the Prince in a Battel in six Day's time; the Success whereof is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubted, that this Morning at the rendezvous of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nt <HI>Waldeck</HI> told the Prince, he made no q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in five Day<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s time they should hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that his Highness should see that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> lost Reputation of the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld lose his right Arm, if that Army we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orious over the <HI>France</HI>.

the new Conquests, but the Fortune of <HI>France</HI> de∣pends much upon this Army.</P>
<P>Yesterday the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Marine Regiments that were here marched towards <HI>Louvain</HI>, near which Place the rendezvous was this Day, his Highness having decamped this Morning very ear∣ly, and is this Night quarter'd at the Abby of <HI>Bethelem</HI> near <HI>Louvain</HI>, the whole Army being in∣camped there. To morrow his Highness marches forwards towards <HI>Charleroy</HI>, and has this Day sent a considerable Party of Horse and Dragoons to se∣cure two Passes upon the River of <HI>Dyle</HI>, over which he passes to morrow; one Part of his Army will pass at <HI>Hever</HI>, and the other at a Bridge betwixt that and <HI>Wavre</HI>.</P>
<P>To morrow Morning Marquis <HI>Assenlaer</HI>, the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>, and Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> march with what Forces his Excellency can spare: The Ammunition-Waggons and Train of Artillery are drawn up to the Park Gate near the <HI>Louvain</HI> Port, to pass out early in the Morning; what the num∣ber of our Troops will be is not yet said. His Excellency stays here, not having a sufficient Ar∣my for his personal Presence; but all the Forces he can get together are now about this City, and will certainly march to morrow Morning towards <HI>Namur</HI>, and will be to morrow Night near th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>.</P>
<P>I intend early to morrow Morning to go to the rendezvous of the Prince's Army, and hope after∣wards to see ours, and so shall be able to give your Lordship a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particular Account by the next <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we shall not be many Days without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able Action upon one Quarter or o¦ther of our Armies, for though tis not probable the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> will hazard a Battel upon such

unequal Terms, yet his generous Spirit will scarce be restrain'd from giving us some Side-blows upon the Skirts of our Armies; and whatsoever shall happen, your Lordship shall not fail of having a particular and exact Account of it.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Odyke</HI> is this Day marched with the Prince; and now having seen the Army together o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the rendezvous, he takes his leave to morrow, and returns to <HI>Zealand</HI> with his Lady, and Mon∣sieur <HI>de Lecks</HI>, who are both with the Army; and from thence he will hasten into <HI>England</HI> upon his extraordinary Embassy. We are told also from the Prince's Camp, that my Lord Ambassador <HI>Temple</HI> arriv'd at the <HI>Briel</HI> on Friday Night last.</P>
<P>His Excellency and all the Court are much a∣mazed at the Relation they have from <HI>France</HI> con∣cerning the Descent the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet made upon <HI>Bell-Isle</HI>, and upon that Account hope but for little good from their Army here, notwitstanding all the Commendations that are given of it; neither will the Officers of the Prince's Army believe the Relation, though the Truth of it be confirm'd se∣veral ways.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Ruremond</HI> of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> instant, that <HI>Grave</HI> was then neither besieged nor blocked up; that the Garrison consists of Three thousand Foot and Six hundred Horse incamped without the Town, only Guards kept at the Gates, and re∣lieved from their Camp.</P>
<P>It is written from <HI>Frankfort</HI>, that the Confede∣rate Army in their Retreat thither lost a great Part of their Baggage, and that Mareschal <HI>Turenne</HI> has taken several small Places since their Retreat, and that they do expect he should besiege <HI>Fran∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndale</HI>.</P>

<P>HAving Notice on Sunday that my Lord Am∣bassador <HI>Temple</HI> was coming hither in his way to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp, I went to <HI>Fontaine</HI> to wait upon his Excellency, who came in a Yatch from <HI>Holland</HI>. From <HI>Fontaine</HI> he sent his Secretary to make a Compliment to his Excel∣lency, and to desire an <HI>Escorte</HI> for his safe Passage to his Highness's Camp, intending to make no stay in <HI>Brussels</HI>, if Coaches could by any means be gotten. His Excellency return'd Answer, that he was much m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Ambassador's Servant, and would return his Compliment upon his Arrival: But that for his going to the Camp, the Prince would be marched before he could arrive there, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ither <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tell where his Highness could be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t that my Lord Ambassador's best way would be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> return back to <HI>Malmes</HI>, and from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mont</HI>, which he might do without
<PB N="73" REF="126"/>
an <HI>Escorte</HI>, and that there he might likely hear of the Prince. This dry Answer much surpriz'd his Excellency, since his rerurn to <HI>Malines</HI> was to lose a Days time, that being farmer from <HI>Tirle∣mont</HI> than <HI>Brussels</HI>, and that which added to his Trouble, was, that no Coaches were to be had till the next Day; whereupon I proposed to his Excellency, that notwithstanding it was late, and the ways insecure, I would adventure to the Prince's Camp by the way of <HI>Louvain</HI>, and would the next Morn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meet his Lordship at <HI>Louvain</HI>, and bring his Highness's Answer. And accordingly I went, but his Highness being marched in the beginning of the Night, I follow'd him, and not without Difficulty overtook and found his Highness about twelve at Night, two Leagues from <HI>Louvain</HI>, up∣on a very hasty March; where his Highness ha∣ving no means to read the Letter, demanded whe∣ther I knew any of the Contents; to which I re∣ply'd, My coming was to intimate to his High∣ness my Lord Ambassador's Arrival, and that he would be the next Morning at <HI>Louvain</HI>, to re∣ceive his Highness's Directions when and where he might attend him. To this his Highness told me, He knew not but that he might be twelve or fourteen Hours on Horseback, and perhaps many Miles from that Place, and that therefore it was not possible for him to say where his Excellency might find him. And when I pressed to know whether <HI>Tirlemont</HI> was not a convenient Place, his Highness told me that was the likeliest Place to hear of him; but I found by his Discourse that he had no great mind to speak at this jun∣cture of time with his Excellency, lest perhaps it might create a Jealousie in the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tick not to say that his Excellency's coming must
<PB N="74" REF="127"/>
needs be in Order to Proposals of Peace, which they seem unwilling now to hearken to. His Highness told me farther, that if I would return to his Quarters at <HI>Park</HI>, in my way back, there I should find Sir <HI>Gabriel Silvius</HI> who was to march after him the next Day, and that I might dis∣course the Business farther with him, and his Ex∣cellency take his Measures accordingly. And so from thence I went to <HI>Park</HI>, and wakened Sir <HI>Ga∣briel</HI>, and gave him an Account of the Ambassa∣dor's coming, but could find no Encouragement from him for his Excellency's going forward; for he told me his Highness was marching with great Secrecy and Diligence, with all his own and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Cavalry, towards <HI>Namur</HI>, there to join with five thousand Horse of General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Ar∣my, who had receiv'd Orders to pass the <HI>Meuse</HI> that Night at <HI>Namur</HI>, and that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ca∣valry were marched the nearest way, in order to their speedy Conjunction with them, lest the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> being but four Leagues from them should fall upon them before the Body of the Army could come up, and that therefore the De∣sign had been carryed with all imaginable Secre∣cy; and that his Highness, with all his Cavalry, was hastening that way, to be ready to second them upon any Occasion, and that the Foot were to march Yesterday Morning at three, which ac∣cordingly they did, and that it was hop'd Yester∣day by Noon the <HI>Spanish</HI> and Imperial Cavalry were join'd, and that his Highness with his Army hoped as this Day to be up with them, and so jointly to advance towards the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>; and that being united they should be eighteen thousand Horse, and twenty two thousand Foot effective. What General <HI>Souches</HI> will do with the
<PB N="75" REF="128"/>
rest of his Army, I cannot say, but I hear from good Hands that he is ordred to attend near <HI>Na∣mur</HI> on the other side of the <HI>Meuse</HI> the Motions of the <HI>French</HI>, and accordingly to govern him∣self; and in case the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> should re∣tire betwixt the <HI>Sambre</HI> and the <HI>Meuse</HI>, and so march back that way, that then the Imperialists should move as fast on the other Side, and pass over at <HI>Givet</HI>, whilst the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with our Army presses upon them on this Side; it be∣ing now finally resolved to advance with all our Armies towards <HI>France</HI>; being impossible to find Subsistence any longer for such Armies in our Territories. And it is verily believed, wherever they march they will be put to great Exigencies for Provisions, not having any Stock to carry with them, nor sufficient Conveniencies for grinding of Corn when it is ripe.</P>
<P>Last Night at twelve his Excellency parted hence after the Army; his going was carry'd with such Secrecy that it was not known till Night, and then Orders were sent to the Nobili∣ty and Officers about the Town to accompany his Excellency. He took with him only his Guards, and Monsieur <HI>de Fue</HI>'s Regiment of Horse, and three or four Waggons with his own Ne∣cessaries and Provisions. The Troops had Orders to march without any Baggage, carrying only each of them a Sack of Oats. His Excellency left strict Orders that all the Ports of the Town should this Day be kept shut 'till twelve at Noon, and no Boat, Messenger, Post, or other Person, to go out before that time upon Pain of Death.</P>
<P>This Afternoon I was inform'd, by an Officer who came this Morning from <HI>Mom</HI>, that the
<PB N="76" REF="129"/>
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was retiring with his Army, and was Yesterday in the Afternoon at <HI>Maubeux</HI> upon the <HI>Sambre</HI>, which is a great way before our Troops, and it is believ'd that he will sufficiently rein∣force <HI>Philipvil, Rocroy</HI>, and all the Garrisons of those Parts, and then retire toward <HI>Doway</HI>, where he will encamp himself about those Rivers, and lie securely, and want no Provision.</P>
<P>His Excellency has sent for all the Troops that can be spared from <HI>Flanders</HI>. The Regiment of <HI>Velasco</HI> is come already, that of <HI>Aldadoe</HI>, and the Regiments of Duke <HI>d' Avery</HI>, Baron <HI>de Yong</HI>, and Marquess <HI>Bournovile</HI> are upon their March, and will be here in a Day or two with some <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Troops also, and all the Troops that can be spared from <HI>Cambray, Valenciennes</HI>, and <HI>Conde</HI>, are sent to draw out and join our Army. All which Forces together will so far exceed the <HI>French</HI>, that we make no question of making a quick De∣cision in this great Business. Our Letters Yester∣day from <HI>Germany</HI>, seem to intimate, as though Martial <HI>Turenne</HI> should be bending this Way with his Army to succour the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>.</P>
<P>Yesterday, when we came from <HI>Louvain</HI>, I sent my Man back with Letters from his Excellen∣cy to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army, who is just now return'd, having left his Highness last Night encamp'd with his Army near <HI>Heylessem Abby</HI>, two Leagues on the right Hand of <HI>Tirlemont</HI>; He says, Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI> told him that they intended this Day to march forwards towards <HI>Charleroy</HI>, and by the way join the Imperialists, which they hop'd to do this Afternoon. In his Return this Day from <HI>Tirlemont</HI>, he met his Excellency the <HI>Count de Monterey</HI> about Twelve at Noon, passing
<PB N="77" REF="130"/>
through <HI>Louvain</HI>, having stay'd some Hours to refresh himself and Troops in the Fields on this side <HI>Louvain</HI>, and so made no Stay in the Town, but passed directly towards the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army.</P>
<P>Yesterday, about Noon, Monsieur <HI>Odyke</HI> par∣ted from <HI>Louvain</HI> to <HI>Malines</HI>, and so for <HI>Zealand</HI>; having first given a Complement to my Lord Am∣bassador <HI>Temple</HI> at his Inn.</P>

<P>ON Wednesday Morning his Excellency my Lord Ambassador <HI>Temple</HI> parted hence for <HI>Antwerp</HI>, where he intended yesterday to rest, and this Day to go forwards towards the <HI>Hague</HI> in his Yatch.</P>
<P>On Sunday Night and Munday Morning five thousand of General <HI>Souches</HI> Cavalry passed the

<HI>Meuse</HI> at <HI>Namur</HI>, with the General, and many of his principal Officers in the Head of them, and advanced that Day between <HI>Judoign</HI> and <HI>Gem∣blours</HI>, the General's Quarters being at <HI>Bosset</HI> Ab∣bey. The four thousand <HI>Spanish</HI> Cavalry, under Marquess <HI>Assenlaer</HI>, encamped between <HI>Judoign</HI> and <HI>Wavre</HI>.</P>
<P>On Tuesday General <HI>Souches</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Cavalry join'd; the same Night his Excellency the Count <HI>Monterey</HI> arriv'd at his Highness's Camp, between <HI>Hylessem</HI> and <HI>Huygard</HI>. On Wednesday Morning his Highness, his Excellency, General <HI>Souches</HI>, and all the other Generals met at <HI>Janch</HI>, where they held a long Council of War; imme∣diately after which, Orders were sent by General <HI>Souches</HI> for his whole Army to pass the <HI>Meuse</HI> at <HI>Namur</HI>, which they did accordingly; the Rear of their Army passing yesterday Morning, and they are now all united, being about seventy thou∣sand Men.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, after the Council of War was ended, his Highness and Excellency, with all the Generals, dined together at <HI>Wastin</HI>; his High∣ness's Army that Night encamping betwixt <HI>Ju∣doign</HI> and <HI>Gemblours</HI>, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Cavalry about <HI>Peruez</HI>, and General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Army betwixt <HI>Gem∣blours</HI> and <HI>Fleura</HI>, his own Quarters being at <HI>Som∣bret</HI> Abbey.</P>
<P>Yesterday the Army settled, and great Con∣sultations were had what farther Measures should be taken, after which Prince <HI>Vaudemon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> entertain'd his Highness and Excellency, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Peruez</HI>.</P>
<P>It's thought his Excellency will not return sinc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is so great likelihood of speedy Action, ma¦ny
<PB N="79" REF="132"/>
believing there will be a Battle fought to morrow or Sunday, both Armies being now with∣in three or four Leagues of each other, and that in a great Campaign, where several Rencounters have passed already betwixt flying Parties, with various Success.</P>
<P>By a particular Friend, come this Day from <HI>Nivelle</HI>, I am assured that Monsieur le Prince was last Night encamped with his Army between <HI>Fountain l'Evesque, Tresny</HI>, and <HI>Herimont</HI>, that his Guards were kept in several Places towards <HI>Senef, Revez, Brunshove</HI>, and that the Guards of Gene∣ral <HI>Souches</HI> were kept not far from them.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>d' Arschott</HI>, with Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI>, and all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces in those Parts amounting to seven thousand are posted near <HI>Mons</HI>, betwixt that and St. <HI>Gislain</HI>, with Inten∣tion to impede the Retreat of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> if he should stir that way; and 'tis be∣liev'd that by this time the Imperialists have en∣deavour'd to possess themselves of <HI>Pontlow</HI> upon the <HI>Sambre</HI> near <HI>Chastelet</HI>, thereby to pass over, and prevent the Prince's passing at <HI>Marchienne au Pont</HI>; so that he must then be necessitated either to give Battle or to retire towards <HI>Maubeux</HI>, and pass there, having (as 'tis said) thrown over se∣veral Bridges between that and <HI>Marchienne au Pont</HI>. But by his so long stay in the Place where he is, being a Race Campaign, 'tis thought impossible for him to retire without fighting, our Armies being drawn so near him. The general Discourse here is, that if he does retire, one part of the Army will besiege <HI>Charleroy</HI>, whilst the other fol∣lows Monsieur le Prince, they being so numerous, and so much overpowering him, besides the <HI>Spanish</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="133"/>
Troops about <HI>Mons</HI>, and those here, and that are coming from <HI>Flanders</HI>; but where to find Subsi∣stence for all these Armies, I cannot imagine, the Corn being destroy'd in all Places they pass, with their Horses and making their Barracks, so that there is none left to make Bread.

<P>SInce Saturday Noon all our Armies have been encamped near <HI>Nivelle</HI>, within a League and half of the Enemy; the Imperialists betwixt <HI>Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ez</HI> and <HI>Rosigny</HI>, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Prince of <HI>O∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange</HI>'s Army betwixt <HI>Archenne</HI> and <HI>Rosigny</HI>.

<P>Monsieur le Prince still continues in his old Post <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tween <HI>Peyton</HI> and <HI>Tresignie</HI>, where he is strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtified with a great Trench round his Camp, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d pallisadoed round; he lies at a close Guard, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ering our Army no Play except in small Par∣ties,

<P><PB N="83" REF="136"/>Our Armies have suffered some Scarcity through our own Disorders, the whole Country being un∣inhabited that should supply them, whilst the <HI>French</HI> by their good Government want nothing, having constant and orderly Markets in their Camp. This has occasion'd many of our Men to desert, especially the <HI>Hollanders</HI>; on Saturday twenty five Grenadeers deserted in one Company, and great Numbers go away daily unseen, be∣ing so near the Enemies Camp. On Sunday six were taken in their way between both Camps, and immediately executed. It seems the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> entertain'd all <HI>French</HI> Deserters, which now being near their Armies run back again, drawing many more with them, which makes us judge their former deserting was a Trick.

<P>There is nothing to be heard in our Streets here but crying and complaining against the barba∣rous Insolence of the <HI>Germans</HI>; and indeed the sad Spectacle of this Countries devastation, so much disheartens the Minds of the most sober People, that they begin to say, They had rather be conquer'd by the <HI>French</HI> than conquer with the <HI>Germans</HI>; though as yet we are far enough from this last Point; for though our Armies are very numerous, yet the well disciplin'd and smaller Forces of the <HI>French</HI>, under such an experienc'd General as Monsieur le Prince, will be as effe∣ctual in Proof as our great Armies, which being composed of a medly of Nations, are not like to agree well amongst themselves.

<P>ON Satuday Noon came hither the Count of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> in his way for the <HI>Hague</HI>, with an <HI>Escorte</HI> from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp, ha∣ving that Morning early left his Highness mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing with his whole Army towards <HI>Marimont</HI>,
<PB N="86" REF="139"/>
where they intended that Night to encamp. He told us publickly in Discourse at Dinner, that there was no good Correspondence in the Camp between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI>, nor indeed between any of them: That he fear'd the great Disagreement in their Councils, would much pre∣judice their publick Concerns. He said in those few Days they had been incamped near <HI>Nivelle</HI>, Seven hundred of their Army had been taken Pri∣soners, <HI>Spaniards</HI> as well as <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI>. That on Thursday the <HI>French</HI> took Three hundred <HI>German</HI> Foragers, and that our Army had not ta∣ken twenty <HI>French</HI> since their coming thither, ex∣cepting Spies, which they took daily, and the Day before a very remarkable one, being a young <HI>German</HI> Gentleman of a very good Family and Quality in <HI>Prussia</HI>, who was of the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Re∣giment; and having (as he said) lost a conside∣rable Sum at Play, was induced upon Promise of great Reward to undertake that hazardous Em∣ployment. He came very confidently with his Boors on into the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Quarters, like an Officer of the Army, where he was presently known, seized upon, put to the Question, con∣fessed his being sent, and in two Hours after was hanged before his Higness's Quarters. The Count told us that many of our Soldiers deserted, and that thirty of his Highness's Guards of Grenadeers deserting in one Company, who were all <HI>French</HI>, his Highness thereupon caused all the <HI>French</HI> to be stripped, and chased out of his Army.</P>
<P>He said, it was a sight would move Pity in Turks, to see so brave a Country as this so mise∣rably ruin'd by their Armies, sparing no Place but pillaging and razing all in their way: Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Highness was very severe in punishing Disor¦ders,
<PB N="87" REF="140"/>
having given strict Command for the hang∣ing any Soldier that should be found stragling without Passeport, and that accordingly no Day passed without many Executions. He told us it was generally resolved to attack some Place, and it was thought <HI>Quesnoy</HI>; that it was very proba∣ble we might hear of some sudden Action, our Armies marching so near the Enemy, and that be∣twixt three and four thousand Horse were drawn out that Morning for Security of the Army whilst they march'd so near the Enemies Plank. We had no sooner dined, than word was brought us that great shooting was heard without the Town towards <HI>Nivelle</HI>; which continuing till ten that Night, made us conclude the Armies were en∣gaged.</P>
<P>The Count told us, that on Friday his Excellen∣cy being desirous to see some of his Guards skir∣mish with the Enemy; thereupon Monsieur <HI>de Gaure</HI> and <HI>Don Domingo de Saisel</HI>, the two Cap∣tains of his Guards, took out some other Officers well mounted with Intention to shew his Excel∣lency some Divertisement. But the Nimble∣ness of the <HI>French</HI> surpassing their <HI>Spanish</HI> Gra∣vity, <HI>Don Domingo</HI> with two more was presently taken Prisoners, and one kill'd, and Monsieur <HI>de Gau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> had been certainly kill'd or taken, but that he was rescued by a brisk Lieutenant, who told him when he came back before his Excellency, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re was much difference be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ween skirmish∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng before an Enemies Camp, and in a <HI>Carowsel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore Ladies.</P>
<P>On Sunday Morning early many <HI>Dutch</HI> Waggo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers were at our Ports, with some hundred of Waggon-Horses cut from their Waggons, affir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing that the <HI>French</HI> had fallen upon the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-guard
<PB N="88" REF="141"/>
of their Army upon Saturday about Eleven at Noon, had defeated them; and in the mean time another Party had seized the Carriages of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army, and that they had escaped with great Difficulty. This Relation put us here in much Disorder, especially a continued number of People coming from the Army in a great Confusion, and giving such imperfect Relations, that we know not what Credit to give to them, since no Express was come from the Army, nor one <HI>Spaniard</HI> or <HI>German</HI> seen a∣mongst them, which made us hope our Armies were intire and fighting. The same Day after Dinner came several <HI>Dutch</HI> Waggons, and a∣mongst them one of Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI>'s, and two of my Lord <HI>Clare</HI>'s, whose Servants came to me to get Admittance into the Town, Orders being given to refuse Entrance. After I had them a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Lodging, they gave me the same Relation w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had before, but with this farther, That befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they escap'd the <HI>French</HI> were got up to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Carriages, and were pillaging them: That S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Walter Vane</HI> had ten Waggons, and this was onl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saved: That my Lord <HI>Clare</HI>'s were both here They told me when they were got some distanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Army upon a rising Ground, they sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Prince's Canon deserted, and nine Ensig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> running away with their Colours, without o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soldier following them, and that never suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Confusion was seen; some Waggoners cutti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their Ropes, and running away with their Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ses; some endeavouring to drive their Waggo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over Hedges, where they were overturn'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> broken: That in this Disorder they got away far as <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>velle</HI>, where they lay under the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Night, the Town not permitting any to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter:

That the shooting continued till Eleven at Night, the Heavens seeming all on Fire: That on Monday Morning early they came from <HI>Ni∣velle</HI>, and heard shooting till they came within a League of this Place, but not so violent as on Sa∣turday. These dismal Relations one after the other gave the whole Town no small Perplexity, all People thronging to the <HI>Namur</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI> Port to hear News. At last about Ten at Night came an Express from his Excellency, being one of the Under-Secretaries, who brought an Account to her Excellency, that our Armies had gained a great Victory, kept the Field, and beaten the <HI>French</HI> with great Loss into their Camp, pursuing them to their Trenches: That this Victory had cost dear, many brave Officers lost, and some thousands of Soldiers on both sides; but that the <HI>French</HI> had much the greater Loss.</P>
<P>The manner his Excellency's Letter related the Battel was thus: That the <HI>French</HI> in a very advan∣tageous Place had from a Wood attacked our Rear∣guard, cut in pieces some Squadrons of Horse, and Battallions of Foot, and had pillaged most of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Carriages; but that our Army turning Head upon them as fast as the Ground would permit, they were presently re∣pulsed: That Monsieur le Prince having sent Six thousand Horse to second this Body, they were so far engaged by our Cavalry, that fresh Troops were sent to succour them; and so in fine, one Supply was sent after another till the whole Ar∣mies became engaged, and that in so bloody a Battel, that the like has not been known in these Countries: That some thousands are kill'd on our part, but more of the Enemies: That many Offi∣cers of Quality were kill'd, and many missing,
<PB N="90" REF="143"/>
and amongst them our Master de Camp General Marquis <HI>Assenlaer</HI>, and Prince <HI>de Salm:</HI> That the Regiment of <HI>Holstein</HI> was cut in pieces, having endured the first Shock of the <HI>French</HI> Fury: That we were intirely Masters of the Field; and in case the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> did not retire from his Camp, they intended to attack him, and force it. This was the Substance of so much of his Excel∣lency's Letter, as the Marquis <HI>d' Oss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra</HI> (who commands in his Absence) was pleas'd to commu∣nicate to some principal Officers for their general Satisfaction; but I am told, there were other Par∣ticulars not so satisfactory, which were conceal'd. This News was that Night carried to the Magi∣strates, who were assembled in the Town-House, and all the City rung of the Victory. Yesterday there was great Rejoicing, and the Victory was magnified to that degree, according to Men's se∣veral Inclinations and Inventions, that I have ne∣ver heard such Romantick Stories told: That af∣ter the <HI>Germans</HI> had made a prodigious Slaugh∣ter of the <HI>French</HI> without their Camp, in the Night in great Fury they attack'd the Line, sur∣mounted all Difficulties, and gain'd the Enemies Camp, Cannon and Baggage: That Monsieur le Prince with some poor Fragments were escaped to <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI>, where he was besieged; and that Eight th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <HI>German</HI> Cavalry were following the <HI>French</HI>, who fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> over the <HI>Sambre</HI> towards <HI>Ro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oy:</HI> That the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> was mortally wounded, and taken Prisoner, the Duke of <HI>Lux∣em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh</HI> and M. <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>heford</HI> (and <HI>Bellefond</HI> that ne∣ver was th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, kill'd; and these Stories related at Court, and in all Places by Officers and others, and counterfeit Letters written from the Camp produced of it, that I presume by the last Night's

Post for <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>, the News is car∣ried into most Parts of <HI>Christendom</HI> of the greatest Victory that ever was obtained against the <HI>French</HI>; for we talk of no less than Ten thousand kill'd on our side, and Fifteen on theirs.</P>
<P>Our great Counsellors and Politicians were al∣ready concluding the Peace, and that nothing less than reducing the <HI>French</HI> King to the Peace of <HI>Worms</HI> would be accepted, that of the <HI>Pyrenneans</HI> to be set aside as well as that of <HI>Aix</HI>. These Things I do affirm seriously to your Lordship were spoken in my hearing Yesterday at Dinner, by some of the great Council of <HI>Brabant</HI>. Yester∣day in the Afternoon about Three came another Express from his Excellency, which being in Cy∣pher took up so much time, that we knew no∣thing of it but in general Terms that it was a Confirmation of the Victory, but something more moderated than before: By this time our Heat began a little to cool; and at Night there came to my Lodging a Gentleman of <HI>Nivelle</HI>, of the House of <HI>Launoy</HI>, a sober Person, and always well affected to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Interest; and he assur'd us, that whatever Relations we had of the greatness of the Victory, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> still continued in his Camp, had taken many Prisoners, much Booty, many Colours, and as some said Cannon: That our Armies were gone towards <HI>Mons</HI>, his Excellency retiring that way when the Battel be∣gan, where he might hear it, and have an Ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount given him without Danger: That he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>present in or near <HI>Mons</HI>, and his Highness the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s and General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Armies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>camped about <HI>Mons</HI>, and betwixt that and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nch</HI>. That if it were acknowledged a drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attel, it was much in our Favour; for that by
<PB N="92" REF="145"/>
all Circumstances the Victory rather inclin'd to the <HI>French</HI>, since they continued in the same Post they were before the Battel, having perform'd what they attempted, and more than they ex∣pected. He says farther, that Yesterday in the Afternoon the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> sent a Trumpet to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to give notice of what Pri∣soners of Quality he had; amongst which was our Master de Camp General wounded, but not dangerously, and many more of great Qua∣lity.</P>
<P>What farther Measures our Armies will take is not known; but 'tis much fear'd the loss and want of so many principal Officers who are wounded, may something retard, if not change the Resolutions they had taken.</P>

I have spoken with seve∣ral Officers of Quality of our Side, prudent, well-temper'd Men, that were in the Battle, these say they believe we had a Victory, because our Ge∣nerals tell them so, otherwise they see no Foun∣dation for it. That if we had a Victory, it was
<PB N="94" REF="147"/>
managed to our eternal Dishonour, because, the Battel continuing 'till Midnight, we did not stay 'till the Morning, but marched off from the Place of Battel before Day, without Sound of Trum∣pet or Drum beating, leaving not only our dead and wounded Men upon the Field, but the Pil∣lage of the Field to the <HI>French</HI>, who came early again on Sunday Morning upon the Place of Bat∣tel, had the Pillage of the Field, and continued there to carry off their dead and wounded Men, wherein two hundred Waggons were employed all that Day; whilst our Men were left wounded and dying without Assistance, to the great Scan∣dal of our old Generals, it being not only an O∣mission of Consequence in point of Conduct and Reputation, but also in point of Humanity, to leave such Numbers of poor wounded Creatures to the Mercy of our Enemies, whilst we cry'd up our selves victorious. But the truth is, our Ge∣nerals (being most wounded, or perfectly tired out with that Days Action) considered not what was fit to be done till they had marched a League from the Place of Battel, and then it was not thought Prudence to march back to hazard our Armies. The Fault of this, and some other Mis∣carriages that Day, are said to be laid to Mon∣sieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> Charge, against whom his High∣ness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was so much inraged, that we are informed he told him, That the King of <HI>France</HI> was more obliged to him in this Battle than the King of <HI>Spain</HI>. And that which makes us the more credit this Relation, is, that Mon∣sieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> is come hither two Days since, in great Trouble ana Discontent. It is acknowledg∣ed by all Persons, that the Courage and Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was that day to be ad∣mir'd,
<PB N="95" REF="148"/>
who flew from one part of the Field to another, not only to encourage his Men, but from the first to the last of the several Engagements, and in the Heat of every Attack, was the fore∣most, and has thereby gain'd immortal Honour. It's said also, that Monsieur le Prince never de∣signed any Battle with greater Skill, nor managed it with more Conduct; and that when all Parti∣culars shall be fully known, this will be esteem'd one of the greatest and bravest Actions of his Life.</P>
<P>The Relations which I herewith send, are the best and most pertinent of any come to my Hands, and the truest to so much as they relate; it being impossible for any (though upon the Place) to give an exact Relation of all Particu∣lars, because they were attacked in so many se∣veral Places. By the next Post I hope to send your Lordship a very particular Account as to the Loss of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Side, though I presume your Honour will receive a much better by the inclosed from Sir <HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI>, being upon the Place, than any other can give. I have understood by several <HI>Holland</HI> Officers, who came hither to recruit them∣selves after their Loss, that they really believe their Army is lessened ten thousand Men by this Engagement, in those that are killed, wounded, taken, and run away; thirty five or six kill'd in some Companies, besides the wounded, and twenty four or five in the least, which made them very angry last Night when the Guns went off for the Victory, and said they did really believe the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would hardly give the States an Account of so great a Victory as we made it here.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="149"/>Our Armies are at present encamped near <HI>Mons</HI>, his Excellency with our <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops at St. <HI>Symphosion</HI>, the Imperialists nearer to <HI>Binch</HI>, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s near him on the other Hand. All our Armies being now together en∣camped in Battalia, in open Campaign, upon the Plains near <HI>Binch</HI>, ready upon the first Allarm to draw to Battel. All our <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops that can be spared are drawn out of our several Gar∣risons in <HI>Hainault</HI>, and we have now a conside∣rable Body of our own Foot together. On Wednesday Night Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> went out with three thousand Horse and two thousand Foot, but upon what Design is not known. It is most certain that our Armies will suddenly attempt something of Moment; and as I was told, by a considerable Hand in great Con∣fidence, <HI>Douay</HI> is the Place designed to be besie∣ged, both in regard of the great Consequence of the Place, of the great Supplies we shall have of Provisions from <HI>Valenchiennes</HI> and those Parts, and that the <HI>French</HI> will find but one way to relieve it by the way of <HI>Arras</HI>, where they must come in an open Campaign, whereby we may have a fair Battel, which is the only thing we desire. For if they should come by <HI>Valenchiennes</HI>, they will leave all our Garrisons behind them, and will be embarassed between the Rivers; if by <HI>Lisle</HI> they must defile with their Army. Our only Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is, lest Monsieur le Prince should march directly hither, or relieve <HI>Grave</HI>, which Siege goes o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bur slowly, notwithstanding the Arrival of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Confederate Troops; their Attacks not being much advanced, as my Letters of the 15 Instan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speak.

upon honourable Terms, but those will not be granted, but only to yield at Discretion; and thus it may prove a long Work, the Governor being resolved to have honourable Conditions, or to sell it at a dear rate.</P>
<P>This Morning early the Body of Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI> was brought hither with a Convoy, accompany∣ed by his Nephew and some other <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men, and is at present in my Lodging, to be conveyed to the <HI>Hague</HI> and there interred. The Body of <HI>de Palm</HI>, Collonel of the Marine Regi∣ment, is also here, to go to the same Place. Their Deaths are both much lamented, and his High∣ness was pleas'd to express a very lively Sense of the Loss of so worthy and experienced a Com∣mander as he was; and when he was carry'd off the Field, the Prince came to the Waggon to comfort him.</P>
<P>It's said, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, by an Officer Express, has sent an Account to the States Ge∣neral of the Numbers and Qualities of the Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons kill'd and wounded in his Army, which will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or be made publick here 'till the States have re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard it.

<P>Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> continues still in his Post about St. <HI>Amand</HI>, to cut off all Communi∣cation betwixt <HI>Douay</HI> and <HI>Tournay</HI>; one of which Places, 'tis confidently said, we shall besiege, and the first most likely, because <HI>Tournay</HI> is surroun∣ded with so many <HI>French</HI> Garrisons, that we should be much incommoded as to our Convoys to the Camp. If we besiege <HI>Douay</HI>, we are not without Apprehensions that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> may take a Turn into these Parts, and if he should attack <HI>Malines</HI> and <HI>Vilvord</HI>, and take them, and pillage <HI>Louvain</HI>, which he may easily do, he would put us to a great Trouble in these Coun∣tries. There are some Thoughts that he may look towards <HI>Grave</HI>, but being so far off we can∣not believe he will abandon <HI>France</HI> whilst our Armies are so near it.

<P>We talk here, as if the greatest part of those <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Troops that are at the Siege of <HI>Grave</HI> should be ordered to march hither; but hearing nothing of that from <HI>Ruremond</HI>, I know not how to give credit to it.

<P>This we have from very good Hands, with this farther, that his Highness and General <HI>Souches</HI> will not attempt any thing against the Enemy, whilst his Excellency continues in the Camp, who, if he had studied to promote the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Interest, he could not have done it more effectu∣ally than by going into this Campaign; and the more he finds his Presence distastful to the Ge∣nerals, the more resolv'd he seems to stay; by which your Lordship may easily judge in how ill a Posture our Affairs stand; it being the Opinion of the most sober and unbiass'd Persons, that we shall do as little by Land, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet have done by Sea, for the Season of the Year changes apace; and whatever we pretend as to besieging any Place, there is little appearance of it, whilst Monsieur le Prince has so considerable an Army in the Field; who, if he be not able to raise the Siege, will at least hinder all Convoys to our Armies, and by that means put us in a worse Condition than the Besieged: And for our making a Winter War, which we say is the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> Trade, there is less Appearance how that can be done, since our Armies can scarce find Subsistence in the Summer; neither can I ima∣gine, as far as I am able to judge, where our Armies can take up their Winter-Quarters; I am sure these Provinces are not able to maintain them: And if we cannot carry the War so far
<PB N="106" REF="159"/>
from hence, as to take some such considerable Posts within the <HI>French</HI> Territories, as may se∣cure a Subsistence to our Armies in those Parts this Winter, I believe the disinteressed Part of the World will then conclude, that the great Charges we and our Allies have been at to carry on this War, will hardly quit Costs; and that his Excel∣lency, the <HI>Primum mobile</HI> of this War, and his Ministers who advised it, have taken very wrong Measures.</P>
<P>Since the Arrival of our last Orders from <HI>Spain</HI>, our Discourses are all for Peace, which that Court, as we are told, seems much inclin'd to, by the urgent Interposition of his Majesty, as also by the present Posture of their own Affairs, which succeed not so prosperously as they ex∣pected: And we hear from the Camp, that Peace is more their Discourse than War, our Confede∣rates beginning to be weary of it, foreseeing the Difficulties that will daily grow upon them; and these Advertisements come from the best Hands in the Army.</P>
<P>I was this Day assured from Monsieur <HI>la Vil∣lette</HI>, one of the four Members of <HI>Flanders</HI> who came Yesterday from our Camp, and is a Man much intrusted and privy to their closest Coun∣cils, that we should make a Peace before this Winter's ended, there being no likelihood of our making any Advantage by the War; that the only Difficulty is their great Jealousie that the King of <HI>France</HI> will break it so soon as he finds Occasion. But their great Confidence in his Majesty's Care for the Preservation of these Pro∣vinces to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI>; and his continual good Inclination towards them, do induce all the Members of these Provinces to submit to his
<PB N="107" REF="160"/>
Majesty's Mediation with all imaginable Alacri∣ty, not doubting of a good, firm and lasting Peace thereby. I presume to give your Lordship this Account, because I find at this time private Deputies are come hither from all the Provinces, who cry out much for Peace, and labour to in∣duce all People to be of the same Sentiment, foreseeing nothing but an inevitable Ruin to their Country without it.</P>
<P>I have this Afternoon seen a Letter from the Duke of <HI>Bournovile</HI>, dated the 18<SUP>th</SUP> instant at <HI>Gersheim</HI>, near <HI>Mayence</HI> upon the <HI>Rhine</HI>, to the Deputy of the Province of <HI>Artois</HI>, wherein he says, That if the Victory against the <HI>French</HI> be so great as related, 'tis like to make a great change of Affairs: That the Marquis of <HI>Bade</HI> who was marching towards him with the <HI>Imperialists</HI> and <HI>Munster</HI> Troops, having receiv'd Orders to return and join again with General <HI>Souches</HI>, has there∣upon made a Halt, and will neither advance towards him, nor return hither till he receives new Orders, whereby he is wholly useless to him: That the Forces of <HI>Lunenburgh</HI> and the Con∣federate Princes were not then come up to him, but daily expected; so that he was then altoge∣ther without Infantry, which might encourage Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> to advance against him; and that if he should receive any Foil, it was not his Fault, he having done all he could to be ser∣viceable to the Empire; and that whatever ill Accident should happen in this Conjuncture, could not be imputed to him, who had so long waited the Conjunction of the Confederates: This I saw under his own Hand, and therefore I pre∣sume to give your Lordship this particular Rela∣tion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="161"/>Several Parties of <HI>French</HI> Horse have been two Days since near <HI>Louvain</HI>, and have passed between that and <HI>Mechlyn</HI>, inforcing great Sums from the Villages to prevent their being burnt, and have likewise had their Engagements to send in Provi∣sions to <HI>Charleroy</HI>.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>Bergomeny</HI> that came from <HI>Bur∣gundy</HI> is for the present made Master de Camp General, till her Majesty's Pleasure be farther known. The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is marched Yester∣day with his Army on the other side of the <HI>Sambre</HI>, and is at present incamped at <HI>Anseureusse</HI>, waiting the Motions of our Armies, being ready either to pass the <HI>Sambre</HI> again at <HI>Manleux</HI>, to follow us if we bend towards <HI>Douay</HI> or <HI>Tournay</HI>, or else to march on the other side of the <HI>Sambre</HI> by us, in case we intend for <HI>France</HI>. The Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> is kept Prisoner by the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>, and will not be released upon his Parole, or any other Terms, being designed an Exchange for the Prince <HI>de Furstemburgh</HI>, they being both equal as Princes of the Empire and Colonels.</P>
<P>A Trumpet of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s came this Day from <HI>Charleroy</HI>, with a Passport for the Countess <HI>Bucquoy</HI> to go to <HI>Namur</HI>, who assures us, that Monsieur <HI>Montall</HI> is past all danger of his Wounds, and that the Duke of <HI>Luxenburgh</HI> is not wounded: That the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> conceives he had a great Victory against us, and that his most Christian Majesty has sent him particular Thanks for it.</P>
<P>I am this Day told from <HI>Ruremond</HI>, that the Letters from the Camp at <HI>Grave</HI> of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> in∣stant say, That there is no great Advance made in their Attacks; but that they had taken by Assault a Redoubt near the <HI>Meuse</HI>, and afterwards were

<P>MOnsieur <HI>Beaumont</HI> Secretary to the States of <HI>Holland</HI> arrived here two Days since with a considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um of Money for his Highness's Army; 'tis said One thousand Guilders will be given at present to each Company of Foot, and Two thousand to each Troop of Horse.</P>
<P>On Sunday Morning fifty <HI>Bylanders</HI> arrived here with five <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments of Foot from <HI>Flanders</HI>; Yesterday came also the Regiment of <HI>l' Avergne</HI> from <HI>Malines</HI>, they are in the whole about Five thousand Men: This Day the Convoy is marched with them out of the <HI>Andernech</HI> Port, commanded by Major General <HI>Fario</HI>, who came hither early on Sunday Morning disguised as a common Troo∣per
<PB N="110" REF="163"/>
in the <HI>Escort</HI> that came under the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Pass with Sir <HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Geldermaes</HI> (who was Deputy from the States-General with the Prince of <HI>Orange)</HI> both which departed Yesterday for <HI>Antwerp</HI> on their way to the <HI>Hague</HI>, from whence Sir <HI>Gabriel</HI> will hasten to your Lordship.</P>
<P>On Sunday Evening his Excellency very unex∣pectedly return'd hither, with all our Nobility that attended him this Campaign, with a Safe∣guard of Three thousand <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse comman∣ded by the Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>. 'Tis confidently said at Court, that his Excellency after he hath settled some Affairs of the Country, intends to return again to the Camp within a short time; and I am told in confidence, that either to mor∣row in the Evening, or on Thursday Morning, he goes for <HI>Antwerp</HI>, and from thence to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, which is kept very secret; and by the marching of some of our Troops that way which came with his Excellency, it's thought that either <HI>Oude∣nard</HI> or <HI>Courtray</HI> will be besieged.</P>
<P>Yesterday his Excellency caused the Horses of all the Waggons that could be found here to be arrested, and not suffer'd to depart, till the Con∣voy was sufficiently provided with Horses; neither is the Arrest as yet taken off. How far the Con∣voy goes this Night is not declared; but I presume they are only to draw together not far from the Town, and so put in order ready to march early in the Morning. All our <HI>Spanish</HI> Infantry, with the Horse that were here, have Orders to march, and some hundreds of Pioneers, and great quan∣tity of Ammunition; but upon what Design I am not yet able to say, farther than that we shall at∣tempt some Siege; for so I am inform'd from the
<PB N="111" REF="164"/>
Camp, and from several good Hands here. The Prince of <HI>Curland</HI> came hither last Night in his way towards our Camp attended with a very handsom Train and Equipage, and is this Day gone with Major General <HI>Fario</HI> under the Con∣voy: His Regiment is at the Siege of <HI>Grave</HI>, which has only the Name of being besieged, very little or no Progress being made in it, as I under∣stood from one of his Gentlemen that came from thence.</P>
<P>Our Confederate Armies are at present incam∣ped between <HI>Kieuraing, Conde</HI>, and <HI>Valenciennes</HI>; and 'tis written from thence, that so soon as this Convoy arises, they will go upon some considera∣ble Action; the Money for his Highness's Army is also gone with this Convoy, under the Care of Monsieur <HI>Beaumont</HI>.</P>
<P>There is so great Scarcity of Forrage near our Camp, that the Forragers are fain to go every Day between three and four Leagues, where they are taken in great numbers by the <HI>French</HI>, besides those who take that Opportunity of deserting, which they do very much for want of Provisions, no Week passing without our Armies wanting Bread a Day or two, and Beer as thick as Puddle, at eight Stivers a Quart throughout the Camp, and very scarce to be had. Great Complaint is made by our Confederates, that since we have been so long preparing for this Campaign, there was not sufficient Magazines of Ammunition and Stores of Provisions laid up in the several Garrisons of <HI>Hainault</HI>, which we knew would be the Seat of War. But that to the hazard of our Convoys, to the unsufferable Fatigue of our Ca∣valry, and to the great Loss of Time, we are ne∣cessitated to have all our Convoys both for Am∣munition
<PB N="112" REF="165"/>
and Provision from hence, never any War being laid upon so weak and tottering a Foundation. These and many other Particulars, wherein 'tis loudly said, his Excellency has fail'd, are the cause that he is very sharply censur'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers in general, (and also by our own) who stick not to make it their Table Discourse here, even within the Smell of the Court, affir∣ming, that if his Excellency returns again to the Army, there will be an end of the Campaign as to any Action; not one Day having pass'd whilst his Excellency was there, without some visible distaste or other betwixt his Excellency and some of the Generals: And that his Highness is resolv'd to attempt nothing, until his Excellency make good his Word, so far at least as to send Fifteen thousand Men into the Field.</P>
<P>Whilst his Excellency was in the Camp he pre∣tended to give the Counter-sign each Night, be∣cause the Prince gave the Word, which his High∣ness would by no means permit, to the great di∣staste of his Excellency; neither indeed is there any much better Correspondence between his High∣ness and General <HI>Souches</HI>, who seems unsatisfied that his Highness should carry all the Honour of this War; which certainly is far less than he me∣rit, it being an undoubted Truth, that if in the late Battel his Highness had not shew'd a most ex∣traordinary Courage and Conduct, our Armies had been all destroy'd And if a <HI>German</HI> Collo∣nel, who commanded some Battallions of Foot, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensed with General <HI>Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes</HI>'s Orders, and immediately obey'd his Highness it would have been a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Day to our Army: But the Col∣lonel seeing the Necessity of it, told his Highness though General <HI>Souches</HI> had given him Orders no
<PB N="113" REF="166"/>
to quit that Station, yet he would for once diso∣bey him, and follow his Highness's Orders, who led them on so vigorously, that they repulsed the <HI>Switzers</HI> from that advantageous Post with great Loss, and thereby became Masters of our Artille∣ry, which otherwise had been lost. As to the gi∣ving your Lordship a true and exact Account of the Battel in all Particulars, I find it impossible to be done; the Relation in <HI>French</HI> which I sent by the last Orders as to the manner of the En∣gagement, is said to be the exactest we are like to see on this side.</P>
<P>On Sunday Night I made it my business by way of Discourse to get the truest and amplest In∣formation I could from Monsieur <HI>Geldersmaes</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Wassenaer</HI>, as well as from Sir <HI>Gabriel Syl∣vius</HI>, of the present State and Condition of our Armies, both as to their Numbers, and Method taken in their Affairs, and of the Factions and Differences so prevalent amongst them; and they all agreed in this, that there was so ill a Cor∣respondence betwixt his Highness, and indeed all the Generals, and his Excellency, that there was a necessity for his Return. They told me farther, that <HI>Souches</HI> was not that great General he was esteemed; that he was no Observer of Martial Discipline, whereby his Army was like a Herd of wild Beasts; that he was old and doting, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd wholly lost his Memory; that he presently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orgets what Orders he hath either given or re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eived from his Highness. That General <HI>Spark</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a mere Brute without common Civility, almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umanity: That he may be a good Commander <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two or three thousand Horse for a Flying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy; but that he has neither Temper nor Parts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any degree proper for so great a Charge; and
<PB N="114" REF="167"/>
they agreed in general that our whole Armies are in want of good Officers. That for the <HI>Germans</HI>, setting aside the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI>, Prince <HI>Pio</HI>, Count <HI>Lesley</HI>▪ Marquis <HI>Grana</HI>, and Monsieur <HI>Cha∣vigniack</HI>, there is not a good Officer amongst them; of which the last is the best in Esteem. That their Army is now between sixteen and seventeen thousand, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s more than twenty thousand, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> between se∣ven and eight thousand; but now these Recruits going to the Prince's Army, and our <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops from hence, will make a good Addition. That his Highness was extremely mortified, to see Matters in general so ill managed, and so little Probability, through our own Faults, to to do any great Things this Campaign. That never any General more endeavour'd to put an Army in good Order, or took more Pains, or was more diligent in that great Station than his Highness, being so indefatigable in his Person, of so excellent a Temper, so valiant against his Enemies, and so obliging to his whole Army, that he is in general cried up for the most hopeful Prince living, and that he is like to be a greater General than any of his Ancestors.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with his Army lies en∣camped on the other side the <HI>Sambre</HI>, between <HI>Marchienne au Pont, Ham sur Hause</HI>, and <HI>Wal∣court</HI>, and so towards <HI>Philipville</HI>, the Van of his Army being near that Place. At <HI>Marchienne au Pont</HI> he has left a considerable Body of Horse and Foot for the Security of that Passage: That his Army has Plenty of all Provisions, lying at their Ease, and out of Danger, secured by the River and Woods, and is ready upon Occasio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to follow our Motions, which he watches ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="115" REF="168"/>
diligently, having Parties continually skirting upon our Camp. He has released several of our Officers that were Prisoners, upon their Pa∣role not to bear Arms this Campaign; and has now no Prisoner of Quality of our <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, but the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI>, the Count <HI>Me∣rode</HI> being two Days since dead of his Wounds, after his left Arm was cut off, to the great Re∣gret of his Excellency, as well as of his private Friends.</P>
<P>I send your Lordship here inclosed a particu∣lar Account, as precise as I can yet get it, of the Losses in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army; but I expect to have it more large and exact: This I only send your Honour as a Taste till it comes more fully; but what is in this your Lordship may rely upon as Truth, for so I received it from Monsieur <HI>Geldermaes</HI>, Monsieur <HI>Wassenaer</HI>, and Sir <HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI> together, and had it con∣firm'd to me also from the Camp.</P>

<P>I Suppose I can now give a particular Account of the Cause of the ill Correspondency which hath happen'd from the beginning of this Campaign between his Highness, General <HI>Souches</HI>, and his Excellency; which being related to me in Confi∣dence by a prime Minister here, I think it my Duty to represent to your Lordship, as I had it by way of Discourse; the Source of which Diffe∣rence began thus:</P>
<P>General <HI>Souches</HI>, at his Arrival with his Army upon the Borders of our Territories, made a great Demur upon passing the <HI>Meuse</HI>, hovering from one Place to another, occasion'd principally by his Instructions from the Emperor, that he should march to the <HI>Meuse</HI> for the Assistance of these Countries, acting what he thought convenient for the Advantage of the League, but not pass the <HI>Meuse</HI> without a pressing Necessity, which was lest to his own Discretion to judge of; howeve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if the publick Exigency of Affairs required hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Passage, he was from that time of his Passag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to govern himself and Army according to the Or¦ders he should receive from his Excellency. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occasion'd General <HI>Souches</HI> to halt on the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> side of the River, and to keep himself there proposing to besiege <HI>Mazieris</HI> and <HI>Charleville</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that side the River, whilst his Highness and E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cellency, with their Armies, should act on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> side▪ and this was one great Point of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rence at their Interview at <HI>Landen</HI>.

with his Army to take in <HI>Dinant</HI>, News came from the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of the Defeat and Retreat of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s and <HI>Bournovile</HI>'s Troops, with Letters at the same time from the Elector to General <HI>Souches</HI>, to have part of his Troops sent immediately for the Succour of his Coun∣try, which the General refused without express Orders from the Emperor, which the Elector pressed home at <HI>Vienna</HI>, affirming, that in case part of those Troops did not return for his Suc∣cour, he should be inforced to make his Peace with <HI>France</HI>. On the other Hand, his Excellency by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador, used all imaginable Arts to hinder the dividing General <HI>Souches</HI>'s Ar∣my, assuring his Imperial Majesty, and his Ele∣ctoral Highness, that the <HI>Luxenburgh</HI> Troops, to the Number of nine thousand Men, that were designed for these Low Countries, should march directly to the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, and would be there much sooner than the imperial Troops from hence. In fine, General <HI>Souches</HI> receiv'd Orders from his Imperial Majesty to send back part of his Troops under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> for Succour of the <HI>Palatinate</HI>, which he did accor∣dingly. Immediately whereupon his Excellency <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arther pressed General <HI>Souches</HI> to pass the <HI>Meuse</HI>, since there could be no thought of his doing a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y good upon <HI>Mazieris</HI> and <HI>Charleville</HI> with his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingle Army, and withal that there was a Neces∣sity of a speedy Conjunction of their Armies. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut General <HI>Souches</HI> still held off upon his Reso∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution of not being commanded by his Excellency, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd finding in his Instructions that he was equal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obliged to obey his Highness the Prince of <HI>O∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge</HI>, he thereupon sent his Son to his Highness's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uarters at <HI>Park</HI> near <HI>Louvain</HI>, to adjust that
<PB N="118" REF="171"/>
Matter so, as if it could be agreed that his Ex∣cellency would promise not to come to the Ar∣my, nor pretend to command it, but leave the sole Disposition of it to his Highness and Gene∣ral <HI>Souches</HI>, that then he, the General, would be contented to pass the <HI>Meuse</HI>, and according to his Instructions obey the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>. Upon this there was an Assurance given by his Excel∣lency that he would not come to the Army, whereby his Highness and General <HI>Souches</HI> were fully satisfyed, and a Probability of a very good Correspondence between them, and in order to it, General <HI>Souches</HI> resolv'd and prepar'd to pass the <HI>Meuse</HI>, and his Highness marched from <HI>Park</HI> to join his Army, which was no sooner done, but unexpectedly comes his Excellency from <HI>Brussels</HI> to <HI>Janch</HI>, where the Armies were, which so sur∣prized General <HI>Souches</HI>, that for some time he would not see him, making great Complaint of his coming to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>. Hereupon his Excellency sent the Marquess <HI>Burgomenie</HI> to General <HI>Souches</HI>, to let him know his coming was to hasten the advancing of their Armies, being now joined, having lost so much time already; with this farther, That his Excellency had notice from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador at <HI>Vienna</HI>, that Ge∣neral <HI>Souches</HI> had Orders to obey his Excellency. To this General <HI>Souches</HI> reply'd, That he would not have passed the <HI>Meuse</HI> but that his Excellency had promised not to come to the Army, nor pre¦tend to the Command of it; that for his part he had not spent so many Years in the War, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought a veteran Army of that Strength int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Countries, to receive Orders from two suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young Generals as the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Excellency, whose Orders were like to interfe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="119" REF="172"/>
every Day, and so his Army be bandied from one Place to another; that it was not for a General of his Age and Experience to be thus used, and that he would act no farther upon such Terms; but that for his Highness, he had his Instructions to obey him as well as his Excellency, and that his Highness being in the Head of a more power∣ful Army than the Emperor's, he was contented, and resolved to obey his Highness solely; and that for his Excellency, who had only brought three thousand Horse and Dragoons instead of twenty five thousand Men, he would have nothing to do with him in point of Command.</P>
<P>This Difference continued for some Days, which was increased by some Disputes of the same Na∣ture between his Highness and Excellency, who finding his Highness and General <HI>Souches</HI> both a∣greeing in the main Point, of outing his Ex∣cellency from any Pretence of Command; his Ex∣cellency thereupon declared that he would only continue with the Army in quality of a Volunteer 'till he saw more of his Troops join'd with them, which he did accordingly, but in that unsoldier-like manner, that by his feasting and entertain∣ing the <HI>German</HI> Ladies, he put the Army much out of Order, many of the principal Officers in Complaisance being at his Balls, when they should have been at their Posts, being so near an Enemy, to the so great distaste both of his Highness and Ge∣neral <HI>Souches</HI>, that they resolved to attempt no∣thing whilst he continued with them.</P>
<P>In this Interval happen'd the late Bittel, whilst his Excellency was gone towards <HI>Mons</HI> with a ve∣ry considerable part of his own Troops, merely for his Guard, when there was no Danger; which Troops and Dragoons, had they been present,
<PB N="120" REF="173"/>

<P>The V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ader General, who was at that time with his Excellency, when he heard the first shooting, importun'd his Excellency to return to the Battel▪ affirming it to be an eternal Infamy to any Person that had <HI>Spanish</HI> Blood in his Veins to stand there discoursing of the Battel, whilst their Confederates were fighting for them, but Monsieur <HI>la M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tte</HI> was of another Opinion, to which his Excellency more willingly adhered.</P>
<P>I am also inform'd that the Duke <HI>de Villa Her∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa</HI> publickly declared since the Battel, that he is in Honour engaged to serve this Campaign, but will never serve an Hour longer in the Qua∣lity he now is whilst this Governour continues And I am told from no ordinary Hands, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all these Circumstances, with many more too long f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a Letter, are represented with muc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sharpness, both to the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Ma¦drid</HI>, seconded by all the Generals of the Counts excepting only the Prince <HI>de Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>demont</HI>.

all these things considered, I presume your Lord∣ship will not much wonder at the ill Correspon∣dence amongst us, and that there is but small Appearance of our doing any great Matters this Campaign. And your Lordship will easily judge by the present State of things here, whether our Necessities will not urge us to a Peace, since little Redress is like to be by the Sword; for though at the first opening of the Campaign, by comparing our Forces with the Enemies, there was a seem∣ing Probability of doing great things, yet for ought I see hitherto the Remedy appears worse than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Disease, and our Necessities will be soon redoubled upon us; for we do not only want Treasure to maintain the Charges of the War, but even Subsistence for them that fight for us; so that those that assist us here, are growing so weary of it, that I am afraid they will hardly be drawn to continue it much longer.</P>
<P>We are in great Expectation of our next Let∣ters from <HI>Spain</HI>, it being the general Opinion a∣mongst the wisest sort here, that we shall sud∣denly see great Alterations in our Government, there having never been so universal a Dissatis∣faction amongst all our Officers Military and Civil, as well as amongst the People, many crying out, There can be no less than Treason in the ill Ma∣nagement of our Affairs; whilst the more Mode∣rate bewail the Miseries of our Country, occa∣sion'd (as they say) by the Weakness and Incapa∣cities of those that are at the Helm.

<P>OUR Armies still continue in the same Post they were, with this only Difference, That the Imperialists are said to be fortifying their Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and particularly at the Abbey of <HI>Crespin</HI>, where they intend to continue to watch the Mo∣tion of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>, whilst the Prince of <HI>Oran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> with his Army shall besiege <HI>Journey</HI>, and his Excellency, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is said, with our <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops, shall at the same time besiege <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nard</HI>. These
<PB N="123" REF="176"/>
are our general Discourses here, grounded upon the great Preparation his Excellency is making to draw his Troops together from all Parts, there being in the several Provinces at least fifteen thou∣sand Peasants summon'd in with their Arms, the greatest part of which are to be made use of as Pioneers. The most of our Forces are drawn from <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>St. Omer</HI>, and are gone for <HI>Ypre</HI>, whilst the Country Militia is drawn into those two Pla∣ces for their present Security, there being no E∣nemy like to attempt them.</P>
<P>On Saturday last all the Peasants from about <HI>Louvain, Tirtlemont, Diest</HI>, and those Parts, with their Proportions of Waggons, came in hither, and are marched from hence towards <HI>Gaunt</HI>, all their Waggons being filled with Ammunition, Spades, Pick Axes, and all other Materials for a Siege. Those from <HI>Malines</HI> and <HI>Antwerp</HI> are like∣wise gone to <HI>Dermond</HI>, as also those from the <HI>Pay de Waes</HI>; and by this means the poor Country is so drained of their Inhabitants, that there are not lest sufficient to till their Land; so that the greatest part will lie waste this Year. A Famine in all Appearance being like to succeed this War, as well as Sickness, which has begun already in many of our Garrisons.</P>
<P>Yesterday seven Companies of the Prince <HI>de B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de</HI>'s Regiment of <HI>Germans</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Louvain</HI>, and marched from thence to <HI>Malines</HI>, where they are to be transported with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiment towards <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI>; his Excellency using all Diligence to get fifteen or sixteen thousand Men together out of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Garrisons, besides his Troops already in <HI>Hat∣na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>, that he may no longer lie under the Cen∣sure of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and General <HI>Souches</HI>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not having his alotted Number of Men accor∣ding
<PB N="124" REF="177"/>
to his Agreement, the want of which they seem much to regret.</P>
<P>We hear the Imperialists have made great In∣cursions into <HI>France</HI>, committing all the barbarous Cruelties that could be expected from the worst of Enemies, not only burning all Places they could master, but killing all Persons they could find, without Exception of Age or Sex. That this last Week they went as far as St. <HI>Quintin</HI>, near which Place they took a Castle, after some Resistance, where some Persons of Quality were retired for their Security, whom they killed, vio∣lating all the Women, and then set Fire to it, and burnt it to the Ground. That for ten Leagues together there is neither Man, Woman, or Child to be seen in those Parts. These and many o∣ther the like sad Relations we have from the Camp, there being nothing else done but ruining the whole Country; and because we yet think we have not enough to do it effectually, we are told that fifteen thousand more <HI>Germans</HI> are co∣ming towards us, who perhaps may come time e∣nough to make this poor Country their Winter Quarters, which will this Year be entirely ruin'd.</P>
<P>To behold our Nobility and Gentry here is now really a sad Spectacle, they being become heartless, seeing no Appearance of any thing but Desolation to their Country, and that by those from whom they expected Relief. And as to our talking of Sieges, it's look'd upon by many as a Romance, since either we do not really in∣tend it, or else defer it too long; and truly, I am in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lined to believe we shall do little or nothing this Campaign, the best Officers the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI> has being still useless by their Wounds.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="178"/>I am certainly inform'd that the Imperial Ar∣my is not at this present above fifteen thousand Combatants, and yet they will have the Continu∣ance of sixty thousand Rations of Bread each Day, of which there is already so great want in the Camp, that though they are in the best Pro∣vince of the Country yet they must be supply'd by a Convoy from hence; by which it may ea∣sily be judged in what Condition we are to be∣gin a Campaign in an Enemies Country, when our Armies cannot find Subsistence in that plenti∣ful Country by our own Garrisons.</P>
<P>There is certainly some evil Angel supervises our Affairs here, or else it were impossible things should be so strangely managed; and with all this, his Excellency seems no more concern'd, than if this Country were in the greatest Pro∣sperity; and nothing is buzz'd into our Ears by the Court-Flies but the present besieging two Pla∣ces at once, one being too little for their victo∣rious Armies; but if we make no quicker Progress with these Sieges than our Confederates do with their Siege of <HI>Grave</HI>, I am afraid we shall then make but a sad end of this Campaign. From which Camp I am told, by Letters of the 1<SUP>st</SUP> instant, that their Attacks go on as slowly as ever, and the <HI>Holland</HI> Resident said Yesterday, That 'till they had five thousand more Foot, there was little Expectation of doing much good upon it.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Charleroy</HI>, that Monsieur <HI>Mon∣talt</HI> is past all Danger, and so well recovered as to walk in his Chamber; his Troops rove much about the Country, and take great Boo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. On Saturday last a Party from thence took
<PB N="126" REF="179"/>
all the Baggage of Marquess <HI>Conflans</HI>, going from thence after him to <HI>Namur</HI>, where he com∣mands at present, the Governor of that Place be∣ing so indisposed that he is unable to take Care of it.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with his Army is in∣camped on the other side the <HI>Sambre</HI> near <HI>Maubeux</HI>, waiting the Motions of our Armies. Some say he is reinforced with fresh Troops; but we will as little believe that, as that his most Christian Majesty is like to do any great Matters with his Arrierban, who, we say, will not pass out of their own Territories. So that we and our Allies shall have the Pleasure to destroy our own Country without the Assistance of our Enemies.</P>
<P>And if we can take two or three Places before the end of this Campaign, we shall then assured∣ly have the Substance of the late Victory, though the <HI>French</HI> have it, as yet, in Appearance.</P>

<P>EVer since I had the Honour to be known to your Lordship, you have been pleas'd to look down upon me with a favourable Eye; but your Honour has lately made this appear by great Effects, by so far advancing me in his Majesty's good Opinion, as to protect me by his Royal Hand in appropriating me to his Service, there∣by to secure me from that Danger of which I had no great Apprehensions, being so wholly concern'd in doing that Service imposed upon me by your Lordship, that I had not time to think whether I was in danger or not. However by your Lordship's Interposition and Favour, I am not only secured from any thing of that kind, but am also thereby inabled to have more full and ample Relations from the Fountain head, than before I gathered sometimes from broken Ci∣sterns. And I shall now use such Diligence to understand all Affairs both Military and Civil, that I will continually write what is done, ma∣king a Journal of all remarkable Passages here, which I presume will not be unsatisfactory to your Lordship.</P>

<P>ON Tuesday Night Lieutenant General <HI>Agour∣to</HI> came hither from the Camp with Two thousand Horse and Five hundred Dragoons, who were that Night encamped without the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anders</HI> Port; three Horse were commanded
<PB N="129" REF="182"/>
out of each Troop, <HI>Spaniards, Germans</HI> and <HI>Dutch. Agourto</HI> was all that Night with his Excellency and Monsieur <HI>la Motte</HI>, till Five in the Morning that he was sent to his Troops to march with them to <HI>Asch</HI> in the way to <HI>Alost</HI>, where he had Orders to stay till Midnight to refresh his Men, and then to pursue his March according to his Instructions. That Evening about Six came an Express from the Camp to advertise his Excel∣lency, that the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops had pass'd the River at <HI>Pont al Hayn</HI> the Day before, and that the Prince and General <HI>Souches</HI> had that Morning decamped, and jointly pass'd the River upon Bridges laid over for that purpose, having alter'd it seems their former Re∣solutions of dividing their Armies. Hereupon his Excellency forthwith dispatched Monsieur <HI>la Motte</HI> after Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> to hasten his March, and that from thence he should go to <HI>Dermond</HI> and <HI>Gaunt</HI> to hasten those Regiments, and to see the Boors put in order, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ves∣sels, with the great Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be drawn up towards <HI>Gaunt</HI>.</P>

The Regiment of <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nosa</HI> was about Nine hundred, <HI>Montalto</HI> Six hundred, and <HI>Belvidere</HI> Five hundred. The Boors were drawn up in six Battallions, and were inten∣ded for Five hundred in each Battallion, but wan∣ted of that number. There was Four hundred Waggons upon the King's Account, besides those that march'd with the Regiments, and belong'd to the Officers, and two great Mortars, but no Cannon; great store of Granades, and all Mate∣rials for a Siege; they march'd directly towards <HI>Alost</HI>, and I believe will this Night encamp about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The Marquis <HI>d' Ossera</HI> march'd with them and c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmands all in chief: I am told that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Regiment of <HI>Aldade</HI>, the Duke <HI>d' Avery, Copeny Duffey</HI> and a <HI>German</HI> Regiment, with about Fou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thousand Boors are to meet them to morrow a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Alost</HI>, and the next Day some more from <HI>Gaunt</HI> There was not one Troop of Horse that march with them this Day.</P>

<HI>Valenchiennes</HI> to <HI>Conde</HI> for reinforcing their Garri∣sons, lest the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> in the absence of the Armies should attack any of them: That the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was not then moved, but conti∣nued in his Station upon the <HI>Sambre:</HI> That the same Morning old Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> was brought in sick from the Camp to <HI>Valenchiennes</HI>, not being able to march with the Army.</P>
<P>Our <HI>German</HI> Letters say, that the <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Troops are marching this way, bending their Course towards the <HI>Meuse</HI>; and that upon their arrival there, his Electoral Highness will consider what is fit to be farther done in order to the ge∣neral Interest of the Confederates; and 'tis said after the taking <HI>Grave</HI>, which 'tis suppos'd will be within few Days, that that Army shall attend about those Quarters to join the Electoral Troops, and either sit down before <HI>Maestricht</HI>, or march towards <HI>France</HI> on the other side the <HI>Maese</HI>.

And to prevent their Subsistence in the <HI>French</HI> Conquests, strict Orders have been some time since sent from the <HI>French</HI> Garrisons to all the Towns and Villa∣ges round, to send in all their Provisions of Corn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Forrage into the next adjacent <HI>French</HI> Garri∣sons, reserving only for their present Subsistence; upon Penalty of having all that remains burnt; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prosecution of which the Marquis <HI>d' Ancre</HI> Governour of <HI>Aeth</HI> has caused the Towns of <HI>Les∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> and <HI>Chieure</HI>, with the rich Abby of <HI>Chambre</HI>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burnt to the Ground, because the Boors had
<PB N="132" REF="185"/>
carried in great Stores of Corn thither, and not into his Garrison according to his Orders.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tournay</HI> they are very apprehensive of a Siege, and have therefore published strict Orders, requi∣ring all Burghers upon Pain of Death not to stir out of their Houses in case of a Siege; and that their Wives and Maid-Servants shall have liberty each Day to go out for two Hours to buy Provi∣sions and Necessaries for their Families, but not to be out any longer.</P>
<P>At <HI>Courtray</HI>, it's said, the Governour and In∣tendant have proffer'd to quit that Town, if the Burghers would give such a considerable Sum as they demanded, but that the Magistrates abso∣lutely refused to make any such Agreement. It's generally reported that <HI>Oudenard</HI> is very well mann'd, and wants nothing necessary for a Siege; but it's said here 'tis impossible to keep it, the Hill that is near it commanding it intirely on that side.</P>
<P>By a Gentleman come this Night hither from the Siege of <HI>Grave</HI>, which he left three Day since, I am inform'd, that he thought it not i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any great likelihood of being so suddenly take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as is here spoken.

<P>WE are informed by my Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI>, who came from the Camp before <HI>Grave</HI> on Wednesday last, that the Besiegers were then lodged at the Foot of the Glacis of the Counter∣scarp: That General <HI>Rabenhaut</HI> having but a small Army of Twelve thousand Men, thinks not fit to attack the Place by Force, to the hazard of his Army, the Place being very small, and many Men to defend it; and therefore he goes the surer though the longer way, and has now so closed it up, and has so strong a Line of Contravallation, that it is impossible either for Relief to enter, or the Besieged to sally.</P>

<P>His Lordship says, there has been a great Over∣sight committed by the <HI>French</HI>, in not breaking down the great Dyke that was betwixt the Town and River, whereby the Besiegers could have made no Lodgment there without much Loss, who are now lodged there in much Security.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam Ballandine</HI> having lately brought over six Companies of Foot from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Bol∣duc</HI>, went on <HI>Tuesday</HI> last to pay his Respects to General <HI>Rab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhaut</HI>, and after that would in Cu∣riosity go down to the <HI>Meuse</HI>-side to see the Approaches and the Fort which the <HI>French</HI> had blown up and quitted, which he enter'd; and in his Return back he was kill'd with a Canon shot, which hit him in the back, took away the greatest Part of his Body▪ leaving his Head and Arms hanging by a little Skin; his Heart was sound intire some Paces from the Place; there was a Lieutenant also kiss'd with him; the remaining Part of his Body was taken up and convey'd to <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lduc</HI>, and there interred.</P>
<P>This Afternoon another Gentleman is come from <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI>, who lest it on <HI>Friday</HI> last, and says, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the States had sent positive Orders to Gene∣ral <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhaut</HI> to make as quick a Dispatch of that Work as was possible; and that he should pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed with his Attacks more vigorously that he had done hitherto; and that the General was resolv'd to proceed accordingly, hoping to be Master of it in ten Days. But my Lord <HI>Castle¦haven</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="188"/>
says, no Judgment can be made when the Town will be taken, it depending upon their Wants within, not the Force without; and that when he left it, the General himself thought he did a great Work, if he became Master of it in a Month's time; hoping by that time some one necessary thing would be wanting, which would enforce them to a Surrender.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, with the three Confede∣rate Armies, hath besieged <HI>Oudenard</HI>, and on Sun∣day opened their Trenches: The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI>, with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, is posted at the Abby of <HI>Enam</HI>, on that Side towards <HI>Gaunt</HI>; and 'tis said that <HI>Aldado</HI>, with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, hath at∣tacked and taken a Redoubt: That the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army are posted on that side towards <HI>Courtray</HI> and <HI>Lille</HI>, and the <HI>Germans</HI> towards <HI>Aeth</HI> and <HI>Tournay</HI>, being encamped along the River from <HI>Potts</HI> to <HI>Oudenard</HI>. We are told, that it was resolv'd so soon as this Siege was form'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> should with his Army besiege <HI>Courtray</HI>, the reducing of both which Places are esteem'd here to be only a Work of eight Days, and after that they would fall upon some more considera∣ble Siege: But the moving of the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> has alter'd those Resolutions, and will cause their Armies to draw closer together, lest the Prince should take them again at the same Advantage. He pass'd the <HI>Sambre</HI> with his Army the 14<SUP>th</SUP>, and (as our Letters from <HI>Mons</HI> say) marched to <HI>Quesnoy</HI>, and from thence bended his March be∣twixt <HI>Bouchain</HI> and <HI>Valenciennes</HI>, passing the River at the Village of <HI>Denning</HI>, a League from <HI>Bou∣chain</HI>; that from thence he marched towards <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI>, and pass'd that River at <HI>Pout de Rash</HI>▪ We will not believe here that he is above Twenty

That for his part, he will go no more to the Camp; that all his Employment is to be their Providore; that he has now sent them Bread and Meat for twenty Days for all their Armies; and that having furnished them with what they desi∣red both as to Men, Ammunition and Provisions, it shall be no more his Fault but theirs, if they proceed not vigorously, and make a great Ad∣vance into <HI>France</HI>, since he knows the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with all his Supplies will not be able to make Head against them.

<SALUTE><HI>Right Honourable,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN pursuance of my Duty and your Commands, I am to give your Honour a particular Ac∣count concerning the Business of our Merchant's Ships at <HI>Ostend</HI>. On Saturday Monsieur <HI>Christine</HI>, whom his Excellency sent thither as Commissary to examine that Matter return'd, and on Sunday in the Evening gave his Excellency an Account. The Consul came with him, accompanied with two or three <HI>English</HI> Merchants in behalf of the rest. Yesterday I gave a Visit to Monsieur <HI>Chri∣stine</HI> to know from him how that Affair stood, which I judged necessary for the expediting of it, at least that I might have so much light from him, as might in able me to give your Honour a true State of that Business.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="192"/>The Commissary told me he had examin'd the Matter, and taken full Information of it, but would not undertake of himself to judge it, there being so great Contests on both sides, those of <HI>Ostend</HI> pretending as much Right to detain the Ships, as the Merchants to have them releas'd. That he had given his Excellency a faithful Re∣lation of the whole, which his Excellency had again referred to the Council of State to adjust, and give their Opinions therein, and desir'd I would have Patience for some few Days, and the Business would be ended to his Majesty's Satisfa∣ction. I told him, that Delays herein would be the Ruin of his Majesty's Subjects that were con∣cern'd; and that if there were not a timely Sa∣tisfaction given, his Majesty would be necessita∣ted to take other Measures, and give his Subjects leave to right themselves; to which he reply'd, that I might rest confident there would be no such Occasion.</P>
<P>I then demanded what he had done concerning <HI>Bartelet</HI> and <HI>Johnson</HI>, those two insolent Privateers, who had committed that unheard of Outrage upon his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Wolwich</HI> Sloop; to which he told me, the first of them was Prisoner in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>, where his Majesty might do Justice upon him, and the other was Prisoner in <HI>France</HI>, which was all the Answer I had from him; and Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> confirms to me, that they are both taken, and that he has given your Honour an Account of it.</P>
<P>Yesterday at Court the Burgomaster and Bai∣list of <HI>Ostend</HI>, with two more of their Magistrates came to me, and told me, they were impower'd from the Capers to hinder releasing the <HI>English</HI> Merchants Ships. We had a warm Discourse to∣gether, wherein they seem'd much incensed that
<PB N="140" REF="193"/>
his Excellency had discharged the <HI>Flying Hare</HI> without their being heard, and said there was one thousand five hundred Seamen in <HI>Ostend</HI> ready to rise in Arms upon it, and to fall upon the <HI>En∣glish</HI>, but that they prevented them; that howe∣ver, one of them with a Knife had violently assaul∣ted one of that Ship, and had sorely wounded him in the Face, which they could not prevent. They told me farther, that in case his Excellency discharged the other <HI>English</HI> Vessels without their being heard, they would appeal to the Queen Regent; and enlarged very much what Certifica∣tions they had brought up to prove these Ships were lawful Prize, with many things of that kind. And I do find that they are highly recommended and seconded by the Governors of <HI>Ostend</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI>, who go Shares with them; and by this means have made many of the Great Ones here their Friends. And I understand from <HI>Antwerp</HI>, that they have Bills of Exchange there for twen∣ty thousand Guilders, to be disposed in Bribes, for making friends in this Business, which makes me doubt we shall find Delays, unless his Excel∣lency be farther quickened by Letters.</P>
<P>The Resident of <HI>Holland</HI> had this Day much Discourse with me concerning them, and shew'd me Copies of several sharp Letters written by the States to his Excellency upon the Detention of several of their Ships, and assures me that he has Orders from his Majesty to tell his Excellency, That if a timely Remedy be not put to their In∣solencies, they shall not only be necessitated to grant L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Reprizal, but to send four or five Men o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> War to block them up. If his Excel∣lency had appeared this Day we had both moved him in it, but to Morrow we intend to do it, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="141" REF="194"/>
which I shall give your Honour a farther Account by the next Orders.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> has likewise promised me a Certifi∣cate of the Assault that was made upon the Ma∣ster of the <HI>Flying Hare</HI>, and of the Threats they have publish'd of cutting the Throat of the Con∣sul, and all the <HI>English</HI> that are there; insomuch that they are in Danger of their Lives for Pro∣secution of this Business, whereby your Honour may judge in what Condition his Majesty's Sub∣jects will be in, if these Violences be conniv'd at. I intend to morrow to give his Excellency a Memorial of it, and shall give your Honour an Account of what Answer I have.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>May it please your Lordship,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving receiv'd Notice from my Brother, of your Honour's Voyage to <HI>Holland</HI>, and of your Commands that I should send your Lordship constant Advertisement of all Occurrences here; in Complyance of which, and of my Duty to your Honour, I presume to give this Trouble.</P>
<P>At present little can be expected from hence, the Prospect of this Theatre being much changed since the Armies removal from these Provinces. That which gives the most Occasion of Discourse here, is your Lordship's Journey into <HI>Holland</HI>, which his Excellency says he knows to be in or∣der to a Peace and Marriage, but he is well assu∣red their League is so firm and steady, that he presumes all Endeavours of that kind will be fruit∣less 'till after the next Campaign, and that he believes his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will not be induced to think of a Marriage 'till an honourable and lasting Peace be made, which cannot be reasonably expected in the broken Con∣dition their Affairs here now stand. However, the Grandees here are of Opinion they shall have a Peace, since they see the States inclined to it; and indeed, the Poverty which this Country is reduc'd to, join'd with the Experience of the ill Management of the War, has much mollified the Affections of the most warlike among them; so that there is great Hope this high and Christian Work of his Mediation may in due time have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Issue.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="196"/>General <HI>Spork</HI> is still besieging <HI>Dinant</HI>, from whence we are every Hour in Expectation to hear of its surrender. The Burgomaster, with many of the principal Citizens, have sav'd themselves and are retired, some to <HI>Namur</HI> where they are imprisoned, some to <HI>Liege</HI>, and others to <HI>Philip∣ville</HI>. It is said here, that four hundred <HI>French</HI> are in the Castle, and that there is Plenty of both Provision and Ammunition, but that it is not for∣tifyed, depending only upon its Situation, which towards the Town is very strong, but on the Land side not. The Cannons shot very hard Monday and Tuesday, but not having been heard since Yesterday, many conclude it taken, and if so, it's said they intend in the next Place to reduce the Castle of <HI>Bouillon</HI>, and from thence, if they succeed, it's thought they will march towards <HI>Liege</HI> taking Advantage of their Commotion; and when they have taken these three Places, it will be near time to go to their Winter-Quarters, without advancing towards <HI>Triers</HI> as they say they will before they end their Campaign.</P>
<P>We hear that a Party sent out from the Gar∣risons of <HI>Ayre</HI> and <HI>St. Omer</HI> into <HI>Boulongnois</HI>, to raise Contribution, rencountred with four hun∣dred <HI>French</HI> belonging to <HI>Ardres</HI>, which the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Troops defeated, and brought in two hun∣dred Prisoners to <HI>St. Omer:</HI> This was warmly re∣ported here this Day at Court, but I think it needs a farther Confirmation.</P>
<P>The States of <HI>Flanders</HI> have not yet come to a Conclusion in Point of their Subsidies, two of the four Members are come hither to represent to his Excellency the Difficulties they find in it, and to take some farther Directions from his Excellency for adjusting that Matter; and 'till
<PB N="144" REF="197"/>
that be finished, his Excellency will not go to <HI>Antwerp</HI>, nor press the States of this Province, 'till he sees a good Issue of that in <HI>Flanders</HI>.</P>
<P>Upon Sunday Morning Count <HI>d'Ursel</HI>, by his Excellency's Appointment, parted hence for <HI>Ma∣drid</HI>, attended with a handsom Train, and with twenty of his Excellency's Guards for a Convoy as far as <HI>Cambray</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro Ronquillos</HI> is suddenly expected here, having receiv'd Orders to hasten his Journey, and be dispatched for <HI>England</HI> by his Excellency in a few Days after his Arrival here.</P>
<P>We are every Moment in Expectation of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Orders, by whom we shall know the Cer∣tainty either of his Excellency's Stay or Depar∣ture; many are of Opinion that he will sudden∣ly leave this Government, which he has much so∣licited, in hopes of being made one of the Great Council at <HI>Madrid</HI>. The Name of our new Ma∣ster de Camp General is also expected in these Letters, and who shall be Governor of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Namur</HI>, the Prince of <HI>Barbanson</HI> not be∣ing owned by his Excellency 'till he has receiv'd a new Confirmation from <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>This is all which is stirring as to the publick Affairs here, except the Business of our Ships at <HI>Ostend</HI>, which I likewise think my Duty to give your Lordship an Account of in this following Relation.</P>
<P>By a Letter of the 2<SUP>d</SUP> Instant, <HI>S. V.</HI> from Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI>, I receiv'd Commands to in∣form my self of his Excellency and chief Mini∣sters here, whether they made any Scruple of owning the Treaty of 67 at <HI>Madrid</HI>, which Com∣mand was occasion'd by an Advertisement I gave his Honour of what I heard the Audientiary say
<PB N="145" REF="198"/>
concerning it, That it was a Peace never pub∣lished.</P>
<P>According to Mr. Secretary's Commands, on Sunday last, I address'd my self to his Excellen∣cy, and took Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> the Consul with me to hear his Excellency's Answer. I told his Excel∣lency, that understanding the Papers and Process concerning the detaining our Ships being now come from <HI>Ostend</HI> hither, we had some Hopes of having an Issue of that Business which had been so long delayed, to the great Damage of His Ma∣jesty's Subjects, and consequently to his Majesty's no small Displeasure; that it was now seasona∣ble to have a Rule set by which all Parties were to govern themselves in this Affair, and that ac∣cordingly I had receiv'd Orders in His Majesty's Name to stick close to the Treaty of 67, which was to be the Rule in the Decision of this Busi∣ness. And that therefore I thought it necessary (for the gaining of Time, and preventing all Dis∣putes that might otherwise arise,) to desire his Excellency to send an Order to the High Court of Admiralty here, (who were to be Judges in this Business) to make that Treaty the Rule in the judging of these Ships, and that such Order from his Excellency might be registred, of which I might have an Authentick Copy to send to Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI>, for His Majesty's Satisfa∣ction, and for Discharge of my Duty. To this his Excellency answered, That the Papers were now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me which he would transmit to the Admiralty, That he was very sorry the Business had been so long delayed, That he most confess those of <HI>O∣stend</HI> were the greatest Knaves in the World▪ and that he did verily believe, when he should have this Government, if they could catch him at Sea,
<PB N="146" REF="199"/>
they would throw him over-board: And many more sharp Expressions he made against them. But, in fine, when he came to the Point of the Treaty, he told us, It was a Treaty they had ne∣ver seen or heard of, neither was it ever sent hi∣ther by the Queen, or any Orders about it; and that it was absolutely necessary that Letters should be forthwith written to our Ambassador at <HI>Ma∣drid</HI>, to procure the Queen's Order hither for their owning that Treaty, and governing themselves in all things accordingly, and said that he had al∣ready written to that purpose; that in the mean time the Business should go on, which was all he could do to put them in a way of Justice, and that if any <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships were taken in <HI>England</HI> they must be released by the ordinary Form of Justice. To this I reply'd, That I presum'd his Excellency was misinform'd in this Business, for that it would evidently appear that those of <HI>Ostend</HI> had taken notice of that Treaty of 67; for that most of the Ships that had been taken (as I was inform'd by the Consul there present) were taken by vertue of the fourteenth Article of that Trea∣ty, for want of Passeports as that Article direct∣ed; and if they made use of one Article for our Disadvantage, we had reason to expect Liberty to make use of the other Articles in our Favour; that if the Treaty was not sent hither, nor pub∣lished, it was the Fault of the Ministers at <HI>Ma¦drid</HI>, and could make nothing to the Prejudic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Treaty which was ratifyed, nor to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prejudice of his Majesty's Subjects who had tra¦ded to <HI>France</HI> under Security of that Treaty, an that therefore I was commanded to stick to the Treaty, and must pretend against all Proceeding in this Business that were contrary to it. Her
<PB N="147" REF="200"/>
upon his Excellency told me, I had best to speak with those Ministers that were the proper Jud∣ges of this Matter, whereupon I went with Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> the same Day to the President of the Coun∣cil, who was directly of the same Opinion as his Excellency, but said, he had not the proper Cognizance of it. But the President of the High Court of Admiralty, Monsieur <HI>Blondel</HI>, with whom we likewise discoursed the Matter, and desired to know by what Method he would pro∣ceed, and whether he would not make the Treaty of 67 the Rule? which he seem'd altogether in∣clin'd to, and said he knew of no other way to determine the Matter, and so soon as the Papers came to his Hands he would send them to two Counsellors to report, and when the Matter was ready we should have notice.</P>
<P>On Monday his Excellency sent the Papers to Monsieur <HI>Blondel</HI>, and he has chosen out four of the Process, and has given them to two Counsel∣lors to report; and upon their Report we shall know what farther Measures to take, and if I find they will not admit of the Treaty, I shall immediately dispatch an Express to Mr. Secreta∣ry to give him an Account of it, it being a Business of great Consequence, and that timely notice be given of it.</P>
<P>I knew not what Judgment to make of this as yet, but I am much afraid we shall meet with many Difficulties, the Capers having made great Interest by their Bribes, which they give out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Monies of his Majesty's Subjects, and are very free of other Mens Purses. I see them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aily plying here several of the great Men and Favourites, and know they will leave no Stone <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nmov'd to carry away what they have gotten.
<PB N="148" REF="201"/>
And I am assur'd by some of the Merchants here who are concern'd, that the Value of the several Ships and Lading, which they have now taken at <HI>Ostend</HI>, amount to sixteen hundred thou∣sand Guilders, and that they have sold the La∣ding of most of the Ships, and that the Charges the Merchants have been daily at, since their stopping at <HI>Ostend</HI>, comes to at least fifteen hun∣dred Guilders <HI>per Diem</HI>.</P>
<P>This is the full Account of what has passed, in relation to this Business, wherein I have per∣form'd my Duty with the greatest Care I could according to my weak Apprehensions, humbly submitting it to your Lordship's favourable Cen∣sure. And now having sufficiently wearied your Lordship with this tedious Relation, I shall end your present Trouble by throwing my self low at your Lordship's Feet, subscribing my self with all imaginable Zeal and Duty,</P>

<P>THE <HI>Spanish</HI> Ordinary which came on Thurs∣day Night brought nothing as to his Ex∣cellency's sudden leaving this Government, <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> being not yet resolv'd as to his coming. In the mean time, no Master de Camp General is named, as was expected, but it's said that if <HI>Don Juan</HI> come, the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo∣sa</HI> shall have a Complement made him to be Go∣vernour of Arms, the better to induce his Stay, who has demanded his Conge of the Queen, but it is not yet granted. It's written privately, that the Queen has some Inclinations to make the Duke <HI>d' Arembergh</HI> Master de Camp General, whose Pulse has been felt therein, and 'tis said he will accept of the Charge, if offered. He is at present here, and that which gives much oc∣casion of Discourse, is his Excellency's making a very extraordinary Court to him, more than he has been seen to do to any Person whatsoever; and that which makes the more notice taken of it, is, because there was so very ill a Correspon∣dence lately between them. The Queen has not yet disposed of the Government of the Province of <HI>Namur</HI>, there being so many Pretenders to it that it is not known who will carry it.</P>
<P>It's said Count <HI>d'Ursel</HI> is in Election of be∣ing made Captain of the Guard of Archers, if the Place of the late Marquess <HI>Tirloon</HI>, and that that Charge will be confirm'd upon him a <HI>Madrid</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="204"/>From the Confederate Armies near <HI>Strasburgh</HI> it's written, That Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> still conti∣nues his Camp, and that both Armies are watch∣ing each other, and that which can hold out lon∣gest is like to be Master of the Field.</P>
<P>On Friday his Excellency had notice, by Ex∣press, of the taking <HI>Dinant</HI> Town and Castle, which happen'd sooner than they could have i∣magined, and by an Accident they little expected. The Place being entred by fifty <HI>Spaniards</HI> who were only employ'd about taking a small part of the Suburbs, whilst the <HI>Germans</HI> were battering the Walls: And it seems those of the Garrison that were in the Suburbs being in some Disorder, two of the principal <HI>French</HI> Commanders came out of the Town to make good their Retreat into it, who being both killed in the Action, the <HI>French</HI> retired in great Disorder, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fol∣low'd so close, that immediately a Parley was sounded, and soon after both Town and Castle surrendred upon Capitulations that the <HI>French</HI> should march away with Bag and Baggage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all the Ligeois Prisoners of War, and the late Governor who surpriz'd it from the <HI>Germans</HI>.</P>
<P>It's said that General <HI>Spork</HI> has sent part of his Army towards <HI>Thuin</HI>, to try if he can reduce that strong Place, which would be of great Conse∣quence to the incommoding of <HI>Charleroy</HI>. 'Tis also said that he will next attempt <HI>Bouillon</HI>, and then advance towards <HI>Treves</HI>, unless the Commo∣tions at <HI>Liege</HI> may encourage his going that way. We do here confidently affirm that <HI>Treves</HI> is at least closely blocked up, if not formally besieged; though at the same time others say, That Mon∣sieur <HI>Turenne</HI> has sent thither two thousand five hundred Men, who are entred into it; which, if
<PB N="152" REF="205"/>
true, the reducing that Place may prove a Work of Time; but if those Recruits are shut out, they make no question of reducing it suddenly. It is written also from <HI>Germany</HI>, that both <HI>Philipsburgh</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ck</HI> are much streighten'd by the Post which the Confederates have taken round about them.</P>
<P>We talk here as if the <HI>French</HI> King had some Thoughts of coming e'er long to <HI>Nancy</HI>, to be near <HI>Alsace</HI> and <HI>Burgundy</HI>, and to be ready to assist Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> upon any Occasion; and that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> will at the same time come towards <HI>Douay</HI>, and those Parts; but we have no Cer∣tainty of this, but only Surmises.</P>
<P>Count <HI>de Rasch</HI> is by his Excellency appointed to go suddenly to <HI>Ypres</HI> to command there in the place of Baron <HI>de Rock</HI>, who comes hither, and shall command at <HI>Louvain</HI>.</P>
<P>Yesterday being his Excellency's Birth-day there was a great Solemnity at Court, which ended at Night in a Ball for the Divertisement of the Ladies.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Philip Bassigny</HI> has been very ill of a Fever, but is now pretty well; I gave him this Evening a Visit▪ and found him in his Bed, but much better than he was: His Brother Count <HI>Bas∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gny</HI> who was with him, told me they had both intentions of kissing your Lordship's Hands in <HI>Holland</HI> before your Return, if his Brother's Health would permit. Count <HI>Philip</HI> told me your Lord∣ship was sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely arriv'd, which I was very glad to hear, the Winds having been very stormy and con∣trary since your Lordship's Imbarcation.</P>
<P>This is all that has occurr'd here since my last, worth your Lordship's Knowledge, and I shall not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to give your Honour a constant Account of

all Passages here whilst your Lordship continues in <HI>Holland</HI>.</P>
<P>As to the Business of our Ships, on Saturday the Lords of the Admiralty met upon it the first time, and have taken into Consideration the <HI>George</HI> of <HI>London</HI>, and the <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Yarmouth</HI>, which are two Ships of great Consideration, and both taken by virtue of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> Article of the Treaty of 1667 for want of Passports; and according as they shall determine upon those, we shall be able to give a Judgment of all the rest; but these Proceedings are so slow, that they dishearten all that follow the Business: The President tells me that the Business of these two Ships will take up their time for four or five Days; and I am told that they will not give a Judgment upon any, till they have heard all the Cases depending. Many of the Papers and Process are still behind at <HI>Ostend</HI>; but I have moved his Excellency there∣in, who has now sent an Express for all the rest. I have been with the President and the Counsel∣lors to desire their Dispatch of this Business, ur∣ging the great Consequence of it, and the prodi∣gious Charge our Merchants are at in their Prose∣cution, besides the Loss they must needs suffer in their perishable Goods, though their Ships should be deliver'd. They tell me that Satisfaction shall be given to the last Farthing, where their Seizure cannot be justified, and that no Business shall interfere till this be dispatched; of the daily Progress they make therein I shall not fail to give your Lordship a particular Account, and of whatever else may be worth your Honour's Notice.</P>

<P>HIS Excellency being much unsatisfied with the unusual Delays made by the States in <HI>Flanders</HI> concerning their Subsidies for the Year ensuing, has thereupon thought necessary for re∣moving all Difficulties, and bringing that Matter to a speedy Issue, which is of so great Conse∣quence for carrying on the War, to send for those States hither, and accordingly they are all expe∣cted here this Night. <HI>(viz.)</HI> two Abbots for the Ecclesiasticks, two Deputies for <HI>Bruges</HI>, two for the <HI>Free</HI>, two for <HI>Gaunt</HI>, and two for <HI>Ypres</HI>; and till these have adjusted their Proportions for <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>, all the other Provinces are at a stand. The true Reason of this their long Delay, is the great Pove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty that Province is really reduced to; so that when they have adjusted their Quota's, they
<PB N="155" REF="208"/>
know not which way to raise the Money, this War having brought such Misery upon them, which has made them much inclinable to Peace, if an honourable one may be procur'd.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> goes in few Days for <HI>Spain</HI>, in relation to the Affairs of this Country as well as for his own particular Concerns, ha∣ving receiv'd a Passport from <HI>France</HI> for his free Passage.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Liege</HI>, that General <HI>Spork</HI> has sent thither to demand Quarter there for five Regi∣ments of his Army this Winter; and that unless they will admit it, he will endeavour to force them. It's said, that he has detached Three thou∣sand Men towards <HI>Treves</HI>, and that he will en∣deavour to reduce <HI>Bouillon</HI> and <HI>Thuin</HI>, the last of which will much incommode <HI>Charleroy</HI>; but we think it will not so easily be taken as <HI>Dinant</HI>. If he have Success in those Places, he will then make Incursions into the <HI>French</HI> Territories, and Winter-quarter upon their Borders.</P>
<P>His Excellency has this Day receiv'd Letters from <HI>Germany</HI>, by which he is assured that the greatest part of the Confederates Armies are mar∣ching towards <HI>Burgundy</HI>, thereby to oblige Mon∣sieur <HI>Turenne</HI> to decamp. By the same Letters his Excellency hath receiv'd some Advice in relation to <HI>Burgundy</HI>, with which he is much pleas'd, not doubting but that a considerable Design now in hand will suddenly take Effect, which will prove much to the Advantage of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Interest and their Allies.</P>
<P>There is nothing here more worthy your Lord∣ship<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Notice, but what the inclosed Paper will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Honour; and therefore I shall end your

<P>ON Friday Morning being inform'd by Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> the Consul, that he had the Night before been serv'd with an Order by the Court of Admi∣ralty here in the Case of the <HI>George</HI> of <HI>London</HI>; we thereupon went to consult with Council therein, who much wondring at the unusual Se∣verity thereof, advised I should that Day present a Memorial to his Excellency, which I did accor∣dingly, and took Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> with me. I acquain∣ted his Excellency with the Strangeness of such Proceedings, that the Court of Admiralty by an interlo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry Order should appoint the Lading of a Ship of Ten thousand Pounds Value, being all Piece Goods, and no perishable Commodities to
<PB N="157" REF="210"/>
be sold by the Capers without Caution, and be∣fore a definitive Sentence; and that neither the Parties concern'd, nor their Council had seen the Proofs, or any of their Proceedings, and there∣fore pray'd his Excellency would interpose his Authority for stopping the Sale not only of this, but of all other Ships belonging to any of his Majesty's Subjects, till a definitive Sentence had been given, and his Excellency consulted therein. And that for the Original Contract in this parti∣cular Case, of which they had an authentick Copy, we would engage it should be brought hither in fifteen Days, an Express being sent to <HI>Ostend</HI> for it. But in case upon sight of that Con∣tract the Process should go for the Owners, it would be impossible for them to have Restitution, if this Sale should be permitted, since it was well known at what Rates the Capers us'd to sell, and that no more could be answer'd than for what they sold.</P>
<P>His Excellency in his Answer was very short, and something quick, and told us, that their Pro∣ceedings here were no more unusual than ours in <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd</HI>, for that there was at this time a Cap∣tain o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ostend</HI> Prisoner in <HI>England</HI>, without any legal Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess▪ and when I told him it was for an unheard of Insolency committed upon one of his Majesty's Ships, his Excellency reply<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, he should then have been sent back to him that he might h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve punished him, which was all the Answer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could get: And this Morning I have received <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Answer to my Memorial, that I should ad∣dress my self to the Court of Admiralty, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e recommended it to do Justice, as it I could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot have done that without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Recommendation. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as far <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I can reasonably judge, we are
<PB N="158" REF="211"/>
not like to find any Justice amongst them, at least it will be attended with so long Delays and great Charges, that there will be little difference be∣twixt our Merchants giving up their Ships, and seeking Relief. It being a severe Truth, that the Capers have dispers'd so much Money to make an Interest here, that they account all the Ships they have taken as much their own, as if they were condemn'd already; and 'tis more than probable that those Papers are conceal'd which should make for the Owner's Advantage, otherwise we cannot imagine upon what ground they could make this Order, the Property of that Ship (as Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> informs me) and the Lading being re∣ally prov'd to belong to <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and was taken going from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; so that by the Proceedings of this we judge all the rest lost.</P>
<P>They are this Day begun upon Mr. <HI>Graunt</HI>'s Ship that came from <HI>Tangier</HI>, and had in her be∣sides her rich Lading Forty thousand Pieces of Eight, and we make no question but they will likewise condemn her. I have sent Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> a particular Account, to give his Ma∣jesty full and true Information, and am in ex∣pectation of receiving Orders from his Honour how I shall govern my self therein. In the Inte∣rim I conceiv'd it my Duty to give your Lord∣ship this Account, that your Honour may see how Affairs go here; and I have inclosed a Copy of the Order for the Sale of the Lading, though there is also a Mistake in the Original Order, naming the Ship St. <HI>Joseph</HI> for St. <HI>George</HI>; of which if Advantage can be taken it shall not be lost.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="212"/>For News we have not much stirring: Gene∣ral <HI>Spork</HI> is at this time battering the Castle of <HI>Huy</HI>, which refuses to receive an <HI>Imperial</HI> Garri∣son; he has also put Garrisons into the Castles of <HI>Hautepene, Colonburgh</HI>, and other Castles round <HI>Liege</HI>, which gives a great Alarm to that City, fearing his coming thither after he hath reduc'd <HI>Huy</HI>.</P>
<P>This Morning the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> is gone for <HI>Madrid</HI>, and Baron <HI>de Bergeyk</HI> is hastning for <HI>England</HI> with all speed, and goes from hence this Week. His Excellency expresses a great Dissatis∣faction and Anger against <HI>Fonseca</HI> for some foolish Carriage of his in <HI>England</HI>, the Particulars he does not divulge; but he said to one in Confidence, that he had sent him a sharp Reprimand this last Post, and would be very cautious how he em∣ploy'd him for the future.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>Wargnie</HI> is made Governour of <HI>Bouchain</HI>, Marquis <HI>de Lede</HI> has his Regiment, and Monsieur <HI>Druhot</HI> the former Governour is made Governour of <HI>Ayre</HI>.</P>
<P>The last Week his Excellency sent two of the principal Magistrates of this City Prisoners to the Castle of <HI>Vilvord</HI>, for having done something in pursuance of their City-Privileges, contrary to what his Excellency had commanded, which is much resented by the Citizens; and 'tis said his Excellency will find the Effects of it, when he demands their Subsidies, which he intends to do so soon as the States of <HI>Flanders</HI> have agreed with him; in order to which the four Members of <HI>Flanders</HI> arriv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d here last Night, and have this Day presented their Proposals to his Excellency in relation to their Subsidies.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="213"/>On Wednesday his Excellency goes hence for some Days; but whether into <HI>Flanders</HI>, or first to <HI>Antwerp</HI>, I am not able to say. This Day a strict Placaert was issued, commanding all Officers of the Army upon a severe Penalty to quit this City within six Hours, and to repair immediately to their respective Charges and Garrisons, whereby 'tis judged his Excellency intends to take a Turn to view his Garrisons in <HI>Flanders</HI>.</P>

<P>YEsterday Morning early his Excellency ac∣companied in his Coach with Marquis <HI>Bur∣gemenie</HI> and my Lord <HI>Castlehaven</HI> (his two Bosom-Favourites) went for <HI>Flanders</HI>, and lay last Night at <HI>Bever</HI>, two Leagues from <HI>Antwerp</HI> in the way to <HI>Gaunt</HI>, where they are this Night, and will be absent from hence till the middle of the next Week. The publick Occasion of his Excellency's Voyage is discours'd to be, to adjust the Matter of the Subsidies in that Province for the Year en∣suing, the four Members of <HI>Flanders</HI> being thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day gone down after him. But the private Rea¦son is whisper'd to be some intended Design toward the <HI>French</HI> Conquests; and I am told in confidence
<PB N="163" REF="216"/>
that the States of <HI>Flanders</HI> have privately represen∣ted to his Excellency, that the only way for them to give him Satisfaction in the Point of the Subsi∣dies, will be to fix a Quarter in <HI>Fuerns</HI>, which is an open Place left by the <HI>French</HI>; and by possessing of it will make an Addition of Four or five thou∣sand Rations daily, and will command Contribu∣tion to the Walls of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Winnoxberg</HI>; so that it is believed his Excellency will send some Troops to take Possession of it, and make it a Winter-quarter, and that he will not return from <HI>Flanders</HI> till that business be effected.</P>
<P>This Morning Count <HI>de Rasch</HI> went towards <HI>Flanders</HI> with the Troops that were here and in the adjacent Places, and the Troops in <HI>Louvain</HI> and those Quarters are march'd towards <HI>Liege</HI> to join with Monsieur <HI>Louvigny</HI> and the <HI>Imperialists</HI>, who are in great hopes of being suddenly Masters of the City and Cittadel of <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge</HI>, and of making the Cardinal of <HI>Baden</HI> Coadjutor to the Prince</P>

<P>And we are told from <HI>Germany</HI>, that the Di∣visions amongst the Confederate Generals are in∣creased since the Retreat of Mareschal <HI>Turenne</HI>, and that the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> has abso∣lutely refused to advance any farther with his Army, as was desired by some of the others, declaring he will not ruin his Army which he may have need of at home; which Resolution has not only hindred their following Mareschal <HI>Turenne</HI>, but also their advancing into <HI>Bur∣gundy</HI>.</P>
<P>The business of our Ships goes on as it did they condemning all that come before them: That Ship wherein was the Money that cam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from <HI>Tangiers</HI>, they have not condemned, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they have given an Order to the Master to a¦gree

<P>I Am to rectifie a Mistake in my last, of Count <HI>de Rasche</HI>'s going for <HI>Flanders</HI>, he be∣ing sent to <HI>Guelders</HI> to take a Review of the Troops there and in <HI>Limburg</HI>, Monsieur <HI>Louvignie</HI> being appointed to do the like in <HI>Lutzenburg</HI>. Lieutenant General <HI>Agourto</HI> is gone to <HI>Hainault</HI> and <HI>Cambray</HI> upon the same Account, and Lieu∣tenant General <HI>Marco de Velasco</HI> is gone to <HI>St. O∣mers</HI> to review the Troops in <HI>Artois</HI>. His Excel∣lency will himself take a View of his Troops in <HI>Flanders</HI>, and the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> of this Province, whereby his Excellency may have a true Account in what Condition his Troops are, and be the better enabled to take his Measures for preparing against the next Campaign.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Flanders</HI> that his Excellency is still at <HI>Gaunt</HI>, not having yet accorded with the States for the next Year's Subsidies, wherein 'tis thought they will abate eight thousand Rations of what they paid the last Year. Before his Ex∣cellency's Return, 'tis said, he will take a turn to <HI>Ostend</HI>, to see in what Condition the great Work of the <HI>Sluce</HI> is, as also to see some Horses, a rich Coach, and a great Quantity of rich Hanging imbarked for <HI>Spain</HI>, which he is sending to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Queen Regent as a Present.</P>
<P>On Thursday Night the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ordinary arr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ved here, by whose Letters there is no Appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ance of his Excellency's leaving this Governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not of <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s coming hither; that all the
<PB N="167" REF="220"/>
Preparations in <HI>Spain</HI>, both by Land and Sea, are design'd for reducing of <HI>Messina</HI>, all that Affair being wholly remitted to the Care of <HI>Don Juan</HI>, who goes in Person into <HI>Italy</HI> Vicar General, and is to command all the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Domini∣ons there and in <HI>Sicily</HI>, for the better carrying on the War against the rebellious <HI>Messineses</HI>; that there are no Preparations for any Supplies for these Provinces, nor any Master de Camp Ge∣neral named, nor any Governor for the Province of <HI>Namur</HI>, but that Monies will be remitted hi∣ther by <HI>Christmas</HI>.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Arschott</HI> is fallen here dangerously sick of a continued violent burning Feaver, he hath been three times let Blood in the Arm, and the Feaver still continuing, he was this Morning let Blood in the Foot; the Feaver is accompany∣ed with a great Oppression of Flegm and Choler at his Stomach, and not without some ill Symp∣toms, which occasions frequent Consultations a∣mongst all the Doctors in Town.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>de Bergeyk</HI> has been something indispo∣sed these two Days, which has retarded his go∣ing for <HI>Flanders</HI>, but he now intends to depart to Morrow, and after receiving his Excellency's In∣structions to hasten to <HI>Ostend</HI>, in Expectation of meeting a Yatch for his Transportation, his Excel∣lency having written to his Majesty for one. We are here four Posts behind from <HI>England</HI>, and we are inform'd that both Packets were fourteen Days at <HI>Newport</HI>, and could not get our to Sea till <HI>Wednesday</HI> last.</P>
<P>As for the Business of our secured Ships, the Court of Admiralty daily proceed here, and do now acknowledge the Articles of 67 as the Rule
<PB N="168" REF="221"/>
to walk by, and do nothing in any Case before them without consulting those Articles.</P>
<P>There hath been two or three Ships condemn'd by them, occasion'd purely by the Confessions and Depositions of the Masters and Seamen, who ac∣knowledge their Bills of Lading to be false, and taken only <HI>pro formâ</HI>, and that their true Bills of Lading were sent over Land from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>, whither they were really bound.</P>
<P>The Master of the Ship that came from <HI>Tan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier</HI> has also compounded, fearing a Sentence a∣gainst him; most of his Mony and Lading being taken in at <HI>Cadiz</HI> upon <HI>French</HI> Account, and the Ship really belonging to a <HI>French</HI> Man at <HI>St. Ma∣lces</HI>, as he himself voluntarily confessed to the Ad∣miralty of <HI>Ostend</HI>.</P>
<P>I must not omit likewise to acquaint your Lordship, that upon a more narrow Enquiry we find there has been much Deceit used by the Ma∣sters of many of those Ships in question, that after they have been laded in <HI>France</HI>, they have made to the <HI>Downs</HI> for their Security, and from thence gotten Passports from the Mayor of <HI>Do∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI>, and thereby avoided paying his Majesty's Cu∣stoms; and then they have returned again to∣wards <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance</HI> by vertue of such Passports. And so after having deceiv'd his Majesty of his right, then they procure his Letters in their Favour. This, I can assure your Honour, we find to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Case of those Ships that have been hitherto q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stion'd, their Bills of Lading being all to <HI>En∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> Ports, to which they never went, but after being in the <HI>Downs</HI> have returned back again to <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Ports, and so taken; which I conceive my self oblig'd to give your Lordship a true Ac∣count
<PB N="169" REF="222"/>
of, having done the like to Mr. Secreta∣ry <HI>Coventry</HI>. However, there shall be nothing wanting on my part, either in Care, or diligent Application for their Discharge.</P>
<P>I have nothing more to add in this Particular, nor any thing else of News, but what the inclo∣sed Paper will inform, and therefore I shall end your Honour's farther Trouble, by subscribing my self with all imaginable Zeal and Duty,</P>

<P>I Am told in Confidence, from a very good Hand, that this unusual Proceeding of his Excellency, in sending his Major Generals into the several Provinces, has given great Distasts to the Governours of those Provinces, and that the Duke of <HI>Arschot</HI>'s Sickness was principally occa∣sion'd by a Disgust he took upon that Account, and some other ill Usage from his Excellency.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="223"/>That the Night preceding his Excellency's go∣ing for <HI>Flanders</HI> he spake to the Duke to return to his Government, who gave him for Answer, That he would no more return thither, nor inter∣meddle in his Government, 'till he had Satisfa∣ction given him in Point of his Honour, and that the Privileges of his Government were restored to him; and that he had written to the Queen to know her Pleasure, whether he should have his Privileges made good to him, which were granted him by Patent from his Catholick Majesty; that he did not much value the Loss of his Estate in this War, which was but a small Sacrifice to his Majesty's Service, but that now his Reputation and Honour were at Stake, much dearer to him than his Life or Estate; and that if the Queen thought not fit to do him right in what he desi∣red, he would then serve his Majesty with a Pike in his Hand, but in no other Capacity; and that till he should receive her Majesty's Answer, he wou'd no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> return to, nor meddle in his Govern∣ment. This I am assur'd he spake, and much more, and that in his Letters to <HI>Spain</HI> he has min∣gled much G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll in his Ink.</P>
<P>Yesterday his Lady arrived almost drown'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears, and in the most disconsolate Condition i∣maginable, finding the Duke extremely ill, ha∣ving then receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the last Rights of the Church, and made his Will in Presence of Duke <HI>de Vil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Herm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a</HI> and many others, there being then little Hopes of his Life. The Dutchess brought with her a Dict t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om <HI>Mans</HI>, who, being better ac¦qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with the Duke's Constitution than the <HI>Dras<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> Doctors, prescrib'd him something las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, which had so good Operation that he rest¦ed
<PB N="171" REF="224"/>
well, and though his Feaver still continues, yet there is this Day great Hopes of his Recovery, which much rejoices the Hearts of many, he be∣ing extremely beloved of all sorts, both Civil, Mi∣litary, and Religious, and his Death in this Con∣juncture would be an unvaluable Loss to this Country.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>la Motte</HI> has been also dangerously sick, but not so much griev'd for; he is now upon his Recovery, and Baron <HI>Bergeyk</HI> is so well that he resolves to go to Morrow to meet his Excel∣lency at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, hoping there to receive his Di∣spatches, that he may from thence go forward towards <HI>Ostend</HI>.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Luxemburgh</HI>, the Prince <HI>de Chimay</HI> is so much unsatisfied with Monsieur <HI>Louvignies</HI> coming thither, with a Power Inde∣pendent from his, that he is coming hither in great Discontent, and will not return to his Go∣vernment whilst the other stays there. The like is fear'd will be done by Prince <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beck</HI> in <HI>Artois</HI>, and Prince <HI>Mammy</HI> in <HI>Gueldres</HI>, which the Count <HI>de Rasch</HI> well foreseeing, offered to lay down his Commission to his Excellency, rather than go thither, affirming it would be to his Majesty's Disservice; however, his Excellency would hear no Excuse, but he must either go to <HI>Ruremond</HI> or <HI>Vilvord</HI> Castle.</P>
<P>Neither are the Governours of Provinces only dissatisfyed in this Particular, but also that his Excellency has placed Sur Intendants in each Province to beard the Governours, and are as Controllers upon them; they being never used in any of these Provinces but only in <HI>Flanders</HI>, where the Sur Intendant commands as Governour.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="225"/>These are all the visible Preparations which are made here for this next Campaign, the Con∣sequence of which may be easily foreseen. And though they generally rail against Count <HI>de Horn, de Ruiter</HI>, and <HI>Van Trump</HI>, for doing nothing in their Behalf at Sea, yet they hope to be more vi∣gorously assisted the next Campaign by Land, by his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>, upon whom all their Hopes depend; there being no talk of any Supplies from <HI>Spain</HI>, neither are they recrui∣ting their Troops nor making any Levies, whilst they find great Difficulty to pay those they have, and are this Year fallen two Months short of what they promis'd; but in the new Conquests we are told the <HI>French</HI> make all imaginable Prepa∣rations.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Flanders</HI> have at last agreed for their next Years Subsidies at fifteen thousand Rations, the one half of what his Excellency de∣manded, and eight thousand less than they gave last Year, declaring they know not where to raise this, and their Proposition of fixing a Quar∣ter at <HI>Fuerns</HI>, for increasing their Subsidies, was not accepted by his Excellency.</P>
<P>This Abatement in their Subsidies will be fol∣lowed by this Province, especially by this City, who seem much unsatisfy'd for Imprisonment of their Magistrates, which they are like to shew when Occasion serves.</P>
<P>It is whisper'd here very strongly, that though his Excellency leaves not this Government so soon as was expected, yet that he will be removed before the next Campaign, it being confidently reported the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> shall succeed him, at least for some time, and great Court
<PB N="173" REF="226"/>
and Applications are already made to him upon that Account; and I am assur'd from a good Hand that there is more than ordinary ground for it, and that the principal Cause of Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI>'s Departure for <HI>Spain</HI> was to secure to himself the Charge of General of the Horse.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>de Montalto</HI> has made a step hither from <HI>Gaunt</HI>, whilst his Excellency has been there, not enduring the smell of the Court, and so soon as he hears his Excellency is at <HI>Antwerp</HI>, he will return to <HI>Gaunt</HI>.</P>
<P>Our Letters from <HI>Aix la Cbappelle</HI> tell us, that the Prince <HI>de Salm</HI> continues still very ill, with a Bruise he received by a Fall in his Coach; and the last Letters from <HI>Strasburgh</HI> say, the Con∣federates (notwithstanding they are in their W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ter Quarters) have left eight thousand Men in their Camp near that City, which are releived each fifteen Days, that there is great fear lest the Duke <HI>de Hannover</HI> should joyn his Forces with the <HI>Swedes</HI>; but of all these Affairs 'tis needless to give your Lordship an Account, since it comes much earlier and truer to the <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n hither.</P>
<P>As to the Business of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦miralty sit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and condemn all Ships that they have hitherto question'd; those that are un∣doubtedly <HI>English</HI> Vessels, and their Lading not Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erband Goods, run the same Fortune with the rest, for they will hear nothing as to Proof on our pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and where there is the least Ap∣pearance of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ud, by double Bills of Lading, or Contradiction <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Testimony of the Masters and Mariners, they never hear more, but condemn them to lose all, and to pay Cost and Charges.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="227"/>Of all these Proceedings I have given particu∣lar Accounts to Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI>, but four or five of our Packets being staid at <HI>Newport</HI> till Thursday in the last Week; I have not yet re∣ceiv'd any farther Directions how to govern my self, which I hope to have this Night or to Mor∣row, we being now two Posts in Arrear, having received three on Tuesday Night.</P>

Rations: Yet they have made his Excellency a considerable Present as to his own Particular of One hundred thousand Crowns, a great part of which his Excellency has disposed of at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in fine Pictures, Hangings and other Curiosities to send for <HI>Spain</HI>.</P>
<P>This Day the News was very warm at Court, that the <HI>Imperialists</HI> under the Command of Prince <HI>de Baden Dourlach</HI> to the number of Twelve thou∣sand Horse have entred <HI>Burgundy</HI>, whilst on the other hand the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> has made a great Incursion into his own Territories, and that many have taken Arms with him: It's also written that <HI>Brisack</HI> is very much streighten'd, most of the Mills about the Town being destroy'd, and the Town so blocked up on all sides, with so many People in it, that they will suddenly be reduced to great Necessities.</P>
<P>Letters of a late Date from <HI>Luxenburgh</HI> tell us, the Prince <HI>de Chimay</HI> their Governour is fallen sud∣denly and dangerously ill of a Lethargy, but there was hopes of Recovery.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Arschet</HI> is still alive, though not likely long to continue so. Yesterday his Brother the Prince of <HI>Arembergh</HI> came, but he knew him not; yet last night some knowledge came to him, and he rested pretty well, which gave some hopes to those about h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; but the Doctors despair of him, but say he may linger a day or two</P>
<P>Don <HI>Pedro Ronquillo</HI> has been upon his way hi∣ther since the 23<SUP>d</SUP> of the last Month, when he parted from <HI>Thorn</HI> intending to come by the way of <HI>Hamburgh</HI>, from thence to <HI>Amsterdam</HI>, and so hither in his way for <HI>England</HI>; but being like to make s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me stay here before his going for <HI>England</HI>,
