<P>THAT Goodness inspires a confidence, which, by
divesting respect of terror, excites attachment to
Greatness, the presentation of this little Work to
Your Majesty must truly, however humbly, evince;
and though a public manifestation of duty and re∣gard
from an obscure Individual may betray a proud
ambition, it is, I trust, but a venial—I am sure it is
a natural one.</P>
<P>In those to whom Your Majesty is known but by
exaltation of Rank, it may raise, perhaps, some sur∣prise,
that scenes, characters, and incidents, which
have reference only to common life, should be brought
into so august a presence; but the inhabitant of a re∣tired
cottage, who there receives the benign permis∣sion
which at Your Majesty's feet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this humble
offering, bears in mind recollections which must live

there while “memory holds its seat,” of a benevo∣lence
withheld from no condition, and delighting in
all ways to speed thee progress of Morality, through
whatever channel it could flow, to whatever port it
might steer. I blush at [he inference] seem here
to leave open of annexing undue importance to a
production of apparently so light a kind—yet if my
hope, my view—however fallacious they may eventu∣ally

<P>THE Author of this little Work cannot,

nor forbear pouring forth her thanks to
the many Friends whose kind zeal has for∣warded

<P>THE historian of human life finds less of diffi∣culty
and of intricacy to develop, in its accidents and
adventures, than the investigator of the human heart
in its feelings and its changes. In vain may For∣tune
wave her many-coloured banner, alternately re∣galing
and dismaying, with hues that seem glowing
with all the creation's felicities, or with tints that ap∣pear
stained with ingredients of unmixt horrors: her
most rapid vicissitudes, her most unassimilating ec∣centricities,
are mocked, laughed at, and distanced
by the wilder wonders of the Heart of man; that
amazing assemblage of all possible contrari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties, in
which one thing alone is steady—the perverseness of
spirit which grafts desire on what is denied. Its
qualities are indefinable, its resources unfathomable,
its weaknesses indefensible. In our neighbours we
cannot judge, in ourselves we dare not trust it. We
lose ere we learn to appreciate, and ere we can com∣prehend
it we must be born again. Its capacity
o'er-leaps all limit, while its futility includes every
absurdity. It lives its own surprise—it ceases to
beat—and the void is inscrutable! In one grand and
general view, who can display such a portrait? Fair∣ly,
however faintly, to delineate some of its features,
is the sole and discriminate province of the pen
which would trace nature, yet blot out personality.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Family Scene.</HEAD>
<P>REPOSE is not more welcome to the worn and
to the aged, to the sick and to the unhappy, than
danger, difficulty, and toil to the young and adven∣turous.
Danger they encounter but as the fore-run∣ner
of success; difficulty, as the spur of ingenuity;
and toil, as the herald of honour. The experience
which teaches the lesson of truth, and the blessings of
tranquillity, comes not in the shape of warning nor
of wisdom; from such they turn aside, defying or
disbelieving. 'Tis in the bitterness of personal proof
alone, in suffering and in feeling, in erring and in re∣penting,
that experience comes home with convicti∣on,
or impresses to any use.</P>
<P>IN the bosom of her respectable family resided
Camilla. Nature, with a bounty the most profuse,
had been lavish to her of attractions; Fortune, with
a moderation yet kinder, had placed her between lux∣ury
and indigence. Her abode was in the parson∣age-house
of Etherington, beautifully situated in the
unequal county of Hampshire, and in the vicinity of
the varied landscapes of the New Forest. Her fa∣ther,
the rector, was the younger son of the house of
Tyrold. The living, though not considerable, en∣abled
its incumbent to attain every rational object of
his modest and circumscribed wishes; to bestow upon
a deserving wife whatever her own forbearance de∣clined
not; and to educate a lovely race of one son
and three daughters, with that expansive propriety,
which unites improvement for the future with present
enjoyment.</P>
<P>In goodness of heart, and in principles of piety,
this exemplary couple was bound to each other by
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
the most perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uison of character, though in their
tempers there was a contrast which had scarce the
gradation of a single shade to smooth off its abrupt
dissimilitude. Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and
benign in virtue, saw with compassion all imperfecti∣ons
but his own, and there doubled the severity
which to others he spared. Yet the mildness that
urged him to pity blinded him not to approve; his
equity was unerring, though his judgment was in∣dulgent.
His partner had a firmness of mind which
nothing could shake: calamity found her resolute;
even prosperity was powerless to lull her duties asleep.
The exalted character of her husband was the pride
of her existence, and the source of her happiness.
He was not merely her standard of excellence, but
of endurance, since her sense of his worth was the
criterion for her opinion of all others. This insti∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted
a spirit of comparison, which is almost always
uncandid, and which here could rarely escape proving
injurious. Such, at its very best, is the unskilful∣ness
of our fallible nature, that even the noble prin∣ciple
which impels our love of right, misleads us but
into new deviations, when its ambition presumes to
point at perfection. In this instance, however, dis∣tinctness
of disposition stisled not r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iprocity of af∣fection
—that magnetic concentration of all marriage
felicity;—Mr. Tyrold revered while he softened the
rigid virtues of his wife, who adored while she forti∣fied
the melting humanity of her husband.</P>
<P>Thus, in an interchange of happiness the most de∣served,
and of parental occupations the most promis∣ing,
passed the first married years of this blest and
blessing pair. An event then came to pass ex∣tremely
interesting at the moment, and yet more im∣portant
in its consequences. This was the receipt of
a letter from the elder brother of Mr. Tyrold, con∣taining
information that he meant to remove into
Hampshire.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh Tyrold was a baronet, who resided up∣on
the hereditary estate of the family in Yorkshire.
He was many years older than Mr. Tyrold, who had
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
never seen him since his marriage; religious duties,
prudence, and domestic affairs having from that pe∣riod
detained him at his benefice; while a passion
for field sports had, with equal constancy, kept his
brother stationary.</P>
<P>The baronet began his letter with kind enquiries
after the welfare of Mr. Tyrold and his family, and
then entered upon the state of his own affairs, briefly
narrating, “that he had lost his health, and, not
knowing what to do with himself, had resolved to
change his habitation, and settle near his relations.
The Cleves' estate, which he heard was just by
Etherington, being then upon sale, he desired his
brother to make the purchase for him out of hand;
and then to prepare Mrs. Tyrold, with whom he
was yet unacquainted, though he took it for
granted she was a woman of great learning, to re∣ceive
a mere poor country 'squire, who knew no
more of hic, haec, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oc, than the baby unborn. He
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged him to provide a proper apartment for their
niece Indiana Lynmere, whom he should bring
with him, and another for their nephew Clermont,
who was to follow at the next holidays; and not
to forget Mrs. Margland, Indiana's governess, she
being rather the most particular in point of pleasing
amongst them.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, extremely gratified by this unex∣pected
renewal of fraternal intercourse, wrote the
warmest thanks to his brother, and executed the com∣mission
with the utmost alacrity. A noble mansion,
with an extensive pleasure ground, scarce four miles
distant from the parsonage-house of Etherington,
was bought, sitted up, and made ready for his re∣ception
in the course of a few months. The ba∣ronet,
impatient to take possession of his new ter∣ritory,
arrived speedily after, with his niece Indiana,
and was welcomed at the gate of the park by Mr.
Tyrold and his whole family.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh Tyrold inherited from his ancestors an
unincumbered estate of £. 5000 per annum; which
he enjoyed with ease and affluence to himself, and
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
disseminated with a good will so generous, that he
appeared to think his personal prosperity, and that
of all who surrounded him, bestowed but to be shared
in common, rather from general right, than through
his own dispensing bounty. His temper was unalter∣ably
sweet, and every thought of his breast was laid
open to the world with an almost inf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntine artlessness.
But his talents bore no proportion to the goodness of
his heart, an insuperable want of quickness, and of
application in his early days, having l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft him, at a
later period, wholly uncultivated, and singularly self∣formed.</P>
<P>A dearth of all sedentary resources became, when
his youth passed away, his own constant reproach.
Health failed him in the meridian of his life, from
the consequences of a wound in his side, occasioned
by a fall from his horse; exercise, therefore, and
active diversions, were of necessity relinquished▪ and
as these had hitherto occupied all his time, except
that portion which he delighted to devote to hos∣pitality
and neighbourly offices, now equally beyond
his strength, he found himself at once deprived of
all employment, and destitute of all comfort. Nor
did any plan occur to him to solace his misfortunes,
till he accidentally read in the newspapers that the
Cleves' estate was upon sale.</P>
<P>Indiana, the niece who accompanied him, a beau∣tiful
little girl, was the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daughter of a de∣ceased
sister, who, at the death of her parents, had,
with Clermont, an only brother, been left to the
guardianship of Sir Hugh; with the charge of a
small estate for the son of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> £. 200 a-year, and
the sum of £. 1000 for the fortune of the daughter.</P>
<P>The meeting was a source of tender pleasure to
Mr. Tyroll; and gave birth in his young family to
that eager joy which is so naturally attached, by our
happiest early prejudices, to the first sight of near
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Mrs. Tyrold received Sir Hugh with the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> due to the brother of her husband; who
now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> higher than ever in her estimation, from a
frat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al comparison to the unavolidable disadvantage
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
of the baronet; though she was not insensible to the
fair future prospects of her children, which seemed
the probable result of his change of abode.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh himself, notwithstanding his best affec∣tions
were all opened by the sight of so many claimants
to their kindness, was the only dejected person of
the group.</P>
<P>Though too good in his nature for envy, a severe
self-upbraiding followed his view of the happiness of
his brother; he regretted he had not married at the
same age, that he might have owned as fine a family,
and repined against the unfortunate privileges of his
birth-right, which, by indulging him in his first
youth with whatever he could covet, drove from his
attention that modest soresight, which prepares for
later years the consolation they are sure to require.</P>
<P>By degrees, however, the satisfaction spread
around him found some place in his own breast, and
he acknowledged himself sensibly revived by so en∣dearing
a reception; though he candidly avowed,
that if he had not been at a loss what to do, he
should never have had a thought of taking so long a
journey. “But the not having made,” cried he,
“the proper proficiency in my youth for the filling
up my time, has put me quite behind-hand.”</P>
<P>He caressed all the children with great fondness,
and was much struck with the beauty of his three
nieces, particularly with that of Camilla, Mr. Ty∣rold's
second daughter; “yet she is not,” he cried,
“so pretty as her little sister Eugenia, nor much
better than t'other sister Lavinia; and not one of the
three is half so great a beauty as my little Indiana;
so I can't well make out what it is that's so catching
in her; but there's something in her little mouth
that quite wins me; though she looks as if she was
half laughing at me too: which can't very well be,
neither; for I suppose, as yet, at least, she knows
no more of books and studying than her uncle. And
that's little enough, God knows, for I never took to
them in proper season; which I have been sorry
enough for, upon coming to discretion.”</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11"/>
Then addressing himself to the boy, he exhorted
him to work hard while yet in his youth, and re∣lated
sundry anecdotes of the industry and merit of
his father when at the same age, though left quite to
himself, as, to his great misfortune, he had been
also, “which brought about,” he continued, “my
being this present <HI>ignoramus</HI> that you see me; which
would not have happened, if my good forefathers
had been pleased to keep a sharper look out upon my
education.”</P>
<P>Lionel, the little boy, casting a comic glance at
Camilla, begged to know what his uncle meant by a
sharper look out?</P>
<P>“Mean, my dear? why correction to be sure;
for all that, they tell me, is to be done by the rod;
so there, at least, I might have stood as good a chance
as my neighbours.”</P>
<P>“And pray, uncle,” cried Lionel, pursing up his
mouth to hide his laughter, “did you always like
the thoughts of it so well?”</P>
<P>“Why no, my dear, I can't pretend to that; at
your age I had no more taste for it than you have:
but there's a proper season for every thing. How∣ever,
though I tell you this for a warning, perhaps
you may do without it; for, by what I hear, the
rising generation's got to a much greater pitch since
my time.”</P>
<P>He then added, he must advise him, as a friend,
to be upon his guard, as his co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin, Clermont Lyn∣mere,
who was coming home from Eton school next
Christmas for the holidays, would turn out the very
mirror of scholarship; for he had given directions to
have him study both night and day, except what
might be taken off for eating and sleeping: “Be∣cause,”
he continued, “having proved the bad of
knowing nothing in my own case, I have the more
right to intermeddle with others. And he will thank
me enough when once he has got over his classie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
And I hope, my dear little boy, you see it in the
same light too; which, however, is what I can't
expect.”</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12"/>
The house was now examined; the fair little In∣diana
took possession of her apartment; Miss Mar∣gland
was satisfied with the attention that had been
paid her; and Sir Hugh was rejoiced to find a room
for Clermont that had no window but a skylight, by
which means his studies, he observed, would receive
no interruption from gaping and staring about him.
And, when the night advanced, Mr. Tyrold had the
happiness of leaving him with some prospect of re∣covering
his spirits.</P>
<P>The revival, however, lasted but during the no∣velty
of the scene; depression returned with the
feelings of ill health; and the happier lot of his
brother, though born to almost nothing, filled him
with incessant repentance of his own mismanagement.</P>
<P>In some measure to atone for this, he resolved to
collect himself a family in his own house; and the
young Camilla, whose dawning archness of expression
had instinctively caught him, he now demanded of
her parents, to come and reside with him and Indiana
at Cleves; “for certainly,” he said, “for such a
young little thing, she looks full of amusement.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold objected against reposing a trust so pre∣cious
where its value could so ill be appreciated. Ca∣milla
was, in secret, the fondest hope of her mother,
though the rigour of her justice scarce permitted the
partiality to beat even in her own breast. Nor did
the happy little person need the avowed distinction.
The tide of youthful glee flowed jocund from her
heart, and the transparency of her fine blue veins
almost shewed the velocity of its current. Every
look was a smile, every step was a spring, every
thought was a hope, every feeling was joy! and the
early felicity of her mind was without allay. O
blissful state of innocence, purity, and delight, why
must it fleet so fast? why scarcely but by retrospection
is its happiness known?</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, while his tenderest hopes encircled
the same object, saw the proposal in a sairer light,
from the love he bore to his brother. It seemed
certain such a residence would secure her an ample
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
fortune; the governess to whom Indiana was en∣trusted
would take care of his little girl; though re∣moved
from the hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly instructions, she would still
be within reach of the general superintendance of
her mother, into whose power he cast the uncon∣trolled
liberty to reclaim her, if there started any
occasion. His children had no provision ascertained,
should his life be too short to fulfil his own personal
schemes of economy in their favour: and while to
an argument so incontrovertible Mrs. Tyrold was
silent, he begged her also to reflect, that, persuasive
as were the attractions of elegance and resinement,
no just parental expectations could be essentially dis∣appointed,
where the great moral l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssons were prac∣tically
inculcated, by a uniform view of goodness of
heart, and firmness of principle. These his brother
possessed in an eminent degree; and if his character
had nothing more from which their daughter could
derive benefit, it undoubtedly had not a point from
which she could receive injury.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold now yielded; she never resisted a re∣monstrance
of her husband; and as her sense of duty
impelled her also never to murmur, she retired to her
own room, to conceal with how ill a grace she com∣plied.</P>
<P>Had this lady been united to a man whom she
despised, she would yet have obeyed him, and as
scrupulously, though not as happily, as she obeyed
her honoured partner. She considered the vow taken
at the altar to her husband, as a voluntary vestal
would have held one taken to her Maker; and no
dissent in opinion exculpated, in her mind, the least
deviation from his will.</P>
<P>But here, where an admiration almost adoring was
fixt of the character to which she submitted, she was
sure to applaud the motives which swayed him, how∣ever
little their consequences met her sentiments:
and even where the contrariety was wholly repugnant
to her judgment, the genuine warmth of her just
affection made every compliance, and every forbear∣ance,
not merely exempt from pain, but, if to
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
him any satisfaction, a sacrifice soothing to her
heart.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected
by her excellencies, gratefully felt his power, and
religiously studied not to abuse it: he respected what
he owed to her conscience, he tenderly returned
what he was indebted to her affection. To render
her virtues conducive to her happiness, to soften her
duties by the highest sense of their merit, were the
first and most sacred objects of his solicitude in life.</P>
<P>When the lively and lovely little girl, mingling the
tears of separation with all the childish rapture which
novelty, to a much later period inspires, was prepar∣ing
to change her home, “Remember,” cried Mr.
Tyrold, to her anxious mother, “that on you, my
Georgiana, devolves the sole charge, the unlimited
judgment, to again bring her under this roof, the
first moment she appears to you in any danger from
having quitted it.”</P>
<P>The prompt and thankful acceptance of Mrs. Ty∣rold
did justice to the sincerity of this offer: and the
cheerful acquiescence of lessened reluctance, raised
her higher in that esteem to which her constant mind
invariably looked up, as the summit of her chosen
ambition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Comic Gambels.</HEAD>
<P>DELIGHTED with this acquisition to his
household, Sir Hugh again revived. “My dear
brother and sister,” he cried, when next the family
visited Cleves, “this proves the most fortunate st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p
I have ever taken since I was born. Camilla's a little
jewel; she jumps and skips about till she makes my
eyes ache with looking after her, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fear of her
breaking her neck. I must keep a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arp watch, or
she'll put poor Indiana's nose quite out of joint, which
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
God forbid. However, she's the life of us all, for
I'm sorry to say it, but I think, my dear brother,
poor Indiana promises to turn out rather dull.”</P>
<P>The sprightly little girl, thus possessed of the heart,
soon guided the will of her uncle. He could refuse
nothing to her endearing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntreaty, and felt every in∣dulgence
repaid by the enchantment of her gaiety.
Indiana, his first idol, lost her power to please him,
though no essential kindness was abated in his con∣duct.
He still acknowledged that her beauty was the
most complete; but he sound in Camilla a variety
that was captivation. Her form and her mind were
of equal elasticity. Her playful countenance re∣kindled
his spirits, the cheerfulness of her animated
voice awakened him to its own joy. He douted upon
detaining her by his side, or delighted to gratify her
if she wished to be absent. She exhilarated him with
pleasure, she supplied him with id<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, and from the
morning's first dawn to the evening's latest close, his
eye followed her light-springing figure, or his ear
vibrated with her sportive sounds; catching, as it
listened, in successive rotation, the spontaneous laugh,
the unconscious bound, the genuine glee of child∣hood's
fearless happiness, uncu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bed by severity, un∣tamed
by misfortune.</P>
<P>This ascendance was soon pointed out by the ser∣vants
to Indiana, who sometimes shewed her resent∣ment
in unexplained and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uting fullenness, and at
others, let all pass unnoticed, with unreflecting for∣getfulness.
But her mind was soon empoisoned with
a jealousy of more permanent seriousness; in less than
a month after the residence of Camilla at Cleves, Sir
Hugh took the resolution of making her his heiress.</P>
<P>Even Mr. Tyrold, notwithstanding his fondness
for Camilla, remonstrated against a partiality so in∣jurious
to his nephew and niece, as well as to the
rest of his family. And Mrs. Tyrold, though her
secret heart subscribed, without wonder, to a pre∣dilection
in favour of Camilla, was maternally dis∣turbed
for her other children, and felt her justice
sensibly shocked at a blight so unmerited to the hopes
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
cherished by Indiana and Clermont Lynmere: for
though the fruits of this change of plan would be
reaped by her little darling, they were robbed of all
their sweetness to a mind so correct, by their un∣deserved
bitterness towards the first expectants.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, however, was immoveable; he would
provide handsomely, he said, for Indiana and Cler∣mont,
by settling a thousand pounds a-year between
them; and he would bequeath capital legacies
amongst the rest of his nephews and nieces: but as
to the bulk of his fortune, it should all go to Camilla;
for how else could he make her amends for having
amused him? or how, when he was gone, should
he prove to her he loved her the best?</P>
<P>Sir Hugh could keep nothing secret; Camilla was
soon informed of the riches she was destined to in∣herit;
and the servants, who now with added respect
attended her, took frequent opportunities of im∣pressing
her with the expectation, by the favours they
begged from her in reversion.</P>
<P>The happy young heiress heard them with little
concern: interest and ambition could find no room
in a mind, which to dance, sing, and play, could en∣liven
to rapture. Yet the continued repetition of
requests soon made the idea of patronage familiar to
her, and though wholly uninfected with one thought
of power or consequence, she sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her
fancy with the presents she should make amongst her
friends; designing a coach for her mamma, that she
might oftener go abroad; an horse for her brother
Lionel, which she knew to be his most passionate
wish; a new bureau, with a lock and key, for her
eldest sister Lavinia; innumerable trinkets for her
cousin Indiana; dolls and toys, without end, for her
little sister Eugenia; and a new library of new
books, finely bound and gilt, for her papa. But
these munificent donations looked forward to no
other date than the anticipation of womanhood. If
an hint were surmised of her surviving her uncle, an
impetuous shower of tears dampt all her gay schemes,
deluged every airy castle, and shewed the instinctive
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
gratitude which kindness can awaken, even in the
unthinking period of earliest youth, in those bosoms it
has ever the power to animate.</P>
<P>Her ensuing birth-day, upon which she would
enter her tenth year, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to announce to the adjoin∣ing
country her uncle's splendid plan in her favour.
Her brother and sisters were invited to keep it with
her at Cleves; but Sir Hugh declined asking either
her father or mother, that his own time, without re∣straint,
might be dedicated to the promotion of her
festivity; he even requested of Miss Margland, that
she would not appear that day, lest her presence
should curb the children's spirits.</P>
<P>The gay little party, consisting of Lavinia, who
was two years older, and Eugenia, who was two
years younger than Camilla, with her beautiful
cousin, who was exactly of her own age, her brother
Lionel, who counted three years more, and Edgar
Mandlebert, a ward of Mr. Tyrold's, all assembled
at Cleves upon this important occasion, at eight
o'clock in the morning, to breakfast.</P>
<P>Edgar Mandlebert, an uncommonly spirited and
manly boy, now thirteen years of age, was heir to
one of the finest estates in the country. He was the
only son of a bosom friend of Mr. Tyrold, to whose
guardianship he had been consigned almost from his
infancy, and who superintended the care of his edu∣cation
with as much zeal, though not as much oeco∣nomy,
as that of his own son. He placed him
under the tuition of Dr. Marchmont, a man of con∣summate
learning, and he sent for him to Ethering∣ton
twice in every year, where he assi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uously kept up
his studies by his own personal instructions. “I leave
him rich, my dear friend,” said his father, when on
his death-bed he recommended him to Mr. Tyrold,
“and you, I trust, will make him good, and see him
happy; and should hereafter a daughter of your own,
from frequent intercourse, become mistress of his af∣fections,
do not suppose such a union from a disparity
of fortune, which a daughter of yours, and of your
incomparable partner's, can hardly fail to counter∣balance
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
in merit.” Mr. Tyrold, though too noble
to avail himself of a declaration so generous, by
forming any plan to bring such a connection to bear,
felt conscientiously absolved from using any measures
of frustration, and determined, as the young people
grew up, neither to promote nor impede any rising
regard.</P>
<P>The estate of Beech Park was not all that young
Mandlebert inherited; the friendship of its late
owner for Mr. Tyrold, seemed instinctively transfused
into his breast, and he paid back the parental tender∣ness
with which he was watched and cherished, by a
fondness and veneration truly silial.</P>
<P>Whatever could indulge or delight the little set
was brought forth upon this joyous meeting; fruits,
sweetmeats, and cakes; car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, trinkets, and blind
fidlers, were all at the unlimited command of the
fairy mistress of the ceremonies. But unbounded
as were the transports of the jovial little group, they
could scarcely keep pace with the enjoyment of Sir
Hugh; he entered into all their plays, he forgot all
his pains, he laughed because they laughed, and
suffered his darling little girl to govern and direct him
at her pleasure. She made him whiskers of cork,
powdered his brown bob, and covered a thread paper
with black ribbon to hang to it for a quene. She
metamorphosed him into a female, accoutering him
with her fine new cap, while she enveloped her own
small head in his wig; and then, tying the maid's
apron round his waist, put a rattle into his hand, and
Eugenia's doll upon his lap, which she told him was
a baby that he must nurse and amuse.</P>
<P>The excess of merriment thus excited spread
through the whole house. Lionel called in the ser∣vants
to see this comical sight, and the servants in∣dulged
their numerous guests with a peep at it from
the windows. Sir Hugh, meanwhile, resolved to
object to nothing, performed every part assigned him,
joined in their hearty laughs at the grotesque figure
they made of him, and cordially encouraged all their
proceedings, assuring them he had not been so much
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
diverted himself since his fall from his horse, and
advising them, with great zeal, to be merry while
they could: “For you will never, my dears,” said
he, “be younger, never while you live; no more,
for that matter, shall I, neither, for all I am so much
older, which, in that point, makes no difference.”</P>
<P>He grew weary, however, first; and stretching
himself his full length, with a prodigious yawn,
“Heigh ho!” he cried, “Camilla, my dear, do
take away poor Doll, for fear I should let it slip.”</P>
<P>The little gigglers, almost in convulsions of
laughter, intreated him to nurse it some time longer;
but he frankly answered, “No, my dears, no; I
can play no more now, if I'd ever so fain, for I'm
tired to death, which is really a pity; so you must
either go out with me my airing, for a rest to your
merry little sides, or slay and play by yourselves till I
come back, which I think will put you all into
fevers; but, however, nobody shall trouble your
little souls with advice to-day; there are days enough
in the year for teazing, without this one.”</P>
<P>Camilla instantly decided for the airing, and with∣out
a dissentient voice: so entirely had the extreme
good humour of Sir Hugh won the hearts of the
little party, that they felt as if the whole of their
entertainment depended upon his presence. The
carriage, therefore, was ordered for the baronet and
his four nieces, and Lionel and Edgar Mandlebert,
at the request of Camilla, were gratified with horses.</P>
<P>Camilla was desired to fix their route, and while
she hesitated from the variety in her choice, Lionel
proposed to Edgar that they should take a view of
his house, park, and gardens, which were only three
miles from Cleves. Edgar referred the matter to
Indiana, to whose already exquisite beauty his ju∣venile
admiration paid its most ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly obeisance. In∣diana
approved; the little heroine of the day as∣sented
with pleasure, and they immediately set out
upon the happy expedition.</P>
<P>The two boys the whole way came with offerings
of wild honeysuckle and sweet briar, the grateful
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
nosegays of all-diffusing nature, to the coach win∣dows,
each carefully presenting the most fragrant to
Indiana; for Lionel, even more than sympathising
with Edgar, declared his sisters to be mere frights in
comparison with his fair cousin. Their partiality,
however, struggled vainly against that of Sir Hugh,
who still, in every the most trivial particular, gave
the preference to Camilla.</P>
<P>The baron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t had ordered that his own garden
chair should follow him to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung Mandlebert's park,
that he might take Camilla by his side, and go about
the grounds without fatigue; the rest were to walk.
Here Indiana received again the homage of her two
young be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us; they pointed out to her the most
beautiful prospects, they gathered her the fairest
flowers, they loaded her with the be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and ripest fruits.</P>
<P>This was no sooner observed by Sir Hugh, than
hastily stopping his chair, he called after them aloud,
“Holloa! come hither, my boys! here, you Mr.
young Mandlebert, what are you all about? Why
don't you bring that best bunch of grapes to Ca∣milla?”</P>
<P>“I have already promised it to Miss Lynmere,
Sir.”</P>
<P>“O ho, have you so? well, give it her then if
you have. I have no right to rob you of your choice.
Indiana, my dear, how do you like this place?”</P>
<P>“Very much, indeed, un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>; I never saw any
place I liked so much in my life.”</P>
<P>“I am sure else,” said Edgar, “I should never
care for it again my self.”</P>
<P>“O, I could look at it for ever,” cried Indiana,
“and not be tired!”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh gravely paused these speeches, and re∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
them in turn with much steadiness, as if set∣tling
their future destinies; but ever unable to keep
a single thought to himself, he presently burst forth
aloud with this new mental arrangement, saying:
“Well, my dears, well; this is not quite the thing
I had taken a fancy to in my own private brain, but
it's all for the best, there's no doubt; though the
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
estate being just in my neighbourhood, would have
made it more suitable for Camilla; I mean provided
we could have bought, among us, the odd three miles
between the Parks; which how many acres they
make, I can't pretend to say, without the proper
calculation; but if it was all joined, it would be the
finest domain in the county, as far as I know to the
contrary: nevertheless, my dear young Mr. Man∣dlebert,
you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a right to choose for yourself; for
as to beauty, 'tis mere fancy; not but what Indiana
has one or other the prettiest face I ever saw, though
I think Camilla's so much prettier; I mean in point
of winningness. However, there's no fear as to my
consent, for nothing can be a greater pleasure to me
than having two such good girls, both being cousins,
live so near that they may overlook one another from
park to park, all day long, by the mode of a
telescope.”</P>
<P>Edgar, perfectly understanding him, blushed deep∣ly,
and, forgetting what he had just declared, offered
his grapes to Lavinia. Indiana, conceiving herself
already mistress of so fine a place, smiled with ap∣proving
complacency; and the rest were too much
occupied with the objects around them, to listen to
so long a speech.</P>
<P>They then all moved on; but, soon after, Lionel,
flying up to his uncle's chair, informed Camilla he
had just heard from the gardener, that only half a
mile off, at Northwick, there was a fair, to which he
begged she would ask to go. She found no difficul∣ty
in obliging him; and Sir Hugh was incapable of
hesitating at whatever she could desire. The carri∣age
and the horses for the boys were again ordered,
and to the regret of only Edgar and Indiana, the
beautiful plantations of Beech Park were relinquish∣ed
for the fair.</P>
<P>They had hardly proceeded twenty yards, when
the smiles that had brightened the face of Lavinia,
the eldest daughter of Mr. Tyrold, were suddenly
overcast, giving place to a look of dismay, which
seemed the effect of some abruptly painful recollecti∣on;
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
and the moment Sir Hugh perceived it, and en∣quired
the cause, the tears rolled fast down her cheeks,
and she said she had been guilty of a great-sin, and
could never forgive herself.</P>
<P>They all eagerly endeavoured to console her, Ca∣milla
fondly taking her hand, little Eugenia sympa∣thetically
crying over and kissing her, Indiana beg∣ging
to know what was the matter, and Sir Hugh,
holding out to her the finest peach from his stores for
Camilla, and saying, “Don't cry so, my dear, don't
cry: take a little bit of peach; I dare say you are
not so bad as you think for.”</P>
<P>The weeping young penitent besought leave to get
out of the coach with Camilla, to whom alone she
could explain herself. Camilla almost opened the
door herself to hasten the discovery; and the mo∣ment
they had run up a bank by the road side, “Tell
me what it is, my dear Lavinia,” she cried, “and I
am sure my uncle will do any thing in the world to
help you.”</P>
<P>“O Camilla,” she answered, “I have disobeyed
mamma! and I did not mean it in the least—but I
have forgot all her commands!—She charged me not
to let Eugenia stir out from Cleves, because of the
small pox—and she has been already at Beech Park—
and now, how can I tell the poor little thing she must
not go to the fair?”</P>
<P>“Don't vex yourself about that,” cried Camilla,
kindly kissing the tears off her cheeks, “for I will
stay behind, and play with Eugenia myself, if my
uncle will drive us back to Beech Park; and then
all the rest may go to the fair, and take us up again
in the way home.”</P>
<P>With this expedient she flew to the coach, charg∣ing
the two boys, who with great curiosity had rid∣den
to the bank-side, and listened to all that had pass∣ed,
to comfort Lavinia.</P>
<P>“Lionel,” cried Edgar, “do you know, while Ca∣milla
was speaking so kindly to Lavinia, I thought
she looked almost as pretty as your cousin?” Lio∣nel
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
would by no means subscribe to this opinion, but
Edgar would not retract.</P>
<P>Camilla, jumping into the carriage, threw her
arms around the neck of her uncle, and whispered
to him all that had passed. “Poor innocent little
dear!” cried <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, “is that all? it's just nothing, con∣sidering
her young age.”</P>
<P>Then, looking out of the window, “Lavinia,”
he said, “you have done no more harm than what's
quite natural; and so I shall tell your mamma, who
is a woman of sense, and won't expect such a young
head as yours to be of the same age as hers and mine.
But come into the coach, my dear; we'll just drive
as far as Northwick, for an airing, and then back
again.”</P>
<P>The extreme delicacy of the constitution of Eu∣genia
had hitherto deterred Mrs. Tyrold from ino∣culating
her; she had therefore scrupulously kept
her from all mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llaneous intercourse in the neigh∣bourhood;
but as the weakness of her insancy was
now promising to change into health and strength,
she meant to give to that terrible disease its best
chance, and the only security it allows from perpe∣tual
alarm, immediately after the heats of the present
autumn should be over.</P>
<P>Lavinia, unused to disobedience, could not be hap∣py
in practising it: she entreated, therefore, to re∣turn
immediately to Cleves. Sir Hugh complied;
premising only that they must none of them expect
him to be of their play-party again till after dinner.</P>
<P>The coachman then received fresh orders: but
the moment they were communicated to the two
boys, Lionel, protesting he would not lose the fair,
said he should soon overtake them, and, regardless of
all remonstrances, put spurs to his horse, and gallop∣ped
off.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, looking after him with great alarm,
exclaimed, “Now he is going to break all his bones!
which is always the case with those young boys,
when first they get a horseback.”</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24"/>
Camilla, terrified that she had begged this boon,
requested that the servant might directly ride after
him.</P>
<P>“Yes, my dear, if you wish it,” answered Sir
Hugh; only we have but this one man for us all,
because of the rest staying to get the ball and sup∣per
ready; so that if we should be overturned our∣selves,
here's never a soul to pick us up.”</P>
<P>Edgar offered to ride on alone, and persuade the
truant to return.</P>
<P>“Thank you, my dear, thank you,” answered Sir
Hugh, “you are as good a boy as any I know, but,
in point of horsemanship, one's as ignorant as t'other,
as far as I can tell; so we may only see both your
sculls fractured instead of one, in the midst of your
galloping; which, God forbid, for either.”</P>
<P>“Then let us all go together,” cried Indiana,
“and bring him back.”</P>
<P>“But do not let us get out of the coach, uncle,”
said Lavinia; “pray do not let us get out!”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh agreed; though he added, that as to
the small pox, he could by no means see it in the
same light, for he had no notion of people's taking
diseases upon themselves. “Besides,” continued he,
“she will be sure to have it when her time comes,
whether she is moped up or no; and how did people
do before these new modes of making themselves sick
of their own accord?”</P>
<P>Pitying, however, the uneasiness of Lavinia, when
they came near the town, he called to the footman,
and said, “Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k'ee, Jacob, do you ride on first, and
keep a sharp look out that nobody has the small pox.”</P>
<P>The fair being held in the suburbs, they soon ar∣rived
at some straggling booths, and the coach, at
the instance of Lavinia, was stopt.</P>
<P>Indiana now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> solicited leave to alight and
see the fair; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgar offered to be her esquire.
Sir Hugh consented, but desired that Lavinia and
Camilla might be also of the party. Lavinia tried
vainly to excuse herself; he assured her it would raise
her spirits, and bid her be under no apprehension,
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
for he would stay and amuse the little Eugenia him∣self,
and take care that she came to no harm.</P>
<P>They were no sooner gone, however, than the lit∣tle
girl cried to follow; Sir Hugh, compassionately
kissing her, owned she had as good a right as any of
them, and declared it was a hard thing to have her
punished for other peoples particularities. This con∣cession
served only to make her tears flow the faster;
till, unable to bear the sight, he said he could not an∣swer
to his conscience the vexing such a young thing,
and, promising she should have whatever she liked,
if she would cry no more, he ordered the coachman
to drive to the first booth where there were any toy▪
to be sold.</P>
<P>Here, having no footman to bring the trinkets to
the coach, he alighted, and, suffering the little girl,
for whom he had not a fear himself, to accompany
him, he entered the booth, and told her to take
whatever hit her fancy, for she should have as many
playthings as she could carry.</P>
<P>Her grief now gave way to extacy, and her little
hands could soon scarcely sustain the loaded skirt of
her white frock. Sir Hugh, determining to make
the rest of the children equally happy, was selecting
presents for them all, when the little group, igno∣rant
whom they should encounter, advanced towards
the same booth: but he had hardly time to exclaim,
“Oho! have you caught us?” when the innocent
voice of Eugenia, calling out, “Little boy; what's
the matter with your face, little boy?” drew his
attention another way, and he perceived a child ap∣parently
just recovering from the small-pox.</P>
<P>Edgar, who at the same instant saw the same
dreaded sight, darted forward, seized Eugenia in his
arms, and, in defiance of her playthings and her
struggles, carried her back to the coach; while La∣vinia,
in an agony of terror, ran up to the little boy,
and, crying out, “O go away! go away!” drag∣ged
him out of the booth, and, perfectly unconscious
what she did, covered his head with her frock, and
held him fast with both her hands.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Sir Hugh, all aghast, hurried out of the booth,
but could scarce support himself from emotion; and,
while he leaned upon his stick, ejaculating, “Lord
help us! what poor creatures we are, we poor mor∣tals!”
Edgar had the presence of mind to make In∣diana
and Camilla go directly to the carriage. He
then prevailed with Sir Hugh to enter it also, and
ran back for Lavinia. But when he perceived the
situation into which distress and affright had driven
her, and saw her sobbing over the child, whom she
still held confined, with an idea of hiding him from
Eugenia, he was instantly sensible of the danger of
her joining her little sister. Extremely perplexed
for them all, and afraid, by going from the sick
child, he might himself carry the infection to the
coach, he sent a man to Sir Hugh to know what
was to be done.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, totally overset by the unexpected ac∣cident,
and conscience-struck at his own wilful share
in risking it, was utterly helpless, and could only
answer, that he wished young Mr. Edgar would give
him his advice.</P>
<P>Edgar, thus called upon, now first felt the abi∣lities
which his short life had not hitherto brought
into use: he begged Sir Hugh would return imme∣diately
to Cleves, and keep Eugenia there for a few
days with Camilla and her cousin; while he under∣took
to go himself in search of Lionel, with whose
assistance he would convey Lavinia back to Ether∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngton,
without seeing her little sister; since she
must now be as full of contagion as the poor object
who had just had the disease.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, much relieved, sent him word he had
no doubt he would become the first scholar of the
age; and desired he would get a chaise for himself
and Lavinia, and let the footman take charge of his
horse.</P>
<P>He then ordered the coach to Cleves.</P>
<P>Edgar fulfilled the injunctions of Sir Hugh with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lacrity; but had a very difficult task to find Lionel,
and one far more painful to appease Lavinia, whose
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
apprehensions were so great as they advanced towards
Etherington, that, to sooth and comfort her, he or∣dered
the postilion to drive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arm-house near
Cleves, whence he forwarded a boy to Sir Hugh,
with entreaties that he would write a few lines to
Mrs. Tyrold, in exculpation of her sor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owing
daughter.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh complied, but was so little in the habit
of writing, that he sent over a messenger to desire
they would dine at the farm house, in order to give
him time to compose his epistic.</P>
<P>Early in the afternoon, he conveyed to them the
following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. Tyrold at the Parsonage House, belonging to
the Rever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Rector, Mr. Tyrold, for the Time
being, at Etherington, in Hampshire.</HEAD>
<OPENER>DEAR SISTER,</OPENER>
<P>I AM no remarkable good writer, in comparison
with my brother, which you will excuse from my
deficiencies, as it is my only apology. I beg you
will not be angry with little Lavinia, as she did
nothing in the whole business, except wanting to do
right, only not mentioning it in the beginning, which
is very excusable in the light of a fault; the wisest
of us having been youths ourselves once, and the
most learned being subject to do wrong, but how
much so the ignorant? of which I may speak more
properly. However, as she would certainly have
caught the small pox herself, except from the lucky
circumstance of having had it before, I think it best
to keep Eugenia a few days at Cleves, for the sake
of her infection. Not but what if she should have
it, I trust your sense won't fret about it, as it is only
in the course of Nature: which, if she had been in∣oculated,
is more than any man could say; even a
physician. So the whole being my own fault, with∣out
the least meaning to offend, if any thing comes
of it, I hope, my dear sister, you won't take it ill,
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
especially of poor little Lavinia, for 'tis hard if such
young things may not be happy at their time of life,
before having done harm to a human soul. Poor
dears! 'tis soon enough to be unhappy after being
wicked; which, God knows, we are all liable to be
in the proper season. I beg my love to my bro∣ther;
and remain,</P>
<CLOSER>Dear sister,
Your affectionate brother,
<SIGNED>HUGH TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> It is but justice to my brother to mention
that young Master Mandlebert's behaviour has done
the greatest honour to the classics; which must be a
great satisfaction to a person having the care of his
education.</P>
<P>The rest of the day lost all its delights to the
young heiress from this unfortunate adventure. The
deprivation of three of the party, with the well∣grounded
fear of Mrs. Tyrold's just blame, were
greater mortifications to those that remained, than
even the ball and supper could remove. And Sir
Hugh, to whom their lowered spirits were suf∣ficiently
depressing, had an additional, though hardly
to himself acknowledged, weight upon his mind, re∣lative
to Eugenia and the small pox.</P>
<P>The contrition of the trembling Lavinia could not
but obtain from Mrs. Tyrold the pardon it deserved:
but she could make no allowance for the extreme
want of consideration in Sir Hugh; and anxiously
waited the time when she might call back Eugenia
from the management of a person whom she con∣sidered
as more childish than her children themselves.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Consequences.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY precaution being taken with regard to
Lavinia and her clothes, for warding off infection to
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
Eugenia, if as yet she had escaped it; Mrs. Tyrold
fixed a day for fetching her little daughter from
Cleves. Sir Hugh, at the earnest intreaty of Ca∣milla,
invited the young party to come again early
that morning, that some amends might be made them
for their recent disappointment of the ball and sup∣per,
by a holiday, and a little sport, previous to the
arrival of Mrs. Tyrold; to whom he voluntarily
pledged his word, that Eugenia should not again be
taken abroad, nor suffered to appear before any
strangers.</P>
<P>Various gambols were now again enacted by the
once more happy group; but all was conducted with
as much security as gaiety, till Lionel proposed the
amusement of riding upon a plank in the park.</P>
<P>A plank was immediately procured by the gar∣dener,
and placed upon the trunk of an old oak,
where it parted into two thick branches.</P>
<P>The boys and the three eldest girls balanced one
another in turn, with great delight and dexterity;
but Sir Hugh feared committing the little Eugenia,
for whom he was grown very anxious, amongst them,
till the repinings of the child demolished his pru∣dence.
The difficulty how to indulge her with
safety was, nevertheless, considerable: and, after va∣rious
experiments, he resolved to trust her to nobody
but himself; and, placing her upon his lap, occu∣pied
one end of the plank, and desired that as many
of the rest as were necessary to make the weight
equal, would seat themselves upon the other.</P>
<P>This diversion was short, but its consequences
were long. Edgar Mandlebert, who superintended
the balance, poised it with great exactness; yet no
sooner was Sir Hugh elevated, than, becoming exceedingly
giddy, he involuntarily loosened his hold
of Eugenia, who fell from his arms to the ground.</P>
<P>In the agitation of his fright, he stooped forward
to save her, but lost his equilibrium; and, instead of
rescuing, followed her.</P>
<P>The greatest confusion ensued; Edgar, with ad∣mirable
adroitness, preserved the elder girls from suf∣fering
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
by the accident; and Lionel took care of
himself by leaping instantly from the plank: Sir
Hugh, extremely bruised, could not get up with∣out
pain; but all concern and attention soon centred
in the little Eugenia, whose incessant cries raised ap∣prehensions
of some more than common mischief.</P>
<P>She was carried to the house in the arms of Edgar,
and delivered to the governess. She screamed the
whole time she was undressing; and Edgar, con∣vinced
she had received some injury, gallopped off,
unbid, for a surg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on: but what was the horror of
Sir Hugh, upon hearing him pronounce, that her
left shoulder was put out, and that one of her knees
was dislocated!</P>
<P>In an agony of remorse, he shut himself up in
his room, without power to issue a command, or
listen to a question: nor could he be prevailed upon
to open his door, till the arrival of Mrs. Tyrold.</P>
<P>Hastily then rushing out, he hurried to meet her;
and, snatching both her hands, and pressing them
between his own, he burst into a passionate flood of
tears, and sobbed out: “Hate me, my dear sister,
for you can't help it! for I am sorry to tell it you,
but I believe I have been the death of poor Euge∣nia,
that never hurt a fly in her life!”</P>
<P>Pale, and struck with dread, yet always possessing
her presence of mind, Mrs. Tyrold disengaged her∣self,
and demanded where she might find her? Sir
Hugh could make no rational answer; but Edgar,
who had run down stairs, purposing to communicate
the tidings more gently, briefly stated the misfor∣tune,
and conducted her to the poor little sufferer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, though nearly overpowered by a
sight so affecting, still preserved her faculties for bet∣ter
uses than lamentation. She held the child in her
arms while the necessary operations were performing
by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgeon; she put her to bed, and watched by
her side the whole night; during which, in desianc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of all precautions, a high fever came on, and she
grew worse every moment.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31"/>
The next morning, while still in this alarming
state, the unfortunate little innocent exhibited un∣doubted
symptoms of the small pox.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now also established himself at Cleves,
to share the parental task of nursing the afflicted
child, whose room he never left, except to give con∣solation
to his unhappy brother, who lived wholly in
his own apartment, refusing the sight even of Ca∣milla,
and calling himself a monster too wicked to
look at any thing that was good; though the affec∣tionate
little girl, pining at the exclusion, continu∣ally
presented herself at his door.</P>
<P>The disease bore every p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oguosti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of fatal conse∣quences,
and the fond parents soon lost all hope,
though they redoubled every attention.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then gave himself up wholly to despair:
he darkened his room, refused all food but bread and
water, permitted no one to approach him, and re∣viled
himself invariably with the contrition of a wil∣ful
murderer.</P>
<P>In this state of self-punishment he persevered, till
the distemper unexpectedly took a sudden and happy
turn, and the surgeon made known, that his patient
might possibly recover.</P>
<P>The joy of Sir Hugh was now as srantic as his
grief had been the moment before: he hastened to
his drawing-room, commanded that the whole house
should be illuminated; promised a year's wages to all
his servants; bid his house-keeper distribute beef
and broth throughout the village; and sent direc∣tions
that the bells of the three nearest parish
churches should be rang for a day and a night. But
when Mr. Tyrold, to avert the horror of any wholly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>prepared disappointment, represented the still pre∣carious
state of Eugenia, and the many changes yet
to be feared; he desperately reversed all his orders,
returned sadly to his dark room, and protested he
would never more rejoice, till Mrs. Tyrold herself
should come to him with good news.</P>
<P>This anxiously waited aera at length arrived; Eu∣genia,
though seamed and even scarred by the hor∣rible
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
disorder, was declared out of danger; and
Mrs. Tyrold, burying her anguish at the alteration,
in her joy for the safety of her child, with an heart
overflowing from pious gratitude, became the messen∣ger
of peace; and, holding out her hand to Sir
Hugh, assured him the little Eugenia would soon be
well.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, in an ecstasy which no power could
check, forgot every pain and infirmity to hurry up
to the apartment of the little girl, that he might
kneel, he said, at her feet, and there give thanks
for her recovery: but the moment he entered the
room, and saw the dreadful havoc grim disease had
made on her face; not a trace of her beauty left,
no resemblance by which he could have known her;
he shrunk back, wrung his hands, called himself the
most sinful of all created beings, and in the deepest
despondence, sunk into a chair and wept aloud.</P>
<P>Eugenia soon began to cry also, though uncon∣scious
for what cause; and Mrs. Tyrold remon∣strated
to Sir Hugh upon the uselessness of such
transports, calmly beseeching him to retire and com∣pose
himself.</P>
<P>“Yes, sister,” he answered, “yes, I'll go away,
for I am sure, I do not want to look at her again;
but to think of its being all my doing!—O bro∣ther!
O sister! why don't you both kill me in re∣turn?
And what amends can I make her? what
amends, except a poor little trifle of money?—And
as to that, she shall have it, God knows, every penny
I am worth, the moment I am gone; ay, that she
shall, to a single shilling, if I die to-morrow!”</P>
<P>Starting up with revived courage from this idea,
he ventured again to turn his head towards Eugenia,
exclaiming: “O, if she does but get well! does
but ease my poor conscience by making me out not
to be a murderer, a guinea for every pit in that poor
face will I settle on her out of hand; yes, before I
so much as breathe again, for fear of dying in the
me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n time!”</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33"/>
Mrs. Tyrold scarce noticed this declaration; but
his brother endeavoured to dissuade him from so sud∣den
and partial a measure: he would not, however,
listen; he made what speed he could down stairs,
called hastily for his hat and stick, commanded all
his servants to attend him, and muttering frequent
ejaculations to himself, that he would not trust to
changing his mind, he proceeded to the family cha∣pel,
and approaching with eager steps to the altar,
knelt down, and bidding every one hear and wit∣ness
what he said, made a solemn vow, “That it
he might be cleared of the crime of murder, by the
recovery of Eugenia, he would atone what he could
for the ill he had done her, by bequeathing to her
every thing he possessed in the world, in estate, cash,
and property, without the deduction of a sixpence.”</P>
<P>He told all present to remember and witness this,
in case of an apoplexy before his new will could be
written down.</P>
<P>Returning then to the house, lightened, he said,
from a load of self reproach, which had rendered
the last fortnight insupportable to him, he sent for
the attorney of a neighbouring town, and went up
stairs, with a firmer mind, to wait his arrival in the
sick room.</P>
<P>“O, my dear uncle,” cried his long banished Ca∣milla,
who hearing him upon the stairs, skipt lightly
after him, “how glad I am to see you again! I
almost thought I should see you no more!”</P>
<P>Here ended at once the just acquired tranquillity
of Sir Hugh; all his satisfaction forsook him at the
appearance of his little darling; he considered her
as an innocent creature whom he was preparing to
injure; he could not bear to look at her; his heart
smote him in her favour; his eyes filled with tears;
he was unable to go on, and with slow and trem∣bling
steps, he moved again towards his own room.</P>
<P>“My dearest uncle!” cried Camilla, holding by
his coat, and hanging upon his arm, “won't you
speak to me?”</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="34"/>
“Yes, my dear, to be sure I will,” he answered,
endeavouring to hide his emotion, “only not now;
so don't follow me Camilla, for I'm going to be re∣markably
busy!”</P>
<P>“O, uncle!” she cried, plaintively, “and I have
not seen you so long! And I have wished so to see
you! and I have been so unhappy about Eugenia!
and you have always locked your door; and I would
not rap hard at it, for fear you should be asleep:
But why would you not see me, uncle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and why
will you send me away?”</P>
<P>“My dear Camilla,” he replied, with increased
agitation, “I have used you very ill; I have been
your worst enemy, which is the very reason I don't
care to see you; so go away, I beg, for I am bad
enough without all this. But I give you my thanks
for all your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> playful gambols, having nothing
better now to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you; which is but a poor return
from an uncle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a niece!”</P>
<P>He then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself into his room, leaving Ca∣milla
drowned in tears at the outside of the door.</P>
<P>Wretch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in reflecting upon the shock and dis∣appointment
which the new disposition of his affairs
must occasion her, he had not fortitude to inform
her of his intention. He desired to speak with
Edgar Mandlebert, who, with all the Tyrold fa∣mily,
resided, for the present, at Cleves, and ab∣ruptly
related to him the new destination he had
just vowed of his wealth; beseeching that he would
break it in the softest manner to his poor little fa∣vourite,
assuring her she would be always the first in
his love, though a point of mere conscience had
forced him to make choice of another heiress.</P>
<P>Edgar, whose zeal to serve and oblige had never
been put to so severe a test, hesitated how to obey
this injunction; yet he would not refuse it, as he
found that all the servants of the house were enabled,
if they pleased, to anticipate more incautiously the
ill news. He followed her, therefore, into the gar∣den,
whither she had wandered to weep unobserved;
but he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stopt short at sight of her distress, con∣ceiving
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
his errand to be already known to her, and
determined to consult with Indiana, to whom he
communicated his terrible embassy, intreating her to
devise some consolation for her poor cousin.</P>
<P>Indiana felt too much chagrined at her own part
in this transaction, to give her attention to Camilla;
she murmurred without scruple at the deprivation of
what she had once expected for herself, and at an∣other
time for her brother; and expressed much re∣sentment
at the behaviour of her uncle, mingled
with something very near repining, not merely at
his late preference of Camilla, but even at the reco∣very
of the little Eugenia. Edgar heard her with
surprise, and wondered to find how much less her
beauty attracted him from the failure of her good
nature.</P>
<P>He now pursued the weeping Camilla, who, dis∣persing
her tears at his approach, pretended to be
picking some lavender, and keeping her eyes sted∣fastly
upon the bush, asked him if he would have
any? He took a sprig, but spoke to her in a voice
of such involuntary compassion, that she soon lost
her self-command, and the big drops again rolled
fast down her cheeks. Extremely concerned, he
strove gently to sooth her; but the expressions of
regret at her uncle's avoidance, which then escaped
her, soon convinced him his own task was still to be
performed. With anxious fear of the consequences
of a blow so unlooked for, he executed it with all
the speed, yet all the consideration in his power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Camilla, the moment she understood him, passion∣ately
clasped her hands, and exclaimed: “O if that
is all! If my uncle indeed loves me as well as before
all this; I am sure I can never, never be so wicked,
as to envy poor little Eugenia, who has suffered so
much, and almost been dying, because she will be
richer than I shall be!”</P>
<P>Edgar, delighted and relieved, thought she was
grown a thousand times more beautiful than In∣diana;
and eagerly taking her hand, ran with her
to the apartment of the poor disconsolate Sir Hugh;
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
where his own eyes soon overflowed from tenderness
and admiration, at the uncommon scene he witness∣ed,
of the generous affection with which Camilla
consoled the fond distress of her uncle, though
springing from her own disappointment and loss.</P>
<P>They staid till the arrival of the attorney, who
took the directions of Sir Hugh, and drew up, for
his immediate satisfaction, a short deed, making over,
according to his vow, all he should die possessed of▪
without any let or qualification whatsoever, to his
niece Eugenia. This was properly signed and
sealed, and Sir Hugh hastened up stairs with a copy
of it to Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>All remonstrance was ineffectual; his conscience,
he protested, could no other way be appeased; his
noble little Camilla had forgiven him her ill usage,
and he could now bear to look at the change for the
worse in Eugenia, without finding his heart-strings
ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the sight. “You,” he cried,
“brother, who do not know what it is I have suf∣fered
through my conscience, can't tell what it is to
get a little ease; for if she had died, you might all
have had the comfort to say 'twas I murdered her,
which would have given you the satisfaction of hav∣ing
had no hand in it. But then, what would have
become of poor me, having it all upon my own
head? However, now, thank Heaven, I have no
need to care about the matter; for as to the mere
loss of beauty, pretty as it is to look at, I hope it
is no such great injury, as she'll have a splendid for∣tune,
which is certainly a better thing, in point of
lasting. For as to beauty, Lord help us! what is
it? except just to the eye.”</P>
<P>He then walked up to the child, intending to kiss
her, but stopt and sighed involuntarily as he looked
at her, saying: “After all, she's not like the same
thing! no more than I am myself. I shall never
think I know her again, never as long as I live! I
can't so much as believe her to be the same, though
I am sure of its being true. However, it shall make
no change in my love for her, poor little dear, for
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's all my own doing: though innocently enough,
as to any meaning, God knows!”</P>
<P>It was still some time before the little girl reco∣vered,
and then a new misfortune became daily more
palpable, srom some latent and incurable mischief,
owing to her fall, which made her grow up with
one leg shorter than the other, and her whole figure
diminutive and deformed. These additional evils re∣counciled
her parents to the partial will of her uncle,
which they now, indeed, thought less wanting in
equity, since no other reparation could be offered to
the innocent sufferer for ills so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>mountable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Studies of a grown Gentleman.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the tumult of this affair subsided, Mr.
Tyrold and his family prepared to re-establish them∣selves
at Etherington; and Mrs. Tyrold, the great
inducement for the separation being over, was earnest
to take home again the disinherited Camilla. Sir
Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was now embit∣tered
by regret and remorse, had not courage to
make the smallest opposition; yet he spent the day
of her departure in groans and penitence. He
thought it right, however, to detain Eugenia, who,
as his decided heiress, was left to be brought up at
Cleves.</P>
<P>The loss of the amusing society of his favourite;
the disappointment he had inflicted upon her, and
the sweetness with which she had borne it, preyed in∣cessantly
upon his spirits; and he knew not how to
employ himself, which way to direct his thoughts,
nor in what manner to beguile one moment of his
time, after the children were gone to rest.</P>
<P>The view of the constant resources which his bro∣ther
found in literature, augmented his melancholy
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
at his own imperfections; and the steady industry
with which Mr. Tyrold, in early youth, had at∣tained
them, and which, while devoted to field sports,
he had often observed with wonder and pity, he
now looked back to with self-reproach, and recog∣nised
in its effect with a reverence almost awful.</P>
<P>His imagination, neither regulated by wisdom,
nor disciplined by experience, having once taken
this turn, he soon fancied that every earthly misfor∣tune
originated in a carelessness of learning, and that
all he wished, and all he wanted, upbraided him
with his ignorance. If disease and pain afflicted
him, he lamented the juvenile inattention that had
robbed him of acquirements which might have
taught him not to regard them; if the word <HI>scholar</HI>
was named in his presence, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaved the deepest
sigh; if an article in a newspaper, with which he
was unacquainted, was discussed, he reviled his early
heedlessness of study; and the mention of a com∣mon
pamphlet, which was unknown to him, gave
him a sensation of disgrace: even inevitable cala∣mities
he attributed to the negligence of his educa∣tion,
and construed every error, and every evil of
his life, to his youthful disrespect of Greek and
Latin.</P>
<P>Such was the state of his mind, when his ordi∣nary
maladies had the serious aggravation of a vio∣lent
fit of the gout.</P>
<P>In the midst of the acute anguish, and useless re∣pentance,
which now alternately ravaged his hap∣piness,
it suddenly occurred to him, that, perhaps,
with proper instruction, he might even yet obtain a
sufficient portion of this enviable knowledge, to en∣able
him to pass his evenings with some similarity to
his brother.</P>
<P>Revived by this suggestion, he sent for Mr. Ty∣rold,
to communicate to him his idea, and to beg
he would put him into a way to recover his lost
time, by recommending to him a tutor, with whom
he might set about a course of studies:—“Not that
I want,” cried he, “to make any particular great
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igure as a scholar; but if I could only learn just
enough to amuse me at odd hours, and make me for∣get
the gout, it's as much as I desire.”</P>
<P>The total impossibility that such a project should
answer its given purpose, deterred not Mr. Tyrold
from listening to his request. The mild philosophy
of his character saw whatever was lenient to human
sufferings as eligible, and looked no further for any
obstacles to the wisjhes of an another, than to in∣vestigate
if their gratification would be compatible
with innocence. He wrote, therefore, to a college
associate of his younger years, whom he knew to be
severely embarrassed in his affairs, and made pro∣posals
for settling him in the house of his brother.
These were not merely gratefully accepted by his old
friend, but drew forth a confession that he was daily
menaced with a public arrest for debts, which he had
incurred without luxury or extravagance, from mere
ignorance of the value of money, and of oeconomy.</P>
<P>In the award of cool reason, to attend to what is
impracticable, appears a folly which no inducement
can excuse. Mrs. Tyrold treated this scheme with
calm, but complete contempt. She allowed no
palliation for a measure of which the abortive end
was glaring; to hearken to it displeased her, as a
false indulgence of childish vanity; and her under∣standing
felt shocked that Mr. Tyrold would deign
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o humour his brother in an enterprise which must
In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vitably terminate in a fruitless consumption of
time.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh soon, but without anger, saw her dis∣approbation
of his plan; her opinions, from a high
superiority to all deceit, were as unreserved as those
of the baronet, from a nature incapable of caution.
He told her he was sorry to perceive that she thought
he should make no proficiency, but intreated her to
take notice there was at least no great presumption in
his attempt, as he meant to begin with the very be∣ginning,
and to go no farther at the first than any
young little school-boy; for he should give himself
fair play, by trying his hand with the rudiments,
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
which would no sooner be run over, than the rest
would become plain failing: “And if once,” he
added. “I should conquer the mastery of the classics,
I shall make but very short work of all the rest.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold saw, as forcibly as his wife, the utter
impossibility that Sir Hugh could now repair the
omissions of his youth; but he was willing to console
his want of knowledge, and sooth his mortifications;
and while he grieved for his bodily infirmities, and
pitied his mental repinings, he considered his idea as
not illaudable, though in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udicious, and in favour of
its blamelessness, forgave its absurdity.</P>
<P>He was gratified, also, in offering an honourable
provision to a man of learning in distress, whose
time and attention could not fail to deserve it, if de∣dicated
to his brother, in whatever way they might
be bestowed.</P>
<P>He took care to be at Cleves on the day Dr. Ork∣borne,
this gentleman, was expected, and he pre∣sented
him to Sir Hugh with every mark of regard,
as a companion in whose conversation, he slattered
himself, pain might be lightened, and seclusion from
mixt company cheerfully supported.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne expressed his gratitude for the kind∣ness
of Mr. Tyrold, and promised to make it his first
study to merit the high consideration with which he
had been called from his retirement.</P>
<P>A scholastic education was all that had been given
to Dr. Orkborne by his friends; and though in that
their hopes were answered, no prosperity followed.
His labours had been seconded by industry, but not
enforced by talents; and they soon found how wide
the difference between acquiring stores, and bringing
them into use. Application, operating upon a re∣tentive
memory, had enabled him to lay by the most
ample hoards of erudition; but these, though they
rendered him respectable amongst the learned, proved
nearly nugatory in his progress through the world,
from a total want of skill and penetration to know
how or where they might turn to any account. Ne∣vertheless,
his character was unexceptionable, his
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
manners were quiet, and his fortune was ruined.
These were the motives which induced rather the
benevolence than the selection of Mr. Tyrold to
name him to his brother, in the hope that, while
an asylum at Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s would exonerate him from all
pecuniary hardships, his very deficiency in brilliancy
of parts, and knowledge of mankind, which, though
differently modified, was equal to that of Sir Hugh
himself, would obviate regret of more cultivated so∣ciety,
and facilitate their reciprocal satisfaction.</P>
<P>The introduction over, Mr. Tyrold sought by ge∣neral
topics to forward their acquaintance, before
any allusion should be made to the professed plan of
Sir Hugh; but Sir Hugh was too well pleased with
its ingenuity to be ashamed of its avowal; he began,
therefore, immediately to descant upon the indolence
of his early years, and to impeach the want of timely
severity in his instructors: “For there is an old
saying,” he cried, “but remarkably true, That
learning is better than house or land; which I am
an instance of myself, for I have house and land
plenty, yet don't know what to do with them pro∣perly,
nor with myself neither, for want of a little
notion of things to guide me by.” His brother, he
added, had been too partial in thinking him already
sitted for such a master as Dr. Orkborne; though
he promised, notwithstanding his time of life, to be∣come
the most docile of pupils, and he hoped before
long to do no discredit to the Doctor as his tutor.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, whose own benign <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuntenance could
scarce refrain from a smile at this unqualified opening,
endeavoured to divert to some other subject the
grave as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onishment of Dr. Orkborne, who, previ∣ously
aware of the age and ill health of the baronet,
naturally concluded himself called upon to solace the
privacy of his life by reading or discourse, but sug∣gested
not the most distant surmise he could be sum∣moned
as a preceptor.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, however, far from palliating any design,
disguised not even a feeling; he plunged deeper and
deeper in the acknowledgment of his ignorance, and
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>
soon set wholly apart the delicate circumspection of
his brother, by demanding of Dr. Orkborne what
book he thought he had best buy for a beginning?</P>
<P>Receiving from the wondering Doctor no answer,
he good humouredly added, “Come, don't be
ashamed to name the easiest, for this reason; you
must know my plan is one of my own, which it is
right to tell you. As fast as I get on, I intend, for
the sake of remembering my lesson, to send for one
of my nephews, and teach it all over again to him
myself; which will be doing service to us all at
once.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now, though for a sew moments he
looked down, thought it best to leave the matter to
its own course, and Dr. Orkborne to his own ob∣servations;
fully persuaded, that the smiles Sir Hugh
might excite would be transient, and that no serious
or lasting ridicule could be attached to his character,
in the mind of a worthy man, to whom time and
opportunity would be allowed for an acquaintance
with its habitual beneficence. He excused himself,
therefore, from staying any longer, somewhat to the
distress of Dr. Orkborne, but hardly with the notice
of the baronet, whose eagerness in his new pursuit
completely engrossed him.</P>
<P>His late adventure, and his new h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iress, now tor∣mented
him no more; Indiana was forgotten, Ca∣milla
but little thought of, and his whole mind be∣came
exclusively occupied by this fruitful expedient
for retrieving his lost time.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, whose life had been spent in any
study rather than that of human nature, was so little
able to enter into the character of Sir Hugh, that
nothing less than the respect he knew to be due to
Mr. Tyrold, could have saved him, upon his first re∣ception,
from a suspicion that he had been summoned
in mere mockery. The situation, however, was pe∣culiarly
desirable to him, and the experiment, in the
beginning, co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>responded with the hopes of Mr. Ty∣rold.
Placed suddenly in ease and affluence, Dr.
Orkborne, with the most profound desire to please,
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
sought to sustain so convenient a post, by obliging
the patron, whom he soon saw it would be vain to
attempt improving; while Sir Hugh, in return, pro∣fessed
himself the most fortunate of men, that he
had now met with a scholar who had the good nature
not to despise him.</P>
<P>Relief from care thus combining with opportunity,
Dr. Orkborne was scarce settled, ere he determined
upon the execution of a long, critical, and difficult
work in philology, which he had often had in con∣templation,
but never found leisure to undertake. By
this means he had a constant resource for himself;
and the baronet, observing that time never hung
heavy upon his hands, conceived a yet higher ad∣miration
of learning, and felt his spirits proportion∣ably
re-animated by the fair prospect of participating
in such advantages.</P>
<P>From this dream, however, he was soon awakened:
a parcel, by the direction of Dr. Orkborne, arrived
from his bookseller, with materials for going to
work.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then sent off a message to the parsonage∣house,
informing his brother and his family, that
they must not be surprised if they did not see or hear
of him for some time, as he had got his hands quite
full, and should be particularly engaged for a week
or two to come.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, still but imperfectly conceiving the
extent, either of the plan, or of the simplicity of
his new pupil, proposed, as soon as the packet was
opened, that they should read together; but Sir
Hugh replied, that he would do the whole in order,
and by no means skip the rudiments.</P>
<P>The disappointment which followed, may be easily
imagined; with neither quickness to learn, nor me∣mory
to retain, he aimed at being initiated in the
elements of a dead language, for which youth only
can find time and application, and even youth but by
compulsion. His head soon became confused, his
ideas were all perplexed, his attention was vainly
strained, and his faculties were totally disordered.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44"/>
Astonished at his own disturbance, which he attri∣buted
solely to not getting yet into the right mode,
he laughed off his chagrin, but was steady in his
perseverance; and continued wholly shut up from his
family and friends, with a zeal worthy better success.</P>
<P>Lesson after lesson, however, only aggravated his
difficulties, till his intellects grew so embarrassed he
scarce knew if he slept or waked. His night be∣came
infected by the perturbation of the day; his
health visibly suffered from the restlessness of both,
and all his flattering hopes of new and unknown
happiness were ere long exchanged for despair.</P>
<P>He now sent for his brother, and desired to speak
with him alone; when, catching him fast by the
hand, and looking piteously in his face, “Do you
know, my dear brother,” he cried, “I find myself
turning out as sheer a blockhead as ever, for all I
have got so many more years over my head than
when I began all this hard jingle jangle before?”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, with greater concern than surprise,
endeavoured to re-assure and console him, by pointing
out a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad more attainable for reaping benefit from
the presence of Dr. Orkborne, than the impracticable
path into which he had erroneously entered.</P>
<P>“Ah! no, my dear brother,” he answered; “if
I don't succeed this way, I am sure I shall succeed
no other; for as to pains, I could not have taken
more if I had been afraid to be flogged once a-day:
and that gentleman has done all he can, too, as far as I
know to the contrary. But I really think, whatever's
the meaning of it, there's some people can't learn.</P>
<P>Then, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking his head, he added, in a low voice:
“To say the truth, I might as well have given it up
from the very first, for any great comfort I found in
it, if it had not been for fear of hurting that gen∣tleman;
however, don't let the poor g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntleman know
that; for I've no right to turn him off up in nothing,
merely for the fault of my having no head, which
how can he help?”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold agreed in the justice of this reflection,
and undertook to deliberate upon some conciliatory
expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45"/>
Sir Hugh heartily thanked him; “But only in
the mean time that you are thinking,” cried he,
“how shall I bring it about to stop him from coming
to me with all those books for my study? For, do
you know, my dear brother, because I asked him to
buy me one for my beginning, he sent for a full
score? And when he comes to me about my lesson,
he brings them all upon me together: which is one
thing, for ought I know, that helps to confuse me; for
I am wondering all the while when I shall get through
with them. However, say nothing of all this before the
poor gentleman, for fear he should take it as a hint;
which might put him out of heart: for which reason
I'd rather take another lesson, Lord help me!—than
vex him.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold promised his best consideration, and
to se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him again the next morning. But he had
hardly left Cleves ten minutes, when a man and horse
came galloping after him, with a petition that he
would return without delay.</P>
<P>The baronet received him with a countenance re∣novated
with self-complacency. “I won't trouble
you,” he cried, “to think any more; for now I
have got a plan of my own, which I will tell you.
Not to throw this good gentleman entirely away, I
intend having a sort of a kind of school set up here
in my sick room, and so to let all my nephews come,
and say their tasks to him in my hearing; and then,
who knows but I may pick up a little amongst them
myself, without all this hard study?”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold stated the obvious objections to fo
wild a scheme; but he besought him not to oppose
it, as there was no other way for him to get rid of
his tutoring, without sending off Dr. Orkborne.
He desired, therefore, that Lionel might come in∣stantly
to Cleves; saying, I shall write myself to
Eton, by the means of the Doctor, to tell the
Master I shall take Clermont entirely home after
the next holidays, for the sake of having him study
under my own eye.”</P>
<P>He then entreated him to prepare Dr. Orkborne
for his new avocation.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="46"/>
Mr. Tyrold, who saw that in this plan the in∣ventor
alone could be disappointed, made no further
remonstrance, and communicated the design to Dr.
Orkborne; who, growing now deeply engaged in his
own undertaking, was perfectly indifferent to whom
or to what his occasional attendance might be given.</P>

<P>MRS. TYROLD expressed much astonishment that
her husband could afford any countenance to this new
plan. “Your expectations from it,” she cried, “can
be no higher than my own; you have certainly some
influence with your brother; why, then, will you
suffer him thus egregiously to expose himself?”</P>
<P>“I cannot protect his pride,” answered Mr. Tyrold,
“at the expence of his comfort. His faculties want
some object, his thoughts some employment. Inac∣tion
bodily and intellectual pervading the same cha∣racter,
cannot but six disgust upon every stage and
every state of life. Vice alone is worse than such
double inertion. Where mental vigour can be kept
alive without offence to religion and virtue, inno∣cence
as well as happiness is promoted; and the
starter of difficulties with regard to the means which
point to such an end, inadvertently risks both. To
save the mind from preying inwardly upon itself▪ it
must be encouraged to some outward pursuit. There
is no other way to elude apathy, or escape discon∣tent;
none other to guard the temper from that
quarrel with itself, which ultimately ends in quarrel∣ling
with all mankind.”</P>
<P>“But may you not, by refusing to send him
your son, induce him to seek recreation in some
more rational way?”</P>
<P>“Recreation, my dear Georgiana, must be spon∣taneous.
Bidden pleasures fly the perversity of our
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
tastes. Let us take care, then, scrupulously, of our
duties, but suffer our amusements to take care of
themselves. A project, a pastime, such as this, is,
at least, as harmless as it is hopeless, since the utmost
sport of wit, or acrimony of malice, can only fasten
a laugh upon it: and how few are the diversions
of the rich and indolent that can so lightly be ac∣quitted!”</P>
<P>Lionel, the new young student, speedily, though
but little to her satisfaction, abetted the judgment
of his mother. He was no sooner summoned to
Cleves, than, enchanted to find himself a fellow∣pupil
with his uncle, he conceived the highest ideas
of his own premature genius: and when this vanity,
from the avowed ignorance of the artless baronet,
subsided, it was only replaced by a sovereign con∣tempt
of his new associate. He made the most
pompous display of his own little acquirements; he
took every opportunity to ask questions of Sir Hugh
which he knew he could not answer; and he would
sometimes, with an arch mock solemnity, carry his
exercise to him, and beg his assistance.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh bore this juvenile impertinence with un∣shaken
good humour. But the spirits of Lionel
were too mutinous for such lenity: he grew bolder
in his attacks, and more searless of consequences;
and in a very short time, his uncle seemed to him
little more than the butt at which he might level
the shafts of his rising triumph; till tired, at length,
though not angry, the baronet applied to Dr. Ork∣borne,
and begged he would teach him, out of
hand, some little smattering of Latin sentences, by
which he might make the young pedant think bet∣ter
of him.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne complied, and wrote him a few
brief exercises; but these, after toiling day and
night to learn, he pronounced so ill, and so con∣stantly
misapplied, that, far from impressing his fel∣low-labourer
with more respect, the moment he ut∣tered
a single word of his new lesson, the boy almost
rolled upon the floor with convulsive merriment.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48"/>
Sir Hugh, with whom these phrases neither lost
nor gained by mistaking one word for another, ap∣pealed
to Dr. Orkborne to remedy what he conceiv∣ed
to be an unaccountable failure. Dr. Orkborne,
absorbed in his new personal pursuit, to which he
daily grew more devoted, was carnest to be as little
as possible interrupted, and therefore only advised
him to study his last lesson, before he pressed for
any thing new.</P>
<P>Study, however, was unavailing, and he heard
this injunction with despair; but finding it con∣stantly
repeated upon every application for help, he
was seized again with a horror of the whole attempt,
and begged to consult with Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>“This gentleman you have recommended to me
for my tutor,” he cried, “is certainly a great scho∣lar;
I don't mean to doubt that the least in the
world, being no judge: and he is complaisant enough
too, considering all that; but yet I have rather a
suspicion he is afraid I shall make no hand of it;
which is a thing so disheartening to a person in the
line of improvement, that, to tell you the honest
truth, I am thinking of giving the whole up at a
blow; for, Lord help me! what shall I be the bet∣ter
for knowing Latin and Greek? It's not worth
a man's while to think of it, after being a boy.
And so, if you please, I'd rather you'd take Lionel
home again.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold agreed; but asked what he meant to
do further concerning the Doctor?</P>
<P>“Why that, brother, is the very thing my poor
ignorant head wants your advice for: because, as
to that plan about our learning all together, I see
it won't do; for either the boys will grow up to
be no better scholars than their uncle, which is to
say, none at all; or else they'll hold every body
cheap, when they meet with a person knowing no∣thing;
so I'll have no more hand in it. And I shall
really be glad enough to get such a thing off my
mind; for it's been weight enough upon it from the
beginning.”</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49"/>
He then desired the opinion of Mr. Tyrold what
step he should take to prevent the arrival of Cler∣mont
Lynmere, whom, he said, he dreaded to see,
being determined to have no more little boys about
him for some time to come.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold recommended re-settling him at Eton:
but Sir Hugh declared he could not possibly do that,
because the poor little fellow had written him word
he was glad to leave school. “And I don't doubt,”
he added, “but he'll make the best figure of us all;
because I had him put in the right mode from the
first; though, I must needs own, I had as lieve see
him a mere dunce all his life, supposing I should live
so long, which God forbid in regard to his dying,
as have him turn out a mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coxcomb of a pedant,
laughing and grinning at every body that can't spell
a Greek noun.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold promised to take the matter into con∣sideration;
but early the next morning, the baronet
again summoned him, and joyfully made known,
that a scheme had come into his own head, which
answered all purposes. In the first place, he said,
he had really taken so prodigious a dislike to learn∣ing,
that he was determined to send Clermont over
the seas, to finish his Greek and Latin; not be∣cause
he was fond of foreign parts, but for fear, if
he should let him come to Cleves, the great distaste
he had now conceived against those sort of lan∣guages,
might disgust the poor boy from his book.
And he had most luckily recollected, in the middle
of the night, that he had a dear friend, one Mr.
Westwyn, who was going the very next month to
carry his own son to Leipsic; which was just what
had put the thought into his head; because, by that
means, Clermont might be removed from one study∣ing
place to t'other, without loss of time.</P>
<P>“But for all that,” he continued, “as this good
gentleman here has been doing no harm, I won't
have him become a sufferer for my changing my mind:
and so, not to affront him by giving him nothing to
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>
do, which would be like saying, `You may go your
ways,' I intend he should try Indiana.”</P>
<P>Observing Mr. Tyrold now look with the ex∣tremest
surprise, he added; “To be sure, being a
girl, it is rather out of the way; but as there is
never another boy, what can I do? Besides I shan't
so much mind her getting a little learning, because
she's not likely to make much hand of it. And
this one thing, I can tell you, which I have learnt
of my own accord; I'll never press a person to set
about studying at my time of life as long as I live,
knowing what a plague it is.”</P>
<P>Lionel returned to Etherington with his father,
and the rest of the scheme was put into execution
without delay. Mr. Westwyn conveyed Clermont
from Eton to Leipsic, where he settled him with
the preceptor and masters appointed for his own
son; and Dr. Orkborne was desired to become the
tutor of Indiana.</P>
<P>At first, quitting his learned residence, the Doctor
might indignantly have blushed at the proposition
of an employment so much beneath his abilities:
but he now heard it without the smallest emotion;
sedately revolving in his mind, that his literary work
would not be affected by the ignorance or absurdity
of his several pupils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tuition of a young Lady.</HEAD>
<P>THE <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air Indiana participated not in the philoso∣phy
of her preceptor. The first mention of tak∣ing
lessons produced an aversion unconquerable to
their teacher; and the first question he asked her at
the appointed hour for study, was answered by a
burst of tears.</P>
<P>To Dr. Orkborne this sorrow would have proved
no impediment to their proceeding, as he hardly
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
noticed it; but Sir Hugh, extremely affected, kindly
kissed her, and said he would beg her off for this
time. The next day, however, gave rise but to a
similar scene; and the next which followed would
precisely have resembled it, had not the promise of
some new finery of attire dispersed the pearly drops
that were preparing to fall.</P>
<P>The uncommon beauty of India had made her
infancy adored, and her childhood indulged by al∣most
all who had seen her. The brilliant picture she
presented to the eye by her smiles and her spirits,
rendered the devastation caused by crying, pouting,
or fretfulness so striking, and so painful to behold,
that not alone her uncle, but every servant in the
house, and every stranger who visited it, granted to
her lamentations whatever they demanded, to relieve
their own impatience at the loss of so pleasing an
image. Accustomed, therefore, never to weep with∣out
advantage, she was in the constant habit of giv∣ing
unbridled vent to her tears upon the smallest con∣tradiction,
well knowing that not to spoil her pretty
eyes by crying, was the current maxim of the whole
house.</P>
<P>Unused, by this means, to any trouble or appli∣cation,
the purposed tuition of Dr. Orkborne ap∣peared
a burden to her intolerable; yet weeping, her
standing resource, was with him utterly vain; her
tears were unimportant to one who had taken no no∣tice
of her smiles; and, intent upon his own learned
ruminations, he never even looked at her.</P>
<P>Bribery, day after day, could procure but a few
instants attention, given so unwillingly, and so spee∣dily
withdrawn, that trinkets, dress, and excursions
were soon exhausted, without the smallest advance∣ment.
The general indulgence of the baronet made
partial favours of small efficacy; and Indiana was
sooner tired of receiving, than he of presenting, his
offerings.</P>
<P>She applied, therefore, at length to the governess,
whose expostulations, she knew by experience, were
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>
precisely what Sir Hugh most sedulously aimed to
avoid.</P>
<P>Miss Marg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and was a woman of family and fashion,
but reduced, through the gaming and extravagance
of her father, to such indigence, that, after sundry
failures in higher attempts, she was compelled to ac∣quiesce
in the good offices of her friends, which placed
her as a governess in the house of Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>To Indiana, however, she was but nominally a
tutoress; neglected in her own education, there was
nothing she could teach, though, born and bred in
the circle of fashion, she imagined she had nothing
to learn. And, while a mind proudly shallow kept
her unacquainted with her own deficiencies, her for∣mer
rank in society imposed an equal ignorance of
them upon Sir Hugh. But, notwithstanding he
implicitly gave her credit for possessing whatever she
assumed, he sound her of a temper so unpleasant,
and so irritable to ossence, that he made it a rule
never to differ from her. The irksomeness of this
restraint induced him to keep as much as possible out
of her way; though respect and pity for her birth
and her misfortunes, led him to resolve never to part
with her till Indiana was married.</P>
<P>The spirit of Miss Margland was as haughty as
her intellects were weak; and her disposition was so
querulous, that, in her constant suspicion of humi∣liation,
she seemed always looking for an affront,
and ready primed for a contest.</P>
<P>She seized with pleasure the opportunity offered
her by Indiana, of remonstrating against this new
system of education; readily allowing, that any ac∣complishment
beyond what she had herself acquired,
would be completely a work of supererogation. She
represented dictatorily her objections to the baronet.
Miss Lynmere, she said, though both beautiful and
well brought up, could never cope with so great a
disadvantage as the knowledge of Latin: “Consider,
Sir,” she cried, “what an obstacle it will prove to
her making her way in the great world, when she
comes to be of a proper age for thinking of an
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
establishment. What gentleman will you ever find
that will bear with a learned wife? except some mere
downright fogrum, that no young lady of fashion
could endure.”</P>
<P>She then spoke of the danger of injuring her
beauty by study; and ran over all the qualifications
really necessary for a young lady to attain, which
consisted simply of an enumeration of all she had her∣self
attempted; a little music, a little drawing, and
a little dancing; which should all, she added, be but
slightly pursued, to distinguish a lady of fashion
from an artist.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, a good deal disturbed, because unable
to answer her, thought it would be best to interest
Dr. Orkborne in his plan, and to beg him to recon∣cile
her to its execution. He sent, therefore, a
message to the Doctor, to beg to speak with him
immediately.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne promised to wait upon him without
delay: but he was at that moment hunting for a
passage in a Greek author, and presently forgot both
the promise and the request.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, concluding nothing but sickness could
detain him, went to his apartment; where, finding
him perfectly well, he stared at him a moment; and
then, sitting down, begged him to make no apo∣logy,
for he could tell his business there as well as
any where else.</P>
<P>He gave a long and copious relation of the ob∣jections
of Miss Margland, earnestly begging Dr.
Orkborne would save him from such another ha∣rangue,
it being bad for his health, by undertaking
to give her the proper notion of things himself.</P>
<P>The Doctor, who had just found the passage for
which he had been seeking, heard not one word that
he said.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, receiving no answer, imagined him to
be weighing the substance of his narration; and,
therefore, bidding him not worry his brain too
much, offered him half an hour to fix upon what
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>
should be done; and returned quietly to his own
room.</P>
<P>Here he sat, counting the minutes, with his watch
in his hand, till the time stipulated arrived: but
finding Dr. Orkborne let it pass without any notice,
he again took the trouble of going back to his apart∣ment.</P>
<P>He then eagerly asked what plan he had formed?</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, much incommoded by this second
interruption, coldly begged to know his pleasure.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, with great patience, though much sur∣prise,
repeated the whole, word for word, over again:
but the history was far too long for Dr. Orkborne,
whose attention, after the first sentence or two, was
completely restored to his Greek quotation, which
he was in the act of transcribing when Sir Hugh re∣entered
the room.</P>
<P>The baronet, at length, more categorically said,
“Don't be so shy of speaking out, Doctor; though
I am afraid, by your silence, you've rather a notion
poor Indiana will never get on; which, perhaps,
makes you think it not worth while contradicting
Mrs. Margland? Come, speak out!—Is that the
case with the poor girl?”</P>
<P>“Yes, Sir,” answered Dr. Orkborne, with great
composure; though perfectly unconscious of the
proposition to which he assented.</P>
<P>“Lack-a day! if I was not always afraid she had
rather a turn to being a dunce! So it's your opi∣nion
it won't do, then?”</P>
<P>“Yes, Sir,” again replied the Doctor; his eye
the whole time fastened upon the passage which oc∣cupied
his thoughts.</P>
<P>“Why then we are all at a stand again! This is
worse than I thought for! So the poor dear girl has
really no head?—Hay, Doctor?—Do speak, pray?
—Don't mind vexing me. Say so at once, if you
can't help thinking it.”</P>
<P>Another extorted, “Yes, Sir,” completely over∣set
Sir Hugh; who, imputing the absent and per∣plexed
air with which it was pronounced to an un∣willingness
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
to give pain, shook him by the hand, and▪
quitting the room, ordered his carriage, and set off
for Etherington.</P>
<P>“Oh, brother,” he cried; “Indiana's the best
girl in the world, as well as the prettiest; but, do
you know, Dr. Orkborne says she has got no brains!
So there's an end of that scheme! However, I have
now thought of another that will settle all differ∣ences.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold hoped it was an entire discontinuance
of all pupilage and tutorship; and that Dr. Orkborne
might henceforth be considered as a mere family friend.</P>
<P>“No, no, my dear brother, no! 'tis a better
thing than that, as you shall hear. You must know
I have often been concerned to think how glum poor
Clermont will look when he hears of my will in fa∣vour
of Eugenia; which was my chief reason in
my own private mind, for not caring to see him be∣fore
he went abroad; but I have made myself quite
easy about him now, by resolving to set little Eu∣genia
upon learning the classics.”</P>
<P>“Eugenia! and of what benefit will that prove
to Clermont?”</P>
<P>“Why, as soon as she grows a little old, that is
to say, a young woman, I intend, with your good
will and my sister's, to marry her to Clermont.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold smiled, but declared his entire con∣currence,
if the young people, when they grew up,
wished for the alliance.</P>
<P>“As to that,” said he, “I mean to make sure
work, by having them educated exactly to fit one
another. I shall order Clermont to think of nothing
but his studies till the proper time; and as to Eu∣genia,
I shall make her a wife after his own heart,
by the help of this gentleman; for I intend to bid
him teach her just like a man, which, as she's so
young, may be done from the beginning, the same
as if she was a boy.”</P>
<P>He then enumerated the advantages of this pro∣ject,
which would save Clermont from all disappoint∣ment,
by still making over to him his whole fortune,
<PB N="56" REF="56"/>
with a wife ready formed into a complete scholar for
him into the bargain. It would also hinder Eugenia
from being a prey to some fop for her money, who,
being no relation, could not have so good a right to
it; and it would prevent any affront to Dr. Orkborne,
by keeping him a constant tight task in hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold forbore to chagrin him with any strong
expostulation, and he returned, therefore, to Cleves
in full glee. He repaired immediately to the apart∣ment
of the Doctor, who, only by what was now
said, was apprized of what had passed before. Some∣what,
therefore, alarmed, to understand that the
studies of Indiana were to be relinquished, he exerted
all the alacrity in his power for accepting his new
little pupil: not from any idea of preference; for
he concluded the incapacity of Indiana to be rather
that of her sex than of an individual; but from con∣ceiving
that his commodious abode at Cleves depend∣ed
upon his retaining one scholar in the family. Eu∣genia
therefore was called, and the lessons were begun.</P>
<P>The little girl, who was naturally of a thoughtful
turn, and whose state of health deprived her of most
childish amusements, was well contented with the ar∣rangement,
and soon made a progress so satisfactory
to Dr. Orkborne, that Sir Hugh, letting his mind
now rest from all other schemes, became fully and
happily occupied by the prosecution of his last sug∣gestion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lost Labour.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this period, the families of Etherington
and Cleves lived in the enjoyment of uninterrupted
harmony and repose, till Eugenia, the most juvenile
of the set, had attained her fifteenth year.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="57"/>
Sir Hugh then wrote to Leipsie, desiring his
nephew Lynmere to return home without delay.
“Not that I intend,” he said to Mr. Tyrold,
“marrying them together at this young age, Eu∣genia
being but a child, except in point of Latin;
though I assure you, my dear brother, she's the most
sensible of the whole, poor Indiana being nothing to
her, for all her prettiness; but the thing is, the
sooner Clermont comes over, the sooner they may
begin forming the proper regard.”</P>
<P>The knowledge of this projected alliance was by
no means confined to Sir Hugh and Mr. and Mrs.
Tyrold; it was known throughout the family, though
never publicly announced, and understood from her
childhood by Eugenia herself, though Mrs. Tyrold
had exerted her utmost authority to prevent Sir
Hugh from apprizing her of it in form. It was ne∣vertheless,
the joy of his heart to prepare the young
people for each other: and his scheme received every
encouragement he could desire, from the zeal and
uncommon progress in her studies made by Eugenia;
which most happily corresponded with all his in∣junctions
to Leipsic, for the application and acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ments
of Clermont.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, it was a blow to him the
most unexpected, to receive from the young bride∣groom
elect, in answer to his summons home, a peti∣tion
to make the tour of Europe, while yet on the
continent.</P>
<P>“What!” cried Sir Hugh, “and is this all his
care for us? after so many years separation from his
kin and kind, has he no natural longings to see his
native land? no yearnings to know his own relations
from strangers?”</P>
<P>Eugenia, notwithstanding her extreme youth, se∣cretly
applauded and admired a search of knowledge
she would gladly have participated; though she was
not incurious to see the youth she considered as her
destined partner for life, and to whom all her literary
labours had been directed: for the never-failing me∣thod
of Sir Hugh to stimulate her if she was idle,
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
had been to assure her that, unless she worked
harder, her cousin Clermont would eclipse her.</P>
<P>She had now acquired a decided taste for study,
which, however unusual for her age, most fortunately
rescued from weariness or sadness the sedentary life,
which a weak state of health compelled her to lead.
This induced her to look with pleasure upon Cler∣mont
as the object of her emulation, and to prose∣cute
every plan for her improvement, with that vi∣gour
which accompanies a pursuit of our own choice;
the only labour that asks no relaxation.</P>
<P>Steady occupations, such as these, kept off all
attention to her personal misfortunes, which Sir
Hugh had strictly ordered should never be alluded
to; first, he said, for fear they should vex her; and
next, lest they should make her hate him, for being
their cause. Those incidents, therefore, from never
being named, glided imperceptibly from her thoughts;
and she grew up as unconscious as she was innocent,
that, though born with a beauty which surpassed
that of her lovely sisters, disease and accident had
robbed her of that charm ere she knew she possessed
it. But neither disease nor accident had power over
her mind; there, in its purest proportions, moral
beauty preserved its first energy. The equanimity
of her temper made her seem, though a female, born
to be a practical philosopher; her abilities and her
sentiments were each of the highest class, uniting
the best adorned intellects with the best principled
virtues.</P>
<P>The dissatisfaction of Sir Hugh with his nephew
reached not to prohibition: his consent was painful,
but his remittances were generous, and Clermont had
three years allowed him for his travels through Eu∣rope.</P>
<P>Yet this permission was no sooner granted than the
baronet again became dejected. Three years ap∣peared
to him to be endless: he could hardly per∣suade
himself to look forward to them with expecta¦tion
of life; and all the learned labours he had pro∣moted
seemed vain and unpromising, ill requiting his
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>
toils, and still less answering his hopes. Even the
studious turn of Eugenia, hitherto his first delight,
he now thought served but to render her unsociable;
and the time she devoted to study, he began to regret
as lost to himself; nor could he suggest any possible
consolation for his drooping spirits, till it occurred to
him that Camilla might again enliven him.</P>
<P>This idea, and the order for his carriage, were the
birth of the same moment; and, upon entering the
study of Mr. Tyrold, he abruptly exclaimed, “My
dear brother, I must have Camilla back! Indiana
says nothing to amuse me; and Eugenia is so bookish,
I might as well live with an old woman; which God
forbid I should object to, only I like Camilla better.”</P>
<P>This request was by no means welcome to Mr.
Tyrold, and utterly distasteful to his lady. Camilla
was now just seventeen years of age, and attractively
lovely; but of a character that called for more at∣tention
to its developement than to its formation;
though of a disposition so engaging, that affection
kept pace with watchfulness, and her fond parents
knew as little for their own sakes as for her's how to
part with her.</P>
<P>Her qualities had a power which, without con∣sciousness
how, or consideration why, governed her
whole family. The airy thoughtlessness of her nature
was a source of perpetual amusement; and, if some∣times
her vivacity raised a fear for her discretion, the
innocence of her mind reassured them after every
alarm. The interest which she excited served to
render her the first object of the house; it was just
short of solicitude, yet kept it constantly alive. Her
spirits were volatile, but her heart was tender; her
gaiety had a fascination; her persuasion was irre∣sistible.</P>
<P>To give her now up to Sir Hugh, seemed to Mrs.
Tyrold rather impossible than disagreeable; but he
was too urgent with his brother to be wholly refused.
She was granted him, therefore, as a guest, for the
three ensuing months, to aid him to dissipate his im∣mediate
disappointment, from the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crastinated ab∣sence
of Clermont.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60"/>
Sir Hugh received back his first favourite with all
the fond glee of a ductile imagination, which in every
new good sees a refuge from every past or present
evil. But, as the extremest distaste of all literature
now succeeded those sanguine views which had lately
made it his exclusive object, the first words he spoke
upon her arrival were, to inform her she must learn
no Latin; and the first step which followed her wel∣come,
was a solemn charge to Dr. Orkborne, that
he must give her no lessons.</P>
<P>The gaiety, the spirit, the playful good humour
of Camilla, had lost nothing of their charm by added
years, though her understanding had been sedulously
cultivated, and her principles modelled by the pure
and practical tenets of her exemplary parents. The
delight of Sir Hugh in regaining her, consisted not
merely of the renovation of his first prejudice in her
favour; it was strengthened by the restoration it af∣forded
his own mind to its natural state, and the relief
of being disburthened of a task he was so ill cal∣culated
to undertake, as superintending, in any sort,
intellectual pursuits.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">New Projects.</HEAD>
<P>THE baronet would, at length, have enjoyed
perfect contentment, had he not been molested by
the teasing spirit of Miss Margland, now daily at
work in proposing a journey to London, and in re∣presenting
as an indispensable duty, that the young
ladies should see and be seen, in a manner suitable to
their situation in life.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, equally void either of taste or of
resources for the country, had languished and fretted
away twelve years in its bosom, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no other open∣ing
to any satisfaction beyond a maintenance, except
<PB N="61" REF="61"/>
what she secretly nourished in her hopes, that, when
her beautiful pupil was grown up, she should accom∣pany
her to the metropolis. Her former connections
and acquaintance in high life still continued to be the
stationary pride of her heart, the constant theme of
her discourse, and the perpetual allusion of some la∣mentation
and regret. This excursion, therefore, in
prospect, had been her sole support during her re∣tirement;
nor had she failed to instruct her fair dis∣ciple
to aid her scheme, though she had kept from
her its private motive.</P>
<P>Most successfully, indeed, had she instilled into the
youthful breast of Indiana, a wondering curiosity to
see the place which she described as the sole residence
of elegance and fashion, and an eager impatience to
exhibit there a person which she was assured would
meet with universal homage.</P>
<P>But neither the exhortations of the governess, nor
the wishes of her pupil, could in this point move Sir
Hugh. He had a fixt aversion to London, and to
all public places, and had constantly some disaster to
relate of every visit he had accidentally made to them.
The amusements which had decided his partiality for
the country were now, indeed, no longer within his
reach; but his sanguine temper, which occasionally
entertained him with hopes of a recovery, determined
him always to keep upon the right spot, he said, for
sport, in case of any sudden and favourable change
in his health.</P>
<P>Upon the visit of Camilla, Miss Margland grew
yet more urgent, expecting through her powerful
influence to gain her point. She strove, therefore,
to engage her intercession, but Camilla, careless, easy
and gay, had no wish about the matter, and could
not be brought into the cabal.</P>
<P>This disappointment so much soured and provoked
Miss Margland, that she lost the usual discretion she
had hitherto practised, of confining her remonstrances
to those times when she saw Sir Hugh alone. Such
opportunities, indeed, weary of the use she made of
them, the baronet contrived daily to lessen; but every
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
meeting now, whether public or private, was seized
alike for the same purpose, and the necessity of
<HI>bringing the young ladies out,</HI> and the duty of <HI>thinking
of their establishment,</HI> were the sentences with which
he was so regularly assailed, that the moment he saw
her he prepared to hear them, and commonly with
an heavy sigh anticipated their fatigue to his spirits.</P>
<P>No arguments, however, relative to disposing of
the young ladies, had any weight with him; he had
long planned to give Eugenia to Clermont Lynmere,
and he depended upon Edgar Mandlebert for In∣diana,
while with regard to Camilla, to keep her
unmarried, that he might detain her under his own
roof, was the favourite wish of his heart. Never∣theless,
this perpetual persecution became by degrees
insupportable, and, unused to be deaf to any claimant,
he was upon the point of constrained compliance,
when his passion for forming schemes came again to
his aid, upon hearing that Edgar Mandlebert, after
a twelvemonth's absence, was just returned to Ether∣ington.</P>
<P>This youth had been making the tour of England,
Wales, and Scotland, with Dr. Marchmont, who
had been induced by Mr. Tyrold to relinquish all
other avocations, and devote to him his whole time.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh hastening, upon this news, to the par∣sonage-house,
said: “Don't imagine, brother, I am
going to make any complaint against Mrs. Margland,
for she is an excellent governess, and I have no fault
to find with her, except her making too many ob∣jections,
which I take to be her worst part; but as
every body has something, it would be very unfair
to quarrel with her for such a mere nothing, especially
as she can't help it, after so many years going on
the same way, without coming to a stop; but the
thing I have thought of now may set it all to rights,
which I hope you'll approve, and especially my
sister.”</P>
<P>He then explained, that as he had fixt upon
marrying Eugenia to Clermont Lynmere, she was
put so completely under the care of Dr. Orkborne,
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>
in order to make her fit for the young scholar, that
Miss Margland was of little or no use to her. He
meant, therefore, to bring forward immediately the
marriage of Indiana with young Mandlebert, and
then to ask Miss Margland to go and live with them
entirely, as he could very well spare her: “This,”
he continued, “Indiana can't object to, from the
point of having had her so long; and young Mr.
Edgar's remarkably complaisant, for such a young
youth, which I saw a great while ago. By this
means, Mrs. Margland will get her main end of
going to London, which she may show off to the
young bride, without my budging from home, Lord
help me! being a thing I don't much like, to be
taken about to dances and shews, now that I am not
a boy; so then Camilla will be left to stay with me,
for my own companion; which I assure you I desire
no better, though she knows no more, as the Doctor
tells me, of the classics, than my old spaniel; which,
to give every one his due, is much the same with
myself.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, with a very unpleasant astonishment,
enquired further into his meaning concerning Man∣dlebert;
but his surprise ended in a smile, when he
heard the juvenile circumstances upon which alone
Sir Hugh built his expectations. To argue with
him, however, was always fruitless; he had found
out, he said, the intentions of Edgar from the first,
and he came now to invite him to pass a month at
Cleves, for the sake of cutting the courtship short,
by letting him see Indiana every day, so that no
time might be lost in coming to the conclusion.</P>
<P>The first wish of the secret heart of Mr. Tyrold
was, that one of its own daughters should be the
choice of his ward; he did not, therefore, totally
unmoved, hear this project for Indiana, though its
basis was so little alarming.</P>
<P>Edgar, who was now just of age, was receiving
the last cares of his guardian, and taking into his
own hands his fortune and affairs. He was at Ether∣ington,
at present, only for that purpose, Beech-Park
being already fitted up for his residence.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="64"/>
Sir Hugh, desiring to speak with him, most cor∣dially
made his invitation: “Besides myself,” he
cried, “whom I only mention first, as being master
of the house, which I hope is my excuse for it, you
will meet three very good young girls, not to mention
Dr. Orkborne and Miss Margland, who are rather
not of the youngest at present, whatever they may
have been in former times; and they will all, myself
included, make you as welcome as themselves.”</P>
<P>Edgar accepted the proposal with pleasure, and
agreed to wait upon him the next day, Mr. Tyrold
consenting that they should transact their mutual
business at Etherington, by morning rides.</P>
<P>At dinner Sir Hugh told the family at Cleves the
new guest they were so soon to expect, assuring them
he was become a very fine young gentleman, and
bidding Indiana, with a significant nod, hold up her
head.</P>
<P>Indiana wanted no charge upon this subject; she
fully understood the views of her uncle, and it was
now some years since she had heard the name of
Beech-Park without a smile or a blush.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the young man, Sir Hugh
summoned his household to meet him in the hall,
where he received him with an hearty welcome, and,
in the flutter of his spirits, introduced him to them
all, as if this had been his first appearance in the
family; remarking, that a full week of shyness
might be saved, by making acquaintance with the
whole set in a clump.</P>
<P>From eagerness irrepressible, he began with In∣diana,
apologising when he had done, by saying it
was only because she was oldest, having the advantage
of three weeks over Camilla: “For which, how∣ever,”
he added, “I must beg pardon of Mrs. Marg∣land
and Dr. Orkborne, who, to be sure, must be
pretty much older.”</P>
<P>He next presented him to Camilla; and, then,
taking him apart, begged, in a whisper, that he
would not seem to notice the ugliness of Eugenia,
which, he said, was never mentioned in her hearing,
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
by his particular order; “though, to be sure,” he
added, “since the small-pox, she's grown plain enough,
in point of beauty, considering how pretty she was
before. However, she's a remarkably good girl, and
with regard to Virgil and those others will pose you
in a second, for aught I know to the contrary, being
but an indifferent judge in things of that sort, from
leaving off my own studies rather short, on account
of the gout; besides some other reasons.”</P>
<P>Edgar assured him these introductions were by no
means necessary, a single twelvemouth's absence being
very insufficient to obliterate from his memory his best
and earliest friends.</P>
<P>Edgar Mandlebert was a young man who, if pos∣sessed
neither of fortune nor its expectations, must
from his person and his manners have been as attractive
to the young, as from his morals and his conduct to
those of riper years. His disposition was serious and
meditative; but liberal, open, and candid. He was
observant of the errors of others, and watched
till he nearly eradicated his own. But though with
difficulty he bestowed admiration, he diffused both
in words and deeds, such general amity and good
will, that if the strictness of his character inspired
general respect, its virtues could no less fail engaging
the kinder mode of affection. When to merit of a
species so rare were added a fine estate and a large
independent fortune, it is not easy to decide whether
in prosperity or desert he was most distinguished.</P>
<P>The first week which he spent at Cleves, was passed
with a gaiety as unremitting as it was innocent. All
parties felt his arrival as an acquisition: Indiana
thought the hour of public exhibition, long promised
by Miss Margland, at length fast approaching; Ca∣milla,
who escaped all expectation for herself, from
being informed of what was entertained by her cousin,
enjoyed the tranquil pleasure of undesigning friend∣ship,
unchequered either by hope or fear; Eugenia
met with a respect for her acquirements that re∣doubled
her ambition to increase them; Sir Hugh
looked forward with joy to the happy dis∣posal
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
of Indiana, and a blameless riddance of Miss
Margland; who, on her part, with an almost bound∣less
satisfaction, saw her near return to a town life,
from the high favour in which she stood with the
supposed bride elect; even Dr. Orkborne, though
he disdained with so young a scholar to enter into
much philological disquisition, was gratified by a
presence which afforded a little relief to the stores of
his burthened memory, from authorizing some occa∣sional
utterance of the learned recollections, which
for many years had encumbered it without vent.
Edgar, meanwhile, obliging and obliged, received
pleasure from, them all; for though not blind to any
of their imperfections, they had not a merit which
he failed to discern.</P>
<P>The second week opened with a plan which pro∣mised
a scene more lively, though it broke it into the
calm retirement of this peaceful party. Lionel, who
was now at Etherington, to spend his university va∣cation,
rode over to Cleves, to inform Edgar, that
there would be a ball the next evening at Northwick,
at which the officers of the *** regiment, which
was quartered in the neighbourhood, and all the
beaux and belles of the county, were expected to as∣semble.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, who was present, struck with
a desire that Indiana might make her first public ap∣pearance
in the county, at a ball where Edgar might
be her partner, went instantly to Sir Hugh to impart
the idea. Sir Hugh, though averse to all public
places, consented to the plan, from the hope of ac∣celerating
the affair; but declared, that if there was
any amusement, his little Camilla should not be left out.
Eugenia, won by the novelty of a first expedition of
this sort, made her own request to be included;
Lionel undertook to procure tickets, and Miss Mar∣gland
had the welcome labour of arranging their
dress, for which Sir Hugh, to atone for the shortness
of the time, gave her powers unlimited.</P>
<P>Indiana was almost distracted with joy at this event.
Miss Margland assured her, that now was the mo∣ment
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
for fixing her conquest of Mandlebert, by
adroitly displaying to him the admiration she could
not but excite, in the numerous strangers before
whom she would appear; she gave her various in∣structions
how to set off her person to most advan∣tage,
and she delighted Sir Hugh with assurances of
what this evening would effect: “There is nothing,
Sir,” said she, “so conducive towards a right un∣derstanding
between persons of fashion, as a ball. A
gentleman may spend months and months in this
drowsy way in the country, and always think one day
will do as well as another for his declaration; but
when he sees a young lady admired and noticed by
others, he falls naturally into making her the same
compliments, and the affair goes into a regular train,
without his almost thinking of it.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh listened to this doctrine with every de∣sire
to give it credit; and though the occupations of
the toilette left him alone the whole of the assembly
day, he was as happy in the prospect of their diver∣sion,
as they were themselves in its preparation.</P>
<P>When the young ladies were ready, they repaired
to the apartment of the baronet, to shew themselves,
and to take leave. Edgar and Lionel were waiting
to meet them upon the stairs. Indiana had never
yet looked so lovely; Camilla, with all her attrac∣tions,
was eclipsed; and Eugenia could only have
served as a foil, even to those who had no pretensions
to beauty.</P>
<P>Edgar, nevertheless, asked Camilla to dance with
him; she willingly, though not without wonder, con∣sented.
Lionel desired the hand of his fair cousin;
but Indiana, self-destined to Edgar, whose address
to Camilla, she had not heard, made him no answer,
and ran on to present herself to her uncle; who,
struck with admiration as he beheld her, cried “In∣diana,
my dear, you really look prettier than I could
even have guessed; and yet I always knew there was
no fault to be found with the outside; nor indeed
with the inside neither, Mr. Mandlebert, so I don't
mean any thing by that; only, by use, one is apt to
put the outside first.”</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68"/>
Lionel was now hurrying them away, when Sir
Hugh calling to Edgar, said: “Pray, young Mr.
Mandlebert, take as much care of her as possible;
which I am sure you will do of your own accord.”</P>
<P>Edgar, with some surprise, answered, he should
be happy to take whatever care was in his power of
all the ladies; “but,” added he, “for my own par∣ticular
charge to-night, I have engaged Miss Ca∣milla.”</P>
<P>“And how came you to do that? Don't you
know I let them all go on purpose for the sake of
your dancing with Indiana, which I mean as a par∣ticular
favour?”</P>
<P>“Sir,” replied Edgar, a little embarrassed, “you
are very good; but as Lionel cannot dance with his
sisters, he has engaged Miss Lynmere himself.”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho, what do you mind Lionel for? not
but what he's a very good lad; only I had rather
have you and Indiana dance together, which I dare
say so had she.”</P>
<P>Edgar, somewhat distressed, looked at Camilla:
“O, as to me,” cried she, gaily, “pray let me take
my chance; if I should not dance at all, the whole
will be so new to me, that I am sure of entertain∣ment.”</P>
<P>“You are the best good girl, without the smallest
exception,” said Sir Hugh, “that ever I have known
in the world; and so you always were; by which I
mean nothing as to Indiana, who is just such another,
except in some points; and so here's her hand, young
Mr. Mandlebert, and if you think you shall meet a
prettier partner at the ball, I beg when you get her
there, you will tell her so fairly, and give her up.”</P>
<P>Edgar, who had hardly yet looked at her, was
now himself struck with the unusual resplendence of
her beauty, and telling Camilla he saw she was glad
to be at liberty, protested he could not but rejoice
to be spared a decision for himself, where the choice
would have been so difficult.</P>
<P>“Well then, now go,” cried the delighted ba∣ronet;
“Lionel will find himself a partner, I have
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
no doubt, because he is nothing particular in point
of shyness; and as to Camilla, she'll want nothing
but to hear the fiddlers to be as merry as a grig,
which what it is I never knew: so I have no con∣cern,”
added he, in a low voice, to Edgar, “except
for little Eugenia, and poor Mrs. Margland; for
Eugenia being so plain, which is no fault of her's,
on account of the small-pox, many a person may
overlook her from that objection; and as to Mrs.
Margland, being with all these young chickens, I
am afraid people will think her rather one of the
oldest for a dancing match; which I say in no dis∣respect,
for oldness gives one no choice.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">New Characters.</HEAD>
<P>THE dancing was not yet begun, but the com∣pany
was met, and the sprightly violins were em∣ployed
to quicken their motions, when the Cleves
party entered the ball room. They were distin∣guished
immediately by a large party of officers, who
assured Lionel, with whom they were acquainted,
that they had impatiently been expected.</P>
<P>“I shall recompense you for waiting,” answered
he, in a whisper, “by introducing you to the rich
heiress of Cleves, who now makes her first appear∣ance
from the nursery; though no! upon farther
thoughts, I will only tell you she is one of our set,
and leave it to your own ingenuity to find her out.”</P>
<P>While this was passing, Indiana, fluttering with
all the secret triumph of conscious beauty, attended
by Edgar, and guarded by Miss Margland, walked
up the room, through a crowd of admiring spec∣tators;
in whom a new figure, without half her
loveliness, would have excited the same curiosity, that
her extreme inexperience attributed solely to her pe∣culiar
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
charms. Camilla and Eugenia followed rather
as if in her train, than of her party; but Lionel
kept entirely with the officers, insisting upon their
guessing which was the heiress; to whom, while he
purposely misled their conjectures, he urged them
to make their court, by enumerating the present
possessions of Sir Hugh, and her future expectations.</P>
<P>Camilla, however, passed not long unnoticed,
though the splendor of Indiana's appearance cast her
at first on the back ground; a circumstance which,
by impressing her with a sensation of inferiority, di∣vested
her mind of all personal considerations, and
gave to her air and countenance a graceful simplicity,
a disengaged openness, and a guileless freedom from
affectation, that rendered her, to the observant eye,
as captivating upon examination, as Indiana, from
the first glance, was brilliant and alluring. And
thus, as they patroled the room, Indiana excited an
unmixt admiration, Camilla awakened an endless va∣riety
of remark; while each being seen for the first
time, and every one else of the company for at least
the second, all attention was their own, whether for
criticism or for praise. To Indiana this answered, in
fulfilling her expectations; by Camilla, it was un∣heeded,
for, not awaiting, she did not perceive it;
yet both felt equal satisfaction. The eyes of Ca∣milla
sparkled with delight as she surveyed all around
her the gay novelty of the scene; the heart of In∣diana
beat with a pleasure wholly new, as she dis∣covered
that all surrounding her regarded her as the
principal object.</P>
<P>Eugenia, meanwhile, had not even the negative
felicity to pass unobserved; impertinent witticisms
upon her face, person and walk, though not uttered
so audibly as to be distinctly heard, ran round the
room in a confused murmur, and produced a dis∣position
for sneering in the satirical, and for tittering
in the giddy, that made her as valuable an acquisition
to the company at large, who collect for any amuse∣ment,
indifferent to its nature, as her fair cousin
proved to the admirers of beauty, and her sister to
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
the developers of expression. She was shielded, how∣ever,
herself, from all undeserved mortifications, by
not suspecting any were meant for her▪ and by a
mind delightedly pre-occupied with that sudden ex∣pansion
of ideas, with which new scenery and new
objects charm a youthful imagination.</P>
<P>When they had taken two or three turns up and
down the room, the saunterers were called upon to
give place to the dancers. Edgar then led out In∣diana,
and the master of the ceremonies brought
Major Cerwood to Camilla.</P>
<P>Eugenia, wholly left out, became the exclusive
charge of Miss Margland; she felt no resentment of
neglect, for she had formed no species of expectation.
She looked on with perfect contentment, and the
motley and quick changing group afforded her ample
entertainment.</P>
<P>Miss Margland was not so passive; she seized the
opportunity of inveighing very angrily against the
mismanagement of Sir Hugh: “If you had all,”
she cried, “been taken to town, and properly brought
out, according to my advice, such a disgrace as this
could never have happened; every body would have
known who you were, and then, thore is no doubt,
you might have had partners enough; however, I
heartily hope you won't be asked to dance all the
evening, that he may be convinced who was in the
right; besides, the more you are tired, the more you
may see, against another time, Miss Eugenia, that it
is better to listen a little to people's opinions, when
they speak only for your own advantage, than to go
on with just the same indifference, as if you had no
proper person to consult with.”</P>
<P>Eugenia was too well amused to heed this remon∣strance;
and long accustomed to hear the voice of
Miss Margland without profit or pleasure, her ear
received its sound, but her attention included not its
purpose.</P>
<P>Indiana and Camilla, in this public essay, ac∣quitted
themselves with all the merits, and all the
faults common to a first exhibition. The spectators
upon such occasions, though never equally observant,
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
are never afterwards so lenient. Whatever fails is
attributed to modesty, more winning than the ut∣most
success of excellence. Timidity solicits that
mercy which pride is most gratified to grant; the
blushes of juvenile shame atone for the deficiencies
which cause them; and aukwardness itself, in the
unfounded terrors of youth, is perhaps more interest∣ing
than grace.</P>
<P>Indiana could with difficulty keep to the figure of
the dance, from the exulting, yet unpractised cer∣tainty
of attracting all eyes; and Camilla perpetually
turned wrong, from the mere flutter of fear, which
made her expect she should never turn right. Major
Cerwood, her partner, with a view to encourage her,
was profuse in his compliments; but, as new to what
she heard as what she performed, she was only the
more confused by the double claim to her attention.</P>
<P>Edgar, meanwhile, was most assiduous to aid his
fair partner. Miss Margland, though scarcely even
superficial in general knowledge, was conversant in
the practical detail of the hackneyed mode of form∣ing
matrimonial engagements; she judged, therefore,
rightly, that her pupil would be seen to most advan∣tage,
in the distinction of that adulation by which
new beholders would stamp new value on her charms.
From the time of his first boyish gallantry, on the
ill-fated birth-day of Camilla, Indiana had never so
much struck young Mandlebert, as while he attended
her up the assembly-room. Miss Margland observed
this with triumph, and prophesied the speediest con∣clusion
to her long and weary sojourn at Cleves, in
the much wished for journey to London, with a bride
ready made, and an establishment ready formed.</P>
<P>When then two first dances were over, the gentle∣men
were desired to change partners. Major Cer∣wood
asked the hand of Indiana, and Edgar repaired
to Camilla: “Do you bear malice?” he cried, with
a smile, or may I now make the claim that Sir
Hugh relinquished for me?”</P>
<P>“O yes,” answered she, with alacrity, when in∣formed
of the plan of change; “and I wish there
<PB N="73" REF="73"/>
was any body else, that would dance with me after∣wards,
instead of that Major.”</P>
<P>“I dare believe,” said he, laughing, “there are
many bodies else, who would oblige you, if your de∣claration
were heard. But what has the Major done
to you? Has he admired you without knowing how
to keep his own counsel?”</P>
<P>“No, no; only he has treated me like a country
simpleton, and made me as many fine speeches, as
if he had been talking to Indiana.”</P>
<P>“You think, then, Indiana would have swallowed
flattery with less difficulty?”</P>
<P>“No, indeed! but I think the same things said
to her would no longer have been so extravagant.”</P>
<P>Edgar, to whom the sun-beams of the mind gave
a glow which not all the sparkling rays of the brightest
eyes could emit, respected her modesty too highly to
combat it, and dropping the subject, enquired what
was become of Eugenia.</P>
<P>“O poor Eugenia!” cried she, “I see nothing
of her, and I am very much afraid she has had no
better partner all this time than Miss Margland.”</P>
<P>Edgar, turning round, presently discerned her;
she was still looking on, with an air of the most per∣fect
composure, examining the various parties, to∣tally
without suspicion of the examination she was
herself sustaining: while Miss Margland was vainly
pouring in her ears observations, or exhortations,
evidently of a complaining nature.</P>
<P>“There is something truly respectable,” said Ed∣gar,
“in the innate philosophy with which she bears
such neglect”</P>
<P>“Yet I wish it were put less to the proof;” said
Camilla. “I would give the world somebody would
take her out!”</P>
<P>“You don't think she would dance?”</P>
<P>“O yes, she would! her lameness is no impedi∣ment;
for she never thinks of it. We all learnt to∣gether
at Cleves. Dancing gives her a little more
exertion, and therefore a little more fatigue than
other people, but that is all.”</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="74"/>
“After these two dances then—”</P>
<P>“Will you be her partner?” interrupted Ca∣milla,
“O go to her at once! immediately! and
you will give me twenty times more pleasure than I
can have in dancing myself.”</P>
<P>She then flew to a form, and eagerly seated herself
where she perceived the first vacancy, to stop any
debate, and enforce his consent.</P>
<P>The dance, which had been delayed by a dispute
about the tune, was now beginning. Edgar, looking
after her with affected reproach, but real admiration,
asked the hand of Eugenia; who gave it with readi∣ness
and pleasure; for, though contented as a spec∣tatress,
she experienced an agreeable surprise in be∣coming
a party engaged.</P>
<P>Camilla, happy in her own good humour, now
looked at her neighbours; one of which was an el∣derly
lady, who, wholly employed in examining and
admiring the performance of her own danghters, saw
nothing else in the room. The other was a gentle∣man,
much distinguished by his figure and appear∣ance,
and dressed so completely in the extreme of
fashion, as more than to border upon foppery. The
case and negligence of his air denoted a self-settled
superiority to all about him; yet, from time to time,
there was an archness in the glance of his eye, that
promised, under a deep and wilful veil of conceit and
affectation, a secret disposition to deride the very
follies he was practising. He was now lounging
against the wainscot; with one hand on his side,
and the other upon his eye-lids, occupying the space,
without using the seat, to the left of Camilla.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, perceiving what she regarded as
a fair vacancy, made up to the spot, and saying,
“Sir, by your leave,” was preparing to take pos∣session
of the place, when the gentleman, as if with∣out
seeing her, dropt suddenly into it himself, and,
pouring a profusion of <HI>eau suave</HI> upon his handker∣chief,
exclaimed: “What a vastly bad room this is
for dancing!”</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="75"/>
Camilla, concluding herself addressed, turned
round to him; but, seeing he was sniffing up the
<HI>eau sauve,</HI> without looking at her, imagined he meant
to speak to Miss Margland.</P>
<P>Miss Margland was of the same opinion, and, with
some pique at his seizing thus her intended seat, ra∣ther
sharply answered: “Yes, Sir, and it's a vast
bad room for <HI>not</HI> dancing; for if every body would
dance that ought, there would be accommodation
sufficient for other people.”</P>
<P>“Incomparably well observed!” cried he, col∣lecting
some bonbons from a bonboniere, and swal∣lowing
one after another with great rapidity: “But
won't you sit down? You must be enormously tired.
Let me supplicate you to sit down.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland, supposing he meant to make
amends for his inattention, by delivering up the
place, civilly thanked him, and said she should not
be sorry, for she had stood a good while.</P>
<P>“Have you, indeed?” cried he, sprinkling some
jessamine drops upon his hands; “how horribly abo∣minable?
Why don't some of those Mercuries, those
Ganymedes, those waiters, I believe you call them,
get you a chair?”</P>
<P>Miss Margland, excessively affronted, turned her
back to him; and Camilla made an offer of her own
seat; but, as she had been dancing, and would pro∣bably
dance again, Miss Margland would not let her
rise.</P>
<P>“Shall I call to one of those Barbarians, those
Goths, those Vandals?” cried the same gentleman,
who now was spirting lavender water all about him,
with grimaces that proclaimed forcibly his opinion of
the want of perfume in the room: “Do pray let
me harangue them a little for you upon their inor∣dinate
want of sensibility.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland deigned not any answer; but of
that he took no notice, and presently called out,
though without raising his voice, “Here, Mr.
Waiter! Purveyor, Surveyor, or whatsoever other
title `<HI>please thine car,</HI>' art thou deaf? why dost not
<PB N="76" REF="76"/>
bring this lady a chair? Those people are most
amazing hard of hearing! Shall I call again? Waiter,
I say!” still speaking rather lower than louder;
“Don't I stun you by this shocking vociferation?”</P>
<P>“Sir, you're vastly—obliging!” cried Miss Mar∣gland,
unable longer to hold silence, yet with a look
and manner that would much better have accorded
with vastly—<HI>impertinent.</HI></P>
<P>She then pursued a waiter herself, and procured a
thair.</P>
<P>Casting his eyes next upon Camilla, he examined
her with much attention. Abashed, she turned away
her head: but not choosing to lose his object, he
called it back again, by samiliarly saying, “How
is Sir Hugh?”</P>
<P>A good deal surprised, she exclaimed, “Do you
know my uncle, Sir?”</P>
<P>“Not in the least, ma'am,” he coolly answered.</P>
<P>Camilla, much wondering, was then sorced into
conversation with Miss Margland: but, without
paying any regard to her surprise, he presently said,
“It's most extremely worth your while to take a
glance at that inimitably good figure. Is it not ex∣quisite?”
Can you suppose any thing beyond it?”</P>
<P>Camilla, looking at the person to whom he pointed,
and who was sufficiently ludicrous, from an air of
vulgar solemnity, and a dress stiffly new, though
completely old-fashioned, felt disposed to join in his
laugh, had she not been disconcerted by the mingled
liberty and oddity of his attack.</P>
<P>“Sir,” said Miss Margland, winking at her to
be silent, though eager to answer in her stead, “the
mixt company one always meets at these public balls,
makes them very unfit for ladies of fashion, for there's
no knowing who one may either dance with or speak
to.”</P>
<P>“Vastly true, ma'am,” cried he, superciliously
dropping his eyes, not to look at her.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, perceiving this, bridled resent∣fully,
and again talked on with Camilla; till another
exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation interrupted them. “O pray,” cried
<PB N="77" REF="77"/>
he, “I do intreat you look at that group! Is it not
past compare? If ever you held a pencil in your life,
I beg and beseech you to take a memorandum of
that tall may-pole. Have you ever seen any thing so
excessively delectable?”</P>
<P>Camilla could not forbear smiling; but Miss
Margland, taking all reply upon herself, said:
“Cari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures, Sir, are by no means pleasing for young
ladies to be taking, at their first coming out: one
does not know who may be next, if once they get
into that habit!”</P>
<P>“Immeasurably well spoken, ma'am,” returned he;
and, rising with a look of disgust, he sauntered to
another part of the room.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, extremely provoked, said she was
sure he was some Irish fortune hunter, dressed out in
all he was worth; and charged Camilla to take no
manner of notice of him.</P>
<P>When the two second dances were over, Edgar,
conducting Eugenia to Miss Margland, said to Ca∣milla:
“Now, at least, if there is not a spell against
it, will you dance with me?”</P>
<P>“And if there is one, too,” cried she, gaily▪
“for I am perfectly disposed to help breaking it.”</P>
<P>She rose, and they were again going to take their
places, when Miss Margland, reproachfully calling
after Edgar, demanded what he had done with Miss
Lynmere?</P>
<P>At the same moment, led by Major Cerwood, who
was paying her in full all the arrears of that gallantry
Miss Margland had taught her to regret hitherto
missing, Indiana joined them; the Major, in making
his bow, lamenting the rules of the assembly, that
compelled him to relinquish her hand.</P>
<P>“Mr. Mandlebert,” said Miss Margland, “you
see Miss Lynmere is again disengaged.”</P>
<P>“Yes, ma'am,” answered Edgar, drawing Ca∣milla
away; “and every gentleman in the room will
be happy to see it too.”</P>
<P>“Stop, Miss Camilla!” cried Miss Margland;
“I thought, Mr. Mandlebert, Sir Hugh had put
Miss Lynmere under your protection?”</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="78"/>
“O it does not signify!” said Indiana, colouring
high with a new raised sense of importance; “I don't
at all doubt but one or other of the officers will take
care of me.”</P>
<P>Edgar, though somewhat disconcerted, would still
have proceeded; but Camilla, alarmed by the frowns
of Miss Margland, begged him to lead out her coufin,
and, promising to be in readiness for the next two
dances, glided back to her seat. He upbraided her
in vain; Miss Margland looked pleased, and Indiana
was so much p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qued, that he found it necessary to di∣rect
all his attention to appeasing her, as he led her
to join the dance.</P>
<P>A gentleman now, eminently distinguished by per∣sonal
beauty▪ approached the ladies that remained,
and, in the most respectful manner, began conversing
with Miss Margland; who received his attentions so
gratefully, that, when he told her he only waited to
see the master of the ceremonies at leisure, in order
to have the honour of begging the hand of one of
her young ladies, his civilities so conquered all her
pride of etiquette, that she assured him there was no
sort of occasion for such a formality, with a person
of his appearance and manners; and was bidding
Camilla rise, who was innocently preparing to obey▪
when, to the surprise of them all, he addressed him∣self
to Eugenia.</P>
<P>“There!” cried Miss Margland, exultingly, when
they were gone; “that gentleman is completely a
gentleman. I saw it from the beginning. How dif∣ferent
that impertinent fop that spoke to us just now!
He has the politeness to take out Miss Eugenia, be∣cause
he sees plainly nobody else will think of it, ex∣cept
just Mr. Mandlebert, or some such old acquaint∣ance.”</P>
<P>Major Cerwood was now advancing towards Ca∣milla,
with that species of smiling and bowing man∣ner,
which is the usual precursor of an invitation to
a fair partner; when the gentleman whom Miss
Margland had just called an impertinent fop, with a
sudden swing, not to be eluded, cast himself between
<PB N="79" REF="79"/>
the Major and Camilla, as if he had not observed his
approach; and spoke to her in a voice so low, that,
though she concluded he asked her to dance, she
could not distinctly hear a word he said.</P>
<P>A good deal confused, she looked at him for an
explanation; while the Major, from her air of at∣tention,
supposing himself too late, retreated.</P>
<P>Her new beau then, carelessly seating himself by
her side, indolently said: “What a heat! I have not
the most distant idea how you can bear it!”</P>
<P>Camilla found it impossible to keep her counte∣nance
at such a result of a whisper, though she com∣plied
with the injunctions of Miss Margland, in
avoiding mutual discourse with a stranger of so showy
an appearance.</P>
<P>“Yet they are dancing on,” he continued, “just
as if the Greenland snows were inviting their exer∣cise!
I should really like to find out what those
people are made of. Can you possibly imagine their
composition?”</P>
<P>Heedless of receiving no answer, he soon after
added: “I am vastly glad you don't like dancing.”</P>
<P>“Me?” cried Camilla, surprised out of her
caution.</P>
<P>“Yes; you hold it in antipathy, don't you?”</P>
<P>“No, indeed! far from it.”</P>
<P>“Don't you really?” cried he, starting back;
“that's amazingly extraordinary! surprising in the
extreme! Will you have the goodness to tell me
what you like in it?”</P>
<P>“Sir,” interfered Miss Margland, “there's no∣thing
but what's very natural in a young lady's tak∣ing
pleasure in an elegant accomplishment; provided
she is secure from any improper partner, or com∣pany.”</P>
<P>“Irrefragably just, ma'am!” answered he; af∣fecting
to take a pinch of snuff, and turning his
head another way.</P>
<P>Here Lionel, hastily running up to Camilla, whis∣pered,
“I have made a sine confusion among the
red-coats about the heiress of Cleves! I have put
them all upon different scents.”</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="80"/>
He was then going back, when a faint laugh from
the neighbour of Camilla detained him; “Look, I
adjure you,” cried he, addressing her, “if there's
not that delightful creature again, with his bran-new
clothes? and they sit upon him so tight, he can't
turn round his vastly droll figure, except like a puppet
with one jerk for the whole body. He is really an
immense treat: I should like, of all things in nature,
to know who he can be.”</P>
<P>A waiter then passing with a glass of water for a
lady, he stopped him in his way, exclaiming: “Pray,
my extremely good friend, can you tell me who that
agreeable person is, that stands there, with the air
of a poker?”</P>
<P>“Yes, Sir,” answered the man; “I know him
very well. His name is Dubster. He's quite a
gentleman to my knowledge, and has very good for∣tunes.”</P>
<P>“Camilla,” cried Lionel, “will you have him for
a partner?” And, immediately hastening up to him,
he said two or three words in a low voice, and skipped
back to the dance.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster then walked up to her, and, with an
air conspicuously aukward, solemnly said, “So you
want to dance, ma'am?”</P>
<P>Convinced he had been sent to her by Lionel, but
by no means chusing to display herself with a figure
distinguished only as a mark for ridicule; she looked
down to conceal her ever-ready smiles, and said she
had been dancing some time.</P>
<P>“But if you like to dance again, ma'am,” said
he, “I am very ready to oblige you.”</P>
<P>She now saw that this offer had been requested as
a favour; and, while half provoked, half diverted,
grew embarrassed how to get rid of him, without in∣volving
a necessity to refuse afterwards Edgar, and
every other; for Miss Margland had informed her of
the general rules upon these occasions. She looked,
therefore, at that lady for counsel; while her neigh∣bour,
sticking his hands in his sides, surveyed him
from head to foot, with an expression of such un∣disguised
<PB N="81" REF="81"/>
amusement, that Mr. Dubster, who could
not help observing it, cast towards him, from time
to time, a look of the most angry surprise.</P>
<P>Miss Margland approving, as well understanding
the appeal, now authoritatively interfered, saying:
“Sir, I suppose you know the etiquette in public
places?”</P>
<P>“The what, ma'am?” cried he, staring.</P>
<P>“You know, I suppose, Sir, that no young lady
of any consideration dances with a gentleman that is
a stranger to her, without he's brought to her by the
master of the ceremonies?”</P>
<P>“O as to that, ma'am, I have no objection. I'll
go see for him, if you've a mind. It makes no dif∣ference
to me.”</P>
<P>And away he went.</P>
<P>“So you really intend dancing with him?” cried
Camilla's neighbour. “'Twill be a vastly good sight.
I have not the most remo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e conception how he will
bear the pulling and jostling about. Bend he cannot;
but I am immensely afraid he will break. I would
give fifty guineas for his portrait. He is indubitably
put together without joints.”</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster now returned, and, with a look of
some disturbance, said to Miss Margland: “Ma'am,
I don't know which is the master of the ceremonies.
I can't find him out; for I don't know as ever I see
him.”</P>
<P>“O pray,” cried Camilla eagerly, “do not take
the trouble of looking for him; 'twill answer no
purpose.”</P>
<P>“Why I think so too, ma'am,” said he, misun∣derstanding
her; “for as I don't know the gentle∣man
myself, he could go no great way towards mak∣ing
us better acquainted with one another: so we
may just as well take our skip at once.”</P>
<P>Camilla now looked extremely foolish; and Miss
Margland was again preparing an obstacle, when
Mr. Dubster started one himself. “The worst is,”
cried he, “I have lost one of my gloves, and I am
sure I had two when I came. I suppose I may
<PB N="82" REF="82"/>
have dropt it in the other room. If you shan't
mind it, I'll dance without it; for I don't mind
those things myself of a straw.”</P>
<P>“O! Sir,” cried Miss Margland, “that's such a
thing as never was heard of. I can't possibly consent
to let Miss Camilla dance in such a manner as that.”</P>
<P>“Why then, if you like it better, ma'am, I'll
go back and look for it.”</P>
<P>Again Camilla would have declined giving him
any trouble; but he seemed persuaded it was only
from shyness, and would not listen. “Though the
worst is,” he said, “you're losing so much time.
However, I'll give a good hunt; unless, indeed, that
gentleman, who is doing nothing himself, except
looking on at us all, would be kind enough to lend
me his.”</P>
<P>“I rather fancy, Sir,” cried the gentleman, im∣mediately
recovering from a laughing fit, and sur∣veying
the requester with supercilious contempt; “I
rather suspect they would not perfectly fit you.”</P>
<P>“Why then,” cried he, “I think I'll go and
ask Tom Hicks to lend me a pair; for it's a pity to
let the young lady lose her dance for such a small
trifle as that.”</P>
<P>Camilla began remonstrating; but he tranquilly
walked away.</P>
<P>“You are superlatively in the good graces of for∣tune
to-night,” cried her new friend, “superlatively
to a degree: you may not meet with such an inva∣luably
uncommon object in twenty lustres.”</P>
<P>“Certainly,” said Miss Margland, “there's a
great want of regulation at balls, to prevent low
people from asl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing who they will to dance with them.
It's bad enough one can't keep people one knows
nothing of from speaking to one.”</P>
<P>“Admirably hit off! admirable in the extreme!”
he answered; suddenly twisting himself round, and
beginning a whispering conversation with a gentle∣man
on his other side.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster soon came again, saying, somewhat
dolorously, “I have looked high and low for my
<PB N="83" REF="83"/>
glove, but I am no nearer. I dare say somebody
has picked it up, out of a joke, and put it in their
pocket. And as to Tom Hicks, where he can be
hid, I can't tell, unless he has hanged himself; for
I can't find him no more than my glove. However
I've got a boy to go and get me a pair; if all the
shops a'n't shut up.”</P>
<P>Camilla, fearing to be involved in a necessity of
dancing with him, expressed herself very sorry for
this step; but, again misconceiving her motive, he
begged her not to mind it; saying, “A pair of
gloves here or there is no great matter. All I am
concerned for is, putting you off so long from hav∣ing
a little pleasure, for I dare say the boy won't
come till the next two batches; so if that gentleman
that looks so particular at me has a mind to jig it
with you a bit himself, in the interim, I won't be
his hindrance.”</P>
<P>Receiving no answer, he bent his head lower down,
and said, in a louder voice, “Pray, Sir, did you
hear me?”</P>
<P>“Sir, you are ineffably good!” was the reply;
without a look, or any further notice.</P>
<P>Much affronted, he said no more, but stood pout∣ing
and stiff before Camilla, till the second dance
was over, and another general separation of partners
took place. “I thought how it would be, ma'am,”
he then cried; “for I know it's no such easy matter
to find shops open at this time of night; for if peo∣ple's
'prentices can't take a little pleasure by now,
they can't never.”</P>
<P>Tea being at this time ordered, the whole party
collected to remove to the next room. Lionel, see∣ing
Mr. Dubster standing by Camilla, with a rap∣turous
laugh, cried, “Well, sister, have you been
dancing?”</P>
<P>Camilla, though laughing too, reproachfully shook
her head at him; while Mr. Dubster gravely said,
“It's no fault of mine, Sir, that the lady's a sitting
still; for I come and offered myself to her the mo∣ment
you told me she wanted a partner; but I hap∣pened
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
of the misfortune of losing one of my gloves,
and not being able to find Tom Hicks, I've been
waiting all this while for a boy as has promised to get
me a pair; though, I suppose he's fell down in the
dark and broke his skull, by his not coming. And,
indeed, if that elderly lady had not been so particu∣lar,
I might as well have done without; for, if I
had one on, nobody would have been the wiser but
that t'other might have been in my pocket.”</P>
<P>This speech, spoken without any ceremony in the
hearing of Miss Margland, to the visible and undis∣guised
delight of Lionel, so much enraged her, that,
hastily calling him aside, she peremptorily demanded
how he came to bring such a vulgar partner to his
sister?</P>
<P>“Because you took no care to get her a better,”
he answered, heedlessly.</P>
<P>Camilla also began to remonstrate; but, without
hearing her, he courteously addressed himself to Mr.
Dubster, and told him he was sure Miss Margland
and his sister would expect the pleasure of his com∣pany
to join their party at tea.</P>
<P>Miss Margland frowned in vain; Mr. Dubster
bowed, as at a compliment but his due; observing
he should then be close at hand for his partner; and
they were proceeding to the tea-room, when the
finer new acquaintance of Camilla called after Mr.
Dubster: “Pray, my good Sir, who may this
Signor Thomaso be, that has the honour to stand so
high in your good graces?”</P>
<P>“Mine, Sir?” cried Mr. Dubster; “I know no
Signor Thomaso, nor Signor nothing else neither:
so I don't know what you mean.”</P>
<P>“Did not I hear you dilating, my very good Sir,
upon a certain Mr. Tom somebody?”</P>
<P>“What, I suppose then, Sir, if the truth be
known, you would say Tom Hicks?”</P>
<P>“very probably, Sir; though I am not of the
first accuracy as the gentleman's nomenclator.”</P>
<P>“What? don't you know him, Sir? why he's
the head waiter!”</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="85"/>
Then, following the rest of the party, he was
placed, by the assistance of Lionel, next to Camilla,
in utter defiance of all the angry glances of Miss
Margland, who herself invited the handsome partner
of Eugenia to join their group, and reaped some
consolation in his willing civilities; till the attention
of the whole assembly was called, or rather com∣manded
by a new object.</P>
<P>A lady, not young, but still handsome, with an
air of fashion easy almost to insolence, in a complete
but becoming undress, with a work-bag hanging on
her arm, whence she was carelessly knotting, en∣tered
the ball-room alone, and, walking straight
through it to the large folding glass doors of the
tea-room, there stopt, and took a general survey of
the company, with a look that announced a decided
superiority to all she saw, and a perfect indifference
to what opinion she incurred in return.</P>
<P>She was immediately joined by all the officers,
and several other gentlemen, whose eagerness to shew
themselves of her acquaintance marked her for a
woman of some consequence; though she took little
other notice of them, than that of giving to each
some frivolous commission; telling one to hold her
work-bag; bidding another fetch her a chair; a
third, ask for a glass of water; and a fourth, take
care of her cloak. She then planted herself just
without the folding-doors, declaring there could be
no breathing in the smaller apartment, and sent about
the gentlemen for various refreshments; all which
she rejected when they arrived, with extreme contempt,
and a thousand fantastic grimaces.</P>
<P>The tea-table at which Miss Margland presided
being nearest to these folding doors, she and her party
heard, from time to time, most of what was said,
especially by the newly arrived lady; who, though
she now and then spoke for several minutes in a
laughing whisper, to some one she called to her side,
uttered most of her remarks, and all her commands
quite aloud, with that sort of deliberate ease which
belongs to the most determined negligence of who
<PB N="86" REF="86"/>
heard, or who escaped hearing her, who were pleased
or who were offended.</P>
<P>Camilla and Eugenia were soon wholly engrossed
by this new personage; and Lionel, seeing her sur∣rounded
by the most fashionable men of the assembly,
forgot Mr. Dubster and his gloves, in an eagerness
to be introduced to her.</P>
<P>Colonel Andover, to whom he applied, willingly
gratified him: “Give me leave, Mrs. Arlbery,”
cried he, to the lady, who was then conversing with
General Kinsale, “to present to you Mr. Tyrold.”</P>
<P>“For Heaven's sake, don't speak to me just now,”
cried she; “the General is telling me the most in∣teresting
thing in the world. Go on, dear General!”</P>
<P>Lionel, who, if guided by his own natural judg∣ment,
would have conceived this to be the height of
ill-breeding or of ignorance, no sooner saw Colonel
Andover bow in smiling submission to her orders,
than he concluded himself all in the dark with respect
to the last licences of fashion: and, while content∣edly
he waited her leisure for his reception, he ran
over in his own mind the triumph with which he
should carry to Oxford the newest flourish of the
<HI>bon ten.</HI></P>
<P>In a few minutes, after gaily laughing with the
General, she turned suddenly to Colonel Andover,
and, striking him on the arm with her fan, ex∣claimed:
“Well, now, Colonel, what is it you
would say?”</P>
<P>“Mr. Tyrold,” he answered, “is very ambitious
of the honour of being introduced to you.”</P>
<P>“With all my heart. Which is he?” And then,
nodding to Lionel's bow, “You live, I think,” she
added, “in this neighbourhood? By the way, Co∣lonel,
how came you never to bring Mr. Tyrold to
me before? Mr. Tyrold, I flatter myself you intend
to take this very ill.”</P>
<P>Lionel was beginning to express his sense of the
loss he had suffered by the delay, when, again,
patting the Colonel, “Only look, I beg you,” she
cried, “at that insupportable Sir Sedley Clarendel!
<PB N="87" REF="87"/>
how he sits at his ease there! amusing his ridiculous
fancy with every creature he sees. Yet what an ele∣gant
posture the animal has found out! I make no
doubt he would as soon forfeit his estate as give up
that attitude. I must make him come to me imme∣diately
for that very reason;—do go to him, good
Andover, and say I want him directly.”</P>
<P>The Colonel obeyed; but not so the gentleman he
addressed, who was the new acquaintance of Camilla.
He only bowed to the message, and, kissing his hand
across the room to the lady, desired the Colonel to
tell her he was ines<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably tired; but would incontest∣ably
have the honour to throw himself at her feet the
next morning.</P>
<P>“O, intolerable!” cried she, “he grows more
conceited every hour. Yet what an agreeable wretch
it is! There's nothing like him. I cannot possibly
do without him. Andover, tell him if he does not
come this moment he kills me.”</P>
<P>“And is that a message,” said General Kinsale,
“to cure him of being conceited?”</P>
<P>“O, Heaven forbid, my good General, I should
cure him! That would utterly spoil him. His con∣ceit
is precisely what enchants me. Rob him of
that, and you lose all hold of him.”</P>
<P>“Is it then necessary to keep him a fop, in order
to retain him in your chains?”</P>
<P>“O, he is not in my chains, I promise you. A
sop, my dear General, wears no chains but his own.
However, I like to have him, because he is so hard
to be got; and I am fond of conversing with him,
because he is so ridiculous. Fetch him, therefore,
Colonel, without delay.”</P>
<P>This second embassy prevailed; he shrugged his
shoulders, but arose to follow the Colonel.</P>
<P>“See, madam, your victory!” said the General.
“What would not a military man give for such talents
of command?”</P>
<P>“Ay, but look with what magnificent tardiness
he obeys orders! There is something quite irresistible
in his impertinence; 'tis so conscious and so picquant.
I think, General, 'tis a little like my own.”</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="88"/>
Sir Sedley now advancing, seized the back of a
chair, which he twirled round for a resting place t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his elbow, and exclaimed, “You know yourself in∣vincible!”
with an air that shewed him languidly
prepared for her reproaches: but, to his own sur∣prise,
and that of all around him, she only, with a
smile and a nod, cried, “How do do?” and imme∣diately
turning wholly away from him, addressed her∣self
to Colonel Andover, desiring him to give her
the history of who was in the tea-room.</P>
<P>At this time a young Ensign, who had been en∣gaged
at a late dinner in the neighbourhood, stroamed
into the ball-room, with the most visible marks of
his unfitness for appearing in it; and, in total igno∣rance
of his own condition, went up to Colonel An∣dover,
and, clapping him upon the back, called out,
with a loud oath, “Colonel, I hope you have taken
care to secure to me the prettiest little young angel
in the room? You know with what sincerity I despise
an old hag.”</P>
<P>The Colonel, with some concern, advised him to
retire; but, insensible to his counsel, he uttered oath
upon oath, and added, “I'm not to be played upon,
Colonel. Beauty in a pretty girl is as necessary an
ingredient, as honour in a brave soldier; and I could
find in my heart to sink down to the bottom of the
Channel every fellow without one, and every dear
creature without the other.”</P>
<P>Then, in desiance of all remonstrance, he stag∣gered
into the tea-room: and, after a short survey,
stopt opposite to Indiana, and, swearing aloud she
was the handsomest angel he had ever beheld, begged
her hand without further ceremony; assuring her he
had broken up the best party that had yet been made
for him in the county, merely for the joy of dancing
with her.</P>
<P>Indiana, to whom not the smallest doubt of the
truth of this assertion occurred; and who, not sus∣pecting
he was intoxicated, thought his manner the
most spirited and gallant she had ever seen, was
readily accepting his offer: when Edgar, who saw
<PB N="89" REF="89"/>
her danger, started up, and exclaimed: “This lady,
Sir, is engaged to dance the next two dances with
me.”</P>
<P>“The lady did not tell me so, Sir!” cried the
Ensign, firing.</P>
<P>“Miss Lynmere,” replied Edgar, coolly, “will
pardon me, that on this occasion, my memory has
an interest to be better than her's. I believe it is
time for us to take our places.”</P>
<P>He then whispered a brief excuse to Camilla, and
hurried Indiana to the ball-room.</P>
<P>The Ensign, who knew not that she had danced
with him the last time, was obliged to submit;
while Indiana, not conjecturing the motive that now
impelled Edgar, was in a yet brighter blaze of beauty,
from an exhilarating notion that there was a contest
for the honour of her hand.</P>
<P>Camilla, once more disappointed of Edgar, had
now no resource against Mr. Dubster, but the non∣arrival
of the gloves; for he had talked so publicly
of waiting for them to dance with her, that every
one regarded her as engaged.</P>
<P>No new proposition being made for Eugenia, Miss
Margland permitted her again to be led out by the
handsome stranger.</P>
<P>When she was gone, Mr. Dubster, who kept con∣stantly
close to Camilla, said: “They tell me,
ma'am, that ugly little body's a great fortune.”</P>
<P>Camilla very innocently asked who he meant.</P>
<P>“Why that little lame thing, that was here drink∣ing
tea with you. Tom Hicks says she'll have a
power of money.”</P>
<P>Camilla, whose sister was deservedly dear to her,
looked much displeased; but Mr. Dubster, not per∣ceiving
it, continued: “He recommended it to me
to dance with her myself, from the first, upon that
account. But I says to him, says I, I had no notion
that a person, who had such a hobble in their gate,
would think of such a thing as going to dancing.
But there I was out, for as to the women, asking
your pardon, ma'am, there's nothing will put 'em off
<PB N="90" REF="90"/>
from their pleasure. But, however, for my part, I
had no thought of dancing at all, if it had not been
for that young gentleman's asking me; for I'm not
over fond of such jiggets, as they've no great use in
'em; only I happened to be this way, upon a little
matter of business, so I thought I might as well come
and see the hop, as Tom Hicks could contrive to get
me a ticket.”</P>
<P>This was the sort of discourse with which Camilla
was regaled till the two dances were over; and then,
begging her to sit still till he came back, he quitted
her, to see what he could do about his gloves.</P>
<P>Edgar, when he returned with Indiana, addressed
himself privately to Miss Margland, whom he ad∣vised
to take the yonng ladies immediately home; as
it would not be possible for him, a second time, to
break through the rules of the assembly, and Indiana
must, therefore, inevitably accept the young Ensign,
who already was following and claiming her, and
whose condition was obviously improper for the so∣ciety
of ladies.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, extremely pleased with him, for
thus protecting her pupil, instantly agreed; and,
collecting her three young charges, hastened them
down stairs; though the young Ensign, inflamed
with angry disappointment, uttered the most bitter
lamentations at their sudden departure; and though
Mr. Dubster, pursuing them to the coach door, called
out to Camilla, in a tone of pique and vexation,
“Why, what are you going for now, ma'am, when
I have just got a new pair of gloves, that I have
bought o' purpose?”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Family Breakfast.</HEAD>
<P>IN their way home, Edgar apologised to Camilla
for again foregoing the promised pleasure of dancing
with her, by explaining the situation of the Ensign.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="91"/>
Camilla, internally persuaded that any reason would
suffice for such an arrangement, where Indiana was
its object, scarce listened to an excuse which she
considered as unnecessary.</P>
<P>Indiana was eager to view in the glass how her
dress and ornaments had borne the shaking of the
dance, and curiously impatient to look anew at a
face and a figure of which no self-vanity, nor even
the adulation of Miss Margland, had taught her a
consciousness, such as she had acquired from the ad∣ventures
of this night. She hastened, therefore, to
her apartment as soon as she arrived at Cleves, and
there indulged in an examination which forbade all
surprise, and commanded equal justice for the ad∣mirers
and the admired.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, anxious to make her own report
to Sir Hugh, accompanied Camilla and Eugenia to
his room, where he was still sitting up for them.</P>
<P>She expatiated upon the behaviour of young Man∣dlebert,
in terms that filled the baronet with satis∣faction.
She exulted in the success of her own mea∣sures;
and, sinking the circumstance of the intended
impartiality of Edgar, enlarged upon his dancing,
out of his turn, with Indiana, as at an event which
manifested his serious designs beyond all possibility of
mistake.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, in the fulness of his content, promised
that when the wedding day arrived, they should all
have as fine new gowns as the bride herself.</P>
<P>The next morning, not considering that every one
else would require unusual repose, he got up before
his customary hour, from an involuntary hope of ac∣celerating
his favourite project; but he had long the
breakfast parlour to himself, and became so fatigued
and discomfited by fasting and waiting, that when
Indiana, who appeared last, but for whom he insisted
upon staying, entered the room, he said: “My
dear, I could really find a pleasure in giving you a
little scold, if it were not for setting a bad example,
which God forbid! And, indeed, it's not so much
your fault as the ball's, to which I can never be a
<PB N="92" REF="92"/>
sincere friend, unless it be just to answer some par∣ticular
purpose.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland defended her pupil, and called upon
Mandlebert for assistance, which he readily gave. Sir
Hugh then was not merely appeased but gratified,
and declared, the next moment, with a marked smile
at Indiana, that his breakfast had not relished so well
for a twelvemonth, owing to the advantage of not
beginning till he had got an appetite.</P>
<P>Soon after, Lionel, galloping across the park,
hastily dismounted, and scampered into the parlour.</P>
<P>The zealot for every species of sport, the candidate
for every order of whim, was the light-hearted
mirthful Lionel. A stranger to reflection, and in∣capable
of care, laughter seemed not merely the
bent of his humour, but the necessity of his existence:
he pursued it at all seasons, he indulged it upon all
occasions. With excellent natural parts, he trifled
away all improvement; without any ill temper, he
spared no one's feelings. Yet, though not radically
vicious, nor deliberately malevolent, the egotism
which urged him to make his own amusement his first
pursuit, sacrificed his best friends and first duties, if
they stood in its way.</P>
<P>“Come, my little girls, come!” cried he, as he
entered the room; “get your hats and cloaks as fast
as possible; there is a public breakfast at Northwick,
and you are all expected without delay.”</P>
<P>This sudden invitation occasioned a general com∣motion.
Indiana gave an involuntary jump; Camilla
and Eugenia looked delighted; and Miss Margland
seemed ready to second the proposition; but Sir
Hugh, with some surprise, exclaimed: “A public
breakfast, my dear boy! why where's the need of
that, when we have got so good a private one?”</P>
<P>“O, let us go! let us go, uncle!” cried Indiana.
“Miss Margland, do pray speak to my uncle to let
us go!”</P>
<P>“Indeed, Sir,” said Miss Margland, “it is time
now, in all conscience, for the young ladies to see a
little more of the world, and that it should be known
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
who they are. I am sure they have been immured
long enough, and I only wish you had been at the
ball last night, Sir, yourself!”</P>
<P>“Me, Mrs. Margland! Lord help me! what
should I do at such a thing as that, with all this gout
in my hip?”</P>
<P>“You would have seen, Sir, the fine effects of
keeping the young ladies out of society in this man∣ner.
Miss Camilla, if I had not prevented it, would
have danced with I don't know who; and as to Miss
Eugenia, she was as near as possible to not dancing
at all, owing to nobody's knowing who she was.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had no time to reply to this attack,
from the urgency of Indiana, and the impetuosity of
Lionel, who, applying to Camilla, said: “Come,
child, ask my uncle yourself, and then we shall go
at once.”</P>
<P>Camilla readily made it her own request.</P>
<P>“My dear,” answered Sir Hugh, “I can't be so
unnatural to deny you a little pleasure, knowing you
to be such a merry little whirligig; not but what
you'd enjoy yourself just as much at home, if they'd
let you alone. However, as Indiana's head is so
much turned upon it, for which I beg you won't think
the worse of her, Mr. Mandlebert, it being no more
than the common sault of a young person no older
than her; why, you must all go, I think, provided
you are not satisfied already, which, by the breakfast
you have made, I should think likely enough to be
the case.”</P>
<P>They then eagerly arose, and the females hastened
to make some change in their dress. Sir Hugh,
calling Eugenia back, said: “As to you, my little
classic, I make but small doubt you will be half ready
to break your heart at missing your lesson, knowing
hic haec, hoc, to be dearer to you, and for good rea∣sons
enough, too, in the end, than all the hopping
and skipping in the world; so if you had rather stay
away, don't mind all those dunces; for so I must
needs call them, in comparison to you and Dr. Ork∣borne,
though without the least meaning to under∣value
them.”</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="94"/>
Eugenia frankly acknowledged she had been much
amused the preceding evening, and wished to be again
of the party.</P>
<P>“Why then, if that's the case,” said the baronet,
the best way will be for Dr. Orkborne to be your
'squire; by which means you may have a little study
as you go along, to the end that the less time may be
thrown away in doing nothing.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, who perceived no objection to this idea,
assented, and went quietly up stairs, to prepare for
setting out. Sir Hugh, by no means connecting the
laughter of Lionel, nor the smile of Edgar, with his
proposal, gravely repeated it to Dr. Orkborne,
adding: “And if you want a nice pair of gloves,
Doctor, not that I make the offer in any detriment
to your own, but I had six new pair come home just
before my gout, which, I can assure you, have never
seen the light since, and are as much at your service as
if I had bespoke them on purpose.”</P>
<P>The mirth of Lionel grew now so outrageous, that
Dr. Orkborne, much offended, walked out of the
room without making any answer.</P>
<P>“There is something,” cried Sir Hugh, after a
pause, “in these men of learning, prodigious nice to
deal with; however, not understanding them, in point
of their maxims, it's likely enough I may have done
something wrong; for he could not have seemed
much more affronted, if I had told him I had six new
pair of gloves lying by me, which he should be never
the better for.”</P>
<P>When they were all ready, Sir Hugh, calling to
Edgar, said: “Now as I don't much chuse to have
my girls go to these sort of places often, which is a
prudence that I dare say you approve as much as my∣self,
I would wish to have the most made of them at
once; and, therefore, as I've no doubt but they'll
strike up a dance, after having eat what they think
proper, why I would advise you, Mr. Mandlebert,
to let Indiana trip it away till she's heartily tired, for
else she'll never give it up, with a good grace, of her
own accord.”</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95"/>
“Certainly, Sir,” answered Edgar, “I shall not
hurry the ladies.”</P>
<P>“O, as to any of the rest,” interrupted Sir Hugh,
“they'll be as soon satisfied as yourself, except”
lowering his voice “Mrs. Margland, who, between
friends, seems to me as glad of one of those freaks,
as when she was but sixteen; which how long it is
since she was no more I can't pretend to say, being a
point she never mentions.”</P>
<P>Then addressing them in general: “I wish you a
good breakfast,” he cried, “with all my heart,
which I think you pretty well deserve, considering you
go so far for it, with one close at your elbow, but just
swallowed. And so, my dear Indiana, I hope you
won't tire Mr. Mandlebert more than can't be
avoided.”</P>
<P>“How came you to engage Indiana again, Man∣dlebert?”
cried Lionel, in their way to the carriage.</P>
<P>“Because,” said Miss Margland, finding he he∣sitated,
“there is no other partner so proper for Miss
Lynmere.”</P>
<P>“And pray what's the matter with me? why am
not I as proper as Mandlebert?”</P>
<P>“Because you are her relation, to be sure!”</P>
<P>“Well,” cried he, vaulting his horse, “if I meet
but the charming widow, I shall care for none of
you.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Public Breakfast.</HEAD>
<P>THE unfitting, however customary, occasion of
this speedy repetition of public amusement in the
town of Northwick, was, that the county assizes
were now held there: and the arrival of the Judges
of the land, to hear causes which kept life or death
suspended, was the signal for entertainment to the
<PB N="96" REF="96"/>
surrounding neighbourhood: a hardening of huma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
feelings against human crimes and human miseries, at
which reflection revolts, however habit may per∣severe.</P>
<P>The young men, who rode on first, joined the
ladies as they entered the town, and told them to
drive straight to the ball-room, where the company
had assembled, in consequence of a shower of rain
which had forced them from the public garden in∣tended
for the breakfast.</P>
<P>“Here, as they stopt, a poor woman, nearly in
rags, with one child by her side, and another in her
arms, approached the carriage, and presenting a pe∣tition,
besought the ladies to read or hear her case.
Eugenia, with the ready impulse of generous afflu∣ence,
instantly felt for her purse; but Miss Margland,
angrily holding her hand, said, with authority:
“Miss Eugenia, never encourage beggars; you don't
know the mischief you may do by it.” Eugenia re∣luctantly
desisted, but made a sign to her footman to
give something for her. Edgar then alighting, ad∣va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d
to hand them from the coach, while Lionel
ran forward to settle their tickets of admittance.</P>
<P>The woman now grew more urgent in her suppli∣cations,
and Miss Margland in her remonstrances
against attending to them.</P>
<P>Indiana, who was placed under the care of Edgar,
enchanted to again display herself where sure of again
being admired, neither heard nor saw the petitioner;
but dimpling and smiling, quickened her motions to∣wards
the assembly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom: while Camilla, who was
last, stopping short, said: “What is the matter, poor
woman?” and took her paper to examine.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, snatch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g it from her, threw it
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ground, peremptorily saying: “Miss Camilla,
if once you begin such a thing as that, there will be
no end to it; so come along with the rest of your
company, like other people.”</P>
<P>She then haughtily proceeded; but Camilla,
brought up by her admirable parents never to pass
distress without inquiry, nor to refuse giving at all,
<PB N="97" REF="97"/>
because she could give but little, remained with the
poor object, and repeated her question. The wo∣man,
shedding a torrent of tears, said she was wife
to one of the prisoners who was to be tried the next
day, and who expected to lose his life, or be trans∣ported,
for only one bad action of stealing a leg of
mutton; which, though she knew it to be a sin, was
not without excuse, being a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offence, and com∣mitted
in poverty and sicknes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And this, she was
told, the Judges would take into consideration; but
her husband was now so ill, that he could not seed on
the gaol allowance, and not having wherewithal to
buy any other, would either die before his trial, or
be too weak to make known his sad story in his own
behalf, for want of some wine or some b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth to sup∣port
him in the meanwhile.</P>
<P>Camilla, hastily giving her a shilling, took one of
her petitions, and promising to do all in her power to
serve her, left the poor creature almost choaked with
sobbing j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. She was flying to join her party, when
she perceived Edgar at her side. “I came to see,”
cried he, with glistening eyes, “if you were running
away from us; but you were doing far better in not
thinking of us at all.”</P>
<P>Camilla, accustomed from her earliest childhood to
attend to the indigent and unhappy, felt neither re∣treating
shame, nor parading pride in the office; she
gave him the petition of the poor woman, and beg∣ged
he would consider if there was any thing that
could be done for her husband.</P>
<P>“I had received a paper from herself,” he answer∣ed,
“before you alighted; and I hope I should not
have neglected it: but I will now take yours, that
my memory may run no risk.”</P>
<P>They then went on to the assembly room.</P>
<P>The company, which was numerous, was already
seated at breakfast. Indiana and Camilla, now first
surveyed by day-light, again <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all eyes; but,
in the simplicity of undre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uperiority of Indi∣ana
was no longer wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, though the ge∣neral
voice was still strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> savour.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="98"/>
Indiana was a beauty of so regular a cast, that her
face had no feature, no look to which criticism could
point as susceptible of improvement, or on which ad∣miration
could dwell with more delight than on the rest.
No statuary could have modelled her form with more
exquisite symmetry; no painter have harmonised her
complexion with greater brilliancy of colouring.
But here ended the liberality of nature, which, in
not fullying this fair workmanship by inclosing in it
what was bad, contentedly left it vacant of whatever
was noble and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sirable.</P>
<P>The beauty of Camilla, though neither perfect nor
regular, had an influence so peculiar on the beholder,
it was hard to catch its fault; and the cynic connois∣seur,
who might persevere in seeking it, would in vo∣luntarily
surrender the strict rules of his art to the
predominance of its loveliness. Even judgment it∣self,
the coolest and last betrayed of our faculties, she
took by surprise, though it was not till she was ab∣sent
the seizure was detected. Her disposition was
ardent in sincerity, her mind untainted with evil.
The reigning and radical defect of her character—
an imagination that submitted to no control—prov∣ed
not any antidote against her attractions; it caught,
by its force and fire, the quick-kindling admiration
of the lively; it possessed, by magnetic pervasion,
the witchery to create sympathy in the most serious.</P>
<P>In their march up the room, Camilla was spoken
to by a person from the tea-table, who was distinct
from every other, by being particularly ill dressed;
and who, though she did not know him, asked her
how she did, with a familiar look of intimacy. She
slightly curtsied, and endeavoured to draw her party
more nimbly on; when another person, equally con∣spicuous,
though from being accoutred in the oppo∣site
extreme of full dress, quitting his seat, formally
made up to her, and drawing on a stiff pair of new
gloves as he spoke, said: “So you are come at last,
ma'am! I began to think you would not come at
all, begging that gentleman's p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdon, who told me
to the contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> night, when I thought, thinks I,
<PB N="99" REF="99"/>
here I've bought these new gloves, for no reason but
to oblige the young lady, and now I might as well
not have bought 'em at all.”</P>
<P>Camilla, ready to laugh, yet much provoked at
this renewed claim from her old persecutor, Mr.
Dubster, looked vainly for redress at the mischievous
Lionel, who arc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly answered: “O, ay, true, sister;
I told the gentleman, last night, you would be sure
to make him amends this morning for putting him
to so much expence.”</P>
<P>“I'm sure, Sir,” said Mr. Dubster, “I did not
speak for that, expence being no great matter to me
at this time; only nobody likes to fool away their
money for nothing.”</P>
<P>Edgar having now, at the end of one of the ta∣bles,
secured places for the ladies, Lionel again, in
defiance of the frowns of Miss Margland, invited Mr.
Dubster to join them: even the appealing looks of
Camilla served but to increase her brother's ludi∣crous
diversion, in coupling her with so ridiculous a
companion; who, without seeming at all aware of
the liberty he was taking, engrossed her wholly.</P>
<P>“So I see, ma'am,” he cried, pointing to Euge∣nia,
“you've brought that limping little body with
you again? Tom Hicks had like to have took me in
finely about her! He thought she was the great for∣tune
of these here parts; and if it had not been for
the young gentleman, I might have known no bet∣ter
neither, for there's half the room in the same
scrape at this minute.”</P>
<P>Observing Camilla regard him with an unpleasant
surprise, he more solemnly added: “I ask pardon,
ma'am, for mentioning the thing, which I only do
in excuse for what I said last night, not knowing
then you was the fortune yourself.”</P>
<P>An eager sign of silence from Lionel, forbade her
explaining this mistake; Mr. Dubster, therefore, pro∣ceeded:</P>
<P>“When Tom Hicks told me about it, I said at
the time, says I, she looks more like to some so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of
an humble young person, just brought out of a little
<PB N="100" REF="100"/>
good-nature to see the company, and the like of
that; for she's not a bit like a lady of fortunes, with
that nud<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and I said to Tom Hicks, by
way of joke, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I, if I was to think of her, which I
don't think I shall, at least she would not be much
in my way, for she could not follow a body much
about, because of that hitch in her gait, for I'm a
pretty good walker.”</P>
<P>Here the ill dressed man, who had alr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ady spoken
to Camilla, quitting his seat, strolled up to her, and
fast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning his eyes upon her face, though without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owing, made some speech about the weather, with
the lounging freedom of manner of a confirmed old
acquaintance. His whole appearance had an air of
even wilful slovenliness: His hair was uncombed;
he was in boots, which were covered with mud; his
coat seemed to have been designedly emerged in
powder, and his universal negligence was not only
shabby but uncleanly. Astonished and offended by
his forwardness, Camilla turned entirely away from
him.</P>
<P>Not disconcerted by this distance, he procured a
chair, upon which he cast himself, perfectly at his
ease, immediately behind her.</P>
<P>Just as the general breakfast was over, and the
waiters were summoned to clear away the tables, and
prepare the room for dancing, the lady who had so
strikingly made her appearance the preceding even∣ing,
again entered. She was alone, as before, and
walked up the room with the same decided air of in∣difference
to all opinion; sometimes knotting with
as much diligence and earnestness as if her subsistence
depended upon the rapidity of her work; and at
other times stopping short, she applied to her eye a
near-sighted glass, which hung to her finger, and
intently examined some particular person or group;
then, with a look of absence, as if she had not seen
a creature, she hummed an opera song to herself, and
proceeded. Her rouge was remarkably well put on,
and her claim to being still a sine woman, though past
<PB N="101" REF="101"/>
her prime, was as obvious as it as conscious: Her
dress was more fantastic and studied than the night
before, in the same propo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion as that of every other
person pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent was more simple and quiet; and the
commanding air of her c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tenance, and the easiness
of her carriage, spoke a confirmed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance,
that her cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and her power were absolute,
wherever she thought their ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion worth her
trouble.</P>
<P>When she came to the head of the room, she
turned about, and with her glass, surveyed the whole
company; then smilingly advancing to the sloven,
whom Camilla was shunning, she called out: “O! are
yon there? what rural deity could break your rest so
early?</P>
<P>“None!” answered he, rubbing his eyes; “I am
invulnerably a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>p at this very moment! In the very
centre of the morphetic dominions. But how bar∣barously
late you are! I should never have come to
this vastly horri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place before my ride, if I had ima∣gined
you could be so excruciating.”</P>
<P>Struck with a j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of which she could not sus∣pect
two persons to be capable, Camilla turned round
to her slighted neighbour, and with the greatest sur∣prise
recognised, upon examination, the most brilliant
beau of the preceding evening, in the worst dressed
man of the present morning.</P>
<P>The lady now, again holding her glass to her eye,
which she directed without seruple towards Camilla
and her party, said: “Who have you got there?”</P>
<P>Camilla looked hastily away, and her whole set,
aba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed by so unseasoned an inquiry, cast down their
eyes.</P>
<P>“Hey!” cried he, calmly viewing them, as if for
the first time himself: “Why, I'll tell you!” Then
making her bend to hear his whisper, which never∣theless,
was by no means intended for her own ear
alone, he added: “Two little things as pretty
as angels, and two others as ugly as—I s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
more!”</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="102"/>
“O, I take in the full force of your metaphor!”
cried she, laughing; “and acknowledge the truth
of its contrast.”</P>
<P>Camilla alone, as they meant, had heard them;
and ashamed for herself, and provoked to find Eu∣genia
coupled with Miss Margland, she endeavoured
to converse with some of her own society; but their
attention was entirely engaged by the whisperers;
nor could she, for more than a minute, deny her own
curiosity the pleasure of observing them.</P>
<P>They now spoke together for some time in low
voices, laughing immoderately at the occasional sallies
of each other; Sir Sedley Clarendel sitting at his
ease, Mrs. Arlbery standing, and knotting by his
side.</P>
<P>The officers, and almost all the beaux, began to
crowd to this spot: but neither the gentleman nor
the lady interrupted their discourse to return or re∣ceive
any sal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tations. Lionel, who with much eager∣ness
had quitted an inside seat at a long table▪ to pay
his court to Mrs. Arlbery, could catch neither her
eye nor her ear for his bow or his compliment.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, at last, looking up in her face and
smiling, said: “A'n't you shockingly tired?”</P>
<P>“To death!” answered she, co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly.</P>
<P>“Why then, I am afraid, I must positively do
the thing that's old fashioned.”</P>
<P>And rising, and making her a very elegant how,
he presented her his seat, adding: “There, ma'am!
I have the honour to give you my chair—at the ris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of my reputation.”</P>
<P>“I should have thought,” cried Lionel, now
getting forward, “that omitting to give it would
rather have risked your reputation.”</P>
<P>“Is it possible you could be born before all that
was over?” said Mrs. Arlbery, dropping carelessly
upon the chair as she perceived Lionel, whom she
honoured with a nod: “How do do, Mr. Tyrold?
are you just come in?” But turning again to Sir
Sedley, without waiting for his answer, “I swear,
you barbarian,” she cried, “you have really almost
“killed me with fatigue.”</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="103"/>
“Have I indeed?” said he, smiling.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster now, leaning over the table, solemnly
said: “I am sure I should have offered the lady my
own place, if I had not been so tired myself; but
Tom Hicks over-persuaded me to dance a bit before
you came in, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am,” addressing Camilla, “for you
have lost a deal of dancing by coming so late; for
they all fell to as soon as ever they come; and, as
I'm not over and above used to it, it soon makes one
a little stissish, as one may say; and indeed, the
lady's much better off in getting a chair, for one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
mighty little at one's case on these here beaches, with
nothing to lean one's back against.”</P>
<P>“And who's that?” cried Mrs. Arlbery to Sir
Sedley, looking Mr. Dubster full in the face.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley made some answer in a whisper, which
proved highly entertaining to them both. Mr.
Dubster, with an air much offended, said to Ca∣milla:
“People's laughing and whispering, when
one don't know what it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s about, is not one of the
politest things, I know, for polite people to do;
and, in my mind, they ought to be above it.”</P>
<P>This resentment excited Lionel to join in the
laugh; and Mr. Dubster, with great gravity of
manner, rose, and said to Camilla: “When you
are ready to dance, ma'am, I am willing to be your
partner, and I shan't engage myself to nobody else;
but I shall go to t'other end of the room till you
choose to stand up; for I don't much care to stay
here, only to be laughed at, when I don't know
what it's for.”</P>
<P>They now all left the table; and Lionel eagerly
begged permission to introduce his sisters and cousin
to Mrs. Arlbery, who readily consented to the pro∣posal.</P>
<P>Indiana advanced with pleasure into a circle of
beaux, whose eyes were most assiduous to welcome
her. Camilla, though a little alarmed in being pre∣sented
to a lady of so singular a deportment, had
yet a curiosity to see more of her, that willingly se∣conded
her brother's motion. And Eugenia, to
<PB N="104" REF="104"/>
whose early reflecting mind every new character and
new scene opened a f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh fund for thought, if not for
knowledge, was charmed to take a nearer view of
what promised such food for observation. But Miss
Margland began an angry remonstrance against the
proceedings of Lionel, in thus taking out of her
hands the direction of her charges. What she urged,
however, was vain: Lionel was only diverted by her
wrath, and the three young ladies, as they had not
requested the introduction, did not feel themselves
responsible for its taking effect.</P>
<P>Lionel led them on: Mrs. Arlbery half rose to
return their curtsies; and gave them a reception so
full of vivacity and good humour, that they soon
forgot the ill-will with which Miss Margland had
suffered them to quit her; and even lost all recol∣lection
that it belonged to them to return to her.
The satisfaction of Indiana, indeed, flowed simply
from the glances of admiration which every where
met her eye; but Eugenia attended to every word,
and every motion of Mrs. Arlbery, with that sort
of earnestness which marks an intelligent child at a
first play; and Camilla, still more struck by the no∣velty
of this new acquaintance, scarce permitted
herself to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>the, lest she should lose any thing she
said.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery perceived their youthful wonder,
and selt a propensity to increase it, which strength∣ened
all her powers, and called forth all her faculties.
Wit she possessed at will; and, with exertions which
rendered it uncommonly brilliant, she displayed it,
now to them, now to the gentlemen, with a gaiety
so fantastic, a raillery <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o arch, a spirit of satire so
seasoned with a delight in coquetry, and a certain
negligence of air so enlivened by a whimsical plea∣santry,
that she could not have failed to strike with
admiration even the most hackneyed seekers of cha∣racter:
much less the inexperienced young creatures
now presented to her; who, with open eyes and
ears, regarded her as a phenomenon, upon finding
<PB N="105" REF="105"/>
that the splendor of her talents equalled the singu∣larity
of her manners.</P>
<P>When the room was prepared for dancing, Major
Cerwood brought to Indiana Mr. Macdersey, the
young Ensign who had so improperly addressed her
at the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll; and, after a formal apology, in his
name, for what had passed, begged the honour of
her hand for him this morning. Indiana, flattered
and fluttered together by this ceremony, almost for∣got
Edgar, who stood quietly but watchfully aloof,
and was actually giving her consent when, meeting
his eye, she recollected she was already engaged.
Mr. Macdersey hoped for more success another time,
and Edgar advanced to lead his fair partner to her
place.</P>
<P>Major Cerwood offered himself to Camilla; but
Mr. Dubster coming forward, pulled him by the el∣bow,
and making a stiff low bow, said: “Sir, I
ask your pardon, for taking the liberty of giving you
such a jog, but the young lady's been engaged to
me ever so long.” The Major looked surprised;
but, observing that Camilla coloured, he bowed re∣spectfully
and retreated.</P>
<P>Camilla, ashamed of her beau, determined not to
dance at all: though she saw, with much vexation,
upon the general dispersion, Miss Margland approach
to claim her. Educated in all the harmony of con∣tentment
and benevolence, she had a horror of a
temper so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ascible, that made it a penance to re∣main
a moment in its vicinity. Mr. Dubster, how∣ever,
lest her not alone to it: when she positively
refused his hand, he said it was equal agreeable to
him to have only a little dish of chat with her; and
composedly stationed himself before her. Eugenia
had already been taken out by the handsome stran∣ger,
with whom she had danced the evening before;
and Lionel, bewitched with Mrs. Arlbery, enlisted
himself entirely in her train; and with Sir Sedley
Clarendel, and almost every man of any consequence
in the room, declined all dancing for the pleasure of
attending her.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="106"/>
Mr. Dubster, unacquainted with the natural high
spirits of Camilla, inferred nothing to his own disad∣vantage
from her silence, but talked incessantly him∣self
with perfect complacency. “Do you know,
ma'am,” cried he, “just as that elderly lady, that,
I suppose, is your mamma, took you all away in
that hurry last night, up comes the boy with my new
pair of gloves! but though I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un down directly to
tell you of it, there was no making the old lady
stop; which I was fool to try at; for as to women,
I know their obstinacy of old. But what I grudged
the most was, as soon as I come up again, as ill luck
would have it, Tom Hicks finds me my own t'other
glove! So there I had two pair, when I might as
well have had never a one!”</P>
<P>Observing that Eugenia was dancing, “Lack a∣day!”
he exclaimed, “I'll lay a wager that poor
gentleman has been took in, just as I was yesterday!
He thinks that young lady that's had the small-pox
so bad, is you, ma'am! 'Twould be a fine joke if
such a mistake as that should get the little lame duck,
as I call her, a husband! He'd be in a fine hobble
when he found he'd got nothing but her ugly face
for his bargain. Though, provided she'd had the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hino, it would not much have signified: for, as to
being pretty or not, it's no great matter in a wife.
A man soon tires of seeing nothing but the same
face, if it's one of the best.”</P>
<P>Camilla here, in the midst of her chagrin, could
not forbear asking him if he was married? “Yes,
ma'am,” answered he calmly, “I've had two wives
to my share already; so I know what I'm speaking
of; though I've buried them both. Why it was all
along of my wives, what with the money I had with
one, and what with the money I had with the other,
that I got out of business so soon.”</P>
<P>“You were very much obliged to them, then?”</P>
<P>“Why, yes, ma'am, as to that, I can't say to
the contrary, now that they're gone: but I can't
say I had much comfort with 'em while they lived.
They was always a thinking they had a right to
<PB N="107" REF="107"/>
what they had a mind, because of what they brought
me; so that I had enough to do to scrape a little
matter together, in case of outliving them. One of
'em has not been dead above a twelvemonth, or there
about; these are the first clothes I've bought since I
left off my blacks.”</P>
<P>When Indiana past them, he expressed his admi∣ration
of her beauty. “That young lady, ma'am,”
he said, “cuts you all up, sure enough. She's as
fine a piece of red and white as ever I see. I could
think of such a young lady as that myself, if I did
not remember that I thought no more of my wife
that was pretty, than of my wise that was ugly,
after the first month or so. Beauty goes for a mere
nothing in matrimony, when once one's used to it.
Besides, I've no great thoughts at present of enter∣ing
into the state again of one while, at any rate,
being but just got to be a little comfortable.”</P>
<P>The second dance was now called, when Mrs.
Arlbery, coming suddenly behind Camilla, said, in
a low voice, “Do you know who you are talking
with?”</P>
<P>“No, ma'am!”</P>
<P>“A young tinker, my dear! that's all!” And,
with a provoking nod, she retreated.</P>
<P>Camilla, half ready to laugh, half to cry, re∣strained
herself with difficulty from running after her;
and Mr. Dubster, observing that she abruptly turned
away, and would listen no more, again claimed her
for his partner; and, upon her absolute refusal, sur∣prised
and affronted, walked off in silence. She
was then finally condemned to the morose society of
Miss Margland: and invectives against Sir Hugh
for mismanagement, and Lionel, with whom now
that lady was at open war, for impertinence, silled
up the rest of her time, till the company was inform∣ed
that refreshments were served in the card-room.</P>
<P>Thither, immediately, every body flocked, with
as much speed and avidity, as if they had learnt to
appreciate the blessing of plenty, by the experience
of want. Such is the vacancy of dissipated pleasure,
<PB N="108" REF="108"/>
that, never satisfied with what it possesses, an open∣ing
always remains for something yet to be tried,
and, on that something still to come, all enjoyment
seems to depend.</P>
<P>The day beginning now to clear, the sashes of a
large bow-window were thrown up. Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel
sauntered thither, and instantly every body
followed, as if there were no breathing any where
else; declaring, while they pressed upon one ano∣ther
almost to suffocation, that nothing was so reviv∣ing
as the fresh air: and, in a minute, not a creature
was to be seen in any other part of the room.</P>
<P>Here, in full view, stood sundry hapless relations
of the poorer part of the prisoners to be tried the
next morning, who, with supplicating hands and
eyes, implored the compassion of the company,
whom their very calamities assembled for amusement.</P>
<P>Nobody took any notice of them; nobody ap∣peared
even to see them: but, one by one, all
glided gently away, and the bow-window was pre∣sently
the only empty space in the apartment.</P>
<P>Camilla, contented with having already presented
her mite, and Eugenia, with having given her's in
commission, retired unaffectedly with the rest; while
Miss Margland, shrugging up her shoulders, and
declaring there was no end of beggars, pompously
added, “However, we gave before we came in.”</P>
<P>Presently, a paper was handed about to collect
half guineas for a raffle. A beautiful locket, set
round with pearls, ornamented at the top with a
little knot of small brilliants, and very clegantly
shaped, with a space left for a braid of hair, or a
cypl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, was produced; and, as if by magnetic
power, attracted into almost every hand the capri∣cious
coin, which distress, but the moment before
had repelled.</P>
<P>Miss Margland lamented she had only guineas or
silver, but suffered Edgar to be her paymaster; pri∣vately
resolving, that if she won the locket, she would
remember the debt: Eugenia, amused in seeing the
humour of all that was going forward, readily put
<PB N="109" REF="109"/>
in; Indiana, satisfied her uncle would repay the
expences of the day, with a heart panting from hope
of the prize, did the same; but Camilla hung back,
totally unused to hazard upon what was unnecessary
the little allowance she had been taught to spend
sparingly upon herself, that something might be al∣ways
in her power to bestow upon others. The
character of this rassle was not of that interesting
nature which calls forth from the assluent and easy
respect as well as aid: the prize belonged to no one
whom adversity compelled to change what once was
an innocent luxury, into the means of subsistence;
it was the mere common mode of getting rid of a
mere common bauble, which no one had thought
worth the full price affixed to it by its toyman. She
knew not, however, till now, how hard to resist was
the contagion of example, and felt a struggle in her
self-denial, that made her, when she put the locket
down, withdraw from the crowd, and resolve not to
look at it again.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had observed her, read her secret
conflict with an emotion which impelled him to
follow her, that he might express his admiration;
but he was stopt by Mrs. Arlbery, who just then
hastily attacked her with, “What have you done
with your friend the tinker, my dear?”</P>
<P>Camilla, laughing, though extremely ashamed,
said, she knew nothing at all about him.</P>
<P>“You talked with him, then, by way of experi∣ment,
to see how you might like him?”</P>
<P>“No, indeed! I merely answered him when I
could not help it; but still I thought, at a ball,
gentlemen only would present themselves.”</P>
<P>“And how many couple,” said Mrs. Arlbery,
smiling, “do you calculate would, in that case,
stand up?”</P>
<P>She then ordered one of the beaux who attended
her, to bring her a chair, and told another to fetch
her the locket. Edgar was again advancing to Ca∣milla,
when Lionel, whose desire to obtain the good
graces of Mrs. Arlbery, had suggested to him an
<PB N="110" REF="110"/>
anticipation of her commands, pushed forward with
the locket.</P>
<P>“Well, really, it is not ugly,” cried she, taking
it in her hand: “Have you put in yet, Miss Ty∣rold?”</P>
<P>“No, ma'am.”</P>
<P>“O, I am vastly glad of that; for now we will
try our fortune together.”</P>
<P>Camilla, though secretly blushing at what she felt
was an extravagance, could not withstand this invi∣tation:
she gave her half guinea.</P>
<P>Edgar, disappointed, retreated in silence.</P>
<P>The money being collected, and the names of
ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers taken down, information was given, that the
prize was to be thrown for in three days time, at
one o'clock at noon, in the shop of a bookseller at
Northwick.</P>
<P>Some of the company now departed; others pre∣pared
for a last dance. Miss Margland desired Lionel
to see for their carriage; but Lionel had no greater
joy than to disregard her. Indiana asked earnestly
to stay longer; Miss Margland said, she could only
give way to her request, upon condition her partner
should be Mr. Mandlebert. It was in vain she urged
that she was already engaged to Colonel Andover;
Miss Margland was inexorable, and Edgar, laughing,
said, he should certainly have the whole co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps upon
his back; but the honour was sufficient to counter∣balance
the risk, and he would, therefore, beg the
Colonel's patience.</P>
<P>“Mr. Mandlebert,” said Miss Margland, “I
know enough of quarrels at balls about partners, and
ladies changing their minds, to know how to act
pretty well in those cases; I shall desire, therefore,
to speak to the Colonel myself, and not trust two
gentlemen together upon such a nice matter.”</P>
<P>She then be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>koned to the Colonel, who stood at
a little distance, and, taking him apart, told him,
she flattered herself he would not be offended, if
Miss Lynmere should dance again with Mr. Mandle∣bert,
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
though rather out of rule, as there were par∣ticular
reasons for it.</P>
<P>The Colonel, with a smile, said he perceived Mr.
Mandlebert was the happy man, and acquieseed.</P>
<P>A general murmur now ran buzzing round the
room, that Mr. Mandlebert and Miss Lynmere were
publicly contracted to each other; and, amongst
many who heard with displeasure that the young
beauty was betrothed before she was exhibited to
view, Mr. Macders<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y appeared to suffer the most
serious mortification.</P>
<P>As soon as this dance was over, Edgar conducted
his ladies to an apartment below stairs, and went in
search of the carriage.</P>
<P>He did not return for some time. Miss Margland,
as usual, grumbled; but Camilla, perceiving Mrs.
Arlbery, rejoiced in the delay; and stationed her∣self
by her side, all alive in attending to the plea∣santry
with which she was amusing herself and those
around her.</P>
<P>When Edgar, who seemed out of breath from
running, came back, he made but short answers to
the murmurs of Miss Margland; and, hastening to
Camilla, said: “I have been with your petition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:
she has all that can comfort her for the present;
and I have learnt the name of her husband's counsel.
You will be so good as to excuse me at dinner to
Sir Hugh. I shall remain here till I can judge what
may be done.”</P>
<P>The attention of Camilla was now effectually with∣drawn
from Mrs. Arlbery, and the purest delight of
which human feelings are susceptible, took sudden
and sole possession of her youthful mind, in the idea
of being instrumental to the preservation of a fellow∣creature.</P>
<P>Edgar saw, in the change, yet brightness of her
countenance, what p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed within;—and his dis∣appointment
concerning the rastle was immediately
forgotten.</P>
<P>A short consultation followed, in which both
spoke with so much energy, as not only to overpower
<PB N="112" REF="112"/>
the remonstrances of Miss Margland for their depar∣ture,
but to catch the notice of Mrs. Arlbery, who,
coming forward, and leaning her hand on the shoulder
of Camilla, said: “Tell me what it is that has
thus animated you? Have you heard any good tid∣ings
of your new friend?”</P>
<P>Camilla instantly and eagerly related the subject
that occupied them, without observing that the
whole company around were smiling, at her earnest∣ness
in a cause of such common distress.</P>
<P>“You are new, my dear,” said Mrs. Arlbery,
patting her cheek, “very new; but I take the whim
sometimes of being charitable myself, for a little
variety. It always looks pretty; and begging is no
bad way of shewing o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one's powers. So give me
your documents, and I'll give you my eloquence.”</P>
<P>Camilla presented her the petition, and she invited
Mandlebert to dine with her. Miss Margland then
led the way, and the female party returned to
Cleves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Ras<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le.</HEAD>
<P>IT was late when Edgar returned to Cleves. Ca∣milla
flew to meet him. He told her every thing re∣lative
to her petitioner was in the most prosperous
train; he had seen the prisoner, heard the particulars
of his story, which all tended to his exculpation;
and Mrs. Arlbery had contrived to make acquaint∣ance
with his counsel, whom she found perfectly
well disposed to exert himself in the cause, and whom
she had invited to a splendid supper. The trial was
to take place the next morning.</P>
<P>Camilla, already powerfully struck with Mrs.
Arlbery, was enchanted to find her thus active in
benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="113"/>
Edgar was to dine with that lady the next day,
and to learn the event of their joint exertions.</P>
<P>This proved all that could be wished. The pro∣secution
had been mild: the judge and jury had
been touched with compassion; and the venial of∣fender
had been released with a gentle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eprimand.</P>
<P>Mandlebert returned to communicate these tidings
to Camilla, with a pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asure exactly in unison with her
own. Mrs. Arlbery, he avewed, had been as zealous
as himself; and had manifested a charity of disposition
which the slightiness of her manners had not led him
to expect.</P>
<P>The next object of attention was the raffle, which
was to take place the following morning.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was a verse to letting his nieces go abroad
again so soon: but Miss Margland, extremely anxious
about her own chance for the prize, solemnly asserted
its necessity; inveighed against the mismanagement of
every thing at Cleves, stifled all her complaints of
Lionel, and pronounced a positive deeision, that, to
carry Indiana to public places, was the sole method
of promoting the match.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then, willing to believe, and yet more
willing to get rid of disputing with her, no longer
with-held his consent.</P>
<P>They were advanced within half a mile of North∣wick,
when a sick man, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfully supported by a
woman with a child in her arms, caught their eyes.
The ready hand of Eugenia was immediately in her
pocket; Camilla, locking more intently upon the
group, perceived another child, and presently re∣cognised
the wife of the prisoner. She called to the
coachman to stop, and Edgar, at the same moment,
rode up to the carriage.</P>
<P>Miss Margland angrily ordered the man to drive
on, saying, she was quite sick of being thus for ever
infested with beggars; who really came so often,
they were no better than pick-pockets.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114"/>
“O, don't refuse to let me speak to them!” cried
Camilla; “it will be such a pleasure to see their joy!”</P>
<P>“O yes! they look in much joy indeed! they
seem as if they had not eat a mors<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l these three
weeks! Drive on, I say, coachman! I like no such
melanchely fights, for my part. They always make
me ill. I wonder how any body can bear them.”</P>
<P>“But we may help them; we may assist them!”
said Camilla, with increasing earnestness.</P>
<P>“And pray, when they have got all our money,
who is to help us?”</P>
<P>Eugenia, delighted to give, but unhabituated to
any other exertion, slung half a crown to them; and
Indiana, begging to look out, said, “Dear! I
never saw a prisoner before!”</P>
<P>Encouraged by an expressive look from Camilla,
Edgar dismounted to hand her from the carriage, af∣fecting
not to hear the remonstrances of Miss Mar∣gland,
though she scrupled not to deliver them very
audibly. Eugenia languished to join them, but could
not venture to disobey a direct command; and In∣diana,
observing the road to be very dusty, submitted,
to sav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a pair of beautiful new shoes.</P>
<P>Camilla had all the gratification she promised her∣self,
in witnessing the happiness of the poor peti∣tioner.
He was crawling to Cleves, with his family,
to offer thanks. They were penniless, sick, and
wretched; yet the preservation of the poor man
seemed to make misery light to them all. Edgar
desired to know what were their designs for the fu∣ture.
The man answered that he should not dare go
back to his own country, because there his disgrace
was known, and he should procure no work; nor,
indeed, was he now able to do any. “So we must
make up our minds to beg from door to door, and in
the streets, and on the high road,” he continued;
“till I get back a little strength; and can earn a
living more creditably.”</P>
<P>“But as long as we have kept you alive, and
saved you from being transported,” said his wife,
“for which all thanks be due to this good gentleman,
<PB N="115" REF="115"/>
we shall mind no hardships, and never go astray again,
in wicked unthinkingness of this great mercy.”</P>
<P>Edgar inquired what had been their former occu∣pations;
they answered, they had both been day∣workers
in the field, till a sit of sickness had hin∣dered
the poor man from getting his livelihood: pe∣nury
and hunger then pressing hard upon them all,
he had been tempted to commit the offence for which
he was taken, and brought to death's door. “But
as now,” he added, “I have been saved, I shall
make it a warning for the time to c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, and never
give myself up to so bad a course again.”</P>
<P>Edgar asked the woman what money she had lest.</P>
<P>“Ah, Sir, none! for we had things to pay, and
people to satisfy, and so every thing you and the
good ladies gave us, is all gone; for while any thing
was left us, they would not be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy. But this is no
great mischief now, as my husband is not taken away
from us, and is come to a right sense.”</P>
<P>“I believe,” said Edgar, “you are very good
sort of people, however distress had misguided you.”</P>
<P>He then put something into the man's hand, and
Eugenia, who from the carriage window <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what
passed, flung him another half crown; Camilla added
a shilling, and turning suddenly away, walked a few
paces from them all.</P>
<P>Edgar, gently following, inquired if any thing
was the matter; her eyes were full of tears: “I was
thinking,” she cried, “what my dear father would
have said, had he seen me giving half a guinea for a
toy, and a shilling to such poor starving people as
these!”</P>
<P>“Why, what would he have said?” cried Edgar,
charmed with her penitence, though joining in the
apprehended censure.</P>
<P>“He would more than ever have pitied those who
want money, in seeing it so squand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red by one who
should better have remembered his lessons! O, if I
could but recover that half guinea!”</P>
<P>“Will you give me leave to get it back <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or you?”</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="116"/>
“Leave? you would lay me under the greatest
obligation! How far half a gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ea would go here,
in poverty such as this!”</P>
<P>He assured her he could regain it without diffi∣cult;
and then, telling the poor people to postpone
their walk to Cleves till the evening, when Camilla
meant to prepare her uncle, also to assist them, he
handed her to the coach, with feeling<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet more
pleased than her own, and galloped forward to exe∣cute
his commission.</P>
<P>He was ready at the door of the library to receive
them. As they alighted, Camilla eagerly cried:
“Well! have you succeeded?”</P>
<P>“Can you trust yourself to this spot, and to a re∣view
of the allurement,” answered he, smiling, and
holding half a guineaa between his fingers, “yet be
content to see your chance for the prize withdrawn?”</P>
<P>“O give it me!” give it me!” cried she, almost
seizing it from him, “my dear father will be so glad
to hear I have not spent it so f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lishly.”</P>
<P>The rafflers were not yet assembled; no one was
in the shop but a well dressed elegant young man,
who was reading at a table, and who neither raised
his eyes at their entrance, nor suffered their discourse
to interrupt his attention; yet though abstracted from
outward objects, his studiousness was not of a solemn
cast; he seemed wrapt in what h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was reading with
a pleasure amounting to extacy. He started, acted,
smiled, and looked pensive in turn; while his seatures
were thrown into a thousand different expressions, and
his person was almost writhed with perpetually
varying gestures. From time to time his rapture
broke forth into loud exclamations of “Exquisite!
exquisite!” while he beat the leaves of the book
violently with his hands, in token of applause, or
lifting them up to his lips, almost devoured with kisses
the passages that charmed him. Sometimes he read
a few words aloud, calling out “Heavenly!” and
vehemently stamping his approbation with his feet;
then suddenly shutting up the book, folded his arms,
and casting his eyes towards the ceiling, uttered:</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="117"/>
“O too much! too much! there is no standing it!”
yet again, the next minute, opened it and resumed
the lecture.</P>
<P>The youthful group was much diverted with this
unintended exhibition. To Eugenia alone it did not
appear ridiculous; she simply envied his transports,
and only wished to discover by what book they were
excited. Edgar and Camilla amused themselves with
conjecturing various authors; Indiana and Miss Mar∣gland
required no such aid to pass their time, while,
with at least equal delight, they contemplated the
hoped-for prize.</P>
<P>Lionel now bounced in: “Why what,” cried he,
“are you all doing in this musty old shop, when Mrs.
Arlbery and all the world are enjoying the air on the
public walks?”</P>
<P>Camilla was instantly for joining that lady; but
Engenia felt an unconquerable curiosity to learn the
running title of the book. She stole softly round to
look over the snoulder of the reader, and her respect
for his raptures increased, when she saw they were
raised by Thomson's Seasons.</P>
<P>Neither this approach, nor the loud call of Lionel,
had interrupted the attention of the young student,
who perceived and regarded nothing but what he
was about; and though occasionally he ceased read∣ing
to indulge in passionate ejaculations, he seemed
to hold every thing else beneath his consideration.</P>
<P>Lionel, drawn to observe him from the circuit
made by Eugenia, exclaimed: “What, Melmond▪
why, how long have you been in Hampshire?”</P>
<P>The youth, surprised from his absence of mind by
the sound of his own name, looked up and said:
“Who's that?”</P>
<P>“Why, when the deuce did you come into this
part of the world?” cried Lionel, approaching him
to shake hands.</P>
<P>“O! for pity's sake,” answered he, with energy,
“don't interrupt me!”</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118"/>
“Why not? have not you enough of that dry
work at Oxford? Come, come, have done with this
boyish stuff, and behave like a man.”</P>
<P>“You di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ract me,” answered Melmond, motion∣ing
him away: “I am in a scene that entrances me
to Elysium! I have never read it since I could ap∣preciate
it.”</P>
<P>“What! old Thomson?” said Lionel, peeping
over him; “why, I never read him at all. Come,
man! (giving him a slap on the shoulder,) come
along with me, and I'll shew you something more
worth looking at.”</P>
<P>“You will drive me mad, if you break in upon
this episode! 'tis a picture of all that is divine upon
earth! hear it, only hear it!”</P>
<P>He then began the truly elegant and feeling de∣scription
that concludes Thomson's Spring; and
though Lionel, with a loud shout, cried: “Do you
think I come hither for such fogrum stuff as that?”
and ran out of the shop; the “wrapt enthusias<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>”
continued reading aloud, too much delighted with
the pathos of his own voice in expressing the senti∣ments
of the poet, to deny himself a regale so sooth∣ing
to his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars.</P>
<P>Eugenia, enchanted, stood on tip-toe to hear him▪
her uplifted finger petitioning silence all around, and
her heart fondly repeating, O just such a youth be
Clermont! just such his passion for reading! just such
his fervour for poetry! just such his exaltation of de∣light
in literary yet domestic felicity!</P>
<P>Mandlebert, also, caught by the rehearsal of his
favourite picture of a scheme of human happiness,
which no time, no repetition can make vapid to a
feeling heart, stood pleased and attentive to hear
him; even Indiana, though she listened not to the
matter, was struck by the manner in which it was
delivered, which so resembled dramatic recitation,
that she thought herself at a play, and full of wonder,
advanced straight before him, to look full in his face,
and watch the motions of his right arm, with which
he acted incessantly, while the lest held his book.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="119"/>
Miss Margland concluded he was a strolling player,
and did not suffer him to draw her eyes from the
locket. But when, at the words
<Q><L>“—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>Retirement, rural <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, books,</L>

<L>Progressive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and appr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Heaven,”</L></Q>
Mandlebert turned softly round to read their impres∣sion
on the countenance of Camilla—she was gone!</P>
<P>Attracted by her wish to see more of Mrs. Arl∣bery,
she had run out of the shop after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionel, before
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he either kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w what was reading, or was missed by
those the reader had eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged. Edgar, though dis∣appointed,
wondered he should have stayed himself
to listen to what had long been familiar to him, and
was quietly gliding away when he saw her returning.
He then went back to his po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, wondering, with still
less satisfaction, how she could absent herself from
hearing what so well was worth her studying.</P>
<P>The young man, when he came to the concluding
line:</P>
<Q>To seenes where love and l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iss immertal reign!</Q>
<P>rose, let fall the book, clasped his hands with a thea∣trical
air, and was casting his eyes upwards in a fer∣vent
and willing trance, when he perceived Indiana
standing immediately before him.</P>
<P>Surprised and ashamed, his sublimity suddenly sor∣sook
him; his arms dropt, and his hands were slipt
into his wais<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coat pockets.</P>
<P>But, the very next moment, the sensation of shame
and of self was superseded by the fair object that had
thus aroused him. Her beauty, her youth, her at∣titude
of examination, struck him at first with an
amazement that presently gave place to an admira∣tion
as violent as it was sudden. He started back,
bowed profoundly, without any pretence for bowing
at all, and then rivetting his eyes, in which his whole
soul seemed centred, on her lovely face, stood view∣ing
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
her with a look of homage, motionless, yet en∣raptured.</P>
<P>Indiana, still conceiving this to be some sort of
acting, unabashed kept her post, expecting every
moment he would begin spouting something more.
But the enthusiasm of the young Oxonian had
changed its object; the charms of poetry yielded to
the superior charms of beauty, and while he gazed
on the fair Indiana, his ferv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt mind sancied her
some being of celestial order, wonderfully accorded
to his view: How, or for what purpose, he as little
knew as cared. The play of imagination, in the
romance of early youth, is rarely interrupted with
scruples of probability.</P>
<P>This scene of dumb transport and unfixed expecta∣tion,
was broken up neither by the admirer nor the ad∣mired,
but by the entrance of Mrs. Arlbery, Sir Sedley
Clarendel, Lionel, the officers, and many of the rest of
the company that had been present at the public break∣fast:
Nor would even this intrusion have disengaged the
young Oxonian from his devout and extatic adora∣tion,
had it been equally indifferent to Indiana; but
the appearance of a party of gay officers was not, to
her, a matter of little moment. Eager for the no∣tice
in which she delighted, she looked round in full
confidence of receiving it. The rapture of the
Oxonian, as she had seen it kindled while he was
reading, she attributed to something she did not un∣derstand,
and took in it, therefore, no part; but
the adulation of the officers was by no means am∣biguous,
and its acceptance was as obvious as its
presentation.</P>
<P>Willingly, therefore, as well as immediately en∣compassed,
she received a thousand compliments, and
in the gratification of hearing them, completely for∣got
her late short surprise; but the Oxonian, more
forcibly struck, ardently followed her with his eyes,
started back theatrically at every change of attitude
which displayed her fine figure, and at her smiles
smiled again, from the uncontrollable sympathy of a
fascinated imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="121"/>
Miss Margland felt no small pride in seeing her
pupil thus distinguished, since it marked the shrewd∣ness
of her capacity in foretelling the effect of bring∣ing
her forth. Anxious to share in a consequence
to which she had industriously contributed, she para∣dingly
forced her way through the group, and calling
the attentiion of Indiana to herself, said: “I am glad
you came away, my dear; for I am sure that man is
only a poor strolling player.”</P>
<P>“Dear! let me look at him again!” cried In∣diana;
“for I never saw a player before; only at a
play.”</P>
<P>She then turned back to examine him.</P>
<P>Enchanted to again meet her eyes, the youth
bowed with intense respect, and advanced a few paces,
as if with intentiion to speak to her, though imme∣diately
and with still more precipitance he retreated,
from being ready with nothing to say.</P>
<P>Lionel, going up to him, and pulling him by the
arm, cried: “Why, man! what's come to you?
These are worse heroics than I have seen you in yet.”</P>
<P>The bright eyes of Indiana being still fixed upon
him, he disdained all notice of Lionel, beyond a
silent repulse.</P>
<P>Indiana, having now satisfied her curiosity, re∣stored
her attention to the beaux that surrounded her.
The Oxonian, half sighing, unfolded his clasped
hands, one of which he reposed upon the shoulder of
Lionel.</P>
<P>“Come, prithee, be a little less in alt,” cried
Lionel, “and answer a man when he speaks to you.
Where did you leave Smythson?”</P>
<P>“Who is that divinity; can you tell me?” said
the Oxonian in a low and respectful tone of inquiry.</P>
<P>“What divinity?”</P>
<P>“What divinity? insensible Tyrold! tasteless!
adamantine! Look, look yonder, and ask me again
if you can!”</P>
<P>“O what; my cousin Indiana?”</P>
<P>“Your cousin? have you any affinity with such a
creature as that? O Tyrold! I glory in your ac∣quaintance!
<PB N="123" REF="122"/>
she is all I ever read of! all I ever con∣ceived!
she is beauty in its very essence! she is ele∣gance,
delicacy, and sensibility personisied!”</P>
<P>“All very true,” said Lionel; “but how should
you know any thing of her besides her beauty?”</P>
<P>“How? by looking at her! Can you view that
countenance and ask me how? Are not those eyes all
soul? Does not that mouth promise every thing that
is intelligent? Can those lips ever move but to dif∣fuse
sweetness and smiles? I must not look at her
again! another glance may set me raving!”</P>
<P>“May?” cried Lionel, laughing; “why what
have you been doing all this time? However, be a
little less in the sublime, and I'll introduce you to
her.”</P>
<P>“Is it possible? shall I owe to you so cel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stial
a happiness? O Tyrold! you bind me to you for
life!”</P>
<P>Lionel, heartily hallowing, then brought him for∣ward
to Indiana: “Miss Lynmere,” he cried, “a
fellow student of mine, though somewhat more given
to study than your poor cousin, most humbly begs
the honour of kissing your toe.”</P>
<P>The uncommon lowness of the bow which the
Oxonian, ignorant of what Lionel would say, was
making, led Miss Margland to imagine he was really
going to perform that popish ceremony; and hastily
pulling Lionel by the sleeve, she angrily said: “Mr.
Lionel, I desire to know by whose authority you
present such actor-men to a young lady under my
care.”</P>
<P>Lionel, almost in convulsions, repeated this aloud;
and the young student, who had just, in a voice of
the deepest interest and respect, begun, “The high
honour, madam;” hearing an universal laugh from
the company, stopt short, utterly disconeerted, and
after a few vainly stammering attempts, bowed again,
and was silent.</P>
<P>Edgar, who in this distress, read an ingenuousness
of nature that counterpoised its romantic enthusiasm,
felt for the young man, and taking Lionel by the
<PB N="123" REF="123"/>
arm, said: “Will you not introduce me also to your
friend?”</P>
<P>“Mr. Melmond of Brazen Nose! Mr. Mandle∣bert
of Beech Park!” cried Lionel, flourishing, and
bowing from one to the other.</P>
<P>Edgar shook hands with the youth, and hoped
they should be better acquainted.</P>
<P>Camilla, gliding round, whispered him: “How
like my dear father was that! to give relief to em∣barrassment,
instead of joining in the laugh which
excites it!”</P>
<P>Edgar, touched by a comparison to the person he
most honoured, gratefully looked his acknowledg∣ment;
and all displeasure at her flight, even from
Thomson's seene of conjugal felicity, was crased
from his mind.</P>
<P>The company grew impatient for the rassle,
though some of the subscribers were not arrived.
It was voted, at the proposition of Mrs. Arlbery,
that the master of the shop should represent, as their
turns came round, those who were absent.</P>
<P>While this was settling, Edgar, in some confu∣sion,
drew Camilla to the door, saying: “To avoid
any perplexity about your throwing, suppose you step
into the haberdasher's shop that is over the way?”</P>
<P>Camilla, who already had felt very awkward with
respect to her withdrawn subscription, gladly agreed
to the proposal, and begging him to explain the
matter to Miss Margland, tript across the street,
while the rafflers were crowding to the point of
action.</P>
<P>Here she sat, making some small purchases, till
the business was over: The whole party then came
forth into the street, and all in a body poured into
the haberdasher's shop, smiling, bowing, and of one
accord wishing her joy.</P>
<P>Concluding this to be in derision of her desertion,
she rallied as well as she was able; but Mrs. Arl∣bery,
who entered the last, and held the locket in
her hand, said: “Miss Tyrold, I heartily wish you
equally brilliant success, in the next, and far more
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
dangerous lottery, in which, I presume, you will
try your fate.” And presented her the prize.</P>
<P>Camilla, colouring, laughing, and unwillingly
taking it, said: “I suppose, ma'am—I hope—it is
yours?” And she looked about for Edgar to assist
her; but, he was gone to hasten the carriage.</P>
<P>Every body crowded round her to take a last
sight of the beautiful locket. Eager to get rid of it,
she put it into the hands of Indiana, who regarded
it with a partiality which her numerous admirers had
courted, individually, in vain; though the young
Oxonian, by his dramatic emotions, had engaged
more of her attention than she had yet bestowed
elsewhere. Eugenia too, caught by his eccentri∣city,
was powerfully impelled to watch and admire
him; and not the less, in the unenvying innocency
of her heart, for his evident predilection in favour of
her cousin. This youth was not, however, suffered
to engross her; the stranger by whom she had al∣ready
been distinguished at the ball and public break∣fast,
was one in the group, and resumed a claim
upon her notice, too slattering in its manner to be
repulsed, and too new to her extreme inexperience
to be obtrusive.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Camilla gathered from Major Cer∣wood,
that the prize had really fallen to her lot.
Edgar had excused her not staying to throw for her∣self,
but the general proxy, the bookseller, had been
successful in her name.</P>
<P>In great perplexity how to account for this inci∣dent,
she apprehended Edgar had made some mis∣take,
and determined, through his means, to restore
the locket to the subscription.</P>
<P>The carriage of Mrs. Arlbery was first ready;
but, pushing away the throng of beaux offering as∣sistance,
she went up to Camilla, and said; “Fair
object of the spleen of all around, will you bring a
little of your influence with good fortune to my do∣main,
and come and dine with me?”</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="125"/>
Delighted at the proposal, Camilla looked at Miss
Margland; but Miss Margland, not being included
in the invitation, frowned a refusal.</P>
<P>Edgar now entered and announced the coach of
Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>“Make use of it as you can,” said Mrs. Arl∣bery;
“there is room for one more to go back than
it brought; so pray do the honours prettily. Cla∣rendel!
take care of Miss Tyrold to my coach.”</P>
<P>Sir Sedley smiled, and played with his watch
chain, but did not move.</P>
<P>“O you laziest of all lazy wretchee!” cried Mrs.
Arlbery</P>
<P>“I shall reverse the epithet, and be the alertest
of the alert,” said Major Corwood; “if the com∣mission
may be devolved to myself.”</P>
<P>“Positively not for the world! there is nothing
so pleasant as working the indolent; except, indeed,
making the restless keep quiet; so, come forth, Cla∣rendel!
be civil, and strike us all with astonishment!”</P>
<P>“My adored Mrs. Arlbery!” cried he, (hoist∣ing
himself upon the shop counter, and swinging a
switch to and fro, with a languid motion,) your
maxims are all of the first superlative, except this;
but nobody's civil now, you know: 'tis a sogramity
quite out.'”</P>
<P>“So you absolutely won't stir, then?”</P>
<P>“O pray! pray!” answered he, putting on his
hat and folding his arms, “a little mercy! 'tis so
vastly insufferably hot! Calcutta must be in the
frigid zone to this shop! a very ice-house!”</P>
<P>Camilla, who never imagined rudeness could make
a feature of affectation, internally attributed this re∣fusal
to his pique that she had disregarded him at the
public breakfast, and would have made him some
apology, but knew not in what manner to word it.</P>
<P>The Major again came forward, but Miss Mar∣gland,
advancing also, said: “ Miss Camilla! you
won't think of dining out unknown to Sir Hugh?”</P>
<P>“I am sure,” cried Mrs. Arlbery, “you will
have the goodness to speak for me to Sir Hugh.”
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
Then, turning to Lionel, “Mr. Tyrold,” she added,
you must go with us, that you may conduct your
sister safe home Don't be affronted; I shall invite
you for your own sake another time. Come, you
abominable Clarendel! awake! and give a little
spring to our motions.”</P>
<P>“You are most incommodiously cruel!” answer∣ed
he; “but I am bound to be your slave.” Then
calling to one of the apprentices in the shop; “My
vastly good boy,” he cried “do you want to see me
irrecoverably subdued by this immensely inhuman
heat?”</P>
<P>The boy stared; and said, “Sir.”</P>
<P>“If not, do get me a glass of water.”</P>
<P>“O worse and worse!” said Mrs. Arlbery;
“your whims are insupportable. I give you up!
Major! advance.”</P>
<P>The Major, with alacrity, offered his hand; Ca∣milla
hesitated; she wished passionately to go, yet
felt she had no authority for such a measure. The
name, though not the person of Mrs. Arlbery, was
known both at Cleves and at Etherington, as be∣longing
to the owner of a capital house in the neigh∣bourhood;
and though the invitation was without
form, Camilla was too young to be with-held by ce∣remony.
Her uncle, she was sure, could refuse her
nothing; and she thought, as she was only a visitor
at Cleves, Miss Margland had no right to control
her; the pleasure, therefore, of the scheme, soon
conquered every smaller difficulty, and, looking away
from her party, she suffered herself to be led to the
coach.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, as she passed, said aloud: “Re∣member!
I give no consent to this!”</P>
<P>But Eugenia, on the other side, whispered:
“Don't be uneasy; I will explain to my uncle how
it all happened.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was following, when Indiana ex∣claimed:
“Cousin Camilla, what am I to do with
your locket?”</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="127"/>
Camilla had wholly forgotten it; she called to
Edgar, who slowly, and with a seriousness very un∣usual,
obeyed her summons.</P>
<P>“There has been some great mistake,” said she,
“about the locket. I suppose they neglected to
scratch out my name from the subscription; for
Major Cerwood says it really came to me. Will you
be so good as to return it to the bookseller?”</P>
<P>The gravity of Edgar immediately vanished:
“Are you so ready,” he said, “even when it is in
your possession, to part with so pretty a trinket?”</P>
<P>“You know it cannot be mine, for here is my
half guinea.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery then got into the coach; but Ca∣milla,
still farther recollecting herself, again called
to Edgar, and holding out the half guinea, said:
“How shall I get this to the poor people?”</P>
<P>“They were to come,” he answered, “to Cleves
this afternoon.”</P>
<P>“Will you, then, give it them for me?”</P>
<P>“No commission to Mr. Mandlebert!” inter∣rupted
Mrs. Arlbery; “for he must positively dine
with us.”</P>
<P>Mandlebert bowed a pleased assent, and Camilla
applied to Eugenia; but Miss Margland, in deep
wrath, refused to let her move a step.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery then ordered the coach to drive
home. Camilla, begging a moment'▪ delay, desired
Edgar to approach nearer, and said, in a low voice,
“I cannot bear to let those poor expectants toll so
far for nothing. I will sooner go back to Cleves
myself. I shall not sleep all night if I disappoint
them. Pray, invent some excuse for me.”</P>
<P>“If you have set your heart upon this visit,” an∣swered
Mandlebert, with vivacity, though in a whis∣per,
“I will ride over myself to Cleves, and arrange
all to your wishes; but if not, certainly there can
need no invention, to decline an invitation of which
Sir Hugh has no knowledge.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who at the beginning of this speech felt
the highest glee, sunk involuntarily at its conclusion,
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
and turning with a blank countenance to Mrs. Arl∣bery,
stammeringly said; “Can you, will you—be
so very good, as not to take it ill if I don't go with
you?”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, surprised, very coldly answered:
“Certainly not! I would be no restraint upon you.
I hate restraint myself.” She then ordered the foot∣man
to open the door; and Camilla, too much
abashed to offer any apology, was handed out by
Edgar.</P>
<P>“Amiable Camilla!” said he, in conducting her
back to Miss Margland, “this is a self-conquest that
I alone, perhaps, expected from you!”</P>
<P>Cheared by such approbation, she forgot her dis∣appointment,
and regardless of Miss Margland and
her ill humour, jumped into her uncle's coach, and
was the gayest of the party that returned to Cleves.</P>
<P>Edgar took the locket from Indiana, and promised
to rectify the mistake; and then, lest Mrs. Arlbery
should be offended with them all, rode to her house
without any fresh invitation, accompanied by Lionel;
whose anger against Camilla, for suffering Miss Mar∣gland
to gain a victory, was his theme the whole
ride.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Baru.</HEAD>
<P>THE first care of Camilla was to interest Sir Hugh
in the misfortunes of the prisoner and his family;
her next, to relate the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery,
and to beg permission that she might wait upon that
lady the next morning, with apologies for her abrupt
retreat, and with acknowledgments for the services
done to the poor woman; which first the Oxonian,
and then the raffle, had driven from her mind. Sir
Hugh readily consented, blaming her for supposing
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
it possible he could ever hesitate in what could give
her any pleasure.</P>
<P>Before the tea-party broke up, Edgar returned.
He told Camilla he had stolen away the instant din∣ner
was over, to avoid any mistake about the poor
people, whom he had just overtaken by the park∣gate,
and conducted to the great barn, where he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ected them to wait for orders.</P>
<P>“I'll run to them immediately,” cried she, “for
my half guin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a is in an agony to be gone!”</P>
<P>“The barn! my dear young Mr. Mandlebert!”
exclaimed Sir Hugh; “and why did you not bring
them to the servants' hall? My little girl has been
telling me all their history; and, God forbid, I should
turn hard-hearted, because of their wanting a leg of
mutton, in preference to being starved; though they
might have no great right to it, according to the
forms of law; which, however, is not much impedi∣ment
to the calls of nature, when a man sees a but∣cher's
stall well covered, and has got nothing within
him, except his own poor craving appetite; which
is a thing I always take into consideration; though,
God forbid, I should protect a thief, no man's pro∣perty
being another's, whether he's poor or rich.”</P>
<P>He then gave Camilla three guineas to deliver to
them from himself, to set them a little a-going in an
honest way, that they might not, he said, repent
leaving off bad actions. Her joy was so excessive,
that she passionately embraced his knees: and Edgar,
while he looked on, could nearly have bent to her his
own, with admiration of her generous nature. Eu∣genia
desired to accompany her; and Indiana, rising
also, said: “Dear! I wonder how they will look
in the barn! I should like to see them too.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland made no opposition, and they set
out.</P>
<P>Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetness that
mocked all equality, ran into the barn, and saw the
whole party, according to their several powers, en∣joying
themselves. The poor man, stretched upon
straw, was resting his aching limbs; his wife, by his
<PB N="130" REF="130"/>
side, was giving nourishment to her baby; and the
other child, a little boy of three years old, was
jumping and turning head over heels, with the true
glee of unspoilt nature, superior to poverty and
distress.</P>
<P>To the gay heart of Camilla whatever was sportive
was attractive; she flew to the little fellow, whose
skin was clean and bright, in the midst of his rags
and wretchedness, and, making herself his play∣mate,
bid the woman finish feeding her child, told
the man to repose himself undisturbed, and began
dancing with the little boy, not less delighted than
himself at the festive exercise.</P>
<P>Miss Margland cast up her hands and eyes as she
entered, and poured forth a warm remonstrance
against so demeaning a condescension: but Camilla,
in whose composition pride had no share, though
spirit was a principal ingredient, danced on unheed∣ing,
to the equal amaze and enchantment of the poor
man and woman, at the honour done to their little
son.</P>
<P>Edgar came in last; he had given his arm to Eu∣genia,
who was always in the rear if unassisted. Miss
Margland appealed to him upon the impropriety of
the behaviour of Camilla, adding, “If I had had
the bringing up a young lady who could so degrade
herself, I protest I should blush to show my face: but
you cannot, I am sure, fail remarking the difference
of Miss Lynmere's conduct.”</P>
<P>Edgar attended with an air of complacency, which
he thought due to the situation of Miss Margland in
the family, yet kept his eyes fixt upon Camilla, with
an expression that, to the last discernment, would
have evinced his utmost approbation of her innocent
gaiety: but Miss Margland was amongst that nu∣merous
tribe, who, content as well as occupied with
making observations upon others, have neither the
power, nor thought, of developing those that are re∣turned
upon themselves.</P>
<P>Camilla at length, wholly out of breath, gave
over; but perceiving that the baby was no longer at
<PB N="131" REF="131"/>
its mother's breast, flew to the poor woman, and,
taking the child in her arms, said: “Come, I can
nurse and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est at the same time; I assure you the
baby will be safe with me, for I nurse all the children
in our neighbourhood.” She then fondled the poor
little half-starved child to her bosom, quieting, and
kissing, and cooing over it.</P>
<P>Miss Margland was still more incensed; but Edgar
could attend to her no longer. Charmed with the
youthful nurse, and seeing in her unaffected attitudes,
a thousand graces he had never before remarked, and
reading in her fondness for children the genuine
sweetness of her character, he could not bear to
have the pleasing reflections revolving in his mind in∣terrupted
by the spleen of Miss Margland, and, slip∣ping
away, posted himself behind the baby's father,
where he could look on undisturbed; certain it was a
vicinity to which Miss Margland would not follow
him.</P>
<P>Had this scene lasted till Camilla was tired, its
period would not have been very short; but Miss
Margland, finding her exhortations vain, suddenly
called out: “Miss Lynmere! Miss Eugenia! come
away directly! It's ten to one but these people have
all got the gaol distemper!”</P>
<P>Edgar, quick as lightning at this sound, flew to
Camilla, and snatched the child from her arms. In∣diana,
with a scream, ran out of the barn; Miss
Margland hurried after; and Eugenia, following,
earnestly intreated Camilla not to stay another mo∣ment.</P>
<P>“And what is there to be alarmed at?” cried she;
“I always nurse poor children when I see them at
home; and my father never prohibits me.”</P>
<P>“There may be some reason, however,” said
Edgar, while still he tenderly held the baby himself,
“for the present apprehension: I beg you, there∣fore,
to hasten away.”</P>
<P>“At least,” said she, “before I depart, let me
execute my commission.” And then, with the kindest
good wishes for their better fortune, she put her
<PB N="132" REF="132"/>
uncle's three guineas into the hands of the poor man,
and her own rescued half guinea into those of his
wife: and, desiring Edgar not to remain himself
where he would not suffer her to stay, ran to give her
arm to Eugenia; leaving it a doubtful point, whether
the good humour accompanying her alms, made the
most pleased impression upon their receivers, or upon
their observer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Declaration.</HEAD>
<P>AT night, while they were enjoying the bright
beams of the moon, from an apartment in the front
of the house, they observed a strange footman, in a
superb livery, ride towards the servants hall; and
presently a letter was delivered to Miss Margland.</P>
<P>She opened it with an air of exulting consequence;
one which was inclosed, she put into her pocket, and
read the other three or four times over, with looks
of importance and complacency. She then pomp∣ously
demanded a private audience with Sir Hugh,
and the young party left the room.</P>
<P>“Well, Sir!” she cried, proudly, “you may
now see if I judged right as to taking the young
ladies a little into the world. Please to look at this
letter, Sir:”</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Miss Margland, at Sir Hugh Tyrold's, Bart.
Cleves, Hampshire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the most profound respect I presume to ad∣dress
you, though only upon the strength of that
marked politeness which shines forth in your deport∣ment.
I have the highest ambition to offer a few
lines to the perusal of Miss Eugenia Tyrold, previous
<PB N="133" REF="133"/>
to presenting myself to Sir Hugh. My reasons will
be contained in the letter which I take the liberty to
put into your hands. It is only under your pro∣tection,
madam, I can aim at approaching that
young lady, as all that I have either seen or heard
convinces me of her extraordinary happiness in being
under your direction. Your influence, madam, I
should therefore esteem as an honour, and I leave it
wholly to your own choice, whether to read what I
have addressed to that young lady before or after she
has deigned to cast an eye upon it herself. I remain,
with the most profound respect,</P>
<CLOSER>Madam,
your most obedient,
and obliged servant,
<SIGNED>ALPHONSO BELLAMY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I shall take the liberty to send my servant for an
answer to-morrow evening.</P>
<P>“This, Sir,” continued Miss Margland, when
Sir Hugh had read the letter; “this is the exact
conduct of a gentleman; all open, all respectful. No
attempt at any clandestine intercourse. All is ad∣dressed
where it ought to be, to the person most pro∣per
to superintend such an affair. This is that very
same gentleman whose politeness I mentioned to you,
and who danced with Miss Eugenia at Northwick,
when nobody else took any notice of her. This
is—”</P>
<P>“Why then this is one of the most untoward
things,” cried Sir Hugh, who, vainly waiting for a
pause, began to speak without one, “that has ever
come to bear; for where's the use of Eugenia's mak∣ing
poor young fellows fall in love with her for no∣thing?
which I hold to be a pity, provided it's sin∣cere,
which I take for granted.”</P>
<P>“As to that, Sir, I can't say I see the reason why
Miss Eugenia should not be allowed to look about
her, and have some choice; especially as the young
gentleman abroad has no fortune; at least none an∣swerable
to her expectations.”</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="134"/>
“But that's the very reason for my marrying them
together. For as he has not had the small-pox him∣self,
that is, not in the natural way; which, Lord
help me! I thought the best, owing to my want of
knowledge; why he'll the more readily excuse her
face not being one of the prettiest, for her kindness
in putting up with his having so little money; being
a thing some people think a good deal of.”</P>
<P>“But, Sir, won't it be very hard upon poor Miss
Eugenia, if a better offer should come, that she must
not listen to it, only because of a person she has never
seen, though he has no estate?”</P>
<P>“Mrs. Margland,” said Sir Hugh, (with some
heat,) “this is the very thing that I would sooner
have given a crown than have had happen! Who
knows but Eugenia may take a fancy to this young
jackanapes? who, for aught I know, may be as good
a man as another, for which I beg his pardon; but,
as he is nothing to me, and my nephew's my nephew,
why▪ am I to have the best scheme I ever made
knocked on the head, for a person I had as lieve were
twitched into the Red-Sea? which, however, is a
thing I should not say, being what I would not do.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland took from her pocket the letter de∣signed
for Eugenia, and was going to break the seal;
but Sir Hugh, preventing her, said: “No, Miss
Margland; Eugenia shall read her own letters. I
have not had her taught all this time, by one of the
first scholars of the age, as far as I can tell, to put
that affront upon her.”</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and sent for Eugenia.</P>
<P>Miss Margland stated the utter impropriety of suf∣fering
any young lady to read a letter of that sort,
till proposals had been laid before her parents and
guardians. But Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hugh spoke no more till Eu∣genia
appeared.</P>
<P>“My dear,” he then said, “here is a letter just
come to put your education to the trial; which, I
make no doubt, will stand the test properly: there∣fore,
in regard to the answer, you shall write it all
yourself, being qualified in a manner to which I have
<PB N="135" REF="135"/>
no right to pretend; though I shall go to-morrow to
my brother, which will give me a better insight; his
head being one of the best.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, greatly surprised, opened the letter, and
read it with visible emotion.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, and what do you say to it?”</P>
<P>Without answering, she read it again.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh repeated the question.</P>
<P>“Indeed, Sir,” said she, (in a tone of sadness,)
“it is something that afflicts me very much!”</P>
<P>“Lord help us!” cried Sir Hugh, “this comes
of going to a ball! which, begging Miss Margland's
pardon, is the last time it shall be done.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland was beginning a vehement defence
of herself; but Sir Hugh interrupted it, by desiring
to see the letter.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with increased confusion. folded it up,
and said: “Indeed, Sir—Indeed, uncle—it is a very
improper letter for me to shew.”</P>
<P>“Well, that,” cried Miss Margland, “is a thing
I could never have imagined! that a gentleman, who
is so much the gentleman, should write an improper
letter!”</P>
<P>“No, no,” interrupted she, “not improper—
perhaps—for him to write—but for me to exhibit.”</P>
<P>“O, if that's all, my dear,” said Sir Hugh, “if
it's only because of a few compliments, I beg you
not to mind them, because of their having no mean∣ing;
which is a thing common enough in the way of
making love, by what I hear; though such a young
thing as you can know nothing of the matter, your
learning not going in that line; nor Dr. Orkborne's
neither, if one may judge; which, God forbid I
should find fault with, being no business of mine.”</P>

ashamed to refuse, gave it, and went out of

<HEAD>To Miss Eugenia Tyrold, Cleves.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE delicacy of your highly cultivated mind awes
even the violent passion which you inspire. And to
this I intreat you to attribute the trembling fear
which deters me from the honour of waiting upon
Sir Hugh, while uncertain, if my addressing him
might not raise your displeasure. I forbear, there∣fore,
to lay before him my pretensions for soliciting
your favour, from the deepest apprehension you might
think I presumed too far, upon an acquaintance, to
my unhappiness, so short; yet, as I feel it to have
excited in me the most lasting attachment, from my
fixed admiration of your virtues and talents, I cannot
endure to run the risk of incurring your aversion.
Allow me then, once more, under the sanction of
that excellent lady in whose care I have had the ho∣nour
of seeing you, to entreat one moment's audience,
that I may be graced with your own commands about
waiting upon Sir Hugh, without which, I should
hold myself ungenerous and unworthy to approach
him; since I should blush to throw myself at your
feet from an authority which you do not permit. I
beseech you, madam, to remember, that I shall be
miserable till I know my doom; but still, that the
heart, not the hand, can alone bestow happiness on a
disinterested mind.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,
Madam,
your most devoted
and obedient humble servant,

</LETTER>
<P>Sir Hugh, when he had finished the letter, heaved
a sigh, and leant his head upon his hand, considering
whether or not to let it be seen by Miss Margland;
who, however, not feeling secure what his deter∣mination
might be, had so contrived to sit at the
table as to read it at the same time with himself. Nor
had she weighed the interest of her curiosity amiss;
<PB N="137" REF="137"/>
Sir Hugh, dreading a debate with her, soon put the
letter into his pocket-book, and again sent for Eu∣genia.</P>
<P>Eugenia excused herself from returning, pleaded
a head-ache, and went to bed.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was in the deepest alarm; though the
evening was far advanced, he could scarce refrain
from going to Etherington directly; he ordered his
carriage to be at the door at eight o'clock the next
morning; and sent a second order, a moment after,
that it should not be later than half past seven.</P>
<P>He then summoned Camilla, and, giving her the
letter, bid her run with it to her sister, for fear it was
that she was fretting for. And soon after, he went
to bed that he might be ready in the morning.</P>
<P>Eugenia, meanwhile, felt the placid composure of
her mind now for the first time shaken. The assi∣duities
of this young man had already pleased and
interested her; but, though gratified by them in
his presence, they occurred to her no more in his
absence. With the Oxonian she had been far more
struck; his energy, his sentiments, his passion for
literature, would instantly have riveted him in her
fairest favour, had she not so completely regarded
herself as the wife of Clermont Lynmere, that she
denied her imagination any power over her reason.</P>
<P>This letter, however, filled her with sensations
wholly new. She now first reflected seriously upon
the nature of her situation with regard to Clermont,
for whom she seemed bespoke by her uncle, without
the smallest knowledge how they might approve or
suit each other. Perhaps he might dislike her; she
must then have the mortification of being refused:
perhaps he might excite her own antipathy; she
must then either disappoint her uncle, or become a
miserable sacrifice.</P>
<P>Here, on the contrary, she conceived herself an
elected object. The difference of being accepted,
or being chosen, worked forcibly upon her mind;
and, all that was delicate, feminine, or dignified in
her notions, rose in favour of him who sought, when
<PB N="138" REF="138"/>
opposed to him who could only consent to receive
her. Generous, too, he appeared to her, in for∣bearing
to apply to Sir Hugh, without her permis∣sion:
disinterested, in declaring he did not wish for
her hand without her heart; and noble, in not seek∣ing
her in a clandestine manner, but referring every
thing to Miss Margland.</P>
<P>The idea also of exciting an ardent passion, lost
none of its force from its novelty to her expectations.
It was not that she had hitherto supposed it impos∣sible;
she had done less; she had not thought of it
at all. Nor came it now with any triumph to her
modest and unassuming mind; all it brought with it
was gratitude towards B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llamy, and a something
soothing towards herself, which, though inexplica∣ble
to her reason, was irresistible to her feelings.</P>
<P>When Camilla entered with the letter, she bash∣fully
asked her, if she wished to read it? Camilla
eagerly cried: “O, yes.” But, having finished
it, said: “It is not such a letter as Edgar Mandle∣bert
would have written.”</P>
<P>“I am sure, then,” said Eugenia, colouring,
“I am sorry to have received it.”</P>
<P>“Do you not observe every day,” said Camilla,
“the distance, the delicacy of his behaviour to In∣diana,
though Miss Margland says their marriage is
fixed; how free from all distinction that might con∣fuse
her? This declaration, on the contrary, is so
abrupt—and from so new an acquaintance—”</P>
<P>“Certainly, then, I won't answer it,” said Eu∣genia,
much discomposed; “it had not struck me
thus at first reading; but I see now all its im∣propriety.”</P>
<P>She then bid good night to Camilla; who, con∣cluding
her the appropriated wife of Clermont, had
uttered her opinion without scruple.</P>
<P>Eugenia now again read the letter; but not again
with pleasure. She thought it forward and pre∣sumptuous:
and the only gratification that remained
upon her mind, was an half conscious, scarce ad∣mitted,
and, even to herself, unacknowledged
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
charm, in a belief, that the possessed the power to
inspire an animated regard.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Answer.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and Mrs. Tyrold and Lavinia were at break∣fast
when Sir Hugh entered their parlour, the next
morning. “Brother,” he cried, “I have something
of great importance to tell you, which it is very fit
my sister should hear too; for which reason, I make
no doubt but my dear Lavinia's good sense will leave
the room without waiting for a hint.”</P>
<P>Lavinia instantly retired.</P>
<P>“O, my dear brother,” continued the baronet;
“do you know here's a young chap, who appears to
be a rather good sort of man, which is so much the
worse, who has been falling in love with Eugenia?”</P>
<P>He then delivered the two letters to Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>“Now the only thing that hurts me in this bu∣siness
is, that this young man, who Miss Margland
calls a person of fashion, writes as well as Clermont
would do himself; though that is what I shall never
own to Eugenia, which I hope is no sin, being all
for her own sake; that is to say, for Clermont's.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, after attentively reading the letters,
gave them to his wife, and made many inquiries con∣cerning
their writer, and his acquaintance with Eu∣genia
and Miss Margland.</P>
<P>“Why it was all brought about,” said Sir Hugh,
“by their going to a ball and a public breakfast;
which is a thing my little Camilla is not at all to
blame for, because if nobody had put it in her head,
she would not have known there was a thing of the
kind. And, indeed, it was but natural in poor
Lionel neither, to set her agog, the chief fault lying
in the assizes; to which my particular objection is
<PB N="140" REF="140"/>
against the lawyers, who come into a town to hang
and transport the poor, by way of keeping the peace,
and then encourage the rich to make all the noise and
riot they can, by their own junkettings; for which,
however, being generally, I believe, pretty good
scholars, I make no doubt but they have their own
reasons.”</P>
<P>“I flatter myself,” said Mrs. Tyrold, scarce
deigning to finish the letters, “Eugenia, young as she
is, will need no counsel how to estimate a writer such
as this. What must the man be, who, presuming
upon his personal influence, ventures to claim her
concurrence in an application to her friends, though
he has seen her but twice, and knows her to be des∣titute
of the smallest knowledge of his principles, his
character, or his situation in life?”</P>
<P>“Good lack!” cried the baronet, “what a pro∣digious
poor head I must have! here I could hardly
sleep all night, for thinking what a fine letter this
jackanapes, which I shall make no more apology for
calling him, had been writing, fearing it would cut
up poor Clermont in her opinion, for all his grand
tour.”</P>
<P>Perfectly restored to ease, he now bad them good
morning; but Mr. Tyrold intreated him to stay till
they had settled how to get rid of the business.</P>
<P>“My dear brother,” he answered, “I want no
more help now, since I have got your opinion, that
is, my sister's, which I take it for granted is the same.
I make no doubt but Eugenia will pretty near have
writ her foul copy by the time I get home, which
Dr. Orkborne may overlook for her, to the end that
this Mr. Upstart may have no more fault to find
against it.”</P>
<P>They both desired to dine at Cleves, that they
might speak themselves with Eugenia.</P>
<P>“And how,” said Mr. Tyrold, with a strong se∣cret
emotion, “how goes on Edgar with Indiana?”</P>
<P>“Vastly well, vastly well indeed! not that I pre∣tend
to speak for myself, being rather too dull
in these matters, owing to never entering upon them
<PB N="141" REF="141"/>
in the right season, as I intend to tell other young
men doing the same.”</P>
<P>He then, in warm terms, narrated the accounts
given him by Miss Margland of the security of the
conquest of Indiana.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold fixed his hour for expecting the car∣riage,
and the baronet desired that Lavinia should
be of the party; “because,” he said, “I see she
has the proper discretion, when she is wanted to go
out of the way; which must be the same with Ca∣milla
and Indiana, too, to-day, as well as with young
Mr. Edgar; for I don't think it prudent to trust
such new beginners with every thing that goes on,
till they get a little older.”</P>
<P>The anxiety of Mr. Tyrold, concerning Bellamy,
was now mingled with a cruel regret in relation to
Mandlebert. Even his own upright conduct could
scarce console him for the loss of his favourite hope,
and he almost repented that he had not been more
active in endeavouring to preserve it.</P>
<P>All that passed in his mind was read and partici∣pated
in by his faithful partner, whose displeasure
was greater, though her mortification could but be
equal. “That Edgar,” said she, “should have kept
his heart wholly untouched, would less have moved
my wonder; he has a peculiar, though unconscious
delicacy in his nature, which results not from inso∣lence
nor presumption, but from his own invariable
and familiar exercise of every virtue and of every
duty: the smallest deviation is offensive, and even
the least inaccuracy is painful to him. Was it possible,
then, to be prepared for such an election as this?
He has disgraced my expectations; he has played
the common part of a mere common young man,
whose eye is his sole governor.”</P>
<P>“My Georgina,” said Mr. Tyrold, “I am deeply
disappointed. Our two eldest girls are but slightly
provided for; and Eugenia is far more dangerously
circumstanced, in standing so conspicuously apart, as
a prize to some adventurer. One of these three pre∣cious
cares I had fondly concluded certain of pro∣tection
<PB N="142" REF="142"/>
and happiness; for which ever I might have
bestowed upon Edgar Mandlebert, I should have
considered as the most fortunate of her sex. Let us,
however, rejoice for Indiana; no one can more need
a protector; and, next to my own three gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, there
is no one for whom I am so much interested. I grieve,
however, for Edgar himself, whose excellent judgment
will, in time, assert its rights, though passion, at this
period, has set it aside.”</P>
<P>“I am too angry with him for pity,” said Mrs.
Tyrold; “nor is his understanding of a class that
has any claim to such lenity: I had often thought
our gentle Lavinia almost born to be his wife, and no
one could more truly have deserved him. But the
soft perfection of her character relieves me from any
apprehension for her conduct, and almost all my so∣licitude
devolves upon Camilla. For our poor Eu∣genia
I had never indulged a hope of his choice;
though that valuable, unfortunate girl, with every
unearned defect about her, intrinsically merits him,
with all his advantages, his accomplishments, and his
virtnes: but to appreciate her, uninfluenced by pe∣cuniary
views, to which he is every way superior, was
too much to expect from so young a man. My
wishes, therefore, had guided him to our Camilla,
that sweet, open, generous, inconsiderate girl, whose
feelings are all virtues, but whose impulses have no
restraints: I have not a fear for her, when she can
act with deliberation; but fear is almost all I have
left, when I consider her as led by the start of the
moment. With him, however, she would have been
the safest, and with him—next alone to her mother,
the happiest of her sex.”</P>
<P>The kindest acknowledgments repaid this sym∣pathy
of sentiment, and they agreed that their felicity
would have been almost too complete for this lower
world, if such an event had come to pass. “Never∣theless
its failure,” added Mrs. Tyrold, “is almost
incredible, and wholly unpardonable. That Indiana
should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anquish where Lavinia and Camilla have
<PB N="143" REF="143"/>
failed! I feel indignant at such a triumph of mere
external unintelligent beauty.”</P>
<P>Eugenia received her parents with the most bash∣ful
confusion; yet they found, upon conversing with
her, it was merely from youthful shame, and not
from any dangerous prepossession. The observations
of Camilla had broken that spell with which a first
declaration of regard is apt to entangle unreflecting
inexperience; and by teaching her to less value the
votary, had made the conquest less an object of satis∣faction.
She was gratified by the permission of her
uncle to write her own answer, which was now pro∣duced.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who delighted to see how completely,
in her studies with Dr. Orkborne, she had escaped any
pedantry or affectation, and even preserved all the
native humility of her artless character, returned her
the letter with an affectionate embrace, and told her
he could desire no alteration but that of omitting the
word <HI>grateful</HI> at the conclusion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold was far less satisfied. She wished it
to be completely re-written; protesting, that a man
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
who, in all probability, was a mere fortune-hunter,
would infer from so gentle a dismission encouragement
rather than repulse.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh said there was one thing only he de∣sired
to have added, which was a hint of a pre∣engagement
with a relation of her own.</P>
<P>Eugenia, at this, coloured and retreated; and
Mrs. Tyrold reminded the baronet, with some dis∣pleasure,
of his promise to guard the secret of his
project. Sir Hugh, a little disturbed, said it never
broke out from him but by accident, which he would
take care should never get the upper hand again. He
would not, however, consent to have the letter al∣tered,
which he said would be an assront to the learn∣ing
of Eugenia, unless it were done by Dr. Ork∣borne
himself, who, being her master, had a right to
correct her first penmanship.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, being called upon, slightly glanced
his eye over the letter, but made no emendation,
saying: “I believe it will do very sufficiently; but
I have only concerned myself with the progress of
Miss Eugenia in the Greek and Latin languages;
any body can teach her English.”</P>
<P>The fond parents finished their visit in full satis∣faction
with their irreproachable Eugenia, and with
the joy of seeing their darling Camilla as happy and
as disengaged as when she had left them; but Man∣dlebert
had spent the day abroad, and escaped, there∣fore,
the observations with which they had meant to
have investigated his sentiments. Indiana, with
whom they conversed more than usual, and with the
most scrutinizing attention, offered nothing either in
manner or matter or rescue his decision from their
censure: Mrs. Tyrold, therefore, rejoiced at his ab∣sence,
lest a coolness she knew not how to repress,
should have led him to surmise her disappointment.
Her husband besought her to be guarded: “We
had no right,” he said, “to the disposal of his
heart: and Indiana, however he may find her in∣adequate
to his future expectations, will not disgrace
his present choice. She is beautiful, she is young,
<PB N="145" REF="145"/>
and she is innocent; this in early life is sufficient for
felicity; and Edgar is yet too new in the world to
be aware how much of life remains when youth is
gone, and too unpractised to foresee, that beauty
loses its power even before it loses its charms, and
that the season of declining nature sighs deeply for
the support which sympathy and intelligence can
alone bestow.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Explication.</HEAD>
<P>THE visit which Camilla had designed this morn∣ing
to Mrs. Arlbery, she had been induced to relin∣quish
through a speech made to her by Lionel. “You
have done for yourself, now!” said he, exultingly;
“so you may be governed by that scare-crow, Miss
Margland, at your leisure. Do you know you were
not once mentioned again at the Grove, neither by
Mrs. Arlbery nor any body else? and they all agreed
Indiana was the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l girl in the world.”</P>
<P>Camilla, though of the same opinion with respect
to Indiana, concluded Mrs. Arlbery was offended by
her retreat, and lost all courage for offering any
apology.</P>
<P>Edgar did not return to Cleves till some time after
the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, when he met
Miss Margland and the young ladies strolling in the
park.</P>
<P>Camilla, running to meet him, asked if he had re∣stored
the locket to the right owner.</P>
<P>“No,” answered he, smiling, “not yet.”</P>
<P>“What can be done then? my half guinea is
gone; and, to confess the truth, I have no another
I can well spare!”</P>
<P>He made no immediate reply; but after speaking
to the rest of the party, walked on towards the house.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="146"/>
Camilla, in some perplexity, following him, ex∣claimed:
“Pray tell me what I must do? indeed I
am quite uneasy.”</P>
<P>“You would really have me give the locket to its
rightful proprietor?”</P>
<P>“To be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure I would!”</P>
<P>“My commission, then, is soon executed.” And
taking a little t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>green case from his waistcoat pocket,
he put it into her hand.</P>
<P>“What can you mean? is there still any mistake?”</P>
<P>“None but what you may immediately rectify,
by simply retaining your own prize.”</P>
<P>Camilla, opening the case, saw the locket, and
perceived under the crystal a light knot of braided
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air. But while she looked at it, he hurried into
the house.</P>
<P>She ran after him, and insisted upon an explanation,
declaring it to be utterly impossible that the locket
and the half guinea should belong to the same person.</P>
<P>“You must not then,” he said, “be angry, if
you find I have managed, at last, but aukwardly.
When I came to the library, the master of the
ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le told me it was against all rule to refund a sub∣scription.”
He stopt.</P>
<P>“The half guinea you put into my hand, then,”
cried she, colouring, “was your own?”</P>
<P>“My dear Miss Camilla, there is no other occa∣sion
upon which I would have hazarded such a li∣berty;
but as the money was for a charity, and as I
had undertaken what I could not perform, I rather
ventured to replace it, than suffer the poor objects for
whom it was destined, to miss your kind intention.”</P>
<P>“You have certainly done right,” said she (feel∣ing
for her purse); “but you must not, for that
reason, make me a second time do wrong.”</P>
<P>“You will not so much hurt me?” replied he,
gravely; “you will not reprove me as if I were a
stranger, a mere common acquaintance? Where
could the money have been so well bestowed? It is
not you, but those poor people who are in my debt.
So many were the chances against your gaining the
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
prize, that it was an event I had not even taken into
consideration: I had merely induced you to leave
the snop, that you might not have the surprise of
sinding your name was not withdrawn; the rest was
accident; and surely you will not punish me that I
have paid to the poor the penalty of my own ill
weighed offi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iousness?”</P>
<P>Camilla put up her purse, but, with some spirit,
said: “There is another way to settle the matter
which cannot hurt you; if I do not pay you my
half guinea, you must at least keep the fruits of your
own.” And she returned him the locket.</P>
<P>“And what,” cried he, laughing, “must I do
with it? would you have me wear it myself?”</P>
<P>“Give it,” answered she, innocently, “to In∣diana.”</P>
<P>“No;” replied <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he, (reddening and putting it
down upon a table,) but <HI>you</HI> may, if you believe her
value will be greater than your own for the hair of
your two sisters.”</P>
<P>Camilla, surprised, again looked at it, and recog∣nized
the hair of Lavinia and Eugenia.</P>
<P>“And how in the world did you get this hair?”</P>
<P>“I told them both the accident that had hap∣pened,
and begged them to contribute their assist∣ance
to obtain your pardon.”</P>
<P>“Is it possible,” cried she, with vivacity, “you
could add to all your trouble so kind a thought?”
and, without a moment's further hesitation, she ac∣cepted
the prize, returning him the most animated
thanks, and flying to Eugenia to inquire further into
the matter, and then to her uncle, to shew him her
new acquisition.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, like herself, immediately said: “But
why did he not give it to Indiana?”</P>
<P>“I suppose,” said Eugenia, “because Camilla had
herself drawn the prize, and he had only added one
hair to it.”</P>
<P>This perfectly satisfied the baronet; but Indiana
could by no means understand why it had not been
managed better; and Miss Margland, with much ill
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
will, nourished a private opinion that the prize might
perhaps have been her own, had not Mandlebert in∣terfered.
However, as there seemed some collusion
which she could not develope, her conscience wholly
acquitted her of any necessity to refund her bor∣rowed
half guinea.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, decorated herself with the
locket, and had nothing in her possession which gave
her equal delight.</P>
<P>Miss Margland now became, internally, less san∣guine,
with regard to the preference of Edgar for
Indiana; but she concealed from Sir Hugh a doubt
so unpleasant, through an unconquerable repugnance
to acknowledge it possible she could have formed a
wrong judgment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Panic.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the ensuing Sunday, Edgar proposed that
a party should be made to visit a new little cottage,
which he had just sitted up. This was agreed to;
and as it was not above a mile from the parish church,
Sir Hugh ordered that his low garden phacton should
be in readiness, after the service, to convey himself
and Eugenia thither. The rest, as the weather was
fine, desired to walk.</P>
<P>They went to the church, as usual, in a coach and
a chaise, which were dismissed as soon as they alight∣ed:
but before that period, Eugenia, with a sigh,
had observed, that Melmond, the young Oxonian,
was strolling the same way, and had seen, with a blus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
that Bellamy was by his side.</P>
<P>The two gentlemen recognised them as they were
crossing the church-yard. The Oxonian bowed pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundly,
but stood aloof: Bellamy bowed also, but
immediately approached; and as Sir Hugh, at that
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
moment, accidentally let fall his stick, darted for∣ward
to recover and present it him.</P>
<P>The baronet, from surprise at his quick motion,
dropt his handkerchief in receiving his cane; this
also Bellamy, attentively shaking, restored to him:
and Sir Hugh, who could accept no civility unre∣quited,
said: “Sir, if you are a stranger, as I
imagine, not knowing your face, you are welcome
to a place in my pew, provided you don't get a seat
in a better; which I'm pretty much afraid you can't,
mine being the best.”</P>
<P>The invitation was promptly accepted.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, always happy to be of conse∣quence,
was hastening to Sir Hugh to put him upon
his guard; when a respectful offer from Bellamy to
assist her down the steps, induced her to remit her
design to a future opportunity. Any attentions
from a young man were now so new to her as to
seem a call upon her gratitude; nor had her charms
ever been so attractive as to render them common.</P>
<P>Edgar and Indiana, knowing nothing of his late
declaration, thought nothing of his present admis∣sion;
to Dr. Orkborne he was an utter stranger;
but Camilla had recourse to her fan to conceal a
smile; and Eugenia was in the utmost confusion.
She felt at a loss how to meet his eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated
herself as much as possible out of his way.</P>
<P>A few minutes after, looking up towards the gal∣lery,
she perceived, in one of the fur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hest rows,
young Melmond; his eyes sixt upon their pew, but
withdrawn the instant he was observed, and his air
the most melancholy and dejected.</P>
<P>Again a half sigh escaped the tender Eugenia.
How delicate, how elegant, thought she, is this re∣tired
behaviour! what resinement results from a true
literary taste! O such be Clermont! if he resemble
not this Oxonian—I must be wretched for life!</P>
<P>These ideas, which unavoidably, though unwil∣lingly,
interrupted her devotion, were again broken
in upon, when the service was nearly over, by the
appearance of Lionel. He had ridden five miles to
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
join them, merely not to be thought in leading∣strings,
by staying at Etherington to hear his father:
though the name and the excellence of the preach∣ing
of Mr. Tyrold, attracted to his church all
strangers who had power to reach it:—so vehement
in early youth is the eagerness to appear independant,
and so general is the belief that all merit must be
fou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> from a distance.</P>
<P>The deeper understanding of Mandlebert ren∣dered
him superior to this common puerility: and,
though the preacher at Cleves church was his own
tutor, Dr. Marchmont, from whom he was scarce
yet emancipated, he listened to him with reverence,
and would have travelled any distance, and taken
cheerfully any trouble, that would in the best and
strongest manner have marked the respect with which
he attended to his doctrine.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont was a man of the highest intel∣lectual
accomplishments, uniting deep learning with
general knowledge, and the graceful exterior of a
man of the world, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rudition and science of
a fellow of a coll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge. He obtained the esteem of the
scholar where<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he was known, and caught the appro∣bation
of the most uncultivated wherever he was seen.</P>
<P>When the se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce was over, Edgar proposed that
Dr. Marchmont should join the party to the cottage.
Sir Hugh was most willing, and they sauntered
about the church, while the Doctor retired to the
vestry to take off his gown.</P>
<P>During this interval, Eugenia, who had a passion
for reading epitapha and inscriptions, became so in∣tently
engaged in decyphering some old verses on an
antique tablet, that she perceived not when Dr.
Marchmont was ready, nor when the party was leav∣ing
the church: and before any of the rest missed
her, Bellamy suddenly took the opportunity of her
being out of sight of all others, to drop on one knee,
and passionately seize her hand, exclaiming: “O
madam!—” When hearing an approaching step, he
hastily arose; but parted not with her hand till he
had pressed it to his lips.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="151"/>
The astonished Eugenia, though at first all emo∣tion,
was completely recovered by this action. His
kneeling and his “O madam!” had every chance
to affect her; but his kissing her hand she thought a
liberty the most unpardonable. She resented it as an
injury to Clermont, that would risk his life should
he ever know it, and a blot to her own delicacy, as
irreparable as it was irrem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diable▪</P>
<P>Bellamy, who, from her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ett<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, had augured
nothing of hardness of heart, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed her
forgiveness; but she made him no answer: silent
and offended she walked away, and, losing her ti∣midity
in her displeasure, went up to her uncle, and
whispered: “Sir, the gentleman you invited into
your pew, is Mr. Bellamy!”</P>
<P>The consternation of Sir Hugh was extreme: he
had concluded him a stranger to the whole party be∣cause
a stranger to himself; and the discovery of
his mistake made him next conclude, that he had
risked a breach of the marriage he so much desired
by his own indiseretion. He took Eugenia imme∣diately
under his arm, as if fearful she might else be
conveyed away for Scotland before his eyes, and
hurrying to the church porch, called aloud for his
phaeton.</P>
<P>The phaeton was not arrived.</P>
<P>Still more dismayed, he walked on with Eugenia
to the railing round the church yard, motioning with
hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> left hand that no one should follow.</P>
<P>Edgar, Lionel, and Bellamy marched to the road,
listening for the sound of horses, but they heard
none; and the carriages of the neighbouring gentry,
from which they might have hoped any assistance,
had been driven away while they had waited for Dr.
Marchmont.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the eyes of Eugenia again caught the
young Oxonian, who was wandering around the
church-yard: neither was he unobserved by Indiana,
who, though she participated not in the turn of rea∣soning,
or taste for the romantic, which awakened
in Eugenia so forcible a sympathy, was yet highly
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
gratified by his apparent devotion to her charms:
and had not Miss Margland narrowly watched and
tutored her, would easily have been attracted from
the cold civilities of Edgar, to the magnetism of
animated admiration.</P>
<P>In these circumstances, a few minutes appeared
many hours to Sir Hugh, and he presently exclaim∣ed:
“There's no possibility of waiting here the
whole day long, not knowing what may be the end!”
Then, calling to Dr. Orkborne, he said to him in
a low voice, “My good friend, here's happened a
sad thing: that young man I asked into my pew,
for which I take proper shame to myself, is the same
person that wanted to make Eugenia give up Cler∣mont
Lynme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, her own natural relation, and mine
into the bargain, for the sake of a stranger to us all;
which I hold to be rather uncommendable, consider∣ing
we know nothing about him; though there's no
denying his being handsome enough to look at;
which, however, is no certainty of his making a
good husband; so I'll tell you a mode I've thought
of, which I think to be a pretty good one, for part∣ing
them out of hand.”</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who had just taken out his tablets,
in order to enter some hints relative to his great
work, begged him to say no more till he had finish∣ed
his sentence. The bar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t looked much distressed,
but consented: and when he had done, went on:</P>
<P>“Why, if you will hold Eugenia, I'll go up to
the rest, and send them on to the cottage; and when
they are gone. I shall get rid of this young chap,
by telling him E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>genia and I want to be alone.”</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne assented; and Sir Hugh, advanc∣ing
to the group, made his proposition, adding:
“Eugenia and I will overtake you as soon as the
garden-chair comes, which, I dare say, won't be
long, Robert being so behind-hand already.” Then,
turning to Bellamy, “I am sorry, Sir,” he said,
“I can't possibly ask you to stay with us, because of
something my little niece and I have got to talk
about, which we had rather nobody should hear,
<PB N="153" REF="153"/>
being an affair of our own: but I thank you for
your civility, Sir, in picking up my stick and my
pocket handkerchief, and I wish you a very good
morning and a pleasant walk, which I hope. you
won't take ill.”</P>
<P>Bellamy bowed, and, saying he by no means in∣tended
to intrude himself into the company, slowly
drew back.</P>
<P>Edgar then pointed out a path through the fields
that would considerably abridge the walk, if the la∣dies
could manage to cross over a dirty lane on the
other side of the church-yard.</P>
<P>The baronet, who was in high spirits at the suc∣cess
of his scheme, declared that if there was a short
cut, they should not part company, for he could
walk it himself. Edgar assured him it could not be
more than half a mile, and offered him the use of
his arm.</P>
<P>“No, no, my good young friend,” answered he,
smiling significantly: “take care of Indiana! I have
got a good stick, which I hold to be worth any arm
in Christendom, except for not being alive; so take
care of Indiana, I say.”</P>
<P>Edgar bowed, but with a silence and gravity not
unmixt with surprise; and Sir Hugh, a little struck,
hastily added, “Nay, nay, I mean no harm!”</P>
<P>“No, Sir,” said Edgar, recovering, “you can
mean nothing but good, when you give me so fair a
charge.” And he placed himself at the side of In∣diana.</P>
<P>“Well then, now,” cried Sir Hugh, I'll marshal
you all: and, first, for my little Camilla, who shall
come to my proper share; for she's certainly the best
companion of the whole; which I hope nobody will
take for a slight, all of us not being the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with∣out
any fault of our own. Dr. Orkborne shall keep
to Eugenia, because, if there should be a want of
conversation, they can go over some of their lessons.
Lionel shall take the care of Mrs. Margland, it being
always right for the young to help people a little
stricken; and as for the odd one, Dr. Marchmont,
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
why he may join little Camilla and me; for as she's
none of the steadiest, and I am none of the strongest,
it is but fair the one over should be between us.”</P>
<P>Every body professed obedience but Lionel; who,
with a loud laugh, called to Edgar to change partners.</P>
<P>“We are all under orders,” answered he, quietly,
“and I must not be the first to mutiny.”</P>
<P>Indiana smiled with triumph; but Miss Margland,
firing with anger, declared she wanted no help, and
would accept none.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was now beginning an expostulation with
his nephew; but Lionel preferred compliance to
hearing it; yet, to obviate the ridicule which he was
persuaded would follow such an acquiescence, he
strided up to Miss Margland with hasty steps, and
dropping on one knee, in the dust, seized and kissed
her hand; but precipitately rising, and shaking him∣self,
called out: “My dear ma'am, have you never
a little cloaths-brush in your pocket? I can't kneel
again else!”</P>
<P>Miss Margland wrathfully turned from him; and
the party proceeded to a small gate, at the back of
the church, that opened to the lane mentioend by
Edgar, over which, when the rest of the company
had passed, into a beautiful meadow, Lionel offered
his hand for conducting Miss Margland, who rejected
it disdainfully.</P>
<P>“Then, you will be sure to fall,” said he.</P>
<P>“Not unless you do something to make me.”</P>
<P>“You will be sure to fall,” he repeated coolly.</P>
<P>Much alarmed, she protested she would not get
over before him.</P>
<P>He absolutely refused to go first.</P>
<P>The whole party s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opt; and Bellamy, who had
hitherto stood still and back, now ventured to ap∣proach,
and in the most courteous manner, to offer
his services to Miss Margland. She looked victo∣riously
around her; but as he had spoken in a low
voice, only said: “Sir?” to make him repeat his
proposal more audibly. He complied, and the im∣pertinencies
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
of Lionel rendered his civility irresisti∣ble:
“I am glad,” she cried, “there is still one
gentleman left in the world!” And accepted his
assistance, though her persecutor whispered that her
spark was a dead man! and strutted significantly away.</P>
<P>Half frightened, half suspecting she was laughed
at, she repeated softly to Sir Hugh the menace of
his nephew, begging that, to prevent mischief, she
might still retain Bellamy.</P>
<P>“Lord be good unto me!” cried he, “what
amazing fools the boys of now a days are grown!
with all their learning, and teaching, and classics at
their tongue's end for nothing! However, not to
set them together by the ears, till they grow a little
wiser, which, I take it, won't be of one while,
why you must e'en let this strange gentleman walk
with you till t'other boy's further off. However,
this one thing pray mind! (lowering his voice,)
keep him all to yourself! if he does but so much as
look at Eugenia, give him to understand it's a thing
I sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n't take very kind of him.”</P>
<P>Beckoning then to Dr. Orkborne, he uneasily
said: “As I am now obliged to have that young
fellow along with us, for the sake of preventing an
affray, about nobody knows what, which is the com∣mon
reason of quarrels among those raw young fry,
I beg you to keep a particular sharp look out, that
he does not take the opportunity to run off with
Eugenia.”</P>
<P>The spirit of the baronet had over-rated his
strength; and he was forced to sit upon the lower
step of a broad stile at the other end of the mea∣dow:
while Miss Margland, who leant her tall thin
figure against a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive-barred gate, willingly obviated
his solicitude about Eugenia, by keeping Bellamy
in close and unabating conference with herself.</P>
<P>A circumstance in the seenery before him now
struck Dr. Orkborne with some resemblance to a
ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of Virgi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Eclogues, which he thought
might be happily applied to illustrate a passage in his
own work; taking out, therefore, his tablets, he
<PB N="156" REF="156"/>
begged Eugenia not to move, and wrote his quota∣tion;
which, leading him on to some reflections
upon the subject, soon drove his charge from his
thoughts, and consigned him solely to his pencil.</P>
<P>Eugenia willingly kept her place at his side; of∣fended
by Bellamy, she would give him no chance of
speaking with her, and the protection under which
her uncle had placed her she deemed sacred.</P>
<P>Here they remained but a short time, when their
ears received the shock of a prodigious roar from a
bull in the field adjoining. Miss Margland screamed,
and hid her face with her hands. Indiana, taught
by her lessons to nourish every fear as becoming,
shri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kt still louder, and ran swiftly away, deaf to
all that Edgar, who attended her, could urge. Eu∣genia,
to whom Bellamy instantly hastened, seeing
the beast furiously make towards the gate, almost
unconsciously accepted his assistance, to accelerate
her flight from its vicinity; while Dr. Orkborne,
intent upon his annotations, calmly wrote on, sen∣sible
there was some disturbance, but determining to
evade inquiring whence it arose, till he had secured
what he meant to transmit to posterity from the
treachery of his memory.</P>
<P>Camilla, the least frightened, because the most
enured to such sounds, from the habits and the in∣struction
of her rural life and education, adhered
firmly to Sir Hugh, who began blessing himself with
some alarm; but whom Dr. Marchmont re-assured,
by saying the gate was secured, and too high for the
bull to leap, even supposing it a vicious animal.</P>
<P>The first panic was still in its meridian, when
Lionel, rushing past the beast, which he had secretly
been tormenting, skipt over the gate, with every ap∣pearance
of terror, and called out: “Save your∣selves
all! Miss Margland in particular; for here's
a mad bull!”</P>
<P>A second astounding bellow put a stop to any ques∣tion,
and wholly checked the immediate impulse of
Miss Margland to ask why she was thus selected;
she snatched her hands from her face, not doubting
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
she should see her esquire soothingly standing by her
side; but, though internally surprised and shocked
to find herself deserted, she gathered strength to run
from the gate with the nimbleness of youth, and,
flying to the stile, regardless of Sir Hugh, and for∣getting
all her charges, scrambled over it, and ran
on from the noise, without looking to the right or
the left.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, whom Lionel'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> information, and Miss
Margland's pushing past him, had extremely ter∣rified,
was now also getting over the stile, with the
assistance of Dr. Marchmont, ejaculating; “Lord
help us! what a poor race we are! No safety for us!
if we only come out once in a dozen years, we must
meet with a mad bull!”</P>
<P>He had, however, insisted that Camilla should
jump over first, saying, “There's no need of all of
us being tost, my dear girl, because of my slowness,
which is no fault of mine, but of Robert's not being
in the way; which must needs make the poor fellow
unhappy enough, when he hears of it: which, no
doubt, I shall let him do, according to his deserts.”</P>
<P>The other side of the stile brought them to the
high road. Lionel, who had only wished to torment
Miss Margland, felt his heart smite him, when he
saw the fright of his uncle, and flew to acquaint
him that he had made a mistake, for the bull was
only angry, not mad.</P>
<P>The unsuspicious baronet thanked him for this
good news, and sat upon a bank till the party could
be collected.</P>
<P>This, however, was not soon to be done; the dis∣persion
from the meadow having been made in every
possible direction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Lovers.</HEAD>
<P>INDIANA, intent upon running on, had nearly
reached the church-yard, without hearkening to one
word of the expostulating Mandlebert; when, lean∣ing
over a tombstone, on which she had herself leant
while waiting for the carriage, she perceived the
young Oxonian. An instinctive spirit of coquetry
made her now increase her pace; he heard the rust∣ling
of a female approach, and looked up; her
beauty, heightened by her flight, which animated
her complexion, while it displayed her fine form,
seemed more than ever celestial to the enamoured stu∣dent;
who darted forward from an impulse of irre∣sistible
surprise. “O Heaven!” she cried, panting
and stopping as he met her; “I shall die! I shall
die!—I am pursued by a mad bull!”</P>
<P>Edgar would have explained, that all was safe;
but Melmond neither heard nor saw him—“O, give
me, then,” he cried, emphatically; “give me the
extacy to protect—to save you!”</P>
<P>His out-spread arms shewed his intention to bear
her away; but Edgar, placing himself between them,
said: “Pardon me, Sir! this lady is under my care!”</P>
<P>“O don't sight about me! don't quarrel!”
cried Indiana, with an apprehension half simple,
half affected.</P>
<P>“No, Madam!” answered Melmond, respect∣fully
retreating; “I know too—too well! my little
claim in such a dispute!—Permit me, however, to
assist you, Mr. Mandlebert, in your search of refuge;
and deign, madam, to endure me in your sight, till
this alarm passes away.”</P>
<P>Indiana, by no means insensible to this language,
looked with som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> elation at Edgar, to see how he
bore it.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="159"/>
Edgar was not surprised; he had already observed
the potent impression made by the beauty of In∣diana
upon the Oxonian; and was struck, in defiance
of its romance and suddenness, with its air of sin∣cerity;
he only, therefore, gently answered, that
there was not the least cause of fear.”</P>
<P>“O, how can you say so?” said Indiana; “how
can you take so little interest in me?”</P>
<P>“At least, at least,” cried Melmond, trembling
with eagerness, “condescend to accept a double
guard!—Refuse not, Mr. Mandlebert, to suffer my
attendance!”</P>
<P>Mandlebert, a little embarrassed, answered; “I
have no authority to decide for Miss Lynmere; but,
certainly, I see no occasion for any assistance.”</P>
<P>Melmond fervently clasped his hands, and ex∣claimed:
“Do not, do not, madam, command me
to leave you till all danger is over!”</P>
<P>The little heart of Indiana beat high with tri∣umph;
she thought Mandlebert jealous: Miss Mar∣gland
had often told her there was no su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er way to
quicken him: and, even independently of this idea,
the spirit, the ardour, the admiration of the Oxonian,
had a power upon her mind that needed no auxiliary
for delighting it.</P>
<P>She curtsied her consent; but declared she would
never go back the same way. They proceeded,
therefore, by a little round to the high road, which
led to the field in which the party had been dispersed.</P>
<P>Indiana was full of starts, little shricks, and pal∣pitations;
every one of which rendered her, in the
eyes of the Oxonian, more and more captivating;
and, while Edgar walked gravely on, reflecting, with
some uneasiness, upon being thus drawn in to suffer
the attendance of a youth so nearly a stranger, upon
a young lady actually under his protection; Mel∣mond
was continually ejaculating in return to her
perpetual apprehensions, “What lovely timidity!—
What bewitching softness!—What seminine, what
beautiful delicacy!—How sweet in terror!—How
soul-pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in alarm!”</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160"/>
These exclamations were nearly enchanting to In∣diana,
whose only fear was, lest they should not be
heard by Edgar; and, whenever they ceased, when∣ever
a pau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and respectful silence took their place,
new starts, fresh palpitations, and designed false steps,
again called them forth; while the smile with which
she repaid their enthusiastic speaker, was fuel to his
flame, but poison to his peace.</P>
<P>They had not proceeded far, when they were met
by Miss Margland, who, in equal trepidation from
anger and from fear, was still making the best of her
way from the bellowing of the bull. Edgar inquired
for Sir Hugh, and the rest of the party; but she
could speak only of Lionel; his insolence and his
ill usage; protesting nothing but her regard for In∣diana,
could induce her to live a moment longer
under his uncle's roof.</P>
<P>“But where,” again cried Edgar, “where is
Sir Hugh? and where are the ladies?”</P>
<P>“Tossed by the bull,” answered she, pettishly,
“for aught I know; I did not choose to stay and
be tossed myself; and a person like Mr. Lionel can
soon make such a beast point at one, if he takes it
into his humour.”</P>
<P>Edgar then begged they might hasten to their
company; but Miss Margland positively refused to
go back: and Indiana, always ready to second any
alarm, declared, she should quite sink with fright,
if they went within an hundred yards of that horrid
field. Edgar still pleaded that the baronet would
expect them; but Melmond, in softer tones, spoke
of fears, sensibility, and dangers; and Edgar soon
found he was talking to the winds.</P>
<P>All now that remained to prevent further sepa∣ration
was, that Edgar should run on to the party,
and acquaint them that Miss Margland and Indiana
would wait for them upon the high road.</P>
<P>Melmond, meanwhile, felt in paradise; even the
presence of Miss Margland could not restrain his
rapture, upon a casualty that gave him such a charge,
though it forced him to forbear making the direct
<PB N="161" REF="161"/>
and open declaration of his passion, with which his
heart was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning, and his tongue quivering. He
attended them both with the most fervent respect,
evidently very gratifying to the object of his adora∣tion,
though not noticed by Miss Margland, who
was wholly absorbed by her own provocations.</P>
<P>Edgar soon reached the bank by the road's side,
upon which the baro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, Dr. Marchmont, Lionel,
and Camilla were s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted. “Lord help us!” ex∣claimed
Sir Hugh, aghast at his approach, “if here
is not young Mr. Edgar without Indiana! This is a
thing I could never have expected from you, young
Mr. Edgar! that you should leave her, I don't know
where, and come without her!”</P>
<P>Edgar assured him she was saf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and under the
care of Miss Margland, but that neither of them
could be prevailed with to come farther: he had,
therefore, advanced to inquire after the rest of the
party, and to arrange where they should all assemble.</P>
<P>“You have done very right, then, my dear, Mr.
Edgar, as you always do, as far as I can make out,
when I come to the bottom. And now I am quite
easy about Indiana. But as to Eugenia, what Dr.
Orkborne has done with her is more than I can de∣vise;
unless, indeed, they are got to studying some
of their Greek verbs, and so forgot us all, which is
likely enough; only I had rather they had taken an∣other
time, not much caring to stay here longer than
I can help.”</P>
<P>Edgar said▪ he would make a circuit in search of
them; but, first, addressing Camilla, “You alone,”
he cried, with an approving smile, “have remained
thus quiet, while all else have been scampering apart,
making <HI>confusion worse confounded.</HI>”</P>
<P>“I have lived too completely in the country to
be afraid of cattle,” she answered; “and Dr. march∣mont
assured me there was no danger.”</P>
<P>“You can listen, then, even when you are alarm∣ed,”
said he, expressively, “to the voice of reason!”</P>
<P>Camilla raised her eyes, and looked at him, but
dropt them again without making any answer: Can
<PB N="162" REF="162"/>
<HI>you,</HI> she thought, have been pleading it in vain? How
I wonder at Indiana?</P>
<P>He then set out to seek Eugenia, recommending
the same office to Lionel by another route; but
Lionel no sooner gathered where Miss Margland
might be met with, than his repentance was for∣gotten,
and he quitted every thing to encounter her.</P>
<P>Edgar spent near half an hour in his search, with∣out
the smallest success: he was then seriously uneasy,
and returning to the party, when a countryman, to
whom he was known, told him he had seen Miss Eu∣genia
Tyrold, with a very handsome fine town gen∣tleman,
going into a farm house.</P>
<P>Edgar flew to the spot, and through a window, as
he advanced, perceived Eugenia seated, and Bellamy
kneeling before her.</P>
<P>Amazed and concerned, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e abruptly made his
way into the apartment. Bellamy rose in the utmost
confusion, and Eugenia, starting and colouring,
caught Edgar by the arm, but could not speak.</P>
<P>He told her that her uncle and the whole company
were waiting for her in great anxiety.</P>
<P>“And where, where,” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed she, “are they? I
have been in agonies about them all! and I could not
prevail—I could not—this gentleman said the risk
was so great—he would not suffer me—but he has
sent for a chaise, though I told him I had a thousand
times rather hazard my life amongst them, and with
them, than save it alone!”</P>
<P>“They are all perfectly safe, nor has there ever
been any danger.”</P>
<P>“I was told—I was assured—” said Bellamy,
“that a mad bull was running wild about the coun∣try;
and I thought it, therefore, advisable to send
for a chaise from the nearest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that I might return
this young lady to her friends.”</P>
<P>Edgar made no answer, but offered his arm to
conduct Eugenia to her uncle. She accepted it,
and Bellamy attended on her other side.</P>
<P>Edgar was silent the whole way. The attitude in
which he had surprised Bellamy, by assuring him of
<PB N="163" REF="163"/>
the nature of his pretensions, had awakened doubts
the most alarming of the destination in view for the
chaise which he had ordered; and he believed that
Eugenia was either to have been beguiled, or be∣trayed,
into a journey the most remote from the home
to which she belonged.</P>
<P>Eugenia increased his suspicions by the mere con∣fusion
which deterred her from removing them. Bel∣lamy
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d assured her she was in the most iminent
personal d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urried her from field to
field, with an idea that the dreaded animal was in
full pursuit. When carried, however, into the farm
house, she lost all apprehension for herself in fears for
her friends, and insisted upon sharing their fate. Bel∣lamy,
who immediately ordered a chaise, then cast
himself at her feet, to intreat she would not throw
away her life by so rash a measure.</P>
<P>Exhausted, from her lameness, she was forced to
sit still, and such was their situation at the entrance
of Edgar. She wished extremely to explain what
had been the object of the solicitation of Bellamy,
and to clear him, as well as herself, from any fur∣ther
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnises; but she was ashamed to begin the sub∣ject.
Edgar had seen a man at her feet, and she
thought, herself, it was a cruel injury to Clermont,
though she knew not how to refuse it forgiveness,
since it was merely to supplicate she would save her
own life.</P>
<P>Bellamy, therefore, was the only one who spoke;
and his unanswered observations contributed but little
to enliven the walk.</P>
<P>When they came within sight of the party, the
baronet was again seized with the extremest dismay.
“Why now, what's this?” cried he; “here's no∣thing
but blunders. Pray, Sir, who gave you au∣thority
to take my niece from her own tutor? for so
I may call him, though more properly speaking, he
came amongst us to be mine; which however, is no
affair but of our own”</P>
<P>“Sir,” answered Bellamy, advancing and bowing;
“I hope I have had the happiness of rather doing
<PB N="164" REF="164"/>
service than mischief; I saw the young lady upon
the point of destruction, and I hastened her to a
place of security, from whence I had ordered a post∣chaise,
to convey her safe to your house.”</P>
<P>“Yes, my dear uncle,” said Eugenia, recovering
from her embarrassment; “I have occasioned this
gentleman infinite trouble; and though Mr. Man∣dlebert
assures us there was no real danger, he thought
there was, and therefore I must always hold myself
to be greatly obliged to him.”</P>
<P>“Well, if that's the case, I must be obliged to
him too; which, to tell you the truth, is not a thing
I am remarkably fond of having happened. But
where's Dr. Orkborne? I hope he's come to no
harm, by his not shewing himself?”</P>
<P>“At the moment of terror,” said Eugenia, “I
accepted the first offer of assistance, concluding we
were all hurrying away at the same time; but I saw
Dr. Orkborne no more afterwards.”</P>
<P>“I can't say that was over and above kind of him,
nor careful neither,” cried Sir Hugh, “considering
some particular reasons; however, where is he now?”</P>
<P>Nobody could say; no one had seen or observed
him.</P>
<P>“Why then, ten to one, poor gentleman!” ex∣claimed
the baronet, “but he's the very person him∣self
who's tossed, while we are all of us running away
for nothing!”</P>
<P>A suspicion now occurred to Dr. Marchmont,
which led him to return over the stile into the field
where the confusion had begun; and there, on the
exact spot where he had first taken out his tablets,
calmly stood Dr. Orkborne; looking now upon his
writing, now up to the sky, but seeing nothing any
where, from intense absorption of thought upon the
illustration he was framing.</P>
<P>Awakened from his reverie by the Doctor, his first
recollection was of Eugenia; he had not doubted
her remaining quietly by his side, and the moment
he looked round and missed her, he felt considerable
<PB N="165" REF="165"/>
compunction. The good Doctor, however, assured
him all were safe, and conducted him to the group.</P>
<P>“So here you are,” said the baronet, “and no
more tossed than myself, for which I am sincerely
thankful, though I can't say I think you have taken
much care of my niece, nobody knowing what might
have become of her, if it had not been for that
strange gentleman, that I never saw before.”</P>
<P>He then formally placed Eugenia under the care
of Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, piqued by this transfer, sullenly
followed, and now gave to her, pertinaciously, his
undivided attention. Drawn by a total revulsion of
ideas from the chain of thinking that had led him to
composition, he relinquished his annotations in re∣sentment
of this dismission, when he might have
pursued them uninterruptedly without neglect of
other avocations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Doctors.</HEAD>
<P>A COUNCIL was now held upon what course
must next be taken. Both Sir Hugh and Eugenia
were too much fatigued to walk any further; yet it
was concluded that the garden chair, by some mistake,
was gone straight to the cottage. Edgar, therefore,
proposed running thither to bring it round for them,
while Dr. Orkborne should go forward for Miss
Margland and Indiana, and conduct them by the
high road to the same place; where the whole party
might at length re-assemble. Sir Hugh approved the
plan, and he set off instantly.</P>
<P>But not so Dr. Orkborne; he thought himself
disgraced by being sent from one post to another;
and though Eugenia was nothing to him, in com∣petition
with his tablets and his work, his own in∣structions
<PB N="166" REF="166"/>
had so raised her in his mind, that he
thought her the only female worthy a moment of his
time. Indiana he looked upon with ine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able con∣tempt;
the incapacity she had shewn during the short
time she was under his pupillage, had convinced him
of the futility of her whole sex, from which he held
Eugenia to be a partial exception: and Miss Mar∣gland,
who never spoke to him but in a voice of
haughty superiority, and whom he never answered,
but with an air of solemn super<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ousness, was his
rooted aversion. He could not brook being em∣ployed
in the seivice of either; he stood, therefore,
motionless, till Sir Hugh repeated the proposition.</P>
<P>Not caring to disoblige him, he then, without
speaking, slowly and unwillingly moved forwards.</P>
<P>“I see,” said the baronet, softened rather than
offended, “he does not much like to leave his little
scholar, which is but natural; though I took it ra∣ther
unkind his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tting the poor thing run against the
very horns of the bull, as one may say, if it had
not been for a mere accidental passenger. However,
one must always make allowance for a man that takes
much to his studies, those things generally turning
the head pretty much into a narrow compass.”</P>
<P>He then called after him, and said if the walk
would tire him, he would wait till they came of
themselves, which no doubt they would soon do, as
Lionel was gone for them.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne gladly stopt; but Dr. Marchmont,
seeing little likelihood of a general meeting without
some trouble, offered to take the commission upon
himself, with a politeness that seemed to shew it to
be a wish of his own.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh accepted his kindness with thanks; and
Dr. Orkborne, though secretly disconcerted by such
superior alacrity in so learned a man, was well content
to reinstate himself by the side of his pupil.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who saw the eyes of Bellamy constantly
turned towards Eugenia, thought his presence highly
dangerous, and with much tribulation, said: “As
I find, Sir, we may all have to stay here, I don't
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
know how long. I hope you won't be affronted, after
my best thanks for your keeping my niece from the
bull, if I don't make any particular point of begging
the favour of you to stay much longer with us.”</P>
<P>Bellamy, extremely chagrined, cast an appealing
look at Eugenia, and expressing his regret that his
services were inadmissible, made his retreat with un∣disguised
reluctance.</P>
<P>Eugenia, persuaded she owed him a serious obli∣gation
for his care, as well as for his partiality, felt
the sincerest concern at his apparent distress, and
contributed far more than she intended to its re∣moval,
by the gentle countenance with which she re∣ceived
his sorrowful glance.</P>
<P>Bellamy, hastily overtaking Dr. Marchmont,
darted on before him in search of Miss Margland
and Indiana, who, far from advancing, were pacing
their way back to the church-yard. Lionel had
joined them, and the incensed Miss Margland had
encouraged the glad attendance of the Oxonian, as
a protection to herself.</P>
<P>The sight of Bellamy by no means tended to dis∣perse
the storm: She resented his deserting her while
she was in danger, and desired to see no more of
him. But when he had respectfully suffered her
wrath to vent itself, he made apologies, with an ob∣sequiousness
so rare to her, and a deference so strik∣ingly
contrasted with the daring ridicule of Lionel,
that she did not long oppose the potent charm of
adulation—a charm which, however it may be sweet∣ened
by novelty, seldom loses its effect by any fa∣miliarity.</P>
<P>During these contests, Indiana was left wholly to
young Melmond, and the temptation was too strong
for his impassioned feelings to withstand: “O fairest,”
he cried, “fairest and most beautiful of all created
beings! Can I resist—no! this one, one effusion—
the first and the last! The sensibility of your mind
will plead for me—I read it in those heavenly eyes—
they emit mercy in their beauty! they are as radiant
<PB N="168" REF="168"/>
with goodness as with loveliness! alas! I t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espass—
I blush, and dare not hope your forgiveness.”</P>
<P>He stopt, terrified at his own presumption; but
the looks of Indiana were never more beautiful, and
never less formidable. A milder doom, therefore,
seemed suddenly to burst upon his view. Elated and
enraptured, he vehemently exclaimed: “Oh, were
my lot not irrevocably miserable! were the smallest
ray of light to beam upon my despondence!”</P>
<P>Indiana still spoke not a word, but she withdrew
not her smiles; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he enraptured student, lifted
into the highest bliss by the permission even of a
doubt, walked on, transported, by her side, too
happy in suspence to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h an explanation.</P>
<P>In this manner they proceeded, till they were
joined by Dr. Marchmont. The task he had at∣tempted
was beyond his power of performance; Miss
Margland was inexorable; she declared nothing
should induce her to go a step towards the field in∣habited
by the bull, and every assurance of safety the
Doctor could urge was ineffectual.</P>
<P>He next assailed Indiana; but her first terror,
soothed by the compassion and admiration of Mel∣mond,
was now revived, and she protested, almost
with tears, that to go within an hundred yards of
that dreadful meadow would make her undoubtedly
faint away. The tender commiseration of Melmond
confirmed her apprehensions, and she soon looked
upon Dr. Marchmont as a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>barian for making the
proposal.</P>
<P>The Doctor then commended them to the care of
Lionel, and returned with this repulse to Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>The baronet, incapable of being angry with any
one he conceived to be frightened, said they should
be pressed no more, for he would give up going to
the cottage, and put his best foot forward to walk
on to them himself; adding he was so overjoyed to
have got rid of that young spark, that he had no
fear but that he, and poor Eugenia, too, should both
do as well as they could.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="169"/>
They proceeded very slowly, the baronet leaning
upon Dr. Marchmont, and Eugenia upon Dr. Ork∣borne,
who watchful, with no small alarm, of the
behaviour of the only man he had yet seen with any
internal respect, since he left the university, sacrificed
completely his notes and his tablets to emulate his
attentions.</P>
<P>When they approached the church-yard, in which
Miss Margland and her party had halted, Sir Hugh
perceived Bellamy. He stopt short, calling out, with
extreme chagrin, “Lord help us! what a thing it
is to rejoice! which one never knows the right season
to do, on the score of meeting with disappointments!”</P>
<P>Then, after a little meditation, “There is but one
thing,” he cried, “to be done, which is to guard
from the first against any more mischief, having al∣ready
had enough of it for one morning, not to say
more than I could have wished by half: So do you,
good Dr. Marchmont, take Eugenia under your
own care, and I'll make shift with Dr. Orkborne for
myself; for, in the case he should take again to
writing or thinking, it will be nothing to me to keep
still till he has done; provided it should happen at a
place where I can sit down.”</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne had never felt so deeply hurt; the
same commission transferred to Edgar, or to Lionel,
would have failed to affect him; he considered them
as of an age fitted for such frivolous employment,
which he thought as much below his dignity, as the
young men themselves were beneath his competition:
but the comfort of contempt, a species of consolation
ever ready to offer itself to the impulsive pride of
man, was here an alleviation he could not call to his
aid; the character of Dr. Marchmont stood as high
in erudition as his own; and, though his acquaint∣ance
with him was merely personal, the fame of his
learning, the only attribute to which fame, in his
conception, belonged, had reached him from au∣thority
too unquestionable for doubt. The urbanity,
therefore, of his manners, his general diffusion of
discourse, and his universal complaisance, filled him
<PB N="170" REF="170"/>
with astonishment, and raised an emotion of envy
which no other person would have been deemed wor∣thy
of exciting.</P>
<P>But though his long and fixed residence at Cleves
had now removed the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> circumspection with
which he first sought to ensure his establishment, he
yet would not venture any positive refusal to the ba∣ronet;
he resigned, therefore, his young charge to
his new and formidable opponent, and even exerted
himself to mark some alacrity in assisting Sir Hugh.
But his whole real attention was upon Dr. March∣mont,
whom his eye followed in every motion, to
discover, if possible, by what art unknown he had
acquired such a command over his thoughts and un∣derstanding,
as to bear patiently, nay pleasantly, with
the idle and unequal companions of general society.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont, who was rector of Cleves, had
been introduced to Sir Hugh upon the baronet's
settling in the large mansion-house of that village;
but he had not visited at the house, nor had his com∣pany
been solicited. Sir Hugh, who could never
separate understanding from learning, nor want of
education from folly, concluded that such a man as
Dr. Marchmont must necessarily despise him; and
though the extreme sweetness of his temper made
him draw the conclusion without resentment, it so
effectually prevented all wish of any intercourse, that
they had never conversed together till this morning;
and his surprise, now, at such civilities and good hu∣mour
in so great a scholar, dissered only from that
of Dr. Orkborne, in being accompanied with admi∣ration
instead of envy.</P>
<P>Eugenia thus disposed of, they were proceeding,
when Sir Hugh next observed the young Oxonian:
He was speaking with Indiana, to whom his passionate
devotion was glaring from his looks, air, and whole
manner.</P>
<P>“Lord help me!” exclaimed he; “if there is
not another of these new chaps, that nobody knows
any thing about, talking to Indiana! and, for aught
I can tell to the contrary, making love to her! I
think I never took such a bad walk as this before,
<PB N="171" REF="171"/>
since the hour I was born, in point of unluckiness.
Robert will have enough to answer for, which he
must expect to hear; and indeed I am not much ob∣liged
to Mrs. Margland herself, and so I must needs
tell her, though it is not what I much like to do.”</P>
<P>He then made a sign to Miss Margland to ap∣proach
him: “Miss Margland,” he cried, “I should
not have taken the liberty to beckon you in this man∣ner,
but that I think it right to ask you what those
two young gentlemen, that I never saw before, do in
the church-yard; which is a thing I think rather
odd.”</P>
<P>“As to that gentleman, Sir,” she answered, brid∣ling,
“who was standing by me, he is the only person
I have found to protect me from Mr. Lionel, whose
behaviour, Sir, I must freely tell you—”</P>
<P>“Why certainly, Miss Margland, I can't deny
but he's rather a little over and above giddy; but I
am sure your understanding won't mind it, in con∣sideration
of his being young enough to be your son,
in the case of your having been married time enough.”</P>
<P>He then desired Indiana would come to him.</P>
<P>The rapture of the Oxonian was converted into
torture by this summons; and the suspence which the
moment before he had gilded with the gay colours of
hope, he felt would be no longer supportable when
deprived of the sight of his divinity. Scarce could
he refrain from casting himself publicly at her feet,
and pouring forth the wishes of his heart. But when
again the call was repeated, and he saw her look an∣other
way, as if desirous not to attend to it, the im∣pulse
of quick rising joy dispersed his small remains
of forbearance, and precipitately clasping his hands,
“O go not!” he passionately exclaimed; “leave
me not in this abyss of suffering! Fairest and most
beautiful! tell me at least, if my death is inevitable!
if no time—no constancy—no adoration—may ever
dare hope to penetrate that gentlest of bosoms!”</P>
<P>Indiana herself was now, for the first time, sen∣sible
of a little emotion; the animation of this address
delighted her; it was new, and it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effect was highly
<PB N="172" REF="172"/>
pleasing. How cold, she thought, is Edgar! She
made not any answer, but permitted her eyes to
meet his with the most languishing softness.</P>
<P>Melmond trembled through his whole frame;
despair flew him, and expectation wore her brightest
plumage: “O pronounce but one word,” he cried,
“one single word!—are, are you—O say not yes!
—irrevocably engaged?—lost to all hope—all possi∣bility
for ever?”</P>
<P>Indiana again licensed her fine eyes with their
most melting powers, and all self-control was finally
over with her impassioned lover; who, mingling
prayers for her favour, with adoration of her beauty,
heeded not who heard him, and forgot every pre∣sence
but her own.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, who, engrossed by personal re∣sentment
and debates, had not remarked the rising
courage and energy of Melmond, had just turned to
Indiana, upon the second call of Sir Hugh, and be∣came
now utterly confounded by the sight of her
willing attention; “Miss Lynmere,” cried she, an∣grily,
“what are you thinking of? Suppose Mr.
Mandlebert should come, what might be the conse∣quence?”</P>
<P>“Mandlebert?” repeated Melmond, while the
blood forsook his cheeks; “is it then even so?—is
all over?—all decided? is my destiny black and ire∣ful
for ever?”</P>
<P>Indiana still more and more struck with him,
looked down, internally uttering: “Ah! were this
charming youth but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of Beech Park!”</P>
<P>At this instant, the rapid approach of a carriage
caught their ears; and eager to avoid making a de∣cisive
reply, she ran to the church-yard gate to look
at it, exclaiming: “Dear! what an elegant cha∣riot.”
When it came up to the party, it stopt,
and, opening the door himself, Edgar jumped
hastily out of it.</P>
<P>The Oxonian stood aghast: but Indiana, spring∣ing
forward, and losing in curiosity every other sen∣sation,
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>
cried: “Dear! Mr. Mandlebert, whose
beautiful new carriage is that?”</P>
<P>“Yours,” answered he, gallantly, “if you will
honour it with any commands.”</P>
<P>She then observed his crest and cypher were on
the pannels; and another entire new set of ideas
took instant possession of her mind. She received
literally an answer which he had made in gay courtesy,
and held out her hand to be helped into the chariot.</P>
<P>Edgar, though surprised and even startled at this
unexpected appropriation of his civility, could not
recede; but the moment he had seated her, hastily
turned round, to inquire who else was most fatigued.</P>
<P>The Oxonian now felt lost! suddenly, abruptly,
but irretrievably lost! The cypher he saw—the
question “whose carriage is that?” he heard—the
answer “<HI>yours</HI>” made him gasp for breath, and the
instantaneous acceptance stung him to the soul.
Wholly in desperation, he rushed to the opposite
window of the chariot, and calling out, “Enough,
cruel!—cruel!—enough—I will see you no more!”
hurried out of sight.</P>
<P>Indiana, who, for the first time, thought herself
mistress of a new and elegant equipage, was so
busily employed in examining the trappings and the
lining, that she bore his departure without a sigh;
though but an instant before it might have cost her
something near one.</P>
<P>Eugenia had been touched more deeply. She
was ignorant of what had passed, but she had seen
the agitation of Melmond, and the moment he dis∣appeared,
she ejaculated secretly: “Ah! had he
conceived the prepossession of Bellamy! where had
been my steadiness? where, O Clermont! thy se∣curity!—”</P>
<P>The scrupulous delicacy of her mind was shocked
at this suggestion, and she rejoiced she had not been
put to such a trial.</P>
<P>Edgar now explained, that when he arrived at the
cottage, he found, as he had foreseen, the garden
chair waiting there, by mistake, and Robert in
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
much distress, having just discovered that an accident
had happened to one of the wheels. He had run
on, therefore, himself, to Beech Park, for his own
new chariot, which was lately arrived from town,
making Robert follow with Sir Hugh's horses, as his
own were out at grass.</P>
<P>It was dinner-time, and Sir Hugh, equally vexed
and fatigued, resolved to return straight home. He
accepted, therefore, a place in the chariot, bid Eu∣genia
follow him, and Robert make haste; solemnly
adding to the latter: “I had fully intended making
you the proper lecture upon your not coming in
time; but as it has turned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut not to be your fault,
on account of an accident, I shall say no more; ex∣cept
to give you a hint not to do such a thing again,
because we have all been upon the point of being
tossed by a mad bull; which would certainly have
happened, but for the lucky chance of its turning
out a false alarm.”</P>
<P>The remainder of the party proceeded without
further adventure. Edgar attended Camilla; Miss
Margland adhered to Bellamy: Lionel, who durst
not venture at any new frolic, but with whom time
lingered when none was passing, retreated; Dr.
Marchmont, who was near his home, soon also made
his bow; and Dr. Orkborne, who was glad to be
alone, ruminated with wonder upon what appeared
to him a phenomenon, a man of learning who could
deign to please and seem pleased where books were
not the subject of discourse, and where scholastic at∣tainments
were not required to elucidate a single
sentence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Ways of looking at the same Thing.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the party arrived at Cleves, Camilla,
who had observed that Edgar seemed much disap∣pointed
<PB N="175" REF="175"/>
by the breaking up of the cottage expedi∣tion,
proposed that it should take place in the even∣ing;
and her uncle, though too much fatigued to
venture out again himself, consented, or rather in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isted,
that the excursion should be made without
him.</P>
<P>Before they set out, Edgar desired to speak with
Sir Hugh in private.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh concluded it was to make his proposals
of marriage for Indiana; and had not patience to
step into his own apartment, but told them all to re∣tire,
with a nod at Indiana, which prepared not only
herself but Miss Margland, Camilla, and Eugenia
to join in his expectation.</P>
<P>Indiana, though a good deal fluttered, flew to a
window, to see if the new chariot was in sight; and
then, turning to Miss Margland, asked, “Pray,
should I refuse him at first?”</P>
<P>Miss Margland spared not for proper instructions;
and immediately began a negociation with the fair
questioner, for continuing to live with her.</P>
<P>Eugenia was occupied in reflecting with pity upon
the idleness of Indiana, which so ill had fitted her
for becoming the companion of Mandlebert.</P>
<P>Camilla, unusually thoughtful, walked alone into
the garden, and sought a path least in sight.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, meanwhile, was most unpleasantly un∣deceived.
Edgar, without naming Indiana, in∣formed
him of the situation in which he had sur∣prised
Bellamy, and of his suspicions with regard to
the destination of the chaise, but for his own timely
arrival at the farm-house; adding, that his gratitude
to Mr. Tyrold, his respect for himself, and his affec∣tion
for all the family, made him think it his duty to
reveal these circumstances without delay.</P>
<P>The baronet shuddered with horror; and de∣clared
he would instantly send an express to bring
Clermont home, that Eugenia might be married out
of hand; and, in the mean time, that he would
have every window in the house barred, and keep her
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked up in her room.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="176"/>
Edgar dissuaded him from so violent a measure;
but advised him to speak with his niece upon the
danger she had probably escaped, and of which she
seemed wholly unconscious; to prevail with her not
to go out again this evening, and to send for Mr.
Tyrold, and acquaint him with the affair.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh thanked him for his counsel, and im∣plicitly
acted by his opinion.</P>
<P>He then ordered the coach for Miss Margland,
Indiana, and Camilla.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, finding neither Sir Hugh nor Eu∣genia
of the party, declined joining it. Lionel was
returned to Etherington; and Edgar rode on
before, to invite Dr. Marchmont, with the consent
of the Baronet, to take the fourth place in the
carriage.</P>
<P>Arrived at the rectory, he went straight, by pre∣scriptive
privilege, into the study of Dr. March∣mont,
whom he found immersed in books and pa∣pers,
which, immediately, at the request of Edgar,
he put aside; not without regret to quit them,
though wholly without reluctance to oblige.</P>
<P>Edgar had ridden so hard, that they had some
time to wait for the coach. But he did not appear
anxious for its arrival; though he wore a look that
was far from implying him to be free from anxiety.</P>
<P>He was silent,—he hemmed,—he was silent again,
—and again he hemmed,—and then, gently laying
his hand upon the shoulder of the Doctor, while his
eyes, full of meaning, were fixed upon his face;
“Doctor,” he cried, “you would hardly have
known these young ladies?—they are all grown
from children into women since you saw them last.”</P>
<P>“Yes,” answered the Doctor, “and very
charming women. Indiana has a beauty so exqui∣site,
it is scarce possible to look away from it a mo∣ment:
Eugenia joins so much innocence with infor∣mation,
that the mind must itself be deformed that
could dwell upon her personal defects, after convers∣ing
with her: Camilla”—</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="177"/>
He paused, and Edgar hastily turned another
way, not to look at him, nor be looked at, while
he proceeded:</P>
<P>“Camilla,” he presently continued, “seems the
most inartificially sweet, the most unobtrusively gay,
and the most attractively lovely of almost any young
creature I ever beheld.”</P>
<P>With a heart all expanded, and a face full of sen∣sibility,
Edgar now turned to him, and seizing, in∣voluntarily,
his hand, which he eagerly shook, “You
think her, then,”—he cried,—but suddenly stopt,
dropt his hand, coughed two or three times; and,
taking out his pocket handkerchief, seemed tor∣mented
with a violent cold.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont affectionately embraced him.
“My dear young friend,” he cried, “I see the
situation of your mind—and think every possible
happiness promises to be yours; yet, if you have
taken no positive step, suffer me to speak with you
before you proceed.”</P>
<P>“Far from having taken any positive step, I have
not yet even formed any resolution.”</P>
<P>Here the carriage stopt for the Doctor, who re∣peated,
“Yes! I think every possible happiness
promises to be yours!” before he went on to the
ladies. Edgar, in a trepidation too great to be seen
by them, kept behind till they drove off, though he
then gallopped so fast, that he arrived at the cottage
before them: the words, “I think every possible
happiness promises to be yours,” vibrating the whole
time in his ears.</P>
<P>When the coach arrived, Edgar handed out Miss
Margland and Indiana; leaving Camilla to the Doc∣tor;
willing to let him see more of her, and by no
means displeased to avoid his eyes at that moment
himself.</P>
<P>Indiana was in the most sprightly spirits she had
ever experienced; she concluded herself on the verge
of becoming mistress of a fine place and a large for∣tune;
she had received adulation all the morning that
had raised her beauty higher than ever in her own
<PB N="178" REF="178"/>
estimation; and she secretly revolved, with delight,
various articles of ornament and of luxury, which
she had long wished to possess, and which now, for
her wedding clothes, she should have riches sufficient
to purchase.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, too, was all smoothness, com∣placency,
and courtesy.</P>
<P>Camilla, alone, was grave; Camilla, who, by
nature, alone was gay.</P>
<P>“Dear! is this the cottage we have been coming
to all this time?” cried Indiana, upon entering;
“Lord! I thought it would have been something
quite pretty.”</P>
<P>“And what sort of prettiness,” said Edgar,
“did you expect from a cottage?”</P>
<P>“Dear, I don't know—but I thought we were
come on purpose to see something extraordinary?”</P>
<P>Camilla, who followed, made an exclamation far
different; an exclamation of pleasure, surprise, and
vivacity, that restored for an instant, all her native
gaiety: for no sooner had she crossed the threshold,
than she recognised, in a woman who was curtsying
low to receive her, and whom Indiana had passed
without observing, the wise of the poor prisoner for
whom she had interceded with Mandlebert.</P>
<P>“How I rejoice to see you!” cried she, “and
to see you here! and how much better you look!
and how comfortable you seem! I hope you are now
all well?”</P>
<P>“Ah, madam,” answered the woman; “we
owe every thing to that good young gentleman! he
has put us in this nice new cottage, and employs us
in his service. Blessings on his head! I am sure he
will be paid for it!”</P>
<P>Edgar, somewhat agitated, occupied himself with
jumping the little boy; Camilla looked round with
rapture; Indiana seemed wonder-struck, without
knowing why; Dr. Marchmont narrowly watched
them all; and Miss Margland, expecting a new col∣lection
would be next proposed for setting them up,
<PB N="179" REF="179"/>
nimbly recrossed the threshold, to examine the pros∣pect
without.</P>
<P>The husband, now in decent garb, and much re∣covered,
though still weak and emaciated; advanced
to Camilla, to make his humble acknowledgments,
that she had recommended them to their kind bene∣factor.</P>
<P>“No!” cried Camilla; “you owe me nothing!
your own distress recommended you;—your own
distress—and Mr. Mandlebert's generosity.”</P>
<P>Then, going up to Edgar, “It is your happy
fate,” she said, in an accent of admiration, “to act
all that my father so often plans and wishes, but
which his income will not allow him to execute.”</P>
<P>“You see,” answered he, gratefully, “how
little suffices for content! I have scarce done any
thing—yet how relieved, how satisfied are these poor
people! This hut was fortunately vacant”—</P>
<P>“O, madam!” interrupted the poor woman,
“if you knew but how that good gentleman has
done it all! how kindly he has used us, and made
every body else use us! and let nobody taunt us with
our bad faults!—and what good he has done to my
poor sick husband! and how he has clothed my poor
little half naked children! and, what is more than
all, saved us from the shame of an ill life.”—</P>
<P>Camilla felt the tears start into her eyes;—she
hastily snatched the little babe into her arms; and,
while her kisses hid her face, Happy, and thrice
happy Indiana! with a soft sigh, was the silent eja∣culation
of her heart.</P>
<P>She seated herself on a stool, and, without speak∣ing
or hearing any thing more, devoted herself to
the baby.</P>
<P>Indiana, meanwhile, whose confidence in her own
situation gave her courage to utter whatever first oc∣curred
to her, having made a general survey of the
place and people, with an air of disappointment,
now amused herself with an inspection more minute,
taking up and casting down every thing that was
portable, without any regard either to deranging its
<PB N="180" REF="180"/>
neatness, or endangering its safety:—exclaiming, as
she made her round of investigation, “Dear!
Crockery ware! how ugly!—Lord, what little
mean chairs!—Is that your best gown, good wo∣man?
—Dear, what an ugly pattern!—Well, I
would not wear such a thing to save my life!—Have
you got nothing better than this for a floor-cloth?—
Only look at those curtains! Did you ever see such
frights?—Lord! do you eat off these platters? I
am sure I could sooner die! I should not mind
starving half as much!”</P>
<P>Miss Margland, hoping the collection was now
either made or relinquished, ventured to re-enter,
and inquire if they never meant to return home?
Camilla unwillingly gave up the baby; but would
not depart without looking over the cottage, where
every thing she saw excited a sensation of pleasure.
“How neat is this! How tidy that!” were her
continual exclamations; “How bright you have
rubbed your saucepans! How clean every thing is
all round! How soon you will all get well in this
healthy and comfortable little dwelling!”</P>
<P>Edgar, in a low voice, then told Dr. March∣mont
the history of his new cottagers, saying:
“You will not, I hope, disapprove what I have
done? Their natures seemed so much disposed to
good, I could not bear to let their wants turn them
again to evil.”</P>
<P>“You have certainly done right,” answered the
Doctor; “to give money without inquiry, or further
aid, to those who have adopted bad practices, is, to
them, but temptation, and to society an injury; but
to give them both the counsel and the means to pur∣sue
a right course, is, to them, perhaps, salvation,
and to the community, the greatest service.”</P>
<P>Indiana and Miss Margland, quite wearied, both
got into the carriage; Edgar, having deposited
them, returned to Camilla, who kissed both the
children, poured forth good wishes upon the father
and mother; and, then, gave him her hand. En∣chanted,
<PB N="181" REF="181"/>
he took it, exclaiming; “Ah! who is
like you! so lively—yet so feeling!”</P>
<P>Struck and penetrated, she made no answer:
Alas! she thought, I fear he is not quite satisfied
with Indiana!</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont was set down at his own house;
where, he begged to have a conference with Edgar
the next morning.</P>
<P>The whole way home, the benevolence of Edgar
occupied the mind of Camilla; and, not in the pre∣sent
instance, the less, that its object had been ori∣ginally
of her own pointing out.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treats.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and Mrs. Tyrold had obeyed the summons
of Sir Hugh, whom they found in extreme tribula∣tion;
persuaded by his fears not only of the design
of Bellamy, but of its inevitable success. His bro∣ther,
however, who knew his alarms to be generally
as unfounded as his hopes; and Mrs. Tyrold, who
almost undisguisedly despised both; no sooner heard
his account, than, declining to discuss it, they sent
for Eugenia. She related the transaction with a
confusion so innocent, that it was easy to discern
shame alone had hitherto caused her silence; and
with a simplicity so unaffected, that not a doubt
could rest upon their minds, but that her heart was
as disengaged as her intentions had been irreproach∣able.
Yet they were not the less struck with the
danger she had incurred; and, while her father
blessed Mandlebert for her preservation, her mother
was so sensible to his care for the family welfare and
honour, that the anger she had conceived against
him subsided, though the regret to which it had
owed its birth increased.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="182"/>
Mr. Tyrold gave his daughter some slight cau∣tions
and general advice; but thought it wisest, since
he found her tranquil and unsuspicious, not to raise
apprehensions that might disturb her composure, nor
awaken ideas of which the termination must be
doubtful.</P>
<P>Her mother deemed the matter to be undeserving
the least serious alarm. The man had appeared to
her from the beginning to be a despicable adven∣turer;
and her lofty contempt of all low arts made
her conclude her well-principled Eugenia as superior
to their snares as to their practice.</P>
<P>This conference completely quieted the fears of
Sir Hugh; who relinquished his design of sending
for Clermont, and imagined Edgar to have been too
severe in his judgment of Bellamy, who had only
knelt in pure compassion, to prevail with Eugenia
to take care of her life.</P>
<P>The rector and his lady were already gone before
the cottage group came home. Edgar was anxious
to inquire of Sir Hugh what had passed. The
three females, concluding he had still something to
say relative to his proposals, by tacit agreement, re∣tired
to their own rooms.</P>
<P>They were not, however, as concurrent in their
eagerness to re-assemble. Miss Margland and In∣diana
watched the moment when they might appease
their burning curiosity by descending; but Eugenia
wished to prolong her absence, that she might re∣cover
from the embarrassment she had just suffered;
and Camilla determined not to appear again till the
next morning.</P>
<P>For the first time in her life after the shortest se∣paration,
she forbore to seek Eugenia, whom she
supposed would have gathered all the particulars of
the approaching nuptials. She felt no desire to hear
them. It was a period to which, hitherto, she had
looked forward as to a thing of course; but this day
it had struck her that Edgar and Indiana could not
be happy together.—She had even surmised, from
<PB N="183" REF="183"/>
his last speech, that he lamented, in secret, the con∣nexion
he had formed.</P>
<P>The gentlest pity took possession of her breast;
an increasing admiration succeeded to her pity. She
could not bear to witness so unequal a scene, as the
full satisfaction of Sir Hugh contrasted with the se∣riousness,
perhaps repentance, of Edgar. She
pleaded an head-ache, and went to bed.</P>
<P>The morning did not find her le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s averse to hear
the confirmation of the suspected news. On the
contrary, her repugnance to have it ascertained be∣came
stronger. She did not ask herself why; she
did not consider the uselessness of flying for one hour
what she must encounter the next. The present mo∣ment
was all she could weigh; and, to procrastinate
any evil, seemed, to her ardent and active imagina∣tion,
to conquer it. Again, therefore, she planned
a visit to Mrs. Arlbery; though she had given it up
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o long, from the discouragement of Lionel, that
she felt more of shame than of pleasure in the idea of
making so tardy an apology; but she could think of
no other place to which the whole party would not
accompany her; and to avoid them and their com∣munications,
for however short a space of time, was
now her sole aim.</P>
<P>Before breakfast, she repaired to the apartment
of her uncle; her request was granted, as soon as
heard; and she ordered the chaise.</P>
<P>Indiana and Miss Margland, meanwhile, had learnt
from the baronet, that the proposals were not yet
made. Miss Margland softened the disappointment
of Indiana, by suggesting that her admirer was pro∣bably
waiting the arrival of some elegant trinket,
that he destined to present her upon his declaration:
but she was by no means free from doubt and sufpi∣cion
herself. She languished to quit Cleves, and Sir
Hugh had almost thought her accountable for the
slowness of Mandlebert's proceedings. To keep up
her own consequence, she had again repeated her as∣surances,
that all was in a prosperous train; though
she had frequently, with strong private uneasiness,
<PB N="184" REF="184"/>
observed the eyes of Edgar fixed upon Camilla, with
an attention far more pointed than she had ever re∣marked
in them when their direction was towards
her fair pupil.</P>
<P>Camilla hurried over her breakfast in expectation
of the chaise, and in dread continual, lest her cousin
should call her aside, to acquaint her that all was ar∣ranged.
Edgar perceived, with surprise, that she
was going out alone; and, no sooner gathered whi∣ther,
than, drawing her to one of the windows, he
earnestly said: “Is it by appointment you wait upon
Mrs. Arlbery?”</P>
<P>“No.”</P>
<P>“Does she at all expect you this morning?”</P>
<P>“No.”</P>
<P>“Would it, then, be asking too much, if I should
intreat you to postpone your visit for a short time?”</P>
<P>The whole design of Camilla was to absent her∣self
immediately; yet she hated to say no. She
looked disturbed, and was silent.</P>
<P>“Have you made any further acquaintance with
her since the morning of the raffle?”</P>
<P>“No, none; but I wish excessively to know more
of her.”</P>
<P>“She is certainly, very—agreeable,” said he, with
some hesitation; “but, whether she is all Mrs. Ty∣rold
would approve”—</P>
<P>“I hope you know no harm of her?—If you do,
pray keep it to yourself!—for it would quite afflict
me to hear any thing to her disadvantage.”</P>
<P>“I should be grieved, indeed, to be the messenger
of affliction to you; but I hope there may be no
occasion; I only beg a day or two's patience; and,
in the mean while, I can give you this assurance;
she is undoubtedly a woman of character. I saw
she had charmed you, and I made some immediate
inquiries. Her reputation is without taint.”</P>
<P>“A thousand, thousand thanks,” cried Camilla,
gaily, “for taking so much trouble; and ten thou∣sand
more for finding it needless!”</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="185"/>
Edgar could not forbear laughing, but answered,
he was not yet so certain it was needless; since ex∣emption
from actual blemish could only be a negative
recommendation; he should very soon, he added,
see a lady upon whose judgment he could rely, and
who would frankly satisfy him with respect to some
other particulars, which, he owned, he considered
as essential to be known, before any intimacy
should be formed.</P>
<P>Wishing to comply with his request, yet impatient
to leave the house, Camilla stood suspended till the
chaise was announced.</P>
<P>“I think,” cried she, with a look and tone of ir∣resolution,
“my going this once can draw on no ill
consequence?”</P>
<P>Edgar only dropt his eyes.</P>
<P>“You are not of that opinion?”</P>
<P>“I have a very particular engagement this morn∣ing,”
he replied; “but I will readily give it up,
and ride off instantly to make my application to this
lady, if it is possible you can defer only till to-mor∣row
your visit. Will you suffer me to ask such a
delay? It will greatly oblige me.”</P>
<P>“Why, then,—I will defer it till to-morrow,—
or till to-morrow week!” cried she wholly vanquish∣ed;
“I insist, therefore, that you do not post∣pone
your business.”</P>
<P>She then desired the servant, who was taking away
the breakfast equipage, to order the chaise to be put up.</P>
<P>Edgar, subdued in his turn, caught her hand;
but, instantly recollecting himself, hastily let it go;
and, throwing up the window sash, abruptly ex∣claimed;
“I never saw such fine weather;—I hope
it will not rain!”</P>
<P>He then rapidly wished them all good morning,
and mounted his horse.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, who, sideling towards the win∣dow,
on pretence of examining a print, had heard
and seen all that had passed, was almost overpowered
with rage, by the conviction she received that her
apprehensions were not groundless. She feared losing
<PB N="186" REF="186"/>
all weight both with the baronet and with Indiana,
if she made this acknowledgment, and retreated,
confounded, to her own room, to consider what path
to pursue at so dangerous a crisis; wearing a scowl
upon her face, that was always an indication she
would not be followed.</P>
<P>Camilla also went to her chamber, in a perturba∣tion
at once pleasing and painful. She was sorry
to have missed her ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ursion, but she was happy to
have obliged Edgar; she was delighted he could take
such interest in her conduct and affairs, yet dreaded,
more than ever, a private conversation with In∣diana;
—Indiana, who, every moment, appeared to
her less and less calculated to bestow felicity upon
Edgar Mandlebert.</P>
<P>She seated herself at a window, and soon, through
the trees, perceived him gallopping away. “Too—
too amiable Edgar!” she cried, earnestly looking
after him, with her hands clasped, and tears starting
into her eyes.</P>
<P>Frightened at her own tenderness, she rose, shut
the window, and walked to another end of the
apartment.</P>
<P>She took up a book; but she could not read:
“Too—too amiable Edgar!” again escaped her.
She went to her piano forte; she could not play:
“Too—too amiable Edgar!” broke forth in de∣fiance
of all struggle.</P>
<P>Alarmed and ashamed, even to herself, she re∣solved
to dissipate her ideas by a long walk; and
not to come out of the park, till the first dinner-bell
summoned her to dress.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Sides of a Question.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of Edgar had been to ride to Mrs.
Needham, the lady of whom he meant to ask the
<PB N="187" REF="187"/>
information to which he had alluded; but a charm
too potent for resistance demanded his immediate li∣beration
from the promise to Dr. Marchmont, which
bound him to proceed no further till they had again
conversed together.</P>
<P>He gallopped, therefore, to the parsonage house
of Cleves, and entering the study of the Doctor,
and taking him by the hand, with the most animated
gesture; “My dear and honoured friend,” he cried,
“I come to you now without hesitation, and free
from every painful embarrassment of lurking irreso∣lution!
I come to you decided, and upon grounds
which cannot offend you, though the decision anti∣cipates
your counsel. I come to you, in fine, my
dear Doctor, my good and kind friend, to confess
that yesterday you saw right, with regard to the
situation of my mind, and that, to-day, I have only
your felicitations to beg, upon my confirmed, my
irrevocable choice!”</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont embraced him: “May you then,”
he cried, “be as happy, my dear young friend, as
you deserve! I can wish you nothing higher.”</P>
<P>“Last night,” continued Edgar, “I felt all
doubt die away: captivating as I have ever thought
her, so soft, so gentle, so touchingly sweet, as last
night, I had never yet beheld her; you witnessed it,
my dear Doctor? you saw her with the baby in her
arms? how beautiful, how endearing a sight!”</P>
<P>The Doctor looked assentingly, but did not speak.</P>
<P>“Yet even last night was short of the feelings she
excited this morning. My dear friend! she was
upon the point of making an excursion from which
she had promised herself peculiar pleasure, and to
see a lady for whom she has conceived the warmest
admiration—I begged her to postpone—perhaps re∣linquish
entirely the visit—she had obtained leave
from Sir Hugh—the carriage was at the door—
would you, could you believe such sweetness with
such vivacity? she complied with my request, and
complied with a grace that has rivetted her—I own
it—that has rivetted her to my soul!”</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="188"/>
Doctor Marchmont smiled, but rather pensively
than rejoicingly; and Edgar, receiving no answer,
walked for some time about the room, silently en∣joying
his own thoughts.</P>
<P>Returning then to the Doctor, “My dear friend,”
he cried, “I understood you wished to speak with me?”</P>
<P>“Yes—but I thought you disengaged.”</P>
<P>“So, except mentally, I am still.”</P>
<P>“Does she not yet know her conquest?”</P>
<P>“She does not even guess it.”</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont now rising, with much energy
said: “Hear me then, my dear and most valued
young friend; forbear to declare yourself, make no
overtures to her relations, raise no expectations even
in her own breast, and let not rumour surmise your
passion to the world, till her heart is better known
to you.”</P>
<P>Edgar, starting and amazed, with great emotion
exclaimed: “What do you mean, my good Doctor?
do you suspect any prior engagement? any fatal pre∣possession?”—</P>
<P>“I suspect nothing. I do not know her. I
mean not, therefore, the propensities alone, but the
worth, also, of her heart; deception is easy, and
I must not see you thrown away.”</P>
<P>“Let me, then, be her guarantee!” cried Edgar,
with firmness; “for I know her well! I have known
her from her childhood, and cannot be deceived. I
fear nothing—except my own powers of engaging
her regard. I can trace to a certainty, even from
my boyish remarks, her fair, open, artless, and dis∣interested
character.”</P>
<P>He then gave a recital of the noble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess of her
sentiments and conduct when only nine years old;
contrasting the relation with the sullen and ungener∣ous
behaviour of Indiana at the fame age.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont listened to the account with at∣tention
and pleasure, but not with an air of that full
conviction which Edgar expected. “All this,” he
said, “is highly prophetic of good, and confirms
<PB N="189" REF="189"/>
me in the opinion I expressed last night, that every
possible happiness promises to be yours.”</P>
<P>“Yet, still,” said Edgar, a little chagrined, “there
seems some drawback to your entire approbation?”</P>
<P>“To your choice I have none.”</P>
<P>“You perplex me, Doctor! I know not to what
you object, what you would intimate, nor what
propose?”</P>
<P>“All I have to suggest may be comprised in two
points: First, That you will refuse confirmation
even to your own intentions, till you have positively
ascertained her actual possession of those virtues with
which she appears to be endowed: and secondly,
That if you find her gifted with them all, you will
not solicit her acceptance till you are satisfied of her
affection.”</P>
<P>“My dear Doctor,” cried Edgar, half laugh∣ing,
“from what an alarm of wild conjecture has
your explanation relieved me! Hear me, however,
in return, and I think I can satisfy you, that, even
upon your own conditions, not an obstacle stands in
the way of my speaking to Mr. Tyrold this very
evening.</P>
<P>“With regard to your first article,” her virtues, I
have told you the dawning superiority of her most
juvenile ideas of right; and though I have latterly
lost sight of her, by travelling during our vacations,
I know her to have always been under the superin∣tendance
of one of the first of women; and for these
last three weeks, which I have spent under the same
roof with her, I have observed her to be all that is
amiable, sweet, natural, and generous. What then
on this point remains? Nothing. I am irrefragably
convinced of her worth.</P>
<P>“With respect to your second condition, I own
you a little embarrass me; yet how may I inquire
into the state of her affections, without acknowledg∣ing
her mistress of mine?”</P>
<P>“Hold! hold!” interrupted the Doctor, “you
proceed too rapidly. The first article is all unset∣tled,
while you are flying to the last.”</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="190"/>
“It is true,” and I again repeat it, every promise
is in your favour; but do not mistake promise for
performance. This young lady appears to be all ex∣cellence;
for an acquaintance, for a friend, I doubt
not you have already seen enough to establish her in
your good opinion; but since it is only within a few
hours you have taken the resolution which is to em∣power
her to colour the rest of your life, you must
study her, from this moment, with new eyes, new
ears, and new thoughts. Whatever she does, you
must ask yourself this question: “Should I like
such behaviour in my wife?” Whatever she says, you
must make yourself the same demand. Nothing must
escape you; you must view as if you had never seen
her before; the interrogatory, <HI>Were she mine?</HI> must
be present at every look, every word, every motion;
you must forget her wholly as Camilla Tyrold, you
must think of her only as Camilla Mandlebert; even
justice is insufficient during this period of probation,
and instead of inquiring, “Is this right in her?”
you must simply ask, “Would it be pleasing to me?”</P>
<P>“You are apprehensive, then, of some dissimili∣tude
of character prejudicial to our future happiness?”</P>
<P>“Not of character; you have been very pecu∣liarly
situated for obviating all risk upon that first and
most important particular. I have no doubt of her
general worthiness; but though esteem hangs wholly
upon character, happiness always links itself with
disposition.”</P>
<P>“You gratify me, Doctor, by naming dispo∣sition,
for I can give you the most unequivocal assur∣ance
of her sweetness, her innocence, her benevolence,
joined to a spirit of never-dying vivacity—an anima∣tion
of never-ceasing good humour!”</P>
<P>“I know you, my dear Mandlebert, to be, by
nature, penetrating and minute in your observations;
which, in your general commerce with the world,
will protect both your understanding and your affec∣tions
from the usual snares of youth: But here—to
be even scrupulous is not enough; to avoid all dan∣ger
<PB N="191" REF="191"/>
of repentance, you must become positively dis∣trustful.”</P>
<P>“Never, Doctor, never! I would sooner renounce
every prospect of felicity, than act a part so unge∣nerous,
where I am conscious of such desert! Upon
this article, therefore, we have done; I am already
and fully convinced of her excellence. But, with
respect to your second difficulty, that I will not seek
her acceptance, till satisfied of her regard—there—
indeed, you start an idea that comes home to my soul
in its very inmost recesses! O Doctor!—could I
hope—however distantly—durst I hope—the inde∣pendent,
unsolicited, involuntary possession of that
most ingenuous, most inartificial of human hearts!—”</P>
<P>“And why not? why, while so liberally you do
justice to another, should you not learn to appreciate
your self?”</P>
<P>A look of elation, delight, and happiness con∣veyed
to Dr. Marchmont his pupil's grateful sense
of this question.</P>
<P>“I do not fear making you vain,” he continued;
“I know your understanding to be too solid, and
your temperament too philosophic, to endanger your
running into the common futility of priding yourself
upon the gifts of nature, any more than upon those
of fortune; 'tis in their uses only you can claim any
applause. I will not, therefore, scruple to assert,
you can hardly any where propose yourself with
much danger of being rejected. You are amiable
and accomplished; abounding in wealth, high in
character; in person <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d appearance unexception∣able;
you can have no doubt of the joyful appro∣bation
of her friends, nor can you entertain a rea∣sonable
fear of her concurrence; yet, with all this,
pardon me, when I plainly, explicitly add, it is very
possible you may be utterly indifferent to her.”</P>
<P>“If so, at least,” said Edgar, in a tone and with
a countenance whence all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation was flown, “she
will leave me master of myself; she is too noble to
suffer any sordid motives to unite us.”</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="192"/>
“Do not depend upon that; the influence of
friends, the prevalence of example, the early no∣tion
which every female imbibes that a good esta∣blishment
must be her first object in life—these are
motives of marriage commonly sufficient for the
whole sex.”</P>
<P>“Her choice, indeed,” said Edgar, thought∣fully,
“would not, perhaps, be wholly uninfluenced;
I pretend not to doubt that the voice of her friends
would be all in my favour.”</P>
<P>“Yes,” interrupted Dr. Marchmont, “and, be
she noble as she may, Beech-Park will be also in
your favour! your mansion, your equipage, your do∣mestics,
even your table, will be in your favour—”</P>
<P>“Doctor,” interrupted Edgar, in his turn, “I
know you think ill of women.—”</P>
<P>“Do not let that idea weaken what I urge; I
have not had reason to think well of them; yet I
believe there are individuals who merit every regard:
your Camilla may be one of them. Take, however,
this warning from my experience; whatever is her
appearance of worth, try and prove its foundation,
ere you conclude it invulnerable; and whatever are
your pretensions to her hand, do not necessarily con∣nect
them with your chances for her heart.”</P>
<P>Mandlebert, filled now with a distrust of himself
and of his powers, which he was incapable of har∣bouring
of Camilla and her magnanimity, felt struck
to the soul with the apprehension of failing to gain
her affection, and wounded in every point both of
honour and delicacy, from the bare suggestion of
owing his wife to his situation in the world. He
found no longer any difficulty in promising not to act
with precipitance; his confidence was gone; his ele∣vation
of sentiment was depressed; a general mist
clouded his prospects, and a suspensive discomfort in∣quieted
his mind. He shook Dr. Marchmont by
the hand, and assuring him he would weigh well all
he had said, and take no measure till he had again

consulted with him, remounted his horse, and
slowly walked it back to Cleves.</P>
