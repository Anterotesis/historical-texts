<HEAD>PROLOGUE, Spoken by Mr. FOOTE, At the Theatre-Royal in DUBLIN, On the 19th of November, 1773.</HEAD>
<L>UPWARDS of twenty years are sled and wasted</L>
<L>Since in this spot your favour first I tasted.</L>
<L>Urg'd by your smiles thro' various realms to roam,</L>
<L>The Muse now brings her motley cargo home;</L>
<L>For frugal Nature, with an equal hand,</L>
<L>Bestows peculiar gifts to every land.</L>
<L>To France she gave her rapid repartee,</L>
<L>Bows, and <HI>bons mots,</HI> fibs, fashions, flattery,</L>
<L>Shrugs, grins, grimace, and sportive gaiety:</L>
<L>Arm'd with the whole artillery of love,</L>
<L>Latium's soft sons possess the powers to move:</L>
<L>Humour, the foremost of the festive crew,</L>
<L>Source of the comic scene, she gave to you;</L>
<L>Humour, with arched brow, and leering eye,</L>
<L>Shrewd, solemn, sneering, subtle, slow and sly;</L>
<L>Serious herself, yet laughter still provoking,</L>
<L>By teasing, tickling, jeering, gibing, joking:</L>
<L>Impartial gift, that owns nor rank nor birth!</L>
<L>'Tis theirs who rule the realm, or till the earth;</L>
<L>Theirs who in senates wage the wordy war,</L>
<L>And theirs whose humble lot conducts the car:</L>
<L>If aught deriv'd from her adorns my strain,</L>
<L>You gave, at least discover'd first, the vein.</L>
<L>Should wide experience, or maturing age,</L>
<L>Have brought or mirth or moral to the stage,</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="4"/>To you, the patrons of the wilder song,</L>
<L>The chaster notes in justice must belong:</L>
<L>But should infirmities with time conspire,</L>
<L>My force to weaken or abate my fire,</L>
<L>Less entertainment may arise to you,</L>
<L>But to myself less danger will ensue.</L>
<L>If age contracts my muscles, shrills my tone,</L>
<L>No man will claim those foibles as his own;</L>
<L>Nor, if I halt or hobble thro' the scene,</L>
<L>Malice point out what citizen I mean:</L>
<L>No foe I fear more than a legal fury,</L>
<L>Unless I gain this circle for my jury.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Oldham.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>NOT a syllable more will I hear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but, my dear—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed, Sir John, at your meanness! or that you could submit to give his paltry proposals so much as a reading!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, what would you have had me done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Done? returned them with the con∣tempt they deserved. But, come, unfold! I am calm: Reveal the pretty project your precious head has produced.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, as to that, my head produced—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't wonder that shame has tied up your tongue! But, come; I will spare the confusion, and tell you what you would say. Here, Lady Oldham, Sir Matthew Mite has just sent me a letter, modestly desiring that, in return for the ruin he has brought on me and my house, I would be so kind as to bestow upon him my darling daughter, the hopes of my— And is it possible you can be mean enough to think of such an alliance? Will you, Sir John, oblige me with an answer to a few short questions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you consider yourself as sprung from a family at least as ancient as any in the county you live in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I fancy will not be denied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor was it, I fancy, dishonoured by an alliance with mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My Lady, the very reverse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You succeeded, Sir, to a patrimony, which though the liberal and hospitable spirit of your predecessors would not suffer to encrease, yet their prudence took care should never be diminished?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From the public and private virtues of
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
your ancestors, the inhabitants of the neighbour∣ing borough thought their best and dearest in∣terests in no hands so secure as in theirs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor till lately were they so tainted by the fashion of the times, as to adopt the egregious absurdity, That to be faithfully served and pro∣tected above, it was necessary to be largely bribed and corrupted below?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can't say, except now and then a bit of venison, or an annual dinner, they have ever put me to any great——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indulge me yet a moment, Sir John! In this happy situation, did the last year chear∣fully close; our condition, though not opulent, affluent, and you happy in the quiet possession of your family honours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is no gainsaying of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now, look at the dismal, shocking reverse!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is but too much reason in what your ladyship says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And consider, at the same time, to whom you are obliged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what could we do? your ladyship knows there was nobody more against my giving up than yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me proceed. At this crisis,
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
preceded by all the pomp of Asia, Sir Matthew Mite, from the Indies, came thundering amongst us; and, profusely scattering the spoils of ruined provinces, corrupted the virtue and alienated the affections of all the old friends to the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is nothing but truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Compelled by the same means to defend those that were employed in attacking your interest, you have been obliged deeply to encumber your fortune; his superior address has procured a return, and probably your petition will complete the ruin his opposition began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hope all for the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And who can tell, but you may be soon forced to part with your patrimony, to the very insolent worthless individual, who has been the author of your distress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I would sooner perish, my Lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Parallel instances may be produced; nor is it at all unlikely, but Sir Matthew, taking a liking to your family mansion, has pursued this very method to compel you to sell it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is, my dear, to avoid this necessity that I wish you to give his letter a reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible, not to mention the mean∣ness, that you can be weak enough to expect any real service from that infamous quarter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who can tell, my love, but a con∣sciousness of the mischief he has done us, may have roused some feelings that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His feelings! will he listen to a pri∣vate complaint, who has been deaf to the cries of a people? or drop a tear for particular dis∣tress, who owes his rise to the ruin of thousands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Lady Oldham, I find all that I say signifies nothing. —But here comes brother Thomas; two heads are better than one; let us take his opinion, my love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What need of any opinion? the case is too clear; nor indeed, if there had been a necessity for consulting another, should I have thought your brother the properest man to ad∣vise with on the occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? there is not a mer∣chant whose judgment would be sooner taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not, on the value of mer∣chandize, or the goodness of a Bill of Exchange: But there is a nicety, a delicacy, an elevation of sentiment, in this case, which people who have narrowed their notions with commerce, and con∣sidered during the course of their lives their in∣terest alone, will scarce comprehend.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr. Thomas Oldham.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, sister! what! upon your old topic, I find?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some pretty comparisons, I suppose, not much to the honour of trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, brother, you know I have always allowed merchants to be a useful body of men; and considered commerce, in this country, as a pretty resource enough for the younger shoots of a family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Exceedingly condescending, indeed! And yet, sister, I could produce you some in∣stances where the younger shoots have flou∣rished and throve, when the reverend trunk has decayed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, brother Thomas—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, don't let us revive our antient disputes!—You seem warm; no misun∣derstanding, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; none, in the least: You know, my lady's temper's apt to be lively now and then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, sister—But, come! what ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occasioned this mighty debate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know, brother, how affair stand between Sir Matthew and us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He has sent us here a kind of compromise; I don't know well what to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it; a sort of a treaty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That in your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I can't prevail on my lady to give it a reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To what end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very natural one; in order to know the contents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Of what importance can they be to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That the letter will tell you. But surely, Lady Oldham, you are rather too nice. Give it me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it your ladyship's pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! here's a rout, indeed!—One would be apt to suspect that the packet was pestilential, and came from the Archipelago, instead of the Indies. Now let us see what this formidable memorial contains! <STAGE><HI>opens the letter.</HI></STAGE> <Q>“To Sir John Oldham. Sir Matthew Mite hav∣ing lately seen, at Lady Levant's rout, the eldest Miss Oldham, and being struck with her personal charms, proposes to her father ”the following treaty.</Q></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“<HI>Imprimis</HI>; Upon a matrimonial union between the young lady and him, all hostilities and contention shall cease, and Sir ”John be suffered to take his seat in security.</Q></P>

<P>That he will do, without an obliga∣tion to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you, sister, certain of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You don't harbour the least doubt of our merits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But do they always prevail?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is now, brother Thomas, no danger to dread; the restraint the popular part of government has in this instance laid on itself, at the same time that it does honour to them, distributes equal justice to all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And are you aware what the expence will be to obtain it?—But, pray, let me pro∣ceed!—<Q>“Secondly, as Sir Matthew is bent upon a large territorial acquisition in England, and Sir John Oldham's finances are at present a lit∣tle out of repair, Sir Matthew Mite will make up the money already advanced in another name, by way of future mortgage upon his estate, for the entire purchase, five lacks of ”roupees.</Q></P>

<P>Your ladyship is never out.—But, brother Thomas, these same lacks—to what may they amount?</P>

<P>Sixty thousand, at least.</P>

<P>No inconsiderable offer, my lady.</P>

<P>Contemptible! But pray, Sir, proceed.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A jagghire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The term is Indian, and means an annual income.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What strange jargon he deals in!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His stile is a little Oriental, I must own; but most exceedingly clear.</P>

<P>Yes, to Cossim Ali-Khan, or Mier Jaffeir. I hope you are near the conclusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But two articles more, <STAGE><HI>reads</HI></STAGE> <Q>“And that the principals may have no cares for the younger parts of their family, Sir Matthew will, at his own expence, transport the two young ladies, Miss Oldham's two sisters, to Madrass or Calcutta, and there procure them ”suitable husbands.</Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he treats my children like a parcel of convicts: Is this their method of sup∣plying their settlements?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This, with now and then a little kid∣napping, dear sister.—Well, madam, you have now the means of getting rid of all your offspring at once: Did not I tell you the paper was worth your perusal? You will reply to his wish; you can have no doubts, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not the least, as I will shew you. <STAGE><HI>Tears the letter.</HI></STAGE> And, if Sir John has the least spirit or pride, he will treat the insolent principal as I do his proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But that method, as things stand, may not be altogether so safe. I am sorry you were so hasty in destroying the letter: If I remember rightly, there is mention made of advancing money in another man's name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We have been compelled to borrow, I own; but I had no conception that he was the lender.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's done by a common contrivance; not a country lawyer but knows the doctrine of transfer.—How much was the sum?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ten thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And what, Sir John, were the terms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I could give no real security, my estate being settled till my son John comes of age▪ I found myself obliged to comply with all that was asked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A judgment, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They divided the sum, and I gave them a couple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Which will affect not only your per∣son, but personal property; so they are both in his power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Too true, I am afraid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you may be sent to a gaol, and your family turned into the streets, whenever he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How! Heaven forbid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not the least doubt can be made.— This is an artful project: No wonder that so much contrivance and cunning has been an over∣match for a plain English gentleman, or an inno∣cent Indian. And what is now to be done? Does your daughter Sophy know of this letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It reached my hands not ten minutes ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had some reason to think, that, had you complied, you would not have found her very eager to second your wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that, brother: Young girls are easily caught with titles and splendor; magnificence has a kind of magick for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have a better opinion of Sophy. You know, Lady Oldham, I have often hinted, that my boy was fond of his cousin; and possibly
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
my niece not totally averse to his wish; but you have always stopp'd me short, under a notion that the children were too nearly allied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, brother, don't yon think——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But that, sister, was not the right reason; you could have easily digested the <HI>cousins,</HI> but the <HI>compting-house</HI> stuck in his way: Your favourite maxim has been, that citizens are a distinct race, a sort of creatures that should mix with each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, brother, you can't conceive that I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no apology, good Lady Oldham! perhaps you have a higher alliance in view; and let us now consider what is to be done. You are totally averse to this treaty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can that be a question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Exceedingly so, as I apprehend: But few can be found to advance so large a sum on such slender security; nor is it to be expected,

indeed, unless from a friend to relieve, or a foe to ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible Sir Matthew can have acted from so infernal a motive, to have advanced the money with a view of distressing us deeper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Matthew is a profound politi∣cian, and will not stick at trifles to carry his point.</P>

<P>Why, is not this Sir Matthew——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps as bad a subject as your passion can paint him: But there are men from the Indies, and many too, with whom I have the honour to live, who dispense nobly and with hospitality here, what they have acquired with honour and credit elsewhere; and, at the same time they have increased the dominions and wealth, have added virtues too to their country.</P>

<P>Improper! I dare say, Sir, you will have nothing of that kind to fear from my cousin.</P>

<P>You are really pleased to be so very particular, that I scarce know what answer to make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my good niece, I will perplex you no longer: My son has concealed nothing from me; and did the completion of your wishes depend on my approbation alone, you would have but little to fear: But my lady's notions are so very peculiar, you know, and all her prin∣ciples so determined and fixed——</P>

<P>No; I had like to have forgot! Betsy grew sick of St. Paul's, so I have taken her a house amongst the new buildings; both the air and the company is better.</P>

<P>Right.</P>

<P>To say truth, the situation was disagree∣able on many accounts. Do you know, though I took care few people should behave better at Christmas, that because he thought her a citizen, the housekeeper of Drury-Lane Theatre, when his master mounted, refused her a side-box?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With a little more experience, your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then pass the box to my neighbour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; or you make a back hand, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'dn't you give me some general rules? for then, you know, I might practise in private.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By all means. Seven, Sir, is better nicked by a stamp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. When you want to throw six and four, or two cinques, you must take the long gallery, and whirl the dice to the end of the table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well, please your honour. When your chance is low, as tray, ace, or two deuces, the best method is to dribble out the bones from the box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will that do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour comes rapidly on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So that, perhaps, in a couple of months, I shall be able to tap, flirt, stamp, dribble, and whirl, with any man in the club?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As your honour has a genius, you will make a wonderful progress, no doubt: But these nice matters are not got in a moment; there must be parts, as well as practice, your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! parts for the performance of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This? Why, there's Sir Christopher Clumsey, in the whole losing his fortune, (and
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
I believe he was near a twelvemonth about it) never once threw, paid, or received, with one atom of grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He must have been a dull devil, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A mere dunce! got no credit by losing his money; was ruined without the least reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so. Well, but, Dick, as to the oaths and phrases that are most in use at the club?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have brought them here in this pa∣per: As soon as your honour has got them by heart, I will teach you when and in what man∣ner to use them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE><HI>after looking at the paper.</HI></STAGE>How long do you apprehend before I may be fit to appear at the table?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In a month or six weeks. I would advise your honour to begin in the Newmarket week, when the few people left do little better than piddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right: So I shall gain confidence against the club's coming to town.</P>

<P>Shew her in! <STAGE><HI>Exit Servant.</HI></STAGE>—Well, Dick, you will go down to my steward, and teach him the best method of making a rouleau. And, do you hear? let him give you one for your pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Waiter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour's obedient! You'd have me attend every morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt: It would be madness to lose a minute, you know.<STAGE><HI>Exit Waiter.</HI></STAGE></P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs. Crocus.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Well, Mrs. Crocus; let us see what you have brought me. Your last bouquet was as big as a broom, with a tulip strutting up like a ma∣gistrate's mace; and, besides, made me look like a devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I hope your honour could find no fault with the flowers? It is true, the polyan∣thuses were a little pinched by the easterly winds; but for pip, colour, and eye, I defy the whole parish of Fulham to match 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not; but it is not the flowers, but the mixture, I blame. Why, here now, Mrs. Crocus, one should think you were out of your senses, to cram in this clump of jonquils!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thought your honour was fond of their smell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Damn their smell! it is their colour I talk of. You know my complexion has been tinged by the East, and you bring me here a blaze of yellow, that gives me the jaundice. Look! do you see here, what a fine figure I cut? You might as well have tied me to a bundle of sun-flowers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, your honour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon! there is no forgiving faults of this kind. Just so you served Harry Hectic; you stuck into his bosom a parcel of hyacinths, though the poor fellow's face is as pale as a primrose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And there, at the opera, the poor crea∣ture sat in his side-box, looking like one of the figures in the glass-cases in Westminster-Abbey; dead and drest!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If gentlemen would but give direc∣tions, I would make it my study to suit 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But that your cursed climate won't let you. Have you any pinks or carnations in bloom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They are not in season, your honour. Lillies of the valley—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I hate the whole tribe! What, you

want to dress me up like a corpse! When shall you have any rose-buds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The latter end of the month, please your honour.</P>

<P>At that time you may call.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crocus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour has no further com∣mands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None. You may send nosegays for my chairmen, as usual. <STAGE><HI>Exit Mrs. Crocus.</HI></STAGE> Pic∣card! Here, take that garland away: I believe the woman thought she was dressing a may-pole. Make me a bouquet with the artificial flowers I brought from Milan.</P>

<P>My dear Match'em! Well, what news from Cheapside?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bad enough; very near a total defeat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How so? you were furnished with am¦ple materials.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But not of the right kind, please your honour. I have had but little intercourse with that part of the world: My business has chiefl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
lain on this side of the Bar; and I was weak enough to think both cities alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And arn't they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No two nations can differ so widely! Though money is supposed the idol of mer∣chants, their wives don't agree in the worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In that article I thought the whole world was united.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; they don't know what to do with their money; a Pantheon subscription, or a masquerade ticket, is more negotiable there than a note from the Bank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What think you of a bracelet, or a well-fancied aigret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I should think they must make their way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have sent some rough diamonds to be polished in Holland; when they are returned, I will equip you, Match'em, with some of these toys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Toys? how light he makes of these things!—Bless your noble and generous soul! I believe for a trifle more I could have obtained Lady Lurcher last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She has been pressed a good deal to discharge an old score, long due to a knight from the North; and play-debts, your honour
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
knows, there is no paying in part: She seemed deeply distressed; and I really believe another hun∣dred would have made up the sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And how came you not to advance it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not chuse to exceed my com∣mission; your honour knows the bill was only for five.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you should have immediately made it up; you know I never stint myself in these matters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, had I been in cash, I believe I should have ventured, your honour. If your honour approves, I have thought of a project that will save us both a good deal of trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Communicate, good Mrs. Match'em!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I may not pester you with ap∣plications for every trifle I want, suppose you were to deposit a round sum in my hands.</P>

<P>What, Match'em, make you my banker for beauty? Ha, ha, ha!</P>

<P>Exactly, your honour. Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I don't harbour the least doubt of your honour.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And what becomes of her aunt?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That Argus is to be left in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You had better suspend your operations for a while. Do you know, Mrs. Match'em, that I am a-going to be married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Married? your honour's pleased to be pleasant: That day I hope never to see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The treaty wants nothing but her friends' ratification; and I think there is no danger of their with-holding that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then, the matter is as good as concluded: I was always in dread of this fatal stroke!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, March'em, why should you be so averse to the measure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can it be thought, that with dry eyes I could bear the loss of such a friend as your honour? I don't know how it is, but I am sure I never took such a fancy to any man in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Match'em!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Something so magnificent and princely in all you say or do, that a body has, as I may say, a pleasure in taking pains in your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but prithee, child——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And then, when one has brought matters to bear, no after-reproaches, no grum∣blings from parties, such general satisfaction on all sides! I am sure, since the death of my hus∣band,

band, as honest a man, except the thing he died for—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How came that about, Mrs. Match'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Kit was rather apt to be careless, and put a neighbour's name to a note without stopping to ask his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing else. Since that day, I saw no mortal has caught my eye but your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Match'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say, neither, it was the charms of your person—though they are such as any lady might like—but it was the beauties of your mind, that made an impression upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, prithee, Match'em, dry up your tears! you distress me! Be persuaded you have nothing to fear.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>

<P>To stick up in your room, like any other fine piece of furniture?</P>

<P>Nothing else; as an antique bust or a picture.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That alters the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, I shall be confined a little at first; for when you take or bury a wife, decency requires that you should keep your house for a week: After that time, you will find me, dear Match'em, all that you can wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that is more than your honour can tell. I have known some of my gentlemen, before marriage, make as firm and good resolu∣tions not to have the least love or regard for their wives; but they have been seduced after all, and turned out the poorest tame family fools!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Match.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, a customer of mine did formerly make an attempt; but he pursued too violent measures at first; wanted to confine the ladies against their consent; and that too in a country of freedom.</P>

<P>Impossible, Match'em! in the East we never confide that office to your sex or com∣plexion.

<P>And why so, Mr. Mayor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mayor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know—they do a mortal deal of harm in the country: Why, wherever any of them settles, it raises the price of provisions for thirty miles round. People rail at seasons and crops; in my opinion, it is all along with them there folks, that things are so scarce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you talk like a fool! Suppose they have mounted the beef and mutton a trifle; a'n't we obliged to them too for raising the value of boroughs? You should always set one against t'other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mayor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, is nothing but fair. But how comes it about? and where do these here people get all their wealth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The way is plain enough; from our settlements and possessions abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mayor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, may be so. I've been often minded to ask you what sort of things them there settle∣ments are; because why, as you know, I have been never beyond sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Mayor, I will explain that in a moment: Why, here are a body of mer∣chants that beg to be admitted as friends, and take possession of a small spot in a country, and carry on a beneficial commerce with the inoffensive and innocent people, to which they kindly give their consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mayor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think now that is very civil of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless. Upon which, Mr. Mayor, we cunningly encroach, and fortify by little and by little, till at length, we growing too strong for the natives, we turn them out of their lands, and take possession of their money and jewels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mayor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you think, Master Touchit, that is a little uncivil in us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh, nothing at all: These people are but a little better than Tartars or Turks.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My name, Sir, is Touchit, and these gentlemen some friends and neighbours of mine. We are ordered by the Christian Club, of the borough of Bribe'em, to wait upon your honour, with a tender of the nomination of our two members at the ensuing election.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I accept their offer with pleasure; and am happy to find, notwithstanding all that has been said, that the union still subsists be∣tween Bengal and the ancient corporation of Bribe'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And if they ever are severed, I can assure your honour the Christian Club will not be to blame. Your honour understands me, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly. Nor shall it, I promise you, be my fault, good Mr. Touchit. But, (you will forgive my curiosity, Sir!) the name your club has adopted, has at first at whimsical sound; but you had your reasons, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The very best in the world, please
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
your honour: From our strict union and bro∣therly kindness, we hang together; like the primitive Christians too, we have all things in common.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In common? I don't apprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, please your honour, when the bargain is struck, and the deposit is made, as a proof that we love our neighbours as well as ourselves, we submit to an equal partition; no man has a larger share than another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mile.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A most Christian-like dispensation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; in our borough all is unanimity now: Formerly, we had nothing but discontents and heart-burnings amongst us; each man jea∣lous and afraid that his neighbour got more and did better than him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and with reason sometimes. Why, I remember, at the election some time ago, when I took up my freedom, I could get but thirty guineas for a new pair of jack-boots; whilst Tom Ramskin over the way had a fifty-pound note for a pair of wash-leather breeches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very partial indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, upon the whole, we thought it best to unite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, much the best. Well, Sir, you may assure your principals that shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are

properly to acknowledge the service they do me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, no doubt. But—will your honour step a little this way?—Though no question can be made of your honour's keeping your word, yet it has always been the rule with our club to receive the proper acknowledgment before the service is done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but, Mr. Touchit, suppose the service should never be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What then must become of our con∣sciences? We are Christians, your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True; but, Mr. Touchit, you remem∣ber the proverb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What proverb, your honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There are two bad pay-masters; those who pay before, and those who never pay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, your honour; but our club has always found, that those who don't pay be∣fore are sure never to pay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How! impossible! the man who breaks his word with such faithful and honest adhe∣rents, deserves richly a halter. Gentlemen, in my opinion, he deserves to be hanged.</P>

<P>Both, both.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Touchit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dog-cheap; neck-beef; a penny-loaf for a halfpenny! Why, we had partly agreed to bring in Sir Christopher Quinze and major Match'em for the very same money; but the major has been a little unlucky at Almack's, and at present can't deposit the needful; but he says, however, if he should be successful at the next Newmarket meeting, he will faithfully abide by the bargain: But the turf, your honour knows, is but an uncertain estate, and so we can't de∣pend upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True. Well, Sir, as I may soon have occasion for all the friends I can make, I shall haggle no longer; I accept your proposals: In the next room we will settle the terms.</P>

<P>Gentlemen! Not contented with col∣lecting, for the use of my country, these inesti∣mable relics, with a large catalogue of petri∣factions, bones, beetles, and butterflies, con∣tained in that box, <STAGE><HI>pointing to the present borne by the fourth Black.</HI></STAGE> I have likewise laboured for the advancement of national knowledge: For which end, permit me to clear up some doubts relative to a material and interesting point in the
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
English history. Let others toil to illumine the dark annals of Greece, or of Rome; my searches are sacred only to the service of Britain!</P>
<P>The point I mean to clear up, is an error crept into the life of that illustrious magistrate, the great Whittington, and his no-less-eminent Cat: And in this disquisition four material points are in question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did Whittington ever exist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was Whittington Lord-Mayor of Lon∣don?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was he really possessed of a Cat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was that Cat the source of his wealth?</P>
<P>That Whittington lived, no doubt can be made; that he was Lord-Mayor of London, is equally true; but as to his Car, that, gentle∣men, is the gordian knot to untie. And here, gentlemen, be it permitted me to define what a Cat is. A Cat is a domestic, whiskered, four-footed animal, whose employment is catching of mice; but let Puss have been ever so subtle, let Puss have been ever so successful, to what could Puss's captures amount? no tanner can curry the skin of a mouse, no family make a of the meat; consecquently, no Cat could give Whittington his wealth. From whence then does this error proceed? be that my care <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> point out!</P>
<P>The commerce this worthy merchant carried
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
on, was chiefly confined to our coasts; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this purpose, he constructed a vessel, which, from its agility and lightness, he aptly christened a Cat. Nay, to this our day, gentlemen, all our coals from Newcastle are imported in nothing but Cats. From thence it appears, that it was not the whiskered, four-footed, mouse-killing Cat that was the source of the magistrate's wealth but the coasting, sailing, coal-carrying Cat; that gentlemen, was Whittington's Cat.</P>

<P>Hey! yes, it is—no, it a'n't—yes, it is Mat∣thew Mite.—Lord love your queer face! what a figure you cut! how you are altered! well, had I met with you by chance, I don't think I should ever have known you. I have had a deuced deal of work to get at you.</P>

<P>There is a little fat fellow, that opens the door at your house, was as pert as a pren∣tice just out of his time: He would not give me the least inkling about you; and I should have re∣turned

to Shoreditch as wise as I came, if some folks who are gazing at the fine gilt coach in the street, hadn't told me 'twas yours. Well, Master Mite, things are mainly changed since we were boys at the Blue-Coat: Who could have thought that you would have got so up in the world? for you know you were reckoned a dull one at school.</P>
</SP>

<P>Friend, do you know who you talk to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Putty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, friend, much better than you do. I am told he is become a Knight, and a Nabob; and what of all that? For your Nabobs, they are but a kind of outlandish creatures, that won't pass current with us; and as to knights, we have a few of them in the city, whom I dare speak to without doffing my hat. So, Mr. Scrape∣trencher, let's have no more of your jaw!—I say, Mat, doesn't remember one Easter-Tuesday, how you tipt the barrow-woman into Fleet-Ditch, as we were going about with the hymns?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Putty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How all the folks laughed to see how bolt upright the stood on her head in the mud! ha! ha! ha! And one fifth of November, I shall never forget! how you frightened a preach∣ing methodist taylor, by throwing a cracker into the pulpit.</P>

<P>At every bounce, how poor Stitch ca∣pered and jumped! Ah! many's the merry freak we have had! for this I must say, though Mat was but bad at his book, for mischiefful mat∣ters there wasn't a more ingenous, cuterer lad in the school.</P>

<P>Yes; I have got a fine reputation, I see!</P>

<P>Sir, I arrived but the instant before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, child, I don't blame you. You are no stranger to the almost-invincible bars that oppose your views on my niece; it would be therefore prudent, instead of indulging, to wean yourself by degrees.</P>

<P>Are there no hopes, then, Sir, of subduing my aunt?</P>

<P>How is that possible, Sir? out of her power?</P>

<P>My father has threatened me, in obscure terms, I confess, with the worst that can happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sophy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The total, nay, perhaps, immediate loss of my Sophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sophy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From what cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That in tenderness he chose to con∣ceal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sophy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But why make it a mystery? have you no guess?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not the most distant conception. My lady's dislike would hardly prompt her to such violent measures. I can't comprehend how this can possibly be; but yet my father has too firm, too manly a mind, to encourage or harbour vain fears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sophy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here they come. I suppose the riddle will soon be explained.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="63" REF="68"/><HI>Enter Sir John, Lady, and Thomas Oldham.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But what motive could he have for demanding this whimsical interview? he could not doubt your credentials, or think his pre∣sence could be grateful to us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have delivered my message.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he depends on his rhetorical powers: I hear he has a good opinion of them. Stay, Sophy! Sir Matthew Mite, distrusting the message we begged your uncle to carry, de∣sires to have it confirmed by ourselves: I fancy, child, you will do yourself no violence in re∣jecting this lover. He is an amiable swain, I confess!</P>

<P>I shall be always happy in obeying your ladyship's orders.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, in the main, I am glad of this meeting; it will not only put a final end to this business, but give us an opportunity of discussing other matters, my dear.</P>

<P>Shew him in!—Now, Sir John, be on your guard; support this scene with a dignity that becomes one of your birth and—</P>

<P>Never fear my dignity, love. I warrant you I'll give him as good as he brings.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir Matthew Mite.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I find the whole tribe is convened.—I hope I am not an intruder; but I confess the extraordinary answer I received from the mouth of this worthy citizen, to a message conveyed by my secretary, induced me to question its au∣thenticity, unless confirmed by yourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And why should you think our reply so very extraordinary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You must give me leave to smile at that question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very decisive answer, I own!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are, Lady Oldham, a woman of the world, and supposed not to be wanting in sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Which this conduct of mine inclines you to doubt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be plain, my condition and your own situation considered, prudence might have dictated a different reply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Sir Matthew, upon the ma∣turest deliberation, all the parties, you see, persist in giving no other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it so? You will permit me, Lady Oldham, to desire one of those reasons which influenced this august assembly upon the occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They will, I dare say, appear but trifling to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let us have them, however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>First, we think it right to have a little regard to <HI>her</HI> happiness, as she is indebted for her existence to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Which you think she risques in a union with me? <STAGE><HI>Lady Oldham bows.</HI></STAGE> And why so? I have the means to procure her, madam, those enjoyments with which your sex is chiefly delighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You will, Sir Matthew, pardon my weakness; but I would much rather see my child with a competence, nay, even reduced to an in∣digent state, than voluptuously rioting in plea∣sures that derive their source from the ruin of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ruin! what, you, I find, adopt the po∣pular prejudice, and conclude that every man that is rich is a villain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I only echo the voice of the public. Besides, I would wish my daughter a more solid establishment: The possessions arising from plun∣der very rarely are permanent; we every day see what has been treacherously and rapaciously gained, as profusely and full as rapidly squandered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, madam, to see one of your fashion, concur in the common cry of the times; but such is the gratitude of this country to those who have given it dominion and wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I could wish even that fact was well founded, Sir Matthew. Your riches (which per∣haps too are only ideal) by introducing a general spirit of dissipation, have extinguished labour and industry, the slow, but sure source of national wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To these refinements I have no time to reply. By one of your ladyship's hints I shall profit at least: I shall be a little more careful of the plunder I have made. Sir John Oldham, you recollect a small sum borrowed by you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The obligations for which are in my possession at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understand as much by your letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I find there is an end of our treaty, it would be right, I think, to discharge them directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say that is quite so convenient; besides, I understood the party was to wait till the time that Jack comes of age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am told the law does not understand what is not clearly expressed. Besides, the probable event of your death, or the young gentleman's
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
shyness to fulfil the agreement, are enough to put a man on his guard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now comes on the storm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, that my prudence might not suffer in that lady's opinion, I have taken some pre∣cautions which my attorney will more clearly unfold.—Mr. Rapine!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Rapine.</HI></STAGE>
<P>You will explain this affair to Sir John: I am a military man, and quite a stranger to your legal manoeuvres.</P>

<P>By command of my client, Sir Matthew, I have issued here a couple of writs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Sir John!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>

<P>By one of which, plaintiff possesses the person, by t'other goods and chattels, of Sir John the defendant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Goods, Sir? what, must I be turned out of my house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rap.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam; you may stay here till we fell, which perhaps mayn't happen these two days. We must, indeed, leave a few of our people, just to take care that there is nothing embezzled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A short respite, indeed! For a little
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
time, I dare say, my brother Oldham will afford us protection. Come, Sir John, nor let us in∣dulge that monster's malice with a longer sight of our misery.</P>
</SP>

<P>You, madam, are a wife, and may go where you please; but as to Sir John—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>

<P>Stop, Sir! Mr. Oldham teaches me what I should do. Can I see their distress? Heaven knows with what eagerness I would sacri∣fice my own peace, my own happiness, to procure them relief!<STAGE><HI>Kneels to Sir Matthew.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, niece! nor hope to soften that breast, already made too callous by crimes! I have long seen, Sir, what your malice intended, and pre∣pared myself to baffle its purpose. I am instructed, Sir, in the amount of this man's demands on my brother: You will there find a sum more than sufficient to pay it.—And now, my dear sister, I hope you will please to allow a citizen may be useful sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Rapine, is this manoeuvre according to law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rap.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The law, Sir Matthew, always sleeps when satisfaction is made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Does it? Our practice is different in the Mayor's Court at Calcutta.—I shall now make my bow; and leave this family, whom I wished to make happy in spite of themselves, soon to regret the fatal loss sustained by their obstinate folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor can it be long, before the wisdom of their choice will appear; as by partaking of
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
the spoil, they might have been involved in that vengeance, which soon or late can't fail to fall on the head of the author: And, Sir, notwithstanding your seeming security, perhaps the hour of re∣tribution is near!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You must, Master Oldham, give me leave to laugh at your prophetic effusion. This is not Sparta, nor are these the chaste times of the Roman republic: Now-a-days, riches possess at least one magical power, that, being rightly dispensed, they closely conceal the source from whence they proceeded: That wisdom, I hope never to want.— I am the obsequious servant of this respectable family! Adieu!—Come along, Rapine!</P>
</SP>

<P>Brother, what words can I use, or how can we thank you as we ought? Sir John! Sophy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am doubly paid, Lady Oldham, in supplying the wants of my friends, and defeating the designs of a villain: As to the mere money, we citizens indeed are odd kind of folks, and always expect good security for what we advance.</P>
</SP>

<P>Sir John's person, his fortune, every——</P>
