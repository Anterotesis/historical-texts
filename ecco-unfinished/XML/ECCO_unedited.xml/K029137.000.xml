<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> DID not at first intend to trouble the Reader with any Preface, knowing it to be impossible by any Arguments to obtain a favourable and impartial Perusal of a Performance of this Nature, from a Set of Men, who seem of late to have thrown off every human and christian Obligation to Charity and Benevolence, and stick at nothing to promote those carnal arbitrary Interests, which all honest and sober Christians, but especially Protestants, must for ever condemn. Neither do I now trouble Him with such an Intent: For since the most noble, generous and christian Behaviour of the Bishop of <HI>Bangor</HI> towards all his Adversaries, has prov'd
<PB REF="6"/>
ineffectual, and still produc'd quite different Treat∣ment towards himself, how arrogant and presump∣tuous would it be for any one to expect the least Favour, who dares use Them after their own Manner? For my self, the Reader will perceive by the following Lines, that I defy their Malice as much as I abhor their Tyranny; and that I dis∣dain all the blackest Misrepresentations, that either the most bigotted Prejudice can suggest, or the most industrious Calumny can invent. I shall very readily, and very patiently submit to the Names of <HI>Atheist, Libertine, Freethinker, Enemy</HI> to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Reve∣lation,</HI> &amp;c. rather than sordidly give into Their absurd and self-contradicting Principles; rather than impiously expect my eternal Salvation from a weak human Tribunal; and tamely sacrifice my Conscience to the Direction and Disposal of an haughty, petulant, fallible, earthly Guide; rather than profess one Thing, and practise quite the con∣trary; rather than call my self a <HI>Protestant,</HI> whilst I am openly acting over the <HI>Papist</HI> in the Face of the World. The Man, that can stand silently by, and unmov'd behold, much more approve and abet such unchristian and unwarrantable Proceedings, as the <HI>Engines</HI> of this World have of late been trans∣acting, must be instigated by something worse than
<PB REF="7"/>
the mere Prejudices of Interest, Complexion, or Education. It would be no less tedious than needless to mention the numberless Instances of Bitterness, Malice and Insolence, which have with∣in one Year only been made use of to blacken the unspotted Character of a truly Christian and Pro∣testant Bishop, since his Lordship has Himself so publickly and in so full a Manner answer'd each particular Calumny, as soon as it first appear'd in the World, and defeated the cruel Expectations of his Enemies. The Controversy was no sooner be∣gun, but the Malignity of his Adversaries broke out into personal Reflections, and personal Abuses; and through the whole Course of the Debate no∣thing is to be met with on one Side, but a con∣tinued Series of impotent Slander and Defamation; whilst on the other, instead of such unjustifiable Methods of Argument, the Reader finds the most conclusive Reasonings join'd with the most benevo∣lent Candour, and christian Deportment. If we may know the Tree by the Fruit that it bears, the Cause which is now carrying on, cannot be the Cause of Christianity, for the Cause of Christianity will never stand in need of the meanest Artifices of the Devil to support it, but is built on a much
<PB REF="8"/>
surer Foundation, than of Wrath, of Violence and Persecution.</P>
<P>And here, since the worthy Dean of <HI>Chichester</HI> has thought fit to publish to the World a Cata∣logue of <HI>unjustifiable Extremes;</HI> which, it seems, his Lordship has run into meerly <HI>thro' Opposition;</HI> I will venture to point out one, amongst ten thou∣sand, which one of his Friends hath run into, and which I humbly conceive to be much more unjusti∣fiable, and much more <HI>shocking</HI> than any he can produce; and which ought indeed to make the Ears of a Christian <HI>tingle.</HI> Mr. <HI>Marsden, Arch∣deacon of Nottingham,</HI> in his Remarks on the Bi∣ship's Sermon, after having attempted to prove that his Lordship had perverted his Text; and that Christ's Kingdom is not the same with Christ's Church, or at least only so in <HI>some Sense,</HI> speaks at last <HI>p.</HI> 23. in this Manner. <Q>This <HI>(that Christ's “Kingdom is his Church)</HI> is <HI>gratis dictum</HI> with Re∣lation to your Text, which is an Answer to <HI>Pi∣late,</HI> as I have already said; and an Answer not so <HI>properly Matter of Choice,</HI> but rather our bles∣sed Saviour was in <HI>some Manner obliged</HI> to make it, by the Nature of <HI>Pilate's Question,</HI> and of ”the Occasion.</Q> I will now appeal to any im∣partial Man in the World, whether our blessed
<PB REF="9"/>
Saviour, the upright, undesigning <HI>Jesus,</HI> is not in this Sentence represented under the Character of a cunning, timorous, cavilling Sophister; of one that would not scruple even a solemn Prevarica∣tion, to evade an hampering Question, and to serve a vile worldly Occasion. What Reparation this learned Person is able to make to the whole Christian World for so foul an Indignity on the Per∣son of our Saviour, I confess my self at a Loss to imagine; but hope that with due Application made to Him, He will either explain himself on this Occasion, or forthwith ingenuously retract so ungrounded an Assertion. I the rather mention this learned and scurrilous Remarker, because the ordinary Reader, who may not perhaps have read the whole Controversy, would otherwise think what I have said of Him in the following Poem, to be nothing but Poetical Flourish, and Satyrical Hyperbole and Aggravation; and to induce Him to believe that all my other Characters are not made up of the mere Common-places of Satire, but that most of what I have said, may be justify'd from each Person's particular Writings and Beha∣viour.</P>
<P>I might also, for my Justification in this Matter, refer the Reader to a late Pamphlet, intitled, <HI>a Let∣ter
<PB REF="10"/>
to the Reverend Dr.</HI> Bradford, <HI>occasion'd by his Sermon preach'd before the King,</HI> &amp;c. He will there find the generous and extensive Protestant-Reforma∣tion-Principles so wretchedly straiten'd, and con∣fined to one particular small Number of Men, that it must needs make any considering Christian de∣spair of Salvation; for He has plainly asserted, that nothing but an <HI>exact Unity of Faith and Wor∣ship,</HI> of the <HI>Externals</HI> and <HI>Internals</HI> of Religion, will intitle us to the Favour of God. I shall pro∣duce an Instance or two. Having stept aside in the beginning of his Letter to take notice of a Sen∣tence in Dr. <HI>Hayley</HI>'s Sermon before the KING, where that learned Divine says, <HI>that it is impossible Men's Thoughts should run exactly in the same Chan∣nel:</HI> This Remarker adds, <HI>p.</HI> 9. <HI>I am of the same Opinion, if They are not guided and directed by</HI> one <HI>and the</HI> same <HI>Rule, but are left every one to follow their own Fancies and Imaginations.</HI> What can <HI>Bellarmine</HI> Himself contend for more?</P>
<P>In another Place he says, <HI>p.</HI> 14.—<Q>All Reasoning “about matters of Religion, and divine Revelation, must for ever cease and be at an end, if Christians erect a Court of Conscience in their <HI>own</HI> Hearts, which cannot be govern'd and determin'd by the reveal'd Will of God, <HI>or</HI> by the Decisions of the
<PB REF="11"/>
Bishops and Pastors of the Church, in Things properly subject to their Jurisdiction and Autho∣rity.”</Q> To which it is easy to answer, That all Reasonings about <HI>Matters of Religion</HI> and <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> can never be govern'd and determin'd by the reveal'd Will of God, unless Christians <HI>erect</HI> a Court of Conscience in their own Hearts; and that <HI>such Matters of Religion</HI> and <HI>divine Revela∣tion</HI> (if he means any thing to the purpose) ought to be govern'd and determin'd by the reveal'd Will of God, and by the Court of Conscience which Christians erect in their own Hearts; and not by the Decisions of the Bishops and Pastors of the Church; nor are <HI>such</HI> things properly subject to their Jurisdic∣tion and Authority. This Anonymous Letter-writer is indeed so profess'd an Enemy to Conscience and private Judgment in Matters of Religion, that I very much suspect him to be some lurking <HI>Romish</HI> Emissary, adapting himself to the Air of the Times: And what almost confirms me in the Suspicion, is, that thro' the whole Letter he seems mighty fond of the Words <HI>Antient, Primitive, Catholick Church;</HI> by which, every one knows, the modern Papists often express the <HI>Church of England,</HI> meaning there∣by, as it stood before the Reformation. Besides; any one that considers his Notion of a <HI>Reformation,</HI>
<PB REF="12"/>
would be apt to think, that he meant a Reforma∣tion TO POPERY; for he expresly says, <HI>p.</HI> 15.— <Q>“That all those who understand the true <HI>Interests</HI> and <HI>Claims</HI> of the Church, will allow, that it still wants a <HI>farther</HI> Reformation; and that it ought to approach <HI>still nearer</HI> to the Establishment ”and Constitution of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Church:</Q> Whereas on the contrary, most of our modern Churchmen are of Opinion, that we are already TOO FAR remov'd FROM Popery. But this is not all; for <HI>p.</HI> 19. after having given us his narrow Notions of Reformation-Principles, he proceeds openly to condemn our great <HI>Protestant Reformers,</HI> for a pack of ignorant and designing Persons, in these Words. <Q>I am very sensible, that the <HI>Re∣formers</HI> “themselves <HI>did not,</HI> all of <HI>them, under∣stand</HI> the true Nature and Constitution of the <HI>Christian Church;</HI> and that some of them, who did understand those Things, <HI>were obliged to un∣reasonable Compliances</HI> with the Secular Powers, to secure their Protection and Defence against the Power of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and its Adhe∣rents. The Church was oblig'd to purchase a Reformation at a great Expence, both of its ”<HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal Interests.</HI></Q> Is it possible for any one to believe that so open and undis∣guis'd
<PB REF="13"/>
an Attack upon the Reformation, can be made by one who even <HI>calls</HI> himself a <HI>Protestant?</HI> What follows is still as remarkable.</P>
<P><Q>“—<HI>An Union</HI> among Protestants—will be found, to be very practicable, when the several sorts of Protestants shall have laid aside their private Interests, Partialities, and <HI>particular Opinions</HI> and <HI>Sentiments;</HI> and resign <HI>their Judgments</HI> to be di∣rected and govern'd by the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of ”the <HI>Catholick Church.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding what follows, I cannot possibly comprehend what he means by the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Au∣thority of the Catholick Church,</HI> unless he means of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> because I know no <HI>Church</HI> besides, to whose <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> Christians are requi∣red to resign their <HI>particular</HI> Opinions, their Senti∣ments and their Judgments. In many other Places he earnestly contends that Christians are indispensably bound to submit to the <HI>Dictates,</HI> and <HI>Authority of the Catholick Church.</HI> From all which I think it very reasonable to suspect, that the Letter-writer is a profess'd Papist; but I may be mistaken, since we are not without Examples of <HI>professed</HI> Protestants of this sort. However, I may very safely affirm, that he is a Protestant only in Profession; so that it is amazing to me, to find him, <HI>p.</HI> 16 ridiculing the
<PB REF="14"/>
pretty new Notion (as he calls it) of <HI>Protestant Popery,</HI> because His whole Letter, if it be not di∣rectly Popish, is, I am sure, far from being Protes∣tant; it must be therefore a mixture of both, it must be <HI>Protestant Popery.</HI></P>
<P>But to conclude, what I have said in the follow∣ing Pages, will either sufficiently Apologize for it∣self, or will admit of no Apology. I shall only say, that it is intended for the Entertainment of none but Protestant Readers: For as to the furious, arbitrary, fallible-infallible Churchman; the <HI>passive, non-resisting, Rebellious</HI> Jacobite, and the insolent <HI>Assassinating</HI> Nonjuror, I shall most joyfully, and with all Resignation abandon myself to Their Hatred, and despise all Their Insults, as I would the impotent Fury of Madmen in Fetters: They may burst with Envy, if They please, without giving me any Uneasiness.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I Do hereby publickly forbid the <HI>reverend, lear∣ned and worthy</HI> Doctors, SNAPE and SHER∣LOCK, with all their <HI>Seconds,</HI> and all other Persons whatsoever, at any future Pinch of Argument, to charge his Lordship, the <HI>Bishop of Bangor,</HI> with either directly or indirectly employing or encoura∣ging the Author of the following Poem, <HI>to abuse the whole Clergy of the Nation, in order to exalt his own Character:</HI> For I do hereby declare, that I am an unconcern'd By-stander and Spectator, utterly unacquainted with the Person of his Lordship, and of all the principal Writers in this Controversy, and therefore disinterested on that Account; but that, warm'd into Resentment at the unchristian Behaviour of <HI>some</HI> Persons towards his Lordship, I did of myself, <HI>unsway'd by either Hopes or Fears,</HI> undertake this Task, without any Application made to me, or Encouragement from any Man upon Earth. And I do particularly command the <HI>reverend, learned and worthy</HI> Dean of <HI>Chichester,</HI> not to place me to his Lordship's Account, in his <HI>future Catalogue of Abuses;</HI> for that being myself alone the Person guilty, I do intreat him to let me bear my∣self
<PB REF="16"/>
all the Imputations which may be fix'd upon my own Works, and which myself alone deserve; and not bring innocent Persons into the Quarrel. And I do, lastly, desire the World, if either of those two <HI>reverend, learned</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> Persons, or any Body else should, contrary to this Prohibition and Declaration, make use of the Name of this Poem, by way of Argument against his Lordship, to lay no weight upon it, but look upon it as meer Invention and stupid Forgery, as proceeding from an implacable Rancour of Heart, and from a Dearth of more material, argumentative, controversial Calumny.</P>
